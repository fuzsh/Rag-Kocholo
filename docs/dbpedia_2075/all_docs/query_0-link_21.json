        "text": "The History of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists is a history of the people who created exploration geophysics and the technologies they created intertwined with global events. The SEG grew from a handful of members of a local society based in Houston into a great international organization.\n\nReach for the Future\n\n2014 SEG Wiki expands\n\nSEG's Annual Meeting drew drew 8,540 attendees, featuring a technical program with 993 papers presented—589 oral, 119 paper posters, and 285 e-posters.\n\n2013 SEG's Annual Meeting drew 11,015 attendees, the largest registration since 1999.\n\nThe meeting featured a record technical program with 992 papers presented—624 oral, 176 paper posters, and 192 e-posters.\n\n2012 SEG approves a new journal INTERPRETATION co-published with AAPG.\n\nSEG opened a Middle East Office in Dubai and launched a new journal INTERPRETATION, which it will copublish with AAPG\n\n2011 New SEG Bylaws approved.\n\nNew SEG Bylaws were approved through a vote of Active Members and call for a Board of Directors with at least 14 voting members serving multiple-year terms.\n\n2010 Governance reform proposal narrowly defeated.\n\nA governance-reform proposal that would have established an 18-member board of directors as SEG's primary governing body is narrowly defeated by the SEG Council. Steven H. Davis is selected as the Society's executive director, replacing Mary L. Fleming, who retired.\n\n2009 Despite a worldwide recession, SEG's Annual Meeting in Houston drew strong attendance.\n\nSEG's Annual Meeting in Houston drew more than 9,200 delegates and filled four exhibit halls with technical session posters and exhibits.===\n\n2008 SEG opens its first office outside of the United States in Beijing, China.\n\nSEG opened its first office outside the United States in Beijing, China, on 3 April. The SEG Foundation exceeded its US$15 million campaign goal, celebrating pledges totaling more than US$17 million during a celebration at the Annual Meeting in Las Vegas, USA. At year's end, pledges totaled US$17 232.410. SEG membership exceeded 33,000.\n\nThe SEG Museum in Tulsa is mothballed.\n\n2007 The SEG Foundation launches a major gifts campaign intended to attract young people into geophysics.\n\nThe SEG Foundation launched a US$15 million major-gifts campaign, \"Advancing Geophysics Today, Inspiring Geoscientists for Tomorrow,\" aimed at accelerating the rate of geophysical innovation and knowledge transfer and attracting more young people to careers in the geosciences.\n\n2006 SEG Annual Meeting in New Orleans, one year after Hurricane Katrina\n\nSEG held a highly successful Annual Meeting in New Orleans barely a year after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city. Membership exceeded 27,000 late in the year.\n\n2005 75th Anniversary of SEG\n\nSEG marked its 75th anniversary with celebrations at section meetings throughout the world, a special publication, retrospective journal articles, a video about geophysics and the Society, an extra distinguished lecture, historical photos on the SEG Web site, and special exhibits at the Annual Meeting in Houston. Membership surpassed 25,000 late in the year.\n\n2004 SEG adopts a three-tiered dues structure.\n\nTo address income disparity among geophysicists around the world, the Council approved a three-tiered dues structure that allows Active membership at all three levels. Membership approaches 23,000.\n\n2003 The majority of members of SEG live outside the United States.\n\nSEG membership exceeds 20,000 for the first time, and a majority of members lives outside the United States.\n\n2002 A 4th edition of Sheriff's Dictionary published as Encyclopedic Dictionary of Applied Geophysics\n\nThe fourth edition of SEG's all-time best-selling book, retitled Encyclopedic Dictionary of Applied Geophysics to reflect the increasingly diverse employment of the membership, is published. Attendance at the Annual Meeting is disappointing, probably because of the out-of-the-mainstream venue (Salt Lake City) and the travel restrictions imposed after the terrorist attacks a year earlier. However, the meeting has one of the all-time magical moments of any SEG convention—the multimedia presentation of Robert Ballard, discoverer of the Titanic, which wows hundreds of junior high students and experienced geoscientists.\n\n2001 SEG Annual Meeting in San Antonio\n\nThe SEG Executive Committee authors a strategic vision of the future of geophysics and SEG's role in it. While SEG's Annual Meeting is under way in San Antonio, the terrorist attacks of September 11 take place. The meeting proceeds with only minor disruptions. Mary L. Fleming, director of programs at the American Statistical Association, is selected executive director in December.\n\n2000 SEG Annual Meeting held in Calgary.\n\nSEG Annual Meeting returns to Calgary for the first time since 1977. This is only the third time the meeting has been held outside the United States. Sally Zinke becomes the first woman to hold the office of SEG President. The increasing percentage of members residing outside the U.S. causes the International Affairs Committee to be radically restructured and renamed the Global Affairs Committee. Membership: 16,894.\n\n1990-1999: International Society\n\n1999 SEG Annual Meeting in Houston draws highest number of attendees since 1987\n\nDespite a turbulent year in the petroleum industry, the Annual Meeting in Houston drew 11,103 attendees, and there were 1,276 booth sales—second-highest total ever. Also, paid membership grew to nearly 16,000, the highest total since 1987. A major redesign of the SEG Web site was completed, and an equipment donation from Sun Microsystems helped prepare SEG for a bold digital future.\n\n1998 All-time record of booths sold for the Annual Meeting in New Orleans. SEG Museum reorganized.\n\nAn all-time record of 1,457 booths were sold for the Annual Meeting in New Orleans. The SEG Museum was reorganized by the addition of a Virtual Museum and Traveling Museum to the existing museum in Tulsa. The Distinguished Educator program was launched and Robert R. Stewart of the University of Calgary was chosen as the first honoree. A new logo was adopted by the Council to reflect the Society's increasingly international nature.\n\n1997 The SEG Distinguished Instructor program inaugurated.\n\nThe Distinguished Instructor program was inaugurated, wherein a selected individual presents a short course in various sites around the globe. The first instructor is Ian Jack. A constitutional amendment was approved which increased the membership of the Nominations Committee from the historical three most recent past-presidents by four members to be selected by a prescribed method from the Sections and Associated Societies.\n\n1996 SEG Online is moved internally to SEG headquarters.\n\nThe donation of a Sun Netra Webserver to SEG by Sun Microsystems allowed the Web site to be moved to the Business Office, enabling the entire Internet operations to be done in-house.\n\n1995 Expanded Abstracts of the Annual Meeting offered on CD Rom.\n\nA CD-ROM of the Expanded Abstracts of that meeting was offered at the Annual Meeting in Houston.\n\n1994 SEG Membership numbers begin to recover. GEOROM includes TLE and Sheriff's Dictionary\n\nA nine-year decline in membership was interrupted when gains were shown in each category of membership. GEOROM was expanded to include selected articles from The Leading Edge plus Sheriff's Dictionary, The Cumulative Index, and Expanded Abstracts from the Annual Meeting. An SEG Home Page, hosted by Stanford University and maintained by volunteers led by Brian Spies, was established.\n\n1993 The SEG GEOROM containing GEOPHYSICS issues from 1936-1992 produced.\n\nGEOROM, a set of CD-ROMs containing fifty-seven volumes of Geophysics – 1936-1992 – fully searchable, was produced. The mortgage on SEG's building, the Geophysical Resource Center, was retired.\n\n1992 Midyear SEG Meeting held in Moscow\n\nSuccessful midyear meeting held in Moscow. Record income of just under $7 million for the year.\n\n1991 SEG Executive Committee approve annual mid-year meetings in venues outside of the United States.\n\nAttendance at the 61st Annual Meeting in Houston was 10,670. The Executive Committee adopted a policy of holding a midyear meeting annually in a venue outside North America.\n\nThe SEG Foundation Trustee Associates (and spouses) held its first annual meeting at the Marriott Grand Hotel in Pointe Clear, Alabama on the east side of Mobile Bay. Efforts by Publications Committee Chairman Stan Ward beginning in 1989 resulted in publications sales in 1991 to total a staggering US$903 813. Increase of US$10 in membership dues as of 1/1/91.
