        "text": "Citation preview\n\nUrban Life in Nordic Countries\n\nBased on empirical studies, this book investigates the particular urban history of the North from the 17th century until today in a comparative, Northern perspective. Urban Life in Nordic Countries is the result of a conference on ‘Urbanity in the Periphery’, held in Stockholm on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Institute of Urban History at Stockholm University, aimed at establishing the field of the urban history of the North and creating a network of urban historians of the North. With a broad range of contributions from Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway, and Estonia, the volume seeks to further the discourse on the region within national and transnational lenses and to highlight possibilities for new cooperation among researchers. Urban history is a transdisciplinary subject, engaging not only historians but also ethnologists, sociologists, urban planners, and cultural geographers, and this book targets all scholars whose work requires a historical understanding of the Northern town. European urban historians outside the region will also find this text valuable as one of the few studies to consider the urban history of the continent from a North-centred viewpoint. Heiko Droste is Professor of Urban History at Stockholm University. His research interests concern Swedish and Baltic premodern history, welfare cities, urban memory cultures, and nostalgia.\n\nRoutledge Advances in Urban History Series Editors: Bert De Munck\n\nCentre for Urban History, University of Antwerp\n\nSimon Gunn\n\nCentre for Urban History, University of Leicester\n\nThis series showcases original and exciting new work in urban history.

Urban historians from across the Nordic, including the Baltic, countries were invited. Discussions were fruitful, and we soon agreed to publish the results of the conference to advance and encourage future comparative studies and scholarly cooperation on the urban history of the North.1 The institute was founded in 1919 by representatives of the Swedish municipalities. This occurred at about the same time as a substantial number of national organizations of different kinds came into being. The nationstate was simply a matter of course, initiating institutions and research of all kinds that would demonstrate the nation’s place in both historical and modern societies. The Institute of Urban History defined its tasks accordingly. It also responded to the rapid, but late, urbanization and industrialization of Stockholm and many other cities in Sweden. These processes would cause several waves of modernization that would change the face of most cities completely. There was a sense of loss of the ‘old Sweden’ and its towns, and this feeling has been a part of the interest in Swedish urban history ever since.2 The Institute’s research and publications have mostly dealt with Sweden’s urban history, working within the national context that framed the Institute’s foundations. However, the Institute has always been interested and active in international cooperation, not least in light of the apparent similarities between Sweden and other Nordic countries.3 The decision to organize an international conference on the occasion of the Institute’s birthday was therefore almost a foregone conclusion. Relationships between the Nordic countries have been vivid and fruitful; however, they have not been able to question their national frameworks. This national focus within Nordic urban history is also responsible for the fact that research is regularly published in the relevant national language and aimed at an audience within that nation-state.4\n\nxviii Preface The same can probably be said about the interest in urban history in other Nordic – and for that matter, European – countries as in Sweden. Although there have been studies of many other countries, and despite cooperation and conferences on Northern and European topics,5 the nation-state is a paradigm, as well as a frame of reference, that is seldom ignored. Presentday research agendas tend to strengthen this national focus out of a desire for readily applicable results that target the nation-states’ present needs. The field of urban studies is thus a typical case for this presentist approach to academic and publicly funded research. Cities are once again in need of change due to their de-industrialization and their countries’ rurbanization,6 as well as the numerous challenges caused by climate change. The role of historical studies in this new research landscape is unclear. This might be explained by an urban norm in society planning, which has since antiquity equated cities with progress and modernization. This notion continues to affect urban research in many ways, in particular because it questions the need for historical studies and perceives the non-urban in terms of antithetical backwardness. On top of that, Nordic urban history still lingers on the periphery of European urban studies, in the same way as Eastern European urban history. Handbooks usually make only superficial contact with these urban regions, which, due to their peripheral location, also tend to be described as less urbanized. Within the urban narrative of progress, the North and the East have been diagnosed with a lack of the urban achievement and patriotism that is at the core of many historical studies of numerous Golden Ages in the central, western, and southern parts of Europe. A Whig approach to the history of European urbanity, particularly for the medieval and early modern periods, is still common. Thus, Northern and Eastern European urban history constitutes a lacuna in the broader field of Europe’s urban history. One example among many is Maarten Prak’s inspiring study on the heritage of premodern European urban political structures and their role for today’s political ideas.7 In this study, the Nordic and Eastern European urban regions are not mentioned at all. The role of local communities in the development of democratic institutions, which is discussed often in Nordic contexts, simply fails to align with the notion of a progressive urban political culture. The same lack of interest in the details of Nordic urban history is also visible in most handbooks on European urban history, which do not include more than occasional references to Northern and Eastern Europe.8 And certainly, the Nordic countries are not easily comparable to cities in the urban blue banana. In his book European Cities and Towns,9 Peter Clark distinguished between four urban regions in Europe. According to him, the Nordic countries, together with Scotland and Ireland, constitute a region that he calls the Outer Northern region. However, in his book, Clark did not\n\nPreface xix explain his idea in detail. He elaborated on this concept in his presentation at the Urbanity in Periphery conference, in which he suggested several defining markers for this region.10 His paper opens this volume and sets the agenda for several papers that target this Outer Northern region in comparative studies. Thus, this volume is meant to open the field of Nordic urban history for comparative studies within the North and with other European countries, by engaging in studies that try to bridge the paradigm of the national that has been so strong. However, there is also a growing interest in regional and area studies, deliberately counteracting the national perspective by focusing on the region. That concerns not only regions like the Øresund Region11 but also the Arctic region, which has its own distinct urban culture.12 The Arctic region, especially the coastline in the Bothnian Bay, was deliberately urbanized in the early 1600s as a marker of the Swedish Crown’s ambition to colonize the northern parts of its territory.13 The results of this comparative endeavour reveal a variety of similarities and simultaneous developments, particularly for the 19th and 20th centuries. Next to the process of industrialization, these resemblances can be explained by the political, cultural, and religious similarities of the Nordic countries, which have, since the late 19th century, engaged in strengthening contacts between planners and state and city officials.14 At the same time, contacts with Scotland and Ireland, which in their urban development show distinct similarities to the North are not regularly considered, despite intense contacts in particular between these countries and Norway. Clark offers an interesting explanation, referring to the history of the concept of the North, which since the 19th century has been part of the national self-image of those countries that are considered part of ‘the North’. In this concept of the North, Scotland and Ireland are not included. The North is, thus, a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy, both in the eyes of politicians and in our own, as urban historians. There is no doubt that similarities exist between the Nordic countries, partially created as well as strengthened by way of Nordic cooperation. However, we lack a discussion about the region’s borders. When do the effects of the North fade out – and why? Being situated in Stockholm, it is quite easy to feel that the boundaries of the region make sense. The ways in which Scotland and Ireland in the West, or the Baltic countries in the South-East, are part of this region – and thus a specific model of urban settlements – are not easy to ascertain.15 The Baltic countries, with their strong position of culturally German trade cities, are especially interesting in this respect. The chapters by Piret Lotman and Kasper Kepsu demonstrate the conflicts that occurred when the major Baltic harbour cities were incorporated into the Swedish Realm and the Crown’s urban policy. That had many consequences for the economic interests of these Baltic harbour cities.16\n\nxx Preface The following 17 chapters are all based on presentations at the 2019 Urban Peripheries conference. They try to answer the need for comparative, as well as transnational, perspectives. However, they cannot fill all the gaps and do in fact themselves highlight more lacunae, such as the lack of comparative studies including Scotland and Ireland. There is also the oftneglected topic of the religious fabric of nations and cities: for example, the role of a specific kind of orthodox Lutheranism, which was and still is particularly strong in the Nordic countries due to its significance for the Crowns’ and later the nation-states’ legitimacy already in the early modern period, is not discussed sufficiently. The topic of the dominance of just one capital city in the economic, political, and cultural life of the respective nation-states also remains underexplored. These metropoles are hard to incorporate in their countries’ urban history, not least because the centrally located governments exerted a strong influence over their capitals. In premodern times, Swedish – and for that matter also Danish – urban politics were shaped by the Crown’s rather distinct ideas of the city’s role for the realm, with little resistance to their agendas on behalf of their respective governments, even if they worked against the interests of the cities themselves.17 In other regions, local power holders or a peripheral location afforded cities an agency that was not always intended but could not be overruled by a far-away capital. This perspective was suggested by Knut Dørum to compare the premodern urban history of the Northern countries.18 Strangely enough, it was not easy to counter his perspective on the basis of the urban history studies in Sweden, simply because national research traditions are not always compatible even within the North.19 The lack of transnational comparisons is even more problematic when the Nordic cities are to be compared to the rather autonomous ‘city-republics’ on the continent. The last point alerts us to another lacuna that needs to be addressed in the future. As mentioned earlier, the Institute of Urban History was founded at the time of the nation-state’s organizational formation. That did lead to a strong paradigm of nation-based research. It has, however, also offered an almost self-evident framework of research questions, based on each respective nation’s perception of urban history. That is not a criticism of the research in itself. The different research agendas in the Nordic countries are relevant for the understanding of their respective trajectories of urban history. However, there is a strong focus on aspects of the social and administrative organization, as well as the planning processes, of cities, with too little attention paid to specific urban cultures or questions of political representation within the cities. Indeed, the latter topic is often neglected in favour of questions of the organization of rural settlements. In all Nordic countries, rural communities attract much more attention than\n\nPreface xxi in continental historical research, because peasant cultures are an integral part of the region’s national memory cultures. Urban ‘culture’ is, furthermore, a notoriously fuzzy concept. Perhaps, we should try to define a specific Nordic urban culture, marked by administrative and planning achievements, which in their turn might explain why the Nordic countries are among the most urbanized countries in the world today, although they had been rather rural until at least the late 19th century, possibly with the exception of Denmark.20 Many of today’s towns are not at all unlike many smaller towns in other parts of Europe and do not match the more idealistic view of urban culture that tends to set the agenda for European urban research, which consequently explains the lack of interest in these small towns.21 Nordic cities urbanized late and quite often on the basis of their acquired or assigned industrial or infrastructural functions – and thus not primarily as merchant cities or academic centres. They were then appointed by the nation-state to manage many tasks and resources in the field of social welfare, which, based on a long tradition of local self-government in both cities and countryside parish communities, was perceived as a municipal matter. There is also a long tradition of social welfare in premodern rural and urban settlements.22 However, the specific result of this process – the Nordic welfare cities – does not receive sufficient attention, even within the Nordic countries, because this form of welfare is mostly perceived as the result of state politics, which caused a process of municipalization that eventually questioned the cities’ status as privileged settlements.23 However, the role of welfare cities can explain several distinct markers of the urban cultures of the North, which are more concerned with local selfadministration and less with questions of ‘high culture’.24 That is particularly obvious in parts II and III of this volume, where questions of planning and social infrastructure are at the fore. The second Industrial Revolution caused many urban settlements to grow rapidly, often without a distinct urban planning process. The new towns and urban settlements often appeared in less populated parts of the North, inserted by the state into a hierarchy of urban settlements with different sets of privileges.25 However, even these urban settlements were shaped by a variety and density of urban functions that towns of similar size in more central parts of Europe rarely offer.26 Both utopian concepts of urbanism in peripheral regions27 and town-like settlements of shifting legal status were common; however, they are not always easy to define according to prevalent concepts of the town and, thus, are often poorly researched.28 Urbanization took place in many smaller cities for a very long time before de-industrialization and the modern service economy favoured just a few metropoles and university cities.29\n\nxxii Preface These planning ideas concerned not only the cities themselves but also the supply of water,30 healthcare,31 and housing.32 In modern times, the Nordic capital cities are gaining international recognition as centres of creative industries, design, and a rich living environment, as well as for their proximity to nature and their innovative infrastructures.33 The history of the urban North, therefore, offers a variety of examples for a better understanding of today’s cities. They help us broaden our understanding of urban developments, which are more varied than a perspective on the achievements of major urban centres in the blue banana alone demonstrates. The current volume wants to open up possibilities for new cooperation within the North and for comparative studies on aspects that are common for the region, within national frameworks, but also focusing on the transnational regions, which seem to be strengthened despite the nationstates’ reluctance to transfer functions and resources. Many topics need to be addressed more, some of which have already been mentioned here. We hope that this first conference in 2019, as well as this publication, will pave the way for continuous collaborations and common research projects. Moreover, the volume wants to question the long-established hierarchy of urban regions in Europe. The Nordic cities look and work differently than the usual merchant capitals, which are still on almost everybody’s agenda. There is a different set of functions, creating a different kind of urbanity. However, the concept of urbanity seems to have lost interest among historians lately, not least as this urbanity – in the same way as ‘urban culture’ – is a concept that needs to be sharpened. The rich archaeological research in the Nordic countries has, however, changed how this urbanity is discussed. There is, therefore, every reason to consider more cooperation with archaeologists, who offer a less idealistic perspective on urban settlements, which prospered with or without the Crown’s approval.34 Many chapters in this volume also suggest that the specific urbanity of the North is not so much about participation in a higher urban culture as it is about a culture of administration and self-government, which so far has delivered a comparatively high level of legitimacy for urban settlements of all kinds. Many topics wait for transnational, trans-disciplinary, historical research, with a long historical perspective. This volume – as well as the conference in 2019 – was made possible by generous support from Stockholm University, the City of Stockholm, and not least the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SKR). The editor also wants to thank in particular Nils Fabiansson for his diligent help with the preparation of the manuscript, Gwendolyne Knight for her help with language editing of several papers, and not least the authors for their willingness to answer all comments and suggestions. Finally, I am\n\nPreface xxiii thankful for the support from Routledge and the possibility to publish this volume in the series Routledge Advances in Urban History.

European policymakers and social scientists have long recognised the phenomenon. Historians have been slow to study and comprehend the crucial role of regions, particularly large regions, in European development, though this is starting to change, not least in the field of urban history.1 In this chapter, I argue the case for examining Northern cities in a wide regional perspective. I outline a possible taxonomy of the defining attributes of Northern urbanism and highlight from the current literature some of the key phases of urban interaction across the region. Hopefully, some of my general arguments will tie up with the detailed analyses of Nordic urban development presented in the subsequent chapters. However, to start, it is important to stress the value of a regional approach, particularly focusing on the large European regions. In my book European Cities and Towns 400–2000 (2009), I suggested that there were four main historic regions in Europe: Western Europe, including England; Mediterranean Europe; Central/Eastern Europe, with European Russia; and outer Northern Europe, reaching from Ireland, through Scotland to the Nordic countries. The differential importance of these regions is well documented by demographic trends from the Middle Ages to the present time, a point I will return to shortly. Other indicators of regional variations include the divergent development of their capital cities, a subject I discuss in detail elsewhere.2 After the Second World War the brilliant Fernand Braudel pioneered a regional approach in his study La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen à l’Epoque de Philippe II (1949). Though not specifically urban in focus, the work illuminated the complex urban links right across the Catholic and Islamic Mediterranean region. There are undoubtedly limitations in Braudel’s work, but what is particularly valuable is that his conception of the Mediterranean is not narrowly defined but open-ended, reaching out to the Middle East, North Africa, the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean. After Braudel, however, interest in a regional approach failed to gain traction, DOI: 10.4324/9781003346456-1\n\n2 Peter Clark whether in the Mediterranean or elsewhere: even Braudel turned to other subjects in later years.3 The neglect of a regional approach is especially serious in the case of Northern Europe. Though research on Northern cities has increased in the last two decades, there has been limited regional collaboration by urbanists in the field, with the first meeting of Nordic urban researchers in recent times only in 2019.4 Comparative studies of Northern urban development have been relatively few and far between.5 Though the first volume of the Cambridge History of Scandinavia has two important chapters on medieval towns, volume 2, on the period up to 1850, has no chapter and indeed virtually no references at all to towns. The yet-to-be-published volume 3 has no chapter devoted to modern Nordic cities.6 One consequence of this relative lack of regional research is that the urban North has been a historiographical black hole in the general European literature, largely ignored in surveys of the European city that have appeared since the 1980s. Jan De Vries in his seminal book European Urbanisation (1984) lumped the North together with Western Europe as an analytical category. Paul Hohenberg and Lynn Lees in The Making of Urban Europe (1985) has one reference to Scandinavia and none to Finland. Alex Cowan’s Urban Europe (1998) has no mention of Scandinavian cities at all. This is not just a case of Anglo-Saxon amnesia. The French literature on the North European city is hardly any better.7 In sum, the underdeveloped narrative of the Northern city is striking and has important implications for how European urbanisation is conceptualised. Lurking behind the lack of comparative regional research on the urban North are other major problems. First, there is the problematic definition and indeed conceptualisation of Norden, which has been largely determined by cultural and intellectual historians. Reviewing the literature, one is struck by the strong emphasis put on the external political and cultural determinants (such as the perception of the North from abroad) and by comparison the limited recognition given to the internal economic and particularly urban factors defining the concept of Northern regionality.8 Second, there is the general problem of defining urban regions: how coherent, how convergent, how autonomous need they be? This may be a particular issue on Europe’s urban periphery and will be discussed later. Third, and coming full circle, much of the research on Northern towns has had a strongly local or national focus. Here, as in other parts of Europe, divergent national research agendas seriously complicate wider comparative studies. In the detailed chapters of this book, the focus is on Northern urban development in the early modern and modern periods. But one cannot start there. Northern urban regionality has a long history dating back at least to the early Middle Ages, and in the following pages I want to outline that\n\nNorthern cities in European perspective 3 framework development which is critical to understanding modern and contemporary trends. As well as examining the Northern region over the longue durée, it is necessary, following Braudel’s Mediterranean model, to adopt an expansive, open-ended view of the urban North, centred on the Nordic countries but encompassing on its margins Ireland, Scotland, and possibly the Baltic states. Only by combining these two perspectives can one obtain a clearer understanding of the dynamic nature of the Northern city region. A first and fundamental task is to identify a taxonomy of the defining attributes of Northern urbanism. Contextually, this outer Northern region, was (and is) distinguished from the rest of the continent by its cold climate, its often difficult soil, its proximity to the sea, its sparsity of population. In other words, geophysical factors are vital for understanding the region’s urban narrative.9 In terms of urbanisation, one finds a distinct trajectory, compared to other European regions (see Figure 1.1). In the late Middle Ages, the North had very low urbanisation rates, at the bottom of the European spectrum, indicative of the low number and size of towns. In the early modern period, with many new town foundations, the Northern trend caught up with Eastern Europe. In the late 19th century, with increased industrialisation urban growth accelerated in the North and overtook the Mediterranean by the mid-20th century. In the late 20th\n\nFigure 1.1 Urban trends in large European regions, 1500–1990. Source: Based on data in Peter Clark, European Cities and Towns 400–2000 (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2009).\n\n4 Peter Clark century the trend stabilised with similar levels of urbanisation to Mediterranean and Eastern Europe.10 Framing this specific developmental trajectory was the distinctive and long-lasting architecture of the overall urban system across outer Northern Europe. First, without the legacy of Roman occupation, only a few towns were established before the 11th century: the majority were founded from the high or late Middle Ages into the early modern period – the 17th century was particularly formative in Ireland, Scotland, and Finland. This late development is in marked contrast, for example, to Western and Mediterranean Europe, where the vast number of towns had been founded before the Black Death in the 14th century.11 Second, it was an urban region of predominantly small towns. In Norway, in 1801, of the 30 towns only Bergen could claim a European status with 18,000 inhabitants. In 17thcentury Ireland, apart from Dublin and the major regional ports, many towns numbered only a few hundred inhabitants. In Scotland, in 1639, only 11 per cent of towns had more than 2,000 people, the rest much less. In the Swedish-Finnish kingdom during the 1770s, 93 per cent of towns had fewer than 5,000 inhabitants.12 As numerous chapters in this book demonstrate, small towns remain important in the region into the 20th century: Christian Ringskou looks at Skjern, a small Danish town in Western Jutland, over the years 1880–1930, analysing the social networking that underpinned community life, while Matti O. Hannikainen shows the significance of new small towns and townships for Finnish urbanisation after independence. In Norway, planning policy after 1924 sought to transform small towns, a major part of the urban system, into ‘minor utopias’ as Steinar Aas discusses in his chapter.13 Third, almost all the larger established towns were (and are) ports, often located on mouths of rivers giving access to the interior. A necklace of early port towns dominated the east coast of Scotland from Aberdeen to Edinburgh and its haven of Leith. In premodern Ireland, port cities like Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and Belfast served as regional centres, playing commercial second fiddle to the international port of Dublin. There was a similar pattern of important ports on the coasts of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. In the premodern period, larger Nordic port towns often acquired a royal monopoly of foreign commerce, leaving small ports or inland towns, mired by poor communications, with the bits and pieces of local trade. Strikingly, ports and coastal cities remain a dominant feature of the contemporary urban map of the region. In the Øresund Region around the Sound, the proximity of ports on the Swedish and Danish sides led to close historic interaction and rivalry, but globalisation and the opening of the Øresund Bridge have given the opportunity, as Henning Bro explains, to develop the area into a transnational Øresund metropolis.14\n\nNorthern cities in European perspective 5 A fourth feature of the outer Northern urban system was the important position of a handful of bigger cities, usually only one per country, mostly capitals. Even these were modest or small by European standards. In 1500, none figured among the bigger European cities. Sixteenth-century Edinburgh was scorned by foreign visitors as on the level of a French country town. In 1650, according to de Vries, Copenhagen had 23,000 inhabitants; Stockholm 40,000; Dublin 17,000; and Edinburgh 35,000. This compared to populations of 400,000 or more for London and Paris and 175,000 for Amsterdam.15 Into the early 19th century, Nordic capitals were hardly any more impressive. One British traveller to Stockholm in 1827 complained of the city’s main street being narrow, lined with miserable-looking shops; Copenhagen was hardly any better. Even at the start of the 2lst century, the Northern metropoles appear modest on a European, let alone a global, scale: none figured in the biggest 20 European urban agglomerations in 2020.16 Not only were Northern cities and towns predominantly small, but they shared other features into the modern period. In contrast to the many walled towns of the Mediterranean, and Western and to some extent Eastern Europe, they were mostly open towns. In the Swedish-Finnish kingdom only Stockholm, Kalmar, and Viiborg had walls. Turku had fences, reinforced by trenches, and Bergen in 1580 had wooden palisades.17 In Ireland, over 50 of the bigger centres boasted stone walls, but lesser towns made do with earthen embankments, hedges, or fences. Only the biggest older Scottish burghs had walls, other towns had ditches, fences, or nothing. The lack of stone walls was partly a function of their high cost and the poverty of many Northern towns, but it also reflected the weakness or absence of municipal government, as well as the limited perception of external threats. A recent study by Karin Sennefelt of migration into Stockholm in the decades before and after 1700 suggests that the relative permeability of the city and the lack of effective means of excluding outsiders created a different attitude and policy towards incomers than in mainland Europe: one concerned more with capacity to work than identity. There are various studies of European walled towns. More comparative research is needed on what forms of communal identity and policy were shaped by unwalled or open towns.18 The weakness (or absence) of civic self-governance in Northern towns in the premodern era is striking. After their conquest of medieval Ireland, the English kings sought to create a network of chartered boroughs to attract English settlers, but many of the small boroughs barely functioned as towns, and in some cases the burgesses never lived there. In the 17th century, the new towns founded in Ulster were handed over to local landowners who installed manorial not civic institutions.19 In Scotland, there\n\n6 Peter Clark were many chartered towns, but only some, usually the bigger ones, had privileges from the Crown, including monopolies of foreign trade; by 1707, there were 66 royal burghs, as against around 350 baronial burghs created after 1450, many short-lived, under noble or landowner control.20 In Scandinavia, town charters were widely used by kings to promote economic and political control. In Sweden, all the towns had royal charters, and the situation was similar in Denmark. In Norway, royal charters came later and more slowly: in 1801, just over half of towns were chartered.21 At the same time, municipal autonomy seems to have been limited. In the 17th-century, Swedish and Danish kings, both ruling militarised states, interfered extensively in the running and planning of urban communities while access to foreign trade was frequently regulated.22 Several of these themes are explored in Part I of this book. In her chapter Marianne Råberg discusses how Christian IV and Gustavus Adolphus sought to expand their capital cities with new town plans, plans for military facilities, and modern fortifications. Kasper Kepsu examines the Swedish new fortress town of Nyen on the Finnish-Russian border, which also developed as a trading centre. And Juha-Matti Granqvist and Sofia Gustafsson consider two more Swedish fortress towns established in Finland, 18th century-Helsinki-Sveaborg and Ruotsinsalmi, and their contribution to urbanisation.23 In a follow-up study, Jaime Montes Bentura discusses with reference to Stockholm and Umea how 17th-century state planning models in Sweden continue to influence modern urban development.24 External pressures on towns are also evident elsewhere in the Northern region. In Scotland, the baronial burghs were subject to seigneurial interference, though this may have diminished in the 17th century, and royal influence probably increased. In Ireland, corporate autonomy was undermined by the colonial context of the state and associated religious divisions within urban communities. Generally fundamental was the smallscale and economic and financial weakness of many of the towns of outer Northern Europe, their small elites overshadowed by the power of landowners and the Crown. Certainly, it is difficult to reconcile the limited role and autonomy of Northern burghers with the wide-ranging, dynamic picture of citizenship in premodern Europe presented by Maarten Prak in his important study Citizens Without Nations (2018), which focuses mainly on the big, prosperous ‘Blue Banana’ cities reaching from England through the Low Countries and western Germany to northern Italy. Prak hardly mentions Northern cities at all in his analysis.25 All this would suggest that townscape, political institutions, civic culture, and policymaking may well have been significantly different in the urban North into the 19th century compared to other European urban regions. In the modern period, one can identify similar shared trends in these areas, with Nordic cities in particular distinctive for their spatial compactness, their high levels of\n\nNorthern cities in European perspective 7 civic autonomy, and their municipal activism-points which are illustrated in subsequent chapters. As we know from a global perspective, regional urban development was always shaped by specific local factors, but it was also forged by shared common responses to structural contexts, such as we noted earlier, and by common problems. At the same time, we know regional urbanism was often influenced by interconnectivity and interaction between cities.26 And this is particularly evident in outer Northern Europe, facilitated by its proximity to the sea. Fundamentally, this was an urban system constructed on the shores of the North Atlantic, North Sea, and Baltic and one structured, as will be seen, by a great deal of maritime and human contact. Having set out some of the key identifiers of the urban North, I want to note some of the most important phases of interaction across the wider region. Once again, it is important to recognise the long pedigree of such interaction with modern developments erected on the shoulders of earlier exchanges and networking. While proto-urban trading centres probably existed earlier in parts of the region, the first establishment of meaningful towns owed much to the Vikings. From the eighth century a number of towns emerged in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Ireland, though not in Scotland. Fortunately, there is extensive research on towns in the Viking era, though because of the difficult, fragmented nature of the evidence little is conclusive. Whether Viking invaders brought existing notions of towns from Scandinavia to Ireland (perhaps mediated by Viking centres in Northern England) or whether Viking urban innovations in Ireland, as at Dublin, were transhipped northwards remains unsure. If raiding was an important ingredient of the early invasions, so too was long-distance trade (with links to the east, to the Volga, complementing those across the North Atlantic). Goods were exchanged around the region, along with culture, practices, and people. In Viking Ireland similarities between sites suggests a Hiberno-Norse town with common distinguishing features.27 From the 12th century, the outer Northern region was affected by state formation in Scandinavia and waves of external pressure from Western Europe. The English invasion of Ireland and the growing impact of German Hanseatic traders on Northern port cities had important consequences. Irish towns were colonised and rebuilt, and new ones established on the English model; and German merchants and traders came to dominate economic life in bigger Nordic and Baltic towns while they also sought to exclude competitors from Scotland and beyond.28 However, from the later Middle Ages political alliances between Scotland and Scandinavia served to facilitate the revival of urban interaction across the region. Benefitting from the decline of the Hanseatic League, trade between Scottish and Norwegian ports increasingly flourished with imports of timber exchanged for grain, salt, and other goods. From 1580 to 1625, a third of all ships arriving in Dundee came from Norway. At\n\n8 Peter Clark the end of the 16th century, Scottish trade with Swedish ports likewise expanded, imports of Swedish ore becoming vital for the Scottish iron industry.29 As Steve Murdoch and others have demonstrated, from the 16th century Scottish merchants became leading figures in Nordic towns, bringing capital and overseas trading networks to their new communities. In Norway, Trondheim was an important location where Scottish fish, timber, and iron merchants were based while Bergen had over 300 Scots; elsewhere in the Danish kingdom, Scots were important at Copenhagen and particularly Elsinore. In Sweden, Stockholm hosted around 350 resident Scots, some on the city council and in government posts. At Gothenburg, two of the 12 seats on the city council were reserved for Scots when the town was founded by the Swedish king in 1621, and this together with tax concessions attracted leading Scottish entrepreneurs whose families grew powerful in the town. Gothenburg’s Scottish magnates became prominent in the China trade of the East India Company founded there in 1731. Naturalised Scots embedded in Swedish state institutions exploited this to promote inter-urban commerce between their countries.30 Meanwhile, Scottish towns maintained close ties across the wider region to Irish urban development. A number of the towns established or re-established in Stuart Ireland were populated by Scots, with large inflows in the late 17th century, while the linen industry which developed in Ulster in the 18th century had links with Glasgow and other Scottish towns. The large-scale rebuilding of Dublin as an Enlightenment city from the end of the 17th century attracted Scottish artisans across the Irish sea (many Scottish towns at that time were in crisis) while Dublin’s classical-style terraces served as a model and inspiration for the construction of Edinburgh’s New Town from the 1780s.31 By the late 18th century, Edinburgh with its many learned societies, publishers, and intellectuals had become the leading cultural and intellectual centre in Northern Europe: the Athens of the North.32 In the 1760s, James Macpherson’s publication there of the poetry of the Gaelic writer Ossian, mostly famously the epic work Fingal, set off a literary and cultural explosion. Connecting with the drama of the wild and harsh landscape of the North, the poetry, despite being dogged by doubt and controversy, sparked powerful interest in all the countries bordering the North Sea (and beyond). Already from the late 17th century there had been growing antiquarian and literary interest in ancient Nordic literature, but enthusiasm for Ossian took off from the 1770s, notably in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Turku, Copenhagen, and in Iceland (mostly Reykjavik). Interest also crossed the Irish Sea to Dublin. In 1781, the Swedish poet Thomas Thorild wrote for the Stockholm literary society a poem with the lines: OSSIAN, king of the Bards! before whom nature stands obedient Ah! before whom Homer disappears and Voltaire is as nothing!\n\nNorthern cities in European perspective 9 Into the early 19th century, interest in Ossian helped fuel enthusiasm amongst the Northern urban literati for ancient languages, including Finnish language and culture, contributing probably to the publication of Kalevala. For others, Ossian encouraged attention to the close historical and cultural relationship between the Ancient Celtic peoples of the British Isles and those of Scandinavia.33 Yet in some ways, this marked the high-water mark of interaction across the urban region. During the 19th century, connectivity amongst the cities of outer Northern Europe continued but at a lower ebb. Rather, the region was overshadowed by external forces and undermined by internal tensions and contradictions. The rapid economic and urban growth of Western Europe, combined with large-scale state formation had major disruptive effects. Cities of both Scotland and to a much lesser extent Ireland were sucked into the dynamic world of an expansive British imperium. Ports and manufacturing towns were increasingly geared to global and colonial trade, and Glasgow proclaimed itself the Second City of the Empire. At the end of the Napoleonic wars, Britain and its European allies got Denmark to cede Norway and its urban network to Sweden, despite Norwegian demands for independence, while another Coalition ally, the Russian Empire, secured Finland from Sweden in 1809 and soon after imposed a new capital city, Helsinki, on its new grand duchy. Subsequently, Denmark faced growing pressure from a resurgent Germany, led by Prussia, which annexed Danish provinces and cities after the Schleswig-Holstein war in 1864 and reasserted its economic power in the Baltic, evinced by the rise of Hamburg, Bremen, and other North German ports. All this contributed to fragmentation across the regional urban network.34 At the same time, foreign pressures encouraged the growth of Scandinavianism in Nordic university towns such as Lund, Copenhagen, Uppsala, Helsinki, and Christiana (Oslo) in the 1830s and 1840s, with calls for a Nordic union against Germanism, though the German victory in 1864 dampened pan-Nordic enthusiasm for a while.35 Yet by the end of the 19th century, one can identify indications of a new parallelism, convergence, and interconnectivity in the Northern region, especially in the Nordic core. A precondition was strong urban growth, as we noted earlier, linked to manufacturing expansion and agricultural transformation. Particularly striking was the rapid population increase of the Nordic capital cities: by 1910/1911 Copenhagen had 559,000; Stockholm 342,000; Helsinki 147,000; and Oslo 243,000. While there was accelerating urban and economic parallelism or convergence across the Nordic region before 1914, the extent of economic integration seems more problematic, as the big economies of Western Europe increasingly dominated trade.36 However, focusing on cultural developments, one can identify more connectivity between Nordic cities, as those major urban triggers of competition and emulation came into play. From the 1890s, the National\n\n10 Peter Clark Romantic Movement left a distinctive imprint on the urban landscape of public buildings in Finland, Sweden, and Denmark (more so than elsewhere in Europe), and after 1910, this in turn gave way to the advent of Nordic Classicism exemplified by the Stockholm City Library, the Finnish Parliament House, and the Copenhagen Police Headquarters. In the same way, Ebenezer Howard’s British Garden City movement created suburban developments across the region but mediated by a distinctive Nordic style, usually with wooden houses, just as allotment gardens (with cabins for overnight stays) spread from Danish cities to Stockholm, and so to Finnish cities like Helsinki. While innovations often originated from outside the region, they were adapted, even transformed inside it. The Nordic adaptation of urban architecture and planning developments is particularly evident in the spread of the Functionalist variant of International Modernism before and after the Second World War. By this time there was active networking among Nordic architects and landscape designers.37 Institutional links between Nordic cities were increasingly strong by the interwar period. As Laura Kolbe shows in her chapter (Chapter 15), the decades before the First World War saw the establishment of Unions of cities in Denmark, Sweden (1908), Finland (2012), and Norway as elsewhere in Europe. The Finnish union rules privileged international cooperation, and during the war there was growing informal contact involving members of the Nordic unions. From the 1920s, formal joint meetings were held. In 1920, the Finnish meeting in Turku invited delegates from Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, and this was followed by Finnish visits to Norway. Thereafter, Nordic gatherings of city representatives were increasingly regular and were extended to include Baltic cities. Meetings were used to promote good governance and showcase industrial development and other innovative developments in Nordic towns. Delegations coming to Helsinki were taken to visit allotment garden areas and the Käpylä garden suburb.38 After the Second World War inter-urban links were solidified by other Nordic organisations such as Helsingfors Tjänstebröder, which was established in 1948 as a forum for cooperation between officials in the Nordic capitals and other big cities. More recently, there have been conferences of Nordic capitals.39 Contact and emulation between Nordic cities led to urban improvements as in sanitation before 1900 as Mikkel Thelle notes in his chapter (Chapter 8). In the same way Marjatta Hietala (Chapter 14) details how Nordic city contact and cooperation promoted urban creativity in the 20th century.40 Other joint activities, often based in Nordic capitals, involved sports organisations, trade unions, temperance organisations, and social policymakers. In 1952, the Nordic Council was established but inter-urban cooperation has been uneven.41 The late 20th century saw growing Nordic convergence in a number of areas, particularly social welfare and health as\n\nNorthern cities in European perspective 11 Rolf Hugoson outlines in his chapter on Nordic hospitals (Chapter 11).42 However, to return to the point raised earlier about the nature of urban regionality, it would seem that collaboration, emulation, and convergence between cities (and states) were always complicated by competitive tensions. What about the rest of the wider urban North? Whilst Scottish cities throve in the Victorian era from their integration into British global commerce and industry, Irish towns generally stagnated except for Belfast and other Ulster towns which prospered from exports of the linen manufacture and later shipbuilding and engineering industries. The Irish famine in 1848 drove many rural and small-town Irish to migrate to Scottish cities, creating there large ethnic and religious enclaves. Irish urbanisation continued to stagnate after independence from Britain in 1922 due to political uncertainty, protectionism, and high emigration.43 However, benefitting from the European Community, from the 1980s Dublin and the bigger cities of the Republic grew strongly as centres of new style tech and service industries – not unlike those found in Nordic cities in the later 20th century.44 In contrast, Scottish cities from the 1960s were adversely affected, as in England, by the decay of heavy industry and the loss of traditional markets. But recently links with Scandinavia, through the energy industry and European Union-sponsored educational and research cooperation, proved significant in reversing the trend. By the time of Brexit (2016), Norway had returned to being one of Scotland’s main trading partners while thousands of Nordic and Irish students attended Scottish urban universities. In 2007, the thenScottish chief minister talked of a new Arc of Prosperity linking Ireland, Scotland, and the Nordic states, in which their cities had become leading players. It remains to be seen if this Arc can be turned into increased interurban reality.45 In the contemporary world the urban North faces a number of major challenges, linked in part to those systemic or structural issues discussed earlier. First, the systemic small size of many Northern towns makes them highly vulnerable to declining birth rates, and many outside metropolitan areas are seeing population decline. Here foreign immigration, as Lars Nilsson shows in a wide-ranging chapter on Swedish urbanisation, offers one of the opportunities for stabilisation.46 Heritage tourism also presents economic possibilities as Anna Elmén Berg and Jennie Sjöholm explain in their account of Swedish Arctic towns.47 Second, though Northern capitals continue to dominate national networks, comprising up to a quarter of national populations, their modest size on the European stage, and indeed status as veritable pigmies in world rankings, often pushes them to the margins of the global urban system, with small numbers of international company headquarters located there.48 This raises a third structural issue: the pressure of living on the doorstep of Western Europe with its assertive\n\n12 Peter Clark states and powerful economies and corporations, too often dominating European policymaking. Finally, there is the recurrent challenge of competition between Northern cities, particularly metropolitan centres. Nonetheless, such challenges also offer important opportunities for the urban North. Urban smallness on a global scale may allow space for flexibility and innovation, indeed creativity. The comfortable compactness of most Northern capitals helps explain their high standing in the global liveability, happiness, and sustainable city rankings.49 Proximity to Western Europe offers advantages of economic networking and integration with leading global players while urban competition frequently (albeit not invariably) leads to inter-urban cooperation. In conclusion, there is a strong case for regarding the urban North as one of the major urban regions of the continent. Shared features of this Northern system with its late town foundations, its late urbanisation, and its specific urban hierarchy of small towns, ports, and dominant but modest-sized metropoles are quite distinctive in a European, indeed in a global, context. But this Northern system was never static. As has been evident, it expanded and contracted over time. Still there was important interconnectivity between cities across the region of outer Northern Europe. One final remark. Clearly, more sustained comparative research is needed on the urban North, and doubtless this book will serve as an important step towards our better understanding and recognition of the Northern city in a European perspective.
