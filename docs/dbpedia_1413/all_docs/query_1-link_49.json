        "text": "On January 12, 2023 in Glasgow, Montana, Carmen Ware (Carmen Dalene Willard) passed away with her children and her two youngest grandchildren by her side. Carmen led her family to believe in eternal life with her Lord and Savior and they rest in the assurance that they will be with her again. From her earliest days, Carmen gained the love of everyone who met her. Carmen’s life was blessed with adventures and a strong bond of family.\n\nCarmen Dalene Willard was born on November 22, 1935 to Myrtle Priscilla Vanderpan Willard and Robert Charles Willard. Carmen was the first of four children. Her brother’s Bud (Robert), Larry and Alan joined the family. As the only girl in the family, it was Carmen’s job to keep the boys in line. The brothers in return have been her best friends and protectors throughout her life. Some of her favorite times were at the Willard Campground reunions at Bud’s place in Columbia Falls.\n\nShe lived her early years near Madoc, Montana, where she attended school. Later, she attended and graduated from Scobey Schools (SHS 1953). She was active in school, which included cheerleading and had many close friends. After high school, Carmen attended Eastern Montana College in Billings. She returned home to Scobey and married Ronald Marlenee. Together, Ronald and Carmen had five children, David, Michael, Sheila, Casey and Allison. The first born son, David, passed away at nine months of age from a congenital heart condition. In 1976, tragedy struck again as her second born son Michael was injured in a tragic swimming accident leaving him paralyzed. After rehabilitation, Michael was attending Montana State University when the chains of his wheelchair lift broke and he stuck his head passing a few days later. Carmen persevered through the adversity and sadness keeping her children at the forefront of her life. Carmen and her first husband were married 25 years and divorced in 1979.\n\nIn April of 1981, Carmen married Walter Ware of Scobey. Carmen gained three stepchildren, Audrey, David and Susan. Family continued to be her priority as she embraced the blended family. Walter’s daughter, Audrey, passed away in 2003.\n\nCarmen and Walter traveled often in their Airstream to visit children and have adventures to the East Coast, Arizona and Alaska. Some of their favorite adventures, though, were spent at Bud’s place with family and friends enjoying time together.\n\nCarmen was preceded in death by her mother, Myrtle, her father Robert (Grandpa Bob), her infant son, David, her son Michael, stepdaughter Audrey, grandson Jacob Wolff and great grandson, Ryder Wolff. She is survived by her loving husband, Walter, her brothers Bud (Alice) of Columbia Falls, Larry (Bonita) of Bozeman, Alan (Teri) of Lewistown; children Sheila (Dennis) Wolff of Billings, Casey (Pam) Marlenee of Boise, Idaho, Allison (Pete) Helland of Glasgow; stepchildren David (Holly) Ware of Billings, and Susan (Brian) Fennern of Aiken, Minnesota. She is also survived by twenty grandchildren and twenty-four great grandchildren. Carmen’s passion and life were her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.\n\nThere is a Celebration of Life at the Bell Mortuary on Sunday, January 15, 2023 at 1:00 p.m. The family will gather in Scobey in the spring as it was her wish to be cremated and her ashes spread."
