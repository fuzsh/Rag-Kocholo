        "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nApril 24, 2023\n\nContact: press@mtgop.org\n\nHELENA, Mont. – Montana Republican Party Chairman Don “K” Kaltschmidt issued the following statement after today’s events in the Montana House gallery:\n\n“Violence has no place in our political process. The far-left disruption at Montana’s Capitol today was a direct result of extremist rhetoric promoted by a few select legislators and their allies in the media,” Chairman Kaltschmidt said.\n\n“The Montana Republican Party will not be intimidated by the behaviors of a few hateful agitators. We are committed to civil discourse, law and order, and protecting the safety of the public and strongly condemn the riot at the Montana Capitol today. I want to thank our brave law enforcement officers for quickly restoring order. Montana Republicans will continue to pass laws that benefit the people of Montana and defend the values they were elected to preserve.”\n\n###\n\nFOR RELEASE\n\nApril 7, 2022\n\nContact: alden@mtgop.org\n\nHELENA, Mont. – Yesterday, liberal activist judge Michael Moses blocked 4 common sense election integrity laws passed by the Montana Legislature from going into effect. In response to Judge Moses’s ludicrous decision, Montana Republican Party Chairman Don “K” Kaltschmidt released the following statement:\n\n“Judge Moses’s decision to block multiple election integrity laws passed by the Montana Legislature that make it easier to vote and harder to cheat is nothing but a clear example of far-left judicial activism,” Chairman Kaltschmidt said. “The Montana Legislature was elected by the people of Montana, and is held accountable by the people of Montana. The people spoke in 2020 by electing Republicans by historic margins with a promise to pass election security measures and the idea that a liberal judge can strike down common sense election laws in order to help his own political party is unacceptable.”\n\nSeveral other Republican elected officials issued statements criticizing Moses’s decision.\n\nMontana Secretary of State Cristi Jacobsen decried the ruling saying the decision “defies Montana’s common-sense approach to running our election” and vowed to “immediately appeal the decision because Montana’s election laws are under attack.”\n\nMontana Senate President Mark Blasdel also blasted the decision saying, “To block multiple well-crafted election integrity laws barely a month before ballots go out is judicial activism at its worst. It’s no surprise that a liberal judge appointed by Democratic governors ruled in favor of his political allies instead of Montanans who support voter ID and secure elections.”\n\nJudge Moses was appointed by Liberal Democrat Governor Bullock in 2014 before losing when running for a full term. After losing his race, Moses was once again appointed to the court by Bullock in 2016.\n\n###\n\nThe Fake News media is now covering up Governor Bullock’s flip-flop on the Keystone XL pipeline – claiming he supports this project!\n\nFALSE: “Just like during his long-shot presidential bid, Bullock is touting his bipartisan record … showing support for the Keystone pipeline which crosses the state.”\n\nLet’s take a quick trip down memory lane…\n\nBack in 2013, Governor Bullock did send a letter to President Obama writing to express his “strong support for the Keystone XL Pipeline project” and gave himself a pat on the back to union leaders that he was “on board early behind the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.”\n\nBut, much has changed since then.\n\nIn his disastrous run for president last year, Both Ways Bullock flipped on Keystone! During a CNN town hall, Governor Bullock said he’s ‘not comfortable’ with the Keystone XL, and ‘a lot’ would need be done before he would support it.\n\nSo, while the Fake News may want to provide cover for Bullock, the facts make clear that he flipped on this job-creating project and now opposes it.\n\nBullock doesn’t get to have it both ways. Make no mistake – if Bullock becomes Montana’s next U.S. Senator, he’ll be voting right with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi in opposing this critical jobs project that ensures greater North American energy independence.\n\nOn Friday, Senator Tester threw Tara Reade’s credible sexual harassment and assault allegations against Joe Biden to the wind when he endorsed the former Vice President’s campaign for President.\n\nTester – who had “deep concerns” about Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations against Justice Kavanaugh – joins others in his party setting a hypocritical standard of believing women only when politically expedient.\n\nGovernor Bullock is also one of them. He came to Biden’s defense on the Reade allegations, praising the serious manner in which Biden addressed them and for delivering on transparency – neither of which is true.\n\nMoreover, Bullock set a much different standard in 2018 – when he called to “do an investigation as we should” for women who have “sacrificed themselves” by bringing credible claims forward.\n\nThis isn’t Bullock’s first #MeToo flounder. He once failed to warn a future employer of a political advisor’s history of sexual harassment because he thought he would stop harassing women. This staffer was then forced out of his new job due to sexual harassment allegations.\n\nWhat do Governor Bullock and Senator Tester have to say about the troubling, hypocritical message they are sending to women who are victims of sexual assault and harassment? It appears they only believe or defend women when it serves the interests of their own flock.\n\nThe Montana Republican Party joins the Treasure State in celebrating the life of Ron Marlenee, former Montana Congressman in the United States House of Representatives and Montana’s longest serving Republican Congressman, who passed this weekend.\n\nMTGOP Chairman Don “K” Kaltschmidt shared the following statement upon the news of Congressman Marlenee’s passing:\n\n“Ron Marlenee was an incredible Montanan and an even better man. When Ron was elected to Congress in 1977, he was the lone Republican representing Montana in Congress and only one of two Republicans representing Montana in senior state and federal positions. He always stood for the common man, advocating in Congress for agriculture and property owners and pushing for Republican values of less government, lower taxes, and more freedoms.”\n\n“Ron loved Montana with all of his heart and those that were close to him knew just how deeply he cared for Montana’s outdoors where he could spend time hunting, fishing and skiing throughout the state. My wife and I, along with the entire team at the Montana Republican Party, send our prayers and thoughts to the Marlenee family as they remember their husband, father, grandfather, and this great Montanan.”\n\nHelena, Montana – The Montana Republican Party today released a new online video highlighting the real reason Gov. Steve Bullock is reported to enter Montana’s U.S. Senate race.\n\nAfter private meetings with Obama and Schumer, Gov. Bullock bowed to their demands and all signs now point towards a pending Senate announcement in the coming days. This comes despite repeated, adamant denials about a Senate run, and his clear articulation that he wasn’t interested, nor would he find it compelling to be a U.S. Senator.\n\nClick HERE to watch the video\n\n“Montanans have seen this song and dance before – the Democrat elite meddling in our elections in an attempt to buy our U.S. Senate seat. Gov. Bullock’s abrupt reversal came immediately following private meetings with Obama and Schumer. It proves Bullock stands with them and is loyal to their wishes–not Montanans. We won’t let Bullock-Obama-Schumer steal this election.”\n\nBackground:\n\nMontana Free Press: “I’ve expressed all along [that] I just don’t have an interest in running for U.S. Senate,” Bullock told the Montana Lowdown Podcast in March. “I think that my skill set, and what I’ve done, I just wouldn’t enjoy it, so I’d ruled it out.”\n\nMontana Standard: “Candidly, I just don’t know if I would find being a senator that compelling.”\n\nMSNBC: Bullock: “I was never going to run for the Senate… this is something that never really got me excited.’”\n\nAP: “I’ve said before, during and after that I’m not going to be running for Senate,” Bullock said. “I’ve made that clear, that’s just not what I want to do.”\n\nKTVQ: Report: Bullock meets privately with Obama in D.C.\n\nGreat Falls Tribune: Schumer tries to get Bullock to run for Senate\n\nHELENA – The Montana Republican Party Chairman Don “K” Kaltschmidt released the following statement after Montana Democrat candidates for Governor and U.S. Senate debated in Bozeman:\n\n“Tonight’s debates between Montana Democrat candidates showcased nothing more than their inability to represent us and our Montana values in Helena or the U.S. Senate. While Democrat Senate candidates continue their race to the left and the never-ending crusade against President Trump, we look forward to supporting Senator Steve Daines and his commitment to our Second Amendment Rights and outdoor heritage, as well as his record of support for constitutional judges, secure borders, and lower taxes.\n\nMontanans are looking for this record of success in Montana’s next Executive. And tonight we heard loud and clear that the Democrats’ solution to the problems facing Montana is increased spending and higher taxes on hardworking Montanans. After years of higher tax proposals, bloated government agencies, and an aversion to fiscal sanity in Helena, Montanans are ready for a Republican in the Governor’s office and a more prosperous future.”\n\n####\n\nHELENA – The Montana Republican Party Chairman Don “K” Kaltschmidt released the following statement after House Democrats voted to impeach President Trump for winning the 2016 Presidential election:\n\n“While today’s vote marks the third time in our history that Congress impeached a sitting President, it is the first time that a President’s only crime was winning an election” said Chairman Don “K” Kaltschmidt. “Democrats’ obsession with impeachment started the day after the 2016 election, and Montanans know the House Democrats’ manufactured effort to remove our President is just another attempt to rob Montanans of an opportunity to proudly cast their votes in favor of his reelection. Today’s embarrassing vote is yet another reminder of why Montanans need to reelect a Conservative to Montana’s Congressional seat and retire Nancy Pelosi as Speaker.\n\n####\n\nHELENA – The Montana Republican Party endorsed United States Senator Steve Daines’ (R-MT) reelection campaign during an Executive Board meeting on Tuesday.\n\nMontana Republican Party Chairman, Don “K” Kaltschmidt, released the following statement after the Party invoked RNC Rule No. 11 to support Senator Daines’ reelection effort:\n\n“Since serving in the U.S. Senate, Senator Steve Daines has been a strong voice for Montana and worked closely with President Trump to protect our Montana values,” said Chairman Don “K” Katlschmidt. “The Montana Republican Party is extremely proud to endorse his re-election because of his unwavering support to protect our Second Amendment Rights and outdoor heritage, confirm constitutional judges, cut taxes and create jobs, and secure our borders. We are grateful to have him represent our Montana way of life and know he will continue to work with President Trump to Keep America Great!”\n\n###\n\nHELENA – The Montana Republican Party endorsed five candidates for City Council Races in Billings on Wednesday following special interest group attempts to elect radically liberal candidates. Chairman Don “K” Kaltschmidt released the following statement in support of candidates John Armstrong (Ward 1), Incumbent Roy Neese (Ward 2), Aldo Rowe (Ward 3), Pam Purinton (Ward 4), and Mike Boyette (Ward 5):\n\n“With election day only days away and Democrat Socialists on the ballot it is important that we stand up for fiscal responsibility and strong advocates for Billings,” said Kaltschmidt. “That is why the MTGOP is announcing its support for candidates that will keep Billings safe, balance the city budget, and say no to higher taxes. John, Roy, Aldo, Pam and Mike will always work for their neighbors and stand up for Billings Values.”\n\nThe Montana Republican Party communicated endorsements with a call to voters from Chairman Don “K” and a significant independent expenditure in local media urging Billings residents to support balanced budgets and lower taxes.\n\nToday the United States House of Representatives voted on a hyper-partisan resolution for the first time in an effort to formalize a witch-hunt into President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Montana Republican Party strongly opposes the secretive and illegitimate process leading up to this resolution and believes the closed-door impeachment proceedings deny the President the due process rendered to every American.\n\nAll Montanans deserve to know how candidates for Montana’s at-large Congressional seat would vote should he or she be Montana’s lone voice in the House of Representatives. And while Democrat candidate Rep. Tom Winter (HD-96 ) openly supports impeaching the President, former state Representative and Democrat candidate Kathleen Williams remains silent amidst this partisan effort:\n\nThis resolution was introduced nearly one month after Speaker Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry into the President and represents the only time the full House will vote on the matter.\n\nThe resolution gives Democrats complete authority over witnesses and subpoenas as Chairman Adam Schiff will be capable of declining any witness or subpoena issued by the Minority Ranking Member.\n\nMontanans need to know if Kathleen Williams agrees with Mr. Winter and would side with Nancy Pelosi and Radical Democrats in moving forward with the witch-hunt, or whether she would oppose this charade and get back to work on behalf of Montanans and the rest of the American people. This question must be asked."
