        "text": "HASWELL, Chief Justice.\n\nThis is an original application for a writ of supervisory control or alternatively for a writ of review seeking reversal of a District Court order dissolving a marriage. We ordered briefs filed and the application is now before us for determination.\n\nThe underlying action to which this application relates is cause number 3096 in the District Court of Daniels County entitled \"In re: The Marriage of Carmen D. Marlenee, Petitioner, and Ronald C. Marlenee, Respondent.\" In that action the wife sought a dissolution of the marriage, custody of the minor children of the parties, and a division of the marital property whereby she would receive the husband's equity in the farm and ranch real estate, machinery and cattle, and the residence and furniture in Scobey in lieu of child support and the husband would receive all other property of the parties including a chalet.\n\nThe husband filed a response in that action admitting the marriage was irretrievably broken; admitting that the wife was a fit person for custody of the minor children and that the children's best interests would be served by awarding their custody to the wife; denying that he was not a fit and proper person for the custody of the children as alleged by the wife; denying that the property division sought by the wife is equitable; and seeking an equitable division of the marital property.\n\nDuring the course of proceedings the deposition of the husband was taken and various motions were filed by the parties.\n\nOn November 9, 1978 the district judge set all pending motions for hearing in Wolf Point, Roosevelt County, Montana on November 21. Roosevelt County is in the same judicial district (the 15th) as Daniels County; the presiding district judge was the district judge of the entire fifteenth judicial district. The time and place where the motions would be heard was for the accommodation of counsel. Both counsel orally stipulated to the time and place of hearing and that the matter would be deemed to have been heard in Daniels County.\n\nThe order was subsequently vacated because of a conflict involving the wife's counsel. On November 22 an order was entered setting the hearing on dissolution of the marriage and all pending matters for November 28 in Sidney, Richland County, Montana outside the fifteenth judicial district but before the same presiding judge of the fifteenth judicial district.\n\nThe hearing was held as scheduled in Sidney, Richland County, Montana. Neither of the parties personally appeared. No objections to the time and place of hearing appear in the record of the hearing.\n\nOn November 29, the presiding judge entered an order (1) granting the husband's motion for judgment on the pleadings on the divorce issue and declaring the marriage dissolved, (2) reserving division of the marital property for a later hearing and determination, and (3) ordering the parties not to transfer, dispose or encumber the property except in the usual course of business or for the necessities of life. No findings of fact or conclusions of law were made or issued, nor was any determination made on custody of the minor children.\n\nIn the application for a writ of supervisory control or a writ of review now before this Court, the wife seeks to vacate and set aside the decree dissolving the marriage. She lists two legal issues for review : (1) whether the District Court can grant a divorce without a hearing where both parties have alleged that the marriage is irretrievably broken; (2) whether a divorce can be granted by a judge outside the district in which he is authorized to act.\n\nWe accept jurisdiction to review these issues by writ of supervisory control. We are empowered to do so by Article VII, Section 2(1) granting us \" original jurisdiction to issue, hear, and determine writs of habeas corpus and such other writs as may be provided by law\", and by Article VII, Section 2(2) granting this Court \"general supervisory control over all other courts\". The writ of supervisory control has been a part of the law of this state for over 50 years. State ex rel. Rubin v. District Court et al. ( ), 62 Mont. 60, 203 P. 860; State ex rel. Heinze v. District Court etc. ( ), 32 Mont. 579, 81 P. 345.\n\nWe consider this a proper case for a writ of supervisory control because relator wife has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law by appeal. Rule 54(b), M.R.Civ.P. provides:\n\n\"(b) Judgment Upon Multiple Claims or Involving Multiple Parties. When multiple claims for relief or multiple parties are involved in an action, the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates less than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of less than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order or (any) other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\""
