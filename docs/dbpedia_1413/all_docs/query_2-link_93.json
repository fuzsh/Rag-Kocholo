        "text": "Leading lawmakers from both houses of Congress today introduced legislation to make public almost everything in Government files on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.\n\nRepresentative Louis Stokes, the Ohio Democrat who headed the House investigation into the killing in the late 1970's, said the measure was supported by Congressional leaders and had no discernible opposition. \"This resolution is going to sail through,\" he predicted.\n\nSenator David L. Boren, the Oklahoma Democrat who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he had been assured of cooperation by the directors of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He predicted that \"99.999999999 percent of the documents\" in Government files would be fully released.\n\nUnder the legislation, a five-member commission would be appointed by Federal judges to rule on whether information could be deleted or withheld. None of the panel members could be Government employees or have been involved with previous investigations of the assassinations. 2 Years for Disclosure\n\nThe commission would have two years to see to the release of files from the House Assassinations Committee, the Warren Commission and any material held by other Government agencies. The bill urges Russian authorities to make public information in the files of the defunct K.G.B. and the G.R.U., domestic and military intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe only grounds allowed for continued secrecy would be to protect personnel records of previous investigations, cases in which a current intelligence agent or informer's identity would be disclosed, where a current intelligence gathering method would be compromised, and where there would be a severe invasion of privacy of a living person. Some details of the autopsy of President Kennedy would also be kept from public display, Mr. Boren said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
