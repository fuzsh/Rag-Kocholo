Tamme’s successful leadership of projects of all shapes and sizes, as well as her comprehensive experience means, that Tamme is well versed in multiple methodologies, bringing valuable perspective to Peak Insight clients, while producing customized research results.\n\nTamme is a University of Illinois at Chicago graduate, with a B.S. in Marketing. She lives in the South Loop neighborhood of Chicago with her husband and cat, and works hard to better her corner of the world through volunteer work.\n\nUnivision is the leading multimedia company serving Hispanic Americans, and they rely on Peak Insights for research to gain deeper understanding of the values and drivers impacting Hispanic voting behavior, preferences and decision-making.\n\nImmigration policy is an issue we’ve polled on extensively for numerous campaigns and IEs in states such as Florida, Texas, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Arizona – and with GROW Elect, a political organization dedicated to electing Latino Republicans in California.\n\nSpecifically, in Florida races, we know how to differentiate between key groups like Cubans and Puerto Ricans. This requires a recognition that all Hispanic voters are not and cannot be treated the same in campaign communications, and we take a deeper dive to identify what works with each unique subset of Hispanic voters.\n\nAdditionally, we collaborated with a group of GOP pollsters on a national project for FWD.us including focus groups and a national voter study that focused on Hispanic voters specifically, to help determine where America really stands on immigration policy.\n\nMortgage Lending with the Community in Mind\n\nAs a company experiencing a tremendous rate of growth and ready to take the next step in expansion, Hometown Lenders wanted to understand what kind of company homebuyers wants to work with and wanted to explain to people that being a member of a community is of the upmost importance to them. Before moving ahead with a high cost ad campaign, Hometown Lenders worked with Peak Insights to determine which of their creative ideas made the biggest impressions, were the most memorable, most effective and earned the most positive reactions. It may sound as though these are all similar measurements, but ad testing illuminates the nuances of marketing creative – for example, an ad that is memorable, may be memorable for the wrong reasons. We were also able to evaluate each ad for clarity of message and determine, that for mortgage lenders ads, the devil can be in the details.\n\nCoalition for Enhanced Marine Resources\n\nTime and time again, clients who want to inform public opinion turn to Peak Insights. In 2019, we worked with a consortium of oil and gas and industry clients to advance the “Rigs to Reef” program in California. By polling both statewide and in Santa Barbara County, we were able to illuminate a messaging pathway for the oil and gas industry to move ahead with plans for the Rigs to Reef program that would provide enhanced marine environment and fish habitat, additional recreational and commercial fishing, and a cost savings for oil and gas companies through the re-use and re-imaging of oil platforms. Our messaging was able to increase support for the program among groups who are not traditional oil and gas industry enthusiasts, including women, younger voters, non-Anglos and Liberals. We were also successful in moving the less informed and those who were undecided, toward support of the program.\n\nWashington I-1631 was a statewide initiative proposed in 2018 that would have established the nation’s first “carbon tax” on greenhouse gas emissions. The “yes” side coalition was formidable, comprised of a laundry list of high-profile environmental groups, labor unions and tribal organizations. Proponents had a lot of things going for them, including solid resources (over $15M) and an electorate that is highly environmentally sensitive and eager to address climate change in the form of public policy. Washington is a deeply blue state, dominated by the Seattle DMA which covers roughly 60% of the state. Peak Insights was hired as lead pollster for the “No on 1631” campaign, headed by the Western States Petroleum Association.\n\nOur initial statewide voter survey showed majority support for I-1631, which was clearly benefitting from favorable ballot language, fawning media coverage and the promise of funding going to a slew of special interest groups. The poll also revealed that one of the major challenges facing the No on 1631 campaign was in how to “frame” the debate – was it a “pollution fee” on big industry designed to reduce carbon emissions and move the state toward clean energy, or was it a poorly designed, unfair “energy tax” that would ultimately be passed on to consumers and hurt those who could least afford it? Through our comprehensive research program, which included in-person focus groups, online ad testing, multiple message refinement surveys and an extensive nightly tracking program, Peak Insights was able to guide the No on 1631 campaign to victory by helping to successfully frame the debate, develop key messages to specific target audiences, and identify the most effective messengers to deliver those messages.\n\nAs is often the case with partisan-driven issues like climate change, the “swing” voters in this campaign were made up largely of unaffiliated/Independent voters. This group also tended to fit the description of “cord-cutters” – voters who don’t typically rely on traditional media for news about politics and issues. Our polling, in conjunction with the modeling data, provided a clear path to connecting with these voters. This group had more macro-level than micro-level concerns and, as a result, responded favorably to communications that provided a broad summary of the negative impacts of I-1631. The notion that I-1631 would create a financial burden on individuals and families through higher gas prices and rising energy costs, without a guarantee of meaningful reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, was a compelling argument for this swing audience.\n\nCredibility of message and messenger was critical in defeating I-1631 and our research shaped the narrative and delivery from start to finish. We worked closely with the analytics and modeling teams to ensure that the right messages were delivered to the right audiences, through the right mediums and at the right time.\n\nMontana was one of several states in 2018 that faced statewide ballot questions seeking to fund Medicaid expansion, post-Obamacare. Initiative 185 would have paid for Medicaid expansion through increased tobacco taxes, raising the tax on a pack of cigarettes from $1.70 to $3.70, the third highest rate of any state in the nation, and an 83% tax hike on electronic cigarettes. While promising funding for a laundry list of “certain health-related programs,” I-185 was essentially an unfunded mandate that would tax a declining revenue source and leave Montana taxpayers on the hook for future tax increases. Peak Insights provided a comprehensive research program, including extensive quantitative and qualitative research, which helped develop a highly targeted message strategy to defeat this costly proposal.\n\nI-185 was ultimately defeated, 53-47%.\n\nIn what was labeled a “toss up” race by the DC media insiders, Peak Insights once again helped incumbent Senator Susan Collins win in a challenging political environment in Maine. Peak polled for Collins in her first campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1996 and has been with her ever since. Maine is a state where Independents make up a plurality of the electorate and appealing to that audience is critical to statewide success. Over the years we have devoted a great deal of time and energy to analyzing these voters and the messages and approaches that best appeal to them. Every campaign is different and the issues that voters care about can change, but Collins has always been able to carry this key voting group by large margins, including her victory in the 2020 General, where she beat opponent Sara Gideon by almost 9 points – despite the Cook Political Report calling the race a toss up as late as October 29th and being vastly outspent.\n\nIncumbent Senator Steve Daines “can’t imagine running an election without Peak Insights,” and his successful 2020 re-election was no exception. In a race labeled by the Cook Political Report as a “toss up,” Peak helped Daines win a decisive victory over Governor Steve Bullock in the most expensive and closely watched race in Montana history. Montana has been reliably Republican at the presidential level but has elected several Democrats statewide, including Governor Steve Bullock, who had record breaking amounts of money streaming in from out of state. But even before the race was called a toss-up, Peak Insights and the Daines campaign were hard at work, conducting a comprehensive polling and research plan, looking at the race from all angles in order to make sure the voters of Montana knew exactly where the candidates stood on issues important to Montanans. And on Election Day, the Daines campaign knew where they stood, no matter what the public polls said, because they were armed with years of Peak Insights research and the most up-to-date data – resulting in a 10-point Daines victory.\n\nFor over a decade, this Washington-based hospital system has relied on Peak Insights to help navigate a rapidly changing landscape, with a continuous pattern of new mergers, acquisitions and partnerships between the region’s many health care systems. Peak’s community-based research program helped CHI establish and grow its brand with each new market, by gaining understanding of local perceptions of health care providers and facilities, establishing a baseline of public opinion and monitoring those perceptions over time. Most recently, Peak Insights provided critical public opinion research around the merger between CHI Franciscan and Seattle-based Virginia Mason which married two of the state’s largest hospital systems, operating 11 hospitals and over 300 sites of care.\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nPeak Insights served as the lead research provider to one of the oldest universities on the West Coast – one that is currently sitting inside the top five ranking for public universities in the U.S. That impressive ranking was not always the case. Nearly 15 years ago, the University of Washington barely broke into the top 50 rankings and turned to us to improve their public image and identify opportunities for improvement. Our research provided UW with the critical data needed to evaluate changes in public perceptions over time, determine their standing compared to other universities in the region and explore and develop a long-term strategic communications plan."
