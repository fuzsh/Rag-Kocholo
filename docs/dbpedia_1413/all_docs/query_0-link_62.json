Sauey, Sr. Mr. Sauey passed away at Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on June 29, 2002, after suffering with kidney cancer for approximately 8 months. Mr. Sauey was born in Exland, Wisconsin on July 4, 1921. His mother, Mathilda, and his father, Ole, had immigrated to Wisconsin from Norway. They were poor, hard working farmers, and had a difficult time trying to till the rocky soil and raise their dairy cattle, chickens and pigs. One of his favorite stories to share about himself was that he was literally \"born in a barn\". His father was a tool and die maker and eventually migrated to Chicago in order to earn a living to support his family. When Mr. Sauey was 16, he moved to Chicago to begin a tool and die maker apprenticeship. He began working at Richardson Company which is where he met and soon married his wife, Claire. They lived in a small apartment behind a home in Melrose Park, Illinois. In 1944, they had their first child, Norman, Jr. The family grew in 1948 with the arrival of twin sons, Donald and Ronald. In 1946, he began his own tool and die business, A-1 Tool Corporation which specialized in plastic molds. The business grew and became quite successful. As they needed a good die maker, Norman was asked by his brothers, William and Edwin, to join them in Baraboo as they started another business called Flambeau Plastics. He moved to Baraboo in 1950. In 1960, a little girl they named Mary Anne entered their lives. The purchase of Portage Plastics took place in 1967 and he, along with his son, Norm, operated this plastic extrusion and thermoforming company. Mr. Sauey decided, in 1969, to sell A-1 Tool to Beatrice Foods. He briefly retired in Fort Lauderdale and then a new business was purchased, with his son Don, called Belaco which was subsequently re-named Closet Maid Corporation. In 1971, the business was moved to Ocala, Florida. They marketed wire-coated steel shelving. While in Ocala, the Arabian horse business entered the picture after he purchased a beautiful farm which was named Nodoroma, after his 4 children. He and Claire resided on the farm so that he could enjoy, along with his daughter, Mary Anne, what would become one of his favorite pastimes. His business ventures included the purchase of Clairon Metals Corporation, Cellox Corporation, Clairson Industries Corporation and Den-mar Signs. His real estate acquisitions included apartment and commercial buildings, and vacant land in addition to farms and farmlands. He had many tragedies in his life, including the loss of his wife, Claire; his granddaughter, Kristen Hornby in 1984; and his sister, Annette; but the one that affected him most was the loss of his son, Ron who died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1987. He spent many of his later years involved in woodworking while in Baraboo. He was a skilled craftsman, and enjoyed making furniture and quality toys for his grandchildren. After 58 wonderful years together, Mr. Sauey lost his wife, Claire in 1999. He later married Beverly Barboza of Ocala. They made their home in Fort Lauderdale until his death. He was a kind, benevolent and gentle man and an excellent businessman. He was very caring and had donated both his time and financial support to many organizations, his favorite being the Crane Foundation. He entrusted his businesses to people that he felt had potential. He will be greatly missed by his many family members, friends and associates. His wife Beverly, his sons, Norman (Carla) and Donald (Regina), his daughter Mary Anne, and three grandchildren, Nicole (Richard), Norman III, and Mindy, survive him, He is further survived by other relatives and many, many friends.

In November of 1942, he entered the U.S. Army. His WWII military service took him overseas with the 40th Engineers Combat Regiment to Sicily, Naples, Foggia, Rome, Arno, Southern France, Rhineland and Southern Europe. He earned the Victory Medal, European African Middle Eastern Theater Ribbon with one Silver Battle Star and one Bronze Battle Star, Bronze Service Arrowhead, four Overseas Service Bars, one Silver Stripe and a Good Conduct Medal. He attained the rank of Corporal and was honorably discharged in November of 1945. In October of 1946 he married Laura Mae Sarrington in Dubuque, Iowa.

The raising of the flag was a signal to their neighbors of their return to their Tucson winter home where they have spent the last 20 winters. He was a respected and caring employer.

There are many red and only a few of the special white Scott Construction hats throughout the United States and around the world. For many years, the Reedsburg Butterfest saw an influx of red hats because Grandpa was taking his grandkids to the celebration. \"You can't lose the red hats in a crowd!\" he said.
