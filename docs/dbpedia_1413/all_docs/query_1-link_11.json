When Ron was elected to Congress in 1977, he was the lone Republican representing Montana in Congress and only one of two Republicans representing Montana in senior state and federal positions. He always stood for the common man, advocating in Congress for agriculture and property owners and pushing for Republican values of less government, lower taxes, and more freedoms.”\n\n“Ron loved Montana with all of his heart and those that were close to him knew just how deeply he cared for Montana’s outdoors where he could spend time hunting, fishing and skiing throughout the state. My wife and I, along with the entire team at the Montana Republican Party, send our prayers and thoughts to the Marlenee family as they remember their husband, father, grandfather, and this great Montanan.”"
