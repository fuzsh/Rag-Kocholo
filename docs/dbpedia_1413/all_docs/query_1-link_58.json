        "text": "Aimpoint Research recently welcomed Jon Doggett to its Executive Advisory Group. Jon most recently served as the Chief Executive Officer of the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and brings more than 35 years of experience in agricultural policy and leadership. In his role as Executive Advisor, Jon will be a senior consultant for clients on policy, food, and environmental issues and contribute to Aimpoint Research’s thought leadership platforms and intelligence services, including the Executive Intelligence Network.\n\n“I have long been impressed with the work done by Aimpoint Research and am very pleased to be part of their Executive Advisory Group,” said Doggett. “It’s a great opportunity to work with agribusinesses and trade associations in a new way and I look forward to helping the team accomplish great things.”\n\nPrior to leading NCGA, a grower-led trade association representing over 200,000 U.S. corn farmers, Jon was the head of the organization’s Washington, D.C. office. He was the lead lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau\n\nFederation for eleven years working on issues such as ethanol, climate change, land use, conservation, and endangered species, and worked with the National Cattleman’s Beef Association Public Lands Council and served as senior legislative assistant for former Montana Congressman Ron Marlenee. He was the President of the Washington, Agri-Business Club and served on the Board of Directors of the National Institute of Lobbying and Ethics.\n\nJon’s ability to look at issues with a fresh perspective and find common ground has been the cornerstone of his work in the legislative arena. In 2004, he was named one of the most influential lobbyists in Washington, D.C. by The Hill.\n\n“We’re thrilled to have Jon join Aimpoint’s Executive Advisor Group,” said Mark Purdy, Aimpoint Research Chief Operating Officer. “Jon shares our belief that food security is a foundational component of national security, and his experience, expertise and candid perspective will undoubtedly be an exceptional asset to our clients as they work to build a competitive advantage in the marketplace.”\n\nIn addition to his role with Aimpoint Research, Jon is the principal of Camas Creek Consulting, a strategic policy and communications firm. He is an avid kayaker and is currently a student in pursuit of his skydiving license. Jon splits his time between Meagher County, Montana and Tallahassee, Florida.\n\nPublished 9.21.23"
