It met in Washington, D.C., from January 3, 1977, to January 3, 1979, during the final weeks of Gerald Ford's presidency and the first two years of Jimmy Carter's presidency.\n\nThe apportionment of seats in this House of Representatives was based on the 1970 United States census. Both chambers maintained a Democratic supermajority, and with Jimmy Carter being sworn in as president on January 20, 1977, this gave the Democrats an overall federal government trifecta for the first time since the 90th Congress ending in 1969.\n\nAs of 2022 , this was the most recent Congress to approve an amendment (the unratified District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment) to the Constitution. This is the last time the Democratic Party or any political party held a 2/3 supermajority in the House.\n\nThis is the last congress to at any point have no female senators (from its beginning, January 3, 1977, until the swearing-in of Muriel Humphrey (D-MN) on January 25, 1978; and again from the departure of both Humphrey and Maryon Allen (D-AL) on November 7, 1978, to the early swearing-in of Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) on December 23, 1978).[1]\n\n1977 was the last year to have men serving as all 100 U.S senators\n\nJanuary 20, 1977: Inauguration of President Jimmy Carter\n\nJuly 13, 1977: New York City blackout of 1977\n\nJanuary 1, 1978: The Northern Mariana Islands left the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands to become a Commonwealth of the United States, making it unincorporated and organized.\n\nFebruary 8, 1978: Senate proceedings are broadcast on radio for the first time.\n\nAugust 7, 1978: Love Canal Disaster\n\nSeptember 17, 1978: Camp David Accords\n\nProject MKULTRA – (Church Committee, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senate Human Resources subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research)\n\nAugust 3, 1977: Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, Pub.
