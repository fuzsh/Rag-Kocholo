        "text": "Note: This is an excerpt from my book ​Soldiers and Statesmen\n\nFrom 1950 to 1967, employment in America rose 33%.\n\n​In the Rocky Mountain States it rose 41%. Montana, however, only saw an increase of 14%.\n\nIn that same time period, per capita income in America rose 60% but in Montana it only went up 26%.\n\nIn 1950 Montana’s per capita income had been 8% above the national average but by 1968 it was 16% below. In 1950 Montana earned 0.42% of the nation’s income but by 1968 this had fallen 0.30%.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe main reasons for this decline were threefold:\n\nDeclines in real income per worker in agriculture;\n\nStagnant nonagricultural incomes that didn’t keep pace with national increases;\n\nAn overall decline in the number of people working, leading to a greater need for support of those people from the available employment pool…which sometimes necessitates taking workers out of that employment pool to provide full-time, nonpaid support.\n\nOftentimes that Social Security or insurance check each month wasn’t just going to a senior, but the family or community member caring for them as well.\n\nThis has also resulted in “an increasingly rapid out-migration of educated young people who despair of finding rewarding employment opportunities here.”\n\nNon-agricultural employment jobs in Montana saw incomes go up by 32% from 1950 to 1968. That might sound like a lot, but in Utah they’d gone up by 77% and in Colorado they went up by an astounding 91%.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1960 Montana saw a population growth rate of just 14%, which was 4% below the national average. From 1960 to 1968 Montana’s population grew by only 2.5% compared to the national average of 11%.\n\nDuring those same years, employment rose 15% nationally but just 7.4% in Montana. Prices in Montana also went up, increasing by 25.8% from 1959 to 1969.\n\nThe Montana unemployment rate in 1965 was 4.6%, down significantly from the 6.7% average of the recession year of 1961. By 1968 it was down to 3.6%.\n\nDuring these years Montana saw derivative employment rise as primary employment was lost. Derivative employment consisted of:\n\n“Wholesale and retail trade; the service industries such as barbershops, laundries, hotels and motels, and the like; finance, insurance and real estate; truck, bus and air transportation; construction; and state and local government.”\n\nIn Montana in 1970 there were 85,100 people employed in primary industries and 180,600 people employed in derivative industries in the state. Some key industries were farming, with 36,100; manufacturing with 23,900; trade with 48,100; and government with 40,700.\n\nBy 1974 there were 86,400 working in primary industries and another 215,300 employed in derivative industries.\n\n​Some key differences were that farming had lost 1,000 jobs, manufacturing had gained 400, trade had gained 11,000, and government had gained 4,500.\n\nService and finance jobs were another big winner, going from 41,800 in 1970 to 53,400 in 1974. Railroads, however, lost 100 jobs. Mining picked up 900 jobs during that time, for 7,500 total mining positions in the state.\n\nEven in the 1970s there were warnings about this trend. Maxine Johnson and Paul Polzin predicted in the Montana Business Quarterly in 1976 that “not only do service and trade industries normally pay low wages, but many of the new jobs were part-time.”\n\nOf the new jobs created during that time, 25% were in Billings and another 25% were split between Missoula and Bozeman. Those areas had just 31% of the state’s population yet they were creating half the state’s jobs.\n\nThe recession of the mid-1970s really hit Montana hard in 1975 when 2,900 primary industry jobs were lost. To make up for this, all levels of government hired, creating 6,400 new jobs.\n\n​Factoring in the local, state, and federal jobs lost during those recession years, however, and this created a net gain of just 3,500 jobs.\n\nProfessor Polzin went on to do a study in 1975 about the migration patterns of Montana workers. His findings revealed that “those in the most productive years between ages 15 and 64” were the most likely to leave the state.\n\nHe looked at the years 1965 to 1970 and found that many “who left the state would have preferred to remain, but could not find employment in Montana.\n\n​In 1972 Polzin did another study and found that 42% of the state’s college graduates expected to leave.\n\nIn 1950 Montana’s per capita income was 8% above the national average, Malone tells us. By 1970, however, it had fallen to 12% below the national average and by 1988 that was 22% below.\n\n“This has meant a deteriorating standard of living for Montanans and a severe threat to their future. Although Montanans indisputably enjoyed a higher standard of living in 1990 than they did in 1920, they have also indisputably failed to share in the new era of national economic evolution. If the state continues to follow its old-fashioned ‘low-tax, low-service’ approach to its political economy, thereby failing to invest in order to build and compete in a global economy, the deterioration will continue to deepen.”\n\n​Notes\n\nBigart, Robert. Montana: An Assessment for the Future. University of Montana Publications in History: Missoula, 1978. p 42, 57-60, 64-70, 102.\n\nMalone, Michael Peter; Roeder, Richard B.; Lang, William L. Montana: A History of Two Centuries. The University of Washington Press, 1976. p 346.\n\nI’d say I’m 90% done with the next book in my Montana history series.\n\nI’m thinking of calling it “Soldiers and Statesmen”…what do you think?\n\nProbably not much.\n\nI have a feeling you don’t really care, to be honest.\n\nRemember, 9 copies of the last book sold and 34 of the one before that.\n\nMaybe people don’t care about Montana history in the 20th-century, or maybe they just don’t care about my telling of it.\n\nSo I have extremely low expectations for this new Book 6 and that’s why I’m going to just put it out.\n\nI do that with most of my books – you just get tired of tinkering with ‘em and put ‘me out.\n\nI dunno - maybe if I changed the tone of these books to reflect the tone of this blog they'd do better.\n\nPerhaps a blog is a hotter medium than a book, however. I haven't picked up Marshall McLuhan in awhile so we'll just leave it at that.\n\nHopefully people will read the book...over time. Hey, maybe 30 years from now it'll be a big hit!\n\nI do have to say that a fire was really lit under my ass when I put up a post discussing the book on July 9.\n\nPrior to that I hadn’t touched the book since April. In the last 9 days, however, I’ve added 15,000 words to the book.\n\nThere's a lot more to it than just writing, however. You have to organize, put in images, get things in the right spot...make sense of it all.\n\nHere are some highlights of that.\n\nOn Mike Mansfield\n\nMansfield himself was a workhorse, putting in 15-hour days that started at 6:30 AM. Staff arrived at 8 AM and “Mansfield had already read and sorted the mail.” Montana also developed a strong relationship with Vermont at this time, as Mansfield had breakfast nearly every morning with that the green mountain state’s Senator George Aiken.\n\nOn JFK\n\nJFK told his secretary the night before his trip to Dallas that LBJ would not be on the ticket in ’64. More, the president had been telling other people in the Democratic Party not to worry about LBJ and his bullying ways, for the man was going to prison. On November 23 a syndicated newspaperman Drew Pearson alleged in a column that LBJ was given a $10,000 bribe for a defense contract.\n\nLBJ was a nobody now, had been ever since Kennedy had tapped him as vice president and even more so after Mansfield had stood by and let the congressional caucus make clear that it did not want LBJ meddling in their business. Worse, LBJ’s corruption was about to be made public. LBJ therefore had the motive, means and opportunity to have Kennedy killed.\n\nThe 1966 Montana Senate Race\n\nDuring the race Babcock “chastised Metcalf for his opposition to America’s expanding roll in the conflict” in Vietnam and called him a “tax and spend” Democrat, one of the earliest uses of that term.\n\nBabcock spent $210,000 in the race to Metcalf’s $68,000. Metcalf “traveled the state in a modest campaign car, spending a relatively small sum on the race.” This was all while Babcock “told Montanans that Metcalf had lost touch with Montana.”\n\nIn the end Babcock lost badly. Metcalf took 53% of the vote to the governor’s 47%, or 138,166 votes to 121,697.\n\nThe 1968 Democratic National Convention\n\nIn August 1968 the Democratic National Convention in Chicago saw several thousand protesters clash with 12,000 police and another 15,000 state and federal officers. Over 500 people were arrested and hundreds of people were injured.\n\nFollowing the convention Gallup did a poll and found out that 56% of Americans approved of how police had handled the protesters at the convention, with just 31% disapproving. The protesters were vocal and they were active, but the silent majority in the country continued to support those in power.\n\nWhen the convention ballots were counted, Humphrey won with an overwhelming 1,759 votes to McCarthy’s 601 and McGovern’s 146. Vice President Humphrey would be the nominee, and he’d be facing a former vice president, Richard Nixon.\n\nMontana Farm & Livestock Numbers to 1995\n\nIt was estimated that Montana had 3.1 million cattle in January 1976. That sounds like a lot but Texas had 15.6 million cattle. Despite this, Montana was still #14 in the country for cattle and #8 for beef cattle.\n\nThe average value of a beef cow in Montana in 1976 was $205. That was low compared to other states, where cattle were more densely packed onto the land. In Vermont, for instance, a cow was worth $345. Dairy had fallen off, however, and Montana was #44 in the nation for milk production in 1976.\n\nThere were 635,000 sheep in Montana in 1976 and they had an average worth of $40, which was above the national average of $37.\n\nBeaverhead County had the most cattle in 1995, with 148,000 head. Second was Big Horn County with 128,000 head.\n\nThe number of animals, and their value, has fluctuated over the years. In 1960 there were 2.2 million animals with a value of $141 a head. By 1995 that’d shot up to 2.7 million animals with a value of $675 a head.\n\nThe real change came in the 1970s. The price per head was $195 but by 1980 it was $510.\n\nAround 30,000 Montanans made their living in the agricultural industry in 1995. Compared to the homesteading days of the 1900s and 1910s, however, the industry’s workers have dropped considerably. In just 70 years about 200,000 fewer people call themselves Montana farmers, ranchers, or just a hired hand in one of the many agricultural pursuits going on around the state.\n\nRising Medical Costs in America\n\nBy the 1990s healthcare costs were double the rate of inflation. In 1990 it was figured that healthcare expenditures were making up 12.2% of the nation’s GDP. That came out to $666.2 billion that year and the average household was spending $2,566 a year on healthcare. A whopping $256 billion was spent on hospital care alone that year. For hospitals, this was great. Their average annual revenue growth had been 14% from 1966 to 1983, and a main reason for that were the exorbitant rates they charged patients.\n\nIn 1990 alone there was $10.4 billion in new hospital construction.\n\nCongress tries time and time again to do something but fails miserably. Hospital care funding from the government was 42.5% in 1960 and by 1990 it was 54.7%. To put it another way, $147 was spent per person in 1960 and by 2013 $9,255 was being spent per person. That’s an average annual increase of 8%.\n\nIn 1960 businesses, households and private sponsors covered 77% of healthcare costs, with government taking up the other 23%. By 2013 businesses, households and private sponsors were covering 57% of healthcare costs and government was making up the other 43%.\n\nTo cover the rising costs of care, patients continually turn to insurance, which has become ever more expensive. Because of this, Americans have managed to keep out-of-pocket hospital costs down. In 1960 they were 21% and by 1980 they got to 5% and have stayed there ever since.\n\nBy 1990 Americans were spending $126 billion a year on physician services and another $34 billion on dental services. Almost 98% of dental costs were paid by insurance or out-of-pocket.\n\n​In 1990 over the counter drugs accounted for $22 billion in sales and prescription drugs were worth $32 billion. Spending for things like hearing aids, crutches, wheelchairs, and artificial limbs totaled $6 billion. Eyeglasses and contact lenses cost another $5 billion. Nursing home costs were $53 billion in 1990.\n\nBy the year 2000 16% of the country had no health insurance at all.\n\nMontana Tourism in the 1970s\n\nJust 12% of all the land in America was reserved for recreational purposes in the 1970s. A whopping 72% of that was out West, an area that only had 15% of the country’s population. So it was that people came to Montana and Montanans catered to them. They provided services more than products, and Montana’s economic slide into the dominant services industry began around this time.\n\nThe big problem was that tourism jobs don’t pay that much. In 1974 a services industry job in Montana would net you $5,332 for the year. Retail trade got you $5,515. If you worked in the kitchen or some other food industry you’d make $8,666 for the year. Those in finance and insurance and real estate were looking at $7,689 for the year.\n\nIt was only when you got into the more skilled trades that you breached the $10,000 income levels. For instance, transportation and utility workers would make $10,012 a year while construction workers could make $10,977. Those in mining and wood products typically made in the $12,000 range.\n\nIt was estimated in 1974 that just $0.22 of every dollar a tourist spent remained in the state as direct income for residents.\n\nWhen you put tourism against forestry, it’s clear that the numbers just can’t be made up. The Montana Business Quarterly estimated that it’d take 4,260 tourists coming to the state to replace the $37,500 in income that five forestry jobs created. Those jobs would be lost each time lumber production fell a million board feet.\n\nTo accomplish that task, 15% more tourists would have had to come to Montana in 1974 than had come in 1971, “an unlikely prospect.”\n\nContinue to come they did, however. There were just too many things for them to do, no matter what time of year it was.\n\nHunting was a big past time in the state, as it is now. In 1974 there were just under 310,000 hunting licenses issued to residents and over 35,000 to nonresidents. More than 114,000 deer and elk were taken that year.\n\nFishing is another pastime that Montanans enjoy, as well as those from out-of-state. In 1974 nearly 158,000 fishing licenses were sold, or what amounted to 21% of the state’s population of 750,000.\n\nSkiing is an activity that many enjoy and in 1974 Montana had 26 ski areas for residents and nonresidents to choose from. Choose they did, as the two-year period from 1974 to 1976 saw nearly 600,000 people strap on skis at those areas.\n\n​\n\nWell, there you have it. If you read this far then maybe Book 6 is right for you.\n\nUntil then, why not check out some of the other books in the series?\n\nI’m having a fun time writing my 6th book of Montana history.\n\nIt’ll cover the years 1960 to 1990 and I thought I’d go ahead and share some with you today.\n\n​Monsanto Poisons the Public with Glyphosate\n\nMonsanto first introduced glyphosate to the world in 1974 when it released its weed-killing product Roundup. By 1980 Roundup was a bestseller.\n\nGlyphosate was a “pre-engineered answer to a new world of patented GMO seed.” Prior to its use in crops it “was used as a scaling agent to clean lime and other water deposits from industrial pipes.” It’d originally been discovered in 1950 by a Swiss chemist but no one could find a use for it.\n\nThen in 1970 a Monsanto scientist discovered that it could act as a powerful herbicide. The Rockefeller Foundation began pouring money into research starting in 1972, perhaps viewing the herbicide as a way to control population. That same year World Bank head Robert McNamara said that world population control was needed.\n\nThe companies and the world monetary and governmental organizations sold glyphosate on the idea that it’d increase crop yields, thus ending hunger around the world.\n\nIn reality the compound destroyed soil microbiology. This was known when it was first sold in 1974, as farmers used it exclusively to kill all vegetation that was sprayed.\n\nBesides killing plants that grow, glyphosate also kills human gut microbes. We can trace the world’s increase in disease to the infusion of “cheap, chemical-laden foods” filling our diets.\n\nHow it works is that glyphosate inhibits CYP enzymes in the body, enzymes that are critical to our gut’s bacteria. We need this bacteria because it detoxifies xenobiotics, or foreign substances in the body.\n\nBecause we’re now eating so many glyphosate-laced foods, we don’t have enough of this beneficial bacteria in our gut to stop other toxins, toxins that ironically are now being enhanced by the glyphosate.\n\nThese toxins then take over our body’s immune system, increasing inflammation and damaging our cellular systems. Dangerous substances are allowed to break into the blood, and at that point the poison can penetrate every organ in the body as the blood-brain barrier has been crossed.\n\nIn effect, glyphosate acts as a channel for disease. “As glyphosate depletes this microbiology, they are essentially destroying the human race from the inside out – ever so silently.”\n\nIt wouldn’t be until 1996 that Monsanto developed their “Roundup-ready” line of genetically modified soybeans, corn, and cotton. Planting started in the US.\n\nPrior to that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) had only been used in tobacco plants in America. Now the food supply would be hit with the stuff. In 1974 American farmers had used 0.8 million pounds of glyphosate on their crops but by 1995 they were using 28 million pounds.\n\nGlyphosate was the most widely-used pesticide in the country, with Atrazine and metolachlor coming in next. In 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glysophate as a “probable human carcinogen.” This was based on “increased prevalence of rare liver and kidney tumors in chronic animal feeding studies.”\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, incidences of liver cancer have “more than tripled since 1980.” About 24,000 Americans die from liver cancer each year now.\n\n​In regards to kidney cancer, the American Cancer Society tells us that “for reason that are not totally clear, the rate of new kidney cancers had been rising since the 1990s.” As of this writing, more than 14,000 American die from kidney cancer each year.\n\nPeople know something is wrong with their food supply. For years people and governments have tried to get labels on their food telling them if the food has been genetically modified, such as with GMO seeds, or sprayed with GMO-seed supporting herbicides like glyphosate.\n\nThey’re blocked time and time again, however, as Monsanto and other large corporations do not want the truth to come out. If people knew that their food was poisoning them, those companies would lose money. To them, nothing is more important than money.\n\nIn 2000 the patent for glyphosate expired, meaning lots of other companies besides Monsanto could produce and market it.\n\nIn Europe glyphosate is used on up to 40% of crops. In 2015 the World Health Organization concluded that glyphosate “probably” caused cancer. It came to those conclusions after looking at a 1985 study on mice, one that had been rejected by the FDA at the time.\n\nBy 2016 1.7 billion pounds of glyphosate were being used annually.\n\n​The Waves of Corporate Consolidation\n\nAdvertising has always been a big business in America. In 1880 total advertising volume in the country was $200 million but by 1920 that’d risen to $3 billion.\n\nThe huge uptick was “fueled in part by the increased availability of consumer credit” on such items as “automobiles, radios, household appliances, and leisure time activities like spectator sports and movies.”\n\nThe rise of TV in the 1960s further boosted spending on advertising as more and more companies sought the disposable income of American consumers. It was clear that TV networks could make large corporations a lot of money. For that reasons the buyouts began.\n\nMergers had been nothing new in America, for they’d been going on in the 1890s during the robber baron days. In the 1910s and 1920s the second wave of mergers started, primarily in “banking, retailing, steel, chemicals, and food products.”\n\nThe third wave of American mergers started in the mid-1950s and went to 1969, with the peak “go-go boom of 1962-1969.” This period was defined by conglomerate-type mergers, which made up 60% of all mergers. These were primarily in the electronics and military industries.\n\nThe fourth wave of American mergers got started in the 1980s. A big spur to this was the deregulation of the airline, trucking, natural gas, and banking industries by President Carter, and the deregulation of the telephone industry by Reagan. President Reagan also took an “openly relaxed” approach to antitrust policies, another spur to big corporations to merge.\n\nIn 1984 Standard of California took over Gulf Oil for $25 billion. In 1985 Nabisco Brands and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company merged for $4.9 billion.\n\nIn 1988 there was a leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. for $25 billion. Those were the two largest consolidations of the 1980s, oil and snack foods.\n\nThere were other large deals as well. In 1985 Capital Cities Communication bought ABC for $3.5 billion and General Electric bought RCA, the owner of NBC, for $6.3 billion.\n\nIn 1989 Time Inc. merged with Warner Bros. in a $14 billion deal.\n\nThere were large consolidations in the American advertising industry as well. In 1982 and 1983 alone, “eight sizable agencies were bought by larger ones.” They were big money ventures. In 1987 WPP Group acquired J. Walter Thompson Co. for $566 million.\n\n“Agency consolidations were driven by three factors,” an Ad Age report tells us, and those were:\n\n​\n\n“Banks and other lending institutions were willing to finance highly leveraged acquisitions; agencies that were bringing in huge profits had money to spend on acquisitions; and agencies were looking for ways to increase profitability.”\n\nLarger corporations saw the revenue potential that advertising agencies could bring, and by 1990 there were just about 30 independent advertising agencies left in the country, down from the 100 that existed in 1980.\n\nA large reason for the acquisitions was the changing nature of TV advertising. The networks no longer had the same power now that cable TV was encroaching on their audience.\n\nBig network viewership dropped below 60% in the early-90s. Cable TV home-shopping networks also rose up to cut into advertising’s profits.\n\nIn response, advertisers dropped the standard 30-second TV advertising spot to 15 seconds in an effort to increase the number of ads seen while also decreasing the cost. In 1986 a new TV ad record was set when “The Cosby Show” began asking for $400,000 to air a 30-second spot.\n\nThere was a stall in mergers in the early-90s due to the recession but then the fifth wave of American mergers started up around 1994. “Its pattern is eerily similar to the century-ago wave of the 1890s,” Monthly Review wrote in 2001.\n\nIn 1995 CBS was bought by Westinghouse for $5.4 billion. In 1996 Capital Cities Communication, the owner of ABC, was bought by Disney Corp. for $19 billion. That same year Turner Broadcasting System merged with Time Warner, Inc. In 1999 Viacom bought CBS for $37 billion. In 2000 Time Warner, Inc. merged with America Online.\n\nIt was seen as a mega-deal, but by 2004 Ted Turner’s personal stake in the stock of those companies dropped from $7 billion to $2 billion as more and more people abandoned AOL to browse the web on their own.\n\nBy the late-1990s mergers and acquisitions were averaging $76 billion a deal. In 1999 worldwide merger deals reached $3.4 trillion, which was equal to 34% of all of America’s industrial buildings, plants, equipment and machinery. All in an attempt to increase consumerism.\n\nBy 2015 the American advertising industry had grown to $180 billion, the largest amount spent by any country. China comes in second with $90 billion. Most of that advertising is on TV, with $71 billion spent through that medium in the US in 2015.\n\n2016 expects to see $200 billion spent on American ads.\n\n​The Consolidation of the Banking Industry\n\nThe Securities Industry Assn. “counted 244,000 brokers and back-office staff” on Wall Street in 1986, “up from the 134,000 in 1980.” The October 1987 crash was hard on Wall Street, however, and employment “plummeted” to 209,000.\n\nBanking was an industry that merged a lot in the 1980s. At the end of 1984 there were 15,084 commercial banks, independent banks, and thrift holding companies. By the end of 2003, however, that number had fallen 48% to 7,842.\n\nThe vast majority of the decline in banks happened in the community banking sector, though it still makes up 94% of all banking. It’s also important to note that 3,097 new banking organizations opened during that time as well.\n\nDuring those years the banking industry’s assets grew from $3.3 trillion to $9.1 trillion, an increase of 70%.\n\nThose assets were not evenly distributed across the industry, as organizations with $10 billion in assets saw their numbers increase by 31% during those years while organizations with assets of less than $1 billion saw their numbers drop by 14%.\n\nBanks with assets of less than $100 million saw their numbers drop 6% so that in 2003 they only made up 2% of the entire banking industry.\n\nBy 2003 a quarter of the nation’s bank deposits were held by just three large banks – Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America. In 1984 a total of 42 banks had held that many deposits.\n\nOne bank alone, Bank of America Corporation, held nearly 10% of the banking industry’s assets by 2003, which came out to $512 billion in deposits and another $870 billion in assets.\n\nThe reason for this decline in banks was due to “a growing concentration of industry assets among a few dozen extremely large financial institutions.”\n\n​Notes\n\n“American Advertising: A Brief History.” History Matters.

What you probably can’t see is how big it is.\n\nHere, take a look:\n\nSo that thing folds out to show 10 total pages when you count front and back.\n\nHere’s what one of those looks like:\n\nSo we get some fun comic-style images that tell Arnold Olsen’s life story.\n\nRight away with this frame we get that he’s a hard worker and not afraid of ‘menial’ jobs.\n\nHe was a newsboy, grocery clerk, and laborer. Of course, those were all unionized positions back then too.\n\nWhat I like about this is that “Right to Wreck” reference there, making it clear that our current Montana battle with Right to Work is far from new.\n\nLet’s move up to the 1970s and look in on Dick Shoup.\n\nHe was a Missoula mayor and a U.S. Representative. Here’s some of his literature:\n\nI like that brochure. It’s got a nice image on the front and a good one on the back.\n\nWhen you fold it out you get lots of info on Shoup as well as some images of his family.\n\nI don’t like that large image of him with the mic as he looks confused.\n\nWestern Montana voters would have liked it, however, as it reminded them of the Missoula ROTC-takeover and Shoup’s successful handling of it.\n\nSo it got the job done…and Shoup got elected.\n\nNow I’d like to point out a mailer he sent out to constituents in 1974:\n\nYou’ll get tons of these in our representatives’ biographical folders at the Montana Historical Society Research Center.\n\nThis one is good because it shows that Shoup gets around, or at least his staff does.\n\nYeah, this was back when they had mobile offices:\n\nDick Shoup's Mobile Office, 1974\n\nPretty cool, huh?\n\nFinally, let’s head up into the late-1970s and early-1980s with our friend Max Baucus.\n\nBaucus took out Olsen in the ’74 Democratic Primary and he took out Shoup in the ’74 general. That’s how he first got to D.C. as a U.S. Representative.\n\nCheck out these cool flyers:\n\nBaucus’ 1974 U.S. House run was a monumental affair, one we can learn from.\n\nAlas, few have the gall to replicate it…or the stamina.\n\nYou see, Max was part of the 631 Club, a select group that may have only included himself.\n\nAfter all, how many people do you know that walk 631 miles from Gardiner to Yaak?\n\nThat’s impressive, damn impressive.\n\nI was very impressed with the flyers that Max had, as well as the images he chose for them.\n\nHere are several that he did over the years.\n\nMax Baucus walking in 1974\n\nWhen I look at these images I can see why Max Baucus was elected so many times in Montana.\n\nI can see quite clearly.\n\n​\n\nIf you'd like to see Montana history more clearly, please check out my 5 books on the subject.\n\nWe cover the time from the dinosaurs to 1960.\n\nBook 6, covering the years of 1960 to 1990, will be out sometime this summer.\n\nMike Cooney was born in Washington, D.C. on September 3, 1954.\n\n“His mother wanted to deliver him [there] because her family lived there,” Chuck Johnson told us. “They returned to Montana a few days later on the train, making him ‘a coast-to-coast baby.’”\n\nOne of the best places to get Mike Cooney information is on the Montana Secretary of State page.\n\nThe piece was written by Chuck Johnson and details Mike Cooney’s early history, and his family’s history.\n\nYes, the Cooney family has a long history in Montana. That’s one of the reasons I wish I was in Helena today – to go to the Montana Historical Society to pull up his folder and those of his family members.\n\nYou’ll remember that Cooney’s grandpa was both governor and lieutenant governor of Montana.\n\nI profiled this in my book Feds and Farmers and we’ll get into a bit in a future post.\n\nHeading over to Ballotpedia gives us a look at Mike Cooney’s election history. We can get similar information at Vote Smart.\n\nThat’s how I got this Mike Cooney timeline:\n\nIn 1972 Cooney graduated from Butte High. He headed to Missoula and began studying journalism at UM. During the summers he worked at KXLF-TV in Butte. It was during his time in Missoula that he first met Max Baucus, “a political newcomer” that was “stopping by dorm rooms to campaign for the Legislature.”\n\nFrom 1972 to 1979 Cooney worked as an Officer for the Cooney Food Brockerage. The firm started in 1894 by Frank Cooney, who served as Montana’s 8th Governor from 1933 until his death in office in 1935.\n\nIn 1974 Cooney went to work as the “advance man” for Max Baucus’s campaign to unseat Dick Shoup from Montana’s western U.S. House District. He dropped out of UM to do this, which required him travelling around the state.\n\nIn 1975, after Baucus was elected, Cooney went back to UM, this time majoring in political science.\n\nIn 1976 Cooney’s dad died at the age of 60. Mike Cooney’s dad was Rod Cooney, a “New Deal Democrat” who “slapped a Lyndon Johnson bumper sticker on the side of the headboard” on his side of the bed while his wife “affixed a Barry Goldwater sticker on her side.” It was in August and he “stayed home from UM to help his mother.” He also decided to run for the Montana House, District 83 out of Butte. He was 21-years old and faced a 3-way primary against Larry Buckley and Joe Hughes. He won, picking up 1,044 votes to Buckley’s 450 and Hughes’ 421.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1980 Cooney was in the Montana House of Representatives.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1989 Cooney worked for Senator Max Baucus.\n\nIn 1979 Cooney got his BS from the University of Montana.\n\nIn 1979 Cooney married Dee Ann Gribble, “whom he had met when she worked part-time at a movie theater in Butte and had dated for five years.” They now have three children.\n\nIn 1989 Cooney moved his family to Washington D.C. to become Baucus’ executive assistant.\n\nIn 1988 Cooney ran for Montana Secretary of State. He was unopposed in the primary and picked up 92,108 votes. He faced Pete Story in the General that year, with Larry Dodge running as a Libertarian. Cooney won with 174,917 votes to Story’s 163,830 (Dodge picked up 16,174). Cooney would serve 3 terms, until 2001.\n\nIn 1989 Cooney began serving as Montana Secretary of State. He was “stunned” by office politics, where workers were “expected to pony up money for my political activities,” as they had been expected to do under Jim Waltermire’s tenure. Cooney put an immediate stop to that.\n\nIn 1995 Cooney was “hired to help an insurance group lobby during the 1995 Legislature.”\n\nIn 2000 Cooney ran for Governor and lost.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2006 Cooney was Executive Director of Montana Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies.\n\nIn 2002 Cooney ran for the Montana Senate District 26 and won against Mary Jo Fox, 5,314 votes to 2,487. The IR called it a “rancorous race.” Cooney spent $25,000 in the race against Fox’s $50,000 (Fox was a former advisor and campaign manager to Marc Racicot).\n\nIn 2006 Cooney was reelected to the Montana Senate for District 40 over Bob Leach, 5,871 votes to 2,739. He got $8,064 in campaign donations that cycle.\n\nBased on Cooney’s time in office, he has a 50% rating from the MT Stockgrowers Association, 24% from the Montana Chamber of Commerce, 30% from the Montana Contractor’s Association, and 13% from the Montana Family Foundation.\n\nOn the other hand, Cooney has a 100% rating from the Montana Women’s Lobby, 100% from Montana Audubon, 80% from the AFL-CIO, 75% from Montana Human Rights Network, and a 100 rating from the Montana League of Rural Voters.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2015 he was the Division Administrator at the Department of Labor.\n\nIn 2010 Cooney was named as interim director of the Montana Historical Society when Richard Sims stepped down.\n\nNow he’s Montana’s 32nd Lieutenant Governor.\n\n​\n\nBack in September I headed up to the Missoula Public Library to get some books on fur trapping history.\n\nI ended up finding an old book on Montana politics, one I used to write The Rise of the New Montana Democrats.\n\nI wrote a lot more, and I’d like to share that with you today. I will add that this history is a bit dated.\n\nThat’s a huge problem with our Montana historians – their inability to put much on the shelf for future generations to look at. Sorry, “professional” historians. Montana’s amateur historians have been showing you up for years.\n\nUnless you’ve got some letters behind your name and some fancy degrees hanging on your office wall, however, people don’t give a damn about you. That’s why we’ll take a look at what David Emmons had to say about Montana during the first few years of the Racicot Administration. We start with population.\n\nEmmons goes off of the 1990 Census for his figures, which gave a population count of 800,204 for Montana.\n\nHe mentions that by February 1993 the state had lost an additional 24,000 people from that low number, however, effectively wiping out the 12,000-person gain we’d experienced over the 1980s (786,690 was the 1980 Montana population).\n\nMontana wasn’t growing much at that time, probably because we’d done away with our natural resource jobs. He mentions that, and the accepted historiography of Montana:\n\n​\n\n“The popular version of Montana’s history was essentially written by two men. Joseph Kinsey Howard said the place was high, wide, handsome – and a colony of eastern corporations. K. Ross Toole said it was an uncommon land, a state of extremes – and the plaything of reactionary capital. There was little subtlety to either man’s analysis: from the fur traders of the nineteenth century to the coal barons of the twentieth, Montana gave up its material treasure as well as its political chastity to plunderers.” (Emmons, p 121)\n\n​\n\nThat’s the common version of history up until those two men stopped writing about the state – the 1940s and 1970s respectively, though Toole did manage a few essays before he died in August 1981. After that the state’s history and the interpretation of it was left to one man.\n\nSince 1975, Emmons writes, Michael Malone “has been fighting a lonely battle against this whining and self-pitying interpretation of Montana’s past.”\n\nMalone – who died in December 1999 – asserted that the Anaconda Company had never truly been in control of the state, and wrote such. He went against Howard’s idea that the “copper trust” had driven homegrown Fritz Augusta Heinze from the state as well as Toole’s idea that the legislatures were controlled by the Company.\n\nMalone came back “in 1985 and 1986” to tell us that the state’s history “was not uncommon” as Toole had proposed. He pointed out “that although the Company had at times been heavy-handed, so had other companies in other western states.”\n\nEmmons felt that this interpretation was the right one, for the victimization attitude that both Howard and Toole had foisted upon the state was hurting more than helping.\n\nMontanans didn’t view their plights as caused by world economic conditions that made them feel like flotsam on some giant sea, but by a local company – however international it had become – which they could see and feel firsthand. This created an “anti-corporate” attitude in the state “that severely limited its ability to adjust to changes in national and international markets.”\n\nEmmons is a firm believer in the Montana sales tax, and claims that “people raised on conspiracy theories” are the main reason it hasn’t passed, either in 1971 or 1993, though he fails to mention the push for the tax in either the 1930s or the 1950s.\n\nOur lack of a sales tax “punishes industry and business” in Montana “all in order to get even with the Company.” Emmons makes it plain that Montanans cling to this attitude because of “self-indulgence,” or “the avoidance of all responsibility by the assignment of blame to sinister outside forces.”\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​Emmons mentions UM economist Thomas Power’s idea that Montana’s extractive industry is doing it more harm than good, leaving “deep scars in the state’s collective psyche; it enfeebles the people and leaves them politically helpless.”\n\nHis answer? A consumption economy over a production economy.\n\n​\n\nHigh Montana Wages with Extraction\n\nThat didn’t sound too good to many, but what choices were there? Montana in the early-90s was not the place it had been even twenty years before.\n\nAnaconda Copper left Montana in 1977, having gone bankrupt after Chile nationalized their vast copper mining holdings there. It was a fundamental shift in Montana politics and Montana economics.\n\nButte ceased to be relevant in either, though it took decades for that realization to come about, and for many it still hasn’t.\n\nThe Company had been the driver of the state for nearly a century, both politically and economically. In terms of thought control, it had that too, for Anaconda Copper owned virtually all of the major daily newspapers. What they didn’t say was often more telling than what they did.\n\nWithout Anaconda Copper, Montana wouldn’t be what it is today, and its likely many of your neighbors wouldn’t be who they are. The Company’s effect on the state was so great because so many other industries were dependent upon their business. Emmons makes this clear when he shows us some numbers:\n\n​\n\n“In 1946 ACM produced 3.7 million ounces of silver; 30,000 ounces of gold; 1.47 million pounds of molybdenum; 1.55 million pounds of cadmium; 4,883 tons of arsenic; 15.6 million pounds of lead; 1.5 million pounds of zinc; 111,397 tons of manganese; and 742 million pounds of copper. It was the largest and most diversified copper company among the big five and probably in the world.” (Emmons, p 123)\n\n​\n\n​All of this sent Montana’s per capita income to levels 16% higher than the national average.\n\nBill Montgomery was one example. He started at the smelter in Anaconda in 1948, making $18 per day. “That’s more than four times the $4 per day his dad made starting at the foundry,” the Montana Standard wrote years later.\n\nThey were good times, and coming right after the war too. They helped the state grow. Good times don’t last in Montana, however, for it’s a state of cycles in all things.\n\nIn 1955 Butte started open-pit mining and over the years more and more workers lost their jobs to automation and the nature of mining post-WWII. Unions in Butte were powerless to stop this, as they let their political paranoia outweigh their good sense.\n\nIn 1950 the International Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers “was expelled for alleged Communist sympathies” from the Congress of Industrial Organizations, or CIO, Emmons tells us. On top of this open-pit mining reduced the need for workers and also made mining more strike-proof. “Open pits could be shut down and left untended unlike underground mines which could fill with water or face the threat of fire.”\n\nAll of this emboldened Anaconda Copper to face down strikers, something it’d been quite successful at before. “In 1912, 1914, 1917-20, 1933-34, and 1967,” Emmons tells us, “the Company faced, and faced down, genuine labor-management crises.”\n\nHe also says that “job-conscious pragmatists and ethnic exlusionists in the various miners unions” helped the Company defeat the strikers. Over time this meant that 16% higher per capita income would be going down.\n\n​\n\n​Emmons points out that 1957 was almost more important than 1959 when it came to information in the state.\n\nThe former was the year the Legislative Council formed to aid legislators in their work. Company lobbyists had done the job before then. The latter was the year the Company sold its newspapers to Lee Enterprises.\n\nChanges kept coming. The early-60s saw Montana Power let loose from Anaconda Company control. The early-70s saw the Company leave the legislature. Everyone who was a drinker knew the game was up, for Helena’s open bars came to an end.\n\n“A part of political life in Montana for almost a century, the Company’s open bars were a favorite gathering place for lobbyists and legislators,” Emmons tells us. “Their closure convinced even the most skeptical that a new age was dawning.”\n\nThat new age was clear the very next year when a constitutional convention was called. It passed “with no overt opposition by the state’s major corporations.”\n\n​\n\nAnaconda Closes Down\n\nEmmons figured that the Company “was distracted” as 1972 was also the year its Chilean mining holdings were seized by Salvador Allende. That spelled the end of the Company and after going through “receivership and reorganization” was sold to Atlantic Richfield Corporation (ARCO) in 1977.\n\nARCO made big promises to the people of Montana, including running the mines and smelters “at full bore” while “payrolls and investments would grow.”\n\nThe new company was good on its promise for two years before they changed their tune. The smelters in Anaconda and Great Falls were closed on a day that came to be known as “Black Monday” in the state.\n\nIt was September 29, 1980, and ARCO announced that both cities would lose the plants, causing “$40 million in lost annual wages and fringe benefits,” according to the Associated Press of the time.\n\nJim Marvin was president of ARCO at the time and said it was due to the company’s “inability to economically meet state and federal environmental regulations.”\n\nThe closure that day resulted in “between 1,000 and 1,200 smelter workers” losing their job, with “several hundred more” seeing layoffs over the year.\n\nThe City of Anaconda was hit hard, with 2,784 people leaving the workforce from 1970 to 1990. Bill Montgomery, who’d started at the smelter in 1948 at $18 a day, managed to hold on until 1982, “helping complete the shutdown.” After that he was laid off, “with no other positions available and three kids still in school.”\n\nMontgomery eventually got a job with a different mining company to help tear down the smelter. Retirement finally came in 1990, not in congratulation of his 42 years of service to the state, but because of a back injury.\n\nEmmons tells us that Silver Bow County saw 20,000 people leave between the end of WWII and 1990, which made up 40% of its people. Deer Lodge County, where the City of Anaconda is, lost 41% of its population, or 7,000 people.\n\n​\n\nThe Railroads Decline\n\nIn 1985 the Milwaukee Road closed, one of the state’s major railroads. “Its depots became restaurants,” Emmons tells us, “also since failed.” This had a dramatic effect on the eastern portion of the state, as Emmons notes:\n\n​\n\n“Between 1960 and 1970, thirty-nine of Montana’s fifty-six counties lost population. Most of those thirty-nine were in the wheat and cattle country in the eastern part of the state. All told, the rural farm population fell from 175,707 in 1940 to 88,460 in 1970 to under 80,000 in 1990.”\n\n​So bad were these changes that ten of Montana’s eastern counties have been considered for “deprivatization” and “inclusion in the Big Open section of the Buffalo Commons.”\n\nBy 1990 we lost our second U.S. House seat, one we’d had since 1912. Pat Williams’ win that year over Ron Marlenee proved “mostly that western Montana added a few people and eastern Montana lost a lot.”\n\nIt may have been hard for many to see these changes coming, but they should have.\n\nIt’s likely that the coal, oil and gas boom of the mid-70s blinded them, or just made them want to be blinded. That lasted five years before reaching the inevitable bust that all Montana booms experience eventually.\n\nEmmons gives us a hint of what this was like, though barely:\n\n​\n\n“The result was a classic Montana boom, followed by a classic Montana bust. The numbers are too sad to recount. Suffice it to say that for a time, there were jobs, the state and county coffers were full, roads were repaired, schools were built, the poor and marginalized of the state were treated with the dignity they deserved. (Midwestern consumers of Montana coal even paid the state the ultimate compliment” they referred to Montanans as “blue eyed Arabs.”)”\n\nIt didn’t last, however, and by 1975 “the boom began to sound choked and muffled” and by 1980 “the most attentive listener could not have discerned the trace of an echo.”\n\nEmmons tells us this same cycle was followed by the lumber and wood products industry.\n\n“By 1979, there were almost 11,000 jobs in Montana’s woods and mills,” he tell us. “By 1982, there were only slightly more than 7,100.” Sawmills decreased substantially, going from 330 in 1956 to 141 in 1981 to 80 in 1993. It was a 29% drop in lumber production between 1979 and 1982 and then another 14% drop between 1988 and 1991. Emmons expected the industry would shed another 6,500 jobs over the 1990s.\n\nFor the state this spelled disaster, and in more ways than one. Natural resources made up 24% of the state’s 1983 revenues. By 1980 that had fallen to 11%. “Some of this was owing to tax cuts designed to stimulate production,” Emmons says, and adds “the cuts did not work.”\n\nMontanans didn’t know what to do, as for decades they’d been told to work the land and all would be provided. Now that wasn’t the case, and it had a profound psychological impact that Emmons diagnoses well:\n\n“Montana historically had one simple responsibility: give up treasures. It discharged that responsibility in a variety of ways. It grew wheat, raised cattle, mined ores, cut trees, milled raw lumber, dug coal, drilled for oil and natural gas, and dammed and put turbines on its rivers. Discovering the world no longer needed what generations of Montanans had made had a far more chilling effect on the state’s collective psyche than had any alleged subservience to ACM.” (Emmons, p 128)\n\n​\n\n​Conclusion\n\nEmmons makes it clear that tourism is seen by many as the answer, and that this answer has not come.\n\n​“Tourism does not require the state’s resources be plundered; neither does it pay very well.”\n\nFor that good pay, Montana needs good employers. Alas, despite all that we have to offer in the way of natural beauty, it’s the coastal cities to the west of us that attract the top industries of today. “Montana’s quality of life is, in fact, enviable,” Emmons writes, “but there is a very short line of employers waiting to share in it.”\n\nBy 1990 Montana’s per capital income was 17% below the national average. We fell 33% over 32 years.\n\n“The state is still a long way from major markets, its tax structure is still archaic, its university system is in disarray, and too many of its citizens still evince symptoms of historically (and historian-) induced paranoia.”\n\n​\n\n“More certain is that the present generation of Montanans will have to reinvent the state and cast it in a new image. A great deal is riding on them. They can succeed only if they pay proper attention and respect to the old ways of making a Montana living as they go about the task of finding new ways.”\n\n​\n\nThe “present generation” had their time come and go in the 1990s. They did nothing.\n\nNow we look to others for the answers. They’re out their, waiting…ready. All they need is for those that came before to step aside, finally step aside.\n\nThe Montana Democratic Party as we know it today rose up with the fall of our extraction industry.\n\nIndeed, the fall benefited them, or at least those that were able to cement their vision into the party apparatus.\n\nThis vision departed from an age-old Montana Democratic principle. It’s called conservatism. I feel our current crop of Montana Democrats have forgotten what this is, and Republicans have benefited.\n\nA lot of it comes down to the lack of jobs and the population shifts this causes.\n\nNeighboring states have fared better than Montana over the past few decades, even as their resource extraction economies disappeared just as ours did.\n\nLike Montana, the neighboring states of Nebraska, Colorado, and Washington have seen agriculture modernize, reducing the need for rural residents.\n\n“The difference,” University of Montana historian David Emmons writes, “is that migration out of their rural areas does not mean migration out of the state.”\n\nThose states have industry and business and that can quell that flow from the rural to the cities out of state. “There are no cities in Montana large enough or economically diversified enough to absorb the state’s exiles.”\n\nEmmons wrote those words in an essay called “The Price of ‘Freedom’: Montana in the Late and Post-Anaconda Era.” It appeared in a 1995 book called Politics in the Postwar American West.\n\nThat should come as no surprise, as Emmons was a University of Montana historian from 1967 to 2004, a period of 37 years. Alas, during that time he only managed three books.\n\nHe tells us that Montanan’s identities have been shorn from them with these economic changes. People are what they do for a living, and when their job ends, so do they, in many different ways. “The principle defining elements of Montana,” Emmons writes, “are disappearing, victims of the postindustrial blues.”\n\nHere’s what Emmons says of the political changes this brought about:\n\n“Montana’s political progressives – still Democrats – are now to be found almost exclusively among deep thinkers in urban areas of the western half of the state. The Constitution of 1972, for example, passed despite the fact that forty-four counties voted against it. Of the twelve counties that support it, all were urban and nine were in the western district. The agenda of these new-style Democrats is different from the old; indeed many of the latter, including Marc Racicot, the present Republican governor, left the party – or were abandoned and left politically homeless by its new leaders.”\n\nI was surprised to learn that Racicot had been a Democrat, but you have to realize, the Democrats do such a good job of turning people away. Emmons explains how this often works, or doesn’t:\n\n“New Democrats favor postindustrial issues such as environmentalism and multiculturalism. Their tactics are different; they are more tendentious and confrontational. They are also more meticulous in their record keeping and much less likely to get out the cemetery vote. The old Democrats, however, sent James Murray, Mike Mansfield, and Lee Metcalf to the Senate. The new ones have yet to do so well.”\n\nComparing Democrats to Republicans, Emmons says that they “can be divided into farm/ranch conservatives and country club conservatives.”\n\nWe see this a lot in the state, and it’s only grown over the past two decades. “As some of the larger farms and ranches come to resemble country clubs, this dividing line becomes fuzzy.”\n\nA lot of it comes down to conservative principles. There was a time when Montana “could afford six university units, fifty-six counties, more school districts than California, a worker’s compensation law that was both solvent and compensatory.”\n\nEmmons was of course writing at a time when the state had $225 million in debt and a bankrupt worker’s comp fund.\n\nThat’s the thing with Republicans – they always leave government in a terrible state, with the treasury empty and the people worse off. This is a drawback of them always trying to benefit themselves at the expense of everyone else.\n\nIn Montana, politics was “both cause and effect of communal values. Politics formed communities and was formed by them.” This goes away “as some of the state’s towns deteriorate,” for “this communal function loses both its power to create and the source of its creation.”\n\nMontana Democrats are counting on this deterioration to carry them through to victory. The demographics say it all – the rural areas will depopulate and the urban areas will fill up.\n\nYou see this in Missoula, with too many Democrats for the available seats. You see this in rural areas, with not enough Democrats to even field a candidate at times.\n\nWill the legislature be Democratic in another decade or two? By that time our rural areas should have fallen off further, something that only benefits Democrats.\n\nSince the Democrats have no other plan to win over voters besides this, it’s fair to say they’ll stick to their current positions and wait.\n\nWill that be enough for them to keep the governor’s office in 2016? It’s hard to say, but it’s pretty clear the legislature will be lost to them again.\n\nUnless Republicans can figure out how to gain a firmer toehold in the urban areas, or decrease the mass exodus from the rural areas, this won’t always be the case.\n\nAnd that’s why we have the current intransigence of the Montana Democratic Party when it comes to listening to alienated and dispossessed voters.\n\nThey know they can do nothing, for waiting will eventually bring them the win. It might not taste like a win, but to the upper crust at the top, does it matter?\n\nMontana's timber industry is small, and always has been.\n\nLet's look at some real numbers concerning Montana’s timber industry, not numbers that came out of a hat.\n\nSpeaking of Montana’s timber industry in the early 20th century, or from roughly 1900 to 1940, historian Michael P. Malone had this to say in his book Montana: A History of Two Centuries:\n\n“By national standards, production was irregular and small. The slower-growing Rocky Mountain forests could not match the productive forests on the West Coat and in the South, and Montana output usually totaled only 250 to 400 million board feet per year.” (p 332)\n\nMontana’s output was only 1% of the nation’s total at that time, and the numbers make that clear.\n\nIn 1920 America produced 35 billion board feet. That was a huge increase from the 5 billion board feet that had been produced in 1850, but exactly the same as the 35 billion that was produced in 1900.\n\nThings heated up in the Roaring Twenties and production grew to 39.7 billion board feet in 1926 and then began to fall off. By 1930 it was down to 26.1 billion and in 1934 America was spitting out just 12.8 billion board feet a year.\n\nProfits didn’t follow the same trend. Numbers aren’t available for all years, but in 1926 the value of that production was $117 million, which was down from the $167 million of 1922. That fell to $110 million in 1930 and then rose to $202 million in 1932. The reduced supply was certainly driving up the price as the Depression wore on. A large part of this decline was companies shutting down, but it was also the rise of cement and steel products being used in place of wood.\n\n“Montana’s forest products industry has been neglected by historians,” Malone writes in the bibliography of his history, which was actually written with Richard B. Roeder and William L. Lang. Both Malone and Roeder worked at MSU – Malone was the president when this history was last updated in 1991 – while Lang was at the University of Washington. They touch upon forestry briefly, for just two pages in their 466-page book. Yes, it’s safe to say this area of our state has been neglected, and in more ways than one.\n\nForestry is an industry that’s hard to pin down through the decades. In 1930 there are no detailed numbers for jobs, and in fact forestry’s lumped in with other areas. By 1940 we get some good numbers, but again, there are discrepancies. Two numbers that are the same in both instances where they’re reported are agriculture, forestry and fishing – non-manufacturing, with 146 people, and lumbermen, raftsmen and woodchoppers with 712 people. Altogether that gives us anywhere from 1,187 to 1,826 people working in the forestry and wood products industry in the 1940s in Montana, a difference of 639 people.\n\nStill, forestry is an area that wasn’t a very large part of Montana’s economy. Even in 1930 it’d only been 1.38%, and that when it was combined with fishing. By 1950 there were only 838 sawmill laborers, according to the U.S. Census report for that year. Don't think that was the War, either - in 1940 there were just 914. In 1950 there were 865 lumbermen, raftsmen and wood choppers. In 1940 there were 712.\n\nMontana’s Timber Industry, 1950 to 1980\n\nBy 1950 things had improved, and by that I mean they’re not being reported twice anymore. Still, if you compare numbers in the 1950 Census to numbers in the 1940 Census, they’re still off at times. In 1950 in Montana there were 734 sawmills, planning mills & miscellaneous wood products workers. That was a jump of 98% over the 294 reported in 1940. Additionally, there were 865 lumbermen, raftsmen and woodchoppers and 839 sawmill laborers.\n\nAltogether that gives us 2,438 people in the forestry and wood products industry. Comparing percentages we see that from 1940 to 1950 the industry grew by more than 205%. Still, it didn’t employ anywhere near how many workers we like to think it did while looking back today, nor did it challenge other industries. After all, there were 3,057 waiters and waitresses in 1950. Then again, there were also 4,610 carpenters. This brings up another question, should they be counted too? After all, it’s a good bet much of the wood chopped in Montana was then used by other industries in Montana, such as carpentry. Should that figure into our calculations? For Malone I believe they do.\n\nAfter the war Montana’s timber industry took off by all accounts. There was a building boom going on as Americans got their fair share of the American Dream. Home building across the nation took off and Montana was no different. There was a huge demand in timber, and Malone makes it clear what this meant:\n\n“Montana’s forests of fir, spruce, and lodgepole and ponderosa pine, which had always been of generally marginal commercial value, began to attract more and more loggers. By 1948, there were 434 mills, most of them small, operating in the state. Employment in the wood products industry shot upward, to 5,374 in 1950 to 7,150 in 1955. The boom decreased during the late 1950s, and many of the smaller operators closed down. But by then, big-time investors had begun to develop a truly diversified wood products industry in Montana.” (p 333)\n\nI wish I could figure out where Malone’s getting that 5,374 number for the number employed in this industry. I’m not seeing that anywhere. I guess it’s what you say goes into this industry, and he must be counting the secondary jobs. When I count I get less than 2,500 souls making their living in the timber industry in Montana in 1950.\n\nMissoula got a new timber products operation in 1957, one that could help bolster the mills of Bonner. It was Waldorf Paper Products company and their decision to open a pulp mill on the city’s west side. The mill cost $6 million to put in and paid out $1.5 million a year in wages. In 1959 Hoerner Boxes, a firm located out of Iowa, obtained a quarter interest in the company and in 1960 that went up to 50%. The name was changed to Waldorf-Heorner, and this change also brought the first paper machines to the mill.\n\nThe surrounding timber operations benefited as the company stabilized the ups and downs of their operations with a steady stream of work. It was an economic success, but an environmental step back. With those jobs also came an immense amount of air pollution from the operations.\n\nBy 1969 the mill had undergone its second strike, the first lasting 11 hours the second two weeks. This resulted in pay going from $3.67 an hour to $4 an hour. “Hoerner-Waldorf’s pulp and paper enterprise brought hundreds of new jobs to the Missoula area,” Malone writes, “and helped make that city the Montana boomtown of the 1960s.”\n\nTimber in Montana in the 1960s was centered around western Montana, particularly Missoula and Libby, though Christmas tree farms grew up around the Flathead and pole cutting operations grew up around various areas of the state. The industry expanded and diversified, but it wasn’t enough to help it weather the storms to come.\n\nIn 1977 Champion International came in and bought up the mill while also paying for expansions. The total cost was $170 million. Things went south with these new owners, and in July of 1981 there was a two week strike by the United Paper Workers International and then in September work schedules were curtailed.\n\nMontana’s timber had always been considered sub-par commercially, and the boom cycle of the 1950s finally went bust in 1970. In 1968 just 1.5 million board feet were produced in the state. There were small gains in 1983-4 in Montana and the country, but that typically came with consolidations as the industry became more automated and less manpower-driven. It was the story of the mines all over again.\n\nThe Montana Timber Industry, 1980 to 2011\n\nBy 1985 Champion decided to pull out and sold the plant to Stone Container Corp. of Chicago for $457 million. Despite soaring production levels in the late-1980s, the Montana timber industry actually lost jobs. The high point for the Montana timber industry had been 1978 with 13,400 but by 1988 there were 11,130. By 1990 Wood and paper products made up 15% of western Montana’s economy, up from the 10% it had been in the early 1970s. This is what Malone says:\n\n“Perhaps more than any of Montana’s other extractive industries, it is extremely vulnerable, not only to foreign competition, particularly from British Columbia, but also to problems of supply. Environmentalists and wilderness advocates have heavily criticized clear-cutting and below-cost timber sales on National forest lands. As those groups have gained nationwide support, lumbermen have found that they are less able to secure adequate supplies of wood for their mills.” (p 334)\n\nYou can get modern Montana forestry industry numbers from “Montana Forest Products Industry: Slow to Recover,” a report put out in 2012 by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Montana. This is what one graph in that document looks like:\n\nIn the early 1980s Montana’s Wood Products Industry was getting below $600 million a year in total sales. That rose in the late 1980s to $900 million and then shot up to over $1.3 billion in the mid-1990s. In the early 2000s that fell off to around $1 billion a year and then rose again around 2004 to about $1.2 billion. After that a steady decline set in, one that saw sales plummet to around $314 million by 2011. Sales were down $670 million from before the recession.\n\nTimber harvests in Montana of course reacted accordingly. In the early 1980s the state was putting out just over 900 million board feet a year. By the mid-1990s that rose to over 1.2 billion board feet but then fell off to about 348 million by 2011. Those are the lowest harvest levels since 1945.\n\nIn 2011 there were 6,530 workers in the Montana forestry industry, which was down 3% from 2010 when there had been 6,743 workers. Those workers in 2011 made $256 million in wages. Still, Timber harvests are down 25% since 1989.\n\nWhat is causing this? The lack of demand is a big one. The closure of the Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. was a hit. And then there’s federal lands, which many think will help. The problem is that they supply just a quarter of the mill lumber. By the 1990s, the federal government owned 12 million of Montana’s 17.3 million acres of forestland, but that’s how people want it.\n\nSo we get back to construction starts, of which there were just 630,000 in 2011. For a time it looked like construction starts in China might help, but they want logs not lumber. So that brings us to our current situation, and it’s not really good…but for whom?\n\nFor Montana timbermen, it’s bad. But for our huge recreation and tourist industry, it’s good. We know tourism employs more, and when we get to the numbers, we’ll prove they earn more.\n\nOr did you think that’s just a load of rubbish?\n\nFine, but before you visited this site, how much did you know of the state’s timber history?\n\nConclusion\n\nSo what will happen? Montana’s wood products and timber industry will continue to remain a marginal part of the economy. It’ll continue to take very little from federal lands and it’ll continue to be an afterthought to the forest behemoths of the West Coast and the South. And the industry will never stop resenting this.\n\nThat’s fine – Montana has a whole collection of dead industries that harken back to our pioneer days, or nation-building days, and the days we now look back on in shame. Timber isn’t Montana’s future, it’s its past.\n\nMontana will become a tourist state. Nay, it already is, but what it must strive to become is a unionized tourist state. Montana isn’t California and it isn’t Florida. It’s not Idaho and it’s not Washington. When you come here you see things you won’t see anywhere else and memories are made that can’t be made anywhere else. That’s a price worth paying, and when you come to Montana, you will.\n\nWe care about our workers here, our 100,000+ strong tourism industry, the face of our tourist industry. Without the folks making beds and serving meals and guiding travelers, there’d be no tourism industry in this state. And never forget that they’re coming to see the trees still standing, not the fields where they once stood.\n\nMontana’s timber industry has a long and proud history in the state, but it’s just that, and will remain forevermore, a history."
