        "text": "Special Elections Report: Montana\n\nBy Juliana Gruenwald\n\nCQ Staff Writer\n\nDemocrats find themselves playing defense in Montana in 1996.\n\nThe state's lone House seat is up for grabs with the retirement of nine-term Democratic Rep. Pat Williams. Democratic Sen. Max Baucus is running for a fourth term and could face a tough Republican challenge.\n\nComing out of 1994, the state's Democrats had much cause for concern. They suffered huge losses that year in the state legislature and failed to unseat Republican Sen. Conrad Burns, who had captured a Democratic-held seat in 1988. Williams had to scrap to hold on to his House seat, winning with a 49 percent plurality.\n\nWilliams was sure to face another tough bid in 1996, and his decision to retire makes this seat even more competitive for Republicans.\n\nWhile they fight to save the Senate and House seats, Democrats face little prospect of upsetting popular Republican Gov. Marc Racicot, who is running for a second four-year term.\n\nRacicot, who is moderate by the Montana Republicans' conservative standards, is favored to fend off a primary challenger from the right: University of Montana law professor Rob Natelson. He is also not expected to have trouble in the fall against the Democrats' choice, former state Sen. Chet Blaylock.\n\nSENATE\n\nThe GOP's recent successes in Montana inspired national Republican strategists to make Baucus one of their top 1996 Senate targets.\n\nThree Republicans are running for the chance to take on Baucus in the fall. The early front-runner is Lt. Gov. Dennis Rehberg, who got into the race last year after Racicot decided against taking on Baucus himself. Also running are businessman Ed Borcherdt and former state Sen. John K. \"Jack\" McDonald.\n\nRehberg's most significant competition will probably come from Borcherdt, who says he will use his own money to help fund his campaign if needed. Borcherdt says the state needs a businessman in the Senate instead of career politicians like Rehberg and Baucus.\n\nBut Borcherdt will have to deflect questions about his residency. He only recently moved back to the state from California, where he had lived for many years.\n\nRehberg is backed by Racicot and some other top GOP officials and has kept his focus on Baucus. He alleges that Baucus has waffled on issues such as gun control, the balanced- budget amendment and the Interior Department program to re- introduce grey wolves to their former habitats in the West.\n\nBaucus describes himself as politically independent. On the balanced-budget amendment, for example, Baucus says he decided to vote for it - after opposing it in the past - because efforts to reduce spending have not worked. He says the amendment is a way to instill budget discipline.\n\nThe race has yet to capture much attention, and polling has shown Baucus with a comfortable lead. Still, he is taking the race seriously, building a hefty campaign bankroll. He also has embarked on a walk across the state, a tactic he used in his first bid for the House, where he served from 1975 to 1978.\n\nCandidates from the Natural Law Party, which is derived from the Transcendental Meditation movement, and the Reform Party, which was established by 1992 independent presidential candidate Ross Perot, also will be running in the fall contest.\n\nOne Reform Party contender, Becky Shaw, has already had an impact on state politics. She received 21 percent of the vote after making a late entry into the 1994 Democratic Senate primary.\n\nBut it is unclear whether Shaw would draw votes from Baucus or the Republican candidate in the general election. Perot did well among Republicans in Montana in 1992, a factor that could hurt the Republican Senate candidate if his supporters are drawn to the Reform Party line, said Craig Wilson, a political science professor at Montana State University.\n\nIn any case, Shaw must first get past retired railroad worker Webb Sullivan in a primary for the Reform Party nomination.\n\nHOUSE\n\nAt large\n\nUnless it appears that Baucus is truly threatened this fall, the Senate contest may be overshadowed by an open-seat House race that is sure to be a partisan brawl.\n\nThe western half of Montana, which was represented by Williams before the state's two House seats were merged into one for the 1992 election, has an industrial history and a Democratic tradition. Montana's rural eastern half, which had been represented by conservative Republican Ron Marlenee (1977- 93), is better territory for Republicans.\n\nAfter reapportionment took away one of Montana's two House seats, Williams and Marlenee ran against each other in 1992 for political survival. Williams won by 3 percentage points. Though he fell short of a majority in 1994, he stretched his victory margin to 7 percentage points against Republican Cy Jamison, a former Bush administration official.\n\nDemocratic officials hoping to hold on to this big prize were disappointed when several Democratic statewide officials, viewed as among the party's best prospects, chose not to run to succeed Williams.\n\nYet four Democrats ended up filing for the seat. They are former Environmental Protection Agency regional director Bill Yellowtail, state Sen. Mignon Waterman, Yellowstone County auditor Leo Hudetz and lawyer Larry Jent.\n\nYellowtail, a member of the Crow Indian tribe and former state senator, made a late entry into the race but has garnered much media attention. Yellowtail appears to have the edge in the primary at this point, given the support he has from some party insiders and his appeal in the state's American Indian communities, which traditionally deliver a strong Democratic vote.\n\nThree Republicans, meanwhile, had been gearing up for a potential race against Williams since the summer of 1995. Burns' former top state aide, Dwight MacKay, is backed by the senator and has led his GOP competitors in fundraising and in some recent polls.\n\nBut MacKay's GOP opponents, businessman Rick Hill and environmental consultant and rancher Alan Mikkelsen are not without their own connections. Hill is a former state party chairman, and his wife serves as Lt. Gov. Rehberg's chief of staff. Mikkelsen has been endorsed by Marlenee.\n\nCopyright 1996, Congressional Quarterly Inc.
