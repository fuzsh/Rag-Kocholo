        "text": "John Jay Rauk, age 67, passed away suddenly on Tuesday, July 12 while relaxing on his couch after a busy day of landscaping. He had many job adventures over his 67 years, but was respected for his “tell it like it is” take on life. John had such diverse interests over the years, working for Ron Marlenee as a legislative aide in Washington, D.C., to being a dynamite expert in Glacier Park, and in Columbia Falls, working for Royal Logging. He is perhaps best known to the community as the “insurance guy”. John is survived by his wife Debra Rauk of Lakeside, MT; mother Meg Rauk of Bigfork, MT; daughter Erika Rauk of Big Sky, MT; and son Tanner Rauk, his wife Kelly and their children Stella and Augustus of Missoula, MT. Brother, James Rauk and wife Donna of Post Falls, ID; sister, Kristi Sandahl and husband John Wesley, their daughter Jessica Brown and family; his mother-in-law Leona Hileman and her daughters Vicki and Kay Hileman. Along with other family and friends.\n\nJohn was born in Missoula Montana, raised in Whitefish and Tucson, AZ moving with his family for his father’s jobs as a University instructor. He first met his mother-in-law at the age of seven after pulling flowers out of her front yard. Leona caught him red-handed and gave him the first of many scolding’s over the years. After the flower episode, John’s family moved to Tucson, AZ. His years in Tucson included many adventures with his younger sister, Kristi and brother Jim. With some trial and error, shed burning, broken furniture, and lots of bandages he and his brother learned how to fix and weld any cheap weed-eater, lawnmower, and eventually all the vehicles they could get their hands to convert into their adventure rigs or the gadget of their dreams. Later, John fixed up an old red jeep and on college holidays would travel to Mexico to tow the joy riding students off the beach, for a price of course. Eventually, he made his way back to Glacier National Park during his college summer breaks, as a trail crew leader. Many of the trails, bridges, and the techniques used in the park to blast snow off the trails were built, maintained, and developed by John during his years at the park. John met Deb while both were working at Glacier Park. Deb was his “love at first sight” from across a volleyball net. John spiked the ball Deb’s way, as often as possible. This chance meeting advanced into 38 years of love, all sorts of adventures, children, hard work, and being Mr. Fix It, “Tim the Tool Man Taylor” style. John found adventures around every corner, that are now our laughter filled campfire stories. John found in retirement everything he had wished for and much more. He particularly enjoyed the valuable time he spent with his grandchildren, using the rider lawnmower to keep up with the kids on their electric 4-wheelers, cuddles, storytelling, building toys and sand boxes, and all the little adventures. He was such a proud father and grandfather. John always said “his best accomplishment in life were his children”. As Husband, Dad, Grandpa, Brother, and Friend, he will be missed beyond belief and loved fiercely. For those wanting to celebrate his life, a memorial service will be held at the Buffalo Hill Funeral Home, on Friday, July 22 nd at 2:00 pm. to send a note of condolence to the family please visit www.buffalohillfh.com . Buffalo Hill Funeral Home and Crematory is caring for the family.\n\nTo order"
