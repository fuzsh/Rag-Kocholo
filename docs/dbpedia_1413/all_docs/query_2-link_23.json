ACTION: Final rule. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES or the Convention) regulates international trade in certain animals and plants. Species for which such trade is controlled are listed in Appendices I, II, and III to the Convention. The countries participating in this treaty, including the United States, have adopted species amendments to Appendices I and II. The United States did not enter a reservation on any of these listing amendments approved at the eighth meeting of the Conference of the Parties. This document incorporates these amendments into the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's regulations implementing the Convention. DATES: The amendments set forth in this rule entered into effect and became enforceable on June 11, 1992, under the terms of the Convention. Therefore, this rule is effective August 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please send correspondence concerning this document to Chief, Office of Scientific Authority; Mail stop: Room 725, Arlington Square Building; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; 1849 C St., NW.; Washington, DC 20240; fax number 703-358-2276. Express and messenger deliveries should be addressed to the Office of Scientific Authority; 4401 North Fairfax Drive, room 750; Arlington, Virginia 22203. Materials received will be available for public inspection by appointment, from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Monday through Friday at the above address in Arlington, Virginia (room 750). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Charles W. Dane, Chief, Office of Scientific Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, at telephone 703-358-1708. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Convention regulates import, export, re-export, and introduction from the sea of certain animal and plant species. Species for which trade is controlled are included in three appendices. Their inclusion in Appendix I or II is by agreement of CITES Party countries. Appendix I include species threatened with extinction that are or may be affected by trade. Appendix II includes species that although not necessarily now threatened with extinction may become so unless trade in them is strictly controlled. It also lists species that must be subject to regulation in order that trade in other currently or potentially threatened species may be brought under effective control (e.g., because of difficulty in distinguishing specimens of the currently or potentially threatened species from the specimens of other species). Appendix III includes species that any Party country unilaterally designates as being subject to regulation within its jurisdiction for purposes of restricting or preventing exploitation, and for which cooperation of other Parties is needed to control trade. Any CITES Party may propose amendments to Appendices I and II for consideration at meetings of the Conference of the Parties. The text of proposals must be communicated to the CITES Secretariat at least 150 days before a meeting. The Secretariat must then consult the other Parties and appropriate intergovernmental agencies, and communicate responses to all Parties no later than 30 days before the meeting. Amendments are adopted by consensus or a two-thirds majority of the Parties present and voting. Actions of the Parties The eighth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES was held on March 2-13, 1992, in Kyoto, Japan. At the meeting (COP8), the Parties considered 81 different proposals to amend the appendices for animals and 27 different proposals for plants. The 108 proposals were described in earlier Federal Register notice; and addressed in the Federal Register on March 4, 1992, for proposals submitted by the United States (57 FR 7719) and by other Parties (57 FR 7713). the proposals that were approved by this Conference of the Parties were announced in a May 13, 1993, Federal Register notice (57 FR 20443); note this clarifying correction to 57 FR 20445, that the Anthracoceros spp. (hornbills) also were proposed for addition to Appendix II by the Netherlands (and approved). As also announced in that May 13, 1992, notice, some proposals were withdrawn by their proponents or rejected by the Parties. That notice (57 FR 20443) requested comments from the public on whether the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) should recommend that the United States enter reservations on any of the listing amendments. The effect of a reservation would be to exempt this country from completely implementing the Convention for the particular species. More comprehensive discussions of any practical effects of entering a reservation and reasons for or against entering reservations are contained in November 22, 1985, and December 15, 1989, Federal Register notices (50 FR 48212 and 54 FR 51432, respectively). Changes to the CITES appendices as a result of the eighth meeting of the Conference of the Parties that are incorporated into the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations are printed as the conclusion of this notice. Related Considerations Namibia and Zimbabwe proposed to transfer the cheetak (Acinonyx jubatus) populations of Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe from Appendix I to Appendix II, with export quotas. In the March 4, 1992, Federal Register (57 FR 7713), the United States opposed this amendment, since the Service had not received the proponents' supporting statement from the CITES Secretariat prior to COP8. The proposal was redrafted at COP8 as a resolution [see Doc. 8.22 (Rev.)] retaining the species in Appendix I and establishing the following quotas (for trophies and skins: 2 per person): Botswana, 5; Namibia, 100; and Zimbabwe, 50. However, such a resolution was deemed to be unnecessary, and the quotas have been reflected in the Secretariat's annotations to the appendices. The original proposal to transfer the sub-Saharana population of leopards (Panthera pardus) from Appendix I to appendix II, with export quotas, was redrafted as a revision of resolution Conf. 7.7, with the quotas (for trophies and skins: 2 per person) increased for Malawi (50) and South Africa (75), and initiated (new quota) for Namibia (100). the Service supports the continuation of this quota system for leopard trophies and skins for personal use as previously provided for in resolution Conf. 7.7 and now in Conf. 8.10. Resolution Conf. 8.18 adopted a nomenclatorial reference as a guideline for cacti (Cactaceae); therefore, several less familiar names are added to the existing listings. Also, by an amendment at COP5 and Resolution Conf. 6.18, the flasked artificially propagated seedlings of all Appendix II species are excluded from regulation. Resolution Conf. 8.17(c), by interpretation of CITES Article VII(4) and Article I(b)(iii), exempts the flasked artificially propagated seedlings of Appendix I orchid species (details are in the March 4, 1992, Federal Register; 57 FR 7774). A subsequent postal-procedures amendment also addresses this topic (details are in the November 6, 1992, Federal Register; 57 FR 53090). All the flasked artificially propagated orchid seedlings (Orchidaceae) thus are not regulated by CITES. Comments Received and U.S. Decisions The Service received 26 public comments in response to the May 13, 1992, Federal Register notice: one requested that the United States enter a reservation on the listing of the American black bear (Ursus americanus); one requested the entering of a reservation on the listing of the paddlefish (Polyodon spathula); and 24 expressed concern over the permitting consequence for pre-CITES specimens from the listing of Brazilian rosewood (Dalbergia nigra). The International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies urged the United States to take a reservation on the listing of the American black bear in Appendix II, which had been for reasons of similarity of appearance [CITES Article II(2)(b)]. At the eighth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES, the other Party countries recognized that the North American black bear populations are not threatened by trade, but the sale of undocumented gall bladders threatens the existence of Asian bear species that are listed in Appendix I. With either an Appendix II or Appendix III listing of the American black bear, all the parts of bears in international trade require CITES documentation, thus eliminating undocumented parts from legitimately entering the trade. Although the U.S. delegation felt that Canada's previous listing of this species in Appendix III was adequate, the action by the Parties in listing this black bear in Appendix II may help to reduce the illegal trade in the similar-appearing parts of endangered bears. Former Congressman Ron Marlenee of Montana requested that the United States enter a reservation on the listing of the paddlefish in Appendix II. He contended that the listing would seriously jeopardize a non-profit paddlefish roe operation in Montana. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's North Central Regional Office (Region 6) had prepared a proposal to add this species to Appendix I of CITES. The United States submitted the proposal to the CITES Secretariat to include the paddlefish in Appendix I, but with a notation that the Service was seeking additional information, and might revise the proposal to recommend listing in Appendix II. The United States ultimately did change to propose that the paddlefish be included in Appendix II, inasmuch as an Appendix II listing allows for legitimate exports determined not to be detrimental to the survival of the species, yet imposes the same penalties for violations of the requirements for export from the United States, and establishes the same trade-reporting conditions as an Appendix I listing. The Service received 24 comments within the comment period about Brazilian rosewood (Dalbergia nigra). Nearly all supported the listing of this species in Appendix I, and none requested a reservation, but all expressed concern about CITES regulation of the already acquired wood of this tree presently embodied in musical instruments, especially guitars. The commenters were from the music industry (including associations, periodical publishers, a computer bulletin-board network, etc.); dealers especially in vintage guitars and including guitar-show producers; and manufacturers of stringed musical instruments (luthiers), especially of guitars. CITES provides a personal-effects exemption for such items that an international traveler exports and then imports when returning home, although it may be useful to declare the item to U.S. Customs at export to facilitate its re-entry. First, as a precaution, travelers should determine whether the countries to which they are going allow this CITES exemption. For international commercial trade (export and re-export), CITES requires certification that parts and derivatives of the species were acquired before June 11, 1992 (i.e., that the wood is pre-Convention). Over the last several centuries and especially in this century (until 1970), most guitars (as well as several other fretted musical instruments such as banjos, basses, mandolins, and ukuleles) have been comprised of some to much Brazilian rosewood, and many of these musical instruments are in international commerce. The Service reviewed Brazil's proposal to include Dalbergia nigra (the Brazilian rosewood) in Appendix I. The species occurs naturally only in fragmented populations in remnants of the Mata Atlantica (Atlantic Coast Tropical Rainforest) of Brazil. A substantial amount of new information and data on trade in the wood of this species were received from persons in the music industry. The United States continues to agree that the species in the wild needs strong conservation measures, and did not enter a reservation on the listing of the species in Appendix I. The United States has had experience in the pre-CITES certification of articles (including musical instruments) with elephant ivory, tortoise shell, or hard coral, and will continue to endeavor to make the pre-CITES certification process efficient. Procedural Requirements This Federal Register notice simply implements changes in the list of species in the Convention's appendices that have already been approved by the Conference of the Parties at their eighth meeting, and that the United States is bound to accept unless it entered reservations. The Service does not believe that implementation of any of these adopted amendments would be contrary to the interests or laws of the United States. The period of time during which the United States could have entered a reservation on any of these amendments ended on June 10, 1992. The Service did not recommend the entry of any reservations, and none were taken by the United States. Therefore, these amendments to the CITES Appendices have been in effect for the United States since June 11, 1992. This notice brings the information in 50 CFR 23.23(f) into agreement with the current species listings in the CITES appendices. Earlier Federal Register notices informed the public about these amendments and provided opportunity for comment on them, and they were included in a public meeting on May 26, 1992 (see the May 11, 1992, Federal Register, 57 FR 20126). Therefore, the Department of the Interior has determined that good cause exists for making this rule effective upon its date of publication [5 U.S.C. 553(d)]. Accordingly, paragraph (f) of Sec. 23.23 of 50 CFR has been amended at the conclusion of this rule. The Department has determined that amendments to the Convention's appendices, which result from actions of the Parties to the Convention, did not require the preparation of Environmental Assessments as defined under authority of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347). This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) does not apply to this listing process. This final rule does not contain information-collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An editorial clarification for 50 CFR 23.23(f) under Class Aves (Birds) in the Order Psittaciformes (Parrots, etc.) emphasizes that Psittacula krameri (rose-ringed or ring-necked parakeet) remains in Appendix III and was not included in Appendix II in 1981 at the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties. This document was prepared by Drs. Charles W. Dane, Richard M. Mitchell, and Bruce MacBryde, Office of Scientific Authority, under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. and 87 Stat. 884, as amended).
