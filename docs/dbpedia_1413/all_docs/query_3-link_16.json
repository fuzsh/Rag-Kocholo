        "text": "EDITOR’S NOTE: Superiorland Yesterdays is prepared by the reference staff at the Peter White Public Library in Marquette.\n\n30 years ago\n\nMUNISING — A congressional subcommittee inserted two minor amendments to a bill introduced by U.S. Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Flint, that would turn Grand Island into a National Recreation Area under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. The House Agriculture Subcommittee on Forests, Family Farms, and Energy included language which would require the U.S. Forest Service to consult with the state of Michigan before closing off any part of the 13,000-acre Munising Bay island to fishing, hunting, or trapping. The amendment was offered by U.S. Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Montana. The second change would affect the Grand Isle Advisory Commission, a 12-member board which would advise the secretary of Agriculture on Grand Island’s management plan. The three Forest Service members would serve in an ex-officio capacity, meaning they would be non-voting members of the commission. On Tuesday, the subcommittee passed the amended bill unanimously. The full Agriculture Committee should consider the measure in about two weeks. It still needs approval by the full Appropriations and Agriculture committees before it can be considered by the full House and then the U.S. Senate. Should the bill become law, the island would be purchased from The Trust for Public Land in October for $3.5 million.\n\n60 years ago\n\nST IGNACE — Mackinac Bridge will be gaily bedecked with red, white, and blue lights over the Fourth of July weekend in a combined salute to Independence Day, the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, and the passing of the queen Elizabeth under the bridge in the Royal Yacht, according to Prentiss M. Brown, St. Ignace, chairman of the Mackinac Bridge Authority. “It will be a colorful sight for holiday visitors to the area to see ‘Mighty Mac’ gleaming at night like a lighted American flag across the dark blue waters of the Mackinac Straights,” Brown said. The lights will stretch for nearly two miles on cables which reach a height of 552 feet on the tallest towers of the bridge. At night, the lights of the bridge can be seen for 20 miles from Michigan’s Upper or Lower Peninsulas. When the bridge authority decided to salute Queen Elizabeth, inquiries were made directly to Buckingham Palace as to the color of lights which the Queen would prefer. The authority was told that the traditional American colors would be preferred. The Queen will pass under the Mackinac Bridge on the royal yacht Britannia about noon on Sunday, July 5, en route to Chicago. On her return trip the royal yacht will pass under the bridge about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, July 8. Thousands of residents and visitors to the Northern Michigan and Upper Peninsula areas are expected to line the shores to get their first view of Queen Elizabeth, first member of the royalty ever to pass through the area."
