        "text": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve Program is now 30 years old. With the stroke of a pen on Dec. 23, 1985, President Ronald Reagan committed the nation to a program that removed millions of acres of farmland from production and now serves as the United States' largest voluntary wildlife conservation program.\n\nHowever, that's not how the program was originally envisioned.\n\nThe CRP was crafted from the convergence of two separate agriculture crises. Soil conservation and cropland productivity was an issue of concern going back to the 1930s, when drought and severe dust storms stripped the land of its life-giving topsoil.\n\nFrom the “Dirty 30’s” onward, Congress enacted a series of programs directed toward preserving the vitality of U.S. cropland. But while soil conservation was a critical motivator for the Conservation Reserve Program’s inclusion within the 1985 Farm Bill, the driving political force behind its passage was an economic crisis on American farms unlike anything seen since the Great Depression.\n\nIn the early 1970s, global demand for American agricultural products exploded, largely driven to a large degree by a multi-year deal with the Soviets for the purchase of U.S. wheat and feed grains. Between 1972 and 1974, wheat prices doubled and corn prices tripled. U.S. farmers were encouraged to plant “fence row to fence row” to meet global demand, and in the processes plowed up many of the gains in soil conservation made over the preceding 40 years.\n\nTo take advantage of the record high commodity prices, many American farmers borrowed heavily to buy the land, equipment and other agricultural inputs required to expand their operations. Rising interest rates followed.\n\nIn 1976, the average prime lending rate in the United States was 6.8 percent. By 1981 it had ballooned to 21.5 percent; a rate higher than anything since the Civil War. Though the early 1970s were profitable years for American farmers, world events soon intervened.\n\nThe price of oil and gas skyrocketed after the OPEC embargo of 1973 and the cost of farming followed suit. In January 1980, President Jimmy Carter halted the export of 17 million tons of U.S. grain to the Soviet Union in response to the Soviet Army’s invasion of Afghanistan. Grain prices collapsed, and thousands of already financially distressed farm families defaulted on their loans. Many were forced off the land.\n\nFarmers in the Midwest from Montana to Arkansas also faced an environmental crisis.\n\n“It was dry, dry, dry,” Bruce Nelson recalled.\n\nToday Nelson serves as executive director of the Montana Farm Service Administration. In the early 1980s, he was chairman of the Montana Democratic Party and vice-president of Triangle N Farms, his family’s grain growing operation outside Fort Benton.\n\n“There was a lot of land being broken up on the plains back then, especially in central Montana,” Nelson said. “A lot of it was marginal land. Unfortunately, with the dry years and the conventional tilling methods that producers had available to them at that time, inevitably that land started to blow.”\n\nThe United States’ farm economy was facing disaster, but during his first term in office President Ronald Reagan opposed any increase in farm subsidies. Thousands of farmers across the country protested in the streets. One rally in Ames, Iowa, attracted 16,000 people. South Dakota sent its entire delegation of 105 state legislators to Washington D.C. to lobby for relief.\n\nMontana’s congressional delegation was strategically placed to influence the debate. Sen. John Melcher was a senior member of the Senate Ag Committee. Rep. Ron Marlenee sat on the House Ag Committee. Both men played important roles in crafting the original Conservation Reserve Program.\n\nTwo days before Christmas, Reagan signed into law the 1985 Farm Bill, which authorized Congress to pay farmers up to $40 per acre per year throughout the length of a 10- or 15-year contract. In essence, the public rented the land from the farmers to ensure it was taken out of production.\n\n“The CRP program was intended to accomplish more than one purpose,” Nelson said. “First, to give farmers a tool to take highly erodible land out of production and get a handle on the wind erosion; but also to help stabilize and possibly increase commodity prices.”\n\nThe original CRP contained no language identifying wildlife conservation as a major objective of the program. Yet the set aside of millions of acres of farmland, however marginal, began to produce measurable gains in wildlife populations almost immediately.\n\nDave Nomsen moved to South Dakota in 1974 as an undergraduate student studying biology. He arrived at a time when the state’s populations of grey partridge, ring-necked pheasant and ruffed grouse were crashing. Both wildlife managers and state politicians began voicing real concern that upland gamebirds could disappear from the South Dakotan landscape all together.\n\n“It was pretty dire,” Nomsen recalled. “In the mid-1970s, you had record low bird populations in many states.”\n\nBird hunters and conservationists across the Midwest were observing a recurrent pattern; the intensive farming practices of the 1960s and 1970s resulted in extensive prairie grassland habitat loss, followed by rapid declines in bird populations.\n\nIn 1982, a small group of Minnesota pheasant hunters saw that same connection and came together to form Pheasants Forever, a nonprofit conservation organization dedicated to preserving upland gamebird habitat. Today Nomsen serves as Pheasants Forever’s vice-president of governmental affairs.\n\n“They put in some very good but frankly pretty small programs to try and reverse the trend,” Nomsen said of early local efforts to preserve gamebird habitat. “That quickly became overshadowed by CRP. The Conservation Reserve Program was all about price support and commodity supply control, but without even the word ‘wildlife’ in the legislation it dramatically changed the landscape. The impact in terms of birds was nothing short of incredible.”\n\nBy the late 1980s, the worst of the farm crisis had passed, and the CRP’s focus began to shift from agricultural production to natural resource and wildlife conservation. The list of lands eligible for enrollment was expanded to include pastures converted to wetlands, and croplands that weren’t necessarily “highly erodible” were also made eligible because of their wildlife or water quality features.\n\n“It had gotten started as a program oriented toward wind erosion,” Nelson said. “By the mid-1990s, it evolved into a program for other benefits such as wildlife. Policy makers both in Congress and within the Clinton administration came to see the CRP as an opportunity to enroll land that could be more focused on the protection of watersheds.”\n\nThe program became far more targeted, with fewer whole-farm enrollments and the implementation of specific conservation initiatives like the Farmable Wetlands Program and State Acres For Wildlife Enhancement.\n\nThe CRP is now generally recognized as a major contributor in reducing nitrogen and phosphorus runoff into sensitive waterways like the Chesapeake Bay and Florida’s Everglades. It also is credited with helping to save endangered species like the Louisiana black bear and the northern bobwhite quail.\n\nHowever praise for the CRP is not universal. Critics express dislike for a federal spending program that essentially pays U.S. farmers billions of dollars annually to produce nothing.\n\n“Personally, I didn’t like the program,” said Knud Grosen. “I never participated, and I never wanted it because I didn’t like it.”\n\nNow in his 80s, Grosen is a life-long wheat farmer from the Big Sandy area. In the mid-1980s, Grosen served as president of the Montana Grain Growers Association. He admits the CRP was successful in getting a handle on soil erosion, but argues it also makes it more difficult for young people to get started on a farm of their own, and contributes to declining populations in rural communities.\n\n“A lot of people who were close to retirement put their land into conservation reserve,” Grosen said. “They took it easy from then on. They didn’t have to do anything. Consequently there was less land to be rented or to be bought. It caused a lot of young people to leave the community. It was bad for rural America.”\n\nMany small-town business owners are also critical of the CRP.\n\nWhile the program is financially beneficial to individual farmers, when cropland is taken out of production, it reduces the demand for seed, fertilizer, diesel, farm equipment and other products and services associated with the agriculture economy.\n\nNomsen argues such criticisms are misplaced, and that, in fact, the CRP has been an economic stimulus for struggling small-town rural economies.\n\n“CRP is a primary factor as to why South Dakota realizes nearly a quarter billion dollars annually in economic benefits just from upland gamebird hunting,” he said. “For the large majority of hunters, it isn’t a trip without visiting small rural cafes, without staying in the little motels that are out there, without stopping into a local event or a local store to pick up supplies. That’s just part of the experience. CRP is visible and it’s easy to point at, but I think it’s a criticism that the program does not deserve.”\n\nThe high water mark for the CRP came in 2007 when total enrollment in the program reached 36.8 million acres nationwide — an area larger than New York state. Rental outlays that year exceeded $1.9 billion and accounted for around 8 percent of all federal agriculture expenditures.\n\nIn Montana that year, more than 3.48 million acres were enrolled in the CRP.\n\nThe 2008 Farm Bill reauthorized the CRP, but Congress set a downward trend to the program capping maximum enrolled acreages at 32 million. That cap is set to continue to decline to 24 million acres by 2018.\n\nIn Montana, CRP enrollments have dropped by more than 60 percent in the last eight years. As of August 2015, just 1.35 million acres of Montana cropland, range and pasture was in the CRP, an enrollment low not seen since the first three years of the program.\n\nAccording to Nelson, one of the reasons for the declining interest in the CRP has been relatively stable commodity prices.\n\n“The price of wheat is what drives interest in CRP in Montana historically,” Nelson said. “With low wheat prices in the mid-1980s and low wheat prices in the late 1990s there was high interest in CRP. Ever since the peak in 2007 we’ve had relatively strong wheat prices, so the interest in CRP has diminished substantially.”\n\nNomsen is concerned about the decline in CRP acreage, but does not believe it signals an end to broad-based support for the program.\n\n“This isn’t just about a few hunters out there who like CRP. There are literally hundreds and hundreds of groups that support the program for one reason or another,” he said. “It’s a program that helps sustain healthy agriculture productivity and strong wildlife production — and it does these things together. If you look at all of these values, clearly CRP is one of the most efficient agriculture programs that we have.”\n\nU.S. states with greatest total CRP payments in 2012\n\nIowa - $219,939,947\n\nIllinois - $126,722,998\n\nTexas - $119.328,039\n\nMinnesota - $109,717,659\n\nKansas - $105,783,407\n\nMissouri - $104,579,511\n\nNorth Dakota - $90,281,624\n\nWashington - $84,123,622\n\nMontana - $74,956,473\n\nColorado - $71,107,488\n\nConservation Reserve Program payments in the U.S. totaled $31.5 billion from 1995-2012.\n\nMontana counties with greatest total CRP payments in 2012\n\nHill - $7,930,525\n\nChouteau - $7,871,279\n\nToole - $4.675,603\n\nLiberty - $4,466,295\n\nRoosevelt - $4,111,536\n\nValley - $3,910,564\n\nBlaine - $3,563,110\n\nPhillips - $3,553,737\n\nDaniels - $3,353,571\n\nTeton -$3,351,152\n\nConservation Reserve Program payments in Montana totaled $1.9 billion from 1995-2012."
