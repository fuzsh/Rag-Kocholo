        "text": "Former U.S. Representative Denny Rehberg launched his bid Wednesday to return to the House where he served in the 2000s.\n\nRehberg, a Billings native, held Montana's at-large House seat from 2001 through 2012. He is the eighth GOP candidate seeking to replace Republican Rep. Matt Rosendale in Montana's Eastern District.\n\nIn a press release, Rehberg, 68, said he wanted \"to ensure there is a country left for our grandkids.\"\n\nRehberg seeks settlement in Billings wildfire lawsuit\n\nRehberg, a Republican who claimed to roll out a bedroll and overnight in his House office for his entire tenure, unsuccessfully challenged Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester in, 2012, losing by 18,764 votes.\n\nEarmarks stand a switch for Rehberg\n\nA real estate developer who once raised cashmere goats, Rehberg served as lieutenant governor to both Stan Stephens and Marc Racicot. His first D.C. gig was in the 1970s working for Eastern District Rep. Ron Marlenee.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Rehberg told Politico that acquaintances encouraged him to run for Montana's second House seat because a poll indicated he had enough name recognition to win the race. With so many candidates, the Eastern District Republican primary could be won with as little as 12.5% of the vote, depending on distribution. Winners of Montana's two most recent six-candidate primaries both won with a little more than a 33% vote share.\n\nRehberg breaks ankle; 4 others hurt in boat crash\n\nThe winner of the crowded Republican primary will be strongly favored to win the general election. Eastern Montana voters have given Republican congressional candidates victory margins of 20% or better over the last two decades.\n\nOther candidates in the Republican primary were quick to spar with Rehberg. Montana Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen, who made her candidacy official Feb. 10, slapped a Trumpian nickname on the former representative, “RINO Rehberg.” RINO being the acronym for Republican in name only.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n“Montana can smell a RINO from a mile away. Denny Rehberg spent his time in Congress acting like a Democrat by refusing to stand for conservative values and voting for MASSIVE overspending of our taxpayer dollars,” Arntzen said in a press release.\n\n\"Montanans don't want Liz Cheney with a mustache,\" Arntzen said on X.\n\nAnalysis: Wild claims, distortions abound in U.S. Senate race\n\nEd Walker, a former state legislator from Billings, took a preemptive strike six days before Rehberg announced, calling Rehberg a D.C. lobbyist determined to return to “the swamp” of Congress.\n\nRehberg was, in his day, considered extremely conservative. He ended his tenure opposing the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, and eschewing the practice of directing federal spending to projects in Montana through congressional earmarks.\n\nBickering over bona fides in Montana Senate race\n\nHeritage Action, the hard right political arm of the Heritage Foundation gave Rehberg a “lifetime score” of 53% for casting votes the way Heritage preferred more than half the time. The biggest splits between Heritage and Rehberg concerned spending priorities important to Montana that Heritage opposed, such as federally subsidized commercial flights, farm subsidies and highway spending. Rehberg also clashed with conservatives over bills that kept the federal government fully funded and avoided government shutdowns.\n\nThe former congressman’s work-related exploits are infamous. A 2009 alcohol-fueled boat crash onto a boulder on the banks of Flathead Lake left Rehberg with broken bones and severely injured members of his staff. The boat was piloted by former state Sen. Greg Barkus, whose blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit. The incident raised questions about Rehberg’s judgement.\n\nIn 2004, Roll Call reported that a congressional junket to Kazakhstan ended poorly with Rehberg falling from his horse, sometime after referring to the locals as “coneheads.” Nine people on the trip would later sit down with Roll Call in the office of then Montana U.S. Sen. Conrad Burns to debunk details of story, lowering the amount of alcohol the congressman consumed from the 20 shots stated in an anonymous email, to just six shots consumed over a couple of hours.\n\nColonel, staffers deny anonymous e-mail about Rehberg\n\nRoll Call noted the six shots, witnessed by First, Col. Arthur White, the Senate’s Marine Liaison, was “two more than Rehberg confessed to having; and six more than Rehberg’s press secretary first asserted his boss had consumed.”\n\nRehberg has also struggled recently in business. Two years ago, his family owned six restaurants in Montana including three in Billings, a Burger King and two Popeyes chicken outlets. All have since been closed.\n\nThe two times that Rehberg ran for U.S. Senate created political steppingstones for the people who replaced him. When Rehberg opted to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Max Baucus in 1996, instead of remaining Racicot’s lieutenant governor, he was replaced by Judy Martz who four years later became the only woman elected governor in Montana. When Rehberg chose to run against Tester in 2012, Montana’s at large House seat was won by Steve Daines, who two years later was elected to the U.S. Senate.\n\nLove\n\n1\n\nFunny\n\n1\n\nWow\n\n1\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
