        "text": "Chapter 5: Conclusion and Future Directions\n\nIn these investigations, we have shown that maternal mental health and financial hardship are among the potential environmental factors of Austin Spectrum Disorder (ASD); these experiences persist when community factors are examined, and they amplify the effect of organophosphate pesticide exposures.\n\nPoverty is now recognized to be one of the most enduring risk factors for morbidity and mortality throughout the life course, with inter-related mechanisms causing disproportionate exposure to stressors. These mechanisms include the maternal and family characteristics arising from the economic, political, social and environmental factors associated with low income. Contextual factors like race, ethnicity, immigration status or community setting, combine with these mechanisms to have direct and indirect effects on perinatal and mental health. Poor mothers are likely to face a bombardment of stressful life events, including teenage pregnancies, unemployment, more crowded and polluted homes and communities, and minimal support and resources to handle these stress exposures.\n\nPregnant women suffering with mood disorders are unlikely to receive appropriate and timely treatment. A 2012 nationally representative study found that more than half of pregnant (65.9%) and non-pregnant women (58.6%) experiencing depression went undiagnosed 1. This is in large part due to inadequate screening. According to a randomized cross-sectional survey of OB/GYNs who completed residency training during the previous 5 years, only 9% to 12% reported that they routinely asked patients about depression or used a screening questionnaire to identify major or minor depression 2. However, patients who receive screening for postpartum depression show improved outcomes when compared with patients who receive no screening 3. According to a new review from AHRQ’s Effective Health Care Program the potential effectiveness of screening appears to be related to the availability of systems to ensure adequate follow-up of women with positive results 3.\n\nAdditionally, after the perinatal period, families with limited resources and education, and Black and Hispanic children with ASD, are more likely to receive a delayed diagnosis of ASD 4-6. They are also more likely to live in communities and circumstances that limit their ability to maximize their use of appropriate interventions. Low socioeconomic position may confer limited ability to navigate the medical system, and magnify the impact of the diagnosis on a family already burdened with multiple stressors and stress and poor mental health. Poor families may be additionally burdened by the substantial economic burden associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. For ASD, in the United States lifetime cost is estimated to be $1.36 million for ASD without Intellectual Disability (ID), and $1.43 million for an individual with both ASD and ID7. This estimate of total costs includes the costs from services needed (79%), and productivity loss by both the affected individual (12%) and caregiver (9%)7.\n\nMaternity care clinicians and pediatric providers should be aware of these intersections of social factors. For example many black parents living with the fear of racism, and heightened terror for their male children especially underreport some autism symptoms like social deficits, and restricted and repetitive behaviors, and emphasize general developmental and disruptive behavior concerns 8. Hispanic families reported difficulties receiving an appropriate diagnosis for their child and accessing care as a result of poor language proficiency, maternal education and fear of legal reprisals for seeking care 6,9. Without clinician awareness and vigilance about these contextual factors, addressing perinatal stress and depression, referral for appropriate diagnostic evaluation, and subsequent interventions may not be appropriately addressed, with lifelong implications for the health of the affected child.\n\nFuture Directions\n\nThere are several areas for further study identified by these findings. These include further examination of the link between maternal psychological stress during pregnancy and: indicators of dysregulation of inflammatory processes in the newborn, exposures to mixtures and pesticides other than the organophosphate compounds. Mothers and their children could be aided by greater understanding of the protective possibilities of maternal nutrition, when economic and psychological stressors are present.\n\nIndicators of Dysregulation of Inflammatory Processes\n\nThe human immune response is regulated by a complex network of control factors, with an intricate balance of anti-inflammatory cytokines and cytokine inhibitors. Cytokines have been described as the common language between the immune and nervous systems, and facilitators of cross-systemic communication. They are complex proteins that control the nature, duration, and intensity of an immune response 10. Anti-inflammatory cytokines interact with cytokine inhibitors and soluble cytokine receptors to regulate the human immune response. Evidence of immune dysfunction has been observed in many children with ASD, including activation of microglia, increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma 11. A potential role for immune dysfunction has been suggested in ASD 12-19. Additionally, research supports altered immune activity in both children with autism and their mothers 20 and children with autism have higher incidence of autoantibody production, and skewed cytokine profiles compared to those developing typically 13.\n\nSeveral studies have examined potential biological mechanisms between in-utero stress exposure and ASD and hypothesized inflammatory processes that explain these associations 21-25. Psychological stress or depressive symptoms during pregnancy has been associated with elevated serum inflammatory markers as well as exaggerated inflammatory responses to both biological and psychosocial challenges23,24. Research that examines prenatal stressors and their impact on inflammatory processes in the newborn is needed to fully examine the implications of stress-induced immune dysregulation in pregnancy for pervasive developmental disorders in the child.\n\nPrenatal Dietary intake and Maternal Psychological Stress\n\nHigher maternal intake of multivitamins, especially periconception folic acid supplementation has been associated with reduction in ASD risk 26,27, emerging evidence also suggest that the microbiome plays an important role in neurodevelopmental disorders28. More work is needed to examine the preventative possibilities and mechanisms of maternal prenatal dietary intake in the face of maternal psychological stress.\n\nMultiple Exposures and Neurodevelopment\n\nWhile this dissertation has focused on community level exposures and residential proximity to one type of pesticide, we have not addressed the impact of multiple environmental exposures. We already know that pregnant women are exposed to multiple environmental chemicals 29. Biomonitoring data from a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population found detectable levels of 62 chemicals in 90% of pregnant women 30. Almost all women (>99%) had detectable levels of: certain polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, PFCs, phenols, PBDEs, phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and perchlorate, many known to cross the placenta and be detected in fetal serum or cord blood. Additional research needs to examine the interaction between social factors and the complex exposures that may impact the neurodevelopmental trajectory of our future generations.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
