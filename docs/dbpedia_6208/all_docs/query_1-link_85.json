        "text": "Amber heard a self proclaimed feminist has once again decided to attack her victim. The support she is receiving is a kick in the teeth for male victims of domestic abuse, her friends say it’s okay to abuse a man. They think that they have won well they may have won the fight but we will win the war. Amber heard deserves to be punished for the abuse and lies she has spread she deserves to be outed for the Liar she is because she did indeed lie under oath. Johnny Depp has proven his innocence yet people would rather ignore the fact and support someone who abused him someone who isn’t a very nice person someone who thinks she got away with it well I’m proud he told the world i’m proud he’s living his life im proud of him #istandwithjohnnydepp"
