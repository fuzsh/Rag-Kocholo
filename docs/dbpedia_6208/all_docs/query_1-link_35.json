        "text": "3. Machine Learning Approaches for Nephrology\n\nIn the following, the studies are grouped based on the nature of the kidney disease. In detail, the analyzed pathologies are “kidney masses”, “acute kidney injury”, “chronic kidney disease”, “kidney stone”, “glomerular disease”, “kidney transplant”, and “other kidney pathologies”. From the analysis of the selected articles, three main research tasks are identified across the application areas:\n\n(1)\n\nsegmentation and identification, which intends to analyze diagnostic images with the purpose of highlighting or detecting one or more specific elements;\n\n(2)\n\nclassification, which aims to perform a diagnosis or to determine the degree of severity of disease;\n\n(3)\n\nprediction, which aims to prevent or forecast some future event, e.g., predict either the degeneration of a disease or the outcome of a specific therapy.\n\nIn the next subsections are reported, for each disease, a brief description of the symptoms to provide the reader with a simple explanation of the clinical scenario, and the various ML techniques used in the state of the art, grouped according to the research tasks described above, highlighting the type of database used. shows a graph schematically outlining the several analyzed pathologies (red color). From each pathology, one or two branches may be amplified according to the type of data available in the available studies (green color), and finally from these as many branches as the ML methods used on that type of data for that specific renal pathology (blue color). The following sections are based on the schematization depicted in the graph.\n\n3.1. Kidney Masses\n\nKidney masses are abnormal growths within the kidney. They are mainly subdivided into two main categories: solid and cystic. Generally, the presence of a kidney mass is determined by relying on imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound (US).\n\nIn general, cystic kidney masses are, in most cases, benign [25], while solid kidney masses are generally malignant; therefore, the kidney is generally partially or totally removed to perform the histological exam. However, approximately 16% of surgically removed solid kidney masses are benign [26] and surgical removal would not have been necessary. Unfortunately, the distinction of the nature of the solid renal mass, using diagnostic imaging, is very complex, even for specialized physicians, given the significant similarities in the appearance of some types of malignant and benign renal masses, in terms of texture, size, volume, and position. To face this challenge, modern ML techniques have been employed to process image data, proving to help physicians in making a more precise and accurate diagnosis. To classify and distinguish between malignant and benign masses, [27] some use a Bayesian classifier [28], a learning algorithm based on the statistical relationship between radiomics features (relational functional gradient boosting), and [29] an algorithm based on CT texture analysis. Many works focus on the analysis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which is the cause of 80% of kidney cancer deaths [25], either to distinguish different types of RCCs or to differentiate them from benign tumors. In [30,31,32,33,34], the main goal is to diagnose the most common malignant tumor, the clear cell RCC, using radiomic features and ML-based classifiers (e.g., random forest, CatBoost). Using radiomic features extracted from multiphoton microscopy images of kidney tissue sections, [35] try to distinguish RCC chromophobes and oncocytomas, while [36] try to classify the stage of a particular type of malignant tumor, the papillary RCC, using microarray datasets [37] and clinical information of the patients. Some more recent research, such as that of [38,39,40], focuses not only on tumor classification, but also on automatic tumor identification through diagnostic images, by using three-dimensional image processing with ML techniques such as 3D U-Net, and 3D V-Net; with these solutions, they are able to automatically segment the tumor inside the CT. shows these works, explaining the main objective of each one, the adopted ML techniques, the database exploited, the best result achieved, and finally the year of publication; the reported metrics should be read from the perspective that the higher the reported value, the better the obtained performance.\n\nTable 1\n\nPaperObjectiveMethodDatabaseResultsYear[27]Malignant renal cyst predictionBayesian classifier[27]AUC 0.962009[28]Identify malignant renal massesStatistical relational learning—RFGB: relational functional gradient boosting[28]Accuracy 82%2018[29]Differentiate between malignant and benign massesCT texture analysis with random forest[29]Accuracy 90.5%\n\nAUC 0.9152020[30]Diagnose ccRCCWEKA with and without SMOTE[41]AUC contour-focused 0.865–0.984\n\nAUC margin shrinkage 0.745–0.8872019[31]Diagnose ccRCCPyradiomics and random forest[41]Accuracy 84.6%\n\nSensitivity 90.4%\n\nSpecificity 78.8%\n\nPrecision 81%2020[32]Diagnose ccRCCRadiomics and CatBoost[32,41]MR accuracy 73% internal 74% external\n\nCT accuracy 79% internal 69% external2020[33]Diagnose ccRCCMaZda and WEKA toolkit[33]Accuracy 85.1%2018[34]Diagnose ccRCCProteomics-based\n\nrandom forest and\n\nimaging-based VGG16[41]Proteomics accuracy 98% image accuracy 83% validation, 95% testing set2019[35]Differentiate between kidney chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and oncocytomaLinear SVM[35]Accuracy 80%2016[36]Classify papillary renal cell carcinoma stagesFeature extraction and random forest[42,43]Accuracy 88.5%2018[38]Kidney and tumor segmentation3D U-Net[44]Mean Kidney Tumor Dice 0.91682019[39]Kidney and tumor segmentationCascade 3D U-Net[44]Mean Kidney Tumor Dice 0.90642019[40]Kidney and tumor segmentationMulti-resolution 3D V-Net[44]Mean Kidney Tumor Dice 0.88152019\n\n3.2. Acute Kidney Injury\n\nDuring an episode of acute kidney injury (AKI), the kidneys show difficulty in maintaining the proper fluid balance in the body, due to an accumulation of waste products. Given the speed with which it strikes and the damage that it causes, being able to detect it early can be of great significance. In this type of critical situation, AI is demonstrated to be one of the best solutions to correctly identify a patient with AKI. In studies by [45,46,47], the goal is to predict AKI based on early symptoms to prevent a possible degeneration of the disease, analyzing electronic health records (HER) and other clinical data, such as laboratory tests, vital signs, and patient demographics. AI techniques, thanks also to the speed of response, can be decisive, as in the case of [48], in which the authors try to detect AKI in burn patients using a k-Nearest Neighbor classifier on numerical features obtained from plasma creatinine testing [49].\n\nSome research, such as [50,51], focuses on predicting an episode of AKI in patients undergoing examinations that require contrast agents, specifically coronary angiography. It has been observed that the use of such agents can lead to AKI episodes; in these studies, the authors aim to predict the AKI episode with AI approaches by using clinical variables collected before the examination and by the results of the coronary angiography that they undergo [52].\n\nRecent studies focus on predicting AKI episodes’ insurgence within different periods from its manifestation. The most common prediction time intervals vary from 48 h to a maximum of 90 days, as in [53]; in this work, the authors evaluate their solution based on the analysis of time-series data over these time intervals. It is possible to find another example in [54], in which the authors, through numerical features extracted from multiple blood tests per single patient, attempt to predict AKI within 30 days from its manifestation. Finally, in [55], the authors, using daily collected patients’ clinical data, propose a particular type of deep learning algorithm, based on time series, which is able to predict AKI within 48 h from its occurrence, as well as classify the stage of the AKI disease if it is already present. In , analogously to , are reported all the related objectives, methods, used databases, and results.\n\nTable 2\n\nPaperObjectiveMethodDatabaseResultsYear[45]Predict AKI in\n\nadult and childrenBoruta [56] (selection algorithm) +\n\nrandom forest[57,58]AUC 0.7962018[46]Predict AKI in\n\nadult and childrenGradient boosted machine[59]AUC 0.852021[47]Predict AKIGradient boosted machine[47]AUC 0.762021[48]Predict AKI in burn patientsK-NN[48]Accuracy 97%2019[50]Predict AKILasso + logistic regression[60]AUC 0.79\n\nAUC 0.82 [p < 0.001]2019[51]Predict AKIRF + XGboost[51]AUC 0.8432020[53]Predict AKIStreams[53]Accuracy 56% in 48 h\n\nAccuracy 84% in 30 d\n\nAccuracy 90% in 90 d2019[54]Prediction of AKI\n\nfrom blood testFeature selection + random forest[54]AUC 0.881 in 30 d2021[55]Predict AKIGradient boosting tree-based machines[61]AUC 76% in 48 h\n\nAUC 81% stage 2\n\nAUC 87% stage 32020\n\n3.3. Chronic Kidney Disease\n\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition characterized by the gradual loss of kidney function over time. CDK damages the kidneys by decreasing their ability to filter waste from the blood. In severe conditions, waste can reach high levels and lead to the development of other complications, which, in the most extreme cases, will require periodic medical treatment, such as dialysis, or even a kidney transplant [62]. CDK is a disease that can be diagnosed by physicians through the study and analysis of a variety of indices (e.g., eGFR [63]); thus, it is suitable for the application of ML methods. An example of using AI for this purpose can be seen in the study by [26], where the stage of pathology is classified using radiomic features obtained from ultrasound images of the kidney.\n\nThe general interest and applications to diagnose CKD underwent an abrupt increase with the creation and public release in 2015 of a database containing characteristic features (i.e., age, blood pressure, specific gravity, albumin, sugar, red blood cells, pus cell, pus cell clumps, bacteria, blood glucose random, blood urea, serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, white blood cell count, red blood cell count, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, appetite, pedal edema, and anemia) related to 400 patients during the early symptoms of the disease [64]. Different methods based on the analysis and classification of patient features are adopted by [26,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73].\n\nIn addition to the diagnosis of CKD, there are some related studies in the literature, such as [74], in which the authors try to predict a possible plan for the patients’ diet, given the fact that following a proper and suitable diet plan can help to slow down the progress of CKD [75]. In [76], since maintaining appropriate hemoglobin levels during treatment for CKD is critical, the authors try to predict the hemoglobin level in the blood during anemia treatment in predialysis CKD patients, to intervene more quickly.\n\nThis information, the used databases, and the obtained accuracy results are shown in , analogously to the others.\n\nTable 3\n\nPaperObjectiveMethodDatabaseResultsYear[26]Diagnose CKD\n\nbased on\n\npatient stageSupport vector machine—SVM[26]Accuracy 82% on 2 stages\n\nAccuracy 67.21% on 3 stages\n\nAccuracy 51% on 5 stages2014[65]CKD diagnosisRandom forest[64]Accuracy 99.3%2016[66]CKD diagnosisDecision tree C4.5[64]Accuracy 63%2016[67]CKD diagnosisSVM[64]Accuracy 98.3%2016[68]CKD diagnosisk-NN with CFS and AdaBoost[64]Accuracy 98.1%2017[69]CKD diagnosisRandom forest[64]Accuracy 100%2017[70]CKD diagnosisRPART[64]AUC 0.995\n\nSensitivity 0.9897\n\nSpecificity 12018[71]CKD diagnosisPSODP + DL-RNN[64]Accuracy 99.5%2018[72]CKD diagnosisPNN [77][64]Accuracy 96.7%2019[73]CKD diagnosisRFE and Random Forest[64]F1 score 100%2021[74]Predict diet plan for\n\nCKD patientsMulticlass\n\nDecision forest[64]Accuracy 99.17%2017[76]Predict hemoglobin levels\n\nin CKD patientsExtraction rule—Re-RX + J48graft[64]Accuracy 95.18%2019\n\n3.4. Kidney Stone\n\nNephrolithiasis, or kidney stones, is a condition characterized by the presence of deposits in the kidney, caused by an alteration in the balance between the solubility and precipitation of salts in the urinary tract and kidneys [78]. One crucial point is given by the fact that surgery is required in 20% of patients with this condition [79]. In this context, AI is applied to identify the correct type of treatment to be followed based on parameters such as sediment composition, location, and size [80]. Some research focuses on the detection of kidney stones, such as [81,82], which use radiomic features extracted from manually segmented CT, with the goal of the early detection of stone deposits before they reach a size greater than 2 cm, allowing the use of non-invasive treatments. Other research, such as [83,84,85], focuses on predicting the outcome of shock wave treatment without the use of diagnostic imaging techniques, by analyzing the preoperative parameters of patients (such as age, sex, presence of related diseases, and stone characteristics including stone laterality, location, and maximum length). Similar to the other tables, reports this information, the databases used, and the accuracy of the obtained results.\n\nTable 4\n\nPaperObjectiveMethodDatabaseResultsYear[81]Renal stone detectionSegmentation + ANN[81]Accuracy 86%2019[82]Renal stones vs. phlebolithsRadiomics +\n\nAdaBoost classifier[82]Accuracy 85.1%2019[83]Kidney stone removal,\n\nprediction of postoperative variablesANN[83]Accuracy 81–98.2%2017[84]Predict stone-free status\n\nafter the first treatmentFeature extraction +\n\nsequential forward selection +\n\nmultiple classifier scheme[84]Accuracy 60%2019[85]Stone-free predictionLight gradient boosting method[85]Accuracy 87.9%2020\n\n3.5. Glomerular Diseases\n\nGlomerular diseases are diseases that affect the glomeruli, whose function is to filter blood and, at the same time, to retain proteins and blood that the body needs. Many diseases, such as diabetes, affect kidney function by attacking the glomeruli [86]. In this regard [87,88,89], use methods based on the analysis of patients’ clinical data to predict type II diabetes. Some studies focus on specific conditions and causes of glomerular diseases, such as Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy (IgAN), which is the most common biopsy-proven primary glomerulonephritis in the world [90]; it damages not only the kidneys, but also the immune system response [91]. In [92,93,94], the authors implement applications able to predict IgAN using a renal immunofluorescent image obtained by fluorescence microscopes relative to a renal biopsy. Other works, such as [95,96,97], focus on detecting type II diabetes directly from diagnostic images, using radiomic features. Finally, [98] try to predict the weight of children with glomerular disease to avoid possibly dangerous weight loss, using diagnostic numerical features obtained from blood monitoring and analysis.\n\nAll the useful information is reported in , analogously to the previous tables.\n\nTable 5\n\nPaperObjectiveMethodDatabaseResultsYear[87]Predict diabetic kidney diseaseSVM radial[87]Accuracy 94%2013[88]Predict diabetic kidney diseaseUnbalanced random forest[88]Accuracy 83.8%2018[89]Predict diabetic kidney diseaseKnime + WEKA[89]Accuracy 83.5%2019[92]Resolution image-based\n\nrenal pathologyConvolutional neural network[92]Accuracy > 80%2021[93]Predict ESKD in patients with IgANANN[93]AUC 0.82 with\n\n5-year follow-up\n\nAUC 0.89 with\n\n10-year follow-up2021[94]Predict deterioration of\n\nkidney function\n\nin IgAN patientsSVM[94]Accuracy 79.8%2021[95]Diagnose glomerular diseaseDisjunctive least\n\ngeneralization—DLG algorithm[95]Accuracy 81.26–96.5%1992[96]Detect pathogenic and\n\nnon-pathogenic\n\nglomerulus and tubulusRatSnake—ML automatic\n\nsegmentation[96]Accuracy 94.7%2014[97]Diagnose glomerular diseaseDecision tree with\n\nJ48 algorithm[97]Accuracy 89.47%2021[98]Predict weight of\n\nchildren in renal dialysisANN[98]Mean difference 0.4972018\n\n3.6. Kidney Transplant\n\nEven if kidney transplantation is not a pathology but rather a specific surgical treatment, some authors considered creating a dedicated section since there are several studies regarding this topic, and it is one of the most common treatments for patients with severe kidney pathologies.\n\nIn detail, kidney transplantation is a surgical procedure that involves taking a healthy kidney from a living or cadaveric donor and implanting it into the recipient patient. For the transplant to be successful, many factors must be considered, including the compatibility of the donor with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins of the recipient. Although, nowadays, there is a method that reduces the risk of rejection, in the case of mismatched HLA [99,100], approximately 40% of donated kidneys are rejected [101]. The ML techniques applied by [102,103,104,105,106] focus on predicting the probability of success and survival in these types of interventions using numerical features (e.g., age, sex, time in dialysis, donor type, donor age, HLA mismatches, delayed graft function, acute rejection episode, and chronic allograft nephropathy). reports all the necessary information, analogously to the others.\n\nTable 6\n\nPaperObjectiveMethodDatabaseResultsYear[102]Predict\n\ntransplant failure probabilityDecision tree[102]Specificity 73.8%\n\nSensitivity 88.2%2010[103]Predict post-\n\ntransplant survivabilityBayesian belief network[103]Accuracy 52% after 1 year\n\nAccuracy 56% after 3 years2012[104]Classify risk levels for\n\nkidney graft survival\n\nafter transplantElasticNet + Bayesian belief network[107]Accuracy 68.4%2018[105]Predict early transplant rejectionDecision tree and random forest[105]Accuracy 85%2019[106]Predict kidney transplantation\n\ncompatibility\n\nPredict renal function worsening\n\n1 year after transplantElderly KTbot[106]Precision 90%\n\nSensitivity 71%\n\nF1 score 0.792020\n\n3.7. Other Renal Diseases\n\nIn this group are reported other renal diseases that do not fit within the classification provided so far. These studies focus on uncommon objectives, such as [108], which aims to predict the level of hemoglobin in patients with renal dysfunction, using numerical characteristics obtained from clinical data related to dialysis [109]; in [110], an application is developed that intends to define the need to perform or not a renal biopsy by analyzing physicians’ annotations through a natural language processing ML algorithm; [111] try to predict the survival of hemodialysis patients using numerical characteristics (age, sex, diabetes mellitus, chronic glomerulonephritis or nephrosclerosis, body mass index, albumin, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, total cholesterol, etc.). In [112], the authors extract radiomics features from three-dimensional ultrasound images to identify renal and liver tissue in patients with hydronephrosis. Finally, [113] use numerical features extracted from patients’ EHRs with the corresponding acquisition time, to predict the risk of stratification of renal function deterioration.\n\nis presented analogously to the previous ones.\n\nTable 7\n\nPaperObjectiveMethodDatabaseResultsYear[108]Predict hemoglobin in patients\n\nwith kidney disfunctionData merging + clustering + ensemble of classifiers[108]Mean absolute error 0.662—Italy,\n\nmean absolute error 0.673—Spain2014[110]Recommend renal biopsyTokenization + NLP machine learning classifier[110]Accuracy 83.5%\n\nPrecision 80.6%2019[111]Prediction of 1-year survival\n\nin hemodialysis patientsEnsemble artificial intelligence model[111]Accuracy 94.8%2020[112]Detect kidney and liver tissue\n\nfor hydronephrosis patientHomodyne-K feature extraction + random forest[112]Accuracy 94%2015[113]Predict risk stratification\n\nof renal function deterioration based on eGFR thresholdMultitask temporal-based classifier[113]Specificity 0.828 with 10% threshold\n\nSpecificity 0.786 with 20% threshold2015\n\n5. Discussion\n\nAfter having reported in the previous sections the existing methods in the literature to address renal pathologies with machine learning methods and analyzed the available databases, we summarize in this section what has been found for each pathology; in particular, the limitations of the studies carried out so far and possible future developments will be indicated.\n\nRegarding renal masses, the goal of the analyzed works is to find a method to non-invasively discriminate benign and malignant masses [29], and artificial intelligence has the potential to become a very important tool for assisted diagnosis. This is motivated by the results of identified research, in which are obtained accuracies ranging from 79% [32] to a peak of approximately 90% [29] (these results are from private single-center databases). Currently, the gold standard for the detection of a renal mass is based on the analysis, by an experienced physician, of CT images before and after dosing with a contrast medium [115]. AI can perform the discrimination function because it can analyze diagnostic images, such as CT, at a very high or equal level of detail as an expert [116]. This is because it can also take into account multidimensional characteristic features, such as texture. However, using CT, the various parameters used for the acquisition and the timing with which it is done assume an important role [29]. In fact, from the articles analyzed, it emerges that, according to the CT acquisition phase taken into consideration, the results obtained change; specifically, the most used phase is the corticomedullary phase [30]. Furthermore, as regards the use of CT for the extraction of characteristic features, the literature considers the three-dimensional use of CT to be better and more representative [117], but in the research identified [27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36], to reduce the workload of manual segmentation and facilitate the repeatability of this operation, a limited number of slices or only the two-dimensional slice containing the largest portion of the mass considered is used. In addition to how CT is used, it is also important to control the method by which features are extracted; in some research [28,29,31,32,33,34,35,36], radiomic features are used, after manual segmentation by at least one experienced physician, to classify tumors. One of the major limitations introduced, in doing so, is the bias of the operator who performs the segmentation [118]. For this reason, more recent studies [38,39,40] have focused on overcoming manual segmentation by creating deep learning algorithms capable of automatically segmenting kidneys and tumors present in CT; the results obtained from these studies are positive, as they achieve a mean kidney tumor size–mean per CT of the testing set of (Kidney Sørensen-Dice + Tumor Sørensen-Dice)/2 [44], with a maximum of 0.9168. In particular, one solution proposed in the literature to deal with operator-introduced bias is for a team of clinicians to collaborate on the kits2019 database in a way that reduces the risk of bias as much as possible.\n\nRegarding AKI, this pathology is very widespread, with consequences that, if not treated in time, can even lead to death. Currently, there is no specific intervention that can prevent AKI; there are only general measures that can be taken to delay more critical procedures such as surgery [55]. For this reason, most of the recently developed research focuses on predicting the prognosis of this disease [45,46,47,48,50,51,53,54,55], being able to predict AKI with good accuracy even 30 days in advance [54]. The solutions implemented depend not only on the task but also on the actual number of data available for each patient [119]. Maintaining a large number of data for each patient has an economic cost and features used in one center may not be available in other centers [45]. ML techniques can outperform clinical tools used to estimate AKI risk, as we see in [46], with an AUC of 0.85. The performance of solutions exploiting ML for the prediction of AKI is positive: AUC 0.76 [47], in liver transplant patients; 97% accuracy [48] and AUC 0.76 [55], for burn patients; AUC [0.79–0.843] [50,51], for patients undergoing coronary angiography. However, despite the various existing applications, there is a lack of a ML-based prediction systems that can be recognized as state of the art for AKI prediction [47].\n\nRegarding CKD, this is a very common type of disease, which, if detected in time, can be managed through periodic therapies. Thanks to the University of California, Irvine (UCI), which made public the database known as UCI CKD [64] (containing 24 characteristics, derived from patient history and diagnostic tests, plus information regarding the presence or absence of CKD), many studies have been developed to diagnose CKD. Since this database was made public, various studies have used it to test multiple different types of solutions, obtaining increasingly impressive results for accuracy (63–100%) [65,66,67,68,69,71,72,74,76], AUC (0.995) [70], and F1 score (100%) [73]. Being the only public database available for this pathology, the research has been mainly focused on the analysis of numerical features; this is also due to the fact that patients suffering from CKD, or otherwise at risk, cannot undergo all the existing diagnostic imaging techniques. In this case, techniques that require the use of radiation, such as CT, are strongly discouraged, because they can easily worsen the patients’ condition. Therefore, imaging techniques such as US, used in [26] with 82% accuracy in predicting the stage of CKD, and MRI are preferred. The latter has been shown to have the ability to allow assessment of both renal function and structure [120]. Major future developments may shift in this direction and focus on the development of methods that take advantage of MRI to be able to determine CKD.\n\nIf radiation imaging techniques cannot be used to determine CKD, the same is not true for detecting and analyzing kidney stones. In particular, for kidney stones, it is possible to use not only CT but also low-dose CT (LDCT), which exposes the patient to approximately five times less radiation than regular CT [121]. The independence of the dosage used to acquire CT is demonstrated in several studies: in [81], ML techniques are applied to process LDCT and CT and identify the composition of a kidney stone, achieving 86% accuracy for both assays used; in [82], LDCT is analyzed to differentiate between kidney stones and phleboliths in patients with acute flank pain, with 85.1% accuracy. The applicability of these methods ensures that low-dose radiation CT acquisitions can be used for the detection of a kidney stone, reducing any risks associated with the radiation exposure of normal CT. In addition to the detection and analysis of kidney stones, researchers are also studying the prediction of success in removing a kidney stone. Successful selection of the most appropriate method can lead to a higher rate of kidney stone clearance, lower risk of associated morbidities, higher probability of survival, faster recovery, and lower overall cost of care [122]. Depending on the procedure chosen [84,85], and for the prediction of stone removal, there is 60% accuracy [84] for predicting success after the first treatment, and 87.9% for predicting success when a shock wave is used for kidney stone clearance [85]. Accuracies ranging from 81% to 98.2% have been obtained for predicting a patient’s condition and possible complications following renal stone removal [83].\n\nSince glomerular disease is a condition that worsens over time, the machine learning techniques implemented are primarily focused on predicting the prognosis of the condition and identifying the consequences caused by the presence of the disease [87,88,89,92,93,94,95,96,97,98]. The most common glomerular disease prevalent in the world is Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy (IgAN) [123]. IgAN is caused by renal dysfunction and can be diagnosed by diagnostic imaging of the kidney, particularly immunofluorescence imaging. Some researchers have focused on diagnosing IgAN from diagnostic images with different resolutions, with an accuracy of at least 80% [92] and an accuracy of 80.27% [95], using only clinical and laboratory analysis data. Around 30–40% of IgAN patients carry the risk of the disease degenerating into ESRD (end-stage renal disease) [93]; for this reason, some research tries to predict this degeneration to allow the efforts of physicians to focus mainly on patients who are more at risk, as, for example, in [93], where it predicts the degeneration of the disease in the next 5 years, with AUC of 0.82, and after 10 years with AUC of 0.89, and as in [94], with 79.8% accuracy. Another particular type of glomerular disease is caused by diabetes. Since diabetes is very common, it is very important to prevent its degeneration into diabetes kidney disease, and in [87,88,89], the authors focus precisely on this aspect by creating algorithms that can predict the prognosis, with an accuracy of 83.5–94%.\n\nRegarding the literature inherent to renal transplantation, it is possible to identify three possible applications of AI [123]: (i) diagnosis, using AI to diagnose the level of transplant risk by detecting parameters associated with renal transplant rejections, and identifying abnormal patterns within them, as in [104], with 68.4% accuracy, and in [106]; (ii) prescription, using AI to prescribe postoperative therapies [124] to prevent complications or rejection, or to prescribe diets that may improve quality of life after renal transplantation [125]; (iii) prediction, using AI to predict mortality, and possible rejection, as in [102], with 73.8% specificity and 88.2% sensitivity; in [103], with 56% accuracy over a 3-year timeframe from possible rejection, and in [105], with 85% accuracy. It is important to note that for this specific task, the main limitation for the application of AI is given by the fact that the type of database is very patient-specific [103,104,105,106], as the values are highly dependent on both the recipient and the donor(s) available, resulting in a limitation that makes it difficult to generalize the solutions devised [126].\n\nBefore concluding, we believe that it is also necessary to analyze the ML algorithms used in nephrology, to address a possible reader interested in a specific type of algorithm rather than another, depending on the type of application that they would like to achieve. First of all, it is possible to notice that all the ML algorithms used are based on the use of supervised learning techniques. This is mainly due to the fact that the realized tasks are formulated and viewed in the form of classification problems. In particular, with regard to the research identified in this work, in , all the methods used have been grouped by algorithm type.\n\nTable 10\n\nMethod—ML Algorithm (Based)AuthorsYearBayesian classifier[27]2009[103]2012[104]2018Logistic regression[50]2019[106]2020Decision tree[66]2016[97]2021[102]2010Random forest[112]2015[65]2016[69]2017[45]2018[36]2018[34]2019[105]2019[29]2020[31]2020[73]2021[54]2021[88]2018SVM[87]2013[26]2014[35]2016[67]2016[94]2021ANN[81]2019[83]2017[98]2018[93]2021Ensemble of classifiers[84]2019[111]2020[108]2014[68]2017[48]2019[82]2019[76]2019[33]2018[89]2019[30]2019[28]2018[46]2021[47]2021[55]2020[85]2020[51]2020[32]2020DNN[96]2014[113]2015[110]2019[53]2020[95]1992[70]2018[71]2018[72]2019[34]2019[92]2021[38]2019[39]2019[40]2019\n\nFrom the table, it can be observed that the simplest and most common classification algorithms, such as random forest and support vector machine, and ensemble algorithms, such as gradient boosting machine, are the most used in these types of studies. However, more complex ML algorithms, such as artificial neural network, and deep neural networks, such as convolutional neural network, autoencoder, and more sophisticated approaches based not only on feature or image analysis, but also on natural language processing and the temporal evolution of features (temporal-based approaches, e.g., recursive neural network) are not missing. This could be due to the lack of very large public databases that would allow better use of the more complex ML techniques [127].\n\nIt is also possible to note that the methods applied by the authors differ mainly with respect to the type of the used data and the techniques of analysis and data processing. In particular, in cases where the database is composed exclusively of numerical features, derived from patients’ medical records, classifiers such as support vector machine, random forest, and artificial neural network are the most frequently applied. Whenever diagnostic images are present, instead, the type of ML technique varies according to the preprocessing applied to the data. In the case of minimal or null preprocessing, techniques such as convolutional neural network are used, in which the model directly analyzes the image and finds the most relevant features in order to classify it. Instead, when algorithms are used for the extraction of radiomic features from specific anatomical regions, algorithms generally applied to numerical features are used; in particular, ensemble algorithms are exploited, which typically, in these cases, guarantee a better result in terms of metrics.\n\nFinally, for the evaluation of algorithms’ performance, the authors feel that it could be misleading to compare methods applied to the same objective based on the values obtained from the evaluated metrics computed with different data. However, it is possible offer some considerations about the various metrics used, in order to understand in which cases some metrics are used instead of others. Since the most commonly used metrics are accuracy and AUC, we consider it appropriate to briefly discuss what the differences are: accuracy is a metric that represents the ratio of the number of correctly predicted samples to the total number of samples present; AUC, on the other hand, represents the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve that shows, for different probability thresholds, the relationship between the false positive rate (ratio of the number of false positives to the total number of negative cases) and the true positive rate (ratio of the number of true positives to the total number of positive cases). Looking at the two definitions, it may be deduced that the accuracy is a more intuitive metric and therefore more frequently used, but its simplicity has drawbacks, since it cannot be used in all cases—for example, in the case of unbalanced datasets, where it is preferable to use metrics such as the F1 score or AUC, or in case it is desired to take into account the probability associated with the various classes predicted, in which case only AUC takes this aspect into account. With the above in mind, the use of AUC is strongly recommended as it encapsulates increasingly confident information than accuracy alone.\n\nDespite the limits of this work, given the continuous evolution of research in this area, based on what has been analyzed so far, it is possible to conclude that, given the many existing applications of ML in nephrology, AI has great potential and versatility in this field. An example of a possible application for kidney image analysis can be based on the combination of the multiple methodologies that currently exist, such as the use of deep learning to detect kidneys and tumors [38,39,40], followed by the use of other machine learning techniques to classify the nature and/or severity of tumors, or the presence of any kidney disease and/or other possible masses. However, this does not mean that limitations are not still present. Most of the studies identified end before moving to a clinical trial, remaining only single-center retrospective studies, reducing their external validity [128,129]. Consequently, the main and most urgent gap that should be addressed as soon as possible is that of the public availability of data; this will not only allow studies to be compared with each other but will ensure that there are improvements in nephrology itself [2]. To this end, the guidelines for conducting clinical trials in nephrology, reported at the Kidney Disease—Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) conference, could be followed [126]."
