In Tanzania we are kickstarting an Adaptation Innovation Cluster to enhance the climate resilience of rural communities through collaboration and innovation. How are we doing this? We are empowering locally led climate innovation and bringing together a community for sharing ideas, learning and networking, where new ideas can flourish. Our recent trip to Tanzania has reaffirmed the importance and potenial of this. The connections made, the knowledge shared, and the partnerships formed have been invaluable. Here is how our vision came to life during this trip: First, during the #CBA18 conference in Arusha, we invited 15 of our friends and partner organisations to join us to learn, network, and share ideas. It was amazing to see five of them present their pitches in front of an audience of over 100 practitioners, NGOs, researchers, and funders during the Dragon's Den on the final day. We also hosted a dinner where we explored future visions together, but more importantly, we had fun and got to know each other on a more personal level. We led a couple of sessions as well, stimulating discussions about creating an enabling environment that promotes adaptation solutions, innovation and investment. Secondly, the Demo Day of our first-ever Adaptation & Resilience #ClimAccelerator and the #Climathon in Dar es Salaam confirmed there is a vibrant local ecosystem in Tanzania where innovative solutions are being developed to address climate change challenges. We received over 360 applications for the Adaptation & Resilience ClimAccelerator Tanzania programme. After a tough selection process, intensive training and mentorship, 14 start-ups refined their solutions, culminating in an exciting Demo Day last week, where I was honored to be on the jury. Big shout out and congratulations to our winners: üèÜ 1st Winner - Coastal BioTech Ltd ü•à 2nd Winner - Africa Harvest Enterprises (T) Limited ü•â 3rd Winner - LIMA AFRICA üèÖ 4th Winner - Kilimo Maendeleo üéñ 5th Winner - MOTO Poa. Go check them out! Our first-ever #Climathon event, a three-day hackathon focused on developing AI solutions for climate change challenges, in which 50 participants took part. The winning team, Kesho AI, proposed to build a location-based early warning system to predict floods, heavy rains, and heat waves while offering citizens tailored preparedness measures. A huge thank you to everyone involved ‚Äì my colleagues, our partners, and all the passionate entrepreneurs we met. Your efforts and commitment are the backbone of this initiative. I'm looking forward to continuing this journey of innovation and collaboration in Tanzania. #ClimateChange #Innovation #ClimateEntrepremeurship #Resilience #Tanzania #Adaptation #Sustainability"
