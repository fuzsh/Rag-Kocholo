        "text": "The following Data privacy principles reflect the minimum rules that apply to the processing of personal data at Rio Tinto.\n\nData privacy principle 1\n\nOur processing of personal data is lawful, fair and transparent\n\nLawful basis for processing: We will only process personal data:\n\nfor the legitimate business purpose we collected it for, as explained in a privacy statement\n\nfor other purposes that the data subject (the person that the data relates to) consents to\n\nwhere necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject\n\nif the processing is required in order to comply with our legal obligations\n\nif the processing is expressly permitted under local data privacy laws and the relevant personal data originates in that jurisdiction.\n\nNotification of processing: We will notify data subjects that we're collecting their personal data, by providing a privacy statement at or before the time we collect personal data from them.\n\nCollections by or from third parties: Where personal data has been collected by or from third parties, we will ensure that the personal data is lawfully disclosed to us. This includes confirming that data subjects were notified and that a lawful basis exists for the disclosure. We will only process the personal data as permitted by applicable data privacy laws.\n\nAppendix 1 provides an overview of the purposes for which Rio Tinto undertakes personal data processing.\n\nAdditional information about privacy statements (also known as ‘collection notices’) is at the end of Appendix 3\n\nData privacy principle 2\n\nWe limit our personal data processing\n\nPurpose limitation: Our personal data processing must be for specific and limited purposes, as notified to the data subject.\n\nIf we process personal data for a different purpose than that notified, we need to inform the relevant data subject(s) of that new purpose (in accordance with Data privacy principle 1) and confirm that:\n\nthe data subject consents to the processing of his or her personal data for this new purpose\n\nthe processing is required to comply with an applicable law\n\nthe new purposes for processing the personal data are compatible with the original processing purposes\n\nthe processing otherwise is lawful under applicable data privacy laws.\n\nProcessing for a new purpose will only be found to be compatible with the original purpose where applicable law so provides, or we have assessed and concluded that it is taking into account such factors as the relationship between the initial purposes and the new purpose; the context in which the personal data was collected and expectations of data subjects; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the new processing for data subjects; and whether there are privacy safeguards in place.\n\nData minimisation: We must process only that amount of personal data that we need for the relevant processing purpose, and only to the extent necessary for that purpose. Our personal data processing must be adequate, relevant and not excessive.\n\nData privacy principle 3\n\nWe maintain data quality\n\nWhen we process personal data, we take reasonable steps to ensure that: the personal data is accurate and where necessary, is kept up to date; and if personal data is needed to make decisions about a data subject but is inaccurate, such personal data is erased, rectified or supplemented (having regard to the processing purpose).\n\nData privacy principle 4\n\nWe are careful with sensitive information\n\nSensitive information is a type of personal data that is of a particularly private nature and includes (among other things) personal data about a person's race, ethnic origins, trade union membership and health and biometric information, as well as criminal record information. We must ensure that sensitive information is processed only when necessary and only if: the data subject consents; or if processing is:\n\nrequired in order to comply with our legal obligations,\n\nis expressly permitted under local data privacy laws or local labour laws and the relevant personal data originates in that jurisdiction; or\n\nnecessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life, health or safety of any person.\n\nData privacy principle 5\n\nWe protect our disclosures of personal data\n\nWe protect disclosures of personal data (including but not limited to when it is transferred across national borders) as follows:\n\nDisclosures outside the Rio Tinto Group: If we need to disclose personal data outside the Rio Tinto Group (for example, to an external service provider or to a third party who is authorised to receive the personal data), we must ensure that:\n\nthe disclosure is protected by contractual data privacy clauses approved by Ethics & Compliance or Rio Tinto Legal. This must include an assessment of whether any transfers across national borders comply with applicable data privacy laws\n\nthe relevant data subjects have consented to the disclosure\n\nthe disclosure is otherwise required by law or is or is expressly permitted under local data privacy laws and the relevant personal data originates in that jurisdiction.\n\nDisclosures within the Rio Tinto Group: Disclosures within the Rio Tinto Group are protected by the Rio Tinto Data Transfer Deed if it is necessary to share personal data outside of the jurisdiction where the personal data was first collected. Company secretarial and each Group business will ensure that any new Group companies sign up to the Rio Tinto Data Transfer Deed.\n\nAn overview of international disclosures/transfers (both within the Rio Tinto Group and to external service providers) is at Appendix 2a. Also, Appendix 2b outlines requirements for assessments prior to international disclosures.\n\nData privacy principle 6\n\nWe must secure personal data\n\nGeneral data security obligations: Personal data must be kept secure and protected against accidental, unauthorised or unlawful processing, including against loss and unauthorised access, destruction, misuse, modification or disclosure. This means ensuring that Rio Tinto has appropriate technical and organisational measures in place. Data security obligations apply whether personal data is stored in hard copy form (eg paper) or in electronic form (eg in databases). The key rules are:\n\naccess to personal data about other people should be on a \"need to know\" basis only\n\neach Group business must implement the Rio Tinto Group Standard on Acceptable Use of Information and Electronic Resources and the Group Procedure on Information and Cyber Security (administered by Cyber Security in IS&T) to ensure that appropriate physical, technical and organisational security measures are in place at all stages of the personal data 'life cycle'.\n\nInternal reporting of Data Privacy Incidents: Each Data Privacy Incident must be immediately reported to Ethics and Compliance. Where required by applicable data privacy laws, Ethics & Compliance will ensure that a data breach is notified to the competent authority(ies) and affected data subjects.\n\nData privacy principle 7\n\nWe limit retention of personal data\n\nPersonal data must be kept only for as long as necessary for the lawful purpose for which it is processed (as notified to the relevant individuals), or for the time required or permitted under local laws (whichever is the shorter).\n\nPersonal data will be retained in accordance with the Records Retention and Disposition Schedule (made under the Rio Tinto Records Management Standard and as updated from time to time), which sets out periods for which different types of records containing personal data are needed. After such time, records containing personal data must be securely destroyed (in the case of physical records) or permanently deleted (in the case of electronic records) in accordance with Rio Tinto’s Records Retention and Disposition Schedule or applicable local laws (whichever imposes the strictest obligations). To the extent possible, all archived copies and back-up copies should be destroyed at the same time and in the same manner as any original records that contain the personal data.\n\nData privacy principle 8\n\nWe respect data subject rights\n\nData subjects have the right to:\n\nseek access to personal data that Rio Tinto holds about them\n\nseek correction of inaccurate, incomplete or out of date personal data\n\nseek erasure of their personal data\n\nbe provided with information about how their personal data is processed\n\nask for processing of their personal data to cease (particularly if the processing is likely to cause damage or distress, or if the processing is for direct marketing purposes)\n\nbe notified if the Group business has made a decision about the data subject that is based on automated data processing alone (so that the data subject can ask for a review of the decision, if necessary)\n\ncomplain about the processing of their personal data\n\nwithdraw previously given consent regarding Rio Tinto's processing of their personal data.\n\nThere are legal exceptions to the exercise of these rights, and Rio Tinto will review each request on a case by case basis, by reference to the laws of the country where the data subject is located (or if the country where the data subject is located has no data privacy laws, or no data privacy laws containing the relevant right, by reference to the data privacy laws in Australia). Requests from data subjects to access their rights should be referred to the Data Privacy Lead for the relevant region who will advise on how the request needs to be responded to.\n\nAppendix 3 contains more information about how to exercise data privacy rights.\n\nData privacy principle 9\n\nWe apply Privacy by Design\n\nWe must ensure that data privacy compliance is integrated into our personal data processing activities. Threshold Privacy Assessment:\n\nEthics & Compliance will undertake a Threshold Privacy Assessment if it is proposed to:\n\nintroduce a new or expanded personal data processing technology or system\n\noutsource personal data processing functions\n\ncollect or generate new personal data categories, or to process existing personal data for a new purpose.\n\nThe Threshold Privacy Assessment will consider:\n\nthe nature of the personal data\n\nthe proposed processing purpose\n\nproposed disclosures of the personal data, including any proposed trans-border data flows.\n\nThis information will be collected as part of the Security Risk Assessment (SRA) process undertaken by Cyber Security, or separately by Ethics & Compliance.\n\nPrivacy Impact Assessment: If the Threshold Privacy Assessment indicates that the proposed processing is likely to result in a high risk to the privacy rights of data subjects, Ethics & Compliance will conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment. The Privacy Impact Assessment will identify steps that must be taken to mitigate the risk and to ensure that Rio Tinto complies with its obligations under this Standard and applicable data privacy laws.\n\nData privacy principle 10\n\nWe don't spam\n\nWe must limit our use of personal data to send marketing communications. All marketing communications (however distributed) must:\n\nclearly identify the relevant Group business or Group company as the sender, and how it can be contacted;\n\nbe sent with the consent of the recipient/data subject, unless Ethics & Compliance has advised that consent is not required in the relevant country where the proposed recipients are located; and\n\ncontain an unsubscribe or opt out facility. Opt outs must be acted upon and records amended accordingly.\n\nAppendix 1\n\nOverview of personal data collections and processing\n\nRio Tinto collects and processes the following categories of personal data for a range of business purposes, including:\n\nManaging people data: Personal data about employees, prospective employees and contractors (HR Personal Data) is collected for human resources (HR) purposes, such as administering and managing employment contacts and contracts of engagement, for other legitimate business reasons relating to employment and to meet legal, regulatory and compliance obligations. The personal data that is processed includes identity and contact information, data about employment history, training and qualifications, performance information and information needed to pay salaries and other benefits and to manage the employment or engagement process or for the purposes of recruitment.\n\nManaging business relationships with individuals within customers, suppliers and other external parties such as public sector agencies and joint venture partners. Personal data about individuals within external organisations is collected for business purposes such as supplying goods to corporate customers or acquiring services from corporate suppliers, entering into and fulfilling contracts, for communications and external relations purposes. This is often limited to 'business contact' information about contact people within companies and agencies, and information about interactions with Rio Tinto.\n\nManaging shareholder relationships: Personal data from shareholders (Shareholder Personal Data) is collected for purposes related to their shareholding in Rio Tinto, including for the purposes of issuing or transacting in shares, paying dividends, regulatory reporting and shareholder communications. Shareholder Personal Data may include a shareholder's name, address, shareholding details, tax file number, and bank account details. Shareholder Personal Data is collected by Rio Tinto and our behalf by the external manager of our share register. From time to time this data may be provided to other external service providers for the purposes of paying distributions or mailing shareholder communications, or to the extent permitted by legislation to authorised securities brokers, persons inspecting the register, bidders for Rio Tinto's securities, or certain regulatory bodies including the Australian Taxation Office.\n\nSafety, security and legal obligations: Personal data is collected from visitors to our sites (staff and non-staff) for safety and security purposes (HSES Personal Data). This can include information to verify identity and collection of images by closed circuit television (CCTV). Rio Tinto also collects personal data in the course of complying with its legal obligations (for example, to meet obligations under anti-money laundering legislation and whistleblowing legislation). In addition, Rio Tinto collects aggregated data from the open-source internet that might contain user names and other personal data published by users of public pages, to alert or signal potential security risks and threats.\n\nManaging community relationships: Personal data is collected from members of communities where Rio Tinto conducts mining and other operations, for the purposes of engaging and interacting with those communities (Communities Personal Data). This will include names, contact details and information about the interactions of individual community members with Rio Tinto, where needed to respond to correspondence and to manage community relationships.\n\nRio Tinto collects personal data directly from data subjects wherever possible.\n\nRio Tinto does not sell and does not propose to sell personal data.\n\nUnless described above (ie in relation to Shareholder Personal Data) or unless required by law or for the purposes of legal proceedings, disclosures of personal data are generally limited to other members of the Rio Tinto Group (eg Rio Tinto shared services companies) or to external service providers that help Rio Tinto to conduct its business. Sometimes this involves transfers across national borders - more information about international disclosures is contained in Appendix 2.\n\nPersonal data may be stored in Rio Tinto's local systems or databases, in the Rio Tinto Business Solution (currently a SAP system that is hosted in Australia), or on infrastructure owned and operated by external service providers engaged by Rio Tinto. Where external service providers are engaged to assist Rio Tinto to process personal data, Rio Tinto requires such service providers to comply with contractual privacy and data protection obligations and applicable data privacy laws. Disclosures within the Rio Tinto Group are governed by Rio Tinto’s internal Data Transfer Deed. More information about personal data processing can also be located in Privacy Statements that Rio Tinto makes available when personal data is collected (see references in Appendix 3 below).\n\n[Privacy Act 1988: Australian Privacy Principle 1.4(a) and (b) and (c); also California Consumer Privacy Act]\n\nAppendix 2\n\nInternational disclosures\n\na. Overview of international disclosures\n\nAn overview of Rio Tinto's global operations and the countries where it operates is on the Rio Tinto website.\n\nThis explains where each of the Rio Tinto product groups operates, on a \"country by country\" basis.\n\nIf you are employed or engaged by or have business dealings with a particular Rio Tinto product group, your personal data may be exchanged between Rio Tinto Group companies that are in the countries listed for that product group.\n\nAlso, your personal data may be processed by Rio Tinto \"shared services companies and external service providers that provide services to the Rio Tinto Group in one or more of the following countries:\n\nRio Tinto companies performing \"shared services\" are located in the following countries: Australia, Canada, India, Mongolia, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nExternal service providers that assist the Rio Tinto Group to perform HR and other shared service functions, and which process personal data on behalf of one or more companies in the Rio Tinto Group are located in: Australia, Canada, the European Union, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nShareholder personal data is processed in Australia and the United Kingdom by Rio Tinto and by the external manager of our share register.\n\n[Privacy Act 1988: Australian Privacy Principle 1.4(f) and (g)]\n\nb. Assessment prior to international disclosures\n\nPrior to transferring personal data outside the country where it was collected, the relevant Group business will carry out the following assessment (with assistance from Ethics & Compliance):\n\nWe will verify whether the data subjects were informed that their personal data will be transferred.\n\nWe will verify whether the transfer is covered by onward transfer provisions or other provisions in Rio Tinto’s inter-company agreement (the Rio Tinto Data Transfer Deed), or whether additional clauses are required.\n\nInternational transfers of sensitive information require review from Ethics & Compliance.\n\nFor disclosures outside the Rio Tinto Group, we will ensure that the third party can ensure the security and privacy of the personal data. We may ask the third party to provide a description of the technical and organisational measures in place to protect the personal data. Rio Tinto’s Cyber Security team will assess whether these measures are sufficient (eg as part of its Security Risk Assessment).\n\nAppendix 3\n\nData subject rights and complaints\n\na. General data subject rights\n\nPlease complete a Data subject request form if you wish to exercise your rights under data privacy principle 8, including to:\n\nseek access to personal data that Rio Tinto holds about you\n\nseek correction or erasure of inaccurate, incomplete or out of date personal data\n\nbe provided with information about how your personal data is processed\n\nsubject to whether the right of ‘data portability’ is a right under the data privacy laws of your country, receive a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and request that we transmit personal data you provide to us to a third party\n\nsubject to whether the right to request cessation of processing is a right under the data privacy laws of your country, request processing of your personal data to cease on a temporary or permanent basis (eg if the accuracy of the personal data is contested or the processing is unlawful in your opinion, or if the processing is likely to cause damage or distress, or if the processing is for direct marketing purposes)\n\nseek information about or a copy of the mechanisms we use to transfer your personal data\n\nrequest processing of your personal data to cease (eg if the processing is likely to cause; damage or distress, or if the processing is for direct marketing purposes)\n\nwithdraw consent you have previously provided in relation to Rio Tinto's processing of your personal data.\n\nYour request will be forwarded to the Data Privacy Lead for your region, who can also provide you with the data subject request form. Rio Tinto will aim to respond within a reasonable period after the request is made or from when information required to process the request is received (or otherwise as required under local laws).\n\nAs explained in data privacy principle 8, there are legal exceptions to the exercise of the rights listed above, and Rio Tinto will review each request on a case by case basis, by reference to the laws of the country where the data subject is located.\n\nb. Questions or complaints\n\nIf you have any questions or wish to make a complaint about the processing of your personal data or a complaint about Rio Tinto’s response to your request to exercise your data subject rights, you can do so by emailing aske&c@riotinto.com or by reporting this as a Data Privacy Incident to Ethics & Compliance.\n\nData Privacy Leads are responsible for investigating and responding to complaints, unless the complaint is about the Data Privacy Lead's processing of personal data. In such circumstances, another person will be appointed to investigate and respond to the relevant complaint.\n\nIf you are not satisfied with how your complaint has been addressed, complaints may be made to, where available, the relevant data privacy regulator or data protection authority in your country. This will be explained in the response to your complaint or you can find out more information about how to complain to the data privacy regulator or data protection authority in your region from your Data Privacy Lead or by contacting aske&c@riotinto.com\n\n[Privacy Act 1988: Australian Privacy Principle 1.4(d) and (e)]\n\nCertain functions of the ‘person in charge of the protection of personal information’ under Quebec data privacy law are delegated to the Data Privacy Lead for Canada (who is supported by the Ethics & Compliance data privacy team in undertaking such functions).
