The duo will promote research, design and deployment of decarbonisation tools for the steel value chain. The company had previously done similar research with BlueScope and also partnered with Schneider Electric to explore decarbonisation efforts.\n\nElsewhere Rio Tinto and Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) teamed up to study the feasibility of replacing natural gas with hydrogen in alumina refineries to reduce emissions including testing at the Yarwun Alumina Refinery in Gladstone.\n\nSome of the company’s key investments include an agreement with the Canadian government to invest up to C$737m ($533.6m) in the Rio Tinto Fer et Titane (RTFT) operations in Sorel-Tracy, Québec in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and expand research and development. The company also invested C$240m ($188m) to boost the production of low-carbon aluminum billets at its Alma smelter in Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec.\n\nThe company made a number of significant acquisitions too including an $825m deal to take over the Rincon lithium project in Argentina from Rincon Mining. With a reduced carbon footprint, the Rinco project is anticipated to produce battery-grade lithium carbonate. Rio Tinto also acquired a 49% interest in Canadian mining firm Turquoise Hill, which holds a controlling stake of 66% in the large-scale copper-gold mining project Oyu Tolgoi.\n\nThe company also formed a joint venture (JV) with steel production firm China Baowu Steel Group (Baowu) to develop the Western Range iron ore project in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, and collaborated with battery metals innovator Nano One Materials to enhance the latter’s multi-cathode (multi-CAM) commercialisation plan.\n\nCompany Profile\n\nRio Tinto is an international metals and mining company that carries out the mining, exploration, and processing of various mineral resources. It supplies a range of minerals and metals, including aluminium, diamonds, uranium, copper, gold and iron ore.\n\nRio Tinto also supplies industrial minerals such as borax, titanium dioxide and salt. The company operates port and rail facilities, smelters, refineries, processing plants, shipping, and commercial and research facilities.
