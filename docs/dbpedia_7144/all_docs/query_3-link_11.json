        "text": "To meet the challenges of climate change, we need to innovate. Some of the technologies we’ll need to decarbonise are yet to be proven – and many more are yet to be discovered. According to Professor Scott Stern an innovation expert at MIT Sloan School of Management, we all have the power to innovate. Here are his tips for nurturing innovation: 💡 Empower your team to take risks. 💡 Be open to new ideas and ways of working. 💡 Test 2 choose 1. 💡 Partner with others.

Reina, owner of Cumbres Andinas laundry, is an example of this commitment. “Since winning the laundry contract a year and a half ago, our business has steadily grown,” Reina says. “This opportunity has helped me provide a secure future for my children.” We’re proud to support Reina and Laundry on the Summit, and many other local businesses like hers. As the Rincón Lithium project transitions from exploration to operation, we're committed to growing together, building a sustainable future for the region. #Rincón #Lithium #Communities\n\nDid you know Rupont, a family-owned textile factory in Salta, Argentina, supplies all the uniforms for our Rincón Lithium Project? From base layers to parkas, Rupont keeps our team safe and warm. “The experience was incredibly rewarding,” Maria, Rupont’s founder and owner, says. “It pushed us to innovate and improve, exactly what we strive for. Rio Tinto’s support has been instrumental in our growth, and we’re proud to be a part of this exciting project.” #Rincón #Lithium #Communities\n\nWe’re on an on-going journey to building a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace for everyone, everywhere, everyday. It's been 2 years since we released the Everyday Respect Report and began implementing the 26 recommendations. One of those recommendations was to identify and remedy any facilities at our sites found to be less than satisfactory; like assessing lighting and security. Check out the 📽️ 👇 to see some of the improvements we've made to one of our villages in the Pilbara, Western Australia. #EverydayRespect #Safety\n\n“I love the idea of connecting a community and having a pathway for our technical professionals to continue their progression.” 🌟 RioExpert Hayley is a rockstar geologist. When it comes to Ore Body Knowledge, she’s at the top of her field. 📊 Hayley’s a big believer in using technology to gain a better understanding of the ore bodies we mine. 🏆 She is actively involved in our Global Geoforums, which bring together the geoscience community across Rio Tinto. She even spoke about it on the global stage at last year’s World Mining Congress in Brisbane, Australia. #FindingBetterWays #Geoscience #Geologist\n\nThe strength of our relationships with the communities where we operate is fundamental to our business. Without the support from host communities we can't operate successfully. In 2023: 📈 We sourced 16.8% of contestable spend from local suppliers, a 2.3% increase from 2022. 🔍 We independently assessed 25 assets against the cultural heritage co-management maturity framework. 🧑🏫 Our human rights team delivered 35 tailored training sessions, targeting 11 assets and 12 functional teams globally. Swipe through 👇 to learn more about our global Communities and Social Performance (CSP) targets by 2026. #FindingBetterWays\n\n\"I support Rio's vision by utilising remote sensing and space sector-based driven technologies.\" 🌘 We know there's more to the moon than meets the unaided eye thanks to advanced remote-sensing technology, developed by space agencies for lunar regolith (soil) exploration. 🛰️ Iuma, our Principal Adviser on the Discovery team, is leading the charge to adapt space-based sensing technologies developed for the moon and Mars, for terrestrial mining. 🌏 By applying lunar exploration insights to Earth, luma's work is helping us find stellar ways to harness our planet's resources more holistically and responsibly. #FindingBetterWays\n\nMeet Gregori, who is a Purchasing Officer for our Rincón Lithium Project in Argentina. He is passionate about seeing local businesses thrive alongside the project. “Since Rio Tinto arrived, there’s been a surge in local suppliers joining our projects,” he says. “My proudest contribution is helping these businesses grow and thrive.” Not only does Gregori champion local suppliers, but he’s also committed to safety, environmental responsibility, and building strong community relationships. 🔗 Learn more about Rincón: https://lnkd.in/gYNrxGAy #Rincón #Lithium #Communities\n\nBetween Rio Tinto, Qantas and BHP, we’ve committed A$80m to the Silva Carbon Origination Fund. The fund will give us access to large-scale, high-integrity carbon credits from land reforestation projects integrated with sustainable agriculture. We’re absolutely committed to decarbonising our operations, but many of the technologies we need will take time to develop and implement. Meanwhile, our investment in the Silva Carbon Origination Fund helps us meet our compliance obligations with high-integrity carbon credits. “We’re thrilled to have Rio Tinto, Qantas and BHP as foundation investors in the Silva Carbon Origination Fund,” Raphael Wood, Silva Capital Co-Managing Director, says. “Their partnership and commitment highlight the importance of high-integrity carbon credits in the transition to a low-carbon economy. “This fund represents not only an investment in carbon abatement but a significant milestone in Australia’s carbon market, that will, importantly, support the long-term success of our farming communities and nature repair.\" Read the full announcement 👉 https://lnkd.in/gkwwbQbh #FindingBetterWays #Decarbonisation"
