        "text": "That message was delivered by representatives of unions and civil society organizations from around the globe at the Rio Tinto – Voices of Resistance public meeting held on 10 April in London.\n\nThe meeting was organized by London Mining Network and hosted by John Vidal of The Guardian.\n\nIt was part of a series of activities leading up to the Rio Tinto annual shareholders’ meeting being held next Tuesday.\n\n“As we increase our organizing efforts, we are also strengthening our alliances with groups that want to make Rio Tinto a more worker friendly, sustainable company,” said IndustriALL Assistant General Secretary Kemal Ozkan.\n\nIndustriALL will release the report Unustainable: the ugly truth about Rio Tinto at the company’s shareholders’ meeting. The report is part of IndustriALL’s global campaign at Rio Tinto."
