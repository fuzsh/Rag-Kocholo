If the eventual destination of the product sold through traders is not known, then revenue is allocated to the location of the product at the time when the risks and rewards of ownership are passed. Rio Tinto is domiciled in both the United Kingdom and Australia.\n\n*Consolidated sales revenue by destination has been adjusted to classify Taiwan and China together as ‘Greater China’ whereas previously Taiwan was included in Asia."
