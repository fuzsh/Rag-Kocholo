        "text": "ICMM members are in the process of completing site-level self-assessments and third-party validation of conformance with the Mining Principles. All members need to disclose the results of their self-assessments within their sustainability reports covering the 2022 reporting period, usually published in 2023, or before. Third-party validation follows these self-assessments. Members have the freedom to schedule self-assessments and validations as they wish, as long as they are meeting ICMM’s deadlines, and therefore different levels of disclosure will be available from different members over the next few years.\n\nIn 2019, the Church of England Pensions Board and the Council on Ethics of the Swedish National Pension Funds wrote to 683 extractive companies, including ICMM’s company members, asking them to disclose details of their tailings storage facilities. ICMM is supportive of greater transparency on this important issue. Members have responded to this request and have published details of the tailings storage facilities that they own or operate on their websites."
