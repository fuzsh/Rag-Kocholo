        "text": "LONDON — Rio Tinto, one of the world’s largest mining companies, has big plans for pulling even more iron ore from the earth.\n\nIt is spending billions of dollars to expand its existing operations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, where driverless trucks the size of three-story buildings haul iron ore out of 15 mines. The trouble is, the buildup comes just as Rio Tinto’s single biggest customer, China, is losing economic steam and global demand for raw materials like iron ore and copper has been cooling.\n\nOn a single day in early March, the spot market price of iron ore — the main ingredient in steel — fell by more than 8 percent, and it is down 12 percent for the year. The price of copper, another essential raw material for industry, has recently hovered near four-year lows.\n\nThough mining executives tend to take the long view of their markets, where price cycles are part of the game, some analysts say that this time the industry may be staring at a deeper set of problems from which miners like Rio Tinto could have trouble extracting themselves. Even as China’s decades-old appetite for steel may be abating, there is a potential iron-ore glut coming because so many mining companies increased production to chase prices that for years were alluringly high.\n\nThe stock fell by 13 percent from mid-February to mid-March and since then has regained only about half that ground, even as broader indexes have been on the rise.\n\nRio Tinto is “definitely the most exposed major mining company” to iron ore, said Richard Knights, an analyst at Liberum, a London-based investment bank. Iron ore accounted for about 85 percent of the company’s $3.7 billion in net earnings last year.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
