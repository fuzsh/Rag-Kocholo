        "text": "Rio Tinto is a leading international mining group headquartered in the UK, combining Rio Tinto plc, a London and New York Stock Exchange listed company, and Rio Tinto Limited, which is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. The two companies are joined in a dual listed companies structure as a single economic entity, called the Rio Tinto Group.\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to all Rio Tinto staff and all the companies in the Rio Tinto Group (which may be described as \"Rio Tinto\", \"Group businesses\", \"we\" or \"us\" in this Privacy Policy also).\n\nStructure\n\nThis Privacy Policy is in two parts. It contains:\n\nRio Tinto's Data Privacy Standard which includes 12 Data Privacy Principles that apply whenever and wherever Rio Tinto collects and processes personal data; and\n\nOnline privacy and cookies statement, which sets out additional information about your privacy if you use this website.\n\nA Glossary has been included at the end of the Standard which defines key terms (in red).\n\nQuestions and contact information\n\nIf you have any questions or complaints about your privacy or wish to exercise your rights as a data subject, please refer to Data Privacy Principle 9 in the Data Privacy Standard and:\n\ncontact the data privacy co-ordinator for your Rio Tinto Group business;\n\ncontact your local Rio Tinto office; or\n\nemail us at compliance6@riotinto.com Your correspondence will be forwarded to the Rio Tinto data privacy co-ordinator for the relevant business unit within Rio Tinto.\n\nThis Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. This Privacy Policy was last updated on 7 March 2014.\n\nData privacy standard\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat does this Standard do?\n\nThe Data Privacy Standard sets out the minimum rules (Data Privacy Principles) that apply whenever and wherever Rio Tinto collects and processes personal data. Note that:\n\npersonal data means all information relating to any identifiable individual.\n\nprocess and processing covers everything we might do with personal data.\n\nThe Data Privacy Principles reflect the common principles and requirements under data privacy laws (sometimes known as data protection laws or privacy laws) in the countries where Rio Tinto operates.\n\nWhy is compliance with this Standard important?\n\nAt Rio Tinto, the lawful and correct handling of personal data is critical. At its simplest, people need to be able to trust us to respect their privacy and how we handle their personal data when working with us or doing business with us.\n\nIn addition, we need to comply with privacy and data protection laws around the world. Applying the Data Privacy Principles in this Data Privacy Standard helps us to do this.\n\nWho does this Standard apply to?\n\nThis Standard applies to everyone who works for Rio Tinto, and to each Rio Tinto Group business. We must comply with the Data Privacy Principles and also with local laws that apply to the processing of personal data. If there is a conflict between the requirements under the Data Privacy Principles and local laws, you should comply with the most stringent requirement. Your Data Privacy Co-ordinator, Rio Tinto Compliance or Rio Tinto Legal can advise you if you're unsure. Any variance from the Data privacy standard must be approved by the Global Head of Compliance.\n\nWhere can I obtain more information?\n\nMore detailed guidance on data privacy is available in the Rio Tinto Data Privacy Manual. This is a \"how to\" guide that has been developed for Data Privacy Co-ordinators and other Rio Tinto staff who process personal data as part of their job, or who need a more detailed understanding of data privacy at Rio Tinto.\n\nIf you have questions about data privacy at Rio Tinto, you should contact the Data Privacy Co-ordinator for the Group business that you work for or deal with. A listing of Data Privacy Co-ordinators is available from the data privacy page on the Prospect portal (Compliance community). If you are external to Rio Tinto or have a data privacy question, you can send an email to compliance6@riotinto.com.\n\nData privacy principles\n\nThe following Data Privacy Principles reflect the minimum rules that apply to the collection and processing of personal data at Rio Tinto.\n\nData Privacy Principle 1: We limit our processing of personal data\n\nWe must only collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process personal data for specific and limited purposes. In particular, we can only process personal data:\n\nfor the legitimate business purpose we collected it for (eg as explained in a collection notice);\n\nfor a related purpose(s) that the data subject would reasonably expect;\n\nfor other purposes that the data subject (the person that the data relates to) consents to; or\n\nif the processing is required in order to comply with our legal obligations.\n\nWe can't process personal data unless this test is satisfied.\n\nA stricter test applies when sensitive information is processed (see Data Privacy Principle 5: We are careful with sensitive information and Government-issued numbers).\n\nData Privacy Principle 2: Our collections are lawful and fair and we only collect what we need\n\nOur collections of personal data need to be lawful, fair and necessary for a specific, legitimate business purpose. We must collect only that amount of personal data that we need in order to conduct business. Personal data collections must not be excessive.\n\nData Privacy Principle 3: We are open about what we collect\n\nIf we need personal data, we will, where practicable, collect it directly from the data subject.\n\nWe will notify data subjects that we're collecting their personal data, by providing a collection notice either when personal data is collected, or as soon as possible afterwards.\n\nA general overview of the types of personal data collected by Rio Tinto, the purposes of collection and how personal data is stored, can be viewed in Appendix 1.\n\nData Privacy Principle 4: We check data quality\n\nWhen we collect and process personal data, we should take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal data is accurate, complete and up to date.\n\nThere are risks for both Rio Tinto and data subjects if we use inaccurate, incomplete or out of date personal data, particularly if it is relied upon to make decisions that affect data subjects. The more sensitive the data, the greater the risk to the data subject if poor quality personal data is used or disclosed.\n\nCollecting personal data directly from the data subject (under Data Privacy Principle 3: We are open about what we collect) is a way to ensure the quality of personal data. If we intend to use personal data that is of the type that can change over time, its currency and accuracy should be checked.\n\nData Privacy Principle 5: We are careful with sensitive information and Government-issued numbers\n\nSensitive information is a type of personal data that is of a particularly private nature and includes (among other things) personal data about a person's race, ethnic origins, trade union membership and health information.\n\nWe must ensure that sensitive information is collected only when absolutely necessary and only if:\n\nthe data subject consents; or if\n\nthe collection is\n\nrequired by law;\n\nnecessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life, health or safety of any person; or\n\nnecessary for legal proceedings.\n\nWe can only process sensitive information for the purposes notified to the data subject (when we obtained consent) or for the other specific purposes listed above.\n\nGovernment-issued numbers also need to be processed with care, as their collection, use and disclosure is strictly regulated in a number of Rio Tinto countries (for example, tax file numbers in Australia and social security numbers in France and Canada). We must only process Government-issued numbers as permitted under local laws.\n\nWe must never use a Government-issued number (in relation to a data subject) as the basis for how we organise personal data about a data subject. Government-issued numbers should not be our only way of identifying a data subject.\n\nData Privacy Principle 6: We take care when we share personal data\n\nWe must ensure that our disclosures of personal data are adequately protected and lawful. This is summarised below; but if you have questions please contact your Data Privacy Co-ordinator.\n\nDisclosures outside the Rio Tinto Group\n\nIf we need to disclose personal data outside the Rio Tinto Group (for example, to an external service provider), we must ensure that:\n\nthe disclosure is protected by contractual data privacy clauses approved by Rio Tinto Compliance or Rio Tinto Legal; or\n\nthe relevant data subjects have consented to the disclosure.\n\nRio Tinto Compliance or Rio Tinto Legal should also confirm if disclosures are required by law.\n\nDisclosures within the Rio Tinto Group\n\nDisclosures within the Rio Tinto Group are protected by the Rio Tinto Data Transfer Deed. Company secretarial and each Group business need to ensure that new companies sign up to the Data Transfer Deed.\n\nInternational disclosures\n\nAs a global company, we need to disclose personal data across national borders. However we must ensure such disclosures comply with data privacy laws.\n\nMore information about the countries where Rio Tinto operates, and the location of key external service providers (data processors) can be viewed in Appendix 2.\n\nData Privacy Principle 7: We must secure personal data\n\nPersonal data must be kept secure from unauthorised access, loss, destruction, misuse, modification or disclosure. This applies to personal data whether in hard copy form (eg paper) or in electronic form (eg in databases). The key rules are:\n\naccess to personal data about other people should be on a \"need to know\" basis only; and\n\neach Group business must implement the Rio Tinto Information security standards (administered by Global security) to ensure that appropriate physical, technical and organisational security measures are in place at all stages of the personal data 'life cycle'.\n\nData Privacy Principle 8: We don't keep personal data forever\n\nPersonal data must be kept only for as long as it is needed for proper business purposes, or for the time required or permitted under local laws (whichever is the shorter). After such time, records containing personal data must be securely destroyed (in the case of physical records) or permanently deleted (in the case of electronic records).\n\nData Privacy Principle 9: We respect data subject rights\n\nData subjects have the right to:\n\nseek access to personal data that Rio Tinto holds about them;\n\nseek correction of inaccurate, incomplete or out of date personal data;\n\nbe provided with information about how their personal data is processed;\n\nask for processing of their personal data to cease (particularly if the processing is likely to cause damage or distress, or if the processing is for direct marketing purposes);\n\nbe notified if the Group business has made a decision about the data subject that is based on automated data processing alone (so that the data subject can ask for a review of the decision, if necessary); and\n\ncomplain about the processing of their personal data.\n\nExceptions can apply in the case of access and correction rights, and Rio Tinto will review each request on a case by case basis.\n\nMore information about how data subject rights can be exercised (and relevant procedures) can be viewed in Appendix 3a.\n\nUnder some data privacy laws Rio Tinto is required to give data subjects the option of remaining anonymous or using a pseudonym (if practicable). More information can be viewed in Appendix 3c.\n\nData Privacy Principle 10: We are accountable for compliance\n\nEach Group business must appoint at least one person to act as its Data Privacy Co-ordinator, and notify Rio Tinto Compliance when such appointments are made.\n\nThe Data Privacy Co-ordinator should be the first point of contact for data privacy questions from the Group business that she or he represents.\n\nThe Data Privacy Co-ordinator is accountable for data privacy compliance by the Group business they represent, and should have an understanding of the personal data processing that is carried out by that Group business. Data Privacy Co-ordinators must have sufficient authority and resources to conduct their duties under the Data privacy standard.\n\nEveryone at Rio Tinto who processes personal data must comply with the Data privacy standard, and is accountable for compliance with data privacy laws. If you have questions about data privacy, ask your Data Privacy Co-ordinator.\n\nData Privacy Principle 11: We train our people\n\nEveryone at Rio Tinto who processes personal data as a significant part of their role should receive data privacy training and be provided with information about how to access this Data privacy standard. Data Privacy Co-ordinators should receive additional training designed for their role. Training will be provided by Rio Tinto Compliance and must be completed as directed by Rio Tinto Compliance. More information is available in the Data Privacy Manual.\n\nData Privacy Principle 12: We don't spam\n\nOne way we limit how we process personal data is to limit how we use personal data to send marketing communications. This is a broad term (reflecting the approach under anti-spam legislation in countries where Rio Tinto operates), but does not include Rio Tinto communications to staff.\n\nAll marketing communications (however distributed) must:\n\nclearly identify the relevant Group business or Group company as the sender, and how it can be contacted;\n\nbe sent with the consent of the recipient/data subject (which may be able to be implied from an existing business relationship or shareholding);\n\ncontain an unsubscribe or opt out facility. Opt outs must be acted upon and records amended accordingly.\n\nBreaches of Data privacy standard\n\nBreaches of the Data privacy standard or local data privacy laws may be reported to:\n\nyour manager or supervisor;\n\nyour local compliance manager or your Data Privacy Co-ordinator;\n\na Rio Tinto lawyer;\n\nRio Tinto Compliance; or\n\nvia Speak-OUT\n\nBreach reports need to be immediately brought to the attention of the Data Privacy Co-ordinator for the relevant Group business and Rio Tinto Compliance. Rio Tinto Compliance will work with the Data Privacy Co-ordinator plus the compliance manager for the Group business, Rio Tinto Legal and Global security to respond to the identified breach.\n\nReview of Data privacy standard\n\nThis Standard will be reviewed at least once every three (3) years.\n\nGlossary\n\nCollection notice: a notice that needs to be provided to data subjects when we collect their personal data, or as soon as possible thereafter. More information about what we need to include in collection notices can be viewed in Appendix 4.\n\nData Privacy Co-Ordinator: a person appointed under Data Privacy Principle 10.\n\nData Privacy Principles: the principles in the Data Privacy Standard that Rio Tinto Group companies and staff must apply when processing personal data.\n\nData subject: the individual to whom personal data relates.\n\nGroup business: includes all companies, product groups, business units, global functions and corporate offices in the Rio Tinto Group.\n\nLegitimate business purpose: a purpose that is directed at Rio Tinto achieving its business objectives and that complies with all relevant laws and regulations.\n\nMarketing communications: means communications and publications that have a purpose of marketing or promoting Rio Tinto or its products, but does not include staff communications.\n\nPersonal data: all information relating to any identifiable individual (whether living or deceased).\n\nProcessing: all actions taken in relation to personal data including collecting, using, disclosing, recording, organising, storing, transferring, amending, deleting, destroying, retrieving, accessing, hosting or otherwise handling.\n\nRio Tinto Data Transfer Deed: the deed executed between Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc on 1 July 2009 (as amended from time to time) and to which Rio Tinto Group companies are bound under executed Deeds of Accession.\n\nRio Tinto Group: all the businesses which are wholly or majority owned or managed by Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited (whether directly or indirectly).\n\nSensitive information: personal data (including information or an opinion) about an individual's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions and memberships, religious or philosophical beliefs or associations, trade union membership, criminal record, health or the health services they have received or details of sexual life.\n\nAppendix 1\n\nOverview of personal data collections and processing\n\nRio Tinto collects and processes personal data for a range of business purposes, including:\n\nManaging human resources: Personal data about employees and prospective employees and contractors is collected for HR purposes. This will include identity and contact information, information about employment history, training and qualifications, information required to pay salaries, compensation and other benefits, performance information;\n\nManaging business relationships with customers, suppliers and other external \"stakeholders\".

This is usually limited to 'business contact' information;\n\nManaging shareholder relationships: Personal data from shareholders is collected for purposes related to their shareholding in Rio Tinto, including for the purposes of issuing or transacting in shares, paying dividends, regulatory reporting and shareholder communications. This personal data may include a shareholder's name, address, shareholding details, tax file number, and bank account details. Shareholder personal data is collected by Rio Tinto and our behalf by the external manager of our share register. From time to time this data may be provided to other external service providers for the purposes of paying distributions or mailing shareholder communications, or to the extent permitted by legislation to authorised securities brokers, persons inspecting the register, bidders for Rio Tinto's securities, or certain regulatory bodies including the Australian Taxation Office;\n\nSafety, security and legal obligations: Personal data is collected from visitors to our sites for safety and security purposes. This can include collection of images by closed circuit television (CCTV). Rio Tinto also collects personal data in the course of complying with its legal obligations (for example, to meet obligations under anti-money laundering legislation and whistleblowing legislation); and\n\nManaging community relationships: Personal data is collected from members of communities where Rio Tinto conducts mining and other operations, for the purposes of engaging and interacting with those communities.\n\nRio Tinto collects personal data directly from data subjects wherever possible.\n\nPersonal data may be stored in Rio Tinto's local systems or databases, in the Rio Tinto Business Solution (a SAP system that is hosted in Australia), or on infrastructure owned and operated by external service providers engaged by Rio Tinto. Where external service providers are engaged to assist Rio Tinto to process personal data, Rio Tinto requires such service providers to comply with contractual privacy and data protection obligations and applicable data privacy laws.\n\n[Privacy Act 1988: Australian Privacy Principle 1.4(a) and (b) and (c)]\n\nAppendix 2\n\nInternational transfers\n\nAn overview of Rio Tinto's global operations and the countries where it operates can be viewed on the Our business page.\n\nThis explains where each of the Rio Tinto product groups operates, on a \"country by country\" basis.\n\nIf you are employed or engaged by or have business dealings with a particular Rio Tinto product group, your personal data may be exchanged between Rio Tinto Group companies that are in the countries listed for that product group.\n\nAlso, your personal data may be processed by Rio Tinto \"shared services\" companies and external service providers that provide services to the Rio Tinto Group in one or more of the following countries:\n\nRio Tinto companies performing \"shared services\" are located in the following countries: Australia, Canada, India, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nExternal service providers that assist the Rio Tinto Group to perform HR and other shared service functions, and which process personal data on behalf of one or more companies in the Rio Tinto Group are located in: Australia, Canada, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nShareholder personal data is processed in Australia and the United Kingdom by Rio Tinto and by the external manager of our share register.\n\n[Privacy Act 1988: Australian Privacy Principle 1.4(f) and (g)]\n\nAppendix 3\n\nData subject rights and complaints\n\na. General data subject rights\n\nPlease complete a Data subject request form if you wish to exercise your rights to:\n\nseek access to personal data that Rio Tinto holds about you;\n\nseek correction of inaccurate, incomplete or out of date personal data;\n\nbe provided with information about how your personal data is processed; or\n\nrequest processing of your personal data to cease (eg if the processing is likely to cause; damage or distress, or if the processing is for direct marketing purposes).\n\nYour request will be forwarded to the Data Privacy Co-ordinator for the Group business that you work for or deal with. A list of Data Privacy Co-ordinators is available at http://compliance.riotinto.org... or if you are external to Rio Tinto, from the Group business that you deal with. Data Privacy Co-ordinators can also provide you with the Data subject request form. Rio Tinto will aim to respond within 30 days of receipt of information required to process the request (or otherwise as required under local laws).\n\nb. Complaints\n\nIf you wish to make a complaint about the processing of your personal data, you can do so:\n\nby completing a Data subject request form;\n\nthrough Group business channels (eg by providing your complaint directly to the general manager of the Group business that you deal with); or\n\nthrough Speak-OUT.\n\nData Privacy Co-ordinators are responsible for investigating and responding to complaints, unless the complaint is about the Data Privacy Co-ordinator's processing of personal data. In such circumstances, Rio Tinto Compliance or Rio Tinto Legal will investigate and respond to the relevant complaint. If you are not satisfied with how your complaint has been addressed, complaints may be made to the data privacy regulator or data protection authority in your country.\n\n[Privacy Act 1988: Australian Privacy Principle 1.4(d) and (e)]\n\nc. Anonymity and pseudonyms\n\nData Privacy Principle 9 refers to the fact that under some data privacy laws, data subjects need to be given the option of remaining anonymous or using a pseudonym when they deal with a company. Having regard to the purposes that Rio Tinto undertakes data processing (as described earlier), generally this will not be practicable as Rio Tinto needs to know the identity of the person it is hiring or doing business with. However, if there are circumstances where anonymity or the use of pseudonyms is practicable, this will be indicated on forms used to collect personal data (eg indicating that names and addresses are optional).\n\nAppendix 4\n\nCollection notices\n\nA collection notice must explain:"
