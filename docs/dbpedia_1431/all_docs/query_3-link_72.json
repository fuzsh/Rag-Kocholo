        "text": "New Bedford Ship Supply was put in the national spotlight when Tommy Lee Jones wore a blue hat with the name of the store on it in the movie Finestkind.\n\nAccording to store personnel, the person in charge of props for the movie bought some hats, shirts and other merchandise at the store prior to its filming in early 2022. One of those hats ended up being worn by Jones in the movie.\n\nAfter the release of the movie, people came to the shop to buy the hat Jones wore. But while the buzz from the movie put the store in the national spotlight, local fishermen have been relying on the store and its products for decades.\n\nShip Supply offers a full service\n\nNew Bedford Ship Supply, at 108 Front St., has been a resource for local commercial fishermen dating back to the 1930's.\n\nPeter Sousa, who has worked at New Bedford Ship Supply for 30 years, said they are proud to be one of the oldest businesses of its kind.\n\n\"We sell everything a scalloper needs to catch the scallops as far as the gear, the rings, the links, the chains, the rope, the twine tar,\" he said. \"Everything to catch the scallops and the fish too.\"\n\nNew Bedford Ship Supply specializes in a wide range of supplies for ships, including equipment tools and provisions for both commercial fishermen and recreational sailors.\n\nNew Bedford Ship Supply also delivers goods to the docks for the convenience of their customers.\n\nThe company has been supplying fishing vessels with all the provisions, gear, tools, and personal items they need to go out fishing.\n\n“We sell everything for the commercial fisherman, whatever they need, from gloves to Red Bull,” he said.\n\nThe main building with the retail store is located at 108 Front St. There are also two buildings out back on Hamilton and Senna streets that have been there since the early 1800s. One building is stocked with food and provisions, including frozen food for fishermen when they go out to sea. The other building stocks tools of the trade and construction supplies.\n\nTheir clothing is worn all over\n\nSousa said prior to the hat appearing in The Finestkind movie, they were already well known in the fishing community.\n\n\"We’re pretty much known up and down the East Coast.” he said.\n\nSousa said he has heard that fishermen from Maine to North Carolina to Florida have been spotted wearing the store's apparel.\n\nAll in the family\n\nRasmus and Sarah Tonnessen were the original owners of New Bedford Ship Supply. Considered a key figure in helping establish the growth of the scallop fishery in New Bedford, Rasmus opened the New Bedford Ship Supply Company in 1935.\n\nHarriet Didriksen inherited the business from her aunt and uncle after they died, and the business is still in the family, with Dana Didriksen serving as the current owner today. Dana is Harriet Didriksen's daughter-in-law and the grandniece of the Tonnessens.\n\nOwner honored with statue\n\nSeveral years ago, artist Erik Durant created the bronze sculpture of a fishing family at Tonnessen Square Park on City Pier 3 on the New Bedford waterfront in honor of Rasmus Tonnessen.\n\nThe statue depicts a fisherman kneeling and hugging his daughter with one arm, while placing his other hand on his son’s shoulder. His wife stands closely behind, touching her son and husband.\n\nThe statue was created at the request of a special committee to memorialize all of the fishing men, women and families who have lived and died by those fleets, and all of the fishing families to come.\n\nStore hours\n\nNew Bedford Ship Supply, located at 108 Front St., is open from 7 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and 7 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Saturdays."
