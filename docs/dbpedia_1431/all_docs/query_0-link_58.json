The Austrian international made way for Davies on the left-back position moving to the center.\n\n\"It is of substantial help for every youngster to have an experienced performer like him around. He is one of the best left-back's in the world,\" he commented, adding Alaba told him about the secrets on the far-left side.\n\n\"I guess my future is the one of a left-back.\"\n\nDavies not only filled the gap surprisingly well. His convincing appearances as a substitute made him irreplaceable and have exploded into life this season.\n\nThe rookie developed to one of the top three as he dropped back from his original position as a winger. A career jump could hardly be steeper.\n\nAlphonso Davies (R) of Bayern Munich vies with Stefan Lainer of Monchengladbach during a German Bundesliga match between Borussia Monchengladbach and FC Bayern Munich in Monchengladbach, Germany, Dec. 7, 2019. (Photo by Ulrich Hufnagel/Xinhua)\n\nDavies' unusual story still sounds like a fairy tale of modern football. He was born and raised in a refugee camp in Ghana until the age of five. His parents fled Liberia in the civil war and moved to Canada.\n\nThe gifted 19-year-old Canadian made his way to Bayern from the Vancouver Whitecaps for reported 19 million euros in January 2019. The talented youngster quickly turned into one of the most exciting prospects in world football.\n\nHis value is rated at around 50 million euros.\n\nDespite several offers from big European clubs, the former winger recently signed a five-year contract with the Bavarians until 2025.\n\nDue to his enormous speed qualities (35.3 km/h), teammates call him \"Usain\" as his speed reminds them of former sprint star Usain Bolt.\n\nDavies turned into a role model for millions of young footballers himself.\n\nHe is encouraging young talents to not only play football but benefit from other sports such as volleyball, basketball, and cross country running. \"I benefitted a lot from other sports for my football career as it turned out to be an advantage to me multi-tasking,\" he said.\n\nHe doesn't feel any pressure as many kids want to follow his example. \"Always enjoy every training and every game. And don't forget to always enter the training ground or pitch with a smile on your face,\" he emphasized.\n\nHe called the chance to go to school the essential thing in a child's life. \"I enjoyed every moment being in school as football doesn't last forever, so you need an education long term.\"\n\nWhile his childhood is a distant memory, his mother is still calling him her \"refugee baby.\" \"I am thankful to my parents as they had no easy life. If they hadn't dared to leave Africa, I wouldn't have made my way in professional football,\" he underlined.\n\n\"She always told me to be a good boy and respect people,\" he said, adding that might be the most important message for him.\n\nHis life seems a perfect example that it is always worthwhile to stick to one's dreams. Today Davies is a strong supporter of the UN Refugee Agency's Covic-19 response.\n\nAlphonso Davies (top) of Bayern Munich vies with Erik Thommy of Dusseldorf during a German Bundesliga match between FC Bayern Munich and Fortuna Dusseldorf in Dusseldorf, Germany, Nov. 23, 2019. (Photo by Ulrich Hufnagel/Xinhua)\n\nHe is playing virtual e-sports football games to raise money for charity projects connected to refugees. \"I want to spread the word to everyone to do as much as possible to help,\" he said.\n\nWhen Bayern crushed Premier League side, Chelsea, 3-0 in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie, he mesmerized a world audience.\n\nNow he admitted his father is a Chelsea fan admiring Didier Drogba. At home, \"there was always a Chelsea game on when I was growing up.\"\n\nHe said games behind closed doors are a challenge for all footballers, but they seem inevitable to maintain everyone's health. \"It is not my favorite procedure as fans creating atmosphere have always been a vital part of football,\" he said.\n\nRegarding his goals with Bayern, he intends to continue the so-far successful season and forget about the advance achieved in the first leg against Chelsea facing the second leg in some time.\n\nAlthough his time at Bayern is only the starting point of a hopefully long career, he is thinking about the time after. He said football comes first, but \"I eventually want to be an actor. I like entertaining people.\" â– "
