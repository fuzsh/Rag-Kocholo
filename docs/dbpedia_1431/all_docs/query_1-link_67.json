        "text": "Erik Thomas Holland, 57, of Corinth, Mississippi, passed away suddenly and too soon on March 6, 2023. He was born on April 23rd, 1965 in Roswell, New Mexico to Carolyn Cozier Holland and MSG Harold T. Holland. He spent most of his life in Hampton, Virginia and relocated to Corinth, Mississippi in 2017. He is survived by his only daughter, Valerie Coia and husband Justin and his siblings: David Holland and wife Gwen, and Andrea Holland and niece Lucy, and Mark Holland.\n\nErik was a beloved father, brother, and friend, known for his sense of humor and generous spirit. He was the kind of person who would give the shirt off his back to a perfect stranger if he could see they were in need. He was baptized and saved in 2022 and was so excited to have found God again. He voraciously read the Bible cover to cover and enjoyed chatting with friends from church about what he’d learned.\n\nErik worked as a flooring installer for most of his life, where he was respected for his hard work. Erik loved the outdoors and the peace and solace they provided. He was also an incredibly talented artist just like his father, drawing much of his inspiration from nature. He would often gift drawings and paintings to those he loved.\n\nErik will be deeply missed by Valerie, Dave, Mark, Andrea, his loving ex-wife Barbara Holland, and other relatives, friends, and colleagues. He was especially close with the Farr family of Corinth and lovingly referred to them as his “second family”. He touched the lives of many people and will always be remembered for his kindness and humility.\n\nA private celebration of life will be held to honor Erik's memory.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to The Freedom Center, located at 42 CR 278, Corinth MS 38834.\n\nErik may be gone too soon, but he will never be forgotten. May he rest in peace."
