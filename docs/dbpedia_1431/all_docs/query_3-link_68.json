        "text": "No — in short, I have a collection of tutorials and I use the tools, on camera, for multiple hours a week. I figure that should give you a really good idea of how they work so a free trial is not necessary. Obviously, if you are deeply unsatisfied with the product, email me and I will make it right.\n\nThe PGA tools are generally updated for the current tournament within 60 minutes of the salaries being released on DraftKings. The salary release “triggers” the system to load in the field and all the corresponding data. There are a few tools, like the Tournament Predictor, which require more data. Those tools might not update until Monday evening or Tuesday morning for an event with a Thursday start.\n\nThe Projected Ownership is usually updated on Tuesday, once the industry sentiment begins to settle. If there is enough movement, they will update again on Wednesday for an event with Thursday start.\n\nIf there is scheduled maintenance, that will be announced in the Slack channel or via my Twitter account.\n\nNo, neither. I do not release picks or lineups. This site allows you to do your own research and make the best decisions for yourself. You might hear me say who I’m betting on each week but that is in no way an endorsement for who you should bet on. I say it all the time “don’t let anyone else spend your money” and that includes me!\n\nI’ve created tutorials that can be found here for how I use the tools. There are little tips and tricks to help get you running as soon as possible. The good thing about RickRunGood.com is that the tools are constantly being improved. When they are improved, I’ll make updated videos to reference the newest additions."
