Hunter), two children\n\nProjects\n\nI am currently conducting analysis on new dialect formation, primarily using acoustic analysis of phonetic variables, among Mexican Americans in a community in southern Texas. I have conducted research involving acoustic analysis and speech identification experiments on African American English. I have also been working on a project involving how durable old dialect boundaries are in Ohio.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nDirector, Linguistics Program\n\nVarious departmental committees\n\nOffice Hours\n\nMon: 1:30 p.m. – 2:30 p.m.\n\nWed: 1:30 p.m. – 2:30 p.m.\n\nResearch Publications\n\nThomas, Erik R., ed. 2019.
