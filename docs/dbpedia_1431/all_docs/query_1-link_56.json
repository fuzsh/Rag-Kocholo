        "text": "Sporting Kansas City acquired left back Logan Ndenbe in a transfer from EA Guingamp in the French second division in January 2022. Ndenbe arrives in Kansas City after spending his first five professional seasons in Europe with Belgian top-flight side KV Oostende and French club Guingamp. He has logged nearly 50 professional appearances since 2017 and represented Belgium at the U-17 through U-21 levels. A native of Mouscron, Belgium, Ndenbe developed in the Royal Excel Mouscron academy before joining KV Oostende as a 17-year-old in 2017. He played 15 matches in three seasons with the club, featuring in the Belgian First Division A as well as the league’s playoff competition for the UEFA Europa League. Ndenbe left Belgium in July 2020, signing for Guingamp to mark the start of a successful stint in the French Ligue 2. He made 16 appearances for the club during the 2020-21 campaign and took another step forward during the first half of the 2021-2022 season, playing every minute in 12 league starts while adding one assist. On the youth international stage, Ndenbe rose through the Belgian U-17 and U-18 teams before earning his Belgium U-21 debut in June 2021 for his first of six matches in 2023 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying. He has started in each of the team’s last four games since Oct. 12, helping the team go 3-0-1.\n\nSporting Kansas City signed outside back Kayden Pierre to a Homegrown contract early in the 2021 season after impressing at preseason camp in Arizona with the Sporting KC first team. Pierre is the 18th Homegrown Player to emerge from the Sporting Kansas City Academy. He made his debut for the club against Leon in the Leagues Cup on Aug. 10, 2021 before making his MLS debut at Colorado on March 12, 2022. Born and raised in Rochester Hills, Michigan, Pierre joined the Sporting KC Academy in 2018 from Vardar SC in his native state. He has represented Sporting at the U-15, U-17 and U-19 levels since then, and helped guide the U-17s to the U.S. Soccer Development Academy Playoffs in 2019. Capable of playing at left back and right back, Pierre gained his first professional experience in 2020 when he signed an amateur academy contract with Sporting Kansas City II. He started two of three USL Championship appearances in 2020, including a 90-minute outing in a dramatic 2-1 road victory over Indy Eleven on Sept. 30. On the international stage, Pierre has competed for the United States U-14 and U-16 national teams over the last five years. He participated in multiple U-14 training camps from 2016-2017 before jumping to the U-16s for training camps from 2018-2019."
