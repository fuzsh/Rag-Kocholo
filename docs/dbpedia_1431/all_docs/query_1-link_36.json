        "meta_description": "With profound sorrow we announce the passing of Erik Thomas Jones, who departed this life on June 13th, 2024 in Salem, UT at the age of 33. He was deeply loved by many and our hearts ache as we miss him immensely. He was one of the rarest and best. Erik was born on December 20th, 1990 to Ray and Barbara Jones of Spanish Fork, UT. He stayed close to home and resided in Spanish Fork, UT with his wife of 12 years and 2 sweet children whom he protected and cherished fiercely. He was known to family as Bud, Eeek, Mate, Scooby, and Earache. His friends called him Larry, Ricky Scaggs, and Enrique, among others. Growing up, Erik was that goofy kid that others grew to adore. He discovered his passion for automotives early on as his toddler projects consisted of tying up his sister’s barbies and other toys to haul behind the back of his trikes; later, assembling model cars to put on his bedroom display, and as a young teen he would fix up and sell old vehicles to make a profit or give away. After graduating from Spanish Fork High school, class of 2009, he went on to pursue his passion and became an incredibly talented and hardworking diesel mechanic. He excelled tremendously in the jobs that he did inside and outside of work and was a master at his specialty. He was an incredibly self-driven learner and used his knowledge to take care of anyone in any moment. He found enormous joy as a father and would do anything for his kids. “Shooga-booga (Kader-bug)” and “Bruiser (Rooskie)” were his whole world. His time off was spent playing and taking care of them, supporting his son’s ball games, working on projects, getting covered in dirt from popping wheelies on his dirt bikes and riding ATV’s. His hilarious pranks were one of a kind and impossible to forget. Erik lived life to bring happiness and joy to others, whether he did that intentionally or through the simple presence of his gentle, endearing spirit that was so loveable. His heart was as big as his warm, all-embracing hugs that are so dearly missed. His humor was as infectious as his giant, beautiful smile. He lived a very admirable life as a man of integrity, grit, deep selflessness and passion for his loved ones. His example has left an everlasting impression on our hearts. Erik’s memory will be kept alive by his loving family: his father, Raymond Jones; his mother, Barbara Jones; his children Kade and Kendle; his wife Kelsie; sisters Cali Jones (Richard), Alison Jones (John-Robert), Danielle McMillan (Patrick); 3 nieces and 2 nephews. A viewing will be held on Wednesday, June 19th from 6-8 pm at Walker Funeral Home located at 187 S. Main St. Spanish Fork, UT 84660. The funeral service will be held Thursday, June 20th at 11:00 with a viewing from 9:45-10:45 am, also at Walker Funeral Home. Share Now",
