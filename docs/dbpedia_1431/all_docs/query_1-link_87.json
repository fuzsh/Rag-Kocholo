        "text": "Erik Thomas Andersen forever blessed our lives with his arrival on February 20, 1983—the second son born to Gregg and Joan Andersen. Over the next 39 years his journey would touch countless as a loving son, a steadfast brother, and a generous friend.\n\nErik's adventures begin in Mankato exploring the fields and hills of the Oak Knoll area. By age one he was walking, by age two he was a fixture on the slopes of Mt. Kato - where, for the next twenty years, he would spend endless hours skiing, racing, and laughing with his brother Ryan, cousins Mitch and Mike, and so many friends. These were special days.\n\nWhen not on the ski hill, Erik attended the Mankato Public Schools — from the halls of Roosevelt Elementary to the trails of Dakota Meadows and finally the steps of Mankato West High School where he graduated from in 2001.\n\nSome of his time in high school were spent building relationships, while feeding his competitive spirit with athletics. Erik, a qualifier for the Jr. Olympic Ski team, raced regionally in USSA events and played soccer for the Scarlets. \"Finny,\" as he was called by his teammates, was well-admired for his quick leg moves, that often left defenders flat-footed in comparison. It was a memorable four years for Erik, and his talented teammates; a joy for all who were lucky enough to watch them on the pitch.\n\nAs a youth, Mankato may have been Erik's physical home, but it was the wild of Alaska that was always his spiritual calling. Erik was introduced to our northernmost state by his family during their summer travels together. As an adult, Alaska became the compass for the rest of his life. Guided by his love of salmon fishing on the Kenai River, Erik brought a precision to his meticulous methods of sealing the fish — just as he did with many things in his life.\n\nBy 2006 his love of life's simple pleasures — nature, biking, skiing, fishing, and hunting led him to make Girdwood, Alaska his permanent home.\n\nThere he earned his degree in Construction Management from the University of Alaska. Those skills eventually helped him construct his \"Off the Grid\" home in Crow Creek Canyon. He was very proud of this work he loved as it brought him even closer to the wild landscapes he so revered. It mattered not to Erik if the snow was blinding, the winds were howling; the beauty of the mountain always endured. Living with nature, adapting to it as the seasons changed, brought Erik peace.\n\nNature also eventually provided Erik with his career path. And like most of his life journeys, it was an adventure. His work took him to remote corners of Cuba, the Midway Islands and numerous villages throughout Alaska.\n\nHis work also brought him to the sea.\n\nEndless and mercurial the waters provided Erik with the opportunity to put his fishing expertise to work. In early July of 2022 Erik launched on what would be one of his last expeditions — a seven week journey on a commercial fishing boat. He returned to his home land momentarily on August 28, 2022, only to be unexpectedly taken from all who loved him so on August 30, 2022 — on the wings of Angels.\n\nGodspeed, Erik Thomas Andersen. (Finny)\n\nErik is survived by his parents, Gregg and Joan, his brother Ryan (Marina), his favorite niece Ella Andersen, Grandpa Ron, his god child, Anna Peterson and many aunts, uncles and cousins.\n\nMemorials may go to Mankato Children's Museum or Donors choice."
