        "text": "There is no disgrace in silver, particularly when the best player in the world has shot a final-round 62 and the quality of leaderboard is one of the highest in living memory.\n\nTeam GB’s Tommy Fleetwood was ultimately forced to bow to the extraordinary talent of Scottie Scheffler, who was such an appropriate gold medalist in what could one day be viewed as a truly notable week for professional male game.\n\nFleetwood announced that standing on the podium was “the most amazing moment of my career”, but of course there was despair mixed in with the pride, after he failed to replicate the success of Justin Rose, who won gold on the sports’ comeback after a 112-year absence in 2016.\n\nFleetwood, the world No 14, was so close not only to beating the world No 1, but also a collection of superstars including Jon Rahm, who looked the champion for so long on an excruciating Sunday, and Rory McIlroy, who reeled off five birdies to put himself in contention on the back nine.\n\nHowever, after he holed a 10-footer for a birdie on the 16th that took him level with Scheffler, who was then already in with his 19-under total, Fleetwood pulled his drive on the treacherous 17th and despite hitting a fine recovery from the rough, it disappeared over the back into the collar between the thick rough and the run-off. It was a horrible chip to take on at that stage and it duly rolled 20 feet past.\n\nThe bogey meant he was one behind and, although he believed he might have holed the chip on the 18th to enforce a play-off, it squeezed past. The 33-year-old actually fared well to hole the six-footer coming back or else he would have been involved in a sudden-death shootout with Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama, who picked up bronze. And Fleetwood, with his courageous 66, deserved better at the course where he starred in the 2018 Ryder Cup and where he won the French Open, adding this runner-up placing to those he gained in the 2018 US Open and the 2019 Open.\n\n“Part of me is a little disappointed, and yes, there were a few tears,” Fleetwood said. “But at the same time I never dreamed I’d be an Olympian, and I’m unbelievably proud to be an Olympic medallist. I gave it my best shot, and I’ve said before that the atmosphere and support has been just incredible here. If you don’t enjoy occasions like this, you won’t get much joy from the game of golf. This has been an unbelievable experience, one I’ll remember for the rest of my life.”\n\nRahm collapses spectacularly from commanding lead\n\nIn contrast, Rahm was utterly distraught. After the Spaniard had played the first 10 holes in six-under, he was four shots clear with eight holes to go. It was his to throw away and blimey, he did exactly that, bogeying the 11th and 12th, before a car-wrecking double-bogey seven on the par-five 14th, where he took four to get down from just off the green.\n\nBogeys on the 17th and 18th meant the LIV man missed out on the prize-giving altogether, an unfathomable notion just 90 minutes earlier. He was devastated.\n\n“I don’t remember playing a tournament and feeling like this,” he said. “I not only feel like I let myself down but to just not get it done for the whole country of Spain, it’s a lot more painful than I would like. I’m getting a taste of how much it really mattered.”\n\nThey were all saying the same. McIlroy, in fifth after a 66, declared it was the best event he had played in, apart from the Ryder Cup and Fleetwood was just as gushing. “Even though I didn’t win gold, a very good golfer did,” he said “I think golf showcased itself amazingly well this week, and we finished up with a great leaderboard.”\n\nScheffler removes all doubt he is Player of the Year\n\nAnd Scheffler did what Scheffler does, almost shrugging his shoulders when asked what it means for his legacy. In truth, there were waterworks from the Texan as well and there should be plenty more when he reflects on a campaign which has, so far, featured him winning seven times, with the Masters and Players titles about to have another illustrious companion in the trophy cabinet.\n\nHe played the back nine in six-under and Rahm summed up the absurd majesty under that pressure best of all. “I mean, nine-under is a joke of a round around here,” Rahm said. “But it’s not surprising at this point that Scottie is doing any of this.”\n\nJust as the argument that golf has no place in the Olympics can be consigned to the dustbin after this, so can the debate of who is Player of the Year. By winning The Open two weeks ago after prevailing at the USPGA two months before, Xander Schauffele thrust himself into the conversation, but after the defending Olympic champion struggled in this fourth round - in a share of the overnight lead he inexplicably fired a 73 to come ninth - Scheffler has removed all doubt.\n\n“I would say first and foremost I’m proud of the country I’m from. I’m proud to be American. I got emotional the other night watching the Gold Medal ceremony for the women’s gymnastics,” he said. “For me, it was just very emotional being up there on stage there as the flag is being raised and I’m singing the National Anthem. Yes, that’s definitely one I’ll remember for a long time.” Everyone will."
