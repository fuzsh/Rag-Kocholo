        "text": "GERMANY: New coach for Bayern; Schalke rallies to beat Augsburg\n\nBERLIN — Schalke twice came from behind to beat Augsburg, and Fortuna Düsseldorf won the Bundesliga's Rhine derby, on a day dominated by Bayern Munich parting company with coach Niko Kovac.\n\nBayern said Sunday it decided to let Kovac go after the team had its heaviest league loss in more than 10 years — a 5-1 defeat at his former side Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday.\n\n\"The performances of our team in recent weeks and the results have shown us that there was a need for action,\" chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said.\n\nThe 48-year-old Kovac had been in charge since the beginning of last season, when he led Bayern to a German cup and league double.\n\nSaturday's loss left Bayern four points behind leader Borussia Mönchengladbach in the Bundesliga.\n\nKovac's assistant, former Germany assistant coach Hansi Flick, was to take over the side \"for the time being,\" Bayern said.\n\nSCHALKE DIGS DEEP\n\nDavid Wagner's Schalke fought back to win 3-2 in Augsburg and move sixth in the Bundesliga.\n\nDaniel Baier scored a deserved opener for the hosts in the 38th minute but an own-goal from Stephan Lichtsteiner, while trying to clear Daniel Caligiuri's cross, pulled Schalke level in first-half injury time.\n\nAugsburg forward Alfred Finnbogason converted a penalty awarded through VAR in the 60th, but Schalke managed to turn the game around through goals from Ozan Kabak and Amine Harit.\n\nHarit capitalized on a mistake from Reece Oxford to score a fine winner in the 82nd.\n\nRHINE DERBY\n\nFortuna Düsseldorf beat Cologne 2-0 in the Rhine derby to leave its rival in the relegation zone.\n\nA penalty in the 38th minute from Rouwen Hennings and a fine individual goal from Erik Thommy in the 61st helped Düsseldorf to bounce back from a 2-0 loss at Paderborn.\n\nDüsseldorf climbed to 13th after 10 rounds.\n\n-- By Ciaran Fahey, AP\n\nITALY: 'Shame on you': Balotelli lashes out at fans for racism\n\nROME — Mario Balotelli's most important kick on Sunday had nothing to do with the curling shot that he whipped into the top corner of the goal from beyond the box.\n\nRather, it was the drop-kick the Brescia striker made moments earlier when he booted a ball high into the stands to express his frustration at racist chants from Hellas Verona fans.\n\nBalotelli then attempted to leave the field in the most high-profile incident yet in a Serie A season that has been marred by constant episodes of discrimination.\n\n\"Thanks to all the colleagues on and off the field for the solidarity expressed toward me and all of the messages received from you fans,\" Balotelli wrote later in Italian on Instagram, accompanied by a video from the match . \"A heartfelt thanks. You've shown yourself to be real men, not like those who deny the evidence.\"\n\nBalotelli was even more direct in a message he posted in an Instagram story over a video from the stands where monkey noises are clearly heard, followed by wild cheers when he kicked the ball into the stands. The message said: \"To the 'people' in this end who made the monkey noises: Shame on you. Shame on you. Shame on you in front of your children, wives, parents, relatives, friends and acquaintances..shame.\"\n\nIt was the second time this weekend that a Serie A game was suspended for offensive chants, after Roma supporters aimed anti-territorial chants at Napoli on Saturday.\n\nDerogatory chants have also been aimed at Romelu Lukaku, Dalbert Henrique, Miralem Pjanic, Ronaldo Vieira and Kalidou Koulibaly in Serie A this season. There was also a case of racist chants aimed by Verona fans at AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessie in September.\n\nVisibly upset as he fought for the ball near the corner flag at the end of the stadium where the monkey chants were emanating from, Balotelli had heard enough. He interrupted the action, picked up the ball with his hands and drop-kicked it into the crowd.\n\nBrescia teammates and Verona players went over to embrace Balotelli and persuaded him to stay as the referee ordered a warning to be read out over the stadium's public address system.\n\nVerona coach Ivan Juric said he didn't hear any racist chants.\n\n\"There was absolutely nothing,\" Juric said. \"There were a lot of whistles every time he had the ball but not racism. I didn't hear a single (chant).\"\n\nBrescia coach Eugenio Corini also said he didn't hear the offensive chants but added, \"If the referee decided to suspend the match and ask for that announcement to be made something must have happened.\n\n\"Honestly, I was far away and I didn't hear anything,\" Corini said.\n\nCorini was later fired by the club which has struggled this season and is near the bottom of Serie A. No new manager was immediately announced.\n\nThe match at the Bentegodi stadium was suspended for several minutes with Verona leading 1-0 at the time before it resumed.\n\nBalotelli, who is black, was born in Italy to Ghanaian immigrants and has represented Italy's national team. He recently returned to Serie A after several seasons in France.\n\nThe 29-year-old Balotelli also experienced racism at the beginning of his career in Italy, when he rose to prominence with Inter Milan.\n\nVerona went ahead 2-0 before Balotelli scored for Brescia and the game ended 2-1.\n\nBalotelli, who did not celebrate his goal, also hit the post in the first half of one of his best performances since joining Brescia — his hometown club — in August.\n\nVerona president Maurizio Setti also said the club didn't observe any racist chants but added that he talked to Balotelli afterward.\n\n\"I apologized to him if someone might have said something,\" Setti said.\n\nBalotelli did not speak with reporters after the match.\n\nSOARING SARDINIANS\n\nQuietly putting together a season that could be one to remember, Cagliari moved into contention for the Champions League spots with a 2-0 win at 10-man Atalanta.\n\nAn own-goal from Mario Pasalic and a goal from Christian Oliva moved Cagliari into sixth place and level on points with fourth-place Lazio and fifth-place Atalanta.\n\nCagliari has not qualified for European competition in a quarter century since reaching the semifinals of the 1994 UEFA Cup — the competition which has since been renamed the Europa League.\n\nThe top four finishers in Serie A qualify for the Champions League, while the fifth- and sixth-place teams enter the Europa League.\n\nAfter opening the season with two losses, Cagliari is now on a nine-match unbeaten run.\n\nIt's Cagliari's best start since winning its only Serie A title in 1970.\n\nWhat's more, it was the first time this season that Atalanta — which still leads the league with 30 goals scored — failed to score.\n\nCagliari also won away at Napoli and drew at Roma this season but coach Rolando Maran called this game his club's best performance.\n\n\"We decided the best way of approaching it was to force them to defend,\" Maran said.\n\nOTHER RESULTS\n\nAC Milan's struggles continued with a 2-1 loss at home to Lazio that left the Rossoneri in the bottom half of the table.\n\nCiro Immobile scored his 100th goal for Lazio in all competitions and Joaquin Correa got the winner after an own-goal by Bastos.\n\nUdinese won 3-1 at Genoa under interim coach Luca Gatti, who took over when Igor Tudor was fired Friday after the northeastern club conceded 11 goals in its previous two games.\n\nAlso, Fiorentina drew 1-1 with Parma, and Lecce and Sassuolo finished 2-2.\n\n-- By Andrew Dampf, AP\n\nSPAIN: Sociedad wins at Granada to pull level with Barca, Madrid\n\nBARCELONA, Spain — Cristián \"Portu\" Portugués scored two goals to give Real Sociedad a 2-1 win at Granada as his team pulled level on points with Barcelona and Real Madrid at the crowded top of the Spanish league on Sunday.\n\nSociedad's fourth victory in seven away matches moved it into third place, behind the league's two traditional powerhouses on goal difference.\n\nAtlético Madrid and Sevilla are one point behind. Granada fell to sixth place at two points off the pace after missing a chance to retake the league lead with a win.\n\nGranada, the surprise of the season after returning to the top flight, had kept four straight clean sheets at home before Portu struck his first goal in the 21st from a pass by Mikel Oyazabal.\n\nÁlvaro Vadillo equalized in the 36th with a free kick that Alejandro Remiro let bounce in front of him, hit his hands, and slip past in a glaring error by the goalkeeper.\n\nBut Sociedad coach Imanol Aguacil made attacking substitutions to go for the full three points. The move paid off when late substitute Adnan Januzai helped Portu to grab the 89th-minute winner.\n\nBoth of the visitors' goals came after pressure forced poor passes from Granada's defenders.\n\n\"I am happy for the goals, but also to be able to look at the standings and see us at the top,\" Portu said.\n\nSociedad was without top playmaker Martin Odergaard, who is nursing a right foot injury.\n\nON THE ROPES\n\nCelta Vigo manager Fran Escribá acknowledged that his job is at risk after his team lost 1-0 to Getafe at home in another poor performance.\n\nCelta started the season with big hopes after bringing in forward Santi Mina and midfielder Denis Suárez to support striker Iago Aspas, but it has lost four games in a row and has slipped into the relegation zone.\n\n\"Logically, the players are down, not just for today but for all the season. We have had terrible results this month,\" Escribá said. He didn't have \"any doubts\" about turning it around but \"I understand the situation is delicate and that the coach is always the first to go.\"\n\nGREAT GOALKEEPING\n\nAthletic Bilbao escaped with a point from a 0-0 draw at Villarreal thanks to the brave goalkeeping of Unai Simón.\n\nSimón made several difficult saves, including using his face to block a point-blank shot from Gerard Moreno that left him with a bright red mark from the impact.\n\n\"I think we did enough to win the match,\" said coach Javier Calleja after his 100th match in charge of Villarreal. \"But their goalkeeper was very good. He was the star of the match.\"\n\nHOME RECORD\n\nOsasuna broke a club record with 31 consecutive games without a loss at home when it beat Alavés 4-2 in a match that included three penalties.\n\nThe unbeaten run dates back to when Osasuna played in the second division before returning to the top flight this season. Jagoba Arrasate's side has since impressed with only two losses in 12 rounds, including a 2-2 home draw with Barcelona.\n\n\"It is an honor to write our names into the history of this club,\" said Roberto Torres, who scored the hosts' third goal.\n\nOTHER RESULTS\n\nValladolid eased to a 3-0 win over Mallorca. Valladolid, a modest club owned by former Brazil great Ronaldo, has only lost once in the last seven rounds.\n\nEibar fought back for a 2-1 win at bottom side Leganés, with Kike García scoring the 84th-minute winner. It was Eibar's first victory on the road this campaign.\n\n-- By Joseph Wilson, AP\n\nFRANCE: Video review has an impact as Saint-Etienne beats Monaco 1-0\n\nPARIS — Monaco was losing 1-0 at Saint-Etienne in the French league with about 20 minutes remaining on Sunday when video review made a significant impact.\n\nReferee Jérôme Brisard showed Saint-Etienne defender Wesley Fofana a red card for apparently impeding Jean-Kévin Augustin near the edge of the penalty area as the Monaco striker broke through on goal.\n\nThe linesman on the right side of the field had not raised his flag despite having a clear view of the action. But VAR determined that Augustin was narrowly offside when receiving the ball, and therefore Fofana's red card was overturned and Saint-Etienne got a free kick.\n\nIn the closing moments, Monaco's players converged around Brisard again when he showed defender Ruben Aguilar a red card for barging over Denis Bouanga as he made an inspired run from behind the halfway line up to the penalty area.\n\nAlthough Monaco's players were angry, it appeared a clear decision since Aguilar was the last defender and clearly stepped across to block Bouanga.\n\nMonaco was much the better side in the first half but spurned chances, and Bouanga made the breakthrough in the 59th minute when he side-footed in Romain Hamouma's left-wing cross from close range.\n\nThe win moved former Leicester coach Claude Puel's side up to eighth place, while Monaco is languishing in 15th spot.\n\nNICE RELIEVED\n\nThe pressure was growing on Nice coach Patrick Vieira after six matches without a win, so a 2-0 home victory against Reims was timely.\n\nIt was a first win since Sept. 21, when the south-coast team had climbed into third place. Nice's form then spiraled with four league defeats and a draw, followed by elimination from the League Cup midweek against second-tier Le Mans.\n\nNice was helped when visiting midfielder Moussa Doumbia was sent off in the 26th. Vieira's side quickly took advantage with midfielder Wylan Cyprien netting in the 32nd and defender Christophe Herelle getting the second shortly before the break.\n\n\"This win will do us a lot of good and give us some confidence,\" said Vieira, who was disappointed to hear home fans whistling his team at the end. \"We're in a complicated period, the three points are more important than the manner in which we play.\"\n\nNice climbed into 13th place.\n\nNANTES FALTERS\n\nNantes missed the chance to close the gap on leader Paris Saint-Germain to five points after losing 2-0 at Bordeaux.\n\nThe loss dropped Nantes down to third place behind Angers, while Bordeaux improved to sixth spot with goals from Guinea forward François Kamano and South Korea striker Hwang Ui-jo.\n\n-- By Jerome Pugmire, AP"
