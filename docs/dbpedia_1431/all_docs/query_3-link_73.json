Michael  Vlismas  As Christiaan Bezuidenhout led the South African golf team at the Paris Olympics, the greatest stage in sport was certainly a metaphor for a golfer who seems poised to make the biggest breakthroughs in his career.

        "text": "Bezuidenhout excelled as an amateur golfer, with highlights including winning the 2013 Western Province Amateur Stroke Play and Match Play, and the Eastern Cape & Border Stroke Play.\n\nHe joined the paid ranks in early 2015, the same year he won the Order of Merit on the Big Easy Tour. In December 2015, he won the Sunshine Tour Q-School. He finished runner-up to Brandon Stone at the first event of the season – the 2016 BMW SA Open, co-sanctioned with the European Tour. He went on to win the 2016-17 Sunshine Tour Rookie of the Year.\n\nHe earned his European Tour (now DP World Tour) card for 2018 and retained it for the 2019 season. In June 2019 he earned his first win on the Tour – the Estrella Damm NA Andalucía Masters – which also earned him entry into that year’s 2019 Open Championship. He finished third at the 2019 BMW PGA Championship to enter the world top 100 for the first time.\n\nIn February 2020 he won the Dimension Data Pro-Am and entered the top 50 on the World Golf Ranking. In November that year, Bezuidenhout won the Alfred Dunhill Championship at Leopard Creek Country Club. A week later, he claimed a wire-to-wire victory at the South African Open at Gary Player Country Club. He became the first player with back-to-back victories on the European Tour since Justin Rose in 2017.\n\nIn January 2024, Bezuidenhout tied his best finish on the PGA Tour with a runner-up finish at The American Express; one shot behind amateur Nick Dunlap. He claimed first place prize money due to Dunlap’s amateur status."
