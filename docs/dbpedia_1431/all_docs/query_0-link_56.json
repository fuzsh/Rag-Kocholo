        "text": "By Rich\n\nFrankfurt’s Luka Jovic scored 5 goals on Friday to catapult himself to the top of the Bundesliga’s scorers list and his club to a 7:1 win over Fortuna Düsseldorf. The win was Frankfurt’s third straight in the Bundesliga. Jovic’s goals came in the 27th, 34th, 55th, 69th, and 72nd minutes, and were complemented by goals from Sébastien Haller in the 21st minute, on a penalty, and again in the 50th minute. Frankfurt have scored at least once in all of their 8 Bundesliga matches so far this season, Haller has scored on all 4 of his penalty kicks, and Jovic has scored in each of Frankfurt’s last 4 matches. Jovic also became the first Frankfurt player to score 5 goals in a Bundesliga match, and the first player to do so since Robert Lewandowski did so against Wolfsburg in September 2015. Many Bundesliga fans will be watching the struggling FC Bayern München on Saturday when they travel to Wolfsburg. The club is currently 6th in the table, 4 points behind league leaders Borussia Dortmund, and winless in their last 4 matches. Robert Lewandowski, the league’s top scorer in the past 2 seasons, has only managed 3 goals in 6 appearances. Wolfsburg, however, are winless in their last 5 matches, after having won their opening 2 games this season, and will be playing without central midfielders Joshua Guilavogui and Ignacio Camacho, and new signing Felix Klaus, all of whom are injured. Another match to watch on Saturday will be that between Nürnberg and Hoffenheim, who are separated by only 1 point in the table. While Nürnberg lost 0:6 against Leipzig on Matchday 7, the hosts have taken an impressive 7 points from their 3 home matches so far, and Hoffenheim have lost their last 2 Bundesliga outings, owing in part to injuries a large group of regulars who will also not play this weekend. Looking ahead to Sunday, Hertha Berlin will look to maintain their perfect home record this season when they host Sport-Club Freiburg. A key to Hertha’s success this season has been Ondrej Duda, who has scored 5 goals so far this season, and it’s been 10 years since Hertha was ahead of Bayern in the standings. Freiburg has been struggling with injuries, including a shoulder injury to striker Nils Petersen and an ankle problem on the part of forward Florian Niederlechner, but have nevertheless managed to lose only 1 of their last 5 Bundesliga matches."
