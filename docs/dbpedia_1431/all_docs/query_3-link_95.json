        "text": "Golf fans were treated to a fantastic finish in the final round of golf at the 2024 Paris Olympics from Le Golf National on Sunday.\n\nThree years after Xander Schauffele won gold for Team USA at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the United States brought home another — this one from Scottie Scheffler, who turned in the best score of the day at 9-under 62. He needed every bit of brilliance to finish at 19-under for the tournament, one stroke ahead of Great Britain's Tommy Fleetwood (-18). Japan's Hideki Matsuyama brought home bronze with a final score of 17-under par.\n\nScheffler, who entered Sunday's Round 4 in a tie for sixth place at 10-under par, started his final round on a tear: He earned birdies on each of his first three holes to quickly jump to 13-under before earning par scores on the remaining six holes on the front nine. He was even better on the back nine, carding six more birdies (including four straight on Holes 14-17) to finish in a tie with Fleetwood at the time his round was completed.\n\n2024 PARIS OLYMPICS: Follow USA TODAY's full coverage of the Summer Olympics\n\nHowever, a bogey for Fleetwood on the par-4 17th hole gave Scheffler sole possession of a gold medal. Fleetwood gave an admirable effort on the 18th hole, narrowly missing a birdie on a lag putt to settle into a silver-medal finish.\n\nMatsuyama was similarly effective on Sunday, carding six birdies and no bogeys to claim bronze.\n\nHere's what the leaderboard looks like from Sunday's fourth and final round of men's golf at the 2024 Paris Olympics, including pairings, tee times, leaderboard, how to watch information and more:\n\nREQUIRED READING: Scottie Scheffler score today at 2024 Paris Olympics: Live Scorecard, results from Round 4\n\nOlympic golf leaderboard today\n\nResults, courtesy of the official Olympic leaderboard.\n\nRound 4\n\nBelow are the top 20 golfers, including ties, atop the leaderboard for Round 4.
