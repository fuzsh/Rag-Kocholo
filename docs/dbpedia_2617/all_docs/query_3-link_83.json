I am a folk art painter and cross stitch designer inspired by all things cozy and handmade.\n\nOn this site I will share what I’m making and what’s inspiring me, my favorite books and notes from the garden. I also love to share my travels to some of my favorite historical sites. I’m so glad you’ve decided to come by for a visit, thanks for spending some time here with me!"
