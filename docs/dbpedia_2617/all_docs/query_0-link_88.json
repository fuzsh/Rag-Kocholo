        "text": "The Nobel Prize is broadly viewed as the world's most esteemed honour. It has been given to individuals and associations consistently since 1901 for their accomplishments in their distinctive fields. However, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been acknowledged to 114 people starting from 1901. Every year the Swedish Academy conveys demands for designations of challengers for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Individuals from the Academy, individuals from writing foundations and social orders, teachers of writing, and essayists' associations are altogether permitted to select an applicant. In any case, it is not allowed to choose oneself. In October, individuals from the Academy vote and the applicant who gets the greater part of the votes is titled the Nobel Laureate in Literature. Notwithstanding, women have been winning Nobel Prizes since 1901, but in very small numbers compared to men. When the number to the 100 men received the Prize in Literature is compared, it demonstrates that it is almost impossible for women to approach the difference. On the other hand, in the course of a century when women writers have regularly been neglected, the accomplishment of 14 Nobel literary laureates will ideally prompt more noteworthy acknowledgment for the female creators behind a portion of the world's finest books, lyrics and plays. This study gives a brief information about the fourteen Nobel Prize women laureates in literature between 1901 and 2017. This information is limited to brief biographies of women who have won the Nobel Prize for Literature, their literary genres and outstanding works. Apart from these, the reasons why women writers are awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature are briefly mentioned.\n\nIn 1941 a short text with an unusal story was published in Reykjavík. Its reception and afterlife in Icelandic literature are no less unusual and, we think, worth exploring as a case study in the workings of the cultural memory of a nation coming to terms with its entrance on the international stage. The text was called Undir fána lýðveldisins [Under the Republic's Flag] and was the autobiographical account of Hallgrímur Hallgrímsson (1910–1942), a young Icelandic labourer and communist, of his experiences as a member of the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War in 1937 and 1938. This text, although it is not particularly well known today and has not been the focus of any major study, has inveigled itself into Icelandic literature on war and trauma time and again since its publication, thus becoming part of cultural memory in a particular way. In this paper we aim to address Ann Rigney's question what role literary texts play in the formation of cultural memory by tracing the trajectory and transformation of Hallgrímsson's text in Icelandic literature and public memorial culture from 1941 to 2001 and beyond, adopting Rigney's diachronic perspective into the genesis and reception of the work in order to examine its role in 'memorial dynamics' .1 Hallgrímur Hallgrímsson was born in 1910 in the eastern part of Iceland. He moved to Reykjavík in 1930 and became a member of the Communist Party and a union activist. He first came to the attention of the media and the authorities when he climbed on board the German cargo ship Eider while it was moored in Reykjavík harbour in 1933 and cut down its swastika flag. He went on to fight with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) for two years in 1937 and 1938, and on his return he wrote long articles on his experiences which were published in a left-wing newspaper. He was jailed in 1941 for his part in the so-called 'flyer-case' , where Icelandic union activists distributed flyers among British soldiers occupying Iceland at the time, warning"
