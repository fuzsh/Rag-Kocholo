Her archaeologist father died when she was 11, and her mother struggled to raise her three daughters. Sigrid was employed as an office worker at a young age, and began her writing career with several successful novels of women in contemporary Norway, the best known of which is \"Jenny\".\n\nShe married Anders Castus Svarstad in 1912, a Norwegian painter whom she had met in Rome, and they had three children. She struggled to write while tending to her family and running a household. In 1919, she moved to Lillehammer, Norway and built a large, beautiful house, Bjerkebæk. In this comfortable place she began studying and writing her medieval sagas. Her studies of the medieval church motivated her to convert to Catholicism. It was during this time her marriage ended.\n\nIn 1928, Sigrid Undset won the Nobel Prize for Literature for her historical novels of life in medieval Norway. The best known of these major works is the trilogy \"Kristin Lavransdatter\". The three books of the trilogy are the \"The Bridal Wreath\" (The Garland), \"The Mistress of Husaby\" (The Wife), and \"The Cross\". Sigrid's other historical novel cited by the Nobel Prize committee is the four-volume series, \"The Master of Hestviken\".\n\nWhen Germany invaded Norway in 1940, she was forced to flee to Sweden, and later to the United States. She supported her country’s cause with speeches and writing during the war years. She returned to Norway exhausted in 1945 still devastated by World War II memories—the loss of her elder son and the occupation of her home by the Germans."
