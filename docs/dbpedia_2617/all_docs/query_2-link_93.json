In 1924, she converted to Roman Catholicism. She fled Norway for the United States in 1940 because of her opposition to Nazi Germany and the German occupation, but returned after World War II ended in 1945.\n\nHer best-known work is Kristin Lavransdatter, a trilogy about life in Scandinavia in the Middle Ages, portrayed through the experiences of a woman from birth until death. Its three volumes were published between 1920 and 1922. Undset's Nobel Prize was awarded partly for this work, and partly for her four-volume work The Master of Hestviken, published between 1925 and 1927 and dealing with similar themes.\n\nShe died 10 June 1949.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nEvents\n\nDeath, Cause unspecified 10 June 1949 (Age 67)\n\nchart Placidus Equal_H.\n\nSource Notes\n\nBirth time unknown.
