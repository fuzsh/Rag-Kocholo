        "text": "What follows is a translation of Ida Coudenhove. “‘Gymnadenia und das Christentum in den Dichtungen der Sigrid Undset.” Die Schild genossen 10 (1930): 461–468. It is published with permission from the estate of Ida Friederike Görres.\n\nDuring her lifetime, Ida Coudenhove (1901–1971) was a prominent Catholic writer in German-speaking Europe. She is most well known by her married name, Görres.1 She usually went by Ida Friederike Coudenhove and then later Ida Friederike Görres.\n\nDie Schildgenossen was a German-language Catholic journal affiliated with the Catholic Youth Movement in Germany. The Catholic Youth Movement was closely associated with Fr. Romano Guardini, [End Page 140] who was a copublisher of Die Schildgenossen from 1924 to 1941.2 Heinz Kuehn, a scholar of Guardini translates the title Die Schildgenossen as “Comrades of the Shield,” and describes it as “a national Catholic periodical devoted to theological, liturgical and cultural subjects.”3 The Nazi government shut down Die Schildgenossen in 1941.\n\nSigrid Undset (1882–1949) was a Norwegian novelist, Catholic convert, and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1928.\n\nThe German edition of this article in Die Schildgenossen contained no citations (other than one parenthetical mention of a page number, apparently in an Undset novel, with no further information). For this English edition, I have added citations. To the extent possible, I have identified the sources of the quotations in this article, and I have quoted them from established English translations. Where there is no citation for a quotation, it is either Coudenhove giving voice to what she has heard from others or I was unable to find the source, and the quotation is thus my translation from the German text.\n\nIn this article, Coudenhove discusses how the novel The Wild Orchid by Undset (first published in German as Gymnadenia in 1929) relates to the following works by Undset, listed here with the translators (tr.) of the English editions and the date of the first edition in English. (For the bibliographical details of these works, please see the citations.)"
