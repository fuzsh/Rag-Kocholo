        "text": "Leading Bollywood actor Abhishek Bachchan paid tribute on Tuesday to a child actress and one-time co-star who was among 15 people killed in a plane crash in Nepal.\n\nBollywood child actress Taruni Sachdev was one among 15 tragically killed after an airplane carrying Indian and Danish tourists crashed into a hill near an airport in Nepal Monday. Bollywood actors including Amitabh Bachchan and his son Abhiskek have offered their condolences to the family.\n\n“Just reading that Taruni Sachdev the girl child artist in ‘Paa’, has perished in Nepal plane crash .. please god may this not be true,” Amitabh posted on his Twitter page.\n\nAt 14, Tarini had already featured in almost 50 ads and did a cameo in ‘Paa’. She was among 13 Indians who were killed when the aircraft crashed into a hill while coming in to land at Jomsom in western Nepal.\n\nShe was last seen on TV as a participant on Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Kahn’s game show “Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass Se Tez Hain?’ which is based on the popular American quiz show ‘Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?”\n\nOf the 13 Indians, who died in Monday’s crash, seven were from Mumbai. The small plane crashed, killing 15 people while six others miraculously survived, officials said.\n\nThe aircraft belonging to local carrier Agni Air crashed near Jomsom airport, a gateway to the nearby Annapurna mountain range, shortly after the pilot reported a fault."
