        "text": "Mumbai: The mortal remains of child artist Taruni Sachdev and her mother Geeta, who were killed in the Nepal plane crash, were consigned to flames at a crematorium here.\n\nThe deceased duo were brought here from Kathmandu last afternoon following which the last rites took place at the Santa Cruz cremation ground here at around 5.30 pm.\n\nThe two were among the 15 people killed in the Nepal plane crash on Monday.\n\n“We are still in state of shock...don't know what to say. I feel she was god's daughter, and has gone to God,” Taruni's father told reporters here.\n\nThe 14-year-old artist is best remembered for her role as Auro's (Amitabh Bachchan) friend in the national awarding winning film ‘Paa'.\n\nThough no celebrities attended the funeral yesterday, Vidya Balan, who essayed the role of Bachchan's mother in ‘Paa', said, “I don't know how to react to this...to wake up to a news of Taruni passing away...It is very unfortunate for any parent to lose their child. And I really pray to God to give strength to her father to cope with this.”\n\n“I remember Balki (director of ‘Paa') used to say that she (Taruni) is like a mature actor and you put her in any situation she will manage it,” the actress said at an event last evening.\n\nBig B and son Abhishek also condoled her demise on micro-blogging site Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead all the Breaking News Live on indiatvnews.com and Get Latest English News & Updates from Entertainment and Bollywood Section\n\nPaa\n\nTaruni Sachdev\n\nBig B\n\nindia tv news"
