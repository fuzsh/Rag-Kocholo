She was among 13 Indians who were killed when the aircraft crashed into a hill while coming in to land at Jomsom in western Nepal.\n\nAmitabh, 69, has memories of Jomsom.\n\n“Jomsom, where the plane crash in Nepal took place is where we shot Khuda Gawah, a raw airfield and most difficult to land on,” posted Big B.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan was equally saddened\n\n\"SHOCKED and very saddened to hear about the Nepal plane crash. Lost one of my cutest co-stars. Little Taruni Sachdev from PAA. Speechless,\" Abhishek tweeted."
