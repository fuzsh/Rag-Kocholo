I can do it on my own but I have an extremely busy schedule.The task is simple and I'll be really grateful to you.Please create a text file with names followed by an asterisk.For example,Rishi Kapoor*Deepika Padukone*Hrithik Roshan*Amitabh Bachchan*(and so on.....)\n\nI'll be really thankful if anyone could do this for me. Thank you.Or even simply the names of cricketers will do. I'll do the database specific formatting on my own. Won't take much time.I mean actors, not cricketers.\n\n[color=rgb(0,136,0);background-color:rgb(250,250,250);font-size:13px;]Gaurav Chanana also known as Rhehan Malliek[/color]\n\nOne of the entries\n\nAlso just\n\n[color=rgb(0,136,0);background-color:rgb(250,250,250);font-size:13px;]Sapru[/color]\n\nAnd V T V Ganesh (kind of stage nickname)\n\n[color=rgb(0,0,0);font-size:13px;]VTV [/color]Ganesh\n\nI agree. I am just saying, he needs to walk thorugh and fix issues before trying to update the DB."
