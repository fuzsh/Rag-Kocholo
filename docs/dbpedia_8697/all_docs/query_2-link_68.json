        "text": "Vellinakshatram is a 2004 Malayalam language movie directed by Vinayan, starring Prithviraj Sukumaran, Taruni Sachdev, and Sharmili in lead roles. The movie is a mystery-thriller and revolves around the life of a kid named Govindankutty (Prithviraj Sukumaran), who is an ardent fan of a popular actress Malavika (Sharmili). The movie starts with a scene from an award function where Malavika receives an award and Govindankutty admires her from a distance. He even asks her for an autograph but is interrupted by the security guard, and Malavika walks away. Later, Govindankutty comes across a beautiful girl named Gopika (Taruni Sachdev), who is new to the town and is staying with her grandmother. Govindankutty falls in love with her but doesn't express his feelings.\n\nIn the meantime, Malavika is found murdered, and the culprit is unknown. Govindankutty, who is devastated by the murder, takes it upon himself to investigate the murder and find the culprit. He discovers that Malavika's death is linked to her past, and someone who knew her from the past is responsible for her death. Govindankutty takes his investigation forward and discovers some shocking truths that stun him and the audience.\n\nThe movie's narrative is gripping, and the suspense is maintained till the very end. The performances of the lead actors, especially Prithviraj Sukumaran and Taruni Sachdev, are commendable. Prithviraj Sukumaran has portrayed his character with great dedication and showcases his acting skills well. Taruni Sachdev too has delivered an impressive performance and portrays her character with ease. The chemistry between the lead pair is also worth-mentioning.\n\nThe movie's direction by Vinayan is brilliant, and he has depicted the emotions of the characters very well. The background score and music by Berny Ignatius add to the movie's atmosphere and elevate the suspense. The cinematography by Manoj Pillai is also noteworthy, and he captures the beautiful locales of Kerala aptly.\n\nThe movie does have its share of flaws, mainly related to the pacing. At times, the movie feels slow, and the scenes could have been edited better. Also, the movie's climax could have been a little more impactful and could have left a lasting impression on the audience.\n\nOverall, Vellinakshatram is a must-watch for anyone who loves suspense-thrillers. With its good performances, great direction, and an intriguing storyline, the movie keeps you hooked till the very end. The movie's message about the dangers of blindly idolizing celebrities is also relevant even today."
