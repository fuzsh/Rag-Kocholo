        "text": "This past year has seen a lot of famous stars bid their goodbyes to life and the industry.\n\nThey will always be missed and have left a special mark with the work they have done. Here are a few of them.\n\n1. Rajesh Khanna\n\nHe is the latest star to join this list and regrettably so. Hailed as the first ever superstar churned out by Bollywood, he made a lasting impression in everybody’s hearts. His career started to slide as soon as it peaked but that didn’t lead to any dearth of fan, especially female, following. The last rites were performed with grandeur, justly deserved by the man who ruled a million hearts.\n\n2. Taruni Sachdeva\n\nTaruni (1998 – 2012) was born in Mumbai and had TV commercials like Rasna to her credit. She also worked with Amitabh & Abhishek Bachchan in the movie Pa. She was on her journey to Muktinath temple in Nepal when the plane they were travelling in crashed, instantly killing the two. The whole film fraternity including Amitabh Bachchan were shocked at this incident and all prayed for her soul to be in peace.\n\n3. Dara Singh\n\nDara Singh (1928-2012) is the most recent addition to this list. He was a professional wrestler and a noted actor. He is most remembered for his role as Hanuman in Ramayana. He passed away on 11 July in Mumbai following a cardiac arrest. He has notable films to his credit and was fondly remembered for his tough physique. He was also a member of Rajya Sabha for 6 years. He was conferred with the title of Rustam-E-Punjab in 1966 and Rustam-E-Hind in 1978.\n\n4. Achla Sachdev\n\nAchla Sachdev was one of the most beloved screen mothers and was a part of the legendary song ‘Ae Meri Zohra Jabeen’. She worked in over 100 films during her long career and also acted in a couple of English movies. Besides movies, she was also a very good at playing the sitar and Bharatnatyam. She was also actively involved in charitable work. She died in 2012 at her residence in Pune.\n\n5. Raj Kanwar\n\nThis noted producer-director Raj Kanwar passed away in Singapore in Feb’12 due to complications arising after his kidney transplant. He made his directorial debut with the blockbuster ‘Deewana’ which also introduced Shah Rukh Khan in Bollywood. He is also credited with introducing Priyanka Chopra and Lara Dutta. His last directorial venture was a movie called ‘Sadiyaan’ which launched Luv Sinha, Shatrughan Sinha’s son, but was a dud at the box office.\n\n6. Dev Anand\n\nThe forever young Dev Saab was an icon of sorts. He kept busy till his last days in London. He suffered a massive cardiac arrest and died in his bed. He was a multi-talented person and was an actor, director, producer all rolled into one. He was lauded for his never-say-die attitude and his vivacious attitude towards life.\n\n7. Jagjit Singh\n\nThe popular ghazal singer passed away due to brain haemorrhage. He was the Ghazal King and was credited with making ghazals popular in mainstream Bollywood.\n\n8. Shammi Kapoor\n\nThis ‘Junglee’ actor died in 2011 due to kidney failure. His last movie was ‘Rockstar’ in which he starred alongside Ranbir Kapoor. He had been unwell for quite some time and was on dialysis. He had several Blockbuster Hindi films to his credit.\n\n9. M.F. Hussain\n\nHussain was the most popular artist and painter to be ever produced by India. Although he was banned from the country due to his controversial paintings portraying Hindu deities in indecent light, he managed to make a name for himself globally. He died of cardiac arrest in London in 2011. Apart from art, he also directed and produced movies like ‘Gaja Gamini’ and ‘Meenaxi’.\n\nWe pray that all of these stars’ soul rests in peace.\n\nYou may also like:\n\nYummy Mummies of Bollywood\n\nMeet Bollywood's Army Brats"
