        "text": "Life’s unfair. Life’s useless.\n\nLife is nothing. Life, a mess.\n\nLife’s like a box of chocolates. Some days are like those rich chocolates which melt in your mouth, and you wish to forever keep it on your tongue, not to gulp it down. Some days are like the nutty ones, one which are dicey… and some are those peanut blended which make you vomit. You never know what you gonna get.\n\nIf today you got a chocolate which tasted bad, you would spit it. Move on. Pick another. If today you got a chocolate which tasted bad, will you stop eating chocolates from tomorrow? No. Then why this injustice to life. You cannot just keep cursing the bad times. You need to move on. If times are bad, you cannot just stop living life.\n\nLife is not as easy as picking chocolates and dropping them. But we do like playing games in higher difficulty levels. The easy ones are boring. Games do give you many lives, but this real world needs to played with one life, see you don’t lose it.\n\n170 words of philosophy. And I would not bore you anymore. Three names to take. Bit of explanation. Conclusion.\n\nZohra Sehgal: Nobody in Bollywood is as young as her. And nobody as naughty as she is at the age of 100. Zohra Sehgal, famous for her enthusiasm turned 100 this April 27. She needs no age miracles. Age is no bar for her. The sprightly actor’s zest for life is still intact. She is an inspiration of living life. Below is how she celebrated her 100th birthday. Yes, the wrinkles, and the white hair are deceptive.\n\nAK Hangal: He takes tentative steps towards a cluster of people, guided purely by his senses, and the oppressive silence that warns him that something is not right here. The gentle timbre of his voice rings through the air heavy with mourning “Itna sannata kyon hain bhai?”\n\nAs the actor came out to act once again for the small screen, yes, to make it big… No longer did the silence remain as everybody greeted him with applause. Never say never. Even at the age of 97, when medicine forms more of a diet than food, once the cameras start rolling, there is no stopping the actor within. Life is all about keeping it going, and AK Hangal guides this theory.\n\nTaruni Sachdev: Where there maybe millions of children around India who hope to see a celebrity in live to boast it in front of friends, this 14 year old worked with Amitabh Bachchan in Paa and also Shahrukh Khan in an episode for small screen. Five years of age when she entered the glamour world, full of fun and childishness, she aspired to become big someday. But it is said, “Destiny’s written. Everything happens according to it” she met with her death on 14th May 2012.\n\nShe was the favourite child on Earth for God. Thus He called her up to celebrate her birthday in the heavens, that was the same day. Thus He called her up so early. She is someone who aspired, but life had cut her aspirations short. She is someone who explains why life is worth.\n\nWhile my heart still feels for Taruni Sachdev and denies to believe what happened, on the other hand my head bows down for Zohra Sehgal and AK Hangal for their unparallel enthusiasm to keep living and keep enjoying. At one end is a life she couldn’t live so long, at the other are two lives, they want to stretch till the very last."
