        "text": "Bollywood child artiste Taruni Sachdev was among the 15 passengers who were killed in a plane crash on Monday.\n\nThe 14-year-old girl was accompanied by her mother Geetha Sachdev who also died in the crash.\n\nTaruni has acted in numerous films, including Amitabh Bachchan's \"Paa\". She has also done several commercials and is well-known for acting in the Rasna advertisement along with actress Karishma Kapoor.\n\nA private Dornier aircraft owned by Agni Air company, which was heading to Jomsom from Pokhara, crashed at 9:45 pm while trying to land at the Jomsom Airport, which is at a very high altitude (8,800 feet).\n\nOf the 15 diseased, 13 were Indians. Six survivors, including three Indians and two Danish tourists and one Nepal air hostess, were rescued from the wreckage site.\n\nThe rescued Indians include Sreekanth, aged between 35-40 years, and two girls - Sreevardhini (9) and Sreepada (6).\n\n\"The injured Indians are undergoing treatment at the Manipal Hospital in Pokhara. The other 13 Indians are feared to be dead,\" the Indian embassy said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, officials of Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International airport have said that the Agni Air Dornier 9N AIG crashed into the ground while trying to ascend.\n\n\"The pilot had reported a warning light flashing in the cockpit as he descended to Jomsom. The aircraft seems to have lost balance,\" the Times of India quoted B L Karna of rescue coordination committee at Tribhuvan airport as saying.\n\nThis is the fifth air crash that has happened in two years in Nepal. In September last year, 19 people who were returning after viewing Mount Everest were killed when their plane crashed due to bad weather near Kathmandu.\n\nList of Indian passengers who were on board the Agni Air plane:\n\nK Mamanya, SK Arora, M Handa, M Arora, R Handa, K Arora, T Sachdev, G Sachdev, Sanaim Sudhar, G Raman, Kidambi Tirumala, Latha Echambade, Sreeva Kidambi Tirumala, Sreepada Kidambi Tirumala, Mr Kumar and Mrs Kumar.\n\n(Information courtesy IBN Live)"
