She was among 13 Indians who were killed when the aircraft crashed into a hill in Jomsom, western Nepal.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan was equally saddened. \"SHOCKED and very saddened to hear about the Nepal plane crash. Lost one of my cutest co-stars. Little Taruni Sachdev from Paa. Speechless,\" he tweeted."
