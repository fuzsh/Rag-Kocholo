Previously MCA (Maharastra Cricket Association) officials demanded to life time ban for Sharukh but MCA President Vilasrao Deshmukh agreed to make it for 5 years after committee's emergency meeting in this context. But final decision will be made by BCCI. MCA also said that Ban can be lifted if Sharukh will apologize …. but Sharukh is not in mood for apology he said why I will apologize they should apologize because they misbehave with me not I …..\n\nWhat Happen Yesterday in Wankhede Stadium ???\n\nGuard Said : After winning the match with Mumbai Indian in Last night's IPL Match Co-owner of Kolkata Night Rider Mr. Shahrukh Khan was in ground with some of his supporters and bodyguards. Some children's were still playing in the ground and he told those childrens that its closing time of the ground without permission of authorized person no one is allowed to stay inside the ground after the match.\n\nSo he said them to go outside of the ground to play, meanwhile Sharukh came and started arguing with him telling who is he to tell them to go out, \"Apne aaukat me Rahe\" Sharuk misbehave him and used some bad words. We can hear some words of Shahrukh in Television footage also which was telecast by different New Channels of India. In this recording we can hear Shahrukh saying \"Tu Janta hai Mai Kaun hu\" , \"Tujh ko mai yahi Gad Dunga\" \"Teri Boss Ko Yaha Bula\" etc…. Security Guard said that Shahrukh was drunk at that moment and abused him with foul language.\n\nBut Shahrukh denied that he was drunked at that time or his behavior was Incorrect. According to Shahrukh that guard misbehaved with childrens including Sharukh's daughter who were playing in side line of the ground along with bat, guard certainly came and pushed them back Shahrukh said guard misbehave with kids. So he just protected the kids and give him an answer. He agreed may be he use some wrong words too.\n\nIf Sharukh is right then we also must think that who will remain cool if somebody misbehave with your kids in front of you, do you remain cool and step a side don’t you react and protect your kids ???\n\nCelebrities are also human and they also love their children being Celebes should Sharukh remain silent tolerating misbehavement with his children in front of him ??? See pictures you can watch some kids in ground too..\n\nIn this case FRI had been launched against Shahrukh in Police Station but further investigation will clarify who is right\n\nIs Nepali going bold ?? Is the bold and sex scenes going to be the success formula for getting the movies hit in box-office ?? One after another movies like Chapali height, Chandrawati, The last Kiss and now A.T.M. has same pattern in which script of the movie is based on bold subject. After the restriction of sensor board for movie \"The last kiss\" for its boldness and intimate scenes, will up-coming Nepali movie A.T.M. get green signal from sensor board because it is said that whole movie has full of Love Making and intimate scenes. We also can know by seeing the poster and promotional matters of Move ATM that what kind of Movie is A.T.M.?
