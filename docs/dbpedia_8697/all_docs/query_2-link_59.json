        "text": "By Pt. Hanumaan Mishra The process of life and death is the rule of nature, but sometimes death targets a particular section in a particular year. Many eminent Bollywood personalities left us this year. Many shining stars of Bollywood left this glittering world. If seen minutely, then not only 2012, 2011 also snatched many Bollywood personalities from us. Mainly 4 planets affected these incidents. These are – Rahu, Ketu, Saturn and Jupiter. Let’s now know one-by-one what role these stars played in taking away our loved Bollywood celebrities from us:\n\nThe name sign of Bollywood is Taurus, which is ruled by planet Venus. As we know that planet Venus has two signs – Taurus and Libra, the fixed house of these signs is second and seventh respectively. Venus is considered as the main planet which affects the matters related to Bollywood. In other words, Venus is the significator of the entertainment and cinema world. Whenever Venus or the sign of Venus get afflicted, cinema world suffers. Let’s now know how 2011 – 2012 was not favorable for Venus or the signs of Venus. In the starting days of June 2011, Ketu entered Taurus sign and Rahu moved to Scorpio. Therefore, matters related to Venus and especially, the days of suffering for Bollywood were started in 2011 only. Let’s now focus on the transit of planets of some Bollywood personalities that left this world in 2011 – 2012. Possibly, at the time of their death, the effect of the transit of Rahu – Ketu, Saturn and Jupiter had connection with eighth, twelfth, ascendant or third house. Here you should know that the eighth house is dedicated to age or death and twelfth is for the expense of body. Ascendant is body itself, whereas considered considerable for age and death due to the third house being eighth from eighth.\n\nLet’s first talk about 2011. Padishah of Ghazal, Jagjit Singh left us in 2011. The day was 10th of October 2011. Jagjit Singh was born on 8th of February 1941. His birth sign is Gemini. At the time of his death, Transit of Ketu was in his twelfth house. The resistor of his Kundali and enemy planet of Venus that is Jupiter was also present in his twelfth house. Twelfth house is considered for the expense of body.\n\nBhupendra Hazarika was born on 8th September, 1926 and his birth sign is Virgo. He bid adieu to this world on 5th November 2011. At that time, he was in effect of Shani Sade Sati. At the time of his expiration, Transit of Ketu as well as Rahu was in third house. Third house is considered for age and death for being eighth from eighth. Jupiter was in eighth house.\n\nMr. Anand who was born on 26th September 1923, left this world on 3rd December 2011. At the time of his birth, Moon was in Pisces. Saturn was in eighth at the time of his death, which means he was in effect of Dhaiyya. Rahu was in ninth, whereas Ketu was in third house.\n\nSurendra Kapoor, father of Anil Kapoor who produced many films like Pukar, Judaai, Hamara Dil Aapke Paas Hai, No Entry and Loafer, died on 24th of September 2011. He was born on 23rd December 1925. His birth sign was Pisces. At the time of his death, Saturn was in eighth, Rahu in ninth; whereas Ketu was in third house.\n\nA respected name of Marathi music world, Sri Niwas Khale Ji left this world on 2nd September 2011. He was born on 30th April 1926. Scorpio was his birth sign. At the time of his death, Rahu was aspecting his ascendant and eighth house from Ketu in seventh and Saturn in eleventh house.\n\nApart from this, Naveen Nishchal Ji left us in 2011. He has played an important role in many movies like Sawan Bhado, The Burning Train, Zeher, Guddu, Aakrosh, Lahu Ke Do Rang, Jung, Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein, Khosla Ka Ghosla and Break Ke Baad.\n\nFamous Sarangi player and classical singer, Ustad Sultan Khan left us in 2011. Indian Film producer, who showcased his talent in Hollywood, also left us on 4th of September 2011. Famous writer Sri Lal Shukla, famous photographer Gautam Rajadhyaksha, director Sameer Chand, Hindi – Marathi movie actress Rashika Joshi, south Indian actress Sujata, Hindi film writer Sachin Bhaumik, actor Ravindra Kapoor (Goga Kapoor), comedy actor Vivek Shauk and Telugu Film director E. V. V. Satyanarayana are some of those names who left us in 2011. This is how the fact is coming out that transit of Rahu – Ketu, Saturn and Jupiter are related to the eighth, twelfth, ascendant or third house in the Kundali of these people. As it was mentioned before that eighth house signifies age and death, twelfth is for the expense of body. Ascendant is body itself whereas third house is considerable for age and death due to being eighth from eighth.\n\nLet’s now talk about the celebrities who left us in 2012:\n\nFirst discussion, Jaspal Bhatti was born on 3rd March 1955 and his birth sign is Gemini. At the time of his expiration that is 25th October 2012, Ketu of transit was in his twelfth house. Resistor of his Kundali and enemy planet of Venus that is Jupiter was also in twelfth house. Twelfth house is considered as the place of body expense.\n\nLet’s now talk about Yash Chopra. He was born on 27th of September 1932 in Scorpio ascendant. At the time of his death that is 21st October 2012, Rahu was in ascendant, Ketu in seventh and Saturn was in twelfth house.\n\nRajesh Khanna was born on 29th December 1942 and it is believed that his ascendant is Gemini. At the time of his death, Ketu was in twelfth house and Rahu aspected by Saturn was placed in sixth house.\n\nPt. Ravi Shankar was born on 7th April 1920 in Scorpio ascendant. On 11th December 2012, at the time of his death, Rahu was in ascendant, Ketu in seventh and Saturn was in twelfth house.\n\nApart from them, Varsha Bhosle, A. K. Hangal, Dara Singh, Mehandi Hasan, Taruni Sachdeva, Achala Sachdeva, Mona Kapoor, Joy Mukherjee, O. P. Dutta, Raj Kunwar, Ashok Mehta, Gawin Pakard and Nikhat Kazmi are those names from Bollywood who left us in 2012. And, we have seen in above examples that somewhere or the other, Rahu – Ketu and Saturn had been the reason behind their death. The main aim behind this discussion is only if this chain of death will stop in 2013. Let’s now know about the positions of only those planets that were responsible for the sad events of last two years. Rahu – Ketu stays in a sign for 18 months. Till 23rd of December 2012, Rahu was posited in Scorpio sign and Ketu in Taurus. Taurus is the sign of Venus and Venus is considered as the significator of Bollywood. Whenever Venus or signs related to Venus get afflicted, cinema world suffers. Taurus and Libra are the signs of Venus. Results of Taurus sign which was afflicted since last 18 months by Rahu – Ketu are in front of you. From now, that is 23rd of December 2012 to next 18 months Rahu will stay in seventh house and Ketu in Aries sign. It means that Libra of Venus will stay afflicted. Hence, this chain will not cease completely. This year might also give certain malefic results to the entertainment world. Especially for the females of entertainment world, this year seems malefic. Apart from this, 2013 might also hurt the people related to social service."
