For those of you who are not familiar with the name, here she is –\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nPopularly known as the ‘Rasna Girl’, Taruni started her acting career at the tender ago of 5, when she starred in the Rasna ads. She has since appeared in over 50 ads, and starred in several movies – the most famous being the Amitabh-starrer ‘Paa’. She has also acted in several regional language movies such as Sathyam and Vellinakshatram in Malayalam, both of which turned her into the darling of the masses in Kerala.\n\nTaruni was on her way to Pokhara in Nepal along with her mother Geetha Sachdev, when the carrier crashed into the Jomsom airport.\n\nSuch a promising star, an adorable girl, all turned to dust and ashes in a matter of a few seconds. Tragedies like these remind us of the transient nature of life – how precious and precarious it is.\n\nMay the Lord give the Sachdev family the strength to bear with the loss of Taruni and her mother Geetha."
