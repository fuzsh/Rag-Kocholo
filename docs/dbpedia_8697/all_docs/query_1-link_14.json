        "text": "Bollywood child actress Taruni Sachdev was one among 15 tragically killed after an airplane carrying Indian and Danish tourists crashed into a hill near an airport in Nepal Monday. Bollywood actors including Amitabh Bachchan and his son Abhiskek have offered their condolences to the family.\n\nSachdev last appeared in the 2009 film 'Paa,' a movie about a child with a rare genetic condition called progeria, with Abhiskek Bachchan. The actor tweeted out his sadness upon hearing the news.\n\nSHOCKED and very saddened to hear about the Nepal plane crash. Lost 1 of my cutest co-stars. Little Taruni Sachdev from PAA. Speechless....., he wrote on his account @juniorbachchan.\n\nAbhiskek's father, who also starred in 'Paa' alongside Sachdev, tweeted Just reading that Taruni Sachdev the girl child artist in 'Paa', has perished in Nepal plane crash. Please God may this not be true. I am so shaken. She was the most bright and beautiful girl.\n\nThe 14-year-old appeared in over 50 commercials, including the Rasna soft drink ads that made her famous, reported BBC. She appeared in two Malayalam films, 'Vellinakshatram' and 'Sathyam' in 2004 and 2008 respectively.\n\nShe was last seen on TV as a participant on Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Kahn's game show Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass Se Tez Hain?' which is based on the popular American quiz show 'Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?\n\nThe Agni Air plane was trying to land at the Jomson airport in northern Nepal when it hit a hillside, killing 15 of the 21 on board, including two pilots. The pilot had originally tried to turn around and fly back to its city of origin, Pokhara, because of strong winds, reported BBC. Six people survived the crash, including a flight attendant, two Danish tourists, and two children.\n\nThe New York Times reported the captain Prabhu Sharan Pathak told the Pokhara airport that the Dornier plan was experiencing technical problems and that he could not land at Jomson because the airport did not have adequate facilities for an emergency landing.\n\nAmitabh, 69 wrote on his Twitter account that Jomson, where the plane crash in Nepal took place is where we shot 'Khuda Gawah', a raw airfield and most difficult to land on, he posted.\n\nSachdev's mother Geetha was also killed in the Nepal plane crash."
