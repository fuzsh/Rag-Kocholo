        "text": "PTI\n\nUpdated On Oct 16, 2013 at 06:30 PM IST\n\nRead by: 100 Industry Professionals\n\nRead by 100 Industry Professionals\n\nKOCHI: Joyalukkas Group proposes to open 54 outlets in India by March 2014, and was targetting a total turnover of Rs 12,000 crore this fiscal, a top company official said today.\n\nAt present, the group has 40 outlets and by the end of this fiscal, the target is to open 14 more outlets, Group Chairman and Managing Director Joy Alukkas told reporters here.\n\nJoyalukkas, which has roped in Bollywood actors Hrithik Roshan and Vidya Balan as its brand ambassadors, will be opening an outlet in Ahmedabad and Vadodara on October 26 and at at Nizamabad in Andhra Pradesh soon. In Tamil Nadu, there will be totally 15 outlets by March next.\n\nThe group's turnover from Jewellery, Money Exchange, Luxury Air Charter, Fashion and silks and Malls, was Rs 10,000 crore last year which it aims to touch Rs 12,000 crore this fiscal.\n\nThere were plans to open an outlet in Malaysia by this year. At present, there are 96 outlets in nine countries, he said.\n\nIn Kerala, the group would be opening 'Mall of Joy' which would have all wedding-related products under one roof in Kochi, Alapuzha, Palakkad, Thrissur, Kottayam, Thiruvananthapuram and one in Dubai.\n\nThere would be no food courts and cinema theatres and would be developed in 100,000-150,000 square feet space, he said. By December-January, the first of the mall would be opened.\n\nLast 3 months due to the slow down, the overall gold business had seen a dip of 35-40 per cent while there had been a 50 per cent growth in gulf, he said.\n\nThe group would be expanding its fleet strength by adding two more long haul aircraft, with a capacity of 8 and 9 passengers, by next month. Built by Brazilian manufacturer Embraer, the group already has a 4 seater plane which can travel 1,000 nautical miles.\n\nJoin the community of 2M+ industry professionals\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.\n\nDownload ETRetail App\n\nGet Realtime updates\n\nSave your favourite articles"
