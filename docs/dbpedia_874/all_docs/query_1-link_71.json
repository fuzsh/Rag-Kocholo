        "text": "The eponymous Joyalukkas Jewellery received the Dubai Service Excellence Scheme (DSES) Award for ‘Best Service Performance Brand’ from the Dubai Department of Economic Development at the Dubai World Trade Center. The Dubai Service Excellence Scheme is an initiative of the Department of Economic Development to promote excellence in customer service standard in the private sector and recognize businesses that provide excellent service for their customers.\n\nThe DSES is designed to gain customer’s confidence and make the experience of ‘Shopping in Dubai’ a pleasurable one. This scheme binds all participating businesses to a common code of business ethics and core criteria for customer service excellence.\n\n“I embarked on my entrepreneurial journey in the UAE with a simple goal: to be the best and world’s favorite jeweler. Thanks to the visionary rulers of UAE and their dynamic nature, I was able to grow ‘Joyalukkas’ brand to be, one of the biggest and best jewelry brands in the world. I sincerely thank Sheikh Mansoor Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum and the DSES for bestowing us with this honor and motivating us to keep at our path of excellence. I also thank our customers and my committed team of employees for their patronage and support in helping us make this happen,” said Joy Alukkas, chairman & MD, Joyalukkas Group.\n\n‘Joyalukkas’ is a brand that has constantly strived on innovation to ensure they offer a delightful shopping experience to customers at all time. Under the vision and business acumen of its founder, Joy Alukkas, the jeweler has launched various initiatives at their many jewelry outlets to enhance the shopping experience of customers, like the intensive training programs for staff and a unique loyalty program for customers. Joyalukkas has been the first jewelry chain to initiate such programs to ensure they offer customers the best at all times. The brand has also retained its super brand status in the UAE for the past 7 years in a row.\n\nSome of the other prestigious awards received by Joy Alukkas, include an award presented by, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, vice president & prime minister of UAE and ruler of Dubai, under the Dubai Quality Awards program for creating and maintaining international standards across all business operations & departments, and another by Sheikha Lubna Bint Khalid Al Qasimi, who presented to them, on behalf of Retail ME the ‘Best Retailer of the Year’, Middle East.\n\nJoy Alukkas is no stranger to accolades, in his 29 years at the helm of, one of the world’s most successful business empire. And it is no wonder his vision and passion for excellence has driven his entrepreneurial journey from a single jewelry showroom in Abu Dhabi to a multibillion empire spanning jewelry, retail, fashion, money exchange, realty and aviation industries in 11 countries. In such a brief span of time, the Joyalukkas brand has become a household name. The Group enjoys the loyal patronage of over 10 million customers in the UAE, India, UK, Singapore, Malaysia, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the USA. — SG"
