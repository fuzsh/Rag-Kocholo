This gives the airline’s Falconflyer (loyalty program) members an opportunity to earn points/miles with every Joyalukkas purchase.\n\nThe launch offer gives them a chance to earn double Falconflyer miles on any purchase from Joyalukkas showrooms in Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Singapore, Malaysia, the UAE, UK and the USA.\n\nJohn Paul Alukkas, group executive director of Joyalukkas, and Ahmed Janahi, chief commercial officer of Gulf Air, recently signed an agreement at a ceremony held at Gulf Air’s Bahrain headquarters.\n\nThe event was attended by top executives from both companies, including Thomas Scaria, head of corporate finance, Joyalukkas, and Kavita S. Al-Jassim, senior manager customer experience, Gulf Air.\n\n“The success of Joyalukkas is largely due to the loyalty and support our customers have given us throughout our 30 years in the industry,” said Alukkas.\n\n“Because of this, we strive to offer them the best value, world-class products and benefits that enhance their lifestyles. This partnership with Gulf Air is aimed at offering them even more rewards and opportunities to simply enjoy life,” he added.\n\nJanahi said: “Our focus is on making Gulf Air’s Falconflyer program as rewarding as possible. In line with this, we are delighted to broaden the Gulf Air FalconFlyer offering and give our loyalty program members access to greater privileges thanks to our partnership with global jewelry retail chain Joyalukkas.”\n\nGulf Air operates one of the largest networks in the Middle East, serving 41 cities in 24 countries spanning three continents. The airline’s Falconflyer program is known for its promotions and partnerships making it one of the most sought-after frequent flyer programs in the world. Special privileges include: online booking bonuses, a generous baggage allowance, three-year validity of miles, unlimited lounge access, priority baggage handling and guaranteed seats."
