        "text": "Joyalukkas Group Chairman & MD, Joy Alukkas was recognised as “Business Innovator” at the NDTV Gulf Indian Excellence Awards 2016, held on December 11, at the Hyatt Regency Dubai Creek Heights.\n\nThe star-studded event was India news broadcasting pioneer NDTV’s first major event in the UAE and will simultaneously be broadcasted over NDTV 24x7 and NDTV Profit.\n\nThe NDTV Gulf Indian Excellence Awards honours outstanding Indian leaders in the Gulf for their contributions across various areas of excellence. This prestigious honour was received by John Paul Alukkas, Executive Director, Joyalukkas Group.\n\n“It is very heartwarming to receive recognition for doing something that I love,” said Joy Alukkas, Chairman & MD, Joyalukkas Group. “I began my journey 29 years ago with the simple aim of offering the best and giving my best in service to customers. The response to all my ventures has been overwhelming, and I cannot be more grateful for the people around me who continue to offer me their support, and the loyal customers who have put their trust in Joyalukkas in the 11 countries we have a presence in. I thank NDTV from the bottom of my heart for this honour, which I share with the over 8,000 employees of the Joyalukkas Group who inspire me to lead them with conviction and determination day after day.”\n\nJoy Alukkas’s vision and foresight has kept Joyalukkas Group on the growth path year after year and 2016 has been a year of achievements and milestones, starting with a seventh consecutive Superbrand status recognition, as well as a Dubai Service Excellence Scheme (DSES) Award win for outstanding customer service from the Dubai Department of Economic Development.\n\nThe founder and the Group, however, is far from resting on the laurels, the Group has recently ventured into USA by two Joyalukkas jewellery showrooms within the last two months.\n\nJoy Alukkas’s leadership has seen the Group grow from a single jewellery showroom in Abu Dhabi into a multi-billion conglomerate spanning the jewellery retail, fashion, money exchange, realty and aviation industries in 11 countries. In such a brief span of time, the Joyalukkas brand has been dubbed become a household name enjoying the loyal patronage of over 10 million customers in the UAE, India, UK, Singapore, Malaysia, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the USA."
