As a result, the lab-grown diamond industry, valued at $19.3 billion in 2020, is expected to grow to nearly $50 billion by 2030, according to Allied Market Research. While the industry currently produces nearly equal numbers of CVD and HPHT diamonds today, the CVD method will become the preferred method of diamond growth in the next decade as it is less costly and more energy-efficient than HPHT, which requires larger equipment and higher temperatures and pressures. As the public receives more education on lab-grown diamonds, the method by which a diamond is grown may become a factor in a consumer’s decision-making process.

How did a company 50% the size of Under Armour, 25% the size of Puma and 5% of Nike come up with something new and seemingly better than larger and more established competition? How does a risk mindset of a challenger brand stimulate innovation? What roles does company culture have in being open to innovation? How does \"accepting risk\" growth innovation opportunites? I don't have the answers for all these but have to say this innovation has me thinking differently about the brand. Having the idea is easy. Executing and making it real is hard. I respect On taking the risk. https://lnkd.in/gQM8CQBn --- I’m the owner of The Directive Collective footwear design consultancy.
