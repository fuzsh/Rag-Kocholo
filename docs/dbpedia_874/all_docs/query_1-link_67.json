In Tamil Nadu, there will be totally 15 outlets by March next.\n\nThe group's turnover from Jewellery, Money Exchange, Luxury Air Charter, Fashion and silks and Malls, was Rs 10,000 crore last year which it aims to touch Rs 12,000 crore this fiscal.\n\nThere were plans to open an outlet in Malaysia by this year. At present, there are 96 outlets in nine countries, he said.\n\nIn Kerala, the group would be opening 'Mall of Joy' which would have all wedding-related products under one roof in Kochi, Alapuzha, Palakkad, Thrissur, Kottayam, Thiruvananthapuram and one in Dubai.\n\nThere would be no food courts and cinema theatres and would be developed in 100,000-150,000 square feet space, he said. By December-January, the first of the mall would be opened.\n\nLast 3 months due to the slow down, the overall gold business had seen a dip of 35-40 per cent while there had been a 50 per cent growth in gulf, he said.\n\nThe group would be expanding its fleet strength by adding two more long haul aircraft, with a capacity of 8 and 9 passengers, by next month. Built by Brazilian manufacturer Embraer, the group already has a 4 seater plane which can travel 1,000 nautical miles."
