        "text": "Southport, CT – Rick Petrone and the WPKN All-Star Jazz Band will perform on Sunday, February 28, 2016, from 4:00pm - 6:00pm, in Pequot Library’s acoustically renowned Concert Hall. The afternoon of talented musicians, entrancing jazz and special guests is a joint fundraiser for two local community minded non-profits, Pequot Library and WPKN 89.5 FM. Tickets are $25 in advance online at www.pequotlibrary.org or $30 at the door.\n\nThis joint fundraiser helps support music programs at Pequot Library and WPKN 89.5 FM. Pequot Library’s Executive Director Heather-Marie Montilla says, “We are delighted to build upon our past relationship with WPKN and cross pollinate our audiences.”\n\nRick Petrone is a bassist who has been active in jazz since the 1960s. Born in Stamford, CT, he lived in L.A. as a child but has spent most of his life on the East Coast. After graduating from Boston's prestigious Berklee College of Music in 1969 with a degree in music education, Petrone played with Buddy Rich and went on to play with Marian McPartland in 1970-71, Maynard Ferguson from 1972-74, the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis band in 1975 and Chet Baker in 1976. Around the mid-1970s, Petrone was a member of New York Mary, an obscure fusion band that included Joe Corsello and Bruce Johnstone and recorded two albums for Arista Freedom: New York Mary and A Piece of the Apple. Petrone ran WJAZ a 24-hour FM jazz station in Stamford and currently hosts a weekly radio jazz show, ‘The Jazz Sound’ on WPKN 89.5-FM.\n\nJoe Corsello (drummer) is praised by audiences, peers, and critics alike. He did classical studies at the New England Conservatory and studied jazz at Berklee College of Music with Joe Hunt and Alan Dawson. Equally at home in the studio, club concert, or clinic setting, Joe has toured extensively with such jazz legends as Benny Goodman, Peggy Lee, Marian McPartland, Gerry Mulligan, Zoot Sims, Gene Bertoncini, John Scofield and has performed with Chris Brubeck, Joe Beck and Ali Ryerson, Mark Morganelli and the Jazz Forum All Stars, Don Freidman, Houston Person and Etta Jones, Richie Cole, Roberta Gambarini, Roy Hargrove, and Larry Willis. He co-founded the group New York Mary, which traveled throughout the country and recorded for Arista Records.\n\nDave Childs (piano) is originally from Indianapolis, Indiana and has been working as a pianist for 30 years. Childs attended Berklee College of Music in Boston and has been fortunate to study under such jazz luminaries as Steve Allee, James Williams, and Donald Brown. Childs performs full time in the tri-state region and has shared the stage with jazz greats Jimmy Heath, Eddie Bert, James Moody, Lionel Hampton, Larry Rodley, Roswell Rudd, Dick Oatts, Bill Watrous, and the Nelson Riddle Orchestra. Chris Stelluti (sax & flute) is a local musician who has played with many of the area’s best. A music graduate of the University of Bridgeport, Stelluti also teaches music in workshops and clinics.\n\nGeneral Manager of WPKN 89.5-FM Steve di Costanzo says, “Rick Petrone will be playing a lot of great traditional jazz standards and we expect special guests including 2 additional sax players, a major vocalist and a few other surprises!”\n\nDon’t miss out on this fantastic afternoon of jazz, all for a good cause.
