        "text": "Binnie Klein on the Radio\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMy music and interview show, A Miniature World, airs on the first and third Thursdays, from 10 AM until Noon on WPKN, 89.5FM and www.wpkn.org. WPKN has an iTunes app, and shows are archived for two weeks after they air. I’ve been connected with WPKN since 1976.\n\nMy musical tastes swerve through Euro-pop, trip-hop, electronica, indie-rock, singer-songwriters. You might hear Icelandic rock, World music, Radiohead, Bjork, Tricky, Kate Bush, Cocteau Twins, The Books, Devotchka, weird cover tunes, Milosh, Stevie Nicks, PJ Harvey, Cat Power, Owen Pallett, Hot Chip, Dandy Warhols, Sarah Fimm, Karsh Kale, La Nouvelle Vague, Moby, Patti Smith, Juana Molina, and Peter Gabriel, to name a few.\n\nI regularly feature poets reading their own works and my interviews have included Jeff Pevar, Dani Shapiro, Ophira Eisenberg, Annabelle Gurwitch, Tig Notaro, Dick Cavett, David Denby, Harry Shearer, Katha Pollitt, Bert Randolph Sugar, Sara Barron, Louise DeSalvo, Gretchen Rubin, Walter Kirn, Daniel Menaker, Susan Orlean, and many more!\n\n​"
