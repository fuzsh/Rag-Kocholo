        "text": "This pre-Franorama World post is from my MySpace blog Dec. 1, 2009, 11:45 p.m. EST:\n\nWhile I was home this time, I got to do two fill-in shows at WPKN (89.5 FM, wpkn.org), the community radio station in Bridgeport that’s near and dear to my heart. One of the reasons I’d come back to Connecticut if I had a job — family and friends and proximity to NYC aside — is that the station is in some serious financial trouble, and I’d love to help find a way to rescue it before it’s too late. (What’s the Megamillions jackpot up to? Or Powerball?)\n\nAnyway, I lost the playlist from my Sunday morning (11/22) Franorama fill-in, but here’s the playlist from my Black Friday show (11/27), 11:30 p.m.-3 a.m. EST (8:30-midnight PST).\n\nIn addition to calls from friends and longtime listeners — plus a couple of asshole crank calls — I had something cool happen, thanks to the power of the Web in general, and eBay and email in particular.\n\nEarly on in the show, I got a call from a woman I know, Dana, who lives near San Diego. Flash back to February of last year. I sold a bunch of my old rock T-shirts from the ’80s and ’90s on eBay. One shirt was of a damn good Long Island garage-pop band called The Mosquitos, fronted by a great guitarist/songwriter named Vance Brescia. The title tune of their 1985 EP, “That Was Then, This Is Now,” was chosen by The Monkees as their reunion single in ’86 (and became their last top-20 hit).\n\nAnyway, I was selling off my Mosquitos shirt, which I outgrew in the late ’80s; it was still in very good shape. So this woman emailed me during the auction and asked what someone in central California was doing with a shirt from an obscure New York band. I explained to her that I was from New Haven and I saw them at Irving Plaza in ’85. It was the aforementioned Dana. She told me she was friends with Vance, who’s now the musical director for Peter Noone/Herman’s Hermits. She was helping him try to promote his music.\n\nShe bought the shirt to give him for his birthday that July. However, in April I got an email from her. She couldn’t wait till his birthday — she sent me a jpg of a grinning Vance holding up my old T-shirt of his old band, now his shirt. It was a how-cool-is-that moment. In June, Herman’s Hermits kicked off the 2008 summer concert series on the beach in Santa Cruz; I took the ride out, made a weekend of it, and met up with Dana. We eventually went over before the show to see Vance — who, like me, was wearing a groovy paisley shirt. (He also dug my Fleshtones T-shirt.) We didn’t get to talk for long — he was jetlagged after a flight from England on a zigzag tour apparently booked by Spinal Tap’s agent — but it was cool. We’ve emailed back and forth a couple times since.\n\nSo Dana called me during my show Friday night; Vance had forwarded my mass email about my show to her. She told me Vance was starting to release some of his recordings through the years on CD. She also told me she’d email me an mp3 of a Christmas song. He recorded “Christmas Dream” back in ’89 and it’s just seeing the light if day now. So she sent the email, I downloaded the song to iTunes on the station’s on-air Mac, and voila! The listeners got to hear a song I didn’t even know existed until I was on the air. A fun time, as my shows usually are.\n\nSo anyway, here’s the playlist:\n\nAmerican Beat ’84 (my national anthem) — The Fleshtones\n\nNothing for Christmas — The Reducers\n\nHong Kong Garden — Siouxsie & the Banshees\n\nI Want an Alien for Christmas — Fountains of Wayne\n\nEcstasy — The Raspberries\n\nChristmas Bop — Marc Bolan\n\nCaptain Lou (live at the Windsor Court Hotel, Windsor Locks, 4/19/92) — NRBQ\n\nElectric Train — NRBQ\n\nThe Deep End — Christine Ohlman & Rebel Montez (w/Al Anderson)\n\nRockin’ Around the Christmas Tree — Dion\n\nI’m in Love With a Girl — Big Star\n\nUnemployable — 8-Inch Betsy\n\nSanta’s Gonna Shut ‘Em Down — The Untamed Youth\n\nThe Man With the Bag — Kay Starr\n\nKomm, Gib Mir Deine Hand — Das Beatles\n\nJoy to the World — The Butties\n\nSweet Sweet Baby — The Honeybees\n\nPapa Noel — Brenda Lee\n\nKeeping Time — Jenny Dee & the Deelinquents\n\nThe Dum Dum Ditty — The Shangri-Las\n\nFrosty the Snowman — The Ronettes\n\nTears Dry on Their Own — Amy Winehouse\n\nSleigh Ride — The Ronettes\n\nStop and Think It Over — Sarah Borges & the Broken Singles\n\nCome Go With Me — Gloria Jones\n\nHe’s a Doll — The Honeys\n\nJust Got Lucky — JoBoxers\n\nThe Bird on My Head — David Seville\n\nThe Creature With the Atom Brain — Roky Erickson\n\nPsychotic Reaction — Brenton Wood\n\nThe Bells of St. Mary — Bob B.
