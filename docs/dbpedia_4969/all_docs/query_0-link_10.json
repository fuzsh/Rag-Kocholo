Programs on WPKN include live and recorded music, news, public affairs, and spoken word. WPKN’s volunteer programmers present a wide variety of music and alternative information, in an eclectic mix of free-form programming that seeks to serve those whose needs are not met by mainstream media in a unique and vibrant way. WPKN’s programming mix is a cornucopia of genres and styles. From the obscure to the recognizable, it is presented by informed programmers who help listeners discover and rediscover the best in live and recorded performance. Some of our self-produced talk/news oriented shows, such as Between the Lines, are nationally recognized. WPKN is proud of its bold independence and its fearlessness to program without any strings attached. Generations of our dedicated and loyal audience have defined us as the real alternative to an increasingly homogeneous and limited choice in broadcast radio.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.wpkn.org\n\nExternal link for WPKN Community Radio\n\nIndustry\n\nBroadcast Media Production and Distribution\n\nCompany size\n\n51-200 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nBridgeport, CT\n\nType\n\nNonprofit\n\nFounded\n\n1963\n\nSpecialties\n\nMusic, Public Affairs, and Live broadcasts"
