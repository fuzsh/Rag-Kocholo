        "text": "Free radio used to be a more common thing than it is now. However, very few radio stations run entirely by volunteers still exist. One of the remaining ones, often coined as being the \"Kings of Free Radio\" is WPKN/WPKM in Bridgeport, CT/Montauk respectively.\n\nI used to do a lot of DJ work at this station, and still do so from time to time when I want to escape NYC for a couple of days. The music on WPKN is totally unrestricted - there is no \"playlist\" or \"demographic\" appeal. These guys are run entirely from volunteers and listener donations! I, as a member of the WPKN production team, invite EVERYBODY with a questing spirit to check out WPKN's incredible assortment of randomness. I am not lying when I say this: EVERY FORM OF MUSIC YOU CAN IMAGINE IS PLAYED ON THIS STATION!\n\nSo it's not just the same 1200 classic rock songs on loop, or those tired, boring oldies hits, or the corporation-constructed contemporary pop/rock songs. But don't think it's a station for the experiment/avant-garde either - lots of simple music is played too. I once heard a DJ play a bluegrass tune, followed by an Iranian modern classical performance, followed by Aphex Twin. The possibilies are truly endless.\n\nWe're all music fans here, so I highly suggest visiting their website at www.wpkn.org and also checking out the following link to view their online radio stream:\n\nhttp://wpkn.org/ontheair.html\n\nNotice that this is the exact same thing going out to every listener's radio tuners at that very moment! This place is a true treasure trove of music and I just wanted to share it with you all.\n\nI love this station, especially their Thursday blues night with Bob Shapiro. I've been listening for over 20 years. And Monday mornings Victor Pachera has a wonderful old jazz show, which is responsible for my interest in 1920's and '30's jazz. It started when I was on my way to the movies on a day off, was channel surfing, and heard the most unusual song. It took me weeks to track down what it was: The Luis Russell Orchestra with Henry \"Red\" Allen on trumpet doing \"The Call of the Freaks.\" My only complaint about WPKN is their never-ending pledge drives. Necessary, but obnoxious.\n\nAmen to community-run radio! I've been doing community radio for 19+ years, and I'm currently at KFAI-FM/Minneapolis. (www.kfai.org) The music programs are hosted by music fanatics, which is exactly what you want. I like to say that we all have a bit of obsessive/compulsive disorder when it comes to our individual genres - not so good in real life, but GREAT when hosting a radio show.\n\nThere are a handful of terrific community stations from coast-to-coast, and you should actively check them out if you're lucky enough to have one wherever you live.\n\n- -\n\n\"Crap From The Past\" airs on 8 station in three countries, all on community-run radio stations. We're a graduate-level course in pop music."
