        "text": "The Westport Library’s children’s section bursts with great materials.\n\nNow it’s even fuller. They’ve added 379 new books and audiobooks to their digital collection.\n\nAmong the authors: Kwame Alexander, Dhonielle Clayton, Beverly Cleary, Suzanne Collins, Kate DiCamillo, Sarah J. Maas, Rick Riordan, Lemony Snicket, Jasmine Warga and Laura Ingalls Wilder.\n\nOh yeah: Westport’s own Tommy Greenwald is in there too.\n\n=================================================\n\nWPKN-FM (89.5 in Bridgeport) — called by the New Yorker “the greatest radio station in the world” — will air the complete original recording of the 1969 Woodstock festival next month.\n\nNot the double album released as the “Woodstock” movie soundtrack.\n\nNot some outtakes, added later.\n\nThe entire concert. Complete musical performances by every band — all 32 sets, from Richie Havens, Joan Baez, the Who, Sly & the Family Stone, Johnny Winter, Ten Years After, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Santana, Joe Cocker, Canned Heat, The Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, The Band, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Jimi Hendrix and more.\n\nEvery stage announcement. The entire 4-day affair, 55 years after it happened.\n\nThe show runs August 15-18, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily.\n\nWhat makes this “06880”-worthy is the Jim Motavalli connection. WPKN’s publicity director — a 1970 Staples High School graduate — was at Woodstock.\n\nHe drove to Max Yasgur’s farm with his twin brother John (also a longtime WPKN DJ) in their first car, a 1962 Chevy Nova convertible.\n\nJim Motavalli recalls: “I had a wonderful time. I was 17. People always ask me about the music, but a big part of what made it special was the tribal gathering, Woodstock Nation if you will. Just being there was exciting, though the music wasn’t half bad.”\n\n==================================================\n\nThe Westport Artists Collective’s opening reception at the Ethan Allen Design Center was packed, earlier this month.\n\nThere should be a great crowd too, at the closing party (August 1, 5 to 7 p.m., Fresh Market shopping plaza opposite Mitchells).\n\nTen members’ works are displayed through several room settings, on the walls and easels. The public is invited.\n\n============================================\n\nSet your alarm. (Or program your device.)\n\n“Loving” — the 1970 film about a successful illustrator, his mistress and alcohol — will air on TCM this Friday (July 26), at 12:15 a.m.\n\nIt’s of interested to “06880” readers for 3 reasons. The film was based on “Brooks Wilson Ltd.,” a novel by Westporter John McDermott.\n\nIt was filmed in part here, at the Saugatuck train station, Greens Farms Elementary School, Main Street, and a private home on 27 Long Lots Road.\n\nAnd it starred George Segal and Eva Marie Saint (a Westport Country Playhouse regular). Local residents Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward appeared as extras. Westporter Diana Douglas also had a role.\n\n=================================================\n\nWestport resident Peggy Lovro — a native of China, and a Mandarin teacher at Brien McMahon High School’s Center for Global Studies in Norwalk — was the guest speaker at the Westport Rotary Club’s Tuesday meeting.\n\nShe discussed the benefits of international study tour programs for cross-cultural learning. CGS — a magnet school focused on languages — attracts students from throughout Fairfield County.\n\nPeggy Lovro\n\n==============================================\n\nThis may not be where you and I — or even many birds — would perch.\n\nBut there’s no place like home, for these Cockenoe Island residents.\n\nCarl McNair snapped today’s “Westport … Naturally” image.\n\n(Photo/Carl McNair)\n\n==================================================\n\nAnd finally … Abdul “Duke” Fakir, the last surviving member of the legendary Four Tops, died Monday in Detroit. He was 88, and suffered from heart failure.\n\nThe group — founded in the 1950s and active through the 2000s — achieved its greatest fame with a string of ’60s Motown hits. Fakir’s tenor blended well with lead singer Levi Stubbs’ baritone.\n\nThere are way too many great Four Tops songs to include here. These are just some of my favorites. (Click here for a full obituary.)\n\n(I can’t help myself: I’ve got to ask readers to click here to support “06880.” Thank you, sugar pie honey bunch.)\n\nLynn Flint wrote yesterday: “The ground ozone count for today in Westport is 122 (way high).\n\n“Anything above 70 is considered USG (unhealthy for sensitive groups). Normal is around 10.\n\n“The same high count is forecast for Friday.\n\n“This condition is invisible, not like forest fire smoke. I’ve noticed it the last few days whenever I was outside my eyes started to burn, my vision became blurry, and I started to cough vigorously.”\n\nBe careful out there!\n\n=================================================\n\nA reader writes: “Students graduating during the COVID lockdown in 2020 were denied graduation ceremonies, and the accompanying fanfare and celebrations.\n\n“To create alternative markers of these students’ accomplishments, schools produced and distributed lawn signs for each graduate’s family to display.\n\n“Now, 4 years later, I see lawn signs for Staples, Bedford, even Goddard School graduates. Why?\n\n“Can we please stop, for the sake of our landfills? Graduates are able once again to celebrate and be celebrated.\n\n“So let’s end the practice of producing plastic signs that do not get recycled. biodegrade or do anything useful.”\n\n==================================================\n\nA celebration of Leonard Everett Fisher’s life is set for this coming Monday (June 24, 3 to 6 p.m., Westport Library).\n\nThe date is special. It would have been the noted illustrator/artist, longtime civic volunteer and proud World War II veteran’s 100th birthday.\n\nDonations in his and his wife’s name can be made to “Margery & Leonard Everett Fisher Endowment for Children’s Books in the Arts,” c/o Westport Library, 20 Jesup Road, Westport, CT 06880.\n\nLeonard Everett Fisher (Photo/Ted Horowitz)\n\n=================================================\n\nOnly 2 athletic facilities in Westport — Paul Lane Field at Staples High School, and PJ Roman Field behind Saugatuck Elementary — have lights.\n\nThat may change.\n\nNow that a 10-year agreement with Staples neighbors has expired — and with more demands on fields than ever, due to the growth of sports like rugby and girls lacrosse — discussions are beginning about lighting more places.\n\nThe Planning & Zoning Commission Recreation Subcommittee meets next Thursday (June 27, noon, Zoom; click here for the town website livestream).\n\nThe agenda includes:\n\nReview of participant feedback on athletic field lighting for properties (seen here).\n\nDiscussion of temporary vs. permanent lighting, and times of the day.\n\nDiscussion of the next steps in implementing athletic field lighting.\n\nPaul Lane Field (lower right) is Staples’ only lighted athletic facility. the baseball diamond, and adjacent Albie Loeffler Field and Jinny Park Field are not. (Photo/Dan Woog)\n\n==================================================\n\nBook the date!\n\nTickets for Billie Jean King’s appearance at the 25th annual “Booked for the Evening” — the Westport Library’s signature fundraiser (September 12) — go on sale Monday, July 15, at 10 am.\n\n“Bookmark” this page to order yours.\n\n==============================================\n\nWhat’s “low income” in Fairfield County?\n\nA household income of $100,000 for a family of 4.\n\nA study by MarketWatch Guides examined date from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nIn much of the rest of the country, low income is closer to $50,000 or less, says Claudia Phillips of MarketWatch.\n\nClick here for the full story, in CT Mirror.\n\nNot a lot of money.\n\n==================================================\n\nSummer arrived yesterday.\n\nAnd so — right on cue — did the Good Humor woman.\n\nThere are other ice cream trucks around. But for generations of Westporters, this is the only one that counts.\n\nBonus points if you remember Ray.\n\n(Photo/Karen Weingarten)\n\n==================================================\n\nWestport Garden Club members were out in force recently, at Grace Salmon Park.\n\nThey’ve been planting, trimming, weeding and overseeing the gardens and new sundial.\n\nIt takes a village. The Westport Garden Club makes sure ours always looks gorgeous.\n\nWestport Garden Club members (from left): Joanne Heller, Kelly Frey Pollard, Nathalie Fonteyne, Orna Stern and Joellen Bradford.\n\n=======================================================\n\nThe “dog days” of summer are in August.\n\nBut tomorrow o(Saturday, June 22, 10:30 a.m. to noon, Jesup Green), the Westport Book Shop is hosting “Doggy Days of Summer.”\n\nThere’s a reading by Denis O’Neill, dog-themed art, games, and a chance to meet Woofgang & Co.\n\nExcited for the “Doggy Days of Summer.” (Photo/Lou Weinberg)\n\n==================================================\n\nSpeaking of summer: It was the solstice — and a full moon last night.\n\nDalma Heyn captured the scene, at Old Mill Beach:\n\n(Photo/Dalma Heyn)\n\n=================================================\n\nCongratulations to Katie Augustyn. The longtime Westporter is the Sunrise Rotary Club’s new president for 2024-25. She was inducted Wednesday.\n\nKatie Augustyn (center), at her Sunrise Rotary presidency induction. Looking on are the 2023-24 president Liz Wong, and Robert Friend, Rotary district governor.\n\n==================================================\n\nBrendan Toller has a new job too.\n\nThe former marketing manager of the Westport Library’s Verso Studios — who is also a film director and musician — has been named director of operations and new initiatives at WPKN, Bridgeport’s free-form, listener-supported FM radio station.\n\nAt Verso Studios, Toller helped develop the mission, partnerships, and programming and marketing efforts.\n\nBrendan Toller (Photo/Michael Civitello)\n\n================================================\n\nJianmei “Jamie” Zheng died June 14 at Yale-New Haven Hospital, with her family by her side, after a battle with lymphoma. She was 61.\n\nShe was born in China. After she and Ping Zhou married in 1986, Jamie earned a master’s degree in computer science from the Illinois Institute of Technology.\n\nThey and their 2 children eventually settled in Westport, where they lived for the past 18 years.\n\nJamie was a lifelong enthusiast of music and the arts.

The previous one, which hung in front of the building, was destroyed by winter storms.\n\nBut that’s not all.\n\nAfter helping out with the church service, Troop 36 members cleaned up the outdoor chapel, adjacent to Winslow Park. It was a troop Eagle project years ago.\n\nScouts cleared the nearby path, removed trash and debris, replenished mulch and fixed the border.
