Making its debut in the fall of 2022 on Governor’s Island, NYC the goal is to have Thoughts & Prayers tour the country, installed in various civic spaces, to help incite better conversations about our collective relationship to weapons and violence in the United States.\n\nA large, cruciform structure was built by Roleke who painstakingly threaded, then wrapped dozens of used shotgun shells around the armature, to create a colorful, texturally rich take on the Christian cross. The prayer flags were made by Lewis, using crowd-sourced tee shirts handcut and stenciled with her custom messages. Every flag contains human DNA, signs of wear and a past as the covering on a human torso. They act as fluttering surrogates, protesting and bearing witness to each weaponized incident.\n\n#d Carlos Biernnay, Fiber Art Installation\n\nView a site-specific fiber art installation of absurd and mythical imagery of hand painted, dyed, felted and quilted forms.

His artistic strengths became apparent early in his youth and educators were quick to encourage and support him in that area of his development. After a tour of Vietnam, he obtained a BFA from The School of Visual in New York City, worked in the New York City commercial art world and taught art in the city as a certified teacher. All throughout, Larry pursued his personal vision, artistically, and amassed a sizable body of work. Larry is now at a point in life when over the last 10 years he has promoted and endeavored to share and sell his art with and to others. Notable venues have been galleries in Chelsea, Good News Cafe, Mark Twain Library, Richter Gallery, Gallery 287 in Danbury, City Lights gallery and others. His work has been collected by patrons and corporations in the NY-CT region.\n\n#h Scott Schuldt: View from the Canoe Installation\n\nArtists Scott Schuldt never disappoints, presenting his stunning works inspired by his passion for canoeing, and his concern and study of environmental conditions and fascinating choices of materials. From hand hewned paddles to schematic renderings about the condition of marine life and waterways, his canoe themed installation demonstrates how he thinks, creates and sees the world, as an artist, engineer and lover of nature. He melds his unique art practice and choices of materials, such as embroidery bead work, found object constructions with the skills from his training and years of experience as an engineer and his countless hours exploring nature and canoeing. Watch Scott as he demonstrate time consuming hand sewn bead embroidery for “The Talking Squirrel” 38” x 55” a work in progress, at 22 months progress.\n\ncanoepost.blogspot.com\n\nnotesfromsmokefarm.blogspot.com\n\n#i City Lights/Bridgeport Art Trail Sampler\n\nSee an eclectic collection of art representing the artists of City Lights # and Bridgeport Art Trail.\n\n#8 on Art Trail program\n\nBarnum loved nothing more than joining entertainment and education, and he conceived of the Barnum Institute of Science and History (as it was originally known) as a lasting legacy, a celebration of American cultural and scientific achievement.\n\nBarnum was devoted to the museum project, giving his own land, funds, collections and expertise to ensure its success; but he did not live to see it completed, approving plans for the building’s construction only three weeks before his death on April 7, 1891. Costing some $85,000 to construct, the building opened on February 18, 1893 and has been part of downtown Bridgeport ever since.\n\nThe Barnum Museum is the leading authority on P.T. Barnum’s life and work, and contains more than 60,000 artifacts relating to Barnum, Bridgeport and 19th century America. We are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Led by executive director Kathleen Maher – a museum veteran and an industry expert in arts administration, historic preservation and cultural heritage – the Museum remains committed to Barnum’s own mission: growing curiosity, creativity and confidence through instructive entertainment.\n\nAuthors, journalists, filmmakers, researchers, museums and attractions look to the Museum for its expertise and enthusiasm about all things Barnum, and the Museum is regularly featured in outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post, the History Channel, BBC, NPR, Atlas Obscura, TED and more. The Museum eagerly partners with other cultural institutions to bring P.T. Barnum’s life and legacy to a broader audience.\n\nThe Museum stands as a great American national treasure and a unique physical testament to P.T. Barnum’s life. In cooperation with its community, fans, donors and the creative wizards at transformational agency BRC Imagination Arts, the Barnum Museum looks ahead to a re-envisioned future as a true 21st century museum and a fitting tribute to its founder.\n\nP.T. Barnum was an energetic, optimistic entrepreneur who changed the world of entertainment forever. Barnum’s final museum is a permanent “open house” where a world of visitors can get to know Barnum, be inspired by his story and feel the happiness he worked so hard to share."
