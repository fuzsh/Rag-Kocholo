        "text": "For the first time in nearly a decade, the New York-based international award winning modern dance company Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company will perform in Fairfield County at The Quick Center for the Arts at Fairfield University on Saturday, February 25. This performance has been selected as part of February’s ‘Black History Month’ and is a benefit for nonprofit, community radio WPKN (89.5-FM, Bridgeport). All ticket purchases will also support Bridgeport students from the FAME after-school program to have access to this performance.\n\nThe Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company was founded in 1982 out of an 11-year collaboration between Bill T. Jones and Arnie Zane (1948–1988). They redefined the duet form and foreshadowed issues of identity, form and social commentary that would change the face of American dance. The Company has performed worldwide in over 200 cities in 40 countries on every major continent and is recognized as one of the most innovative and powerful forces in the dance-theater world.\n\nThe company is reviving two works from their repertory for this special occasion: Continuous Replay reflects Arnie Zane's interests in photography and film. Originally choreographed by Zane in 1977 as a solo titled Hand Dance and later revised as a group work by Bill T. Jones in 1991, Continuous Replay is based on 45 precise gestures accumulated in space and time, cunningly complicated by discrete movement events. Music has been made, mixed and re-mixed by John Oswald.\n\nThe second piece Story/ is the result of the company's continued investigation in using John Cage's Indeterminacy as a choreographic tool. follows the model for the acclaimed Story/Time, the work employs a random menu of movement that is accompanied by Franz Schubert's String Quartet No. 14 (Death and the Maiden) to craft a conversation between the music and the movement.\n\nDance performance tickets are $50. A pre-event VIP Reception & Performance ticket is $100. Other options include $150 for Two VIP Reception & Performance tickets. $500 for Six VIP Reception & Performance Tickets. VIP Reception in the lobby at 6pm. Performance 7:30 p.m. Tickets are available in person at the Quick Center Box Office, by phone at 203-254-4010 or by clicking here.\n\nAbout WPKN 89.5 Community Radio\n\nFounded in 1963, WPKN is a 10,000-watt listener-supported community radio station broadcasting at 89.5 FM and streaming online at WPKN.org.
