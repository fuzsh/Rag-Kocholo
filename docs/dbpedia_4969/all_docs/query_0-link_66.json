        "text": "Steve di Costanzo, the longtime general manager at Bridgeport’s WPKN-FM, announced that he will be retiring.\n\n“I turn 65 early next year,” di Costanzo said in a statement published on social media. “I’m comfortable with my achievements in various careers. I am particularly happy to have served 12 years as GM and 4 years as a board member of our amazing radio station.”\n\n“WPKN is at an inflection point like much of our society,” he added. “It’s time for me and my generation to move aside, pass the baton and allow for the next generation energy. I’m totally comfortable with that.”\n\nThe radio station is now searching for a replacement and di Costanzo stated his final day at the helm will be Dec. 15.\n\n“So this is not a goodbye yet,” he said. “There’s still plenty to do before I punch out.”\n\nPhoto of di Costanzo at the 2021 opening of WPKN’s Bijou Square studios, courtesy of his Facebook page\n\nPhil Hall\n\nPhil Hall's writing for Westfair Communications has earned multiple awards from the Connecticut Press Club and the Connecticut Society of Professional Journalists.
