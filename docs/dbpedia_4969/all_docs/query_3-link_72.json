        "text": "Verso Studios at The Westport Library presents a screening of the 2022 documentary, The Greatest Radio Station in the World, in the Trefz Forum.\n\nThis film tells the 60-year history of WPKN radio, 89.5 FM, launched in Bridgeport in 1962, and still going strong. The station broadcasts to 1.5 million people in Connecticut, Long Island, and parts of New York and Massachusetts. Operating 24/7 and largely run by volunteers, WPKN offers a unique and eclectic mix of live and recorded music, news, public affairs, spoken word, arts & culture, and other free-form programming which defy genre.\n\nIn case you missed the event, you may watch the recorded program here.\n\nThe filmmaker, Cob Carlson, will do a short intro prior to the screening. The title for the film came from a 2021 New Yorker magazine article entitled \"On Air with the Greatest Radio Station in the World,\" which described how \"you can hear a Stevie Wonder song performed by an all-women jazz septet or twenty minutes of Tuvan throat singing.\""
