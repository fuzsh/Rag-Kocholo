        "text": "Bridgeport is receiving supporting arts grants for several local organizations. These organizations are:\n\nCity Lights & Company\n\nClementina Arts Foundation, Inc.\n\nDowntown Cabaret Theatre Company of Bridgeport\n\nGreater Bridgeport Symphony Society\n\nKids Empowered by Your Support, Inc.\n\nKlein Memorial Auditorium Foundation, Inc.\n\nMetro Arts Studio, Inc.\n\nNeighborhood Studios of Fairfield County\n\nWPKN, Inc\n\nThe Supporting Arts Grant program from the Department of Economic Development provides general operating support to help Connecticutâ€™s arts organizations and municipal arts departments cover programmatic costs associated with their mission-related work. This type of grant is flexible and gives the grantee the ability to use the funds where they are most needed.\n\nThis will help our diverse and vibrant art community bring plenty of culture to our area.\n\nBIG NEWS! ðŸŽ‰\n\nThis new registered apprenticeship program is the first of its kind in the state and will ramp up the capacity and quality of home-based child care with a new class of expert instructors. Don't forget - registered apprentices earn while they learn!\n\nCheck the state OEC website for updates on how to apply: ctoec.org\n\nIt's so great to see that such a small change had such a big impact this year.\n\nPlus, SNAP enrollees are also automatically eligible for other federally-funded services including the National School Lunch and Breakfast Program, Head Start, and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program!\n\nI encourage you to take a second look at whether you can benefit from SNAP under these new revisions. Learn more at www.ct.gov/snap."
