        "text": "Wanda Andrus Mackintosh\n\n1931 - 2017\n\nOur amazing mother, grandma, grandma-great, sister and friend passed away peacefully, surrounded by loved ones at home on June 27, 2017. Wanda was born on July 23, 1931 in Marion, Summit County, Utah to Willard Oscar and Gwendolyn Williams Andrus.\n\nWanda was the 7th of 8 children. She grew up in Marion and Kamas Utah, before moving to Holladay Utah when she was 8 years old. She attended elementary school in Marion and Holladay, Irvine Jr. High/Olympus Jr. High and graduated from Granite High School. Wanda played the violin in the school orchestra and had her picture on the front cover of “The Childrens Friend” playing her violin.\n\nWanda met the love of her life, Dan, while working at Hammonds Ice Cream Parlor in Holladay. A brief courtship convinced her to spend the eternities with him. They were married in the Salt Lake Temple on September 28, 1949. Their first home was an apartment in the historic Milo Andrus home (Holladay, UT). They bought a home in Glendale Park, UT and then built their home of 61 years in Butler/Cottonwood Heights, UT.\n\nWanda was a dignified woman who lived up to life's challenges. She met every situation head on. She spent most of her time at home raising her 5 children. She truly shadowed the life of her Savior as she exemplified her love and commitment to Christ. She lived a life of service. Wanda's church service included the M Men and Gleaners program for many years, Ward YW President and counselor in the Stake YW, and also served as Ward Relief Society President. She also served as President of PTA at Brighton High School. Her biggest service was what she did without being asked. She baked rolls and loaves of bread weekly and delivered them around the neighborhood to those who were sick, suffering or just needed to know that someone cared. The bread always was accompanied by homemade frozen strawberry or raspberry jam. She loved helping others.\n\nWanda served two missions with her husband Dan. The first was in Scotland and the second was an “Inner City” mission in Salt Lake. She was an amazing missionary and greatly loved by the people she served. Wanda survived cancer with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. She celebrated by going skydiving on her 79th birthday. She survived that as well. Despite her challenges (severe osteoporosis and 3 breaks in her back, cancer, painful neuropathy, disfiguring arthritis, sores that wouldn't heal and most recently her burns which confined her to bed), she continued to joke, share everything she had and watched over her family like a mother hen. Time was not on her side, but the angels of heaven were.\n\nShe was proceeded in death by her parents, 6 siblings and her husband Dan. She is survived by Daniel C. Mackintosh (Julie), Karen Eades (Mike), Judd C. Mackintosh (Debbie) Scott D. Mackintosh (Becky) and Lynne Stevenson (Cory), brother, Garth Andrus, 27 grandchildren, 55 great-grandchildren and 4 on the way. The family is extremely grateful to hospice caregivers Rosie, Carrie, Marlee, Valerie and Dr. Millard whose compassion and kindness went above duty. Thank you. In lieu of flowers, take a loaf of bread and jam to someone in need."
