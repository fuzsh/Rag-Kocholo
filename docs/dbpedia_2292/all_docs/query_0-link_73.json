He had been failing rapidly for more than a year past and his death therefore was not unexpected. About 1857 Mr Bates located at DeWitt, Iowa, where he owned and edited a newspaper several years. He served as postmaster of DeWitt and also was manager there for an Express Company. He left DeWitt about 1876 and established a new newspaper at Boone, Iowa, which he conducted successfully for a year or more, then located at Estherville, Iowa where he established the Vindictaor. It was while Bates was editor of the Vindecator that he coined the word \"Blizzard\" as expressing best the intensity of the fierce storms, which visited the northwest in those days.\n\nMr Bates was subsequently connected with newspapers at Emmetsburg, Iowaq, Marne, Iowa, Ewing and Atkinson, Nebr.\n\nWhat might have been a fatal accident and terminated his career many years ago is recalled as happening to Editor Bates during his residence here. His lodgings at that time were in the second story of what is now the Gardner Meat Market. Coming in late one warm summer evening he sat down in an open window to cool off, lost his balance and fell to the walk below. There were board walks at that time and happening to fall between stringers the boards gave way breaking the fall. With no greater injury to him than a broken arm which mended alright in due time.\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nBeck, Helen Mable Mlinar\n\nborn Atkinson, Oct 9,1904\n\ndau of Joseph and Libbie Kubart Mlinar\n\nmarried George Beck, March 19,1925, Burke, SD\n\ndied July 1993\n\nburied Woodlawn Cem, Atkinson\n\nsisters: Mildred Johnson, Hazel Lockmon, - 2\n\nbrother: Ed, - 1\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nBeck, Lois Ellen Dobrovolny\n\nborn April 10, 1930 near Atkinson\n\ndau of Henry Dobrovolny\n\ngraduated Atkinson HS 1948\n\nmarried Duane Beck at O'Neill, Sept 26,1950\n\ndied April 1,1971 O'Neill\n\nburied Woodlawn Cemetery\n\nchildren: Sheryl Lynn, Sandra LaDean, Lowell Dean, Bryan Gene died in infancy\n\nsisters: Alice Heiser, Delores Burgess, Shirley Shald, Nadine Sammons, Gloria Reddington, Joyce Beelaert, Bonnie Phillips\n\nbrothers: Donald, Henry and Stanley grandparents: Frank Dobrovolny\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nBeckwith, Ethel Helena Anna Johnson\n\nborn Sept 30,1894 - died March 11, 1915\n\nMarch 19,1915 Atkinson Graphic\n\nSUMMONED TO THE BEYOND\n\nMrs Guy Beckwith died at her home near Chambers, Nebr, on Thursday evening, March 11,1915, after a short and severe sickness of ten days.\n\nMiss Ethel Helena Anna Johnson, second daughter of Mr and Mrs Andrew Johnson was born on Sept 30,1894 at Le Mars, Iowa.

Her death was an unusually victorious one with a vivid sense of her Saviors presence she entered the valley of the shadow of death with no fear. It was her happy assurance that her Lord would give to her a crown of life, for \"Precious in the sight of the Lord, is the death of his saints.\"\n\nWhat to us seems to be an untimely death, brings keen sorrow to her father and mother, her six sisters and three brothers, and especially deep is the sorrow resting upon the heart of her young husband, who but yesterday was a bridegroom receiving his beloved and looking forward to a long life of happiness with the chosen one of his heart. But in the providence of God he has been called upon to yield and to give back to the Lord his choice gift of a noble Christian wife, the object of his affection, the inspiration of his life and the comfort of his heart. May the God of peace bring peace to your hearts and may her Christ be your Christ. As He supported her in the great hour of her tiral, may He support you in this your sorrow.\n\nThe funeral service was held on Sunday at M E Church.

He had no known relatives living.\n\nMr DeQuaise was held in high esteem by his comrades of the post, of which he was a charter member, and which also he was allowed to christian \"Ed Lemox Post\" No 39, after a comrade who was killed in the war.\n\nAs an old soldier, after his misfortune he drew a liberal pension. Up until last winter, notwithstanding, this affliction, he was rather a sturdy person, surprisingly so. His even temperament, cheerful and sunny disposition made \"Uncle Jim\" a household symonyn for cheerfulness, under difficulties and the sphere of his friendship as broad as his acquaintance.\n\nHe was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery with the honors of his comrades of the Boys in blue.

Today, gone! Yes gone, but we trust to a far better land. A Heavenly land. Eva was making preparations for that journey when its time should come. She united with the church little over a year ago not thinking so much of the journey as the life of useful service for her Divine Master. She chose as her field of usefulness the Sunday school, and by faithful devoted effort proved the sincerity of her purpose. About the last work she tried to do was to prepare to teach her class of beginners. For her now the Master's \"Well done\". It is said \"God buries his workmen but carries on his work\". Who will take her place.\n\nThe many beautiful floral tributes mutely testify to the large place she occupied in the esteem of her many friends as well as the sympathy thereby expressed to the bereaved family. Their fragrance speaks of the fragrance of her beautiful young life. While their whiteness symbolizes its purity. She leaves to mourn her early departure a father and mother, Mr and Mrs William Dickerson and 8 brothers and sisters, viz; Winnie, Ivan, Ray, Harold, Zane, Clara, Bernice and Hazel, besides many other relatives and a host of friends.\n\nFriends, schoolmates, fellow Sunday school workers, sister and daughter farewell. We linger here yet a few days, then we too will join thee in that \"Sun bright clime\" where there is no disappointment, sickness or death, but eternal morning and life.

Deceased was born in Boyertown, Penn, March 9,1826. He was a son of Joseph and Elizabeth Shottz Freed. Having sprung from a sturdy and industrious German ancestry he early acquired not only the frugal habits and customs of his people but also inherited to an unusual degree those noble traits and fine characteristics that contribute to a life of strictest integrity.\n\nSoon after reaching his majority deceased emigrated to Knox Co, Ill, here in the little hamlet of Victoria, he subsequently met Miss Lucinda Knapp, the estimable young woman who became his wife and bravely shared with her husband and children: the hardships and vicissitudes of two pioneer states, for in 1882 they came to Nebraska and settled on their present homestead in Holt County, then on the frontier.\n\nTo their union five children: were born, viz: John Henry of Beatrice, Charles (deceased), Mrs Ida May McCrosson, a trained nurse, and Robert (or Bert as he is more familiarly known).\n\nOn March 1,1899 after a long and painful illness the devoted wife and mother passed to her eternal rest. Deceased was then in the winter of his life, but surrounded by his grandchildren: in the home of Bert, the youngest son, he lived again and extracted much more from life than the average individual who has reached the ripe years of nearly four score and ten; but the idol of his heart was again shattered, in the passing of Alvin, his little grandson. Alvin?s death preceded that of his grandfather only twenty days. The aged man?s grief was pitiful in the extreme. Loving hands administered in every way possible to tide him through the struggle but the end was inevitable; he had fought his last battle and has gone to the reward that await the faithful in Heaven.\n\nIn 1862 the deceased enlisted in Co K, 83rd Illinois Infantry and served until the end of the war. In brief review of his life it can be said: He served his God and Maker; he served his country; he was a loving husband and father; and a better neighbor and citizen Holt County never knew.\n\nBesides the immediate family at his bedside was a niece, Mrs E F Hollibaugh of Omaha. Charles Freed of Omaha, a great nephew spent several days with his aged kinsman during his last illness.\n\nA little more loneliness in life\n\nAs the dear ones pass away\n\nA bigger claim on the heavenly land\n\nWith each passing day.\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nFreouf, Joseph S\n\nFeb 11,1916 Atkinson Graphic\n\nJOE FREOUF DIES IN WYOMING\n\nThe word of the death of J S Freouf was received here Tuesday by his friends as occurring at Douglas, Wyoming at Noon that day.

Finally coming to Holt County he located 7 miles southeast of Atkinson. In those early days when this barren region called for endurance and energy he gladly accepted his part in active duty by helping build up and develop a new country. By his labor and good management he accumulated much, investing in town dwelling houses and real estate. The greater part of his life in this vicinity was spent on his ranch, where he was successfully engaged in stock raising and diversified farming.\n\nHis life was a long and busy one assisting in the progressive enterprises of the community. He concluded to lay aside the responsibilities and live a quiet life. About five years ago, he moved to Atkinson enjoying good health until last February when he was taken slightly ill, he slowly failed in health.\n\nBeing devotedly attacked to his family, his one desire was to have them constantly in his presence. His every wish was gratified by his faithful wife and children: who did every thing to ease his last moments on earth. As he called each to his bedside he gave them his blessing and bade them farewell. He was well prepared and fully resigned to leave with the winged messenger who came and took his spirit to its Maker.\n\nHe is survived by a wife, four sons, a daughter and nine grandchildren.\n\nServices were held from St Joseph Catholic Church on Wednesday where a requieum Mass was celebrated for the repose of his soul.

He was hurled about 120 feet and his left side was crushed in. It is thought that he died instantly.\n\nMr Jonas was employed as a gardener at the state fair grounds. He had finished his work at 6 o'clock and had started for home. As he neared the northwestern tracks a block south of the grounds, the train approached from the east and the whistle was blown for the crossing. Jonas apparently heard the whistle, but thougt he could get across in time. The engine struck him, threw him a short distance in the air and then as he fell, caught him a second time and sent him in a horizontal direction. He fell in a clump of weeds south of the right of way.
