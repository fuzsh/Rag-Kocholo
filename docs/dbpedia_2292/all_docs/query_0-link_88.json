They were organized into hundreds, fifties and tens. Along the way, the group's size changed several times and not all those who started completed the journey because of various changes in duties. However, Church historians have determined that the credit for blazing the trail should go equally to all who began.\n\nAdams, Barnabas L. – (2nd Ten) Born Aug. 28, 1812, near Perth, Upper Canada, of Vermont parentage and was converted to the Church at age 23.

Once hired to float logs down the Mississippi River from Iowa to St. Louis, Mo., he used his experience during river fordings. After crossing the plains with Brigham Young's company in 1847, he immediately returned to Winter Quarters for his family. He brought his family into the Salt Lake Valley in 1848 and settled in the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon.

He served in the Eastern States Mission from 1842-43. He was called to the Nauvoo High Council in 1844, and after further missionary activity in the east in 1845, helped with the Nauvoo Temple and took part in the exodus of 1846. That winter, while in Mt. Pisgah, Iowa, he received notification from Brigham Young that he had been called to the Quorum of the Twelve, replacing John E. Page. He was part of the pioneer company into the valley. He decided to return east and help guide oncoming companies into the Salt Lake Valley.

George worked on Mississippi River boats and helped his father, a stonemason and carpenter, build the temples in Kirtland and Nauvoo. He joined the pioneer company at age 20. He drove a wagon across the plains for his cousin, Heber C. Kimball. By the time Billings arrived in the Valley, his shoes and shirt were gone and his buckskin pants had stretched, been trimmed and shrank. Elder Kimball's wife made him a new shirt of a striped straw tick, and a pair of moccasins. Upon seeing him in his scant outfit, Heber C. Kimball felt to prophesy that soon \"clothing can be bought here as cheap as in New York City.\" This prophecy was literally fulfilled with the arrival of California pioneers and gold seekers. Billings later went to California in search of gold. He found gold, went to Mexico and bought livestock and was bringing it to Utah when all of his stock became diseased and died. He returned poorer than he left, just as Brigham Young said would happen to those who left in search of gold. He helped settle Carson Valley, Nev. After the arrival of Johnston's army in 1858, and the abandonment of the outlying settlements, he moved to Manti, Sanpete Co., Utah. There he helped build the temple.

He returned to Nauvoo in 1845 with others responding to a call for volunteers to help defend the city and to complete the temple. A few months later he brought his wife to Nauvoo. They stayed until January 1846. With the exodus from Nauvoo imminent, he left for Mississippi again. Because of increasing local hostility in Mississippi, they gathered a group of 60 saints and headed west, expecting to intercept the vanguard company of Saints on the trail. Instead, they learned that the Saints had laid over a year. So Brown left his family in log cabins in Pueblo, Colo., and went to Winter Quarters where he joined the pioneer company. He was one of the advance company who first viewed the Salt Lake Valley. His family came west in 1848 and settled in the Cottonwood area. He later served as a missionary and helped explore southern Utah. He was mayor of Pleasant Grove, Utah, for 20 years and bishop of the Pleasant Grove Ward for 29 years.

He served in the bishopric of the Fourteenth Ward for a time, and in 1858 sold his horse to answer a call to serve a mission in Quebec, Canada. He used the proceeds from the horse sale to buy a handcart with which he traveled the continent eastward.

When the pioneers came to this now-abandoned station while crossing the plains, Brigham Young allowed Case to take the equivalency of pay in abandoned iron, such as a stove, plows and iron bars. He was required to send a letter of explanation to his former employers, however. He later served as a missionary in the Indian Territory of Oklahoma. He arrived for service in St. Louis on Nov. 10, 1855, and \"all [missionaries] suffered from want of clothing and proper food, as the Indians among whom they labored were very poor.\" Elder Case was called to preside over the Creek Nation, and organized the Princess Branch. This branch struggled from lack of local leadership. The handful of missionaries in this mission were ill, and a few died while serving in this mission. Perhaps the effects of this illness claimed Case, as he died in Sanpete Co., Utah, in 1858, soon after returning from his mission.\n\nChamberlain, Solomon – (11th Ten) Born July 30, 1788, in Old Canaan, Conn., to Joel and Sarah Dean Chamberlain.

He had mountain fever, and suffered from cholera and as near death on his original journey west. Chamberlain returned to Winter Quarters with his rations being just two quarts of parched corn and three quarts of coarse corn meal.

While crossing the muddy fields of Iowa near what is now Corydon, he wrote the famous hymn \"Come, Come, ye Saints\" which has since become well known around the world. As scribe and historian of the pioneer journey, he recorded many of the events of the historic trek.

He helped survey the city site, helped build bridges, make roads and erect schools and meetinghouses. He was described as \"one of the oldest members of the Church and was identified with many of the earliest incidents in the days of Kirtland.
