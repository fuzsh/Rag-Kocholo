At the age of 19 years, he went to Whitwick, Lelcestershire, England, where he married Hannah Nester in 1853. This union 5 children were born, Michael and John in England, Richard, Mary and Anna, after the family came to Penn in 1865, arriving there at the close of the Civil War, where they resided at Wilkes Barre, Penn, until coming to Holt Co in April 1877, at the solicitation of Gen John O'Neill, who was most instrumental in the early settlement of Holt and other counties of this state.\n\nThe deceased was one of the first to settle in this part of the county, when only a treeless plain was endless to the view, rendered wild and fascinating by countless deer and antelope and fearful and weird by the appearance, ever and anon of Indians in quest of game.\n\nHis 24 years of residence here was principally given to farming and stock raising and doing much toward the up building of Atkinson and vicinity by way of permanent improvements.\n\nHe was a sufferer for many years with bronchial asthma and during the past 4 years, he was infrequently attacked with asthmatic strangulation which caused suffocation unless instantly relieved by relaxing remedies. One of these attacks, accompanied with heart failure, was the cause of his sudden death, which occurred Nov 27,1901.\n\nInterment was made in Catholic Cem. at this place, after appropriate services at the catholic church of which he was a devoted member, striving to live always in the spirit and harmony of words, \"Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you\".\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nCunningham, Rev Lloyd\n\nborn Feb 15,1872 Miflintown, Penn\n\nmarried Ila McLarty in 1906\n\ndied Jan 13,1920 Atkinson\n\nburied Woodlawn Cem., Atkinson\n\nchildren: David, Harold, Helen, Lois, Keith\n\nsister: Mrs. W H Gildersleeves, Mrs. Charles Gildersleeves, Mrs. C O Gearhart\n\nbrother: Will\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nCurran, Dorothy E Ott\n\nborn Dec 13,1915 north of O'Neill\n\ndau. of Lorenzo Ott\n\nmarried Francis Curran, July 10,1939 Emmett\n\ndied Dec 20,1975 O'Neill\n\nburied Catholic Cem., O'Neill\n\nchildren: Betty Paulson, Mary Jo Jurgenmeier\n\nbrothers: Virgil, Robert, Alvin\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nDaly, Henry Sylvester\n\nJan 23,1903 Atkinson Graphic\n\nH S Daley, son of Mr. and Mrs. William Daley, residing near Minneola, and brother of Mrs. J J Harrington, died in a hospital at Salt Lake City, Jan 12 after a short illness of lung trouble.

He will be greatly missed all along his route as well as by his relatives.\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nJohnson, Col Benjamin White\n\nMarch 6,1903 Atkinson Graphic\n\nBENJAMIN WHITE JOHNSON\n\nBenjamin White Johnson was born near Brownsville, Penn on Jan 23,1822 and was but one year old when the family moved to Stark Co, Ohio, at that time the frontier of civilization.\n\nHe was married to Mary L Spears on the first of May 1851 and to their union were born 3 daughters and 1 son. 2 of the daughters are dead, one, Flora D Potter, being buried in Ohio and the other, Stella Johnson in Iowa. The other daughter is Mrs. India L Walker of Atkinson and the son is James K Johnson of San Francisco.\n\nColonel Johnson's life was one of remarkable activity and usefulness, marked with substation of services both public and private. In early life he secured an academic education and afterwards taught school in Ohio, Kentucky and Penn, using the money thus earned to pay expenses while studying law in the office of his uncle in the town of California, Pennsylvania. When the war broke out he closed his law office to become lieutenant Colonel of the 111th Ohio Infantry. Also during this period he was a conductor on the famous underground railroad, running from Louisville to Cleveland, and many a poor black man owes life and freedom to Col Johnson and his friends.\n\nAt the close of the war he followed the tide of emigration westward and helped to lay out the town site of Marshalltown, Iowa, and served as its mayor. He served as representative from Marshall County and was later nominated for governor, but was defeated on account of his temperance sentiments. He was an ardent advocate of temperance and made fifty eight speeches on that subject during one campaign in Iowa. He possessed a remarkable oratorical talent, and was much sought for on special occasions, having delivered fifty six fourth of July orations during his life time, and shortly before his death he said he only wished to live to deliver four more to make it an even sixty.\n\nAn idea of Col Johnson's span of life, his experiences and his consequent powers of interesting retrospection may be had from the simple fact, as stated by him, that he saw the hole dug and the first telegraph pole erected on the continent.\n\nMr. Johnson was reared among the Quakers and their teachings made a powerful impression on him. Throughout his life he was foremost in active philanthropy and his acts of generosity would fill a volume, and yet, before death he said that he had been paid three found for every kind act he ever performed.\n\nHe moved with his family to Holt County in July 1883 and had been a resident here ever since, active in all things tending to the good of the greatest number, and respected and esteemed by all. He was postmaster and although nearly 82 years old was an active real estate dealer up to the time of his last sickness which resulted in death at 7 o'clock Monday morning, March 2. The funeral and burial occurred from the opera house Wednesday and was universally attended, especially by the old soldiers, who mourn the loss of their beloved comrade who has preceded them a short space into the Great Beyond.\n\nTo his beloved wife, the companion of his earthly struggles for nearly fifty two years, and to his other relatives is extended the sympathy of all friends, whose grief indeed is scarce less than their own; for to know Col Johnson was to admire and esteem him.\n\nHe died as he had lived a consistent Christian gentleman, exemplifying the good that may be wrought by a human life properly directed. He is dead, but the influence of his stalwart Christian manhood and unselfish life will live and bear fruit through years to come. He has gone to his well earned reward. May he rest in peace unto the day when his soul shall rise to eternal glory.\n\nSubmitted by Doris Counts\n\nJohnson, Ed\n\nNov 29,1907 Atkinson Graphic\n\nA sad accident occurred at Inman Tuesday, Nov 19 in which Ed Johnson of Inman was killed.

Kittendorf was in the best of health and told Mr. Kelley that he would have no trouble going the 2 ½ miles to his home and at once started for there. This was the last seen of him until his lifeless body was discovered by his son at 10 o'clock last Saturday morning.
