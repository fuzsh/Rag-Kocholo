Cady Cemetery’s restoration is now complete. Additional work was done at Hillside Cemetery and will be continued next year. Photos here of the work were taken by Ruben Cuellar. Money for these projects is raised yearly by our Cemetery Walks in May. This is added to Palatine Township’s funds for care of their five cemeteries.\n\n================================================================================="
