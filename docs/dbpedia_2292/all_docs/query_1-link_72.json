Atwater and the Compiler Information Not Found in This Volume Should be Sought in Volumes I and II. Compiled by Francis Atwater Published by The Journal Press, Meriden, Conn. 1918. PREFATORY REMARKS. The Atwater family can congratulate itself that this history, the third compiled by the writer, and preceded by two small rec- ords edited by the late Rev. E. E. Atwater, of New Haven, Conn., the first being published in the early fifties, followed by a second twenty years later, covers a period of nearly seventy years of re- search and compiling. Probably no other family in the United States has been so fortunate as to have two of its members follow in succession, tracing, searching, classifying, and publishing their reports at stated periods. There can be no doubt of the fact for the writer has familiarized himself with nearly every genealogy printed, and knows of not one that has a continuous record. The work has never depended upgn the family contributing toward its support or guaranteeing expenses of publication. In fact, the purchase of a book has been a privilege granted. In this respect the writer visited one Atwater who lived several hundred miles away. After giving the family history the host asked his guest how much he charged for his book. The price of $5.00 brought an expression of astonishment at the high cost. The expense of the expedition had been $35. The guest told his host while it would cost as much more to return, if he should sell him a copy, which was immaterial, the difference between the price paid and the expense would be about the profit and loss each sale entailed. Conscientious compilers, who have had expe- rience, realize a family history must necessarily be accomplished without any expectation of compensation. While one edition after another has been more complete, the present book has afforded a chance to be the product of expe- rience that can only be gained by a long apprenticeship. We had supposed that but very few family names in America and Canada had escaped our notice, but after wading through several hun- dred town, city and county directories we found that there were nearly 300 names unrecorded. When this book is printed we ex- pect to add sketches and pedigrees of every one who can be traced out. This is no easy task, for although we may have the 4 ATWATER HISTORY. correct address, and send one request, a second, even a third, the chances are that not one in ten will send an answer. Then some one in the town or city where the recalcitrant lives must be found who will furnish the information sought or the compiler must give up his time and money to seek it himself. While many may not care whether their projenitors were good, bad or indifferent, only one had the boldness to say so, John Birdseye Atwater, of Minneapolis, Minn., who curtly dismissed a courteous inquiry by writing : \"I am not interested in family genealogy, even in myself.\" Yet his father had been an hon- ored judge of the state of Minnesota and we had hoped to print more of his life work. The descendants of David Atwater for the first 125 years of their existence, had followed agricultural pursuits, were trades- men, shipping merchants, and some few had served as craftsmen in various trades. They do not seem to have devoted much time to educational training or studied for professional careers until Jeremiah, grandson of Jonathan (for his period the merchant prince of New Haven), became steward of Yale college, serving from 1778 to 1798. Since that period have graduated from various colleges minis- ters, doctors, lawyers and men of science and these have located in various sections of the United States and foreign countries. Five have been presidents of colleges, three brothers serving dif- ferent colleges at the same period. W'e could furnish statistics of all who have been identified with the growth of the country professionally, but figures are dry reading. We know some ridiculous errors have occurred in the first and second volumes, but we asked for criticisms and corrections. We know we never shall be forgiven for one error where by mistake a son was born a month after marriage. This was brought to our attention seventeen years after it first appeared in print and the voice which came over the telephone was choked with indig- nation. The unfortunate subject of this misprint we were told had never been informed, and it was hoped never ^yould be, espe- cially for our comfort. So you who have never committed a typographical sin know now that death is the only preventative of getting your deserts, for time has no allaying or soothing mit- igation. ATWATER HISTORY. 5 We present in this book the descendants of Ehhu Atwater, who went from his home town, Wallingford, Conn., to locate in Flor- ida prior to 1820. We had formerly traced him to a location called Cowford in that state and there all trace was lost. It has been our good fortune to include many other families heretofore unrecorded, the detection of which has been brought about from chance or apparently vague efforts. Persistency in many in- stances has revealed family connections more than one hundred years old. The simple record of births, marriages and deaths which we have tried to record correctly we do not attach much importance to. But where the man or woman has accomplished some worthy achievement the foundation is set as being worth while to per- petuate the family name. The three Atwater Histories are not monotonous presentations in stereotype form of one author, but generally told by some representative of each branch so as to record facts pertinent to distinguished deeds or the life history of a deserving career. Our position is similar to the dictagraph, or rather the typewriter, being the instrument to place on paper the information which others seek to convey. This being a war period, it is timely to say that the family has been represented in every war which has taken place in the United States, notably the French and Indian, the war for independence, the 1812 war, the Mexican, the Civil, the Spanish, and at this writing the allied cause, notably by the two young sons of Richard Mead Atwater, Jr., respectively nineteen and seventeen years old. In the Civil war an older brother of the writer entered at sixteen years of age, his tragic career being told elsewhere. After reading the family history covering the period of over four hundred years, who can gainsay that it should not be per- petuated ? Where no change has occurred in families since the publica- tion of the \"second volume, these names have been omitted. Francis Atwater, 41 Dwight St., New Haven, Conn. ATWATER HISTORY, DESCRIPTION OF THE EARLY FARM OF THE ATWATERS. The following\" is a copy of a letter written by Rev. E. E. At- water, of New Haven, Conn., on a visit to London, about 1870. The place where the Atwaters lived in London resembles in soil that of Cedar Hill. Some of the land in the neighborhood is so sandy that it was never thought worth enclosing until with- in the last fifty years, though now with the improved husbandry of modern times, it does very well, especially in wet seasons. The land which they owned and cultivated for several centuries is lower than the open heath of which I have been speaking. It borders, indeed, upon a brook, and two lanes extend from the highway through the land to the vicinity of the brook. One of the lanes still retains the name of Water street. I have no doubt it took the name from our family who were called water and waters as well as at waters. Indeed, I find in old records a great many ways of writing it. One of our an- cestors, who calls himself Atwater, speaks of Adam Water, his brother's son, and the father of this Adam styles his name a church warden, Edward Water. The land lies something like the following diagram. At figure 1st was an At- water house, the chimney of which is still standing, a la- borer's house having been built up to it with the bricks of the old house. The house with the land was given to David (the emigrant) by an uncle of the same name who had buried his only child. Ad- joining it at 2, is an old house, still standing, of a type so antique that I cannot think it is less tahn 300 years old. It has some peculiarities of ar- chitecture which I have seen nowhere else except at Ospringe, Formerly a barren hill Rosemary Lane Water St. AT WATER HISTORY. 7 which an old historian of the county says was the home of the At- waters before they lived at Lenham. At 3 and 4 are two other houses very similar to 2, but not so well preserved. No. 4 is scarcely fit to be inhabited but some apartments are occupied, I think, though I found no person at home either at my first or sec- ond visit. There are some fine large ash trees near No. 3. I think that No. 2 was the home of the father of the emigrants as their grandfather in his will describes it as adjoining Grant's Gate, which is still the name of No. i. I found on the parish register the baptism of Joshua, June 2nd, 161 1, and of David Oct. 8th, 161 5. I found also the baptism of Anna, their sister, May 13th, 1606, and have no doubt she is the \"sister Atwater\" mentioned in the seating of the meeting house in 1646, and that she made the family of Joshua count two in the first census though there is no evidence that he had a wife until he married Mary Blackman in 1651. These three were orphaned by the death of their father in Oct., 1636, and of their mother the fol- lowing January. Tlie expedition of Davenport and Eaton was by this time on foot, for in Jan., 1637, the vessel in which they sailed had been engaged. The inference is easy that these young people left free from the duty of staying at home sold their property and came to New England hoping to find a place where the arm of Lords could not touch them. Hoping these additions to the other letter may be interesting, I am yours truly, Edward E. Atwater. ATWATER HISTORY, GENEALOGY AND HISTORY (For other information see first and second volume Atwater Genealogy and History.) FIRST GENERATION. 1. David Atwater, son of Thomas and Susan Narson, baptized in Len- ham church October 8, 1615. He was born in Eoyton in Lenham, Eng- land, and in the month in which he became twenty-one years of age, October, 1636, his father died, and his mother died scarcely more than two months later, â in January, 1637. In less than six months from the latter event, June 26, 1637, the brothers, Joshua and David, with their sister Ann, arrived in Boston. It cannot be doubted that their ar- rangements for removal, so hastily made at that time of general dis- content and apprehension in church and state affairs, involved large pe- cuniary sacrifices. He was one of the first settlers of New Haven, Conn. He married Damaris Sayre, daughter of Thomas Sayre, of Southamp- ton, L. I., before March 10, 1646-7. She died April 7, 1691.

Francis Atwater: Dear Sir: â Yours received, also several previous ones, intended to write before, but am a very busy woman and my information is lim- ited, as to date, utterly clouded. My grandfather was Jesse Atwater, married Lucretia Marten, in New York state \"some where,\" came to Du Page ecounty, took up 200 acres of land for which he paid the government $125 per. There were seven children, born all in New York. Four girls, three boys â Olive, Betesy, Ann, Eachel, William, George and Benjamin who was the youngest and my father. Olive married a Ben Fuller. They lived on a farm just half way between Aurora and Chicago, the old Indian trail. It was a day's journey in those days, so they put up the travelers and opened a Tavern. It was called the half-way house and stands to-day a landmark of times gone by. A small town started there and is called \" Fullersburg. \" My father married Lucy J. Black from Broon county, a descendent of Rob- ert Burns. There are three children, Elnora, Alberte, William. My father's name went down the first one on the list at President Lincoln's first call for volunteers. I am very proud of my father. He served all through, was wounded at the last big battle. My mothere gave here life, as well, left with three little children, one a babe in arms, and all the hardships to go through; the then called galloping consumption developed and my father came home to find my mother dead and the children gone. If you write to Alfred Atwater, Elmhurst, Du Page Co., 111., I think you may get more direct information. , Yours cordially, ALBERTE ATWATER. 159. Elihu, son of Elihu; m. Scott. He left Conecticut soon af- ter or before 1800. He went south, stopping two years in the Carolinas before going to Florida where he settled. He drew land from the gov- AT WATER HISTORY. 23 ernment and located at St. Mary's, Camden Co., Ga.; from there he moved to Quincy, Fla., and practiced law. He was given a certificate from Samuel Wyllys, secretary of the state of Connecticut, dated May 22, 1801, that he had been admitted to the New Haven county bar and resided in Wallingford, Conn. He accumulated some wealth and owned quite a number of slaves. He d. Oct. 17, 1828. 377. Martha; ni. A. Larrier; d. when young. 378. William Jesse; b. Sept. 2, 1814. 379. Laura Maria; b.

In the attack of the British on New Haven he was wounded and left for dead on the field, but recovered. After the defeat of Napoleon at the battle of Waterloo he was employed by the friends of the empereor to purchase a tract of land in Northern New York, which they intended as a retreat for the emperor should he succeed in making his escape. But on hearing that Napoleon had given himself to the English the project was abandoned. The two townships of land purchased and settled are in St. Lawrence Co., N. Y. It was a dense forest, and the only means of getting there was a road cut through the woods from Canada, corduroyed in wet and marshy places. Mr. Atwater built a store and saw mill and spent his fortune in improving his property. The two towns were named Eussell (after Mr. Atwater) and Norfolk. The present site of Potsdam was in this tract (12 miles by 6 miles). As there was much ague the country was slowly settled, and thought to be unhealthy and Mr. Atwater failed when his son was in the midst of his college course and he was obliged to teach school to get money to carry him through college and the Theo- logical Seminary. 382.

Clarissa Storrs, d. 1834; (2) Mrs. Susan Barnes, whom he survived four years until his death, July 29, 1858. He was the first president of Middlebury College, Vermont, and afterward President of Dickinson College, at Carlisle, Pa. He was a native of New Haven, and a graduate of Yale College, class of 1793; was tutor in that college from 1795 to 1799; President at Middlebury from 1800 to 1809, and President at Carlisle from 1810 to 1818, when he resigned, after which he lived a very retired life on the parsimony left him by his father, the later years almost as a recluse. His house in New Haven stood on the site once occupied by Colonel John Dixwell, famous as one of the judges by whom King Charles I. was sentenced to execution as a traitor. Dr. Atwater was a man of great reading, and of a retentive memory, especially of historic events and the lives and characters of men he had known, but had not a fondness for writing, and has left, it is believed, but few literary remains of his life. 750.

Dear Sir: As you seem quite persistent in writing me, I will tell you all I know which is not much. I may, and may not be any relation to your family. My grandfather. Ward Atwater, I think, was born in Nova Scotia, near Halifax. My grandmother, I know, was. She was Mary Ann Biglow. There were twelve children born to this union, seven sons and five daughters. Seven of these children were born in Nova Scotia. All lived to grow up but three who died in childhood. They lived in Eastern Wisconsin some years after coming from Nova Scotia. From there they came to La Crosse county, Wis., being in the western part of the state. Their children married and raised families. The most of them, at least. One son, James, a soldier of the Civil war, was unmarried and Eebecca never had any. My aunt, Eebecca Byrns, ATWATER HISTORY. 45 of Sparta, Wis., is the oiiW one of the children living. She is seventy- seven years of age. My father, Wililam B. Atwater, died April 8, 1917. My mother, Calista Post Atwater, has her home with me. There were three boys and one girl in their family, Elmer E., my oldest brother, died (or was drowned) at the age of 23. He left an infant daughter who is now Mrs. Guy Lindsey of Utah. My other brother, J. T. At- water, lives in Barron, Wis. He buried his first wife and married again. Has four living children, three of them married. My only sister, Grace M. Jewett, lives at Rice Lake, Wis., and has eight living children, all unmarried as yet. My sister is fifteen years younger than I am and the two brothers are older. As for me I have two living children, a son, who lives on the farm, and about fifty feet from me and has three chil- dren. A daughter, Lenore Kirst, w^ho lives about thirty miles from me, and has none, as she has only been married one year, the ith of April, there is plent}^ of time yet. Yours truly, L. F. ATWATER. Rice Lake, Wis., April 7, 1918. Francis Atwater, Xew Haven, Conn. Dear Mr. Atwater: â Your letter at hand and was surprised to hear of such an Atwater. I didn't think there were enough of the family to make a very long history. I was married March 21st, 1900, to Harry M, Jewett, of West Salem, Wis. We have had nine children. Zeriah Ann, b.

Edward Daniel, son of William, fitted for college at the Acad- emy, St. Albans, Vt., under his brother Hiram, who was at that time principal. He entered the University of Vermont at Burlington in 1849, and was graduated in the classical course in Aug., 1853, on his twentieth birthday. In 186!J, he married Sarah Josephine Waring, of Brooklyn, N. Y., who lived only fifteen months, dying with their baby daughter at 48 ATWATER HISTORY. St. Cloud, Minn. On Jan. 7, 1867, he married Cornelia Augusta Evarts, of Burlington, Vt., who with their daughter, Ella Evarts, survives him. Ella E. was born Nov. 20, 1868; m. Nov. 12, 1903, Daniel Parker Kilborn. Mr. Atwater died of erysipelas at Point of Eocks, Mont., on Good Friday, April 7, 1882, and was buried at Dillon, Mont., on Easter Sunday. His profession was that of civil engineer, and his experience was gained in government surveys in Michigan and Minnesota. For many years he was secretary of the Land Department of the St. Paul and Pa- cific E. E., with offices at St. Paul, and the town of Atwater, Minn., was named for him. Shortly before his death, in 1882, he received from the federal government the appointment of Deputy Mineral Surveyor of the territories of 'Montana and Idaho, with a salary of $10,000. He was the first in that country to use the solar compass. Mr. Atwater 's perseverance and tenacit}^ of purpose, as well as his technical skill, are illustrated in the following incident related by an old friend and fellow worker, Mr. J. M. Page: \"In 1856 he had a large government contract to extend the public sur- veys in northern Michigan. The work was found to be very difficult, heavy forests, dense cedar swamps, and worst of all, a chain of lakes, bordered with thickets of cedar, making it next to impossible for him to run the meander lines. In fact, he found it could not be done on land without heavy loss, so he decided to run the exteriors and section lines, setting the meander corners on the lakes that year, and return in the early spring and run the meander lines on the ice. Early in March of 18.57 he returned from Vermont with a party to complete his work. There were four of us, and our first experience was to go a hundred and fifty miles north from Newago, Mich., through dense forest, on snow shoes, each carrying a pack of seventy-five pounds. When we finally reached the work, we found the lakes covered with a solid sheet of ice, but over it, four to twelve inches of water caused by a recent thaw. That was when our real trouble began. We, of course, had to run our lines on the ice; and there was no time to lose, as spring was at hand. When it came to taking readings in ice-water ten or twelve hours a day and then camping in three to five feet of snow at night; there seemed an end to ordinary human endurance; so at the end of the first week two sturdy men declared they could not stand it and quit. The result was that Mr. Atwater and I completed the work alone before the ice broke up. How his other men could desert him in such a crisis is more than I can see.

July 19, 1825; d. Oct. 29, 1915. He was for many years prominent in the business circles of the town of Westfield, where he had made his home for the greater part of his long life of ninety years. He was born in the town of Eussell, Hampden Co., Mass. His grandfather, Benjamin Atwater, a native of New Haven, but for many years a resident of Cheshire, Conn., was a very successful business man, and for many years in connection with large farming interests kept the Cheshire Inn. Through exceptional business ability and a natural genius for trading he was able to exchange to great advantage his farm products in the city of New Haven for var- ious things necessary in the running of a public house. This trait of ability to trade was apparently inherited from his grandfather, Jona- than, who as we know was called at the height of his business career in New Haven, one of the \"merchant princes.\" Thus it would seem that the great grandchild, Leonard, came naturally by his talents as trader and business man. At the age of sixteen we find him beginning his bus- iness career, previous to which time all opportunities of an education had been obtained at the district school and Wilbraham Academy. From 1840 when he made his first business trip to Ohio, in the interests of the American Whip Co., until 1898, when he retired from active busi- ness with but few intermissions, which might properly be called vaca- tions, he was an untiring and indefatigable worker. His success during this period was so marked that he is recorded in the town history, as be- ing one of the most successful of the business men of his day and gen- eration. In the prime of life Mr Atwater was of medium height. He had dark hair, sparkling black eyes, and a very pleasing address in con- versation. He was a great story teller, and withal a very agreeable per- son to meet. 951. Ellen M., b. July 11, 1843; m. -E. M. Chesley. 952. Albert C, b. March 3, 1846. Issue by second marriage: 953.
