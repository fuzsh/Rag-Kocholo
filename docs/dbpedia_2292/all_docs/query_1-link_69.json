Frank McClure.\n\nASHTABULA, O., Oct. 1, - An entertaining chapter in the history of the Great Lakes is told by Capt. Crawford Large of this city, who carried a 150-ton ore cargo from Detroit to Erie, Pa., in 1853. This was the same year that Capt. J. H. Andrews delivered the first ore cargo from Lake Superior to Cleveland.\n\nSand was used for ballast in those days, said Capt. Large in an interview. At Buffalo there was a large dock for ballast, where this sand was kept in store. Fifty to 100 tons were utilized on one vessel. When a boat was ready to load a cargo this ballast was dumped overboard outside the harbor. In 1853 some of the vessels coming from Sault Ste. Marie began using iron ore ballast. This was much loss in bulk and, of course, very heavy. On arriving at Detroit this ore was dumped onto the docks. These amounts finally grew into a 300-ton pile. Some of the ore was in 50-pound chunks. One day orders came to take this ore to Erie, Pa. From this point it was later taken via the old canal to the present day furnace districts. The Atlas was one of two boats chosen to take this 300 tons to Erie, each vessel carrying 150 tons. Mr. Large was captain of the Atlas for twenty years. He began sailing at the age of fourteen and sailed until 1874. He is today seventy-two years of age.\n\nBut to return to the early days: The people of both Detroit and Erie looked upon the 150-ton ore cargoes with wonderment, for they were the first ones which they had ever seen. On arriving at Erie, whisky barrels were sawed in two in the middle and made into buckets, which were filled with ore and subsequently hoisted to the docks. Capt. Large's cargoes in those days often consisted of boxes of cheese bound for Buffalo. Between the cheese boxes wheat was filled in. Quite a quantity of wheat was thus carried, in addition to the main cargo.\n\nOne thins nowadays that Great Lake vessels run late into the winter, but it would be difficult to beat the record of some of the early day boats. Capt. Large remembers a trip from Detroit to Buffalo and return at nearly New Years. A cargo of beef and pork was to be delivered in Buffalo. Numerous captains were at Detroit having finished their last voyage of the year. A crew was made up of all captains for this trip, and they drew cuts to see who among the nummer should be in command of the boat and who should hold the various other positions. Each member of this crew received the same pay.\n\nThe passenger vessels on the Great Lakes in the late '40s, remarked Capt. Albert Fields, also of this city, were as fine in their appointments as many of those of the present day. Capt. Fields was in command of some of these early steamers. In those days there were no great trunk railroad lines to carry passengers over long stretches of country, and the travel by water was extensive. The development of the passenger boats of that day was much further advanced than that of hte freight carriers. Some of hte side wheeles of a half century ago nicely accommodated several hundred people each, while the freight boats did well if they carried 150 tons. The table linen on the passenger steamers as the real thing and the silverware was of the best. There were as aristocratic passengers then as now. The speed of the vessels, too, was remarkable. The Western Metropolis used to cover the distance between Cleveland and Buffalo in ____ and ________ ____ ____ ____ be considered a notable run even in this day.\n\nCapt. Fields recalls some of the wrecks of steamers on Lake Erie a half century or more ago. The Atlantic, late in the 40s was lost within three miles of Long Point in seventy-five feet of water and lies there today. On board were some two or three hundred immigrants, all of whom perished. Then there was the steamer Washington, built in 1837, when burned to the water's edge off Silver creek while on her second trip. Sixty lives were lost. A large per cent.\n\nSource: Plain Dealer (Cleveland, Ohio) Page: 53\n\nDated: Sunday - Sept. 10, 1911\n\nDID ASHTABULA have a LUCRETIA BORGIA?\n\nFrom left to right the graves of Abigail, Walter, Lutehr, Arthur, Julia A., Mrs. Rebecca, Alexander M., and Mrs. Eliza McAdams in East Ashtabula cemetery. The first six died mysterious deaths. Alexander was Jeanette McAdams' father., Rebecca, her mother, and Eliza her father's second wife, whom me harried after Jeanette's flight.\n\nASHTABULA had her centennial homecoming. There were many old residents who returned and not a few of them who wandered over to Edgewood cemetery, the burying ground at East Ashtabula.\n\nSix graves in a row. There were many who remembered it. They remembered vaguely the tale of old Alexander McAdams. It is all but forgotten by the present generation, but the older ones who returned - they well knew the legend. Once more these older ones wandered to the cemetery, as they used to go arm in arm with their sweethearts, of a Sunday afternoon, and they looked once more upon the McAdams burial lot, with its six graves that they knew the story of, and its two newer ones.\n\nAshtabula was only a little settlement then, a group of farm houses, a church, blacksmith shops, factories and some stores. There are only a few left now who remember it. They were children playing about the streets then. But they have heard their parents tell the strange story of the McAdams family; they remember how old Alexander McAdams with his wife and nine children came to Ashtabula and cleared away a patch in the pine woods, and built a house with a big fireplace in it, and how he lived much to himself and worked quietly at hsi patch of land.\n\nOne day one of their playmates died; the youngest McAdams child. But they played on after a few days just the same. Then a few years later there were two more deaths in the McAdams family; sudden and horrible for the agony of the victims.\n\nSome relentless fate, no one knew nor could imagine what, was hanging over the McAdams family. Soon another was struck down, and terror was on the whole village. Alexander McAdmas, who had come to the new country to hew out a humble existence, his wife who had seen four of her children die as she stood helplessly by, and the little children who stood 'round and watched the lamps by the sick bed, and then the funeral - they all passed their days in fear and trembling. From sunrise until evening, none knew when his turn would come; nor whether mother, brother, father or sister would be the next to join his kindred in the silent row of graves over in Edgewood cemetery.\n\nThe Daughter Who Wandered Away\n\nThere was some hushed gossip that Jennette McAdams had done away with her brothers and sisters. After the death of her mother she disappeared. It was said that the day before she left she had given her father a letter to _ost. Out of curiosity, it is said, he opened the letter and found that it outlined plans for doing away with him. Shortly after this she left home.\n\nNone knew much of the girl. She had worked in Cleveland and, strangely enough, whenever she visited her parents there was call for doctors in the night, excited running about and shouting, the neighbor women would run in to lend their aid, and there would be another funeral. After Jeanette's disappearance the stories of the alleged p_____ were quieted, and children huddled before the fire listened to their elders talking of the strange deaths of the McAdams children.\n\nThere were rumors that at intervals Jeanette had revisited her home. Once it was whispered that she came as a tramp, dressed in man's clothing, wandering about the face of the earth and other time it was reported that her father had seen her in a gypsy camp. Again came the rumor that Jeanette was a ____ during the war, and it was later told that she had married, and lived in some far away city in the west, and that on one occasion she had visited her father, and was ordered away.\n\nBut he si___ave_ in a row tell the story They have been there a long time, one of them since 1848. There are eight in all, though, five children, father, mother and stepmother, it is in a corner of the East Ashtabula cemetery; one of the oldest corners, in fact, in the cemetery. Around it are quaint old marble headstones, with names on them that are thought old fashioned now.\n\nA gray fungus has over-spread the bases of these monuments, but the inscriptions are clear on the white marble slabs. The graves are not sunken, nor grass grown; the grounds are too well groomed for that. The outlines are but faintly defined; over the graves the grass grows a trifle greener than elsewhere. The shadows of the tombstones protect that part of the sod from the burning afternoon sun; the rest of the McAdams lot is dull, dead gray. There have been no flowers on these graves for years. Around the tombstones a few shoots of \"sheep sorrel\" have sprung up; that is all.\n\nIn these narrow cells lie the McAdams family. The story of their death is mostly tradition now; all the written record of the story is an old publication, the Lake Shore Magazine, long since out of print. There are the death notices, also with poetry, in the yellow files of the current newspapers, and more recently part of the story was printed in the local paper, signed by one of hte old residents of the village.\n\nJulia Was the First to Die.\n\nJeanette was the oldest of the children. After the family had lived in East Ashtabula nine years she went to Cleveland to work. None remember where she worked, and recollections of hte girl herself are vague as they have scarce. It is said that she was wild, and unlike the others. She was engaged to be married to a Cleveland man, according to gossip.\n\nOne day she came home for a visit. Julia, a younger sister, was making ready to go to school in the village, where she was to board with a family named Holdridge. That night the family sat around the fireplace. Julia was hemming a handkerchief. The family retired that night as usual, and a few hours later Jeanette called to her mother that \"Julia was very sick.\" Father and mother hurried down stairs, but the girl died before morning, almost before doctor could be called.\n\nJULIA A., daughter of A. and R. McAdms, Died Feb. 27, 1848, Aged 14 years.\n\nThis is the story told by the first of the graves.\n\nTwo years later Jeanette came home is spend the holidays. On New Year's even the family was once more gathered before the fireplace. Arthur, eating, was lying on a buffalo robe in front of the fire, his dog beside him. Suddenly he became ill, and in an instant was writhing about the floor in convulsions. A physician was called, but the boy died as suddenly as had his elder sister.\n\nAt that time Abigail was away from home. Walter, one of the younger sons, hitched up the team and brought his sister for the funeral. The white hearse made another trip, and the second chapter in the McAdams story was written in cold marble; \"Arthur, son of A. and B. McAdams, died Jan. 1, 1850. Aged 8 years.\"\n\nThe day after the funeral Abigail was helping her mother with the housework, making beds.\n\n\"Mother, did you know that Jeanette has a man's suit of clothes in her room,\" se called. The reference to the suit of clothes is obscure, but it was supposed that Jeanette was in the habit of clothing herself in them and leaving the house by her bedroom window, returning before daybreak unknown to the family. What strange errand she was bent on no one can conjecture.\n\n\"Mother, I wish I had not eaten that piece of candy that Jeanette gave me,\" she exclaimed a few hours later.\n\nThere is an uncanny tale that as she said this, she put her hand on the mantel, and that the family saw white blotches on it - a symptom of arsenic poisoning. These were her last words. Before physicians and neighbors could reach the little house back in the pine woods the oldest daughter had died. They dug a third grave, while the earth on the adjoining one was yet fresh. And the third chapter of the story was carved in the simple inscription. And after the funeral Jeanette returned to Cleveland.\n\nThe Mysterious Death Comes to Walter.\n\nShe did not make another visit until about the 10th of August, of the same year. Walter, the fourteen-year-old son, and his father were hauling staves to the dock at the harbor, when, returning home at eight, the boy complained the feeling ill. He went upstairs, his sister Jeanette following him. The boy rapidly became worse and crawled down stairs to his mother's room. She was hastily summoned from the bedside of a neighbor of whom she was taking care and doctors and neighbors were called.\n\n\"He died in great agony,\" writes Lucy M. Cook, in the Ashtabula Beacon. \"My husband helped hold him on the bed. By this time the sight of the gray team speeding towards town brought terror to all the neighborhood, for there were no telephones, and each time a member of the McAdams family was stricken someone went with all speed for Dr. Coleman of East Ashtabula.\n\nAnother marble slab was added to the row in the corner of the cemetery.\n\nJeanette returned to Cleveland, and exactly a month later paid another visit to her parents. This time Lluther, who had been playing in the street with some boys, came into the house and complained of not feeling well. His sister cared for him also, but he was seized with convulsions, and the team made another trip, and returned too late.\n\nA few days after this death the whole family went to church, and Jeanette remained at home, preparing the noonday meal. all were taken violently ill after dinner, but none died this time.\n\nAbout the first of February of the next year, 1851, Jeanette again came home from Cleveland. Her mother was in bed, suffering from a severe cold. The evening after her arrival Jeanette brought her a white powder, telling her that it was some medicine that the doctor had left for her. The mother took the powder, Jeanette went to bed, and the husband, Alexander McAdams, sat by the fire. He soon heard the woman groaning, and hurried to her side, to find her dying. It later appeared that there had been no powder left, according to the story of the doctor.\n\nBy this time there was talk of wholesale poisoning. Neighbors were terrified; nothing of the\n\nkind had ever fallen upon the community. Five of the children had died, and the mother; only three remained, with the father. They dwelt in terror, each expecting that he would be the next.\n\nA few months later, the exact time is not known, the daughter returned home again. The night of her arrival she gave her father a letter to post. The story as told now is that out of curiosity he opened it, and found to his horror that his doom had been sealed. He was to be the next, the letter told him. Plans for doing away with him were set forth. He returned to the house, terror stricken and, it is said, ordered the girl from home.\n\nThe Father Dries Jeanette Away.\n\nAt this point Jeanette disappears, save for three glimpses, most of the, however, being no more than merost rumors now\n\nIt is said that she went away, and the only time her father ever saw her again was with a band of gypsies, which camped along the creek. Seeing that she was recognized she disappeared from the camp.\n\nAnother story is that during the civil war the girl dressed in man's clothes, was a rebel spy in the union camps and hospitals.\n\nOthers say that one night a tramp came to the house and begged food. The father, setting out a lunch, is said to have recognized the daughter Jeanette, but what his attitude was no one knows. Some say he again ordered her away.\n\nAgain there are those who say that, after many years, the girl returned for a visit, saying that she was married, and lived in a distant state.\n\nWith these brief glimpses Jeanette drops out of sight.\n\nAnd there are only a few now who remember those strange happenings back in the pine woods.\n\nFOR A FULL VIEW OF THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLE, CLICK HERE (Has a hard time opening in FireFox Browser)"
