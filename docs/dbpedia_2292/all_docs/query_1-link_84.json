        "text": "To TOM & SUSAN FRENCH\n\nThis 25th Day of December 1981\n\nI hope you will enjoy this copy of your Great, Great Grandfathers book\n\nGEORGE C. (DAD) STREETER\n\nWriter of this book, was the father of\n\nMARK L. STREETER\n\nNow 83, living in Salt Lake City, Utah, is the father of;\n\nJUNE E. (STREETER) STOUT\n\nNow 63, living in Ontario, California, is the mother of;\n\nJOSEPHINE INA (CORSARO) FRENCH\n\n(yours truly)\n\nMOM\n\nMy Great Grandpa (Dad) Streeter died when I was very small. But your Grandma June and Great Grandpa Mark both tell me he is quite a storyteller and loved to exaggerate. I am sure you will see this for yourselves; along with the truth, it makes for very interesting reading. He wrote a column, on the front page of the Ogden Standard Examiner, entitled “Dad Streeter Sez: “where he used a different style of writing, you will find a concentration of these pieces from page 149 thru to the index on page 204, after which I have added a collections of this poetry. When you open these wonderful pages to the past, I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have, preparing it for you.\n\nWith All My Love,\n\nMOM\n\nAN AUTOGRAPHIC ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE AND TRAVELS OF GEO. C. (DAD) STREETER\n\nDuring the years covered by these reminiscences “Dad” lived the life of a roving cowboy, driving herds of Long Horns over the old Santa Fe trail from Mexico to Montana, horses from Oregon to Omaha, or riding the round-up in Wyoming and Montana.\n\nIn addition to his stories of the range, his accounts of bull whacking, mule skinning and stage driving, the pranking of tenderfeet and missionaries, his meeting with Cattle Kate, Calamity Jane, Butch Cassidy and Buffalo Bill, the hazards of prairie fires and blizzards, frontier justice and encounters with Indians.\n\nThe writer who now lives in Ogden, Utah has endeavored to adhere strictly to the truth, and according to the writers’ project of Nebraska is valuable contribution to the folklore of the West.\n\nMy Grandfather Streeter\n\nIn the year 1846 my Grandfather Roswell Streeter bought a large bunch of cattle in Missouri and he and three of his sons drove them into California to sell. They did so well that they drove another bunch the next year. They always night herded the main bunch and turned the work oxen, that drove on the wagon, loose to graze. One night they camped on the little flat at the mouth of Weber Canyon, as near as I can find out it was where the town of Uintah, Utah now stands. The next morning Grandfather went to bring the work cattle while the boys prepared breakfast, and when it was ready Grandfather did not put in an appearance, the boys called and yelled but received no answer. Then they ate expecting him to come most any moment, but he did not. Then they started out to look for him. They found the cattle he was looking for but saw nothing of him. Then fearing that he might be list they fired their guns, yelled, built signal fires but received no answer. They searched the river and surrounding hills for miles around but found no trace of him. Then they visited the trapper camps, one where Ogden, Utah now stands, one in Ogden Valley, one on Bear River, all the Indian camps, and all the Mormon Settlements in the surrounding country but found no trace of him.\n\nFearing to stay any longer for fear of getting snowed in in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, they at last went on to California. They disposed of their cattle at the good price and came back as far as Ogden and renewed their search for Grandfather. This time staying as long as they dared to for fear of getting snowed in in the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe next spring the brothers went with another herd and stopped at Ogden and once more renewed their search, inquiring at all the trapper cabins, Indian camps, and Mormon settlements in the Valley without success. And to this day nobody knows what became of Grandfather Streeter.\n\nTwo of the brothers I have lost track of. The oldest on A.J. Streeter invested heavily in real estate in and around St. Joe, Missouri and Streeter, Ill. (then later being named in his honor). He also owned a large sugar plantation in Mexico. He served several terms as U.S. Senator from Illinois, and in the year 1889, he received the nomination for President of the United States on the Labor ticket but lost by a very small margin. He and his associates at one time owned the controlling interest in one of the largest cattle herds in Indian Territory, (now Oklahoma) and I helped drive three different herds of their cattle north into Wyoming and Montana when that country was being stocked and did not find out until about forty years after that they owned them.\n\nCAME WEST IN A PRAIRIE SCHOONER\n\nI was born June 20, 1867, some place in the good old state of Illinois, (I don’t know what part), and when I was one year old, father put mother, my little sister and I in a prairie schooner and started West. We came to some place in Missouri and stopped for the winter. The next spring, we came on to Nebraska. Father located a homestead on Blue River near where the town of Ulysses now is, about _____ miles north of Seward City.\n\nFather started to build a house and before it was ready to move into, another baby came (a little brother), and mother named him Seward after the town of Seward, where we did out trading. I think Schooner would have been appropriate as he was born in the old prairie schooner.\n\nA great many Indians passed by going to and from their hunting grounds. They were very friendly and often came to the house to bed, and one cold day when mother was alone, except for us little ones, a party of sic of them walking into the house without knocking, or being asked, threw off their blankets and warmed themselves over the stove, and when they threw off their blankets they were entirely naked, for they have nothing else on except paint. Mother gave them something to eat and they left without doing any mischief except scaring mother almost out of her wits. The old chief said to mother as they were leaving, “Nenawa neothe issa Washtano”. Meaning “Little white squaw good”.\n\nNo wonder he called her little white squaw, for her normal weight was about ninety pounds, and less than five feet tall while he weighted about two hundred and in height not less than six feet six. And no wonder she was scared, with six of those hideously painted naked creatures, and not a neighbor within miles.\n\nFather, by using his soldier rights, was able to prove up on his land in six months, and the next spring he sold out and once more hitched the team onto the old schooner and headed west.\n\nWe finally arrived in Indianola, Nebraska, soon after the Sioux Indian massacre, when a great number of white settlers were slaughtered. The Sioux and Pawneys had a fight near the head waters of the Republican river, probably caused by a dispute over hunting ground. The Sioux were victorious and being possessed with the desire to kill, came on down the river killing everybody they came to. The people of Indianola having been warned of their coming had hastily constructed a sod wall about four feet high, enclosing a space large enough to hold all the people and their most valued possessions. The Indians finding them fortified did not attack them, but turned South about ten miles until they came to the Beaver and followed it down to the Republican and on East, I don’t know how far, killing everyone they came to.\n\nA few days after the Indian fight an old squaw came hobbling into Indianola with an arrow sticking in her back, the wound was badly fly blown, and her being weak from the loss of blood, she died as soon as the arrow was removed. She was buried in the graveyard in Indianola.\n\nThe next day, after the Indians had passed by some of the people of Indianola followed their trail to see if they could render any assistance to those, if any, that were not quite dead. They came to Mr. Tuttle’s place on the Sappe, where they found him and his eighteen children, lying dead in and around the house, and Mrs. Tuttles with a baby girl in her arms laying by the creek, a short distance from the house, neither one quite dead. The Indians has mashed the top of Mrs. Tuttles head with an axe and thought they had killed her. The baby they had taken by the feet and beat its head against a tree, and thinking it was done for, they threw it down close to its mother, who finally came too, and drawing it to her, fed it at her breast, then she managed to crawl to the creek that was about thirty feet away, and drag the baby with her where she could get a drink. The rescuers took her to Indianola where under the doctors care they finally both recovered. The girl grew up to be a fine young lady and at the age of fifteen married a young man by the name of Geo. Lang who met with a misfortune and became totally blind shortly after they were married. With such a handicap it was hard for them to keep from starvation, but their neighbors were truly kind to them and helped them in many ways. Until one day three prospects came by, on their way to the Pikes Peak, Colorado and they hired Mr. Lang to go along to watch camp while they were out prospecting. His orders were never to leave the tent while they were away. But, one bright sunny day he could distinguish the outline of a hill between him and the sun and ventured to climb a little way up the side, and when the men came, they brought him down to camp, they noticed that he had a piece of rick in his hand, they examined it, and found it to be very rich in gold. When asked where he found it, he said “I fell while I was up on the hill, and skinned my nose on it, so I picked it up and forgot to throw it down again.\n\nBy following his tracks, they found where he fell. They drove a stake there and located four claims cornering at the stake, one for each of them. A short time after Mr. Lang sold a hold interest in his claim for fifty thousand dollars when to Omaha, Nebraska and had his eyes cured. He came back to Indianola and paid everyone back double for everything had ever done for him. Then he bought a section of land built a find house on it, put a fence around it, stocked it with thoroughbred cattle, and made it a present to his mother-in-law.\n\nTUMBLE WEEDS\n\nThere was a variety of tumbleweed that grew very luxuriously on the plains, they often reached five or six feet in diameter, and were almost as round as a ball. In the fall of the year, when they ripened, their roots would let loose from the ground and the wind that almost blew constantly, would roll them across the prairie sometimes for great many miles or until they met with some obstruction.\n\nWhen many them were rolling before the wind, a long distance away, it did not require any great stretch of imagination to think they were so many Indians on horseback, riding like the wind. The settlers living in constant fear of Indian raids often would see a bunch of those weeds coming and would decide it was a band of hostile Indians. They would load their families into the wagon and drive like mad to the nearest neighbor. Then they would hitch up their team, load their family in and join the stampede, and so on until they gathered up what they thought was enough people to make a successful stand again the war party. Then they would bunch their wagons and do what they could to fortify themselves and await the attack, which often turned out to be only a scare, caused not by Indians but by tumbleweeds, which if the truth as known caused a great many of the Indian scares at the time.\n\nA PREACHER TRIES FARMING OR WHY I DON’T LIKE SORGUM OR ONIONS\n\nMy father was a Methodist preacher and at one time was assigned to take charge of a small church at Indianola, Nebraska when that country was being settled, our family arriving only one or two years later than the first pioneers, or about 1873. There was quite an influx of people at the time in answer to the advice of Horace Greeley, which was, “Go West young man and grow up with the country”.\n\nThey were mostly extremely poor people who came there to try and make a living farming in that dry arid county, which in now designed as the “Dust Bowl”. Father saw from the start that his followers would not be able to pay the preacher enough for him and family to live on, he took to farming as a sideline, and located a homestead a mile south of the General Store and Post Office of Indianola and build a two-room house on it. The material for the walls was of sod cut and turned over with the breaking plow which left it in almost endless ribbons three inches thick by twelve in width. Then they were cut up into two-foot lengths making nice square pieces which were laid up on the wall like brick, making a wall two feet thick with openings left for doors and windows. Then a log was laid from the center of one end wall to the center of another end wall, and this was called the ridge pole. Then willows were Covered with dry Buffalo grass or weeds to keep the dirt from going through, and then earth was mounded over the top.\n\nThe floor was the bare ground with the grass shaved off and tamped to make it firm to walk on. The floors were of boards cleated together and were hung with leather hinges.\n\nSome of the better to do people had sash with glass in their windows, others stretched thin cloth over the opening to keep the wind out and let light in. The walls were plastered on the inside with mud brought from the river not far away. The ceilings were of factory stretched tight and tacked to underside of the rood timbers. Such houses were warm in winter, cool in summer and typical of thousands of homes in western Nebraska and Kansas as the time.\n\nIt was a happy day for all when Father and I moved the cook stove from the covered wagon into our new home. We did not have any table, but Pa was quite a genius, he went right to work and made one. He drove four stakes in the ground all the proper height and laid the front-end gate of the wagon box on top of the stakes and when mother laid the cloth on, you would not know but what it was a beautiful table.\n\nWe did not have any chairs, so father drove four stakes on each side of the table the height of chairs and laid one on half of the back end-gate, (which was in two equal pieces) on top of the stakes on each side, making extremely comfortable benches. Mother made some nice bright colored cushions for the benches, and when complete was as Pretty as any breakfast nook to be seen in our modern houses of today I might be where the idea originated.\n\nNow it was time to plant the crop. Here was about five acres of the land that had been plowed before, by some settlers that had abandoned it before we came. Father hitched the oxen to the plow and stirred up this patch of earth. Planted part of it to garden vegetables for family use, and the balance to onions and sorghum cane, about on half to each. The onions and sorghum were to sell to buy other necessities.\n\nThen I drove the oxen on the breaking plow and turned over about two acres of sod land. This was planted to corn. Father would travel down every third furrow with an ax and at every stop, strike the ax through the sod and I went along with a bucket of corn and dropped four kernels in each hole made by the ax, and stomped it shut with my heel, until the field was all planted.\n\nThe season was favorable and we raised a wonderful crop of everything. My brother and I done the most of the work. Father tended to his pastoral duties, and worked with us at his spare time. We built a cellar in the back yard with a dirt roof in which to store our winter supply of vegetables also a building in which to store the onions. We were all well and happy, plenty of vegetables stored in the cellar corn for the oxen and cow, which were already fat, from gorging on the buffalo grass. Corn meal for mush and johnny cake, which we ground as needed with a mortar and pestle. The cow gave a bucket of milk at a time, so we had plenty of milk to drink, cream for our mush and butter for our johnny cake.\n\nMother was an expert of making butter. We also had two dozen hens that were brought along in a crate tied on the back of the wagon. They seemed to be trying to see which could lay the most eggs.\n\nThere was a great pile of buffalo chips at side of the house that us kids had gathered and piled there for winter fuel. We seemed to be enjoying the height of prosperity, and the alas, several things happened to mar our happiness.\n\nOne day father opened the onion house to see how they were keeping, and found they had heated and were starting to rot. Probably caused by lack of ventilation. Father didn’t say any cuss words, just “Well, well, that’s too bad”.\n\nHe said something had to be done quick if we saved many of the onions. So we all went to work with a will, and in about a week we had the job done, and we had saved about one half of them, but there was rotten onions scattered far and near. The chickens picked at them and it made their eggs taste like rotten onions, and the cow ate them and spoiled her milk and butter. So we didn’t have cream for our mush or butter for our johnny cake. And Father didn’t say any cuss words just, “Well, well, that’s too bad”.\n\nSo he says we’ll harvest our cane, get it made into sorghum, then we can have molasses on our johnny-cake and that won’t be so bad. He set my brother and I to stripping the leaves off the cane with sticks while we loaded some onions on the wagon and started out to find a market for them and get some barrels to put the molasses in. The store keeper at Indianola didn’t want any, so he decided to go on down the river to Arapahoe about fifty miles or two and one half days drive for the cattle. He traded his load for 12 boards, 1X12 feet long and two small barrels. The boards were afterwards used to put a floor in the bedroom by laying them flat on the ground as the was no material to be had for sleepers of joists as they are sometimes called.\n\nWhen father got home my brother and I had the cane all stripped and the seed tassels cut from the tops, and Father helped cut the stalks which had to be kept from touching the ground and piled them on some leaves of seed tassels to keep them clean. Then we loaded them on the wagon and started for a sorghum mill which was one big days drive over prairie where there was no road.\n\nAbout noon we came to a dead carcass. The Oxen stopped smelled of it, started to bellow and paw dirt on their backs then bolted and one being a little faster runner then the other, they ran in a circle, and the cane being very slippery it all lost off the wagon before father could get them stopped. Father didn’t say a cuss word, just says, “Well, well, isn’t that too bad”. He brought the team and wagon to about the center of the scattered cane, un-yoked the oxen and turned them loose to graze, while we went to work loading our cane which took until dark, then we made a dry camp for the night and arrived at the mill at noon the next day. We made a bargain with the man that owned the mill, to make molasses for half if father would drive our oxen on the sheep to grind the cane and we boys would feed the stalks between the rollers. The owner of the mill doing the boiling of the juice. We finished the next day and the following morning loaded our two barrels of molasses, and started for home. We hadn’t traveled far, when I noticed the bottom of the wagon was nearly covered with molasses. Both barrels had sprung a leak. Father didn’t cuss, he just said, “Well, well, that sure is too bad”. Then he urged the oxen to the top of their speed, (which was about three miles per hour) in an effort to get home before all the sorghum leaked out, and when we arrived we emptied one barrel into the other and had just enough to fill one barrel which we set over a washtub to catch the drip. Mother put a wash boiler of water over the fire to heat. Then soaked the empty barrel with hot water until it was tight again, then the molasses from the other barrel was poured in and also what had leaked into the tub. Father had a spigot but no auger to bore a hole for it near the bottom of the barrel. So he put a rag around it and drove it in the bung hole, then all hands rolled it down into the vegetable cellar and set it in one corner by the door where it would be handy to get at, and father says, now we will be sure of that much of our sorghum. But, he was wrong again, for in coming out after placing the barrel, the door was left open and my baby sister found her way down there and turned the spigot handle and before any of us knew it, all the sorghum in that part of the barrel above the bung hole had run out on the cellar floor and under the pile of vegetables stored there. They had to be taken out and the molasses scrubbed off and laid in the sun to dry and the cellar had to be dug about two or three inches deeper to get rid of the molasses that had soaked into the dirt floor.\n\nNow everything was ready, and we put the vegetables back in the cellar but daddy didn’t want to run any more chances of loosing the rest of the sorghum, so he had a large demijohn that he used to haul water from the river for house use, that he didn’t use for that purpose any longer, as we had recently dug a well. It held eight gallons if I remember right. He said we’ll fill that and set it in the corner of the bed room where it will be easy to watch, ( there was just enough to fill it) and it was sit in the corner by father and mother’s bed and father says that surely will be safe there, and we still have enough left for winter use, but alas daddy was wrong again, for one night not long after, there was an explosion like the firing of a gun or the bursting of a bomb. Of course everybody jumped out of bed to land halfway to their ankles in sorghum molasses. The demijohn was in a thousand, or more, pieces and molasses was all over everything in the house, even dripping from the ceiling. Our clothes, bedding and hair was smeared and poor father’s beard was matted with it. But father didn’t say any cuss words he simply said “Well, well, this surely is too bad”. We didn’t go back to bed that night, we went right to house cleaning, which lasted for several days before we could get rid of the last of the molasses. But dear old dad was wrong again, for some of the horrible stuff had went through the cracks in the floor, and soon began to mould and stench, so we had to move things out the room, take the floor up, dig the dirt out that the molasses had soaked into scrub all the boards and replace them before the molasses deal was finally finished.\n\nMother decided if we couldn’t eat eggs on account of the rotten onion flavor, we would have to eat the hens, so she cooked a nice fat one, and made corn dumplings with it but oh, horrors, nobody could stomach the rotten onion taste that it had. So there was the milk, butter, eggs, and chicken dinners “ gone with the wind”, father says we’ll have something besides vegetables to eat, so he decided to butcher the cow. She had gone dry anyway, (probably caused by eating so many onions) and she was nice and fat and would make prime beef, and enough to last us all winter.\n\nWe children all shed a few tears when Old Broch was killed for she was a family pet, but had to have something to eat. That was the day before Thanksgiving, and the next day mother planned a real Thanksgiving feast—a large roast of meat with potatoes and carrots laid around it. Sometimes we hadn’t had for years. But there was a peculiar odor that filled the house while it was cooking. Mother said she might have spilled something on the stove and in burning cause the stench.\n\nThe table was set and the roast brought on and how delicious it looked, and father, after giving thanks for the prosperous year and the man blessing that we had enjoyed, carved the roast placing a liberal helping of meat carrots and spuds on each plate. Mother took a bite and looked at father, he took a taste and I looked at the kids. I took a mouthful and my stomach heaved, and horrors of horrors, there was that old familiar taste of rotten onions. So our dinner was entirely spoiled and all we had to eat was johnny-cake straight with nothing to put on it or go with it. Still Father did not say any cuss words and like job of old, thought sorely tired, was still able to say praise the Lord, and “Well, well that surely is too bad”.\n\nWell we took the remains of old Broch and buried them out in the field, and my little sisters laid flowers on her grave. Father decided then and there to quit farming, and although this all happened over sixty years ago, still even to this day I just can’t say that I’m very crazy about either sorghum or onions.\n\nA False Alarm\n\nWhen I was a small boy at home, Father was the pastor in charge at the town of Creswell, Nebraska. And the parsonage being a long way from the church Father hitched his little teams of ponies to his democrat wagon one Sunday morning as usual and we all went to church, he and mother sat in the spring seat in front, while us children sat flat in the bottom in the back, Father was a little over six feet tall weighed 300 pounds, and dressed in his talk silk hat and Prince Albert coat, sitting upon that spring seat, with a long willow for a whip over his shoulder, looked as large if not larger then either of the ponies he was driving. Anyway, large enough to scare the devil out of most anymore, that might account for him getting so many converts. After the services were over and we were on our way home, I spied something laying by the side of the road, I jumped out and picked it up then ran caught up and got in the rig again. When we arrived home Father told us boys to unhitch, and put the horses in the barn, while the rest of the folks went to the garden back of the house to get some vegetables for dinner. And unbeknowns to anyone I ran to the house, unfastened the door and went upstairs to put away my new found treasure, which was some very nice fishing tackle, I put them in a box that I kept all my valuables in, especially those that were too large to carry in my pockets. While I was thus engaged, the rest of the family came to the front door and found it open. Mother and the girls went in, while Father thinking that the house had been robbed, (what nonsense). What would a burglar expect to find in a Methodist Preachers house worth stealing?\n\nSo he started to fasten the door just like it was. The door was made of boards up and down with cleats across, and hung on leather hinges, it had a wooden latch on the inside, with a hole near the latch large enough to put the hand through to operate it from the outside. Father in fastening the door had passed the end of a long chain through this hole in the door, then through a hole in the jamb, and as the chain was much longer then necessary he ran it through several times and as he thought fastened the two ends together with a padlock. He had just got the chain around in shape to apply the lock, when Mother heard a noise upstairs, she screamed and yelled to Father to let them out, but the door was fastened with that chain, and it took a long time for Father to unfastened it, as the hole in the jamb was not much larger then the links in the chain, and when he tried to pull it through the links would get crosswise, then he would have to put his hands through the hole in the door and untangle it. With mother screaming and pounding on the door, and the children crying at the of their voices on the inside it got him more or less frustrated, and it took much longer then it otherwise would. During this time my brother had got the commotion, he spread the alarm to the neighbors who came with shot-guns, clubs, and pitch-forks, to help capture the burglar. I had finished putting my tackle away when I heard people down stairs, and being quite bashful I decided to wait until they left, before coming down. I layed down on the floor, and the attic being very warm, I soon fell asleep. I don’t know how long I slept, but was finally awakened by the gruff voice of the sheriff, commanding who ever is up there come down or we will shoot through the floor, I crawled over the stair hole and peaked down, Mother saw me and went into hysterics, crying don’t shoot don’t shoot, then fell in a swoon. The neighbor women by applying cold clothes to her forehead, and administering smelling salts, soon brought her back to consciousness, and she said, “Oh, it’s my boy, is he all right?”\n\nI was becoming so excited by this time, that I stuck my head over the stairs hole again, and said “What’s the matter down there?\n\nEARLY SETTLEMENT OF McCOOK NEB. – 1878\n\nSince father got tired of trying to raise sorghum and onions, I didn’t have much to do so I hired out as camp mover to a man by the name of Mr. Theodore Parker who had a sheep ranch about ten miles West of Indianola, Neb. Sheep camps are little houses built on the running gears of wagons and used by the sheep herder to cook eat and sleep in. My job was to drive from one camp to another with a load of provisions, and leave about two weeks supply for each herder, hitch his camp on behind my wagon and move it to fresh pasture for the sheep, then on to another and so on around. One day while I was at the ranch a stranger called and asked Mr. Parker what he would take for his ranch.\n\nHe offered him seven hundred dollars which Mr. Parker was very glad to accept, for it was of very little value and consisted of only a squatters right to the land with no improvements except a one-room sod house and some dilapidated shearing pens.\n\nMr. Parker says we can move to another little spring about two miles down the river, build another sod cabin and have seven hundred dollars left. “ That is what I call easy money”, so we did. Then a short time after a party of surveyors came and layed out a town sight, and in less than a month lots were selling for as high as one thousand dollars each. They named the town McCook in honor of General Alexander McDowell McCook, a civil was leader. The town is now the county seat of Red Willow County, with population of between ten and fifteen thousand. Red Willow County was created and organized in the 1873 with Indianola as the county seat, which soon afterwards was moved to McCook.\n\n(Omaha World-Herald)\n\nA short time after that, Parker stopped at one of his sheep camps to spend the night, and it being very warm in the camp, he made his bed outside on the ground. In the night a skunk came and bit him through the point of his nose, from which he contracted hydrophobia and died before reaching medical assistance. His heirs came shortly after and by making other arrangements, I was left out of a job. So I went home and entered school again. My parents were very anxious to educate me for the Ministry and how well they succeeded may be judged by this biography.\n\nThe Song of My Life\n\nWhile living at Indianola, Neb. Father took the job of hauling the sand to plaster some houses that were being built there at the time, He sent me at the job, with the ox team and a big farm wagon, one day the weather was very warm, the oxen were moping alone scarcely moving and I wishing to increase their speed a little, popped the bull whip in their direction and accidentally struck the nigh ox in the eye, after unloading and starting for the sand pit again, Father came and said I will go to the sand pit with you this trip and help you load, I handed him the whip, and just then he saw the the oxe’s eye, it was badly swollen and water was running out of it and dripping off the end of his nose. He said “Is that some of your work?” I said yes, I accidentally hit him in the eye, where upon he struck at me with the loaded end of the bull whip. Luckily I dodged the blow or I might have been seriously injured. I jumped out of the back of the wagon and ran with him after me. He soon had to stop for wind but I kept on going, that night I slept in a haystack that I came to along the way.\n\nThe next day I came to a town, I went to the hotel and sat down in the guest room, I hadn’t sat long when several young ladies came in to practice singing. The first song they sang was, “ Where is my Wandering Boy Tonight” and when they had finished the tears were running down my cheeks, for I knew that was what my dear Mother was thinking at that moment. One of the young ladies came and sat down besides me, took her handkerchief and dried my tears. She asked if I had any money. I said no, then she said where is your coat and hat? I said, “ I haven’t any, this shirt and pair of overalls is all that I have in this world.” She said that a boy without money and very little clothes that cries when he hears that song must have run a way from home, she said where does your folks live?\n\nI told her, then she went and talked with the other girls and they started to take up a collection to pay my board for a while. The proprietor came in and found what they were doing. He said, “ Stop right now, I will keep this boy here for free of charge, indefinitely or until he can find work of some kind.” The young ladies spoke up almost in unison, saying we will use our money to buy him clothes. Which they did.\n\nThe proprietor of the hotel after hearing my story, sent a man to see my father, to let him now where I was. He said let him stay where he is, he will come home when them clothes he has are worn out, but I never did. I didn’t stay long at the hotel when the foreman of a nearby cattle ranch, came and hired me to ride the fall roundup fro him. Then after that I had comparative easy sailing.\n\nKilling Buffalo For The Hides, Year 1873\n\nIn the spring of 1873 while out hunting wild turkeys, father met an old army pal by the name of W. F. Cody, (who was afterwards dubbed Buffalo Bill), that he had not seen since they were mustered out of service at the close of the civil War. As they had both belonged to the Seventh Kansas Calvary, their meeting was very cordial, and they immediately formed a partnership to kill buffalo for their hides. These hides brought one dollar each if not shot through above the center of the ribs. If shot above the center they bought seventy five cents, and if shot more than once they were not worth skinning.\n\nThey built a large cart of heavy timber on some very large wheels to haul the hides on, used father’s oxen to pull it, and took me along to drive while they shot and skinned.\n\nWhen they killed one, they would put up a flag which I would drive to, and by that time they would have the hide off ready to load into the cart. My orders were never to get out of the rig as there was always plenty of good food, water, and bedding in it, and then too, they didn’t want to lose me on the prairie. All went well until on day a large buffalo bull started fighting with the oxen hitched to the cart.\n\nThe way they jumped around wasn’t slow, so I got out of the cart, (and wasn’t punished for disobeying orders either) and unlike the Casablanca that stood on the burning deck I flew. I must have a struck the ground running and ran until I fell with exhaustion or I might have been going yet. Father said they found me asleep about seven miles from the cart. Possibly the oxen had moved some in the opposite direction from which I ran. Anyway, they said they probably never would have found me had it not been for the telescope sight on their rifles.\n\nI drove team for them all summer and went to school at Indianola in the winter. My teachers name was Susie F. Meff according to some of my old report cards I still have, for the years 1876 to and including the year 1882.\n\nThe buffalo were becoming somewhat scarce owing to the terrible slaughter that had been carried on, so that wasn’t so much to be made at hunting them for their hides. Their carcasses lay bleaching on the hunters laid in wait and shot them as they came to drink. One could walk for miles stepping from one carcass to another and never have to step on the ground. Father and I worked that summer for Mr. Freese and Hooknell gathering buffalo bones and putting them in great piles along the survey of the railroad that was afterwards built from Red Cloud to Denver. We aimed to put a train load in a pile. They were afterwards shipped to the sugar refineries. We made fairly well that summer and I went to school again in the winter.\n\nThe next spring grading was started on the railroad, which created a demand for meat to feed the workers. So father and Bill went to hunting again and took me along to drive as before, only this time they not only killed for the hides but saved some of the meat, such as the hind quarters, hump, and tongues, for which there was ready sale at the railroad grading camps. By the time the buffalo had become a little wild from being hunted so much that they would run away when they saw the cart coming instead of picking a fight with my oxen, to my great relief.\n\nThe men now took saddle horses along to ride after them instead of doing all of the hunting afoot as before. During one of the trips we met a bunch of hunters that came all the way from England. Among them was gentleman who was bemoaning the fact that he hadn’t made a kill, so Bill very obligingly roped and held one while the man shot it. Of course I wasn’t suppose to tell, but as that happened a half century ago, I think it perfectly safe to mention it here. I think it showed fine sportsmanship on Bill’s part, for then the gent could go home happy, show the trophies of the hunt to his admiring friends and tell them all about the large ones that got away.\n\nFather brought a pair of little Texas ponies off a trail herd that was passing on their way to Montana and broke them to drive on a buggy. One Saturday, as there was no school, he hitched them up and started for the sand noles across the river, a few miles South of Indianola where the antelope were plentiful, to shoot one for family use as we all preferred their meat to that of buffalo. I went along to drive while he done the shooting. We had scarcely reached our prospective hunting ground, when a very dark cloud suddenly appeared in the south-west which had every appearance of being smoke from a prairie fire, common at that time of the year and greatly to be dreaded by plain people.The apparent danger was greatly increased by a stiff breeze coming from that quarter. Father took the lines from me and headed to team for home at the top of their speed, which was much too slow as that awful demon was steadily gaining on us. Father kept urging the ponies for more speed and saying if we can reach the river and plunge in before we are over-taken, we will be safe from the fire. The little ponies were making a heroic effort, but we were still at least a half mile from the river when we lost the race and was over-taken, not by prairie fire as we expected, but by a swarm of migrating grasshoppers, which devoured every green thing in their path for miles in every direction, even eating the grass roots as far down as they could reach.\n\nThe next day father hitched the ponies to the buggy and taking me along followed the course the grasshoppers were traveling to see what we could see, after traveling several miles we came to great drifts of dead ones covering the ground in some places to a depth of two feet of more. The piles were lying at right angles to the course they were traveling and extending, I don’t know how far on either side, We decided that the swarm had settled there for the night and the piles being so deep the under ones had smothered. When they started to rot in the hot sun, it caused almost an unbearable stink and a great menace to the health of the people living in what part of the country, so the settlers came for miles around with plows and scrapers and dug great ditches and buried a great many of them, others came with large racks on their wagon and hauled them home for fertilizer.\n\nA STYLISH WEDDING\n\nMy father was a Methodist Preacher and soon after the close of the Civil War was stationed at Indianola, Nebraska. While I was still a small boy at home in the 1870’s, he was called upon to perform a wedding ceremony for two of our prominent citizens. The bride to be was an old maid school mam, while the prospective bridegroom, was a well-to do old batch, so called because he owned besides his own home, six pigs, two chickens, and a cow so he decided he must have a wedding procession. As there was no livery stable in the town where he could hire a rig he borrowed father’s team of oxen and I volunteered to drive them. I curried them, gave them a bath and tied blue ribbons around their horns and tails and hitched them to the cart which resembled an old Roman Chariot. I spread some bright colored blankets over the seat and the oxen being fat from running on the green grass, made a very respectable looking turn out.\n\nThe procession formed at the home of the bride’s parents, the cart in the lead in which were seated the bridal pair, with their relatives walking behind. I drove up to the church steps and the doors were wide open a splendid view of the interior was to be seen, all decorated with yellow flowers, (which were principally wild sun flowers and cactus blossoms). Father had just arrived dressed for the occasion in his tall silk hat, white collar, Prince Albert coat, and had taken his place at the altar. The aisle leading from the front door to where father stood was lined on both sides with guest. The organ already started to play. “Here comes the Bride”, and all eyes were on her. She certainly did look swell, dressed in white with a long wedding veil. The bridegroom had alighted and was reaching both hands to assist his lady love. She had just arose from her seat, when horrors, something unlooked for happened. One of the oxen that had eaten too freely of green grass gave a hard cough, and the bride was suddenly sprayed from head to foot with something that resembled freshly prepared mustard, but which smelled a great deal worse. I expected to see her father faint and fall into her sweetheart’s arms, but she didn’t, she turned around, jumped out the other side of the rig and ran for home as fast as she could go, and left the bridegroom waiting at the church, As there was no cleaning establishments in the town the work would have to be done by hand. Father dismissed the gathering, saying the wedding would be postponed until the following Sunday.\n\nWhen the house was redecorated as before, but the oxen were not invited, everything went off smoothly until father started with the marriage ceremony. Then some small boys sitting on the front seat and thinking of what happened a few days before, started to snicker and laughter being contagious, the women started putting their handkerchiefs in their mouths and then the men stroked their beards and placed their hands in their mouths in a desperate effort to keep from laughing ,but all to no avail, it finally burst into a roar. Father finally restored order and finished the ceremony, and I believe he done a good job of tying the knot, for at last accounts they had lived happily ever after.\n\nA SAND AND SNOW BLIZZARD ON THE GREAT PLAINS\n\nWhile living on the old homestead near Indianola, Neb. in Red Willow County in the year 1874, Father went to the stable early one winter morning to feed and care for the animals as usual. While there one of those dreadful blizzards arose. They were called Dakota blizzards by the people living in that section, probably because they came from that direction. I think if the truth was known they came direct from the North Pole, for when they struck the thermometer would suddenly drop something as much as 40 to 50 degrees and the wind would blow at a terrific rate, driving the frozen snow mixed with sand and dust before it, until the air became so filled as to entirely obscure the sun and cause a semi darkness. That was where they derived the name of “black blizzards” as a great many people called them. Father started for the house and fifty feet away thinking he could walk straight for so short a distance, but he soon discovered he could not. When he opened his eyes to see he only got them filled with grit and was glad to close them again. Anyways, his eyes were of very little use to him for his range of visibility would not exceed three feet at the most. With the whirling of the storm, the pain caused by the flesh on his face and hands being out by the frozen snow and sharp grains of sands, and his lungs, eyes, nose, and mouth filled with dirt, was it any wonder that he lost all sense of direction? Still he traveled far enough to reach the house but still had missed it, he stopped and hollered for help, but the folks were all inside with the doors and windows shut tight against the storm, besides the roar of the hurricane made it impossible to hear cries. After he had yelled himself hoarse and was about to give up in despair, Mother became frightened of the storm and wondering what was keeping Father so long she opened the door a crack and yelled. To her great surprise Father answered out of the storm but not in the direction of the stables, Instead, from the opposite direction for he had passed the house. They called back and forth until Father finally reached the house and safety. Somewhat frosted but not bad frozen, he thawed out without any serious effects.\n\nTo safeguard against any of us having to contend with such a narrow escape, as soon as the storm was over, he went to town and bought 100 fifty feet of rope, enough to reach from the house to the barn. He nailed one end of it solid to one side of the kitchen door and then measured the distance to the smoke house door and tied a knot in the rope. The same procedure was followed from the kitchen door to the privy or “little Hoover” as the modern ones are often called. (Those were the days before inside plumbing). If you were bound for any of the three buildings all you had to do was to travel out to the knot you wanted or the end of the rope as the case might be. If you didn’t find the building you were looking for all you would have to do was hold the rope taut and travel in a circle and you would certainly find it. There was very little danger of getting lost unless you dropped the rope, for you could follow it back to the kitchen door.\n\nSTUNG BY BUMBLE BEES\n\nIt was a beautiful warm summer day, almost too warm, one calculated to make everyone drowsey, especially those that were working out in the sun, and I was out with an old gentle horse raking hay with a self-dumping rake, on the old homestead at Indianola, Neb., the horse was poking along with his head down, not taking any interest in what he was doing, and I was nodding and sometimes falling from the seat, when there arose a strange noise like ten thousand bumble-bees all bumbling at once. It soon dawned on me what it was. The hay rake had gathered up a large bumble-bee nest and was rolling it along with the hay, it was about the size of a large water pail, and the way they swarmed out of there, it must have been chuck full. They were all pretty angry at having their house disturbed, and were evidently bent on revenge. About one half of them settled on me, the others on the horse, and went right to work with their little redhot pokers, Then things started to happen, the horse woke up and started bucking and kicking with both feet and scarcely missing my face at every kick. And at the same time running faster then I ever saw him go before. That made the self-dump rake dump so fast that I could scarcely see the rake teeth as they flew up and down, and there was very little space between the horse flying hoofs and the flashing rake teeth. As all avenue of escape were cut off all I could do was hang to the seat of the rake for dear life, and let those angry bees wreak their vengeance on me. I could not even strike back, I was so busy riding that rake, which was bucking as bad as the horse. So those bumble-bees had clear sailing, they could sting me wherever they chose as many times as they wanted, and stay as long as they pleased. I had very little clothing on to bother them, no shoes or hat and only one very thin shirt and pants. After the bees had chase us far enough away to suit them, they went back home. I took poor old Dobin to the barn where Father applied mud packs until he finally came down to normal size. I went to bed for a few days, and also took the mud treatment, under the care of mother who was an expert nurse.\n\nAN EMBARRASSING SITUATION\n\nOnce in the 1800’s when I was about 15 years old, while riding in the sand knolls of western Nebraska, I lost my way; the sky was overcast so that I could not see the sun and there were no land marks. All the little knolls looked alike, I could not tell one direction from another. I had been riding for several hours and getting nowhere, when I saw a settler’s sod cabin away off in the distance, near Wild Horse wells in the sands hills. I went there with the intention of asking if I might stay there for the night. I knocked at the door and a woman’s voice said, “come in”. I asked if she could point the way to Clark’s Ranch on Frenchman Fork of the Republican River. She said, “yes, but it is a long way from here and it looks like a storm, you had better stay here”. I replied, “no, you point the way and I’ll be off”. Then she said, “oh, please stay, please do, I am sick, all alone, nobody within miles. My husband has gone for a doctor and won’t be back until tomorrow, so please won’t you stay?” I could not refuse anymore, so I attended to my horse and came in. The woman said, “I’m not able to get out of bed. You make yourself at home; you will find something to eat in the cupboard, make yourself some coffee and when you get sleepy you can occupy that bed in the kitchen”. I went to bed early and it seemed I had not been asleep long when I was awakened by sobs and groans. I laid and listened, but when it turned to screams I could stand it no longer. I went to the woman’s door and asked if there was anything I could do to relieve her. She said hot cloths might help. I kept her supplied with them for something but they didn’t seem to do much good. She was getting worse all the time and in her calmer moments always moaning, “why don’t they come?’ she finally got so bad that I had to hold her to keep her in bed. After while she relaxed, stopped struggling, and layed quiet. Then I thought the poor creature was dead, and no one can realize how scared I was, for up until that time I had never met death face to face. Under such peculiar circumstances I think I should be excused for shedding so many tears over a perfect stranger and one I never expected to see again. But she was so young and beautiful, with her eyes closed and her features so pleasantly relaxed that it was impossible for me to control my emotions. I stood there in a daze wondering what to do next when I heard a snuffling and snorting which finally wound up in a “a-ahh. then I knew that a little soul had come to earth and that the mother had not died as I has supposed.\n\nNow it was my turn to fret and stew and wish they would come. The way that kid was tuning up, you would think that he had an over-size pair of lungs. At any rate there was nothing wrong with the pair he had and he was surely bent on exercising them greatly to my embarrassment. I finally became aware that I was still in the land of the living and there was work to be done. So I rolled up my sleeves and went at it. Well sir, I finished that little fellow out of there, took him over to the stove, got a pan of warm water, and gave him his first bath. He evidently did not like it very well, for the more I washed the louder he yelled, just like he knew I was a stranger. He had about two feet of cord hanging to him that I hardly knew what to do with. I had seen the same thing on little calves, so long that it would tangle up around their hind legs when they ran, and we had done nothing about it. But on a baby, I had heard that it should be tied, and I suppose they meant to tie a knot in it. I knew how to tie several kinds of knots in rope such as bowline, a square know, a tomfool, a granny, and just a common hard knot. I decided a common hard knot would do, so I tied one and pulled it down hard. Then I thought that if one was good, some more might be better, so I tied the thing full of knots. I then looked around for clothes, but could not find any. perhaps just as well anyway, for I doubt if I would have known how to put them on anyway. I found a towel which I wrapped around his body, trying the two upper corners around his neck and under his chin. I laid him in his mother’s arms, after cleaning the bed up as best I could. They both went to sleep and slept so long that I went to see if they were all right. When I bent over the bed the mother did not say a word but gave me one of the sweetest smiles I have ever seen, which said plainer than words how she appreciated what I had done; and I felt well paid for my efforts.\n\nI prepared some tea and toast which she seemed to relish, even asking for the second cup of tea. I looked out the window and down the road every little while to see if I could see a team coming. Finally, I was rewarded by seeing a dust cloud a long way off, and as I watched, it drew nearer. There were two men in the rig and the horse were coming on the run; it was the Doctor and the husband and when they burst into the room they stopped short upon seeing me. The man of the house said, “Who are you?” I replied, “ I’s stranger who got lost in the knolls and came here seeking a night’s lodging.” The mother then called, showing him the baby, and giving a short explanation of what had happened. The man turned to me and said, “you were not lost but sent here by a kind Providence in answer to my prayers”. The doctor, who had been looking at the baby said, “you certainly came in handy this time; and say, is that the only knot you know how to tie? I am glad I don’t have to untie any of them”.\n\nWe all had dinner and I was preparing to go when the man asked my name. I said “Oh, I see you are looking around for a name for that new son of yours. Well, call him “Dad in remembrance of his “God-Father.” I don’t know whether they did or not for I have never seen or heard of any of them afterward. I bid them all goodby and as I rode away the father tried to thank me for what I had done, but I told him I did not deserve an thanks, that I had only done my duty.\n\nWILD HORSE WELLS\n\nWild Horse wells was a place in the sand hills north and west of Culbertson, Nebraska in Hitchcock county. There in that high dry arid country, the water was so close to the surface to the ground that the wild horse could evidently smell it. By pawing a hole in the loose sand the water would seep in enabling them to drink their fill. This process had to be repeated every time the horses wanted a drink as the hole would be drifted full of sand again be the almost constantly blowing wind. A person could travel over the place without detecting any signs of water, nor would the expect to find any within three or four hundred feet of the surface.\n\nThere were a great many wild horses in that part of the country, but the prairie being so flat made it very difficult to catch them. It was impossible to sneak up o them as they could see you coming and would start to run before you could get near them. A saddle horse carrying the extra weight of a rider and saddle was seriously handicapped, so that chasing them was not profitable and seldom indulged in. However, there was a Sioux Indian from the Rose-Bud agency in Dakota that used to come down there, who used a method that was quite novel and very successful. He started out on foot supplied only with jerked meat carried in his pockets, a canteen of water, and a lasso rope. Upon sighting the first bunch of wild ones, he would walk toward them, aiming to keep them in sight from the first day or two. Every day he would get a little closer, always keeping them on the move, which offered them very little chances to eat and no chance at all of drinking. The horses would soon become so exhausted they would lose all fear and not get very excited if he walked among them. He could then rope them, one at a time, and tie one foot up so they couldn’t touch the ground with it, which prevented them from running, but not walking. When they had rested and eaten their fill he would drive them to the nearest water, and after they drank, he would start to drive them home. It was difficult at first to drive them home. It was difficult at first to drive a bunch of horses each with one foot tied up, but as each horse gave up trying to run the Indian untied his foot and it wasn’t long before they were all loose, but nevertheless easy drive. When the Indian first began tying their feet up he selected one to break to ride, and by giving it a foot up he selected one to break to ride, and by giving it a little attention it became fairly gentle so that he could ride it and drive the others. In this unique manner he was capable of catching the entire bunch, sometimes twenty five or thirty head. I never tried this Indian’s method, but always followed the white man’s style of trying to outrun them on horseback. Some hunters tried creasing them with a bullet shot through the cords of the neck which caused a temporary paralysis of the cords and caused the head to drop so they couldn’t run. I wasn’t a good enough shot for that for if you shot a little high you would miss entirely or if a little low it would break their necks. If performed just right, however, the horse would recover. I often chased them in the Wild Horse wells vicinity, also on the Loup and Dismal rivers, but usually made a failure of it. I always used the alibi though that they were inbred and hardly worth the the trouble, which had some truth in it, although I always tried my best to catch them.\n\nSeveral years later I did much better in the Snake River country in Idaho, and on the Promontory in Utah, where the country is very rough and mountainous. There one could slip up under cover of the large rocks and surprise then on the top of a mountain. Then chase them down hill where it was usually so steep and rocky they were afraid to run and you could spur your horse upon them. If you were good enough roper you could catch one, throw and tie it. Then unsaddle your horse, turn him loose, spread your saddle on the ground roll the wild horse onto it, cinch it up, get on him, and then untie him. If you are a good rider you have acquired a horse, if not you probably will never see your saddle again to say nothing of nice long walk ahead of you.\n\nI TOOK A JOB OF HORSE TWISTING\n\nThen next spring, 1882 shortly after the last day of school, I met a “Waddy” in Indianola, looking for a bronco buster, to break ninety head of horsed to ride, and offering Five Hundred Dollars per head. I said, “stranger, don’t look any father, I’m your man”. He laughed and said he would surely get canned if he brought a kid like me to do the job of that kind as they were a tough bunch. Two of them had thrown and killed their rider at their first try. I told to go on, and if he could not find any one to take the job, to come back and get me. He said, “I’ll not be back”. But in about a week he came and hunted me up and said, “Come on kid you can have a try at it, for I hate to go back without anybody”.\n\nWe arrived at the ranch about noon the next day and found the foreman, Mr. Twist, in bed with several of his ribs broken. He explained that he had tried to ride one of the bunch and was almost killed, and advised me to go home while I was all in one piece. I told him I did not want to give up now without giving it a try. He said, “all right, I admire your nerve; who are you, how old are you and is your life insured?” to which I answered, “they call me “Dad” Streeter, I will be fourteen my next birthday or in about two months. My life insurance consists of my ability to cope with any emergency that may arise”. To which he said “bravo, and may the good angels watch over you and keep you from all harm”. I didn’t know if the man was religious or not, but that sounds like it any way and from that day we became the best of friends. (I was called “Dad “ because of my hair.)\n\nThe horses were kept in a small pasture by themselves, and after dinner some of the men drove into the corral to let me give them the once over. They were as fine a bunch of horses as I had ever seen up to that time. They were half-breed mustang and Hamiltonian and they inherited the fiery temper and almost indomitable will of both of their ancestors.\n\nThe man pointed to the horse which hurt Mr. Twist: ”say, you had better leave him to the last for he is a bad one.” I said “No, I will ride him first and now, for if I succeed I may be able to ride the rest of them.” So I caught and saddled him and the men helped drag him out in front of the house, and they rolled Mr. Twist’s bed to the window where he could watch the performance. I mounted and went into action, and after a few moments I decided that I would like a rest so I reached down and grabbed the nose piece of the hackamore with my right hand and his left ear with my left hand and by giving his neck a sudden wrench, layed him flat on his side. I sat on him for a few minutes before letting him up to complete his bucking. The men all cheered and said they never had seen that done before. The foreman said “you’ll do, kid”.\n\nI finished breaking them all in a reasonably short time, without being thrown or having any serious mishap, except that I was riding one of the horses through the sand dunes several miles from the ranch he fell with me and following a tradition of the range which was, “ if your horse falls and you don’t come clear of him in the fall, never let him up first or until you see if you are entangled in any of the trapping”, so I pulled his head up so that I was able to put the nose piece of his hackamore over the saddle horn and started to investigate, and to horror, found that in the fall my left foot had been forced through the stirrup and the horse laying on my leg, to let him up would mean certain death, but what could I do, I could not reach the latigoes to remove the saddle. While I lay there realizing that my chances of saving my life were very slim, I heard a woman’s voice calling. “stay with him, I’m coming as fast as I can”. She undid the latigoes and let the horse up, and imagine my surprise at beholding a one-legged woman. She had seen the dust, caused by the horse falling, and his struggling to get up from her house which was nearly a mile away and the only one for miles around. She threw down her crutch and came hopping on one leg to see what she could do to help. To this day, I never see a crippled woman without thinking of the one-legged one who saved my life that day.\n\nSo I received my $450.00 in cash (more money than I have ever seen before), and started for home, and by the way, I was still in one piece. Before leaving, Mr. Twist called me to his bedside, and presented me with a bill of sale of a very beautiful horse, which he said was a bonus, for being a good boy and doing my work well, and not getting hurt, and with the understanding that if I ever wanted to dispose of him to bring him to him, and if within 500 miles he would pay me for my trouble and allow me more then I could get elsewhere.\n\nThe horse’s name was “Red” and we became great pals. I taught him many tricks, such as playing dead, drinking beer from a bottle, coming to me at full speed when I blew a blast on a whistle which I always carried on my cane and many other tricks.\n\n( EATING SKUNK)\n\nShortly after going on the bronco busting expedition, there was an epidemic of croup and the best known remedy at that time was “skunk oil”. The Big Horn Drug Store which was recently established in Indianola was offering very attractive prices for skunk oil. So father went to killing skunks which were quite plentiful. He would skin them, sell their hides for fifty cents. Then mother would put the carcasses in a large kettle and try out the oil, which brought $1.00 per pound. It was quite a profitable business for a short time.\n\nDuring the height of the epidemic, I came home unannounced and found everybody away, the children at school, father away killing skunks and mother out nursing the sick, for she was an expert nurse and in constant demand. Being very hungry from my long ride in the hot sun, I immediately started looking around for something to eat. I found bread in the cupboard and a great kettle of cooked meat on the stove, so I proceeded to eat my fill, which consisted of not less than two pounds of that delicious meat, and had just finished my feast when mother came in. She was so glad to see me and asked if I had anything to eat. I told her that I filled up on that splendid meat and she threw up her hands in holy horror saying, “that is skunk that I was cooking to extract the oil”. Then I tried to throw up, but my effort were useless; it was down to stay, still I had to admit that it was good, although I have never indulged in that luxury since.\n\nWHACKING BULLS AND SKINNING MULES\n\nWhen I was fourteen years old, I thought myself quite a man and capable of shifting for myself. I was as tall and weighed as much as I do now at seventy, so I saddled my horse and rode over to Sidney, Nebraska, the town on the railroad map (UP) where the freight outfits loaded and the stage coaches started for Deadwood, a mining town in the Black Hills of Dakota, about 200 miles north and a little west of Sidney.\n\nI went to the office of the Niabrara Transportation Company and asked for a job of driving stage. They did not need a stage driver, but did need a bull whacker. So I took the job which consisted of driving 20 head of cattle hitched to a large wagon that carried 15 tons with a trailer carrying 10 ton, and sometimes a water tank on behind the trailer to furnish water for the cattle where it was far between rivers to drive in one day, and we had to make far dry camp, for 20 miles was considered a good days drive. Ten yoke of cattle and three wagons strung out behind one another, made quite a long train.\n\nThe hitch consisted of a long chain reaching from the ring in the lead teams yoke to the front axle on the lead wagon, which had to be strong enough to pull the whole load. Then there were other smaller chains about 12 feet in length from each other yokes back towards the wagon and welded where it intersected the large chain, each of the smaller short only had to be strong enough to hold what each team could pull.\n\nWhen I wanted to hitch up my team, the herder would drive the cattle up near the wagons and I would hold up the lead team’s yoke and call their names and they would take their places. Then all I had to do was lower the yoke in place, put the bows around their necks through the holes in the yokes and put in the bow keyes and so on until all ten teams were hitched ready to travel.\n\nWhen I unhitched, I pulled the bow keyed that let the bows drop, then I lowered the yoke down on the ground in front of them where it laid until I went to hitch up again. It was rather a lonesome and monotonous job, although there were always two of us; we were not much company for each other, for when I was driving, he was sleeping and when I was sleeping he was out herding the cattle.\n\nHe was a very congenial companion, much my senior and with a wealth of frontier experience. He taught me several tricks of the trade, such as greasing a loaded wagon, by removing the linch pin from the wheel you wanted greased, then if on the left side of the wagon, drive circling to the right until the wheel comes off far enough to apply your axle grease, then turn to the left, and the wheel will go back on again.\n\nAnother was to set a tire, by using a block of wood on the hub for a fulcrum and one of the wagon tongues as lever, raise the fellys from the ends of the spokes then fill the space by wrapping rope ravelongs around the tenant on the end of the spokes, which was a very good makeshift until you could reach a blacksmith shop where the job could be done right.\n\nIn the morning I would hitch up my team at the first signs of daylight and drive until 10:00 o’clock, unhitch, turn the cattle loose to graze, cook my breakfast, lay around and try to sleep until 3:00 o’clock, eat a lunch, then hitch up again and drive until dark, and sometimes after, in order to reach the next watering place. I would then unhitch my team and after cooking and eating my supper which consisted of coffee, sour dough biscuits, sow belly and beans, I would turn in to sleep until the early dawn.\n\nWhile driving, I usually walked besides the wheelers, but in slush snow, slippery mud or crossing streams, I sat on the lazy board with one end fastened firmly to the bottom of the front wagon and extending horizontally about three feet past the lower edge of the box on the left side between the wheels which made a very comfortable springy seat.\n\nI only made a few trips with the oxen, then the boss gave me a mule team, of the same number of animals and wagons. The hitch was very much the same only the mules instead of yokes, wore harnesses which consisted of collars, harness, a board saddle band and chain tugs, nothing more. The only one which wore a bridle was the nigh animal of the lead team called the jerk mule. It had a strap or small rope called jerk line with one end fastened to his bridle bit and passing through the hame of the nigh animal of each span and expending back to the front wagon. This was a line of communication between the driver and the jerk mule.\n\nIf the driver wished to turn to the right he gave the line a series of short light jerks and if to the left a steady pull, which was instantly obeyed. If more speed was required, the driver would swear and crack his whip, and if to stop, he would holler “whoa” and set the brake.\n\nA good jerk mule was always worth a good price, for he was the guiding spirit of the team and had to have a well developed brain. A common jackass could not possibly fill the bill. The jerk mule with his mate (who was guided by a jockey stick, a stout stick about three feet long), running from his halter ring to the hame ring on the jerk mule, guided the end of the long chain. All the other eight or swing teams had to do, was pull and keep on their own side of the chain. The wheeler were hitched to the wagon like any ordinary team, and guided the wagon tongue and on the night wheeler was a stock saddle for the driver to ride in when necessary or when tired of walking. To unhitch, remove the jerk mule bridle, his mate’s halter, unbuckle their hame strings and let them walk out of their harness. On the other eight teams, all you had to do, was to unbuckle the hame straps as none of their collars had straps or buckles on and were held in place by the hames. We never unhooked any tugs and always let the harness lay where the mule walked out if it until we hitched up again.\n\nDRIVING STAGE\n\nI only made one trip to Deadwood with the mule team, then one of the stage drivers quite. That left me the job that I had been waiting for which was driving from four to eight horses with lines and hitched to a concord coach. The size of the stage and the number of horses depended on number of passengers leaving Sidney, the starting point. Some of the rigs could carry twenty passengers and their baggage. Our average time was ten miles per hour, over all kinds of roads, (there were no good roads). All the driver was required to do was drive. The hitch and unhitching was done by flunkies kept at each station for that purpose, and to take care of the horses.\n\nWe drove twenty miles, changed horses, drove twenty more and changed, ate our dinner, drove back twenty miles, changed, drove 20 more to where we started from, making eight miles for a day’s drive. Our orders were, “Don’t let anybody except an officer of the law or the company ride on the boot with you. Make each station on time or expect to get fired. If a horse drops by the way, cut the tugs and go on over him, and send a man back from the next station for the harness.” We were sometimes changed from one division to another to break the monotony.\n\nOne day I had only one passenger, a large fat man who became violently seasick and I thinking fresh air might make him feel better, (although it was against the rules), I invited him to ride out on the boot with me. So he did, and all went well until we reached Break Neck Hill which was a long steep grade going down to the White River near Fort Robinson. As there was snow on the ground, I knew my brake would not do any good, so I got out to put the rough lock on, and to my horror it wasn’t there, it had probably been taken for repairs and not put back. I took the desperate chance of going down without a brake, my wheeler although a large powerful team, were not able to hold the heavy rig, although they were doing their best, we were gaining speed at every jump, and I was lashing the leaders with all my might to keep them out of the way, realizing that if the wheelers became tangled in the leaders stretchers, that would cause a pile up and likely kill both of us. My passenger not realizing that, and thinking I was doing it to scare him, made a grab for the lines and I threw them out on the horses’ backs, then he tried to take the whip away from me but that was useless, although he was much the larger and stouter, it took too much of his time and energy to keep from falling off. We reached the bottom of the hill in safety, but right at the bottom was a small stream that was partly frozen over and when the front wheels went in, instead of rolling up over the ice, they went under and held fast. We both sailed through the air for about fifty feet and I landed without any serious injury. The horses broke loose from the stage and ran straddle of a bunch of black willows and when the shock had subsided, the willow straightened partly up lifting the load team entirely off the ground. I got out my ax, which we always carried for emergencies, chopped down the willows, got the team out, hitched on to the rig again, and by driving a good run the balance of the way, reached the station on time.\n\nThe manager of the line, Mr. Crabtree, was there, and my passenger told him all about my reckless driving and swore he would never ride that line again if he didn’t fire that crazy kid that drove him in. The boss looked at him, and said, “you goggled eyed S. B. you can ride or walk, that kid is the best driver I’ve got.”\n\nThat winter was exceptionally cold and stormy, and it was almost impossible to make the horse face the blizzards that came howling down from the north. I stayed with my job until spring, then quit and started south for a warmer climate. My record showed that I had driven almost a year without being late or having a wreck that the horses could not drag in, which was considered excellent.\n\nThe next morning after I quit, I put my saddle on dear old Ned, went to the store and bought a half sack of flour, a package of soda, a slab of dry salt, sow-belt, and a little salt, a frying pan and a tight can to carry sour dough in. I filled the saddle pockets with the smaller articles, tied the others on behind my saddle, and hit the trail for Texas. I depended on my old forty-five Colts to furnish a little fresh meat along the way.\n\nI slept on the ground, rolled in the saddle blanket. I did most of the traveling in the night, and kept as much under cover in the daytime as possible on account of the roving bands of Indians, which I did not care to meet alone, for fear they might take a fancy for my scalp or horse, or maybe both. I finally reached Dodge City, Kansas without accident or mishap, and there met a trial herd of about five thousands head of cattle bound for a ranch on the Yellowstone River, near Miles City, Montana. They were short handed so I hired out to them to help complete the drive, which a very uneventful trip, and after reaching our destination, I once more put my saddle on Old Faithful and started south. When I reached the old Heart ranch on the Platte River, which had been turned into a hotel, saloon and gambling hall, and thinking I would enjoy sleeping in a real bed and eating a good meal or two, I stopped for the night. During the evening, whileing away the time watching a game of stud poker, where they were using great piles of silver dollars for chips, with plenty of gold for large bets, when a young woman walked in, gun in hand, and yelled, “Hands up everyone.” She went to the stud table and holding her apron with her left hand and with her cocked colts in her hand, raked all the money in sight into her apron, backed out the door, mounted her horse and rode away without anyone raising the least objection.\n\nI asked the bartender who she was, and he replied, “That is Cattle Kate, and I don’t blame her for what she done. She owns a little ranch west of here on the Sweet Water, where she and Jim Averel and his little kid nephew live, and old Henricks of the 71 outfit is pretty sore at them for taking up government land that he claimed as part of his range and to which he had no right or title. That tall fellow that was playing stud is her foreman, the rest of them belonged to 71 outfit. Kate’s foreman, sold a bunch of steers today and got the money and them skunks got him drunk and were fleecing him in fine style when Kate appeared on the scene. I guess she got all of her money and more, and I’m glad of it.”\n\nThe next day I traveled on and met another herd near the north boundary of Indian Territory known as the Staked Plains. It was a Prairie-dog town of about 125 miles in extent that the old Santa Fe train crossed, and the little prairie-dogs at the least sound would come out of their burrows and stand straight up on their hind parts on a little knoll besides their holes giving the whole landscape the appearance of being covered with stakes, spaced about eight or ten feet apart each way and extending as far as the eye could reach. This herd was headed for a place on the Little Missouri River near the Montana and Dakota line, I joined them and went north again. They had a young woman along they called Calamity Jane her real name was Jane Burke. She was an American Army scout and mail carrier she also served as an aid to General Custer and General Miles. She carried mail between Deadwood South Dakota and Custer Montana. She derived her peculiar appellation from a habit she had of telling some hard luck story to nearly every stranger she net, and by gaining his sympathy prevail on him to give her a few dollars to help her out of some fictitious difficulty. I confided to her one day that she wasn’t so bad if she would only cut out her drinking, swearing, lying, gambling and mooching. She was born in Prinston Mo. In1852 died in Deadwood South Dakota 1903. All was peace and quiet as we moved along, except when we came to a town then we would raise a little hell, for our own amusement, such as waking the citizens by racing our horses through the streets firing our six shooters and yelling at the top of our voices, giving a fair imitation of a band of wild Indians, we did very little real damage, and any one that tried to interfere with our fun was held face down on the ground and spanked with a pair of leather chaps or an empty cartridge belt until he promised to be good. Before leaving town our boss settled all damages, for he was an honorable man, and his patience must have been sorely tired at times.\n\nWe reached our destination late in the summer and I decided to go to school again the coming winter. As I had finished high school and had heard father and mother speak very highly of the Methodist University at York, Nebraska. I decided to go there although it was a long ride. I saddled that old Faithful pal of mine and started, hoping to reach there in time for the opening of the Winter term.\n\nI reached York, only two days before the starting of the term, which was to last six months or one hundred eighty-five calendar days, so I made my budget accordingly. I paid six months feed bill in advance for my horse, rented a room for myself, with fuel and light furnished, and where I could do my own cooking, paid six months rent and bought the following articles of food with the idea of having just enough to last until the last day of school, 185 bread tickets, 185 milk tickets good for one quart each, 100 lb. barrel of oat meal, 100 lbs. sugar, 200 lbs. potatoes and a $10.00 coupon book with which to purchase smaller articles at the store as I needed them. If the 100 lbs. of sugar seems a large amount for one schoolboy, part of it was for my horse, I visited him frequently and always took him some bread and sugar and often a bottle of beer of which he was very fond and for which he never forgot to thank me in his horse language, which by this time I was able to understand almost as well as my mother tongue.\n\nBy going to haberdashery I found what the college boys were wearing and outfitted myself with appropriate clothes which included among other things a tall silk hat, a swallow tailed coat and white spats, and when I dressed for school, the change was so marked that I doubt that my own mother could have recognized me, and I quite sure my old range pal could not. Sometimes I would look in the mirror and indulge in a good laugh at myself.\n\nSoon after my arrival, I met a building contractor by the name of Mr. Beal, and signed as an apprentice to learn the carpenter trade, with the understanding that I work for him before and after school and on Saturdays and only during winter school terms, without pay the first year, my board and room the second, and a dollar a day thereafter.\n\nI studied hard and always received high marks on my examination papers. I took part in most of the sports, and excelled in the broad jump and in wrestling, but would have nothing to do with football. It was too rough a game for me to indulge in, for up to that time I had never done anything more dangerous then fighting a mad bull, twisting a wild steer down by the horns or riding an outlaw horse, and I was afraid I would not be able to hold my own in a foot ball skirmish.\n\nEverything went smoothly until my spending money gave out, then I sold my outfit, a piece at a time, until all I had left was my horse and six shooter, and that lasted until the last day of school, with scarcely enough left to buy food along the way. So I picked up a piece of baling wire, tied one end around my horse’s neck, buckled on my six gun, got on and started for Wyoming.\n\nACTING THE TENDERFOOT\n\nMy appearance caused peals of laughter from nearly every one I met, dressed as I was in my college clothes, tall silk hat, swallow tailed coat and white spats, riding bareback on a horse with only a piece of wire around his neck, and a big six shooter strapped around my waist. They eventually took me for a real tenderfoot, a monstrosity, and escaped lunatic or one of Barnum what is it, that walked and talked just like a man, yet none could make it out.\n\nI stood it all without once loosing my temper, and finally came to the R.R ranch on the Laramie River and asked the foreman for a job, and after several minutes of uncontrollable laughter he informed me that he was full handed, and I replied that I never heard of a cow outfit being full handed, and thought they always had room for a man who could ride. Then he laughed some more and winked at the others who had gathered around and said, “Well, that is different, if you can ride, I have 20 head of horses here now that I want rode, and I’ll pay you forty dollars a month with board and five dollars extra for each horse you ride”. He of course did not expect me to be able to ride any one of them, for they were all outlaws. Afterward, some of the boys told me that he had been offering to give one or more to any man who could ride them.\n\nI took the job after the boss had agreed to loan me a saddle, as I did not have one. I turned old Ned loose to do as he pleased and was preparing to make myself at home, when pandemonium broke loose. The boys had restrained themselves as long as they could. I was too good a fun prospect to pass up, they soon over-powered me, cut one of the forks off my coat tail, threw rocks through my silk hat until there was little of it left, except the rim, and nailed my spats good and solid to the bunk house door. From the looks, they must have used all the nails and wire staples on the ranch. The boys stopped their razzing when they saw me ride on the next morning and cheered themselves hoarse when he didn’t throw me. I rode the 20 horses several times around in their turn, and at the end of the month, the boss called me to the house and paid me that he had agreed to, and said, “turn them S. B.’s out, we don’t have any use for such horses as them. I was just trying you out, to see if you could ride. You sure showed us that you could ride. You sure shows us that you could ride and here is a present for you besides.” and he gave me the nicest saddle that I have ever seen. It had a steel tree, a solid silver horn, cantle, skirt corners and conchos and was beautifully full stamped with the profile of a lady on each fender, it also had long tapaderos on the stirrups and long black haired angors goat skin anqueries on the saddle pockets. It was a saddle of which any horse twister would be very justly proud. I bid the boys goodby and again started south.\n\nI had not traveled far into Kansas, when I again met a trail herd headed for Powder River and hired out to them. We reached Culbertson, Nebraska the same day that the first passenger train arrived from the east on October 10, 1881 and as the passengers, they had several preachers who came with the avowed purpose of converting the cowboys and advertised that they would hold services that evening in an old frame saloon building that was unoccupied except for a very small post office in the corner.\n\nWe all came to the meeting at the appointed time, but in stead of going inside, we rode around the building, yelling like wild Indians and firing our six shooters through the building, always aiming high so as not to hurt anyone inside the building, and only scare them a little, which we evidently did, for when we peeked through the windows they were on their knees, and whether they were praying for the souls of the cowboys or their own salvation, I never knew.\n\nBy working in relays, we kept up the siege until daylight when our foreman stuck his head in the door and announced that there was a train leaving for the east in fifteen minutes and if they wanted to go he would give them as safe escort to it, and if not, they could stay where they were. They all went without even bidding us goodbye, and we went on with our herd and in a few days were overtaken and halted by a part of U. S. Calvary and charged with shelling a post office.\n\nThe officer in command being quite a reasonable fellow, and evidently not knowing just what to do with 25 rough neck cow pokes, and 5,000 head of cattle, so after talking for some time with out boss, he very obligingly allowed us to go on our way. After reaching our destination, I hit the back trail down through Wyoming. I came to an Indian camp on Wind River where I met Black Cole who was Chief of the Arapahoe tribe at that time and asked for something to eat. He took me to his tepee and pointed to a large kettle of oiled meat, and said “eat” and I surely did, for I had not eaten for about two days.\n\nAfter I had consumed about three pounds of it, he said “you know what you eat”. I guessed nearly everything that I could think of, to all of which he answered “no”. Then he reached out under the flap of the tepee and pulled in a large bloody dog hide, with the ears and feet on, and said “that’s what you eat, you likeum?” I said “yes I likeum” but I did not want any more, so I thanked him and went on my way.\n\nJOINED BUFFALO BILLS CIRCUS\n\nI came to the L Ranch on Medicine Creek, a tributary of the Republican River, in Nebraska, and hired out to Mr. Lion, the foreman, to ride the fall roundup, but while we were preparing to start, I got into an altercation with the bully of the outfit that ended up in a rough and tumble fight, but ended in a decided victory in my favor, thanks to my training as a wrestler. I thought the matter ended, but it wasn’t for next morning as I was saddling my horse, I was startled by the roar of six gun, close by and when I turned to see what was going on, I found that a neighbor rancher arrived just in the nick of time and knocked the bully’s gun to one side as it went off, thereby saving my life. He proceeded to beat the man into insensibility, then turned to me and said, “come with me, kid, I’ll give you a job, it might not be safe for you to hangaround here any longer.”\n\nI accepted the job with my new found friend whose name I learned was Mr. Thomas. A few days after as we were driving a bunch of cattle we met up with that same bully and he started to abuse me, then Mr. Thomas without saying a word rode up beside him, grabbed him around the neck, pulled him off his horse and gave him such a beating that I was afraid he had killed him. When he finally came to, we caught his horse loaded him on, and took him home, Mr. Thomas said, “ I guess that will teach him his range manners”.\n\nThere was no excitement until about two weeks later, when some of the boys riding along a lonesome trail after a thunder storm, came across by lightning. They took the saddle from the dead horse and took it and me to the nearest ranch, laid me out so that I would lie straight, and were keeping a death watch, when about two o’clock that night, I suddenly sat up and yelled. “Where is that black horse that I was riding?” And it was hard to say which were the worst scared they at me raising up or me at them almost tearing the house down to get out. I had no burns or marks on me and was as well as ever and went home to the ranch, where I again met Mr. Lion and he told me that he had sent his would-be bad man to the hospital for repairs, and asked me to come back and work for him, which I did.\n\nSoon after arriving at the ranch, after the roundup, we noticed a black cloud in the south which we all decided was a prairie fire coming our way with a strong breeze to help it along. Our foreman said, “we don’t need to worry, it will stop when it reaches the river”. But it didn’t the draft caused by the head fire being strong enough to draw any burning articles such as large weed stalks or buffalo chips high in the air and driven along by a strong wind, it had no difficulty in crossing the river, although it was over a half mile wide, and before we could reach it. All we could do was fight it from the sides; our outfit had their sulky (or riding) plows that they kept for such purposes, and a neighbor ranches had the same, and he worked on one side of the fire and we on the other, with the object of keeping it narrowed down and save as much of the feed for the cattle on the range as we could.\n\nWe hitched four horses on each plow and the three plows following one behind the other bared a strip of ground about three feet wide. The horses were driven almost at the top of their speed and as close to the fire to the grass along the side of the furrows nest to the main fire and with a piece of side of the furrows nest to the main fire and with a piece of blanket, old coat or large sacks, beat out the fire that might try to go the wrong way, and as each man come to where the men ahead had worked, he would mount his horse and ride ahead at full speed till he came to where he could work again. In that way we fight that fire to the Platte River, a distance of about 100 miles.\n\nI read an “ad” in a north Platte paper saying, “ wanted to buy, horses that can buck, horses that can buck, bring them to my home ranch four miles west of North Platte, Nebraska”, signed Wm. F. Cody. I had recently bought a very beautiful horse, a snow white with black mane and tail, and a disposition very much like John Whites, Strawberry Roan. As a bucker he was one of those hell, roaring, single cat varieties, you read about but very seldom see. While he had one redeeming trait, when he threw his rider he would always stop and wait for him to get up and on again, and by his looks, seemed to say, “if at first you don’t succeed, try, try again”. He was always willing to do his very best at every try.\n\nI led him over to see Mr. Cody who said, “I never buy a pig in a poke, get on and see what he can do”. After riding him, imagine my surprise at hearing Mr. Cody say that he would not give me a dollar for my horse because he did not have a man that could ride him. He also said that if I would go with the circus the next summer and ride that horse at each performance, he would pay me as much as any man in the circus. He would give me $100 for my horse, and a liberal advance on my salary with which to buy such things as I might need for myself. I said, “give me one hundred for my horse now and I will join you here in the spring”, which he did.\n\nWhen I returned from school in the spring, I found the show making ready for an early start. There were four bronc riders, Buck and Zack Taylor, (brothers), Wm. Hickok, (Wild Bill) and myself. A young man by the name of Clemens who rode his horse at full speed around the ring and threw knives and tomahocks at targets with wonderful skill, a sixteen year old girl named Annie Oakley that claimed to be the worlds champion rifle shot, Dr. Garver claimed the title at that time, but he refused to shoot with miss Oakley, and after having been challenged several times to my knowledge finally told her that he was satisfied to be called the champion gentleman, and let her be called the champion lady rifle shot. Annie used a twenty-two caliber single shot Ballard rifle. One of her pastimes was shooting the ashes from the boys cigarettes or a dime held between their thumb and finger. I didn’t smoke cigarettes or hold any dimes for her to shoot at for fear of loosing my nerve at the most critical moment and getting my fingers burned.\n\nThese were the people I lived and worked with. There were many others including a gun crew that showed an artillery practice, a bunch of Sioux Indians in the stage holdup scene, the Turks with their turbans and tall saddles, and many other workers, actors, and side show freaks. The show was very appropriately named the Wild West, for our boss encouraged us in enacting wild and woolly capers on the street with the assurance that if we were arrested disturbing the peace, he would pay our fines and all expenses. Sometimes we would go to a bank and get his saddle pockets filled with nickles and dimes and ride his horse along the main street sowing them like a farmer sows wheat, just to see the children scramble for them. Or again, he would go to a haberdashery and buy all their silk neckerchiefs and have me call in a lot of little boys from the street, hand each one a box, telling him to pick out the one he liked best for himself and tie it around his own neck and take the rest of them out on the street and every man he met give him one, saying, “ this is a present from buffalo Bill.” Such things he deemed good advertising, and I believe they were.\n\nMr. Cody always had a large American flag on a tall pole at the ranch to let his friends know when he was at home. For their accommodation he ran a free bus at regular intervals between the ranch and his saloon in North Platte with free drinks at both ends of the line. The team consisted of six elk hitched to an old Concord State Coach which was usually driven by Buck Taylor and was well patronized for Bill had many friends on such occasions.\n\nI enjoyed my work and the travel connected with it, especially the applause of the crowds. My boss was kind and generous to a fault, and would often allow us to draw money far in advance of what we had coming. That made spendthrifts of everybody and when we came home in the fall there were very few that were not indebted to Mr. Cody. Those that were, he gave work around the ranch feeding and caring for the animals during the winter.\n\nSLEEPING IN BLIZZARD WITHOUT BED OR FIRE\n\nThen I went back to Medicine Creek, Nebraska, where Mr. Lion had offered me a job for the winter. He had several large stacks of wild hay that we had saved from the prairie fire by placing fire guards around them, which consisted of plowing a circle of three or four furrows around close to the stacks, then another circle about one hundred yards father out, and burning the grass between the two which was very effective when not in the direct course of a head fire, then they were useless.\n\nHe took an outfit out to gather up some old cows or other poor cattle to bring them home and feed through the winter, a practice that had never been followed before in that part of the country. The cattle men figuring that the cattle saved by feeding did not pay the extra expense, but a great many changed their minds after the hard winter of 1886 when it was estimated that fifty percent of the cattle on the range died.\n\nWe gathered quite a large bunch and started home. As we had been out longer then we had expected our food supply was running low. The boss sent me to the home ranch with instructions to get a team of mules and buck board loaded with provisions and come back and meet the outfit at the Lone tree, a large cotton wood on the divine about half way between the Platte and Republican Rivers. As there was not another tree within miles in the direction, it made a wonderful land mark.\n\nI came to the tree, but there was no herd in sight. I unhitched and tied the mules to the back board to await their coming, then there arose one of those early snow storm which continued for several hours, then at night fall turned into a real blizzard. The temperature suddenly dropped to several degrees below zero. The wind from the north howled at the rate of 40 miles per hour driving the frozen snow before it with such force that it would cut the flesh of my face where it struck. My bed was with the cattle outfit, so I could not wrap up in that, and I had nothing to build a fire with, but luckily I had a piece of horse blanket about two feet square that was used as a seat cushion. I put it over my head for protection and ran around to keep up circulation and try to keep from freezing. I soon became exhausted and about to give up when I noticed that the snow was drifting to the leaward of the fig, and kicking it away in the deepest place I lay down on the bare ground, curled my feet up in the tails of my overcoat, put the piece of horse blanket over my head and hands, hoping that the snow would drift over me and keep me from freezing to death. I soon began to feel a warmth and drowsy feeling, which I had often heard say that people always experienced just before freezing. I pinched myself in several places and found I was not frozen but warm and soft to the touch, then I allowed myself to go to sleep.\n\nI awoke in the morning to find the snow had drifted over me to a depth of about eighteen inches, and had kept me warm. But when I crawled out in the morning the cold seemed more intense and the wind more piercing then before. I finally succeeded in getting the mule hitched, and started on the road for home, at a good brisk trot, which they seldom slackened being almost pushed along by the wind. I tried the lines to the dashboard and ran behind to keep warm, holding to the back of the buckboard, some times jumping on for a few minutes rest, then off to run again, in this way I finally reached the home ranch and safety.\n\nThe nest day the herd came in. They had taken a different route and had not come by the one tree. The boss tried to explain and apologize for leaving me ou"
