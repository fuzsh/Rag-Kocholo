Milo Andrus (1833/1853): "I heard the testimony of that man, Joseph Smith, that [an] angel came"

Milo Andrus was nineteen years old in 1833 when Joseph Smith told him the story of his first vision. The story was recorded in 1853:

I was a boy, first nineteen years of age, when I heard the testimony of that man, Joseph Smith, that [an] angel came and that glory [shone] and [the] trees seemed to be consumed in [a] blaze and he was there entrusted with this information: that darkness covered the earth, that the great mass of [the] Christian world [was] universally wrong [and] their creeds [were] all upon [an] uncertain foundation. “Now as young as you are,” [he was told], “I call upon you from this obscurity: go forth and build up my kingdom on the earth.”[1]
