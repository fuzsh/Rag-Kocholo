Milo Andrus

A brief notice a day or two since announced the death of Milo Andrus, of whose long and eventful life the following particulars have since been received from an esteemed correspondent at Oxford.

His death, which occurred at Oxford, Idaho, on June 19, 1893, was attributed to old age and general debility, he having reached the advanced age of 79 years, 3 months and 13 days. Deceased was born March 6th, 1814, at Essex county, New York; was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints April 12th, 1833, in Huron county, Ohio. He moved to Kirtland the same year, and was afterwards a member of Zion’s Camp; moved to Caldwell county, Mo., in 1837 and afterwards to Nauvoo, III., crossing the plains to Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1850.

Deceased was a president of the Tenth Quorum of Seventies, a High Priest, a member of the High Council and a Patriarch in the Church. He was president of the Liverpool conference from 1848 to 1850, filled several missions to Europe, and at one time presided over the Birmingham district in England, comprising the Birmingham, Warwickshire and Staffordshire conferences. He presided at different periods of his life over companies of Saints crossing the ocean and also crossing the plains.

He made his home the past few years of his life in Oxford, Idaho. He was a man of sterling worth, and never “flinched” from any call made upon him. He was much beloved and revered by his family and friends, and respected, and admired by his enemies, for his unswerving integrity. He leaves a numerous posterity to mourn his loss. His demise was peaceful and easy, suffering no pain. He expressed himself as being satisfied with his work on earth and his willingness and desire to join the loved throng on the “other side.” His posterity numbers 59 children, 170 grandchildren, and 75 great grandchildren.
