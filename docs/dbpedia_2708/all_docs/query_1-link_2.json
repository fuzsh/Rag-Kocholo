        "text": "Gallery label George Washington (1732-1799) was the first President of the United States (1789-1797), the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and a founding member of America's governmental system.\n\nHe was born to a wealthy Virginia family that owned a tobacco plantation. Washington received an elementary level education and as a teenager obtained his surveyor's license. He was a senior British officer in the colonial militia in the French and Indian War. He married Martha D. Custis in 1759, a marriage that produced no children but great wealth and companionship."
