        "text": "Our volunteer Docents lead guided tours for adults and are situated in the galleries on the weekends to answer questions and provide guests with a deeper understanding of the building’s rich revolutionary history. “What has been my favorite moment as a docent at the Museum?” says volunteer Rob Stio. “Was it the day I gave a quick tour for Leonardo DiCaprio? Or perhaps the first time I met a George Washington reenactor (aka “His Excellency”) and was able to question him about his life? There are so many! But I think it was my first day doing a tour for a father and his two sons who actually came back a few months later and remembered me!”\n\nOur volunteers are the face of Fraunces Tavern Museum; making sure each and every visitor has a memorable and positive visit and we hope you stop by the Museum and see for yourself!\n\nHuzzah to their hard work and dedication!\n\nInterested in becoming a volunteer? Learn more about our Volunteer Program or contact Jacqueline Masseo, Director of Education & Public Programs at 2Education@FrauncesTavernMuseum.org.\n\nDo you ever feel like going back in time? Or do you ever get bored reading about the past in history class and wish you could actually go to some places you read about? By George, I think I’ve got the place for you! My class is studying The American Revolution right now and when my mom and I read about how George Washington gave his famous farewell speech at Fraunces Tavern right here in Manhattan, we knew we just had to go see it for ourselves. So we planned a visit to Fraunces Tavern Museum. And guess what? There’s way more inside the museum than there was in my book, and in our imagination! Read the full adventure here.\n\nRead this fantastic blog post from Lynn Price, Assistant Editor at The Washington Papers, who takes us behind the scenes of the Museum's Washington's Farewell event and interviews the men behind the General himself.\n\nOn December 4, 1783, an emotional George Washington, commander in chief of the Continental army, stood before his officers in the Long Room of Fraunces Tavern in New York. “With a heart full of love and gratitude I now take leave of you,” Washington toasted, as his eyes scanned the room. “I most devoutly wish that your latter days may be as prosperous and happy as your former ones have been glorious and honorable. I cannot come to each of you but shall feel obliged if each of you will come and take me by the hand.” MORE.\n\nAny internship can be a great learning opportunity, but when you find one that combines your interests and a mission you support, the experience is invaluable. As a Communication and American Studies student, I was beyond excited to come across a marketing internship at Fraunces Tavern Museum that was an ideal fusion of both of my undergraduate majors.\n\nWorking with Mrs. Amy Kennard, Fraunces Tavern Museum’s Marketing Coordinator, my to-do list as the Museum's marketing intern varied with ongoing tasks and current projects. Each of my days began with gathering new contacts from a comment binder that guests would sign after their visit to the museum. Reading through guests’ comments was enjoyable because they clearly appreciated their visit and I was able to see the Museum's mission at work. Other ongoing tasks were maintaining a press coverage list and researching social media trends and tags for the Museum to implement on their social pages. Special projects I worked on included organizing the Museum's first marketing collateral archive, updating and building a media contact list, outlining an internal style and branding guideline, and performing media research for the Museum's popular Washington’s Farewell event.\n\nI have learned a lot during my time here at Fraunces Tavern Museum. From a marketing standpoint, I am now aware of steps and tasks to complete in order to get more awareness for a project or organization, and I have also realized the value of keeping everything very organized. Above all, interning at Fraunces Tavern has allowed me to realize that my future as a professional does not have to be monotonous or dull. It is possible to find a place that you care about enough, making it feel less like work. I have loved working with the team here at Fraunces Tavern Museum, and will always look back on this experience fondly!\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, Lower Manhattan's skyline grew taller with the proud edifices of glass and metal skyscrapers. During the day contractors dug the deep foundation pits of future financial institutions, but as the five o'clock bell rang, a handful of local residents and businessmen would scavenge these sites, searching for the treasures they knew lay hidden beneath the dirt.\n\nOften referred to as \"bottle diggers\" due to the nature of the vast majority of their finds, they would sift through dirt and partially torn down late 19th century brick buildings unearthing bottles thrown out by generations of New Yorkers dating back to the colonization of the island in the 1620s. One such bottle digger was Gifford Dieterle of Lloyd Harbor, New York. Gifford owned a company that operated out of Lower Manhattan in the 1970s and amassed a collection of bottles numbering into the hundreds that ranged from the early 19th to 21st centuries.\n\nIn early 2017 Gifford's son Tom reached out to Fraunces Tavern Museum. Gifford had recently passed and Tom was looking for a good home for the family bottle collection. Tom thought the bottles belonged back in Lower Manhattan. While Fraunces Tavern Museum was unable to receive the entirety of the collection it was fortunate to be gifted ten well preserved mallet style bottles from the 18th century.\n\nThe bottles will go on exhibit at the start of December in the famous Long Room. They will all be displayed with the other 18th century tavern-ware. The Museum is grateful for this kind gift made in memory of Gifford Dieterle."
