        "text": "Historical context After the British evacuated New York in November 1783, Washington made a triumphal entrance into the city and met with officers for the last time at Fraunces Tavern on December 4. This image shows a crowded room with flags, and Washington embracing Henry Knox in the center. This image was copied after a painting by Alonzo Chapel (1828-1887) now in the collection of the Chicago Historical Society. Chappel closely followed the nineteenth century accounts written by Schroeder and other biographers which mention a moving embrace by Washington and his officers."
