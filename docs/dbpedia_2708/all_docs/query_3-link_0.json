Manship’s papers indicate that these reliefs were designed for a projected “Hall of History,” but research has not revealed where or when that project was to appear. On December 4, 1783, George Washington said goodbye to his officers in the Long Room at Fraunces Tavern, a meeting place for the Sons of Liberty during the war."
