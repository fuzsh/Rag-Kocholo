This smart hand soap dispenser solution could then be sold to hospitals, schools or anyplace that could be more efficient by looking at a dashboard to determine which hand soap dispensers needed to be refilled, rather than having someone walk to every floor and look at each dispenser.\n\nAvnet is 100+ years old (founded in 1921), with almost 16,000 employees across 140 countries in 250+ locations. The headquarters is here in Phoenix Arizona and because Avnet’s primary customers are other businesses, you might not have heard of them…. unless you watched the Diamondbacks in the Super Bowl this past year!
