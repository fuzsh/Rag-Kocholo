        "text": "Arizona State University, ranked No. 1 “Most Innovative School” in the United States by U.S. News & World Report for nine years in succession, has forged the model for a New American University. ASU is a comprehensive public research institution, measured not by whom it excludes, but by whom it includes and how they succeed; advancing research and discovery of public value; and assuming fundamental responsibility for the economic, social, cultural and overall health of the communities it serves.\n\nASU operates on the principle that learning is a personal and original journey for each student; that they thrive on experience, and the process of discovery cannot be bound by traditional academic disciplines. Through innovation and a commitment to accessibility, ASU has drawn pioneering researchers to its faculty even as it expands opportunities for qualified students, attracting some of the highest-achieving students from all 50 states and more than 158 countries.\n\nBuilding on a legacy of excellence, ASU has rapidly enriched its research enterprise. In just 10 years, the university has more than doubled its research funding. By redefining the 21st-century university as a knowledge enterprise, ASU has inspired its faculty and students to lead discovery, most notably in space exploration, health and well-being, sustainability, energy, water and more.\n\nOur interdisciplinary, solutions-focused approach to research, entrepreneurship and economic development is centered on discovery that translates into impact and the fusion of intellectual disciplines in order to solve complex problems.\n\nASU is ranked first in the U.S. and sixth in the world by Times Higher Education for advancing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, including global impact on poverty and hunger, developing solutions for clean water and energy, and promoting gender equality."
