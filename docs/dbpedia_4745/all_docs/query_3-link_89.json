        "text": "Special Olympics Unified Champion SchoolsÂ® builds on Special Olympicsâ values, principles, practices, experiences and impacts to shape a generation that welcomes everyone.\n\nOur Goal: Schools that Welcome All People\n\nThe Special Olympics Unified Champion Schools program is aimed at promoting social inclusion through intentionally planned and implemented activities affecting systems-wide change in Kâ12 schools and across college campuses. With sports as the foundation, the three component model offers a unique combination of effective activities that equip young people with tools and training to create sports, classroom and school climates of acceptance. These are school climates where students with disabilities feel welcome and are routinely included in, and feel a part of, all activities, opportunities and functions.\n\nThis is accomplished by implementing inclusive sports, inclusive youth leadership opportunities, and whole school engagement. The program is designed to be woven into the fabric of the school, enhancing current efforts and providing rich opportunities that lead to meaningful change in creating a socially inclusive school that supports and engages all learners. What a Unified Champion School âlooks likeâ can vary greatly from school to school, based on the needs, goals, schedules and other factors unique to each school; but the basic building blocks remain the same.\n\nTogether we are creating a Unified Generation that Chooses to Include. Join us.\n\nWhere We Are\n\nCollaborators\n\nThe following list of organizations are integral collaborators and supporters to the movement of inclusive schools;\n\nU.S. Office of Special Education Programs at the U.S. Department of Education\n\nAmerican School Counselors Association (ASCA)\n\nAssociation for Middle Level Education (AMLE)\n\nBoys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA)\n\nChoose Kindness Alliance\n\nCouncil of Administrators of Special Education (CASE)\n\nCouncil of the Great City Schools\n\nESPN\n\nGoNoodle\n\nHasbro\n\nKPMG\n\nMaverik\n\nNational American Indian/Alaska Native Head Start Collaboration Office\n\nNational Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) & National Student Council (NatStuCo)\n\nNational Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA)\n\nNational Federation of State high School Associations (NFHS)\n\nNational Head Start Association\n\nNational Interscholastic Athletic Administrators Association (NIAA)\n\nNIRSA: Leaders in Collegiate Recreation\n\nPlayVS\n\nSHAPE America\n\nSigma Tau Gamma\n\nThe Daily Mile\n\nYouth Ambassadors\n\nThe Special Olympics U.S. Youth Ambassadors are a group of 28 youth leaders with and without intellectual disabilities who are striving to make the nation a more inclusive place for all. These youth leaders act as advocates, share stories, and demonstrate the values of Inclusive Youth Leadership across the country. Through training, engagement, and activation at the national level, U.S. Youth Ambassadors are strong leaders of the Inclusion Revolution.\n\nNational Education Leaders Network\n\nSpecial Olympics Unified Champion Schoolâs National Education Leaders Network (NELN) is made up of nearly two dozen leaders in special education, research, social equity, and education leadership. The NELN will work to accelerate the UCS strategy by providing insights, direction, opportunities, and access to national education conversations. This diverse network will offer refreshing outlooks and we look forward to their expertise and guidance. The leadership appointment is part of a comprehensive nomination process that occurs every three years.\n\nContact"
