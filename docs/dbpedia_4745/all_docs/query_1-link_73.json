        "text": "Open Enrollment FAQ\n\nWhat is Open Enrollment?\n\nArizona state law allows students to apply for admission to any state public school, based on available classroom space. Open Enrollment applications are approved on a year-by-year basis with no guarantee of continued enrollment. Click here to view Governing Board Policy JFB - Open Enrollment\n\nWhat is a variance?\n\nA variance is the same as an Open Enrollment.\n\nWho may apply for Open Enrollment?\n\nAny family residing in Arizona may apply for Open Enrollment into a Litchfield school. For this reason, the state is considered among the leaders in the country for educational choice.\n\nWhere do I obtain an application?\n\nOpen Enrollment applications are available at the top of this page. They are school year specific. Applications can only be submitted online.\n\nWhat are the timelines?\n\nThe Open Enrollment period begins in January during the school year prior to the year Open Enrollment is being requested. The timelines are outlined in the link below:\n\nhttps://policy.azsba.org/asba/browse/allmanuals/litchfield/JFB-R\n\nHow is approval of an Open Enrollment application determined?\n\nApproval of application first requires a determination as to the number of Open Enrollment openings (capacity) available per school. Students who have submitted application will be ranked by priority status according to District Governing Policy JFB - Open Enrollment. Selection is done by priority level. If capacity is not sufficient to enroll all pupils, they shall be selected through a random selection process. Grade level and program capacity will be considered when determining approval. Failure to notify the District of special program needs indicated on the Open Enrollment forms may necessitate a re-submission of the application for evaluation. A student requiring specialized support could be denied if the resources at the school are at capacity.\n\nHow will I be notified?\n\nParents will receive notification of their application approval, waitlist or denial before the new school year begins via email, if application is submitted by July 15th. Be sure to also check your junk folder for your email response.\n\nWhat if I miss the deadline for the application?\n\nIf the designated Open Enrollment deadline is missed, an Open Enrollment Application may still be submitted for consideration. Once available capacity is determined, application will be considered based on priority status, and parents/legal guardians will be notified. Once the campus meets or exceeds its capacity, either through Open Enrollment or population growth, the school will be closed to further Open Enrollments.\n\nWhat if my child is currently attending on Open Enrollment, do I need to reapply?\n\nAll students attending a school outside of their attendance boundary will need to apply for Open Enrollment each year. Acceptance is on a Year-by-Year basis and will be reviewed each new school year.\n\nWhat if my school attendance area undergoes a boundary change, can I stay at my same school?\n\nYou may apply for Open Enrollment to stay at your same school.\n\nMay I apply during the school year?\n\nOpen Enrollment Application may be considered during the school year for schools which have not reached capacity.\n\nIs transportation provided?\n\nDistrict transportation is not provided to Open Enrollment students. Parents are responsible for transportation to and from school in a safe and timely manner. Standards of reasonableness and prudence apply with respect to young children and supervised travel to and from school. Dropping young children off/picking up at local parks with the expectation that they will walk unsupervised to/from school is unsafe. Fee based extended day programs are available at our elementary schools to accommodate early drop off and late pick up.\n\nWhat if I have a child in first grade and one in second grade and the application is approved for the first grader and denied for the second grader? (Grade level could be any grade level example.)\n\nThe district cannot accommodate a sibling if the grade level is at or exceeds capacity when another sibling has been approved at another grade level. The family must decide if they want to have students enrolled at different schools, or decline the Open Enrollment seat in order to keep families together at one school.\n\nWhat happens if we originally resided in a LESD school’s attendance boundary and then moved outside of the school’s or the district’s attendance boundary?\n\nWhen a change in address places a pupil outside the attendance area of the pupil’s enrolled school, an application for open enrollment must be submitted within ten (10) days of the change in residence. The pupil may be admitted as a nonresident or resident transfer pupil subject to the rules set forth in this regulation. Failure to complete this process may result in the student being withdrawn at the end of ten (10) school days unless capacity would allow the student to finish the school year as stated in the enrollment priorities below.\n\nCan my child’s Open Enrollment status be revoked once granted?\n\nOpen Enrollment status is reviewed each year. Open Enrollment can be denied due to grade/program capacities, attendance/tardiness issues, or failure to follow school rules on the part of the parent or student. Each year Principals make recommendations to the Superintendent regarding these situations. Parents will receive written notification if their child’s Open Enrollment has been revoked due to these issues."
