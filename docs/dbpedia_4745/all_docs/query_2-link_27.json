        "text": "Statement on Accreditation and Approval\n\nLincoln Memorial University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award associate, baccalaureate, masters, educational specialist, and doctorate degrees. Lincoln Memorial University also may offer credentials such as certificates and diplomas at approved degree levels. Questions about the accreditation of Lincoln Memorial University may be directed in writing to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, GA 30033-4097, by calling (404) 679-4500, or by using information available on SACSCOC’s website (www.sacscoc.org). Off-campus sites owned and/or operated by Lincoln Memorial University are not individually accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools but are approved as accredited off-campus sites of the Harrogate, TN main campus. Off-campus sites' accreditation is dependent on the continued accreditation of the Lincoln Memorial University main campus in Harrogate, TN.\n\nLincoln Memorial University Duncan School of Law (LMU Law) is approved by the Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar of the American Bar Association, 321 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois 60654, 312-988-6738. LMU Law has received an acquiescence in substantive change from the Council to offer the Part-Time/Hybrid JD Program.\n\nU.S. Department of Education Professional Licensure Disclosure\n\nBecause Lincoln Memorial University Duncan School of Law is approved by the American Bar Association’s Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, the law school meets the state educational requirements for licensure in all fifty states of the United States of America, as well as the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. There are no U.S. states or territories for which the curriculum for the law school’s full-time program does not meet the state educational requirements for professional licensure or certification, nor are there any U.S. states or territories for which Lincoln Memorial University has not yet made a determination regarding whether the law school’s full-time curriculum meets the state educational requirements for professional licensure or certification.\n\nThe part-time/hybrid program exceeds the number of distance education credit hours currently permitted under the ABA Standards. Graduates of the part-time/hybrid program will satisfy most jurisdictions’ current legal education requirements and thus be eligible for admission to the bar in most states. However, Lincoln Memorial University advises all applicants to the part-time/hybrid program to check with the jurisdictions in which they may seek admission to the bar to ensure that graduation from the part-time/hybrid program will make them eligible for taking the bar exam and being admitted to the bar in those jurisdictions. Contact information for all relevant bar admissions agencies is available through the National Conference of Bar Examiners."
