        "text": "vs\n\nDear Parents,\n\nToday we are comparing University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and Whitman College (Whitman) in Washington State from real world outcomes perspectives – looking at medical and science graduate school placement as well as starting salary and mid-career earnings.\n\nThere are some big differences between the two schools and the edge for earnings by a slim margin goes to UCSD while the edge for graduate school by much larger margin goes to Whitman. The biggest trade-offs are that UCSD offers a name that is recognizable because of its link to UC system and its graduate school while Whitman focuses on undergraduate education and roughly doubles the chances of admission to graduate schools. Whitman offers much better options for undergraduates to do their own research as well. The cost of Whitman is double the cost of UCSD. UCSD is a German model research university and Whitman is an English model “West Coast Little Ivy” having formal ties to Columbia University Law School as well as 3/2 program in engineering with Fu School of Engineering.\n\nFirst, the most important things to know:\n\n1) US News rankings of colleges are deeply flawed because they do not consider “real world” outcomes such as earnings after college, graduate school placement, happiness with the institution, and quality of the social networks. Focus on real world outcomes and you may find that you have a better college fit—see notes below about earnings and graduate school placement (MD, JD, MBA, PhD).\n\n2) Double-check to see if liberal arts colleges (Whitman) or research universities (UCSD) are the right types for your particular journey\n\nthrough life including your career and/or graduate school goals. For descriptions of the six college types, you can read page 75 of my book Brand U: 4 Steps to the College of Your Dreams\n\n3) The trade-off between liberal arts and research is significant. What you are essentially giving up when you attend a liberal arts college is social prestige—the graduate research at UCSD means that everyone has heard of the school; UCSD is famous for its graduate research. Whitman, by contrast, is focused on teaching undergraduates and helping them do their own research resulting in per-capita PhD productivity that exceeds any UC except for UC Berkeley. Source NSF Bac Origins Study; see Table 4: http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf13323/\n\n4) Rankings that matter more to parents and students should include career earnings and graduate school placement. Families should consider “real world” outcomes like employer earnings, PhD science and engineering productivity and medical, law and business school placement and the people or social network that you get by attending either type of college.\n\nCOSTS OF ATTENDANCE\n\nUCSD is almost half the price of Whitman for California State residents – Whitman is $65,000 per year and UCSD runs about $35,000.\n\nCAREER EARNINGS\n\nIf you got just one degree, either from UCSD or Whitman, here is how each school stacks up in terms of producing earnings for graduates:\n\n49th – University of California – San Diego – $52,400 starting salary and\n\n$103,000 mid-career\n\n59th – Whitman College – $42,400 starting salary and $101,000 mid-career\n\nsalary\n\nThere is a negligible difference in salary at mid-career. One thing to point out: many more employers will come to UCSD. If ___ attends Whitman and looks for a job she must “pound the pavement” on her own rather than expect an employer to come to her. (source: Payscale rankings: http://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/bachelors)\n\nGRADUATE SCHOOL ADMISSION\n\nLet’s compare UCSD to Whitman for PHD sciences productivity and placement in medical school:\n\nMedical school admission rates:\n\nWhitman: tends to be at least 60%. Schools like Whitman typically have the very highest admission rates for MD admission; for example,\n\nBates College is 70% – 100% and Davidson’s is 60%\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.bates.edu/career/students/advanced-studies-graduate-and-professional-school-advising/health-professions-advising/pre-health-basics/faqs-about-pre-med-at-bates/#link1\n\nhttps://www.davidson.edu/offices/institutional-research/goals-for-student-achievement (page no longer available)\n\nUCSD: 33% accepted to MD programs. Note: among the University of California campuses, UC Berkeley has the highest admission rate to medical school – 50%.\n\nBased on my research with similar colleges, my estimate is that attending Whitman would double one’s chances of medical school, law school or\n\nbusiness school admission. For example, Whitman is the top feeder college in Washington state, not University of Washington, to University of\n\nWashington Medical School.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/46z8j6/ucsd_med_school_acceptance/?st=ivrnha88&sh=cefedaf2\n\nhttps://career.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/MedStats/Annual-Acceptance-Rates-by-Year.pdf\n\nScience PhDs:\n\nSince a PhD is the toughest thing to get in terms of time commitment and cost, it is good to look at which school— UCSD or Whitman — might give\n\nher best chance for a PhD.\n\nWhitman ranks #36, among all US colleges, for graduating students who go on to earn a PhD in the sciences. In contrast, UCSD does not place on the top 50 list.\n\n(See Table 4: http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf13323/)\n\nINTERNATIONAL GRAD SCHOOL FELLOWSHIP RANKING\n\nLooking at Fulbright rankings is also a great way to get a picture of undergraduate quality:\n\nFulbright Awards won in 2015-16. This is a one-year grant to do research overseas.\n\nWhitman: 7\n\nUCSD: 7\n\nAs you know, Whitman is not the same size as UCSD—it is about 10 times smaller so Whitman is about 10 times more successful at getting people a\n\nFulbright grant to study overseas than UCSD.\n\nSource: http://us.fulbrightonline.org/top-producing-institutions (page no longer available)\n\nRhodes Scholarships 1904-2016 – this is the toughest scholarship in the US to get — only 32 a year — grants two years at Oxford.\n\nWhitman: 5\n\nUCSD: 0\n\nIn fairness, UCSD is a much newer school than Whitman. Whitman was in existence in 1904 but UCSD came much later—in the 1960s.\n\nSource: http://seepdf.net/doc/pdf/download/www__rhodesscholar__org–assets–uploads–RS_Number%20of%20Winners%20by%20Institution_1_15_16.pdf (page no longer available)\n\nHAPPINESS WITH SCHOOL\n\nI added this category and think it is important. Since USCD is a commuter school—more than 70% do not live on campus and Whitman is a residential school with more than 70% living on campus, there are some differences in terms of how students feel about each college:\n\n64% would return to Whitman\n\n48% would return to UCSD\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.studentsreview.com/WA/WCW.html\n\nhttp://www.studentsreview.com/CA/UCLJ.html\n\n– – – – – –\n\nBy ELIZABETH OLSON, New York Times – JAN. 24, 2017\n\nMore law school graduates, laden with six-figure debt, have been questioning whether their investment in a degree that comes with such a hefty tuition price tag pays off with a highly paid job.\n\nElite institutions are generally worth the outlay, but, according to a newly released study, a few less nationally known schools also make the cut.\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin, the University of Houston and the University of Georgia were among the 10 schools offering the best salary-to-debt ratios, according to the study by SoFi, which stands for Social Finance Inc., an online student loan refinance company. They are grouped with Harvard, Yale and Stanford among the top schools that offered their graduates good value for the substantial debt they incurred while law students.\n\nSoFi rated the schools after examining salary and debt records of more than 60,000 people who applied to refinance their student loans with the San Francisco company between 2014 and 2016.\n\nA University of Texas law graduate, for example, had an average debt of $105,254 but three years after graduation earned an average $147,444, or 1.4 times the debt incurred. That is the same ratio that a Yale Law School graduate has, according to SoFi data. On average, graduates of Yale Law School, which is ranked the No. 1 law school nationally, have $123,793 in debt and earn a salary of $171,779, according to the SoFi report called “Return on Education (ROED) Law School Rankings.”\n\nThe Ivy League school offers financial aid packages, and about 60 percent of the law school’s students qualify for need-based scholarship grants, according to SoFi’s findings.\n\nTexas graduates have the advantage of low tuition costs, said Amanda Wood, SoFi’s director of business operations and strategy. The tuition is $34,000 a year, the second-lowest in-state tuition among the country’s top 20 ranked schools, according to the study. The Texas school has a national ranking of No. 15.\n\nAnother Texas school, the University of Houston, had a similar salary-to-debt ratio, Ms. Wood noted. The average graduate from that school three years out had $100,160 in debt and earned an average $136,370.\n\nOver all, typical law student loan debt is estimated to be in the low to mid six digits for private law school students, and lower for those who attended public institutions. However, no one official figure covers all law schools.\n\nThe SoFi study points out that graduates with well-paid jobs and good credit can typically refinance their student loans at a lower rate. However, refinancing with a private lender eliminates protections such as income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness for those in public service jobs.\n\nFor those seeking a great law school deal, the best may be Brigham Young University, where the average debt is $68,873 and graduates, many of whom stay and practice law in Utah, earn an average of $108,916. But not everyone can qualify. Tuition costs are exceptionally low for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but non-Mormons pay double the $12,000 annual tuition, Ms. Wood said.\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, SoFi also listed the worst law schools for salary-to-debt ratio, including Florida Coastal School of Law, Charlotte School of Law and Arizona Summit Law School, all three of which are for-profit schools owned by Infilaw Holdings, in Naples, Fla. At two schools, students ran up more than $150,000 in student debt but earned, three years after graduation, slightly over $84,000. Only Arizona Summit, which was formerly known as Phoenix School of Law, had graduates with average annual earnings of slightly over $96,000 — but that came with debt exceeding $155,000.\n\nInfilaw did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOther law schools that graduated newly minted lawyers who earned modest salaries but carried heavy debt loads — approximately 1.5 times as much as annual salary — included St. Thomas University, Appalachian School of Law, Thomas Jefferson School of Law and Elon University, SoFi found. Hefty debt means large portions of recent graduates’ paychecks go toward paying off student loans.\n\nTaking into account salary only, graduates of three prestigious law schools — Columbia University, Cornell University and New York University — earned average salaries above $175,000 three years after getting their degrees, according to SoFi’s data.\n\nThose salaries are “just one or two raises away from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ best-paid lawyer salary of $187,200,” said Ms. Wood, who also noted that the top three schools are all in New York. That finding, she said, “reinforces the idea that location matters when it comes to earning potential.”\n\nA version of this article appears in print on January 25, 2017, on Page A3 of the New York edition with the headline: State Law Schools Make the Cut for Value, a Study Says.\n\nAsk yourself if you can do anything else and if so, then do it. If you don’t have dance, then do something else and have dance as a wonderful hobby.\n\nPassion is rarely practical; one would be wise in the case of dance and the performing arts in the U.S. to think from the start of the what ifs and the what elses. What if you pour all your effort, talent, and time (and your parents’ money) into dance and then do not get offers as a performer? What if you get seriously injured and may not perform? What if you are able to perform professionally but it is not providing a living wage?\n\nThere is no harm or lack of dedication in pursuing another related area that might provide the time and income for you to continue to dance unless or until you land performing work. But if you go to college for dance, it would be discouraging (at least to your parents) to be the proverbial waiter or waitress after graduation while trying to “make it.” Consider utilizing your electives to minor in another area such as arts administration or become certified in Pilates. These could provide part-time work for you once out of school while you continue to train, audition or perform.\n\nHappily the days of professional dancers getting to retirement age and saying ”now what?” are fairly much gone. Years ago New York City Ballet started a joint program with Fordham University accommodating the dancers’ desires to get a college education while dancing. They became surprisingly practical about second careers in related or unrelated areas even as they were just joining or rising within one of the most incredible ballet companies in the world. They have set an example of practicality within their dedication for the reality of a short performing career and acknowledging there is life after leaving the stage.\n\nSo plan a parallel track. If you love to teach, great, but pursue that seriously and not just as a default – colleges and schools want strong credentials and professional experience. If you think you may love to create, study composition and music and the great works of the repertoire and get some of your fellow dancers in a studio and start creating. If you are organized, analytical and have strong leadership qualities, consider the possibilities of working within a dance or other performing arts organization in administration, development or marketing. Do an internship and see if you love to help the artists get to stage and the public to see them. Many artists work as teaching artists in the schools which is incredibly important work as dance is rarely offered in education; it can be very fulfilling and is rarely a full-time endeavor. If designing for the stage may be of interest, consider costume, lighting and scenic design study. Most schools with strong dance programs also have strong production departments. Take courses and assist the designers in production. Consider stage management and crew. Who could better call a dance performance than a stage manager who is a trained dancer? But put in the time and effort to learn it at school; it too is a serious skill acquired through effort.\n\nSeek advice from a performing arts professional, a current dance major, a professional dancer who went to college, or a college counselor specializing in the performing arts. They can discuss your goals and give you more ideas about your optimal path or paths.\n\nTake advantage of being in college. There are few other places that offer so many opportunities to experience many facets of your passion beyond performing. Start answering the what ifs and what elses with a plan.
