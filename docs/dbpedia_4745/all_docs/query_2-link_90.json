You should take this into consideration because moving often requires spending many hours outdoors. You should also be sure that air conditioning is set up in your new home before move day, especially if you're moving in the summer.\n\nHOA rules: Check ahead with any neighborhood or community rules on moving to ensure a smooth move.\n\nElevator reservation: One common and important example of something that should be handled ahead of time is reserving the building's elevator and finding out their rules for using the elevator.\n\nParking permits: Some cities require parking permits for large vehicles, find out ahead of time with your new local rules.\n\nState licensing: Though Arizona is largely an “unregulated” state, local moving companies are subject to some Arizona Department of Public Safety (AZDPS) and Department of Weights and Measures regulations intended to ensure that they operate safely and ethically. Make sure the moving company you use has a license before hiring.\n\nState regulator: You can verify a Arizona moving license and its status on the state regulator's official website.\n\nMoving permits: Arizona does not require any moving permits, but it is helpful to check local parking restrictions before moving into the state.\n\nChange of address: We recommend submitting your change of address form with USPS at least a week prior to your move. You can set an official move date on the form and this way all of your mail will get properly forwarded to Arizona. Get started here.\n\nMover's insurance: Every state has their own requirements when it comes to insurance. Choose Released Value Protection for its cost-effectiveness—offered by movers at no extra charge, although it provides minimal coverage. With a liability limit of 60 cents per pound per article, consider this option carefully. For instance, if a 50-inch TV weighing 25 pounds is lost or damaged, your reimbursement would only be $15 (60 cents x 25 pounds). For comprehensive coverage of your items' full value, consult with your moving company for alternative options or consider third-party insurance providers.\n\nMoving checklist: Peace of mind is priceless.
