        "text": "Grade point average (GPA) is the cumulative average of your final grades throughout high school. A 2.6 GPA is the equivalent of a B- average and indicates a level of accomplishment in all completed classes so far.\n\nIs a 2.6 GPA Good?\n\nA 2.6 GPA is generally considered alright. A grade of B or higher indicates that all of the class material was understood and could successfully be applied on homework and tests, which is definitely something that colleges are looking for. However, it’s important to remember that the national average for graduating high school students is 3.0 and most colleges also use that number as an unofficial benchmark for a competitive application. So, while a student with a 2.6 GPA is eligible to apply at most colleges, it isn’t the sort of GPA that can competitively expect admission.\n\nWhat Colleges Can I Apply to With a 2.6 GPA?\n\nThere are colleges that accept students with a 2.6 GPA, and we’ve assembled a list of them below. This doesn’t mean that there’s automatic acceptance based on GPA alone, but each of these colleges and universities has a history of admitting students with a GPA in the 2.6-2.7 range.\n\nFor freshmen and sophomores, remember that a 2.6 GPA isn’t out of reach of the competitive 3.0 benchmark for colleges and universities. Aiming for a 3.0 GPA by college application season is an excellent (and very realistic) goal. Start by concentrating on classes that you’re struggling with the most and try to get them all to a straight B grade. By establishing a new, slightly higher baseline for your grades, your 2.6 GPA will be at that competitive 3.0 level in no time.\n\nIf you’re a junior and want to make yourself as competitive a candidate for college admission as possible, you’ll need to make the most of the two semesters before application season. Meet with teachers or counselors to determine the best course of action and understand that it’ll be a solid year of intense work, but the kind that’s worth it. Your odds of acceptance at colleges and universities you love will go way up!\n\nAs for seniors, it’s hard to raise your GPA in your senior year, especially if the college or university you’re interested in has an earlier application deadline. If the deadline extends into the January to March range, though, there’s a chance you can increase your GPA by a tenth or two during the first semester of your senior year, improving your odds of acceptance. Even if that doesn’t work out, don’t lose hope. There are a number of colleges that accept a 2.6 GPA, especially when you put together a stellar application packet.\n\nIf you want to put yourself in a better position to receive more merit aid, there’s always the option of attending a community college for 2 years. After establishing a good GPA, you can transfer to your ideal 4-year college or university—although be sure to consult the school’s articulation agreement policy first.\n\nWhat Are Colleges Looking At Other Than a 2.6 High School GPA?\n\nNumbers like your GPA and standardized test scores give colleges a snapshot of your academic performance, but that’s not the only deciding factor when it comes to getting admitted to a college. They want to view you holistically as a person, so make sure to include your passions, hobbies, and interests in your college application. Include as many of the following as possible to give a complete view of yourself:\n\nSAT Scores / ACT Scores\n\nExtracurricular/After-school activities\n\nYour Sports\n\nApplication Essays\n\nVolunteer Work / Community Service\n\nJobs / Internships / Special Projects\n\nFAFSA\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs a 2.6 GPA in high school considered good?\n\nA 2.6 GPA means that you’ve earned an average of a B- in all of your high school classes — it’s not a bad GPA! Know that it doesn’t make you competitive for college applications, though. The average GPA for graduating high school students is 3.0, so it’s ideal to get as close to that GPA as possible to make you eligible to apply at more colleges.\n\nWhat colleges can I get into with a 2.6 GPA?\n\nThere are a number of colleges you can apply to, so be sure to thoroughly consider all options. Among those, you can consider Lincoln University, New England College, and Coppin State University since all three accept students with an average GPA of 2.6!\n\nWhat percentile is a 2.6 GPA?\n\nA 2.6 GPA equates to 81%, or B-.\n\nWhat scholarships can you get with a 2.6 GPA?\n\nWhile there are some scholarships that require GPA and often ask for a 3.0 are higher, there are a number that only require a 2.5 GPA. Outside of that, though, there are many scholarships that don’t have GPA requirements. Start looking through our database based on your interests and passions, like sports of extracurriculars, and apply for as many as possible! Even small amounts earned can really help offset the cost of tuition.\n\nView All Scholarships\n\nFresno City College is a two-year community college with an open admissions policy.
