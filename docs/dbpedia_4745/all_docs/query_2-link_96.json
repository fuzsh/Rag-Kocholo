Meanwhile, more than 100,000 Americans died of an overdose last year.\n\nWatch and Listen: Opioid Settlement Case Triggers Protests Outside the High Court\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments over whether the Sacklers, the family behind Purdue Pharma — which marketed OxyContin — could claim immunity from future lawsuits without claiming bankruptcy.\n\nGubernatorial Candidates Quarrel Over Glory for Winning Opioid Settlements\n\nSome gubernatorial candidates are sparring over bragging rights for their state’s share of $50 billion in opioid settlement funds.

Using the funds for law enforcement has triggered important questions about what the money was meant for.\n\nRepeating History: California County Plugs Budget Gap With Opioid Settlement Cash\n\nState attorneys general vowed that opioid settlement funds — unlike the tobacco settlement of the 1990s — would go toward tackling the underlying crisis.

But others worry this overlooks rural communities disproportionately harmed by opioid addiction.\n\nSchools, Sheriffs, and Syringes: State Plans Vary for Spending $26B in Opioid Settlement Funds\n\nThe cash represents an unprecedented opportunity to derail the opioid epidemic, but with countless groups advocating for their share of the pie, the impact could depend heavily on geography and politics.\n\nThe Player-Coaches of Addiction Recovery Work Without Boundaries\n\nStates, tribes, and local governments are figuring out how best to spend billions of dollars from an opioid lawsuit settlement.
