        "text": "TAXPAYERS, LOWER YOUR TAXES AND SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS!\n\nTAX CREDIT: HOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nA Tax Credit, which is the dollar-for dollar reduction of your tax liability, is better than a tax deduction, which only reduces your taxable income before taxes are computed.\n\nInstead of sending all your state taxes to the State of Arizona, you can make a contribution to a public school. A.R.S. §43-1089.01 allows taxpayers a TAX CREDIT up to $200.00 for “Single” or “Head of Household” tax filers and up to $400.00 for “Married Couple Filing a Joint Return” when contributing to EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES in public schools. This gives you the opportunity to help your local school. The tax credit is available to all taxpayers, regardless of whether they have children in school. It would be advisable to consult your tax advisor regarding your specific tax status.\n\nWhat is an EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY?\n\nExtracurricular activity means any optional, non-credit educational or competitive school sponsored activity that supplements the education program of the school. Activities such as sports, visual and performing arts, field trips, outdoor education or character education programs can be funded with tax credit money. Extracurricular activities do not include any events that are recreational, amusement or tourist activities.\n\nWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\n\nYou may select which school and which program you would like to support. The amount of the tax credit you take does not have to be for the total allowance. You can make a difference in our schools with just $50.00, $75.00, or $100.00. In addition, the credit may be split between one or more schools and/or one or more programs.\n\nHOW CAN I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TAX CREDIT? UPDATE\n\nComplete the attached form and return to the school of your choice by April 15, 2020 or mail to the District Office prior to April 15, 2020 in order to take it off your State of Arizona taxes at the time you file for 2019. Arizona Tax Credit Donation Form\n\nCreate an online payment by going to this link\n\nIt is easy! The District will provide you with a receipt verifying that you have contributed to an eligible extracurricular activity.\n\nFor more information contact Wendy Taylor at the District Office, 623-535-6000.\n\nWhen you provide a check as payment, you authorize the Litchfield Elementary School District (LESD) either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction"
