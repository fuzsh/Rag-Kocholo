        "text": "Four universities announced today that they will collaborate in the 2019–20 school year using design thinking methodologies to explore new ways to meet the needs of human trafficking survivors.\n\nStudents and faculty from the law schools at the University of Arizona, University of San Diego, Duke University and Harvard University are partnering to explore new legal solutions, conduct in-depth research and develop community resources and possible policy changes to support human trafficking survivors.\n\nHuman trafficking is the business of stealing freedom for profit by means of force, fraud or coercion for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation or forced labor. The second largest criminal industry in the world, human trafficking has been reported in all 50 states in the U.S. Victims of human trafficking include foreign nationals and U.S. citizens, adults and minors, and all genders and identities. This collaboration will engage students from multiple disciplines across the country in understanding the needs of the human trafficking survivors in their communities and applying innovative problem-solving skills to meeting those needs.\n\nThe programs and initiatives participating in this project are located in states with high rates of human trafficking. According to statistics provided by the National Trafficking Hotline, in 2017 North Carolina was sixth in the nation for reported cases, Arizona was 10th, and Massachusetts was in the top half. Research conducted in San Diego in 2016 estimated the number of commercially sexually exploited persons in San Diego County ranges from 3,417–8,108 per year, and that law enforcement only arrests 15–20% of the persons committing trafficking offenses.\n\nEach organization participating in this unique, multi-jurisdictional collaboration brings specialized expertise to this project.\n\nThe Innovation for Justice Program (i4J) at the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law launched in 2018 to provide project-based, community-engaged learning opportunities to interdisciplinary teams of graduate and undergraduate students. i4J applies a design- and systems-thinking framework to social justice challenges, and teams of students produce deliverables created with and for the community. In 2018–19, i4J tackled the issue of eviction, and students created hellolandlord.org, a bilingual, jurisdiction-agnostic, web-based tool designed to facilitate communication between tenants and landlords.\n\nThe University of San Diego (USD) has an established track record of achieving systemic change through policy advocacy for nearly 40 years. With respect to human trafficking research and advocacy, USD School of Law faculty utilized research developed by USD’s Kroc School of Peace Studies estimating sex trafficking victimization in San Diego to support a series of legislative reforms in California. Specifically, USD's advocacy in this area has led to new laws mandating enhanced training to all levels of the school community; changing the mandatory reporting laws for teachers, nurses, and social workers; and developing programs such as the RISE Court, a special juvenile court created specifically to work with child victims of sex trafficking and address the unique issues they face.\n\nDuke Law By Design is an initiative of the Duke Center on Law & Technology which aims to infuse design thinking into law school curriculum. Past courses and workshops led by faculty and staff trained in design thinking facilitation have covered topics such as eviction, beyond the billable hour, access to justice, mass incarceration, forensic reports, and open access to legal information.\n\nThe Systemic Justice Project (“SJP”) at Harvard Law School is a policy innovation collaboration, organized and catalyzed by HLS students devoted to identifying injustice, designing solutions, promoting awareness, and advocating reforms to policymakers, opinion leaders, and the public. While targeting specific policy challenges, SJP is devoted to understanding common and systemic sources of injustice by analyzing the historical, cultural, political, economic, and psychological context of particular problems. Toward that end, SJP is committed to collaborating with scholars, lawyers, lawmakers, and citizens and to working with existing institutions in promoting attainable, pragmatic, and lasting policy solutions.\n\nJamie Beck, president and managing attorney of Free to Thrive, will join the collaboration as a community partner. Free to Thrive is a San Diego based nonprofit organization that provides legal services and connections to other support to human trafficking survivors.\n\nStudents in the USD and University of Arizona classes will apply a design- and systems-thinking approach to understanding the challenges that human trafficking survivors experience by engaging with a diverse array of stakeholders this fall. They will work with fellow students via video conference and use collaboration tools such as Google Docs and Slack to share research insights between classrooms. Students at Duke will highlight the needs of human trafficking survivors at a community workshop that builds upon the work of USD and Arizona and contributes additional community-based research to the collaboration. In spring 2020, the work accomplished by the students at USD, Arizona and Duke in the fall will be shared with Justice Lab students at Harvard Law School’s Systemic Justice Project, where students can consider policy-level changes targeting the needs of human trafficking survivors.\n\n“We selected this challenge because human trafficking is a deeply inhumane problem that reaches across so many different systems in our society,” said Stacy Rupprecht Jane, director of Arizona’s Innovation for Justice Program. “While much is being done to prevent human trafficking, as long as it exists, we have survivors trying to navigate numerous barriers: overcome trauma, obtain housing and employment, locate and receive medical care and education, and navigate criminal and civil legal issues. We have an opportunity to engage a team of talented graduate students and four excellent institutions in thinking creatively about how those barriers could be alleviated.”\n\n“We are thrilled to partner not only with the other universities but also local community-based coalitions who currently lead efforts against trafficking in North Carolina,” said Kelli Raker, program coordinator at the Duke Center on Law & Technology. “Through a design-thinking process where we center survivors of human trafficking, we aim to connect community leaders with an innovative, interdisciplinary group of students in law, social work, public policy and public health.”\n\n“The Center for Public Interest Law and the Children’s Advocacy Institute at the University of San Diego School of Law use dynamic clinical experiences to engage students in using the law to create social change,” said Jessica Heldman, professor in residence in child rights at the USD School of Law. “The human trafficking challenge provides these students a meaningful opportunity to develop a deep understanding of and empathy for those who have experienced human trafficking and those who work to meet the needs of victims and survivors. We are pleased to join with academic and community partners in taking on the challenge of turning understanding and empathy into action, positively impacting individuals within our communities.”\n\nIn Tucson, i4J will launch the human trafficking challenge with a community-led workshop on Aug. 23. The University of San Diego will build upon the substantial anti-human trafficking efforts already established in San Diego County, sharing the outcomes of the fall class with both the San Diego community as well as a campus-wide summit to be held at USD in January of 2020.\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nUniversity of Arizona Law\n\nTracy Mueller, assistant dean, external communications and marketing\n\ntracymueller@email.arizona.edu\n\n520-621-1563\n\nStacy Rupprecht Jane, director, Innovation for Justice\n\nstacybutler@email.arizona.edu\n\n520-621-3002\n\nFor more information about University of Arizona Law, visit law.arizona.edu and follow @uarizonalaw on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.\n\nFor more information about Duke Law By Design, visit law.duke.edu/dclt/design and follow @DukeLawTech on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nFor more information about University of San Diego School of law, visit sandiego.edu/law.

CPIL focuses its efforts on the study of an extremely powerful, yet often overlooked, level of government: state regulatory agencies. Under the supervision of experienced public interest attorneys and advocates, CPIL law student interns study California agencies that regulate business, professions, and trades.\n\nCPIL publishes the California Regulatory Law Reporter, a unique legal journal that covers the activities and decisions of over 12 major California regulatory agencies.\n\nIn addition to its academic program, CPIL has an advocacy component. Center faculty, professional staff, and interns represent the interests of the unorganized and underrepresented in California’s legislature, courts, and regulatory agencies. CPIL attempts to make the regulatory functions of California government more efficient and visible by serving as a public monitor of state regulatory activity. The Center has been particularly active in reforming the state’s professional discipline systems for attorneys and physicians, and in advocating public interest reforms to the state’s open meetings and public records statutes.\n\nAbout the Children’s Advocacy Institute: The Children’s Advocacy Institute (CAI), founded at the nonprofit University of San Diego School of Law in 1989, is one of the nation's premiere academic, research, and advocacy organizations working to improve the lives of children and youth, with special emphasis on improving the child protection and foster care systems and enhancing resources that are available to youth aging out of foster care.\n\nIn its academic component, CAI trains law students and attorneys to be effective child advocates throughout their legal careers. Its Child Advocacy Clinic gives USD Law students three distinct clinical opportunities to advocate on behalf of children and youth, and its Dependency Counsel Training Program provides comprehensive training to licensed attorneys engaged in or contemplating Dependency Court practice.\n\nCAI's research and advocacy component, conducted through its offices in San Diego, Sacramento, and Washington, D.C., seeks to leverage change for children and youth through impact litigation, regulatory and legislative advocacy, and public education. Active primarily at the federal and state levels, CAI's efforts are multi-faceted—comprehensively and successfully embracing all tools of public interest advocacy to improve the lives of children and youth.
