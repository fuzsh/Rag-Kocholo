Soon as I arrived to my hotel I was greeted by this amazing gentlemen name FRANK MAGUIRE who works for the valet, I arrived in a Lyft and he immediately opened my door and grab my luggages out of the trunk of the lyftâ€™s car before the driver could. He greeted me with an amazing smile , and very good high energy. It was like we met before in another life, we were already joking and laughing with one another just after secs on meeting. I explained to FRANK that I was from SF area and I was by myself here and needed some cool things to do. He immediately got on his phone and made some calls and asked me to get settled and come back down. When I came back down he had my entire 5 days mapped out and planned for me. The whole entire time I was there he checked on me and made sure I was doing okay and was making very good interactions with others during my stay. The best part was he got me into the pool party at the W HOTEL!!! Frank went beyond and above to make sure my time in ARIZONA was memorable and it ABSOLUTELY WAS!!! THANK YOU FRANK!!!\n\nShow More\n\n4.2/5\n\nVery Good\n\nGGuest UserThe hotel itself is quite nice if you are fortunate to be there when it isn't overrun with totally unruly children. It is centrally located which is good as all the attractions in town are spread out in a circle. Overall, we were pleased upon arrival, but that opinion soon changed. Check-in was quick. We are spire elite priority club members and were given the first floor room we had requested ( a suite to boot ) and on the back side of the hotel away from the street noise, on the courtyard, right by the pool and by the laundry and ice. Very convenient. Unfortunately, the ice by our room was out of order and we had to go a long way, and it was a bit of a walk from the lobby and restaurant. There was a lot of pool noise in the living room area until bedtime, but at least we couldn't hear any noise in the bedroom. Hotel was a free for all for children. NO peace and quiet here which is what I had been looking forward to, to sit out in the courtyard and enjoy the weather. Unfortunately, that was impossible. When our children were young we received MANY compliments from strangers telling us that our children were the most well behaved they have ever come across. Exact opposite here. Was unable to use the pool or hot tub at all. I am handicapped and could have received benefit from the pool and hot tub both. Couldn't use either because all were full of UNRULY children who were even eating in the pool and hot tub. Couldn't even hardly get down the sidewalk to my room as children were running out in front of people, throwing balls everywhere, nearly hitting people and causing them to fall down. Parents, staff, no one did anything. Finally, on the last night of our stay, some peace and could sit out on a lounge in reasonable quiet. We did not hear any noise from adjacent rooms or from above. Suite was very spacious, had a comfortable living room area with computer desk and adequate luggage area in the bedroom. Had a kitchenette area, but unfortunately miserable one cup coffee machine which made making a pitcher of tea take hours. The sink was outside the bathroom and had adequate space for your toiletries, but didn't have a towel bar for hand towels or bright enough lighting to apply make-up. Big issue was that the hook was inside the bathroom door and desperately needed to be on the outside of the door so you could use it by the sink. Could not figure out how to set the clock in the room. Bed was comfortable. Internet connected quickly but was a little slow at times. Priority club members didn't nee to use password. First time I had encountered that, and not sure how the system knew. There was no maid service but if requested they delivered fresh towels to your room. We left the trash by the front door and they emptied that too. At beginning of our stay, they left plenty of towels and paper products. At end of stay, only left a couple of towels, so we had to go to the desk and all they had to give out were bathmats. Unfort\n\nShow More"
