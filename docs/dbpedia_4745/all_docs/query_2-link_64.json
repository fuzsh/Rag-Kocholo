        "text": "Whether you want to start a new venture, switch careers, or advance in your current organization, Babson’s one- or two-year MBA program will help you get there. Both options feature MBA classes that will arm you with the #1 ranked MBA for entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial leadership skills needed to make an impact in business, in your community, and around the world.\n\n“Business as Usual” Has No Business Here\n\nAt many top institutions, lectures don’t move past the lectern. But, at Babson, the leading entrepreneurship college, our professors are practitioners. Each year, more than 80 partner organizations bring their real-world challenges to class, providing you with a wide range of consulting opportunities. You’ll meet with established business leaders locally and abroad, all while workshoping your startups in the classroom.\n\nWhen you graduate, you not only have an expanded network of high-performing peers from around the world, but you also have tangible examples of problems you’ve solved for real organizations thanks to our MBA classes and Babson’s top-ranked entrepreneurial curriculum. Whether you want to launch a startup, take a family business into the next generation, or innovate within the world’s largest companies, you can apply your entrepreneurial mindset to manage risk, navigate uncertainty, and explore ambiguity.\n\nBabson MBA Curriculum\n\nThe Babson MBA is 45 credits whether you opt to complete it in one or two years. All full time MBA students earn their first 15 credits via the nine core courses, including real-world learning. One-year MBA students complete the program in 12 months, while two-year MBA students earn their MBA in 21 months.\n\nThe rest of your full time Boston MBA program consists of electives. Choose the MBA classes that appeal to you, or select your MBA classes from seven concentrations and intensity tracks, with additional experiential learning opportunities, all to enable you to focus on areas of interest. Our small size means that students, faculty, and career advisors co-create a tailored experience that helps each student achieve their professional goals.\n\nFour Learning Goals\n\nBabson’s Entrepreneurial Thought & Action® methodology prepares you to become an entrepreneurial leader so you can address the greatest challenges of business and society, including innovation, growth, integrated sustainability, and globalization. Whether you’re making an impact within an established organization or starting your own venture, your increased self-awareness, expanded mindset, and refined skill set will allow you to create both economic and social value.\n\nThis experience is guided by four learning goals.\n\nVaried Perspectives Drive Your Success\n\nDiverse backgrounds and experiences make our environment richer and help us acquire new ways of working. Learning alongside students from all over the world, you’ll gain exposure to unique perspectives that strengthen your own. And, because you take your core courses with your cohort, you and your classmates form strong, lifelong connections.\n\nAfter Babson, the global network of 44,000+ alumni across 128 countries will have your back throughout your career.\n\nFull Time MBA Career Outcomes\n\nWhether it's launching a venture, changing industries, or accelerating your career, a Babson degree will help you move from where you are to where you want to be.\n\nFull Time MBA alumni are making an impact across organizations and industries, earning an average of $147,595 three years after graduation.
