It’s about discovery, growth and making new connections that can last a lifetime. That’s why UWA offers clubs and organizations geared to your passions, Greek life, intramural and varsity athletics, indoor and outdoor recreation on a 54-acre lake and in the Livingston area, a range of dining options, comfortable dorms and other residence options and much more. Take advantage of these opportunities and live your best student life."
