        "text": "The purpose of college and university ranking mainly resides to assist with the students in choosing their schools and programs at the level they wish to study. The US News and World Report (USNWR) graduate programs ranking is notable that evaluates the graduate level programs uniquely and in contrast with other general subject rankings. Along with the reputation of source, this specificity enables to enjoy a number of subscribers in making an application decision about which school or program is competitive and personally fits. Given the study of national research council is most comprehensive and authoritative ranking source on research doctorates, called Ph.Ds, the ranking of professional schools, for instance, law schools, medical schools, nursing schools and on, as presented to the students in USNWR is very determinative in deciding which school I choose. In this light, the following table I shows a ranking that has been yielded by combining the ranking of environmental law with that of legal writing. Same formula was applied to rank other subjects including the business/corporate law, constitutional law, and criminal law, which measure the strength of law schools in teaching to prepare all types of legal documents from court briefs, memorandum, court opinion through law review articles or texts and treatises. Therefore, the tables can be referred to not only by JD students, but also by researchers in the graduate law programs. Since some small or exclusively JD-oriented law schools are not available of LL.M or graduate study, the users of table are expected to read consciously. The ranking table has a threshold to qualify so as to be enlisted that the top 44 law schools in all specialties exclusively had been selected and ranked according to the average of two subjects. As said, it could be used secondarily to refer in deciding the schools on the application of general LL.M program. Given the junior scholarly nature of LL.M. or graduate law programs, it is considered that the legal writing program is half factored to select the schools. The column 1 and 2 transcribes the US ranking, which are added for a sum in column 3. Least number is placed at top and less number attains a high ranking correspondingly thorough the end of institutions.\n\nThe U.S. News & World Report publishes a diversity index along with its annual ranking of U.S. law schools. Race and ethnicity are the only factors the magazine uses to measure law school diversity. But is this a meaningful measure of student difference? Are race and ethnicity all that count or are there other differences that contribute to a richer educational experience for students and better outcomes for law schools? In a 2011 Iowa Law Review article, Kevin Johnson argues that law school diversity is not limited to only race and ethnicity. He further argues that law school diversity, defined broadly, is critical to the success of legal education; both for the students and the institutions that serve them.Yet, the epistemological question remains: how do law schools know how diverse their student bodies are? If law student diversity is more than just racial diversity, the current U.S. News index is incomplete and fails to provide a meaningful law school diversity measure. This es..."
