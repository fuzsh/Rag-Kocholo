Wilson, PhD\n\nProfessor of Statistics & Biostatistics\n\njeffrey.wilson@asu.edu\n\nJeffrey Wilson is a Professor of Statistics and Biostatistics and Associate Dean of Research and DEI in W. P. Carey School of Business. He is the former Director of the School of Health Management and Policy and a former Chair of the Editorial Board of the American Journal of Public Health. He is a former Director and co-Director of the Biostatistics Core in the NIH Center for Alzheimer at Arizona State University. His past leadership experiences include roles as Arizona representative to ASA; Chair for Section on Statistics APHA; the Director of the Interdisciplinary Program in Statistics at Arizona State University; and President of the Arizona Chapter of the ASA. In 1997, he was assigned to serve as a biostatistician on the Presidential committee on non-conventional practices to medicine. He is a former editorial board member of the Journal of Health Education & Development and served on the Membership Committee of American United Program Health Association. He is a former chair of the Intercollegiate Athletic Board at Arizona State University, and served as the chair of the Gender, Diversity, and Student Well-being subcommittee for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). He is also the former President of the PAC-12 council and the present PAC-12 FAR representative to 1A FAR association. He is presently the Statistics Associate Editor for The Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology and the Faculty Athletics Representative for Arizona State University.\n\nDr. Wilson’s research experience includes grants as PI and co-PI from the NIH, NSF, USDA, Arizona Department of Health Services, and the Arizona Disease Research Commission. He has published more than 80 articles in leading journals such as Statistics in Medicine, American Journal of Public Health, Journal of Royal Statistics Series C, Management Science, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, Computational Statistics, and Australian Journal of Statistics, among others. He has consulted with pharmaceutical companies and hospitals while representing them before the FDA and other federal government healthcare agencies.\n\nProfessor Wilson has also served as an expert witness in legal cases concerning construction defects, sampling, insurance, patient billing, job discrimination, profiling, shoplifting, and cheating allegations on law school exams. He has worked with attorney general offices in Minneapolis, Flagstaff, and Phoenix on racial profiling.\n\nDr. Wilson received his BA in Mathematics from the University of the West Indies and his MS and PhD in Statistics from the Iowa State University. He taught graduate courses in MBA Analytic programs and Executive MBA programs, as well as graduate courses in the areas of biostatistics, sampling, regression analysis, categorical data analysis, survival analysis, and generalized linear models, as well as undergraduate honors statistics courses in Business for Barrett Honors students. He has also taught specialized Biostatistics classes at Mayo Clinic. He has led similar courses for Phoenix Children’s Hospital, Barrow Neurological Center, St. Joseph’s Hospital, Banner Hospital, and Jobing.com. He helped to build syllabi and programs at Zayed University, Dubai, and University of Pretoria, South Africa.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation\n\nPh.D. Iowa State University of Science and Technology 1984\n\nM.S. Iowa State University of Science and Technology 1980\n\nB.A. University of the West Indies, Port of Spain, Trinidad 1977\n\nCV\n\nResearch Interests\n\nJoint Mean Dispersion Kurtosis Models\n\nIn general, we posit that any lack of fit can be better addressed by modeling what is left over. How well is that fit of the mean in modeling the binary data is measured by the unexplained variation. However, the fit can be improved by modelling the unexplained variation. One improvement from the mean modeling is usually done by the joint modeling of the mean and dispersion. We present the extension of the joint modeling of mean (first moment), dispersion (second moment), and kurtosis (fourth moment) to provide a better fit of the data. While we do not expect to completely address all of the variation, we show that this third sub model provides a better fit. The two approaches (mean and dispersion) and (mean, dispersion and kurtosis) are compared. A simulation study will provide a comparison of the two approaches.\n\nThree-level Hierarchical Models\n\nIn the analysis of repeated measures data, in addition to the inherent correlation due to the repeated responses we have covariates that change over time. The fact that for one reason or another the covariates change leads to the identification of moments necessary to obtain estimates of the regression coefficients. Moreover, these time–dependent covariates lead to feedback that may be necessary to model the mean.\n\nApplications of these Models\n\nThese models are applied to data obtained from the Bangladesh and Mozambique national database as well as Arizona Alzheimer’s research Consortium at Arizona State University.\n\nPublications\n\nMy research consists of work with my PhD students, master’s students, Barrett Honors students and my own interests with other researchers in statistics and other related issues.\n\nTremblay C, Serrano GE,Intorcia AJ, Sue LI, Wilson JR, Adler CH, et al.
