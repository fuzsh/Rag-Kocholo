        "text": "The New York Times recently published a column noting that U.S. law schools are apparently putting too many new graduates out each year. According to the author of this piece, Steven J. Harper, the news is not good at all for would-be barristers. Harper notes that in 2014, ten months after finishing their degrees, only 60% of graduates had found legal work requiring a law license. This would be bad enough if the the law students had only lost the time involved. But they have also gone into extreme debt to discover that not many people want to hire them. Private law school students are finishing their three years of higher education with $127,000 in debt, on average. Those wise souls who went to public universities get the extraordinary bargain of having only an average of $88,000 in loans to repay. Despite the fact that the job market is so gloomy, law schools keep admitting more and more students. Harper thinks this is because law schools get a high percentage of their revenue from tuition. For some private law schools, tuition comprises as much as 88% of all revenues. Law schools really have no motivation to reduce class sizes in the face of diminishing demand for new lawyers. In fact, they are motivated to admit ever more students. Thus it is that the gap opens between what the legal job market will bear and what law schools put out each year. I just got notice from my old law school, The University of Arizona, that they are welcoming 175 first year students this fall. When I graduated in 1992, my class was less than 150 students. That was before the law school redid the library and every other building on campus. I'll admit, the school looks much nicer than it did. Everything is first-rate now. But does that mean that they need ever more students to pay ever higher costs? Even if these students only have a 60% chance of being employed after graduating? It could be worse, I suppose. Something called Arizona Summit Law School, that didn't even exist when I was a law student, is gracing its graduates with debts of almost $200,000. This fine institution of higher learning is run as part of a for-profit enterprise. For most people, hearing that the legal job market is turning sour is good news. Nobody likes lawyers. But for the students who are taking on crippling amounts of debt, this is no idle moment to feel superior. I often say I am glad to be winding down my career in the law. I cannot imagine how these new graduates are going to make it.\n\nToo Many Law Students, Too Few Jobs"
