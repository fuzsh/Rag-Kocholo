        "text": "Why Arkansas Law?\n\nThe University of Arkansas School of Law offers a competitive J.D. as well as an advanced LL.M. program, which prepares students for success. Our challenging curriculum is taught by nationally recognized faculty, and there are unique opportunities for students to participate in pro bono work, externships, live client clinics, competitions, and food and agriculture initiatives.\n\nWe strive to identify, discuss, and challenge issues of race, color, ethnicity, and the impact(s) they have on students, faculty, and staff members in an effort to achieve a diverse, inclusive, and equitable community.\n\nThe University of Arkansas is the stateâs land grant flagship institution, and our law school embodies the best of what public legal education offers todayâs students. We are consistently ranked among the âBest Values in Legal Educationâ by National Jurist magazine, a designation we first won in 2011.\n\nFrom admitting the Six Pioneers who were the first African American students to attend law school in the South without a court order to graduating governors, judges, prosecutors, and faculty who went on to become President of the United States and Secretary of State, we have a rich history and culture."
