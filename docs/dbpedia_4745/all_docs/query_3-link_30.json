The basic principle of Title I is that schools with large concentrations of low-income students will receive supplemental funds to assist in meeting students educational goals. All other schools are Non-Title I.\n\nThe law allows, but does not require, teachers at public charter schools to maintain teaching certifications; therefore, teacher quality at public charter schools may not be accurately reflected solely by the number of “certified” teachers they employ. Instead, public charter schools hire and evaluate teachers based on other objective measures of teacher quality, such as subject matter expertise, student achievement results, and professionalism."
