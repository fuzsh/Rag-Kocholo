        "text": "There is a comeback happening across America and it will impact Louisiana as Babies \"R\" Us will be moving into retail space within Kohl's stores.\n\nIf you ever had a chance to shop at the Babies \"R\" Us location that was within Toys \"R Us\" years ago, you will remember that it was a beautiful shop. Shopping there allowed you to kill two birds with one stone; get a baby gift and get a child's toy.\n\nAs the Toys \"R\" Us locations were shuttered across the country, Lafayette's location was also closed including the Babies \"R\" Us within the store.\n\nToys \"R\" Us has, so far, made a successful comeback to the retail market, albeit on a much smaller scale. In several reports, Toys \"R\" Us opened one signature store, coordinated with Macy's stores to get their products into stores, and the addition of 24 mini stores in 2024.\n\nEarlier this month, Babies \"R\" Us shops started popping up in 200 locations of Kohl's across America, and they will have floor space in two Louisiana Kohl's locations.\n\nWhile anyone can always buy something online, it can be so exciting and practical to shop for items in a store so you can actually touch and see them.\n\nWhere Will The New Locations of Babies \"R\" Us in Louisiana Be Placed?\n\nIf you like to shop in the Kohl's Store in Covington then you will be excited to know they will be one of the two Louisiana locations for Babies \"R\" Us. The store will be at 6103 Pinnacle Parkway.\n\nIf you like to shop in Acadiana, you will be disappointed as the other location will not be here either as the Kohl's store in Slidell will get the Babies \"R\" Us. The store is located at 310 Town Center Parkway."
