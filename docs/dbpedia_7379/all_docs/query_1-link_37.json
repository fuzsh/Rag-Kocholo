        "text": "Life just doesn’t seem to be getting much easier for Randy Quaid.\n\nHe’s been arrested in Montreal during a meeting with immigration officials, though the reason for the arrest is currently unclear.\n\nQuaid told news agencies that he’d been detained during a routine check-in, meetings that he has to have since he was arrested in April this year for failing to attend a hearing with the Immigration Review Board in 2013.\n\nHe’ll appear at a hearing tomorrow over this latest matter.\n\nThe ‘Independence Day’ star could now be deported back to the US, following this latest run-in with the Canadian immigration department.\n\nVideo of the couple emerged two days ago on YouTube of Quaid and his wife drinking in a park on their wedding anniversary, ranting against the US government, Barack Obama, John Kerry, the state of Santa Barbara and seemingly speaking in support of Donald Trump.\n\nThe expletive-laden, 14-minute-long video, which also features footage of Randy doing strange exercises in the background and sporting a huge grey beard, is just the latest in a long line of strange broadcasts to the internet.\n\nOne involved the pair engaging in sexual activity while Evi was wearing a Rupert Murdoch mask.\n\nThe couple’s problems stem back to 2010, when they were arrested and accused of squatting in a property that they used to own in Santa Barbara.\n\nThey fled after being accused of burglary and vandalism of the property, which allegedly involved the pair breaking a £4500 mirror and replacing it with a huge picture of themselves.\n\nSince then, they fled to Canada to claim asylum, all the while talking of being targeted by an organisation called the 'star whackers’, a cult they claim were trying to kill them, and had been involved with the deaths of David Carradine and Heath Ledger.\n\nQuaid’s wife, whose father is Canadian, was granted citizenship in 2012, but Quaid’s was refused in 2013 because of the outstanding warrants against him.\n\nThis latest arrest could mean that Quaid, who is under a removal order from the Canadian immigration department, could be deported and sent back to America.\n\nRead more\n\n- Horror classics with added Donald Trump\n\n- Daniel Craig’s MASSIVE Spectre pay cheque\n\n- Fact & Fiction In Spy Movies"
