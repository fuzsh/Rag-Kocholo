        "text": "Randy and Evi Quaid reportedly believe there is an evil sect of Hollywood trying to kill them. It is the same shadowy organization that killed Heath Ledger, David Carradine, and Chris Penn. This sect is also responsible for extorting millions from their bank accounts, while running them out of the country.\n\nThe impetus for the seemingly paranoid descent into madness has several starting points depending on who you ask. Friends and relatives point to the 1989 marriage of the Quaids as the beginning of the end for the Golden Globe winning actor. Others say it manifested back in 2006, when they were approached by law enforcement for disturbing the peace (more on that later). Perhaps, it was when the world became aware of their self-destruction, when Randy was blackballed from a would-be Broadway play for allegedly verbally and physically attacking cast members, among other undignified behaviors reported by those on hand.\n\nFor the Quaids though, specifically Randy, the trouble with what he calls the “Star Whackers” began back in 1983. The following is a chronological account by family, friends, law enforcement, and the Quaids themselves, of how Randy and Evi became fugitives from the law, and how they descended into a state of apparent delusion that only few can understand.\n\nA Match Made In Madness\n\nRandy had a bright career ahead of him. The lumbering, 6 foot 4 inch doughy-faced older brother of Dennis Quaid had become a breakout star when, in 1974, he received an Oscar nomination starring alongside Jack Nicholson in The Last Detail. By 1983, Quaid had starred in critical and commercial hits like Midnight Express, and National Lampoon’s Vacation. Throughout the decade, Quaid would go on to star in Saturday Night Live, another Vacation film, and a Lyndon B. Johnson TV movie that would win him a Golden Globe.\n\nFrom the outside, it seemed that Quaid was blazing his own path, playing well-defined character roles that would become the highlight of many films. But, according to an aborted 220-page lawsuit that he filed in 2010, something sinister was swirling in the background of his budding career.\n\nThe Star Whackers, Quaid’s name for the evil Hollywood Illuminati thwarting his success, allegedly began dipping their hands into his fortune in 1983, after the success of the first Vacation film. Using a fake probate file, they created an identity from a deceased Santa Barbara woman — named Ronda L. Quaid — and used a fake trust fund to deposit and cash Randy’s royalty checks. Only, Ronda L. Quaid was real; she died in 2005 and was worth about $1.5 million. Yet, you can’t tell that to Evi.\n\nRonda L. Quaid never existed! No one ever has met her. She was supposedly a schoolteacher. But you go to the county and you pull the probate file and it’s $7 million in cash. How would a schoolteacher have that? It’s Randy’s royalty stream. I’ve researched everything. There’s no body. They’re just trying to merge the two identities in order to cash the checks.\n\nEvi Quaid was a 24-year-old model and production assistant when she met Randy in 1988. She was assigned to drive actors to the set of Bloodhounds of Broadway, a film starring Madonna. On the day she met and drove Randy to the set, they got lost, eventually ending up at a Chinese restaurant where Randy proposed to her on the spot. She said yes, and they ended up spending the night together.\n\nEvi was born a socialite — her uncle was a founder of Revlon, her mother already wealthy from the family’s connection to a trucking company in New Jersey. After she married Randy, she appeared twice in Vogue, highlighting her fashion and extensive wardrobe that few in L.A. could compete with. In 1989, Evi and Randy bought a $1.35 million home in Montecito, California.\n\nThen, in 1991, the Quaids would sell the home, but what they didn’t know at the time is that the sale would become the stimulus for a long, winding road of instability.\n\nThe Snowball Effect\n\nThings were relatively quiet for the Quaids throughout the 90s. Randy was making a lot of money and Evi was spending it on clothes and furniture. Randy’s odd behavior began escalating in 2005, when he sued the producers of Brokeback Mountain for underselling the film and, in turn, causing his payday to be a bit more lackluster than he would have preferred. Then, in 2006, the producers of the HBO show Entourage, called the police to the Quaids’ residence. Their neighbors were having a party, so in retaliation, Randy and Evi installed speakers into their treetops and began booming a song that Randy had sung in the 2004 animated film Home on the Range. An episode of Entourage was filming a few shorts blocks away.\n\nIn 2007, things really got out of control. Randy was cast in a Broadway musical: Lone Star Love. Producers of the play had loved Quaid during the auditions; he was jovial, professional and generally a pleasure to be around.\n\n…Randy had been entirely charming and won the creative team over in the casting process.\n\nThen, Evi joined him for rehearsals.\n\nShe designed his outfit complete with dyed-red hair and a cod piece. She filmed rehearsals despite it being against union rules. She sent condescending e-mails to producers. And, for the coup de grâce, she sent a naked photo of herself holding a gun to several key players in the production.\n\nFor Randy’s part in the mess, he smacked a cast member’s head four times during a rehearsal, later claiming he was just in character.\n\nI am guilty of only one thing: giving a performance that elicited a response so deeply felt by the actors and producers with little experience of my creative process that they actually think I am Falstaff.\n\nThe cast had had enough. The members of the cast, and the producers, filed a complaint with the Actors’ Equity Union, and Randy was fined over $81,000 and banned from the union for life. Lone Star Love shut down and never made it to Broadway.\n\nThe backlash from the ban was more than anyone could’ve imagined. Evi hired a detective to look into the backgrounds of all the cast members, claiming that they wanted to kill the married couple.\n\nEvi demanded that I harass [the cast]. I observed Evi’s paranoia increase and she was convinced someone was going to murder Randy and then Evi to make it look like murder-suicide…\n\nBecky Altringer, the private eye that the Quaids hired, even let them stay in a mobile home she rented out.\n\nThree weeks they rented a mobile home from me—it was my partner’s mom’s—after we kicked them out of our house. I was literally going insane from Evi and her dog. She let it urinate in the house; she took our dinners out to the dog—roast beef. She woke up in the morning and said the mob was here—they have chainsaws and shovels; they’re going to bury us. I said, Evi, that’s the gardener.\n\nIn 2009, the Quaids skipped out on a $10,000 bill at the San Ysidro Ranch Hotel; it was just the beginning of their legal woes. They were arrested after the hotel lobbied a complaint, and after paying a $20,000 bond, the Quaids would skip five court hearings. Authorities would eventually catch up with them in Marfa, Texas, where they were in the process of erecting a museum dedicated to Randy.\n\nAfter posting another bond — this one for $40,000 — they famously appeared at their next two court hearings. At one hearing, Evi held tightly to Randy’s 1988 Golden Globe, and at the other, Randy wore a sheriff’s badge while Evi had a credit card glued to her forehead. The judge in the case didn’t take the theatrics lightly: they were sent to jail, but posted $100,000 bail after a few hours in custody. The charges against Randy were dropped, but Evi had to pay a fine and commit to community service.\n\nIn August and September of 2010, that Montecito home that Randy and Evi had sold in 1991 came back into the picture. Randy attempted to file a 220-page lawsuit alleging that the home was used by corrupt lawyers and accountants as an equity pit — essentially a real estate ATM for a secretive group of Hollywood evildoers. He claimed that the home was still in their name and it had never been sold, but his lawsuit was thrown out when he couldn’t provide the court fees to continue the process.\n\nOn September 19th, the owner of the Montecito home found the couple squatting in the guesthouse with $30,000 worth of damage done to the property. They were arrested and bailed out once again, before fleeing to Vancouver, skipping out on court dates and becoming fugitives from the law.\n\nOn The Run\n\nIn January of 2013, Randy was denied by immigration officials a permanent stay status in Canada, despite his lawyer arguing that to come back to the U.S. would be suicide.\n\nThey fear for their lives from real criminals of organized crime and have asked to be protected by Canada…\n\nThe Quaids popped up in the news again this past April, when they sued the American Surety Bond Company for allegedly posting bonds without their consent after the couple was arrested following the 2010 home squatting incident. Only the Quaids’ lawyer showed up in the California court, and Randy’s bail was rescinded due to a clerical error.\n\nIt’s unknown when, or if, we’ll ever see Randy back on American soil again. The Quaids are both still wanted for “felony vandalism and misdemeanor unauthorized entry of a house.” Likely, his acting career is finished; his last film was in 2009. He still keeps an active Twitter account though, and it’s as odd as you’d expect.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TheRandyQuaid/status/516071275782213632\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TheRandyQuaid/status/487039925355704320\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TheRandyQuaid/status/484594516339326976\n\nCurrently, authorities are not sure as to his exact whereabouts, but one thing is for certain, if he steps back onto U.S. soil, he’ll be arrested on sight. Dennis Quaid remains tight-lipped about his older brother’s situation.\n\nI love my brother. That’s all I can say. I love my brother and I miss my brother. That’s all I’m going to say."
