        "text": "Shortly after 8 P.M., Randy Quaid rises from the earth to become a man-made monster, the title character in ''The Golem,'' H. Leivick's classic at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. It is a challenging dramatic role, and Mr. Quaid performs it with an authority that belies his limited theatrical experience.\n\n''The Golem'' is only the second time that he has acted on the stage since college. The first was Off Broadway last season as the unkempt brother in Sam Shepard's ''True West,'' playing opposite - and bedeviling - his own younger brother, Dennis Quaid.\n\nRandy Quaid is, of course, primarily known as a movie actor, with some 20 films in 14 years, in many of them (such as ''The Last Detail''), playing large, lovable oafs. Commenting on ''The Golem,'' the actor, who is in his early 30's, said: ''He goes through all the ages of man. He is born. He is like a kid falling in love. He fulfills his purpose in life, and then he's cast aside - as society does with old people. Then he dies.'' With a smile, he said, ''He's just a big kid gone wrong.''\n\nWhen Richard Foreman, the play's director, approached him about doing the role for Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival, he had to admit that he had never heard of the play. The first time he read it he didn't understand it - except as it related to ''Frankenstein.''\n\nAt Mr. Foreman's insistence, he auditioned and found himself excited by the biblical language and by the bizarre character who is created by a rabbi to save the Jews of Prague. ''A lot of emotional things happened,'' Mr. Quaid said. ''All this stuff started coming out of me.'' Despite discouragement from his agent - because of the minimum salary - he accepted the offer, and, together with his director, began working diligently in conceiving a characterization.\n\nKeeping Eyes Wide Open\n\nHis single preconception, he said, was a decision to keep his eyes wide open while playing the role, staring down the other characters. During rehearsal, in order to acclimate himself he would walk down the street wearing the golem's platform shoes, adding four inches to his own 6-foot-4-inch frame. No one noticed. ''The real golem was 11 feet tall,'' he said. ''A really big guy.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
