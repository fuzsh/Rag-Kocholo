        "text": "âAll the worldâs a stage, and all the men and women merely players.â\n\nFrom âAs You Like Itâ\n\nIn one of the most famous theatrical lines ever written, William Shakespeare suggests life is like a play, and everyone is an actor with their own unique and important role. It describes the transient nature of human existence and the idea that our actions are performed in front of an audience, literally and metaphorically.\n\nThere is perhaps no better way for the Houston Shakespeare Festival, the professional arm of the University of Houston School of Theatre & Dance, to celebrate its 50th anniversary season than with a nod to those immortal words as it presents two of The Bardâs most beloved plays: âRomeo and Julietâ and âA Midsummer Nightâs Dreamâ.\n\nâThe excitement for this season pulses through our shops and rehearsal studios,â says Jack Young, HSF artistic director and acting professor at UH. âAs we mark a half-century of the Houston Shakespeare Festival, weâre fueled by joy and gratitude for the nearly 2,000 actors and crew members that came before us, who forged this path that weâre continuing today.â\n\nBy all accounts, Sidney Berger, the longtime director of the University of Houston School of Theatre & Dance, was a true evangelist for Shakespeare. When he arrived at UH in 1969, he brought with him a vision to create a platform that not only celebrated Shakespeareâs timeless tales, but also provided a unique opportunity for his students to learn the craft of acting and design alongside seasoned professionals.\n\nIn 1975, he won the support of UH administrators and Miller Outdoor Theatreâs advisory board to produce two plays each summer that were completely free to the public, and the Houston Shakespeare Festival was born.\n\nHelping Berger implement his vision was Cecil Pickett, another beloved acting professor at UH who mentored several soon-to-be famous actors, including Dennis and Randy Quaid, Brent Spiner and Brett Cullen. And his own daughter, Cindy Pickett.\n\nâMy father was really talented, but disciplined as well, even when I was in high school,â Pickett says. âHe would make his acting students so mad until he got them to create the performance he was looking for. But they loved him for it.â\n\nPickett, who starred on the soap opera âGuiding Lightâ before gaining fame playing the mother of the â80âs most famous teenager, Ferris Bueller, appeared in several HSF productions during her time at UH, including a starring role as Gertrude in âHamlet.â She says the collaborative relationship between Berger and her father was key to the festivalâs early success.\n\nâThey complimented each other very well,â Pickett says. âMy father was grateful to Sidney for bringing him on board and Sidney appreciated Cecilâs influence on the students and all of the talent he was bringing in. They had their issues, sometimes, but they were like family.â\n\nUnlike Cindy Pickett, Brett Cullen was not born to be an actor.\n\nâShakespeare is something you do to grow and challenge yourself, but itâs a hard way to make a living,â says Cullen, who graduated from UH in 1979 and continues to serve his alma mater as a member of the UH Board of Visitors. âCan you tell me one actor thatâs made a career out of doing Shakespeare?â\n\nLong before he was rescuing Tom Hanks and his crew from a failed moon mission in âApollo 13â and infiltrating a group of plane crash survivors in the hit television series âLostâ, Cullen sharpened his acting skills on the HSF stage for four seasons.\n\nâWe had a lot of really good actors in those shows and it was like we were all one big family,â Cullen says. âThe Houston Shakespeare Festival was a great experience for me and gave me an incredible amount of knowledge and strength in the sense that I knew I could do it.â\n\nMarc Masterson, another young actor who would go on to become one of the countryâs most well-respected artistic directors, was there in the early days of HSF as well and says the mix of students and professionals in the productions is what he remembers most.\n\nâYou werenât just performing for your peers, you were working with a number of people who were at different stages in their careers, but you were able to build this great ensemble,â Masterson says. âWe were performing in front of thousands of people each night and you felt you were really part of something special. Not everyone has that opportunity. What a gift it was.â\n\nAmong the featured guests at HSF over the years was the dynamic husband-and-wife duo of Leah Gardiner and Seth Gilliam. Gardiner, an award-winning director, and Gilliam, star of hit television series such as âThe Wireâ and âThe Walking Deadâ, came to Houston in 2011 for âOthelloâ and returned two years later for âAntony and Cleopatra.â\n\nâMy fondest memory of that time was working with the students who were also in the productions. Their energy, passion and commitment reminded me of my own college days,â says Gilliam, says. âHouston will always have a special place in my heart because of those students and the HSF staff that treated us as family and made the experience so joyful.â\n\nâHSF has a unique place in my heart because everyone who worked on those shows gave their all, leaving their egos at the door and creating this extraordinary playmaking process,â Gardiner says. âHSF was a very magical experience, and I miss it dearly.â\n\nThe Perfect Venue\n\nâGood company, good wine, good welcome can make good people.â\n\nFrom \"Henry VIII\"\n\nNone of HSFâs success over the past half-century would have been possible without the partnership with Miller Outdoor Theatre. The venue in the heart of Houstonâs Hermann Park, with its beloved hill and iconic proscenium stage, has hosted some of the worldâs biggest plays, musicals and musicians over the years, and always for free.\n\nFor Sidney Berger, it was the perfect place to stage his festival.\n\nâNobody wanted to do anything in late July and early August outside at Miller, but Sidney saw it as an opportunity,â Young says. âItâs such a unique space, and he wanted to make sure Houston could have free Shakespeare in the park like every other major American city.â\n\nMiller is much larger than the intimate indoor theaters where Shakespeare productions are typically staged. And while the size and scope do present challenges, they also create opportunities.\n\nâMiller is my favorite theater to design for because you have this really big scale and you have to think about everything from the audienceâs point of view, what is it going to look like sitting up on that hill,â says Jodie Daniels, a UH alumna and costume designer for HSF. âSo itâs all about the details, the colors, the size, and how they mesh together visually for the audience. Itâs like a unified piece of art on stage.â\n\nSince its debut on August 8, 1975, the festival has entertained more than a million Houstonians who pack the pavilion or the grassy hill behind it with their blankets and picnic baskets. Itâs the production teamâs job to make sure thereâs not a bad seat in the house.\n\nâItâs such a unique experience, this hybrid of an indoor theater space with all the bells and whistles and high-tech possibilities while still being open to the outside,â says Amelia Fischer, a UH alumna and 12-year HSF veteran who will direct âMidsummerâ this season. âOur actors and production team are having a lot of fun with it and theyâre ready to put on something special.â\n\nThe successful partnership of Sidney Berger and Cecil Pickett ended when Pickett retired in 1988. But the foundation he helped build is still going strong, and his influence still resonates today.\n\nSidney Berger remained at UH until 2009 and took his final bow on the HSF stage the following year.\n\nâSidney and Cecil built this incredible foundation and laid out a path for everyone so the show could go on,â Young says. âBecause of their hard work and dedication, they left the festival in very good hands.â\n\nAmong those entrusted with carrying on the tradition was longtime UH theater professor Carolyn Boone who, in 1995, was hand-picked by Berger to be Pickettâs permanent replacement. Several of Boones former students eventually found success and critical acclaim, including Emmy-winning actor Jim Parsons of âThe Big Bang Theoryâ and Broadway actress Roxanne Hope.\n\nâMy job was to inspire the actorsâ and crewsâ imaginations to create a story that was more vivid and more revealing than any production of that play before it,â says Boone, who retired from HSF in 2009. âThat is the goal and challenge of every director of every play, and certainly mine during my time at HSF.â\n\nBut it was up to Jack Young and Rob Shimko, who both arrived at UH in 2006, to guide HSF through the most challenging period in its history. In 2016, Shimko was named director of the School of Theatre & Dance and executive director of HSF, joining Young who was named artistic director. After several innovative and productive seasons, it all came to a screeching halt in 2020.\n\nâWe had already planned out that summerâs season when the COVID shutdowns began and we had to cancel,â Shimko says. âThe next year, with great help from Cori Stevenson, our community outreach director, we were able to put on a film festival in lieu of live performances while working diligently behind the scenes to prepare for a full live return in 2022.â\n\nAnd return, it did, with a renewed energy and focus that was evident in memorable performances of âKing Learâ and âCymbeline.â The Bard was back in a big way.\n\nâOne of HSFâs most important legacies is that is has been the first professional theater job for hundreds of emerging actors over the past 50 years,â Shimko says. âHaving the ability to offer a contract to students who earn the opportunity is a tremendous benefit to the UH program and to the broader theater ecosystem in Houston.â\n\nWith the curtain ready to rise for the 2024 season, the HSF team is eager to build on festivalâs remarkable legacy and is embracing the exciting possibilities that lie ahead.\n\nâThe fact that the university and the city have been able to sustain this for 50 years speaks to the strong love and support of the arts in this community,â Fischer says. âHouston is way ahead of the curve, arts-wise, and I hope that continues.â\n\nSharon Ott, the new director of the School of Theatre & Dance and executive director of HSF who arrived just in time for opening night, is hoping to keep the momentum going.\n\nâI am honored to be joining the University of Houston and the Houston Shakespeare festival at this important milestone in its history,â Ott says. âWe want to expand our reach, engage new audiences and foster a deeper appreciation for The Bardâs masterpieces. As we look forward to the next 50 years, we are ready to inspire and captivate generations to come with the enduring magic of Shakespeare.â\n\nOne of Shakespeareâs most famous quotes, âwhatâs past is prologue,â perfectly encapsulates the essence of the festivalâs journey, suggesting that its history provides a strong foundation for an even more vibrant and successful future.\n\nâHSF was, and still is, such a glorious gift to the city,â says Boone. âTo think it all began with Dr. Bergerâs love of Shakespeare and his vision and energy to share it with the people of Houston, and here we are 50 years later and still going strong.â\n\nâRomeo & Julietâ is one of Shakespeareâs most well-known tragedies. Two star-crossed lovers, swept up by the hatred of their feuding families, believe their love is strong enough to overcome the violence around them.\n\nSophia Marcelle, who graduated from UH in 2022, plays Juliet and says she wasnât intimidated by stepping into one of the most famous roles in the history of theater.\n\nâItâs every actressâs dream to play Juliet, and getting to do so at a young age is very special,â Marcelle says. âAnd love has always been important in my life, and I think audiences will feel a lot of love in this production, not just between the characters but from the castmates as well.â\n\nAnother of the worldâs most famous roles, Romeo, is being played by Kyle Clark, a 2018 UH graduate who is in his third season of HSF. Clark says audiences can expect incredible action in the well-choreographed sword fighting scenes, and he believes the playâs enduring message of love is very timely.\n\nâYou have characters that are fighting for a better life and hoping to find love against all odds,â Clark says. âI think thatâs a good reminder for all of us that there is still some good that exists in the world, and you can find it even in the direst of circumstances.â\n\nâThis is our summer of love,â Young says. âWhat better way to celebrate than through the greatest love story ever told?â\n\nâA Midsummer Nightâs Dreamâ is Shakespeareâs beloved fairy tale of midsummer madness, an adventure into an enchanted forest filled with love, magic and mischief where fantastical dreams blur with reality.\n\nFor actress Laura Frye, a UH theater graduate and four-season veteran of HSF, the play is the perfect way to celebrate the festivalâs 50th season.\n\nâI think this production is going to be a feast for the eyes,â says Frye, who plays Titania, Queen of the Fairies. âIt will feel a lot like when Dorothy went to Oz and walked into that Technicolor world, that is what âMidsummerâ feels like when weâre in the land of the fairies.â\n\nAlan Brinks, a 2018 UH graduate who plays Titaniaâs husband Oberon, King of the Fairies, believes the uniqueness of the Miller Outdoor venue will enhance the experience for audiences.\n\nâThis performance of âMidsummerâ is special because itâs outside where Shakespeare makes so many references to natural things,â says Brinks, who plays Titaniaâs husband Oberon, King of the Fairies. âWith the moon and stars, the trees, thereâs a different connection to the material than if you were inside a small, closed-in theater.â\n\nDirector Amelia Fischer agrees and says of all the plays sheâs directed, this may be her favorite.\n\nâIt doesnât get much better than âMidsummerâ outside,â Fischer says. âWe have designed a beautiful set with some truly incredible, vibrant costumesâ¦ itâs really everything you could ever want from this play.â"
