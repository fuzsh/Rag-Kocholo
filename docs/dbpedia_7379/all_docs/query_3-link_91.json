        "text": "TORONTO — Randy Quaid will be allowed to stay in Canada indefinitely as a permanent Canadian resident after authorities withdrew their inadmissibility court proceedings against the American actor.\n\nThe breakthrough came Wednesday when Quaid’s lawyer said his wife, Evi Quaid, who now has Canadian citizenship, will sponsor his entry and new life in Canada.\n\n“On Feb. 16, the inadmissibility proceedings against Randy Quaid were formally withdrawn by CBSA. Randy no longer faces any impediments to his presence in Canada,” Catherine Sas told reporters Wednesday in Vancouver.\n\nThe turnaround means the Quaids can now avoid a return to California to answer vandalism charges.\n\nEvi Quaid received her Canadian citizenship card on February 10 owing to her father having been born here.\n\nShe in turn formally applied to sponsor her husband and expects Randy Quaid to eventually withdraw his Canadian refugee claim and receive permanent resident status here.\n\n“Today, we’re here to say thank you Canada,” Randy Quaid said in a prepared statement.\n\n“Thank you for your warm welcome. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to live in peace,” he said."
