        "text": "Randall Rudy \"Randy\" Quaid (born October 1, 1950) is an American actor best known for his role as Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon's Vacation movies, as well as his numerous supporting roles in films such as The Last Detail, Independence Day, Kingpin and Brokeback Mountain. He has won a Golden Globe Award, and has been nominated for an Academy Award, an Emmy Award and a BAFTA Award.\n\nRandy Quaid was born in Houston, Texas, the son of Juanita Bonniedale \"Nita\" (n√©e Jordan), a real estate agent, and William Rudy Quaid, an electrician. According to actor Dennis Quaid, Randy's brother, their father was a \"frustrated actor\", and musician Gene Autry was Randy's grandfather's first cousin. Randy attended Pershing Middle School and Bellaire High School. He is married to former Helmut Newton model Evi Quaid.\n\nQuaid has appeared in over 90 movies. Peter Bogdanovich discovered him when Quaid was a student at the University of Houston, and he received his first exposure in Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show. His character escorts Jacy Farrow (played by Cybill Shepherd) to late-night indoor skinny-dipping at a swimming pool. It was the first of his several roles directed by Bogdanovich and/or based on the writings of Larry McMurtry."
