        "text": "“Kingpin” actor Randy Quaid says he’s throwing a party in Texas to celebrate Independence Day. The fervent Donald Trump supporter also says that the big bash will be open to every U.S. citizen.\n\n“I’m hosting a giant 4th of July party in Texas. Every American is invited!” the 70-year-old Houston native tweeted Monday. “RSVP HERE. FREE MILLER BEER! REAL ID IS REQUIRED.”\n\nQuaid and his wife, Evi Motolanez, famously moved to Canada in 2010 where they both applied for residency amid legal troubles in the U.S.\n\nQuaid unsuccessfully claimed his life was in danger due to “Hollywood star-whackers.” The pair returned to the U.S. in 2015 when they moved to Vermont, where Motolanez was raised.\n\nFILE - Randy Quaid is pictured in 2015. (Peter McCabe / AP/)\n\nWhile Quaid’s acting career has cooled off considerable since he was nominated for an Academy Award in 1974′s “The Last Detail,” he found himself in the spotlight in 2020 when then-president Trump re-tweeted statements by the actor promoting the false conspiracy theory that the 2020 election, which was won by Joe Biden, had been rigged.\n\nThe former president tweeted back at Quaid, “Thank you Randy, working hard to clean up the stench of the 2020 Election Hoax!”\n\nQuaid lashed out at President Biden early this month when the 46th president compared pandemic anti-maskers to neanderthals after the Republican Texas governor announced the Lone Star State would roll back COVID restrictions.\n\n“As a native Texan I am appalled our president has called me a Neanderthal,” Quaid tweeted. “23 And Me has verified that I have NO Neanderthal ancestry gene in my genetic code. This is not to say Neanderthal lives don’t matter, just sayin’ a lot of us Texans have grounds for a class action suit.”\n\nMiller’s parent company told the Daily News its beer brand is not affiliated with Quaid’s event."
