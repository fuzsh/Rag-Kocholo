        "text": "Randall Rudy \"Randy\" Quaid is an American actor and voice actor, whose only theatrical and credited Disney role (yet first in general) so far is Alameda Slim in the 2004 Disney animated feature film Home on the Range. His other Disney role is Rockin' Rory in Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up, which was released directly to video, and in which he was uncredited. He also played Sam Burns in the 1996 Touchstone Pictures film Last Dance and Madman McKlusky in Frank McKlusky, C.I..\n\nQuaid was born in Houston, Texas, to Juanita Bonnie \"Nita\" (n√©e Jordan), a real estate agent, and William Rudy Quaid, a licensed electrician. Quaid has English, Irish, Scots-Irish, and Cajun (French) ancestry. Through his father, Quaid is a first cousin twice removed of famous cowboy performer Gene Autry. Quaid grew up in Bellaire, Texas, a small city surrounded by Houston, specifically in southwest Houston. He is the older brother of actor Dennis Quaid.\n\nOutside of Disney, Quaid is perhaps best known for his role as Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon's Vacation film series, as well as his Academy Award-nominated performance as Laurence M. \"Larry\" Meadows in The Last Detail. His other film credits include Independence Day, Kingpin, Brokeback Mountain, The Last Picture Show, What's Up, Doc?, Paper Moon, Midnight Express, Real Time, Parents, and Moving.\n\nQuaid has also appeared in numerous television films, such as Elvis, Inside the Third Reich, A Streetcar Named Desire, LBJ: The Early Years, Moonshine Highway, and The Magical Legend of the Leprechauns.
