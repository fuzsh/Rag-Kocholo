        "text": "Quaid had legal problems, including an arrest in 2009 for using an invalid credit card at a Santa Barbara hotel. He is also a supporter of former President Donald Trump. The Quaids are wanted in Santa Barbara, California, for crimes filed in 2010 after squatting a guest house out of a home they previously owned. Court documents indicate that the Quaids damaged or destroyed furniture, a fireplace and a mirror. They are accused of illegally occupying the property and failing to attend hearings. Randy`s legal issues in California are well documented, so it sounds very personal. As we have pointed out. Randy and his wife, Evi, are wanted in Santa Barbara for failing to show up for a court hearing in their 2010 burglary case. Remember that the Quaids were charged after allegedly living illegally in a house. But after a brief pause of no more than 10 minutes, Judge Arms returned to court, invited the lawyers and the Quaids, said she had reviewed the California documents and determined that there was no legal basis for the Quaids` continued detention in Vermont. The 65-year-old actor said Wednesday in an interview with The Associated Press from a detention center in Laval, Que., that he wants to solve his legal problems in California and “get on with his life.” Quaid, the older brother of actor Dennis Quaid, had also fled a number of legal problems. He and Evi were first arrested in 2009 for leaving a hotel in Santa Barbara, California, without paying. In 2010, they were arrested again for living in a guesthouse on the grounds of a house that once belonged to them and damaging it.\n\nIn between, there were several missed court dates, arrest warrants, and headlines like “What Happened to Randy Quaid?” Although the Quaid have been released from prison, they may still face legal problems. The couple`s current legal problems in California stem from an arrest in 2010 when they were charged with trespassing and caused more than $5,000 in damage to the guest house of a home they once owned. They were reportedly crouched there when they were arrested. Two days before they were charged, they travelled to Vancouver, British Columbia. After his work in the comedy Balls Out: Gary the Tennis Coach (2009), Quaid`s legal troubles prevented him from working for nearly a decade. [14] Quaid was not invited to play the role of cousin Eddie in Vacation (2015), although the character is verbally referenced. He returned with Rob Margolies` weight loss comedy All You Can Eat (2018),[15][16] which premiered at the SOHO International Film Festival in June 2018. After the film screened at the Northeast Film Festival in September 2018, Quaid was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in a Feature Film.[17] [18] Quaid had lived in Montreal since 2013 and was briefly arrested for not registering as a non-resident. [42] In 2014, Quaids sued the U.S. State Department for revoking their passports in 2011. [43] [44] In 2015, Quaid`s calls in Canada were exhausted and he was informed that he was going to be deported.\n\n[45] A week before the deportation date, the couple crossed the Canadian border into Vermont, where they were detained by U.S. customs. The couple was detained pending extradition proceedings ordered by the state of California. But the judge found a legal basis for the charges against the Quaids, who reportedly did not appear in court in 2010. Langrock argued that holding the actor on $500,000 bail was disproportionate given the relatively minor damages the Quaids allegedly caused. Quaid told The Associated Press last week that he was ready to solve his legal problems and “move on” in his life. To determine if he still believes that a gang of major killers is after him. The actor has a long history of legal problems and it is currently unclear whether this will mean he will not be able to run for office. Even if they don`t pose a challenge, Quaid will have to face the public because of his problems, which could hurt his chances of winning.\n\nOver the past decade, he has become quite famous for his conspiracy theories and legal troubles, including a series of arrests. In 2009, he and his wife were arrested for using an invalid credit card to pay a $10,000 bill in Santa Barbara. The couple was charged with burglary, fraud and conspiracy, but the case was dropped for lack of evidence. The couple fled the United States. After the trials in California, they said they were victims of persecution. Randy Quaid had tried to stay in Canada, claiming he was being chased by “Hollywood stars” who had killed his friends David Carradine and Heath Ledger. Last week, Quaid said in an interview with The Associated Press from a detention center in Laval, Quebec, that he wanted to solve legal problems and “get on with his life.” To be fair, this is at least more of an announcement that Caitlyn Jenner made. While Jenner has announced her candidacy for governor, she has yet to make any announcements about her policies or position, prompting many to reject her shot.\n\nQuaid still has to submit the paperwork for his candidacy, but he has time, as the election date has not yet been announced. If he submits the documents, there is one obvious obstacle Quaid faces: his legal problems. In 2015, the Canadian government announced it would deport the actor after he exhausted all legal avenues. A week before their deportation, the couple drove via Vermont to the United States and were arrested by U.S. customs. The case against him was dropped after a Vermont judge found “irregularities” and the couple was allowed to live in the state without conditions. Quaid briefly returned to California for a vacation in 2017, but stayed away from the state. Efforts to remove Gov. Gavin Newsom reached a significant milestone Monday when it was announced that enough verified signatures had been submitted to qualify for an recall election, making it nearly inevitable that an recall election will be held later this year.\n\nWhen asked what it meant to hear Judge Arms deliver the verdict, Quaid called it “profound.” Quaid was born in Houston, Texas, to Juanita Bonniedale “Nita” (née Jordan), a real estate agent, and William Rudy Quaid (November 21, 1923 – February 8, 1987), an electrician. [4] Quaid has English, Scottish-Irish and Cajun ancestry. Through his father, Quaid was a first cousin of cowboy actor Gene Autry.[5] Randy Quaid grew up in Bellaire, Texas,[7] a small town surrounded by Houston and southwest of Houston.[6] He is the older brother of actor Dennis Quaid. The absurdity of my home state of California`s attempt to recall Newsom has just been reinforced by Randy Quaid, who said he would challenge Caitlyn Jenner. All legitimate concerns are obscured by these types of challenges. In 2011, the couple gave Vanity Fair an interview that showed how far their conspiracy theory seemed to go all the way. Evi believed that her mail had been diverted to California, that the detective with his arrest warrant was part of the “montage” against Michael Jackson at his pedophilia trial, and that Broadway producers had poisoned Jeremy Piven with mercury, among other things. While many people interviewed for the story were worried about Evi`s stability, Quaid told the magazine that she was the smartest person he knows. Randy Quaid`s indictment on the same charge continued through Thursday, as California courts closed Monday for Columbus Day and the Franklin County District Attorney`s Office was unable to obtain the necessary documents."
