        "text": "[Updated]. I don’t have time or the energy to write something deeply felt about each and every Scott film, but there’s absolutely no question in my mind the The Counselor deserves its #4 slot, that the first half of Matchstick Men is dead brilliant, and that A Good Year (ranked at #8) is a much better film that many people realize.\n\nIn this order…\n\n1. Alien\n\n2. The Duellists\n\n3. Thelma and Louise\n\n4. The Counselor\n\n5. Blade Runner\n\n6. American Gangster\n\n7. Matchstick Men\n\n8. Gladiator\n\n9. Kingdom of Heaven (extended version)\n\n10. A Good Year\n\n11. Black Hawk Down\n\n12. Black Rain\n\n13. The Martian\n\nI don’t feel that strongly care about the rest. Okay, I hate Prometheus and Alien: Covenant. Ditto Legend. Someone to Watch Over Me is piffle. I found House of Gucci half-tolerable, but I’m not sure I’d want to watch it again.\n\nThe Last Duel was better than half-decent. I don’t even remember 1492: Conquest of Paradise or Body Of Lies. Scott’s Robin Hood was half-watchable, G.I. Jane is negligible; ditto Exodus: Gods and Kings, White Squall, Hannibal.\n\nI was actually okay with All The Money In The World."
