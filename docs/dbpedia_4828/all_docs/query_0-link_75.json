        "text": "NEW YORK -- (SPW) --\n\nThe Film Society of Lincoln Center announced a complete retrospective of three-time Oscar-nominee Ridley Scott, whose career began in the 70’s and who has continued to excite and enchant audiences with his remarkable storytelling ability. The retrospective will run from May 25 – June 3 and will include the Director’s cut of KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, a new 35mm print of THELMA & LOUISE and the chance for fans to catch all of their favorites on the big screen.\n\n“With ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER, Ridley Scott has been responsible for two of the most lasting and visionary works of science-fiction cinema,” said Film Society Associate Director of Programming Scott Foundas. “But as a filmmaker, he has seemed just as compelled by stories set in the distant past and those set in the combat zones of the present, always finding the human dimension in the mythic and the mythic dimension in the seemingly everyday. As he makes his long-awaited return to sci-fi with this summer’s highly anticipated PROMETHEUS, we’re delighted to pay tribute to Scott and his extraordinary career.”\n\nBorn in South Shields, England in 1937, Scott studied photography at the Royal College of Art in London, where he helped to establish a film department and made his first short subject, BOY AND BICYCLE, starring his younger brother (and future director) Tony. Together, the brothers then launched Ridley Scott Associates, a prolific commercial production company that counted future Oscar nominees Alan Parker (MIDNIGHT EXPRESS) and Hugh Hudson (CHARIOTS OF FIRE) among its stable of directors.\n\nIn 1977, Scott made his feature directing debut with THE DUELLISTS, an acclaimed adaptation of Joseph Conrad’s novella The Duel, starring the young Harvey Keitel and Ketih Carradine as feuding Napoleonic soldiers. Two years later, ALIEN catapulted him to the top of the Hollywood A-list, though the subsequent BLADE RUNNER would meet with soft box-office and an indifferent critical reaction upon its initial release, only to later be hailed as a classic whose impact and influence spread beyond filmmaking to the realms of real-world architecture and design.\n\nIn the decades since, Scott’s work has continued to set a high bar for large-scale studio filmmaking, earning more than $1 billion in domestic box-office receipts, a Best Picture Oscar for GLADIATOR and three Best Director Oscar nominations (for THELMA & LOUISE, GLADIATOR and BLACK HAWK DOWN). In addition, he has maintained a successful television career, serving as executive producer on the long-running CBS series NUMB3RS and THE GOOD WIFE. In 2003, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his contributions to the British film industry.\n\nTake advantage of a Double-Shot of Scott!!
