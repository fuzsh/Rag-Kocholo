        "text": "(born 1937). British film director and producer Ridley Scott made movies that were praised for their visual style and rich details. One of his trademarks was the use of atmospheric lighting effects.\n\nScott was born on November 30, 1937, in South Shields, Durham (now Tyne and Wear), England, but grew up in West Hartlepool, England. He attended the West Hartlepool College of Art and the Royal College of Art in London, England. After graduation Scott worked as a set designer and director in British television. In 1967 he began to direct commercials for his own company. Ten years later he started to direct feature films, including The Duellists (1977). That film won the best first-feature award at the Cannes film festival. His next three films were fantasies. The first, Alien (1979), was a science-fiction-horror story. Next came Blade Runner (1982; recut 1992), a grim dystopian fable based on a Philip K. Dick novel. The film starred Harrison Ford. It was followed by Legend (1985), an allegorical fairy tale.\n\nScott’s next several films were set in contemporary times. They included the thrillers Someone to Watch Over Me (1987) and Black Rain (1989). Scott received his first Academy Award nomination for his work on Thelma and Louise (1991), a road film with a feminist theme. After a string of critical and commercial failures, he directed Gladiator (2000), which starred Russell Crowe in the title role. The action drama was a critical and commercial success. It won the Academy Award for best picture and earned Scott his second Oscar nomination for best director. Scott’s next film, Hannibal (2001), was a box-office hit despite poor reviews. The military drama Black Hawk Down (2001) was nominated for four Academy Awards, including best director."
