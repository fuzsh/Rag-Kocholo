        "text": "Its Alien Day in El Paso, TX and the rest of the world so lets celebrate that big ole nerd, director of the Alien franchise and MANY other films, Ridley Scott!!\n\nWell kind of. I love the Alien movies but one of the facts about Ridley Scott that I forget, OFTEN, is that he had the opportunity to direct a movie written by one of the most prolific and widely respected authors in American history!!\n\nYeah, Cormac McCarthy, the guy who wrote books like The Road, No Country for Old Men, and Blood Meridian actually wrote 3 movies in his lifetime too!\n\nCormac wrote the screenplays for a 1977 TV movie called The Gardeners Son, an HBO movie from 2011 called The Sunset Limited, and Ridley Scotts 2013 film entitled The Counselor. Unfortunately, despite McCarthy's critical acclaim in the literary world, his track record for screenplays is a little rough.\n\nTHE GARDENER'S SON\n\nHis first film, The Gardener's Son, was very split when it came out. People were on both sides, some arguing it was too long and filled with too much obscene language. One reviewer even called for the movie to be banned because it had too many curse words for the time. Some reviewers praised it and loved its thick historical references. Ultimately, it didnt do much to stick in the minds of viewers and really hasnt garnered much attention since its TV release.\n\nTHE SUNSET LIMITED\n\nThe Sunset Limited actually did fairly well! The writing was praised as well as the performances by the two main actors, Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones. The script was hefty and filled with lots of philosophy about life and death however, so it didnt do as well with mainstream audiences.\n\nTHE COUNSELOR\n\nThen we arrive at what is probably considered a flop. The Counselor, Ridley Scotts crime thriller that really didnt thrill many people. It actually wound up boring quite a few folks and was considered more of a drama than a crime thriller. Cormacs writing was called out for being clunky and wordy, and aside from performances from some incredible actors like Michael Fassbender and Benicio Del Toro, the movie really didnt garner much attention past the big names connected to it.\n\nInterestingly enough, some of The Counselor actually takes place here in El Paso! Which makes sense, because Cormac McCarthy is from Texas and has included El Paso in many of his other works too! Honestly, Id recommend McCarthys books over his movies but thats just my preference!"
