        "text": "By Dennis Hartley\n\n(Originally posted on Digby’s Hullabaloo on July 13, 2019)\n\nSomeone to Watch Over Me – Shout! Factory\n\nThis crime thriller may be one of director Ridley Scott’s less-heralded (if not nearly forgotten) films but is one of my favorite neo-noirs of the 80s. The 1987 release stars Tom Berenger as a married NYC police detective from a working-class neighborhood who is assigned to bodyguard a Manhattan socialite (Mimi Rogers) after she becomes a key witness in a murder case. Initially, their relationship is strictly professional, but…well, you know.\n\nGranted, the narrative may be somewhat familiar, but the film is stylish, sumptuously photographed (by Steven Poster), and well-acted (Berenger and Rogers have great chemistry, and Lorraine Bracco is a standout as Berenger’s wife).\n\nThe transfer is gorgeous. Extras include interviews with Poster and screenwriter Howard Franklin (no commentary track)."
