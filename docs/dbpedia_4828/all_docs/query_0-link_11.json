(Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)\n\nClaire Gregory has accidentally witnessed a murderer committing his crime. Fortunately she manages to escape and New York cop Mike Keegan is assigned to protect Claire. He risks his job and his marriage when he falls in love with Claire. Will he find the murderer and will he save his marriage? (Harald Mayr)\n\nA married New York cop falls for the socialite murder witness he's been assigned to protect. In Queens, Mike Keegan (Tom Berenger) is celebrating with his wife Ellie (Lorraine Bracco), his son Tommy and friends his recent promotion to detective in a precinct in Manhattan. Meanwhile, in a fancy club, the socialite Claire Gregory (Mimi Rogers) witnesses the murder of the owner of the place by the powerful mobster Joey Venza (Andreas Katsulas). Mike is assigned to protect her in the night shift in her apartment in Manhattan. When Venza threatens Claire, the contact of Mike with Claire gets closer and conflicts him, dividing between the love for his family and the heat passion for Claire and the fascination for her world. (Amazon.com)\n\nThis stylish, smart 1987 movie stars Tom Berenger as a New York cop and family man who falls for the rich and beautiful witness (Mimi Rogers) he's assigned to protect. Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) does something here he should be doing a lot more often: directing contemporary film noir with his eye for extraordinary art direction. Berenger and Rogers rise to the occasion, seemingly aware that they're making something special. (Tom Keogh, Amazon.com)"
