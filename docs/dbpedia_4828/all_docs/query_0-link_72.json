        "text": "Director Ridley Scott was the subject of BBC arts programme Omnibus in 1992.\n\nTitled Eye of the Storm, it was first shown on UK television around the release of 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992).\n\nAlthough there is a certain irony that Scott’s career suffered a dip soon after (until his renaissance with Gladiator in 2000), it is a solid profile filled with various collaborators, including David Carradine, Sigourney Weaver, Mimi Rogers, Michael Douglas and his two sons Jake and Luke.\n\nAmongst the things discussed are:\n\nHis first short film Boy and Bicycle (1962)\n\nBBC years\n\nThe Advertising Years (including the Michelob ads that Stanley Kubrick loved and the famous Hovis commercials)\n\nThe Duellists (1977)\n\nAlien (1979)\n\nBlade Runner (1982)\n\nThe Famous Apple Commercial (1983)\n\nSomeone to Watch Over Me (1987)\n\nBlack Rain (1989)\n\nThelma and Louise (1991)"
