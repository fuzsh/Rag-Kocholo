        "text": "April 30\n\n23:23 Nova Pazova - All windows were shaking, I don`t know was it from a detonation or a missile flew over\n\n23:05 NOVI SAD - I am more and more convinced that CNN voting is set up, the percentage of votes is always the same, it is a little strange to me it never changes for 1 percent at least, even if in their favour\n\n22:26 TV Monte Negro has just released a video on the consequences of bombing of the small town Murina. Up to now 4 civilians were taken out of the ruins, while 8 injured people are in a hospital in Berane. They also\n\nreported that NATO criminals have bombed this town again around 19:00 and destroyed the bridge on the Lim.\n\n22:10 CELJE - SOMETHING HAS JUST FLOWN OVER -I THINK IT WAS NATO PLANES FORMATION!!!!\n\n22:04 CELJE - Good evening Yugoslavia, here we are in the game again! They are coming to you at very high altitudes (cca 8 -10000m) judging by the sound. There are not many of them (2-4). I think they were bombers, but don`t take my word for it! GOOD LUCK!!!\n\n21:59 According to unofficial report of Elmag TV in Podgorica, today afternoon the bridge on the Lim was bombed in the small town Murino on the north of Monte Negro. The bridge was linking Monte Negro with Kosovo, to be\n\nmore precise: that is the route Berane -Murino -Cakor-Pec. One person was killed and several children injured. The missile fell onto the nearby village Gornja Rzenica.\n\n21:55 Novi Sad - The refinery is burning still. There are no visible signs of the smoke disappearing. A high air pressure saved us.\n\n21:31 Novi Beograd - lightnings in the sky (meteorological) so it is possible the thing heard a few moments ago as a remote explosion were, in fact, thunders\n\n21:30 Ljubljana - 4 planes have just flown over Ljubljana. I wish you a quiet holiday night For the PVO (Air Defence) of BELGRADE, UZICE AND OTHERS good luck!!!!!!!!\n\n21:28 I saw with my own eyes: LIGHTNING, PEOPLE, LIGHTNING. have we all forgotten what is the function of St.Ilija? I have personally seen a lightning falling down on Batajnica, and then my computer was reset. Then\n\nthere were lightnings 2 more times. Paranoia is taking its due.\n\nP.S. the sign is blinking nicely, here, another lightning above New Belgrade 21:30\n\n21:16 Beograd - Air Raid Alert\n\n21:10 Novi Sad - At least 3 markers are visible in the sky above Novi sa every time before they bomb the refinery. Several minutes ago there were several lightnings behind Fruska Gora (we have the picture, we don`t have\n\nthe sound). The sky is clear above Novi Sad, I don`t know what`s the weather like in Srem - maybe it`s only thunders.\n\n21:09 It has begun in Batajnica and the alert siren has not screamed yet. Planes were heard too, 5 minutes ago. Detonations from the direction of Pazova\n\n21:05 Boston, USA - American Senat will be voting on May 3 re a decision that would authorize Clinton to use \"all necessary forces and other measures\" in Kosovo. Effectively, this would authorize him to do what he wants without anyone`s approval. The majority in the Senat are Republicans,\n\nalthough some of them support Clinton. I predict a tight vote. Unnecessary to say, that decision is very bad for us. As for finances, he was approved 12,5 billion dollars - twice as much than he asked for. A huge part of it will go for salaries of fat asses in the fascist armada!\n\n21:05 Stara Pazova - 3 detonations within 5 minutes\n\n20:52 Ljubljana - It is rather quiet in the sky over us here, but those in Washington say they will intensify their `activities` on May 1st. Prepare fireworks for the capitalist swines to remember it.\n\n21:04 At 21:00 exactly 3 detonations heard near batajnica. Air Raid alert still not on. Planes heard and PVO activity.\n\n21:03 Something flew over Petlovo Brdo and Vidikovac. Probably AWACS. Total darkness. Very low. Half of Rakovica has no electricity. Come on, PVO. It`s\n\n20:56 now\n\n20:44 PVO fighting over Borca\n\n20:07 Beograd - End of Air raid alert\n\n20:07 Beograd, Konjarnik - fromhere we can clearly see bigtall dense smoke on the right from Avala. I cannot determine what is burning because it is dark.\n\n19:57 Podgorica - During the 3rd attack of the NATO aviation the bridge on teh Lim has been destroyed, near Murino. 3 people were killed and 6 injured\n\n19:44 UPI reporter is just retelling, I repeatL retelling, the interview he got fro President Milosevic\n\n19:40 In Brussels Shea stated that NATO has declined the piece offer.\n\n19:35 I am just looking at the smoke in Zemun\n\n19:23 George Bush said on CNN that very soon cracks would become emerging within NATO, between Europe and USA.\n\nSince the man was CIA director for 20 years and Reagan`s vice-president for 8 years, I suppose he knows what he`s talking about.\n\n19:16 A report just said at 16:45 NATO criminals bombed a small village Murina on the north of Monte Negro. Their target was the bridge on the Lim, along the regional road Andrijevica - Pec. In that attack they missed the bridge, but hit civilian buildings and there are civilian casualties. Unofficially 4 killed people and many injured, among whom are children, too.\n\n19:07 Beograd - 3 explosions\n\n18:49 Beograd - Air Raid alert\n\n18:30 A plane flew over at high altitude towards Bosnia. It launched a missile in the region of the Macva village Salas Nocajski.\n\n17:26 Novi Sad - smoke still rising from the refinery\n\n17:15 Guberevac - I want to correct the information about Ladjevci. The warehouse was hit in Vitanovac village near Kraljevo. A bus was hit, too - 8 people injured. After they were taken care of in the hospital Kraljevo, 4 of\n\nthem were released to go home.\n\n17:14 Nis, Podgorica, Arandjelovac, Kraljevo, Pozarevac - Air Raid Alert....\n\n16:46 The report on destroyed bridges is partially correct... the OLD BRIDGE on the Zapadna Morava was hit, the one connecting Tratenik with the village Grabovac... As I have heard here, 1 woman was killed, 8 people were\n\ninjured.... The windows are broken at almost all buildings in the centre of the town....\n\n16:45 I am correcting the information regarding Ladjevci. Warehouse was bombed in Vitanovci near Kraljevo and a bus heading for Kragujevac. 8 passengers were injured. All of them were taken care of in Kraljevo medical centre.\n\n16:39 Information about the old bridge in Trstenik being destroyed is confirmed. It was bombed with 6 missiles in several runs. There are many broken windows in Trstenik. New bridge has only been damaged.\n\n16:17 Today, near Kumanovo, a jeep with French soldiers was attacked with an anti-tank missile RPG17. Unfortunately, it missed :( . Two people were arrested as suspects for throwing the bombs in front of the French military\n\nbarracks in Kumanovo a couple of days ago.\n\n15:15 I am denying the information from Cacak about a detonation from the driection of Ladjevci. Most probably it was a detonation from the direction of Pozega. In the last 2 hours planes were flying over several times at a\n\nrelatively low altitude\n\n15:05 End of Air Raid Alert\n\n15:00 from Trstenik - not checked out messag that 2 bridges on the Z.Morava were bombed and windows broke on surrounding buildings\n\n14:45 from 13:05 till 14:45 noise of planes heard in Pozega, and of activities near the town, PVO was acting\n\n14:45 Around 13:00 strong attack in the direction of Loznica (looking from Krupanj). Several strong detonations heard in western part of Serbia. They say the target is to be Gucevo again, the hill near Loznica. It is quiet in Krupanj...\n\n14:39 Pozega - once again our PVO was fighting vehemently! All that lasted about 15 minutes.\n\n14:32 Toronto - CNN just reports Americans are sending several more B-52 bombers, which are to start next week the so-called \"carpet bombing\" .\n\n14:35 Detonation fromt he direction of Ladjevci, another one. Planes are flying south from Kragujevac towards west-east. No smoke from Ladjevci.\n\n14:30 A plane noticed launching 2 missiles in the direction of Trstenik.\n\n14:20 Trstenik - 4 planes noticed at high altitude\n\n14:12 Podgorica - 2 detonations\n\n14:10 I`m writing from Kragujevac outskirts. Planes are flying over, for some time now, the area between Kraljevo and Kragujeac. A couple of strong detonations heard from the direction of Kraljevo, several minutes later from\n\nthe direction of Kragujevac too. But I talked to my friends in Kragujevac, no missile has fallen there by now. That`s it for now.\n\n14:10 Two detonations from the direction of Nis. Before that - breaking of the sound barrier.\n\n14:05 Pozega - from 13:00 until a moment ago, a series of strong detonations, together with PVO activity for the first time around here. I guess the village Prijanovici was bombed again (military barracks and fuel reservoir), but the sound barrier was definitely broken several times.\n\n13:50 I am denying the information a missile fell on the embankment near the hotel Jugoslavija. !\n\n13:39 Cacak - Strong detonation from the direction of Ladjevci, before that a plane was heard\n\n13:36 Detonation just heard around Nis\n\n12:39 NEIC - American National Earthquake Information Center, world centre for earthquakes, has just confirmed the following earthquake:\n\nNort-west region of the Balkans - 04:30:38 of Central European time, 44,07 north latitude, 20,27 east longitude: earthquake class B (medium class), intensity 5,3 Mb (Mb - intensity of \"underground waves\"). Detailed\n\ninformation on\n\nhttp://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/bulletin/\n\n12:26 Windows on the gymnasium \"Stevan Puzic\" in Ruma and the surrounding residential buildings broke last night because of NATO attacks. There are no casualties, but the material damage is enormous.\n\n12:20 Beograd - Air Raid Alert\n\n06:30 The earthquake that shook us all well and woke all people who had just managed to fall asleep, was felt around Serbia, all the way to Novi Sad. From Monte Negro they report that the epicentre was 230km north of Podgorica, 7 degrees of the Richter`s scale. Here in Belgrade it was at\n\nleast 6 degrees Merc. scale Therefore, it was not in Romania, but somwehere in Yugoslavia.\n\n06:30 Novi Sad - the earthquake was shaking the earth here. Smoke from the refinery, dense like never before, is still rising.\n\n06:25 NIS - End of air raid alert 10 minutes ago\n\n06:15 Beograd - Studio B reports the earthquake was some 60km from Belgrade, 5 Merc. scale something like that, I`m not sure. It has not been confirmed officially yet.\n\n06:09 Beograd - End of another barbarian attack\n\n6:09 Beograd. end of air raid warning.\n\n05:28 BEOGRAD - STRONG, SHORT, EARTHQUAKE. REAL EARTHQUAKE\n\n04:52 My friends who live at the corner of Cerska and Vardarska st. have sent me the following message: at the time of the detonation we were talking. There is no more Vardarska, the crossroads Maruliceva and\n\nVardarska, Maksima Gorkog and Maruliceva. From the first one we digged out a woman and a man was thrown out of the house with a broken arm\n\n04:35 Damn the rain. Started tor ain and then stopped. Still, it is good it is cloudy at least. Otherwise, we can watch RTS in Nis again. It has started to rain again now. For people in Nis and some others who receive the signal of TV BELLE AMIE, the movie \"Brave Heart\" is on now. Symbolic, isn`t it?\n\nF...k...the rain has stopped again. Take care!!!!!\n\n04:25 To confirm for the location near Crveni Krst, near the elementary school Milica Pasic, a missile has by mistake hit a civilian building. It seems it was some restaurant or a caffe, near the car-service, unfortunately it is most probable there are casualties\n\n04:24 Beograd - queit at the moment. Material damage enormous. It is impossible to estimate because of the dense smoke... According to the reports the worst situation is in K.Milosa and Sarajevska streets, where huge layers of glass, bricks, malter are scattered around... All windows are broken on many buildings in this part of the town... There are killed and injured people, firemen and others have withdrawn because of possible new attacks... The worst thing, really, is that it is very difficult to breath, and there are indications that the criminals have bombed with missiles that contain depleted uranium (unofficially) ...The image is HORRIBLE.\n\n04:05 Studio B has reappeared again. Its broadcasting was interrupted because of the electricity breakdown.\n\n04:10 Planes were circling above NIS 7-8 minutes and then left. Good. It has just started to rain. Even better. Before that the night was clear with a full moon, so it was light as during the day. I think they have missed their chance for tonight."
