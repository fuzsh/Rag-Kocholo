Unfortunately, the Respqndents did not respect thisposition of the\n\nCourt. They did aggravate and extend the dispute.\n\n10. By its Orders made on 30 June 1999,the International Court of Justice in\n\neach of the cases concerning Legality of Use of Force (Yugoslavia v. Belgium,\n\nCanada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal and United Kingdom)\n\nhas fixed the time-limits for the filingof the written pleadings ofparties.

DUEto suhstanrial and technical reasons, the Applicant has prepared an\n\nidentical text of the Memorial in all eight pending cases. The substance of\n\ndispute in all eight cases is identical. There are some differences concerninthe\n\njurisdictionof the Court among some ofthe cases which will be indicated in the\n\nrelevant part of the Memorial. Whereas all Respondents are in the same\n\ninterest, according to Article 31, para. 5, of Staoftthe Court, theyshouId, for\n\nthepurpose of the nomination of ad lzocjudge, be reckoned as one party only.\n\nAlternatively, for the said purpose, Belgium and the Netherlands are in the\n\nsame interest; Canada, Portugal .and the United Kingdom are in the same\n\ninterest; and France, Gern~anyand Italy are in the same interest,\n\n12.Since the Orders of the Court, .dated 2 June 1999, the dispute aggravated\n\nand extended. Ztgot new .elements concerning failures of the Respondents to\n\nfulfill their obligat~onsestablished by Security Council resoIution1244 and by\n\nthe 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the rime' of\n\nGenocide. Negating the alleged humanitarian motives of the Respondents, the\n\nnew elements areof crucial importance for the substance of thedispute.\n\n13. The substance of the dispute isrelated to the State responsibility.The\n\n. Respondents have breached and are breaching some of the most important\n\ninternational obligations and they are responsible for that. Accordingly, the\n\nApplicant will show that the breached obligations are in force between the\n\nApplicant and the Respondents, the acts of breaches of these obligations,\n\nimputation of the acts to the Respondent and the existence of the jurisdiction of\n\nthe Court.\n\n14. The Memorial is structured in four parts. The Part One contains the\n\nstatement on facts. Part Two consists of statements on the Iaw. PartThree is\n\nreferring ,to the jurisdiction of the Court. And the Part Four presents\n\nconclusions and submissions.\n\n15.The dispute is very complex, containing a great number of elements. But,\n\nlegally it is not so much complicated.The large number of factsrelated to theI\n\nbombing or to the killing,wounding and expulsion of Serbs and other non-\n\nAlbanian groups in Kosovo and Metohija are confirmed hy the Respondents.\n\nBesides, the NATO Press Conferences, held during the aggression, are a rich\n\nsource of relevant information. Transcripts of the Conferences are available at\n\nNATO web;site on the INTERNET. Concerning the law, the Applicant hases\n\nitsposition on the legal statementof the Court in previous cases.\n\n16. Due to the fact that the dispute matured, through the new elements, the\n\nApplicant considers that the circumstances related to the jurisdictionof the\n\nCourt have changed so that theCourt has the jurisdiction to sesoIthe dispute.\n\n17. The dispute isof great importance for the partiesinvolved and for mankind\n\nas a whole. The judgment of the Court, declaring responsibility of the\n\nRespondent, would be to the benefit not only for the Applicant but to the\n\nfurther sound development of internationalrelations in general. 1.
