        "text": "For almost two centuries, monasteries of Ovcar-kablar gorge attracted attention of many researchers, artists, believers, and in recent times they became pull factors for modern tourists. These monasteries along with natural beauty of Ovcar-Kablar gorge and healing properties of Ovcar-Kablar Spa, make an extremely important area and tourist potential. Although Ovcar-Kablar monasteries by overall artistic achievements are behind Serbian medieval work of art, not many people can remain indifferent for their beauty and spirituality. The appearance of these temples (ten monasteries and two holy places) can be determined only approximately, which leaves a lot of space for numerous assumptions. In opinion of historians Ovcar-Kablar monasteries were built in the late XIV century, during the arrival of The Sinaite monks in Serbia. Monasteries of Ovcar-kablar gorge suffered numerous wars and destruction, but they still represent a place which keeps the true value of Orthodoxy. As religious and cultural-historical objects of great importance these monasteries attracts more and more visitors every year, leading to needs for tourism valorization, since the basic religious functions of monasteries should not be disturbed. Also, care should be taken about tourism impact on active life of the monastery and the environment. According to destination needs in this paper work author will present tourist valorization of these monasteries applying Quantitative and Qualitative research method and Hilary du Cros method. As a final conclusion will be presented comparative analyze of both results.\n\nIn Macedonia there are more than 1500 churches and monasteries with more than 150000 square meter fresco-painting, a collection of icons is one of the most valuable in the world, and after Sinai and Moscow is the third most important in Orthodoxy, which is a great precondition for the development of the monastery tourism in the earth. The justification of the research for this paper stems from the need for planning the sustainability of this type of tourism, who’s important segment is, of course, the valorization, is the evaluation of the value of the objects from the aspect of tourism. Valorization should be carried out on all religious objects in order to hierarchically align them based on their value, which will give directions in strategic planning for the development of this type of tourism. This will determine which of them are leading in the overall tourism product of the country, and in which they have yet to invest. The subject of valorization in this work is the monastery ...\n\nWhen it comes to tourism, cultural heritage keeps gaining attention and interest. A tourist's wish to learn more about the destination he is visiting is mirrored in his growing demand for cultural landmarks from different historical periods, from the oldest-to the most recent ones. Today, tourists do not decide only on one content, it is usually enriched with a whole spectrum of new ones. In the context of cultural heritage, new approaches have a special role in the development of tourism, so all of the aspects of its influence are being taken into consideration. The presentation and conservation of cultural heritage can contribute to the development and advancement of local and regional communities. In terms of tourism, each space is more interesting if cultural heritage has been integrated into the spatial development (in the level of development). An important segment of development and advancement of cultural tourism is the sustainable use and management of cultural potentials. The paper explores the capability of including cultural heritage into cultural and tourism policies. It presents and describes the tourism potential of the historically and artistically important urban wholes of Aranđelovac, a city with a preserved historical heritage. The municipality and town of Aranđelovac belong to the district of Šumadija in central Serbia. Aranđelovac occupies a territory of 375.89 km 2 , of which 15.75% of the total area of the Šumadija district (2.386.71 km 2) belongs to the municipality of Aranđelovac. Aranđelovac is situated at the foot of Bukulja Mountain (696 m), at about 250 m above sea level, where the river Kubršnica has its springs. Apart from its natural beauties, this area is known for its historical importance and abundance of cultural monuments. This is why the aim of our paper is to introduce landmarks such as the Risovača cave, Bukovička spa, Marićevića jaruga, the Church of Saint Archangel Michael near Aranđelovac, the Church of Saint Archangel Gabriel with a memorial fountain and plaque in Bukovik (just to name a few) to the public, and to point out the tourism potential of those places. Tourism is becoming one of the leading branches of economy in the world today, and its development can be based on natural and cultural-historical values of cities. Owing to tourism, the conservation of natural, cultural and historical values (in municipalities like Aranđelovac) can be achieved in accordance with the economic potential it owns.\n\nEach village in Romania has a number of features that can be points of analysis and benchmarking in terms of local touristic profiling. Some of them, by their age can be an interesting case study in terms of cultural values they have. While selecting the types monument could establish touristic profile of the geographical area concerned. Each county has a great tourist offer, materialized in cultural and religious monumentsdating back several centuries. It is necessary to differentiate between religious monuments representing the material remains of different periods, thereby identifying thus not only the age, but also the architectural style of the cult, the density and ratio of the religious constructions, the enrollment in current artistic painting influences received regarding their construction and architecture. Making differences on points of structure enables the classification of each type that can be developed here, according to CTU – The Indicator of their Usage on Cultura...\n\nThe aim of the research is to determine the tourist value of the medieval fortresses of Belgrade, Smederevo and Golubac, which are located along the course of the Danube through Serbia, that is, to evaluate tourist attractiveness of all those occurrences, objects and spaces which define the tourist value of this kind of resource and heritage. Relying on the analysis of defined elements of the qualitative-quantitative procedure of tourist valorisation, the paper indicates the causes of a low level of tourist attractiveness and distinctiveness of the analysed monumental complexes, as well as the guidelines and activities which should be undertaken in order to rebuild and organise this kind of cultural heritage.\n\nReligion has been and continues to be a major component for the ecumenical travels. A main factor in the development of this phenomenon is also the existence of a vast and diversified religious tourism potential (monasteries, convents, churches etc.). Although the analyzed region is noticed due to the development of the climateric and balneary tourism, the religious tourism could contribute, in the future, to increase the number of tourists, as well as the economic growth. The study aims to analyze precisely this opportunity, unexplored enough, because the existing religious attractions, although known in the whole country, have not been included in the travel programs. An object of the paper is to make an assessment of the religious tourism potential in the Vâlcea Subcarpathians area, analyzing the ways and opportunities for the recovery and development of this potential, and also the perception of tourists on the religious attractions and the satisfaction degree for the offered se..."
