        "text": "The national identity as the basis for the creation of the national state represents the basic raison d'Etat, or state reason, in order for that state to be powerful, and to be able to realize its interests on an international level, that is, to be a factor in international politics. However, unlike Europe, where the idea of a national state and national identity originates from, in the Balkans the identities of nations have been used to spread nationalist propaganda aimed at not recognizing neighboring nation-states, as well as highlighting the superiority of some in relation to others, using and modifying history in the process. This paper has two goals; to indicate the basic idea of national identity, as a pillar of the nation state, that is, as the main goal for the institutional strengthening of the state, the strengthening of its influence in international politics; as well as to explain the difference in the perceptions of the nation-state, i.e., the identity of the nation between Europe and the Balkans.\n\nTurkey and Albania's common historical past is a determining factor in their bilateral relations. This common past is also utilized as a source of their identity construction. This common past is not an objective, scientific or absolute phenomenon; it is rather a constructed tool which can change due to tensions and detente in policies. Learned perceptions and prejudices are based on the seperation between we and they and they play an important role in bilateral relations. This study assumes that there is a strong relation between both countries' Europeanisation/Westernisation processes and discourses of the other. This study is also based on the argument that mutual perceptions can effect foreign policy. Thus in this study we offer a comparative analyzes of the foreign policies and discourses of the other in Turkey and Albania through a constructivist lens.\n\nStructurally located within the same geographic region, Turkey has been inevitably under direct or indirect influence of changing conjunctures in the Balkans. The Balkans is in the Turkish political actors’ political agendas for various reasons, but the identity- and security-related ones appear on the top of the list. In this regard, the identity-security nexus has not only embodied identity consolidation of Turkey’s traditional foreign policy’s through westernism, but also affected Turkey’s geopolitical orientation towards the Balkans during the Justice and Development Party (JDP) period, so called neo-ottomanism. Additionally, security seeking requirements in changing conjunctures, made the nexus prominent. Drawing on this perspective, the present study aims to understand the main dynamics behind Turkey’s geopolitical orientation towards the Balkans with a special focus on the geostrategic importance attached to the Balkans in the period between the establishment of the republic and the JDP period. In line with this aim, the study provides an overview of above-mentioned critical conjunctures and their reflections on Turkish politics.\n\nBuilding of the national identities of the Balkan countries was, and still is considered as extremely controversial process in the European history. Reason for such qualification rises from the fact that in some cases nation building processes are analyzed out of the local/regional, historical and cultural contexts and they are compared to other in many cases completely different contextual, nation building processes. In this sense they are not considered as individual, national and/or cultural processes but merely as political issues and goals which are supported, “confirmed”, and which should gain “approval” and acceptance from the wider European and world community. In the past century we have perceived and witnessed many Balkan nations rising and building their national identities in a different ways. But there were also some that, no matter what they do, they were constantly disputed. That is the case of the Macedonian nation building processes which is a pure example of how can political issues and appetites in different historical periods interfere on the long run in the nation building and how this situation can influence the life of the people keeping them “imprisoned” and depending on the good will of the “great” powers. On one hand truing to constantly keep up with the contemporary changes and on the other hand grasping on to the past, Macedonians as well as other Balkan nations, in the last couple of decades underwent the process of re/building, revival and/or reconfirmation of their own national values and their own national identities.\n\nThe concept of identity has become a key analytical concept in the social sciences in recent decades. Both in scientific accounts and in everyday use, the concept of identity has traditionally been seen as possessed by individuals and thus, groups of individuals. However, this view has been severely criticized by the identity section of the social sciences, where these individuals view different social roles as their own when discussing identity and examining relationships with others. This is especially true after the break-up of Yugoslavia, also for the Serbian state, which has been \"self-seeking\" for nearly 30 years. This is also true when we examine Serbian national identity from the perspective of European Union integration and also in terms of the sustainable security and geopolitical situation in the Western Balkans.\n\nThis paper aims to examine the contemporary understanding of identity, culture, and political order of the contemporary Balkans both from within the country and from an external viewpoint. From such a research perspective, an attempt is made to explore the essential relations between national and cultural identity important for nation-building as a formative process of the creation of a political nation(s) in the region. It points out different aspects of these relations. At fi rst glance, national and cultural identity appear to be two opposing categories; categories that are mutually exclusive. As a matter of fact, these are two sides of the same coin in the sense that they are the face and the reverse of one value. The paper also explains various approaches to nationalism as a dominating narrative in the region that still casts its spell on both categories, as well as on political culture essential for nation-building, democratisation and, fi nally, authentic perspectives for European Union membership.\n\nWith the end of the bipolar structure, states wanted to guarantee their places in the system through European Union in the Balkans. Serbia is one of the important states in the Western Balkans that hardly adapted to the changes in the system because of the Serbian nationalism. This article will discuss the reasons for the delay in Europeanization process of Serbia referring to the concept of nationalism, which had the greatest influence on Serbia's EU process. This study will explain why Serbia's path towards European integration has been so much difficult. After analyzing the dissolution process of countries from Yugoslavia, it will focus on the two important theories which are identity convergence and identity divergence mechanisms in order to better analyze the European integration of Serbia. This article will reveal Serbia's reluctance to accept European nationalism by exploring the role of the national identity concept on the Europeanization process. This article concludes that, the transformation of domestic policies that are linked with the EU were failed in Serbia, identity divergence mechanism became a driven force in delaying rapid EU enlargement and political leaders' strategies became unsuccessful to pursue EU norms and standards. In this research paper, a qualitative study was conducted using methodological pluralism and historical comparative research methods."
