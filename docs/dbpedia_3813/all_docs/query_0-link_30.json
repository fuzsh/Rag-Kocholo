It's on now.\n\n9 Yes.\n\n10 THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Can you hear me now?\n\n11 JUDGE MAY: Yes.\n\n12 THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] I said that I hope and assume that,\n\n13 according to the Rules you explained to me, I won't be interrupted.\n\n14 I should like to start off by saying -- by showing a videotape,\n\n15 so I'd like to show a video first and then I'll continue speaking after\n\n16 that.\n\n17 JUDGE MAY: Yes. Let that be done.\n\n18 [Videotape played]\n\n19 JUDGE MAY: Can we get a translation? Can we have a translation\n\n20 of this, please? Can the interpreters assist?\n\n21 THE INTERPRETER: The tape is very fast and the interpreters do\n\n22 not have the text of it, but we'll do our best.\n\n23 JUDGE MAY: Thank you. Yes, let's play the tape again.\n\n24 [Videotape played]\n\n25 THE INTERPRETER: [Voiceover] \"Allegedly for humanitarian reasons,\n\nPage 226\n\n1 people in Yugoslavia still suffering from the effects of war, the\n\n2 poisonous uranium dust and unexploded bombs are jeopardising the situation\n\n3 in Kosovo. The ecological consequences of the war cannot even be\n\n4 foreseen. It is well known that the war has not solved the situation in\n\n5 Kosovo but aggravated it. An important reason for the war was the alleged\n\n6 massacre in Racic. From the beginning, there were doubts with respect to\n\n7 that question, doubts which, after the latest research, has become ever\n\n8 more clear. A report will follow.\n\n9 \"The name in this village in Kosovo is Scorbac [phoen] but it is\n\n10 known as Racak. The Serbs suffered a terrible massacre here, a massacre\n\n11 which led to the attack by the NATO aviation. It occurred in 1999. The\n\n12 head of the verification mission of the OSCE arrived with a number of\n\n13 television crews. They found 44 bodies. Walker said this is a massacre\n\n14 and the result of a civil war between the Serbs and the other inhabitants.\n\n15 Many people were also wounded.\n\n16 \"I need several minutes to gather my thoughts. But what did\n\n17 actually happen in Racak? Here at the university in Pristina, the\n\n18 pathologist examined the bodies, and there was doubt that what happened in\n\n19 Racak was indeed a massacre. We hear her talking for the first time for\n\n20 television, Helen Ranta. I'm conscious of the fact that the whole\n\n21 scene was rigged and that is something that it is possible to do. There\n\n22 were many indications of this in the course of our initial investigations,\n\n23 forensic investigations later carried out on the spot in 1999, and the\n\n24 results of those examinations were sent to the International Tribunal in\n\n25 The Hague.\n\nPage 227\n\n1 \"Ambassador Walker came to Racak on a Saturday. This was his\n\n2 personal decision, and he qualified the event as a massacre. I\n\n3 systematically avoided the use of that term massacre myself. There is\n\n4 suspicion that it was indeed a massacre, but what could have led up to\n\n5 this event in Racak? Among the dead in Racak were members of the -- Racak\n\n6 was a stronghold of the KLA, and I'm sure that there are many pieces of\n\n7 information to show that in Racak there were undoubtedly conflicts between\n\n8 the Serb forces and the KLA.\n\n9 \"There's no doubt about that. [Interpretation] Apart from that, I\n\n10 was told and I read about this, too, that on that place on that day, KLA\n\n11 fighters were killed.\n\n12 \"What happened in Racak: From the 15th of January, 1999, Serb\n\n13 soldiers went round the streets of Racak. Only later were the 44 bodies\n\n14 to be found. Whether the alleged massacre was a result of the conflict\n\n15 between the Serb forces and the KLA, we're not sure. Here is what another\n\n16 member says: 'We saw the Serbs coming, we took up our positions and\n\n17 opened fire. We thought that they would take it out on the civilians\n\n18 after every one of our attacks as retaliation. Racak, the result of\n\n19 Provocation by the KLA.'\n\n20 The State Department and Washington, a person well known, with\n\n21 secret reports in the US administration, says the following: 'They will\n\n22 be represented as victims in the world to allow for the West's\n\n23 intervention.'\n\n24 \"German Defence Minister quoted Ambassador Walker. In this\n\n25 secret report of the German Defence Ministry pertaining to the situation\n\nPage 228\n\n1 in Kosovo, it says, 'The Albanians were probably killed in an attack by\n\n2 the Serb police on the 15th of January, 1999.' One day later there was an\n\n3 addition to this. Walker acknowledged, on the 22nd of January, in\n\n4 Pristina, that when he toured Racak he was not informed of all the\n\n5 circumstances surrounding the event. Racak and the United States of\n\n6 America was the main news item, and Mr. Walker made the following\n\n7 statement:\n\n8 \"This stepped up the world opinion that something had to be done,\n\n9 and this was the beginning of the developments that led to the bombing,\n\n10 ultimately. The dead in Racak, I don't think we will ever learn the real\n\n11 truth, but the air attacks and airstrikes covered the silence.\"\n\n12 \"This is what Heinz Loquae had to say:\n\n13 'Walker collected up a number of journalists. He went to the spot\n\n14 and, after a short period of time, said that what had happened was a\n\n15 massacre of the Serbs, in fact. At that particular moment, he was not\n\n16 able to make a judgement of any kind. This opinion was taken over by the\n\n17 OSCE, the United Nations, and all the governments of the world. One day\n\n18 later, NATO held a meeting. It was an extraordinary meeting, and this was\n\n19 quite unusual. With his conduct, Walker had ignited the flame for war, a\n\n20 war which was to be a violation of international law, a war in which many\n\n21 civilians paid with their lives, a war for which German politicians hold\n\n22 the responsibility. What really happened in Kosovo? What was the\n\n23 propaganda used to deceive German public opinion?\"\n\n24 THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] There's more.\n\n25 [Videotape played]\n\nPage 229\n\n1 THE INTERPRETER: [Voiceover] \"Dear fellow citizens, NATO this\n\n2 evening began its airstrikes against military targets in Yugoslavia.\n\n3 \"The alliance will stop the further violation of humanitarian\n\n4 rights.\n\n5 \"Yugoslav President Milosevic is waging a merciless war over\n\n6 there. We are not waging war, but we have been called upon to find a\n\n7 solution, a peaceful solution, but even with the use of military means.\n\n8 \"This footage shows that the population from the very first days\n\n9 of the war in Kosovo were led astray, deceived. This is how the facts\n\n10 were turned upside down in order to manipulate and to lie. This film\n\n11 shows why the bombs fell on Belgrade. The lies began.\n\n12 \"NATO claimed that it threw the bombs to protect the lives of the\n\n13 Kosovo Albanians, but when the first bombs fell, we saw scenes of this\n\n14 kind. The Serbs who were afraid went to take cover in the basements and\n\n15 the shelters that existed in town, although there were few of them. The\n\n16 presenter of a Serb radio said that a group of planes were nearing\n\n17 Belgrade, and asked the citizens to turn off all the lights.\n\n18 \"Attention. Attention. A large group of enemy planes are\n\n19 approaching Belgrade. Citizens please take cover and wait.\n\n20 \"The fear was visible in Serb children even before the bombing\n\n21 actually began. These are images taken by Yugoslav television. The fear\n\n22 of war is indivisible. One -- this is the picture of war.\n\n23 The NATO power knew the power of images. The most important thing\n\n24 is that the enemy has the monopoly over pictures and images which would\n\n25 show the world public NATO's tactics and not Milosevic's.\n\nPage 230\n\n1 \"Rather than the deliberate brutalities being inflicted ...\n\n2 [Interpretation] Many journalists said that Milosevic has pictures, too,\n\n3 and words, but who do we believe? [In English] Pictures or the words.\n\n4 [Interpretation] Next time, when CNN or anybody else shows the columns of\n\n5 refugees, I will be able to say that I believe them. But you see this,\n\n6 mass graves, people who were intentionally killed and thrown into those\n\n7 mass graves. [In English] Whose side are you on?\n\n8 \"But NATO didn't have the pictures of the mass graves. All it\n\n9 had was these pictures of Albanian refugees from Kosovo. And you can see\n\n10 fear and suffering on the faces of these people, just as you could on the\n\n11 others a little while ago. But what do these pictures tell us? What do\n\n12 they show? Do they help NATO? Do they act as an appeal saying, 'Save\n\n13 us?'\n\n14 \"Is not human suffering a terrible thing? Human rights to Kosovo\n\n15 Albanians, is that a priority or not?\n\n16 \"German Defence Minister Rudolf Scharping explains in 1999 why he\n\n17 sent German soldiers into the war in Kosovo:\n\n18 We would never have taken military steps had a human catastrophe\n\n19 not taken place with 200.000 refugees in Kosovo and over 400 refugees, and\n\n20 the number of dead as yet unknown, countless dead even before the NATO\n\n21 bombing. The OSCE, European Security and Cooperation Organisation, should\n\n22 have known this because its observers in Kosovo reported regularly about\n\n23 events there in March 1999. One of the reports said there were 39 dead.\n\n24 Was a humanitarian catastrophe imminent?\n\n25 \"German generals or American diplomats who were in Kosovo had the\n\nPage 231\n\n1 following to say:\n\n2 'The basis for German's legitimacy in its participation was the\n\n3 humanitarian catastrophe. A humanitarian catastrophe of this kind as an\n\n4 international legal category which would justify intervention in Kosovo\n\n5 existed before the war.'\n\n6 \"Up until the beginning of the NATO airstrikes, there was no\n\n7 humanitarian catastrophe. Of course, humanitarian problems did exist.\n\n8 There were a great number of refugees, but this is how it was. People\n\n9 left their villages when Serbs took action against the KLA and then\n\n10 returned to their own homes. The fact is that it was common knowledge\n\n11 that a humanitarian -- that people knew that a humanitarian catastrophe\n\n12 would take place only when the bombing began. We are discussing this\n\n13 problem on the spot.\n\n14 \"I am giving judgement. No reports from the OSCE speak of an\n\n15 imminent humanitarian catastrophe. The situations that did exist on the\n\n16 ground are similar to the images we are showing now: forces fighting\n\n17 against regular army units, a civil war. That is what the OSCE said in\n\n18 its report.\n\n19 \"The inhabitants of villages would flee in the face of onslaughts\n\n20 of this kind. Later on, for the most part, they would return to their\n\n21 homes, which were frequently destroyed.\n\n22 \"NATO in Brussels was informed with the OSCE reports which\n\n23 coincided with its own reports. However, these details and knowledge were\n\n24 not made public knowledge at any of the numerous press conferences. On\n\n25 the contrary, at the last meeting of NATO, on the 14th of March, 1999,\n\nPage 232\n\n1 before the war broke out, they said that we -- that it could be said that\n\n2 the violence came from terrorist actions by the KLA, and the Serbs reacted\n\n3 overly violently. But at that time, they thought that the situation could\n\n4 be kept in check. Nevertheless, NATO forces did prepare for an\n\n5 attack on Yugoslavia. At the same time, the German Defence Ministry held\n\n6 meetings but they, too, did not think that a humanitarian catastrophe was\n\n7 imminent. And in the Defence Ministry's documents with respect to the\n\n8 situation in Kosovo, it said something different to what Rudolf Scharping\n\n9 said. Here we have a quotation from a secret report, intelligence report\n\n10 of the German Defence Ministry. In the past few days, there were no\n\n11 significant clashes between Serb forces and the KLA. The Serb security\n\n12 forces limited their actions to routine operations, the control and\n\n13 patrolling of the area to check for weapons and checkpoints on the main\n\n14 roads.\n\n15 \"But preparations were nonetheless underway for an attack. When\n\n16 the first bombs fell, however, the NATO countries did not lend\n\n17 whole-hearted support to the drive.\n\n18 \"The political leaders now took the lead. They were the\n\n19 democratic representatives of the people and knew what news items were\n\n20 important for their countries.\n\n21 \"Rudolf Scharping really did a good job. It wasn't an easy one,\n\n22 especially for Germany for whom, for the past 50 years, defence was the\n\n23 only security of the country rather than intervention by their soldiers.\n\n24 Psychologically viewed, this new definition of a security policy is not\n\n25 an easy one. Not only Minister Scharping, but Chancellor Schroeder. They\n\nPage 233\n\n1 were excellent examples of political leaders and in their attempts to\n\n2 shape public opinion, and I'm very happy that the Germans understood this.\n\n3 With all the collateral damage taking place, they remained on course. Had\n\n4 we lost German public opinion, we would have lost public opinion in the\n\n5 whole alliance.\n\n6 \"The fight for public opinion was stepped up. Wartime propaganda\n\n7 for domestic purposes was no longer sufficient. Pristina, the capital of\n\n8 Kosovo, was the scene of wartime propaganda, with the focus on the\n\n9 football stadium and we can see destruction and vestiges of destruction\n\n10 around the stadium today, although the grass is being tended.\n\n11 \"At the time, the Serbs had a camp for Albanians in this area, and\n\n12 Rudolf Scharping spoke to the public in 1999, making this assertion. It\n\n13 is much more important what is happening in Kosovo now when we hear that,\n\n14 in Northern Pristina, there is a concentration camp, when I hear that\n\n15 teachers and pupils are being rounded up and the teachers killed in front\n\n16 of their pupils' eyes, when the Serb inhabitants are being appealed to\n\n17 write up a big capital letter 'S' on their homes so as not to be expelled.\n\n18 No civilised European must close his eyes to facts of this kind.\n\n19 \"The letter 'S' for the protection of the Serbs in Pristina did\n\n20 not exist on the doors of Pristina either in the underground passages of\n\n21 the football stadium. There might just have been a football here or\n\n22 perhaps a cigarette end.\n\n23 But Rudolf Scharping, even after the war, in his journal, he spoke\n\n24 about numerous prisoners being held here. And Germany's Foreign Minister\n\n25 compared the Serbs to the Nazis on many occasions.\n\nPage 234\n\n1 \"Up until the present day, Scharping and Fischer have remained by\n\n2 their views. I said that there was every reason to believe that people\n\n3 were held in the underground passages of the stadium.\n\n4 \"We tried to clarify this issue but we have statements by\n\n5 eyewitnesses. If somebody knew anything about this, it must have been\n\n6 Kelmendi, a Kosovo politician. His house is right by the stadium.\n\n7 \"As you can see for yourselves, we have a good view of the stadium\n\n8 from here. You can see everything. I didn't notice a single prisoner at\n\n9 that time. The stadium was just -- was just used as a Heliodrom.\n\n10 And while he's talking to us, we can see a team emerging on the\n\n11 stadium.\n\n12 \"You can helicopters landing here, that's all. Helicopters\n\n13 landed and the soldiers got out of them. They boarded the helicopters and\n\n14 got off them. The football stadium in Pristina, a concentration camp?\n\n15 No. That was wartime propaganda and something that had been concocted.\n\n16 \"I would like to say that a comparison with Auschwitz and the\n\n17 situation in Kosovo is a -- is outrageous. I'm ashamed as a German that\n\n18 German Ministers are uttering things of that kind. And I think Germans\n\n19 could be taken to court for uttering similar phrases. When the German\n\n20 Minister speaks about concentration camps in Kosovo, that is on the same\n\n21 line as saying that concentration camps are a historical situation and\n\n22 existed during the Nazis in Germany. I think that it is unheard-of that\n\n23 the Germans were the ones to use comparisons of this kind.\n\n24 \"This is not the only wartime lie that went into the world in\n\n25 order to obtain support from the rest of the world. This is Rogovo, a\n\nPage 235\n\n1 small village in Kosovo. It remained virtually intact during the war.\n\n2 Now two years later, people are involved in agriculture again, everyday\n\n3 village life. However, Rogovo has this special importance for the war in\n\n4 Kosovo.\n\n5 \"The story starts at the farm of Sefik Berisha. This, a story\n\n6 that would hit the headlines in far away Germany at a later stage. This\n\n7 is the 29th of January, 1999, two months before the NATO airstrikes began.\n\n8 Neighbours all of a sudden heard shooting from the direction of Berisha's\n\n9 house. What happened? Then on the 29th of January, the following thing\n\n10 happened: It was a Friday, 5.00 in the morning, when this started in my\n\n11 neighbour's house, in Berisha's house. Bursts of gunfire were heard from\n\n12 automatic rifles. This lasted for three or four hours. We woke up. We\n\n13 heard all of this. Three or four hours later, the shooting abated.\n\n14 \"About 10.00, a group of policemen came up to us from this\n\n15 direction. My father and I saw them. When they came about 50 or 60\n\n16 metres away from us, I had no other way out but to flee. I went in the\n\n17 opposite direction.\n\n18 \"This drilled minibus, bullet-riddled, reminds of us of these\n\n19 days. However, what did happen in Rugova? A massacre of Serbs over\n\n20 innocent civilians. That's what Rudolf Scharping said. Two months later,\n\n21 on the 27th of March, 1999, the Minister of Defence presented his\n\n22 evidence.\n\n23 \"What we are showing you now requires good nerves, however, this\n\n24 shows the brutality with which all of this started. When you look at\n\n25 these photographs, you will be able to see easily what this was all\n\nPage 236\n\n1 about. You can see the uniforms of the Serb special police. This clearly\n\n2 shows that Serb special forces and the Serb army took part here, and later\n\n3 on, hard criminals.\n\n4 \"These are terrible images, and I have to do my best to control\n\n5 my voice in order not to explode.\n\n6 \"This is what we are waging war for. That's what the headlines\n\n7 said in the newspapers that also carried the photographs. However, his\n\n8 co-workers knew that this had not been a massacre. The secret\n\n9 intelligence reports said that this was not a massacre over innocent\n\n10 civilians.\n\n11 \"On the 29th of January, one Serb policeman and 29 Albanians\n\n12 were killed in Rugova. This was, therefore, a conflict, not a massacre as\n\n13 the Minister of Defence had claimed.\n\n14 \"These images on the footage made by a Western TV station offer\n\n15 proof of what had actually happened. Military equipment and arms by the\n\n16 bodies of the alleged civilians who were wearing military boots with signs\n\n17 of the KLA. However, what happened before the Western journalists came?\n\n18 \"The example -- as far as the example of Rugova is concerned,\n\n19 what did you actually base this on?\n\n20 \"Well, on the reports of the observers who first came there.\n\n21 \"Did you paint a direct picture of what happened in Rugova as\n\n22 things actually happened?\n\n23 \"Yes, this is quite correct. The first observer of the OSCE who\n\n24 arrived is this man on the left-hand side. That is a German policeman,\n\n25 Hennig Hensch.\n\nPage 237\n\n1 \"It is correct at any rate what the Minister of Defence said on\n\n2 the first day in his statement, that I heard and saw on Dojcevele and this\n\n3 does not actually coincide with the way I had portrayed things to him.\n\n4 \"The official report about the events in Rogovo makes no mention\n\n5 of a massacres over civilians. This is where we found a bullet-riddled\n\n6 minibus with a total of 14 bodies. Three bodies were outside the\n\n7 vehicle.\n\n8 \"In the garage, there were five more bodies of KLA fighters in\n\n9 uniform.\n\n10 \"Three hundred metres away, we found four more bodies. The bodies\n\n11 that were shown by the Minister of Defence, we gathered them altogether in\n\n12 one spot, the Serb policemen, I, and two of my Russian colleagues.\n\n13 \"This is how this video footage was made concerning the alleged\n\n14 execution, as Minister Scharping had put it, nothing that have anything to\n\n15 do with the actual way these events evolved. It was quite clear that this\n\n16 was no massacre over civilian population because, according to OSCE\n\n17 reports, even KLA commanders stated that fighters for the great Albanian\n\n18 cause had lost their lives there. However, the German Minister turned\n\n19 this into a massacre.\n\n20 \"New York, April 1999. While Scharping was talking about a\n\n21 non-existent massacre and a concentration camp that had never existed, the\n\n22 process was proceeding at full steam. In Germany and the United States, a\n\n23 war atmosphere was being created because NATO strikes were against\n\n24 international law. Only the UN would have the mandate to wage this kind\n\n25 of war. However, there was no mandate of this nature.\n\nPage 238\n\n1 \"The security people were very busy then because heads of state\n\n2 or government were meeting. And the debates behind closed doors were\n\n3 becoming increasingly sharp.\n\n4 \"April 1999, in the United Nations debates were going on about\n\n5 the war. At the same time, airstrikes were proceeding. Six thousand\n\n6 times in total, without approval of the United Nations. This is no\n\n7 surprise because the policy of the United States is very well known in the\n\n8 United Nations and also its attitude toward the world organisation.\n\n9 \"Already in 1993, Clinton, in a secret report, pointed out what\n\n10 America's policy would -- was charted in a report. If necessary, we will\n\n11 go with the UN. If necessary, without them. So NATO had to decide on\n\n12 behalf of the UN rather than having things the other way round. The\n\n13 intervention in Kosovo took place without the mandate of the UN and this\n\n14 is obvious violation of international law. The German Minister of Defence\n\n15 took part in this. But why?\n\n16 \"An important American advisor had access to secret American\n\n17 plans.\n\n18 \"Some of the administration members involved in foreign affairs\n\n19 said that Kosovo was only the beginning for future wars that NATO would\n\n20 wage in far away countries. Washington did not care about presenting its\n\n21 leading role in NATO because it was never questioned. We have seen that\n\n22 NATO was gaining a new role which was quite different for the reason why\n\n23 it had been established, which had originally been a defensive role.\n\n24 \"This is the premises where NATO meets. Was NATO supposed to\n\n25 turn into a new policeman of the world? As far as the United States is\n\nPage 239\n\n1 concerned, that is perhaps a usual stand, but it would be difficult to\n\n2 explain it to the American public and the world public because the war in\n\n3 Kosovo was increasingly being criticised, especially when the aircraft\n\n4 missed military targets and hit columns of people who were moving. They\n\n5 called it collateral damage, but the public became increasingly critical\n\n6 vis-a-vis the NATO strikes, especially in Germany.\n\n7 \"The beginning of April 1999, NATO headquarters, and now calls\n\n8 were being made to restrict collateral damage.\n\n9 \"After the column of refugees at Djakovica was attacked, the\n\n10 approval of the public in many countries, including Germany, went down by\n\n11 20 per cent. We had to work hard in order to win the confidence of the\n\n12 public once again. Milosevic made a mistake when he started expelling the\n\n13 Albanian population to Macedonia and Albania. There were these streams of\n\n14 people crossing the border and there were TV crews filming all of this at\n\n15 the borders, and that is how the public came to support NATO efforts once\n\n16 again.\n\n17 \"These are the images that Jamie Shea was referring to. And\n\n18 these documents were Milosevic's mistaken war propaganda. Images of\n\n19 Albanian refugees at the Yugoslav-Macedonia border, every evening, in\n\n20 every news programme, this kind of footage could be seen, suffering and\n\n21 expulsions. However, in Germany, obviously, these pictures were not\n\n22 sufficient. Now it was being said that the Serbs had planned the ethnic\n\n23 cleansing of Kosovo for a long time. The killings in Kosovo got a name, '\n\n24 Operation Plan Horseshoe.'\n\n25 \"I'm now going to talk to you about what happened for months,\n\nPage 240\n\n1 ever since 1998 on the basis of the Horseshoe operation plan. Some parts\n\n2 show that the Serb army had not only prepared the expulsion of the\n\n3 Albanian population but that this had actually begun. This shows that\n\n4 these systematic actions had been planned in October 1998 and carried out\n\n5 in January 1999.\n\n6 \"This was supposed to be this operation plan. The Serb units,\n\n7 deployed in the shape of a horseshoe, surround Albanian civilians and\n\n8 expel them. Before the bombing, Serbs were systematically carrying out\n\n9 actions against the Albanian civilians. That's what this brochure said,\n\n10 and this image was there to support it. However, the date here says April\n\n11 1999, that is to say, after the NATO strikes began. That is why what\n\n12 happened in the village of Randubrava is no proof whatsoever of the\n\n13 existence of a plan called Horseshoe.\n\n14 Randubrava today. There are very few signs of war. This is\n\n15 reconstruction. Tiles that are covering roofs now, the villagers got\n\n16 them from a German organisation. However, was it really the Serbs that\n\n17 attacked the village and torched the houses as Minister Scharping had\n\n18 said? In that case, that would have corroborated the existence of plan\n\n19 Horseshoe.\n\n20 \"The villagers left the village after the 25th of March, after\n\n21 the NATO airstrikes. In the evening, we received orders from the KLA that\n\n22 we were supposed to evacuate the population. On the 26th of March, here\n\n23 in this village, there was no one left. We took everyone to the village\n\n24 of Malusha, and it was only then that the Serbs shorted shooting. We\n\n25 were fighters of the KLA. We were defending ourselves but this was\n\nPage 241\n\n1 impossible. We were helpless against tanks and guns.\n\n2 \"There were 85 fighters in all, but there were other people, too.\n\n3 There was a total of 120 fighters.\n\n4 \"This has little to do with planned expulsions of a civilian\n\n5 population. Was Minister Scharping dispelling -- dispensing with the\n\n6 truth in his brochure?\n\n7 \"It is not easy. After all, there were witness statements as\n\n8 well. There are people who fled. There are people whose lives were\n\n9 threatened and who testified nevertheless. There were no OSCE monitors\n\n10 there before the fighting started.\n\n11 \"Rudolf Scharping, in his brochure, does not only refer to the\n\n12 village of Randubrava as proof of the operation of Horseshoe. Another\n\n13 village was attacked but this photograph was also taken in April 1999,\n\n14 when the airstrikes had already begun.\n\n15 \"This is where the village is, the one that is mentioned by the\n\n16 Defence Minister in his brochure. However, the village is not Crkvice but\n\n17 Krsnica.\n\n18 \"Even nowadays traces of the war can be seen. Many houses were\n\n19 razed to the ground. The 100 or so villagers will need a long time to\n\n20 rebuild their village.\n\n21 \"Thank you, say the children in the German language, because the\n\n22 construction materials came from the German humanitarian organisation over\n\n23 here as well. In Pregadica [phoen], the Serbs wanted to destroy the homes\n\n24 of these children forever in a particularly perfidious way, says the\n\n25 brochure. First the Serbs would light a candle by the roof and then they\n\nPage 242\n\n1 would turn on the gas in the basement. However, this was not a reaction\n\n2 to the airstrikes but to the operations related to Horseshoe plan, says\n\n3 Scharping, that is to say, planned destruction before the NATO attacks\n\n4 began. However, in Pregadica, people seem to remember something else.\n\n5 \"All of this happened already in June 1998. There were many\n\n6 people there from the Yugoslav army then who were getting closer from the\n\n7 direction of the neighbouring village. However, we managed to turn the\n\n8 army back. Then we attacked them and we opened fire from heavy weapons.\n\n9 And this went on for four days -- four weeks. Practically, there was not\n\n10 a single place where a shell had not fallen. That is the way it was\n\n11 throughout this area.\n\n12 \"The destruction took place in June 1998. However, according to\n\n13 Scharping's words, Milosevic elaborated Horseshoe plan only later in\n\n14 December 1998. What happened with the candles and the gas that Scharping\n\n15 was talking about? \"No. The houses in our village was not torched in\n\n16 that way. This happened in different ways, but not in that particular\n\n17 way. The houses were ablaze because of the shelling, but not due to\n\n18 candles and gas that were lit.\n\n19 \"Again, there is no proof of this alleged Horseshoe plan, but\n\n20 there is evidence of manipulation and forgery by the Ministry of\n\n21 Information. This story that Serbs were entering villages and turning on\n\n22 the gas on the ground floor and lighting candles by the roofs and the\n\n23 attics show that this method does not work at all. You can't really torch\n\n24 a house that way. Really? No, this doesn't function that way.\n\n25 Chemically, physically. No way. This must be information that\n\nPage 243\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 244\n\n1 you got from eyewitnesses which is either incorrect or that not checked at\n\n2 all. Therefore, I would recommend to you that you do this test once again\n\n3 but not with a gas but with a gas bottle. However, neither of the\n\n4 variants worked. Gas is heavier than air. The Minister also noticed how\n\n5 easy it is to detect such lies and manipulations. Later on, photographs\n\n6 of these two villages were shown once again but without the mentioned\n\n7 texts.\n\n8 \"This is an edition from 1999, and that text was removed\n\n9 altogether.\n\n10 \"May 1999. This is the second month of the war. There are more\n\n11 and more German pilots preparing to take part in the attack, and we know\n\n12 that it was civilian targets that were hit, not only military targets.\n\n13 NATO used especially destructive bombs in Kosovo. Despite the unpopular\n\n14 regime in Belgrade, the German public opinion began to wonder whether the\n\n15 war intervention in Kosovo was justified.\n\n16 \"Despite Scharping's assertions that Operation Horseshoe existed,\n\n17 there was not enough proof to bear that out.\n\n18 \"Two years after the war, we asked Rudolf Scharping once again\n\n19 what happened with Operation Horseshoe. We had intelligence information\n\n20 which I received at the beginning of April 1999 via the Foreign Minister.\n\n21 I asked our experts to check out that information and to compare them with\n\n22 information from the electronic surveillance service for intercepting Serb\n\n23 paramilitary formations, which was done. And only when this comparison\n\n24 confirmed our suspicions, we used them publicly.\n\n25 \"I asked for a meeting in the Defence Ministry, and a meeting was\n\nPage 245\n\n1 accorded me in November. They told me that there was no Operation\n\n2 Horseshoe in existence but just that the events in Kosovo were shown\n\n3 events that had already taken place, and we were able to check those\n\n4 events out on the basis of OSCE reports. Operation Horseshoe or Potkovica\n\n5 did not exist. That's what the experts at the Defence Ministry told me.\n\n6 \"These are the Albanian refugees from Kosovo, the victims of the\n\n7 Serbs, but not as the results of the Horseshoe operation. This was just a\n\n8 fabrication of the German Defence Ministry. Wartime propaganda, just as\n\n9 the alleged concentration camp in Pristina was or the massacre of\n\n10 villagers in the village of Rogovo. The suffering of civilians was also\n\n11 the consequence of NATO strikes.\n\n12 \"The political debacle of the war in Kosovo was now being talked\n\n13 about, but the German government did want to involve its soldiers in the\n\n14 operation, and it had to win over public opinion. But the fate of these\n\n15 people was unknown. What would happened to them, nobody knew.\n\n16 \"In the past, the German military leadership was often criticised\n\n17 for keeping silent where they ought to have spoken out. I wanted to say\n\n18 something, too, faced with a situation of that kind. I did not wish to\n\n19 leave propaganda of this kind intact, untouched. However, lies and\n\n20 propaganda are very often stronger and more powerful in wars. It is the\n\n21 weapon with which truth is slain.\"\n\n22 THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] This is just an atom, even smaller\n\n23 than an atom, of the truth, even less than an atom of the truth in the\n\n24 ocean of lies and the product of propaganda and the abuse of global media\n\n25 as a means of war against my country.\n\nPage 246\n\n1 You have heard the German general, and we selected Germany on\n\n2 purpose, Germany, England, their broadcasts. We did not show Serb\n\n3 programmes. We don't know those people, but you heard the German general\n\n4 who said he was ashamed as a German of how his government behaved. And as\n\n5 you read all my mail - I get a lot of mail and I'm sure it gives you a lot\n\n6 of work - then I'm sure you were able to read the letters of American\n\n7 officers who are ashamed of their own government, the letters I received\n\n8 from English intellectuals and soldiers ashamed of their own government,\n\n9 letters from French war veterans who are likewise ashamed of their\n\n10 government, and so on and so forth.\n\n11 In the West, where we see a complete media darkness, if I can use\n\n12 that term, when it comes to Yugoslavia, because world global networks have\n\n13 been assigned the task of being an instrument of war and of disinforming\n\n14 the public. In the West, people of this kind are raising their voices\n\n15 increasingly frequently, people who like truth more than the comforts\n\n16 they get from a mute implementation of the tasks assigned them by their\n\n17 bosses. And I'm sure that the public will realise this, that these voices\n\n18 will become ever louder, the voices of truth, and that the shame will be\n\n19 ever greater, the shame that falls on those who lied about Yugoslavia and\n\n20 who used a media war to make a front detachment of war, a war in which\n\n21 people died, a war in which there was great destruction. But let me move\n\n22 on and say what I wanted to say.\n\n23 This is the first opportunity that I have been given, after seven\n\n24 months here, to address the public.\n\n25 Over the past two days, all the Prosecutors that we have heard\n\nPage 247\n\n1 here have uttered one particular sentence; that is to say that they are\n\n2 just trying an individual, that it is an individual who is on trial here.\n\n3 Now, that is a very sensitive -- it is a sensitive point to link this up\n\n4 with a nation, with a people. So they're trying an individual and not a\n\n5 nation. All three Prosecutors said that. But in all the indictments,\n\n6 they are accusing the whole nation, beginning with the Serb\n\n7 intelligentsia. They have accused the Serbian intelligentsia, led by the\n\n8 Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences. And we even heard quotations from\n\n9 the memorandum issued by the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences which\n\n10 were allegedly the ideological groundwork and foundation for the crimes\n\n11 committed against the Albanians. We are talking about a memorandum in\n\n12 which Serbian academicians set out the situation honestly, and that was 15\n\n13 years ago now. They spoke responsibly about -- and authoritatively about\n\n14 the situation in Kosovo.\n\n15 But the fact that they have accused the Serbian academy and\n\n16 Serbian intelligentsia is just one aspect. They are accusing St. Vidovdan\n\n17 and the battle of Kosovo Polje. They have even made the remark that they\n\n18 don't know what it is we celebrate and why these 2 million people rallied\n\n19 together at the field of Kosovo Polje to celebrate their 600th anniversary\n\n20 when we lost that battle. What he does not know is the following: That\n\n21 is to say, if he can accuse Serb history and the battle for Kosovo, it was\n\n22 a battle for Serbs and for Europe, for both Serbia and for Europe. But it\n\n23 is not only the Serb intelligentsia and the Academy of Arts and Sciences\n\n24 and the St. Vidovdan battle of Kosovo, but everybody who lent support, the\n\n25 government, the parliament, the various political organisations, the\n\nPage 248\n\n1 media. They all stand accused here. All this stands accused. The\n\n2 citizens stand accused, citizens who lent their massive support and\n\n3 elected their representatives at free party elections.\n\n4 We just agree on one point here, that my conduct was the\n\n5 expression of the will of the people. But the Prosecution is accusing the\n\n6 population of supporting me and let me say that my behaviour here is an\n\n7 expression of the will of the citizens as well, the will of the people.\n\n8 They are accusing the army and the police, the volunteers and the\n\n9 Territorial Defence. And as he says so himself, he will be referring to\n\n10 these collectively as Serb forces, and that is what the Prosecutor has\n\n11 indeed done.\n\n12 He has accused Serbia and all Serbs who supported me in Serbia and\n\n13 those Serbs who supported me outside Serbia, and all the people who\n\n14 support me in Serbia to this day. And then he is accusing the people, the\n\n15 nation.\n\n16 We have heard all this in the past two days. We have heard\n\n17 everything.\n\n18 And then he says that he is just accusing an individual, and that\n\n19 individual is myself. And he probably thinks that I am superhuman, having\n\n20 these superhuman powers of influencing people and responsibility and\n\n21 accountability outside the territory of my own country. He has subscribed\n\n22 to me some magical God-like powers, and he keeps dealing with my emotional\n\n23 state, what was in my head, what I wanted to achieve, and things of that\n\n24 nature.\n\n25 The Americans go right the other side of the globe to fight\n\nPage 249\n\n1 against terrorism. In Afghanistan, a case in point, right the other side\n\n2 of the world. And that is considered to be logical and normal, whereas\n\n3 here the struggle against terrorism in the heart of one's own country, in\n\n4 one's own home, is considered to be a crime.\n\n5 That means that you are not master in your own home, that you\n\n6 can't react to terrorism in your own home. And I'm going to show the\n\n7 nexus, the link between the two.\n\n8 In this false indictment, they have gone even further than\n\n9 anybody's imagination could have forecast or conjured up. They even\n\n10 claim, and we have heard this over the past two days, that I intentionally\n\n11 caused the NATO aggression and war against Yugoslavia and the sufferings\n\n12 of millions of its citizens for the sole purpose of using this occasion to\n\n13 kill the Albanians. Now, I have to ask myself, Could they have thought up\n\n14 anything more intelligent?\n\n15 They even go further. Yesterday we heard the following: They say\n\n16 I was not interested in any borders but just one single border, the border\n\n17 between what was Serbian and not Serbian, the Serb and the non-Serb,\n\n18 although it is precisely Serbia, and indeed Yugoslavia, which throughout\n\n19 those years of the Yugoslav crisis was the sole country, the only country\n\n20 on the territory of the former Yugoslavia in which there was no national\n\n21 discrimination and which wholly preserved its national structure. It is\n\n22 exactly the same as it was 12 years ago when the crisis broke out.\n\n23 Yugoslav reality shows that this terrible position is incorrect,\n\n24 this terrible fabrication. So these nebulous constructions we're going to\n\n25 have to hear here, but we're going to shut our eyes to the Yugoslav\n\nPage 250\n\n1 reality. And it is not only present-day reality, but it has been reality\n\n2 for more than one decade. And it is precise and completely -- renders\n\n3 null and void nonsenses of that kind.\n\n4 Serbia, and I personally, therefore, are alleged to be waging a\n\n5 political genocide outside Serbia. But this policy of genocide somehow\n\n6 does not seem to exist in Serbia for which we are solely responsible,\n\n7 because as the President of Serbia, I am responsible for Serbia. Whereas\n\n8 they want to ascribe to me responsibility and accountability for\n\n9 everything that they themselves did and all the crimes that they\n\n10 perpetrated themselves. They claim, and I have been listening and hearing\n\n11 this for the past two days, and I consider the defence to have been a\n\n12 heroic defence. Our defence was a heroic defence, a heroic defence from\n\n13 an aggression launched by NATO, the NATO pact. But this was only a mask\n\n14 for us to use the occasion to commit crimes against Albania. Now, this is\n\n15 an outrage against a whole people, against a whole nation. It is\n\n16 insulting to a whole nation.\n\n17 What you are doing is taking a fact, a fact that is common\n\n18 knowledge to this whole world, to this whole planet of ours, and that fact\n\n19 is the day and night bombing of Kosovo. Day and night bombing, 24 hours,\n\n20 round the clock, every day for 78 days at which the alarm was sounded\n\n21 every day. People were on the alert for 24 hours. Now, they wish to\n\n22 negate that fact by bringing witnesses here who are going to say that they\n\n23 in fact fled from Serb forces, as you call the army and the police.\n\n24 Now, this well-known fact, a fact that is well known to each and\n\n25 every citizen on this planet of ours, will be denied and challenged by\n\nPage 251\n\n1 witnesses who will be coming here and say, \"No, we didn't flee from the\n\n2 NATO bombs, we fled from Kosovo in the face of Serbian forces.\" And you\n\n3 saw a moment ago Western footage that denies this. You heard Western\n\n4 generals and there are many more of them. All of them will have to come\n\n5 here -- not have to come; many of them wish to come. They want to come to\n\n6 tell you and your bosses what the truth is, where the truth lies and what\n\n7 are lies. This is a whole construction, a prefabrication, and it is all\n\n8 lies.\n\n9 And this fleeing that you refer to, using the term \"deportation,\"\n\n10 that coincides with the bombing, too. In the indictment itself, the dates\n\n11 that exist there, they all coincide with the bombing period. So even that\n\n12 is proof that is yet further proof that this whole thing is a manipulation\n\n13 of facts and an attempt to make crimes appear as victims.\n\n14 NATO bombed and massively killed the Albanians themselves who were\n\n15 only returning to their villages, who did not listen to the KLA when the\n\n16 KLA told them to flee, because the KLA beat them and killed them,\n\n17 endeavouring to force them to flee because that was the conception that\n\n18 Mrs. Albright talked about. We are expelling the Albanians. That means\n\n19 that the Albanians have to leave Kosovo to -- for the world to see that we\n\n20 are the ones expelling them. Slogans were being thrown out from\n\n21 aeroplanes, written in the Albanian language, appealing to citizens to\n\n22 flee Kosovo, and the KLA did the same. And they killed those that set up\n\n23 resistance. Nonetheless, Albanians did return to their villages and did\n\n24 not want to flee Kosovo, and they remained in Kosovo. Those who were in\n\n25 the war zone and operations, of course they fled. They had to flee. They\n\nPage 252\n\n1 fled -- Serbs fled to Hungary. They fled to Republika Srpska. Many\n\n2 people who fled during the war went to Republika Srpska, for example. And\n\n3 I am -- and would you say that the Serb forces, according to the\n\n4 indictment, made them leave? You could make a construction of that kind.\n\n5 Perhaps in the next ten years, you will think up another accusation for\n\n6 something that your own people did.\n\n7 I really wonder whether there is a court that is going to look at\n\n8 78 days of bombing, day in, day out, and is there a court that is going to\n\n9 disregard that fact in favour of witness statements in which people say\n\n10 that they had to flee on the basis of this kind of a claim, that they were\n\n11 being expelled by Serb forces.\n\n12 I want to state here with full responsibility this horrible and\n\n13 incredible lie is being uttered by the Prosecutor as a means of crime.\n\n14 After all, perhaps the best would be for you to accept this lie uttered by\n\n15 the Prosecutor so that this whole farce could have that as its crown.\n\n16 What we have heard insults the intelligence of an average inhabitant of\n\n17 this planet.\n\n18 Yesterday we heard a composition, so to speak. Where there are\n\n19 deportations, there are killings there, too, as well. The truth is this\n\n20 is a conflict with terrorist, with terrorist bands, and also where there\n\n21 is bombing. And most often there is a conflict with terrorists and there\n\n22 are bombings. Because it was not a rare occurrence that terrorists, when\n\n23 they would set out during the war, would receive support from their allies\n\n24 who waged the war against Yugoslavia with them. So the truth is that\n\n25 where there is a conflict and where there is bombing or most often both,\n\nPage 253\n\n1 that is where one can see flights of the population.\n\n2 And then we have been listening to this interpretation for two\n\n3 days, this conflict with these bands and the bombing. And we heard this\n\n4 and saw this in Western footage, not Yugoslav footage. This is\n\n5 considered to be killings by the Serb forces. And when people were\n\n6 fleeing from these places of conflict, then this was qualified as\n\n7 deportation.\n\n8 I repeat, the population from Kosovo was expelled by the KLA\n\n9 because they ordered people to do so. They beat them, and they killed\n\n10 them. That was number one.\n\n11 Number two, NATO, through their airstrikes. That is the truth\n\n12 behind your story about deportations.\n\n13 And I want to say here something that everybody in Serbia knows.\n\n14 In the Serb tradition and in the tradition of the Serb military, a\n\n15 prisoner of war and an unarmed person is held sacred. Whoever violated\n\n16 this sacred principle has to be held accountable. However, this was not\n\n17 done by the military or by the police.\n\n18 I'm not trying to say that this had not been committed by some\n\n19 individuals or some groups, but this was not done by the army or by the\n\n20 police. The army and the police defended their own country with honour\n\n21 and chivalry. Armies and groups that may commit crimes exist\n\n22 anywhere in the world and are condemned and prosecuted anywhere. Such\n\n23 dirty crimes cannot be ascribed to an army, a police, a people, a nation,\n\n24 a country, their government. It is precisely the members of this army and\n\n25 the police who know the best how many terrorists had escaped from them\n\nPage 254\n\n1 precisely by mingling with civilians. They would actually see them from a\n\n2 few hundred metres away and they would easily recognise them in the masses\n\n3 of civilians because usually they were only wearing their underwear,\n\n4 having thrown away their uniforms so that they could escape. They all\n\n5 managed to escape because there was a strict prohibition from the top\n\n6 downwards because nobody was allowed to fire even at terrorists if this\n\n7 would endanger the civilians or even lead to their killing. A multitude\n\n8 of them escaped.\n\n9 The American representatives knew that full well, those who were\n\n10 criss-crossing Kosovo. And we talked to them about this. And of course\n\n11 the terrorists knew as well that the army and the police had strict orders\n\n12 that they were not allowed to open fire wherever there were civilians, and\n\n13 of course they abused this. And they easily escaped that way, having\n\n14 just taken off their uniforms. And then they would mingle with civilians\n\n15 and that's how they would run away. Many comments were made in respect of\n\n16 this. However, these orders remained standing.\n\n17 That is to say that the task of the military and of the police was\n\n18 to neutralise the actions of terrorists and to protect civilians at the\n\n19 same time, to protect citizens. All orders, all actions taken by commands\n\n20 and individuals corroborate this. After all, this fabricated deportation,\n\n21 could it have been organised, especially in massive proportions, without\n\n22 an order, without an organisation? And there was no idea of this nature.\n\n23 There was no action of this nature. This was never mentioned. Never, not\n\n24 in a single variant. Not even in the variant when a witness could be\n\n25 brought.\n\nPage 255\n\n1 Yesterday you heard witnesses who were calling TV stations and\n\n2 saying that they were not prepared to support what they heard reported\n\n3 from the courtroom yesterday. No way. They were phoning yesterday when\n\n4 they were watching the broadcast, when during your break here in this\n\n5 courtroom they would phone journalists and say, \"You have said\n\n6 such-and-such a thing. No way. I'm not going to testify. That's not\n\n7 the way it happened.\" Well, bring these witnesses. Let us finally hear\n\n8 who are these people.\n\n9 I personally am not going to prevent any witness from coming\n\n10 here. Whoever will speak the truth here will not say anything that is\n\n11 dishonourable or that has anything to do with my personality, my policy,\n\n12 and the work of my government. Nothing. And you can bring as many of\n\n13 them as you want.\n\n14 An incredible number of things have been mentioned here by way of\n\n15 proof. Please. Yesterday, I heard the following: Three generals had\n\n16 received decorations. Well, what's wrong with that? Several thousands\n\n17 people were decorated for having defended their country. We are the only\n\n18 country that managed to shoot down a so-called invisible NATO plane. When\n\n19 I saw it at the Wright-Patterson base and when I touched it with my own\n\n20 very hand, Holbrooke explained to me that they paid 2.5 million dollars in\n\n21 order to construct that. And then the commander of the base told me it\n\n22 costs $40 million nowadays. He was whispering in my ear and saying, \"He's\n\n23 lying. It costs at least 250 million now.\" This is a wonder of technical\n\n24 achievement and they said nobody could shoot it down. We managed to shoot\n\n25 it down.\n\nPage 256\n\n1 Well, this man who shot down an invisible aircraft that had come\n\n2 to sow death among children, didn't that man deserve a decoration? He\n\n3 deserved 50 decorations. Everybody who shot down a plane got a\n\n4 decoration. Everybody who shot down a cruising missile was decorated as\n\n5 well, all kinds of cruising missiles. All kinds of cruising missiles you\n\n6 used over Yugoslavia. And not to mention how many thousands, tens of\n\n7 thousands of sorties were flown. We heard the conversation between\n\n8 General Short, who commanded the air force from the base in Florence, and\n\n9 his son who was wounded. He was worried then. However, we will come to\n\n10 this in time and, after all, that tape also exists. In due time, that\n\n11 will be clarified like many other things over here.\n\n12 Several thousands of people in Yugoslavia were decorated for their\n\n13 courage in the war. Also, thousands of people were decorated for their\n\n14 efforts in the reconstruction of the country because only in a few months'\n\n15 time we managed through a superhuman effort of many citizens to\n\n16 reconstruct the country, to go back to a normal life, to try to go back\n\n17 to a normal life, including these people who had been misled and they did\n\n18 not know what they had been doing to their own detriment.\n\n19 I heard yesterday the Prosecutor literally mocking the fact that\n\n20 Serbia was not at war with Croatia or with Bosnia. Gentlemen, Serbia was\n\n21 not at war with Croatia or with Bosnia. Why do you want to make Serbia\n\n22 and Serbs responsible for the war in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina? And\n\n23 now in your indictment you have been moving from one event to another in\n\n24 Bosnia and Croatia and neither I, nor anyone in Serbia, know anything\n\n25 about this. Many people, as a matter of fact, in Bosnia itself hardly\n\nPage 257\n\n1 know anything about this except people locally. Of course, I'm not\n\n2 talking about major events. They just knew that there was fighting going\n\n3 on there, and that we were making an effort to make an end to the fighting\n\n4 as soon as possible.\n\n5 The corridor near Brcko. Why was it portrayed yesterday as some\n\n6 kind of a criminal operation, so to speak? It's included in the\n\n7 indictment. This corridor near Brcko was the subject of at least 50\n\n8 conversations between Owen and Stoltenberg and the representatives of the\n\n9 Muslims, Serbs, and Croats in Bosnia: Karadzic, Izetbegovic, Boban. I\n\n10 was present and so was Tudjman as well. At least 50 times this was\n\n11 discussed because this corridor by Brcko links eastern and western parts\n\n12 of Republika Srpska. When you look at the map, you will see this easily.\n\n13 The entire region of Banja Luka and the Bosanska Krajina communicate with\n\n14 the eastern part, and further to the east with Serbia through this\n\n15 corridor. This was a vital route all ways, and I don't see what the\n\n16 meaning of this is in this regrettable opus of yours.\n\n17 All of Bosnia-Herzegovina was actually a small-scale Yugoslavia,\n\n18 just as the big Yugoslavia consisted of several peoples, ethnic groups who\n\n19 lived together in harmony and developed. That is how Bosnia and\n\n20 Herzegovina consisted of Serbs, Croats, and Muslims.\n\n21 Your bosses broke up Yugoslavia, also the small-scale Yugoslavia,\n\n22 and now they want all three peoples in Bosnia on Herzegovina to foot the\n\n23 bill, all these people that they had pushed into a civil war, in order to\n\n24 keep the true responsibility as far away from themselves as possible, and\n\n25 this was a war that they had caused. After all, why were they forcing\n\nPage 258\n\n1 Bosnia to leave Yugoslavia if they didn't want a conflict? When they\n\n2 finally threw Bosnia out of Yugoslavia and when all three parties accepted\n\n3 the Cutilheiro plan for the organisation of Bosnia, why did they say to\n\n4 Izetbegovic that he should withdraw his signature? The US ambassador,\n\n5 Warren Zimmerman, who said that to him and could not deny it, wrote in his\n\n6 book that perhaps he had made a mistake when he said to Mr. Izetbegovic\n\n7 that he should do that. And that's how the war began.\n\n8 The war began by the killing of the father of a bride at a Serb\n\n9 wedding party that was moving through the centre of Sarajevo. The war\n\n10 started with the first killings of Serbs in various locations in Bosnia.\n\n11 The Serbs did not start a war. They did not start any conflict. That's\n\n12 the way it was in Croatia. The massacre in Borovo Selo, the massacre in\n\n13 Plitvice.\n\n14 There are true historic facts that speak of all of this, and it\n\n15 is nonsensical to accuse the wrong side.\n\n16 Now people speak of three peoples, three nations in\n\n17 Bosnia-Herzegovina, and this is a formula upon which Bosnia rests. And\n\n18 why did you accept a referendum in Bosnia without the Serbs if there are\n\n19 three peoples there, if before and now, the basic principle has been that\n\n20 something can happen only if all three peoples agree? Only when the\n\n21 succession of Bosnia was supposed to take place was it possible to do this\n\n22 without the participation of one people, and that is to say a people who\n\n23 owned more than a third of the territory, of the land of the country and\n\n24 also that comprised more than a third of the population of that country.\n\n25 Scholars will be coming here, academicians, if they dare come. Of\n\nPage 259\n\n1 course, I'm not saying this against them because we have just heard that\n\n2 they have been accused here as well as ideologues of some Serb crime. And\n\n3 yesterday the Prosecutor even suggested that ethnic cleansing in Bosnia\n\n4 was rewarded and that the territory of Republika Srpska was grabbed. I\n\n5 wonder what your objective here is, and why are you saying or how do you\n\n6 dare say that Kosovo borders with Serbia? Kosovo does not border with\n\n7 Serbia. Kosovo is Serbia. The Hague does not border with the\n\n8 Netherlands.\n\n9 Many things would have to be understood. If you don't understand\n\n10 them, then you should ask people who know, have someone explain this to\n\n11 you, that in any army, in any army that I know of, there is a principle of\n\n12 single command and that a single link is not missed in the chain of\n\n13 command when decisions are carried through. There is no anarchy. And if\n\n14 there is any deviation from this chain of command, this always results in\n\n15 a criminal act, and that is subject to appropriate sanctions.\n\n16 These stories of yours, who contacted which unit, whatever, all of\n\n17 that is nonsensical. If there was this kind of organisation, this would\n\n18 be the greatest possible chaos that anybody would be establishing. And\n\n19 who would organise and establish chaos in his own country?\n\n20 JUDGE MAY: Mr. Milosevic, it is time for the interpreters to have\n\n21 a break.\n\n22 THE ACCUSED: Okay. I would be glad to have a cup of coffee for\n\n23 your break.\n\n24 JUDGE MAY: We will adjourn for 20 minutes.\n\n25 THE ACCUSED: Half an hour.\n\nPage 260\n\n1 JUDGE MAY: Twenty minutes.\n\n2 --- Recess taken at 10.30 a.m.\n\n3 --- On resuming at 10.50 a.m.\n\n4 JUDGE MAY: Mr. Milosevic, we'll take the next break at 12.15.\n\n5 THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] In the break, I was informed that\n\n6 there was a portion of the tape, a small portion of the tape, that was not\n\n7 shown, so I should like to ask that the tape be shown in full and then I\n\n8 will continue with what I have to say.\n\n9 JUDGE MAY: Yes.\n\n10 [Videotape played]\n\n11 \"When Serb forces pulled out in the afternoon, they announced\n\n12 they'd killed 15 KLA men in the action. The international monitors\n\n13 entered the village and reported nothing unusual. Only next morning did\n\n14 the full force of Serb retaliation become apparent. William Walker went\n\n15 to see for himself.\n\n16 'We progressed up the hill and every 15, 20 yards there was\n\n17 another body. We kept going up the hill, and I don't know how many bodies\n\n18 we passed before we got to a pile of bodies.'\n\n19 \"By the time Walker arrived, the KLA had retaken control of Racak.\n\n20 \"I think it's going to take me a few minutes to determine what I\n\n21 really should say and I'd like to hold a press conference in Pristina\n\n22 later this afternoon.\n\n23 \"The facts as verified by KVM include evidence of arbitrary\n\n24 detentions, extra judicial killings and the mutilation of unarmed\n\n25 civilians of Albanian ethnic origin in the village of Racak by the MUP and\n\nPage 261\n\n1 VJ.\n\n2 \"In other words, he claimed the Serbian police and the Yugoslav\n\n3 army. Walker was supposed to be an independent international official,\n\n4 but did he seek direct instruction now from the Americans?\n\n5 \"Without calling on any of my capitals, I told what I thought I'd\n\n6 seen, which was the end result of a massacre.\n\n7 \"William Walker, the head of the Kosovo Verification Mission\n\n8 called me on a cell phone from Racak.\n\n9 \"But you don't remember calling Washington at all.\n\n10 \"I got a call from Bill Walker. He said, 'There's a\n\n11 massacre. I'm staying here. I can see the bodies.'\n\n12 \"And you didn't speak to General Clark or anybody like that?\"\n\n13 \"Walker's comments gave America the green light to enter the\n\n14 Kosovo war. The KLA had pulled in its mighty ally.\n\n15 \"With Racak and lots of others, Serbs were playing in the KLA\n\n16 hands. It will remain, I would say, an eternal dilemma whether the KLA\n\n17 initiated these battles in the civilian inhabited areas because it knew\n\n18 that the Serbs will retaliate on them. Personally, I don't think so, but\n\n19 of course it was a war.\n\n20 \"Clark: Clearing after Racak extraordinary measures had to be\n\n21 taken.\n\n22 \"It clearly is a galvanising event, and the President really\n\n23 felt that we could move forward, make clear that the US was going to be a\n\n24 part of an implementing force.\n\n25 \"But Albright knew the galvanising effect of Racak would not last\n\nPage 262\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 263\n\n1 long. She had to get her European allies on board.\"\n\n2 THE ACCUSED: Has it finished? [Interpretation] Have they\n\n3 finished the tape? Is that the end of the tape?\n\n4 Let me continue where I left off in commenting the fabricated\n\n5 facts that we heard.\n\n6 You mentioned a scorched earth plan. I don't know where you got\n\n7 that from, probably from Vietnam. The scorched earth plan is the same\n\n8 thing as the Horseshoe plan, and everybody knows that that was a pure\n\n9 fabrication. And even when it was presented allegedly in the original, in\n\n10 the original it was called \"Podkova,\" which is in fact a Croatian word.\n\n11 The Serbs would never have written the word \"Podkova.\" They would have\n\n12 used the word \"Podkovica,\" meaning horseshoe.\n\n13 And I don't know what this explanation in the indictment means,\n\n14 that the Serbs had arms in Kosovo. Everybody knows that everybody had\n\n15 arms in Kosovo. Everybody was armed, and there are countless documented\n\n16 examples of the fact that the Albanian terrorists stormed the houses of\n\n17 their own compatriots, the Albanians, in order to seize weapons from\n\n18 them, countless documented examples of this.\n\n19 And when I listen to everything uttered here, anybody with any\n\n20 reason must ask themselves How can criminal responsibility, criminal\n\n21 accountability, let alone any political, moral, or any other kind of\n\n22 responsibility and accountability, and nobody could even put forward that\n\n23 kind of responsibility. But you were talking about criminal\n\n24 responsibility for the forcible secession of Croatia and to ascribe that\n\n25 to me.\n\nPage 264\n\n1 It is not contested that Croatia affected a secession, neither was\n\n2 it contested that that succession was by force. And how should that have\n\n3 and could that have been stopped by me as President of Serbia, to stop the\n\n4 conflicts which the Croatian paramilitary had with the Yugoslav People's\n\n5 Army, which it was expelling out of the citizen bases in which that army\n\n6 had been stationed for a full 50 years? And they did not get to those\n\n7 bases, of course, from Serbia, because it was the SFRY. The Yugoslav army\n\n8 was deployed throughout the territory of the SFRY.\n\n9 And here we see in fact that you have absolutely no notion,\n\n10 neither do you know anything about the republican ministries of defence.\n\n11 They did not have any competencies and authority. Their main job was to\n\n12 keep lists of military recruits and conscripts, recruits for the army and\n\n13 to see to the civilian part and the administrative section, of course, all\n\n14 with a view to the country's defence.\n\n15 You quote the political opinions of generals, General Simovic, and\n\n16 none of his competencies and activities. Everybody has the right to\n\n17 express political opinions and speak about anything he deems necessary.\n\n18 What do we mean by internal displacement of persons in Kosovo, and\n\n19 what could be a motive for internal displacement in Kosovo, and what is\n\n20 the explanation when conflicts occur in one area when terrorist bands and\n\n21 groups storm villages, killing inhabitants? And you will see later on\n\n22 just how many Albanians were killed before the war began, two and a half\n\n23 times more than the Serbs that were killed. But more about that later on.\n\n24 So of course the inhabitants of that village will flee to a\n\n25 neighbouring village to stay with their friends or to the town. Or if\n\nPage 265\n\n1 they had no relatives there, to a collection centre organised by the\n\n2 authorities. So internal displacement of the population.\n\n3 I don't understand it. What could be the purpose of internally\n\n4 displacing the population, other than a malicious interpretation of the\n\n5 fact that people were running away? They were fleeing from an area they\n\n6 did not feel safe in and where they thought their children would not be\n\n7 safe, and they moved to other places. Can maybe claim that somebody used\n\n8 force to displace persons internally or to expel people from the territory\n\n9 of their own country? That would be the greatest crime imaginable, and\n\n10 who would do such a thing?\n\n11 Furthermore, I wonder what sense there is in proving the alleged\n\n12 ill-intentions towards the Albanians by concentrating troops in the south\n\n13 of the country during the NATO aggression, and particularly in Kosovo,\n\n14 when it is clear to every child that that territory, the territory in\n\n15 question, was the forefront of our defence from an expected ground\n\n16 invasion by NATO troops from the direction of Albanian Macedonia. So\n\n17 where in the opinion of the Prosecution should we have deployed our forces\n\n18 if enemy forces were concentrated in Albania and Macedonia? Should we\n\n19 have deployed them perhaps on the Hungarian border or should we have\n\n20 deployed them at the Albanian-Macedonia border?\n\n21 And let me also note that for 24 hours, 24 hours round the clock,\n\n22 during the B-52 bombers bombing the positions along the borders with an\n\n23 offensive and the Albanians were in the forefront to storm the territory,\n\n24 and they were never successful in this, thanks to the firm defence set up\n\n25 at our borders.\n\nPage 266\n\n1 So what sense is there to explain the ill-intentions towards\n\n2 Albanians or to say that that was so if you position your forces to stand\n\n3 up in defence of an attack, and not an imaginary attack but a very\n\n4 concrete attack, an ongoing one that actually took place, and that is\n\n5 something that the whole world knows.\n\n6 I should like to say that it is nonsensical and malicious to show\n\n7 us to be in favour of a military solution. What we were doing was to try\n\n8 to effect a political agreement, and the contents of that political\n\n9 agreement offered by the Government of Serbia and our leadership was made\n\n10 public. It was publicised.\n\n11 The sole point of dissension, where we did not agree in the\n\n12 American delegation, was that -- and the Americans were our partners in\n\n13 the negotiations. So apart from some separate meetings that I had with\n\n14 Rugova, and they were again contacts of this kind, because they wanted to\n\n15 control the whole issue. So the only point that there was disagreement on\n\n16 was that we asked that the political solution be founded parallelly on the\n\n17 equality of citizens and the equality of national communities. Because in\n\n18 Kosovo, as was partially mentioned in what we heard here, we have\n\n19 Albanians, Serbs, Turks, Muslims, living together, as well as the Goranis,\n\n20 the Romanies and Egyptians, seven national or ethnic communities.\n\n21 And in order to realise a solution of this kind, we had a very\n\n22 normal and concrete approach that it should be implemented in such a way\n\n23 that the house -- that the Assembly of Kosovo should have two Chambers,\n\n24 the Chamber of the citizens and one man/one vote was applied here, where\n\n25 the vast majority would be in fact Albanians and nobody had anything\n\nPage 267\n\n1 against that because they were the majority population in the province.\n\n2 And a second house or Chamber, the Chamber of national communities or\n\n3 ethnic communities, in which each of the ethnic communities, Serbs and\n\n4 Montenegrins - who were taken to be one ethnic community and not two\n\n5 ethnic communities - as well as the Albanians and Turks, and Muslims, and\n\n6 Romanies, and Goranis, and Egyptians would have a parity relationship and\n\n7 would have their own members elected.\n\n8 Look at the United States, for example, Rhode Island. Rhode\n\n9 Island is smaller than Belgrade. It has two senators, just like Texas,\n\n10 which is bigger than half of Europe. It is logical that in a complex\n\n11 structure that is how matters are resolved. That was the only contested\n\n12 point or stumbling-block. And it was not to be accepted because the plan\n\n13 was not to accept anything, to find a pretext for an invasion on\n\n14 Yugoslavia, whereas we see that -- that it is only the Albanians creating\n\n15 an ethnically pure Kosovo and greater Albania, and I'll be saying some\n\n16 more about that later on.\n\n17 So that is what I would call the neo-Nazi idea according to which\n\n18 Yugoslavia was broken up and in which the map of the Balkans was\n\n19 replotted, and a greater Albania is behind it all. And what we have heard\n\n20 here from the Prosecution, it is in that context that I wish to state that\n\n21 the Prosecutor -- it was not by chance that the Prosecutor mentioned\n\n22 Nuremberg. He did not mention Nuremberg symbolically. They are not\n\n23 satisfied with the crime committed over Yugoslavia and the settling of\n\n24 accounts with Serbia because of their defeat in both world wars. They\n\n25 want to proclaim us the culprits, who were the victims of their\n\nPage 268\n\n1 aggression, and me, with the help of this Tribunal, to bring me before\n\n2 Nuremberg to reverse the roles.\n\n3 That crime, which was the crime of the killing of Yugoslavia, and\n\n4 crucifying me here, they are doing that with the help of their -- today's\n\n5 allies and one-time enemies. All the facts bear this out and all the\n\n6 moves actually implemented bear that out.\n\n7 World public opinion will not be able to turn a blind eye to that,\n\n8 despite the efforts being made by the Prosecution and the great efforts\n\n9 made by the media. But the Yugoslav public, and not only the Yugoslav\n\n10 public, are well aware of the real truth.\n\n11 Now, the question arises when you hear what has been said here\n\n12 over the past two days, what you're trying to prove with the different\n\n13 photographs that you're showing, the supreme councils. I was a member and\n\n14 the meetings convened by the president of the supreme council. You could\n\n15 have shown my photograph with Mr. Rugova, for example, or perhaps with\n\n16 Christopher or Kofi Annan, or any one of those people. So I don't\n\n17 understand what you're trying to prove, what it means.\n\n18 What are you trying to prove with the photographs showing police\n\n19 putting order into rallies and demonstrations and many, many times less\n\n20 brutally than we see on your own television programmes and how you restore\n\n21 law and order in your own countries when there are demonstrations and\n\n22 rallies and riots, and when the public law and order are being threatened\n\n23 and the lives of citizens as well? What do you think you are proving\n\n24 when you show photographs of funerals, where you see somebody standing\n\n25 there and you can recognise him standing behind me, with a thousand people\n\nPage 269\n\n1 attending the funeral? What is it you are trying to prove by showing\n\n2 photographs of that kind, the photographs you're presenting to the Trial\n\n3 Chamber here?\n\n4 What are you trying to prove with your assertions that I did not\n\n5 hand over some people that you thought were the perpetrators of crimes?\n\n6 It is no secret. I would never hand over anybody to you because I\n\n7 consider that it is an illegal tribunal, and I have already stated that.\n\n8 I said that to Albright when she asked me to hand over some people, and I\n\n9 don't want to mention names here, to name names. But go ahead, tell our\n\n10 own organs and institutions that your organs and institutions supply our\n\n11 own ones with the truth and at the law courts in Yugoslavia will\n\n12 not -- will comply if you have proof.\n\n13 In Yugoslavia, already in 1992, we tried for war crimes our own\n\n14 citizens for whom it was established that they had killed some Muslims in\n\n15 Bosnia, storming a group and killing some people. That was in 1992.\n\n16 Nobody knew that this Tribunal would be set up at the time. Nor is that\n\n17 important at all. Every civilised country in its criminal code has war\n\n18 crimes as the most grievous crimes, and we tried people for war crimes\n\n19 back in 1992. And I said at the time, \"Go ahead. Let's see the proof.\n\n20 Let's see your documents. And don't worry, if somebody really did\n\n21 something dirty, did some dirty work, killing women and children\n\n22 somewhere, abused prisoners or anything else of that nature, shot at\n\n23 people, shot at a Red Cross vehicle, and I will show you pictures of NATO\n\n24 bombing Red Cross vehicles on a bridge and it says the Romanian Red Cross\n\n25 -- it has the Romanian Red Cross emblem on the roof, that people doing\n\nPage 270\n\n1 that will be arrested and brought to trial.\n\n2 So I don't understand what you mean when you say I didn't hand\n\n3 over. I would never hand anybody over. And even the handing over that is\n\n4 going on now is a violation of the constitution and a crime in itself.\n\n5 But they are doing this because it is a puppet regime that is in place\n\n6 today, a puppet regime which has to listen to orders, but not supported by\n\n7 the people.\n\n8 I am wondering what you are trying to prove with the existence of\n\n9 volunteers. You mentioned the existence of volunteers, Serb volunteers\n\n10 that went across the Drina River as volunteers. Of course their\n\n11 conduct -- the authorities on whose territory they have gone to fight as\n\n12 volunteers are responsible for them, but what do you intend to prove with\n\n13 the existence of Serb volunteers who went to help their own brethren,\n\n14 their Serb brethren? And you have no regard at all, you're not\n\n15 interested at all in how many Mujahedin came to Bosnia or to Kosovo, who\n\n16 had sabres with them that were used to cut off heads. And later on, at\n\n17 the request -- at well known request, they were released.\n\n18 Furthermore, when the person came from Saudi Arabia with his sabre\n\n19 to cut off heads, he travelled 2.000 kilometres to come to Bosnia and to\n\n20 help Alija Izetbegovic. But if Serbs go to help their fellow Serbs,\n\n21 assist their fellow Serbs, then that is something that the Prosecution\n\n22 deems necessary to take into serious consideration.\n\n23 What are you trying to prove by quoting a sentence from a speech\n\n24 of mine held at Gazimestan which was, let me tell you, a very good speech.\n\n25 I can say that it was an excellent speech, in fact, and I don't think that\n\nPage 271\n\n1 you could find any criticism of that speech.\n\n2 You quoted the latter part of a sentence, a small part of a\n\n3 sentence in which I state that we will have to fight many battles, which\n\n4 of course are not armed, although such battles are not excluded. That is\n\n5 an ordinary type of sentence that everybody uses today because peace has\n\n6 still not become a stable, secure category in the present day world, in\n\n7 the modern day world. And if that were not so, why do states have armies?\n\n8 But then you are very skilful in skipping -- and sly, in skipping over\n\n9 everything else.\n\n10 I have received a fax. I received the speech by fax, so I shall\n\n11 try and find your quotation to demonstrate how you pulled it out of\n\n12 context. You pulled your quotations out of context.\n\n13 In that speech, I say, \"Equitable relations amongst Yugoslav\n\n14 peoples are a necessary prerequisite for the preservation of Yugoslavia\n\n15 for it to emerge from the crisis and particularly necessary for its\n\n16 economic and social prosperity. In that way, Yugoslavia is not extracted\n\n17 from the social ambience of the modern and particularly the developed\n\n18 world. The world is prone to national conciliation, national cooperation,\n\n19 and national equality. Modern technology and the political and cultural\n\n20 development indicates that people should cooperate and depend on each\n\n21 other and that they must be more and more equal amongst themselves. A\n\n22 civilisation in which the world is moving --\n\n23 JUDGE MAY: Mr. Milosevic, if you're reading, can you slow down\n\n24 for the interpreters.\n\n25 THE ACCUSED: Okay. I understand that interpreter cannot follow\n\nPage 272\n\n1 fast reading.\n\n2 [Interpretation] \"In the kind of civilisation to which mankind is\n\n3 moving, it is only equitable united people that can step forward. If we\n\n4 cannot lead the world into civilisation of this kind, then we must\n\n5 certainly not be at its back end. So nowhere on the soil of our homeland\n\n6 do the words speaking about solidarity and harmony and cooperation among\n\n7 people have so much meaning as they do have here at Kosovo Polje and the\n\n8 field of Kosovo, which is the symbol of treachery and disaccord --\n\n9 discord.\n\n10 \"In the memory, collective memory of the Serb people, that\n\n11 discord was decisive for losing the battle and for the ill-fate that the\n\n12 Serbs have had to contend for a full five centuries. And from the\n\n13 historical -- if that were not so from the historical viewpoint, we know\n\n14 that the people experienced this as their greatest misfortune, and it is\n\n15 the responsibility of the people to do away with this in order to protect\n\n16 itself from defeat, from stagnation, and from failure.\n\n17 \"The people of Serbia this year have become fully conscious of\n\n18 the need for harmony amongst themselves as a necessary prerequisite for\n\n19 their life today and future development. I am convinced that this\n\n20 consciousness about unity and harmony will enable Serbia not only to\n\n21 function as a state but also to function as a successful state. That is\n\n22 why I think that this must be said here at Kosovo, where discord\n\n23 jeopardised the Serbs long ago and where revived harmony can promote it\n\n24 and give it back its dignity.\n\n25 \"This kind of consciousness, the consciousness of mutual\n\nPage 273\n\n1 relations and how they are governed, represents an elementary necessity\n\n2 for Yugoslavia because its fate is to be found in the allied hands of all\n\n3 its people.\n\n4 Six centuries later today, once again we are fighting battles and\n\n5 we are facing battles.\"\n\n6 And this is where I come to your quotation.\n\n7 \"They are not armed battles, though even ones of that kind have\n\n8 not been excluded.\"\n\n9 So that is one sentence. And I go on to say -- but you did not\n\n10 quote that.\n\n11 \"Regardless of the type of battles they are, they cannot be won\n\n12 without courage, self-sacrifice and the kind of characteristics that were\n\n13 present a long time ago at Kosovo Polje.\n\n14 \"Our main battle today relates to the realisation of economic,\n\n15 political, cultural, and general social prosperity for the faster and more\n\n16 successful joining of a civilisation in which people will live in the\n\n17 twenty-first century. And it is for that battle that we need courage and\n\n18 bravery, a different kind of courage and bravery, but the kind that\n\n19 comes from the heart, without which nothing great can be achieved in the\n\n20 world. That remains the same and that remains eternally necessary.\"\n\n21 I don't want to go on to quote the entire speech. I have just\n\n22 given you portions of it, excerpts from it, to show you how malicious the\n\n23 extra that was quoted is, because I say that our major battle is the\n\n24 major -- is the battle for economic, social, and cultural prosperity. And\n\n25 you were able to see how they abused the quotation.\n\nPage 274\n\n1 I'm also going to quote just a few more things.\n\n2 \"In Serbia, Serbs were not the only people who lived in Serbia.\"\n\n3 That is what I said before 2 million people. \"Today more than\n\n4 ever before we have people of other ethnic groups, ethnicities, living\n\n5 there. And that is not a handicap for Serbia. Serbia is not handicapped\n\n6 by that fact. I am profoundly convinced that it is its advantage. And\n\n7 in that sense, the national composition of practically everybody is being\n\n8 changed, especially the developed countries of the modern world. Evermore\n\n9 and evermore successfully, different ethnic groups are living together,\n\n10 people of different religions and different races. Socialism, as a\n\n11 progressive and just democratic society should not allow itself that\n\n12 people be divided on an ethnic and religious basis. The only differences\n\n13 that can be allowed in socialism, and should be allowed in socialism, are\n\n14 between the honest and the dishonest. That is why everybody living in\n\n15 Serbia, on the basis of their own work, as honest citizens, showing a\n\n16 respect for other people and other ethnic groups and nations in their own\n\n17 republic. Yugoslavia is a multinational community, and it can survive\n\n18 only if there is full and complete equality of all the nations and\n\n19 nationalities living within it.\n\n20 \"The crisis that has hit Yugoslavia has led to national but also\n\n21 to social, cultural, religious, and many other less important divisions.\n\n22 And amongst all these divisions, the most dramatic were ethnic divisions.\n\n23 And if we do away with ethnic divisions, we shall be able to do away with\n\n24 the other divisions and mitigate the results that those division -- of\n\n25 those divisions.\" And so on and so forth.\n\nPage 275\n\n1 So at Kosovo, the greatest holiday of the Serbs, the St. Vidovdan\n\n2 holiday, and the event that is described as the eruption of Serb\n\n3 nationalistic feelings, this is what was authentic. This is what was\n\n4 said. If you don't believe that, you can take the newspapers of the 29th\n\n5 of June, 1989, and you can read all about it. You'll be able to read that\n\n6 exact same speech in those newspapers. And I wouldn't change a single\n\n7 word in that speech even now, even today. I considered at that time that\n\n8 I, as the president of Serbia, should tell the Serbs that where they are\n\n9 the majority, the national key and national equality is the only key.\n\n10 And now you can see the degree of maliciousness that this excerpt,\n\n11 this excerpted quotation was taken, if you look at the whole.\n\n12 I don't want to take up my time by reading the speech in full, and\n\n13 I wouldn't have done so had they not interpreted it in such a malicious\n\n14 and ill-intentioned way. But let me continue. Let me continue with the\n\n15 issues that I wish to address before the public and not my responses to\n\n16 the Prosecution, because the degree of maliciousness has been demonstrated\n\n17 to such an extent that it can leave nobody blind to the facts.\n\n18 What do you prove when you say the Socialist Party appointed\n\n19 Ministers? I know of no country in which a party with wins the elections,\n\n20 wins the free multi-party elections and gains a parliamentary majority, is\n\n21 not able to appoint its Ministers. I don't know in your countries. I\n\n22 know that in your countries parties appoint their own Ministers. Although\n\n23 I can say that that was not the case in Yugoslavia, because sometimes we\n\n24 appointed persons that were outside parties as Ministers, and we had the\n\n25 idea of national unity where many parties took part in the government,\n\nPage 276\n\n1 even non-party personalities.\n\n2 What do you prove by that, that their material status depended on\n\n3 it? I don't know. In the countries that the people working at this\n\n4 Tribunal come from, do Ministers have other kinds of revenue? Do they not\n\n5 receive salaries? In our country, Ministers receive salaries. However,\n\n6 those who abuse their office by taking money have always been held\n\n7 responsible. Of course, if they are caught. We are the only country in\n\n8 the world over the past ten years that arrested two of its Ministers\n\n9 because of embezzlement of 700.000 Deutschemark, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n10 Of course, not only were they replaced but they were also charged\n\n11 before a criminal court and were sentenced.\n\n12 So what does this statement mean, that Minister's salaries depend\n\n13 on their ministerial post and that when a party comes to power, that it\n\n14 appoints Ministers? What does that mean? Also, what does it mean when\n\n15 you use the wrong name for the Socialist Party of Serbia by calling it the\n\n16 Serbian Socialist Party, as opposed to many parties that are called\n\n17 Serbian? We were never a Serb party. We were simply called the Socialist\n\n18 Party of Serbia. And, of course, the majority of the party members are\n\n19 Serbs, but there is not a single ethnic group in Yugoslavia that does not\n\n20 have its members in the Socialist Party of Serbia: Hungarians, Albanians,\n\n21 Romany, Gorani, Egyptians, Muslims. Do you really think that all of these\n\n22 ethnic communities that live in Serbia would join a party that was\n\n23 carrying out some kind of discrimination? After all, it is senseless\n\n24 trying to prove this any further because, after all, there is a reality\n\n25 that speaks of this.\n\nPage 277\n\n1 Over the past 12 years, the ethnic structure of Serbia and its\n\n2 population was not changed, and that fully refutes everything that has\n\n3 been said here.\n\n4 There was complete nonsense uttered here, saying that a superior\n\n5 Assembly had disbanded the Assembly of Kosovo. According to the\n\n6 Constitution, when this assembly violated the Constitution, the other\n\n7 assembly dissolved it. Why would that be a criminal act? Why do you say\n\n8 that all the directors of the media were members of the Socialist Party?\n\n9 The director of the Politika daily newspaper was not a member of any\n\n10 party. And there were other editors in chief and directors of newspapers\n\n11 who were not. They can write letters to you. They can report to you,\n\n12 these people who were directors of the media and who were freely operating\n\n13 in Yugoslavia, opposition newspapers, pro-government newspapers, et\n\n14 cetera. After all, the very fact that there is such a large number of\n\n15 opposition media in a country speaks of its democracy, and they were all\n\n16 operating.\n\n17 What are you trying to prove by saying that we had a Ministry for\n\n18 Communications with Serbs outside Serbia? There are over 2 million Serbs\n\n19 living from Australia to Latin America, to the US, Canada. All the\n\n20 countries of Europe, including this country, the Netherlands. These\n\n21 contacts are nurtured. After all, such Ministries exist in many\n\n22 countries. That is with contacts with the diaspora. Every year we have\n\n23 an Assembly of the diaspora. There are people coming from New Zealand\n\n24 Australia, India, America, North America, and South America, et cetera.\n\n25 So what are you trying to prove by this, by saying that we had a Ministry\n\nPage 278\n\n1 for contacts with Serbs outside Serbia?\n\n2 How can you be so impudent and quote an alleged statement of mine\n\n3 that Yugoslavia is finished when everybody knows that I advocated\n\n4 whole-heartedly that Yugoslavia should be continued and that as a basis\n\n5 for this continuity we established a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia when\n\n6 the former Yugoslavia fell apart? Do you think that in Serbia there were\n\n7 not voices, strong voices at that, that Serbia should secede from\n\n8 Yugoslavia? Especially according to those who were strongly\n\n9 anti-communist. Yugoslavia had been a dungeon of nations and it had to be\n\n10 broken up. I told them then, too, that Yugoslavia was in the interest of\n\n11 all the Southern Slavs, that they should all live together on a footing of\n\n12 equality. It is also interests in the interests of the Serb people whose\n\n13 interests you claim to be advocating. And you don't know what you are\n\n14 advocating because Yugoslavia is the only option under which Serbs can\n\n15 live in a single state because they live in all the republics. You abused\n\n16 that as well. The press abused that. That this was a programme of a\n\n17 Greater Serbia and that that is why this was carried out. But what I\n\n18 added then is that in this way, all the Croats live in one state, all the\n\n19 Muslims live in one state, all the Macedonians live in one state.\n\n20 Do you know that in Serbia there are more Muslims than in Bosnia?\n\n21 And that the greatest misfortune was for Yugoslavs to have Yugoslavia\n\n22 broken up. And this was in their interest least of all. Wasn't it in\n\n23 their interest to live in a single state, even though in two republics?\n\n24 So what?\n\n25 I really don't know where this fabrication came from stating that\n\nPage 279\n\n1 in Karadjordjevo I talked to Tudjman about the dismemberment of Bosnia. I\n\n2 did meet with Tudjman in Karadjordjevo and not only in Karadjordjevo. He\n\n3 first came to see me in Karadjordjevo. That is near the border. After 10\n\n4 or 15 days, I also went to visit him also nearby. We met at a facility\n\n5 that was similar to Karadjordjevo. We also talked. We informed the\n\n6 public that we met and talked. We thought that relations\n\n7 should be promoted.\n\n8 I'm not trying to say that there weren't some ideas but they were\n\n9 never my ideas and I never accepted them, to the effect that Bosnia\n\n10 should be divided, because I thought that not a single solution could be\n\n11 found that would be to the detriment of any one of the peoples in\n\n12 Bosnia-Herzegovina. That position of mine is well known. It was well\n\n13 known before Dayton, at the Dayton conference, and since. That is a\n\n14 formula that I had advocated publicly for years. And if you really wanted\n\n15 to be impartial, you would find that in any newspaper.\n\n16 The problem in Bosnia can be resolved only by way of a formula\n\n17 that would equally protect the interests of all three peoples. That was\n\n18 the key that I was advocating, and that is the key upon which the future\n\n19 of Bosnia-Herzegovina can be built if the interests of all three peoples\n\n20 living there are respected. There is no other way. Any other solution\n\n21 would be a fiasco.\n\n22 How can you possibly speak of a so-called policy of ethnic\n\n23 cleansing which was allegedly launched from Belgrade when everybody in\n\n24 Serbia knows that this expression was used exclusively for crimes. In\n\n25 Serbia, there is not a single person who does not know that the expression\n\nPage 280\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 281\n\n1 \"ethnic cleansing\" was used for crime only, not to go back to the reality\n\n2 of Serbia and Yugoslavia now.\n\n3 I don't know what you wanted to prove by that when you said that\n\n4 when visiting Sarajevo, I also visited the headquarters of the Serb\n\n5 Democratic Party. So what? I visited it. So what?\n\n6 At this meeting in Sarajevo, where the representatives of all the\n\n7 Yugoslav republics were, that was hosted by Alija Izetbegovic, all the\n\n8 presidents were there, Izetbegovic, Tudjman, Gligorov, Kucan. All of them\n\n9 were there.\n\n10 On behalf of Serbia, I accepted the Izetbegovic Gligorov plan,\n\n11 which did bear in mind some kind of state, though a looser one, just in\n\n12 order to avoid any further tensions. I asked Izetbegovic about it then.\n\n13 I'm sure that there are tapes on which this was recorded.\n\n14 \"Tell me, Mr. Izetbegovic, on the basis of everything you've said,\n\n15 will this be a state nevertheless?\" He said, \"Yes, it will be a state.\"\n\n16 And then I said to him, \"You do not need to explain any more of this to\n\n17 me. We accept this plan.\" And we did.\n\n18 And then his protocol people, et cetera, took me there because I\n\n19 was invited to visit them and I wanted therefore to visit them. And I met\n\n20 the entire political leadership there, prominent Serbs from\n\n21 Bosnia-Herzegovina, members of the Academy of Sciences and Arts, and I\n\n22 talked to all of them. What are you trying to prove by this, that I\n\n23 visited it them? Even if I had visited them a hundred times, what can you\n\n24 prove by that, some kind of criminal enterprise?\n\n25 You said here yesterday that my picture was there throughout. And\n\nPage 282\n\n1 I say that it is the image of neo-Naziism and the crimes that were created\n\n2 in -- that were committed in Bosnia and Croatia and also the spectre of\n\n3 breaking up Yugoslavia because of this neo-Colonialism. That is what\n\n4 loomed over, not my picture. And this is how a country was broken up, a\n\n5 country that by its freedom, security, safety, and its advocacy of justice\n\n6 throughout the world. This was an exemplary country, and it was broken\n\n7 up.\n\n8 What are you trying to prove in connection with Serbia, in\n\n9 connection with Serbia when you talk about the shelling of Sarajevo? If\n\n10 you were to employ this enormous staff that you are spending so much money\n\n11 on, if you would find this in the newspapers, and if you would see how\n\n12 many times Serbia in its official government statements while I was the\n\n13 President of Serbia condemned the shelling of Sarajevo.\n\n14 At the time when Dobrica Cosic, President of the Federal Republic\n\n15 of Yugoslavia from 1992 -- he can testify. He is a famous Serb writer, a\n\n16 member of the academy inter alia. The entire leadership -- I can't even\n\n17 remember who was there. But everybody was there, all the Serb leaders\n\n18 from Bosnia-Herzegovina. We were sitting and together. We all met in\n\n19 Dobonace [phoen]. And they promised me and him that they would not shell\n\n20 any built-up areas. When I heard that there were some camps, I asked for\n\n21 an explanation. Is it possible that Serbs were setting up camps? And the\n\n22 explanation I received was the following: There are no camps. There are\n\n23 only prisons for prisoners of war, which spend short periods of time there\n\n24 and then they are exchanged on the principle all for all. Those are the\n\n25 assurances that I got several times. And nowadays I see people who worked\n\nPage 283\n\n1 in camps and who say that we were all deceived in this connection, perhaps\n\n2 even the people up there in the leadership of Republika Srpska, because I\n\n3 almost cannot believe that in such a way people can deceive other people.\n\n4 I don't understand what you're trying to prove by inventing some\n\n5 kind of charts in a non-existent organisation. You have said yourselves\n\n6 that it was not authentic but that you are trying to imagine that this is\n\n7 the way it was. Why would you write these charts, that there is a\n\n8 Constitution that states what the powers of the President of the republic\n\n9 are, the government, ministers, ministries, everyone. Why would somebody\n\n10 establish an organisation in order to undermine his own state? Because\n\n11 any deviation from the system -- I mean, after all, we adopted this\n\n12 Constitution. If we wanted to adopt a different Constitution, we would\n\n13 have adopted a different Constitution. So I don't see what you're trying\n\n14 to prove when you say that services cooperated. Well, the services of\n\n15 many countries cooperate. The services of all your countries cooperate.\n\n16 Half of the things that were fabricated here were created in cooperation\n\n17 with these services, and no court in the world would accept that. And\n\n18 then you're trying to prove something through that. They had a helicopter\n\n19 unit, you say. Well, of course they were transferring people who were\n\n20 ill, wounded, injured, to the military academy hospital in Belgrade.\n\n21 Well, you also transport your sick people by helicopters and so on and so\n\n22 forth. But I really don't want to take up my time with these comments\n\n23 regarding this expression of powerlessness.\n\n24 Perhaps I should put it that way, because these things that we\n\n25 have been listening to for two days show that you basically have nothing,\n\nPage 284\n\n1 and that is why you have to concoct things. You have to invent things\n\n2 that at first sight everybody from Yugoslavia would know that this is\n\n3 untrue. And when the rest of the world looks at it again, they will\n\n4 realise that that's not true either.\n\n5 What we saw here on our monitors coming from western sources, I'm\n\n6 sure that there will be more and more honourable people in the West who\n\n7 will not bow their heads and trample upon their own honour in order to be\n\n8 engaged in a media campaign. That is why this show which is supposed to\n\n9 take place under the guise of a trial is actually a crime against a\n\n10 sovereign state, against the Serb people, against me. You wish to try\n\n11 me for deeds carried out in the capacity of head of state, in the defence\n\n12 of that state, and that people from terrorism and from the greatest\n\n13 military machinery that the world ever had, and it acted in conjunction\n\n14 with terrorism.\n\n15 This is also a crime against the truth. What makes it\n\n16 particularly cynical is that it is a crime against justice as well.\n\n17 This is a competition between justice and injustice. The whole world\n\n18 knows that this is a political trial and that it has nothing to do with\n\n19 law whatsoever. Not only because this is an illegal court - you said that\n\n20 you had rejected that altogether - but for many other reasons too.\n\n21 Let me digress at this point, Mr. May. Yesterday you gave me an\n\n22 answer and then you interrupted me. You told me that you had made a\n\n23 ruling, that I did not appeal it, and that for you that was the end of the\n\n24 story. I cannot accept that explanation not only on moral grounds but\n\n25 legal grounds as well, because you know very well that habeas corpus\n\nPage 285\n\n1 cannot be ruled upon without a hearing. That is guaranteed. That is\n\n2 guaranteed by the -- by Article 9 of the universal declaration on human\n\n3 rights, Article 9.1 of the international covenant on basic civil\n\n4 and political rights, Article 5 of the European Convention on the\n\n5 protection of human rights and freedoms, and also Article 7.6 of the\n\n6 American convention on the protection of human rights, because in this\n\n7 way, it is not only physical freedom that is violated but basic human\n\n8 rights as well. It is for me to emphasise this once again. You were\n\n9 duty-bound to schedule a hearing to hear the staff members of your\n\n10 Tribunal here, those who took part in committing this crime, who were\n\n11 engaged in a conspiracy with the warden of the prison in Belgrade, who\n\n12 committed a crime and that he is therefore undergoing criminal proceedings\n\n13 right now. You were supposed to hear from all the participants and only\n\n14 then could you rule on whether these documents for which you say is the\n\n15 law that is applied in this court, only then can you rule whether these\n\n16 rules were violated or not.\n\n17 So this has nothing to do with justice or injustice, because this\n\n18 court is illegal and because it is financed through donations including\n\n19 source like, for example, Saudi Arabia that inter alia finance things like\n\n20 international terrorism, but also because this Court accepted a false\n\n21 indictment without evidence. And in this way, they inverted the basic\n\n22 principle that it is the Prosecutor who bears the burden of proof, not the\n\n23 victim. The victim does not have to prove his innocence. In this way, we\n\n24 go back to the times of the inquisition. So all the forces that carried\n\n25 out a crime against my country and my people are in this way no doubt\n\nPage 286\n\n1 engaging in a war. And by introducing so-called protected witnesses,\n\n2 secret witnesses, the category of false witnesses is given the right to\n\n3 exist and obviously might becomes right rather than having the rule of law\n\n4 prevail. There is not a single element of a fair trial or of equality\n\n5 between the parties.\n\n6 Look at this. There is an enormous apparatus on one side, a vast\n\n7 media structure on that same side. All kinds of services on this same\n\n8 side. Everything is at your disposal. What's on my side? I only have a\n\n9 public telephone booth in the prison. That's the only thing I have\n\n10 available in order to face here the most terrible kind of libel addressed\n\n11 against my country, my people, and me, everything that you mentioned\n\n12 here.\n\n13 Also, this other Chamber that was presided over by Mr. Jorda. I\n\n14 said, \"Let me go free. The entire world knows that I'm not going to run\n\n15 away from this battle which has to come up with the truth.\" This would\n\n16 bring shame not only upon me and my family but also my people and also\n\n17 the entire freedom-loving world that believes in freedom and justice. You\n\n18 know full well that I'm not going t"
