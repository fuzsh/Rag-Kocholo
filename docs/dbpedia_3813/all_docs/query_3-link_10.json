        "text": "INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE\n\nOn the basis of Article 73 of the Rules of the Court, I submit:\n\nREQUEST FOR THE INDICATION OF\n\nPROVISIONAL MEASURES\n\nCONCERNING\n\nTHE APPLICATION OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA\n\nAGAINST THE REPUBLIC OF FRANCE\n\nFOR VIOLATION OF THE OBLIGATION NOT TO USE FORCE\n\nReasons\n\nThe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is exposed to acts of use of force by which the Republic of France\n\nhas violated its international obligations not to resort to threat or use of force against another State, not to\n\nintervene in the internal affairs of another State and not to violate the sovereignty of another State, to\n\nprotect civilians and civilian objects in time of war, to protect the environment, as well as those relating to\n\nfree navigation on international rivers, to the fundamental rights and liberties of the individual, to the ban\n\non the use of prohibited weapons and on deliberate infliction on ethnic groups conditions of life calculated\n\nto bring about physical destruction of the group.\n\nBoth military and civilian targets came under attack in the air strikes launched against the Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia.\n\nThere are many casualties, including a large number of civilian deaths. Even residential areas have been\n\nattacked. Countless dwellings have been destroyed. Enormous damage has been caused to schools,\n\nhospitals, radio and television stations, institutions and cultural monuments as well as to places of\n\nworship. Many bridges, roads and railway lines have also been destroyed. Industrial facilities have not\n\nbeen spared either. Attacks on oil refineries and chemical plants have had serious environmental effects\n\non some cities, towns and villages in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The bombing of oil refineries\n\nand oil storage tanks as well as chemical plants is bound to produce massive pollution of the environment,\n\nposing a threat to human life, plants and animals. The use of weapons containing depleted uranium\n\nwarheads is having far-reaching consequences for human health.\n\nFrom the onset of the bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, over 10 000 attacks were made\n\nagainst the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In air strikes were used: 806 warplanes (of\n\nwhich over 530 combat planes) and 206 helicopters stationed in 30 air-bases (situated in 5 states) and\n\naboard 6 warships in the Adriatic Sea. More than 2,500 cruise missiles were launched and over 7,000 tons\n\nof explosives were dropped.\n\nAbout 1000 civilians, including 19 children, were killed and more than 4,500 sustained serious injuries,\n\ne.g.:\n\n- in Doganovici village, near Urosevac, the following children were killed from a cluster\n\nbomb: Endon (3), Fisnik (9), Osman (13), Burim (14) and Vajdet (15) Kodzan.
