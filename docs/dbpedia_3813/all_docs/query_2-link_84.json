        "text": "At the Adelaide Airport in South Australia is possibly one of the cities best hidden aviation treasures. In an obscure and almost forgotten location down near the airport long-term parking, sits the Sir Ross & Sir Keith Smith War Memorial building (established 1958). Inside is the immaculate looking World War One era Vickers Vimy IV G-EAOU (dubbed “God ‘Elp All Of Us“).\n\nVickers Vimy\n\nThis converted former Royal Air Force (RAF) Vickers F.B.27A Vimy IV bomber (serial number F8630) fitted with two 360 HP Rolls Royce Eagle VIII engines was delivered too late to see service during World War One but became one of the more significant aircraft in Australian aviation history. The Vickers company were persuaded by Australian pilot Captain Ross Smith to supply the bomber for entry into the 1919 England to Australia Air Race. They soon set about adding extra fuel capacity to extend the big biplanes range whilst removing the radio and any other unnecessary items to reduce weight and create space, so they could pack the plane with spare parts for the long journey ahead. Quite the task given it only had minimal cargo space in the first place!\n\nThe Vickers Vimy was piloted in the race by Captain Ross Smith (Australian Flying Corps) with his brother Lieutenant Keith Smith (Royal Air Force) flying as the co-pilot and navigator along with their Australian military mechanics Sergeants Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett who had served with Ross Smith previously. These men became the first to ever fly an aircraft from England to Australia in 1919 and became the winner of the first England to Australia Air Race as a result.\n\n1919 England to Australia Air Race\n\nThe England to Australia Air Race was a 1919 initiative of the Australian Government headed by Prime Minister William Morris “Billy” Hughes (1862-1952) to promote aviation in Australia. A £10,000 prize was up for grabs for the first Australian crew to fly from Hounslow, England to Darwin in the Northern Territory within 30 consecutive days and by midnight on December 31st, 1920. The race was under the supervision and rules set by the Royal Aero Club of England. Many Australian pilots were still based in England awaiting to be repatriated home and for some this seemed like an exciting way to have an adventure getting back there and maybe make some decent money in the process!\n\nThe Smith brothers were one of six race entrants but only two completed the journey (two crews crashed with the sad loss of four crew members and the other two withdrew following damage sustained in a crash and a heavy landing). The brothers with adventure in their heart, set off at 8am in poor weather from Hounslow, England on November 12th, 1919 (the first to depart), arriving in Darwin 27 days and 20 hours later, on December 10th, 1919 after flying the 18,000 km journey at an average of 137 kilometres per hour through numerous countries, with many hair-raising experiences along the way including foul weather (this must have been made worse by the open cockpit of the Vimy and flying in blizzard like conditions – freezing cold and soaking wet!), being stuck in mud and a charging bull! The crew arrived home as national heroes and apart from an equal share in the prize money, the Smith brothers were knighted and the mechanics were commissioned and awarded bars to their Air Force Medals for their daring deed.\n\nAfter the flight to Darwin they took twice as long to fly to Sydney. I gather this was a crowd pleasing trip with plenty of stops to show of the Vickers Vimy to the big crowds that would have turned up. When they eventually returned to Adelaide some 20,000 people came out to see the Smith Brothers alone!\n\nIn comparison the slowest competitor and the only other entrant to finish the race, Lieutenant Ray Parer & John McIntosh flying a much smaller single engined Airco DH.9 G-EAQM took 208 days to complete the race (plus 29 more to make their way to Melbourne)! They actually started on January 8th, 1920 which was well after the race had already been won and were plagued by problems and accidents all the way (more on their misadventures in my next post)!\n\nOf those crews sadly lost attempting to fly to Australia were: Lieutenant James Ross and Lieutenant Roger Douglas flying a Alliance P.2 Seabird G-EAOX “Endeavour” crashed just a few minutes after take-off on November 13th, 1919 at Surbiton, UK (London) and Captain Cedric Howell and Lieutenant George Fraser flying a Martinsyde Type A Mk.I G-EAMR took off from London on December 5th, 1919 but disappeared over St. George’s Bay, Corfu in Greece on December 10th, 1919. The wreckage of the second aircraft was found offshore and Howell’s body was recovered but alas Fraser was never found.\n\nThe other two crews that did not finish the race had interesting tales as to why they had to abandon their attempts to be the first to fly from England to Australia. Captain Hubert Wilkins (navigator), Lieutenant Valdemar Rendle (pilot), Lieutenant David Williams (crew) and Lieutenant Garnsey Potts (crew) set off in their twin-engine Blackburn Kangaroo G-EAOW from Hounslow, England on November 21st, 1919 and had to land in France with engine trouble. They were still have engine problems when they suffered a forced landing on December 8th, 1919 at Suda Bay, Crete but luckily escaped with no serious injury.\n\nCaptain George Matthews and Sergeant Tom Kay (mechanic) flying a Sopwith Wallaby G-EAKS set off from Hounslow, England on October 21st, 1919 and were the closest of the non finishers to almost make it to Australia. They had some misadventures along the way, ranging from bad weather delays across Europe to briefly being detained in Yugoslavia as suspected Bolsheviks! They suffered more delays from a cracked engine cylinder in Turkey and bad weather on Syria but battled on until they unfortunately crashed on April 17th, 1920 at Grokak in Bali, Indonesia. This ended their race but luckily Matthews only suffered a slight injury in the crash and Kay was relatively unharmed.\n\nThe Sir Ross & Sir Keith Smith War Memorial\n\nFollowing the record-breaking flight the Vickers Vimy was donated by Vickers to the Australian government and became part of the Australian War Memorial collection. By 1958 the aircraft was put on permanent display in Adelaide in the purpose-built building where it remains today. Back in the day, it was front and centre to the old Adelaide Airport terminal building and in the public eye. Today though, far from the new terminal, everyone I saw just walked past the memorial building with little curiosity. This is a shame as it is historically significant to Australia and also well presented in the memorial building (albeit a bit hard to see at times due to sun glare on the glass surrounding it).\n\nGiven the historical significance of the Vickers Vimy it really should have been relocated to be near the expansive plaza of the new terminal building (apparently it was considered too fragile to be moved but given the plaza is mostly a big open space it would be a perfect fit to put something there). There has been some discussion the SA Aviation Museum in Port Adelaide would like to raise the necessary funds to relocate and house the big biplane to their museum to boost the number of visitors (they would require $2M to expand their museum to do it though) but the Airport has indicated they want to keep the Vimy and have also considered in the past moving it to a more prominent location such as the plaza. Time will tell I guess?\n\nFollow the information plaques along the Smith Brothers Walking Trail from the terminal building to the memorial. Each plaque provided by the Sir Ross & Sir Keith Smith Fund, represents the main stops the Smith brothers made in their record-breaking flight and has interesting information about each stop from Hounslow, England to Darwin, including the Vickers Vimy being charged by a bellowing bull at Allahabad, India on November 28th, 1919 and having to get a boy scout to distract it while they took off!\n\nStops along the way were:\n\nLyons, France (Nov 13th) – stiff with cold the French thought they were mad to fly in such appalling weather!\n\nRome, Italy (Nov 15th) – One heavy battle against strong winds and heavy cloud meant they had to fly dangerously low.\n\nCrete, Greece (Nov 17th) – Flying blind they almost hit a rocky island!\n\nCairo, Egypt (Nov 18th) – Wally Shiers had to use chewing gum to seal a crack in one of the engines!\n\nDamascus, Syria (Nov 19th) – It hadn’t rained in Damascus for 8 months until the Vimy arrived. Upon take off the propellers showered them all in mud!\n\nRamadi, Iraq (Nov 20th) – A violent sand storm raged and 50 soldiers needed to hold the Vimy down during the night\n\nBasra, Iraq (Nov 22nd) – A rest day whilst the Vimy was serviced by the mechanics.\n\nKarachi, Pakistan (Nov 24th) – After the longest flying stretch the stress of constant flying was showing on the crew.\n\nDelhi, India (Nov 25th) – The constant engine roar had deafened Ross Smith. He didn’t hear a word of the welcoming speeches!\n\nAllahabad, India (Nov 28th) – This is where that previously mentioned bull charged the Vimy!\n\nCalcutta, India (Nov 29th) – Hawks circled the Vimy after take-off and one hit a propeller. Luckily no damage was sustained.\n\nRangoon, Burma (Nov 30th) – The Vimy was the first aircraft to ever land at Rangoon (on a racecourse).\n\nBangkok, Thailand (Dec 1st) – A terrifying flight over cloud covered mountains with poor maps to guide them.\n\nSingora, Thailand (Dec 2nd) – A miracle landing on the “good airfield” that turned out to be a cleared patch of jungle with tree stumps everywhere and half under water!\n\nSingapore (Dec 6th) – As they took off from a racecourse airstrip the Vimy’s wheels grazed the treetops.\n\nSurabaya, Indonesia (Dec 8th) – The Vimy was bogged but Keith Smith had the good idea to lay down bamboo mats. They took off with the mats flying about everywhere!\n\nAtambua, Timor (Dec 10th) – The Vimy took off for Australia and the gust of wind from the engines blew spectators off a fence!\n\nDarwin, Australia (Dec 10th) – “We almost fell into Darwin” with bone dry fuel tanks.\n\nWhy is the memorial and the Vickers Vimy in Adelaide, when the 1919 air race ended in Darwin? Well, the pilots are the tie to Adelaide, rather than the aircraft itself. Sir Keith Macpherson Smith (1890-1955) was born in Adelaide on December 20th, 1890 and Sir Ross Macpherson Smith (1892-1922) was born on December 4th, 1892 in Semaphore, Adelaide.\n\nSir Ross Macpherson Smith\n\nSir Ross Macpherson Smith first served with the Australian 3rd Light Horse Regiment in October 1914, then went to Gallipoli in 1915 and the Sinai in 1916 before transferring to the AFC in 1917. He then served with No.1 Squadron AFC (No. 67 Squadron RFC) in the Suez Canal region, first as an observer then as a pilot flying air to air combat, bombing and aerial photography missions against Turkish forces. During this time he gained valuable experience flying numerous aircraft including the Bristol Fighter and most importantly the squadrons large twin-engined Handley Page 0/400 bomber which would prove very handy later as it was very similar to the Vickers Vimy.\n\nHis exploits during World War One were quite heroic and he was awarded the Military Cross (MC) twice, the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) three times and also the Air Force Cross (for non-operational flying duties). On one memorable occasion he landed in front of Turkish forces to rescue a downed pilot! He was also known to have flown Lawrence of Arabia as a passenger in his aircraft from time to time.\n\nDuring his AFC career Ross Smith became a talented long distance flyer, conducting missions as a co-pilot to pioneer aerial routes from Cairo, Egypt to Calcutta, India and from Calcutta to Timor. His adventurous life was sadly short-lived though and less than three years after his success in the 1919 air race he died in April 1922 at just 29 in a Vickers Viking amphibious biplane crash in England with mechanic Jim Bennett, whilst preparing for a round the world flight (apparently he had never flown the type before and the crash was put down to pilot error). His brother Keith Smith was unfortunately there to see his brother who he had shared so much adventure in life with, die in that crash. They were returned to Australia for a state funeral.\n\nSir Keith Macpherson Smith\n\nSir Keith Macpherson Smith was rejected from entering the Australian army on medical grounds. Following medical treatment he travelled to England and enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC which later became the RAF) in 1917. Following training he was posted to No. 58 Squadron RFC flying bombers in November 1917. The squadron was deployed to France in January 1918 but saw no combat. The following month he returned to England and flew with No. 75 Squadron RFC for home defence as a gunnery instructor and other training duties. He was discharged from the RAF on November 5th, 1919. Just in time to fly with his brother in the England to Australia Air Race! In later life he became the Australian representative for the Vickers company and also served as director for a number of airlines and companies including Qantas and Tasman Airways until his death in 1955.\n\nTheir Mark on Aviation History\n\nThe Smith brothers record for the fastest time flying from England to Australia would stand for 10 years. It was not until fellow Australian Bert Hinkler completed the journey in under 15.5 days in 1929, flying solo in an Avro Avian that the record was broken (the Australian government gave him £2000 for his effort). Hinkler also served during World War One as an observer in the Royal Naval Air Service where he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and as a pilot in 1918 in the RAF. Interestingly his application into the 1919 England to Australia Air Race to fly a Sopwith Dove was rejected at the time!\n\nIf you are ever at the Adelaide Airport I recommend taking a walk along the Smith Brothers Walking Trail to check out the Sir Ross & Sir Keith Smith War Memorial and Vickers Vimy G-EAOU. You will be impressed by the size of this big biplane but will also see how exposed to the elements the crew would have been on such a long and dangerous flight!\n\nReferences:\n\nAdelaide Now\n\nAir & Space Smithsonian – England to Australia in 1919\n\nAirways Museum – Vickers Vimy IV G-EAOU\n\nAirways Museum – England to Australia Air Race 1919\n\nAustralian Dictionary of Biography – Sir Ross and Sir Keith Smith\n\nAustralian War Memorial – Sir Ross Smith\n\nAustralian War Memorial – The 1919 Air Race\n\nThe Sir Ross & Sir Keith Smith Fund\n\nWikipedia – 1919 England to Australia Flight\n\nWikipedia – Vickers Vimy\n\nRoyal Yugoslav Air Force\n\nThe original Royal Yugoslav Air Force operated from 1918 to 1941 and at the start of World War Two was equipped with a large number of modern combat aircraft from numerous nations which were purchased directly and licence-built. These included Bristol Blenheim I (61), Dornier DO-17K (69) and Savoia-Marchetti SM.79K (40) bombers and fighters such as the Hawker Hurricane I (47), Messerschmitt Bf-109E-3 (73) and the home-grown Rogožarski IK-3 (11 with more under construction).\n\nWorld War Two\n\nIn total the Royal Yugoslav Air Force had over 460 aircraft and 2,000 pilots at the outbreak of war. This was soon null and void though as the air force ceased to exist following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, which commenced on April 6th, 1941 and ended in surrender by the Kingdom of Yugoslavia on April 18th, 1941.\n\nDespite a valiant fight and defence of Belgrade, the Royal Yugoslav Air Force was outnumbered and outgunned and many aircraft were destroyed or captured. The captured aircraft deemed useful were distributed to Axis nations including the newly formed Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia (but not the IK-3 as all of them were destroyed by their crews and factory employees to avoid them falling into German hands).\n\nA number of Royal Yugoslav Air Force aircraft escaped to Allied territories including a small number of Dornier DO-17K bombers that made it to Greece with as much of the country’s gold reserve they could carry, young King Peter II Karađorđević (1923-1970) and government members aboard. A large number of aircraft that made it to Greece in April 1941 were later destroyed on the ground following strafing attacks from German and Italian aircraft.\n\nKing Peter II joined his government in exile and in 1944 joined the RAF. He was never able to take back his throne though due to the communist dictatorship under Tito in Yugoslavia following World War Two. He died from cirrhosis of the liver as a wealthy but relatively young man of just 47 in exile in the United States.\n\nBalkan Air Force\n\nThe communist Yugoslav Air Force (Jugoslavensko Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo – JRV) was officially formed on January 5th, 1945. The JRV originated from British and Soviet trained and equipped air units operating in support of the Tito led communist partisan liberation of Yugoslavia from Axis control.\n\nYugoslav units primarily operated in the Royal Air Force (RAF) Balkan Air Force which was established on June 1st, 1944 to support Yugoslav partisans and remained in operation until July 15th, 1945. Many Yugoslav personnel also served in the Soviet Air Force, returning to Yugoslavia in 1944. Those serving with the RAF were amongst several hundred aircrew of the former Royal Yugoslav Air Force who had escaped to Greece then Egypt following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941.\n\nThe first Yugoslav manned squadron, RAF No. 352 (Yugoslavian) Squadron formed in Libya on April 22nd, 1944 flying Hawker Hurricane Mk.IIC fighter-bombers. Many of the pilots were ex-Royal Yugoslav Air Force. By August 18th, 1944 they were flying Supermarine Spitfire Mk.Vb fighters on combat missions in occupied Italy as part of No. 281 Wing of the Balkan Air Force and would later upgrade to Mk.Vc and Mk.IX Spitfires. The Yugoslav pilots conducted combat missions over Italy and Yugoslavia.\n\nRAF No. 351 (Yugoslavian) Squadron was formed in Libya on July 1st, 1944 flying Hawker Hurricane Mk.IIC fighter-bombers and re-equipped with the Hawker Hurricane Mk.IV in September 1944. The Yugoslav pilots went on to fly combat operations over Italy and Yugoslavia from October 1944 to May 16th, 1945 as part of No. 281 Wing of the Balkan Air Force. Their ground attack missions were naturally dangerous and 23 pilots including the Squadron Commander were lost in combat.\n\nOn May 18th, 1945 both No. 351 and No. 352 squadrons became part of the official Yugoslav Air Force, forming the 1st Fighter Regiment at Zadar Airport in Croatia and the RAF officially disbanded both squadrons on June 15th,1945 (the 1st Fighter Regiment was short-lived though and disbanded with personnel and equipment redistributed to other units at the end of August 1945). By wars end the pilots of No. 351 Squadron had flown 971 combat missions and No. 352 Squadron had flown 1210 missions.\n\nBy the end of World War Two, Yugoslav pilots and crews flying with the RAF and the Soviet Air Force had valuable combat experience, flying some 3,500 combat sorties and 5,500 operational flying hours. On September 12th, 1945, the Military Aviation School was formed in Belgrade to train future air force pilots.\n\nPost War Period\n\nThe air arm of Yugoslavia became one of the larger air forces in Europe with 40 squadrons by 1947. The initial inventory of the Yugoslav Air Force in 1944/45 was a mix of British and Soviet fighter aircraft that included the Supermarine Spitfire (18 Mk.Vc operated until 1954 – used as reconnaissance aircraft in later years of service and 3 Mk.IX operated from 1944 until 1945), Hawker Hurricane Mk.IV (over 20 operated from 1944 until 1951), Yakovlev Yak-3 (71 operated from 1944 to 1957) and Yakovlev Yak-9 (over 135 DD/P/M/U models from 1945 to 1957). The fighter aircraft flew alongside ground attack aircraft like the “flying tank” Ilyushin Il-2M3 Sturmovik (over 200 operated from 1944 with the last in service until 1955) and the Petlyakov Pe-2FT/UP-2 light bomber (over 150 in service from 1945 to 1954).\n\nThe British and Soviet aircraft were supplemented with 10 captured German/Croatian Messerschmitt Bf-109G fighters and post war more were sourced from the Bulgarian air force as part of the 1947 Paris Peace Treaty which limited the size of Bulgaria’s Air Force (a former member of Axis), thus aircraft were sent to Yugoslavia as part of a military equipment trade for Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik components (76 Bf-109 G-2, G-6, G-10 and G-12 models operated from 1947 until 1954 when they were withdrawn due to a lack of spares. Some were converted to two-seat trainers).\n\nAn example of many of these World War Two era aircraft can be seen today at the excellent Belgrade Aeronautical Museum in Serbia, which I was privileged to visit in November 2015. The museum at the Belgrade International Airport is a real treasure trove of aviation history and a must see for any aviation enthusiast (the building alone is worth taking a look at)!\n\nThe Breakaway from the Soviet Union\n\nIn the early years of the new Communist Yugoslavia, most equipment was supplied by the Soviet Union and the air force was operated much along the same lines of organisation as the Soviet system. Despite being a communist country, in June 1948 Yugoslavia had a major change in international relations and broke away from ties with the Stalinist Soviet Union. They came under intense pressure from the Soviets and as a result aircraft, spare parts, supplies etc. were cut off and the nation feared possible invasion. They did not resume relations on more friendly terms until the early 1960’s under Soviet Leader Nikita Khrushchev!\n\nHome Grown Fighter Aircraft\n\nThe serviceability of the Soviet supplied aircraft started to become an issue as spares declined and aircraft had to be picked apart for parts to keep others flying. This lead to the development of a domestic aviation industry, which in 1949 resulted in the home-grown Ikarus S-49 single piston engined fighter aircraft.\n\nThe Ikarus S-49 looks similar to the Yakovlev Yak-9 but was a new design based off an advanced development of the Rogožarski IK-3 fighter, previously operated by the Royal Yugoslav Air Force from 1940 to 1941. The S-49A model (45 in service from 1950) had a Soviet Klimov M-105 engine which was later replaced in 1952 with a Hispano-Suiza 12Z-17 engine in the S-49C model (113 in service from 1952). The S-49 with a top speed of 628 km/h / 390 mph and armed with an engine mounted 20mm cannon, two 12.7mm machine guns plus underwing bombs/rockets remained in service from 1950 to 1961 (the S-49A was retired in 1957) and a S-49C is on display at the Belgrade Aeronautical Museum.\n\nSourcing Non Soviet Combat Aircraft\n\nTo boost the air force inventory during this tense period other new aircraft were required and Great Britain and the United States stepped in to help. Yugoslavia purchased 77 powerful de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito FB.Mk.VI fighter-bombers in 1951-1952 (most were retired by 1960 but 9 were kept operational until 1963 with a sea-reconnaissance squadron and were mainly used as target tugs) and in 1952 they received 150 heavy hitting Republic F-47D-40-RE Thunderbolt aircraft that became the primary fighter-bomber of the Yugoslav Air Force (relegated to a training role in 1957 and retired by 1961). These new aircraft flew alongside the S-49 and the soviet era aircraft that could be maintained.\n\nA couple of great examples of these F-47D aircraft can be found at the Technical Museum Zagreb in Croatia (sporting a camouflage paint scheme) and the Belgrade Aeronautical Museum in Serbia (non-camouflage scheme). Always an impressive and powerful looking aircraft, the big Thunderbolt was a highly successful fighter-bomber in World War Two but soon enough, the jet age overtook even this venerable warrior.\n\nAlthough there was no direct aggression from the Soviet Union, further advancement of the air force was required to deter any such potential action. By 1953, Yugoslavia began to receive deliveries of jet trainers and a large number of combat jet aircraft from the United States, who wanted to curtail the Soviet influence across eastern Europe. There will be more on these early jet aircraft in my next post.\n\nReferences:\n\nAeroflight (World Air Forces)\n\nBelgrade Aviation Museum\n\nHistory.info (King Peter II)\n\nRAF No. 351 Squadron\n\nRAF No. 352 Squadron\n\nRAF Timeline 1944\n\nWikipedia (Royal Yugoslav Air Force)\n\nWikipedia (Yugoslav Air Force)\n\nWikipedia (RAF No. 351 Squadron)\n\nWikipedia (RAF No. 352 Squadron)\n\nPost World War Two\n\nThe communist Yugoslav Air Force (Jugoslavensko Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo – JRV) was officially formed on January 5th, 1945. The JRV originated from British and Soviet trained and equipped air units operating in support of the Josep Broz Tito led communist partisan liberation of Yugoslavia from Axis control during World War Two (April 6th, 1941 to May 15th, 1945).\n\nIn the post war period, Yugoslavia was primarily equipped with combat aircraft provided by the Soviet Union including large numbers of World War Two era Yakovlev Yak-3 and Yakovlev Yak-9 fighters with Ilyushin Il-2M3 Sturmovik ground attack aircraft and Petlyakov Pe-2FT/UP-2 light bombers. The JRV was also organised in much the same structure as the Soviet Air Force.\n\nThe Soviet Union and Yugoslavia Split Ties\n\nIn June 1948, communist Yugoslavia had a major change in international relations and broke away from ties with the Stalinist Soviet Union who were trying to exert more control in the defence affairs of Yugoslavia (although post war Yugoslavia had reduced the size of their army, the Soviets wanted them to maintain just a small army and rely on the Red Army to defend their nation. Yugoslav leader Tito was not keen on the offer made and didn’t like Soviet meddling especially with the attempt to recruit spies, agents etc. within the Yugoslav Army!). Josep Broz Tito had his own plan for Yugoslavia and was not going to be forced to follow the Soviet lead. As a result the Soviet Union under direct order from Joseph Stalin put the nation under intense political pressure, removing military advisors, banning Yugoslavia from the international association of socialist states, enacting a trade embargo and cut off the supply of aircraft, spare parts, supplies etc.\n\nThe threat of a possible Soviet invasion was feared right up until 1954 (Tito himself took on the role of Minister of Defence up until 1953 to maintain full control of the nation and the army was greatly expanded!), so in the early 1950’s this lead to the development in Yugoslavia of the home-grown Ikarus S-49 fighter and the acquisition of de Havilland Mosquito FB.Mk.VI and Republic F-47D Thunderbolt fighter-bombers from Great Britain and the United States to boost the operational capability of the JRV which was starting to experience aircraft serviceability problems. Please see my previous post for more details on the Yugoslav Air Force during the period of 1941 to 1952.\n\nUS President Harry S. Truman supported an independent Yugoslavia as it was in the best political interests of the United States too keep the Soviets out of that region of the Balkans. The United States and western allies were generous in providing around a billion dollars in military and economic aid to Tito in the 1950’s to drive Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union further apart. Despite the intentions of the United States, Yugoslavia maintained a non-aligned international status.\n\nYugoslavia Enters the Jet Age\n\nIn 1953 Yugoslavia entered the jet age with the supply from the United States of 219 Republic F-84G Thunderjet fighter bombers (operated until 1974. The majority were former USAF aircraft with a number also later sourced from Greece) and 33 Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star trainers to transition pilots into flying the new jet fighters (Yugoslavia ended up operating over 120 including RT-33 recon in 1955 and the US Navy TV-2 variant in 1961. The last 8 were converted to target tugs and operated until 1984). The dependency on the Soviet Union was truly over (for now).\n\nFurther advancement of JRV combat capability continued in 1956/57 with the supply of 43 former Royal Air Force (RAF) Canadair CL-13 Mk.IV Sabre jets. In 1959 more Sabre jets were purchased, this time being 78 North American F-86E Sabre fighters. The various Sabre fighters provided a major boost in combat capability for the JRV and the last was not retired until 1974.\n\nIn 1959 the JRV merged with the Yugoslav Army air defence units and was renamed the Yugoslav Air Force and Air Defence (Jugoslavensko Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo i Protivvazdushna Odbrana – JRViPVO). In 1961 Yugoslavia advanced further in their technological capability with the purchase from the United States of 130 North American F-86D Sabre Dog all-weather interceptors capable of a speed of Mach 0.91 and equipped with a nose radar and General Electric J47-GE-17B afterburning engine (ex-USAF examples. They were known as the “long nose Sabre” to Yugoslav airmen). The F-86D was armed with 24 × 2.75 in (70 mm) Mighty Mouse Mk 4 Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket (FFAR) rockets in ventral tray (no gun was fitted and the rockets were intended to shoot down enemy bombers) and the last F-86D was not retired until 1974.\n\nYugoslavia Enters the Supersonic Age\n\nBy the early 1960’s Yugoslavia began to resume relations on more friendly terms with the Soviet Union which experienced a change from the old Stalinist ways under Soviet Leader Nikita Khrushchev (in power from February 8th, 1955 to October 14th, 1964 he granted re-entry for Yugoslavia into the international association of socialist states). This improved situation lead to a major return to the Soviet Union for the supply of military equipment and particularly modern combat aircraft (Yugoslavia still maintained a non-aligned international status though). Military purchases from the United States soon dwindled away.\n\nIn 1962 Yugoslavia purchased 45 Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-21F-13 Fishbed C all-weather, radar equipped fighters capable of a maximum speed of Mach 2.0 (the last MiG-21F-13 was retired in 1980). The MiG-21 was the most advanced aircraft Yugoslavia had operated to that point in time.\n\nIn the following years the Soviet Union became the primary supplier of Yugoslavia’s combat aircraft with the delivery of many variants of the Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-21 Fishbed in the 1960’s and 1970’s. The MiG-21’s would go on to equip the 83rd Fighter Aviation Regiment (123rd and 130th Fighter Aviation Squadrons at Slatina Airbase, Kosovo), 117th Fighter Aviation Regiment (124th and 125th Fighter Aviation Squadrons; and the 352nd Reconnaissance Aviation Squadron at Željava Airbase, Bosnia-Herzegovina – see below for more information), 185th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment (129th Fighter Aviation Squadron at Pula, Croatia) and the 204th Fighter Aviation Regiment (126th, 127th and 128th Fighter Aviation Squadrons at Batajnica Airbase, Serbia).\n\nThe first MiG-21F-13 fighters were supplemented with 9 MiG-21U Mongol A two-seat trainer variants in 1965 (retired 1991), 36 MiG-21PFM Fishbed F in 1967 (retired 1994), 12 MiG-21R Fishbed H combat-capable reconnaissance aircraft in 1970 (retired by Serbia in 2003), 25 MiG-21M Fishbed J in 1970 (retired 1996), 9 MiG-21US Mongol B two-seat trainer variants in 1969 (retired 1991), 35 MiG-21UM Mongol B two-seat trainer variants in 1970 (some are likely to still be in service with the Serbian Air Force today), 6 MiG-21MF Fishbed J in 1975 (also retired in 1996) and 100 of the definitive MiG-21bis Fishbed L in 1977 (a small number remain in service with the Serbian Air Force today).\n\nŽeljava Airbase\n\nIt would be remiss of me to not mention the extraordinary Željava Airbase which was located right on the Croatian and Bosnia-Herzegovina border near the Bosnian city of Bihac. This was not only the largest airbase in the Yugoslavia with 5 runways, it was also built with huge reinforced concrete hangars, control rooms, maintenance facilities, barracks, secured communications systems, water and power facilities etc. all dug out under Mount Pljesevica. Apart from being an airbase, Željava was also the command centre for a central early warning air defence radar and interception network of Yugoslavia (think NORAD) which was linked to the “Celopek” intercept and surveillance radar atop Mount Pljesevica. The underground complex “KLEK” had 3.5 kilometres of tunnels (able to hold up to 80 aircraft), four main entrances with massive 100 ton pressurised doors (3 of which were for specially designed for aircraft entry/exit) and was built to withstand a direct hit from a 20 Kiloton nuclear bomb!\n\nCode-named “Objekat 505”, construction of the airbase started in 1948, the heavy concrete started pouring in 1958 and most of the construction was completed in 1965 at a massive cost with the airbase ready for operational duty in 1968 with the MiG-21 equipped 117th Fighter Aviation Regiment. Apparently the approximate cost of the base was $6 billion and this money came from World Bank funds intended to finance Yugoslav highway construction (said to be one of the most expensive military construction projects in Europe)!\n\nHeavily guarded the airbase was ringed by short-range radar and air defence systems including fixed missile sites and mobile 2K12 “Kub” / SA-6 “Gainful” surface to air missile systems. The base would go on to host newer types of 117th Fighter Aviation Regiment MiG-21 aircraft with the 124th and 125th Fighter Aviation Squadrons being equipped with MiG-21bis Fishbed L fighters and the 352nd Reconnaissance Aviation Squadron equipped with the MiG-21R Fishbed H.\n\nThe airbase was used by the JRViPVO in 1991 during the Yugoslav Wars before the runway was destroyed by withdrawing Yugoslav Peoples Army, then in 1992 Serbian forces set off further massive detonations with 56 tonnes of explosives to ensure the airbase could not be used by Croatian or Bosniak forces! Today it lays more or less derelict.\n\nHome-Grown Aviation\n\nThe change of policy back into the Soviet sphere at the height of the Cold War meant that by the 1970’s Yugoslavia could no longer necessarily look to the West for aircraft and spares and most US supplied aircraft were retired by 1974. Soviet aircraft were not always suitable to fill this void so the home-grown aviation industry was boosted to develop and supply training and attack jet aircraft to supplement the new Soviet supplied aircraft. In my next post I will discuss in detail this successful Yugoslav venture into home-grown aviation during the 1960’s and 1970’s.\n\nReferences:\n\nAcademic.ru (Željava Air Base)\n\nAeroflight (World Air Forces)\n\nBelgrade Aviation Museum\n\nCountry-Data.com (Yugoslavia)\n\nElektron\n\nForgotten Airfields (Željava Air Base)\n\nWikipedia (Yugoslav Air Force)\n\nWikipedia (Željava Air Base)\n\nIn my previous post I discussed the June 1948 break in ties between communist Yugoslavia and the Stalinist Soviet Union, who were trying to exert more control in the defence affairs of Yugoslavia. As a result the Yugoslav Air Force (JRV) needed to look to NATO countries, especially the United States for the supply of combat aircraft. Note: In 1959 the JRV merged with the Yugoslav Army air defence units and was renamed the Yugoslav Air Force and Air Defence (Jugoslavensko Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo i Protivvazdushna Odbrana – JRViPVO).\n\nIn the early 1960’s Yugoslavia under the leadership of Tito began to resume relations on more friendly terms with the Soviet Union which experienced a change from the old Stalinist ways under Soviet Leader Nikita Khrushchev. He was the Soviet leader from February 8th, 1955 to October 14th, 1964 and granted re-entry for Yugoslavia into the International Association of Socialist States which was a significant herald back into the fold.\n\nThis improved diplomatic situation with the Soviet Union lead to a major return to them for the supply of military equipment and particularly modern combat aircraft (Yugoslavia still maintained a non-aligned international status though). Military purchases from the United States soon dwindled away and from 1962 the Yugoslav Air Force entered the supersonic jet age when it started to re-equip with the Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-21 Fishbed fighter aircraft supplied by the Soviet Union.\n\nHome-Grown Aviation\n\nThe change of policy back into the Soviet sphere in the early 1960’s, at the height of the Cold War meant that by the 1970’s Yugoslavia could no longer necessarily look to the West for aircraft and spares and most US supplied aircraft were retired by 1974. Soviet aircraft were not always suitable to fill this void, so the home-grown aviation industry was boosted to develop and supply a fascinating mix of effective training and attack jet aircraft to supplement the new Soviet supplied aircraft. This venture proved highly successful and produced a number of aircraft that saw service with the JRViPVO and a small number of foreign nations.\n\nA strong domestic arms industry was also important to ensure that a total dependency on the Soviet Union for weapons and equipment was not established. This was especially so in light of the Soviet / Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 when that communist nation started to have some rumblings of political liberalisation reforms and was crushed for doing so!\n\nAeronautical Technical Institute and Soko\n\nThe Aeronautical Technical Institute (VTI Žarkovo – Vazduhoplovnotehnički institut Žarkovo) was established near Belgrade, Serbia in 1946 to design and develop military aircraft for Yugoslavia. The organisation was in operation until 1992 when Yugoslavia dissolved, it then became part of the Military Technical Institute Belgrade (VTI – Vojnotehnički Institut Beograd). The Aeronautical Technical Institute developed a number of successful piston engined trainers and jet aircraft used for training and combat purposes.\n\nThe combat aircraft and trainers were manufactured by the Mostar based aviation company Soko (established in 1950 following the relocation of the Ikarus aviation manufacturing division. Soko means Falcon). General aviation aircraft were manufactured by Utva Aviation Industry in Pančevo, Serbia.\n\nCombat capable aircraft produced by Soko in the 1960’s and 1970’s included:\n\nG-2A (N-60) Galeb\n\nThe Soko G-2A (N-60) Galeb (Seagull) two-seat trainer and light attack aircraft introduced in July 1965 was the first jet aircraft designed and built in Yugoslavia (fitted with a licence built Rolls Royce/Bristol Siddeley Viper turbojet engine). It was designed to replace the Lockheed T-33 and is said to have been a very good training aircraft and was known as “Old Galeb” to its pilots. Unlike many of its contemporaries from other nations the G-2A had a fixed armament of 2 x 12.7 mm (.50 in) nose mounted machine guns and could also carry a weapons payload up to 300 kg (660 lb) on 4 underwing hard points.\n\nSoko G-2A (N-60) Galeb production continued until 1981 and they manufactured 132 examples for the Yugoslav Air Force primarily for cadet combat training at the VVA (Military Air Force Academy) units but the type also saw combat during the Bosnian War 1992-1995 with the 105th Fighter-Bomber Regiment of the Yugoslav Air Force. Most were retired by 1999 the last was still in service with Serbia until 2002 (a number of former Yugoslav examples were also operated by Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia but are all now retired). Libya was the biggest export customer of the G-2A, with 116 aircraft (production was extended from until mid 1983 for Libya) and a small number were also delivered to Indonesia, Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Zambia.\n\nP-2 (J-20) Kraguj\n\nThe Soko P-2 (J-20) Kraguj (Sparrow Hawk) single seat close support, counter insurgency (COIN) propeller driven aircraft was introduced in March 1967. This aircraft was conceived as a “partisan aircraft” capable of short landings and take-off’s from rough fields, roads etc. particularly in the many mountains of Yugoslavia with no special preparation (this was especially handy in the advent that an aggressor took out the runways of the main airbases). Primarily it was intended to be used in low-altitude day and night COIN and anti-helicopter missions with an armament of 2 x wing mounted 7.7 mm Colt–Browning Mk-II machine guns with 650 rounds each and a variety of under wing weapons including rockets and bombs. They were also used for day and night pilot training.\n\n85 P-2 (J-20) were manufactured but all were retired by the Yugoslav Air Force in 1989 and handed over to the republic’s Territorial Defense Headquarters. In addition to the JRViPVO both Croatia and the Republika Srpska Air Force previously operated the type following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. No doubt a number of them saw some combat duties during the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990’s.\n\nJ-1 (J-21) Jastreb\n\nThe Soko J-1 (J-21) Jastreb (Hawk) single seat ground attack aircraft, introduced in 1969, was a development of the two-seat G-2A Galeb trainer as a replacement for the Republic F-84 Thunderjet in the Yugoslav Air Force. Armament consisted of 3 x 12.7 mm (0.5 in) nose mounted machine guns and 8 underwing weapons pylons capable of carrying bombs, rockets and napalm tanks. Powered by a licence built Rolls-Royce Viper Mk.531 turbojet, the J-21 had a top speed of 820 km/h (510 mph) and could take off from rough and short fields with the assistance of JATO rockets.\n\nThe Yugoslav Air Force operated 103 J-21’s, with Serbia retiring the type in 1996 (many examples sit in the yard next to the Belgrade Aeronautical Museum in the Serbian Air Force “boneyard” – more on this in a future post). The Republika Srpska Air Force operated J-21’s allocated from the JRViPVO during the Bosnian War (1992-1995) and lost around 6 J-21’s after violating the NATO no-fly-zone, 4 more were retired before being merged into the Armed Forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 2006, who continue to operate around 12 J-21’s today for training and ground attack purposes (the Republika Srpska Air Force was originally formed to protect the Serbian population in Bosnia-Herzegovina). The Free Libyan Air Force possibly operate some examples from the 34 aircraft originally delivered to Libya. Examples operated by Croatia and Zambia (13 were delivered) are retired.\n\nSoko also manufactured a single seat tactical reconnaissance variant of the J-1 Jastreb which was designated the Soko RJ-1 (IJ-21) Jastreb. It was equipped with cameras in fuselage and wing tip tanks. This variant was introduced into Yugoslav service in 1969 and 38 were manufactured with the last retired by 1996.\n\nIn 1975 the Soko TJ-1 (NJ-21) Jastreb two-seat advanced trainer and light attack aircraft was introduced with only 14 manufactured (NJ = Nastavni Jurisnik i.e. Attack Trainer). The last example was retired in 1996\n\nIJ-22 Orao 1\n\nThe Soko J-22 Orao 1 (Eagle 1) twin-engine (non afterburning licence-built Rolls Royce Viper Mk 622-41R turbojet engines) subsonic attack and reconnaissance aircraft, capable of operating from unprepared or damaged airfields was developed in the early 1970’s as a joint Yugoslavian (Soko) / Romanian (IAR) project (to reduce development expenses). The first Yugoslav prototype flew on October 31st, 1974 and the Orao soon became the pride of Yugoslav aviation designers. Initially there was the single seat IJ-22 reconnaissance variant then the J-22 attack variant.\n\nAlthough the MiG-21 Fishbed can conduct air to surface operations, its munitions payload is rather limited in regards to the number and types of bombs, rockets and missiles it can carry. The Orao 1 was developed to supplement this ground attack capability void and was initially armed with 4 x 30 mm NR-30 cannons, then 2 x twin barrelled 23mm Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23 cannons with four underwing and one centreline hard points with the ability to drop laser guided bombs and fire air to surface missiles such as the Soviet designed/Yugoslav modified Zvezda Kh-23 Grom and US designed AGM-65 Maverick missiles. Orao 1 aircraft saw combat service in the Yugoslav Wars (1991-1995) and over Kosovo in 1999.\n\n27 Soko IJ-22/J-22 Orao 1 single seat aircraft were introduced into Yugoslav service 1978. The first were delivered to the 351st AIE Reconnaissance Aviation Squadron at Cerklje and the 353rd IAE Reconnaissance Aviation Squadron at Mostar. The single seat Orao 1 variant was retired in 1997 (2 were prototypes and 8 were converted to the J-22M Orao 2 variant).\n\n8 Soko INJ-22 Orao 1 two-seat trainer aircraft were introduced in 1977 (first flew November 1976) but during its operational service with the Yugoslav Air Force they were actually used for tactical reconnaissance carrying a centerline pod fitted with optical and/or Infra Red sensors. This variant was retired in 1997 (6 were later converted to the NJ-22 Orao 2D variant).\n\nModernisation of the Yugoslav Air Force\n\nIn the 1980’s with an ageing air fleet the Yugoslav Air Force and Air Defence (JRViPVO) looked once again to the Soviet Union and their own aviation industry to modernise their combat capability. The Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-29 Fulcrum multi-role fighter was a key component of this modernisation. By the 1990’s Yugoslavia was in turmoil and the former Yugoslav republics were at war. More on the introduction of the MiG-29 Fulcrum and other aircraft such at the Super Galeb, along with the JRViPVO role in the Yugoslav Wars of 1991-1995 will be discussed in my next post.\n\nReferences:\n\nAeroflight (World Air Forces)\n\nAeroflight (Soko J-22 Orao)\n\nBelgrade Aviation Museum\n\nCountry-Data.com (Yugoslavia)\n\nElektron\n\nForged in War, Dedicated to Peace\n\nWikipedia (Aeronautical Technical Institute)\n\nWikipedia (Soko J-22 Orao)\n\nWikipedia (Yugoslav Air Force)\n\nIn the 1980’s the Yugoslav Air Force and Air Defence (Jugoslavensko Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo i Protivvazdushna Odbrana – JRViPVO) backbone was the Soviet supplied Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-21 Fishbed fighter aircraft. Yugoslavia received 277 MiG-21 variants in total between 1962 and 1977. Many older variants were retired during the 1980’s and 1990’s but the definitive version, the 100 MiG-21bis Fishbed L fighters delivered in 1977, continued to be the primary frontline fighter of the JRViPVO in the 1980’s and 1990’s.\n\nThe MiG-21’s were supplemented by attack aircraft developed by the Yugoslavian aviation industry, such as the Soko J-1 (J-21) Jastreb (Hawk) ground attack aircraft and the Soko J-22 Orao 1 (Eagle 1) attack and reconnaissance aircraft but these were aircraft developed in the 1960’s and 1970’s. By the 1980’s the JRViPVO needed to modernize its aircraft to keep pace with the NATO and Warsaw Pact nations that surrounded the borders of Yugoslavia.\n\nA modern fighter was a key requirement and although the Vazduhoplovno Tehnicki Institut (VTI – Aeronautical Technical Institute) were working on the development of a fourth generation fighter aircraft to enter service in the 1990’s, once again Yugoslavia had to look to the Soviets to provide an aircraft to cover an operational gap. The solution was pretty immediate in the form of the highly capable Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-29 Fulcrum multi-role fighter. New home-grown developments were also key to this modernization including a new attack aircraft in the Soko J-22M Orao 2 (Eagle 2) and a new advanced trainer in the form of the Soko G-4 Super Galeb to supply suitably trained pilots to fly modern aircraft.\n\nG-4 Super Galeb\n\nThe Soko G-4 (N-62) Super Galeb two-seat advanced trainer and light attack aircraft first flew in 1978 and was introduced into the Yugoslav Air Force in 1983/84 as a replacement for the G-2A Galeb. 90 G-4 aircraft were manufactured for the Yugoslav Air Force and the type remains in service today with the former Yugoslavian republics of Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro and Croatia (civil purposes), plus a small number operating in the Myanmar Air Force (Burma).\n\nThe Super Galeb has excellent flight characteristics and maneuverability, and received a significant boost in power over its predecessor with the types licence-built Rolls Royce Viper 632-46 turbojet engine, which provides a maximum speed of 920 km/h / 572 mph (the top speed of the G-2 Galeb was 812 km/h / 505 mph). Avionics include communications and navigation equipment, fire control and weapons systems including a gyro gunsight and naturally defensive sensors and systems.\n\nAlthough primarily a trainer the Super Galeb is well suited to the light ground attack role and armament can include a twin-barrel GSh-23L 23 mm cannon in a ventral gun pod with 200 rounds) along with various unguided bombs and rockets on 4 underwing pylons. There is also provision to fit a reconnaissance pod with cameras and an Infra Red line scanner.\n\nJ-22M Orao 2\n\n50 new Soko J-22M Orao 2 (Eagle 2) attack and reconnaissance aircraft capable of operating from unprepared or damaged airfields were introduced in 1986 plus 8 converted from the earlier IJ-22 Orao 1 variant (the Orao 2 prototype first flew on October 20th,1983). The Orao 2 was an improved version of the Orao 1 (which was first developed in the 1970’s and introduced into service in 1978) with upgraded avionics including a new radar and a Thomson-CSF VE-120T HUD, extended wing leading-edge roots, increased fuel and weapons payload and afterburning licence-built Rolls Royce Viper Mk.633-41 engines.\n\nThe Orao 2 is armed with 2 x twin barrelled 23mm Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23 cannons and features four underwing and one centreline hard points with the ability to drop laser guided bombs, fire air to surface missiles such as the Soviet designed/Yugoslav modified Zvezda Kh-23 Grom and US designed AGM-65 Maverick missiles along with carrying a reconnaissance pod fitted with cameras and Infra Red sensors.\n\n12 new Soko NJ-22M Orao 2 two-seat trainer and reconnaissance variants were also introduced in 1986, plus 6 that were converted from the earlier INJ-22 Orao 1 variant. Orao 2 aircraft saw combat service in the Yugoslav Wars (1991-1995) and over Kosovo in 1999. Both the single and two-seat variants vastly improved the capability of the original home-grown Orao 1 design and the Orao 2 remains in service with the Serbian Air Force today.\n\nThe prototype Orao 2 (serial number 25101) made Yugoslavian aviation history when being flown by test pilot Marjan Jelen over Batajnica Air Base on November 22nd, 1984. Whilst in a shallow dive of 15 degrees the aircraft exceeded Mach 1.0 and broke the sound barrier. This was the first ever Yugoslav designed and manufactured aircraft to go supersonic! Alas it was only capable of this feat in a dive and remained a subsonic aircraft in level flight.\n\nEnter the Fulcrum\n\nYugoslavia was one of the first export customers for the Soviet era Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-29 Fulcrum multi-role fighter. The JRViPVO received 14 MiG-29A Fulcrum A (L-18 – with L being for “Lovac” or Hunter and 18 simply being the type designation) single seaters and two MiG-29UB Fulcrum B (NL-18) two-seat trainers from the Soviet Union in 1987 and 1988. The MiG-29’s provided a huge boost in capability and prestige for the JRViPVO as the first highly maneuverable and highly capable modern multi-role aircraft to enter Yugoslav service. As such they received a high priority posting and were operated by the 127th Fighter Aviation Squadron “Knights” at Batajnica Air Base near Belgrade in Serbia.\n\nYugoslavia did not purchase that many MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters as it was more or less seen as a stop-gap measure while the Novi Avion fourth generation multi-role fighter was developed for service entry in the mid to late 1990’s (see below for more information on this fighter). Despite the small number in service, MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters saw combat service in the Yugoslav Wars (1991-1995) and over Kosovo in 1999.\n\nNovi Avion – Yugoslavia’s Proposed Fourth Generation Multi-Role Fighter\n\nIn the 1980’s Yugoslav military aviation planners recognized the need to continue to develop home-grown aircraft to not only strengthen Yugoslavia but also replace a large number of ageing and steadily obsolete Soviet and Yugoslav designed combat aircraft. They also would need to replace the stop-gap MiG-29’s that were purchased to provide a modern multi-role fighter capability until the home-grown development could enter Yugoslav Air Force service.\n\nThe proposed Novi Avion (“New Aircraft”) was a single-engine delta-canard fourth generation multi-role fighter that would have been built by Soko Aviation based in Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina. It was intended to be capable of a speed of Mach 1.8 and was possibly going to be powered by a licence built French Snecma M88 afterburning turbofan engine (as used in the Dassault Rafale).\n\nThe Novi Avion would have been fitted with advanced digital flight controls, avionics, radar and weapons systems including a glass cockpit. Armament would have consisted of a 30mm cannon with wingtip hardpoints for most likely French Matra short-range air-to-air missiles and multiple underwing pylons for medium range air-to-air missiles and other guided/unguided ordnance for air-to-ground missions. No doubt a reconnaissance pod with cameras and Infra Red sensors could also have been fitted for reconnaissance missions.\n\nThe project was first commenced by the Belgrade based Vazduhoplovno Tehnicki Institut (VTI – Aeronautical Technical Institute) in the 1980’s and received some French technical assistance in regards to multi-mode radar and other advanced features but was cancelled in 1991 following the start of the break up of the former Yugoslavia, which lead to the 1991 to 1995 Yugoslav Wars. This ambitious aviation project met its demise at the hands of budget constraints, war and the resulting end of the Soko Aviation company (more on that in my next post).\n\nAlthough an all Yugoslav design, the 1983 concept drawing of the Novi Avion looked much like a delta-canard heavily influenced by the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. Later concept images looked more like a single engine Dassault Rafale.\n\nExpected to enter service in the mid to late 1990’s, the 150+ planned Novi Avion fighters would have replaced the MiG-21 Fishbed and eventually the MiG-29 Fulcrum in JRViPVO service and meant that Yugoslavia was no longer dependant on other nations for modern multi-role combat aircraft (this no doubt would have also opened up a new aircraft export stream too). Sadly a lost dream for Yugoslav aviation that would, in the long run, prove to be very costly for the capability and effectiveness of the Yugoslav Air Force.\n\nThe Yugoslav Wars\n\nBy the 1990’s Yugoslavia was in turmoil, the former Yugoslav republics were at war and slowly but surely the nation was torn apart kicking and screaming. In my next post I will discuss the role of the JRViPVO in the Yugoslav Wars of 1991-1995 and the Kosovo War in 1999. These are the wars that lead to the eventual demise of the Yugoslav Air Force.\n\nReferences:\n\nAeroflight (World Air Forces)\n\nAeroflight (Soko J-22 Orao)\n\nBelgrade Aviation Museum\n\nGlobal Security – Novi Avion\n\nWikipedia (Aeronautical Technical Institute)\n\nWikipedia (Soko J-22 Orao)\n\nWikipedia (Yugoslav Air Force)\n\nIn the decades following World War Two, the socialist state of Yugoslavia became a seemingly wonderful, vibrant place with diverse cultures and strong leadership under Josip Broz Tito. In reality as the decades rolled on, the nations republics experienced economic, political, nationalist and ideological problems that worsened in the 1980’s. The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics highlighted the beauty of the country but all was not as it seemed.\n\nIndependence Rumblings in Yugoslavia\n\nThe former Yugoslavia was made up of 6 socialist republics: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia. Serbia controlled the seat of Yugoslav political power in Belgrade and also contained two autonomous socialist provinces in Kosovo and Vojvodina.\n\nAlthough a Serbian population lived across Yugoslavia, each republic was ethnically and religiously diverse (i.e. Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats, Muslim Bosniaks etc.) and cultural differences were abound. By the late 1980’s through to the early 1990’s each republic began to see a rise in nationalism from their different ethnic majorities, that was not necessarily the same vision as that of Serbia.\n\nWhen the iconic and revered communist Yugoslav leader (described as a benevolent dictator!), Josip Broz Tito (May 7th, 1892 – May 4th, 1980) was alive he had the wide support of the people and most definitely the Yugoslav army (JNA). Tito seemed to keep the 6 socialist republics unified together with his personality and steely determination (he was the Yugoslav partisan leader from 1941-1945 and lead the country from 1944 until his death in 1980).\n\nAfter Tito’s death, slowly but surely 5 of the 6 Yugoslav republics did not want Serbia to dominate their politics and economy and wanted independence. Other parts of eastern Europe were experiencing the same sort of changes which lead to the downfall of Communism in the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact nations. Yugoslavia was headed the same way.\n\nThe Yugoslav Wars 1991 to 1995\n\nSoon enough war broke out in Yugoslavia as the Belgrade communist government tried to hold the nation together. What followed was years of fighting and heavy bloodshed to seek independence. The lines of who was right, who was wrong became very blurred during this bleak period of Yugoslav history. The primary conflicts were as follows:\n\nWar in Slovenia (June 27th, 1991 to July 7th, 1991):\n\nKnown as the 10 Day War or the Slovenian Independence War it saw a brief conflict following the Slovenian declaration of independence on June 25th, 1991. The Yugoslav Army (JNA) started to seize border crossings under extreme protest from local Slovenians and eventually the Slovenian Territorial Defence Force started to strike back at the Yugoslav Army units. Yugoslavian air strikes commenced but the momentum was with Slovenia who ultimately won when a ceasefire was agreed and Yugoslav forces withdrew from the conflict (despite the Slovenians being outnumbered by the Yugoslav Army their swift actions, along with international pressure and the fact that the republic did not have a significant Serbian population lead to the back down). This was the beginning of further wars within the former Yugoslavia.\n\nCroatian War of Independence (March 31st, 1991 to November 12th, 1995 ):\n\nAlso known as the Homeland War, this conflict was fought by the defence forces of the Croatian government initially against the Yugoslav Army (JNA) until 1992 and local Serbian forces formed as the self declared Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) until 1995. With a large Serb population this was a bloody and long war that saw cities put under Serbian siege and atrocities committed by both sides.\n\nA United Nations ceasefire was arranged in 1992 and the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was the first UN Peacekeeping Force in Croatia. It was formed in February 1992 and remained until March 1995. They were there to ensure conditions for peace talks and security in three demilitarized “safe-haven” enclaves could be established plus establish some border controls and control a demilitarized zone near Dubrovnik.\n\nDespite the ceasefire agreement, sporadic fighting continued and another ceasefire was brokered in 1994. Eventually Croatia ignored the ceasefire and an arms embargo to rearm via smugglers and arms dealers. They went on to conduct two major offenses, Operation Flash (May 1st-3rd,1995) and Operation Storm (August 4th-7th, 1995) to regain lost territory and defeat the Republic of Serbian Krajina (Bosnia-Herzegovina was also able to reclaim its western region during this battle). Serbia did not step in to directly aid their allies and by the summer of 1995 Serbian Krajina ceased to exist.\n\nBosnian War (April 6th, 1992 to December 14th, 1995):\n\nA brutal conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina that saw Bosniaks pitted against both Croatian forces and Serbian Forces. The Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia existed from 1991 to 1994 and was initially an ally of the Bosniaks until 1993, when they turned on them (this remains a very sore point in Mostar even today i.e. signs can be seen with “Don’t Forget ’93”!). Serbian forces were predominately from the independent state of Republika Srpska which was declared within northern Bosnia and Herzegovina on January 9th, 1992 as they associated themselves as Serbian not Bosniak (their capital became Banja Luka) and the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK). Serbian paramilitary forces also were involved in the conflict.\n\nThe United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) entered Bosnia-Herzegovina in June 1992 but they were not there as a peacekeeping force, they were there to stop the killing of civilians until the war ended. They protected what was left of the Sarajevo airport and provided security for humanitarian aid convoys to and from the city and airport. From September 1992 they also provided security for aid convoys to other parts of the country. In April 1993 they were tasked with the protection of safe areas (including the infamous Srebrenica) and monitored the weapons free zones as designated in the US brokered February 1994 cease fire.\n\nDespite the UN presence, the Bosnian War was a bloody one, with sieges and heavy destruction of Mostar (April 1992 to December 1993) and Sarajevo (April 1992 to February 1996 – even after the war officially ended in December 1995! Killing over 11,000 people). In February 1994 NATO were authorised to conduct air strikes on Serbian artillery and mortar positions in or around Sarajevo at UNPROFOR request.\n\nNATO commenced Operation Deny Flight on April 12th, 1993 to create a no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina to attempt to stop Serbian air attacks particularly on civilian population centres. The operation ended on December 20th, 1995 with NATO pilots having flown 100,420 sorties including air strikes to support UN forces during the conflict. Despite this the local Serbian forces seemed to have still conducted many obviously low-level air missions to try and keep below NATO radar.\n\nEven worse, acts of war crimes such as ethnic cleansing (starting in 1992) and genocide in Srebrenica (1995) were part of this terrible Bosnian War. On July 12th, 1995 the UNPROFOR was not able to reinforce the Dutch battalion in Srebrenica and thus failed to deter Bosnian Serb forces who attacked and overrun the town. They went on to sadly kill more than 8,000 Muslim Bosnians, mostly men and boys who lived in that area.\n\nNATO also conducted Operation Deliberate Force over Bosnia and Herzegovina from August 30th, 1995 to September 20th, 1995. This was an air campaign in conjunction with UN ground forces to damage the capability of the Bosnian Serb ground forces that were threatening to attack UN “safe areas”. Srebrenica was a major trigger for this action. Deliberate Force involved 400 aircraft and 5,000 personnel from 15 nations. They hit 338 Bosnian Serb targets and dropped over 1,000 mostly laser guided bombs during the campaign.\n\nA peace deal between Bosniak, Croat and Serbian representatives, witnessed by the United States, Russia, France, UK, Germany and the European Union was brokered in Dayton, Ohio in 1995 to end the Bosnian War (the Dayton Agreement was drafted in November 1995 and formally signed in Paris on December 14th, 1995). On December 20th, 1995 the NATO led Implementation Force (IFOR) took over from UN forces and were tasked with implementing the Dayton Agreement peace deal.\n\nMacedonia and Montenegro:\n\nOn September 8th, 1991 Macedonia peacefully became independent of the former Yugoslavia and was not involved in the Yugoslav Wars (they made some small changes to their border with Yugoslavia to avoid issues). As was the way in the Balkans though, they were involved in a short conflict between February and August 2001 with ethnic Albanian insurgents that were seeking an independent state within parts of Macedonia following the Kosovo conflict. This was settled with the aid of NATO intervention via a ceasefire monitoring force.\n\nMontenegro remained with Serbia as part of the former Yugoslavia (became the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) and fought alongside them during the regional conflicts. Montenegro remained in this partnership until they voted to peacefully secede in 2006.\n\nInternational Reaction:\n\nThe international community accused Serbia of supporting Serbian rebels in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serbia was suspended from most international organisations and had international political, economic and military sanctions imposed upon the nation. Economic woes soon followed but Serbia remained the main source of funding, equipment, ammunition and assistance in military planning for forces such as those from the Republika Srpska until 1995.\n\nSerbian and Yugoslav Leadership during the Yugoslav Wars\n\nDuring this time of turmoil Serbian Slobodan Milošević (August 20th, 1941 – March 11th, 2006) was the President of Serbia from 1989 to 1997 (a republic then within Yugoslavia) and the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1997 to 2000. He was instrumental in much of the turmoil and fighting within the former Yugoslavia. Milošević was tried in absentia by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 1999 for war crimes instigated by Serbian forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Kosovo.\n\nMilošević retained power until overwhelming demonstrations forced him to resign from the Presidency in 2000 (following the disputed September 24th, 2000 elections) and he was arrested by Federal Yugoslav authorities on March 31st, 2001 on the suspicion of corruption and embezzlement. These charges lacked evidence and he was handed over to the ICTY to face the war crimes charges instead.\n\nMilošević declared the tribunal illegal as it was not established by the UN General Assembly and went on to defend himself during the 5 year legal trial which ended without a verdict when he passed away from a heart attack during imprisonment at The Hague in 2006. In 2007 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Milošević and Serbia were not directly involved in the genocide committed by Bosnian Serbs in the Bosnian War but ruled that he and others in Serbian command failed to prevent the genocide from occurring and did not cooperate with the ICTY to punish those that did commit the action of genocide.\n\nYugoslav Air Force in the Yugoslav Wars\n\nNaturally the Yugoslav Air Force (JRViPVO) had aircraft based across the former Yugoslavian republics. With the outbreak of these newly declared nations leaving Yugoslavia, most of the aircraft based in these countries were flown back to Serbia and Montenegro, which remained as Yugoslavia (as it was in 1991) and operated them from home soil during the wars. Other aircraft were allocated to the local Serbian forces of the Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Serbian Krajina in Croatia (see below for more information).\n\nWhen talking about the Yugoslav Air Force, things get messy during the split of Yugoslavia resulting from the 1991 to 1995 Yugoslav Wars as it basically ceased to exist as that nation’s air force in early 1992. For the sake of completion of the discussion, I will continue to give an overview of the air combat which was predominately backed by Serbia who attempted to keep Yugoslavia together by force and operated as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Given that the key combat aircraft were in the hands of the Yugoslav Air Force (and their local Serbian allies) and later NATO enforced no-fly zones, there was very little air to air combat between the forces of the former Yugoslavian republics during the Yugoslav Wars.\n\nIn 1991 the Yugoslav Air Force (JRViPVO) began launching air strikes in Slovenia on TV transmitters and Slovenian Territorial Defence Force positions. Upon the ceasefire in July 1991 the aircraft were withdrawn from the conflict with no loss of combat jet aircraft (6 helicopters were lost). As war broke out in Croatia in 1991 the Yugoslav Air Force was soon launching air strikes against Croat targets. Hostilities continued in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992.\n\nTheJRViPVO officially disbanded in April 1992 and surviving aircraft became part of various national air forces within the former Yugoslavia. The bulk of the aircraft formed the new Air Force of Serbia and Montenegro (Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo Srbije i Crne Gore – RVSiCG) which was now the Air Force of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and operated approximately 300 aircraft with 16,000 personnel from April 27th, 1992 to June 3rd, 2006 when Montenegro voted to secede from the former Yugoslavia (Serbia then reverted to the old Royal Yugoslav Air Force roundel). The bulk of the remaining aircraft then formed what is todays Serbian Air Force and Air Defence.\n\nMiG-21’s in Combat\n\nThe MiG-21 was primarily operated by the Yugoslav Air Force in the ground attack role during the Yugoslav Wars. 7 were shot down by anti-aircraft fire over Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. One air to air incident ended in much controversy when a Yugoslav MiG-21 shot down a 1992 European Community Monitor Mission helicopter on January 7th, 1992, killing 4 Italian and 1 French military personnel). The MiG-21 pilot, Emir Šišić was sentenced to imprisonment by a Croatian court but he had fled and was not arrested until 2001 in Hungary. He was taken to Italy and sentenced to 15 years jail. In 2006 he was sent to Serbia to complete the sentence but was released in 2008. Serbia was ordered to pay monetary compensation to the victims families.\n\nCroatian Air Force MiG-21’s\n\nCroatia first operated 3 MiG-21bis fighters during the Croatian War of Independence (2 were later shot down). The aircraft had been flown into the country in 1992 by defecting Yugoslav Air Force pilots of Croatian descent who helped form the Croatian Air Force which was established on December 12th, 1991. In 1993 Croatia purchased up to 40 more MiG-21bis/UM’s from various sources to counter those operated by the Yugoslav Air Force. This purchase contravened an arms embargo (half those purchased by Croatia were used for spares and at least 1 was lost in combat operations).\n\nOne interesting defection by a Yugoslav Air Force MiG-21 pilot of Croatian descent was made into Austria on October 25th, 1991 by Rudolf Perešin (March 25th, 1958 – May 2nd, 1995 and a 10 year Yugoslav Air Force pilot). Perešin became the first Croatian pilot to defect and it is said his actions were a great morale boost to Croatian forces (he declared he could not fire against his native Croatia). He had apparently secreted his family to safety a few weeks before, then whilst on a reconnaissance flight in a Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-21R Fishbed H, diverted course and flew to Klagenfurt, Austria from Željava Air Base (near the border of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina).\n\nRudolf Perešin then headed back to Croatia and flew on their side until sadly killed in action when shot down by Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) ground fire on May 2nd, 1995 during Operation Flash. His body was not recovered until 1997 and Perešin was buried with full military honours on September 15th, 1997 in Zagreb. The Croatian Air Force Flying School in Zadar is named in his honour.\n\nThe MiG-21R (number 26112) flown by Perešin into Austria was retained and is today displayed in its original Yugoslav markings at the Austrian Air Force Museum in Zeltweg, where I saw it in October 2015. Apparently the airframe is still a cause of international dispute over ownership between Serbia and Croatia!.\n\nCroatian MiG-21bis fighters were used for ground attack missions during the decisive 1995 Operations Flash and Storm which sealed Croatian victory in the Croatian War of Independence (only 1 MiG-21 was lost during Operation Flash which was flown by Rudolf Perešin). They operated in conjunction with 12 Mil Mi-24V Hind helicopter gunships that were delivered from the Ukraine in 1993. Air to air combat seems to have been scarce for Croatian pilots with the only known incident occurring on August 7th, 1995 when 2 Croatian MiG-21’s intercepted Republika Srpska Air Force Soko J-22 Orao attack aircraft but following some maneuvering both sides ended up disengaging without firing.\n\n12 Croatian MiG-21’s were upgraded in 2003 to the MiG-21bisD (8) and MiG-21UMD (4) standard with new navigation and communication systems to be interoperable with NATO aircraft and were updated again in 2014 (7 Croatian air frames plus 5 from the Ukrainian company completing the upgrade). The 2014 upgraded aircraft are scheduled to remain in service until 2020.\n\nMiG-29 in Combat\n\nThe then relatively new MiG-29’s were used for Combat Air Patrols by the Yugoslav Air Force along the Austrian and Hungarian borders during the War in Slovenia in 1991 but saw no combat. They assumed a limited ground attack role in the first years of fighting in Croatia during 1991-1992 and were used to strike targets in Croatia in 1991 including airfields (destroying some Antonov An-2 Colt light transports) and the seat of the Croatian government at the Banski dvori building in Zagreb.\n\nYugoslav MiG-29’s were also used to strike Bosniak targets during the 1992-1995 Bosnian War. No MiG-29 aircraft were lost during this 1991 to 1995 period but an arms embargo, budget constraints and limited spares meant by 1996 serviceability became a problem for the MiG-29’s. Later in Kosovo the MiG-29’s did not fare well in air combat against highly skilled NATO pilots flying better maintained aircraft (see below).\n\nSoko Orao in Combat\n\nThe home-grown Soko Orao 1/2 aircraft were used in combat during the Yugoslav Wars for ground attack and reconnaissance missions over Slovenia (they flew over as a show of force but apparently did not drop any ordnance), Croatia (used to strike Croat targets in 1991 and also to hit arms smugglers bringing weapons into Croatia) and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Five were lost between 1991 and 1995 (3 in 1991). At the outbreak of the Bosnian War in 1992, Yugoslavia gave 8 Soko J-22 Orao attack aircraft to the Republika Srpska Air Force in 1992 who flew them on many sorties over Bosnia and Herzegovina (1 of these was lost in combat).\n\nSoko Super Galeb in Combat\n\nThe home-grown Soko G-4 Super Galeb trainer/light attack aircraft were also used in ground attack missions during at least the early stages of the Yugoslav Wars. Yugoslav Air Force examples were seen over Croatia in 1991, where 3 are said to have been shot down with the pilots all ejecting safely.\n\nOne Yugoslav Super Galeb (YAF serial 23733) in particular highlighted the toughness of this little jet when on September 24th, 1991 it was struck in the tail by a Stinger man portable surface to air missile launched by the Croatian paramilitary whilst flying at 720 km/h at an altitude of 2,100 km. Pilot Sub Lieutenant Branislav Ivanovski managed to make it to Udbine Airport where its entire rear section was replaced so it could be returned to service. That particular damaged tail section resides today in the Belgrade Aeronautical Museum in Serbia.\n\nRepublika Srpska Air Force\n\nThe independent state of Republika Srpska was declared within northern Bosnia and Herzegovina on January 9th, 1992. Much of the JRViPVO equipment in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovenia was given to the new Republika Srpska Air Force which was officially formed on May 27th, 1992 (with local air force personnel and territorial defence personnel) to protect the local Serbian population. They actually made 16 combat sorties that same day mostly over Bosnia. The official title was The Air Force and Air Defense of Republika Srpska (Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo i Protivvazdusna Odbrana Vojske Republike Srpske – RViPVOVRS).\n\nOn the combat aircraft front the Republika Srpska Air Force operated Soko J-21 Jastreb light attack aircraft, Soko IJ-21 Jastreb reconnaissance aircraft and Soko J-22/IJ-22 Orao 1 attack and reconnaissance aircraft allocated from the JRViPVO during the Bosnian War (1992-1995). They also operated 3 Soko NJ-21 Jastreb two-seat trainers and a Soko G-4 Super Galeb for advanced pilot training.\n\nDuring the Bosnian War the Republika Srpska Air Force lost 6 J-21’s. The most notable J-21 losses occurred on February 28th, 1994 in what became known as the Banja Luka incident , when 6 of them with 2 J-22 Orao attack aircraft violated the NATO no-fly zone during Operation Deny Flight to bomb a factory target. The Serbs attempted to evade and escape at extremely low altitude but 4 J-21’s were shot down by NATO USAF F-16C fighters and an additional J-21 was lost in a flight accident rather than combat during this incident (the USAF credited 3 air to air victories to Captain Robert Gordon “Wilbur” Wright and 1 to Captain Stephen L. “Yogi” Allen) . Additional losses during the Bosnian War included 5 Orao aircraft (3 lost on combat and 2 in accidents) and 7 helicopters.\n\nDespite Deny Flight, the Republika Srpska Air Force seems to have managed to conduct many obviously low-level combat sorties during this war period (this may have been facilitated by aircraft flying in from Serbian territory in Croatia where the no fly zone was not in initially in place, but was later authorised by the UN in November 1994 – see Republic of Serbian Krajina below). The Commander of the RViPVOVRS, General-Major Marinko Siljegovic reported that the air force had completed 17,316 sorties in total during the conflict, with 3,179 of them being medical evacuation flights. They even flew aircraft to Serbia to be repaired and replaced!\n\nAt the start of the Bosnian War they had at around 67 aircraft of all types including light aviation, plus helicopters. By 1996 they had around 42 aircraft (plus helicopters) which had been reduced from combat losses, attrition, accidents, budget constraints etc. (for example the last two-seat Orao in service was lost in a training accident in 1997 and 4 J-21’s were disarmed and put out of service as per the post war negotiated Florence Agreement for arms reduction in 1996 – see below). Aircraft numbers had been significantly reduced again by the time they merged with the Armed Forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 2005 to around 26 aircraft (including 7 J-22 Orao’s, 4 J-21 Jastreb’s, 1 IJ-21 Jastreb, 3 NJ-21 Jastreb’s, 1 G-4 Super Galeb, 2 UTVA 75 light aircraft plus other light aircraft) along with 33 helicopters (22 Aerospatiale SA-342 Gazelle/Paritzan and 11 Mil Mi-8 Hip).\n\nRepublic of Serbian Krajina\n\nThe Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) is said to have operated a small number of combat aircraft during their involvement in the fighting within Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1992 and 1995 before the RSK ceased to exist in 1995. The aircraft on hand included 12 former Yugoslav Air Force Soko J-21 Jastreb light attack aircraft and at least 2 Soko G-2 Galeb trainer/light attack aircraft (along with other light aircraft and helicopters) operating from the former Yugoslav Air Force Udbina military airport in Croatia and were used to attack Croat and Bosniak targets. The aircraft were flown by with the 105th Aviation Brigade and the combat squadron was called the “Cobras” (“Kobre”).\n\nThe RSK aircraft appear to have operated as part of the Republika Srpska Air Force though, as they wore the same markings and flying out of Croatia where NATO was not initially authorised to fly (later rectified by UN Security Council Resolution 958 in November 1994), they could come in as low as 200 feet to hit targets in Bosnia and Herzegovina such as the besieged town of Bihać (where bombs and napalm were dropped) and get back to base before being intercepted over Bosnia. Not much in the way of combat information seems to be available on missions by RSK aircraft but during the Croatian Operation Storm offensive in August 1995 they were withdrawn to Banja Luka in Republika Srpska and following RSK defeat the 105th Aviation Brigade was disbanded.\n\nThe Demise of Soko Aviation\n\nThe Soko Aviation company founded in 1950 was located in Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina where it had its main aircraft factory. Soko was the combat aircraft manufacturer of Yugoslavia and a source of great aviation pride. The bloody and destructive Bosnian War, a lack of funding and an international arms embargo unfortunately put paid to future production and development of aircraft by the company in this location. By the early 1990’s the aircraft factory was closed and partly dismantled with some of the facilities and equipment being transferred to the Utva Aircraft Industry company in Serbia (they had previously worked with Soko in building their training jets).\n\nFlorence Agreement on Sub-Regional Arms Control\n\nIn 1996 with the cessation of hostilities the former Yugoslavian republics agreed to the Florence Agreement on Sub-Regional Arms Control. On June 14th, 1996 the associated nations signed an arms limitation agreement to reduce, monitor and control the size of their military assets to help prevent future hostilities. Dozens of Soko G-2 Galeb, J-21 Jastreb and J-22 Orao 1 aircraft operated by Serbia and other aircraft operated by the Republika Srpska Air Force were taken out of service following this agreement.\n\nPeace didn’t last long in the former Yugoslavia though. By 1998 war rumblings commenced again in the province of Kosovo and for the Yugoslav Air Force the Kosovo War of 1998 to 1999 was one that would cost them dearly for years to come. More on this conflict in my next post.\n\nReferences:\n\nAerodrom Zeljava\n\nBelgrade Aeronautical Museum\n\nUN International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia – The Conflicts\n\nForged in War, Dedicated to Peace\n\nNew York Times – Napalm and Cluster Bombs Dropped on Bosnian Town\n\nOn War – Soko J-22 Orao\n\nWikipedia (Yugoslav Air Force)\n\nWikipedia (Operation Deny Flight)\n\nWikipedia (Operation Deliberate Force)\n\nWikipedia (Yugoslav Wars)\n\nFrom April 1992 the Yugoslav Air Force officially became the Air Force of Serbia and Montenegro (Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo Srbije i Crne Gore – RVSiCG) and was now the air force of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The RVSiCG roundel changed from the old red star in a blue circle, to a 3 bar red, blue and white roundel that reflected the colours of the nation’s flag.\n\nThe RVSiCG which for the sake of simplicity I will continue to refer to as the Yugoslav Air Force, operated approximately 300 aircraft with 16,000 personnel from April 27th, 1992 to June 3rd, 2006 when Montenegro voted to secede from the former Yugoslavia. The bulk of the remaining aircraft then formed what is todays Serbian Air Force and Air Defence and reverted to the old Royal Yugoslav Air Force roundel (originally operated from 1918 to 1941).\n\nAs discussed in my previous post, the Yugoslav Wars of 1991 to 1995 had torn apart the former Yugoslavia, with most republics leaving the once proud nation under a cloud of heavy bloodshed. The Yugoslav Air Force was involved in all of these conflicts but had seen little air to air opposition. Soon they were to face the full brunt of NATO air power and the results were going to be felt for decades to come.\n\nKosovo War 1998 to 1999\n\nIn 1989 Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević removed Kosovar autonomy, something they had enjoyed for decades in the former Yugoslavia, and put the region under strict Serbian control. This action slowly but surely built up tension in the Kosovo and when ethnic Kosovar Albanians sought independence, the Kosovo War (February 28th, 1998 to June 11th, 1999) saw a return to conflict within the former Yugoslavia with the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting against Serbian forces. Serbia naturally struck back and it was again a bloody conflict.\n\nFrom March 1998 to March 1999 over 2000 Kosovar people were killed as a result of the Serb government’s policies in Kosovo. During the summer of 1998 250,000 Kosovar Albanians were forced from their homes as villages and crops were destroyed. By April 1999 over 380,000 refugees had fled Kosovo!\n\nSuch a humanitarian crisis resulted in NATO intervention and 78 days of NATO air strikes and cruise missile strikes upon Serbian targets in both Kosovo and Serbia from March 24th, 1999 to June 11th, 1999 under Operation Allied Force (air defences, air bases, ground forces and high value military targets such as the Serbian Army HQ in Belgrade which was more a show of force than a strategic target. It remains a bombed out shell today as a memorial of sorts against “NATO aggression”). Facilities were only hit if assessed to be making an effective contribution to the overall Yugoslav military effort (many targets were not subject to air strikes due to the high risk of civilian casualties – especially when military equipment was stored in a civilian area). A small number of air strikes were also conducted in Montenegro but this region was seen to have lesser strategic value and was not a key focus of NATO strategy.\n\nDespite the precautions taken, not all NATO air strikes were accurate and approximately 500 civilians were sadly killed. Some political strife arose in May 1999 when the Chinese Embassy was hit in Belgrade, killing 3 Chinese journalists (halting the bombing campaign for 3 weeks) and an Albanian refugee convoy was struck by mistake killing 50 people. Both the US and NATO apologized for the applicable mistakes.\n\nThe NATO air campaign involved up to 1,045 aircraft flying over 38,000 combat sorties (including 10,484 strike sorties) out of bases in Italy and off aircraft carriers in the Adriatic Sea. There was no major ground threat to Serbia during the Kosovo War so they did not have to group large military forces into single locations and they dispersed their forces, used decoys and camouflage as best as possible to try to limit the effectiveness of the NATO air advantage (ultimately a relatively small number of tanks, armoured vehicles etc. were destroyed given the number of sorties conducted by NATO). Despite Serbia’s initial resilience, this air campaign lead to a Serbian withdrawal from Kosovo and the moving in of NATO peacekeepers in 1999 but unfortunately did not totally stop the bloodshed beforehand. Although air superiority was quickly established, Serbian ground based air defences were strong with many mobile sites which were difficult to locate and although hit hard by NATO, were always something NATO pilots had to be cautious of (see NATO losses below).\n\nYugoslav Air Force Losses\n\nThe Yugoslav Air Force was active during the Kosovo War but this time they were pitted against highly trained NATO pilots. The key to any success on a ground attack mission over Kosovo was to fly low and avoid NATO radar.\n\nNATO destruction of Yugoslav jets in the air and on the ground was a major show of force during aggression in Kosovo. Airbases were taken out quickly and hit often to keep them inactive, especially poor old Batajnica Air Base near Belgrade which was hit numerous times.\n\nOver 60 Yugoslav combat aircraft were lost mostly on the ground in NATO air raids in 1999 (plus numerous other aircraft types). These were predominately the Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-21 Fishbed fighter (around 24 aircraft destroyed on the ground), Soko J-22 Orao 1/2 ground attack and reconnaissance aircraft (1 was lost on March 25th, 1999 in a likely accident during a combat mission over Kosovo and 11 more were destroyed on the ground mostly at Ponikve Airbase), Soko G-2 Galeb trainer/light attack aircraft (12 said to have been destroyed in a hangar fire by one NATO bomb at Golubovci Airbase), Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-29 Fulcrum fighters (10 lost in air and ground incidents – see below) and Soko G-4 Super Galeb trainer/light attack aircraft (7 from the Leteće zvezde / Flying Stars air force aerobatic team were lost in the hangar bombing at Golubovci Airbase – see below).\n\nThe Yugoslav Air Force Mikoyan Gurevich MiG-29 Fulcrum was the most capable air to air threat to NATO aircraft. The Serbs knew they would be a high priority target, so in a bid to prevent all the MiG-29’s being hit on the ground, they built a wooden air force of MiG-29 decoys, jokingly dubbed the M-18 (the real MiG-29’s were designated L-18). Apparently the decoys were the idea of Serbian aviation enthusiasts rather than the Air Force. They were deployed in locations such as Batajnica Air Base and moved regularly to make them look active (also featuring metal panels to create a realistic radar image and they burned tubs of kerosene under them to look like engine exhaust fumes) and it is said that nearly 80% of the decoys were hit by NATO bombs, so they obviously worked in distracting attention from the real thing! An example of the decoys can be found at the Belgrade Aeronautical Museum today.\n\nDespite the best efforts of the decoy makers they could not save all the MiG’s. Within the first 3 days of the Kosovo air campaign 5 MiG-29’s scrambled to intercept incoming NATO aircraft were shot down by NATO fighters: 3 by USAF F-15 Eagles, 1 by a USAF F-16 Fighting Falcon and 1 by a Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16 (pilot Peter Tankink hit the MiG-29 with an AIM-120 AMRAAM missile for the first RNLAF air to air victory since World War Two). A sixth MiG-29 was said to have been shot down by friendly fire, another was badly damaged in air combat but landed safely and 4 were destroyed on the ground by NATO air strikes (including one MiG-29UB trainer. The other surviving MiG-29UB crashed in a flight accident at a later date).\n\nThis decimation left just 5 MiG-29A’s from the original fleet of 16 MiG-29A/UB’s and saw the end of them flying missions over Kosovo. Ongoing Budget restraints from the long Yugoslav Wars and the resulting political isolation and economic sanctions had led to serviceability issues and low flight hours of MiG-29 pilots, which obviously would not have helped in the ensuing combat. Each MiG-29 is said to have experienced technical issues with radar, weapons and navigational systems during the Kosovo War, which highly limited their effectiveness against a better trained and equipped foe (an arms embargo on Serbia meant they needed to soldier on but they have since been upgraded in Russia and most still fly in Serbia today)!\n\nSoko J-22 Orao attack aircraft and Soko G-4 Super Galeb trainer/light attack aircraft flew 20 – 30 combat missions at low-level (tree top height apparently!) over Kosovo attacking KLA targets. 1 Orao was lost on such a mission on March 25th, 1999 in what is reported to likely have been a flight accident rather than being shot down by ground fire.\n\nNATO Losses\n\nIt wasn’t all one-sided during the Kosovo War and some NATO aircraft were shot down by Serbian air defences (not in air to air combat though). Most famously a USAF Northrop F-117A Nighthawk “Stealth Fighter” in March 1999 and a USAF General Dynamics F-16C Fighting Falcon in May 1999 were shot down during air raids over Serbia.\n\nA small number of other NATO aircraft were damaged by the extensive Serbian ground based air defences but this was relatively minimal given the number of sorties flown (this is said to have included another F-117A Nighthawk and 2 Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II close support aircraft). 815 Serbian Surface to Air Missiles were fired at NATO aircraft with many being radar guided SA-3 and SA-6 missiles that had to be launched unguided to avoid NATO HARM missile strikes upon the launch site/vehicle guidance radar (hence their effectiveness was severely hampered but mobile SAM’s were still very hard to target and hit)!\n\nOn March 27th, 1999, just 4 nights into the NATO air campaign, the F-117A (serial number 82-0806) was hit by a Surface to Air missile fired by the 3rd Battalion of the 250th Missile Brigade, equipped with the S-125 Neva-M (SA-3 Goa) missile system. Despite an intense search by Serbian forces USAF pilot flown by Lt. Col. Dale Zelko evaded capture and was rescued by a USAF combat rescue team helicopter the following morning.\n\nHow did the Serbs do the unthinkable and hit a stealthy, low-observable, radar absorbent aircraft with a radar guided missile? Apparently they tweaked their Soviet era radars using long wavelengths to detect things like a bomb bay door opening (there was no stealth profile during this stage). This technology, with a bit of luck, brought the Nighthawk down. No doubt parts of the F-117A wreckage that were not kept as a war trophy soon ended up in the hands of Serbian ally Russia for study into the stealth technology!\n\nOn May 1st, 1999 the General Dynamics F-16C Fighting Falcon (serial number 88-0550) was flown by pilot Lt. Col David Goldfein, the commander of the USAF 555th Fighter Squadron. It was hit by a SAM and lost its engine. Ejecting down onto a field at 2:20am he headed away from the area, found a suitable clearing and called in a NATO air combat rescue helicopter. The rescue was completed 2 hours after he ejected from the F-16. The helicopter sustained 5 bullet holes in his rescue!\n\nAt least 21 NATO Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV’s) were also shot down during the Kosovo conflict (I gather mostly from AA gun fire). Remnants of the shot down USAF F-117A and F-16C aircraft along with a Predator UAV and NATO weaponry are today displayed at the Belgrade Aeronautical Museum and further components of the F-117 can be found at the Belgrade Military Museum.\n\nLeteće zvezde (Flying Stars)\n\nThe Leteće zvezde (Flying Stars) official Yugoslav Air Force aerobatic team was established in 1985 and operated until 2000. In 1985 they were formed flying 7 specially painted red, white, blue and yellow Soko J-21 Jastreb ground attack aircraft. The J-21’s were disarmed and modified specifically to perform aerobatics.\n\nThe J-21’s were replaced in 1990 by the newer Soko G-4 Super Galeb two-seat trainer. The Super Galeb aircraft were painted in a new red, white and blue livery. The team was grounded in 1991 due to the start of the Yugoslav Wars and the aircraft returned to being used as advanced air force trainers for the duration of the major conflicts across the former Yugoslavia.\n\nReformed in 1996, Leteće zvezde made numerous domestic appearances and even some international ones but in 1999 during the NATO bombing campaign of Serbia all 7 Super Galeb aircraft were destroyed on the ground at Golubovci Airbase in Montenegro when a NATO laser guided bomb hit the entrance to the underground hangar starting a fire within the hangar. Some further Leteće zvezde team appearances were conducted in regularly camouflage painted G-4 Super Galeb aircraft, before budget constraints and limited aircraft availability forced the team to disband in 2000. Following disbandment some of the Flying Stars pilots served as test pilots at the Flight Test Center – VOC and performed solo aerobatic displays in a Super Galeb at domestic and international air shows.\n\nThe Serbian Air Force Today\n\nThe Yugoslav Wars effectively ended the Yugoslav Air Force and saw the start of the Serbian Air Force and Air Defence (as of 2006) which was by 1999 and still today, a much weaker air arm in regards to the number of aircraft and a modern air defence capability. Combat losses, the Florence Agreement on Sub-Regional Arms Control, budget constraints and serviceability issues have resulted in a much smaller air force compared to the glory days of the former Yugoslavia and one that is rapidly becoming obsolete. As of 2015 in regards to combat aircraft they operate only 4 MiG-29A Fulcrum and 10 MiG-21bis Fishbed fighters/MiG-21UM Mongol B two-seat trainers, with 30 Soko J-22 Orao 2 attack aircraft and 23 Soko G-4 Super Galeb trainers. These aircraft fly out of 3 main airbases at Batajnica, Lađevci, and Niš.\n\nApparently both western and Russian aircraft have been considered to modernize the Serbian Air Force but orders have never been placed and for now they are just looking to upgrade the remaining Soko G-4 Super Galeb fleet (a potential order of 6 advanced MiG-29M/M2 Fulcrum E fighters/two-seat trainers from Russia was discussed by Serbia in 2013 but this was abandoned in 2014). It will be interesting to see what Serbia does to modernize their future air force (most likely they will turn to their old ally Russia) but for now they must soldier on with their Cold War era aircraft.\n\nReferences:\n\nAerobatic Teams\n\nAir Force Magazine – The Balkan Air War\n\nAir Power Australia – Revisiting the Lessons of Operation Allied Force\n\nUN International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia – The Conflicts\n\nNATO Kosovo Crisis\n\nNATO’s Role in Kosovo\n\nOn War – Soko J-22 Orao\n\nWikipedia (Kosovo War)\n\nWikipedia (Yugoslav Air Force)\n\nWooden MiGs\n\nOut the back of the Belgrade Aeronautical Museum at the Nikola Tesla International Airport sits the Serbian Air Force and Air Defence aircraft “Boneyard”. Here you can see many old airframes of both Soviet and Yugoslav origin set out in a large secured area. Although you can view the aircraft, I soon discovered during my visit to the air museum in late November 2015 that you are not actually allowed in this area, as it is official Air Force property and museum personnel make sure you keep to the designated areas!\n\nOut in that field you can see a multitude of aircraft operated by the former Yugoslav Air Force and the Serbian Air Force including:\n\nHome Grown Aviation\n\nSoko G-2A (N-60) Galeb (Seagull) two-seat trainer and light attack aircraft introduced in July 1965. The G-2A was the first jet aircraft designed and built in Yugoslavia (fitted with a licence built Rolls Royce/Bristol Siddeley Viper turbojet engine). 132 examples were operated by the Yugoslav Air Force primarily for cadet combat training at the VVA (Military Air Force Academy) units but the type also saw combat during the Bosnian War (1992-1995), with the 105th Aviation Brigade of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) defence force. Most were retired by 1999 the last was still in service with Serbia until 2002.\n\nSoko P-2 (J-20) Kraguj (Sparrow Hawk) single seat close support, counter insurgency (COIN) propeller driven aircraft. Introduced in March 1967 as a “partisan aircraft” capable of short landings and take-off’s from rough fields, roads etc. particularly in the many mountains of Yugoslavia with no special preparation (this was especially handy in the advent that an aggressor took out the runways of the main airbases). 85 P-2 (J-20) were manufactured but all were retired by the Yugoslav Air Force in 1989 and handed over to the republic’s Territorial Defense Headquarters.\n\nSoko J-1 (J-21) Jastreb (Hawk) single seat ground attack aircraft introduced in 1969. A development of the two-seat G-2A Galeb trainer, the Yugoslav Air Force operated 103 J-21’s, with Serbia retiring the type in 1996. This type makes up the majority of the old airframes sitting out in the open.\n\nMany of the aircraft are apparently former Yugoslav Air Force (JRViPVO) aircraft that were given to the Republika Srpska Air Force for combat missions during the Bosnian War (1992-1995). The independent state of Republika Srpska (ethnic Serbians) was declared within northern Bosnia and Herzegovina on January 9th, 1992 and their capital became Banja Luka. Much of the JRViPVO equipment in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovenia was given to the Republika Srpska Air Force which was officially formed on May 27th, 1992 (with local air force personnel and territorial defence personnel) to protect the local Serbian population.\n\nDespite a NATO no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina the Republika Srpska Air Force aircraft would fly to Belgrade when due for servicing and basically be swapped one for one by Yugoslav aircraft rather than returning the same aircraft. These were predominately the Soko J-21 Jastreb single seat ground attack aircraft you see in my photos. A handful were still in service when the Republika Srpska Air Force merged into the Armed Forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina in"
