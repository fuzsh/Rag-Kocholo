        "text": "The Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure Zorana Mihajlovic signed an agreement on the non-monetary capital contribution of the Republic of Serbia to the Aerodromi Srbije Company to the end of increasing the basic capital of the company on Friday, February 22nd.\n\nThanks to the contribution, Serbia will get its third civilian airport, in addition to those in Belgrade and Nis, located near the southern town of Kraljevo.\n\nAccording to the agreement, the state will transfer property worth 1.18 billion dinars to Aerodromi Srbije, including a terminal building and a platform, which creates the conditions for the opening of a mixed (civilian-military) airport.\n\nThe Government of Serbia will also invest an additional amount of around 8.5 million euro in the airport, for the purpose of putting the runway into the function, equipping the airport, training and employment of around 50 people and other expenses necessary for the airport to operate properly.\n\nWith the realization of these investments, the plan is for the Morava Airport to be ready for the handling of passenger and goods transport from June 28th, 2019, by which time the process of certification for international air transport should be completed.\n\nThe airport in Ladjevci, near Kraljevo, will initially be able to handle ATR-72 and B-737 planes. Once the runway and the taxiways are expanded, the airport should be able to handle all types of aircraft, including B-747.\n\nMihajlovic signed the agreement with the director of Aerodromi Srbije, Zoran Pavlovic, who also signed an agreement on the joint use of manoeuvring areas in the common zone at the airport, that is, of the runway and the taxiways, with Serbian Defense Minister Aleksandar Vulin in Kraljevo.\n\nThe airport in Ladjevci was originally a military airport that was built in 1967. The official initiative to change its status from a military into the military-civilian airport was launched in 2001. The conversion began in 2008, with the new control tower, a modern airport building for civilian air traffic and other accompanying facilities built so far. What still needs to be done is to expand the runway from 2,200 to 2,500 metres in length and acquire additional equipment."
