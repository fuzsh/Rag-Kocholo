The document summarizes a report on Military Operation Storm and its aftermath in former UN Sectors South and North in Croatia. It describes how the military operation reunified the territories with Croatia but was followed by [1] the departure of hundreds of thousands of Serb civilians, [2] the killing of at least 410 civilians by Croatian forces, and [3] widespread looting and destruction of Serb property including the burning of 22,000 homes. The report documents continued human rights violations against the Serb minority for months after the operation including violence, terrorism and harassment by perpetrators who often went unpunished.",
