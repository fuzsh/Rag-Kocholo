Support to implementation of the National Strategy for Tourism, Ref. no. 07SER01/23/11 Analysis of investment policies and activities and investment possibilities in tourism of the Republic of Serbia 6 2 Executive summary In this document an analysis is being made about investments in tourism development, whether are public or private sources of funding, with a focus on the period since the adoption of the National Strategy for Tourism Development in 2006. In Chapter 3 an analysis of public spending is showen based on the data received from MERR, Development Fund of Serbia, Statistical Buro of Serbia and other secondary market research sources. This analysis includes the description and comments on the system of governing tourism in Serbia, structure of tourism budget and specific points like public spending in tourism related infrastructure, capital projects, tourism development planning and capital provided to SMEs development and a current system of promoting tourism investment. The quality of data didn’t completely satisfied the needs for the analysis but it has given a picture of the public system and provided, with the experience acquired during my work with NCTDS and other public institutions and organizations, basis for recommendations. In Chapter 4 I tried to give as much as I could informations about investment activity based on the secondary market research (a primary market research would fill the gaps like “Ammount invested” since it is rarely publicly available and couldn’t be compensated with the data on Construstion works value – hotels and motels from the Statistical Buro of Serbia). Information about realized investments structured by cluster, destination and tourism product could be found, but also short analysis of the process of privatization, and most importantly, who has invested and what investment projects are in progress. This also answers the question of the profile of the investors in Serbian tourism and identifies people and companies which can be future partners in tourism development. I also gave comments about the status of key investment projects by clusters identified in the National Tourism Strategy. Finally, in Chapter 5 a list of “to do” points is created; first part is completely copied from the National Tourism Strategy, since I find it very relevant, and second part is based on my experience and work in the tourism sector of Serbia.\n\n7. Support to implementation of the National Strategy for Tourism, Ref. no. 07SER01/23/11 Analysis of investment policies and activities and investment possibilities in tourism of the Republic of Serbia 7 3 Government policies and activities Due to objective reasons (wars, sanctions) Serbia was absent from global tourist market for at least a decade. After the democratic changes in October 2000 Serbia made first steps in the fields that seemed as a natural priority: political, economic and legal stabilization, reform of institutions and building of modern, democratic society. Turning point for tourism as an industry in Serbia was the work on the tourism development strategy in 2005 and 2006. National Tourism Development Strategy of Serbia was adopted in 2006 by the Government of Serbia which sent a message of a strategic and planned approach of Serbia in tourism development. The current Government of Serbia was formed in July 2008 (after the parliamentary elections in May 2008), preceded by Koštunica’s Cabinet which was formed in May 2007 (after the parliamentary elections in January 2007). The Ministry of Economy and Regional Development (MERR), sector Tourism, continued the work of 2004-2007 Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Services. 3.1 Governing tourism The tourism strategy proposed a centralized approach in tourism development and the Government of the Republic of Serbia founded the following companies in order to do so: Public company JP “Skijališta Srbije” (Ski Resorts of Serbia) was founded in 2006 - managing public ski resorts and other areas for skiing and winter activities, construction, reconstruction and maintenance of ski resorts and all the equipment in ski resorts (ski slopes, chair lifts, protection gears and special mechanization) and logistic services during sports events. Public company JP “Stara planina” was founded in 2006 – in charge of implementing of the Stara planina tourism development project. Public company “Park Palić” d.o.o. was founded in 2008 – equally founded by the Republic of Serbia, the province of Vojvodina and the City of Subotica; key functions of the company is to manage public investments in Palić, manage relations with potential investors (act as a “one stop shop”), implement master plan Palić and marketing and development of the destination. Limited company “National Corporation for Tourism Development” of Serbia was founded in 2009 - governmental body dedicated to implementing the Tourism Strategy of the Republic of Serbia. Serbia Investment and Export Promotion Agency (SIEPA) was founded in 2001 - government agency dedicated to effectively helping foreign investors and buyers, while raising Serbia's profile in the minds of international business decision-makers. In the light of\n\n8. Support to implementation of the National Strategy for Tourism, Ref. no. 07SER01/23/11 Analysis of investment policies and activities and investment possibilities in tourism of the Republic of Serbia 8 tourism investment, SIEPA is important for administering the most significant financial incentive program for promoting foreign direct investments in Serbia. Agency for privatization of the Republic of Serbia was founded in 2001 – government agency dedicated to organize, facilitate and control of the process of privatization in Serbia. In the light of tourism investment, Agency is a mechanism through which is possible to influence the structure of the private actors by privatization. National Tourist Organization of Serbia (NTOS) was founded in 1994 – government organization for promotion and development of tourism of the Republic of Serbia. In the light of tourism investment, NTOS is important for promoting Serbian tourism values and products. Other public organizations that have/can have a key role in the implementation of the National Tourism Strategy are: Regional and local tourist organizations – financed mainly by the Municipalities and/or tourism tax and applying for their projects to NTOS, MERR and international funds. Local economic development (LED) offices - were established in the Municipalities to improve and enhance the capacities of its municipal governments and local stakeholders. Regional and local development agencies and public companies – are and can be important partners in tourism destinations development and marketing and management. In the system of issuing and implementing government policies there is a substantial lack of resources, among others: 1. Information system: most of the information regarding tourism performance are produced ad hoc by the MERR staff or provided by the local tourist organization with no consistence and “big picture”. Other important sources like the Statistical Buro of Serbia didn’t change the methodology for a long time. There was an attempt made by the director of NCTDS in creating a permanent system of measuring tourism products performance but was never implemented. This is a huge obstacle in defining and measuring government policies. 2. Human resources: maybe the plans and policies are good but the question remains who will implement it. There is a clear need to have teams of professionals in the Ministry and related public organizations that will independently of the political cycles lead the development and coordinate strategies and policies implementation. 3. Trust: inherited system and “way of doing things” has a negative impact on any new government policy or activity whether is more or less good. Like the previous, this remains part of the bigger project – reformation of government institutions and governing processes in order to have results and trust. This is especially important if we want to develop PPP and if the State is seen as unwanted partner. The tourist policy of Serbia does not have, at present, all the necessary levers of influence on\n\n9. Support to implementation of the National Strategy for Tourism, Ref. no. 07SER01/23/11 Analysis of investment policies and activities and investment possibilities in tourism of the Republic of Serbia 9 the development and growth of competitiveness in tourism. There is a clear need, identified also by the local organizations, to have a binding point on a national level. That is, in my opinion, the position that the NCTDS should build and take. 3.2 Tourism development planning The first milestone in the tourism development planning process is certainly the adoption of the National Tourism Strategy in 2006 as the foundation on which later the tourism strategies and master plans will derive. These plans represent a vision of tourism development of particular regions and are integral part of the National Tourism Strategy. Since 2006, 15 master plans for different regions and tourism destinations were adopted: 1. Golija mountain 2. Stig, Kučajske mountain, Beljanica 3. Palić Lake Spa&Wellness 4. Upper Danube region 5. Lower Danube region 6. The Roman Emperors Route (cultural) 7. Soko Banja Spa 8. Stara planina mountain 9. Tara mountain 10. Vlasina lake&mountain 11. Zlatibor & Zlatar mountains 12. Besna kobila mountain 13. Sremski Karlovci 14. Kopaonik mountain 15. Novo Miloševo In development are two more master plans: Bač, Bački Petrovac and Bačka Palanka and National Rural Tourism Master plan. Besides the mentioned master plans, many cities and municipalities in Serbia commissioned their own strategies or master plans of tourism and business development. My observation on the field is that in many destinations evaluated in master plans lacks correlation between spatial plans and master plans, realized investment and master plans or plans of detailed regulation don’t exist at all. On the other side, in destinations where there is a organization dedicated to implementing master plans, such as Park Palić d.o.o. – Palić Lake or JP Stara planina – Stara planina, correlation is significantly higher. One thing is for sure, there is a huge advancement in the field of planning and making the prerequisite for tourism development in any sense. But planning is not enough. Even when you have the best plan in the world it’s just a plan if no one is making sure that is realized. It is a common problem in any country with no system of implementation; there is a good strategy but no implementation. NCTDS was seen by the National Tourism Strategy as an\n\n10. Support to implementation of the National Strategy for Tourism, Ref. no. 07SER01/23/11 Analysis of investment policies and activities and investment possibilities in tourism of the Republic of Serbia 10 implementation body and there is a clear need to create a system of interlinked institutions with NCTDS as a focal point. I.e. if we talk about tourism investment project development, NCTDS will have to have cooperation in all necessary steps with other “resources” and especially local and regional teams. At this point, it would be good to ask ourselves one question: do we need more master plans and if we do - where and when do we need them? Or do we need more ideas at this moment or do we need people that will ensure that business feasibility studies are done, planning regulations and infrastructural needs are satisfied, “products” are prepared and launched at the investment/financial market etc. And finally to conclude, first thing with planning is to have the support of the planner. 3.3 Public investments in tourism The public spending in the tourism sector of Serbia is managed by the Ministry of Economy and Regional Development (since 2007). If we look at the budgets of the Republic of Serbia from 2007-2011, the following amount of RSD was allocated to the tourism sector: Table 1: Tourism sector spending in the budget of the Republic of Serbia Budget 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Spending RS 595.517.786.100 654.429.163.862 719.854.143.000 825.884.941.052 898.891.736.000 MERR/Tourism 3.978.955.382 4.978.900.874 2.237.602.000 4.549.736.000 5.307.083.000 % 0,67% 0,76% 0,31% 0,55% 0,59% Source: Ministry of Economy and Regional Development And the structure is given in the following table: Table 2: The structure of the MERR/Tourism sector budget in 2010 473 Tourism Id Number Description Ammount 411 Wages 117.507.000 412 Social contributions 22.127.000 413 Compensations 200.000 414 Social contributions employees 16.001.000 415 Employee costs 3.000.000 416 Rewards employees 1.000 421 Permanent costs 1.500.000 422 Travel costs 7.000.000\n\n11.

One thing is for sure, most significant public investment was in the mountain product (40,7 mil € out of 64,7 mil €) and even more if we take into account the subventions and investments realized through the public companies JP “Skijališta Srbije” and JP “Stara planina”. Data marked as “Other” in Mountain product area of the table couldn’t be classified since i.e. the project “Ski infrastructure Kopaonik, Beljanica, Divčibare and Besna Kobila” refers to many mountain destinations. Most significant investment in the mountain product was the project of development of Stara planina mountain resort, followed by Kopaonik, Zlatibor, Golija, Zlatar, Divčibare and other mountain destinations. Other big investment was in, as I classified it, in touring tourism product, before all Lower Danube region and part of the Roman Emperors Route. The biggest infrastructural project was in Archeological site Lepenski Vir at the Danube coast which includes dock, apartments, restaurant, visitors’ center, research center, infrastructure, swimming pool etc. Total investment is around 8 mil € which is higher than represented in the table from MERR/Infrastructure and NIP so there had to be other sources of financing. Other investment projects were in archeological sites such as Viminicium, near Kostolac, Felix Romuliana, near Zaječar, Sirmium, near Sremska Mitrovica; places at the Danube coast: Sremski Karlovci, Silver Lake, Golubac and Golubac fortress etc.; infrastructure for religious tourism next to the monasteries, next to other cultural sites, cycling tracks along the Danube etc. It’s interesting to note that the product with great potential Health tourism/Wellness/Spa didn’t receive much funding which can be explained with the status quo situation regarding the special hospitals and the unresolved situation between Pension and invalid fund (PIO) – State and the State itself. Most of the investment went to Palić Lake which pretends to be a modern Panonia Wellness/Spa but still Lake/Congress/Sport destination so I classified it as Lake Tourism product. Other big investment in tourism development of spas in Serbia is in Sokobanja: master plan, plans of detailed regulations, infrastructure. I would like to note that some investment couldn't be classified in tourism products such as: Master plan Lower\n\n15.

The lack of funding in national and local budget could be compensated if private public partnership (PPP) is introduced in commercial infrastructure (airports, marinas etc.) and resort development (i.e. Stara planina, Novo miloševo spa). In example, there are 39 registered airports in Serbia, 5 of which are international: - Airport „Nikola Tesla“, Belgrade - Airport „Batajnica“, Belgrade - Airport „Konstantin Veliki“, Niš - Airport Vršac, pilot academy - Military Airport Ponikve, Užice The military airport Ladjevci, near Kraljevo, between Zlatibor and Kopaonik, 2h of driving from terminal to the hotels, is expected to be adapted, with the support of Turkish and American investors, for civil air transport. There are big expectations from Zlatibor in recovering former military airport Ponikve, just 25km away. A study has been done by Chamber of Commerce Užice, public company “Aerodrom Ponikve” is founded by the Užice municipality and their first task is to organize donor’s conference. The locals think that the airport can be sustainable through tourism traffic and transport of goods, mainly raspberries and blackberries. But the question remains the same with every airport is it sustainable project, is there enough tourists, passangers, trade etc. In example, airport in Niš, which was reconstructed with the help of the Norwegian Government in 2003, is not profitable. That is why, I think, in tourism development there has to be an interminister working group, because cooperation is needed, like in this case (airports and roads) with the Ministry of infrastructure. Grants Grants under budget points 451, 463 and 481 are transfers to local tourist organizations, municipalities and NGOs. I didn’t go deeper into analysis of these transfers since the share of grants in the total tourism budget is not significant and there are at least 200 contracts annually. Majority of these grants are aimed at Events tourism product which has a big tradition in Serbia. Some of them are already recognized international events such as trumpet fest in Guča and Exit music festival in Novi Sad. I am sure that among hundreds of different manifestations and festivals few more will find their place in the world tourism map. MERR loans for rising hospitality service quality and the Development Fund of Serbia I received the data from the Development Fund of Serbia about tourism related approved loans from 2006 to June the 7th 2011 which is represented in the following table:\n\n16.

I was told when I visited Perkov Salaš in Fruška Gora that local villagers were laughing at Perko (the owner) who dressed in authentic local outfit. But, as they saw the success of his idea most of them joined him. Also, by talking with many local authorities’ representatives and tourism workers I concluded that they all have a strong feeling towards exploiting the potentials of rural tourism. This feeling is now widely accepted by the institutions and international organizations but also from entrepreneurs or simply people in rural parts of the country that don’t have where to work (closed factories, abandoned villages etc.) but know to be good hosts. If we break total loans by clusters and tourism product we get the following picture:\n\n20.

Apart from mentioned budget sources there is a certain degree of international funding available for tourism related projects. In example, out of 18.5 million € from the EU IPA 2011 funds that Serbia allocated for the Danube Strategy nearly 11 million will be directed to the Lower Danube development, 6.5 mil € for the reconstruction of the Golubac fortress and 4.4 mil € for the water supply system in Veliko Gradište (Silver Lake). Besides that, different funds and organizations are active in Serbia as: EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development), EU CIP (Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme), GTZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit), USAID (United States Agency for International Development), MDG-F (Millenium Development Goals Achievement Fund) financed by the Spanish Government and implemented in Serbia through UN Agencies and many more. It is important to raise the institutional capacities of Serbia to identify the needs, prepare the projects and implement them successfully; especially since the EU candidacy status is expected at the end of 2011. It is also very important to prioritize and plan public investment in tourism since the funds are quite limited. A starting point should be to identify the markets that are achievable, both tourism and investment markets, and then plan and prioritize tourism destinations/product development and infrastructural investment and focus promotional efforts. Other leverages, such as subventions to SMEs, labor market and other should follow the investment. The government can support other destinations/products, according to its strategic plans and political interests, so that they can also become attractive to tourist and investors. A way to plan and prioritize public investment in infrastructure could be achieved through SLAP 2.0 Information System developed by the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities and MISP (Municipal Infrastructure Support Program) EU funded project. The core element of the SLAP 2.0 information system is the transparent scoring system following\n\n22. Support to implementation of the National Strategy for Tourism, Ref. no. 07SER01/23/11 Analysis of investment policies and activities and investment possibilities in tourism of the Republic of Serbia 22 the latest EU/International standards and guidelines and every municipality can enter data online in order to present their project to potential financing partners. The PPD provides an insight into project main features and beneficiaries, its integration into national or local development strategy, as well as project development level, its maturity and available technical and financial feasibility studies. Except from the big cities like Belgrade, Novi Sad and few other local governments cannot financially satisfy the requirements of new tourism developments. A need exists for creation a binding point between municipalities or jointed municipalities on certain tourism destinations and the central body/government. The problems that appear in reality is that there are no capacities by the local authorities to negotiate with big investors, implement big infrastructural projects, corruption, or the case of selling land just to fill the local budget and not following the vision of tourism destination development according to the master plans. Together with the lack of planned regulation (i.e. Zlatibor) and rather slow process of issuing the permits could be a major obstacle in investment development. Especially if we take into account that no investor will wait for years to have his project start developing unless if he takes some sort of speculative risk. One part of the job of the NCTDS would be to act together with its local partners as a task force in order to identify and resolve obstacles in tourism investment project development. This is a good solution in the short run but in the long run the interests of the investors should be represented by “business service providers” or national and local hotelier association. Ideal solution would be to have an environment or system that already does half of the job in investment generation and development. 3.4 Investment promotion Promotion of investment in tourism in Serbia is a question with many answers. These answers could be taken out from questions that any businessman/investors would ask: - What is political and legal situation in your country? Investor is willing to take the business risk but not willing to take the risks of new wars, political instability, and mismanagement of contract obligations by the state etc. - Where is Serbia? On the tourism world map, which tourism products are competitive, where are the potential… - Which are the markets for this project, who are the guests? There is a lack of market oriented projects, rather based on “what we have”. We need to have feasibility studies, business plan, at least to evaluate the offer from investors. - What is the quality of infrastructure, how will the guest arrive? If the guests are domestic how long they are willing to travel, if foreign how long does it take to get from the airport to hotel (if longer than 2 hours then forget it). It is especially important to provide necessary infrastructure for destination and tourism projects development or at least to have a plan of infrastructural development. Good examples of “ready to invest” destinations are Stara planina and Palić.\n\n23. Support to implementation of the National Strategy for Tourism, Ref. no. 07SER01/23/11 Analysis of investment policies and activities and investment possibilities in tourism of the Republic of Serbia 23 - What are legal procedures? As said before, no one wants to wait for several years to overcome all legal obstacles. - What are incentives available? Since 2007, SIEPA has been administering the most significant financial incentive program for promoting direct investment in Serbia. Financial Incentives  For large-scale projects, grants up to 25% of the investment amount  For standard-scale projects, grants from €2,000 up to €10,000 per new job created  Support schemes offered by the National Employment Service Tax Incentives  10-year Corporate Income Tax holiday for large investments  5-Year Corporate Income Tax holiday for investments in underdeveloped regions  Corporate Income Tax credits up to 80% of the investments in fixed assets  5-year Corporate Income Tax holiday for concessions  Carrying forward of losses over a period up to 5 years  Avoiding double taxation  Salary Tax and social insurance charges exemptions  Annual Income Tax deductions up to 50% of the taxable income  Value Added Tax exemption in Free Zones Other Incentives  Customs-free import  Regional and local Incentives - Who is my reference person? NCTDS should with its local teams act as a “one stop shop”. Match the investor enquiry, advice and manage the development of the investment project. - What about the workforce? A plan of workforce development should follow the plan of investment and investment promotion. For medium and highly qualified tourism workers a network of Diaspora professionals should be established. - What are the costs of doing business in Serbia? Real estate prices (and trend since investment in tourism is not just investing in business but also in “bull” real estate market), construction costs, taxes, efficiency in delivering the project etc. These are the inputs for the costs of the projects which together with achiavable market prices (income) and rise in real estate prices makes Profit&Loss Account and give the investor the picture of how high the ROI (Return on investment) can be expected. These answers are paradigms of the investment system in Serbia. The sole promotion is an upgrade to this system. Let’s leave the system aside for a while and focus on sole promotional mechanism. So far the job of promotion of investment in tourism in Serbia was mainly done by MERR officials, regional development agencies (i.e. RARIS – Regional Development Agency Eastern\n\n24. Support to implementation of the National Strategy for Tourism, Ref. no. 07SER01/23/11 Analysis of investment policies and activities and investment possibilities in tourism of the Republic of Serbia 24 Serbia, VIP – Vojvodina Investment Promotion) and municipalities with their LED (Local Economic Development) offices. SIEPA, national investment and export promotion agency, didn’t have tourism set as a priority in investment promotion but did support NCTDS and other organizations in exhibiting on real estate fairs like ExpoReal, Munich or EIRE, Milano. Agency for privatization acted more as a mechanism rather than promoter. In my opinion the revision of the National Tourism Strategy should give the answer what tourism/investment markets are achievable and what are the market needs in order to identify what to offer and prioritize efforts on investment promotion. Right now, as a promotional tool for investment in tourism, serve investment teasers, short description of the projects. They derive from master plans, that do have marketing analysis and some of the master plans have short financial analysis of the investment projects. Stand alone teasers are not financial products ready to be taken to the investment market. In order to make the products we need to have projects with these checkpoints: o urban planning (regulation plans adopted and ready) o ownership (clear ownership structure) o feasibility study o business plan The next step is to answer how to reach the investment markets and in which way. First thing would be to identify the investors and decision making process. More about the investors that have invested in tourism in Serbia I wrote later in “Investment activities” section. Reaching the investors could be done through many ways - promotion distribution channels. First of all, big foreign investment in new tourism resort development will not come alone. They come in a package with tour operator, land developer, airlines companies, insurance companies, pension funds, hotel operators, construction companies etc. Also, no one likes to be a pioneer. The good thing with Serbia is that some major domestic private investor emerged and could be partners in resort development like MK Mountain Resort in Kopaonik. They share the same interest of developing the destination/resort. They also represent in many cases “the success” which can be marketed to potential investors. In the near future, tourism investment promotion and generation of investment project should be managed by: - NCTDS – central point, team of young professionals - regional teams (VIP, RARIS etc.) - local teams in tourism destinations – institutionally connected with NCTDS - MERR – as a guarantee for political support and infrastructural development - SIEPA – through incentives and their contact network - LED units in the municipalities - Private companies\n\n25. Support to implementation of the National Strategy for Tourism, Ref. no. 07SER01/23/11 Analysis of investment policies and activities and investment possibilities in tourism of the Republic of Serbia 25 The process of investment promotion should be based on national consensus in tourism development, professional teams and success. One example, maybe not the best one, of marketing the success is Montenegro which attracted very high amount of FDI in a short period of time. What matters in this case is the mechanism not the essence. The rise in investment opportunities surprised even the locals that never thought that some of their lands could be profitable project. The story of new investment destination Montenegro, experiences of other investors and the rise of real estate prices drew investors from all over the world. Because of the essence (money laundry, speculative capital, corruption etc.) the story collapsed after few years. Second example would be the rise of Tuscany as a world tourism brand after the book and the movie “Under the Tuscan sun”, Super Tuscan wines and other things that represent Tuscan and Italian values and culture. It seems that, in my opinion, culturally and historically rich country as Serbia doesn’t know how to brand, market and sell its heritage. But if you have internationally recognized brands than you have tourists and of course tourism investments. One thing is for sure that Serbia needs more active approach in tourism investment promotion. This could be done through various distribution channels: - direct contact with the identified investors in Serbia and the region - in partnership with investors in Serbia influence their business partners and contacts - exhibition at real estate and investment fairs: o ExpoReal Munich in October o EIRE Milano in June o MIPIM Cannes in March o Real Vienna in May o other international real estate exhibitions like in London, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Madrid, UAE o regional real estate and investment fairs o local real estate and investment fairs  BeIRE Belgrade in November  Rebec Belgrade in June  InvestExpo Novi Sad in November - organization of investment forum in Serbia - through various associations and interest groups - foreign embassies and international organizations in the country - through “business service providers” contact network - through our embassies and economic advisors in the world - through Diaspora organizations including the network of tourism professionals Another thing very important to tourism investment promotion is to plan and prioritize tourism development and to set it in a time frame. Some of the prerequisites of investment promotion activities are: - establish local development teams - create or order a database of hotel performances (“hotel factsheet”)\n\n26. Support to implementation of the National Strategy for Tourism, Ref. no. 07SER01/23/11 Analysis of investment policies and activities and investment possibilities in tourism of the Republic of Serbia 26 - conduct a primary market research and compare the findings with ones done in 2005 and 2006 (for the National Tourism Strategy preparation) - create or order database of region’s investors, developers and other stakeholders in resort, hotel development - create or order a database of local “business service providers”\n\n27. Support to implementation of the National Strategy for Tourism, Ref. no. 07SER01/23/11 Analysis of investment policies and activities and investment possibilities in tourism of the Republic of Serbia 27 4 Investment activities The investment strategy as part of the National Tourism Strategy is based on three pillars: 1. Restructuring, rehabilitation and improvement of the quality of existing tourism facilities 2. Development of new tourist offer on the principles of sustainable development 3. Large investment projects of so called Urban conversion Estimated amount of investment in the accommodation offer of Serbia until 2015 is about 4 billion €. This estimation in the National Tourism Strategy is based on the assumption that the development scenarios of Serbia will be Serbia Approptiate to Serbs and EuroSerbia in Network. According to the criteria given for each development scenario, development of since 2005 is a combination of Isolated Serbia and Experimental Field (with some elements Serbia Appropriate to Serbs and EuroSerbia in Network) which had a negative impact on implementation of Tourism Strategy and investment in tourism and tourism development of Serbia overall. I would like to give some comments to the essential characteristics of the tourist sector in Serbia in 2015 described in the National Tourism Strategy:  redefined and internationally generally accepted image of Serbia as an attractive and safe tourist destination;  significant progress has been made, in 2007 a Council for promoting Serbia was founded in order to build and position Serbia as national brand but nothing significant has been done, this a issue that must be addressed  stable and growing international demand for Serbia as tourist destination;  after the rise in international demand after 2006, the demand is actually stagnating last couple of years  stable and growing domestic demand for various tourist products in Serbia;  after a steady growth the demand has fallen after the financial crisis in 2009 and 2010  four characteristic tourist clusters - Belgrade, Vojvodina, South-East Serbia, South- West Serbia;  the division into these 4 tourist cluster rests on the same characteristics  good traffic connections (corridors VII and X and the Ibar Highway) with the international markets;  there is some progress and investment has been made in building corridor X but it is likely that it won’t be finished before 2014., few investment took place in corridor VII (Pan European Transport Corridor – The Danube), most significant in marina in Apatin and docks in Belgrade and Novi Sad, the question of port ownership and management remains open and also nautical regulation, major ports like Belgrade (owned by Delta Holding) and Pančevo (owned by Invej) are waiting for “better days”, there are plans to build highway reaching Montenegro borders and replacing Ibar Highway but the\n\n28. Support to implementation of the National Strategy for Tourism, Ref. no. 07SER01/23/11 Analysis of investment policies and activities and investment possibilities in tourism of the Republic of Serbia 28 contract with FCC, Spain and Alpina and PORR, Austria signed in 2007 was terminated by the new Government,  completed process of privatization of all hotel companies;  the process is not finished and I gave the list of state owned (few also “socially owned”) hotels and tourism companies  almost completely restructured, modernized and marketwise repositioned hotel and tourist-catering offer (in accordance with world standards and categorization);  I think it is far even from “almost completely”; however there is a huge shift especially by the privatized hotel companies and by new Greenfield investments  presence of several global hotel chains (Belgrade, but some other cities as well, like Novi Sad, Kragujevac, Nis), and a number of hotel chains of regional importance - especially in spas;  There are following global hotel chains present iIn Serbia: Hyatt Regency Belgrade, Holiday Inn Belgrade (there are projects of constructing Holiday Inn in Novi Sad and Kragujevac and Holiday Inn Express in Belgrade), Best Western (Hotel M and Šumadija in Belgrade, My Place in Niš and Prezident in Novi Sad) and Tulip Inn in Belgrade. Every time, someone begins construction of the new hotel a new brand is mentioned: Plaza, Hilton, Falkensteiner, Radisson etc. but none present in Serbia so far. The first hotel group emerged in Serbia: “A Hoteli”, owned by Alco Group, which consists of 5 hotels in Arandjelovac, Novi Sad, Zlatibor, Šabac and Vrnjačka Banja. They are currently negotiating with MK Mountain Resort in Kopaonik about making a hotel management group. Unfortunately, because of the “spa issue” there is no hotel chain in spas in Serbia.  application of modern standard operational procedures in all important (categorized) accommodation and catering facilities;  The same thing as by point “repositioned hotels”.  Belgrade - regional MICE center and Europe-positioned city break and touring destination;  Belgrade is for sure a strong tourism destination but it’s hard to say regional MICE center when the biggest regional congress, cultural and business center Sava center is not reconstructed since the opening in 1979. I conclude that there is not enough demand to start the project of reconstruction (which is by the way ready). There is huge shift in activities to position Belgrade as Europe city break and touring destinations and I think that if we continue this way the results will come.  a group of much demanded regional centers of winter tourism (Kopaonik, Zlatibor, Golija, Stara Planina, Tara);  Compared to the budget, enormous amounts of investments were made into infrastructural development of mountain destinations, especially Stara planina with the state owned mountain resort development project. Kopaonik is for sure the leader of the mentioned as the regional center for winter tourism, Zlatibor still relies on domestic demand (more than 90%), Stara\n\n29.

With the development of Stara planina resort this would happen in Sout East Serbia as well.  distinguishable brand of tourism on farms, together with versatile offer of activities and characteristic sale contents of Vojvodina;  Like with the brand building, it is now recognized and has brand awareness but further marketing activities are needed to strengthen the position of Vojvodina unique tourism brands.  a great number of programmes of tourism of special interest, starting from rafting, hunting, fishing, equestrian sports, ecosafaris, etc.;  There is a significant rise of these programs but needs more coherent marketing activity.  several nautical centers - marinas on the Danube as an expression of increasing interest of the domestic population in owning boats and in active rest on water;  There is a clear need for investment in marinas and nautical centers alongside the Danube but also for more international and domestic tourists. There are at least 5 boat charter companies in Belgrade compared to 1 in 2006, few new marinas and docks in Belgrade and Novi Sad, new marina in Apatin, marina and hotel development in Silver Lake, Kladovo etc., festivals that celebrate river, but in my opinion the potentials are much higher.  several thematic parks, inspired either by natural attractions, or by culture and spiritual heritage of the country;  Unfortunately this is where we really fail; there are some smaller private initiatives though.  A limited number of golf courses near Belgrade and adjacent to the biggest destinations in the country.  Except from the 9 holes course in Ada Ciganlija, Belgrade or Žabalj, Novi Sad there are no golf courses in the country. The biggest development project right now is in the Surčin Municipality, close to Belgrade, but there also some other ideas like the ones at the Palić Lake or in Pančevo, near Belgrade. In order to analyze investment activities in tourism in Serbia I created a database of categorized accommodations and restaurants with data received from MERR. It is a basic level of future “Hotel Factsheet” and in order to complete it is necessary to conduct a primary market research of hotels since some data (i.e. amount of investment) is rarely public and available (i.e. Statistical Buro of Serbia has some data on investment in hotels but\n\n30.

If we want to evaluate investment activities in Serbia by clusters, destinations and products at this moment then we have to rely on data available like The year of construction and reconstruction of the hotel and data available from secondary sources in terms of investment and ownership and on data published by the Statistical Buro of Serbia, section Construction. If we filter the database of categorized accommodation according to the years of construction for hotels and garni hotels by clusters and destinations we get the following table: Table 13: Number of hotels constructed in period 2006-2011 by clusters/destinations Clusters/Destinations 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Total new hotels BG 1 2 7 3 3 16 Arandjelovac 1 1 Belgrade 1 2 4 3 3 13 Kladovo 1 1 Smederevo 1 1 SES 2 1 3 6 Bor 1 1 Niš 2 1 3 Pirot 1 1 2 SWS 4 2 5 2 1 14 Guča 1 1 Jošanička banja 1 1 Kopaonik 1 1 Kragujevac 1 1 Kraljevo 1 1 1 3 Kruševac 1 1 Loznica 1 1 Mokra Gora 1 1 Novi Pazar 1 1 Požega 1 1 Tutin 1 1 Užice 1 1 VOJ 3 4 3 4 2 1 17 Novi Sad 2 2 4 1 9 Palić 1 1 Sombor 1 1 Sremski Karlovci 1 1 Subotica 1 3 4 Turija 1 1 Grand Total 10 8 16 12 6 1 53\n\n31.

Support to implementation of the National Strategy for Tourism, Ref. no. 07SER01/23/11 Analysis of investment policies and activities and investment possibilities in tourism of the Republic of Serbia 33 It is evident that construction of hotels in period of 2006-2011 was mainly focused on City break tourism product (MICE and Events as secondary tourism product) since 25 out of 53 hotels were in Belgrade (13), Novi Sad (9) and Niš (3). The question is to which product to connect other bigger cities i.e. Subotica (near Palić Lake) and Kraljevo which had 7 constructed hotels. The lack of this analysis, besides exact data, is the fact that some mountain destinations like Kopaonik and Zlatibor or Palić Lake and Vrnjačka Banja did have investment but mostly in private and/or uncategorized accommodation. Second useful information that can be extracted from the database is the years of reconstruction of the hotels. Even though world hotels have regular reconstruction and renovations the fact is that in Serbia majority of these hotels were privatized and then reconstructed which makes it relevant information.

Nevertheless, the data shows us a clear trend of rising in the number of hotel units since 2004 (exception is 2005) and in the number of new square meters since 2006. Top destinations in the sense of new square meters, which is in my opinion more relevant, are Palić Lake (Subotica), Zlatibor (Čajetina), Kopaonik (Raška and Brus), Belgrade, mentioned Bor, Vršac (Vila Breg business and hotel complex, investment of Hemofarm, Vršac, pharmaceutical company, in 2005) and surprisingly followed by Despotovac (Resavska cave, nature and waterfalls).

Arandjelovac takes this high position with the investment by Alco Group in reconstruction and upgrading of hotel “Izvor”. However, it is strange that Belgrade, with so many new and reconstructed hotels, didn’t record higher amount of investment in hotels and motels.\n\n43. Support to implementation of the National Strategy for Tourism, Ref. no. 07SER01/23/11 Analysis of investment policies and activities and investment possibilities in tourism of the Republic of Serbia 43 4.1 Privatization The privatization process of hotels in Serbia shares the same problems as the privatization process generally. The will to have a strategic systematic approach in hotel privatization comes late with the National Tourism Strategy in 2006. In the meantime hotels lost its markets, international tourist naturally reacted to the war situation in former Yugoslavia and domestic tourist reacted to the degradation of living standard. Hotels were neglected, abandoned, used as refugee shelter or even military/police bases. This together with absence of strategic approach in tourism made it really hard for hotels to be valuable business projects. Also, many of the city hotels were nationalized by the communist government and the Law on restitution is announced now when the privatization process is at its end. In my opinion, it was better to return these properties to the previous owners for at least one good reason – the management of the property and business project would be for sure handled better by the private owner compared to state management. Recently, “special problem” emerged with special hospitals in spas and the mentioned determination of ownership between different state institutions (state resource vs. state resource, managed by elected politicians). So the process of privatization of spas is on standby. The first Law on privatization was adopted in 1991, followed by the one from 1997 (shares to the workers) and after the democratic changes the one from 2001 (auction and tender privatization) which has significantly changed during the years. Majority of new owners are of domestic origin, even though in many cases the companies/buyers come from offshore countries. There are some cases of privatization made by foreign investors: Hotel “Sirmium”, Sremska Mitrovica, tourism company “Putnik”, hotel “Excelsior”, Belgrade, hotel “Vrujci”, Valjevo, hotel “Jadran”, Bačka Topola, hotel “Junior”, Kopaonik etc. The hotels “Metropol” and “Jugoslavija” were sold in 2006 to foreign investors but since they were sold not as companies but as property owned by “Dunav Turist”, part of Dunav Insurance Group owned by the Republic of Serbia, without any conditions (i.e. deadline for opening) they are still ruins waiting to be reconstructed. Tourism companies “Putnik” and “Srbija Turist” were sold to “Uniworld Holdings” ltd, USA owned by Serbian Srba Ilić but the contract was terminated and matter of international arbitrage with the engagement of USA administration. Unfortunately, there are more cases where the contract of privatization was terminated especially when the buyer didn’t fulfill his contract obligations or the origin of the money is connected with criminal activities (i.e. Darko Šarić, Joca Amsterdam). Some of the examples are: “Kraljevi konaci”, Zlatibor - buyer Zoran Joksimović, wife of Milomir Joksimović aka Miša Omega, suspected that behind the purchase is Sreten Jocić aka Joca Amsterdam; Hotel Prag in Belgrade was sold on a public auction in 2007 to Jovan Pejčić and Tomislav Djordjević for 850 mil RSD (Mr. Dimitrije Kostić claims the right for restitution and this is common to many city hotels). Mr. Pejčić and Mr. Djordjević are also the owners of hotel \"Novi Sad\" and Mr. Djordjević unsuccessfully privatized hotel “Fontana”, Vrnjačka Banja. Mr. Tomislav Djordjević is the former owner of Meridian Bank which he sold to Credit Agricole bank. The contract for hotel “Prag” was terminated and the buyer Tomislav Djordjević sues Agency for privatisation; Hotel “Jagodina”, Jagodina – was sold to Milomir Joksimović aka Miša Omega but the contract was terminated due to unfulfilling of the contract obligations; Dubravka\n\n44. Support to implementation of the National Strategy for Tourism, Ref. no. 07SER01/23/11 Analysis of investment policies and activities and investment possibilities in tourism of the Republic of Serbia 44 Djordjević, the daughter of Tomislav Djordjević, from Novi Sad bought 70% of PTT Ugostiteljstvo which owns hotels \"Srebrnac\", Kopaonik, \"Zelenkada\", Zlatibor, restaurants \"Rujno\" and \"Serdarev konak\", Zlatibor (Villa \"Poštanski dom\" was exempt from privatisation and now belongs to Solidarity foundation). After few months the hotels were given to Milan Joksimović, the son of Milomir Joksimović; narco boss Darko Šarić bought tourism company Palić which owns hotel “Prezident”, Palić and “Patria”, Subotica and clubs and restaurants, hotels “Vojvodina” and “Putnik”, Novi Sad etc.; similar controversies were recorded in other companies and hotels even by today respected representatives of the tourism industry in Serbia. Majority of buyers in the privatization process were mainly companies – people which developed businesses in other industries. This comes natural since there was no way to develop tourism business in the 90’s and even in the post Milošević Serbia as the existing inherited tourism industry and market collapsed. Yet, recently professional tourism business companies emerged mainly on the foundations of successfully privatized hotels and tourism companies. That is the case with Alco Group, MK Holding, Mona, Todor and many other smaller companies which will be mentioned later in the text. What remains for privatization? According to the data receive from the Agency for privatization the companies/hotels in the following table are candidates for the process of privatization. Most of them weren’t privatized and are owned by the state or still have social capital as ownership (type of ownership invented in communist Yugoslavia – the property belongs to the society). Some companies are here because the contract of privatization was terminated, some belong to the military or public enterprises.

Banks that seize hotels because of not repaid loans hire companies to run it and prepare for sale. This could be an opportunity for domestic companies which proved to be good managers of the hotels to expand their business with little investment. The point is to have specific solutions for the companies, instead of letting them make high debts, degrade and then trying to sell them through the mechanism of the Agency for privatization. Particular situation is with special hospitals/hotels in spas governed by the Ministry of health, which initiated the process of privatization together with the MERR and Agency for privatization in 2008. The process is on standby since the PIO Fund (Pension and Invalid Fund) initiated the process of determining the ownership on these and other companies in which they invested when the economy was good and the fund had the money. According to the statement made by Mr. Valerijan Kadijević, director of the PIO Fund, these are the companies and estimated amount invested: Table: Companies for which PIO Fund initated the process of determining the ownership Nr. Name Invested by PIO Fund (mil €) 1 Zlatar 26,4 2 Special hospital Čigota, Zlatibor 21,3 3 Niška Banja 20,4 4 Special hospital „Ivanjica“ 18,2"
