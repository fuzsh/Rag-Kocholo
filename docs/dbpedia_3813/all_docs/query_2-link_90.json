This edition encompasses only the evidence related to crimes against civilian population and civilian facilities during the first month of aggression - from 24 March to 24 April 1999. The aggression itself, representing the crime against peace, is the first and the greatest crime. The crime of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes were also committed. The book was compiled during the aggression, in the conditions of continuous bombardment, disrupted communications and power supply, as well as conditions for the functioning of government bodies rendered difficult, which considerably impeded and slowed down the gathering of evidence and data about the crimes. For these reasons, more information and evidence had been collected about some crimes than about some others that perhaps deserve more attention. The investigation procedure concerning all these crimes is under way. Therefore, the presented data, particularly those about the number of civilian casualties and the scope of material damage, are not final. In addition, some injured persons died in the meantime, while the remains of some victims have not been recovered or identified. The aim of the White Book is to present to the international public the evidence about the crimes committed during the aggression against the FR of Yugoslavia. Under the NATO influence, a fierce anti-Serb and anti-Yugoslav propaganda campaign was undertaken in all NATO and European Union Member States and other countries with the aim of covering up mass crimes against civilian population. Therefore, most countries lacked true information about the crimes committed in the FR of Yugoslavia. Relays and broadcasting systems of all Yugoslav television and radio stations had been systematically destroyed with the same aim, which also prevented the broadcasting via satellite. Having in mind that in some aggressor countries their citizens demand action before national or international courts against persons responsible for committed crimes and ask the Yugoslav bodies for relevant evidence, this book is also intended to serve this purpose. By its intensity and military might, the aggression against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is the biggest after World War II. It was undertaken by NATO, the alliance of 19 most developed countries in the world, 10 of which took active part in the aggression with 1,100 planes and other most sophisticated weaponry. NATO flew 25,200 sorties over the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, dropping 25,000 tons of explosives. Besides the direct participants, many countries took part in the aggression indirectly, by allowing the aggressors to use their territory, military equipment and installations and by rendering in other ways logistic, military and other forms of assistance (Albania, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYR of Macedonia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania). NATO was u n select ive about its victims. Children, women and the elderly perished, as well as mothers with their newborn babies, patients on dialysis, refugee columns, -XIII-\n\njournalists and TV crews on assignments, farmers in the fields, vendors on produce markets, passengers in buses and trains, people crossing the bridges... Residential houses and even whole residential neighborhoods have been destroyed or heavily damaged, bridges and overpasses, roads and railway tracks, oil refineries and economic facilities of vital importance, as well as television and radio relays and transmitters have been demolished, telephone lines have been severed. Numerous medical, educational and cultural institutions, churches, monasteries, cemeteries and other religious facilities were also the objects of destruction. Systematic destruction of installations for electricity generation and transmission throughout the territory of the FR of Yugoslavia resulted in the complete interruption of power and water supply, causing true humanitarian catastrophe. The consequences for the life and health of the population due to enormous environmental pollution caused by bombing are grave and evident, not only for the FR of Yugoslavia and neighboring countries, but for the entire Europe. Among the killed civilians 30% are children, while the share of children among the wounded is even higher - 40%. Bombing also threatened about 120,000 women who had just given birth, as well as their newborn babies, some of whom were born during air strikes. About 1,300,000 primary and secondary school students were deprived of school classes during the bombing. The entire civilian population, particularly children, were exposed to daily stress caused by continuous daytime and nighttime bombing, causing traumas and other psychological disorders which may accompany them until the end of their life. More than half casualties in Kosovo and Metohija were ethnic Albanians - those whose alleged protection prompted the aggression, termed \"humanitarian intervention\" by its perpetrators. In flagrant breach of the provisions of Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations, without the authorization of the UN Security Council, the NATO air and naval forces started on 24 March 1999 systematic and extensive daily bombing of military and civilian targets throughout the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Through indiscriminate dropping of airplane bombs, missiles and other kinds of projectiles on residential areas, medical and educational institutions, economic facilities, roads, bridges, buses and trains, NATO has also violated provisions of international humanitarian law, the fundamental human rights, including the right to life, as well as provisions of the international traffic and environmental law. Among others, the Geneva Conventions on the Law of War (1949) and Additional Protocol No. I to these Conventions (1977), The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 and other international conventions have been violated. Besides international instruments, NATO has violated the provisions of its own Statute, according to which it is a regional defensive organization, which may act only in the territory of its Member States. By the aggression against Yugoslavia, most NATO Member States violated their constitutions and laws, which prohibit this kind of armed action. The Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia submitted application to the International Court of Justice against the NATO Member States which committed the aggression, requesting the Court to adjudge and declare that: - by taking part in the bombing of the territory of FRY, the obligation not to use force against another State has been breached; - by taking part in the training, arming, financing, equipping and supplying the socalled \"Kosovo Liberation Army\", the obligation not to intervene in the internal affairs of another State has been breached; - by taking part in the attacks on civilian targets, the obligation to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects has been breached; -XIV-\n\n- by taking part in destroying or damaging monasteries and monuments of culture, the obligation not to commit any act of hostility directed against historical monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute cultural and spiritual heritage of people has been breached; - by taking part in the use of cluster bombs, the obligation not to use prohibited weapons, i.e. weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering has been breached; - by taking part in the bombing of oil refineries and chemical plants, the obligation not to cause considerable environmental damage has been breached; - by taking part in the use of weapons containing depleted uranium, the obligation not to use prohibited weapons and not to cause far-reaching health and environmental damage has been breached; - by taking part in killing civilians, destroying enterprises, communications, health and cultural institutions, the obligation to respect the right to life, the right to work, the right to information, the right to health care as well as other basic human rights has been breached; - by taking part in destroying bridges on international rivers, the obligation to respect freedom of navigation on international rivers has been breached; - by taking part in the activities listed above, and in particular by causing enormous environmental damage, by using depleted uranium and by depriving of the supply of electricity and water, the obligation not to deliberately inflict on a national group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction, in whole or in part, has been breached. The Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia requested the Court to declare the NATO Member States which committed the aggression against the FR of Yugoslavia: - responsible for the violation of the above international obligations; - obliged to stop immediately the violation of the above obligations vis-a-vis the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; - obliged to provide compensation for the damage done to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its citizens and juridical persons, while the FR of Yugoslavia reserved the right to submit subsequently accurate evaluation of the damage. The evidence contained in the White Book witnesses to NATO crimes committed against the FR of Yugoslavia and its citizens. Responsible for the committed crimes and war damage are the NATO alliance, its Member States which participated in the aggression against the FR of Yugoslavia, and other states which indirectly assisted NATO. Besides states and governments, responsible are individuals, from order-issuing authorities - heads of state or government, ministers of defense, Secretary General of NATO, military commanders and others - to those who directly executed the orders, pilots engaged in bombing. The committed crimes have not been denied, but have been justified by so-called humanitarian intervention to save the ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo and Metohija, although precisely the bombing caused humanitarian catastrophe in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Belgrade, 26 May 1999\n\nFEDERAL MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS\n\nŽivadin\n\nJovanović\n\nBombing of a Refugee Column on the Djakovica-Prizren Road 14 April 1999\n\nRefugee convoy, civilian casualties - a drastic example On April 14,1999, between 1:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m., on the Djakovica-Prizren road, near the villages of Madanaj and Meja, a convoy of Albanian refugees was targeted three times. Mostly women, children and old people were in the convoy, returning to their homes in cars, on tractors and carts. The first assault on the column of over 1,000 people took place while they were moving through Meja village. Twelve persons were killed on that occasion. The people from the convoy scattered around and tried to find shelter in the nearby houses. But, NATO warplanes launched missiles on those houses as well, killing another seven persons in the process. The attack continued along the road between villages Meja and Bistražin. One tractor with trailer was completely destroyed. Twenty people out of several of them on the tractor were killed. In the repeated attack on the refugee vehicles, one more person was killed. The total number of killed in this attack was 73, whereas 36 were wounded.\n\n1\n\nPhoto 1\n\nA view of the bombed refugee column in Meja village, Djakovica Municipality\n\nPhoto 2\n\nA view of the bombed refugee column in Meja village, Djakovica Municipality\n\n2\n\nPhoto 3\n\nPhoto 4\n\nClose-up of the victims of bombing\n\nTorn hand of a bombing victim in Meja village, Djakovica Municipality 3\n\nPhoto 5\n\nPhoto 6\n\n4\n\nScorched tractor Municipality\n\nin\n\nwhich\n\nseveral persons\n\nSeveral bodies burning down in Bistrazin\n\nfound\n\ndeath\n\nin\n\nBistrazin,\n\nDjakovica\n\nPhoto 8\n\nBombed refugee column in Gradis on the Djakovica-Prizren road\n\n5\n\nPhoto 9\n\nPhoto\n\n10\n\nDemolished tractor and a passenger car in Gradis\n\nBombed refugee column in the village of Madanaj near Sadrija Hasanaj's house, on\n\n6\n\nthe\n\nDjakovica-Prizren\n\nroad\n\nPhoto 11\n\nPhoto\n\n12\n\nA tractor with several victims in the village of Madanaj\n\nClose-up of victims near Sadrija Hasanaj's house\n\n7\n\nPhoto 13\n\nVictims\n\nPhoto 14\n\nMother and daughter killed in the village of Madanaj\n\n8\n\nPhoto 15\n\nPhoto 16\n\nSadrija Hasanaj's demolished house in which several persons were killed\n\nFragment of the bomb\n\nwhich struck the refugee\n\ncolumn\n\nin\n\nGradis,\n\nDjakovica\n\nMunicipality 9\n\nPhoto 17\n\nPhoto\n\n10\n\n18\n\nFragment of the missile which struck the refugee column, with visible marks\n\nA bomb fragment near Sadrija Hasanaj's house in the village of Madanaj\n\nPhoto\n\n19\n\nPhoto 20\n\nBombed refugee column on\n\nthe Djakovica-Prizren road\n\nDemolished tractor trailer\n\n11\n\nPhoto 21\n\nPhoto 22\n\n12\n\nDemolished tractor\n\nTractor struck by a missile\n\nPhoto 25\n\nPhoto 26\n\nBodies of bombardment victims\n\nClose-up of victims' bodies\n\n15\n\nPhoto 28\n\nBlown-up body\n\n17\n\nPhoto 30\n\nA victim's head blown away\n\n19\n\nPhoto 31 Close-up of a victim's head blown away\n\nPhoto 32 An arm torn away 20\n\nRepublic of Serbia Ministry of the Interior Secretariat of the Interior in Djakovica Dispatch No. 2583/99 14 April 1999 Djakovica Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Serbia - Criminal Police HQ - Police HQ - Operations Center Belgrade Ministry of the Interior HQ Priština On 14 April 1999 between 1:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m., the criminal N A T O forces committed an air assault on a column of refugees - members of the Albanian ethnic community, which moved from the direction of the village of Junik, Dečani Municipality, by a country road, through the villages of Šeremet, Racaj, Madanaj, Meja, and further through Brekovac and the town of Djakovica, towards the village of Bistražin, Djakovica Municipality. T h e refugee column moved in an organized fashion, on tractors and trailers. The air strike occurred while the column moved on a country road through the village of Meja. The pilots from several criminal planes struck the column with missiles, killing 12 civilians, mainly women and children. After the first missile was fired, the survivors in the column abandoned the vehicles and ran towards the nearby house of Sadrija Hasanaj, where they sought refuge. Having seen where the people sought shelter, the pilots of the criminal N A T O alliance struck the mentioned house, adjoining buildings, farm machinery and vehicles in the house yard, killing another seven persons and wounding many. We found six wounded persons on the site, while others ran in fear to nearby woods, together with persons who remained unharmed. Four bodies were identified on the spot: 1. Martin Hasanaj 2. Lek Hasanaj, both from the village of Meja, Djakovica Municipality 3. Salji Djokaj and 4. Škendi Djokaj, the latter two from the village of Junik, Decani Municipality. Six wounded persons, whose identity has not been established yet, have been admitted to the General Hospital in Djakovica and treated at the Surgical Ward. They sustained severe wounds which might be fatal. In further bombardment, the family house of Vitor Gojani in the village of Meja was struck and damaged. There is a 2 x 2 m crater by the house, approximately 2 m deep, as well as fragments of a missile.

Another missile was fired at Vuk Karadžić Street, at the houses on the left-hand side of the street Nos. 21 owned by Slobodan Sekulović, 23 owned by Miodrag Marinković, 25 owned by Tomislav Stojković, 27-29 owned by Dragomir Miladinović, 31 owned by Branko Stevanović, 33 owned by Srbislav Stojanović, 35 owned by Ljubisav Todorović and 37 owned by Mileta Miletić, and on the houses on the right-hand side of the street Nos. 4 owned by Dragan Marinković, 6 owned by Novica Dragićević, 8 owned by Tomislav Mihajlović, 10 owned by Mirjana Radivojević, 12 owned by Bratislav Pejčić, 16 owned by Dragan Mladenović, 18 owned by R a d e Stojanović, 22 owned by Najdan Jonić, 26 owned by Dragoljub Živadinović. The strongest impact was probably on the house belonging to Dragomir Miladinović since it is completely ruined and other houses were damaged in a similar way. One missile hit the lot of D T P \"Angrokolonijal\" company located between the warehouse of the mentioned company and DP \" E M P A \" Aleksinac. A 10 m x 10 m crater, 3 m deep, is 6 meters away from the fence facing the street of Petar Zec towards the old highway. This is the place where Velimir Stanković, the watchman of D T P \"Angrokolonijal\", was killed while sitting in the watchman's house of DP \" E M P A \" together with Veroljub Milutinović, the watchman of DP \" E M P A \" . A pool of blood, 1.5 m x 1.00 m large, was found in the area between the end of the watchman's house and the interior of DP \" E M P A \" , 2.5 meters from an iron cover bearing post. Between the end of the watchman's house and the above mentioned place, 0.30 m away, another pool of blood was found, 0.20 m x 0.20 m large. Blood stains were discovered on the wall of the watchman's house facing DP \" E M P A \" . Another missile fell on the lot between DP \"Betonjerka\", Aleksinac and \"Šumatovac\" driving school, 25 m from the DP \"Betonjerka\" fence towards the \"Šumatovac\" driving school and 30 m from the road on the north side. A 3 m deep crater is of the size 10 m x 10 m. The investigative judge was informed by the Aleksinac police that one missile hit the \"Deligrad\" barracks in Aleksinac, but since the investigation thereof was conducted by military authorities, the investigative judge did not visit the location.\n\n57\n\nThe forensic technician photographed and made sketches of all the above mentioned locations. They were also filmed with a camera by the Niš Police Department. The material will constitute an integral part of this report.\n\nDAMAGE Civilian buildings, i.e. residential houses on Dušan Trivunac Street, from Nos. 56 to 62, are completely destroyed, whereas the houses from Nos. 31 to 37 on the same street are greatly damaged. The same applies to the houses on Vuk Karadžić Street, from Nos. 21 to 43 and 4 to 26. Also considerable damage was inflicted on the facilities of DP \" F R A D \" , \"Jelka Radulović\", \" E M P A \" , \"Istrana\", DP \"Angrokolonijal\", \"Živinarstvo\" \"PIK\" Aleksinac, DP Konfekcije \"Morava\", DP \"Betonjerka\", as well as all private and socially owned shops and cafes on Knjaz Miloš Street and other streets of Aleksinac. Therefore, the investigative judge appointed expert consultants to establish the type and nature of the damage and the exact locations of missile impacts. Their report will be attached to this report as its integral part. Also an integral part of this report will be the report of the Commission for damage assessment established by the Aleksinac Civil Defense Headquarters. T h e Commission will personally investigate and assess the damage on locations, based on citizens' reports. D u e to objective circumstances, the investigative judge is at this point of time unable to assess the extent of damage which is indubitably huge, because the majority of buildings in town and its broader area are damaged.\n\nPERSONS INVOLVED As a result of the event, the below mentioned persons were killed and found on the spot.
