        "text": "MILITARY IS STRONG FOREIGN-POLITICAL TRUMP OF SERBIA\n\nThere is no doubt that Serbia is the most important factor of stability on the Balkans, as there is no doubt that Serbian army is one of the most serious and strongest air forces in this region. NATO and other officials admitted that.\n\nAfter more than one decade, Serbian AF is returning as one of the main trump of our foreign policy. After years of warfare and playing politics, AF is becoming one of the strongest pillars of good relations which Serbia is building with other countries.\n\nThat was shown in Turkey, where Minister of Defence Dragan Sutanovac and his colleague Mehmed Veji Gonul pointed out that relations between two AF would be a pillar of good relations of the two countries. The roll of AF will be shown in redefining the relations of Serbia and USA, especially during the visit of the US Vice-president Joseph Biden to Belgrade. According to the announcement from the USA, precisely military cooperation of recent enemies is pointing out as one of the important links of new relations between Serbia and USA.\n\nThere is no doubt that Serbia is the most important factor of stability on the Balkans, as there is no doubt that Serbian army is one of the most serious and strongest armed forces in this region. That admittance Serbian AF was given by the NATO, and I have received those confirmations from all the countries whose officials I have met. I’m reminding that during the visits abroad, along with the Ministry delegation, I have been always accepted by the highest representatives of the host country, by the President, Vice-president, Prime ministers and Ministers. All that appoints to that Serbian AF has regained international reputation, and that they don’t see us with prejudice from the nineties anymore, instead they count on our armed forces as the most serious stability factor of the Balkans! That was the case during recent visit to Turkey.\n\nIn Turkey you have, beside the Minister of Defence and Chief of GF, also spoken with the President Abdulah Gul. Before you Minister of Foreign Affairs Vuk Jeremic has also visited Turkey. How come such interest in Turkey?\n\nSerbia and Turkey are being connected by lots of different things, from economical and security connections to relative connections of our and Turkish citizens, over number of friendly connections which we have with this country. Turkey is large and powerful economic and military force. As for defence it is in the top of the NATO Military forces, and Turkish armed forces are among one of the most serious and most respectable armed forces in the world, and defence industry is also in expansion. Our military industry whishes to realize cooperation in several programs with Turkey and that was one of the themes of our talks.\n\nAs one of possible joint projects with Turkey you mentioned airport “Ladjevci” near Kraljevo?\n\n“Ladjevci” are one of large projects of the Ministry of Defence and the Government. Our wish is that airport become a civil-military airport and that citizens across the region have possibility of using this airport. Especially interesting is that citizens of Sandzak, who daily travel to Turkey, have a possibility not to fly from Prishtina anymore, but from “Ladjevci”. Realization of this project would give one new economic impulse to the whole region. About two million citizens who are living in the surrounding area could use this airport, and there are a large number of tourist destinations nearby.\n\nTurkey is the largest country in this part of Europe, who won’t become a EU member for a long time. Does these intensive relations with Ankara are showing that Serbia is searching for its place in the cooperation with those countries who won’t become EU members?\n\nRelations between Serbia and Turkey don’t have direct connections with Serbia’s plans regarding European integrations. Simply, I believe that it is clear to everybody that no one else will be able to access to EU unless they achieve high level of stability in the country, and Turkey indeed can have certain positive influence on that condition. Also, Turkey gave its full support to our European path. They are very aware that the question of EU integration is very important to all citizens who live in former Yugoslav countries.\n\nHow come cooperation between Serbia and Turkey? Isn’t it more natural that the Turkish co-operator would be Bosnia, or even Kosovo? Ankara has accepted Kosovo’s self-declaration.\n\nNo matter what specific affinities someone has on the Balkans, no one can go around Serbia. Simply, Serbia is located in that way. Everybody understands that if they wish to have good relations with Balkan countries, they have to have good relations with Serbia as well. Turkish Minister of Defence Mehmed Veji Gonul emphasized on the press conference that regardless the fact that Turkey doesn’t have mutual boundary with Serbia, they are considering us as their neighbors. President of Turkey Gul have sent clear message, pointing out that all the citizens who live in Serbia should consider Serbia as their home country and they should behave in accordance with that.\n\nIt would be nice that US Vice-president Joseph Biden deliver the same message when he arrives in Belgrade, but it is hard to expect. What do you expect from Biden’s visit, because it was announced that one of the subjects would be military relations between USA and Serbia?\n\nI don’t expect that US Vice-president Joseph Biden come to Belgrade and starts to making conditions, on the contrary. Above all, I expect the visit to be friendly. I believe that he wishes to see the way in which politicians and public in Serbia thinks, first of all about serbo-american relations, and is there a space for cooperation even though we don’t agree over Kosovo. I am deeply convinced that this, in a way, presents giving the hand along with the wish that relations should be brought up on a higher level, which is definitely interest of both sides!\n\nDo you expect the pressure on Serbia regarding entering the NATO and critics of our decision to be military neutral? What kind of position will you take, if those questions bring up?\n\nI don’t expect any critics. It is naïve to believe that important person like this would come to Serbia to criticize us! Citizens should know that we are being envied by certain number of countries because Serbia is on list of countries that will be visited by the US Vice-president in his first mandate year. Neither I can, neither I wish to take any other position from the one that presents Serbian national politics. There is no dilemma that the positions of all interlocutors will be unique. Considering cooperation with NATO, that is almost always foreign policy issue.\n\nHow come that military has become Serbian foreign policy instrument? Do you consult with Minister Vuk Jeremic?\n\nCertainly, prior to every trip abroad or the visit of a foreign official, Defence policy sector of Ministry of Defence is recollecting Ministries positions that are linked to the country. If there are any particularities, as there are for some countries, I talk with Minister Jeremic. It happens that he calls me for the trips, but I am convinced that it should be done much more seriously by the intellectual elite in Serbia. We are missing serious research institutes where professional people, who are not influenced by the daily politics, considering strategy and suggesting solutions, as it is the case in large countries. Unfortunately such institutions in Serbia, like NGOs, mostly presents only some political party.\n\nSo that means that there is no argument between you and Vuk Jeremic?\n\nThere was never an argument between me and Jeremic."
