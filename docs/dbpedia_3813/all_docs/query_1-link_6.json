The first more significant task in which battalion was engaged was the construction of grass runaway within the first Yugoslav Army in the area of Knić.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1958, the battalion performed the tasks dedicated to building the airport Leskovac and Niš, and until 1962 it completed the airport in Tuzla garrison.\n\nIn 1962, the battalion was relocated in Kraljevo garrison and engaged in building the airport \"Lađevci\". The construction of the airport \"Lаđevci\" was completed in 1966, when the battalion was relocated in Bela Crkva garrison where it remained until 1968.\n\nIn 1968, the battalion was relocated to Pančevo garrison, where it is currently stationed.\n\nIn its history, 333rd Engineer Battalion participated in construction of all military airports. At the beginning, it primarily built grass airstrips and asphalt surface airstrips (airports \"Divci\", \"Zalužani\", \"Batajnica\", \"Zemunik\", \"Leskovac\", \"Niš\", \"Tuzla\" and \"Lađevci\").\n\nIntroduction of the asphalt production and installation plant into the battalion formation launched the process of putting asphalt surface on the previously constructed airstrips and construction of new airports with asphalt airstrips.\n\nIn that phase, battalion was engaged in the airports \"Ivangrad\", \"Sjenica\", \"Cerklje\", \"Bihać\", \"Ponikve\", \"Golubovci\", \"Priština\", \"Udbine\", \"Petrovac\", \"Lađevci\", \"Mostar\", \"Varaždin\", \"Mahovljani\", \"Batajnica\" and \"Niš\".\n\nIn parallel with these tasks, battalion performed construction works including grass airstrips construction at the airports \"Glamoč\", \"Novo Mesto\", \"Trstenik\", \"Ponikve\" and \"Zrenjanin\".\n\nFrom 1979 to 1989, battalion was engaged in preparations for demolition of all military and civil airports on the territory of former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (apart from the airport \"Butmir\" – due to the Winter Olympics preparations and realization).\n\nSince 1990, battalion has been engaged in construction of AD missile and radar units infrastructure facilities, roads, grass airstrips repairs, ski paths repairs and providing services to the subjects beyond the Serbian Armed Forces and Ministry of Defence.\n\nContact Information\n\nAddress: 1, Jabučki put St., Pančevo\n\nPhone: +381 (0) 13 2512-910\n\nFax: +381 (0) 13 326-546\n\nEmail: 333inzbat@vs.rs"
