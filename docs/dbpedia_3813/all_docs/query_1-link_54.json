        "text": "May 5, 1999\n\nWeb posted at: 9:15 a.m. EDT (1315 GMT)\n\nIn this story:\n\nWednesday attacks\n\nDiplomatic efforts ongoing\n\nRELATED STORIES, SITES\n\nBELGRADE, Yugoslavia (CNN) -- Two American soldiers were killed early Wednesday when their U.S. Army Apache attack helicopter crashed on a training mission in Albania. The fatalities were NATO's first during the Yugoslavia campaign.\n\nNATO Supreme Commander Gen. Wesley Clark said there was \"no indication of hostile fire\" and that the cause of the crash was under investigation.\n\nThe chopper was the second Apache to crash since 24 of the aircraft were dispatched to Albania last month. So far the Apaches -- generally used in low-level night flying to target tanks -- have not been deployed in attacks on Yugoslavia.\n\nThe other Apache crash was during a training mission in Albania on April 26. The two crewmen were not injured.\n\nNATO has also lost an F-117 stealth fighter and an F-16 over Serbia and a Harrier jump jet that crashed into the Adriatic Sea while returning to its amphibious assault carrier. The pilots of all those aircraft were recovered safely.\n\nWednesday attacks\n\nMeanwhile, Operation Allied Force continued over Yugoslavia, where NATO attacks targeted more command-and-control sites, bridges and fuel stores, said spokesman Jamie Shea.\n\nAccording to Yugoslav National Radio, several areas were bombarded by NATO overnight. Several areas around Belgrade were struck, including the military airport of Batajnica, the radio said. Several explosions were heard throughout Belgrade.\n\nThe Ladjevci area, near the town of Kraljevo, was hit by \"several\" missiles, the radio said. That area has been bombed several times before. The Krusik factory in Valjevo was hit with three missiles, allegedly leaving two wounded.\n\nThe town of Vranje was hit with four missiles. The radio says \"substantial\" damage was inflicted to the town. And Kosovo's capital of Pristina was also attacked, with missiles hitting the areas of Golas and the Slatina military airport.\n\nNATO officials repeated their contention that the campaign to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept an international peace plan for Kosovo was working well.\n\n\"(Serb forces) are now essentially avoiding NATO power,\" Clark said at a news briefing Wednesday in Brussels. \"They are limiting their movement, they are limiting their activities. They are limiting their resupply, they are trying to do everything they can to reduce their vulnerability, because when they are seen, they are hit, and when they are hit, they are killed.\"\n\nBut, Clark said, ethnic cleansing continues, increasingly perpetrated by paramilitary forces on the ground in Kosovo.\n\nDiplomatic efforts ongoing\n\nNATO began its bombing campaign on March 24 after Milosevic rejected the peace plan hammered out in talks in Rambouillet, France. That plan would have called for an international peacekeeping force to enforce its terms, but Milosevic refuses to accept such a force from NATO.\n\nNATO is continuing its attacks on Yugoslavia amid diplomatic efforts to end the war\n\nFormer Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has been shuttling between Belgrade and Western capitals trying to iron out an agreement between Yugoslavia and NATO. NATO has repeatedly said its bombing campaign would not end until Milosevic agrees to its terms, which include the international force protecting the return to Kosovo of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees.\n\nRussia opposes the use of force against the Serbs.\n\nOn Tuesday, Chernomyrdin flew to Washington, where he met with President Bill Clinton and other officials. The U.S. officials were non-committal about the results of the talks, but Chernomyrdin was optimistic that an agreement might be near.\n\nHopes were raised earlier in the week when Milosevic released three American prisoners of war to U.S. civil rights leader Jesse Jackson. The three had been held for more than a month after being captured near the Macedonia border.\n\nIn the wake of that release, Clinton ordered Defense Secretary William Cohen to review the status of two Yugoslav prisoners held by NATO.\n\nCohen said Wednesday he expects a report -- and a decision on the possible release -- shortly.\n\nClinton is in Europe for meetings with NATO leaders in Brussels and U.S. troops in Germany.\n\nAnd on Thursday, the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven nations plan a meeting in Germany, where they will reportedly issue a joint statement on the principles for a political settlement of the Kosovo crisis.\n\nTheir statement, calling for an international military peacekeeping force, is expected to be a prelude to a U.N. resolution on the terms for peace.\n\nRussia will join with the G-7 nations in the agreement, diplomats said.\n\nCorrespondents John Raedler, Brent Sadler and Rusty Dornin contributed to this report.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nClinton heads to Europe for NATO bombing update\n\nMay 4, 1999\n\nNATO pounds Yugoslav targets after flurry of diplomacy\n\nMay 4, 1999\n\nNATO strikes knock out Serb electrical power\n\nMay 3, 1999\n\nNATO airstrikes press on despite prisoner release\n\nMay 2, 1999\n\nTwo jets crash in Kosovo campaign\n\nMay 2, 1999\n\nMore refugees pour into Albania, Macedonia\n\nApril 30, 1999\n\nRELATED SITES:\n\nExtensive list of Kosovo-related sites:\n\n Kosovo\n\nYugoslavia:\n\n Federal Republic of Yugoslavia official site\n\n Kesovo and Metohija facts\n\n Serbia Ministry of Information\n\n Serbia Now!
