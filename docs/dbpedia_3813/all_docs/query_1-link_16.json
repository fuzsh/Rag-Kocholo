        "text": "-This year, up till now, 820 of professional soldiers have been admitted to the Serbian Armed Forces, and by the end of the year the total of 968 professional soldiers will take their place in the lines of Serbian Armed Forces. Apart from them, additional 46 officers will assume their command duties by the end of the year and thus additionally strengthen the lines of our military – Minister of Defence Aleksandar Vulin stated during today’s visit to the Logistics Training Centre in Kraljevo.\n\nAccording to his words, that is how one of the major problems of the Serbian Armed Forces will be resolved – the manning, so that our military could fulfil its tasks, to act responsibly and in line with laws, and the expectations of our country.\n\n- The Government of the Republic of Serbia and the Supreme Commander will do everything in their power to enhance the material situation and to enable suitable manning. You may rest assured that as long as we have such military, our everyday life and our overall way of living will be preserved and safe. The Serbian Armed Forces will continue fulfilling its constitutional obligations, and the Government of the Republic of Serbia and the supreme commander are here to enable unhindered functioning, to enable manning of our units so that, in accordance with the requirements, we can respond to every task – Minister Vulin highlighted.\n\nMinister Vulin noted that the Ministry of Defence always endeavoured to establish the best possible relations with local governments, and that it succeeded in that, because it was important for the life of the citizens of Kraljevo and for everyday life of our members.\n\n- For thirty years now, not even one flat has been constructed in Kraljevo and I think that it is high time this situation was changed. The Ministry of Defence is definitely ready to participate in that, and I am convinced that the local government recognises the need to help its citizens who are the members of Serbian Armed Forces. When it comes to “Beranovac” training ground, where care races, motorbike and bicycle races are often held, we can say that it is also one of the significant parts of infrastructure also important for the town of Kraljevo. We have talked about the airport, about the necessity of its completion and I am sure that the departmental ministry in collaboration with the Serbian Armed Forces will rather quickly come up with a concrete proposal of what we really can do – Minister Vulin stressed.\n\nDuring today’s visit to Kraljevo garrison, Minister Vulin, accompanied by Chief of General Staff of Serbian Armed Forces General Ljubiša Diković and Commander of Training Command Lieutenant General Đokica Petrović, visited the members of Logistic Training Centre of the Training Command in the barracks “Ribnica”, where Deputy Commander of the Centre Lieutenant Colonel Milan Terzić informed them about the main tasks and the state of the unit. Minister Vulin attended demonstration of training in operating motor vehicles, for the cadets of 139th generation of the Military Academy on the automobile race-track “Beranovac”.\n\nIn “Ribnica” barracks, Minister Vulin met the mayor of the town of Kraljevo Predrag Terzić and Head of administrative district of Raška Nebojša Simović.\n\nAfter the meeting, Simović expressed his gratitude to the Ministry of Defence and Serbian Armed Forces who had always been together with their people in the territory of that district and whenever the need arose in case of natural disasters. He also noted the strategic significance of developing the airfield “Lađevci“ for that district.\n\nDeputy Mayor of the town of Kraljevo Marica Mijailović underscored that the talks held on that day between the representatives of that town and Minister Vulin were extremely useful and fruitful and covered the strategic topics for development of the town of Kraljevo, among them being airfield “Lađevci“, military club in that town, construction of flats for the members of Serbian Armed Forces and the automobile race-track “Beranovac”."
