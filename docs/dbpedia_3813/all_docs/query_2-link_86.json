Most of these bands crossed musical genres, and had a message that many could relate to. Lyrics that inspired you, and music that actually made you feel something..

BOX 8886 MINNEAPOLIS, MN S5408 Vique, I seriously hope you were in a daze when you wrote your letter to Jonathan Lee. I hope it was just a brainstorm that made you write this and when you read it once again you were terribly embarrassed of that bollox but unfortunately you had mailed it already. Or maybe you have another good excuse. I thought what Jonathan wrote makes sense and is properly thought out. I may not agree with all parts of it, but hey it’s his opinion. It’s interesting to read an intelligent male’s view on all those “women’s issues.” Maybe I should stress the word “intelligent” in the sentence above, because your reply was anything but intelligent. What’s the point you were trying to make? That no male should have the right to say anything about women’s issues just because they will never experience any of the problems personally but “only” as an outside observer? Sometimes people not directly involved in an action have a better (more objective, that is) comprehension of what’s really going on than the person affected. You simply said he doesn’t and can’t have any comprehension at all. That’s just the most ignorant, arrogant, sexist, self-pityish (if that word exists) thing one can do. In short: that’s everything this scene (I love that word) definitely doesn’t need. So I guess if I was to fight anybody it would be you because in my eyes you are the enemy. Do you think you are the only person in the world who knows what’s going on? So many people have experienced some awful stuff, so many people think about stuff (probably more than you do, according to your letter). You call Jonathan Lee a poor baby while all you do is console yourself for all those bad things that all those bad people keep doing to you/your gender. Well to me it looks like Jonathan Lee is more likely trying to make this world a better place than you are. Besides, why do you find it necessary to talk about abortion & guilt as if that was the only correct collocation? Could it be possible that YOU don’t have “any comprehension of some issues at all”? God — more liberal bullshit — you just don *t get it do you. You read what you want to read and don *t see the whole picture. I never said “That no male should have the right to say anything about women's issues.” What I said was that no man should say that he fully understands an issue that only women can comprehend , as it is a result of actual experience that leads to understanding, not just empathy or sympathy. I fully think that a man can say what he wants and think what he wants about any issue, but my point was that he can't expect it to be as powerful as an emotion as it is for a woman. I'll try to explain it more clearly, maybe then you will be able to understand. If l were to claim that “just because I'm white doesn 't make any of the many manifestations of racism any less important to me because I have family and friends who are affected by it.” Yes, I could be angry if a black friend is beaten as a result of racism. Or a black step-nephew is treated cruelly by other children. Or if an Asian friend doesn ' t get the job, and they believe it to be because they are not white. I could get angry, it could upset me, I could suffer pain. But I will ALWAYS have the privilege of being white. 1 will NEVER comprehend the many ways that being of colour affects someone's life. No matter how strongly I were take part in anti-racist action or suchlike — / would never really get it. I would never really know. And I think it almost insulting to fight someone else's fight. For example, if I were to write a book on to the racist myths and prejudices that are perpetuated an strengthened within the public school system, as a white person, what would you think? If a man were to write a book on the effects of rape on a woman, what would you think? Do you think he has a right to? Do you think he’cj ever really understand? Do you think that women are not capable of writing the books about themselves for themselves? Do not think that I advocate that white people shouldn 't participate in anti-racist action, or that men are not welcome within the world of women 's rights, for that is NOT what I am claiming [before words are put in my mouth again]. What I am arguing is that people need to know their limits. They’ needs to respect the boundaries, for to say that they do not exist is to belittle them. Is to belittle the experience. To say that a man is affected as deeply by helping his sister recover from being raped is crap. Of course he will have feelings, but it's not about his feelings, it's about hers. Watching someone suffer is painful, yes. But it is never as hard as suffering yourself. “ Sometimes people not directly involved in an action have a better (more objective, that is) comprehension of what's really going on than the person affected.” Oh, right, I see. The woman [hysterical and emotional, like all females] can't see the situation objectively. But the all-knowing man, he understands it all, with his logic and objectivity. Hee hee. Your letter was angry, and mostly consisted of personal attacks upon me. Calling me “ ignorant, arrogant, sexist, self-pityish,” seems a little odd. I wonder why your letter was so pointedly insulting and weird. My comprehension of issues is based upon personal experience. You don 't know me, so to insult me in that manner was very strange. My letter was aimed towards Jonathan Lee as he had written that column. But it was intended towards anyone who thinks the same way. It was intended towards people like you. People who think that ‘reverse-sexism' exists. Whatever. Your personal insults and your lack of a clear argument against the points that I made are clear indicators of other issues present. Whatever your beef with me is, please do not veil it in the guise of political debate next time. If you wish to attack me as a person, have some clear points, some well thought out arguments and some foundation for doing so. Don 't come with third-grade insults and trying to imply that I said things that I didn't. Why is it that when people quote me, they always get it wrong? ■ Well, in. conclusion I would also like to say that in addition to the letter printed here I also received another angry one, along with several that were positive. People seemed to appreciate the anger and the passion that I show when discussing feminist issues. I would like to respond to the other letter writer, Tanner Servoss, who made the point that my letter seemed to skim over the point that men also get beaten and raped. I never intended to belittle ANYONE'S experience. But, I would like to use the above example of racism to illustrate my argument further. There have been examples of white people being beaten by people of colour. But this does not make it irrelevant to talk of the violence that non- white people suffer. It does not mean that the pain that white people suffer when they are beaten is not real. But that the issue here is not individual people's suffering, but the political causes behind it. I hope that clears it up. I would also like to say that it 's funny that this letter seemed most enraged at how ‘arrogant' I am. Hmmm — god forbid a woman should step out of line, eh? Sorry, I forgot, shouldn't speak unless spoken to, even when it's MY issues that are being discussed. Well, you can keep the roles for someone else. I refuse to be labeled by you. Just because a woman talks of the suffering of her gender does not make her self-piteous. This isn't self-pity. This is real life. And this isn't arrogance. This is fighting. — Vique Dear HeartattaCk, A few years back I had this T- shirt that read, “All processes are reversible. I will work beyond my limitations to campaign for what I value.” Seldom does a day now go by that I don’t think of those words. You see, I’m now a teacher. Bishop, California, where I live is rural in every sense of the word. At the base of the mighty Sierra Nevadas, I’m 300 miles from the nearest big city, my school has its own rodeo team, and the town boasts the world’s largest mule powered parade! Many would characterize our many trailer parks as a “white-trash heaven” and the local Paiute Shoshone Reservation as a “graveyard of Indian ambition,” but to do so is to indulge in sanctimony and xenophobia. And for those of you with a late pass, xenophobia means more than fear of the Warrior Princess! In any case, English 12AB — a.k.a. English for the terminally unmotivated — is my child. My students run the gamut from dungeon masters and dirt bike grommets, to a teen-mom-to-be and an aspiring break dancer. A senior year of English is not required of these students and they simply don’t want to be here. In most cases they’ve failed a proficiency exam or been cajoled into registration by our guidance techs. Tenured veterans say to me “bless your heart” when I speak of my students, but for all their surliness these kids are every bit as amazing and inspiring as their college prep counterparts. It’s the urgency of their lives and those rare sparks of connection that make this a paydirt labor of love. There’s another part to it though. When I first began substitute teaching (public education’s most thankless task) it was student’s visible frustration and depression that I immediately empathized with. Now, ten years after hardcore punk helped to redescribe my life, I look at our fascination with alienation in a very different light. Sure, it’s come down to it and I’ve stood alone, but is aloneness really our ideal for living? In my mind, anything I can do to work towards incorporation, to alleviate suffering, and build that ever nebulous sense of community, is worth while. I am getting older but still I yearn for a way to live the dream. Ten years ago that meant, among other things, finding work where I’d never have to tuck my shirt in. I’ve got to ask you, though, is that all hardcore and idealism and revolution mean? Right now I think I’ve found a way to balance my creative and activist needs. Being young, psyched, and passionate about life has enormous merit. Since it looks as if we’re all going to have to work, let’s do the good work. Campaign for what you value. — Martin Roberts/ 184 Running Iron Rd. #5/ Bishop, CA 93514; merzl@qnet.com Hey Collin, hey HaC, I want to write something to your letter in HaC #22, but first sorry for my bad English. I’m from Germoney and I have slept in school. Second, some words to my person. I’m a 29 year old white (of course) male (of course), but I’m not from the upper middle class. I got enough to eat can pay my rent and sometimes I buy some LPs. But now my thinkings to your letter. In the opinion of your (female) friend white men should not scream because they are the winner of sexism. It’s definitely true that white men (for example me) get BIG privileges in this society, but should I (“I” because I do not feel any solidarity with white men even though I am one of them) be happy about it (a rhetorical question)? You are right, screaming is a weapon used by men to dominate wimmin, but it’s not a weapon for that per se. I scream when I feel hurt for example or when I’m angry, or when I fight against something (for example at demonstrations) and in most cases it’s not aggressive against a person, ft’s a way to express emotions like crying or something. A singer can't cry the lyrics. Well, I’m trying to say that screaming doesn’t have to be sexist (but it can). Another point. HC is definitely male (and next to metal the whitest scene and this really sucks, too) dominated and that REALLY sucks. Only a few immigrants, only a few wimmin, only a few homosexuals. But, did you ever go to a f.e. reggae soundsystem? Did you ever listen to their lyrics, look around and see the way a lot of men (not all of course) talk and look to wimmin? You’ll see and hear a lot of sexism/homophobia. I think you cannot say: more wimmin, less sexism. In the society there are 50% wimmin. No sexism? Don’t get me wrong, I think there is a lot of sexism/racism in our (?) scene (and I don’t talk about the macho-scene, you know what I mean). In fact I’m a sexist/racist and I really have to fight against such prejudges in my head (I hope you understand me, I try to fight against my sexism/racism). I think every one of us is a sexist. We live in this sick society and we reproduce it. That’s really weird, but we have to know it. I think THIS is the point to criticize our scene. The members of the hc-scene too often think that they are not reproducing sexism/racism. That is an illusion. We have to reflex ourselves again and again, never feeling safe. This could be the differences to the rest of the society (reflection without changing is, of course, useless). I think things like this sex issue are very important. We have to talk about our mistakes, about our feelings and our -points of view. For example: did you read the letter of “anon” in #22? I do not forget the victim of his rape but I think he did the right thing to try to talk about his BIG mistake and he tries to change himself. Maybe other men reading this will start to think about their doings. (Men, you should read the lines under the lyrics “I wanna tear my clubhouse down, painted thin, small acts of love and rebellion”; if you want I’ll mail them to you) Well, I’ll try to find an end. HC is a bad place to be but I think it’s better to try to change it than to leave it. I think you won’t find a better one (maybe in wimminAesbian-groups). If you find a better place let me know. I wish more people in our scene would point at themselves and not so much to others. Collin maybe you want to answer me (or anybody else). Communication is everything. Take care, — Gene Galaxo; genegalaxo@gmx.de Dear HeartattaCk, I was thinking about the Columbine tragedy and the media’s response to it. Saying that these troubled children were influenced so completely by video games and movies is unforgivably ignorant. With words like, “How a video-game joystick turned Harris into a better marksman” and, “Klebold and Harris were completely soaked in violence: in movies like Reservoir Dogs : in gory video games that they tailored to their imaginations” it’s evident the media is trying to blame these individuals actions on the content of the movies they watched and the video games they played. To take a step back and look at the whole picture shows you that these kids weren’t shooting a school in hopes of emulating their favorite video game hero. Truth be known the problem runs a lot deeper; you’re searching the surface for an easy answer. Perhaps it’s fear, fear to face the ugliness of our society. The fact that in this modem day none of us really have a voice. A voice in what controls and governs our lives. To express ourselves, to be heard. The fact that today we are a society run on news reels and gossip columns. That parents are too busy placing the blame on other outside factors and not owning up to their shortcomings. Not spending time talking with their children. Untold numbers of children play gory video games and watch violent movies. If it’s true that these games are so influential, then we would have a serious epidemic on our hands. Sincerely, — Lukas Symphony; Lukexspook@aol.com Dear HaC! I guess this letter is a bit late, but hey, bear with me... First of all I would like to thank you for providing such an excellent forum for information and discussion within the Hardcore-scene, as HeartattaCk has turned out to be. I have been following the ‘zine since its first issue and even though some friends of mine think otherwise, I think it’s just getting better and better. Especially because of the theme issues that I’ve really been enjoying, though X sadly missed the DIY issue due to traveling. OK, enough sucking up and on to the real deal (well, first a tiny bit of more sucking up): I really enjoyed the article “Crazy On the Inside” by Caroline Hostetler in issue #22 about clinical depression and I agree with major parts of it (the more gender-related parts). But there are a couple of things I’d really like to comment on. First it’s the sentence, “In fact, depression is becoming more common with each generation, and no one is really sure why.” I believe I can say that this is a false statement. Though maybe none of the big mainstream authorities on the subject have found any reasons why (they’re probably way too busy trying to find new ways of treating it and new ways to profit from it to even bother with something as irrelevant as the reasons why), others have. For instance: Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber. Though I strongly disagree with his means to get his message out (blowing people to bits), I do agree with the basic statement in his manifest: Industrial society fucks people up! As Caroline points out, it’s in the western culture that mental illness is most common, and by western culture I presume that she means the “developed” world, consequently there’s not so much depression in the “developing” world. (I’m putting developed and developing in quotation marks because I think the words in the sense they are given here are highly misleading.) Hmmm... There might just be a connection here. And as Sonia, a Greek anarchist friend of mine, pointed out to me when I was visiting her homeland (she didn’t think of Greece as a part of the first world yet): “We’ll know when we’re in the first world on the [increasing] suicide rates.” I think one of the main reasons why people in the western “civilisation” are so depressed is because we’re loosing sight with who’s in charge of our existences. In true primitive societies (to the degree they still exist, not “developing” societies) people still have the feeling of being in charge of their own existence, at least when they aren’t fucked with by multinationals and western civilisation. They go hunting for their own food, build their own houses, and make their own entertainment. We in the “developed” world, however, are losing this feeling of being in charge because we are controlled by other authority-figures incomprehensible needs like meaningless profit or power, not our own easily understandable needs like food, shelter and enjoyment. These needs are basically satisfied without any effort of our own and we spend all our time doing things we are told, not things we truly want, which in my opinion should be the ultimate goal of all individuals. The thing is that an advanced technological society cannot exist if everyone tried to pursue this goal, because an advanced technological society demands specialised training and authority to keep it turning. In most of the “developing” societies people have also lost the feeling of being in charge, but they haven’t got the time to be depressed because technology and imperialism have destroyed their lands. Their existence has been reduced to mere survival and surviving is more difficult than ever before. I also believe that breaking free from the golden materialist shackles of society and living free have to be an ultimate way of dealing with depressions (for those who have the strength). Set goals for yourself and accomplish them for no other reason than the knowledge that this is what you truly want. I would advise people to stay away from the mainstream mind- control drugs as long as possible, as these to me seem to be dangerous weapons in the hands of the authorities which can and will destroy people, just like they always have. Of course medication is needed for the more severe cases of mental illness, but after what I hear the medical industry in the states have just gone loco when it comes to handing out pills to people who are “depressed.” The typical self-help books are, as Caroline states indirectly, just bullshit made for profit. Eating bananas, reading good funny books, talking with friends, creating music, drawing, writing and traveling helped me when I was down, but then again I never had more than light or moderate depression anyway. As Caroline writes, being active is a good way to deal with depression and this is so true, but I don’t think we’ll ever get rid of depression as a problem if we continue to develop our society the way it’s heading now. In the end, depression is just a normal reaction to the fucked up ways of a society gone mad, so it is society we should change, not us with medications and mind- control. We have to follow our own dreams, not the ones forced down our throats by media, capital and governments. This is the way of the revolution! Since I can barely touch upon these subjects in this letter, here are a couple of things that should be read to fully understand what I’m talking about: — “The Last of the Hippies: A Hysterical Romance” in the cover of Christ the Album by Crass... An inspiring and horrific tale of breaking loose, doing what you really want and the dangers of psychiatric medicine and institutions as a tool for those in power. — The Unabomber Manifesto and the 1971 Essay by Ted Kaczynski... About the effects industrial society has on the human psyche, the built in oppression of advanced technology and scientific mind-control. These can be found many places (on the Internet [oh, horror!] for example) but if you can’t get hold of them otherwise, they can also be ordered as cheap good-looking pamphlets/ booklets from The No Release? Co-operative. By the way, as a side-note, what the fuck is EuroCore? As a European I’m really wondering, I think it must be one of the most stupid genre-names I’ve ever heard. Do all European bands sound that much the same? I guess it’s just another invention of the biggest movement in the world: The American Idiot Movement (which you don’t even have to be an American to join!). (Native Americans, take no offense!) And to finish it off, some personal messages: I’m hopefully traveling Mexico and the states this summer so if anyone cool can offer a place to stay, help out with good places to find food, and maybe just hang out and get wasted, I would appreciate it if you got in touch! I’m 21, male, friendly (at least I think so), into brutal revolutionary music, vegan and (obviously) Eco- Anarchist. I would especially appreciate it if experienced train-jumpers got in touch, since I really want to find out about it, and I have no experience from before! Carsten Wyche from Charlotte, NC! Thanks for the Neurosis CD! Tor Andrd and I were going to write you, but Tor fucked it up, so did I and I still feel guilty about it. I have lost your address, so please e- mail me or something and send me your current address, and I will get in touch! Promise!!! Bjorn the Norwegian from Portland! (We hung out at Roskilde ‘98, remember?) I was going to write you too, but I lost your address as well, so please e-mail me! Freedom seeking cheers from, — Kjetil/No Release?/Postboks 58 - Sentrum/N-3 1 10 Tonsberg/Norway; fukkthefukkers@hotmail.com (and I’m a hypocrite too!) Dear HeartattaCk, I truly hate to stir up this can of worms again, but it has been weighing heavily on my mind in the past few days... lo and behold it’s the wonderful topic of... CHRISTIANITY. When I recently attended a hardcore show, I accidentally (unassumingly might be more like it) picked up a copy of this kid’s Christian “hardcore” ‘zine. Well, being a fairly tolerant person, I sat down and tried to give it a read, since I am woefully unaware of this burgeoning “scene.” Well, it stirred up a variety of reactions in me, first and foremost was the obvious feeling of DISGUST. To see someone trying to claim that somehow all of the basic rhetoric of the religious right is PUNK made me infinitely upset. Then I just found it all extremely funny, like it was just another stupid “movement” within the scene that I could blow off, like bad tough-guy, or hardline sXe. This kid was talking about how all puhks are so “uninformed” about Christianity, and how Christians are outsiders both in mainstream society and on the punk scene. He made one good point, that while there is no evidence proving the existence of God, there is also no evidence disproving the existence of God, so therefore one can only base one’s opinions on the topic on faith. He also said that he is constantly being harassed and yelled at by punks and hardcore kids alike, and he even had the gall to equate “Christian bashing” to anti- Semitism, racism and sexism. It was the standard “white males are becoming a minority” type bullshit, which has had me up in arms recently. And then, of course, there was the wonderful, poorly supported article about how vegetarians who are pro-choice are somehow hypocritical. Go figure. Truth be told, it struck a very deep nerve with me, and I found myself in a tizzy for a solid 24 hours afterward. I wanted to kill this ignoramus, not only for being DEAD FUCKING WRONG, but for being so arrogant, and for fancying himself such a martyr because kids in the scene didn’t have the wherewithal to confront this shit in a intelligent manner. And here is where the problem lies, the problem that kept me awake until three thirty last night when I had a nine o’clock class: When you take a militant atheist attitude and you have no logic to back it up, when you resort to calling Christians names like Hypocritical fucks and ignorami, YOU ARE PLAYING THEIR GAME! ! ! As punks and HC kids, generally with good brains in our heads, we MUST confront this ridiculous attitude in an INTELLIGENT manner. The more we rant and rave about God not existing and how Christians are responsible for so many of the problems in this world, and the more we call them names, the stronger THEY get, and the more we enforce their little “poor Christianity is under siege by minorities and the liberal media” delusions. These delusions must be destroyed, and there is only one way to do so: START OPEN DIALOGUE with kids who do Christian “punk” ‘zines, and play in Christian “punk” bands, and be constructive and intelligent. Start by re-evaluating every belief that you hold dear, such as why women should have the right to choose, and why gays and lesbians should have the right, not only to marry, but to walk safely down the streets and to BE THEMSELVES without being persecuted. Take these beliefs and deconstruct them, strip them down to their most basic elements, and construct your case from there. We need to inform ourselves about Christianity, and about what is wrong (and maybe what is right also) about it, and we need to show that THEY are the ones who base their beliefs on ignorance and intolerance, not us. Get educated, and try to understand that it is NOT the teachings of Jesus or the belief in God that harms women and gays in and of itself, but it is the right wing DOCTRINES that those who subscribe to these beliefs tend to hold that are harmful, selfish, and just plain hypocritical. Someone declaring their faith in God never hurt anybody, and in fact it may do many people some good, but someone claiming that GAYS are going to hell and women are second class citizens because some asshole thousands of years decided to write it down on a piece of paper IS harming millions of people with every word he spews forth, whether it is in the pulpit or on TV or just at home with his little “family values” family.

Feel free to get in touch. — Alex Merrill/1000 Irving Ave. Box 306/ Syracuse, NY 13210; Xcolorfast@yahoo.com He art attaCk, W hen I was younger I felt free to tell anyone anything that was on my mind. I was a pretty uninhibited kid; later on, though, I discovered the worlds of organized sports (rather I was forced into) and junior high school. Needless to say I learned to shut up. Somewhere along the way I started blabbering again, mostly just to my parents and my brother, asking questions, telling them my dreams and frustrations. Very typical naive, innocent, adolescent stuff. I remember being frustrated with things like the environment, lack of compassion, drug use with my friends, cynicism, etc. It was hard on for me to articulate these frustrations to friends at school; we were never very close and they seemed more interested in getting high and drinking. Maybe I was too scared to approach them — I don’t know. Regardless, I felt like the only people I could express myself to (albeit in a limited way) was my family. I remember letting them know how upset I was about the way in which the world was being changed (such a nice word as compared to destroyed or killed) without any input from us. I was pissed at the way fields were being paved over with roads which led only to malls, where we could buy a bunch of crap we were tricked into believing we needed. I was pissed that the natural beauty of the world was slowly shrinking away. I told my parents all of this, ideas that I thought no one had ever conceived before, and I was told that I was silly. I got a patronizing smile and a pat on the head. They figured I’d grow out of it. It was their joke for the next couple of weeks. That was the last time I ever talked to my parents about anything that was truly frustrating me. It was the last that I told them what was truly going on in my life. For a while after this I felt like I was the only who felt this way, the only kid who cared and cried and couldn’t talk to anyone about it. Somehow I got a hold of a dub of a Minor Threat tape and some Operation Ivy songs. I started hearing music made by kids just as fucked up as me. These kids were 8 and 12 years away, but still it was comforting to hear that at least someone (had) understood. I always had a hard time vocalising these feelings. Most of the music being played at shows that I went to was shoe gazer indie stuff — no intensity, no urgency, little emotion, no connection. There was very little I could relate to. A few years later and I’m further away from that scene and that music, but still I find it hard to vocalise what I’m feeling. People, kids who I’m sure are just as fucked up, lost and confused as me, act just like my parents. They say things to shut people up and make them feel stupid about expressing themselves. Is this what hardcore and punk is all about now? Shouts of “shut up and play,” PC branding and witch-hunting because someone decides to show compassion, making a point of not caring, calling strong women bitches and sluts? Is this what I longed to belong to? To be a part of? I hope not. But there are beautiful glimmers of hope. There’s that band that sings about how great a person you are, there’s that kid who tells you that he appreciates what you have to say even though no one else wanted to listen, there’s that friend who encourages me to write and share my writing with others, there’s that woman who still goes to shows and looks them right in the eye after they’ve called her a skank. These are people who are actually real, they’re just as messed up as you and I and they understand and admit it. They need a hand, like you or I, so that they won’t feel so scared when they speak up. We need encouragement and discourse, not snide comments and clever insults. Thanks, ’ — Mark Black/5599 Fenwick St. Apt 1206/ Halifax, NS/B3H 1R2/Canada; blastedlife@hotmail.com (more reliable than snail mail as I’ll be moving in April 2000) Dear Lisa, Leslie, Kent & Co., I just wanted to applaud your efforts on the Women’s issues erf HeartattaCk. You gals (and guys) did a really nice job putting it all together and I enjoyed most of the contributions. I must, however, express my grave fembarrassment about my column. I just want the readers to know that I wrote that shit about a year ago, and I don’t really know what the hell I was rambling about.. I guess I had a lot of anger at the time, but because of situations I was in, it was misdirected. So anyway, for anyone who thought I was a wingnut and also a very bad writer, please forgive my lapse in character. — Emily Greenwalt PS. I really do know a lot of cool and active girls, and I am not on my woe-is-me trip anymore. J; ,. Hi! AT y best letters are written as I -lVI wa lk around town, hurrying f rom one place to another, thinking of jMgSK'. I2S l ^ e P eo Pl e I have to call and things I still have to do. The soundtrack to the % *0-7 rhythm of my steps is in the sound of 0 010 words that keep coming out in WmM,, unpredictable sentences, sometimes with logic, sometimes with feeling. The logic tells me I can never reproduce that mind-letter here, the feeling tells me I can try. (I am soon going to invent this special wire connection, from my brain to a tiny portable keyboard that will note down everything there is to be told.) Right now I am left with the feeling. I am going to address both Women’s Issues here, as seen from different perspectives — those that I can acquire. The scared self-conscious girl in me says THANK YOU for offering space to more girls. Their public exposure has made them vulnerable but they are, in fact, much stronger now. A world of other girls was hoping one of them would finally step out of the shadow and tell her truth. It doesn’t matter whether I agree with her or not — or if you do, the significance of her exposure goes beyond differences of opinion. Opinion can change with the wind; experience on the other hand and one’s past do not. The girls who contributed to the Women’s Issues have told their experiences. And offered help to those who dare not to — yet. I am somewhere half-way to say my right. Someone might appreciate my little exposure so I will and want to continue. Because quantity of opinions expressed is empowering. Who was it, a band, who sang: strength of the oppressed is in their number. When you speak out, you teach me how to read and listen, each time all over again. Perhaps • ? there is a balance somewhere, then. The other girl in me, proud of what she had done with her life so far, is offended. When HaC offers to do a special Women’s Issue, the magazines’ editors act patronising towards the women who contribute (like they can’t create their own media!) and sexist towards the men who feel “reversely discriminated” because of the exclusive nature of these two HaC issues. The problem is not the exclusion of men itself — problematic is the exclusion of diversity of opinion which is, whether you like it or not, often built on one’s gender identity. Previous readers’ responses to the Women’s Issues were adopting this attitude, saying such a thematic issue was unnecessary — perhaps exactly because it reduced women to just an issue, a theme, a field for discussion where there was a wrong or right. HaC offered an illusion, of equal opportunity which is non-existent as long as woman’s starting point in society differs from man’s. Equal rights have a contradictory starting point: if the majority (i.e. men) and the minority (i.e. women) wish to co-exist in a media, the only way to achieve long-term balance is in encouragement of the minority to take active part in that media, also with beneficial treatment of the minority. Their presence can change that very media. I can’t foresee the following issues of HaC, but admitting to the standard configuration of male-dominated contributions (including band photos!) would somehow confirm the illusion of equal opportunity. If you think the media — be it punk or mainstream — reflects the social reality of today, think again. What if the media defines reality? What makes a band cool? Some ‘zine’s opinion, often. On a larger and more important scale, who made the (December ‘99) protesters against the liberalisation of WTO in Seattle look ridiculous? CNN. I can assure you that most national and commercial news TV stations around the world simply translated CNN’s reports to their language. In Slovenia, the protesters were marked as “criminals” in the biggest liberal daily Delo. What can I do about it? Define my own reality, I guess. Go to the Delo headquarters in Ljubljana and bum a copy of the daily right there. Talk to the journalists. Tell what we think the WTO deal is really about. We did it, and next day, the newspaper published our accusations of their subjective and partial reports. I believe we created balance — offered another option. Hopefully, this example clarifies my point. It’s important to speak out. Face your opposition and try to understand the differences. Talking of men and women, I do believe there’s balance. There’s one more thing that bothered me. I noticed that a lot of people — regardless of their gender — think that “making it” in the scene is essential. That it’s very important to step out of the shadow and become recognised in the scene. The wish for recognition is automatically understood as the only way to actively approach the scene and oneself. I think it’s bullshit; it’s the way the mainstream society works. Why? Because when you say you want to be recognised you assume two things: 1) Recognition is given by those who’ve already “made it” in the scene, meaning that their activity has given them authority (even if they didn’t ask for it), a position from where you see them as authority. Your wish to be recognised implies you (will) look down upon people who are happy with coming to a show instead of organising one, or who prefer reading a ‘zine to writing one. 2) This authority (often unintentionally) defines the “rules of the game” and you accept them, of course — if you don’t then there’s nobody to recognise you as a vital part of the scene! This sort of behaviour does not make hardcore and punk an alternative to anything. It seems our “subcultures” are more likely a kindergarten for those who want to be trained for their future career ambitions when they “grow up.” To apply this theory to our discussion of gender imbalance in HC: just because someone struggling to.be respected and recognised (i.e. gain a position of authority) is female, it doesn’t apologise this attitude or make it different from a male yuppie. Is it utopic to expect people to tell what they think without the* unnecessary self-promoting “I own the truth” attitude? Does your opinion about me change if I tell you I do a ‘zine? Or if I tell you I am a girl? It shouldn’t. The very wish to be part of something does not necessarily involve my active contribution. And when it does, I don’t have to be accepted or rejected due to someone else’s norm. There are alternatives, and one is in finding recognition within yourself. The rest will follow automatically. The subject addressed as History in schools should be entitled History of Men (who want to be) in Power and taken for what it is. It was men who played the main parts in history and it was men who documented it. Tradition has a penis. Well, had one. Everyone who speaks out without wanting to dominate the discussion, contributes to her or his representation in/of reality so that truth is no longer male; it is human. And history is becoming more human each time a woman tells her side of story as well. 1 am ready. — Tea Hvala/Slovenska 31/5281 Sp. Idrija / Slovenia; verjamem@hotmail.com ' HeartattaCk, m - ■ \\ oWJj- TTeartattaCk has been one of the ' f * very (few) magazines that is able to put forth ideas, exchange information, and in effect, also create llpj; * Am' change. It is extremely admirable to see so man y P e °P le write in on \" ' ‘ subjects in their lives that seem to hit so close to home. And because of this fact 1 feel quite comfortable in engaging in highly sensitive topics that seem to be the strongest bridges that connects and inspires each of us. In the last issue of HeartattaCk a remarkably intelligent woman by the name of Molly Caldwell wrote in to voice her opinion on how the hardcore scene seemed to pick on Christianity and that more times than not, hardcore ideals seemed to walk parallel to Christian doctrine. She gave the Jesus Christ figure a rebel-like stance and pointed out specific scriptural references that she claimed were that of a revolutionary. However, it is also apparent to me to me that her claims also echo of “blanket” statements. Molly tends to disregard sexism, prejudice and ignorance as not part of Christian doctrine. She gave the Jesus Christ figure a rebel-like stance and pointed out specific scriptural references that she claimed were that of a revolutionary. However, it is also apparent to me that her claims also echo of “blanket statements.” Molly tends to disregard sexism, prejudice and ignorance as not part of Christian doctrine, when in fact this particular religion has been the number one champion of shedding blood, oppressing women and tyranny of the human mind. It is certainly commendable that Molly has her own view of what Christianity is, but it should be said that each person and/or church uses the gospel for their/his/her own preservation. If we take a look, even a quick glance, at the Ku Klux Klan. They support their beliefs with certain scriptures in order to feel justified in their exploits. Not to compare Molly to such needless stupidity of the Ku Klux Klan, but she does tend to look at the scriptures that put the Jesus character in a good light, and ignores the scriptures that show his stupidity, selfishness and cowardice. As we follow along, we also find that Molly’s basis for Jesus as a social activist turns out to be somewhat hollow and naive. One of the few things that has kept Christianity at the forefront of recruiting believers and keeping them is its promise of everlasting punishment, and the Jesus character promoted this idea vigorously. It would be ridiculous to call a man compassionate or morally sound if he believed in an everlasting fire for people who honestly doubted his divinity (John 15:6). It does little good to pretend that Jesus was out to make the world a better place; he came to foretell the ending of it. Now, if we feign acceptance of this pessimistic view of life, there is no longer any need to love your neighbor, help the poor or perpetuate the betterment of humanity, because the world is ending. And with the intent of the belief in original sin, we are destined to fail in saving our earthly home. We only need to be concerned with our afterlife and let this blind, deaf and mute deity, take care of the rest. Furthermore, it should be asked if Armageddon is a peaceful idea? Is it exemplary for Jesus to make his point with threats of eternal punishment (Matt 13:41-42)? Molly also claims that verses the radical right use to. justify their insanity were not stated by Jesus, but by the men who wrote the bible (assuming that they were all men). But in all actuality, all statements in the bible were written by other authors, ala hearsay. There is no evidence to suggest that Jesus ever wrought down his own teachings or if he even existed at all. It is completely childish to play hot potato with the havoc that the followers of Christianity have wreaked upon the world and have left so much destruction in their wake. This “moral” and allegedly socially aware character attacked merchants with a whip (John 2:15), drowned innocent animals (Matt 8:32), did not come to send peace but a sword (Matt 10:34), was out to turn family members against one another (Luke 14:26, Matt 10:35-36), and encouraged the beating of slaves (12:47). As for the “love thy neighbor as thyself’ on the Sermon of the Mount, this is merely xeroxed from earlier fables and philosophers (Hillel, Buddha Gautama, Taoism, Zoroastrism, etc.). Now, whether Molly chooses to ignore these scriptures or try to come up with elaborate but intrinsically futile apologetics, she seems to be unaware that if you disregard and rope off one doctrine to Christianity (fundamentalists are quite aware of this hence anti-evolution; i.e. creationism), what stops you from laying waste to all the others, including the ones you hold so dear? If you simply omit the verses you do not agree with and you felt were just discrepancies or fables, what happens to the Christian Deities (God, Yahweh, Jehovah, Elohim, etc.) infallible word? Is the resurrection just a metaphor? Was the earth created in six 24 hour days? Is there such a thing as a fatherless childbirth? Christianity is no longer Christianity without sin, hellfire, a messiah, infallible doctrine, and miracles. The doctrines soon transform into a pick-what-suits- you-best philosophy, which might as well be some form of vague spirituality. This is forcefully backed by Molly’s liberal view of conviction, and it seems to be encouraged that what ever you feel -is-right will lead to divine satisfaction. Sadly, with such a view the whole basis of one’s faith is demolished. When one says that a certain religion is no better than any other, then for what reasons do you follow yours? If one is a Christian, Buddhist, Moslem, or Hindu, it makes no sense to claim that all religions are equal to one another because it dispenses with the absolute necessity for said god or salvation. It annihilates the plan of said religion and gives the individual the choice of whether to believe in a religion, based on preference, or do without it. There must be reasons for believing in such and such a doctrine, for if there is not, you have snuffed out the very belief you base all others on. Another question that should be raised is that if some of Jesus’ teachings are good, should we follow them simply because he said so and we fear retribution, or because of their own reasons? If it is simply because he said so, we fall into the idea that might makes right or basically that the same follower who blindly follows the commandment to love, will just as eagerly follow the commandment to hate. If it is for reasons of their own, this Jesus Christ figure is merely subjecting himself to a higher authority; in fact why don't we just circumvent this figure and go to the source itself (reason, evidence)? Speaking as an ex-Christian, I do see the desire to do good and help others, but for me to do them simply because I fear punishment, is an absolute mockery, not only to my on ethical standpoint, but to those that I lend my strength to. Within the goal of Christianity, one must “die to one’s self in order to be born again in Christ,” and with such a submissive attitude, it is the death of all individual aspiration and merit. And these are the reasons why I can’t accept the weak assertion that Christianity has anything to do with hardcore. Punk rock and hardcore are self- sufficient, autonomous and strong enough to stand on their own two feet. As capable, valuable, thinking human beings, we can change the world without cold, rigid, absolute, moral guidelines imposed with illusions of a reward in a hereafter. Instead of looking up to these allegedly perfect beings who, in all evidence have done nothing to change the world, shouldn’t we emulate real flesh and blood human beings who have actually alleviated suffering, fought against mjustice and gave their lives for the preservation of liberty? Is this not more realistic? Is this not more noble? Is this not more inspiring? I also find that there is no particular “hate” for the Christian but more for the ideology itself, for hardcore has always been about changing the status quo, smashing societal norms and freeing those who would otherwise be oppressed. Also it should be noted that when Molly was clapping at the shows to Christianity’s criticism, I was not. Not because I didn’t necessarily agree, but because not enough was being said. It is also by Molly’s own statement that she has answered her own question of why hardcore on the whole detests religious ideology. By her own admonishment, it is because that it is and has been the most oppressive force in all of history, and it would seem that the hardcore community has always had the duty to battle such tyranny as we have battled sexism, racism and animal exploitation. Alex Me rill, who also wrote in to the last issue, made an excellent point by stating that we need to reevaluate why we believe (or don’t believe) in certain mindsets or ideals, but not only that, open a dialogue to people who don’t necessarily see the world through our eyes. Even if one despises Christianity to the depth of their being, it is still much better to discuss the topic of the day than to push him/her away, close your mind, and further slow down the progression of learning. Ideally, we need to create a community where even though we may oppose and work against a particular belief (in this case Christianity), that we may still be secure enough to respect and love those who carry it as their torch. I’ve seen and have listened to a great deal of overtly atheistic hardcore bands (Harvest, Chalkline, Driven, Chokehold, Catharsis, Tom Apart) that have had some ofthe nicest band members that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. But this goes just as equally for bands that adhere to the Christian faith (Zao, Embodyment, Disciple, Strongarm) and whom I still respect immensely. My intent was not to necessarily counter Molly’s letter, but more to shed light on a subject that many people are ill-informed about. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there are any questions you’d like to discuss or even debate; I am always interested. But also, more importantly, if you are interested in critiques of religion, free thought, atheism, agnosticism, church-state separation, books, pamphlets and stickers, there is this great organization called the Freedom From Religion Foundation who work to such positive ends.

Me and a couple of friends hanging out at a local diner. There was this table of girls sitting a table away drinking and being merry. One of my friends knew one of them so we started talking. After about three hours, they asked us if we could drive their cars to their houses due to the fact that they were to drunk to drive. We said OK. We then escorted them to their homes and hung out there for a little while. While we were hanging out, one of the girls seemed to show interest in me. She started sitting real close and nibbling my ear. I was into it since, at that time in my life, I was not afraid of hooking up with people. Over the course of a few hours, we got closer and closer. Some of the people had gone to bed in the other room and one of my friends had laid down on the couch. At this point me and the girl had gone to bed in her bed. This is where things get hairy. We started fooling around and before I knew it, she had taken off my clothes and me hers. Things got heated and she told me to stop. Not to stop fooling around, but to ask my friend to leave the room. I said OK. I then did so. He didn’t seem too thrilled about it, but he left. I got into bed and things started happening again. At this point, I asked her if this was what she wanted. I asked her this question three times. She said yes every time. So we did what grown people do. No need for details. One detail will come up later, though. I didn’t have a condom. Due to this fact, I didn’t allow myself to come. I don’t need that in my life and neither did the girl. At about six o’clock in the morning, I left. I had to work in a couple of hours so I went home to change and shower. At about three o’clock in the afternoon, my friend comes in yelling at me (I was off work and asleep on the couch). I awake to the news that the girl was pissed off at me and wanted to talk to me. I got my shoes on and proceeded to go over there. When I got there she yelled about how stupid I was and how I put her in a fucked up situation (the condom thing). I agreed with her in that I made a mistake letting it get that far. That without a condom, it should not have been that far. She said she hated me, which I understood, and I left. About three weeks later, my friend comes in and gives me the worse news I have ever received. He said that the girl was telling her friends the I had raped her. Being as anti -rape as one can be (I endorse the castration of rapists), I was completely shocked. I did not know what to say, and to this day, I still don’t. I also found out that her boyfriend (she was also with this guy when we hooked up later found out) was out looking for me. Now, six months later, I am unable to enter three of the top diners in this city (she either works or is always in then). I have lost friendships and my sanity at some points because of this one lie. Because of her attempt to save face in her boyfriend’s eye, I have been made to suffer. Because of her inability to deal with what she did, she belittles every friend of mine who has been r^ped. I know people are going to read this and think that I am trying to attack women. That couldn’t be further from the truth. It is an attack on all the bullshit that people try to get away with. If you would like to talk to me about this in more detail, you can write me at Jason Steed/PO Box 4909/Richmond, VA 23220; tristatekillingspree@hotmail.com. And if you plan on sending me hate mail or putting me on some list for the most hated in the hardcore scene, don’t bother. It won’t be worth your time.* Dear HaC, I n a sense this letter is an epitaph to Tucson, Arizona, my birthplace and childhood stomping grounds. You see, my city is dying. Slowly being choked out by pink stuccoed subdivisions, shopping malls, and Wal-Marts. was once a magical place — with beautiful weather and a small town atmosphere, you couldn ’t ask for more. Our downtown area has remained relatively untouched since the early 1920s. I have an old black and white photo of my great grandfather and my aunts peeking in a storefront that still stands today. There is something in the air that is the closest thing to spirituality that I have ever found. Areas such as this are in danger. In a city that has seen the likes of such rebellious youth as Jack Kerouac and John Dillinger, the “kids” in this city have been labeled the enemy. The fact is that the power has fallen in to the hands of big money developers and the hordes of senior citizens that are raping our city’s natural beauty as well as the mystical aura that once surrounded it. In a city that is willing to spend millions of dollars on golf courses and aquariums, the city has offered little to no funding for youth oriented programs. It has taken years for us to make breakthroughs via legislation in regards to the Skrappy ’s Youth Community Arts Center, our venue for shows and artistic output. In that time frame our town council has passed taken endless measures to make developers feel at home they have made our cities youth feel as though we are unwelcome here. With the exception of Kathy and Bill Woleridge, a couple that has given their lives to the kids and this project, we would have no voice. As a middle class white male this may be the only time in my life where I am truly a minority, yet I can never forget the feeling of hopelessness that accompanies it. Our city’s greed is killing its spirit, and my dream and future in this town. I never wanted to be that kid that always bitched about how “I hate this place.” I’m not that kid yet and hope I won’t ever be, but I am no longer going to be a silent witness. I am going to do all I can to reverse the damage inflicted on my home and I hope that the rest of my city’s youth will not be so complacent as to sit by and watch this town die. — Bob Purvis/16950 N Lago Del Oro/ Tucson, AZ 85739; KilltheRobots@aol.com HeartattaCk , I t is another example of how the media diverts people from questioning and thinking about the ethics of their government. Millions imbibe the media’s coverage of the WTO protest without a second thought of its validity. How much longer will the process of diversion and manipulation continue? I see red when I see the media presenting cops beating the shit out of people like it is a football game. My heart throbs in anger when I think about the media’s focus on a destructive minority of 30 people out of 30,000+ non-violent protesters. The media gives the protesters labels like “environmentalists,” “laborers,” and “anarchists” with negative connotations. It is bullshit when the media fails to present an unbiased view of the concerns and ideas of its people. Why does this degradation of life continue? What influence does an “individual” have in this fucked system of greed? My anger turns into depression the more I think about it. I cry in horror. I am dying for the writings of your thoughts on such matters. — Patrick Scardo/PO Box 248/Clintwood, VA 24228/USA Hi Kent... I just picked up a copy of issue #24, read through your introduction, and felt compelled to drop you a line. I’ve been “on the scene” or whatever you want to call it for almost ten years now and I feel pretty alienated myself. I used to go to shows and thought that I was a part of something special and amongst free- thinking individuals. But instead, I see a bunch of morons that are only in this movement for the thrill of the moment. Bands like Los Crudos and My Lai get the “less talk, more rock” treatment for trying to enlighten these so-called “punks” that there is in fact a message along with the fast music. The whole “party time” mentality of most punks is a total turnoff. The guy wearing a Spitboy shirt while getting some girl drunk in order to take advantage. The hip, happening Oakland scenester showing up at all the “cool” shows trying to schmooze in on the guest list because he’s too good to pay. The tough guy HC kids who applaud the messages of unity and togetherness and turn around and throw punches in the pit. The asshole crustys that try to rush the door in a drunken frenzy and start so much shit that the show almost gets shut down. The big-haired punk kids wearing Crass back-patches while utilizing the most apathetic attitudes and talking shit about “PC faggots.” I fully agree that most of what is referred to as “hardcore” or “punk” really has no content for the most part. Lyrics can be very inspiring, as you pointed out in your column, but how the hell could anyone be inspired to think and possibly change themselves for the better when the lyrics for most H C/punk bands are complete gobbedlygook? Turn on the six o’clock news or read your local paper and you’ll see exactly how much of a downward spiral the world is in. The rich are taking over the Bay Area at an alarming rate and making it very hard for anyone else to afford to live here. The cops pay no mind to someone getting beaten and robbed as they arrest some eighteen-year-old homeless kid on warrants for sleeping outside. If you plan on voting for the presidency, you have a choice between a conservative cokehead asshole or a complete mental midget who would love to censor any form of music found “objectionable” lyrically or image-wise. A prominent Berkeley landlord that owns over a thousand apartment buildings in the area is being brought up on charges having to do with his operating a prostitution ring involving underage girls being imported like cattle from his native country. Yet, the standard punk band sings about nothing in particular. I write a lot of lyrics and tried like hell to start a punk band. My vision of sorts was to put together a band that would hopefully embody everything that was good about hardcore. Angry lyrics, fast music, plus blast beats, breakdowns, the whole nine. You know how Disassociate is basically the most complete hardcore band? Sort of like that. Problem is, nobody around here that I know wanted to do that. I had so much trouble finding a fucking drummer. One guy wanted to be in a death metal band, another just wanted to sit around and do nothing with his time. Another guy turned out to be a total alcoholic flaky ass loser. Out of frustration, I wound up making the decision to sing in a black metal band that some friends of mine started up. Don’t worry too much, though, I’m so incapable* of writing the moronic and/or esoteric lyrics that most metal bands write. We actually have a message, albeit one of negativity! And for those of you that write off BM as nothing more than “Nazi music,” I just wrote a song for our band called “Anti-Racist Black Metal,” so there. I really don’t get very excited about most bands these days. Not the bands of old, like Black Flag, MDC, DK’s, DRI, etc. More like bands from the past decade. Out of the bands that have come out in recent years, I can say that I still get a charge out of Dystopia, Time In Malta, What Happens Next, the Pist, Destroy (and Code 13; thank you, Felix), Noothgrush, and Kung Fu Rick. Most of these bands have angry lyrics that are written in a to-the-point fashion. I also had the opportunity to meet Greg and Ken from Trial, and they both are awesome thinking kind of people. It really sucks when Greg’s up on stage trying to explain a song that takes an anti-rape status and gets the “shut up and play” treatment from all of these sXe kids wearing their “Go Vegan!” and ALF shirts. I also had fun hanging out with members of Axiom and Kung Fu Rick after their Gilman .show last year, listening to “Seven Churches” by Possessed and talking about the state of the scene. It was awesome seeing Axiom’s guitarist introducing their set by soloing with the theme from “Halloween” one minute and talking about the war in Iraq the next. Kent, I fully understand your frustrations. But at least you are a contributor to the scene, unlike many who are content only to sit back and whine. I book shows myself and am always keeping my fingers crossed that people don’t act like assholes and thus make me look like one to the rest of the club. I like to think that I’m making a difference, giving opportunities for good HC bands to shine, and maybe enlightening some people in the process. Realistically, nobody gives a shit and I have people angry at me because I won’t book their shitty sexist and homophobic wanna-be “grindcore” band. In the end, all I can say to myself is that I’m at least trying to do something productive and get something out of all of this. If all you fuckheads want to do is rock out, then go see the latest shitty Murder City Devils rip-off or beat people up to the tune of Korn or Limp Bizkit. You’re not needed. I honestly don’t think anyone’s going to change their mind after reading this, I just felt like venting. Plus, on a more humorous note, I’ve been reading this ‘zine practically since it began and never sent a letter in until now! I hate you all and I wish you were dead... — Loki; konstantflow@yahoo.com P.S. FUCK the popularity contests too! Is it not IRONIC to see one group of so-called “freaks” alienating another group of freaks for not fitting in to their social circle? Dear HeartattaCk , I recently visited my friend in Minneapolis, Minnesota for the weekend and had the chance to go to a show while there. The exact date and the names of the bands matter little to my observations. Anyway, this show look piace m a posn, hip bar near the downtown area, of course why was there a punk/hardcore show taking place here? I guess someone who worked there or knew someone there pulled some strings to get the show going. Pretty cool, to say the least. So anyway, I showed up, paid before the bar, walked through the bar area and into the room where the stage was set up and a band already playing. Needless to say the place was packed with punk rockers! The Twin Cities appears to have a large number of punks (or possibly lots of people traveling in. for shows). However, what was not a pleasant surprise to me was how many were drinking and smoking — just like the yuppie, bar hipsters were doing in the next room over. Already I’d seen bottles littered and left about the show room and the air was a thick cloud of cigarette exhaust. Is this the rebellious lifestyle of punk? Is this making punk a threat? Yes, I’m drug-free. Whether I use the term “straight-edge” to describe myself doesn’t matter. But when I go to a punk show and see people spending their money (probably from some slave- wage job) to pay for alcohol produced my money-grubbing corporations, I get really frustrated. When I have to stand around with my eyes getting stuffy and bloodshot from all the smoke and spend the next couple days coughing up phlegm, it makes me not want to go to shows. I see what alcohol does to people. And when you feel like you are the only one not drinking (and I’m sure there were others) it feels alienating to be around those people. Their behaviors change noticeably and they act different. Alcohol and cigarettes does really seem to be “cool” in some parts of punk rock, not to mention the bar culture. It also makes people much more likely to get into car accidents and do things that they wouldn't normally do, not in any positive way. For those punk drinkers who have themselves “under control,” there really is no escaping liver damage and dead brain cells. Even if drinking and smoking is seen as a “personal choice,” what can we say to the people killed in drunk- driving accidents? What about all those dogs force-fed liquor and smoke inhalation in some laboratory hired out by Budweiser or Phillip Morris? Do we not financially and tacitly give this support? Sure, beer helps to take the stress out of the day. Helps us to wind down from another irritating day at our shitty jobs. Hell, it’s a social thing. We’re punk. We look dirty, have patches, pierce our bodies, and... drink — just like the room next to us in the bar. The alcohol corporations don’t give a fuck if you are a punk. Your sale is just as good as another. So while we try to offer something better than the mainstream, a place where we can challenge conventional institutions and norms, we can’t just change our appearance and listen to angry music and be done with it. Allowing ourselves to consume the poisons (is that too loaded a word for liver damage?) the corporations sell to us is partaking in THEIR system. The same one that co-ops creative and/or angry music and commodifies it. The same one which sells womyn’s bodies on their fucking beer and cigarette ads instead of advertising the catch: alcoholics, pacification of the First Nations, cash crops vs. native wildlife, etc. The same system which is pushing the Marlboro Man in SE Asia. Hooray for corporate Amerikka pushing monoculture and neo-colonialism worldwide! So next time we claim punk as a threat while taking a sip of alcohol or a drag off a cigarette, ask what we’re\" really a threat to. What alternative example are we making of ourselves if we exclude certain aspects of our lifestyle? Rebellion in style but not in substance? There’s nothing cool about being slave to addiction and dependence. The real threat lies in our resistance to it. — Nick Stillman; nickSJ002@yahoo.com Hello everybody, I ’m Damiano from Italy! This is not meant to be a blame of Ebullition or HaC at all, but just my opinion, a means to arouse discussion and communication, which I think are among the most important skills... 1 think we must be careful in despising the capitalistic system we live in, because we can do this all only thanks to it... I mean, we can live this way thanks to it, which allows us (especially you out there) to just work a few hours or not even work, because you can pay the bills, which are not that high... as the capitalistic system is lowering them more and more. We can just talk about sXe, emo, veganism and that sort of thing, as we don’t have the need to look for food or a shelter. We are not worried about having to search for food, we are not starving... so we are allowed by this system, to be the way we are — because hc-punk could never exist where people are starving. I mean, it’s so good that we care about them and the environment and animals, because we’re just trying to change our little world for the better, but I think we don’t have to forget that this system keeps us alive. Don’t get me wrong, I know I’m becoming so unpopular, but this is what 1 think... I’m not for it at all, but I'm just recognizing some real things. We despise a system that allows us to do more and more — something other than just working, and have more and more leisure time... especially you out in the States can’t understand that life is a bit harder when you have high phone bills, freeway tolls to pay, very expensive gas, more expensive records, and these sorts of things. So, it’s easy talking about doing something positive for this society, but it also depends on how much leisure time you have and it also depends on money. I know that it sucks, but it’s real! I don’t know if I’m making this point clear. It’s also about having a record label and those kinds of things... why do you think there are a lot of them in the US and less in Europe and very few in the rest of the world??? It’s not because non- Americans are not good at it, it’s just because in many other parts of the world they can’t care about having a guitar or printing a paper or having a website... they have to worry about elementary needs, or they don’t have spare money to spend, or it’s not that easy to do a record, travel or print anything. I mean, I do dislike greedyness and career and that sort of thing. I’m much closer ideologically to socialism/communism and that way of thinking, but I guess it proved to be wrong — well, maybe not wrong, but it didn’t work for so many people. It couldn’t make so many people happy, while capitalism seems to, or just pretend to (I realize it’s much about brainwashing...). I think we must be well aware when we blame it, because it allows us to... and then I don’t like the way things work in this so called hc-punk world — which maybe should be about providing an alternative to the “real” world... it sucks that it’s all about the States, all about American bands putting out records and touring Europe and making a lot of money by that. It’s just a one-way relationship, because there are too few European bands doing the opposite (recently, because until a couple of years ago there were mostly none...). It’s too much focused on the States, as the outer world is... MTV is doing that too, globalizing the world as much as possible by eliminating languages and cultures... and that’s true with many English-native speakers (I hate generalizations though ). You don’t even wonder that we can’t speak English as good as you do... there are so many wonderful languages in the world... it’s not all about English. You don’t seem to realize that, you just expect that we understand you while you’re talking as you would with an English-native speaker... you don’t realize that we have been trying to understand you while you don’t do the same with us! ! ! Ok, I hope I haven’t bored you, and I guess I aroused enough critics and discussion with this. I'd be really glad to hear opinions, comments, and anyone’s point of view. I really hope to hear from you all soon. I’m always on my search for new friends and penpals, so please help me out and write me NOW! ! ! Take care and have a nice day ! ! ! - — Damiano Bonuomo/Via Ca’ Bruciata del pellegrino 1/42016 Guastalla (RE)/Italy; xdambox@libero.it Hello all HeartattaCk readers! I ’m writing this as a warning for those of you who are generous enough to let travelers stay in your homes. Not too long ago, I was at the last Devoid of Faith show and I met three travelling punks (a guy named Shamus, a girl named Alex, and a guy named Stu) who were hard up for a place to stay. Having been in their position many times before, my girlfriend and I offered them a place in our apartment for a few days, despite the fact that it would be a little crowded since a touring band was also sleeping there as well. Shamus, Alex and Stu were all very grateful, gave us some food to help feed everyone with, and were generally nice people. My band was playing several shows that weekend, one of them was out of town, and since they didn’t have much gas and didn’t want to leave town with us, I left them alone in my apartment, simply saying, “Just lock up if you leave.” Well, after the show, we came back to find... Our house was just the same as we left it! Our traveling friends treated the space with respect, and even cleaned up a little bit. The next few days are sort of a blur, with Brother Inferior, Shamus, Alex and Stu, and our normal barrage of roommates paying at our house. But everyone got along and all was well. However, a few days later, everything changed. We saw the three kids off to NYC, and were sitting back and enjoying the peace and quiet when I went to my record collection to put something on, only to find a handful of records missing — one in particular being my Devoid of Faith Purpose Lost 10”. The other records are nothing that can’t be replaced, but the DOF 10” is hard as hell to come by, and I’m extremely aggravated. After discovering that, I found (as well as my roommates) that other assorted items had been taken. (And I want to clear up that nobody in Brother Inferior or any of the other people who were at my house could have taken it, since I saw it after they all left. The only people who could have taken it were Shamus, Alex and Stu — Shamus in particular, since he was one of those rare record collecting dorks.) I spent the next month or so calling friends inNYC, Pittsburgh, Mass., and any other surrounding states, hoping I c6uld catch up to them, but had no luck. So I’m writing this as both a warning, and possibly for help. Don’t trust these fuckers. They’re backstabbers. I don’t know much about them other than their names, but I know that Stu is originally from Maine, and Shamus, I believe, is from Florida, but I’m not 100% sure. Don’t let them into your house, or anywhere near anything you treasure. Also, if anybody knows where I can find any of them, please let me know, even if it’s across the country. I don’t expect to get my records back (although it might be nice), but I do want to confront these fuckwads, and maybe get 5 minutes alone with them. Anybody with info, or whatever, can write me: Andrew/480 West St. Apt. 1/Albany, NY 12206; Policeline@hotmail.com. Thanks for your time, and please watch who you let into your home. Dear Kent, I ’m writing in response to Brian Roettinger’s review of the Vietnam Syndrome 7”. Where did you find this jackass? I own this record and while I do listen to quite a bit of Oi, I can not fathom how this record could be branded as an Oi band. But, I digress. I read your column and, while I whole- heartedly agree with it, I don’t see any of this in your record reviews or in the ads running in your ‘zine. I whole-heartedly agree that the punk scene and all of its sub-genres have become textbook and flaccid. But, then again, the scene has been over-run by wandering buffoons like Brian Roettinger, who claim one small portion of the scene for 6 months and then move on. He apparently doesn’t give a damn about the lyrics or the message as he failed to mention this. While I realize that a column from the editor doesn’t constitute editorial policy, there really ought to be some continuity of ideas in a ‘zine. Not to mention a standard of quality and objectiveness. It’s pathetic to print a review that trashes a record because it’s not their “style,” or because it doesn’t fit into their definitions of punk, emo or hardcore. Tell you what, give that MDC discography to your reviewers. Don’t tell them what it is or when it was recorded. Watch it get tom apart. And we wonder why punk sucks. Sincerely, Lita Revolt from Hippie Bloodbath/1 404 W Michigan #3/Kalamazoo, MI 49006 Lita — I’m glad you are taking the time to point out where you think I am full of shit. However, the problem I have is that the Vietnam Syndrome 7” is really bad. I listened to it, and I actually thought it was a joke the first time I heard it. I thought they > were fucking around because no band could have such a horrible sound. I was amazed when I discovered that the whole record sounded so awful. I was originally going to review it myself but I truly hated the sound of the record. I would have demolished the record. Yes, it has good lyrics, and that is commendable, but it doesn ’t make up for the fact that the recorded music is so awful. So rather than trash it I put it back into the general review box so that maybe the band would have a chance at getting a better review from someone else. It seemed to me that the band meant well and had their heart in the right location, so 1 figured they deserved another shot. Unfortunately, Brian didn 7 like the record either. He wrote a much kinder review than I would have, though he made no reference to the lyrics while I probably would have focused on the lyrics in order to skirt the fact that the music was so awful. Musical taste is very subjective. As I said in my column, I was not trying to define what punk should sound like only that I wished that punk bands would speak about the world we live in. Vietnam Syndrome did that, but 1 still didn 7 like their music. I never said that I thought people should listen to music that they don ’ t like just because the lyrics are good. I only said that I was disappointed that so many bands are not concerned whatsoever with their message and content. None of that changes the fact that neither Brian nor I liked the record. I agree that the Oi! comparison seems odd to me, but I realize that reviews are completely subjective and if that was what Brian thought then that is what he thought. I don 7 think we can argue about whether his taste in music is “right” or “wrong.” That is a dead end. Oddly enough Ding Dong Ditch Records sent us two copies of the Vietnam Syndrome 7” and the record was accidentally reviewed by two different people. The second review was not written until right before we got your letter and I had intended to not print this review. But it seems appropriate to print it now: “Very basic punk/hardcore with a definite ‘80s feel. In a way this reminds me of Dead Silence, except that Dead Silence is really great and this sadly isn 7. Judging from the lyrics they definitely mean well. In all other departments (music, vocals) they’re lacking, though.” This review was written by a Swiss woman named Marianne Hofstetter. She has been playing in bands for many years and she wrote this review before we got your letter. Apparently she wasn 7 too impressed either. Does this mean that Vietnam Syndrome is a bad band, no, it only means that Brian, Marianne and I didn 7 like the record. The vast majority of the world would hate M.D.C.’s sound, but that doesn’t mean that they aren 7 an important band in my life. To each their own. — Kent T>o ROX 120 S-401 22 G0TEBORG.
