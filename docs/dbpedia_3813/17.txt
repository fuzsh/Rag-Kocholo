Morava Airport (Serbian language: Аеродром Mopaвa / Aerodrom Morava) (ICAO: LYKV), also known as Lađevci Airport (Аеродром Лађевци / Aerodrom Lađevci), is a mixed public and military airport in Lađevci, Serbia - some 15 km (9.5 mi) from Kraljevo, 25 km (15.5 mi) from Čačak, and 39 km (24.4 mi) from Kragujevac. The airport has been divided into two distinct parts: the 98th Air Base of the Serbian Air Force has kept the name Lađevci whereas civilian terminal building bears the name Morava Airport.[1]

History[]

Lađevci airbase was originally used as a support airfield for the 98th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment of the Yugoslav Air Force based at Skopski Petrovac airbase in the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, Lađevci airbase became more active when the 98th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment was transferred from Petrovac to Kraljevo. From then at airfield there were few units of FR Yugoslav Air Force, 98th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment with its 241st Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron equipped with J-22 Orao attack aircraft, 353rd Reconnaissance Aviation Squadron equipped with IJ-22 Orao reconnaissance aircraft and the 714th Anti-Tank Helicopter Squadron equipped with SA.342L Gazelle Gama attack helicopters. During 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the airport and runway were badly damaged.

Recent developments[]

2006–2018

In 2006, Government of Serbia began conversion of the airport to provide civilian traffic. In the first phase, the new control tower (the former having been destroyed in 1999 by NATO bombing) was constructed.[2] Then in 2011, new terminal building was built that can service both passenger and cargo flights. This is expected to be followed by the second phase – broadening and extending of the existing runway, presently 30 metres (98 feet) wide to a width of 45 metres (148 feet) and length of 2,750 metres (9,022 feet), upon which the airport will be able to receive the largest passenger or cargo aircraft.

2018–present

As of 2017, Morava Airport has the potential to become an international airport if further efforts are made.[3] The Serbian government has announced the opening of Kraljevo's Morava Airport on June 28, making it the country's third commercial airport after Belgrade and Niš. Wizz Air had previously expressed interest in serving Morava Airport and said it was "monitoring developments". Furthermore, the Serbian government previously announced it was willing to enter into a public-private partnership agreement with a German company which would operate services from Kraljevo to both Frankfurt and Istanbul. The name of the company was not specified. In addition, part of the Raška District, in which Kraljevo is located, has close historical ties with Turkey and a portion of the local population is expected to use this airport, instead of Pristina, for future flights to Istanbul.[4]

Airlines and destinations[]

The first passenger aircraft at Morava Airport landed on October 4, 2011; a Jat Airways ATR 72-202 carried then-president Boris Tadić along with other government officials for a media briefing regarding the recovery effort from the 2010 Kraljevo earthquake.[5] Jat Airways planned to introduce regular traffic between Kraljevo and Istanbul in 2012.,[6] but it never materialized. During 2016 construction of new passenger terminal was accomplished. Morava Airport is on course to open its doors on June 28, 2019. From its opening in late June, until the end of 2019, it is expected that several carriers introduce flights from the airport. It will handle around 20.000 passengers in 2019, and between 100.000 - 150.000 in 2020.[7]
