        "text": "'Rock On!!' (2008) & 'Rock On 2' (2016)\n\nThe first part was generation-defining and its music is still fresh in our ears. Shankar-Ehsan-Loy's music with Javed Akhtar's lyrics made all of us fall in love with Magik. Rampal won both the National Award and Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Joe Mascarenhas. The sequel got hit by demonetization but had a beautiful character arc and refreshing experimental music.\n\n'Om Shanti Om' (2007)\n\nThe Farah Khan-directed reincarnation drama has become a cult classic with time. The world saw Deepika Padukone for the first time in Hindi cinema and it's been our dream to have an Ajab Si moment since then. Rampal's portrayal of villainous Mukesh Mehra aka Mike added an extra edge to the film. The cold-hearted villain made us forget all his previous romantic roles.\n\n'Raajneeti' (2010)\n\nPrakash Jha's political thriller is based on the Hindu epic Mahabharata and loosely based on Godfather. It grabbed many eyeballs during its release. Many prompted the film to have certain shades of the Nehru-Gandhi family which were dismissed by the makers. Rampal played the character of Prithviraj Pratap who had shades of Sonny Corleone too and viewers were in awe of his performance.\n\n'Ra.One' (2011)\n\nAnubhav Sinha directed a superhero movie starring Shah Rukh Khan was a visual treat. The VFX was impeccable considering the time. The movie's plot was a high concept and it received mixed reviews throughout but unanimously, everyone loved Rampal's portrayal of Ra.One. The character was based on Ravana from Ramayana but his villainous voice and VFX made him a new-gen villain for the youth.\n\n'Housefull' (2010)"
