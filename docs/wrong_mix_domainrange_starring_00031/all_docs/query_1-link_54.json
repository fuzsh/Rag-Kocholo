(2012), all of which were among the highest grossing productions of their respective years.[5][10] Her portrayal of an autistic woman in Barfi! and the eponymous boxer in the biographical sports drama Mary Kom earned her further acclaim.[11][12][13] From 2015 to 2018, she starred as Alex Parrish on the ABC drama thriller series Quantico, becoming the first South Asian woman to headline an American network series.[14][15] Also in 2015, Chopra starred alongside an ensemble cast in the comedy-drama Dil Dhadakne Do and won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for portraying Kashibai in the period film Bajirao Mastani, one of the highest grossing Indian films of all time.[16] In 2016, Chopra produced the Marathi comedy-drama Ventilator, a critical and commercial success.[17] She appeared in multiple Hollywood films, including Baywatch (2017), and Isn't It Romantic? (2019).[18][19] She later received praise for playing a protective mother in the biographical drama The Sky Is Pink (2019), which she also produced.[20] Following supporting roles in the satirical drama The White Tiger and The Matrix Resurrections (both 2021),[21][22] Chopra starred in the Amazon Prime Video action thriller series Citadel (2023).[23]\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nAs actress\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Priyanka Chopra film acting credits Year Title Role Language Notes Ref. 2002 Thamizhan Priya Tamil [24] 2003 The Hero: Love Story of a Spy Shaheen Zakaria Hindi [25] Andaaz Jiyana \"Jiya\" Singhania Hindi [26] 2004 Plan Rani Hindi [27] Kismat Sapna Gosai Hindi [28] Asambhav Alisha Hindi [29] Mujhse Shaadi Karogi Rani Singh Hindi [30] Aitraaz Sonia Roy Hindi [31] 2005 Blackmail Sanjana Rathod Hindi [32] Karam Shalini Hindi [33] Waqt: The Race Against Time Pooja Thakur Hindi [34] Yakeen Simar Oberoi Hindi [35] Barsaat Kajal Hindi [36] Bluffmaster!
