        "text": "Deepika Padukone has come a long way in her acting journey. She has been ruling everyone’s hearts with her acting skills. Deepika made her debut with Om Shanti Om which also starred Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role. Well, today her debut film completed 16 years and she took to her social media accounts to celebrate a significant milestone in her career and express heartfelt gratitude to her fans. It has been 16 years since the release of her debut film and on this special occasion, Deepika shared a series of throwback clips that instantly tugged at the heartstrings of her followers.\n\nTaking to her Instagram stories, Deepika Padukone wrote “Gratitude.” The second story shows a fan art which the actress re-shared and the third story offers a compilation of Deepika’s 16 years of journey in the Bollywood industry. Om Shanti Om was released in 2007. Directed by Farah Khan and produced by Gauri Khan, it also featured Kirron Kher, Shreyas Talpade, Arjun Rampal, Yuvika Chaudhary, and others in pivotal roles.\n\nTake a look here:\n\nDeepika had revealed on Koffee With Karan that she had come out of “a couple of difficult relationships” when she met Ranveer for the first time, and therefore, she was not ready to commit him.\n\n“I wanted to be single for a while because I had come from difficult relationships. I was going through a phase where I said ‘I just don’t want to be attached, don’t want to be committed’. And I had fun! And then he came along, so I didn’t commit, until he proposed to me. There was no commitment as such. Even if we were technically allowed to see other people, we would just keep coming back to each other,” Deepika revealed. This led to fans speculating if the couple was in “a situation-ship”.\n\nOn the work front, Deepika will be seen in Fighter with Hrithik Roshan. Both are sharing screen space for the first time. She also has Lady Singham in her kitty. The poster is already out."
