It was one of the biggest hits of the year. The plot, although drawing on the idea of two rather lovable crooks, does not contain violence. In fact, each of the adventures of Bunty and Babli are thoroughly Indianised, like the fake selling of the Taj Mahal. It draws comparisons to the American classic \"Bonnie and Clyde\", however there are no dark elements to the film and the lead characters do not die a bloody death, unlike their American counterparts."
