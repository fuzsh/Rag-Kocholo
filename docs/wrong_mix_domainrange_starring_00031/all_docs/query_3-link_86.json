        "text": "Om Shanti Om has acquired the status of a cult film over the years. Despite its loud, larger than life portrayal of reincarnation and the glamorous world of Bollywood, the movie was a huge box office hit. It also brought together several actors and filmmakers through cameos and songs like Deewangi Deewangi.\n\nSome even call it Bollywood’s multiverse of madness which happened way before Avengers!\n\nAs it turns out, the cameos we saw on screen were only a fraction of the ones shot for the film.\n\nIn a deleted scenes video that has resurfaced on social media, many more stars made cameos in Om Shanti Om that would have fit right into the awards scene with the other special appearances. They were probably cut for time.\n\nFrom Farhan Akhtar to Boman Irani, a lot of Bollywood stars were seen in these scenes. However, the one that absolutely took us by surprise was R. Madhavan!\n\nThe red carpet scene in Om Shanti Om has an off-screen anchor, Farah Khan, asking stars who they think should win the award for Best Actor. In one of the deleted scenes, R. Madhavan can be seen saying that he feels he deserves an award for this, but unfortunately he wasn’t even nominated for the category. He goes on to add that he’s often lovingly addressed as “South (India) ka Shah Rukh Khan,” but nobody in Bollywood respects him. He walks off screen with a sad huff.\n\nHere’s how fans reacted to Madhavan’s cameo, which many felt was the best of the lot.\n\nSome felt R. Madhavan’s dialogue in the Om Shanti Om cameo actually exposed the harsh truth of Bollywood Vs south Indian cinema. Bollywood tends to get more popularity over south indian cinema even though there are several south stars who are infinitely more talented.\n\nThis holds especially true in the recent tussle between the two industries, which is ultimately leading to a pan-Indian film industry."
