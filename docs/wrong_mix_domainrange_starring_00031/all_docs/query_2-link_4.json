        "text": "Shah Rukh Khan is one of the biggest superstars in India and has sustained that position for a very long time. As such, when Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Kapoor’s son, Ranbir Kapoor’s debut film, Saawariya was clashing with his film Om Shanti Om, Shah Rukh did not see it as a competition.\n\nIn a press conference back then, Shah Rukh said, “Competition is normally with something that is bigger than you. Unfortunately, I wake up in the morning and I believe, rightly or wrongly, that my film is the biggest in the world; and because my film is the biggest in the world, and that’s the belief I have, I don’t think there can be anything bigger.”\n\nHe added, “I don’t have no competition and I say that with all honesty. I’m not trying to sound pompous or arrogant or people think I’m making fun of Saawariya, I don’t need to. I believe my film is the biggest and I will only compete with something that runs faster than me, jumps higher than me, laughs louder than me or screams better than me. I wake up every morning and say no, my film does that. So, there’s no competition by deriding that film. I wish them all the luck, they’ll need it.”\n\nOm Shanti Om was released in 2007. The film was directed by Farah Khan and also marked Deepika Padukone’s debut in Bollywood. The film has become a classic with a cult fan following today. Om Shanti Om was produced on a budget of Rs 40 crore, earning 150 crore worldwide.\n\nAs for Saawariya, the Sanjay Leela Bhansali directorial marked Ranbir Kapur’s debut with Sonam Kapoor. The film also had special appearances from Salman Khan and Rani Mukerji, who were also involved in the film’s promotions. As per reports, the film was made on a budget of Rs 45 crore and earned Rs 39.22 crore.\n\nSince then, Ranbir Kapoor has established himself as a superstar today. His latest release, Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal was a massive hit at the box office. Ranbir is now shooting for Nitesh Tiwari’s Ramayana. Sai Pallavi will play Sita to Ranbir Kapoor’s Ram.\n\nMeanwhile, Shah Rukh Khan was last seen in Rajkumar Hirani’s Dunki. He is now busy with Sujoy Ghosh’s King. The film will see Shah Rukh playing a parallel lead with his daughter, Suhana Khan."
