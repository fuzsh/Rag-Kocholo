        "text": "Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas made their engagement official over the weekend as they held a beautiful roka ceremony in Mumbai.\n\nNick’s family flew to India for the event, with a host of the couple’s friends and family invited to their lavish engagement party later in the night.\n\nHowever, Deepika Padukone wasn’t on the guestlist – and people are wondering why.\n\nPriyanka, 36, and Nick, 25, celebrated their engagement after the traditional roka and pujas at Chopra’s home, partying the night away with celebrities including Vishal Bhardwaj, Alia Bhatt, Parineeti Chopra and Arpita Khan.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BmntrPoAgQS/?hl=en&taken-by=priyankachopra\n\nDeepika’s rumoured boyfriend Ranveer Singh was reportedly in attendance – making the actress’s absence all the more noticeable.\n\nA source told DNA India: ‘Deepika has always been supportive of Priyanka and she would have definitely gone to wish her if she was invited.\n\n‘In fact, everyone knows Ranveer and Deepika are a couple and will walk down the aisle this November. So, it’s odd that PC left Dippy’s name out of her guestlist.’\n\nPriyanka and Deepika have starred alongside each other in Billu, Om Shanti Om, Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela and, most recently, Bajirao Mastani in 2015.\n\nAnd Priyanka still follows Deepika on Instagram – so we doubt there’s any major bad blood between the two Bollywood actresses.\n\nNick proposed to the Quantico star on her 36th birthday, and they finally confirmed they were engaged via sweet Instagram posts after their traditional roka ceremony.\n\nMORE : Vogue Williams reveals beautiful wedding gown months after marrying Spencer Matthews"
