        "text": "The veteran actor is upset with SRK and the makers of Om Shanti Om for re-releasing the movie in Japan without deleting the controversial scenes taking a dig at him.\n\nMumbai: Veteran actor and filmmaker Manoj Kumar, who is upset with the makers of Om Shanti Om for re-releasing the movie in Japan without deleting the controversial scenes taking a dig at him, has decided to take action against the producers of the movie. (Read: SRK to be sued by Manoj Kumar over Om Shanti Om scenes )\n\nThe 2007 Shah Rukh Khan-starrer blockbuster was directed by Farah Khan and was produced by Gauri Khan.\n\n\"I will take a serious action this time. I have no hard feelings for Shah Rukh and is happy that he is busy with his projects, but by insulting a person's image how can it be beneficial for your film,\" Manoj Kumar said.\n\n\"I don't know the date when I will go to the court. I would file civil and criminal proceedings against the producers. It should be anytime soon,\" he added.\n\nThe actor of hits like Neelkamal and Hariyali Aur Rasta is \"disturbed\".\n\n\"I am a strong person. I can bear physical injury, but if someone tries to injure my soul that cannot be forgiven,\" he said.\n\nIn 2008, Manoj Kumar took the producers of the film to court as he was not happy with a spoof made on him in Om Shanti Om.\n\nThe court had asked the makers to remove all the scenes that were found distasteful by the actor from all the prints as well as broadcast material forever.\n\n\"First time (late) Yash Chopra got Shah Rukh Khan and Farah Khan to my house and they said they will remove all those scenes from the film and then the things were sorted. But later, when they didn't do so, I told Yash Chopra about it and he said they have stabbed him in the back,\" he added.\n\nThe actor-director says when it comes to his self-respect, he can't compromise.\n\n\"I don't have any personal clash with Shah Rukh Khan. He is a nice person, but when it comes to my self-respect, then I can't compromise on it,\" said Manoj Kumar known for directing patriotic films like Purab Aur Paschim and Upkar.\n\n\"My grandchildren recently asked me that friends were asking - is his grandfather the same as shown in the film? When my wife goes out for some pooja, her friends ask her - is your husband same as portrayed in the film? How does one expect me to react in such a situation,\" said the veteran.\n\nEntertainment I Read Latest News on NDTV Entertainment.
