Melissa attended a local high school when she was noticed by a scout who helped her sign her first modelling contract and upon matriculating in 1983, she didn’t pursue a college degree, but devoted her time to modelling.\n\nCareer as an actress and a model\n\nAfter gaining recognition, Melissa could’ve been seen featured on the cover page of various popular magazines, including “Vogue”, “Elle” and “Cosmopolitan”.\n\nShe moved to acting in the early 2000s, but has been credited with only a single role. In 2001, she portrayed The Walking Girl in the musical comedy “Triangles and Tribulations” written and directed by Amine Bitar, and which starred Ken Jones, Christine Jones and Kyley Jones.

Matt studied at Newton North High School, and then after matriculating moved to New York to work on his career as a model – however, he was told he was too short for a model.\n\nOne time while walking to his friend’s apartment, Matt met a ‘cute girl’ as he described her, and she explained that she was going to an acting class. Matt agreed to go with her, and not long after that became an actor, first appearing in various TV shows and commercials, before winning the role of Joey in “Friends”, and becoming famous in both the US and Europe.\n\nHis first recurring role came in 1991, when he portrayed Vinnie Verducci in the critically acclaimed comedy series “Married… With Children”, and the following years saw him appear in various comedy series, including “The Red Shoe Diaries”, “Top of the Heap” and “Vinnie & Bobby”. In 2004, he was cast to star as Joey in the aforementioned eponymous romantic comedy series “Friends”, created by Shana Goldberg-Meehan and Scott Silveri, and which also starred Paulo Costanzo and Drea de Matteo.\n\nIt follows Joey as he moves to Los Angeles to work on his acting career. It won two awards and was nominated for three others including one Golden Globe, but after it wasn’t renewed for a fourth season in 2006, Matt stated he was taking a one year break from acting, which then turned into five years.\n\nHe came back to acting in 2011 when he portrayed ‘a fictional version of himself’ in the comedy series “Episodes”, created by David Crane and Jeffrey Klarik, and which also starred Stephen Mangan and Tamsin Greig. It follows several TV producers from Britain who come to Hollywood to export their TV series.\n\nFor his performance, Matt won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series, Musical, or Comedy, while he was also nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards. The series aired until 2017.\n\nHis most recent role has been in the sitcom “Man with a Plan”, in which he starred from 2016 to 2020.\n\nMatt has won a total of seven awards and been nominated for 31 others.\n\nSince 2016, he has been in a relationship with Aurora Mulligan who is 17 years younger than him, and was born in Northern Ireland. She holds a degree in political science and government from Liverpool University, and is a TV producer, known for her work on the series’ “Charley Boorman’s USA Adventure” and “Top Gear”."
