        "text": "Matt LeBlanc is the famous actor behind the iconic \"Friends\" character, Joey Tribbiani.\n\nAt the peak of his fame, he took a break from the limelight after his marriage ended and his daughter was diagnosed with a brain condition.\n\nLeBlanc is a doting father who raised his daughter to be a daddy's girl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatt LeBlanc is known for his iconic role in the hit sitcom, \"Friends.\" He is the star behind the famous character of Joey Tribbiani.\n\nMelissa McKnight and Matt LeBlanc getting married in Kilauea, Hawaii in 2003 | Source: Getty Images\n\nAlthough the sitcom has ended, it is still a much-loved show that many generations have watched. But at the peak of his career and the global recognition of his acting skills, LeBlanc disappeared from the public eye.\n\nThings were looking good for the actor after he married his long-time fiancee, Melissa McKnight, on the Hawaiian island of Kauai in 2003. The wedding ceremony was attended by many of the \"Friends” stars, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox, and David Schwimmer.\n\nMelissa McKnight and Matt LeBlanc getting married in Kilauea, Hawaii in 2003 | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, LeBlanc's marriage ended after three years. The couple cited conceivable differences but that their separation was amicable. They were reportedly working towards a peaceful joint and legal custody process of their daughter, Marina. The actor was requested to pay $15,000 a month for child support until Marina turned 18. He also covered her medical, nanny costs, and school tuition.\n\nMelissa McKnight and Matt LeBlanc at the People's Choice Awards in California in 2005 | Source: Getty Images\n\nFollowing the end of his marriage and dealing with his daughter's brain condition, LeBlanc slowly faded out of the spotlight. He was last seen after the end of \"Friends” in 2004. However, he starred in the show's spin-off and left after two seasons.\n\nMelissa McKnight and Matt LeBlanc at the People's Choice Awards in California in 2005 | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor eventually opened up about his hiatus. He reasoned that his marriage had just ended, but despite predicting the demise of his union, he was dealing with his daughter's condition.\n\nMatt LeBlanc with his daughter Marina at Power Women Gala in New York in 2014 | Source: Getty Images\n\nHe confessed, \"My daughter was diagnosed with a problem with her head. It was a very dark period.\" Even more saddening was that a nanny had reportedly revealed the condition to the public, leaving LeBlanc devastated.\n\nMatt LeBlanc and Melissa McKnight at the \"Mayor Of The Sunset Strip\" premier in Los Angeles in 2003 | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegarding his marriage, the actor reflected on what might have gone wrong. He admitted that his relationship with his ex-wife was once great, but after his daughter was diagnosed with cortical dysplasia, a condition that affects the brain, bones, and motor skills, he revealed that he focused too much on his work and let go of his nurturing his marriage.\n\nMelissa McKnight and actor Matt LeBlanc at the \"Episodes\" premiere in 2012 | Source: Getty Images\n\nLeBlanc was not certain about ever getting married again. He said his father got married about eight or ten times, which affected their relationship. So, seeing how the multiple marriages impacted him and his father, LeBlanc is a doting father to his daughter.\n\nHis role as a father is one of the most important ones, and taking time off work to be a full-time father was amazing. LeBlanc proudly said Marina was a daddy's girl, and dedicating his life to her never made him feel like he was missing out on anything."
