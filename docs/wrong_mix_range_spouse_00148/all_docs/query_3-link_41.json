Nonetheless, her appearance in the 2001 TV show “VH1: All Access” garnered praise from critics and fans alike.\n\nWhile achieving recognition in the film landscape through these two projects, Melissa never ventured into additional movies or TV shows. Furthermore, she maintained an air of mystery around her future endeavors, not disclosing any upcoming projects. Notably, she made an appearance at “The 31st Annual People’s Choice Awards” in 2005.\n\nWhen Did Melissa Get Divorced?\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Matt LeBlanc initiated an unexpected divorce filing from his spouse Melissa McKnight in 2006. This news sent shockwaves through McKnight, and her longtime friend Kelly Phillips disclosed that the development was “very sudden” and caught the actress completely off guard.\n\nAs per reports, the discord began when the “Joey” star abruptly declared in January 2006 his intention to depart from the California home he had been sharing with McKnight and their daughter. This unforeseen announcement marked the beginning of the troubles that eventually led to their separation.\n\nAbout Melissa McKnight Ex-Husband Matt LeBlanc\n\nMatthew Steven LeBlanc was born on July 25, 1967. Hailing from the United States, he has made a name for himself as an actor, television producer, and comedian. His portrayal of Joey Tribbiani in the widely acclaimed NBC comedy “Friends,” along with its spin-off series “Joey,” catapulted him to international fame.\n\nNotably, LeBlanc secured three Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his standout performance on “Friends,” in addition to clinching a Golden Globe Award. His role as a fictionalized version of himself in “Episodes” (2011–2017) garnered him four more Emmy Award nominations.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2019, LeBlanc took on the co-hosting duties for the renowned show “Top Gear.” Further showcasing his versatility, he assumed the role of patriarch Adam Burns in the CBS sitcom “Man with a Plan” from 2016 to 2020.\n\nMelissa McKnight’s ex-husband, Matt LeBlanc, possessed considerable popularity, which extended to her when they tied the knot in 2003 after a period of courtship. LeBlanc’s career began to take shape when he was featured in a Heinz Tomato Ketchup advertisement in 1987.
