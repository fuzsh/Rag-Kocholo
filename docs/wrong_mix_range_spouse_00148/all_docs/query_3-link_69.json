Our 26th summer camp for children experiencing homelessness in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky was a success! Almost all of our students retained or increased their social-emotional skills (95%), and a majority of children retained or improved their math (76%) and literacy (80%) skills. Thank you to Dr. Heidi Kloos and her research team from the Children's Cognitive Research Lab at University of Cincinnati for spending another summer with our kiddos! We are grateful to all of our community partners, donors, staff, interns, and volunteers who made UpSpring Summer 360¬∞ possible.
