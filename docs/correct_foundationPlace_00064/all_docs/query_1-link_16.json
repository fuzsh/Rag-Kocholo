        "text": "At JetBrains we create, contribute, and support Open Source projects. We are the company behind IntelliJ IDEA and Kotlin, both of which are Open Source and foundational to the many other tools and products we have at JetBrains.\n\nThis organization houses many of the Open Source projects we work on and provide to the community. Each one has a label that categorises the type of project it is:\n\nLabel Description Official projects are officially supported by JetBrains. These can be products, plugins, learning materials, books, and more. They are available for all to use in accordance to the licensing terms and are fully supported by JetBrains. Team projects are created by JetBrains employees. These projects include 20% projects, internal hackathons, those that support product development process, and/or benefit the JetBrains developer community. Team Projects are available for all to use in accordance to the licensing terms, despite not being officially supported. However, there are times that Team Projects become Official Projects. Incubator projects are official projects that are being developed by JetBrains. They are considered experimental, not mature enough, or lacking in some manner or release quality such testing and supporting documentation. They are provided as is. Research projects are official projects developed and maintained by laboratories of JetBrains Research. These projects aim to contribute to cutting-edge scientific work and bring its discoveries into the everyday experience of our users. They are provided as is. Obsolete projects are those that have been discontinued, superseded, or historical.\n\nIn addition to creating and maintaining Open Source projects, JetBrains also contributes, sponsors (both financially and via licenses) many Open Source projects. Find out more about how JetBrains helps Open Source.\n\nThis code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our open source projects and communities (community programs), as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour. We invite all those who participate to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.\n\nThe following behaviours are expected and requested of all community members:\n\nParticipate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.\n\nExercise consideration, respect and empathy in your speech and actions. Remember, we have all been through different stages of learning when adopting technologies.\n\nRefrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech.\n\nDisagreements on things are fine, argumentative behaviour or trolling are not.\n\nDo not perform threats of violence or use violent language directed against another person.\n\nDo not make jokes of sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory nature, or use language of this nature.\n\nDo not post or display sexually explicit or violent material.\n\nDo not post or threaten to post other peopleâ€™s personally identifying information (\"doxing\").\n\nDo not make personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.\n\nDo not engage in sexual attention. This includes, sexualised comments or jokes and sexual advances.\n\nDo not advocate for, or encourage, any of the above behaviour.\n\nPlease take into account that online communities bring together people from many different cultures and backgrounds. It's important to understand that sometimes the combination of cultural differences and online interaction can lead to misunderstandings. That is why having empathy is very important.\n\nIf someone is acting inappropriately or violating this Code of Conduct in any shape or form, and they are not receptive to your feedback or you prefer not to confront them, please reach out to JetBrains via codeofconduct@jetbrains.com\n\nUnacceptable behaviour from any community member will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in unacceptable behaviour, JetBrains and/or community organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.\n\nThe license is based off of The Citizen Code of Conduct is distributed by Stumptown Syndicate under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license."
