        "text": "JetBrains AI Assistant is now generally available with a number of new and improved features to increase your productivity. The latest set of improvements for ReSharper includes:\n\nContext-aware AI chat\n\nBetter project awareness for AI Actions\n\nAI-powered multiline code completion\n\nUnit test generation\n\nXML documentation generation\n\nAbility to create a library of custom prompts\n\nUse AI Assistant in ReSharper as a supplemental feature with a JetBrains AI Service subscription.\n\nWatch the demo\n\nWith its latest release, ReSharper extends the list of supported C# 12 features, namely primary constructors, alias directives to reference any kind of type, collection expressions, interceptors, and others.\n\nCheck out this blog post to dive into the latest updates to C# support introduced in ReSharper and Rider 2023.3.\n\nWatch the demo\n\nThe latest update also puts you in control of the amount of resources to be allocated to solution-wide code analysis. You can now choose between Low, Moderate, and High modes of resource utilization.\n\nDespite its name, the High mode is designed to not interfere with typing in the editor and does not degrade the IDEâs responsiveness. It gradually starts increasing the CPU usage only when code analysis is being interrupted by the code typing, maintaining a smooth typing experience all while solution-wide analysis is processing the source code in the background.\n\nFinding usages of types and constructors is now faster for solutions with numerous target-typed object creations (e.g. SomeType _field = new() ). This improvement also positively affects refactoring speed.\n\nWeâve also fixed some issues associated with handling injected languages, which used to cause increased CPU usage.\n\nReworked UX for the Extract local function refactoring\n\nWe've revamped the user experience for the Extract local function refactoring. In the past, selecting a location for the new function from the list of available options was challenging, and it wasn't clear what would be affected by that choice.\n\nWith the updated UX, you'll now see a preview of the new function's signature directly in the code editor. This makes it easy to understand precisely where it will be inserted and how your choice will impact the introduced function. You can also see which variables will be transformed into parameters rather than closures and which other functions will be relocated to allow calls at the new location.\n\nVisual Studio and ReSharperâs quick actions can complement each other well when used discerningly. With ReSharper 2023.3, you can easily leverage the power of both systems. You can now tweak the settings to either use ReSharperâs quick actions exclusively, display suggestion icons for both, or invoke all quick actions from a single access point â ReSharperâs bulb menu.\n\nIn ReSharper C++ 2023.3, working with inactive code has become much easier. Code completion in currently inactive code blocks inside conditional preprocessor branches now suggests symbols from the global scope. Find Usages also got an update and now shows possible usages in inactive code and macro bodies in the dedicated results sections.\n\nLearn more about the C++ updates: Whatâs New in ReSharper C++ 2023.3\n\nReSharper 2023.3 introduces a new formatting engine for Razor. Itâs compatible with ReSharperâs current C# formatter, thus supporting C# language constructs introduced in recent years and most of ReSharper's new formatting options for C#. The new formatter also operates faster and is expected to have fewer issues. However, it does modify the default formatting for some code. Therefore, we have introduced an option to revert to the old formatting engine for Razor. You can find it in ReSharperâs Options under Code Editing | Razor | Code Style.\n\nEntity Framework-specific analyses in ReSharper 2023.3 will inspect your code for potential issues in the EF model, such as unlimited string property length and dependency loops. If you then invoke a context menu on such an inspection and select Show Entity Relationship Diagram, youâll be able to investigate the issue visually.\n\nCheck out this blog post to learn more about visualizing Entity Framework relationships and the new inspections.\n\nThe ability to compare assemblies now has more comparison options. You can choose between several diff modes (Show all, Show only differences, Show only signature differences, Show only public API differences). Additionally, you can specify if youâd like the Diff to ignore member/attribute order differences, as well as differences in nullable reference typesâ annotations."
