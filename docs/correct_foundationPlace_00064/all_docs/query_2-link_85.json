        "text": "Oracle Database runs faster and more efficiently\n\nOracle hardware lets IT teams deploy optimized solutions in customer data centers and easy-to-manage appliances in remote offices and edge environments. Solutions with full-stack integration and optimizations let customers run Oracle Database up to 10X faster with Oracle Exadata’s Smart Scan query offload.\n\nWatch NTT DOCOMO’s story (0:48)\n\nEasy integration with Oracle’s public cloud\n\nBuilt-in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) integrations make it easy for organizations to develop and deploy cloud native applications across OCI and customer data centers, store data in the public cloud, and simplify both data protection and cloud migrations. Oracle Cloud Observability and Management Platform provides IT teams with the information they need to understand and manage all the layers of their IT stack, no matter where it’s located.\n\nEnhanced availability and data protection\n\nOracle IT infrastructure helps organizations increase the availability of their mission-critical Oracle databases and applications. Fault-tolerant, scale-out designs and built-in capabilities simplify the implementation of Oracle Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA) best practices, letting customers achieve up to 99.999% availability with Oracle Exadata in MAA configurations, as described in IDC’s analysis (PDF).\n\nWatch Exelon’s story (1:28)\n\nLower costs with high performance consolidation\n\nOracle hardware lowers the cost of running on-premises workloads by reducing the number of systems required, delivering higher performance per software license, and reducing IT staff workloads. Oracle Private Cloud Appliance lets customers consolidate containerized, cloud native applications—and those running natively on multiple operating systems—onto a single platform while Cloud@Customer solutions let organizations benefit from consumption-based economics in their own data centers.\n\nAnalyst report: Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer reduces TCO by 47% (PDF)\n\nWatch Hyundai Home Shopping Group's story (1:48)"
