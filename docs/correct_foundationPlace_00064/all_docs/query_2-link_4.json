        "text": "Keeping in touch with our friends and colleagues is important to us. A Friday tradition emerged where we began sharing photographs of our pets to keep our spirits up.\n\nBut how about meeting new people? Grab a random coffee! A bot randomly pairs people together and sets them up to meet during the week for a half an hour conversation. Thank you, Donut!\n\n\"I’ve found this a useful way to get to know people and better understand what’s going on in the company.\" - Dmitry Jemerov\n\nJetBrainers have been able to work on 20% projects and hackathons for a long time now. In 2020 we launched JetBrains Labs, an initiative that supports and nurtures new ideas and new product development.\n\nEveryone at JetBrains is welcome to bring their ideas and start working on them. JetBrains Labs assists in refining the idea, doing market research, building a team, and finding users. We already have some really great projects in the works, so stay tuned!\n\nIn addition to our free Student License Program, JetBrains collaborates closely with 16 universities in Saint Petersburg, Moscow, and Novosibirsk, as well as TUM in Munich, MIT in Boston, University of California in Irvine and San Diego, Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, Uppsala University in Sweden, Johannes Kepler University in Austria, the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and others.\n\nIntelliJ IDEA 2020.3\n\nfeatures interactive hints in the debugger, improves support for Java 15, Spring, and other frameworks, and now officially supports the Lombok plugin.

Burst analysis and shader support have been updated for Unity developers, too.\n\nPyCharm 2020.3\n\nintroduces a variety of improvements to increase your productivity and code quality. Cloned or imported projects can now be configured in PyCharm 2020.3 with one click. If the project contains a requirements.txt, setup.py, environment.yml, or pipfile, PyCharm will set up a proper environment for you. Have an unresolved React component in your code? PyCharm now creates the relevant code construct for you.\n\nRubyMine 2020.3\n\nfeatures improved tab management in the editor, and many more new features for the latest version of Ruby and Rails. There are also new features and improvements for the debugger, terminal, and database tools.\n\nReSharper 2020.3\n\ncomes with support for the latest .NET 5 and C# 9 language updates, Dynamic Program Analysis, a new “Push-to-Hint” visibility mode, and Avalonia UI framework support.

Qt users will find new IDE features that are tuned specifically to working with Qt code.\n\nDataGrip 2020.3\n\nincludes SQL for MongoDB, Couchbase support, enhancements in the separate editor for values, and new data extractors.\n\n20 Years of Productive Development with IntelliJ IDEA!\n\nIntelliJ IDEA JetBrains’ flagship IDE, was founded in January 2001 and was one of the first available Java IDEs with advanced code navigation and code refactoring capabilities. By providing the best experience to developers, IntelliJ IDEA was pretty quickly acknowledged and nowadays IntelliJ IDEA is loved and used by more than 4 million developers around the world.\n\nPyCharm turned 10 and we celebrated its anniversary together with our users with the ‘10 Years of Coding Together’ campaign. As part of the celebrations, we asked PyCharm users to share their most groundbreaking projects created with PyCharm in the last 10 years and let the community select the ‘10 PyCharm Projects of the Decade’.\n\nView Winners and Projects\n\nKotlin in Education\n\nThis year, we connected with Kotlin educators from all over the world. Together we created a video about their teaching experiences and the reasons why they chose Kotlin for education.\n\nWe released a Kotlin for Education page for those who already teach Kotlin or would like to start teaching it. We also launched a dedicated #education channel in the Kotlinlang Slack workspace.\n\nOur Kotlin communities are also growing rapidly. Over 30,000 Kotlin developers are now exchanging knowledge and supporting each other on Slack and Reddit, and more than 100,000 people follow our official Twitter account for tips, tricks, and announcements. With over 200 user groups worldwide, the Kotlin community is thriving and growing.\n\nKotlin Online Event:\n\nNumber of live views over four days – 23,164\n\nTotal number of on-demand views – 120,000+\n\nKotlin 1.4 was released with a focus on quality and performance! We held the Kotlin 1.4 Online Event to help you get the most out of the changes and improvements introduced in Kotlin 1.4. Watch the talks here.\n\nWe've got a bunch of success stories for server-side and KMM.\n\nKotlin Multiplatform Mobile went Alpha.\n\nWe held three Kotlin Heroes competitive coding rounds in 2020. The most recent one, Kotlin Heroes #5: ICPC Round, took place November 12, 2020.\n\nWe found over 100 top-ranking universities that use Kotlin in their courses, including Stanford University, Imperial College London, University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins University, and UCLA. For an interactive map and the full list of universities, go to the Kotlin for Education page.\n\nJetBrains Connect\n\nJetBrains Connect is a YouTube series about people, technology, sharing, and learning. It brings experts and thought leaders together for an online discussion of topics from across the technology landscape.
