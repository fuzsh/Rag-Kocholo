What we’d like to comment on in this post is the reason behind this decision.\n\nWhy join?\n\nIt’s no surprise that we have invested a lot in .NET as a platform, and thanks to a wide recognition by our customers, ReSharper and the ReSharper Ultimate suite have enjoyed tremendous success for over a decade.\n\nWith the recent announcement of JetBrains Project Rider, our cross-platform .NET IDE, we have increased our commitment to the the platform and are striving to provide a truly cross-platform experience for .NET developers that brings the functionality of ReSharper to all, whether working on Windows inside Visual Studio, outside of Visual Studio, on Linux or on OSX.\n\nGiven this investment, for us, the future of .NET as a platform is important and our participation in the Technical Steering Group is to this effect. In essence, we’ll have a voice (technically with three seats we have three voices!) in decisions that impact key projects of the .NET Foundation such as the CoreCLR, Mono, C#, ASP.NET et al.\n\nOur commitment to ourselves and our customers is that we will strive for the best interests of .NET, which are to be a truly open, versatile and cross-platform ecosystem."
