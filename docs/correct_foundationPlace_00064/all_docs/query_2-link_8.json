        "text": "This Privacy Policy describes how the Kotlin Foundation (the âKotlin Foundation,â âwe,â or âusâ), and its members, Google LLC and JetBrains s.r.o., and JetBrains N.V. (collectively, the âFoundation Membersâ), collect, use, and disclose information about you solely in connection with the Kotlin Foundationâs coding competition, accessible at https://kotlinconf.com/contest/ (the âCompetitionâ for which each participant submission is a âSubmissionâ). This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect when you access or use, solely in connection with the Competition, our website, located at https://kotlinconf.com/contest or other online products and services that link to this Privacy Policy, submit a form in connection with the Competition, or otherwise participate in the Competition (collectively, our âServicesâ).\n\nWe may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the bottom of this policy. We may also provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to the Services or sending you a notification), such as in connection with making material changes to this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.\n\nPlease note that, as part of our Services, we may link to certain third-party websites and offerings (collectively, the âThird Party Servicesâ) that are not covered by this Privacy Policy. As part of the Competition, you may be asked to submit information to Third Party Services, such as GitHub. For information about how these Third Party Services collect, use, and disclose information about you and what information they may share with others or with Foundation Members, please refer to the Privacy Policy of the relevant Third Party Service.\n\nInformation You Provide to Us\n\nWe collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information directly from you when you fill out a form, submit or post content through our Services or participate in our Competition, communicate with us via third-party platforms, or otherwise interact with us. The types of information about you that we collect include your name, email address, school affiliation, country, an explanation of your background, a link to your Submission, an explanation of your Submission, and any other information you choose to provide.\n\nIn connection with the Competition, information shared with GitHub will be governed by the GitHub privacy policy, available here.\n\nInformation We Collect Automatically\n\nWe automatically collect certain information about your interactions with us or our Services, including:\n\nLocation Information: In accordance with your device permissions, we may collect information about the precise location of your device. You may stop the collection of precise location information at any time (see the Your Choices section below for details).\n\nInformation Collected by Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies: The Foundation Member that hosts the Services may use cookies and/or analytics tools. Further information about this collection and your choices with respect to it is accessible here: JetBrains Privacy Policy.\n\nIf you are located in the European Economic Area (âEEAâ), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your personal data, and this section applies to you.\n\nLegal Basis for Processing\n\nWhen we process your personal data, we will do so in reliance on the following lawful bases:\n\nTo perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., operating the Competition).\n\nWhen we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data to operate our business or protect our interests (e.g., to provide, maintain, and improve our services and communicate with you).\n\nTo comply with our legal obligations (e.g., to maintain a record of your consents and track those who have opted out of marketing communications).\n\nWhen we have your consent to do so (e.g., when you opt in to receive marketing communications from us). When consent is the legal basis for our processing your personal data, you may withdraw such consent at any time.\n\nData Retention\n\nWe store personal data associated with your Submission and the Competition until and unless you request that we delete it unless required by applicable laws to maintain the data. We store other personal data for as long as necessary to carry out the purposes for which we originally collected it and for other legitimate business purposes, including to meet our legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations. For any personal information submitted in connection with the Competition directly to GitHub, see GitHubâs retention policy here.\n\nData Subject Requests\n\nSubject to those certain limitations, you have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you and to receive your data in a portable format, the right to ask that your personal data be corrected or erased, and the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please email us at privacy@kotlinfoundation.org.\n\nQuestions or Complaints\n\nIf you have a concern about our processing of personal data that we are not able to resolve, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Authority where you reside. Contact details for your Data Protection Authority can be found using the links below:\n\nFor individuals in the EEA: https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en\n\nFor individuals in the UK: https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/\n\nFor individuals in Switzerland: https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home/the-fdpic/contact.html\n\nConsumer and Data Subject Requests\n\nThe Kotlin Foundation honors data subject access requests, regardless of the residency or location of the data subject, subject to certain limitation. If you would like to request access to the personal data we hold about you and to receive your data in a portable format, the right to ask that your personal data be corrected or erased, and the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing, please email us at privacy@kotlinfoundation.org."
