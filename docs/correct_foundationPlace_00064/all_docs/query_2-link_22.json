        "text": "Generative AI is changing the way we work, and I've been exploring its potential in my daily life. Here's a recap of how I'm using it to code smarter, empower my family with data insights, and navigate information overload: 👉 Coding like a pro with Gemini Code Assist: - This tool goes beyond autocomplete, generating entire code blocks and functions on demand in my favorite IDEs. - The natural language chat feature is like having a 24/7 coding mentor, guiding me through coding challenges and best practices. [https://lnkd.in/ehKrKNwr] 👉 Empowering my family with data insights using Code Interpreter: - My parents, who run schools in India, can now interact with their data using natural language, thanks to Code Interpreter. - They can ask questions like \"How many students are attending after-school programs?\" and get instant answers, without writing any code. This has uncovered fascinating patterns in their data, leading to better decision-making. [https://lnkd.in/erD-U4T2] 👉 Conquering information overload with Vertex AI Search: -Say goodbye to endless scrolling! Vertex AI Search brings Google-quality information retrieval and answer generation to your data. - It understands your intent through semantic search and natural language processing, delivering highly relevant results. - With transparent source citations, you can trust the information you find. [https://lnkd.in/eUAAtbyP] Generative AI is not just hype – it's a powerful tool that can transform your workflow. Start exploring its potential today! #GenerativeAI #VertexAI #GeminiCodeAssist #CodeInterpreter #VertexAISearch\n\nIn my last couple of posts, I talked about how I'm incorporating generative AI into my coding workflow and empowering my family to uncover insights from their data. In this final post of my series on using Generative AI daily, I want to tackle a common pain point: sifting through mountains of documents. We've all been there, endlessly scrolling through pages to find a specific piece of information. It's overwhelming, to say the least. This is where generative AI can truly elevate your workflow. Introducing Vertex AI Search. Consider it Google Search, but for your data. Vertex AI Search brings Google-quality information retrieval and answer generation directly into your generative AI applications. Here's why this is a game changer: 👉 Vertex AI Search understands you: It leverages semantic search and natural language processing to understand your intent and deliver highly relevant results. It's like having a conversation with your data. 👉Transparency and control: Vertex AI Search cites sources and linking back to the original documents for any generated summaries. Vertex AI Search is a powerful tool that unlocks the full potential of your data. By seamlessly integrating it with your generative AI applications, you can boost productivity and drive innovation. #GenerativeAI #VertexAI\n\nThis is post 2 in my series about how I use generative AI in my day-to-day life. And this one is personal. My parents run schools in India, and they've always relied on my SQL skills to interact with their data. Honestly, they weren't very impressed with the complexity of it all! That's where generative AI swooped in. Now, they're interacting with their data across different spreadsheets using natural language, thanks to Code Interpreter extension on Vertex AI. Imagine them asking questions like: 👉 \"How many students are attending after-school programs?\" 👉\"Which month has the highest attendance?\" 👉\"Show me a chart comparing attendance across different grades.\" And voila - they get answers, without needing to write a single line of code ( and my SQL Scripts 😐 ). This has uncovered some fascinating patterns. We knew monsoon season meant more sick days, but now they see how attendance fluctuates across different grades and subjects throughout the year. It's all about making data accessible and empowering everyone to glean meaningful insights. #GenerativeAI #DataAnalysis #Education #Insights #CodeGeneration\n\n\"How do you actually use generative AI?\" I get asked this a lot, and it's a great question. The potential of generative AI feels limitless, so I thought I'd share how I'm weaving it into my daily workflow. First up: Gemini Code Assist. 💻 👉 This tool has become my coding partner. It doesn't just autocomplete – it generates entire code blocks and functions on demand, right in my favorite IDEs (Visual Studio Code, JetBrains). Plus, it supports 20+ popular languages. 👉 The game-changer is the natural language chat. You can chat with Gemini Code Assist to get answers to your coding questions, or receive guidance on coding best practices. It is like having 24*7 coding mentor.
