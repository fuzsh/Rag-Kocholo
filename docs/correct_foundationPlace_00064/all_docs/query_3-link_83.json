        "text": "Eclipse Jetty provides a highly scalable and memory-efficient web server and servlet container, supporting many protocols such as HTTP/3,2,1 and WebSocket. Furthermore, the project offers integrations with many other technologies, such as OSGi, JMX, JNDI, JAAS, etc. These components are open source and are freely available for commercial use and distribution under both the EPL2 and Apache2 licenses.\n\nThe Eclipse Jetty project, a powerhouse in the open-source web server and servlet container realm boasts a robust codebase and a wealth of knowledge readily available through its official blogs. These blogs serve as a vibrant hub for developers of all levels, offering insights, technical deep-dives, and practical guidance on navigating the world of Jetty.\n\nJetty has been used in various projects and products in development and production for over 20 years. Developers have long loved Jetty due to its history of being easily embedded in devices, tools, frameworks, application servers, and modern cloud services. Jetty serves the primary applications for billion-dollar companies, lurks in many cloud services, and has been involved in missions to Mars and on devices floating in the oceans of Earth. We are continuously astounded at the places where Jetty has appeared.\n\nMany documentation resources are available, including an operations guide and a programmerâ€™s guide, all accessible from the Documentation page."
