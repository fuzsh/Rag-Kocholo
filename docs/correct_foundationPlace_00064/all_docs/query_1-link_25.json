        "text": "Anastasia is a Researcher at Machine Learning Methods in the Software Engineering Lab at JetBrains Research. She is an experienced Kotlin developer and is highly involved in the Kotlin community. She is the main contributor of the Reflekt project, a plugin for the Kotlin compiler that enables compile-time reflection. Additionally, Anastasia has authored the Kotlin Onboarding course from JetBrains and has worked on several projects related to static code analysis and code quality in education for the Hyperskill platform. As a Kotlin expert, she also teaches both basic and advanced Kotlin at Constructor University in Germany and at Neapolis University in Cyprus.\n\nSuhail holds a PhD in Distributed Systems and an MSc in Parallel and Distributed Computer Systems from VU University Amsterdam. He is a full-time lecturer at Constructor University. With a diverse experience of 15+ years in research and development, university-level teaching, industry, entrepreneurship, and project management, he established skills in the development of scalable and dependable complex system software, internet of things, high-performance computing, and more recently (last five years) in Machine(Deep) Learning and data science.\n\nDuring your first year, you'll delve into foundational courses in mathematics and programming, including the Kotlin programming language. During this year, you will also have the opportunity to explore various disciplines dedicated to your intended major. It's worth noting that you can still adjust your major choice at the beginning of your second year.\n\nComplete your application on Constructor University's website. All applicants are considered for the JetBrains scholarship. Be sure to submit your application to the program by March 1 to be considered in the first wave, or by May 1 to be considered in the second. A message with further instructions will be sent to the email address you used while registering. Once Constructor University has confirmed that your application is complete, you will receive your regular admission decision within 2â4 weeks. In the meantime, you will be asked to complete the SDT JetBrains Scholarship Test as part of your application for the scholarship.\n\nYou will receive an email with an exclusive link to your test. The test is available until March 7 for the first wave and May 9 for the second. Once you begin, you will have 4 hours to complete it. Though the scholarship test will differ from the one used in 2023, you may still benefit from reviewing the 2023 version. Depending on the results, you may be asked to participate in an interview. You can take the SDT JetBrains Scholarship Test while waiting for the regular admission decision. Please note that participating in the scholarship test and the interview does not guarantee admission to the program.\n\nYou can find list of topics, used for the preparation of assignments for the test and interview here. The test will be held on the Cogniterra platform. This training course explains rules, shows how the testing system works, and teaches how to submit answers correctly.\n\nThe applicants with the best scholarship test scores will be invited to participate in an interview. The interview is a conversation with the organizers and teachers of the program. During the roughly 40-minute conversation, we will discuss your motivation and previous experience, and weâll ask you to complete a few short tasks in the field of mathematics and programming. There is no need to be afraid: the questions and tasks will be offered based on your reported experience.\n\nYou should receive a decision within about three weeks of the interview. For those who apply by March 1, the decision will be made by April 1. For those who apply in the second wave, the decision will be made by May 31. Please note that even if you do not pass the test and/or interview, you can still join the SDT program and have access to university's regular financing options."
