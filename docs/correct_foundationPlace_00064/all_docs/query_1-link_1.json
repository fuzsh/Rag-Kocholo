The company created the Kotlin programming language, which can run in a Java virtual machine (JVM), in 2011.\n\nInfoWorld magazine awarded the firm \"Technology of the Year Award\" in 2011 and 2015.[7][8]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nJetBrains, initially called IntelliJ Software,[9][10] was founded in 2000 in Prague by three Russian software developers:[11] Sergey Dmitriev, Valentin Kipyatkov and Eugene Belyaev.[12] The company's first product was IntelliJ Renamer, a tool for code refactoring in Java.[5]\n\nIn 2012 CEO Sergey Dmitriev was replaced by Oleg Stepanov and Maxim Shafirov.[13][14]\n\nIn 2021 The New York Times stated that unknown parties might have embedded malware in JetBrains' TeamCity CI/CD software that led to the SolarWinds hack and other widespread security compromises.[15] In a press release, JetBrains said they had not been contacted by any government or security agency and had not \"taken part or been involved in this attack in any way\".[16] The CEO of one of the affected companies, SolarWinds, \"asked about the possibility that software tools made by JetBrains, which speeds the development and testing of code, was the pathway, Mr. Ramakrishna said there was still no evidence\".[17]\n\nIn response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the company suspended sales and R&D activities in Russia indefinitely as well as sales in Belarus.[18][19] JetBrains' Russian legal entity was liquidated on 21 February 2023.[20]\n\nEffective 1 February 2024, Kirill Skrygan replaced Max Shafirov as CEO.[21]\n\nProducts[edit]\n\nIDEs[edit]\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of integrated development environments (IDEs) distributed by JetBrains.\n\nName Description Android Studio Made with cooperation of Google for the Android programming tools. AppCode Supports programming in C, C++, Objective-C and Swift. Unlike most JetBrains products, that are cross-platform, AppCode is only available for macOS. JetBrains announced that AppCode is being sunsetted but received technical support until 31 December 2023.[22] Aqua A test automation IDE that supports unit tests, UI tests and API tests. CLion CLion (pronounced \"sea lion\") is a C and C++ IDE for Linux, macOS, and Windows integrated with the CMake build system.[23][24] The initial version supports GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and Clang compilers and GDB debugger, LLDB and Google Test.[25] DataGrip A database administration tool for SQL databases. Other data stores are also accessible via plugin functionality. DataSpell A data science tool for Jupyter Notebooks and Python.[26] Fleet Lightweight multi-purpose IDE, with support for collaboration and remote workflows.[27] GoLand For Go development.[28][29] IntelliJ IDEA For Java virtual machineâ€“based languages such as Java, Groovy, Kotlin, and Scala. An open-source version is available under the name IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, and a proprietary version as IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition. PhpStorm For PHP.[30] PyCharm For Python. An open-source version is available as PyCharm Community Edition, and a proprietary version as PyCharm Professional Edition.[31] For students JetBrain has also developed PyCharm Education.[32] Rider For .NET (primarily C# and F#) development[33] and game development with Unity (C#) and Unreal Engine (C++)[34] RubyMine For Ruby and Ruby on Rails. RustRover For Rust. WebStorm For web, JavaScript and TypeScript development. Many of JetBrains's other IDEs include the feature set of WebStorm via plugins. Writerside Technical writing IDE.\n\nProgramming languages[edit]\n\nKotlin is an open-source, statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine and also compiles to JavaScript or native code (via LLVM).[35] The name comes from the Kotlin Island, near St. Petersburg.[citation needed]\n\nJetBrains MPS is an open-source language workbench for domain-specific languages (DSLs).\n\nKtor is a Kotlin-based programming framework for developing \"connected applications\", using the same framework on both server (JVM) and client (JavaScript, Android, and iOS).[36]\n\n[edit]\n\nTeamCity is a continuous integration and continuous delivery server developed by JetBrains. It is a server-based web application written in Java. The New York Times reported that TeamCity may have been used by Russian hackers of US governmental and private agencies, in potentially \"the biggest breach of United States networks in history\".[15]\n\nUpsource is a code review and repository browsing tool supporting Git, GitHub, Mercurial, Perforce and/or Subversion repositories from a central location. JetBrains released a new developer collaboration tool, Space, in 2019.[37][38] It began sunsetting Upsource in 2022, officially ending support for the product in January 2023.[39] In May 2024, a rebranding from Space to SpaceCode is initiated for the platform to focus on Git hosting and code reviews.[40]\n\nYouTrack is a proprietary, commercial web-based bug tracker, issue tracking system, and project management software developed by JetBrains. As of April 2023, YouTrack has a ticket-based helpdesk solution for customer support and service desk processes.\n\nQodana is a code quality analysis tool that uses static code analysis to help with users with code reviews, building quality gates, and the implementation of code quality guidelines.[41] It was publicly launched in July 2023 and can be used with IDEs in JetBrain's ecosystem, has CI/CD pipeline integration, while supporting code analysis in over 60 programming languages.[42]\n\nOthers[edit]\n\nDatalore is a web application for data analysis and visualization, which is focused specifically on the machine learning environment in Python.[43] JetBrains Academy[44] is an online platform to learn programming, including such programming languages as Python, Java, and Kotlin.
