        "text": "Either I'm missing some core concept buried deep within some documentation (Spring, Spring Boot, H2, HSQLDB, Derby, IntelliJ) or I've been staring at this for too long.\n\nI have a Spring Boot project going. Tried using and initializing an H2 DB at first, tried connecting to it in IntelliJ only to realize that I might not be able to easily browse the db without giving up my firstborn child (Connect to H2 database using IntelliJ database client).\n\nSo I moved to DerbyDB. Same thing - db root folder is created in my app, I connect to it in IntelliJ but my tables, that were just created from starting the app are not available to browse.\n\nI even tried SQLite, but support for SQLite is not as good and certain update functions were not available, but I could atleast find my tables in IntelliJ browser!\n\nI just want a simple single file embedded DB that I can use, browse, and play with easily. Any suggestions?!\n\nWhen I run the application, I see that the schema is exported:\n\n2015-07-19 09:37:45.836 INFO 98608 --- [ost-startStop-1] org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport : HHH000227: Running hbm2ddl schema export Hibernate: drop table user_roles if exists Hibernate: drop table users if exists Hibernate: create table user_roles (id bigint generated by default as identity, role_name varchar(255), version bigint, user_id bigint, primary key (id)) Hibernate: create table users (id bigint generated by default as identity, email varchar(255), password varchar(255), username varchar(255), version bigint, primary key (id)) Hibernate: alter table user_roles add constraint FK_g1uebn6mqk9qiaw45vnacmyo2 foreign key (user_id) references users 2015-07-19 09:37:45.849 INFO 98608 --- [ost-startStop-1] org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport : HHH000230: Schema export complete\n\nIn IntelliJ, nothing (using a remote source of jdbc:h2:./test;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE as per heenenee suggestion):\n\nI see some votes to close because its unclear what I'm asking:\n\nHow do I develop applications using H2, HSQLDB, or Derby databases and connect to them with IntelliJ?\n\nTo add to what heenenee mentioned above. If you dont specify AUTO_SERVER only one connection will be permitted to your H2 instance.\n\nI am using spring-boot with spring-data-jpa. Make sure you have @Entity declared for your entities that represent each table(s).\n\nFollowing is my application.yml / application.properties\n\nspring.datasource.url: jdbc:h2:file:/Users/blah[![enter image description here][1]][1]/db/vlad4;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE spring.datasource.username: sa spring.datasource.password: spring: jpa: hibernate: ddl-auto: create #will create schema based on entities show-sql: true\n\nStart your application and import some data into it. Spring boot will automatically import your data if you have import.sql in the classpath ex: /src/main/resources/import.sql\n\nConfigure you IntelliJ like so\n\nIf you are not using IntelliJ download the server/client combo @ http://www.h2database.com/html/download.html extract it and start the browser-based client using:\n\nh2/bin: java -cp h2*.jar org.h2.tools.Server\n\nConnect to your imbedded database by specifying the connection string:\n\nanswered Jan 7, 2018 at 1:16\n\nVladimirVladimir\n\n1,33022 gold badges1212 silver badges1818 bronze badges"
