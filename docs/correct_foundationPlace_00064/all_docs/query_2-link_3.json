        "text": "1.8M\n\nTotal customers in 2019 (free+paid)\n\nCustomers who have been with us 10+ years\n\n8,561\n\nIndividual customers\n\n6,657\n\nBusiness customers\n\nCustomers who have been with us 15+ years\n\n1,092\n\nIndividual customers\n\n1,880\n\nBusiness customers\n\nAt JetBrains, we’ve made the practice of Dogfooding into a way of life. Our development process is designed to be a virtuous circle. We use the tools that we develop, and this gives us valuable experience to help us implement and improve those tools. This practice gives us unique insight about what needs to be changed, improved, or even redesigned. Watch the video to find out more about how we do it!\n\nWe strive to help developers work faster by automating common, repetitive tasks to enable them to stay focused on code design and the big picture. We provide tools to help developers explore and familiarize themselves with code bases faster. Our products make it easy to take care of quality during all the stages of development and to spend much less time on maintenance tasks afterward.\n\nWhichever technologies you use, there's a JetBrains tool to match. JavaScript, .NET, Java, C++, macOS & iOS, Python & Django, PHP, Ruby & Rails, Android, Go, Kotlin, or SQL? No problem!\n\nIDEs\n\nThe first version of IntelliJ® IDEA was released in January 2001 and was one of the first available Java IDEs with advanced code navigation and code refactoring capabilities integrated. IntelliJ IDEA quickly found a place among top tier Java IDEs, collecting many awards along the way to becoming today’s IDE of choice for polyglot programming.\n\nAs a strong proponent of open source, JetBrains made IntelliJ IDEA open source in October of 2009. While RubyMine®, WebStorm®, and MPS were already available at that time, more IDEs based on the IntelliJ Platform were added over the years, each focused on a particular programming language and related technologies: AppCode®, CLion®, DataGrip®, GoLand®, PhpStorm®, PyCharm®, and JetBrains Rider®. Whatever technology you need, whichever JetBrains IDE you choose, the UI/UX will be familiar and keep you in the flow.\n\n.NET & Visual Studio Tools\n\nReSharper®, the award-winning Visual Studio Extension for .NET Developers, launched in 2004 and laid the groundwork for future .NET and Visual Studio tools: ReSharper C++, dotCover®, dotMemory®, dotPeek®, and dotTrace®.\n\nThe latest addition to this family of tools is Rider, a fast and powerful cross-platform .NET IDE for developing .NET, ASP.NET, .NET Core, Xamarin, and Unity applications on Windows, Mac, and Linux. JetBrains Rider is unique in that it is based on the IntelliJ Platform and ReSharper. Rider was JetBrains’ fastest-growing product of 2019, with 98% YoY growth.\n\nLanguages\n\nBoth JetBrains MPS® and Kotlin are open source. JetBrains MPS is a language workbench that allows you to create your own domain-specific languages and has been available since 2009.\n\nKotlin is a statically typed programming language that targets Android, the JVM, JavaScript, and Native and is developed by JetBrains. The project started in 2010 and was open source from the very early stages. The first official 1.0 release was in February 2016. Since then Kotlin has become a first-class programming language for Android and has gained its own annual conference, KotlinConf. In 2019, more than 4M developers edited Kotlin code!\n\nWe know it can be hard to spend so much time working in your IDE, so we have always looked for ways to make it just that little bit more comfortable. In 2012 we brought you the Darcula theme, and in late 2019 we introduced JetBrains Mono – a new typeface made specifically for developers. It began to make its way into our IDEs late in the year and will soon be available in all of them. Did we mention that it is open source?\n\nSpeaking of open source, we try to give back to the communities that have done so much for us and developers and have helped everyone progress. We have provided 4.8 million complimentary licenses over the years through open source sponsorships, student licenses, and user group and developer recognition programs.\n\n\"I started using JetBrains Marketplace in 2019 and I really like how they take all responsibilities of payment processing (especially payments from companies) and how easy it is to prepare a plugin for selling on JetBrains Marketplace. All questions quickly get answered in Slack. Marketplace allows developers to fully focus on development, not sales.\"\n\nAdel Faizrakhmanov, Laravel Idea\n\nKeep evolving together!\n\nAnaconda® is a registered trademark of Anaconda Inc. in the US and other countries.\n\nDrupal® is a registered trademark of Dries Buytaert in the US and other countries.\n\nEpic Games® is a registered trademark of Epic Games Inc. in the US and other countries.\n\nGoogle® and Android&TRADE; are trademarks of Google LLC in the US and other countries.\n\nJoomla!® is a registered trademark of Open Source Matters Inc. in the US and other countries.\n\nNumfocus is a registered trademark of NumFOCUS Inc. in the US and other countries.\n\nTypo3&TRADE; is a registered trademark of Typo3&TRADE; Association e.V. in the US and other countries."
