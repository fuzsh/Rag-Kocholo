CrowdStrike released a software update for its Falcon platform, which is used for endpoint protection on Windows systems. This update included a sensor configuration meant to target and neutralize new malicious threats. However, the update contained a logic error that led to system crashes. This resulted in the notorious \"blue screen of death\" appearing on many affected devices. Overview of the Outage - Cause: A faulty driver update for CrowdStrike's Falcon Sensor caused Windows machines to experience the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) and get stuck in recovery loops. - Impact: The outage affected Windows users worldwide, including businesses, airports, and various critical services. Details of the Faulty Update - Software Involved: CrowdStrike‚Äôs Falcon Sensor. - Issue: The driver update triggered BSOD errors in Windows machines, halting operations and causing system crashes. - Resolution: CrowdStrike reverted the faulty update and provided guidance to remove the problematic driver file to restore system functionality. Understanding the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) - Definition: The BSOD is a protective mechanism in Windows operating systems that halts all operations following a critical system error. - Purpose: Prevents further damage and data corruption by stopping the system from running. - Error Reporting: Displays an error code and a brief description of the issue, aiding in diagnosis and troubleshooting. CrowdStrike, a major U.S.-based cybersecurity and aerospace company, has been linked to the recent global Microsoft outage. The company's stock has dropped significantly due to this incident. What Happened? On July 19, 2024, Microsoft faced a massive global outage, disrupting services across banking, airlines, and other sectors. Users reported issues with Microsoft applications and Windows systems, which failed to start up or function properly. The outage has been described as one of the biggest tech failures in recent years. What is CrowdStrike? CrowdStrike is headquartered in Austin, Texas, and specializes in cybersecurity, including monitoring cyberattacks for companies like Microsoft. The recent outage is reportedly tied to a problem with CrowdStrike's systems, leading to a major hit on its stock price. Is CrowdStrike Responsible? While CrowdStrike manages Microsoft's cybersecurity, there are conflicting reports. Microsoft is also looking into whether the issue might be related to its own cloud platform, Azure. Official Statements - CrowdStrike: Clarified that the update aimed to address new cyber threats but inadvertently caused a system crash. They stressed that it was an internal error, not a cyberattack. - Microsoft: Acknowledged the issue, stating that virtual machines running Windows and the CrowdStrike Falcon agent could experience crashes due to the bug. #microsoft #crowdstrike #outage\n\nHello Amazing Engineers ‚ù§Ô∏è Application is open for Sparkathon by Walmart!

At some private engineering college in Noida, women students have secured most of the prestigious and lucrative internships for the upcoming year, including positions at tech giants Google and Microsoft. A viral picture online shows that women have taken nearly all of the best-paying summer internships, leaving just one male student among the top 16. Internship Highlights - Google Internships: Two female students from JIIT secured internships at Google, each earning a stipend of ‚Çπ1.23 lakh. These positions are highly coveted due to the company's global reputation and the valuable experience it offers. - Microsoft Internships: Six female students landed internships at Microsoft, with each receiving a stipend of ‚Çπ1.25 lakh. Microsoft is known for its rigorous selection process, making these positions particularly noteworthy. - Atlassian Internship: The highest-paying internship at Atlassian, offering a stipend of ‚Çπ1.30 lakh, was also awarded to a female student. Atlassian is renowned for its innovative software products and competitive work environment. Viral Reaction The viral photograph, which first appeared on Reddit, displays the top 16 internship offers from JIIT, with a striking majority of them being awarded to female students. Only one male student is included in this list, highlighting a significant gender disparity in the top-tier internships this year. - Criticism and Controversy: Some users expressed frustration, claiming that companies are favoring women to improve their gender ratios and public image. Critics argued that this trend disadvantages men, who are only selected if they are exceptionally needed. One Reddit user commented, ‚ÄúBeing born a man is a curse in this country,‚Äù while another added, ‚ÄúCompanies need to maintain their gender ratio to look good in public and maintain their share price. So they take women who are capable enough to join even if they don‚Äôt need them. For men they only select if they really need you.‚Äù An X user wrote, ‚ÄúWhen women achieve something and men prove to be incompetent losers they imply that women have somehow scammed their way to success. Like there‚Äôs no end to their whining and playing victim.‚Äù Another user remarked, ‚ÄúHow the turntables. now you know what women were going through for centuries.‚Äù Broader Implications The debate sparked by this viral post reflects ongoing discussions about gender diversity in the workplace and educational institutions. While some view the increasing presence of women in top internships as a positive step towards equality, others see it as a potential imbalance that needs addressing. This incident also underscores the importance of fair and transparent hiring practices that prioritize merit.

End of the day, it is not me who has reached there. It is the support of you people which made me what I am today. I hail from Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, where my academic journey began with challenges, scoring 59.2% in Class 12th and failing twice in IIT JEE. Despite enrolling in a tier-3 college with no support, I persevered through setbacks, including three backlogs and low CGPAs. I faced eleven months of rejections before landing my first job at EY, followed by offers from Capgemini, Amdocs, Nagarro, and Infosys. The lack of support in college and personal challenges motivated me to guide students in similar situations. Achievements like being LinkedIn Top Voice '24, recognized as one of India's Top 200 LinkedIn creators and working as a Software Development Engineer at EY and a Google Cloud Facilitator , my passion for guiding students facing similar challenges drives me along with invitations from top colleges, are testament to perseverance. The ultimate success came when colleges like IITs, NITs, IIITs, VIT, Manipal, and SRM ‚Äì institutions I once dreamed of taking admission and they did not give me admission there ‚Äì invited me as a guest speaker to guide and motivate their students. This full-circle moment is a testament to the power of perseverance and dedication. I've helped many achieve their goals. Seeing my parents' pride and receiving gratitude from students are my true rewards. Thank you for your unwavering support ‚ù§Ô∏è . Today, I am living the life I manifested and worked very hard for. #SuccessStory #grateful #timesquare #billboard\n\nFrom failing IIT JEE ‚Üí Tier 3 College ‚Üí Cracking companies like Amdocs, EY, Nagarro, Capgemini, etc.! My whole journey has been full of ups & downs. üòì But it‚Äôs just not me who had to go through rejections to reach their Dream company. There are many others too. I‚Äôve interacted with many working professionals who had 0 knowledge of Maths & Stats, Deep Learning, ML, etc., but who had made a great switch to the Data Science domain. Despite their preparation, they had to face rejection. Even though rejections after rejections demotivated them, they eventually learned to handle rejections. Here's what they discovered: üëâ Rejections aren't always about us. If you apply for competitive positions, it's easy to be rejected. So, instead of feeling demotivated, get back stronger. Prepare harder. üëâ Make a plan to correct your mistakes and use rejections as fuel for motivation. Remember, you don‚Äôt have to do everything alone. When you receive a rejection, try to figure out what you missed by asking a senior or mentor for help. Fortunately, they made it through and finally, step by step, reached their dream job, with the help of the mentors. Therefore, if you want to get guidance from industry veterans as well as Bosscoder Academy, I recommend taking this course. Check them here: https://bit.ly/45ZAv8I They can help you with - ‚úÖ Structured curriculum to learn Machine Learning, Generative AI, Data Visualization and more. ‚úÖ Personal Guidance from Data Analysts / Scientists working in Google, Samsung etc. ‚úÖ Multiple projects for SQL, Python etc. to build portfolio. P.S. Personal Placement Support also provided. #sponsoredpost #collab #failures #career"
