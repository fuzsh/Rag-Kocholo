        "text": "You can opt for using git tfs, locally you can still use Git and all of the advantages you're used to. And then push from git to TFVC. You'll need to install Team Explorer or the Team Explorer Cross Platform Commandline Tools.\n\nOr you can use the native plugin for, thelatest version of the TFS / Azure DevOps (Server) plugin can be found on the Jetbrains site. It requires TFS 2015 or newer. You can use the plugin you found for older versions of TFS.\n\nA good explanation to get started can be found here. The part to configure TFVC is replicated below.\n\nVisual Studio Team Services plugin and TFVC\n\nBefore starting with TFVC, we need an external tool. The tool in question is TF command line tool. It ships with the Microsoft Team Explorer Everywhere 2015 and you can download it here.\n\nThe file we are interested in is TEE-CLC-14.0.3.zip. Download it and unzip it in a folder of your choice. You should end up with something similar to this.\n\nNow, open the command prompt, move into the folder where you have extracted the TF command line tool and run the following:\n\ntf eula /accept\n\nIf command succeeded and you havenâ€™t received any error, you are good to go.\n\nNow back to IDEA. Open the settings panel.\n\nand move to Version Control -> TFVC pane. In the select path to executable field, enter the exact path to the tf.cmd command file located in TF command line tool folder.\n\nOnce done, press the test button and you should see the following message\n\nConfirm all of the open windows and get back to the IDEA welcome page. Now you are ready to choose Team Services TFVC (Preview) version control.\n\nAt this point, same as for Git, you will be prompted about the connection towards your TFS. The following dialog will be shown.\n\nMove to the Team Foundation Server tab and specify the address of your TFS server, then click connect. You will now be prompted for the credentials and if everything is ok, you will be shown the list of available TFVC repositories.\n\nYou can now create a new workspace directly from IDEA and start working with your TFVC repositories."
