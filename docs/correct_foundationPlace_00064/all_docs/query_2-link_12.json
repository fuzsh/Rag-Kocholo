        "text": "News\n\nPlease also see update from Dec 6th 2022: Update on JetBrainsâ€™ Statement on Ukraine\n\nWe have already made our position very clear in regard to the invasion of Ukraine. We condemn the attacks of the Russian government, and we stand with the Ukrainian people, including our own colleagues and their families.\n\nToday we are announcing that we will be suspending sales and R&D activities in Russia indefinitely. Sales in Belarus are also suspended indefinitely.\n\nJetBrains was founded in Prague, Czech Republic, 22 years ago. Over the years we have continued to expand our offices to other countries, setting up R&D centers in St. Petersburg, Boston, Munich, Amsterdam, and other locations. The decision to suspend our operations in Russia has been the most difficult one JetBrains has ever made. It affects us as a company, and more importantly, affects our people. However, we cannot ignore what is happening. It goes against the values that this company has always stood for.\n\nMany of our colleagues from Russia have already moved elsewhere, and we will support them, as we will all our employees.\n\nWe are committed to our employees and our customers, and we will continue to build the best developer and team products we can.\n\nThank you."
