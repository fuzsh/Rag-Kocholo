        "text": "The Kotlin programming language was developed by JetBrains with coding performance, code safety, and developer satisfaction in mind. Since its release in 2011, Kotlin has become a favorite language of developers and has replaced Java in many projects.\n\nIn this in-depth guide, we look at Kotlin developer hiring options and their average salaries and share interviewing tips. We also discuss the benefits of using the language and how world-renowned companies have incorporated Kotlin into their projects.\n\nWhat Is Kotlin Used For\n\nKotlin is a simple and type-safe language that supports asynchronous programming techniques and is used for mobile app development, web front-end development, server-side applications, and data science.\n\nAndroid Development\n\nDue to Kotlin’s popularity, Google increased support for the language in 2019, making it the preferred language for Android app developers. Android Studio, Google’s Android operating system IDE, officially started supporting Kotlin with Android Studio 3.\n\nServer-side Applications\n\nKotlin supports type-safe builders and delegated properties. These innovative language features help build easy-to-use abstractions.\n\nThe coroutines in Kotlin help create server-side applications that scale to a huge number of clients with modest hardware requirements. Kotlin also supports the gradual migration of large codebases from Java to Kotlin. The team can start writing new code in Kotlin while keeping the older parts of its system in Java.\n\nWeb Front-end Development\n\nKotlin/JS allows developers to write type-safe React applications using the Kotlin-wrappers maintained by JetBrains. These subroutines provide convenient abstractions and deep integrations for React and other JavaScript frameworks. In addition, Kotlin/JS interoperability with the JavaScript ecosystem allows teams to use third-party React components and component libraries.\n\nKotlin for Data Science\n\nKotlin integrates with interactive editors, such as Jupyter Notebook and Apache Zeppelin to help engineers explore and visualize data, share findings with the team, or develop skills in data science and machine learning.\n\nThe Kotlin community also created an ecosystem of libraries for data-related tasks such as mathematical operations over multidimensional arrays, training deep learning models, and natural language processing.\n\nMulti-platform Mobile Development\n\nKotlin Multiplatform Mobile SDK helps engineers to maintain a single codebase for networking, data storage, analytics, and algorithms of Android and iOS apps. Teams can also use Kotlin as a single language for both cross-platform and native applications because Kotlin syntax follows the same concepts used in iOS development.\n\nAdvantages of Kotlin\n\nKotlin is a modern, concise, and safe language\n\nIt combines all the best bits of imperative, object-oriented, and functional programming. The language has a modern syntax and some new ideas like coroutines it brings to current Java web development.\n\nKotlin is clean and more readable as JetBrains estimates indicate approximately a 40% cut in the number of lines of code compared to Java. It also features various type systems to eliminate problems such as NullPointerException.\n\nCompatible with the Java ecosystem\n\nKotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and developers can easily call existing Java code from Kotlin, as well as Kotlin code from Java. This makes adoption much easier and less risky.\n\nMoreover, developers can use both Kotlin and Java sources in the same project in IntelliJ IDEA. The IDE also includes a plugin that automatically converts Java files to Kotlin.\n\nKotlin is multiplatform\n\nMultiplatform developers will focus more on building a product on different platforms than on learning different languages. They can use Kotlin Multiplatform to share the same code across Android, iOS, and web applications. This will reduce the amount of business logic coded by front-end developers and minimize coding and testing efforts.\n\nCommunity support\n\nKotlin is an open-source language with over 450 contributors, including 90 JetBrains developers. It evolves with the help of its vibrant community, which includes 200 Kotlin User Groups, 37,000 Kotlinlang Slack users, and other members spread across Kotlin’s forum, subreddit, and YouTube channel.\n\nAre Kotlin Developers in Demand?\n\nKotlin is the 6th most wanted technology according to the 2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey involving 71,000 respondents. The survey also shows that the median yearly salary for Kotlin programmers rose from $55,000 in 2021 to $69,000 in 2022.\n\nSince 2019, Kotlin has also been one of the top 20 languages, according to RedMonk, which compiles the rankings based on GitHub pull requests and Stack Overflow discussions.\n\nHowever, demand for Kotlin developers does not only depend on the language knowledge. It is more critical to have engineering experience that will help programmers become intuitive about designing. Companies will prioritize developers who are relevant to their field and are interested in solving architectural problems, and Kotlin will be one of those tools.\n\nIn fact, the language is used by development teams in well-known companies such as Google, Amazon, Philips, and Netflix. Google also made Kotlin a “first class” language for developing Android applications.\n\nExpertise Required from Kotlin App Developers\n\nExperience\n\nSenior Kotlin developers should have a solid foundation in the language, as well as extensive experience in Java and Android-based development. They must have a thorough understanding of object-oriented programming concepts and their implementation, and a proven track record of frequent software delivery to production. They should also be highly knowledgeable about the mobile app ecosystem, including front-end components and server-side frameworks.\n\nSome companies also prefer candidates with a bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience in computer science.\n\nTechnical Skills\n\nWhile these may vary depending on project requirements, in general, Kotlin programmers should have the following skills:\n\nStrong knowledge of Kotlin and Java\n\nExperience in Android app development and Android Studio\n\nPractical experience in mobile applications architecture, flow, design, implementation, and deployments to app stores\n\nIn-depth understanding of design fundamentals, object-oriented programming concepts, and architecture principles\n\nFamiliarity with Agile development concepts, CI/CD pipelines, and DevOps practices\n\nUnderstanding of version control systems and platforms\n\nSoft Skills\n\nCompanies typically expect software developers to be self-disciplined, open to feedback, continually strive for improvement and have good communication skills.\n\nBeing a great team player makes a developer’s job more exciting and makes people more likely to help them in the future. In addition, being able to empathize with the team allows them to predict how others are likely to react, meaning that the developer can tailor how they communicate with others. Coming up with new ideas is much easier when there is an understanding between team members, when no one expects negative feedback or mockery, no matter how someone feels about an idea.\n\nDevelopers should also be able to speak clearly and confidently, listen actively, and avoid interrupting others. These qualities are usually a sign that the developer is an effective communicator — a characteristic that an employer may have already noticed during the interview.\n\nWhere to Hire Kotlin Developers\n\nEmployers can use different models for hiring Kotlin developers: freelance, in-house hiring, project outsourcing, or hiring a contractor. In this section, we’ll take a look at the highlights of each model.\n\nDepending on the hiring model, we also suggest a list of groups, job boards, and communities for Kotlin engineers. These links will guide employers on where to post jobs, find contractors, or visit communities to connect directly with the most active users.\n\nFreelance\n\nHiring freelancers is suitable for short-term projects, small tasks, and companies with limited budgets. In contrast to in-house engineers and contractors, freelancers are often responsible for several jobs, and the quality of their output could be subpar to that of a client’s specifications. Furthermore, because these developers are often juggling multiple projects, employers don’t have the same control over a freelancer as they do with a contractor or in-house employee.\n\nCompanies can browse profiles, post a job, or let recruiters handpick Kotlin engineers on Upwork.\n\nIn-house Hiring\n\nTech companies hire full-time, in-house employees to build their core team and culture. In addition, in-house staff members tend to be more motivated — they explore a product in detail because they are committed to developing it and growing the company.\n\nCompanies can hire in-house engineers by hosting or attending hackathons and tech conferences. They can also request an in-house engineer from a headhunter.\n\nFinally, employers search their local market by utilizing their HR services. For example, browsing LinkedIn profiles, searching for talent in communities, or posting a Kotlin engineer job on an online board is a good starting point.\n\nRemember, though, job boards were invented during the Great Depression when millions of people were out of work and there was a talent surplus. There is no talent surplus in today’s job market, so simply posting a job opening may not attract the most desired professionals.\n\nIn-house Hiring: Job-boards\n\nGlassdoor for employers\n\nIndeed for employers\n\nStartup jobs on Angel.co\n\nCommunities and Groups\n\nOfficial Kotlin community portal\n\nKotlin user groups on the Awesome Kotlin portal\n\nKotlin groups on Meetup\n\nProject Outsourcing\n\nTech companies use this hiring strategy when focusing on their core business aspects by assigning entire projects to outside development services managed by their CTO or product owner from the in-house team.\n\nOutsourcing companies, like any employer, carry risks; however, they are much more selective, unlike freelance platforms. However, outsourcing limits communication between the company and external providers as you will not manage each member of the extended team directly.\n\nEmployers can browse software development companies on Clutch or GoodFirms.\n\nHiring a Contractor (Staff Augmentation)\n\nStaff augmentation on-demand uses full-time employed software engineers from outsourcing agencies. However, unlike assigning or handing over an entire project to an outsourcing company, employers manage remote developers and communicate with them directly.\n\nAlso, employers don’t need to bother with retirement contributions or paying for health insurance, bonuses, vacations, office rental, or workstations as they do for in-house employees. The hiring process, in this case, is faster since the developers are already employed, their skills and experience are verified, and the company does not need to talk about the benefits package.\n\nCompanies can hire contractors with Kotlin expertise on YouTeam.\n\nBrowse 500+ Dev Teams Available for Hire\n\nKotlin Developer Salary\n\nAccording to the 2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, the average annual salary for Kotlin programmers is $69,000. This number includes bonuses and benefits before taxes and deductions.\n\nKotlin Developer Salaries are Location Dependent\n\nWe’ve compiled information on the average salaries of Kotlin engineers on Glassdoor. Please note that the platform took into account the earnings of engineers with varying degrees of expertise, meaning that actual salaries may differ from case to case.\n\nThese numbers represent the median incomes as reported by Glassdoor’s proprietary Total Pay Estimate model based on salaries collected from platform users. Wages in India, the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom consist of a base salary and additional pay, which may include a cash bonus, commission, tips, and profit sharing.\n\n*According to Glassdoor\n\nKotlin Contractor Hourly Rates\n\nThe above table is more relevant for companies that plan to hire in-house and are interested in annual salaries. However, if you are open to remote work and are considering hiring a contractor, this section contains developer hourly rates in different countries.\n\n*According to YouTeam\n\n*According to YouTeam\n\nFreelance Kotlin Developer Rates\n\nWe have collected information about the average rates for Kotlin mobile and web app developers on Upwork.
