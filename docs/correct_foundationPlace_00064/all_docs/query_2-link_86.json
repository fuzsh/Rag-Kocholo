        "text": "I have an existing Java project using Maven for building in IntelliJ IDEA. I am looking to add several new classes to this project that will be implemented using C++ and JNI native methods. How should I configure my IDE and build tools to make this work? I'm open to changing from Maven to another build tool if it makes it easier, although I admit I have previously found Gradle confusing and would rather avoid it unless it would make a substantial difference.\n\nAlso are there any plugins or other modifications that will improve the experience of editing C++ files in IntelliJ IDEA? I'm aware that there was once a third-party C++ plugin that is no longer supported in recent versions of IDEA, but is there another way of doing this?\n\nFor clarification as stated in the comments, I am not specifically looking for off-site resources. I am happy to accept any solution that allows me to work on a mixed Java/C++ project using JetBrains products. As only a small portion of my project is in C++, I do not need complete C++ support (e.g. I do not require debugger integration, as I am happy to switch IDEs for such occasionally-used features, but I don't want to have to switch for day-to-day actions such as editing and rebuilding files). If doing so involves installing a plugin then so be it, but as I stated in the comments I have been led to believe that simple Maven configuration changes will allow me to build such a project, but unfortunately the site I found this information on didn't make clear what the changes should be."
