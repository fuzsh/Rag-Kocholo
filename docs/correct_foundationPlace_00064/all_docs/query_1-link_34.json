Apart from fundamental knowledge in computer science, the program offers 3 tracks – programming languages, software development, and machine learning.\n\nThe curriculum allows you to tailor your education to your goals and explore different fields of study. Moreover, the program includes a mandatory internship and study-abroad opportunity in the fifth semester to provide hands-on experience and a global perspective on your career.\n\nAfter 3 years of studies, you’ll have gained a strong foundation in computer science and related disciplines, including programming, mathematics, and machine learning.\n\nСheck out the detailed program overview to learn more about it.\n\nProgram Overview\n\nHow to apply\n\nThe first step to apply for the Software, Data and Technology program is completing your application via the Constructor University website before the application deadline. The university will take some time to process your application and get back to you with the results, which, if you’re successful, will include an admission offer and a link to participate in a programming test. At this point, you are free to accept your admission offer right away or try to get a scholarship from JetBrains.\n\nThere are 2 ways to apply for a scholarship from JetBrains:\n\nParticipate in a programming test\n\nWith your admission offer you will receive a unique link that provides access to the test page. Note that the link is valid for 7 days and gives you 3 hours to complete all the tasks once opened.\n\nShowcase your skills in the Constructor Open Cup\n\nThe Constructor Open Cup is an online programming contest which consists of 10 coding exercises on Codeforces. The event takes place on March 30, 2023. To help you practice, we are also planning to hold a series of online coding exercises March 23–29, 2023.\n\nTo increase your chances of getting a scholarship from JetBrains, you can participate in both the test and the contest. A further interview will be conducted with the winners.
