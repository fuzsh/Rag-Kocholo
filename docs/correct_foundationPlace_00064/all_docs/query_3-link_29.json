For example, projects keep VCS settings, code style spellchecker settings, the list of language injections, and so on. These settings are placed under version control automatically together with your application code when you send it to your VCS.\n\nTo configure project settings, select PyCharm | Preferences for macOS (Ctrl+Alt+S) or File | Settings for Windows and Linux.\n\nIn the Settings dialog, settings that are marked with the icon apply only to the current project. Other settings are global and apply to all existing projects.\n\nIf you want to share project settings between already existing projects, you can use the Settings Sync plugin. You can also export the settings to a ZIP archive and import it later to other IDE instances.\n\nYou can configure project settings not only for the current project, but for all projects that you will create later. This means that you can set the new default settings for your projects."
