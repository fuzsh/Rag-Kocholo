        "text": "We are excited to announce the results of the sixth official annual Python Developers Survey. This work is done each year as a collaborative effort between the Python Software Foundation and JetBrains. Late last year, more than 23,000 Python developers and enthusiasts from almost 200 countries/regions participated in the survey to reveal the current state of the language and the ecosystem around it. (Spoiler alert: Many people are using Python, and 51% are using it for both work AND personal projects.)\n\nhttps://lp.jetbrains.com/python-developers-survey-2022/\n\nWe know the whole Python community finds this work useful. From Luciana Abud, product manager for Visual Studio Code, “Our teams at Microsoft are truly grateful to the Python Software Foundation and JetBrains for orchestrating the Python Developers Survey! The insights we gain allows us to take a data-driven approach to help with prioritizing feature development, addressing pain points, enhancing usability and anticipating future needs. This survey is invaluable in shaping our approach and continuously improving the Python development experience within the VS Code ecosystem!”\n\nWe’d love to hear how you use these numbers, so please share your thoughts on social media, mentioning @jetbrains and @ThePSF with the #pythondevsurvey hashtag. We are also open to any suggestions and feedback related to this survey which could help us run an even better one next time.\n\nThe PSF is pleased to announce its second batch of PSF Fellows for 2023! Let us welcome the new PSF Fellows for Q2! The following people continue to do amazing things for the Python community:\n\nEsteban Maya Cadavid\n\nMartijn Pieters\n\nPhilip Jones\n\nYifei Wang\n\nThank you for your continued contributions. We have added you to our Fellow roster online.\n\nThe above members help support the Python ecosystem by being phenomenal leaders, sustaining the growth of the Python scientific community, maintaining virtual Python communities, maintaining Python libraries, creating educational material, organizing Python events and conferences, starting Python communities in local regions, and overall being great mentors in our community. Each of them continues to help make Python more accessible around the world. To learn more about the new Fellow members, check out their links above.\n\nLet's continue recognizing Pythonistas all over the world for their impact on our community. The criteria for Fellow members is available online: https://www.python.org/psf/fellows/. If you would like to nominate someone to be a PSF Fellow, please send a description of their Python accomplishments and their email address to psf-fellow at python.org. Quarter 3 nominations are currently in review. We are accepting nominations for Quarter 4 through November 20, 2023.\n\nAre you a PSF Fellow and want to help the Work Group review nominations? Contact us at psf-fellow at python.org."
