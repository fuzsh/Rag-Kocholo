        "text": "The popularity of Python programming language refuses to die. First introduced in the year 1991 and created by a Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum, Python has undergone many improvements over the years to emerge as a programming language of choice.\n\nSuch is the popularity of Python that this high-level programming language was listed as #2 on the 2018 Stack Overflow Developer Survey.\n\nAnother survey has validated the popularity of Python Programming Language amongst the developer community across the world. Over 9500 developers in more than 150 countries participated in this joint Python Developer survey conducted by the Python Software Foundation and JetBrains. Here are some of the key findings from the survey:\n\n#1. What do developers use Python for?\n\nThe survey revealed that 4 out of 5 programmers used Python as their primary programming language and only 21 percent used it as a secondary language. Half of all the developers who used Python as the main language also used JavaScript as a secondary language.\n\n#2. Is Data Science taking the world of Python by storm?\n\nWhile the 26 percent number corresponding to developers who used Python for web development appears higher but if we club machine learning and data analysis in to “data science” the resultant number is higher i.e. 27 percent. These numbers were 38 percent for web developers and 21 percent for data scientists in a similar survey carried out last year. These numbers establish an ongoing trend towards developers preferring to become Python data scientists.\n\nRespondents to this survey were also asked an interesting question on what they thought would be the composition of Python web developers versus the ones into data science. Here’s what emerged:\n\nWeb developers: Data scientists\n\n1:10 – 5%\n\n1:5 – 13%\n\n1:2 – 15%\n\n1:1 – 11%\n\n2:1 – 18%\n\n5:1 – 25%\n\n10:1 – 14%\n\nThe highest percentage turns out to be 5:1 where survey respondents believed that more people were using Python for web development instead of data science. Overall, there were as many as 57% survey respondents who believed the percentage of web developers using Python vis-à-vis data scientists using Python. Only 33% felt that the number of Python data scientists outnumbered Python web developers.\n\nThis finding points to a growing misconception amongst the developer community that web development is where Python programmers are being used the most today which was true a few years ago, not today! There is a huge demand for Python data scientists and developers are adapting to this new trend and using their Python programming skills to advance in the field of data science.\n\n#3. The version of Python in use: Python 3 v Python 2\n\nA similar survey carried out in 2016 had revealed that 60% developers were using Python 2 as against 40% using Python 3. However, in this year’s survey the ratio has tilted in favour of Python 3 with 75% using it versus just 25% using Python 2 as the main interpreter.\n\nIt was found in this survey that one of the main reasons why developers are still using Python 2 is because they still have lot of legacy code to consider before transitioning to Python 3. However, the transition to Python 3 is happening real fast and come 2020 we will see Python 2 fade into oblivion completely because it will no longer be actively maintained.\n\n#4. What tools do Python developers use?\n\nDjango emerged as the most popular framework being used by Python developers with 41% of developers preferring it.\n\nJupyter Notebook turned out to be one of the most popular technologies used in conjunction with Python. Docker, a tool used to create, deploy and run applications using Containers emerged a close second.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) was the preferred cloud computing platform with 67% of developers preferring it.\n\nSome of the top tools and features in use by Python developers include code autocompletion, code refactoring, writing unit tests, and using virtual environments for Python projects.\n\nMost popular tool in the JetBrains Python Developer Survey turned out to be PyCharm (both editions). Other popular tools include: Sublime, Vim, IDLE, Atom and VS Code.\n\nMost popular IDE and Editors for Data Scientists was Jupyter Notebook where 42% developers opted for it and for Web Developers it was Sublime Text where 47% responded in favour of it.\n\nFrequency of Editor usage: 77% of developers who participated in this survey said that they use the Editor on a daily basis.\n\nIt was also revealed in the survey that Data Science and Machine Learning are the fastest growing segments in Python. There is no dearth of job opportunities for Python developers as well. In fact, according to a study by Edvancer titled, “Analytics and Data Science India Jobs Study 2017”, Python emerges as the second most sought-after skill at 30% of all analytical jobs where Python professionals are required.\n\nIf you haven’t already, now is the time to learn Python programming language or think on the lines of how to become a data scientist in India.\n\nhttps://techgig.com/generateHttpWebService-v2.php?tgtype=SAVE_NEWS_READ_LOGS&news_id=65529329&news_title=JetBrains Python Developers Survey: Key Takeaways&news_sec=Technology&tags=Survey, Stack Overflow, python, programming language, JetBrains, &news_url=https://content.techgig.com/technology/jetbrains-python-developers-survey-key-takeaways/articleshow/65529329.cms&ppuserinfo="
