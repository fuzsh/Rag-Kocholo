        "text": "DESCRIPTION LAST UPDATED: 2024-06-19\n\nDEFAULT SEVERITY LEVEL: CRITICAL\n\nThis report identifies hosts that have the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) service running on some port that may have a vulnerability.\n\nWe typically focus on pre-auth RCE vulnerabilities (or vulnerabilities that can be chained together by attackers to remotely execute code) in critical or otherwise popular software that is often exposed to the public Internet. We strongly recommend reviewing any system (and your network!) for signs of compromise if you receive a report from us. This is because many of these are known to be actively exploited in the wild. You should also make sure to proceed to mitigate the vulnerability based on the current vendor recommendations.\n\nIt currently focuses on the following vulnerabilities:\n\nZimbra Communication Suite – a CVE-2022-37042 vulnerability discovered by Volexity (blog published 2022-08-10) that allows for remote code execution, and has been exploited in the wild since at least June 2022. This vulnerability was patched in Zimbra releases ZCS 9.0.0 Patch 26 and ZCS 8.8.15 Patch 33, July 28th,2022. If you receive a report on an IP tagged cve-2022-37042 it is likely you are vulnerable to this exploit and possibly already compromised (which may involve a webshell being installed by an attacker). Please note we are making this assessment entirely on the ZCS build time, and tagging all versions earlier than 2022-07-26 build time as vulnerable. Hence, there is a possibility of false positives.\n\nHTTP hosts that implement Basic Authentication in plain HTTP. This is a security risk as credentials are transmitted in cleartext, without encryption. Enforce the use of HTTPS instead. Instances found will be tagged basic-auth in the report message. Note these are classified as severity MEDIUM, lower than the report default\n\nExposed .git folders. We scan every IPv4 for with a GET /.git/config query. The tag in this case is git-config-file. For an overview of security risks associated with .git exposure and what actions you can take to mitigate the risk, please read “Unprotected .git folders on the internet pose a security risk” by NCSC CH.\n\nVulnerability in the Oracle Access Manager product of Oracle Fusion Middleware (component: OpenSSO Agent), tagged as cve-2021-35587 allowing for unauthenticated remote code execution. If you get such an alert make sure to apply Oracle’s patches here.\n\nLikely AMI MegaRAC vulnerabilities – used by multiple vendors – as described in Eclypsium’s post “Supply Chain Vulnerabilities Put Server Ecosystem at Risk”. In this case we scan for exposed Redfish API endpoints, however we are not able to verify if these have been patched and thus not vulnerable anymore (CVE-2022-40259). Nevertheless, these should not be exposed to the public Internet. We tag these as megarac and potential-megarac. The difference in the tags reflects our confidence in identifying the device. If you get an alert make sure to apply your vendor’s latest patches!\n\nFortinet CVE-2022-42475 (CVSS 9.8 RCE) based on Fortinet version scanning (where possible). These are tagged cve-2022-42475. If you get an alert make sure to apply the patch specified in the advisory.\n\nCitrix CVE-2022-27510 (CVSS 9.8 RCE) based on version information parsed from /vpn/index.html. These are tagged cve-2022-27510. If you get an alert make sure to apply the updates specified in the advisory. For additional background please read the Fox-IT article on remotely fingerprinting Citrix ADC and Gateway versions.\n\nVMware CVE-2021-21972 (remote code execution vulnerability in the vSphere Client, CVSS 9.8 RCE). These are tagged cve-2021-21972. Note: this check is version based. If you get an alert make sure to apply the updates specified in the advisory.\n\nMultiple VMware ESXi vulnerabilities: CVE-2021-21974 (CVSS 8.8), CVE-2020-3992 (CVSS 9.8), CVE-2019-5544 (CVSS 9.8) tagged as cve-2021-21974, cve-2020-3992, cve-2019-5544. As of 2023-02-06, it is possible they are being used in ransomware attacks as described in this CERT-FR advisory. Note: this check is version based. It is possible that these services have other mitigations in place. Nevertheless, if you receive an alert, we recommend to apply the latest VMware updates!\n\nJoomla CVE-2023-23752: An improper access check allows unauthorized access to webservice endpoints, affecting Joomla! CMS versions 4.0.0-4.2.7. While this has been given only a CVSS of 5.3, exploitation details are public and trivial, and many of the vulnerable endpoints disclose their actual unencrypted passwords. Make sure to update your Joomla instance as advised in their advisory [20230201] – Core – Improper access check in webservice endpoints. Tagged as cve-2023-23752.\n\nGeoserver CVE-2023-25157 (CVSS 9.8) and CVE-2022-24816 (CVSS 9.8). These are two unauthenticated RCE vulnerabilities in GeoServer, a popular open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. Tagging is based on the version returned for a query for /geoserver/web/. Make sure to apply the latest patches to your Geoserver instance! Tagged as cve-2023-25157 and cve-2022-24816.\n\nJenkins CVE-2023-27898. CVE tagging is based on X-Jenkins header: LTS >= 2.270.0 < 2.375.4 or non-LTS >= 2.270 <= 2.393. Tagged as cve-2023-27898.\n\nFortinet CVE-2023-27997 (a heap buffer overflow in SSL-VPN pre-authentication that can be exploited by remote attackers to execute code or commands). See the Fortinet FG-IR-23097 advisory for Fortinet versions affected and patch information. Tagged as cve-2023-27997. This is a version based assessment. Make sure to apply patches!\n\nPossibly compromised Progress MOVEit Transfer instances with webshells. Tagged as moveit. These will have been breached most likely due to CVE-2023-34362. Read more on the MOVEit vulnerability in the Progress advisory “MOVEit Transfer Critical Vulnerability 31May2023”. Check our Device Identification report for all exposed instances (no vulnerability assessment)\n\nVMware CVE-2023-20892 (vCenter Server contains a heap overflow vulnerability due to the usage of uninitialized memory in the implementation of the DCERPC protocol). Scan is based on VMware versions detected. Tagged as cve-2023-20892\n\nFortinet CVE-2023-33308 (FortiOS/FortiProxy – Proxy mode with deep inspection – Stack-based buffer overflow). This is a version based assessment. Make sure to apply patches! Tagged as cve-2023-33308.\n\nCitrix CVE-2023-3519 (Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway Code Injection Vulnerability). This assessment is version based – that is we tag all IPs where we see a version hash in a Citrix instance. This is due to the fact that Citrix has removed version hash information in recent revisions, including the latest update with the fix. It is thus safe to assume in our view that all instances that still provide version hashes have not been updated and thus, providing no mitigation is in place, remain vulnerable. In addition, we have also added tagged as vulnerable instances that return a Last Modified headers with a date before July 1, 2023 00:00:00Z. Make sure to update as per the Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway Security Bulletin for CVE-2023-3519, CVE-2023-3466, CVE-2023-3467 advisory. Tagged as cve-2023-3519. If you received an alert for your network/constituency or did not patch before July 20th 2023 please read our Technical Summary of Observed Citrix CVE-2023-3519 Incidents for information how to detect and hunt for compromise, including webshells installed by threat actors.\n\nIvanti Endpoint Manager (EPMM), formerly known as MobileIron Core CVE-2023-35078. CVE-2023-35078 is a pre-auth RCE that has been exploited by threat actors against the Norwegian government. Make sure to update to the latest version as per the Ivanti advisory. We also notify of instances possibly vulnerable to an Apache HTTP server vulnerability CVE-2023-25690. Tagged as cve-2023-35078 and cve-2023-25690.\n\nMetabase CVE-2023-38646.
