In 1989, he was honored by the College of Business Administration at the University of South Carolina with their Distinguished Alumnus Award.\n\nJim had an enthusiastic work ethic.

Marcus\n\n1938-2021\n\nBarbara Baker Mallory\n\n1936-2021\n\nFormer Village resident and longtime St. Mary's parishioner Barbara Baker Mallory's funeral will be held at St. Mary's on Friday, September 24th at 4pm. May Barbara's soul, and the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace.\n\nBarbara died peacefully in Palm Beach, FL on May 2nd surrounded by her three children. The eldest daughter of Alice & John D. Baker, Barbara was born in 1936 and was raised in New York City and Buck Hill Falls, PA. She graduated from the Madeira School and Bennett College with a degree in Interior Design in 1956. In 1957 she married Thomas Downs Mallory of Bradford, PA and Palm Beach, FL.\n\nAfter briefly living in New York City following her husband’s U.S. Army enlistment, Barbara and Downs moved to Tuxedo Park, NY in 1964. For the next 35 years they raised three children and enjoyed an active, outdoor lifestyle. Barbara managed her own interior design company; she was one of only a few women at the time in Tuxedo Park to run her own business, Barbara Baker Interior Design, and to use her maiden name in her work. Her projects ranged from Tuxedo Park, and nearby New York City, to Nantucket, Florida, Chicago, Sun Valley, and Jackson Hole. In her community, she became president of the Tuxedo Park Garden Club and eventually the Orange and Dutchess County Garden Club, while also volunteering extensively with the Tuxedo Park Club, St. Mary’s Episcopal Church, and the Hudson Valley chapter of the Nature Conservancy. Perhaps most unique to Barbara was her vigor in sports. On the golf course she was only the 2nd person in Tuxedo Park Club history to win the club championship 5 times. In the fields and streams she was a master wing shooter and gifted fly fisherwoman. She was an amateur mycologist and an outstanding cook of wild game. Barbara was elected into the International Women’s Fly Fishing Association which is composed of the top female anglers worldwide. Downs accompanied her when the group travelled internationally on fishing expeditions to Russia, New Zealand and Patagonia.\n\nIn 1999 Downs and Barbara moved to Wilson, WY and Palm Beach, FL. In Wyoming she continued to hunt and fish while entertaining her many friends and extended family at their beautiful home alongside the Teton Mountains. They enjoyed being members of the Jackson Hole Golf & Tennis Club and played many rounds of golf with friends. In Florida, they reconnected with old friends, enjoyed the Bath and Tennis Club, the Everglades Club, and the Society of the Four Arts while keeping up their sporting life. Like her red hair Barbara was a bold and boisterous mother, grandmother, aunt, godmother, and wife for 61 devoted years. She loved all people, animals and natural things and her indomitable spirit gave her the courage to face her last 11 years with Alzheimer’s. She was not afraid to talk about her disease and helped many people cope with this same diagnosis.\n\nBarbara is survived by her older son Thomas D. Mallory, Jr. of Atlanta, GA; daughter Meredith Mallory George of Darien, CT; younger son Baker D. Mallory of Ridgefield, CT; nine grandchildren; and sisters Alice Cullen of Villanova, PA and Joan Baker of Santa Fe, NM. She is predeceased by her husband Thomas Downs Mallory. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in memory of Barbara Baker Mallory to: Cure Alzheimer’s Fund, 34 Washington St., Suite 310, Wellesley Hills, MA 02481.\n\nback to top\n\nElene de Saint Phalle\n\nMrs. de Saint Phalle passed away on July 21, 2021. She is survived by her four children, Christopher Isles, Geoffrey Isles, Marc de Saint Phalle and Diane Russell.\n\nback to top\n\nVincent R. Capozzi\n\nNovember 18, 1956 – July 3, 2021\n\nVincent (Vinnie) Capozzi passed away peacefully, surrounded by his family, on Saturday, July 3 at Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie. He waged a difficult battle with cancer, which he handled with the same determination, perseverance, and selflessness he handled everything in his life. Despite whatever he was going through, he was always 100% there for his family and friends. Vinnie was born in Poughkeepsie, son of the late Richard and Marie Francese Capozzi. In 1976 in Sheahan Hall on the Marist College campus, he met the love of his life, Honora \"Noreen\" Fennell, with whom he would spend the rest of his life. Vinnie was active in many of Marist's organizations, where he was the General Manager of the Marist College Radio Station, but his true love was working behind the scenes in theatre. He produced two plays for Marist College Children's Theatre and was on call to assist even after graduation in 1978. He was the first recipient of the prestigious Gerald Cox Award for Excellence in Theatre Arts in 1980, and in 2012 was inducted into the Marist College Theatre Hall of Fame. Vinnie had a successful career in the specialty glass industry, and recently retired as the Director of Business Development for Tower Optical. He was an energetic supporter of his community, serving as a longtime Assistant Scout Master for Boy Scout Troop 149 in Woodbury, President of the Tuxedo Men's Book Club, the yearly \"Grill Master\" at the Tuxedo Park Library's Annual Memorial Day Picnic as well as an active member of many of Tuxedo's committees. His passion for cooking for his family was legendary and he took great joy from people gathering and enjoying his delicious meals at his home. His true passion was his family. In 1986 he married Noreen, and they had two children, Christopher and Katharine, who he always let know were his greatest accomplishment. He is survived by Noreen at home; Christopher of Warwick; Katharine of Tuxedo Park; his sister, Celeste Kubala and her husband Jeff of Poughquag, NY; and his many loving brother and sisters-in-law and nieces and nephews. His family would like to thank all his great network of family and friends who have been so supportive, and his wonderful doctors and nurses and medical team for whose dedication they will be forever grateful. Visitation will be from 5-8 pm on Wednesday, July 7 at Smith, Seaman & Quackenbush, Inc. Funeral Home, 117 Maple Avenue, Monroe. A Funeral Mass will be held on Thursday, July 8, 2021 at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, Tuxedo. Cremation took place at Cedar Hill Crematory in Middle Hope, NY. Memorial contributions in Vinnie's name may be made to the Tuxedo Park Library, 227 Route 17, Tuxedo Park, NY 10987\n\nback to top\n\nPatrick W. Welsh IV\n\nback to top\n\nCynthia L. Reese\n\nFebruary 10, 1954 – March 01, 2021\n\nCynthia \"Cindy\" L. Reese of Tuxedo, NY passed away on Monday, March 1, 2021 at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, NY, NY after a short but valiant battle with interstitial lung disease with her close friends Sandy McGrady and JoAnn Martin by her side. She was 67 years old. Born February 10, 1954 in Utica, NY, she was the third of five children of the late Philip and Anna Jaquays Reese. Cindy was a proud graduate from Waterville Central School, Waterville, NY in 1972. Following graduation Cindy worked at Nichol's in the photography department until she obtained a position at Lockheed Martin and General Electric soldering circuit boards. During this time period she also became a freelance photographer for the Waterville Times newspaper in Waterville, NY. When the facility closed Cindy took the advantage to return to school. She attended Mohawk Community College earning an Associate's Degree in Medical Coding. Upon graduating, Cindy worked at several area hospitals, the last one being Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital, Cooperstown, NY as a medical coder and a med/surg unit clerk until moving to North Carolina to further her career. After four years she returned to New York state to assist her friend Sandy in the care of Sandy's mother. Since this move Cindy has had employment with Monroe Taxi as a driver and at the Tuxedo Union Free School district as a greeter, bus monitor, and most recently, proudly as a school bus driver. In all her endeavors, no matter what new challenges Cindy faced she greeted each one with acceptance, a smile which said \"Yes I Can!\" and a willingness to give it her all. She enjoyed participating in many things from bowling and drawing, to photography, to horseback riding, to doing a little karate and bicycle riding, to baking or Bar-B-Qing, to just quietly doing Sudoku or other mind challenging games. However, her greatest love outside of her family was her love of animals particularly dogs, especially Noah her miniature Schnauzer whom she lost last year. Cindy was married to and divorced from the late Larry Windover of Clarks Mills, NY. From this marriage Cindy had one child whom she loved dearly, Sean Windover of Clarks Mills, NY. She is also survived by her two younger sisters Karen Evans of Rome, NY, and Julie Eastman (husband Keith) of Oneida, NY, along with many nieces, nephews, two great nieces, cousins, aunts and uncles. Cindy was not only predeceased by her parents but also by her two older siblings, her brother Corporal William \"Billy\" Reese who was killed in action in Vietnam and Patricia \"Patty\" Goodwin. Cindy's faith carried her throughout her life especially during her challenging illness. She was a member of the United Methodist Church before becoming a member of St Mary's in the Park Episcopal Church in Tuxedo Park, NY. Visitation will be on Saturday, March 20, 2021 from 2-3 p.m. at Smith, Seaman, and Quackenbush, Inc. Funeral Home, 117 Maple Ave., Monroe, NY 10950. A Memorial Service will begin at 3:00 p.m. Interment services will be held at the discretion of the family at Crown Hill Memorial Park, Clinton, NY in the late Spring. Donations may be made in Cindy's memory to the American Lung Association or to the American Diabetes Association.\n\nback to top\n\nStanley C. Stalnacker\n\nStanley C. Stalnaker, 97, passed away on January 3, 2021 at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, and was buried here at St. Mary's today (the service was private due to the current health crisis).

A shining example of an American success story, Wayne was born of humble beginnings on September 24, 1941 in Great Falls, MT, to Aro and June (Hayes) Lyski. As a youth, he enjoyed fishing and hunting trips with his father and brother. Wayne graduated from Foster High School in Tukwila, WA and went on to college at Seattle Pacific University after receiving a basketball scholarship.\n\nWayne’s life would be changed forever when he made his first cross country trek by train to Philadelphia, PA where he would attend The Wharton School for his MBA. It was during this time that he developed a passion for financial markets and was recruited to a training program with RCA that would take him to rotations in Cherry Hill, NJ, Singer Island, FL and ultimately Boston, where he met his wife of 47 years, Barbara Byron. From there, Wayne moved to New York City to work for JP Morgan in the firm’s research department, which propelled him into a successful career in Fixed Income investing.\n\nHe made a name for himself as a leader in the field at Alliance Capital Management, and showed an affinity for emerging markets investing. His role took him around the world, meeting with investors and finance ministers, and building a sterling reputation as one of the brightest stars in the industry. Wayne held a series of positions at the firm, including chairman and chief investment officer of Alliance Capital Management's fixed income division where he was responsible for overseeing the management of approximately $150 billion in fixed-income assets. Upon his retirement from Alliance in 2004, he continued to manage investments for long time clients through 2008. During his career, Wayne was tapped for critical advisory positions and received numerous accolades. He served as a member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee from 1996 to 2004, advising the Secretary and staff of the United States Treasury on the financing and management of federal debt, and in 1998, he was inducted into the Fixed Income Analysts Society's Hall of Fame. Never one to extricate himself from the markets, Wayne kept a Bloomberg terminal in his home office post-retirement and always loved to relive fond memories reconnecting with old business friends from the street.\n\nWayne was a relationship builder, and was known for bringing people together and sharing his passions with ski trips to Deer Valley and golf outings in Tuxedo Park. Always a true Montanan at heart, Wayne’s adoration for open spaces could be found in the places where he gravitated and made his homes. Even when working for decades in NYC, Wayne’s primary home could be found upstate in Tuxedo Park, NY. More recently he had the opportunity to spend parts of the year among the beautiful Wasatch Mountains in Park City, UT and among friends in Fort Myers, FL.\n\nHis grounding force throughout has been his family, he and Barbara raised three children who have been the recipients of unconditional love. Spending weekends coaching ski racing at local mountains during their high school days in the 1980’s and 1990’s, to teaching his grandchildren how to tackle Stein’s Way at Deer Valley in the 2000’s, he was always an involved parent and grandparent and their biggest cheerleader. His life was also touched by tragedy with the loss of his eldest son, Brian, to a car accident in 1994. Through trials and successes, Wayne persevered and was a pillar of strength for his family and continued to build a wonderful legacy for his children and grandchildren.\n\nWhether he was known to you as Grandpa, the Silver Fox, Wayne or Dad, he will be forever remembered for his remarkable life: one of generosity, a loving spirit, an amazing sense of humor and constant encouragement of those he held close.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his son, Brian, parents, Aro and June, and brother Dale and his wife Joyce.

There’s simply no other way to explain the abrupt end to his beautiful life.\n\nSince childhood, Greg was deeply immersed in literature, film and music. His love of the arts combined with his intelligence, wit, charisma, work ethic, oratory gifts and educations at both the Groton School and Columbia University manifested in him, and fashioned an undeniable creative force.\n\nAt every step of his career, Greg was a performer. He started his professional life in New York City as an actor and filmmaker, and eventually found a home in advertising.\n\nFor the last 20 years as Chief Creative Officer of the VIA Agency in Portland, Maine—Greg’s talent, leadership and audacity have well-served many of the world’s most iconic brands. From Sony to Samsung, Pepsi to Welch’s, Greenpeace to The Salvation Army—chances are, you’re familiar with some of Greg’s work.\n\nIn his time at VIA, Greg led the agency onto the national stage by winning marquee pitches, countless awards and, in 2011, Small Agency of the Year (AdAge). He also helmed many pro bono projects that greatly impacted his community. For the last few years, he volunteered his time and talent to Preble Street, a Portland, Maine-based, non-profit providing services to people who struggle with homelessness, hunger and poverty.\n\nGreg loved Bruce Springsteen, R.P. McMurphy, the Sunday Times, crossword puzzles, the “Pats, C’s and Sox,”, little kids, nicknames and the “F” word. But miles above all, he loved his family.\n\nGreg is survived by his parents, James F. and Margaret Frame Smith of Boston, Massachusetts and Kennebunk Beach, Maine. They brought their beloved son into the world on November 10, 1966 in Salem, Massachusetts. Greg is also survived by his sister, Ellen Scott, her husband Stuart and their children Sophie and Juliet of Wellesley, Massachusetts. Greg relished spending time body surfing at Mother’s Beach with his father, teaming up to cook and grill with his mother, and striking up engaging dinner conversation with the “whole gang”. Greg shared a bond with many aunts, uncles, cousins, in-laws, and friends who were more like family to him.\n\nOf all the titles held by Greg, the two he cherished most were father and husband. Greg leaves behind his wife, Emily, of Cape Elizabeth, his eldest son, Nate, of Portland, and his son Elias, a freshman at UC Santa Barbara. His love and appreciation for them were deep and unwavering. Greg’s true pride and joy resided in his time with “Champ, Rip and The Gov”—lazy days on the lake in Oquossoc, coaching his kids’ sport’s teams, legendary meals off his grill (always wood-fire, never propane), night swims, thrills at “The Garden,” philosophical debates, and making everyone laugh until their stomachs (including his own) hurt.\n\nTo sum it all up, the final word goes to The Boss. Greg wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\n“It’s not the time in your life, it’s the life in your time.”\n\n-Bruce Springsteen\n\nA Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at 11 AM Saturday, May 4 at Holy Spirit Parish, St. Martha’s Church, 30 Portland Rd, Kennebunk.

Sonne, 82, died peacefully on March 22 of Alzheimer’s and kidney failure, in the same house in Tuxedo Park where he grew up and lived most of his life. His father, Hans Christian Sonne, a Danish immigrant, was sent to New York to represent a British banking concern in the early ‘20’s. His mother was Carol Mulford Sonne, from Montclair, NJ.\n\nChris graduated as a top student from St. Paul’s School in Concord, NH, and Yale University. He also studied at Columbia University, from which he received a Master of International Affairs and a Certificate from the Russian Institute. He spent a year in Munich, Germany, on a Fulbright Scholarship. His interest in the facts of history knew no bounds. Whatever topic came up, he would be able to tell his listeners something they didn’t know. He also served in the US Army as an artillery officer at Fort Bliss, Texas.\n\nChris was an investment banker for more than 25 years, specializing in the financing of foreign governments and corporations in the US and Eurodollar capital markets for Harriman Ripley, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs. When he left that world, he took an active role in the Tuxedo Park Association, a partnership owning several thousand acres of land in the Town of Tuxedo. He also assumed the oversight of the family-owned 9,000-acre forest property in South Carolina, and served as co-chairman of Highland Forests, a partnership owning 5,000 acres of forest land in the Adirondacks, where his family built a lakeside cabin, enjoyed by all for many years.\n\nAs the Historian of the Town of Tuxedo, and President of the Tuxedo Historical Society, the history of that area in Orange County, NY, became a passion. He was a curator and keeper of the memory of the Town of Tuxedo and Tuxedo Park, one of America’s first planned gated communities, a unique place that in the late years of the 19th century and early years of the 20th century could be called America’s version of Downton Abbey. An offshoot from this interest resulted in a book, Tuxedo Park, The Historic Houses, published in 2007, of which he was co-editor.\n\nIn addition, Chris was always generous with his time and talents in several non-profit organizations. He served as a trustee and Chairman of the Board of Berkeley Divinity School at Yale, a trustee of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, a board member of St. Mary’s Center, an AIDS health care center in New York City, Chairman of the Board of the American-Scandinavian Foundation, and one of two trustees of the Vincent Mulford Foundation, which gave support primarily to organizations which work to alleviate homelessness in New York City and Boston. Chris served for many years on the vestry of St. Mary’s-in-Tuxedo Episcopal Church.\n\nHe was also generous with his physical self, donating one of his kidneys to his son Peter, in 1995, a true act of fatherly love. That kidney had an excellent run for 23 years. Last year it was traded in for a younger version from Peter’s sister, Edie. Chris’ generosity survived, even after death; his brain was sent to the Taub Institute of Columbia University to be used for scientific research on Alzheimer’s Disease.\n\nChris married Sally Barnes, the daughter of a newspaper publisher, from Bristol, CT in 1966, and together they lived in New York, Paris, and finally Tuxedo Park. They raised four children; Peter of Cameron, SC; Nicholas of Bedford, NY, Matthew of Bethesda, MD, and Edie of Seattle, WA.\n\nChris was a keen bird hunter, mainly enjoying the sport at his place in South Carolina. He was an avid hiker, earning the rare distinction of summiting all 113 mountain peaks in New England and New York over 4,000 feet. He was an Adirondack 46’er.\n\nChris was a good-natured gentleman, fair and decent. He was devoted to and proud of his wife and children and grandchildren. He had no pretenses; he could wear a hard hat and wield a chainsaw or don a black tie and dine with royalty. The irony of his life, and death, is that two of the natural gifts he had been given, a big brain and a well-functioning kidney, both weakened and led to his death. He lived life to the fullest, leaving nothing on the table. He will be greatly missed by his family and community. In addition to his wife, Sally, and four children, he leaves twelve grandchildren and a sister, Sheila Pulling, of NYC, along with many nieces and nephews. Two sister, Sophia Campbell of Oxford, England, and Carol Ewing of Millbrook, NY, predeceased him. A memorial service will take place at St. Mary’s-in-Tuxedo on Saturday, April 13 at 11 a.m. Donations in his memory may be made to St. Mary’s-in-Tuxedo Episcopal Church, PO Box 637, Tuxedo Park, NY 10987.\n\nback to top\n\nGregg Carder\n\nVillage resident Gregg Carder passed away on November 5, 2018 at Good Samaritan Hospital, surrounded by family and friends.\n\nGregg and his partner of 43 years, Brad Boles, met in Seattle and have called Tuxedo Park home for the past nine years.

He was an adored father and friend to his four children, Karen Clemons of Ohio, Linda Yassky of Brooklyn, Steven Mason Yassky and Laura Yassky Glynn, both of Upper Nyack, as well as their respective spouses, Tom Clemons, Georges Nahitchevansky, Bonnie Elder Yassky and John Glynn. Alan was also the proud grandfather of Rebecca, Ben, Jon, Vladimir, Nina, Imogene, Hannah and Tyler, and one great-granddaughter, Delaney. He is also survived by his devoted partner Francine Liza, of Tuxedo Park, and his loving sister, Marilyn Prant, of Voorhees, New Jersey. Alan’s adored wife of 53 years, Jean Mason Yassky, passed away in 2008.\n\nAlan Yassky was born and raised in Nyack. A Nyack boy through and through -- he knew the Rockland County of both past and present. He could regal one with stories of swimming in the Hudson River, driving his door-less Model T through Nyack with his high school buddies standing on either running board, and working on a road crew blasting rock to lay the New York State Thruway.\n\nAfter graduating from Nyack High School (1953) and the University of Vermont (1957), Alan entered the Air Force and served for four years in the Office of Special Investigations, rising to the rank of Captain. Alan entered the real estate business in 1962 as a salesperson selling new homes. Alan with his wife Jean, successfully launched Rockland Realty in 1964. As the county grew, so did their business. They eventually expanded its operations to include both residential and commercial sales and leasing. Over fifty years later, Rockland Realty, is still proudly family owned and operated.\n\nOf note amongst a few of Alan’s successful real estate ventures are: the transformation of the former Ramapo Valley Airport into the corporate business park known as Airport Executive Park, in Nanuet; and conversion of Rockland Garden Apartments into elderly and affordable housing units in Nyack. Alan was and is still involved in numerous other major investments throughout Rockland County, as well as interests in North Carolina and Ohio. He was widely admired for his excellent judgment, a quality that served him especially well in his choice of business partners of whom he often remarked he felt blessed to have known. In business and in life he was willing to consider all sides, and never avoided the risky or difficult choice if he believed it was the right one.\n\nAlan was active in both the Rockland County and New York State Boards of Realtors, rising through the ranks to hold the presidency in both organizations. In 1984, he was appointed as a National Director of the National Association of Realtors (NAR), and held the office of Treasurer from 1997 to 2000. In 2003, he received NAR’s Distinguished Service Award, and lifetime member of Realtors Political Action Committee. Alan was a past President of the Spring Valley Rotary Club and was a member of the Board of Directors of The Tuxedo Park Historical Society, The Rockland County Cancer Society, and The Rockland County Housing Coalition. Alan also served as a Chairman of the Clarkstown Industrial Commission and was a Director Emeritus of The Rockland Economic Development. He was a proud member of Trout Unlimited, The Black Meadow Club and Barbers Eddy Club, as well as The Tuxedo Club.\n\nFor the past thirty-three years Alan lived in Tuxedo Park, where he volunteered countless hours managing a variety of special projects for the community including the restoration of the police booth and offices, the repair and rebuilding of the stone wall along Tuxedo Road, and the reworking of the Wee Wah dam.\n\nThe breadth and depth of his knowledge, on a vast range of topics, and his ability to explain just about anything to anyone, were a constant source of wonder and joy for his children and those lucky enough to know him. He possessed boyish good looks, intelligence, charm, a sense of adventure, and an abundance of good will and generosity that made him the best of company. Alan could pilot a boat, fly a plane, cast into the wind while reeling in the big one, hit a moving target, and fix just about anything that involved pipes, nails or wood, often in the most novel ways. He was a gifted public speaker and story teller. He was an amazing negotiator from the days where a handshake meant something up until the day he passed and was always eager to celebrate the accomplishments of others. His level-headed wisdom, good humor and love for his family and friends will be sorely missed.\n\nThere will be a celebration of Alan Yassky’s life on Thursday, June 28, at 11:00 a.m., at St. Mary’s Episcopal Church, 10 Fox Hill Road, Tuxedo Park, New York.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations in his name please be directed to either United Hospice of Rockland, 11 Stokum Lane, New City, NY 10956 / hospiceofrockland.org , or Trout Unlimited PO Box 7400, Woolly Bugger, WV 25438-7400 / www.tu.org Hannemann Funeral Home, Inc.

From the beginning Ingrid was an adventurous and curious child who delighted in exploring her neighborhood, scraping her knees and making friends with every person and animal she met. Ingrid also held a special place in her heart for the education she received from Westfield Friends School in Cinnaminson, NJ. Always creative and stylish, Ingrid went onto attend the Tobe-Coburn School in New York City in her early adulthood. There she studied fashion design and founded many lifelong friendships. It was at this time that Ingrid met and fell in love with Kirby Warren.\n\nIngrid and Kirby were married on June 7, 1958 and went on to establish a beautiful family home in Tenafly, NJ. Together, they created a life that was full of travel, friendship, laughter, and love. They also raised three children, Lynn, Elizabeth and William and through example showed their children how to be responsible, conscientious and caring people. Ingrid’s love for her family and the adventure of life was evident in everything she touched, every house she decorated and her determination for personal growth continued to drive her. As example, Ingrid went on to get an additional degree in Architectural Home Design in NYC. Ingrid had a successful career as a designer and loved nothing more that creating warm and welcoming spaces for her clients, friends and family.\n\nIngrid was also forever bonded to Long Beach Island, NJ. As a child, Ingrid and her family spent many summers on the island. She loved telling stories about sailing on the bay, swimming in the ocean and lifeguarding on the island’s beaches. Ingrid designed her dream home on Long Beach Island in the town of Harvey Cedars, NJ. This home was the family’s “touch stone” and a favorite spot for extended family to gather and share good food, beauty, love and loss together!\n\nIngrid was forever devoted to her eight grandchildren and two great grandchildren.
