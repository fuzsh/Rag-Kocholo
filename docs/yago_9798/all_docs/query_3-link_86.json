        "text": "Or… Trail Trials and Triumphs\n\nOkay, folks. Buckle up. It’s been several weeks since I’ve had access to a computer to update you on my CDT progress, so this is going to be a longer entry. I’ll try to stick to the highlights!\n\nSince last we met, I have had a few challenges and several exciting milestones along the way. I’ll tell my tales in a chronological order for this one so that you can ride along with the rollercoaster with me.\n\nFinishing the Winds\n\nI’ve loved most of this trail, even the difficult sections. I have to say, the Winds were one of the most challenging, but, oh, they are gorgeous! I took entirely too long to complete this section and included two stops into Pinedale. Pinedale isn’t close to the trail (at least 25 miles away), so I had to get creative and beg rides from fellow hikers. Fortunately, the Winds are an extremely popular hiking destination. Most days, I saw at least 20 other hikers on trail. Some were solo, like me. I also saw several couples, as well as a few larger, organized groups most days.\n\nOne of my favorite, yet really difficult climbs was climbing Hat Pass. This steep pass took me several hours, but mostly because I stopped for breaks at the two lakes on the way up. And I kept turning around to get glimpses of the views behind me. Wow.So.Breathtaking. And then the sense of accomplishment when I reached the top of the final ascent. One of the best feelings on these trails is the huge feelings pride and triumph I get from these daunting feats. My chest could burst and my face split with the grin I can’t get wipe away.\n\nToo hot to handle\n\nI took a day off after the Winds and then got back on trail. The shuttle dropped me off at Brooks Lake and soon I was hiking with an older day hiker. She was very knowledgeable about the local geography and geology. We also talked about local flora as we passed them, and she confirmed my plans to deter confrontations with grizzlies (or respond if I saw any).\n\nThe next day, I climbed over another pass in good time, especially on a warm day. It got into the mid-high 80s that day. On the other side of the pass, I arrived at the start of a five-mile long burn scar. (Read – no shade.) I found a log to sit on for lunch while I contemplated my next miles. As I descended, I encountered blowdowns every 1/4 mile or so. Some were easy to step over. Most were not and involved long detours or acrobatic clambering over top – with my pack. Because of these continual obstacles, I didn’t use my umbrella. Even though I was descending, the going was slow and I lost the trail a few times on the detours.\n\nAbout a mile from the end of the burn scar, I needed a break. I was low on water, but knew I would come to a creek in another 3/4 mile. Still, I don’t like to finish my water until I get to the next source. I sat for 10 minutes or so, and had a Cliff bar and some water. When I got up, I started getting lightheaded and seeing black spots. SCARY! I had to grab onto the top of my pack which was sitting on the ground in front of me so I didn’t keel over. I forced myself not to pass out because I didn’t know how long it would be before another person came along. When I regained enough equilibrium, I put up my umbrella and slowly sipped more water for another 1/2 hour.\n\nAbout 10 minutes after I got up and started hiking again, a few people with pack horses came from the other direction. I briefly talked to them about the lightheadedness I was still feeling, but assured them I would take it easy and rest at the next water. They told me the rest of their group was following and included a medically trained hiker. A large shady area was adjacent to the creek, so I refilled all of my bottles, made some electrolytes, and rested against a green tree while I sipped. The rest of the group came upon me and I talked about the experience with their medic. He suggested some candy in addition to the water and electrolytes, looked me over, and took my pulse. He thought I got a touch of heat exhaustion, but managed it well. Before they left, he confirmed that I would be okay and take it easy for the rest of the day. I assured him I would only go another mile or two before I made camp. The day ended up a good 5 miles short of my goal, but it was too hot and almost passing out terrified me.\n\nThe next day was better. I even saw black bear and wolf tracks!\n\nYellowstone\n\nThe last time I was in Yellowstone was 2001. The geysers haven’t changed much. The development around Old Faithful and the crowds have. Good golly, people were everywhere! I stayed at Grants Village Campground in their hiker/biker site the first night. The West Thumb Geyser Basin was only a few miles away, so I went up the road and meandered around before catching a ranger talk. I also indulged in the all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet. I think I had three plates of food. Thru-hikers can put away some food!\n\nMy next campground was at Upper Firehole backcountry site. I had the place to myself. It was a bit surreal to be alone, surrounded by several hydrothermal features when the geyser basins near the roads were crammed full of visitors. On the trail to the campground, I passed within a few feet of several features, so I was careful to stay on the established path. When I left the congested Old Faithful area the next day, I took my time wandering around Upper Geyser Basin before leaving the park.\n\nWhen in Montana, do what Montanans do!\n\nSince I had recently talked to my daughter about focusing on enjoying my journey instead of worrying about my pace or reaching Canada before October, I am embracing the fun. So, I took another break in West Yellowstone, MT. (See a pattern here about why I take so long to hike?) It was definitely a touristy town, but quaint with its historical buildings. The entrance to Yellowstone National Park was just a block from where I stayed at the historical Madison Hotel. This hotel is one of the sponsors of the local rodeo and had season passes available for guests. They even drove me there and back! I haven’t been to Cowtown Rodeo in New Jersey in probably 10 years, so this was fun!\n\nNew hiking buddy\n\nBefore I started the Winds, I met Jingerpony and Simple. I saw Jingerpony again in Dubois, WY and we had dinner with fellow hiker Wizard. (I originally met Wizard at the start of my hike back in March and ran into him again in the Winds.) When I got my shuttle back to the trail after West Yellowstone, I ran into Jingerpony, again. He had gotten off trail for a few days to let his feet heal from destroyed shoes and then pick up his new shoes which he had shipped.\n\nWe agreed to try to hike together as much as possible through the rest of grizzly country – essentially the rest of the trail. This requires some compromise because he is faster and aims for 20-30 miles per day, while I tend to dawdle and try to hike 15-20. Our first day together, we fell into a good routine. When we weren’t immediately near each other, we met up at breaks and at night. By mid-afternoon that first day, though, we came to a long climb that I wasn’t keen on doing that late in the day. Add into that, a thunderstorm was imminent. Not safe to be on a bald ridge in the middle of a storm.\n\nHe had better resolution on his maps and was able to find us a roadwalk in the valley to bypass the ridge and get us back to the highway in a few days. A few hours later, we looked up to the ridge and saw lightning and rain. (We later learned another hiker was struck by lightning on a ridge about 100 miles north of us from the same storm. Luckily, he survived with no apparent ill-effects.) As we approached the drive to a ranch the rain started hitting us on the gravel road. A couple from that ranch was getting ready to drive in and offered us the warm, dry shop for the night. It had a bathroom including a shower, and a carpeted loft with a sofa, table, and mattress. Sold! While we ate dinner, the storm raged overhead. We visited with them when the storm passed and enjoyed watermelon. What a treat!\n\nBlisters…again!\n\nGetting used to a new pace and distance was not without its hazards. After 20-, 24-, and 21- mile days, I developed blisters from all of the long roadwalks. They were in the same locations as the ones that put me off trail back in New Mexico, but on the other foot. We took a zero when we got to town. I dressed it appropriately, and was able to keep it clean, even on trail. A few slower, shorter days and it healed quickly.\n\nThe best zero days\n\nWe got lucky that first night in town. A large group of SOBOs (southbound thru-hikers) were in town and had made reservations at the local steakhouse. Apparently, this is one of the best steakhouses in Montana and they only prep a limited amount of food each night. Once they are out, they close the kitchen. If you don’t have reservations, you can try your luck sitting at the bar, but you will be served last. Anyway, this group of SOBO had two newly-retired military personnel and they had made extra reservations to accommodate any thru-hikers who happened to be in town that day. We were the only NOBOs, but they quickly absorbed us into their group. So.much.fun! You could tell we were all hikers, though, because amidst all the pitchers of beer, bottles of wine, and shots of whiskey, were at least as many carafes of water that were constantly being refilled.\n\nAfter our zero, we got a shuttle back out to the trail. We told the driver where we wanted to be dropped off, which was about a day’s hike shorter. He knew a lot about the trailheads and offered to show us another spot he thought we’d like, but would take us back to the requested location if we didn’t like the lake. Morrison Lake was an eye-popping oasis at the base of a steep mountain. This picturesque lake had no outlet, but was fed by a few springs. It was full of trout, and the water was so clear. I didn’t realize how far up trail it was at first, but it ended cutting 3/4 of our hike to the next town. Serendipitous. We took another zero at restful lake. While there, we visited with a few families who were enjoying the day.\n\nOne extended family had a few boys who were having loads of fun in the water, splashing, swimming, and kayaking. As they were getting ready to leave, the 9 year old started talking to me and asking so many questions. I loved it! He was really curious about my hike and how I managed life on trail. All sorts of questions, like what I ate, where I slept, how I took care of bathroom needs, bear safety, emergencies. All the questions. I let him pick up my pack and food canister, too. I gave his mom my instagram username so they can follow the rest of my journey. If you’re reading this, HI!!\n\nWildfire worries\n\nAs we straddled the Idaho/Montana border, we were on the actual Continental Divide. Most of the time on the rest of the trail, the trail is a few miles near it and crosses back and forth over it. But for most of this section, we are walking directly on the divide.\n\nI’ve seen and smelled wildfire smoke before, but yesterday the sky quickly changed from a clear day with bright blue skies, to a dull grayish brown. Several ridges we had been able to see clearly were suddenly obscured by the smoke. I was a bit worried. It hadn’t cleared completely by this morning, but the shuttle driver said they often get smoke collecting in the valley from wildfires in Canada and California.\n\nProgress!\n\nI have about 700 miles and 5 care packages left! I think I’m finally feeling like a thru-hiker on this trail. It helps that my new hiking partner and I have come to an understanding about pace. To prevent further injuries, we are going to gradually build miles over the next hundred miles or so until we reach a daily distance that is comfortable and enjoyable for both of us. I still stop for pictures, just not as often, and not dozens of the same flower or butterfly. I think I can actually finish before October. But I don’t want to jinx myself…"
