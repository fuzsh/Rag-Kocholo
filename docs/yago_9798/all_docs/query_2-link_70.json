        "text": "We just heard the heartbreaking news of Paul’s passing. Our hearts go out to you Julie and family as you grieve this devastating loss. I, Marlene started working in the Velvet Glove in November of 1975 the same month Paul started in the Velvet Glove. Gord worked with Paul in banquets and many years beyond that at the Westin/Fairmont. He was a joy to work with. Great sense of humour, wonderful with guests, professional, engaging, and so down to earth. He made an amazing contribution to the hospitality industry in Winnipeg. Our thoughts and prayers are with you all for much comfort in the days to come and in the memories you hold dear. Gord & Marlene McNabb ♥️ - Posted by: Gord & Marlene McNabb (Friends) on: Jan 29, 2023\n\nWe had the pleasure of working with Paul for many years as we held events at the Fort Garry Hotel. Always professional. Always ensured things went as smooth as possible. Friendly and professional. RIP Paul. - Posted by: Vince Stycke (Client) on: Jan 20, 2023\n\nI met Paul in association with Heritage Winnipeg, initially at our events at the Fort Garry Hotel and then as a Board member. He did everything with care and thoughtfulness. My sincere condolences to his family in Winnipeg and in Scotland. - Posted by: Nancy Klos (Heritage colleague) on: Jan 17, 2023\n\nI started working at the Winnipeg Inn in 1979. Throughout all the name changes and the new faces always coming and going, nearly all of my memories of being there have Paul in them. Even at the most stressful of times, being around Paul made it seem a little less like work and a little more like fun with family. He was a great guy and it was my privilege to know him. My most sincere condolences to the family. - Posted by: Trent Roskevich (Another Westin Veteran) on: Jan 16, 2023\n\nPaul was the true professional - I met him in the 80”s at the Westin where we often had dinner and drinks. Such a gentle man. Godspeed Paul Haverstock - Posted by: Jocelyn Greenwood (Acquaintance ) on: Jan 14, 2023\n\nMy sympathies to Julie and family. I met Paul in July of 1978, he hired me as a busboy for the Velvet Glove. That was going to be a start of a great friendship in the Hospitality Industry. Paul was my mentor, he taught me everything I need to know about the service industry, I would not have been successful without his guidance and especially the trust he had in me. Those early years at the Winnipeg Inn will be the most memorable that I still hold close to me and still talk about today. Paul thank you for believing in me, you will be missed. RIP Paul with much Love Henry - Posted by: Henry Traa (Friend coworker ) on: Jan 10, 2023\n\nOn behalf of the Board members of Heritage Winnipeg, we express our extreme condolences to the family on the passing of our dear friend and former Board member. Paul was well respected by all and a joy to have his input and energy with Heritage Winnipeg. His thoughtfulness and friendship is a loss to us all. Our prayers are with the family in this sad time. - Posted by: Greg (Friend President Heritage Winnipeg) on: Jan 03, 2023\n\nI met Paul way back when he was at the Velvet Glove. He oversaw many of our family gatherings, weddings and celebrations. He was full of charm and great stories. His laughter filled a room. To his family I send blessings, as you were blessed to have such a man be part of your lives. In kindness Diane Sidebottom - Posted by: Diane Sidebottom (Friend ) on: Jan 03, 2023\n\nPaul was a dear friend, We became friends with Heritage Winnipeg and shared time at the Millennium Centre, having many great conversations. I will miss our rides when I took him home many times. Such fun and good memories of a true gentleman and friend. My prayers are with the family. - Posted by: Greg (Friend) on: Jan 03, 2023\n\nI was so sorry to hear of Paul’s passing. I had the good fortune of working on Royal visits and various other special events when Paul was at the Westin/Fairmont. He was such a pleasure to deal with, so incredibly efficient and such a gentleman. The last time I saw him was in the Oval Room at the Fort Garry Hotel. He never forgot a face and was always keen on chatting and reminiscing. He was a prince of a man and he will be missed. My sincere sympathies to all his family and loved ones. - Posted by: Suzanne Nolette (Acquaintance ) on: Jan 02, 2023\n\nI wish to offer the family at this time my condolences, There is so much I could say about my older brother Paul, but all I have are my many happy days we had together. Evenings with my family over many years in Carluke and in Winnipeg, Paul and Julie were very good to me at Christmas and we had so many lovey evenings, we all played cards, so thank you. - Posted by: Gerard Larkin Haverstock (Brother) on: Jan 01, 2023\n\nI worked both full and part time with Paul at the Westin Hotel between 1980-87. I had many opportunities to speak with Paul as well as work catering events with him. A fond memory was spending a day with Paul at RBC creating a massive cake for the Kelvin Clippers 75th Anniversary. I have a great photo of us working on that project. Paul was always willing to lend a hand. He was also the one who coordinated my wedding at The Westin in ‘86. I was thankful for Paul’s professionalism, but more importantly his friendship, during my years working with him. My condolences to Paul’s family. - Posted by: John Milani (Co-worker from The Westin ) on: Jan 01, 2023\n\nMy deepest sympathy to Julie and family, may you get through this difficult time, through prayers and the comfort of friends. Paul was a great mentor and friend. I had the privilege to work along side Paul for many years, he touched so many lives through the events he planned. He had a great sense of humour and was very kind. I learned lots from Paul and shared morning bus rides to work with him often. My boys have fond memories of Santa from the kids Xmas parties. He was greatly respected and admired. Paul, Rest In Peace you will be missed. Elfie, Eugene and family - Posted by: Elfie Siemens and family (Friend) on: Jan 01, 2023\n\nMy condolences to all the Haverstock family and friends. I am very saddened to learn of Paul’s passing.

My heart goes out to all of you. - Posted by: Sharon Romanoff (previous co worker) on: Jan 01, 2023\n\nI met Paul when I worked at the Winnipeg Inn and over the years was a fond admirer of his skill in delivering excellent food and beverage services at the many events I attended as a tourism and hospitality industry professional. Paul was always on the move keeping his eye on all of the details and was the consummate professional and an exceptionally talented manager who taught many of us the finer points on how to deliver exceptionally catered events. RIP Paul... - Posted by: Marina James (Work colleague) on: Dec 31, 2022\n\nWe are so very sorry for your loss, Julie, Adam, Lee, Mark and family, our condolences go out to all of you. We were neighbors on Kimberly Avenue and we will always have fond memories of our time together. Eric and Debbie Toews - Posted by: Eric & Debbie Toews (Neighbors) on: Dec 31, 2022\n\nI remember working along side Paul in both Banquets, but as well as during several prominent functions as well as the video shoot for the hotel turning 100. I remember when my father started at the hotel and during the childs christmas parties where he played santa. For many years I thought the \"real\" Santa was actually Scottish. There is now a void that will never be filled - Posted by: William Shaw (friend) on: Dec 31, 2022\n\nPaul Haverstock was a man of many talents, one of them was organizing…without his organizing ability, the Gentlemen‘s Club would be what it is today… Paul was a very interesting person to have a conversation with, he was a sincere and good man… He will be missed by those who the privilege to know him..
