What about their dreams and ambitions? Entertainment choices?\n\nI remember writing my first buyer persona way back when and worrying that I was trying too hard to attract people like me.\n\nWhere was the diversity? Who was I excluding? Am I thinking too small?\n\nTurns out I was only being human because we have a tendency to like and attract people who are similar to us in personality, appearance, values and attitude.\n\nBehavioural psychologists call this a similarity bias and apparently, we are all doing it all the time and have done it since childhood.\n\nBirds of A Feather Flock Together\n\nEver watched kids playing in the school ground? From an early age, they divide themselves into boys and girls. Nobody tells them to do this. Schools no longer have segregated entrances. They just do it. Instinctively."
