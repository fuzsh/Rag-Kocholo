        "text": "Diane Keen shares her journey of adopting a son from Romania shortly after Communism fell in the early 1990s. She takes us into the orphanage where she and her husband first met Haden, through their struggles in understanding what the child had endured, daily life in the Keen household, and the eventual diagnosis of autism for their son. She also shares her research, accomplishments, and plans for creating more supportive employment and affordable housing opportunities for young adults with disabilities. Plus, youâ€™ll find out where to get a cup of Coffee With A Purpose. Enjoy!"
