My father signed and sent the photo to his Brother Barry, on the back there were the following labels:\n\nThe fact that my father choose to include his own height was a hallmark of his dry humor.\n\nThe following blog post is a tribute to my father’s life and the amazing friends that he made. If you are someone that would like to add your story to the ones shared please contact me directly or leave a comment and I will be happy to make the addition.\n\nAnd finally I would like to extend my sincerest thank you to everyone who contributed. I laughed, I cried, and in the end I knew my father better to see him through your eyes. You are all truly the greatest friends a person could ask for.\n\nThere are a lot of stories that have to do with the “University Wall”. Glenn Woodsworth tracked down an amazing video that we have been extended the rights to embed here. It is well worth the 10 min watch and will extend context to all the stories that follow :)\n\nVideo composed by: Ivan T R Hughes\n\nAdditionally there are some audio interviews with Tim Auger by Jim Muir, immediately following the Everest 1982 expedition. These tapes were digitized and access made possible by Abigail Sebaly, archives practicum at the Paul D. Fleck Library and Archives at Banff Centre. It is worth mentioning that Banff Centre has recently processed a collection of photographs, videos, radio transmissions from base camp and field recordings from Nepal from the 1982 Canadian Everest Expedition. You can see the catalogue at:\n\nGrizzly Bear Encounter\n\nThanks to Liana Hwang for submitting this one. Lot’s of details that I did not know until watching the full video :)\n\nMemories\n\nStories have been posted in no particular order.

Temple.\n\nWhenever we arrived on the summit of Yamnuska, the conversation invariably went like this:\n\nTim: “Al?”\n\nMe: “Yeah.”\n\nTim: “Can we go down through the Enchanted Forest?”\n\nMe: “Oh, OK, Tim.”\n\nI know he was just being funny in a gentle, child-like way, but he seemed to especially enjoy those quiet aspen groves on the way back to the car park from the west end of Yam. It always made me smile. It still does.\n\nIf there’s an afterlife, I hope that Tim spends time in his own “Enchanted Forest”.\n\nWith great respect,\n\nAllan Derbyshire\n\nGary Jennings\n\nI was one of his early rescues, but it wasn’t on the heights. I had just shown up at Lake O’Hara to attend High Horizons climbing camp in 1970 at the tender age of 14. Long haired and clueless, I was accosted by three wranglers (there was a horse camp in the vicinity then) who took great offence at my appearance. They decided that they were going to give me a haircut and had me pinned against a tree near the bus drop off. I was getting a little worried about the whole deal when Tim showed up in his seasonal warden get up and said “Hey fellas, what’s going on here?” Thanks Tim, I’ll never forget that.\n\nAnother occasion was when Tim, Don Vockeroth, Lloyd MacKay and Dougal Haston were up on the north face of Mt. Temple making an attempt on the first winter ascent. I was unemployed and heard they were up there so I skied in to see what was going on. On my way in there was a pretty significant avalanche on the face and when I got to the base, they were coming down. We skied out and headed to the tavern at the Cascade Hotel in Banff and I got to spend a great afternoon drinking beer and BSing with four of my climbing hero’s.\n\nIn 2006, my wife Eileen and I were in Madrid, Spain. We’d been out stomping around in the heat all day and retreated back to the hotel to cool off in the A/C for a while before going out for dinner. I flipped on the tv and there was a National Geographic show on in Spanish. The next thing I knew, the was a segment of Tim rescuing some guy from the Bow river near the falls in Banff. It included an interview with Tim and the dubbing had him speaking perfect Spanish! It was so cool that I had to phone him in Canmore and tell him about it. Every time we met after that he would say that we had to get together to talk about Spain, but sadly that never happened.\n\nReg Bunyan\n\nThx everyone for coming and honouring Tim’s memory. As entertaining as they are, I’m not going to rehash the stories of Tim’s nine lives, famous climbs or the details of the many rescues. Some of these were captured in Cory’s blog, PA’s talk and in “Tim’s Song” by The Wardens. Like the rest of this memorial service, I’m going to keep it fairly short, consistent with both Tim’s and Sherry’s wishes for a simple memorial.\n\nWe all knew Tim in many different ways; friend, mentor, neighbour family man, gifted athlete, climber, civil servant, guide, park warden and teacher and or combinations thereof. I’m going to talk a bit about his work legacy, touch on our friendship and the last year of his life.\n\nI’d like to set the scene at the start of Tim’s career. Most of us in this crowd are older. So it doesn’t take much to imagine a time without cell phones, satellite communication or GPS’s. Or to put the era another way, nobody skied on less than a 205 cm ski and you didn’t have to know Italian to order a coffee. Avalanche beacons hardly existed outside the domain of professional ski operations. North American rescue equipment, protocols and standards were in their infancy. Accident communication was challenging and sketchy, usually well after the fact, often second hand or by an exhausted RP. Late reporting usually meant that the victim was either dead or in Tim’s words “The silver lining was that if they were still alive after that length of time, no matter what we did or how we screwed up, the patient would likely live”\n\nThis was the beginning of the professionalism of the Mountain Park Public Safety program, of which Tim was such an important player. Huge internal and external challenges, with no clear roadmap. Given both Warden and Parks Canada culture at the time, any sense of elitism or inconsistency with management objectives, could have easily tanked the program. Banff, as anyone who has worked here knows, is so much more in the public eye. Particularly by the media and therefore by extension, under the scrutiny of HQ in Ottawa. Tim was the perfect person for Banff with his easy going confidence and his big toothy smile, custom made for the camera.\n\nAnd it’s not as if Tim necessarily had easy material to work with. Wardens had\n\njust transitioned from districts and horses, with wildly varying mountaineering skills, aptitudes and interests. But by emphasising that everyone was part of the team including rescue pilots and dispatchers, and training strong 1 st party leaders and Tim built a highly respected rescue program. That same philosophy and leadership was a huge factor in building Warden “esprit de corp”; a trait often both admired and hated by some within Parks Canada. “Esprit de corp” doesn’t magically happen by putting on a uniform or giving someone a title. As a natural leader, Tim knew that it’s built by teamwork, trust, common goals and cemented by the adrenalin and stress of risky work.\n\nThose of us who worked with Tim had absolute trust in his judgement. A short story. One late October, we had an overdue on Mt Fay. When we hadn’t heard anything by lunch time Tim grabbed a heli and the two of us went for a reccy. It was obvious from the tracks to the rap station that our climber had fled the coop. But it was one of those stellar warm late October days and the centre ice bulge on the North face was in perfect shape, screaming to be climbed. Tim impulsively sent the helicopter home and we jumped out with minimal ice climbing gear, no headlamps and no clear idea as to whether we’d get down before dark let alone how we would get back to Banff. We simul climbed up on perfect ice, giggling the whole way up like a couple of school kids because we were stealing a perfect climbing day from the gods. After summiting, we raced down the ridge and started descending the steep snow slopes to the climbers’ right of the north face. After a few steps, it became obvious that we were rapidly running out of daylight. Tim, realizing that more drastic measure were called for turned to me and said to\n\nme “keep your feet and hands up” and then launched himself down the slope on his back. I stood open mouthed as he slid down the slope at Mach 1, flew\n\nairborne over the semi open bergschrund and landed in an explosion of snow.\n\nHe got up, dusted himself off and grinning like Cheshire cat, gave me the thumbs up and waved me down. I remember thinking that I hadn’t seen that technique in the guides manual and I felt utterly intimidated by both the speed of his descent and the bergschrund at the bottom. But Tim always inspired unwavering confidence, so naturally, I jumped too. And that was Tim in a nutshell; spontaneous, so much fun to be with and he inspired absolute trust. I could go on for ages with small snippets of Tim’s work but I’d like I’d like to talk a little bit about the last year of Tim’s life. I still can’t think about my time spent with Tim, without thinking about Sherry. Tim’s eyes would light up whenever Sherry walked into the room. Still the belle of the ball and as his health slowly deteriorated, his touch stone. And such a patient, loving and fierce advocate for Tim. It still leaves me feeling humbled and touched, wondering if I could even give ½ as much in the same circumstances.\n\nTim had a devastating disease and although it was so difficult to see that athletic body and mind melting away, it was always a privilege to spend time with him. Tim taught me so much during my career but like all good mentors, the lessons didn’t end there. Tim taught me about:\n\nCOURAGE. Tim faced his disease the same way as a fabled Auger 5.9. A historical footnote for the non-climbers in the crowd. The climbing scale used to end at 5.9. I think it’s now sitting at 5.15 something. But for years, Tim was convinced that all those extra numbers were about putting fluff on what was actually only a hard 5.9. So when Tim asked you to go climbing and the route was “only 5.9”, you went with your eyes wide open. Hence the famous Auger 5.9’s that had so many of us questioning our climbing ability.\n\nTim had a disease that can so easily rob you of your dignity, creating a condition that would have caused many of us to hide at home and bemoan our fate. Not Tim. Not once did I ever hear him complain, express his frustration or see him attempt to hide his condition. Like an Auger 5.9, Tim faced his future with courage. Always keen to get outside, face the world, greet his neighbours and get one more glimpse of his beloved mountains.\n\nGRACE. After recovering from his back to back climbing accidents, Tim was still keen to get on a summit but having trouble finding climbing partners. We hadn’t been in touch for quite a while and he called to ask if I would go up the standard route on Mt Edith with him. Although fit, his partially amputated fingers and fused ankle were still giving him grief. As we started on the easy scramble section, it became quite clear to me that a combination of cognition, balance and sense of touch problems precluded going any further and I told him that it just wasn’t going to work and we needed to turn around. Tim knew his climbing windows were closing very rapidly and even though he was so very keen to stand on top of a mountain again and get a last eagle eye view of his beloved Mt Louis, he accepted the decision with grace. It was my last trip in the mountains with Tim. I still have fond memories of that day, sitting with him at the base of Mt Louis; a couple of old guys reminiscing about all the routes we climbed together.\n\nCLASS. One day I took Tim out for lunch to give Sherry a bit of a break. By that time, Tim had lost much of his ability to speak and needed help eating. As Sherry said to me when we’re dressing him up to go outside, “it’s obvious that you never had kids because you’re not very good at this sort of thing”. And inevitably, while I was helping him eat, because I’m not being very good at this sort of thing, I spilled food on Tim’s shirt. “Ahh shit Tim, I’m so sorry, my fault”, I said. Even though he hadn’t been able to articulate a damn word for the last hour, he piped up clear as a bell, “no that was my fault”. It was so Tim, always the class act and the perfect response to set you at ease.\n\nIt seems trite but it was one of those simple moments of human connection and so unexpected that we both burst out laughing. Because that’s what friends do; they can laugh over simple meaningless shite in the most difficult of circumstances.\n\nDIGNITY. Somehow, in spite of the ravages to his mind and body, Tim still always managed to radiate dignity and charisma. Thx to Sherry, he was always looking impeccably dressed with sunglasses perched on his head, just so. Donny, Ian and I would take turns wheeling him around town in his wheelchair. I’m still trying to figure out how someone with a condition that was gradually turning him into a human pretzel, could look so much more dapper and composed then the rubes\n\npushing his wheelchair.\n\nGRATITUDE. What could one possibly be grateful for when fate has tossed you such an unwarranted roll of the dice? Tim was so grateful to all of you who spent time with him or greeted him on the streets of Canmore. You could see it in his eyes, how a familiar face and a warm hello brightened him up. Even on days when he couldn’t remember names, he knew the face and always greeted you with a smile or the “Auger Wave”, which was his irreverent way of saying “glad to see you”. On many days he had trouble speaking, but somehow, as I was preparing to leave, he would always find his voice. It was so important for Tim to look you in the eye, shake your hand and say “thank you” at the end of every visit. Tim, even as he was slowly dying, always tried to make you feel special, when really, it should have been the other way around.\n\nI’d like to close with one last thought from Tim that seems appropriate. I had often asked Tim how coped with the tough side of rescue work that no one talks about; the bodies of friends and grieving next of kin. Tim would constantly remind me that there wasn’t anything we could do for the deceased; it was all about focusing on the living and helping those left behind. A positive mantra for all of us to remember. Thank you\n\nDavid Smith\n\nI first met Tim in the fall of 1971, at Lake O’Hara. I had been introduced by Chic Scott, who had also introduced me to Yamnuska the previous day. With ambitions to do an alpine route, we hitchhiked from Yam to the O’Hara parking lot as the weather began to cloud over and met Tim at the warden’s cabin. He was very welcoming, a great smile on his face, confident and at ease, a sunny disposition to offset the rainy weather. We hit it off immediately.\n\nIn the ensuing years, we became good friends, crossing each other’s path many times in the pursuit of our mountain dreams and ambitions. It started with the ACMG training and exam courses, and then went on to climbs, rescue practices with our respective agencies, teaching, guiding and even an excursion into the field of “industrial mountaineering”. In the early years, work was pretty much seasonal, so we became opportunistic and did whatever it took to get a paycheque before things began to gel into a full time career, each on our separate, but related paths.\n\nTim clowning at the top of Grillmair Chimney route, Yamnuska. Early 1980’s\n\nMy story is about a trip to northern British Columbia to do water monitoring and measuring work for industry in the canyons of the Stikine and Iskut Rivers. The job took place in the late winters of 1980 and 1981. I was pleased when Tim agreed to be a member of our four person crew in 1980. He would bring his experience with the airy world of steep rock, his expertise with rope handling and rigging, a keen sense of risk management and a calm and upbeat personality to the job.\n\nIn those days, Highway 37 was a dirt road, rough in places, and in the first year, we used air transport; Grumman Goose, deHavilland Beaver and Bell 206 helicopters. We flew out of Terrace in the Grumman and landed at the dirt airstrip near Dease Lake, a somewhat unintended use for a plane that had built its reputation as an amphibian aircraft. We then used a helicopter to get us to Z Camp near the Stikine, a typical drab remote work camp consisting of Atco trailers. Once we sorted out the logistics of the job, it all became a big adventure, involving a lot of flying and rope work amid awe-inspiring surroundings.\n\nTim (orange helmet) with John Carter in the Stikine Canyon, 1980\n\nAt the end of our ten day stint, with the job successfully completed, we packed things up and flew south from Dease Lake in a vintage Beaver aircraft, mostly following road 37 as the weather began to deteriorate. Our pilot was a gray-haired, calm-voiced person, whose appearance and demeanour inspired confidence, even as the lowering weather forced us to lose elevation and fly closer to road grade over Ningunsaw Pass. Now the Beaver has a fabulous reputation as a bush plane and is one of the first real STOL aircraft, but that is all fluff if the pilot is shaky or inexperienced. The cloud layer had us within a few hundred feet of the deck as we approached the summit of the pass and all the classic stories of small aircraft coming to grief in similar circumstances began to invade our minds. I was next to the pilot and Tim was right behind me. The cockpit was noisy from the drone of the engine, even with the headphones, but not from talking — everyone was deadly quiet as the visibility drove us lower and lower and opportunities for pulling out diminished. The pilot was looking straight ahead and concentrating so I glanced back at Tim and he looked at me with that calm demeanour in the face of rising hazard, concerned, but not too worried. Just as I figured we may have to land on the road and I began to keep an eye out for traffic while hoping for the best, we cleared the summit and the space between cloud and highway increased dramatically. We had the clearance we needed to breathe easier.\n\nI turned to the pilot and said “I’m glad that’s behind us. You seemed fairly relaxed, how long have you been flying?” His reply, heard by all, “just over two years”. “Oh, I said, what did you do before that?” “I was an accountant.” I looked back at the others. Tim was laughing, while John and Tom were still digesting the exchange. So the pilot turned out to be a rookie, but as the visibility continued to improve and the valley widened, it was obvious the worst was over.\n\nWe only needed a quarter of the tarmac at Terrace to land, demonstrating the versatility of the plane. But it was less than reassuring and none of us really knew how close to the line we had been earlier. The proof of how we really felt was in the rousing round of beers we drank that night to celebrate our continued existence.\n\nTim would go on to do many hours of flying, almost entirely in helicopters, in his job as an alpine rescue specialist for Parks Canada. It’s the type of mountain flying that is often in tight, steep terrain, with limited rotor clearance and in all kinds of marginal weather. Dangling on the end of a rescue line under the helicopter, he pulled many injured people out of inhospitable and unforgiving terrain and helped to save many lives. He was part of a team and had a lot of pride in his organization and colleagues. One can rest assured, in their situation there was and is, a high level of understanding and trust between pilot and rescuers and no Ningunsaw surprises.\n\nI’m going to miss you Tim. Thank you not only for the shared adventures and memories, but for your wonderful gift of the gab and cheerful outlook that helped make even the scary moments perversely fun.\n\nDave\n\nBrian Wyvill\n\nI lived in Canmore from 1990 to 2006.\n\nYour dad made it a tradition of climbing Yamnuska every year, and for a few years he would call me up in early Fall and say it was time for his annual outing and would I join in. In fact both my son and daughter came out at different times on the annual ‘climb Yamnuska \\with Tim’ trips. One year, when son Simon was aged about 12, Tim agreed to put him in the middle of the rope. The route was Jimmy and the Cruisers. It turns out there is a bit of a difficult diagonal pitch at 10+ very exposed and ending in a hanging stance. Simon was intimated to say the least and I was feeling very guilty for taking him up there, but Tim, coming up last on the rope, just took it in his stride and gave Simon the encouragement he needed to climb the pitch and the rest of the route. Simon remembers that experienced voice in his head, to this day nearly 20 years later, and with people like your dad around to encourage him, he has become more than just a rock jock. Last year he climbed Lotus Flower Tower with his buddies. So both of us have great memories of climbing with your dad.\n\nLise Gautron\n\nThe Rescue of Ice Climbers Philippe and Bernard\n\nIntegral to the Warden Service is the 24 hr Emergency Dispatch Center which does the emergency call-taking for Banff, Kootenay, Yoho and Waterton National Parks. A team of dispatchers works around the clock taking calls for law enforcement, wildlife conflict, wildland fires, public safety and environmental emergencies.\n\nWhen I started working as a dispatcher at Banff Dispatch in 1989, Tim Auger was the Public Safety manager. The public safety calls ranged from avalanches, climbing accidents, lost hikers to capsized kayakers and stranded scramblers. After collecting the initial information on the incident, the dispatchers would transfer the caller to the Rescue Leader for further questioning.\n\nOn December 19, 1999, at the end of the workday, staff had gathered in the conference room at the Banff Warden Office for the Christmas party. It was a pretty lively bunch with everyone sampling treats and exchanging pleasantries. A Senior VP showed up and bottles of Scotch started making the rounds. Spirits were getting brighter and brighter. At one point, it seemed that Tim had perhaps gotten a little “ahead of the group” in sampling the various festive libations… most uncharacteristic for the often reserved, but well respected rescue leader. Someone hit Bill Hunt up to help stage a bogus rescue call. Bill grabbed a phone from a desk across from Dispatch and hid under the desk. I ran to the conference room asking Tim to come quickly to Dispatch for a rescue on the Cascade Waterfall.\n\nI remember him mumbling, ‘you’ve got to be kidding’.\n\nThe following recording is the phone exchange between Philippe the ice climber (Bill Hunt) and Tim. At one point, Bill forgets that he is Philippe and he switches from a French accent to a Mexican accent. Clearly everyone had had one too many…….\n\nAttached are Tim’s notes…… not sure what happened to his small neat handwriting……\n\nLiana Hwang\n\nMy husband and I feel very lucky to have known your dad. We met him on a ski trip that he was guiding at Campbell Icefields in 2009 with Bernie Schiesser.\n\nHe had many incredible and entertaining stories, but I remember in particular how he told me about a man who had crashed biking and essentially rubbed his ear and the side of his face off on the road. He told me that he thought it was important to reassure the injured person. I can’t remember his exact words, but he said he would always make a point of saying something like “I’m Tim and I’m going to help you. It’s going to be ok”, and how he could see the fear and tension draining out of the person when he said this.\n\nI was just starting my medical career at that time and I tried to bring that empathy and kindness into my practice.\n\nI now work at the Canmore hospital, and was there almost every other day while your dad was admitted this past winter. I would often visit with him if I had some downtime. He didn’t usually remember who I was, but he was still the same kind, quiet, unassuming man with the same dry sense of wit and was still telling wonderful stories.\n\nRichard de Candole\n\nWorked at Banff National Park\n\nTim was the Lake O’Hara park warden when I was the dishwasher at the Lodge during the summer of 1972.\n\nOften when I hear a song from America’s first album America, I’m reminded of the slide show Tim put together one week for the Saturday night show staff used to (and still do) put on. The album served as the soundtrack for a three-day climb of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park Tim and a friend had done the previous winter. Playing the record with his slides was both serendipitous and amazingly coincidental. As the tension, the exertion, the playful moments of the climb unfolded, America’s songs ebbed and flowed, capturing the mood beautifully. I remember two moments in particular. Tim’s oh-so understated description of the ledge that was to be their campsite one night: ”it was about the size of a telephone booth!” And then there was his amazing photo at dawn on the final day as they pulled themselves over the top with the sun edging up on the distant horizon. A few years ago during a phone conversation with Tim I learned that it was no accident he had used the album for the slide show. He had spent several weeks staying in a climber’s hostel at Yosemite and one day he heard the music being played. Because it was new it would be played over and over during his stay and its catchy California vibe and smooth harmonies came to define his climb of El Capitan. That summer he was of course delighted to discover someone on staff had the album for his slide show. It was one of two albums I happened to take to the Lodge. I spent the summer learning several of America’s songs on my guitar. The other album I took was Joni Mitchell’s Blue. Rest in peace, Tim. God bless\n\nMarilyn and Russ Mattson\n\nFriends of Sherry and Tim\n\nRuss and I were definitely on the perimeter of your Mom and Dad’s friendship circle but still have very fond memories.\n\nOne early memory was when you, Brian and Larry had built a zip line from Salzgeber’s deck to one of trees in our yard and you three were having a pretty good time in the build and then sliding down it. We were a little concerned that maybe it wasn’t as safe as it should or could have been, but then Tim came over and gave it his stamp of approval and made us feel a little better because who could give it a better stamp of approval than your Dad?\n\nThe next very clear memory was when Tim took on the challenge of organizing one of the very first Coho summer swim club swim meets. There was not a lot of history in Canmore for a meet but that was not a problem for Tim. He collected all the information he could I guess and then went about organizing one of the very best organized swim meets we had ever been to with just no fuss and no panic just his pencil, pad of paper and quiet instructions. Russ remembers going to the Warden Office to pick up tables and chairs and Tim coming down the stairs, recognizing Russ and helping to load all the tables and chairs into our truck after Russ had been chastised at the front desk for not pronouncing your last name correctly.\n\nThe last few years since we moved to 15th street, we have seen your parents out walking and driving a lot (until this summer) and it warmed my heart just knowing what a challenge the Alzheimer diagnosis brings and seeing how graciously your Mom handled it all and the dignity she gave your Dad right to the end.\n\nIt was wonderful to see you last week Corey. Sorry I did not recognize you immediately but your smile gave you away!!!! J Thank you for calling out to me. Hugs to you and your three children and hope to meet up with Kristin sometime in the near future.\n\nLarry Mattson\n\nFriends of Corey\n\nI was fortunate enough to grow up with Corey, and so there are many good memories of Tim that come to mind. He always had a knack for getting his point across to us using humour and his trademark dry-as-gin delivery.\n\nWhen we were in our late teens we began to enthusiastically explore the avalanche prone out of bounds areas at Lake Louise and Sunshine. Tim knew exactly what was going on, and got us all over at his house one evening to fill us in on the danger that we were putting ourselves in. He referred to the particularly dangerous points on the slope as the “G-spots” just to make sure that it stayed with us. For me, it always has. And it still makes me grin!\n\nTim will be missed, but he had an amazing life. He saved lives, he championed the wild places of western Canada, and he was always someone that I enjoyed running into on the street.\n\nBen Gadd\n\nMy favorite memory of Tim was when I first met him. The year was 1971 or 1972, and the place was Lake O’Hara, where my wife Cia and I were camping in the Alpine Meadows with our two little boys, Willy and Toby.\n\nI needed to find the warden on duty that morning. One of the other campers was a strange fellow who told scary stories about the Mafia being everywhere, including at Lake O’Hara. The previous evening he had said that we all needed to be very careful about who might come walking by our tents at night.\n\nI was a little concerned that it might be this guy. I thought the warden should be informed.\n\nThe person who answered my knock on the door was Tim. I explained the situation.\n\n“Oh, that’s just so-and-so,” he said. “Comes here for a week or so every summer. He’s crazy, but he’s harmless. Not to worry.”\n\nAnd as Tim stood there, asking whether there was anything else he could do for me, I noticed what he was wearing. He had on a pair of jeans, mountaineering boots, his warden-issue shirt, his hat and his badge. And then I saw what was around his neck. It was a string of brightly colored hippie beads.\n\nBarry Auger\n\nBrother\n\nTim was eight years younger than me, quite a gap when you are pre-teen age or high school years. Tim was the little kid that went into my bedroom and played with my toys.\n\nOne year the whole family, all four of us, went on a road trip from Winnipeg through Minnesota,North Dakota, Montana, Idaho and up into Alberta and a brief stay in Banff. Tim would have been about 12. While there mom, dad, Tim and I went to the top of Hot Springs Mountain. The cable car let us all off: Tim walked out onto the viewing platform, took a one second look at the fabulous view and turned to us and said: “Well I’ve seen it: lets go down…” We never let him forget it!\n\nI was off pursuing my career when Tim was finishing high school and off to UBC. When I came back home, first to Winnipeg, then Vancouver I’d catch up with my kid brother. I do remember when Tim finished UBC there wasn’t a building on campus he hadn’t climbed! I thought that was pretty exceptional. I expect UBC had a different word for it. Tim had a wonderful career with Parks Canada as chief of mountain rescue. Imaging having a\n\nhelicopter of your own to play with. And because he was articulate and engaging his name was on the Roldex of every news reporter across Canada. So when there was an “event” meaning somebody had fallen off something they called Tim. And when National Geographic did a TV story on mountain rescue techniques there was Tim hanging off a 150' rope under a helicopter. Tim was indeed bigger than life. It’s quite startling to turn on your tv for the news and there’s your brother looking back at you and telling you about the latest “happening”. That happened to me not once but twice.\n\nTim’s retirement roast fifteen years ago was a fine example of his ability to think on his feet. His friends and colleagues picked through the rich field of Tim’s “accomplishments” meaning things he had fallen off, things that tried to eat him etc etc and told much to the amusement of all present. In response Tim, without notes, answered every one of the gybes presented against him and leaving all of us aching with laughter.\n\nTim left us far too soon. By all rights he should have outlived us all. But in remembering him I will always think of the fun and funny stuff that passed between us and smile.\n\nCorey Auger\n\nSon\n\nMy father was gentle, kind, and non confrontational to a fault. Most of my memories of my father are from when I was little. The truth is that we did not interact that much once I left home for University. I never shared his passion for exposed vertical rock faces, and to be honest , it scared me. There are a number of stories I will share from when I was growing up on 14th Street in Canmore.\n\nWhat I remember of my father, is that he is someone you wanted to be with in an emergency. He never panicked and this gave him a natural lead during a times of crisis. One afternoon when I was very little (maybe 6), Tim took me and John Everts (Keith Evert’s son), walking out on the train tracks. I can’t recall where it was or even why we were there, but we ended up at a bridge. The bridge was built for the train, the same width with no guard rails or anything to walk on other then evenly spaced square logs. Just like the scene from the movie “Stand by me” we were walking the bridge when a train began to cross. I believe my father sad “Oh rats”. Very calmly, he told us to get close to the outside of the bridge and lay down on our backs. From what I remember it was presented as a bit of a game and both John and I were thrilled to participate. The train flew by over our heads for well over a minute with John and myself shrieking with laughter. When it was all over we returned to our car from the walk with John and me talking a million miles a minute. This was the greatest thing ever. I think Tim knew there was no silent way out of this one. Upon returning home he fessed up to both my mother and John’s parents. This was less amusing to my mother then I anticipated.\n\nSkiing with my father was always a blast. Perhaps my favourite thing to do as a kid was to head up to the hills with friends on the weekend (and sometimes schools days). Skiing at sunshine with Tim was full of perks. First thing when you got to the hill he would grab the warden skidoo, and attach a long rope through the back. The rope would get handed to me and the friend I was with on that day. We would place our polls through the loops on either end and hold them as if we were water skiing. From here we would be towed up the entire ski out. We had all the good hits figured out in reverse, launch off rises and landing with the rope snapping you back into tension behind the skidoo. If both kids carved really wide on a turn, I remember that you could actually wash out the back of the skidoo and have it skid a bit. I am sure this was to the envy of every child that looked down at us from the stinky gondola above. Lunch would be at the warden cabin where you could climb the metal rig on the side of the cabin to get on the roof. From here jumping off the roof would put you in snow up to your neck, often requiring that your friend come and dig you out. This would be as close as I got to being buried under snow.\n\nSome Additional footage of Tim that I tracked down on youtube.\n\nBruce Patterson\n\nIt was 40 years ago when I first met Tim.\n\nTim was a key figure in the Banff National Park warden service, developing alpine rescue techniques and working with a team of specialists who helped reduce the risk of avalanche hazards in the Rockies and search for those who were caught in potentially lethal slides.\n\nAs the Banff Bureau reporter for the Calgary Herald, I could see that Tim’s expertise would be invaluable in the stories I wrote. I’m grateful that back in the 1970s there were fewer restrictions on Parks Canada staff talking to the media. It helped that Tim’s father had been a newspaper publisher so Tim appreciated the value of stories that raised awareness about the risks of the mountain environment and the need to take them seriously.\n\nMy wife Joan and I recall that Tim was a great storyteller himself with a great sense of humour and humility. When we talked to him about our dogs, he told us that when he was a young boy he thought the family golden retriever was his brother.\n\nTim and other rescue team members didn’t seem to have much concern about giving me a close look at their work. One day, I was photographing the team as they practised helicopter sling rescue techniques. With skilled pilots such as Jim Davies operating the aircraft, rescue workers would dangle in a harness on a long line beneath the helicopter. The pilot could quickly fly the warden to a mountainside perch where an injured climber or hiker could receive first aid and then be flown out in a stretcher to safe terrain below.\n\nTim didn’t hesitate to suggest that I strap on the harness to get a sense of what the airlift feels like. It was a great joyride over the Banff Springs Golf Course to a ledge on Rundle where wardens kept a steady hand on me until my knees stopped shaking.\n\nThere was another memorable flight with Tim when he called early one morning and suggested I join him for a flight around the perimeter of Sunshine Village to see how the risk of avalanches is controlled with the help of explosives. I knew it would make for a great story and photographs but I was also aware that I wasn’t feeling particularly spry that morning after a late evening in the Canmore Hotel. Tim assured me it wouldn’t be a problem with plenty of airsickness bags on board. Fortunately, I skipped breakfast so I didn’t have a lot to lose. The swooping helicopter wasn’t too much of a concern but the smell of the burning fuse on the explosives almost got to me. I think I was more concerned that Tim kept a solid grip on the brick-sized bomb and had a good sense of timing as he took aim at a cornice and hit the target with confidence.\n\nOccasionally, the reality of mountain hazards struck close to home. Tim had a close call with a grizzly during the tense search to find a bear that had killed a tourist on the edge of the Banff townsite. He also survived a 600 metre fall descending from the summit of Mount Logan. It was Tim who told me that John Lauchlan had died in a solo climbing accident. John had taught me rock climbing and I had got to know him well in the lead-up to the 1982 Everest expedition.\n\nJohn was one of the youngest members of that team. Tim was one of the most experienced climbers on that adventure. Tim’s experience on Pumori gave him strong Himalayan credentials to go along with his many achievements on some of the most challenging routes in Squamish, Yosemite and the Rockies.\n\nTim had some doubts about the ’82 expedition with its large size, big budget and plenty of internal politics. He ended up deciding to go and we ended up being tent-mates at basecamp. Back in the day when newspapers had money to spend on stories, I had the good fortune to accompany the team and send dispatches on progress back to Canada. Tim had a way of putting things in perspective.\n\nAfter a big send-off at the Vancouver airport, he shook his head at the hooplah and said, “It’s not as if we’re going off to cure cancer.”\n\nTim took it upon himself to look out for my safety and give me pep talks about minimizing risks in the Khumbu Icefall. As I look back, I think it was his advice that came to mind when a massive avalanche swept down and buried several members of the Canadian team as well as three Sherpas who tragically died in the accident. I was not far from the path of the main slide and could see a wall of snow approaching me after heard the distinctive crack from far above as the massive slide broke loose. I ducked behind a block of ice and pulled my pack overhead to create an air pocket, some tip I must have written about in the past. Fortunately, I was only coated with a dusting of snow blown up on the edge of the slide.\n\nAt that point, it was clear that the mountain was far too dangerous for a novice like me and it was clear I would cover the rest of the expedition from basecamp. Following the avalanche and the icefall collapse that killed Blair Griffiths, Tim like many other team members decided the expedition was over for them. When Tim was on his way back to Canada he met Joan in Kathmandu and said his love of Sherry and Corey was a driving factor in his decision to leave. He didn’t want to risk not sharing life with them, he told Joan.\n\nBefore Tim and the others left the Khumbu, the entire team gathered on a rocky plateau for Blair’s cremation and a ceremony to bid him farewell.\n\nThere were heartfelt prayers and tributes but Tim had written a short poem that stood out for its eloquence:\n\nThis is the way of all eternity\n\nAs we see him now, so shall we be.\n\nWhen the time comes to follow him\n\nto where the mountain wind blows\n\nGo as he does, with a good heart\n\nDon Vockeroth\n\nI met Tim in Vancouver @ a Gaston Rebuffat fat lecture tour when I was an excited 18 year old who had just completed a route on Squamish Chief. Our paths crossed over the years in climbing ,skiing and a bit of socializing. He was an organiser,passionate articulate in his approach to tasks. Much of our friendship was shaped by what was experienced climbing together. The deep respect, trust and strong bond shared in putting one’s life in a there head & hands could not find a better place than Tim Auger.\n\nIn August 1970 (the 15th 16th 17th) Tim Auger, Don Vockeroth, Lloyd MacKay and Charlie Locke headed up to climb the north face of Mount Goodsir — 6700 feet of climbing. After a bivouac at the one third point of the face in the early am, a vertical black loose section arose. “Don, your lead, you like this stuff.”\n\nTim and l are one rope. Lloyd and Charlie the other. I took the lead set up a belay the sun just hitting the face. Water droplets behind some ice Up comes Tim ties in. I say: “look Tim, the light shining into droplets prisms rainbow flashes into our eyes. His response: “That’s better than acid. Really.” We summited that day. Slept in Zinc creek valley. Great climb and better climbing partners.\n\nTwo years later during the winter of 72, Chic Scott organized a winter attempt on Mount Temple’s north face. His friend Dougal Haskins was over from Europe. The team wanted to attempt the climb. Tim Auger & Don Vockeroth one rope, Dougal and Lloyd the other rope. Midway up is a vertical wall at the top of a feature called the Dolfin a steepish section covered in snow. Dougal leading picks a line up the left wall. A lot of pitons a lot of gear. After two pitches we are out of gear. A night tin ledges a at minus 20. Need more gear, Stash our gear and supplies in cave at base of wall at the top of the Dolfin. Down to the bottom put on skis down to cars into Banff gear up. Snows overnight.\n\nIn the morning, back up the dolfin. New snow and all Tim asks during a rest what are are chances l say 70/30 Tim 70 to make it l say on 30. Lloyd and Dougal ahead of us by about 200 vertical feet. We are near the top of the Dolfin, when a voice in Scotish Brogue hollers “ don’t look now boys” l know what this is and start to run away from the wall to my right. Several fast hugh steps l glance up a massive powder snow avalanche is descending still high above. Powder snow avalanches can travel at speed up to 150 ks. They create a vacuum which runs in front of the mass. Run till you feel the air pressure change expel the air from your lungs dive into the slope bury your head shoulders and pack in the slope cover your mouth don’t suck in spin drift.\n\nlet’s getting dark and darker keep trying to move put your hand up everything’s so quiet. After a minute pushing hard stand up. Tim is five feet away l look at him his eyes are big white with\n\nTony black dots in the middle l say “Are you OK Tim?” He says “Mann that was exciting!”\n\nWe look up on Lloyd or Dougal look down the avalanche is roaring across the valley bottom way below. There gone Lloyd and Dougal. We sit down feeling sick minutes later we hear Lloyd holler, “They’re alive. Then we’re close enough to the cave to make it and jump in. After two snow cleared they looked down but we were still under a layer of their reaction was we were gone they sat in the cave feeling ill. We surveyed our situation the avalanche hit the slope bounced skipped up and over us. The slope to our left was to un off the slope to our right was torn off a band 15 or so feet wide did not get torn off. That is where we ended up only luck for us. That threw us off our attempt after retrieving our gear we retreated. Days later talking with Tim on what went thru his mind in these minutes, his thoughts and actions were the same as mine.\n\nYears later after mt Logan came into the national parks program the wardens rescue personal climbed Logan east ridge. On the descent Tim and his partner Perrin came off and took a long fall.This was in the news so l read some details. Later l got a call from Tim.\n\n“ Hi Don I need to talk with you.”\n\n“ Yes read and heard on the news the accident, I hope everything is going OK for you guys.”\n\n“Don no one will understand but you.” Tim then went on to describe what took place.\n\nOn the east ridge near the top before one gains the upper plateau the party cut step on the lea side below the ridge top. Later after the summit now on the way back.Tim first stepped into the cut steps but the sun had dished them out they were not flat off he came pulling his partner off they were sliding toward a large vertical drop starting a small snow slide he attempted to roll over to try and have the rope snag some rocks this did not work over the first drop landed onto another slope started a bigger snow slide down over another big drop in the middle of the avalanche Tim says l was upside down the sun was shining through the snow crystals l knew l was going to die. I knew what he was seeing at that moment before he said the flashing colors then he got buried and went unconscious. I’m so happy Tim that you made it through, thanks for the call.\n\nJosh Briggs\n\nTim was the first person from the mountains that I had contact with. My mum knew him years ago when they were both at one of the Banff centre programs together. I think they were both teenagers at the time. I was getting into climbing during high school in Ottawa and wanted to move out west when I finished high school. On my mum’s suggestion I sent him a letter (this would have been ~1994, so a real pen and ink letter on paper), asking about climbing and life in the mountains. He wrote back to me and I met him soon after moving to Canmore in 1995. We stayed in loose contact throughout my years there.\n\nThe last day I remember him, was climbing Louis with my wife Laurie. We were on the last pitch up the Perren crack and it was looking ready to thunderstorm. Laurie called up that there was a soloist beneath her with no helmet. I replied something to the effect of that being his problem and to get up here before we got electrocuted. The soloist, who was Tim, caught up shortly after and we had a nice walk out together that afternoon.\n\nRon Perla\n\nThe Warden Service in Banff National Park had responsibility to forecast and control avalanches for the Sunshine road and ski area. Tim was very active in that program, active in every sense, he was even awarded his personal slide path, Auger’s Slide, to honor his short ride in the line of duty, performing avalanche control.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1990, National Hydrology Research Institute (NHRI) operated a snow laboratory at the Sunshine Ski area in cooperation with the wardens. NHRI worked mostly on mountain snow properties related to both hydrology and avalanches. Snow samples were studied in situ and inside a cold-lab. Of all the wardens, Tim showed the most interest peering through high powered microscopes at snow crystals and using other NHRI research tools. NHRI responded to that interest with a small grant to Tim and the 1977 Pumori expedition. The purpose of the grant was to study snow properties at Himalayan elevations. Tim prepared a report to NHRI comparing Himalayan elevation snow pits with pits from the alpine and subalpine. Attached is a photo by Lloyd Gallagher of Tim working in a pit high on Pumori with Everest in the background.\n\nShortly after the Pumori expedition, Andre Roch, Himalayan climber and international avalanche consultant, visited Canmore and Banff National Park. Tim and Andre hit it off famously since they shared, besides dedication to mountaineering and avalanche studies, their third passion for the visual arts. Tim presented Andre with a photo from the Pumori expedition, and later Andre sent Tim a painting based on that photo.\n\nThrough the years, Gretchen and I never tired of Tim and Sherry’s stories about their encounters with heroes of the mountains across western Canada. They arrived in Canmore early enough to know many local legends such as Lawrence Grassi. We were entertained by Tim and Sherry’s first hand accounts of the colorful pioneer climbers who inhabited California and Yosemite, in particular of their close relationship with the prolific climber, author and photographer, Galen Rowell. Tim and Sherry also knew in depth the hero and anti-hero, Warren Harding, who included Tim in his iconoclastic book.\n\nOne of my recollections of Tim, climbing guide par excellence, then in his 60’s, was the day he guided me up and down the intricate Kain route on Mt. Louis. He really wanted me to completely enjoy that long day. When we arrived at the Perrin cracks, he would hear nothing of my request to climb with our pack. He insisted on leading the crux pitch encumbered with the pack to enhance my top-roped, pack-free enjoyment of the pitch.\n\nOn a wide variety of topics, mountaineering or non-mountaineering, Tim could always innovate a novel twist which placed complex issues into perspective. Like most mountaineers, he was of course a philosopher.\n\nJane Moody\n\nMy memories of Tim Auger go back to age five in Winnipeg. We were best buds. Another kindergarten classmate said she remembered his smile and sparkling eyes.\n\nEnough of what he looked like stayed with me so that I recognized the guy bounding down the steps at the BSFA when we were 16/17. “Are you Tim Auger?” I asked, incredulous. From then on we hung out with the same gang. Tim had an older friend who opened our minds to Nietzsche; we drew and painted and felt like the soulful artists I imagined we might become. He was very gifted.\n\nWhen he put me on the train for points east, “Bye, Kindygarten” was the last I heard. An ink drawing of the mountains surprised me that Christmas. Many years later his climbing exploits reached the world beyond the Bow Valley. In Vancouver or Victoria, I’d pass on good wishes through his Dad, whom my father knew. When my son arrived in Canmore determined to learn how to climb, the connection meandered to a third generation.\n\nThis death leaves a different shaped hole for each of us. My heart goes out to Sherry and his son and other family and friends who were close. Maybe what we all share, with Tim too, is the essence of the Bow Valley that grabs hold and never lets go. There’s a spirit in them thar hills…\n\nand you, old friend, add your indelible print within it. Sayonara.\n\nMartin Taylor\n\nAthabasca, Columbia Icefields, August 6th 2010.\n\nI had wanted to climb Athabasca for more than a decade. For one reason or another potential climbing partners became fewer and fewer, either having given up climbing mountains or had already been up this one. This year I wanted to make a big effort, not knowing if I could still climb a `biggy` after three years of abstinence from the high mountains. The only safe option was to hire a guide.\n\nAs I staggered up the final few feet of rock, wet with melting snow, onto the summit ridge of Athabasca, following Tim Auger, Yamnuska guide, eleven (11) hours after our 0315hr start, I had a smile on my face; I had done it though not on one of the most popular routes.\n\nWe had started from the «SnoCat» road up to the Columbia Icefields glacier. We had not eaten nor drunk more than a drop or two of liquid during this marathon ascent. Well I must confess I did manage to take a bite or two from a «Power Bar», which I had surreptitiously stored in my anorak pocket, whilst Tim was tying us into some bomb-proof protection on the climb!\n\nTim had called me at the hotel in Banff a day or two before we set off, to tell me that he wanted to try a route he had not done before. Although he had many times climbed the mountain by various routes. This route was supposed to be interesting as he outlined the route, saying it would be around trip of 12 hrs. Just within the guidelines of an ascent between 9 & 12 hours according to the Yamnuska descriptions. I replied that I had not done much ice climbing in some years. No problem for him! He said it would involve front-pointing but that he would bring along all of the required equipment. I was only armed with an ice axe, some slings, a cam or two and nuts.\n\nWe camped at the Icefields the previous day, not putting on the fly sheet but then it did sling it down with a heavy shower during the evening, when I was obliged to crawl out of the sleeping bag and put it on. We rose at the unearthly hour of 0145 hrs to a starry night, ate some cereal with a cup of tea and off we went.\n\nAt the parking lot, we met another party of climbers, one of whom was a fellow Yamnuska guide, intent on doing the «Silverhorn route». Tim mused that our combined ages were more than triple the combined ages of the three young climbers. Yes, quite.\n\nRose-fingered dawn (Homer!), arrived three (3) hours later after trudging with headlights across the moraines to the glacier and reached the junction for the Silverhorn route and the north face routes. Our superior number of years, supposedly slowing us down, had not slowed us behind the young’uns. We said cheerio and continued beneath the overhanging seracs of the north face and crossed the ice avalanche path as erringly as possible to reach the foot at the lower edge and start of the north ridge. Our route lay on the ice and snow face adjacent thus avoiding the saw- teeth rocks of the ridge. Out came the protection with the loan of a pterodactyl ice-axe for me to accompany my worthy, yet light-weight, ice-axe.\n\nUp climbed Tim front-pointing to lead out on well over a hundred and twenty feet of rope with ice-screws judiciously placed after scraping away several inches of soft snow. It was light enough from a sunny blue sky, yet we were still in the shadow on the west side of the ridge, with the summit above, seemingly close. Dark clouds lay brooding to the north with a haze from forest fires in B.C. obscuring the views; to the south higher billowing clouds were lingering, not quite as threatening. It seemed the gods were with us that day as the summit, always tantalisingly close, remained in the sun throughout our climb. But the dark clouds always threatened on the horizon.\n\nI was quite mesmerised by the silhouettes, of the three (3) climbers who were rapidly approaching the summit in the sunlight a couple of kilometres or so away, on the Silverhorn route. Tim and I were moving slowly but methodically, pitch by pitch, mostly on the face and switching between rocks jutting out from the face. A few pitches later the ice/snow slope led us up to the ridge proper. Now we were able to look over the ridge and to the east, just as to the north and south; clouds and heat haze everywhere. As we edged up, Tim patiently ensuring our safety, I was able to relax at the belay stations, aware of the steep slope below us and watch other parties move up the Silverhorn.\n\nTim said to me once I was safely anchored on belay, that he now needed to seek out a traverse onto the north face. We correctly found the traverse, protected by at least two pins, in-situ, and were able to follow up the so-called <Scottish> couloir for a few dozen feet of+6⁰⁰ ice/snow, to climb back out onto the ridge. As for the couloir, well I have climbed much longer ones on Ben Nevis, Scotland, so I am not convinced that the variant is as useful as some say, to avoid some of the ridge.\n\nAhead lay a steep but stepped wall of rock, running in water from the melting snow of the ridge above. Once on top it was a few minutes of «short roping» and we were on the final snow slope and the corniced summit ridge of Athabasca. Our feet sunk into the soft snow making for slow movement. No rest for the wicked as they say, as we crossed it and down to the notch between the true summit and the Silverhorn summit where we were able to finally rest, eat and drink.\n\nAs we rested, snow flakes fell, and the sun disappeared. But the threat of a shower did not last long, not until we were well on our drive back to Banff.\n\nA half hour later we began a rapid descent lasting just over two hours via the AA col, to arrive at the car completely knackered, a round trip of 14 hours. The muscles of the thighs and legs were quite aching.\n\nI remarked to Tim that I thought that despite our ages we were not such a slow party; he demurred on that one but as I pointed out not many parties would descend that much faster.\n\nFor my part, at nearly 70 years of age I was most satisfied with climbing such a challenging route. And I had made a good choice to climb with Tim Auger. But whether or not I have the stamina or the will to make an elevation gain of 5000ft or more or to climb for more than 12hours at one go, I need to think about it again. I know I can do it but the years take their toll!\n\nI later learned that our climb turned out to be a variant of the north ridge, first climbed in 1898, now rated as 5.5 in S. Dougherty’s guide book, being the first ascent of the mountain.\n\nMartinTaylor\n\nJoseph Brunelle\n\nI was told before the trip that Tim told the best stories. His emotion and detail made you feel like you were a part of the adventure. The night we celebrated his birthday on the ski trip I sat for a couple hours listening to his amazing experiences. One of them was during his time working with Banff park, when he had to deal with the bear problem. This story compelled me to read the book “The Black Grizzly of Whiskey Creek”. His story had a bit more detail about specific events that did not make the book.\n\nIncredible man and Canadian legend.\n\nDarro Stinson\n\nIn 1972 I joined the Warden Service and was posted to Takakkaw Falls. Tim was at Lake O’Hara, we were the new guys on the block and immediately developed a friendship. At that time I had minimal exposure to mountaineering and Tim was always looking for a climbing partner. At some point over a glass of wine while we sat looking at Takakkaw he suggested we should climb the route adjacent to the falls. Of course I said yes and the adventures started from there. It was a short time later he called me about a new route he had been wanting to have a go at on the backside of Mt Victoria (Lake O’Hara side). A few days later off we went. It was a long day and I recall a few moments when I was wondering what I was doing there. Tim was always optimistic and of course we suddenly came over yet another promontory to discover we were on the summit. We met a few people on the way down who wondered where we had come from. Of course, at Tim’s insistence, we stopped to clean up Abbott’s Hut before descending to the Lake O’Hara Warden cabin. I know I have pictures if this first ascent, I will try and find them and forward to you as soon as I can.\n\nMy time with Tim in Yoho set me on a career path in public safety after moving to Jasper. I will always be grateful for the times we spent together in those early years of our careers.\n\nBrian Salzgeber\n\nfriends with Corey\n\nI was fortunate to be born in the same year as Corey, and was lucky to have shared in some great memories, and experiences with Tim. I had always appreciated Tim’s gentle demeanor, and humility.\n\nOne that stands out was when he took Corey and I to Smith Rocks on a climbing trip, our first out of town climbing trip. I think we were 14? The first night I was wondering where we would sleep and we ended up in a random field, so cool! After that we spent a week tenting, cooking and climbing. Tim was very proud of Corey’s climbing talent, and of course right at home in this environment. He would sneak away to tackle multi pitches with new found climbing partners here and there, leaving Corey and I to try bolted routes wherever we wanted, and read lots of comic books :)\n\nThis trip really stands out for me and though I didn’t get head deep into climbing, it truly was the start of many ski bum adventures.\n\nButch Nielsen-Dibben\n\nHello Corey, yes we did attend St. George’s together your dad was one of the academics and I was not.lol this translates to we were never on the same classes. He was in A and I was in B.I was a full time boarder, and he was a day student, meaning we never “hung out together”. Full time boarders we’re allowed to sign Sunday pm until supper.All this is to say I only remember him as a very thoughtful polite and honourable Person.\n\nGlenn Woodsworth\n\nTim Auger is one of the two most talented rock climbers I climbed with. When he was about 15 years old, Jim Baldwin and Ed Cooper were making the first ascent of the Grand Wall at Squamish. Tim’s bedroom was plastered with newspaper clippings and photos of the climb, Tim’s father was publisher of the Vancouver Province, at that time an ok newspaper, and many good prints of unpublished photos graced Tim’s walls.\n\nTim went on some trips with the BCMC, including the infamous first ascent of the east peak of Edge in the Golden Ears area with Dick Culbert and Peter Thompson. But his real love was rock climbing. From about 1964 to 1972 he was very active at Squamish, racking up a dozen or so first ascents and climbing with many people, including me but mainly with Mike Wisnicki, Dan Tate, and Hamish Mutch in his earlier years and with Gordon Smaill, Neil Bennett, and one memorable climb with Dick Culbert in the 1970s. Of his earlier climbs, he was proudest of the second ascent of the Grand Wall (to the Dance Platform) with Dan Tate in 1965. His best Squamish climb was no doubt the first ascent of University Wall (with me, Hamish and Dan Tate) in 1966. And later that year he was in the wedding party when Joy and I got married.\n\nMy last rock climb with Tim was the first free ascent of Papoose One in 1967. I remember a gloriously warm fall day and a very pleasant (if difficult, for me) climb, and I think we both knew that it was probably our last day together on the cliffs.\n\nTogether with Dick Culbert, Tony-Judy Ellis (the Tony part, anyways), and me, Tim was one of the most active of the buildering community that haunted the UBC campus (mostly after dark) in the 1960s. He was always up for a good adventure, whether it be buildering or floating down Hell’s Gate on the Fraser River in an inner tube.. One time he crossed the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco on the girders and I-beams under the bridge. At the south end, they rappelled off the bridge into what was then a military base (the Presidio) and had to make an “interesting” escape.\n\nHe climbed in Yosemite, doing a few new routes, and was featured as the “token Canadian” in Warren Harding’s book Downward Bound. Of two trips to the Himalayas, the Everest one didn’t work out too well, but he loved the successful Pumori expedition.\n\nTim spent his working life with Parks Canada, working on trail crews to begin with, but soon moved to Canmore, joining the newly formed Mountain Rescue Group as a warden in Banff. By the time he retired, he was recognized as one of the foremost mountain rescue experts in North America. He continued to climb, too: fine new routes on Mt Louis and South Goodsir, an ascent of the north face of Mt Alberta, the north face of Mt Temple, and many others. He continued to climb at a high standard well into his sixties. Honours came his way, but he remained fun-loving, humorous, quirky and self-effacing as he always was.\n\nWe never lost touch with one another. Tim and his wife, Sherry, would often stay with us on their infrequent visits to Vancouver, and dinner with them and friends was a highlight for all of us. My last hike with him was in the Kananaskis area near his home. I think it was actually the first time I had been in the mountains (not crags) with him; various big plans over the years had never materialized. But this trip was hard to beat: it was one of those beautiful late summer days when the bugs were finished and it was not too hot and not too cold. Tim pointed out the names of all the peaks we could see, and we had a relaxing day, just smiling at one another, enjoying in each other’s company in the mountains that we both love so much.\n\nCrispin Elsted\n\nMy name is Crispin Elsted, and I attended St George’s School with your father in the early 1960s, although I doubt that Tim ever had occasion to speak of me. I’m truly sorry to say that I never saw him again after we all graduated and scattered hither and yon to all sorts of different lives, although I often thought of him over the years and wondered what he had made of himself. I’m not surprised that his life was a rich, fulfilled, and generous one.\n\nTim was someone I deeply admired and was very fond of, although we were never close. I was something of an outsider in our class — uninterested in sports, not much of a social type, and with my nose usually in a book. Tim and I chatted occasionally, sometimes about books, but most often our meetings centred on his extraordinary drawing ability. He would throw off detailed drawings of all sorts of things, usually on pieces of lined loose leaf paper in ballpoint pen. Many of them were extremely funny cartoons, often caricaturing teachers, with witty captions.\n\nI recall one day when, during lunch hour, Tim created an elaborate dungeon scene on the blackboard at the front of the room. The central figure in the drawing was a masked executioner raising his axe, which was positioned to come down on the head of whatever teacher was sitting at the desk in front of the board. On this particular day the teacher in question was our French teacher, Mr Gregory Thomas, himself the possessor of a notoriously dry and delicious sense of humour. When Mr Thomas came into the classroom he stopped, looked at the picture, and without any expression on his face at all, moved his chair about two feet to the side so that the axe would miss him, sat down, and started the lesson. It was a tribute to Tim’s work.\n\nI remember something else about Tim, something more difficult to articulate. It was a certain stillness at his centre, an imperturbable quality which I can only characterise as balance. It seemed to me that he knew much more about who he was and what he might do than most of the rest of us at that age, and I admired him very much for that. He was also very kind. In a boy’s school there is a good deal of tomfoolery and jeering at those who are out of the loop, but I never saw Tim join in any of that. I was not surprised to discover that he had become a noted mountaineer and an expert at rescue. Something of that calm and kindness, that balance, was in his character even when he was still a boy, when I knew him. Now, in my seventies, I have long ago learned that the child is often father of the man. I wish I had had the chance to come to know him later in life.\n\nMichael Mortimer\n\nThe Unforgettable Tim Auger\n\nI’ll never forget the first time that l met Tim. It was in the summer of 1980 and my climbing partner had broken his leg on Mt Louis. After a cold bivouac on the mountain a helicopter showed up with Tim slung underneath. It was an inauspicious introduction!\n\nIn my various volunteer roles with the Alpine Club of Canada, I worked with Tim extensively. During the 80’s we ran a series of mountain safety workshops and Tim was always there to give a hand. His talks on Emergency Management were extremely well attended and sometimes dramatic. One time he was dropped off in a helicopter-having just come from a service call- everyone was very impressed! Later he would also help with the workshops we ran for the Avalanche Association in Calgary.\n\nIt was during my time as Hut’s chairman that we had our greatest interaction. The two particular issues were the sites of the Freshfields hut and the new Bow hut.\n\nThe argument ranged far and wide and to whether the Lloyd MacKay hut on the Freshfield glacier was a good thing. Although it allowed for remote adventure, there was considerable debate regarding its location and difficult access. The Parks wanted it removed! It was Tim who argued successfully that the Freshfields were one of the last pristine areas of Banff National Park. He convinced me about the huts removal and l convinced the ACC .\n\nThe Bow project was also controversial in the hut’s location. I had agreed with Tim to do a site inspection. He called me to say that the flight had been cancelled due to the weather. This was during the Calgary Olympics so that night l went to an extremely late party at the Finnish House- it involved large amounts of extremely smooth blueberry vodka. I got home about 3:00 am to see that Tim had left a message- we fly at 7:00 am.\n\nOf course, Tim wanted to do a close flyby of Castle Mountain. It was extremely choppy- I felt ghastly. I remember Tim asking if l was alright- I looked quite pale (with the pilot Jim Davies giving me a disapproving look) but I thought of the Club. I muttered that l was OK and my honour was saved-just. No paper bag was needed!\n\nWe climbed Athabasca for its centennial ascent. I was with Tim and Gabby Fortin. It was a great day. Often we’d bump into each other at CMC meets and BBQ’s and l always enjoyed our chats.\n\nThe last time l saw him was at the Banff Film Festival. He remembered me.\n\nI’ll never forget him.\n\nMike Mortimer\n\nPast President\n\nAlpine Club of Canada and the UIAA\n\nPerry Jacobson\n\nThere are so many great stories and accomplishments I could say about your Dad but one sticks out in my mind that show how astute Tim could be.\n\nJust before I retired as Chief Warden in Banff we were involved in a major search for a climber on the south face of Cascade Mountain. I was difficult because we had no information on the person but did find some climbing equipment below the summit. About a week of searching a couple of guys from Calgary search and rescue came in the office to “help” us solve the mystery. They were quite arrogant and appeared to think we were incompetent considering the time we had spent searching with no results.\n\nI remember they had the fluorescence orange jumpsuits with SEARCH AND RESCUE across their backs. We didn’t know who they were or their expertise and because of their attitude I told Tim to kick their ass out of the office. Tim pondered my request then said “Perry, let me handle these guys.’So Tim selected one of guys and had Diane Volkers sling him up on the mountain ( helicopter sling) so he could see for himself what was happening. So up they went to a pretty safe spot on Cascade. Diane said later that the guy was so terrified he didn’t want to join the search but just get the hell back down.\n\nAs soon as he was back down, he and his partner departed in a hurry. It was then that I caught on what Tim had planned. Instead up kicking them out of the office (which I wanted to do) your Dad gave them a taste of Mountain rescue knowing they wouldn’t be back. They left with a lot of respect for the Wardens, if I had kicked them out then they would have left with a negative impression of us.\n\nI remember saying to Tim that after nearly thirty years I was still learning. He had just applied a masterful approach to dealing with those two guys. Tim was a remarkable man in so many ways, I feel so privileged to have known and worked with him.\n\nGrant Statham\n\nHitting the Deck on Bourgeau-Right Hand with Tim\n\nBy Grant Statham\n\nIt was early; early season in the early 90’s and it would be an early winter ascent of the classic waterfall Bourgeau Right-hand. Tim had done the first ascent in February 1973 with Brian Greenwood, George Homer and Rob Wood, so I was in esteemed company.\n\nWhen we got to the base, the first pillar was broken off and didn’t touch the ground. We could just reach it with our ice tools above our heads, but it poured over a roof and so the only thing our feet could do was swing about in the air. Tim said he’d give it shot. He twisted his hands three time around into the wrist loops of his ice axes, then started up. At first he just hung there outstretched and swinging in the wind, feet about 10 cm above the ground. He pulled up and down a few times and then asked me for boost. I cupped my hands and he carefully stepped his crampons in. This got him up until his feet were level with my head. Then he got pumped, said he couldn’t go on and could I please hold his feet and lower him to the ground. I hugged his knees while he slipped his bare hands out from his gloves and toppled off the ice and onto me.\n\nNow we both stood at the bottom again, perplexed. Both his ice axes were unreachable, firmly stuck in the ice 3 meters above us with his gloves still wrapped in the wrist loops. Now what? I figured I could at least get his ice tools back.\n\nSo I built myself a ladder out of rope, then chipped a hole through the ice and tied it through. Now I could stand up in something and soon I was up at Tim’s ice tools. I tossed them both back to the ground and continued up another body length. But now I was pumped and needed to rest in order to place some protection. So I placed my third-tool in the ice, clipped it with a sling to my harness and gently sat back while it took my weight. Phew! Ok this was gonna work. I leaned to my right slightly to grab an ice screw off my harness and shifted my weight ever so slightly. BANG! I was on the ground, on my back, my face was numb and there was blood everywhere. My hammer had come out and smoked me in the chin, then I hit the deck.\n\nBut I was ok, other than a bloody mess. Neither of us had a first aid kit, but because Tim was the rescue guy he wrapped my face in duct tape until I looked like the Tin Man. This stemmed the bleeding while we walked down and made our way to the Banff hospital looking like a couple of real pros. Tim knew everyone at the hospital, so he chatted up the doctors and nurses while I lay there and got a dozen stitches. By noon we were back in the warden truck in the hospital parking lot.\n\n“It’s still early enough to climb Cascade” he said. And we did.\n\nStefan Kuhn\n\nThere is one day that really stands out to me and for me it’s really no surprise as to why, due to my huge excitement for sport and for challenges in any sort of physical situation. A quick note, what your dad did as a climber/human/rescue was nothing short of amazing. One of my fondest memories is during our teenage years in front of your house as a kid, and there was this chin up bar that was between two trees I believe. As kids we use to goof around on it. Right in front of me I got to see why Corey has these amazing genes for body awareness and fitness, because of your dad. Anyways we were just goofing around as teenagers as per usual and somehow your dad was caught or challenged but he ended up blowing my mind by doing these one finger chin ups and to me as a young little athlete I was so impressed at the effort, so none nonchalantly he made it look. I was in awe.\n\nJudy Otton\n\nWhen I worked as the Park Planner at Banff in the 1990s, my office was adjacent to the Parks Canada training room in the Administration Building. Every once in a while, Tim would show up for some training session, mostly first aid re-certifications. Often, he had been up late the night before on a rescue and would be too tired to endure a full day in a training room. I would come back from lunch to find Tim curled up sound asleep under my desk. He would wake up all groggy for a second, shake his head and then launch into a hilarious story about some epic he had shared with people we both knew from the Calgary climbing community. I have to say I was honoured that Tim felt my office floor was a safe and comfortable place to have a midday nap!\n\nI’d also like to share a short series of articles Tim wrote for the 2012 Lake O’Hara Trails Club Newsletter, entitled “Three En-Lightning Experiences at Lake O’Hara”. At this point, Tim was having some trouble with fine motor skills and could not type on the computer. He really wanted to contribute these stories and wrote them out, somewhat shakily, by hand for me to type in. I wonder if these might be some of the last stories Tim was able to put on paper. They are on page 2 of the attached newsletter:\n\nhttp://www.lotc.ca/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2012.pdf\n\nTim was also interviewed for the newsletter in 2010 and you can read his reminiscences here:\n\nhttp://www.lotc.ca/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2010.pdf\n\nThere are a few more words about Tim’s role as O’Hara’s area warden and trail builder in this 1989 newsletter:\n\nhttp://lotc.ca/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1989.pdf\n\nYour Dad’s legacy will be always be looked upon with great admiration and fondness\n\nScott Flavelle\n\nMy name is Scott Flavelle, I have always lived on the Coast except for a few seasons in 1979–1982 whilst doing guiding exams and ice climbing.\n\nI was at least two climber generations behind Tim as a Squamish climber, (13 years younger), and didn’t meet him until I was 19 years old during several of my ACMG Guide Exams. He knew who I was through climber news, and was always genuinely interested in what climbing I was doing and was very encouraging to speak about it.\n\nMy first recreational climb with Tim was voluntarily guiding wardens up the Gmoser route on Mt Louis, together, one each. We had bumped into each other in Banff right after I passed my final guides exam. He was looking at my feet in flip flops, and I remember him saying. “Tanned feet — decadent.” And then we made plans for the very next day.\n\nWhile climbing on Mt Louis,we weren’t going very fast. It was social, and Tim was joking around a lot. I deferred to his sense of time as he had done the route before, or had been on the mountain many times. Somewhere in the upper third he looked at his watch, did a double take, and said we have to hurry up as he was supposed to go to the symphony with his wife. When we were all on the tiny summit, he told us he really didn’t want to let Cherie down, and had an idea. “How about a helicopter sling rescue practise?”. When the helicopter came, the two wardens went off in the traditional rescue harnesses, and flew down to a meadow below. I was pretty scared and said I was going to clip my climbing harness into the big steel ring as well as the mandatory rescue harness. He gave me a wink and said he always did too. Then he said, “ as soon as the helicopter lifts us up, swing your legs up over your head, and we can leave the summit upside down for full effect.” I couldn’t believe what I was hearing from the senior rescue specialist — turned big kid when no authority was around. So off we went into the 1000 metres of instant exposure. He was right, I will never forget that day.\n\nWe were lucky if we did one climb per year together for awhile. We did a new unpublished route on the north face of Stone Rabbit Peak in the Chehalis Range, and bivouacked on the face. I must have asked him about his early Grand Wall climb, and learned of his bivy on the top of the Split Pillar. I don’t think they went to the very top but traversed off on Bellygood Ledge. As Squamish climbers we had always assumed it was called Bellygood ledge because you could crawl across it on your belly if you were really scared. Tim told me, “no, that’s not why, it is because we were using Chinese accents while climbing and we thought it was a “velly (very) good ledge”. History changed due to a spelling mistake.\n\nA couple of slide scans, on the summit and climbing on Mt Stone Rabbit N face 1989\n\nScott\n\nKelley Auger\n\nSuch a wonderful guy , your Dad! My uncle… I did not get to see him much in my 25 years in California!! But I do have some great memories!!!\n\nGrandma Auger made the best bread pudding. I remember enjoying my desert and then when everyone was done he would go in the kitchen and finish the rest of it right out of the bowl , and there was usually quite a bit left over.\n\nI also remember him hanging off our balcony in our living room , probably because it was there to climb, ( why else.)\n\nAnother great story was a long time ago my mom had a horse named Manatu . And he really wanted to ride a horse. So my mom let him ride him , but Tim had a cast on the bottom of his leg….(not sure that this was a good idea)\n\nAnyhow he rode bareback, and his cast was banging on the side of Manatu’s side, which made him go faster . Well the horse ran away with him !!! The only way Tim was able to stop was to run him down someone’s driveway, in Southlands and run him into a bush to get the horse to stop.\n\nI just remember hearing him tell this story and I thought it was great. He was so brave !!\n\nKristin Auger\n\nI met Tim Auger for the first time in 2009 when he came for a visit to Vancouver. I had fallen hard for his son and it was becoming quickly evident to me that I wanted to become an Auger myself.\n\nI asked Corey all the requisite things: who do you look like? What are you parents like? Where do you get your tenacity from, your sense of humour?\n\nHe answered quietly, and kind of vaguely, but the minute I met Tim I saw a quiet, deep kindness in his eyes and the familiar penetrating gaze of his son: the hallmark of a rare human being who really listens to you when you talk.\n\nTim could contribute to any conversation: the glacial fjord my Father loved so much, restaurants in Vancouver, research and music. He was always amiable and it was near impossible to imagine Tim angry: in the decade I knew him, I never heard him come close to raising his voice. In fact, often times you had to lean in close to listen to him tell his little anecdotes and puns, which were consistently hilarious to him as well.\n\nWhen I close my eyes and think about my father in law, two seemingly banal moments stand out. The first is from 2011, when Corey and I were very much into Paleo eating and I’d made a turkey thai shepherds pie that was likely pretty weird to the vast majority of the “normal” population. Tim gulped his first portion down with apparent relish, and then went up to the stove to help himself to two more helpings. I marveled that someone so lithe could eat so much!\n\nThe second moment that stands out is Tim’s countenance during a visit with his granddaughter Summer several weeks after she was born. He sat by our fireplace with his hands in his lap, and I asked him if he wanted to hold her.\n\n“Sure I do,” he said and kind of put his arms flat. It was apparent that he hadn’t had a ton of experience holding tiny mewling newborns, but I watched his eyes and they were moist with emotion.\n\n“Oh, wow, she sure is something else,”he said, and I remember thinking again that I could see the kindness in his eyes: tangibly see his love for her.\n\nOne thing that has stunned me about Tim’s passing is that I have learned after his death about his climbing prowess and veritable fame in that community and among wardens across Canada. I had no idea, because he was not one to talk uninvited about his own exploits and talents — he listened quietly and thoughtfully to what mattered to those around him at any given time.\n\nTim will be greatly missed but he passed on a legacy of quiet power and humble tenacity straight to his son, to the benefit of me and my whole family.\n\nScott Ward\n\nI worked with Tim for 30 years and he was my direct supervisor for 17 of those years in the public safety section of the Banff Warden Service. We had many daily adventures together doing such tasks as helicopter bombing of avalanches, working together to do ski area avalanche control, major searches, mountain rescues, climbing various routes around Banff and on Yamnuska and attending climbing schools that Tim instructed. Tim was a great supervisor and I don’t think we had a single argument in all those years. He was very understanding and compassionate-the kind of guy you just wanted to work hard for, a natural leader. When next of kin had to be dealt with after a fatality it was always Tim that took on that task in a very professional but compassionate way. His photographic memory of all the routes in the Rockies was astounding and when we got a report of a mountain accident Tim would interview the reporting person and then fly directly to the spot. If Tim wasn’t around the rest of us spent considerably more time scouring up and down the mountain in the helicopter looking for the scene. When we had a major search operation Tim would gather a core of veteran wardens around him and democratically brainstorm on the best ways to proceed with the search. This was in contrast to many rescue leaders that used a more autocratic approach. Tim was highly respected by his fellow wardens for all his mountaineering accomplishments and modesty. Tim was like a twelve year old kid when he was dancing around on the sheer exposed face of a mountain. I know it was hard on him these last years to not be up there. He had a strong pull to hang out in exposed places. I remember one time we spent a day-just he and I and the rescue dog, searching the face on Cascade Mtn looking for the body of an ice climber on Urses Hole that was swept off by an avalanche. The snow had set up like concrete and it was a deep burial so we had no success that day. On the way to work the next morning we looked up and the whole face had released in a massive avalanche where we had been searching all day. The warden Gods must have been watching out for us. Another time. just he and I and the dog spent all night searching for four victims of a major avalanche on Healy Creek. We eventually found them some days later but that night sticks in my mind as it was very spooky searching there in the dark not knowing how much hazard still hung above us. There has been too many cases to remember them all-they all seem to blend into each other over the years. I loved the guy and miss him. You can be proud Cory to have had such an amazing man as your father.\n\nDori Buckingham\n\n1. The famous horseback ride on Manitou in Southlands when he had a broken foot in a cast. He was insistent about being able to ride with a cast on his foot. Against my better judgement I saddled up Manitou and gave him precautionary warnings about ONLY WALKING. Of course,Tim, daredevil that he was tried first trotting then cantering and when Manitou took off in a gallop from the cast banging against his side, Tim somehow managed to stay on with only one stirrup and headed him up the driveway of a stable and into a large manure pile to stop.\n\n2. At our wedding, Tim as an usher, was introduced to my tiny roommate Janet. He was so delighted to find someone shorter than he was (at 12 I believe) that he grabbed Janet and skipped down the sidewalk in front of the church.\n\n3. Barry and I went out to meet his parents and Tim at a fishing camp. When we got there we inquired where Tim was. He had free climbed to the top of a church steeple!\n\n4. He and his climbing buddies used to practice free climbing on a huge rock in Stanley Park. But to make it more challenging, they did it in skis!\n\n5. And of course, he nearly got expelled from college from climbing the buildings at UBC.\n\nI’ll try to dig up more memories of Tim. He was such a special person, so happy, so content with his chosen profession, so memorable to anyone who met him. I always liked Sherry, but I really never got to know her well and when Tim moved to be near the mountains, it was years between visits. I don’t remember even meeting Corry until the party before Kelley & Blake’s wedding.\n\nGrant Statham\n\nI first met Tim in December of 1986 when I was 17 years old and had just moved to Sunshine Village after high school. I was obsessed with learning to climb so had moved to Banff and got a job at the ski hill. One day a guy in an orange jacket skied past me in front of my staff accommodation. I stopped him and asked what he did, and to my surprise he talked my ear off and told me all about climbing, avalanches and rescue. I thought this was the coolest job I had ever heard of.\n\nThe following year I started on the ski patrol and began to figure out who Tim Auger was –mostly because I was so into climbing and was encountering his name everywhere. In 1989 I got hired by SSV to be their first avalanche forecaster, and to work with Parks Canada for two years during an avalanche control transition period. This was perhaps the luckiest career break of my life. Tim (always so thorough) designed a 2-year training plan for me and Rowan Harper that would see the Wardens train us every day in preparation for running the place ourselves. So for the next two years I worked with Tim very closely. Here is where I met Marc Ledwidge, one my close friends today. I spent another year doing the same thing at Norquay, also under Tim’s direction. He trained me as an avalanche forecaster.\n\nAnyway I have many stories from those days of climbing and working with Tim. I will share one or two of these funny tales with you for your website. In hindsight these were my most formative years, and the fact that I was starting to climb with Tim Auger (same age as my mother and a climbing legend) was pretty cool. He showed me so many things, but these lessons were never “lessons”, they just kind of happened as we climbed together.\n\nOne day, when we hiked out to climb Professors Waterfall and Under the Volcano, he told me all about Canmore real estate and what was happening. Of course this was all news to me — at 19 I was not into this kind of thing — but he said “do whatever it takes, borrow from your parents if you need to, but buy something in Canmore because it’s going to go way up”. Well I took his advice and cobbled together enough for a condo in 1992. Today I have a nice home in South Canmore and I can thank Tim for getting me going early enough to be stable in expensive Canmore now.\n\nI think he was always kind of looking out for me and supporting me from behind the scenes. We were friends and climbing partners and I was a young mountain guide getting going. He sent me job opportunities at Parks Canada when they arose, and I used to call him with questions about stuff. He really helped me. But I didn’t really think of it that way at the time.\n\nOf course we all loved the guy for his famous sandbagging of climbing grades, and the grade AUGER 5.9 is feared throughout the valley to this day. One time during a late night party we revealed to him about a first ascent we were planning of a huge waterfall way out in the backcountry behind Sunshine. He looked taken aback, I think because he knew about this waterfall and wanted to climb it himself. Anyway he proceeded to tell us that he’d seen it from the helicopter and it looked low angled and boring, “don’t bother”. Well we were a bit confused because the thing looked very hard, but we went anyways and of course it turned out to be 200 meters high and very hard indeed. This is route is now a classic backcountry grade 6, called “The Auger Sanction”.\n\nI got hired by Parks Canada in 2003 and got to work with Tim for about 6-weeks before he retired. I was there when he put on his muskrat hat and walked out the door for the last time. It seemed so strange to watch a career just end by walking out the door. It’s now been 15 years and when I think back, I know that Tim helped me get my job here. He was my first reference, and although I never asked him, he must have helped get me in the door.\n\nLast summer a few of us took Tim out on his last flight into the mountains. It was an emotional experience for me but I will share it with you. We met at your parent’s place and all drove over to the helipad. Brian Webster and I lifted Tim into the front seat, and I adjusted the headset and his sunglasses to make sure he was ready. Lloyd Gallagher was with us. We lifted from Canmore and went right up to the top of Ha-Ling. We flew along the ridge of Rundle, pointing out things and telling stories. We flew past the new Norquay via-ferrata and then arrived at Mt. Louis. We did three circuits around the mountain and talked all about the routes and made some jokes with Tim about how much he had climbed the thing. Then we went back to Banff where we met Pierre Lemire. Tim whispered in my ear that he had tears in his eyes up there. Maybe we all did, I don’t know. Then we went back to your parents house where Sherry had coffee ready and the old guys told stories for another hour.\n\nWhen I left, Tim came with me to the door. I said goodbye and he stared at me so deeply it was like he was looking right through me. His gaze was intense. I walked to my truck and kept looking back, he kept that stare going the whole time even as I drove away. I know that he was trying to tell me that he could see me, and I am convinced this was his way of communicating with me. I have seen him a few times since then, but that was my last real experience with Tim.\n\nWhen I read the announcement of his passing by the ACMG, they described many of his climbs including some of the hard ones he did in his late 40s and at 50. I remember when he did these, and I also remember clearly thinking at the time “holy shit, he’s almost 50. I hope I can do that when I’m almost 50!” Well, now I am 49 and can still manage to get up some hard ones. So even after he passed, Tim has made me feel good about myself by reminding me of how in awe I was of what he was doing at the same age.\n\nAs I look back at 30 years of knowing Tim, and now really reflecting on what he meant to me, what strikes me the most is how much he helped me and how much I learned from him — but none of it was really planned or intentional — it just kind of happened. It think it was true mentorship in the rawest form. He was really just my friend, and probably the first friend I ever had that was the same age as my parents.\n\nTim was a cornerstone of our community. I am relieved for him that he has been released from the terrible illness that took him away in his final years. I will always remember Tim and be grateful for the many stories I have in my head and heart over the years.\n\nThanks Cory and good wishes to you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGrant Statham\n\nCanmore\n\nDon Mickle\n\nHere are some photos that use to hang in the Warden Office coffee room.\n\nThey have been digitized and are in the Archives at the Warden Office."
