Peterson ’80, P’11\n\nEntrepreneur Talks Business\n\nStudents Advocating Gender Equity (SAGE) welcomed Unique Hodge ’18, who recently co-founded Oak Systems while working on her undergraduate degree at Harvard. Oak Systems uses an algorithm to offer personalized hair product recommendations to Black Unique Hodge ’18 women based on their responses to an online assessment, and also incorporates an add-on that searches for products offered by Black-owned businesses.\n\nUnique says it was a business club that led her to the Harvard Innovation Labs Venture Program, and eventually, to Oak Systems. Her advice to students inquiring about starting a business: be creative and be authentic if you want people to believe in you, and trust that you can do it. “You’re in the same boat as everyone else. It’s important to remember that. No one really knows what they’re doing! Just jump in, and learn along the way.” She also credits Winsor for planting the seeds for her success. “Winsor taught me that I can do what I put my mind to. Winsor instills that belief in yourself, and that’s crucial to starting a company.”\n\nASIAM ASSEMBLY EXPLORES ASIAN CULTURE\n\nAffinity group AsIAm led an all-school assembly\n\nCrystal Yang ’20 to encourage appreciation of Asian culture in honor of Lunar New Year. A panel of Winsor alums joined from as far away as London. “It’s been hard to try to find the same sort of place [in college] that AsIAm offers at Winsor,” noted Crystal Yang ’20, who, along with alums Erin Simshauser ’17, Katie Tsai ’19, and Audrey Wu ’20, encouraged students not to take for granted the small community, opportunities for cultural exposure, and affinity groups at Winsor.\n\nOVERHEARD “Maybe we will manage to hold onto that knowledge, that being in a classroom together is not a given nor to be taken for granted. That would definitely be a\n\nsilver lining.” —SARA MACAULAY, ARTS FACULTY\n\nALUMNAE SPRING BOOK CLUB 2021\n\nAlums gathered from across the country on Zoom to discuss the new and very popular The Four Winds by Kristin Hannah. Set during The Great Depression, the novel tells the story of protagonist Elsinor “Elsa” Martinelli and her journey through the Dust Bowl storms of Texas to migrating for refuge and the empty promises of work in California all while enduring being mom to two. Alums discussed themes that resonated especially during crises a century later, the weights that affect how women walk through the world, and what courage really means.\n\nCircle of Excellence\n\nWINSOR The Fall 2020 issue of the Winsor Bulletin was named BULLETIN | SPRING 2020 a Council for Advancement and Support of Education(CASE) 2021 Circle of Excellence Award winner, an award honoring institutions worldwide. A special thanks to Patricia Elam Walker ’71, BOLD AND UNAFRAID who wrote the powerful Patricia Elam ’71 tells the story of Winsor’s first students of color PAGE 24 cover story; Celyn Brazier, whose original art graced the cover; 2communiqué, for elevating the design of every issue; and all the writers, photographers, and members of the Winsor community who contributed.\n\nYAC Pizza Party\n\nYoung Alumnae Committee hosted alums from classes ’17, ’18, ’19, and ’20 for our first on campus gathering in quite some time! It was great to have alums back at Winsor.\n\nWine Tasting with a Twist\n\nIn February, over 130 Winsor alums from all over the country joined Hadley Douglas ’92 and husband TJ, founders of Urban Grape, for a virtual version of the anticipated annual alumnae wine tasting that usually takes place in their Boston store. In honor of Black History Month, the event featured wines from Black-owned wineries, which make up less than 1% of all wines, but 10% of Urban Grape sales thanks to the couple’s commitment to raising awareness and promotion. It was a wonderful way to celebrate the winemakers, and for alums to learn more about wine, the Urban Grape mission, and the industry.\n\nAssistant Director of Young Alumnae Engagement and Leadership Giving Samantha Lovewell and Director of Alumnae Engagement Beth Peterson ’80, P’11 organized the unique event, ensuring the wines and pairing snacks arrived in time for all the virtual attendees to enjoy together. Following the tasting, alums joined break out rooms, and by the close of the evening, all were in agreement that a new Winsor tradition had just begun!\n\nCLASS NOTES\n\n1949\n\nSusan Conant Holden\n\nThis has been a sad and miserable year for so many people. I have been fortunate to keep busy with my children, grandchildren and patriotic societies. I am still the Recording Secretary for two of them (thanks to Winsor) which have been held virtually or on zoom and are a bit of a challenge especially when they decide to have a joint meeting. There is always yard and house work and projects. I am so lucky and thankful to be able to live in my home.\n\n1951\n\nCatharine-Mary Donovan\n\nIt’s hard to believe that 70 years have passed since entering Winsor and to see the changes that have been done since my time there so long ago. Thanks to all my classmates who have contined to respond to my requests for the Annual Fund. It is much appreciated. 2020 has been a year of years: adjustments both for those at home and for those still working. It’s been a year of challenges especially for those keeping us safe. My prayers go out to the thousands and thousands who have left us and to the various people involved who have sacrificed so much for the sick and the dying. Hopefully there is an end in the tunnel.\n\n1951\n\nMargaret Lawrence Drinker\n\nAfter 50 plus years of living in the Boston area we moved to a condominium in Vermont to be closer to several of our children. Six years later we moved a few miles “down the road” to a retirement community in New Hampshire (Kendal at Hanover). Five of our six grandchildren and one great grandchild now live in Boston. My husband, Phil, died in 2017. We had 64 years of a wonderful life together!\n\n1951\n\nAnn Underhill Rosenbaum\n\nI am amazed to find myself 87 years old. The good news is that seven years ago I survived a large sarcoma in my right thigh, and have been well and quite mobile since then. Of course, I have all my faculties, am active in two book groups and a political action group (Women On Watch). My husband, Hal, and I live in a condo in Stamford, CT. So I still cook, etc., which has been a good thing during the pandemic. We have both had completed Pfizer vaccinations. We miss seeing our children (daughter in NY State and son in Concord) and grown grandchildren, but hope we will be able to soon. I wish my classmates well, and hope you have escaped the virus. It was great knowing you at Winsor.\n\n1952\n\nMary Lane Connolly Cairns\n\nDelightful time at ALLIE’s, great to be together! Looking forward to our 70th and can’t believe it in 2022!\n\n1953\n\nNatascha Simpkins Halpert\n\nLiving life quietly here with my beloved, staying close to home in our apartment as we remain safe so far and comfortable. Getting our vaccinations, doing our writing, expecting our third great grandchild, no special news otherwise. How the years fly\n\nby! Two years until our 70th. How strange is that!\n\n1953\n\nSuzanne Ellis Stoyer\n\nAs if the Covid epidemic was not enough for 2020–2021, we were hit by Hurricane Sally which played an unexpected and unwelcome visit in mid-September. The weather report was not as accurate as usual so we were not as well prepared as we should have been. While our living area remained livable, the wind and storm surge destroyed much of everything else. We recover slowly.\n\n1956\n\nAnn Chapman Churchill\n\nI moved with Jerry to Kendal at Hanover a Quaker continuing Care Facility in 2016. We were close to the Churchill Tree Farm in Vermont where all the family visit often. Jerry passed away 3 years ago. During the pandemic, I moved with a daughter to the farm and walk, garden and quilt. I serve on the Vestry of my church and a Social Justice\n\nMary Lane Connolly Cairns ’52, Allie Flather Blodgett ’52, Jill Johnson Whiting ’52, Jack Whiting, and Nancy Paige Parker ’52\n\nCommittee. I am grateful to be in reasonable health and await the time when I can be more socially active.\n\n1958\n\nMary Eliot Jackson\n\nLife is firmly here: I sold my 1810 house in Royalston, live in a 1960 condo in Cambridge, don’t drive, but happily see kids and grands. I remain concerned about effects of racism and have reconnected with Joyce Allen-Beckford, P’ 98, my co-chair of Winsor’s first Diversity Committee. I found Movement Voter Project an epiphany - something to do in a blue state to get rid of Trump. MVP finds, vets, and supports unrecognized grassroots groups and helps them understand that their civic responsibility to vote from the lowest levels up will help them achieve what they want for themselves, i.e., what Stacey Abrams did in Georgia to elect Biden, Warnock, and Ossoff to break Trump and O’Connell’s grip. Also helped the Boston Athenaeum move out a disastrous directress and hire her smashing replacement, Leah Rosovsky; learned about More than Words; and Jim O’Connell’s Health Care for the Homeless.\n\n1960\n\nEleanor Canham Shanley\n\nA quiet year, although no lack of grandchildren, plus two local daughters to keep me busy and amused. We all gathered in Wareham in July—4 daughters, their husbands, seven grandchildren. A great time was had by all. Heading to Woodstock shortly for six days of Spa delights while my daughter skis (and Spas). Cannot wait for a change of venue! Love to you all.\n\n1960\n\nElise Cutler von Koschembahr\n\nSO sorry to miss our 60th Reunion last spring—thanks to Covid. I celebrated my 80th Birthday last month; and I am still grateful to hope that I have a sound mind in a sound body - especially after receiving my double dose of Moderna vaccinations! Peace and blessings to you all!\n\n1961\n\nGayle Zelermeyer Golden\n\nJFK encouraged us to”ask what you can do for your country.” Those inspirational words propelled me into a fulfilling career as a social worker. Working in medical, educational and private practice settings, I helped people face challenges and develop their own capacities to find resilience. I now realize that acknowledging the accomplishments of others is another way to fulfill the mandate to serve. I honor the contribution of my courageous immigrant ancestors, the values of love and faith learned from my parents and the joy I have as the wife of a gentle and loving husband for 51 years, mother of a wonderful son and daughter-in-law and grandmother of an ebullient grandson. I am grateful for the sacrifices my parents made to send me to Winsor. The quality of the faculty and opportunity to study with intelligent and congenial classmates were incredible gifts.\n\n1961\n\nMolly Morse Holmes\n\nBest to all my amazing classmates from 1961 and special thoughts for those who have moved on from here. So hard to believe that 60 years have passed by and that I have lived through all of them. In life you\n\nare given a test that teaches you a lesson.” And what lessons I have learned. I love being the Mother of two and Grandmother to three. They have taught me so much about how I show up in the world with understanding and love. I got divorced in 1996 and that is when I really received my chance to become me. I had my work cut out for me. I now spend my days helping others, never feeling alone and so grateful for my life. I am blessed by the results of all the work I have done and continue with my Singing and Sports which is now golf. Take care everyone. Love, Florel Morse Holmes\n\n1962\n\nSarah Cannon Holden\n\nMonthly ZOOM meetings with classmates have been a positive experience for all of us. We share past, present and future experiences, commitments and dreams. We are learning to know each other all over again and in a deeper and richer way. Try it! The Class of 1962 is full of active, thoughtful and intelligent women. Each of us is thriving in our own particular way. We are glad to be back together where we are working through some of the difficult conversations of our day.\n\n1969\n\nAverill Babson\n\nI find it uplifting and super interesting to be meeting up with a younger class in their experiences with racial justice and inclusion. Other than that, and reading and ZOOMING, I have been hibernating in NH or Maine or CT with family. I am a grandmother now of 2 boys in Maine (Henry 2 years and Theo 4 months) and have been helping during the pandemic as much as I am able to- and have had one shot so far! Be well all!\n\n1971\n\nKate Pratt Lapping\n\nI am still living in Western Massachusetts and very involved with the Vipassana Meditation Center in Shelburne. Because of the pandemic we had to close the center temporarily to regroup and figure out how to hold ten day courses safely. With the help of a student who is also an infectious disease specialist, we managed to open after a few months, albeit with fewer students(from 150+ students to only 38 per course!). It has been a wild ride! For information about the meditation courses visit: www.dhara.dhamma.org\n\n1978\n\nNancy Rappaport\n\nI am adapting to the times and trying to support educators and parents through the pandemic, giving lots of Zoom talks! (www.nancyrappaport. com) you can check them out search covid). Had opportunity with virtual psychiatry to spend time in Colorado with my family, a huge relief. Hope everyone is safe.\n\n1981\n\nEve Berman\n\nForty years ago I predicted that I would be psychoanalyzing Freud’s gorgeous great grandson. Remember our prediction page in the year book? Well, I was both on target and off. I am working with adolescents in a therapeutic manner, but it turned out I would have been more interested in Freud’s gorgeous great granddaughter. I am in my twenty-first year as the school counselor at The Walnut Hill School for the Arts, an international boarding school for high school artists. As you might imagine, it’s been an interesting year supporting the mental health of teens this year, both masked and in-person, and remotely over Zoom. Luckily for me I did meet the gorgeous great granddaughter of someone. Donna has brought sports back into my life, as well as the outdoors. I’ve learned how to ski and mountain bike and love every minute of it! I hope everyone is well. I remember so much of my three years at Winsor and truly remember so much about each member of the class of ’81.\n\n1981\n\nEiblis Goldings\n\nWhat a year! Before I knew what was happening, I added a new pup (2.5yo) to my family. (This made the Pandemic Porch Photo Picture an added challenge!) Sweet Pea has lived up to and beyond her name. Training has been rewarding, and she is full of joy now. We love walking in woods\n\nEiblis Goldings ’81 (dressed for zoom meetings) in a Pandemic Puppy Porch Photoshoot with new pup: Sweet Pea (Lab Mix), and Decker (left), Ohna (right).\n\nNEWSMAKER: LISA MONACO ’86\n\nDOJ Swears In Lisa Monaco\n\nOn April 21, 2021, Lisa Monaco was sworn in as the 39th United States Deputy Attorney General. As the Department of Justice’s No. 2 official, Lisa will be a critical member of the Biden administration as it confronts the nation’s most pressing safety concerns, including the rise in domestic extremism and increasing threats of foreign cyber attacks.\n\nAn expert prosecutor, Lisa first joined the Department of Justice (DOJ) as an intern 26 years ago. Over the course of her impressive career, Lisa served as counsel to Janet Reno when she was attorney general, and was a federal prosecutor in Washington when she joined the Enron task force, helping lead the prosecution of five former Enron executives. In 2006, she became counselor and then chief of staff to then F.B.I. Director Robert S. Mueller III. In 2011, she assumed the role of head of the Department of Justice’s National Security Division, and in 2013, went on to the White House to serve as President Obama’s top homeland security adviser.\n\nLisa’s ability to build consensus has always been an essential component to her continued success. In an April New York Times article, Ken Wainstein, Lisa’s predecessor as the head of the DOJ’s National Security Division, said of Monaco, “Good ideas die all the time because people don’t go to the right congressman or cabinet secretary and get buy-in. That’s the kind of thing that Lisa is masterful at.” A release from the DOJ on the day she was sworn into office captured Lisa’s dedication to the new role. “DAG Monaco reiterated her commitment to reaffirming the Department’s foundational mission and core values, pursuing the Constitution’s promise of equal justice, and ensuring the safety of all who call America home.”\n\nand fields in the Boston area—get in touch if you want to join us!\n\n1981\n\nAmy Linenthal Halliday\n\nTime has been doing strange things during the pandemic, or maybe it just does strange things as the years pass. It amazes me that Paul and I have lived in Charlottesville for nearly twenty-one years, longer than either of us has lived anywhere else. Our nest is empty now, as our sons (Arthur, George, and William) find their way in the world. For the past five years, I’ve been leading a team of writers and editors in the marketing function of the Boston Consulting Group, a job I’ve done remotely all along. Every day, I call on the skills our teachers urged us to practice: listening carefully, reading critically, asking the right questions, speaking up. Honing these is a life’s work! Choral singing is a through-line for me. Fingers crossed that by the time you’re reading this, we’ll be singing— and doing many other fun things— again.\n\n1981\n\nRachel King\n\nTo today’s students, the Class of 1981 is one of those distant classes of “older women”—but when we see each other (on Zoom) this spring, you will all look as beautiful and fresh-faced to me as you did when we graduated! The last forty years of my life in a breathless list: Brown 1985 … Columbia (Master’s) 1988 … Nonprofit communications and fundraising career … Children: Hannah (b. 1997) and Matthew (b. 1999) … Converted to Judaism (2002) … Divorced 2005 … Remarried 2012. Today, I am executive director of a Jewish history organization in Boston; my kids are launching into their adult lives; and I am married to a man who makes me laugh and think. Life is really good. I am forever grateful to Winsor for my love of learning, my passion for good\n\nliterature, my writing ability, and my feminism. The sisterhood and empowerment I experienced there sustains me to this day.\n\n1983\n\nCatherine Livingston\n\nAfter graduating from Wellesley College, I taught Biology and Physics in the Brighton High School in Boston. I am now teaching Biology at The Lawrenceville School while earning my Masters of Science in education from the University of Pennsylvania as part of the Teaching Fellows Program.\n\n1986\n\nLynn Harris\n\nWell, it’s been...a year. Could not have gotten through it without the support of Juliet Siler Eastland and Emily Abedon, and so many other awesome classmates on Facebook. One other highlight: I opened GOLD Comedy on a new platform, where we can truly be *the* online comedy world for young women + non-binary folks who want to nerd out about comedy together. Let’s hope 2021 is funnier than 2020! (The bar is low.) Love to all.\n\n1994\n\nMarie MacLean Riley Woollacott\n\nGrateful for the Colorado outdoors as my family and I hunker down, work from home, stay engaged in school and cohabitate to a degree we never thought possible! I’ll only say, online school for my 8th grader is a far cry from the rigor of Winsor academics!!! Essays, theorems, and late night studying?? More like, eating all day, sleeping while class ‘plays’ and not changing clothes!! Here’s to a brighter future soon!!! Resilience!!!\n\nALUMNAE CREATORS\n\nADCOLOR Receives Emmy® Nomination\n\nFor over two decades, Tiffany Warren ’92 has been a leader in the field of diversity, championing diverse professionals in the creative industries, and garnering tremendous industry respect. The founder and president of ADCOLOR, and current executive VP, chief diversity & inclusion officer for Sony Music Group, can now add an Emmy® nomination to a long list of prestigious accolades.\n\nIn September 2020, ADCOLOR partnered with The Apollo Theater to bring Grammy Award-winning HaitianAmerican rapper, musician, and actor Wyclef Jean to the Main Stage to perform his iconic debut album, “Wyclef Jean Presents The Carnival.” The historic, virtual ADCOLOR 2020 After Dark production kicked off The Apollo Theater’s all-digital fall 2020 season, and was streamed free of charge on the Apollo’s Digital Stage and as part of ADCOLOR Everywhere. The production garnered an Emmy® nomination for ADCOLOR in the Entertainment - Long Form Content category.\n\nIn an interview for Harlem World Magazine in September, Jean said. “I’ve been wanting to do a complete performance of The Carnival for a while now, and I’m excited that I’m able to combine energies with the Apollo and ADCOLOR to pull it off. All three of us are here to celebrate culture, diversity, and the Black American experience, and we’re ready to provide a historic performance that does just that.” In the same piece, Tiffany shared, “It’s truly a remarkable moment for our organization to partner with the Apollo, and it’s all the more iconic with Wyclef doing his first-ever complete performance of The Carnival. I’m here for it, and I know our community will be too.”\n\n1996\n\nAmanda Katz\n\nMy spouse, Kara Swisher, and I welcomed a baby girl, Clara Jo Swisher Katz, in October 2019. She joins my two stepsons, Louie (18) and Alex (15). We moved to Washington, DC, in Feb. 2020—friends who are here, feel free to drop me a line!\n\n2001\n\nClaire Pasternack Goldsmith\n\nWhat a year of tragedy and injustice—littered with silver linings and reason to hope. Brian and I and our children (Eliza, 4 years old and Teddy, 2 in May) baked a lot of challah— when we weren’t connecting into Zoom preschool or singing about excavators. I grew more in my field of online learning this year than I had in the prior ten, as my little corner of education became front and center. I was thrilled to volunteer on our friend Pete Buttigieg’s campaign for President, lead strategic planning for a national professional association, join the board of our synagogue here in LA, and become a Trustee at Winsor. Other than Paris (nothing’s changed), the first place I want to visit is Pilgrim Road. My Winsor classmates are still my best friends. We must empower and educate the women of the future; we will need their leadership.\n\n2006\n\nLaura Gaylord Resch\n\nStill living in Shaker Heights, Ohio with my husband Garner and daughter Regan.

(PMI!) increases access to recreational and competitive sports for Children of Incarcerated Parents (CIPs) and one of Winsor’s own, Alex Horvitz ’11, is a founding member and serves as their marketing & communications lead.\n\nPut Me In! invests to close the opportunity divide for CIPs. PMI! funds annual financial aid grants of $1,000 per year per enrolled CIP to support participation in sports through targeting enrolled CIPs during middle school and supporting them through high school. PMI! identifies CIPs and their caregivers through referrals and collaboration with community-based organizations (“CBOs”), government agencies, and other non-profits serving CIPs and system-impacted families.\n\nAlex shared the inspiration behind PMI!:\n\nPlaying sports at Winsor helped define the person I am today. I remember in middle school going from dryland training at 6 AM, to soccer practice after school, to my evening swim practice after that. I rushed from a swim meet to an indoor lacrosse game every Saturday during the winter months. In high school, I was a tri-varsity athlete and captain of my varsity lacrosse and swim teams.\n\nWinsor gave me confidence; sports gave me a sense of self. Sports also helped me develop tangible skills that I have used and will continue to use throughout my life – leadership, teamwork, strategy, and focus.\n\nI say this recognizing that the reason I could have these experiences was because I grew up with two parents who supported and encouraged me, and my family had the money to pay for league fees and equipment. This is not often the case, particularly for children of incarcerated parents.\n\nHead to putmein.org to learn more about what we do. for year 20!

With the Longwood MBTA station a short walk from campus, students travel by “T” on visits around the city, viewing Boston as an extended classroom. Starting 50 years ago, sixth graders studied Boston intensively, taking weekly field trips to discover Boston past and present. Many graduates fondly remember exploring neighborhoods and cultural institutions in and around the city while becoming veterans of public transportation.\n\nVirtual Alumnae Day 2021\n\nEllen Pinderhughes ’71 was selected by her classmates to deliver this year’s 50th reunion address. The following is extracted from her remarks.\n\nREMEMBERING AND REFLECTING\n\n“We came of age in a troubled world — on the heels of the Civil Rights Movement, during the Black Power Movement, as the Women’s Liberation Movement was underway, during the Vietnam War.\n\nAnd now, as we celebrate our 50th reunion, again we find ourselves in a troubled world. The country is reckoning with four centuries of violent and systemic discrimination that has privileged some and marginalized others... As Winsor, its students, and alums transact with this reality, we all must consider Winsor’s history.”\n\nOUR TIME AT WINSOR\n\n“We were such a diverse class… and yet we didn’t know how diverse we were. We were Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, agnostic, straight, lesbian, from varied income backgrounds, of different ethnicities, though White and Black...\n\nAlthough expected to fit the ‘Winsor girl’ mold (and I could never), our class found ways to assert our interests and ourselves... Our class has — to this day — been the only class to vote to wear what we wanted [at Commencement]. For many of us, the choice was something other than white. Our Commencement picture reflects the\n\ndiversity whom we were and would become, but were not able to fully express in all its complexity while at Winsor and be affirmed.\n\nI wonder how many of us here today know the historical significance of our action. I didn’t until days ago. After our vote, which signaled a moment of reckoning, Winsor was able to reimagine itself...Winsor listened to, accepted, and attempted to understand our protests, and redefined its decades-old self-image that it proudly presented yearly at Commencement. Never again has the entire school been white. WE did that!!!\n\nRECKONING AND REIMAGINING\n\nThrough my lens, Winsor’s last 57 years — since Patricia Elam Walker ’71 and I walked through its doors as its first Black students — has been a complicated history. Winsor has certainly evolved and progressed. Critical changes, including affinity groups and the student-led Board for Equity and Inclusion, signal Winsor’s aspiration to be more inclusive and equitable. Creative, determined admissions processes have helped Winsor reflect more of the diversity in Greater Boston.\n\nThis complicated history also includes the inability to acknowledge and incorporate awareness of some of Winsor’s mistakes, notably a failure in 1996 to disseminate the alumnae/ student panel video on being Black at Winsor from the 1960s to 1990s. See Reflection, Discussion and Connection story for more on the video, which is now available to view on the Winsor website.\n\nAs Winsor reckons with the current reality of its hidden voices, we once again are in a moment full of possibility for reimaging and redefining Winsor. Students will only be equitably supported in their pursuits of self-exploration and expression through a full historical accounting of Winsor’s history. We must bring the decades-old hidden voices of Winsor into the light – perhaps lit by the Winsor lamp.\n\nREFLECTION, DISCUSSION, AND CONNECTION: THE 1996 PANEL\n\nIn July, alums and members of the Winsor community virtually joined Head of School Sarah Pelmas, former Director of School Carolyn McClintock Peter, and former Director of Admission Pamela Parks McLaurin ’71, P’12 for a viewing of the recorded 1996 panel discussion among alums and students of the experiences of Black students at Winsor from 1964 to 1996. The viewing was followed by a moderated conversation.\n\nThe event, created in partnership with Independent Trust, the network designed to build connections, engage, and support the professional goals of independent school alums of color, was facilitated by Gloria Fernandez Tearte. Independent Trust will be inviting BIPOC alums to a meeting later this fall.\n\n“To move forward in our critical DEI work, we must examine where we came from and how our history influences who we are as a school and community today; this video and the lived experiences of our alums are an important part of that history,” said Sarah Pelmas. “More importantly, reflecting on the past and how it influences our present can help us to continue to evolve to create greater equity and inclusion within our community.”\n\nThe recording of the event is available on the Winsor website, under Alumnae News.\n\nALUMNAE PROFILE\n\nClass of 2020 Spotlight\n\nSarah Albert-Rozenberg\n\nSince Brown’s Covid plan did not allow freshmen to begin a full courseload until January 2021, I spent my fall semester in Paris. During my time there, I visited with family, took a freshman seminar class through Brown, privately tutored Chemistry and Writing, and worked as a teaching assistant for Harvard Medical School’s MEDscience program. I then had my first semester on campus at Brown in the spring, during which I started completing some pre-med requirements. Outside of classes, I joined an a cappella group (The Ursa Minors), the Brown Refugee Youth Tutoring and Enrichment (BRYTE) organization, which is similar to Winsor’s Greenwood program, and the executive board of Brown’s chapter of the American Medical Women’s Association (AMWA). This summer, I am working as a counselor at Camp Kinderland, where I have been going since I was eight. Between the end of my semester and the beginning of camp, I resumed my teaching position at Harvard MEDscience and helped develop and write curriculum for their summer program. I also continued volunteering as a French interpreter and translator for the Political Asylum/Immigration Representation (PAIR) Project, for which I began volunteering as part of my ILE.\n\nIndi Aufranc\n\nSince graduating from Winsor last year, I finished my freshman year at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD where I’m currently pursuing a BA in international studies! After a remote first semester, I moved onto campus in January and was able to meet a lot of my classmates and explore the city. I’d also joined a student-run podcast earlier in the year (the Hopkins Podcast on Foreign Affairs– check us out on Spotify!!!) that I became more involved with in the spring and am continuing to work on this summer as Chief Marketing Officer. I’m spending this summer in Seattle, WA interning at a food blog and media company and staying with my extended family. Next semester, I’m looking forward to being an orientation leader, moving back on campus, and having a more normal year than the last one!\n\nDanya Dubrow-Compaine\n\nLike many people in my grade, I decided to take a gap year this year. I spent September-May living in Israel, first in Jerusalem and then in Tel Aviv. While I was there, I interned at the Jerusalem Press Club, worked at a local garden, and volunteered at a women’s community center for Eritrean refugees. I started taking Brazilian Ju Jitzu classes and even became a waitress for a few weeks at a restaurant that had just opened. I also had the chance to travel around the country and cross more than a few items off my bucket list: rappelling, SCUBA diving, and skydiving to name a few. As someone who is interested in studying the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in college, my time spent there was invaluable. Against the rules of my program, I went into the West Bank to volunteer with a Palestinian shepherd and talk to Palestinians living in Ramallah. I was also there to experience the most recent flair up in violence and had to run to bomb shelters on multiple occasions. After two weeks at home, I packed up again and moved to spend six weeks living in Aix-en-Provence, France on the Saltonstall scholarship. During my time here, I’m taking classes on psychopathology and media and conflict and using my free time to explore as much as I can (currently on a train to Paris as I write this). This year has been an amazing whirlwind of experiences, and I can’t wait for the adventure to continue when I start college in the fall.\n\nTina Gong\n\nWhile not originally intending to, I ended up taking a gap year because of the pandemic. I spent my gap year exploring new and interesting fields by taking some cool online classes in subjects not offered at Winsor, like digital painting, concept art illustration, and computer science! In my free time I began regularly exploring Boston’s variety of (both new and old) restaurants (in a covid-safe manner), creating lots of art, watching movies, sharpening my cooking skills, and taking care of my plants at home. This fall, I will finally be on campus as a freshman at Harvard! I’ll be fencing for the Crimson team and am interested in studying computer science, physics, and maybe a touch of philosophy and art at Harvard.\n\nBriggs Negron\n\nI am currently in my sophomore year at NYU and have begun to complete required courses for my major in political science and am working with the program You Can Too, a mentorship program in which we mentor black and hispanic kids applying to college. As a You Can Too mentor I connected with my mentee in Texas via zoom and helped her design her resume, understand the common app, and navigate other college application resources. While clubs and sports were mostly closed or held only via zoom last year, a couple of clubs I am looking forward to joining in the coming in-person school year are the Puerto Rican Association (Pra), possibly some form of student government, and the BIPOC LGBTQ+ club Sisters. I also want to join the crew team when sports open up again in the fall and take advantage of all the in-person resources NYU has to offer!\n\nMichelle Pu\n\nI had a great first year at Tufts University! I am planning to double major in Biology and Child Studies and Human Development on the premedical track. During school, I mentored with the organization Strong Women Strong Girls and am now a member of the executive board. I was also a member of Tufts EMS-AID, which collected and distributed medical supplies to hospitals in Venezuela. This summer, I’m an intern at The Price Center, which serves people with developmental and intellectual disabilities. I’m also volunteering for Horizons for Homeless this summer and next semester. In my free time, I’ve been taking care of my 75 plants, drawing, and playing volleyball. Next year, I will play club volleyball, volunteer, and mentor. This past year has been an amazing and challenging growth experience and I’m looking forward to next semester!\n\nBriggs Negron\n\nSarah Albert-Rozenberg Indi Aufranc Michelle Pu\n\nDanya DubrowCompaine\n\nTina Gong\n\nEva Shin\n\nEva Shin\n\nAfter graduation, I spent the summer working at a beekeeping company, helping with the Summer at Winsor basketball program, and spending time with my family! Beekeeping was supposed to be my ILE but didn’t work out due to COVID, so I was really excited that I had the opportunity to work there over the summer. I got to drive all over the state checking on people’s backyard beehives and then harvesting the honey. In the fall, I was lucky to get to attend Haverford College in person (although like many, all my classes were virtual). Between COVID, a campus-wide strike for racial justice, a concussion, and trying to acclimate to being out of state without the option to travel home due to the pandemic, it was certainly an unusual and challenging freshman year. Fortunately, I had a great roommate (whose grandmother taught at Winsor!) and had the opportunity to play lacrosse, a welcome change from spending so much time in my room. I’m happy to be home and to get to see friends in person for the first time in more than a year, and I’m looking forward to a more normal sophomore year!\n\nShantel Teixeira\n\nThough this past year certainly defied all expectations, I learned so much about myself as an emotional being and dug into areas of my craft as a musician that I never thought I’d encounter before. Spending the entirety of my first year at Berklee College of Music in my bedroom and studying an aural art form through a computer screen felt so unnatural, but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of having my exploration of the vast world of music as my primary focus. I also had the privilege of becoming a member of Treble Threat, Berklee’s only all-women & non-binary a cappella group! Though we never had the opportunity to sing in the same room, we were surprisingly able to accomplish so much in a virtual setting. I actually recently became President of the group as well so I am definitely looking forward to leading the group and performing in-person this upcoming year! Apart from college life, I’ve also released my first piece of original music and featured in a powerful song and music video with an artist friend of mine! Wishing all of us a more fruitful and promising year ahead :)\n\nShantel Teixeira\n\nIfeanyi Umunna Hi Class of 2020!\n\nSince we graduated, I have interned for a congressional campaign, completed my first year at American University where I’m majoring in political science, and am presently interning at the Baltimore Office of the Public Defender. Although my freshman year was remote, next year, I’ll be an RA for our on-campus Black Affinity Housing and a TA for my Leadership certificate program. I also serve on the executive board of our Black Student Union. On a fun note, I also learned how to make whipped cream from scratch! I hope everyone is well!\n\nAnahita von Andrian\n\nSince graduating, I have moved to New York City to study Film & Television Production at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts and run my freelance corporate, commercial, and personal creative content production company. I directed a multi-phase creative “social-first” ad campaign for MUZE Music Inc, a platform for individuals to book live entertainment online over Zoom, directed\n\nIfeanyi Umunna\n\nAudrey Wu\n\nand produced three short silent experimental films, and wrote eight scripts (one of which is currently in production). I also helped create the pilot episode of Art Majors, a majority LGBTQ+ crew & cast TV show pushing for queer representation in the TV and media industry, as assistant director, executive producer, assistant editor, and graphics animator. I have spent a lot of valuable time this past year on my peer’s sets as a director of photography and continue to pursue independent creative visual projects through various mediums - photography, multi-dimensional animation, digital imaging, editing etc. Because the nature of filmmaking is so incredibly collaborative, I ran into plenty of challenges given the pandemic and social distancing. Navigating the exhausting and expensive road to ensuring COVID-19 precautions and standards were practiced on all\n\nAnahita von Andrian\n\nsets, big and small, required a higher level of organization, which I’d argue beneficially resulted in more precise filmmaking. Creating and collaborating on films this year was not for the faint of heart, but it wasn’t impossible, and in a way, forced me to develop as a creator in ways I may not have sans-pandemic. It will be interesting to see how I will apply and grow on these skills during the next academic year, hopefully post-pandemic.\n\nAudrey Wu\n\nHello! I’m writing from London, currently pursuing a degree in composition at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.\n\nI’ve spent my past few weeks finishing up a new work, “receive | repeat | restore | redeem,” commissioned by The Halfmoon ensemble, who premiered my music at the Roslindale Substation on Wednesday, June 23. This is part of a multimedia piece called “PrintWorks” that opened the annual summer concert series by SoHIP (Society for Historically Informed Performance).\n\nOne of my other major projects this year was a work for full orchestra, recorded text, and fixed media titled “IN HONOR OF ETHEL.” The piece pays homage to British composer and suffragette Ethel Smyth, a notable figure in the history of classical music — and whose music I played in Winsor’s Community Ensemble under the baton of Ms. Rice!\n\nThe work is a part of a larger initiative, the Illuminated River project, which is a massive art installation that lights up the bridges across the Thames River. We’ve been asked to write music to celebrate the project as a collaboration between the Guildhall School and the City of London.\n\n50TH REUNION\n\nClass of 1971\n\n1st row L-R: Mary Barnes, Elizabeth Nardi, Martha Gergely Picciotti, Elizabeth Colten, Patricia Elam, Anstiss Miller Wynn, Miss Wing, Barbara Gardner, Miss Dresser, Priscilla Olive Motley, Laura Potter Cahn, Hope Coolidge, Andrea Casner Stephens, Franny Wheeler-Berta. 2nd Row L-R: Sara Lacy, Catherine Rogers, Marie Ryburn Foster, Elisabeth Wright Wigglesworth, Barbara Clark McCartney, Cynthia Sortwell, Elizabeth Swartz, Ellen Pinderhughes, Pamela Parks McLaurin, Marilyn Dawson, Alice Agoos, Mary Sullivan, Amy Rappaport Arambula, Louise Riemer, Virginia King Greenwood, Augusta Mixter Edwards, Ellen O’Donnell Broggi, Margaret Quine McGovern. 3rd Row L-R: Kate Pratt Lapping, Susan Dean, Sarah Wilson, Patricia Green Dunn, Joy Beane Brieant, Barbara McLean O’Neil, Lucy Bradshaw, Martha Rhodes, Emily Feinberg, Nancy Braasch Allen, Susan Lafferty, Jennifer Slingerland Skeele, Luisa Hunnewell, Diane Souvaine, Andrea Frost Young, Pamela Jenney Taft, Linda Alles, Karen Gordon Mills, Wendy Harding French Alice Agoos\n\nFifty years ago, my graduation speech focused on friendship. I still believe that friends are the best part of my Winsor experience though I also appreciate how many opportunities have come my way thanks to Winsor instruction. Milestones: college, moving to New York for graduate school, writing jobs, marriage to Patrick Ryan, two children, Molly and Solomon; 28-years living in a NYC suburb with multiple volunteer commitments; co-founding a newsletter/conference business with my husband; surviving working together for 20 years and selling the business; becoming a Florida resident (while insisting I was too young); writing a children’s book (based on a Class VII French assignment); starting another blog/newsletter with my husband (looking into having my sanity checked); becoming a grandmother; spending much of the last four years bemoaning the state of our country; thankful to visit our children on the West Coast, even last summer; hopeful we are making progress.\n\nJoy Beane Brieant\n\nAfter Winsor, I did a PG year at Andover, then Barnard College and Fordham Law School. Married to Charles Brieant; we have three children, the youngest, Emily, is a sophomore at Stanford, so I am still working. I have had a varied career path, starting out in a federal clerkship, moving on to a large law firm for 12 years, then eight years in academia, and nine years in judicial education. I am currently enjoying work as a court attorney referee in Westchester Surrogate’s Court, as well as continuing as an adjunct at Pace Law School. I clearly remember walking into the Winsor vestibule for my interview with Miss Knapp (!) when I was in 4th grade and deciding then and there\n\nthat I would go to Winsor. I had no idea about private schools and vaguely thought my parents might be sending me to a private school because there was something wrong with me, but I have never (before or since) been so certain of a decision. My eight years at Winsor were occasionally bumpy; especially in the lower school, I questioned whether I belonged. I value the excellent education, and I think often (and fondly) of our classmates.\n\nLaura Potter Cahn\n\nOverall adulthood has been very good to me. I recently retired from my dream job-staff attorney with the Juvenile Rights Practice of the Legal Aid Society. It turns out thirty-eight years representing abused and neglected children in Brooklyn Family Court was enough. I have been married thirty-seven years to a man who can be best described as a true soul mate. We have three sons, two daughters-in-law and two grandchildren. I have been able to indulge my passion of travel to unusual places including Mongolia, Madagascar, Greenland, Patagonia, Laos. We had a trip planned for Cambodia but covid got in the way. I am glad that Winsor is addressing the huge problem of racism in this society. I do worry, however, that perpetuating a system of small elite prep schools, no matter how integrated, actually does more to exacerbate rather than ameliorate systemic racism.\n\nHope Coolidge\n\nFour years at Williams College (first admitted class of women, so immediately a sharp contrast to Winsor), emerging with a degree in Russian area studies/history, and the man I would marry about 10 years later. We spent a year in Mark’s hometown of Louisville, KY, where I worked for the Lost Cause Press selling microfiche to universities. Then back to the Boston area and a job as business manager at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Then a Simmons MBA, followed by a variety of finance/CFO positions at some great nonprofits - National Consumer Law Center, Danforth Museum, Royal Oak Foundation in NYC, Central Square Theater, Boston Public Library Foundation. Now CFO at Star Island (based in Portsmouth, NH, so mostly remote). Two great children born somewhere between ISGM and the MBA: Emily, a learning technology specialist at the Harvard libraries, and Clayton, a structural engineer at SGH. We’ve traveled all over as a family, most recently to visit Mark’s family in France, with a side trip to Mont St Michel, a place I’d always wanted to see. Mark and I live on a dirt road in Sherborn, MA and spend a lot of time in the White Mountains of NH.\n\nPatricia Green Dunn\n\nIt’s hard to believe that its been 50 years post Winsor! I am feeling blessed and content with the path I have traveled since graduation. I continued my education at Pine Manor ’73, Colby College ’75 and received an MBA from Babson College in ’77. Married Steve Dunn in 1978 (Belmont Hill ’70, Brown ’74). We raised 3 children in Wellesley and Needham. Somehow they followed in our footsteps: Melissa- Winsor ’98, Colby ’02, Rob- Belmont Hill ’01, Colgate ’05, Cornell ’10, and Scott- Belmont Hill ’03, Brown ’07. During the children’s school years, I was an active volunteer in their schools as well as with the Friends of Dana Farber and my garden club. I became interested in floral design and after many classes and workshops I joined Winston Flowers in their Wellesley location for 10 years. Steve joined a firm in Manhattan in 2005, and after a lifetime in Boston, we moved to Greenwich,CT. I became interested in garden design and studied to become a Certified Landscape Designer. I have been practicing on my own for the past 11 years. Steve retired at the end of 2019 and we now live full time in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. We have 4 beautiful grandchildren that bring us great joy. When I’m not working, I like to stay active and enjoy tennis, pickleball and golf.\n\nPatricia Elam-Walker\n\nFirst of all I still don’t understand how this happened. How it is our 50th reunion and how when I look in the mirror do I now see my mother even though I still feel 30ish on the inside? (My body would probably beg to differ, though.) But here we are at our 50th reunion. I have to say it was wonderful to see everyone (even on Zoom) and hear some of what people have been up to all these years. I have been back to visit and speak at Winsor a few times and I’m pleased with the strides it has made in terms of diversifying the faculty, staff and student body. I know it still has further to go and I’m glad younger folks are holding Winsor’s metaphorical “feet to the fire”. Pam McLaurin and I took gap years after Winsor, were roommates and only applied to colleges that began with “A” and were in the front of the college handbook. She went\n\nto Antioch and I went to Adelphi. A big LOL but it turned out fine for us both. Even though I loved writing I couldn’t see the path forward so I did what many scared writers do—went to law school. Practiced for 16 years in Boston and Washington, DC where I ended up raising my three incredible children. Justin, 38, is an actor, writer and producer in LA; Denzel, 32, is a basketball golf coach at a private high school in VA; and Nile, 28 is a professional dancer currently working with a dance company in Seattle. They amaze me with how smart, creative and wise they are. And they are thoughtful, caring people doing good in the world. What more can you ask? No grandchildren, though, only grandpets. Oh and along the way, I’ve had three marriages. The one I’m in now is my last, I promise. He’s a lawyer I met when I was in law school some 40 whatever years ago. I wouldn’t date him then cause he was too nice. Lol again. We reconnected some 14 years ago and have been married 8 years. We live in Takoma Park, MD after I dragged him kicking and screaming from Boston. He’s retired but still teaching law, drawing cartoons and taking stunning photographs as he jogs and bikes around town. I teach fiction and creative non-fiction to my brilliant Howard University students and have begun writing children’s books, partly in honor of my mom, a children’s librarian. The first, Nana Akua Goes to School came out last summer and the second, Dream Street, will be published in September. I’m also finishing another adult novel, writing plays, essays and short stories. I love my life, want to stay healthy and travel to see more of this world. I just pray for enough time to do it all!\n\nEmily Feinberg\n\nI am fortunate to continue to have productive work and family close by. I have remained in Boston (Jamaica Plain) and work at BU Medical School doing mental health services research focused on improving primary care systems for vulnerable families. I also work as a pediatric nurse practitioner at a local health center. My kids live within walking distance. I get to see them and the 4 grandkids very often. Two years ago, my spouse who was also my best friend and colleague, died of pancreatic cancer after a brief 6 months. I never expected grief to be so difficult and could not have made it through without support of family and friends (including Winsor classmates). I love to escape to the woods to cross country ski and hike. Last winter (preCOVID), I squeezed in an amazing trip to Yellowstone National Park. The election was a high point of an otherwise hard year. It was great to engage the whole family in get out the vote efforts. I am so relieved by the change in country’s direction and impressed by the incredible work done by voting rights activists. I am encouraged about our collective reckoning with the racism and am cautiously optimistic about the future.\n\nMarie Ryburn Foster\n\nAfter almost 40 years of living in Annapolis, MD where our 4 children were raised, my husband Malcolm and I bought a 2nd home in Damariscotta, Maine - 5 miles away from his family’s summer home and near to his siblings. We are now both retired and divide our time between Maine and Annapolis, often stopping on the long drive to visit our son and 1 & 3 year old grandsons who live in the Boston area. We spend as much time as possible either on the water or in our gardens, and look forward to the time when we can visit with friends and family in a Covid free world!\n\nWendy Harding French\n\nGosh, I can’t believe 50 years have past. I must say I have lived a great life. I have been married for 47 years to Jim French. (Ha ha, remember how poorly I did in French.) We live in Southborough MA, and have raised six children, two boys, and four girls. The boys work as landscapers, two girls are nurses, one a teacher, and one a nanny. We did it. Love having a big family. They all live near, except for one who is in NC, living by the beach, where we tend to go for our vacations. The oldest got married 4 year ago, and the fifth one got married two years ago. Last Fall we were blessed with our first grandchild, a boy, who lives about 1/2 hour away. It is so nice to see him a lot, especially during these turbulent times. During the years, I have watched other people’s children for extra cash, and cashiered at BJ’s. Otherwise, I was a stay at home mom raising my children. Jim and I became Christians 40+ years ago, and have been very active in our church over the years, and made most of our friends there. Strange watching Church on Facebook and Zooming Bible Studies. We love to grow vegetables, read thrillers, and go camping.\n\nVirginia King Greenwood\n\nAfter leaving Winsor, I attended Penn, where, as a sophomore, I began dating Rick, the man I later married. We were in DC for a few years after graduation. I worked first as a volun-\n\nteer, then as paid staff, for Legal Aid as a paralegal and manager of the Family Branch office. We moved to Providence RI after marrying in 1978 for Rick to attend Grad School at Brown. Vowing never to work domestic relations again, I had several menial jobs before ending up back as a paralegal, doing Domestic Relations again and worked for the same attorney, at two different firms until my retirement. Rick and I had three kids, Molly, Sam and Lucy, and I now have three grandsons. I lost Rick to cancer in 2014 and still miss him terribly. However, I live in one of the most beautiful and serene places on earth (Little Compton, Rhode Island) am very active in my new community and have taken several great trips with Jennie Slingerland Skeele and Margaret Quine McGovern and since Covid we’ve been zooming regularly.\n\nLuisa Hunnewell\n\n50 years ago, a lifetime since we graduated, but it’s gone so quickly. After Winsor, college, business school (no business background, but could write a coherent argument thanks to Winsor and managed to get through) and then long stints at Chemical Bank and Willowridge Partners (an investment business I built from the ground up with my brother-in-law). A couple of years in Madrid, but basically have lived in NYC where I married, and we brought up two wonderful children. Over the years I was lucky enough to convince my husband that Wellesley would be a good ultimate home. We’ve just retired and moved back, across the street from where I grew up. Retirement so far is not what we expected, but it ultimately will be. We are blessed with health, family and friends, trips to visit our children and new granddaughter in California and hopefully further explorations as things open up. We have lots to do and learn in taking care of a big garden and look forward to becoming more involved in a variety of different Boston organizations with interests ranging from horticulture to social support networks - all things I missed in an all too busy work environment.\n\nSusan Lafferty\n\nAt commencement in 1971, wearing my non-white dress proudly, I watched the 50th reunion class file in and wondered what I would be like when I celebrated my own. Now I know. Here are the highlights: Graduated Bard College 1975. After a brief stint in advertising, I joined the training program at Filene’s in Boston. After my first horrendous day, which was also the blizzard of ’78, I spent the next week at home wondering if I had made the wrong choice. That marked the beginning of a 37-year career in the fashion world. Along the way I managed to I marry, move to Connecticut, have three children, run the Boston Marathon, resume my career in NYC, lose a husband to cancer, become a single parent, move to Martha’s Vineyard to recalibrate, return to Connecticut, re marry, relocate to the Berkshires, and reinvent myself for this next chapter. Fashion and design still play a major role in everything I do- gutting and renovating two houses in Stockbridge, writing a blog and speaking in public. I am now a Realtor, a grandmother of three and wonder if I am really as old as Miss Dresser.\n\nKate Pratt Lapping\n\nHow to compress 50 years into 200 words? After graduating I ended up in India after an overland journey full of misadventures (my passport stolen in Afghanistan in the middle of winter was one of many...). I heard about Vipassana meditation courses from some of the other western hippies and it was like a fire had been lit. I sat my first course in Dalhousie in 1972 and found a wonderful tool for the rest of my life. Fast forward to 1982 when a group of us founded the first Vipassana Meditation center in the US, located in Shelburne, Massachusetts. The property had an old house and barn on 8 acres of land and we didn’t have a clue what we were doing! But we were all young and enthusiastic and somehow it all worked out. Now the center has facilities for 155 people, with 10-day residential courses every two weeks. Barry and I married in 1982 and we are the head teachers for this center as well as one in Delaware. It has been a satisfying life so far! If anyone is interested you can see the center at: www.dhara.dhamma.org and I’d be happy to give you a tour.\n\nMargaret Quine McGovern\n\nFollowing college, I moved to New York City for a few crazy years in advertising, before driving cross-country to San Francisco, where I still live. Worked some more in advertising before making a switch. Had a wonderful 7 month back-packing trip in New Zealand with Jim, and got married in Vermont after we returned. We have a son Grant (35) and daughter Ashley (32). I have been working for Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute for about 20 years, supporting a couple of research teams and\n\ncoordinating the Institutional Review Board. Traveling has been a passion, internationally and our National Parks. I’ve enjoyed being in a flute choir for a number of years. I have kept up with a few close Winsor friends, notably Sarah Wilson, Jennie Slingerland Skeele and Ginny King, and Jeannette Herrmann. I really wish we could all be getting together in person for our reunion. It was such a special time ten years ago.\n\nPamela Parks McLaurin\n\nWhen my second life at Winsor ended in June 2020 after 18 years as Director of Admission & Financial Aid, I decided to spend time becoming a better artist. A juried review of five of my sculptures earned me membership into the National Association of Women Artists (NAWA) along with an invitation to join the Massachusetts chapter (NAWAMA). I showed pieces in two group exhibitions this past fall in the SOWA art district galleries here, in Boston. My husband Bill and I hope to move to Savannah, Georgia by the end of 2021 where we bought a home, sight unseen, in 2019. 9,000 artsy fartsy students study at SCAD contributing to Savannah’s wonderfully eclectic (and quite ‘blue’) southern city. Our daughter, Evan Joy ’12, will continue teaching health full-time at Winsor.\n\nBarbara McLean O’Neil\n\nWriting, reading and art have been life-long pleasures for me. Perhaps it began with handwritten notes passed in secret in the Winsor School library, or memorizing The Lake Isle of Innisfree for a seventh grade assignment. Singing Handel’s Messiah, two glee clubs joined one winter evening. Reviewing lists of Latin vocabulary with a friend as we trudged home from school. English essays returned with teacher comments; “Give more detail.” And so I did, and still do. With a colleague, I created a library at the newly formed Atrium School and taught literature, folklore and research to young students. I made books by hand with my two daughters, sewing bindings with waxed thread, and filling the pages with writing and drawing. Now I do the same with my three year-old granddaughter. Over the years, I have developed my own writing practice, studying with many teachers. I now lead writing groups locally, prodding others to share their authentic stories. I run a yearly retreat, Deepening the Writing Life, gathering writers from across the country in Taos, New Mexico. In 2020, my writing classes on Zoom brought us closer in a year of isolation. David and I have lived in the same place for forty years. Roots deep in Lincoln soil.\n\n1 Martha Gergely Picciotti\n\nAfter graduation from Winsor I received a BA in arts focusing on architecture from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. This was followed by a move to Los Angeles where I earned a master’s degree in architecture from the UCLA School of Urban Planning and Architecture in 1981. For the next 3 years I remained in Los Angeles working for various architectural firms with a focus on residential design. In 1984 I decided to escape from the city life of Los Angeles and moved to Mammoth Lakes, California to ski and practice architecture. I met my husband Ron on the slopes and joined him in Ventura, California where he was working for Chevron Oil Company. We were married in 1987 in the house I grew up in Nahant. From 1985 to 1993 I worked for several architectural and development firms in Santa Barbara and obtained my California architectural license in 1987. In 1993 I founded my own practice based in\n\n2\n\n1/2. Pam McLaurin sculptures; Head is named “Act III” and the hands are “Stop! #MeToo”\n\nVentura specializing in custom residential architecture. We purchased a vacant lot on the Ventura hillside in 1999. Together with my husband acting as owner/builder I designed and Ron supervised the construction of our house with attached office overlooking the Pacific coastline. We love it here, although I will always be an east coaster at heart. Ron works with me in the practice. We have two cats and no children. I stay busy with my work as an architect, my passion developing the Ventura Botanical Gardens, practicing yoga and making pottery - I always wished Winsor had a ceramics studio. My life is full and fulfilling.\n\nEllen Pinderhughes\n\nHow to distill 50 years’ highlights into 200 words- here goes...My Winsor years were so formative not just in excellent academic preparation, but also in navigating White spaces, which I have done through most of my academic and professional career. Early career: day care\n\n3. Ellen Pinderhughes ’71\n\nteacher and director, psychologist/ therapist. Professor in academia since 1989: Cleveland State, Vanderbilt and Tufts Universities, with some administration as department chair and interim Chief Diversity Officer. At Eliot-Pearson Dept. of Child Study and Human Development, I study cultural processes in/contextual influences on parenting in families facing challenging circumstances. Teaching focuses on promoting understanding of our social identities and systemic marginalization in culturally sensitive interactions and research. Also teach in Diversity and Inclusion Leadership Program. Love mentoring young professionals. My personal update: lived in Colorado, Connecticut, Ohio and Tennessee, am now in Brookline with my husband, Bernard Greene (now retired, Chair of Brookline’s Select Board). My children have been highlights of my life as I loved each of their developmental stages. Olivia lives in Brooklyn with her partner; she’s an international lawyer. Marshall lives in Boston with his wife and attends UMass part-time. Love meditating, yoga, sunrises and sunsets, walking, swimming, movies and reading. Treasure my friendships.\n\nMartha Rhodes\n\nOh, rather than look back at the year, I’d rather look ahead—more poems to write, students to teach, friends to get together with—after too long apart—a move out of—but an inch away from NYC, more trips around this troubled but hopefully healing country. We are, at this writing, doing well in our NYC loft in Tribeca. We will move to a house we own in NJ, ground level rather than walk up (though I will miss our loft). A garden—for this New Yorker, that’s something to really look forward to. And a splendid view of Manhattan which I have grown to love, though I am, in my blood, always a 10-miles-southwest- of-Boston Bostonian. Let’s get together in 2022 for real. Sick of this virtual stuff.\n\nJennifer Slingerland Skeele\n\nMy “Winsor” numbers: 50 years since graduating, 8 as a student, 44 (and counting) teaching English (from class III to seniors), and another 12 as a Winsor parent while daughters Kate and Anna attended. Have I had any non-Winsor years? Six: four in college, two post college before returning to Winsor to teach and learn ever since. Winsor’s English Department became “home” when I had Judy Robbins. After I married Charlie in 1975, I’ve loved watching our two daughters grow up, and now, at last, I’m relishing perhaps my favorite role as Granny to Kate’s kids, Henry (8) and Eliza (5) and Anna’s kids Zoë (3), and Ava (1.5). I have found and done what I have loved most, filling my years with teenagers, books, and new ideas. I’ve also done some traveling (though not enough), some skiing (again, not enough), and am now embarking on learning to sail our small sailboat. Ginny and Margaret, my nearly lifelong friends, have become my spring break trip buddies. We look forward to more travel when the world re-opens. Winsor, it turns out, has done more than start my life; it has been, in large measure, my life, for which I am grateful.\n\nCynthia Sortwell\n\n“Oh the places we’ll go and the paths we’ll travel.” I could never have imag-\n\nined my life 50 years post graduating from Winsor. After a year in Paris and graduation from Boston University, I was fortunate enough to have gotten into medical school at Washington University followed by a residency in Pediatrics in Rochester NY, and then to practice in Portland Maine. After four years of ear infections and a curiosity about the mind, I went back and trained as a child and adult psychiatrist both on the west coast and here in Portland, Maine where I continue to practice. In my thirties, I was extremely fortunate to meet my spouse, Jessie who was up for adopting an infant from Cambodia now a 22 year old adult. My family is the thing that I am most grateful for, as they are loving, generous and forgiving. I will say that I’ve never lost my love of the outdoors or of physical activity which keeps me sane. The years at Winsor with the small classes and caring teachers were such a solid and important foundation to the rest of my life.\n\nMary Sullivan\n\nA quick recap of 50 years. A wonderful husband, two terrific daughters, and now a son-in-law, a grandchild, and another on the way. Throughout these years school, work, and family have brought me across the country from Alaska to Detroit to Montana to Philly to Kentucky. Visiting children and various nieces and nephews has meant sleeping in the desert of Wadi Rum, walking through the markets of Arusha, Tanzania, and visiting health clinics in the KwaZulu Natal of South Africa. What a big, gorgeous world.\n\nMy career path was set early by a wonderful father who urged me to go to law school at age 16, and by Miss Elma Lewis, founder of the Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts in Roxbury, who came to the school in the late ‘60s and urged those of us who were interested in social justice to go out and work with the white communities from which we came. And so, after working for a few years after getting out of college, I became a labor lawyer. I worked with the building trades unions here in Greater Boston to expand the training programs and their membership to include more women and people of color, and represented employees in employment discrimination cases, among other things. After nearly three decades of that work a lucky star appeared, and my application to the bench was accepted by Governor Deval Patrick. I have served on our state intermediate appeals court for a decade and will retire upon reaching mandatory retirement age in two years. Perhaps then this pandemic will be over and I can board an airplane again to travel the world again.\n\nOur years at the school were difficult ones both in the world at large and within the walls of Pilgrim Road. Like many of you I have not returned, except for the presentation organized by Ellen at our 25th reunion, as moving and important and event as one could attend. But I made lifelong friends. And the education we received, from teachers like Sylvia Sherman (RIP), Nancy Leverich (RIP), and Judy (Wortham) Robbins rivaled any class I took anywhere, including those I took at Amherst College as a five college visiting student. They gave me the career and the life I now have. They taught us to think and they taught us to write. What rare gifts.\n\nFrances Wheeler-Berta\n\nHello all! I feel compelled to write given the weighty and dubious distinction of 50 years - Long story short, my professional and civic life has been focused on advocacy; I worked for 25 years as teacher/counselor and administrator at an alternative high school and also co-founded a non profit that supports teens in the mid coast Maine community I’ve called home (and where we raised our family). Fast forward to 2015 when I found myself in Tucson, working with asylum seekers at Casa Alitas, a shelter that provides food, clothing and goodwill. It is an extraordinary place and one where we experience the best of humanity each day. I’m glad to be in touch with a few classmates online and wish all of you the very best! Sending much love to you all.\n\nSarah Wilson\n\nAfter college, I worked at the Opera Company of Boston’s costume shop, in the North End, where women still chatted with one another out of their windows. Moved to Chapel Hill, NC, a place full of old time and bluegrass musicians, where I took up fiddle and the guitar. Day and nightlong music parties at old farmhouses in the country, and camp-out festivals throughout the South, where jamming was the main activity. I am still playing music. After nursing school, I worked as an RN at Duke University Hospital, on psychiatry and surgery floors. After my MSW, moved to Seattle and worked at community mental health and family counseling agencies and as a psychiatric social worker in the ER. Major obsessions were aikido and the fiddle. I had six years of training with a gifted aikido\n\nteacher, then left, with a few others, in the wake of his improprieties. We renovated a new practice space and started our own dojo, now thriving. Later, I moved to San Francisco. In 2016 I lost my sister Anne, Winsor ’66, who died from multiple autoimmune disorders. I’m partnered with a man I knew through music, a widower and father of three. Lately I’ve been “orthopedically challenged”, but I hope soon I can get back to hiking. I am hugely relieved to have a new president in place.\n\nAnstiss Miller Wynn\n\nAfter my father died in late 1971, I took a year in between Winsor and college to gather my wits, focus on new goals, really, to find myself. That took an awfully long time. However my journey through a decades-long sampling platter gave me experiences that eventually turned into resume builders and stories to tell my students, children and grandchildren. I developed an interest in agriculture during my senior year at Winsor. I pursued that topic with college education in small steps, interspersed with life experiences and jobs. I married, had two sons, and owned a sheep farm in upstate NY for a few years. I also worked in a large animal clinic. Eventually, as a newly single mother, my interests turned to education. When my youngest entered 1st grade, I transferred into Cornell and graduated in 1991 with a degree in Agriculture, General Science and Biology education. We moved to Indiana in 1991. I married again 1992. I worked as an education programs manager at the Indianapolis Zoo, ran a small business with my husband, then finally arrived at what I really wanted to do - public school teaching. I taught middle school science until 2018 and loved just about every minute. I retired on schedule to help manage my mother’s increasing needs. I continued to present special projects in the schools and take some long-term subbing up until 2020. My husband and I live on acreage on the Big Walnut Watershed in west central Indiana. We raise bees and flowers, garden, hike, drive tractors and enjoy visits from grandchildren.\n\n25TH REUNION\n\nClass of 1996\n\nSarah Melvoin Bridich\n\nAlthough still a New Englander at heart, Denver definitely feels like home at this point. My husband, Jeff, and I have spent over 15 years here and our kids (Ben and Maya, ages 12 and 11) consider themselves Coloradans. When we first came out West, I was a high school administrator and history teacher. As the kids arrived, I pivoted back to grad school (in Ed Leadership); since graduating, I have worked in a non-profit, conducted research on education leadership, taught as an adjunct professor, served on multiple non-profits Boards (charter school, independent school, and non-profit) and am currently exploring the intersection between civic engagement and education. I also spend a great deal of time shuttling the kids around town (and am thankful that this is even possible) and watching Rockies baseball games. While it would be lovely to connect in person, I am grateful that we can gather virtually.\n\nLiese Fritze Brown\n\nIt’s hard to believe that we graduated 25 years ago. After Winsor, I took a gap year to travel around the world. Then it was onto college where I rowed for two years, played squash for two years and met my husband Dave. Two months after graduation, I was a third grade teacher in the South Bronx as part of the New York City Teaching Fellows. And here I am twenty years later...a third grade teacher! I’ve worked in public, charter and private schools in NYC and LA, where we currently live. Thankfully, my school schedule allows us to get back to the east coast for the summer so we can connect with family and friends. Our three kids think that 60 degrees is cold and that swimming outdoors all year is normal. Lucky them! Hope we see one another at an in-person reunion soon.\n\nCatherine Connolly\n\nAfter graduation, I earned my BS from Reed College, MS from NYU, and MBA from Simmons SOM. I am now the VP, Development at Newton-Wellesley Hospital, where I oversee fundraising efforts, community engagement and benefits, and the plans for an upcoming campaign. Previously, I was the Director of Development at Milton Academy, where I am proud to have managed the most ambitious campaign in the school’s history. Earlier, I was the CDO at Horizons for Homeless Children in Roxbury, MA and the DOD at the Sloan School of Management, MIT. When at Winsor, I lived in Jamaica Plain, and I still do! My husband, Sander Cohan, and I have lived there together since 2004. We welcomed son Peter in 2010 and\n\nFirst row (L-R): C. Connolly, R.Bobruff, M. Mohiuddin, K. Chisholm, D. McHenry, A.

Most recently, our sheepadoodle Popper joined the gang just in time for pandemic therapy in March 2020. We also enjoy our home in the Berkshire woods.\n\nAbigail Day\n\nTo sum up 25 years in a paragraph... After college, I moved to Chicago where I started my career working for an MEP firm as an HVAC engineer and project manager. I worked in a variety of buildings in the Chicago area including the Sears(Willis) Tower. I left Chicago in 2008, drove across the country for 2 months touring baseball stadiums, national landmarks and returning to Massachusetts in time to help my sister Caroline ’92 plan her wedding. I started a new job in Boston (same type of firm) right before the 2008-2009 collapse. I learned a lot at that firm about what to do and what not to do in a company. I quit that job in early 2019 to figure out what I want to be when I grow up. I fell into my current job at Vantage Technology through my network. It’s been an amazing ride over the last 18 months starting a new job, being promoted to Design & Engineering Business Leader and a pandemic. I’m looking forward to a summer of seeing family, friends and being outside.\n\nSarah Flier\n\nI majored in Biology and Philosophy at Brandeis and met my now husband on the first day of my 4 years on the varsity fencing team. After college, I moved to NYC for medical school and then residency at Mount Sinai. I returned to my roots for GI training\n\nat BIDMC and have been on faculty since graduating in 2010. Today, I clinically focus on patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and direct both Quality Improvement and the GI Fellowship Training Program for my Division. I also have multiple teaching roles at Harvard Medical School including co-director of one of the pre-clinical GI courses. I am certainly never bored but often sleep deprived! My most rewarding endeavor, however, is being mom to Penelope (9) and Linus (5.5). Even on the most exhausting days, their warm hugs and keen observations about the world keep me grounded, happy and hopeful for the future.\n\nKatherine Flynn\n\nAfter attending Winsor, I graduated from Northfield Mount Hermon. I then earned a BA in Sociology from Stanford and an MA in Sociology from Duke, where I met my husband, Corey. I then worked in several industries (real estate, university administration). In 2013, I returned to school, this time for a law degree. I now work as a federal prosecutor. Corey and I live in South Carolina with our daughters Natalia (17) and Alexandra (14).\n\nJennifer Harding Fritz\n\nI have been living in Washington DC for the past 15 years with my family, where I work in residential real estate for Sotheby’s. My three children are 12, 9 and 6 now. We travel to Boston often to see family and friends. During Covid, it has been fun to do a virtual book group with my Winsor friends. I am in frequent touch with Meghan Cleary Hamilton, Sarah Boardman Pendergast, Molly D’Ambra (who I see often in DC), Erin Sousa Guden and Christina Morgan. Hope everyone is doing well and looking forward to connecting this spring.\n\nMeghan Cleary Hamilton\n\nI live in Dedham with my husband Peter and our three children, Henry (9.5), Gus (8), and Georgia (2.5). After graduating from Williams, I worked in investment banking before realizing that I really wanted to be back in a school community like Winsor. I have worked at Noble and Greenough School for the last 16 (!) years where I am Associate Director of College Counseling. I love helping kids and families, and I feel really lucky to be part of such a strong community. In my free time, I love cheering my kids on at their sporting events and spending time together as a family. I also connect with Winsor girls any chance I can—Jennifer Harding Fritz, Sarah Boardman Pendergast, Molly D’Ambra Michael, Christina Morgan Cahoon, and Erin Sousa Guden. Our text chain has gotten me through the Pandemic. Can’t wait to reconnect with everyone at Reunion!\n\nLydia Walsh Kogler\n\nTwenty-five years have flown by! I met my husband in business school and after graduation moved to Manhattan to work for American Express in product marketing. Jordan and I spent five wonderful years exploring the city, before moving back to Boston. We were able to work remotely for AMEX and wanted to be closer to my parents as we started our own family. We have three children (Jack 8, Caroline 7, & Liza 3) and we live in Belmont. I am currently home raising our kids and busy with PTA, coaching, and Town Meeting activities. It will be nice to see classmates via Zoom for our reunion, but I am eager for a time when we can all gather in person again safely.\n\nElizabeth Lewis\n\nI live in Washington, DC, with my husband, David Fahrenthold, and two daughters, Alexandra (9) and Stella (5). We have lived in DC (except for two years) since college, and it now feels like home, though we get to Boston often to see my parents. I recently joined Blackstone as a Managing Director of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance). Prior to that, I led external engagement on climate change and impact investing for the International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank Group. I have spent my career in sustainable and impact investing. I serve as a Harvard Alumni Association Committee Member; for several years I co-chaired the Harvard Schools Committee for our area - a big job that allowed me to connect with this city in new and rewarding ways. I also serve as a Trustee of the Nature Conservancy’s MD/DC Chapter, on the Winsor Corporation, and as Vice President of the Stella P. Holt Foundation. I hold an AB in Environmental Science and Public Policy from Harvard College and an MBA from Harvard Business School. I feel fortunate that my education (Winsor included!) prepared me so well for my work and for the world we live in. I continue to be grateful for the friendships, education and opportunities Winsor provided me and hope to see class-of-1996ers in person soon!\n\nAdrienne Penta Lissner\n\nWhile 25 years has passed, I have stayed close to Winsor, completing two terms on the Board of Trustees last year. In my professional life, over the past 13 years I have held various positions at Brown Brothers Harriman after leaving law firm life in 2008. My most rewarding role by far has been founding and managing the BBH Center for Women & Wealth for the purpose of supporting women as they create and manage wealth. The financial services industry has not always done a good job for women, but Winsor taught us that all women should have a seat at the table! Personally, I live in Charlestown with my ever-supportive husband Dan, 6-year-old daughter, 9-year-old son and our excessively friendly labradoodle puppy. I feel fortunate to remain close with several Winsor friends and look forward to connecting with others during this reunion year.\n\nJohanna Mendillo\n\nHi everyone and happy 25th! I live three traffic lights away from Winsor with my family. After Cornell, I came back to Boston and worked on Boston Harbor and the Harbor Islands for a few fun years. Then, I went to Harvard and got my Master’s in Education. I have been teaching middle school science at the John D. O’Bryant School of Mathematics and Science (one of the three Boston Exam Schools) for the last 16 years. I try to take everything wonderful about Winsor that I experienced, and the leadership qualities Winsor nurtured in me, into both my teaching and my advocacy at the faculty and district-wide level... particularly important this year! I still love the Red Sox, still love to travel, sing, and bake, still bike on Block Island every chance I get, and have enjoyed passing down BU Hockey fanaticism to my kids!\n\nMolly D’Ambra Michael\n\nAfter studying International Relations in college and moving to New York City in 2001, I was inspired by the September 11th attacks to go into counterterrorism as a federal government analyst. I’ve spent a lot of the past two decades between the federal government and the New York Police Department in this field. My most exciting adventure, however, has been having identical twin girls, Aliza and Zoey. I’ve been lucky enough to keep in touch with Winsor classmates. As the years go by, I feel increasingly thankful for the nurturing, challenging environment that we all shared on Pilgrim Road.\n\nAlexandra Pearlman Michel\n\nAfter MIT, I attended Stanford where I met my husband, Raphael. I started my career in San Diego at HP and since then have worked at startups in Product Management and Product Design. Raphael and I moved back to the SF Bay Area after we got married in 2006 and have been living in Palo Alto for over 13 years. We speak English and French at home with our daughter Sophie (12), and son Remy (9). And our goldendoodle, Koda! I fundraise and volunteer at the kids’ school and pre-pandemic, coached the kids’ softball & baseball teams. I developed a vegan protein bar throughout 2020 and launched the brand, Zuda Bar, this past winter while working fulltime at an enterprise SaaS company. It’s a fun challenge but I’ve been too busy. I look forward to slowing things down this year and also reconnecting with my Winsor classmates!\n\nArden O’Connor\n\nFirst, I hope that your families are safe and healthy. This past year has brought laughter (the purchase of a THIRD, crazy puppy), sadness (loss of my aunt to COVID), returns to childhood (quarantined with my parents for 10 mos) and gratitude for friends, family and a job that I love. After switching jobs three times in three years after business school, it’s a miracle that I still run O’Connor Professional Group ten years later (celebrating our anniversary this July). The work continues to be challenging, interesting, rewarding and my team has made me into a better leader. I’m moving into a new home this summer in preparation to have a child on my own, a decision I made in the last two years. It’s not the journey to parenthood I imagined—we didn’t discuss (frozen embryos and surrogates in my Catholic Sunday school), but I am very excited about it. I look forward to our reunion! Love, Arden\n\nChrissa Pagitsas\n\nSince graduating from Winsor, I’ve lived in and around the Washington, DC area with frequent travel abroad. While I landed in the energy and consulting fields serendipitously after college, they served as the foundation for my career in sustainable financing, energy efficiency and environmental, social, governance (ESG). Most recently I founded and led the Green Bond business and ESG strategy at Fannie Mae. Now I am writing a\n\nbook on Chief Sustainability Officers at global corporations and consulting independently on sustainability and ESG. At home, Lee and I have two boisterous boys, Cosmo and Felix, and have muddled through pandemic parenting as best we could! It’s been wonderful being in touch with Winsor friends over the last 25 years and I look forward to in-person reunions soon.\n\nAlyssa Chick Penwell\n\nAfter leaving Winsor in 1996 and graduating from Georgetown in 2000, I moved to England to pursue a master’s degree at Oxford. Although a one-year program, I am still in London 20 years later. While living in England, I married my husband (a native Californian), qualified as an English solicitor, and had two wonderful daughters - Emma (9 years) and Sophie (8 years). I continued to work after having the girls and am now Global Head of Funds-Legal for a Swiss-based asset management firm. Back in 1996, I never could have predicted that my life would go in this direction. To those lucky girls still at Winsor, my advice to you is actively seek opportunity, take risks, travel the world, and for God’s sake, listen to your parents—they are so much wiser than you give them credit for!\n\nKatherine Stone Sonnenborn\n\nHello class of 1996! I live in NYC with my husband Jonah, and our three children Stella (10), Tait (8) and Noah (5). After falling in love with art history at Winsor, I studied the subject at Dartmouth and the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, and went on to a career in museums and the visual arts. I am currently in my ninth year as co-director of Skowhegan School of Painting & Sculpture, a residency program for emerging visual artists from around the world.\n\nSusannah Barton Tobin\n\nA quarter-century sure sounds like a milestone! With the way time plays tricks on us, though (never more so than in the pandemic), it could have been yesterday that we left the courtyard as Winsor graduates. In one way or another, I’ve spent these last twenty-five years in education (first as student and now as teacher, administrator, advisor). I’ve thus grown only more appreciative of the superlative education we all received on Pilgrim Road and how much work went into providing it. And, as ever, I’m grateful beyond measure for the friendships that began in homeroom and persist to this day. So many alums in the Class of 1996 and others have helped make this challenging world better through their commitment to truth, science, and equality. I think often of Winsor’s worthy goal of educating competent, responsible, generous-minded young women and still work on living up to it.\n\nSasha Polonsky Tulgan\n\nAfter two decades of living outside of MA, I’ve finally returned to the Boston area and I can’t wait to take my kids to Head of the Charles (especially when social gatherings return in force). Ben (5) and Sid (3) are loving living five minutes away from their cousins and their aunt Rachel (Polonsky) Sundet ’99. I am enjoying working at Harvard Law School and eating a ton of Mamaleh’s cuisine. I look forward to reconnecting with classmates this spring—and before long, in person!\n\nZamile Vilakazi\n\nAfter 20+ years of living and working in New York City, I moved to the Boston area in 2019 with my husband and two daughters (currently 7 and 2). I returned to begin a new role as Head of Integrated Production at Arnold - a Boston based ad agency. My time in NY was (almost) everything I had hoped it would be when I settled there after college. I spent my junior year away from Spelman on exchange with BU in Madrid, and also at NYU. I fell in love with both cities, but decided a domestic life was the one for me. I’ve spent my entire career in advertising. My job as a broadcast producer allowed me to travel around the country and the world making ads for just about every type of product you can imagine, and also enabled me to get my SAG card. I’ve shot campaigns for giant brands as well as small non-profits, and have enjoyed (almost) every one. I am no longer at Arnold, but I’m so glad that the opportunity brought me back home. Still based in Boston, I’ve been Head of Production at an agency headquartered in Atlanta since September 2020. In the 25 years since I left Winsor, I’ve been able to keep in touch with some of you, and look forward to reconnecting with many more. Stay Healthy and well.\n\nMariama White-Hammond\n\nI went from Winsor to Stanford and back to Boston in 2001 to become the Executive Director of a youth social justice arts organization, Project HIP-HOP. In 2014, I left PHH to go to BU School of Theology and was ordained an elder in the AME Church in 2017. Now I pastor New Roots AME Church, a multiracial, multiclass, LGBTQ+ affirming congregation\n\nin Dorchester. Always the activist I have continued to be engaged on many justice issues with a heavy focus on ecological justice. I’ve been married to Turahn Dorsey since 2007. We have a consulting practice and are owners in a cooperative farm in NH. I love knitting, gardening, scuba diving, jam-making, canning and candle-making. I have finally accepted that I can’t make a 26 hour day and am working to lean into the beauty of sacred Sabbath.\n\nEmily Young Williams\n\nI’m happily living in Andover, Mass., with my husband, Nick, and our two children: Ben, 7, and Callie, 9. I’ve worked in the communications and advancement offices at Brooks School for the past 12 years. Hope all of our classmates are doing well!\n\nHilary Smyth Wirtz\n\nSo amazed that 25 years have passed—hello to classmates near and far! After college, I stayed in the Boston area and worked in and around the city in advancement first at Harvard and then at Milton Academy and Concord Academy. I married my husband Mike in 2004 and we have two children Charlie (9) and Frances (7) and a rescue pup, Hudson. Five years ago we moved to Tarrytown, NY and live on campus at Hackley School where Mike is Head of School. We stay connected to New England through my job working remotely for New England Conservatory of Music and spending time at our house on Cape Cod. And we remain firm Red Sox fans even in NY!\n\n1st Row (L-R) W. Wang, E. Garcia, A. Mitchell, S. Levitova, J. Smith, S. Gonzalez, L. Ferrara, L. Kokotailo, P. Stoddard, E. Lucas, L. 2nd Row (L-R) L.

Professionally I am pursuing a career focused on racial equity and systems change, including time at The Bridgespan Group, City of Chicago Mayor’s Office of Equity in Racial Justice, and the Harvard Kennedy School. If you are working in the social sector loosely defined, I’d love to connect! When not working, I spend my time running (on trails nearby Boston as much as I can) (some things don’t change!) and hosting loud, wine-filled dinner parties (at least pre-COVID).\n\nSarah Coleman\n\nI just finished my first year of Business School at Columbia University. This summer I will be heading to Chicago to intern with the Boston Consulting Group, specifically to focus on consumer packaged goods and food and beverages. Prior to business school, I was a multi-asset trader at JPMorgan in the Private Bank responsible for ultra high net worth client accounts and relationships. Out of undergrad I worked at Berkshire Capital, a boutique M&A advisory firm in NYC. I graduated from Columbia College in 2015 with a bachelor"
