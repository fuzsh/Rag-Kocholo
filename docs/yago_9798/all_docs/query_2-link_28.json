        "text": "Who better to share their views and memories of Crossroads than those who watched it night after night…\n\nNEW 2021: I can’t remember to what extent I appreciated the series in its early heyday but sometime in the last dozen years or so I realised how much I missed it. I had bought the episodes including the wedding / fire on VHS (gone) & later got a couple of series on DVD. It was only when their prices suddenly shot up that I stopped looking for them temporarily.\n\nTBH I don’t remember poor Ann George fluffing her lines or any wobbly sets I’ve heard mentioned. Who cares anyway!? All part of the fun even if true!\n\nAll I know is there was this kind of atmosphere about the show that’s hard to put into words. Unlike most other soaps I generally felt it didn’t go too far just to get ratings. I admit one aspect I enjoy is a taste of that exciting feeling you get when you go on holidays & stay in nice hotels or motels.\n\nI remember it had a brief Renaissance some years back. It’s a pity it was indeed all too brief & I believe they should have persevered with it. One thing we’ve got to do is try to find actors that will stick in the heart as much as the likes of the great Noele Gordon.\n\nAnyway, I must try to find more DVD series soon!\n\nNEW 2021: Crossroads is slated nowadays but back in the day it was on the lips of everybody. It was far better than EastEnders etc.\n\n–John Kidd\n\nI like Crossroads because its the only soap that seemed believable in its structure to me. You didn’t have people working and living all in the same place. People lived in lots of different areas, Castlewich, Merryfields and Heathbury etc. They travelled to work at Kings Oak or at the motel and didn’t all live in the same street. They didn’t all know each other’s neighbours and didn’t all get on or drink in the same pub or meet in all the same places. That’s the more realistic side to Crossroads, and that’s why I loved it.\n\nAs for wobbly sets, they didn’t treat the viewers like idiots by changing sets completely without explanation, which seems to happen more and more these days.\n\n– J Watkins\n\nI have so many happy memories of Crossroads. I watched from the start as a little girl of 6 and continued until 1988. I did watch the new versions but I’m afraid after they killed off Jill it could never be the same for me. Initially, it was the characters of Meg Jill and Sandy which I especially enjoyed. That remained the case over the 23yrs and I felt so sad when Roger Tonge died followed by the sacking of Noele Gordon.\n\n1981 was a sad year for the show. I sadly only met Noele once just before she left the show. I’ve been to her grave in Ross on Wye several times. I did write to her a number of times and have some personal replies. She was wonderful. Jane Rossington, I did meet a number of times outside the Central Studios in Bridge Street. I remember writing to her when Sorrel was about a year old and got a lovely letter back including a helped signature from Sorrel. I was fortunate because I met a good number of the cast in the same way and most were lovely to chat to. Ronnie Allen and Sue Lloyd were lovely when they got engaged and I handed them a card.\n\nSusan Hanson was another and I also met her when she appeared in a show in Glasgow. I’m so looking forward to watching episodes on DVD. I only have to hear the signature tune and I get a lovely feeling.\n\n– Sheila Clark\n\nI lived in Birmingham from 1970-1973 and I was an avid Crossroads fan, I never missed it. One early evening, around 6.30 pm, I was cutting through the underpass at Digbeth and walking towards me was Noele, deep in conversation with a man, who I just assumed was a producer or director of the programme.\n\nShe looked fabulous and was dressed in a beige trench coat with the collar turned up, earrings as always and her hair immaculate. I would have loved to have stopped to ask for her autograph but I respected her too much to intrude. She looked every bit the star.\n\n– Barbara Gregory\n\nIt is true of Crossroads that its history, like all histories, has a habit of being re-devised. Some critics who need pages to fill, write about ‘shaking sets’ ‘wooden sets’ as if sets are made from anything else and or dodgy acting.\n\nAsk any of em to name two scenes that the walls shook? and you get no answer. Ask them to name one scene? and again, no answer! All television shows in the 1960s were dodgy and as Crossroads ‘had’ to produce 5 episodes, it put its head above the parapet to be shot at and was. This history followed it. From the 1980s the standards of scripts and cast were extraordinary. I will avoid the ‘new’ 2001 versions which ironically, DO deserve the criticisms.\n\nI have evidence of hundreds of times Coronation Street featured sets shaking – Ivy Tilsley’s stairway shook from episode to episode – have these shaking sets been mentioned? The conspiracy theory followed the show since the 60s and manifested in many different ways!!\n\nThere were few ‘ordinary’ characters and many, many, extraordinary characters when written by Raymond Bowers – think a contemporary Oscar Wilde – that’s how he wrote – add Michala Crees, David Garfield, Arthur Schmidt and Alan Wiggins, lent their tremendous talents to its unique way of writing. Each writer for 12 months had 3/4 storylines. Each story would be solely written by one writer and the three storyline narratives would unfold in every episode. These writers could write today’s generation of writers, this one included, under the table.\n\nThe live feel of each episode; scene one to scene five and End Of Part One, would be recorded without stopping unless a mistake did occur and this made it more like a theatrical experience; it was exciting and rather like the Coronation Street’s live episode a few years ago – who was interested in the melodramatic and sub-standard plots? More likely it was that live element. Unlike today’s soaps, Crossroads did have rehearsals!\n\nAs soap history clearly tells us, if women are in charge as producers/executive producers or even worse, as writers, a soap will hit the buffers. All three attempts to cancel the programme were made when women were in charge! The public loved Crossroads all 15-18 million of them, remarkable considering it was a ‘tea time’ show – no programme before it or since had that much success for that length of time. I am proud to be have been part of its family and enjoy mightily seeing again episodes\n\n– Arnold.\n\nI played bingo with Noele in 1972 at the ATV Studios in Birmingham – I won – 25 pounds – Noele was very pleased for me and her and her mother Jocky had tea with me.\n\nA great lady.\n\n– Philip Wilkinson Blake\n\nJust been reading the 70s reminiscences on your web site and thought you might like to see a couple of old cuttings I found in a dusty old scrapbook of mine. I, too, remember the old Trethowan Twins and have similar memories of them. Luckily, I saw the episodes twice as our local TV area stopped Crossroads for about six months at the end of the 60s but it was still going everywhere else.\n\nIt then restarted up again about six months later so London, for a while, was 6 months behind the rest of the country so I watched two weeks episodes involving the Trethowans in the Isle of Man on holiday in Maytime 1970 and then watched it again at home six months later. Can’t remember how and when London caught up with the rest of the country again.\n\nI believe it was Jill who got caught up in the witches coven and my memory of an episode end was Peter Hope and another character (probably Paul as your reminiscence shows) crept into the church (or wherever it was) where the witchiness was going on and Peter Hope suddenly whispered “Jill” and the camera showed Jill in some kind of robe. Bit sketchy, but the memory does cheat at times.\n\nI, too, was hoping some of these episodes would be on the DVD – but do they still exist? Sad to see that 1966 is the earliest existing episode of Crossroads.\n\nAnyway, I ramble on. Heres the cuttings from my scrapbook. Hope you like them.\n\n– Best Wishes, Pete\n\nApril 1970 was the first time I saw Crossroads. I was only 11 at the time and I think what attracted me to it at first was that it was a serial. I loved cliff-hanger endings. My memories of Crossroads are as follows:\n\nTwo crooks had taken over the antique shop in the village and were holding Barry (?) and his father prisoner until a package arrived.\n\nGranny Fraser was staying at the motel and was causing all sorts of problems. And just when she was leaving and everyone was breathing a sigh of relief, she fell outside and had to be carried back in. Wendy Padbury (formerly Zoe in Doctor Who) was in it at that time.\n\nSandy was helping an American (played by David Healy) write a book or something like that. Tish met Ted Hope, but he had a rival for her affections when an old flame of hers, Roland Greville showed up. Paul Stevens (Paul Greenwood) became manager of the motel, but the staff rebelled because he was too strict. Sandra Gould (Diane Keen) became a waitress at the motel.\n\nGarda and Richard Trethowan (they were witches!) were very mysterious. I think they were staying with Miss Tatum. They kidnapped someone for a ritual (can’t remember who) but Paul came to the rescue. Kevin McArthur (Vincent Ball) was staying at the motel and got involved with the secretary (?), Miss Thomas (Patricia Maynard). But he owed money to some rather nasty people who were on his trail.\n\nJill, who ran a boutique at the time, met and married John Crane unaware that he was a bigamist. For some reason, I can still see the scene in my head when he first came into the boutique. She chatted to him for a few minutes, then went to get something. And he just looked around the shop. And then the credits rolled. Anyway, when she found out about him, he went on the run and she tried to commit suicide.\n\nVince Parker was going out with a new girl called Veronica (?). She was a glamorous blonde and everyone was talking about her. Then she was murdered. It was a great murder mystery – all the male characters were under suspicion, particularly Vince. It later transpired that Louise Borelli’s brother, Kenneth was the killer. I think he jumped out a window and killed himself.\n\n1970 was also the year that Stan Harvey met Jill. He was an electrician and came to do some wiring at the boutique. Those are some of my memories of the show in 1970. I was hoping some of those episodes would be on the DVD.\n\n1971; Stan marries Jill. Jill’s boutique goes bust. Diane Lawton marries postman, Vince Parker, who agrees to raise Nicky as his own. Sandy goes to work on Mrs Ashe’s farm. Mrs A, if I remember rightly, was like Mavis Hooper without the charisma. She has a daughter called Linda. Stan Stennett (later Sid Hooper) played a gunman who holds Tish and Mr Booth hostage. David Hunter arrives with unstable wife, Rosemary and son, Chris. As far as I can remember he was at loggerheads with Meg when he first arrived.\n\nMeg buys a share in a racehorse. I can’t remember what it was called but one episode with Meg coming back from the races saying it had come fourth in a four-horse race. Graham Rigby played a dodgy character called Charlie Forward in this story. David clashed with Mrs Ashe. I think he knocked down and killed her dog and she vowed revenge. One episode ended with her inviting young Chris into her house and the suggestion was that she was going to do him harm. But she didn’t. Len Harvey, Stan’s brother was reported to have been killed. But he later turned up at the Harveys. He was a bad egg, as they say, and I think he was on the run. He was played by Michael Craze, who played Ben in Doctor Who for a few years. And that was 1971.\n\n1972; Glamorous secretary, Anne Taylor was working for David Hunter. I think they had an affair. She’s in the 1974 episode on the DVD, by which time she had married Bob Powell.\n\nDavid and Rosemary were divorced that year. Sheila Harvey and Bernice Burrowes, who both worked in Vera’s salon, went on strike because of the new outfits they were forced to wear. Sandy was paralysed in a car accident – two episodes dealing with that storyline are on the DVD. What’s not on the DVD is Sheila Harvey’s attack on Liz Clarke in the motel reception for deserting Sandy in his hour of need. Vince Parker’s father, Harry returned, but Vince wasn’t happy to see him. Diane tried to act as a mediator.\n\nSandy spent most of the second half of 1972 in a rehabilitation centre. He was very bitter at not being able to walk. A fellow wheelchair-bound patient, Joe Shaw helped Sandy come to terms with his condition. Joe was played by David Garfield, who later wrote for the series. Cliff Leyton (Johnny Briggs) was an ex-con, who came to work at the motel and was trying to start a new life. However, as far as I can remember, some of his old friends had other ideas. Doug Randall (Richard Thorp) began seeing Vera Downend. He was a navy man. I’m sure a lot more happened that year, but that’s all I can remember.\n\nMy memories of Crossroads in 1973 are very hazy. So, I do apologise in advance. As far as I can remember the year started with Vince Parker being lured to a chalet by Irene Summers (Melissa Stribling) who promptly ripped her own dress and screamed. It was a great ending to a Friday evening episode. Anyway, Vince was accused of attempted rape. I think the woman bore a grudge against Vince’s father, George or something. I’m racking my brains trying to remember whether that was 1973 or 1974, but I think it was 1973.\n\nSheila Harvey gave birth. There is mention of her pregnancy on the Vol. 1 DVD as Stan and Jill discuss adopting her baby. She eventually married Roy Mollison, who, I think, was the baby’s father.\n\nRosemary Hunter’s cancer scare was also mentioned in that 1973 episode on the DVD, but I don’t remember how that storyline concluded.\n\nAlso on the DVD was a character called Sid Gilbert – he was a very shady character. Diane Parker’s son, Nicky was abducted by his father, Frank Adam (Jon Kelley, who wore a string vest in UFO) and brought to America.\n\nDavid Hunter’s secretary, Kathy Lamb was involved with a newcomer to the area, Vernon Crawford. As far as I can remember, he was like an absent-minded professor type of character. It was during that storyline that I heard my first Crossroads blooper – David entered the reception area and called the character, Mr Vernon instead of Mr Crawford.\n\nThere were two French characters (with ze false accent) in the series around this time – Henri and Isobel Zola. I remember Raymond Adamson (very French name) played Henri – I had seen him in other things.\n\nVera Downend’s nephew (?), Martin Bell came to stay with her on the canal boat. I think he worked as a barman at the motel eventually. Local postman, Don Rogers was about to marry Pat MacKenzie. That storyline ran in late August. I think they eventually got married.\n\nAnd that’s all I can remember about 1973. There’s a lot missing, but I hope it fills in some gaps.\n\n– Jimmy Keary\n\nI have a strange early memory of Crossroads, from about 1967 or 68. Stan gets a robot attendant in the garage (or someone dressing as a robot?) This ran a couple of nights, ending with a foam fight.\n\nI also remember Larry Grayson’s stay at the motel, and Meg nearly bursting out laughing at his camp complaining. For weeks afterwards, she would be seen answering the phone, saying “I’m sorry, Mr Grayson, I’m afraid we’re fully booked,” then breathing a sigh of relief, having put him off.\n\nHis next appearance was, of course, as a chauffeur at the wedding.\n\n(They both appeared together on Blankety-Blank, making each other laugh!) I can also remember a strange musical dream sequence from 1966? featuring (I think) Amy Turtle dancing through a forest.\n\n– Mark Angel\n\nThere was Nick Van Doren and his wife, Tessa. They were Dutch I believe and I’m not 100% sure but I think Nick was a manager at one time. I remember when Sue Nicholls left the series they actually had a short preview before that night’s episode to introduce Nadine Hanwell who would be playing the part from then on. I think they just showed her walking around a room while the narration was going on. A very old and sketchy memory was of a French woman and her accomplice trying to flee from justice – haven’t got a clue what the storyline was. I just remember her shouting “Come On” in a peculiar French accent. Why I remember that lord knows!\n\nThere was also a dodgy lad turned up that was causing a lot of trouble, I believe he was a relation of Miss Tatum. He caused some problems between Vince and Diane (Dunno How) and in one scene, after Vince finds out, he is with Miss Tatum in the Post Office, and the boy is hovering in the background. Miss Tatum places a slipper on the Post Office counter and deliberately turns away. Vince picks up the slipper and says “So it was you who split up me and Diane”, marches the boy out the back and you hear whacking noises. When Vince returns he places the slipper back on the counter and Miss Tatum says something along the lines of “How did that get there” and puts it back on her foot.\n\nTalking of Vince, I remember the accident caused by Meg in which Vince is knocked off his motorbike and blinded for a while. I remember watching Vince in the courtroom as Meg is sentenced to 6 months I believe. And of course, who could ever forget Vi Blundell????? Most other memories of mine have already been mentioned by other people so have just jotted down the different ones that I can remember.\n\n– James\n\nMy memory is not great but I’ll have a go at posting some of my very earliest memories for what they’re worth. I’m sure others can do better than me!\n\nI remember when Benny first came into the programme (1975) working on the farm for the Gaffer (Ed Lawton, Diane’s uncle). Around about the same time Diane taught Benny to read from which time onwards she became his beloved “Miss Diane”. I also remember Benny telling various people: “You learns a lot when you can read”!\n\nMuriel Baines, the wife of Jim Baines who worked in the garage developed agoraphobia and was terrified of leaving the house. Naturally, Jim was not the most sympathetic of men. This must be the mid-70s as well I would think. I remember one episode where she plucks up the courage to go out and gets as far as the top of the road then goes into a phone box and rings Jim because she is totally panic-stricken. Not a very thrilling storyline but it stuck in my mind!\n\nI’ve mentioned this one before. When Diane used to share the flat with Jane Smith (the Salvation Army girl who worked on reception at Crossroads) Diane mysteriously found her clothes hanging in her wardrobe all shredded up. Can’t remember how long it went on before the mystery was resolved – in a rather creepy ending to one episode Jane was seen sleep-walking with a pair of scissors in her hand, entering Di’s room and slashing her clothes! Again, not very thrilling I know but it’s funny what you remember from when you’re very young..\n\nI remember Jill’s various affairs, it seemed anyone coming to the house to do any work was bound to have a one-night stand with her at the very least! I seem to remember she slept with a TV repairman on one occasion. More memorably she had the affair with Anthony Mortimer her step-brother from which she became pregnant. I don’t remember this well but my brother remembers that Stan (Jill’s then-husband) went round to Anthony’s chalet to confront him.\n\nPerhaps the most memorable storyline was when David’s deranged ex-wife Rosemary came to the motel when she heard the news of his impending marriage to Barbara, I think it was in Meg’s office that she confronted him and pointed a gun at him. Her hand trembling (as well as her top lip!) she demanded: “Tell em you love me!” The ever suave and collected David replied calmly “I won’t because it’s not true” then Rosemary fired. Fortunately, David survived, suit slightly bloodied but stiff upper lip intact.\n\nThen there was Hugh Mortimer being kidnapped by international terrorists and dying of a heart attack, I was only 12 when that happened but even at that age (12) I thought the storyline ludicrous! Benny falling in love with Maureen who then decided to dump him for her childhood sweetheart Pat Grogan. Then on the day of the wedding, Maureen cycled over to tell Benny that the wedding was off but was tragically knocked off her bicycle and killed by a motorist. (cue Benny’s theme!)\n\nThis one is a bit mixed up in my head (must talk to my brother who will no doubt have total recall!) Circa 1978 (?) wild child Iris Scott (Glenda Brownlow’s cousin) had been given a job cleaning at the home of resident American psychiatrist (and close personal friend of Meg’s for reasons that never really became apparent) and she came across some tapes which she put on thinking they might be some new popular music combo. They turned out to be taped sessions of Lloyd and Rosemary Hunter in which Rosemary revealed that Chris Hunter was not David’s son (unbeknownst to David). I think she then pinched the tapes and started blackmailing Rosemary or Lloyd.\n\nI also remember when Ultra-camp Mr Booth rather unexpectedly got married to a young, glamorous motel employee (a receptionist I think) called Helen. I can’t remember if we got to see the wedding but we did get to see them go off on honeymoon at another hotel. I remember the excruciatingly embarrassing ending of the episode when they get into their honeymoon room and sit on the edge of the bed and Bernard slips off onto the floor declaring “Looks like I’ve fallen for you all over again!”\n\nAnother storyline which I remember well from circa 1979 – Arthur Brownlow’s terminal illness. Arthur had been told by Doctor Butterworth or whoever it was that he had some terminal illness. Naturally, Arthur took the news with a stiff upper lip and the country reconciled itself to losing this, er, well-loved character. Subsequently, it turned out that the medical records had been mixed up and Arthur was not dying – well not for another 4 years or so anyway!\n\nFinal memory.. Sandy’s relationship with his physiotherapist Lynn Baxter. I believe they were engaged although her parents didn’t approve of the relationship – “How will they be able to.. you know?” as Mrs Baxter put it. I think they eventually split up..\n\n– Daniel Landsberger\n\nThis is so wonderful to discover a place where I can dump my vital Motel Memories from the 70’s and early 80’s, such as: .. leading up to Meg’s departure – getting a taxi home every night from work to make the 5.20 start time in Scottish TV ..gasping as Maureen met her fate on her way to tell Benny it just wasn’t going to be ..that story with the vintage car that had all the money hidden in it and I can’t remember the name of the car but it was David Hunter’s uncle who owned it ..anyone remembers? ..\n\nAmy Turtle’s son who always sent a rose to her on her birthday and then in the year of Meg and Hugh’s wedding it didn’t arrive and she went loopy- shoplifting in a headscarf.. bless! .. the terrorists – that French bird off school television and Chris Hunter when they kidnapped Hugh etc.. And as for Volume 2 well.. I can hardly breathe! Meg and Hugh having a major row in the episode directly before their wedding. Amy walks in and Meg shouts at her – so she gets offended and storms out. (Why in the wedding party episode Meg is glad Amy came to the blessing.)\n\n– George\n\nSome of the things I remember: David Hunter getting shot by his ex-wife Rosemary, and her foil blouse! Doris Luke dancing in a Christmas episode! Shaking her ‘ass’ for all to see. Jill and Adams first wedding in 1983, less service more action in this wedding than Meg and Hugh’s. Speaking of which – who could forget Larry Grayson driving the Rolls Royce car.\n\nAlso how Kath Brownlow reacted when Arthur died. She had an argument with him just before he went out and of course, they never made up – as he was killed on the way home from the motel. She regretted it and was upset for a good while after. Her son and daughter couldn’t even make her come round.I also just liked to see Jill’s house, Chimneys – very cosy, where her affair with Anthony all started!\n\nI remember the early 1980s when Adam was romancing Kate on his boat. She sang the song a few times ‘More than In Love’ which Chris Hunter produced in his new business venture – a recording studio. It was supposed to be in the motel basement (Chris had previously wanted to turn that area into a nightclub. David Hunter pooh-poohed the idea.)\n\n– Lee Harrison\n\nMid-1970s Diane Parker is walking near some railings and its somewhere near water – could have been the Kings Oak canal [Fan club note: it is actually Oxford] – I cannot remember whom, but she is approached. Diane was about to commit suicide, but the person who finds her stops her from going through with it.\n\nAlso, I recall Diane having an argument in the reception area with Jim and Muriel Baines, during the course of this Di gives as good as she gets, until Jim gets the upper hand and Diane runs off towards the kitchen, where she stands behind the door in floods of tears.. roll credits!\n\nI recall so clearly that I wanted to watch the next episode to see what happened. My mum said to me, “Diane probably won’t be in the episode tonight!” My mum was right, we didn’t find out any more from Diane until a week later!\n\nI recall Amy Turtle making an omelette, I always seem to remember this because through the motel kitchen windows you could see the orange outside lights attached to the chalet walls. I think that this was brilliant detail really, I believe Crossroads was always ahead of its time and such detail is reflected in the thinking of those involved behind the scenes.\n\nI think it must have been a major insult to the set designers to be constantly told that their sets were rubbish and wobbled, and I can say that all the years I watched it, I never saw any of the main sets move! (1974+). It must hurt really when everyone worked so hard to produce the show and then the product is never given any credit at all, just always being insulted. Now then back to the memories (rant over!)..\n\nA blurred one I recall is of someone having a row on a doorstep, the next episode started from where that one had ended, my sister said: “she’s been standing on that doorstep all night!”\n\nThe scene was dark, it was night time (rare for Crossroads to be outside at night) but it was a winter episode, and Crossroads always kept with the time of year really well (other soaps you never knew if it was spring or winter, the only time you knew what month The Street was in was Christmas!)\n\nThis final memory I would really like to see again, so if anyone can pin-point the episode date! Jill Harvey comes home to the motel to stay with Meg after a long day in court. This was around the time she was going through her divorce from Stan, and the story-line was the custody battle over Sarah-Jane. Anyway, I remember the scene was a real cosy one. Meg makes all of Jill’s worries better by going off to make a nice cup of tea. This leaves Jill all alone in the sitting room, the fire was burning and the lights from Meg’s Christmas trees were glowing brightly. When we get a closer look at Jill the tears are rolling down her face, she breakdown.. in comes the dramatic closing theme!\n\n– Scott Curtis\n\nSome very sketchy memories of old.. Sheila Harvey lounging about eating raw tomatoes – she did that a lot. Diane’s hunky actor husband Frank Adam – he was previously in UFO (as was Sheila Harvey).\n\nWilf Harvey sitting at the kitchen table – he did that a lot. Tish and Meg exchanging “dah-lings” – they did that a lot. Vera Downend’s new hairdo – a major topic of discussion at the time (old do won). Adam Chance in eye-popping tight trousers, clearly outlining the reason why they were too tight.\n\nJane Smith in her Salvation Army outfit, complete with a tambourine. A non-speaking waitress called Evadne, who mouthed unheard lines so as not to be paid the “talking” rate. Brian Jarvis’s impossible-to-remove five o’clock shadow.\n\nLouise Borrelli, Meg’s evil Fairlawns nemesis. Faye Frigid Mansfield. Comatose Sandy’s moving finger. Jill’s frequent long-term absences where we pined for her return. Tina Webb, Bernard Booth’s young niece. Eventually ended up with Simon Whittaker who dumped older lover Carol Hewson for her.\n\nOccasional appearances of Sergeant Tidmarsh and Colin the milkman. Tish’s delinquent daughter, Lynn, played by Patsy Blower, the voice of Larry the Lamb.\n\nVera being attacked outside the motel, by someone who thought she was as easy as she looked. Some guy threatening suicide by jumping from a window ledge outside the motel, all of ten feet from the ground. Some woman ripping off her blouse and screaming “help, help, aargh, aargh” as a horrified Vince Parker realises he is being set up to look like a rapist.\n\n– Colin J Wilson\n\nMy earliest memories of Crossroads date from April 1970 when I was about 11. There was a storyline featuring the Allisons – Barry and his father – who had an antique shop. They were held hostage by a man and woman who were awaiting the arrival of a package. I remember an end-of-episode sequence where Vince Parker called to the shop and said that there was a parcel for them at the Post Office. He referred to it jokingly as a ‘bomb’. After he left, the woman came downstairs and said: “alright, Barry, let’s go and collect that bomb”. Cue music and end credits. Anyone else remember that storyline or sequence? I was hooked and watched the series from then on.\n\nDoes anyone remember the Crossroads whodunit in 1970? I don’t remember all the details but I think the victim’s name was Veronica. The storyline ran for a number of weeks with a number of regular characters – including Vince Parker, I think – being suspected of the crime. The culprit was eventually discovered to be an American called Kenneth Borelli whose sister Louise was connected with the Motel somehow. [She owned Fairlawns Hotel and later had shares in the motel – Fan club note]\n\nAnother storyline from 1970 – my favourite year in Crossroads – had something to do with the occult. I’m not sure if they were witches or devil worshippers but these two mysterious characters were brother and sister, Guarda and Richard Trethowan. I think the storyline concluded with, I think, the then Motel manager, Paul Stevens discovering what the Trethowans were up to and put an end to it. Don’t remember how. Incidentally, Paul Steven was played by Paul Greenwood, who later appeared in the BBC series, Rosie. I know such a storyline probably sounds ridiculous and far-fetched, but it kept me watching. They were the great days of Crossroads for me.\n\n– Jimmy Early\n\nI can remember watching Meg’s wedding in 1975, which I think was one of the last appearances of Amy Turtle.\n\nAlso, remember Benny’s fiancé Maureen being knocked over, can even remember the 70s disco music, preceding the accident! I also remember Meg in her bedroom, when she notices a pair of men’s shoes pepping out of her curtains, with a man in them – he turned out to be a silver-haired charmer, hung around the Motel for a short time, name escapes me [Phillip Warner-Blyth FC note], but it stuck in my mind, as it was a great cliff-hanger. This was before Meg married Hugh, so I was very young! Jim Baines winning the pools, lording it over Diane, who took so much before blowing her top, in the middle of the reception.\n\nJane Smith, Diane’s flatmate at the time, Diane caught Jane Smith sleepwalking and Jane had a pair of scissors in her hand and was ripping Di’s clothes! I found it quite spooky at the time. Also remember Jill going through her Valium addiction, the affair with her step-brother and a one night stand with a TV repairman, Jill we miss you! I also remember Josie Welch, a no good, “good-time girl”, who took great pleasure in teasing “Benny boy”, if I’m right in thinking. Later her sister Linda came into it and was murdered and poor Benny, was blamed for it for a while, which leads to a “Benny Is Innocent” campaign.\n\n– Greg Shanley\n\nMeg singing at Christmas 1979, corny maybe, but just brilliant! I loved Crossroads and Nolly and miss them both terribly still! Meg’s addressing the camera like that made you really feel as if she were singing to you, like you were there with them, not just looking on.\n\nI long for the old days of happy Christmas stories and I’d give anything to spend my Christmas Day in Meg’s Sitting Room at the Motel rather than putting up with all the misery of Queen Vic!!\n\n– Dezzah\n\nMy main memories are from the 1980s when a character called Cecil Beecher-Blount, played by Arthur Howard – brother of the film star Leslie Howard – arrived in Kings Oak. He didn’t have a fling with Mavis, but she made out they were to make Sid jealous.\n\nSid got jealous but Cecil was a conman. Even on her deathbed, he thought she was talking about Cecil until she put him straight and said she was talking about him.\n\n– Kenneth McGuinness\n\nI used to watch Crossroads with my Mum. I was born in 1962 so that’s where I fit into the timeline! I remember a bomb going off – not sure when it was, but it’s probably my earliest memory – That and the Italian Chef and his wife.\n\nAlso, remember Meg being slowly poisoned by a dodgy husband – I think we all knew it but she didn’t – it was quite creepy! Clearly recall Vince and Diane getting together… I remember Diane’s flat had a sloping wall with a zig-zag design or wallpaper on it – very groovy stuff. I used to like them as a couple and was horrified when they broke up.\n\nAnother memory is that as we lived in London it was always a treat when a friend or relative took a holiday in another ITV region as we were 6 months behind. It was good to get all the gossip on what was coming up.\n\nI also remember that when the Thames TV station finally caught up with the rest of the country there was a scene where Meg and Vera Downend were in Meg’s sitting room when Vera started to talk to the camera explaining to the viewer what had happened over the ‘missing’ months – Meg said to her ‘Hey, you can’t talk to *them*” – Very surreal moment!\n\n– Tony\n\nI don’t have complete memories, just little flashes. I was born in 1970 so remember stuff from the mid 70’s up. I recall Jill’s affair with her step-brother. I recall liking Sandy a great deal. I recall Benny’s fiancé. I was fascinated by the show and would soak up gossip on it in the papers. I remember the speculation about Meg’s exit with one paper having photo’s of the mock funeral.\n\nI also remember one episode where the announcer kindly informed us that one character was being played by a different actress due to the usual one being ill! I believe it was something to do with Iris Scott – her mother perhaps? I remember it being a posh lady anyway!\n\nDan Landsberger adds: The character you’re referring to was Sally banks, the wife of Oliver banks and the mother of Kevin (Glenda’s husband). Not only did she change actress, but she also changed character becoming much more sympathetic when Oliver started up an affair with Sharon Metcalfe.\n\n– David\n\nReg and Alison Cotterill: Reg Cotterill was a very god-fearing person [he was a bible bashing Christian] and Alison was his daughter and he had forbidden her to see men or anything. She had a scar and he said it had been given to her as a punishment or something, And I remember she grew her hair very long because she was obviously very self-conscious of it.\n\nAnd in one episode someone said “You should push your hair up a bit” and they pushed it up and saw the scar and that how this particular episode ended because she was horrified and the other person was horrified. And Benny offered all his money to her to get an operation and I can’t remember if she had it in the end. And she had an affair with Chris Hunter and she said to Reg: “I love him more than any other man” and you saw Reg looking very hurt by that. Chris got her pregnant, and she left to become a nun.\n\nBenny and Maureen: They were going to get married and then she met up with her boyhood sweetheart Pat Grogan and decided to marry him instead.. He caught them smooching one day and Seamus Flynn (Maureen’s dad) he was deliberately winding Benny up he said “Oh they used to really fancy each other and it would be nice if they got married one day” and Benny looked very upset. And on the day of the wedding she was kissing Pat Grogan and he said:” Go and tell Benny that the wedding’s off” and of course that’s when she died on her bicycle on her way to tell him and Benny never found out.\n\nThe Shooting of David Hunter: I just remember that he was shot by his wife Rosemary who was a bit deranged. She cornered him in his office and pointed the gun at him and said: “Tell me you love me” and he remained very calm and replied, “I won’t because it’s not true!”\n\nBenny is Innocent: Benny was framed for the murder of Linda Welch who worked in the garage. He found her on the floor and Colin Dutton [the garage boss who had been having an affair with her and was the real murderer] walked in and going Benny standing over the body and said: “Benny what have you done?” He didn’t actually mean to kill her they had a fight and of course, that was another mistake because we spotted blood on her teeth before he actually hit her! Max Lorimer: Another good character I remember from the time was Max Lorimer who was a complete sleaze bag and used to sleep with anyone he could.. Vera Downend and Sharon Metcalfe, I think.\n\nThe Life and Loves of Diane Hunter: [Chris Hunter had been left money on condition that he got married and he proposed to Diane as a marriage of convenience] I don’t think we heard him propose on screen but we suddenly saw the door open and she ran out and she was looking horrified and I don’t know if we knew what it was about. And he came running after her and she said: “You just asked me to marry you!” And then years later she was being counselled by Chris she was about to marry someone else.\n\nShe was about to marry her lawyer because he was going to help her get her son back and Chris, as is often the way with soaps completely changed character, he’d become all-wise, and she said to him: “I don’t love him but he’s going to help me get my son back” and Chris said: “Have you ever married anyone for love?” because this was the second time she’d done the same thing! Then earlier there was the policeman Steve Cater. What happened there was that she came into her flat (I think it was her flat) and this bloke suddenly came up behind her and grabbed her and put his hand over her mouth and she was terrified – he thought she was a criminal but he’d got the wrong person. He realized after a few minutes that he had the wrong person and, of course, it was love at first sight!\n\nJill and Anthony Mortimer: That was classic! It started when Stan was away on one of his many trips and I think Anthony was coming round just to keep her company and they kissed and then they slept together. And the next day it started with her alone crying hysterically about it. And then they tried to put it behind them and eventually, of course, she was pregnant and Stan who didn’t know she was pregnant bumped into Dr Butterworth, they were organizing a house-warming party and they’d invited Doctor Butterworth and he got hold of the wrong end of the stick and he assumed it was a party to celebrate her being pregnant!\n\nSo he bumped into Stan in the village and he said: “Have you thought of a name for it?” and Stan looked at him blankly, and Dr Butterworth said “Well, for the baby!” and I think that was how the episode ended. And this was on the day of the party so Stan went back to Chimneys where Jill was getting ready and he said “I bumped into Dr Butterworth in the village” and Jill said, “That must have been a nice surprise!” And he looked at her and said: “Yes, Dr Butterworth is full of nice surprises!” and he looked horrified, I’m not sure if she knew what he meant!\n\nJill refused to talk about the baby and he was going on and on about it and then eventually (another very corny line!) Stan said to her: “Anyone would think it wasn`t my baby!” and she suddenly burst into tears and Stan’s lip started quivering and that’s when the penny dropped! And then he was badgering her for the next few weeks about who the father was and he kept being sarcastic pointing to everyone like the milkman and saying “Was it him?”! And eventually, he wore her down and she blurted out “Anthony! Anthony Mortimer!” and he looked horrified.\n\nAnd then the next scene was because he had been confiding in Anthony, telling her that she was pregnant but wouldn’t tell him whose it was and Anthony was a bit.. didn’t know what to say because he knew it was his. And then the next episode ended with Stan, he knocked on Anthony’s door and Anthony looked up and said: “Oh hello Stan, come in!” and Stan went in and slammed the door behind him and that was how the episode ended. And the next episode began it showed Meg at the reception area and Stan came out with his shirt all ripped and bruised all over his face and Meg went in to see what had happened to Anthony and he was covered in blood and that was how they all found out. After that Stan and Jill tried to make another go of it but it didn’t work and then Stan went off to Germany with Sarah Jane.\n\nIris and The Brownlows. I remember when Iris first came into the programme, she was Kath’s niece and she came to stay with the Brownlows and she was a bit of a trouble maker. Ron was very against her like they all were because she just didn’t make any effort and Kath said: “Leave her alone she’s just shy!” And Ron was saying: “No she’s not, she just can’t be bothered!” and as I say she was a bit of a trouble-maker and she fancied Kevin (like all the women did for some reason!) and she made a pass at him one night when it was thundering and lightening and they were alone together and she pretended to be scared and she was holding on to him and she made a pass at him and the went to bed together. And eventually, she deliberately let slip to Glenda and they nearly split up over it. Then later Iris started with Ron and she had a phantom pregnancy!\n\nAnother time Iris stitched Arthur up for indecent assault and it went to court and she eventually gave herself away. It originally began with Iris inviting Arthur into one of the chalets at the motel, because he had been perpetually slagging her off, and she managed to lock the door behind them and she slipped the key into his pocket.. she got him in there under the pretext that she was organizing a birthday surprise for Kath. Once Arthur was in there she pretended Arthur had touched her and she called the police and they arrested him when they found the key on him and as I say it went to court and she only gave herself away at the last minute. Kath went to visit Iris in prison.. she went to court during the trial and Arthur obviously just didn’t want to know and when she came back she told Arthur that she’d been sent to prison and Arthur was horrified because not even he expected her to go to prison.\n\nAnd then Arthur actually went it visit her in prison, she went out expecting it to be Kath and when she saw him she didn’t want to talk to him but eventually she did. I think he just wanted to make the peace for Kath’s sake. And of course, eventually, she became like Mother Teresa! I think this happened sometime in the late 70s. A guest checked out of the Motel, and when they presented him with his phone bill, it showed he had been calling a foreign country. I can’t remember if he was foreign, and it was his home country, but he denied making the call/calls and refused to pay the bill. It caused a bit of a rumpus with the management, and it was eventually concluded when another member of staff recalled that the cleaning lady was from that country, or had a relative in that country. When they confronted her, she confessed.\n\nThis happened in 1981. There were two yobs. Presumably, they were out to rob Peachey, or whatever the place was. I vividly remember them manhandling Doris (rather them than me), and she screamed out something like: “There’s a farmhand here who’s bigger than both of you put together. He’ll be back in a minute”. This is where my memory gets jumbled up. I remember the yobs were in their getaway car, and they ran Benny down as they left, temporarily blinding him, but this might have been on a future occasion, as the men may have come back. I also remember a few days/weeks later, when Doris was home alone, there was a knock at the door. It was one of the men. She screamed and tried to keep him out but he persuaded her to let him in. His name was Len Morton. He was the good guy of the two baddies, and he wanted to apologise. Benny meanwhile was lying in bed with bandages covering his eyes. I don’t know if he was on the farm though or where he was. Doris agreed to let Len help out as penance.\n\nHe started calling on Benny to see how he was (Benny didn’t know he was one of the yobs at this stage and Doris didn’t tell him). I remember him finding out but I can’t remember how. The next occasion Len visited after this, Benny pretended to be all nice to him. He asked Len to tuck him in, and as Len bent over the bed, Benny grabbed him and twisted his arm really hard. Len was screaming, and Benny shouted something along the lines of “It’s your fault this happened to me”. I can’t remember what happened after this. Maybe Doris turned up and broke them up. That’s all I recall. I don’t know how the storyline ended, but I think Benny forgave Len. The storyline ran for quite a while I believe.\n\nBernard Booth had a rather expensive pen nicked and he accused various members of staff. Then eventually his wife Helen admitted that she had taken it herself.\n\n– Paul Landsberger\n\nI loved Tish’s house burning down. The scene in the little bit at the end of flames lapping round a photograph of Tish and Ted was SO dramatic; Then there was anything to do with Vera and her narrowboat. I loved Vera!\n\nIn the 1980s, I thoroughly enjoyed the David getting shot by Rosemary story (poor David! But it did seem exciting!) and the lovely story with the little Downs Syndrome girl and Sharon in 1983.\n\nI liked the later yuppie era stories, too. My favourite was Amy Turtle turning up as a friend of Bomber’s and her effect on Jill! I always remember the girl with a secret (Alison Cotterill) and her grim Uncle Reg. Then, the secret was revealed, the scar/birthmark on her cheek. Then she had plastic surgery and got tangled up with Chris Hunter.\n\nThen there was that strange episode at Christmas 1980. I never quite understood it, but there is what I believe to be an old wives’ tale which states that if a woman hurts a particular part of her body during pregnancy, a birthmark will result in that area on her child.\n\nWell, at Christmas 80, we saw Reg slap Alison’s mother’s face and her clutching the cheek where her daughter’s disfigurement appeared in a flashback sequence. Did this mean that Reg had caused Alison’s disfigurement, by striking her mother? I was confused. Even more so, because the actress playing Alison was also playing her mother. The Cotterill’s were my worst ever Crossroads storyline, no contest.\n\n– “Mr Paul”\n\nI can recall rushing home from school to watch Crossroads. If my memory serves me correctly then I’d be right in saying that the programme was shown at odd times in the afternoon. I vividly recollect the Jarvis family but most of all I was enchanted by Marylin Gates’ broad Brummie accent. Her tittle-tattle in the kitchen made avid viewing. Marylin, played by Sue Nicholls (now Audrey in Corrie), was a sort of pin-up of mine. I even spent a fortune of 4s 3d for her record when she left the programme to pursue a music career.\n\nThe programme’s first chef was, Carlos Raphael. He was married to some lady called ‘Ozopheena. Well, that’s what Carlos called her even though TV Times had her cast listed as Josephina. My infatuation with the Crossroads’ chefs continued through the years with the sturdy succession of Mr (Gerald) Lovejoy, Shughie McFee and Mr (Bernard) Booth. The latter of which married a rather tasty lady who was some years his junior.\n\nThen there were the Motel gossips. Namely, Tish Hope, Amy (Ooh, I’ve forgot me lines) Turtle and latterly a Mrs Witton. The list is endless. The programme, between 1964 and 1979 was absolutely brilliant. The characters were believable, the reception didn’t resemble a “tart’s boudoir” and the bedrooms were for sleeping in.\n\n– Artie Fischal\n\nI remember during the Nicola Freeman/Austin Maestro era everyone always seemed to be having lunch or breakfast on windswept terraces pretending it was summer!\n\nAnd when Jill and Adam came running into reception after having a jog in matching tracksuits! What did ever happen to that leisure centre? After all didn’t Jill finance it with a million pounds? Where did she get the money from? Was it from the Arab businessman she was going to run off with?\n\n– Chris Lang\n\nMy earliest memory of Crossroads is Diane in a park with her son? Who disappears (cue end credits) then the final scene is her seeing a car drawing away and her screaming his name. Hope I got that right. The 36-year-old mind plays tricks.\n\nAlso, I came across an ATV site which had an article from the early seventies about the show being a big foreign seller. This raises the question if this is true has anybody thought of contacting these countries to ask them if they have anything knocking around in their archives (I quote the success of recovered Dr Who episodes as an example). [ITV Archive/YTV/Granada International have all apparently done some searching for Crossroads abroad, so far it seems to have been fruitless.]\n\n– Noel McCarthy\n\n1) Early 1970s: Jill and Stan have not long met, and are arguing. Stan looks as though he is about to hit Jill. Jill says, ‘That’s right – show me the REAL Stan Harvey!’ Suddenly, they are kissing passionately. End of episode.\n\n2) Early 1970s: Nicky, Diane’s son, is missing. Di is frantic. She searches for some waste ground. The programme ends with a view of a dumped fridge. Has Nicky wondered inside and suffocated? Later, we discover that he has been kidnapped by Frank Adam, his film star father.\n\n3) Mid 1970s: Meg takes command when there is a bomb scare at the motel. The staff and guests are evacuated. One female guest is frantic – she can’t find her little dog. The episode ends, and in the little scene after the closing credits, we see the dog, its leash wrapped around the grandfather clock outside Meg’s sitting room, as the minutes tick away… Later, we discover that the bomb scare was a hoax.\n\n4) Mid 1970s. Stephanie De Sykes chats to Sandy in the office. Suddenly, she bursts into ‘Born With A Smile On My Face’ – with full musical backing. Where were the band, we wondered – in the filing cabinet?!\n\n5) c. 1977. Vera and Diane chat on the boat when suddenly it springs a leak and water gushes out of a hole in the floor. End of episode!\n\n6) c.late 1970s. An elderly, slightly odd-ball King’s Oak lady believes she is to die on a certain day at a certain time. She gives all her worldly goods away and throws a party. But she doesn’t die!\n\n7) 1980: Kate Robbins, who played singer Kate Loring, told Des O’Connor about an amusing incident. In one scene, Kate was talking to Adam Chance in reception. The script called for Kath to be hovering in the background. The noise was awful, and Kate and Tony were forced to shout their intimate conversation at each other, until one of the crew dashed up to the director: ‘Sorry, Mike, the script SHOULD read ‘Kath Brownlow hovers in the background, NOT hoovers!’\n\n8) 1980: Meg throws a party in reception, whilst David is confronted by his deranged ex-wife, Rosemary, in the office. With mascara everywhere, she tearfully pulls out a gun and demands: ‘David.. say you love me.. say it..’ He refuses, and she shoots him.\n\n– Andrew\n\nI feel I grew up with Crossroads and remember some of the highlights, when Carlos was killed in the kitchen fire for example, or when Stan caused the fire in a chalet which destroyed a priceless painting of Hugh Mortimer’s, putting Stan out of the electricians business paying the insurance.\n\nIn 1981, I received a call from Central TV. I was running an office furniture company at the time and they were looking to refurbish part of the motel. I sold them a desk, chair and a cocktail cabinet, which went on to become David Hunter’s furniture. I recall our drivers returning from “Kings Oak” bragging that they had been in Miss Diane’s flat.\n\nI also recall when the exteriors used was that of the Penns Hall Hotel in Sutton Coldfield, which some years later caused a flurry of excitement, when the company I was working for at that time (Tandy) held a big convention there for its customers. Yes, it was badly acted at times and the sets were maybe (?) wobbly, but wasn’t that part of the fun, alongside the fact that whenever someone mentioned making some coffee, it was a code meaning I’ve forgotten my lines help me out.. I only watched a couple of episodes of its recreation and was amazed when they killed off Jill.\n\nI’m afraid the modern themes, just didn’t work. A few “daft” stereotypes like Amy or Vera to push things along were definitely needed. Never mind.\n\n– Keith Povall\n\nI loved that time in the mid-70’s when Meg was told to expect the arrival of “Harriet” at the motel. When Harriet Blair turned up as a guest and turned out to be a pop-star in hiding (known as Holly Brown), the mystery deepened.\n\nThen Sandy sussed her out and prompted her into bursting into song with ‘Born with A Smile On My Face’ with full musical-backing (??!) in her humble chalet. At the same time – Meg found out that the “Harriet” that SHE was expecting was in fact a vintage car, which she drove around in for the next few episodes to the tune of Stephanie De Sykes and ‘Born With..’\n\nCan’t remember who sent the car – I think Timmothy Hunter won it in a dodgy gambling game, it was supposed to have money in the boot or such, so long ago I can’t recall the finer detail… Anyway, it gave them another song in the pop-charts!\n\n– Steve Graham\n\nI hardly ever knew Meg as Meg Richardson, more as Meg Mortimer, seeing how I was only 5 when she and Hugh Mortimer married. I remember the wedding reception still from the first time it was aired, I really think that episode is quite unique!\n\nMy favourite character is Jill Chance, and Jane Rossington is probably my favourite of all actors. I think that Jill was probably my favourite character because she was one of the offspring of Meg. She could be independent but always had a disaster about to happen. Young and vulnerable: she inspired me, Jill was a born survivor, and seeing how Jane survived for 24 years, I suppose that Jane is a born survivor too!\n\nI felt passion with Jane’s portrayal of her character, it was consistent, and well throughout my growing up years she was there, with all her problems, and my heart went out to her character. I always thought that she was held back from coming into her own. Later, towards the end of the series, and after the departure of motel manager Nicola Freeman,\n\nJill kind of change to fill that gap. If you look at Jill’s clothes in 1987 she is starting to power- dress! Obviously, Jill started to wear the same kind of clothes as Nicola had done.\n\n– Scott Curtis\n\nMany people tend to overlook the central moral message that the serial tried to convey: That message was one of tolerance and acceptance of human frailties and foibles. Fortunately for all of us, this moral thrust was delivered by way of the sublime scripts that were interpreted by a truly stellar cast. The Christmas 1979 episode is especially an embodiment of the unique Crossroads DNA.\n\nAll in all, a tremendously emotional evocation of a simpler, cynicism-free era.\n\n– Gutsbrau\n\nMy first ever memory of Crossroads is of Sandy Richardson in his hospital bed. Scenes were transmitted in 1972 but I couldn’t tell you what year that was because of my region Granada’s policy keeping us one year behind in episodes. The only thing I can remember is that the episode went out at 1.30 p.m.\n\nFrom 1975/76 (Over many episodes) :\n\nHugh had been getting a couple of phone calls which he wouldn’t take in front of David in the sitting room, he took them in the office. One day Hugh left his reading glasses behind when he was due to fly somewhere. Jill went after him with the glasses, but instead of boarding the plane, he walked off with a woman. Camera close up on Jill’s face showed a puzzled expression, then Closing Credits.\n\nJill followed Hugh around for a bit and noticed he was being followed by a Private Investigator. Eventually, she tells Meg. Hugh’s explanation was that Anita Fielding is his solicitor, doing work for him. The PI is just the result of a jealous husband. Meg believes Hugh.\n\nHugh tells Meg that he has to fly out on Boxing Day. If there was any other way he would change his plans. Soon after Boxing Day Hugh has his first heart attack, and Meg is notified by a phone call from Anita that Hugh is in hospital, she was with him when it happened. Meg dashes to hospital.\n\nWhen Hugh is well enough to come home, Meg brings him to the Motel, not the cottage because she doesn’t know if she has a marriage. doesn’t want anybody to gossip. He walks around the sitting room a lot in his posh dressing gown.\n\nHugh asks Anita to visit him at the Motel. Meg is upset by Anita’s presence. Anita tells Meg that she is no threat to her marriage, never has been. Meg re-buffs Tish’s kind words when Tish offers sympathy. Meg is angry at Jill for telling Tish and David.\n\nTish takes Anita up to the bedroom where Hugh is waiting. Anita runs to Hugh, who is sitting in the chair. She kneels down, and he lovingly holds her hand. (This picture is in the Goodbye Meg book). The camera then goes off them to another story.\n\nHugh comes into the sitting room where Meg is. He tells her that the affair is over, he won’t be seeing Anita again. Meg & Hugh then kiss and make up.\n\n(I must thank Jeannine Hochet and her Crossroads diaries for the reminder of reading glasses because I couldn’t remember what Hugh left behind)\n\nFrom 1976 –\n\nHugh is plotting to get rid of David Hunter from the Motel. He sends inflammatory letters with Anthony’s name on them, making out they were from Anthony. Hugh did this deliberately to wind David up. I can’t remember the content of the letters, but it was something to do with turning the Cellar into a Disco at the Motel, which David didn’t want.\n\nAnthony Mortimer wasn’t interested in becoming Motel Manager and tells his Dad this many times. Hugh wanted the Motel to revert back to a “Family” Motel. After one such conversation, Hugh clutches his chest with pains (supposed to avoid stress after a second heart attack) and makes Anthony promise not to tell Meg.\n\nFrom 1977 (over a couple of months)-\n\nHugh Mortimer on taking a fancy to his secretary Vicky Lambert decides to move her into the Cottage with him and Meg. The first Meg finds out about it is when Vicky thanks Meg for the offer. Meg isn’t happy one bit but doesn’t tell Vicky she didn’t know.\n\nI remember Meg coming home one night from the Motel to find Hugh already eating his dinner, which Vicky had made. Hugh told Meg to sit down and eat hers which Vicky had also made. Meg again wasn’t happy.\n\nMeg had to go away to London to a conference. Meg asked Hugh to go with her, he refused, said he was too busy with the book he is writing. She tells Vicky that she expects her to move out in her absence, that it wouldn’t be right whilst she wasn’t there. When Meg had left, Hugh tells Vicky he won’t allow her to move out. Vicky is worried and rings Sandy (she was also Sandy’s girlfriend) that she is worried about Hugh’s plans for the night. Sandy turns up and tells Hugh he is there to look after him whilst his Mum is away and he is staying the night. The look on Hugh’s face said it all !!\n\nMeg & Hugh had an almighty row in the Sitting Room, over a few things including Vicky. TVTimes billed it as “Meg & Hugh have a showdown”. It was the worst row I’ve seen them have. Both at one another, hammer & tongs. Seemed to last forever. Then they declared their love for one another, kissed & made up in time for the closing credits.\n\nI remember Hugh & Vicky ballroom dancing to the radio in the Cottage. Hugh went to kiss Vicky when at the crucial moment, he clutched his chest and collapsed with pains. He told Vicky to get his medication and made her swear not to tell Meg. (This scene looks like John Bentley’s final scenes before he was axed 1 year later).\n\nFrom 1978 –\n\nI remember after Hugh had died, Meg’s arrival at the Motel back from Australia. She came in through the French Windows, the back way because she didn’t want anybody to see her. I think her plane had arrived early I think and Jill was waiting for her at the airport unawares her Mum was already at the Motel. Meg was visibly upset, dressed in trousers and a casual jacket from travelling. She looked around the sitting room and started sobbing. I think she saw her wedding photo on the table and that upset her. Closing Credits then came.\n\nI also remember Meg going to the Cottage to escape the Motel, didn’t want anybody to talk to her. Tish & Sandy were upset she didn’t want to speak to them. She was having her breakdown. After the phone had been ringing constantly, Meg through her distress/anger/sobbing pulled the phone from its socket. A really powerful drama scene.\n\nOn Crossroads Archive Dvd 10, there is an episode where Meg is isolated at the Cottage, isn’t coping very well with Hugh’s death. Lloyd Munro is helping her out of her isolation. In the middle of the night, Meg comes downstairs, walks around the cottage, her hand strokes the back of the armchair that Hugh used to sit in. Then she suddenly stops walking, turns the light on, and says “Don’t worry I’ll be alright”, talking to Hugh’s spirit. The camera then shows Hugh’s photo and the credits go up.\n\nWhen I watched this episode in 1978, I was mesmerised. I found it all incredibly sad, but a bit scary at the same time. Sounds funny, but with the sad music playing as Meg walks around the cottage in the darkness, and then talking to Hugh’s spirit, it was really moving. We still had a b/w set at the time, so seemed to me really spooky.\n\nFrom 1980 –\n\nI remember Meg not being at David & Barbara Hunters wedding. She was in the USA on holiday visiting her Grandson Matthew (Jill’s son) whom she had not seen before. On route to Anthony’s I think she was on a cruise. All off-camera of course.\n\nOn her return to the Motel, there were signs that Meg had a holiday romance. She hadn’t been back long when a guy turns up at the Motel wanting to see Meg. Meg at first doesn’t want anything to do with him, says it was only a holiday romance, but slowly she comes friendly with him and goes out to dinner with him etc. Lloyd Munro starts to get a little jealous because Meg is his “special friend” not that there is any romance between Lloyd and Meg. I remember Lloyd asking Meg out to dinner, and she says she already has plans for the evening. I remember the guy (Philip Rogers) asking Meg to marry him. I remember Meg turning him down by saying she doesn’t love him.\n\n(Thanks again to Jeannine Hochet and her Crossroads diaries for the name of Philip Rogers)"
