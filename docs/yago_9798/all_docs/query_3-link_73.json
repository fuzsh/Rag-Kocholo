And it's before \"Put On By Cunning\" (1981) when Burden\n\nand Jenny seem to be married. Unfortunately my books list all the Wexford\n\nstories in alphabetic rather than chronological order, so I can't narrow it\n\ndown to one of the book written between those dates - unless you've got a\n\nchronological list.\n\nI think I remember the episode on TV - Burden met Jenny at a garden party\n\nwhile he and Wexford were solving a murder of someone (?) in a chemist's\n\nshop (?). Sorry, I can't remember any more details than that.\n\nI can also eliminate:\n\nFrom Doon To Death (1964) (far too early - Jean's probably still\n\nalive)\n\nMurder being Once Done (1972) (I don't think Burden even appears)\n\nWolf To The Slaughter (1967) (also too early)\n\nSome Lie And Some Die (1973) (Burden is considering marrying Grace,\n\nJean's sister)\n\nThe Veiled One (1988) (By now he's married to Jenny)\n\nA New Lease OF Death (1969)\n\nAn Unkindness Of Ravens (1985) (Jenny is expecting their first child)\n\nRoad Rage (1998) (Definitely too late!)\n\nSo what does that leave us with:"
