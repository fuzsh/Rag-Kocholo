        "text": "PERSONAL WRITING SERVICES\n\nMANUSCRIPT REVIEW\n\nI provide deep developmental editing and line editing for full novel and memoir manuscripts. I charge by the hour and not by the page because some projects need more attention than others. For example, for a book that needs help with structure, I usually need to read the book in full before making suggestions that affect the entire manuscript. For manuscripts that need minimal copyediting, I can usually work faster–and it just wouldn’t be right to charge you more.\n\nThough all projects are unique, the fee for an average 250-page manuscript usually works out to about $2,500. This fee includes developmental editing, an edit letter, and a one-hour follow-up call via Zoom to go over any questions you might have.\n\nBefore we begin work together, I offer a free 15-minute session via Zoom to discuss your book’s goals; I will also edit your manuscript’s first 5 pages for free. This will give you a chance to see how I edit, and it will help me see if I am the right editor for your book.\n\nIf we agreed to proceed, I will provide you with a written estimate for the number of hours I expect it will take me to edit your book. Half of that total will be due when you send your pages to me. I will check in with you along the way so there are no surprises, and about two weeks before completion, I will follow up with the remaining balance due. I have never charged a client more than my initial quote.\n\nCOACHING\n\nI provide coaching on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons. Our focus can be on craft, structuring a project and goal setting, reconsidering writer’s block, creativity building, revision, building a reading list, or all of the above as needed. Sessions are typically one hour long and can be biweekly or monthly. Diane can also provide expert help with agent query letters and developing strategies for submission.\n\nRate: $125/hour.\n\nAGENT QUERIES AND COMP TITLES\n\nThere is a deep education you acquire by reading lots of contemporary books similar to your own. Knowing the other books out there with similar themes, characters, and struggles will help you understand what books are in conversation with yours. You also naturally start to make connections: Who was the agent for this book? What publishing house championed it? What writers inspire this writer that I love? Who is my audience? Who understands the kind of story I am trying to tell?\n\nAnd yet, I know this is a process that takes time…right at the time when you are most eager to send out your work and move to the next stage! If you could use a partner, I can help you write your query letter, create a well-researched list of agents to contact, and find comparative titles for your work.\n\nComp titles are important for your agent query letter. That section of your letter shows how your book is similar to contemporary works that are already successful in the world and also how your book differs–how your book will be adding something new to the conversation.\n\nDepending on what you need, we can create just the right package for you, from query letter development, to comp title search, to the creation of an agent list.\n\nRate: $125/hour.\n\nAGENT AND COMP TITLE PACKAGE ($875): Includes a 1-hour Zoom discussion about your book and query letter development, a review of your sample pages, and the creation of a guiding logline. You will receive from me a list of at least 10 comp titles and the 3 that I believe will best serve you in your query. You will also receive a list of 20 agents and why I think they could be a good fit. Finding an agent is usually a long and involved process for everyone. I can’t guarantee that you will find your agent quickly, but I can help you create a sparkling query and a detailed plan for the journey ahead!\n\nReserve your time to meet here: www.calendly.com/dianezinna.\n\nTESTIMONIALS\n\nManuscript Editing\n\n“Diane’s skills as editor, coach, teacher, writer, and connector are without par. This breadth of experience gives her an unerring ability to hone in on those changes–big, subtle, or deceptively small–that will make a manuscript sing. An acclaimed writer herself of both fiction and non-fiction, Diane has a genuine, kind, pragmatic, and supportive style that makes the editing process far more joyful and positive than it deserves to be. More than anything, she is truly one of the most special people you will ever have the pleasure and privilege to know and work with.” – Natalie Jenner, Internationally Bestselling Author of The Jane Austen Society\n\n“I’m deeply fortunate to have had Diane Zinna review my novel in progress. In this capacity she has shared her expertise and mentorship in innumerable ways. There is way more than I could ever fit into a paragraph about her brilliance as a teacher. For now I’ll say that Zinna brings humor and whimsy to any subject she explores and that her grief writing practice is so successful because she infuses it with so much joy. She is also a terrific ally and excellent supporter of LGBTQ writers. I have witnessed her interacting with people of almost all ages, from 14 to 89, and all backgrounds, levels of education and various political beliefs, and she’s equally talented with every single individual. Diane is a versatile and gifted teacher. Every student who crosses her path will experience something profound, life-changing and uplifting. She has shaped and illuminated my own writing, teaching, and spiritual life, and for this I’ll be forever grateful.” – Jess deCourcy Hinds, Writer for Lit Hub, The New York Times, and public school librarian.\n\n“The feedback and depth of engagement Diane Zinna delivers in her manuscript critiques is heartfelt, honest, and profoundly helpful. Here is a reader with enough range and openness to greet each piece of writing on its own terms; here also is a working writer with the vision and craft knowledge to articulate how a manuscript can be strengthened, expanded, distilled, and improved. The edits Diane shares are always a call to action. Her feedback doesn’t merely offer corrections; it inspires and prompts fresh engagement with the page. Writers of all types will find her advice to hold enduring value. She is among the best writing advocates and teachers I’ve ever known.” –Lara Palmqvist, Fiction Writer\n\n“After I read her novel, I hired Diane for editorial work on my novel. Her eye for details, as well as her insight into storytelling were extremely helpful. I’ve been impressed by Diane since I met her years ago through the mentorship program that she developed in her role at AWP. Her innovation and leadership skills, as well as her gracious manner, make her an excellent teacher or program manager. I would happily recommend her as an editor, instructor, or program designer/manager.” –Eileen Cronin, author of Mermaid, writing instructor at UCLA Extension, and clinical psychologist\n\n“It isn’t every day that you meet someone who is so obviously living their purpose in life like Diane Zinna. It’s obvious she was born to be an eloquent and dynamic writer as well as an insightful and thoughtful editor. She’s a natural at both, and a truly warm and special person who is a delight to work with. Don’t hesitate to work with her if you have a chance. She will lovingly coax your inner writer forward and help you birth the genius that lies within each one of us. –Ana Maria McKessy, Author of The Girlfriend’s Guide to Surviving Narcissistic Abuse\n\n“I took an online writing class with Diane Zinna, and I was so impressed with her skill and intelligence that I asked her to work with me on my novel-in-progress. I am so glad I trusted that intuition. Diane is the best developmental editor I can imagine. She really got my book. Her suggestions ranged from detailed grammatical advice (remove about 1,000,000 unnecessary commas) to insightful suggestions about deepening plot and characters. My novel is immeasurably improved. She even charged me less than her estimate, because the work didn’t take as long as she projected! Diane has been very generous and encouraging about my next steps. I am going forward with query letters to agents with the hope of publishing. If you are ready for a new perspective on your work, I cannot recommend Diane Zinna enough.” –Charlotte Taft, Author of Without Permission\n\n“Diane Zinna is a wonder! We had one-on-one consultations about my book proposal and sample chapters for submission to book publishers. Throughout the process, Diane was compassionate and professional, inclusive and demanding, and she offered publishing resources that I never knew existed. She balanced just the right amount of praise with constructive criticism. I kept returning to the document she sent me as a resource while submitting proposals–and found just the right match with a publisher. Thank you, Diane!” –Ann E. Feldman, Ph.D., and Author of Building Communities of Trust: Creative Work for Social Change\n\n“Diane edited my novel, and I couldn’t have asked for a more qualified person to do the job. She was thorough, critical when necessary, and helped me reshape several sections. Moreover, she truly “got” my characters and my novel’s message about self-acceptance. With her assistance, I received many positive reviews on Amazon and Goodreads. I’ll definitely use her for my next manuscript!” – Naomi Rabinowitz, Author of F#@! BOMB\n\nGrief Writing Classes\n\n“Diane’s grief writing practice is so successful because she infuses it with so much joy. Her grief writing workshops were a godsend for our public high school students in New York City during the pandemic. My students lived in the “epicenter of the epicenter” of the virus in Queens, NY and many tragically lost family and friends. Zinna’s compassionate and clever workshops incorporated “hermit crab writing exercises” where writers borrowed common forms such as recipes, instruction manuals and lists to tease out the hidden poet in everyone, and tap into emotions in new and inventive ways. Students immediately opened up and trusted Zinna’s gentle presence and guidance. She invited each person to travel only as far as they wanted into their grief journey and didn’t push anyone to participate if they weren’t ready. Most students opened up nore than they ever dreamed they would with a perfect stranger because Zinna is just that kind of teacher. She made every student who shared feel like a total rock star. Her memory for the details in students’ work was exceptional, and she listened more skillfully than any teacher I’ve ever met. I call her a writing midwife.” –Jess deCourcy Hinds\n\n“Diane provided a grief writing class to our college peer mentors dealing with losses and added stressors related to COVID-19 in our community. I very much appreciated how she approached them, with an understanding of and appreciation for the work they do. Her honesty, warmth, and sensitivity around grief helped us work through potentially difficult emotions and offered tangible ways to continue this work on our own.” –Ellen Quish, Director of Student Success, LaGuardia Community College\n\n“Zap, I did not expect it, a profound change in my life. During a one-time workshop, two hours of writing about grief with Diane Zinna, I have discovered words. Continuing on, with Diane’s soft voice, clear guidance and encouragement, responding to weekly in-workshop writing prompts, I am propelled forward. My grief over losing my husband is slowly being healed, and I am renewed….” –Ruth Altheim, Writer\n\nMemoir in a Year and Novel in a Year Courses\n\n“Diane Zinna embodies the literary trifecta: she writes exquisite prose, edits with great thought, and conducts workshops in a constructive manner. Although I had previously completed an MFA program, I had not encountered a mentor like Diane. Her attention to craft and her encouraging demeanor were invaluable to my journey towards completing my first novel manuscript. I am forever indebted to this shining star.” –Wendy Besel Hahn, Novel in a Year Participant and author of Tante Clara\n\n“When I signed up for Diane Zinna’s Book in a Year Class, I didn’t really expect to have a complete first draft of my second novel in eleven months. After all, my first one took four years to reach that milestone. Yet here I am with eighty-six thousand words, two compelling protagonists, and a strong story arc. I attribute it to three things. First, Diane is an incredibly supportive guide. I know I speak for all in our group when I say she made us each feel safe taking risks and sharing our doubts along the way. Second, she has a deep knowledge of the craft of writing and conveyed that so effectively by pulling examples from our work and outside sources. Finally, Diane created a sense of urgency by keeping us to a production schedule and stressing the vital importance of bringing healing art into the world. I highly recommend her class to anyone who wants to work hard and would benefit from skilled guidance, and an organized structure.” –Michael Freed-Thall, Book in a Year Novelist and author of Horodno Burning\n\n“After decades of trying to write a book on my own, Diane’s Book in a Year class helped make my dream a reality. I now have a finished first draft! I couldn’t have done it without Diane’s mentorship. Her class was the perfect blend of workshop and writing craft lessons that got me to the finish line. Diane is magical in her keen insights, her support, and her ability to give a nudge or ask just the right question at just the right moment through the ups and downs of writing a first draft. I can’t say enough about how instrumental she and her class have been in getting me to this point!” –Fenny Lin, Book in a Year Memoirist\n\n“I credit Diane completely with spurring me on and highlighting budding gems…that made me feel like I could accomplish this huge task…I feel like she is an empathetic and magical motivator, gifted teacher, and writer!” –Betsy Thomassen, Memoir Writer and “Book in a Year” Participant\n\n“I believe that my experience with Diane as a teacher and supporter has been an open door for me at this place in my life. Instead of being afraid to try something that I wish I had tried way earlier in my life, she has made me feel welcome and whole in this space. What could make it better would be if I could just come live in her house and have this kind of loving and professional support all the time. Short of that, I’ll be back to her classes again and again if she’ll have me. She hears things that I couldn’t have heard and sees things I never saw. She shows me the art of being an artist and the possibility that is there for all of us. There is never, it occurs to me, a sense of judging or comparing or preferring one voice over another. Just finding and helping us find and express our own truths.” – Teri Hinton, Memoir in a Year Participant\n\nMagic Writing Circles and the February Publishing Circle\n\n“Diane has built a vibrant and inclusive community of writers who are deeply interested in their craft, and her February Publishing Circle is the most thorough introduction to publishing and sending out work I’ve ever taken.” –Travis Eisenbise, Fiction Writer\n\n“Taking Diane Zinna’s creative writing class was one of the best decisions I have ever made in terms of my creative writing process. Her class helped me dig deeper into my writing and transform single-paragraph ideas into actual stories. Diane’s guidance as a mentor and teacher has helped me develop a greater confidence in my writing capabilities, something which I have carried with me long after the class ended. To this day, I know if I ever need another pair of eyes to review my writing, Diane will be there to assist me and offer constructive feedback. She is a teacher in every sense of the word, and her instruction doesn’t end just because the class does. I highly recommend Diane to anyone looking to improve their creative writing skills and looking to tell a compelling story.” –Taylor Girardi, Professional Writer"
