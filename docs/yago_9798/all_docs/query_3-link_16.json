She had another iconic comedy role in \"Rings on Their Fingers\" alongside Martin Jarvis and continued making numerous TV guest appearances. In the 1980s she starred in \"You Must Be the Husband\" and the dramatic mini-series \"September Song.\" Keen was also a fixture on the \"Ruth Rendell Mysteries,\" where she appeared throughout the '90s before landing a career-defining role on the soap \"Doctors\" as Hospital administrator Julia Parsons. She is also known to audiences as the spokesperson for Nescaf√© in a series of ads."
