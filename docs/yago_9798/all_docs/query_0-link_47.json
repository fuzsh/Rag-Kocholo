        "text": "Bonnie Lou Davis was born in Independence, Missouri, on September 21, 1934, to Mary Elizabeth and Elbert Halston Davis as the third of their four children. As a child, Bonnie was a daddy’s girl who loved going to Westerns with her father and showing off by riding her bike around the neighborhood with no hands. After the untimely passing of her father when she was 13 years old, Bonnie’s mother moved the family from Independence to Salt Lake City, Utah. There, she attended Roosevelt Junior High and East High School, where she graduated in 1952.\n\nIn 1958, she met a charming 6’ 7” returned missionary at the local church dance named Paul Greenwood Grant. Paul was drawn to Bonnie’s southern class and beauty and the two were married in the Salt Lake Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, on June 15, 1959.\n\nDespite initially expressing a general disinterest in babies to Paul, Bonnie gave birth to their first child a short ten months after their wedding. Over the next 19 years, Bonnie would birth eleven more children, bringing the final head count to an even twelve—seven boys and five girls. Bonnie was very proud of her children—proud of both their individual accomplishments and their statures, often noting that nearly all her children easily surpassed six feet in height.\n\nAfter Paul retired from a judgeship in 1992, they moved to Jackson, Wyoming. Shortly thereafter, Paul was called to serve in Auckland, New Zealand as a mission president for the Church. At Paul’s side, Bonnie diligently served the missionaries in New Zealand, the Cook Islands, and Nuie Island for three years. During this time, she gained many new friends and admirers and enjoyed the beautiful surrounding landscapes.\n\nAfter their mission, Paul and Bonnie returned to their retirement home in Wyoming, where Bonnie would be close to the mountain range she so loved—the Grand Tetons. Bonnie’s work then shifted from missionary to innkeeper for the ever-revolving door of family and friends eager to take advantage of Bonnie’s first-rate hosting, which included clean and neatly made beds, delicious meals on perfectly set tables, and a fun-loving tour guide (Bonnie) with whom to explore the close-by national parks.\n\nPaul and Bonnie left their home in Wyoming and moved to Draper, Utah in 2013, where Bonnie would spend the final chapter of her life closer to her growing family. On June 9, 2022, Bonnie passed peacefully in her Draper home while lying next to her adoring husband of nearly 63 years. The room was filled with many of her children and grandchildren who came to bid a loving farewell to the strong matriarch of this large Grant clan.\n\nBonnie leaves behind a legacy of service, love, strength, and humor.\n\nAs a mother, Bonnie was a true “mama bear.” She was an exceptionally tough lady who loved her children fiercely, stood ever ready to defend and support them, and worked tirelessly to keep them well-fed to ensure they would grow big and strong.\n\nBonnie was a woman of unwavering faith and dedication to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She served her Heavenly Father selflessly through her many Church callings and frequent acts of kindness.\n\nBonnie was a hard worker and did not waste time in completing a task. You would be hard-pressed to find anyone who could match the speed at which she could type a document, drive a canyon, or peel a potato.\n\nBonnie loved her life and easily found joy in it. She dearly loved family and was not shy in letting them know with her sweet words, tight squeezes, and long goodbyes. She loved animals—both the domestic animals she cared for in her home and the animals she was so skilled at spotting in the wild. She loved classical music and old movies, often listening to a favorite song multiple times in a day and never tiring of rewatching a favorite film. She loved the outdoors and never shied away from the chance to swim in an ocean or lake, no matter how cold the temperature. She loved watching basketball, particularly the games in which her progeny played. She loved measuring the height of her grandchildren and inviting them, no matter their size, to sit on her lap for a cuddle. She loved to tease and could often be caught with a mischievous grin after successfully pranking an unsuspecting victim. She especially loved to laugh and delivered a signature giggle so infectious and adorable that it will stay permanently in our memories.\n\nBonnie is survived by her sister Sharon (Stephen) Anderson; husband Paul; children Gregory and Deanne (ret) Grant, Elizabeth and Robert (ret) White, Nathan and Diane Grant, Catherine and John Hunt, Joshua and Deborah Grant, Melissa Grant, Jeremy and Cynthia Grant, Jason and Carrie Grant, Rachel and Tim Taylor, Adam and Jennifer Grant, Seth and Heidi Grant, and Chrissy Grant; and 35 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren (to whom Bonnie is known as “Nana”). She is preceded in death by her parents and two siblings, Virginia Chapman and Eugene Davis. Bonnie leaves us with many happy memories and an example of a service- and joy-filled life that is especially worthy of emulation. We love and miss our Nana immensely. We are grateful to have been a part of her time on this earth. And we will think of her often until the happy day when we see her again.\n\nA memorial service to celebrate Bonnie’s extraordinary life will be held at 12:00 p.m. on Wednesday, June 22, 2022, at the Draper Utah Stake Center located at 13085 South 300 East, Draper, Utah. A public visitation will take place from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. on Tuesday, June 21, 2022, at Larkin Mortuary located at 260 East South Temple, Salt Lake City, Utah. Immediately following the memorial service, a luncheon will be held and hot fudge sundaes served as we celebrate Bonnie's wonderful life."
