        "text": "The actor Robin Nedwell, who has died of a heart attack aged 52, was blessed and cursed with looks that suited the market, but only for a very short period. His impish face, with big eyes perfect for reacting to sexual innuendo, was a comic gift during the saucy seventies, so much so that he was grabbed straight from drama school to play the skirt-chasing Duncan Waring in the TV sitcom Doctor in the House and its several sequels. He was typecast as a likely lad long after the sex comedy era was over, but towards the end of his short career he was granted his often-expressed wish to be taken more seriously when he worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nBorn in Birmingham of Quaker parents, Nedwell was brought up in Cardiff and always considered himself Welsh. A backstage theatre job convinced him to become an actor, and in 1966 he enrolled at London's Central School of Speech and Drama. It was there that he was spotted by one of the Monty Python team, Graham Chapman, who was then a writer for London Weekend Television on Doctor in the House.\n\nInspired by Richard Gordon's 1952 book of the same name, the sitcom, shown between 1969 and 1970, starred the already established Barry Evans, and made a star of Nedwell. The programmes, consisting almost entirely of tit and bum jokes, were extremely popular, both in Britain and around the world, but Nedwell refused to sign for the first sequel, Doctor at Large, preferring to take a supporting role in the BBC's more sophisticated sex comedy The Lovers (1970-71), and to appear in rep in Cheltenham and Sheffield.\n\nHe was persuaded to return to the role of Duncan Waring by the offer of top billing in the second sequel, Doctor in Charge (1972-73). There followed Doctor at Sea (1974) and Doctor on the Go (1975-77). In 1974 Nedwell and other cast members toured Australia and New Zealand in the play Doctor in the House. It was such a success that in 1977 they returned for another play, Doctor in Love, and in 1979 yet another TV series, Doctor Down Under.\n\nThere was little time during the seventies for Nedwell to undertake any other work, although he did manage small parts in minor films, such as Vault of Horror and Stand Up Virgin Soldiers, and played the title role in Gogol's The Government Inspector, both for the opening of Cardiff's Sherman Theatre in 1973 and for a BBC television schools broadcast three years later. This, he maintained, was one of his favourite roles. Nedwell's last memorable appearance in TV comedy was in the 1980 TV movie The Shillingbury Blowers and its spin-off series Shillingbury Tales. During production he had a well-publicised romance with his co-star, Diane Keen, but in 1982 married restaurant manager Heather Inglis.\n\nThe same year Nedwell complained, 'Only an idiot would still think of me as Duncan Waring from the Doctor series. But it would help if producers took me more seriously.' He gradually vanished from television, working instead as a touring stage actor. By the end of the eighties, he was the subject of 'Where are they now?' columns. 'I'd love a new TV series, if anyone out there is listening,' he told a reporter in 1990. All that transpired, in 1991, was the BBC's attempt to revive the Doctor formula. Alas, Doctor at the Top, which survived only one series, simply served to confirm the end of an era.\n\nNedwell continued to work in the theatre, mostly in light comedy (often on foreign tours for actor Derek Nimmo's company), but also in musicals - Brigadoon at the Victoria Palace in 1989, and The Sound of Music at Sadler's Wells in 1992. During the Royal Shakespeare Company's 1995-96 season, he appeared in The Devil Is an Ass, The Taming of the Shrew and Richard III. He was due to start work later this week on a new comedy drama series for children's television. Those who saw Nedwell's later work enjoyed a versatility for which too few casting directors gave him credit.\n\nHe is survived by his wife and a daughter, Amie."
