        "text": "On the surface, marriage might not appear relevant to many Australians today. Indeed, most women and half of men say that’s so. De facto couples enjoy the same legal rights as their wedded counterparts, one in seven Australians are in a de facto relationship, and a new survey showed a 15% drop in marriage rates among young Australians between 2001 and 2021. Yet sometimes even long-term de facto couples are choosing to marry, even after decades (and multiple children) together.\n\nWhy? And more pertinently: after such a long time, does it change anything?\n\nAccording to Dr Jessica Kean, a researcher in gender and intimate relationships at the University of Sydney, marriage is still an institution that is a “dense site of storytelling and meaning-making” about relationships, and those meanings are different for different people.\n\n“There are still sectors of society who see marriage as the only true sign of commitment, so some people may want to marry in order to gain status or recognition in the eyes of others,” she says.\n\nThose considering marriage, she says, should consider and talk about what marriage means to them and “what stories” they might be telling of themselves and their communities by taking part in this institution.\n\nSign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads\n\n“Some queer de facto couples who have historically been excluded from marriage, [might marry if it’s] something they always wanted,” she says. “Ultimately the impact of marriage will depend on what it means to the people getting married, and to their communities.”\n\nWhile most marriages are preceded by cohabitation, it is common to live in a de facto relationship without any intention of marrying; indeed, after a decade together most de facto couples would be considered to be either opposed to – or uninterested in – tying the knot.\n\nSo what of those who do wed after a little (or a lot) longer? Below, three women share their reasons for marriage after more than a decade with their partners.\n\n‘It’s made zero difference to us’\n\nSeana Smith’s mother always warned Seana against marriage. The warning stuck but, after 20 years and four kids with her de facto partner, Paul, the duo had to marry while planning a move to Saudi Arabia:\n\nI met my husband, Paul, when I was 31 and we got pregnant very quickly. By the time we met one another’s parents I was already expecting, so we just decided not to get married. I don’t think either of us had any romantic notions, and my family situation wasn’t a good recommendation for marriage … Mum used to beg us to never have a wedding and that kind of stuck.\n\nWe had quite a practical approach and just felt like we had too much going on. At the time my lawyer friend encouraged us to make wills to make sure we had the same rights as married couples.\n\nWe had four children and I always expected that one day one of them would come home and ask “Are we bastards?” but surprisingly that never happened. I never wore a wedding ring and I don’t think they noticed.\n\nPaul worked overseas a lot so we wore wedding rings when we lived in Karachi but, when he was thinking of moving to Saudi Arabia and we had to apply for a visa, we knew we had to get married. De facto would not have cut the mustard there.\n\nWe got married in Collaroy overlooking the sea, with two friends as witnesses, and then had a wedding breakfast at a local cafe. It was a lovely way to get married. I love other people’s weddings but the thought of organising one was too much for me.\n\n[When we got home afterwards] my daughter, who was 12 at the time, was upset because she really wanted to be there but our sons didn’t care.\n\nWe didn’t end up moving to Saudi Arabia, so I feel like I was conned into getting married. Saying the words to each other with really old friends there was a lovely thing to do but it’s made zero difference to us.\n\nWhen you’re older and see other people dying, you realise marriage is not about a wedding, it’s just about taking care of the other person because love is an action.\n\n‘I felt it would be harder to give up’\n\nA short-lived marriage in her early 20s left Diane* feeling as though she had followed expectations and not her gut. But though she was wary she married Rick* after nine years and two kids because she was keen to “cement” their commitment to one another:\n\nI had been married for a year at 23, after a five-year relationship. I had doubts and felt trapped in a relationship that I shouldn’t have let progress to marriage but there was so much momentum and [expectations around] social norms that I just followed suit.\n\nRick and I were living together within six months of our relationship and talked about marriage on and off, [particularly] when our friends were getting married after two or three years. I [made it] clear that it wasn’t something I wanted to do. It almost felt like if we hadn’t done it in those early years there was less of a reason for it.\n\nWe had a child in 2018 and shortly after fell pregnant again. That was a very challenging time for our relationship [navigating gender roles around work and child-rearing]. I did come to realise that marriage was probably important to him. And in thinking of it that way and not worrying about what others thought about another marriage, it started to become more important to me.\n\nWe decided to get engaged in between [the two children] as a way to emotionally lock in the relationship. There were moments that we both questioned whether getting married was the right thing to do, even having moments of questioning the relationship all together.\n\nWe had been engaged for about two years when his sister passed away unexpectedly. Family seemed to be more important to us after that; you worry about who else you might lose.\n\nI was nervous of not making the right choice again, and the spectacle of a [wedding]. [But] it felt like a chance to re-cement our relationship, to lock it in [for] the future after a difficult few years.\n\nI didn’t expect anything to change but I did feel like it would be harder to give up on the relationship. I hoped the fleeting comments during an argument about walking away would cease, and they have.\n\nWe have now been married nearly three years. I have more of a sense that we are more supportive of [one another] and working as a team together. He agrees that our relationship has improved. But whether that’s related to marriage or just life circumstances is hard to know.\n\n‘There was probably an element of tradition in our decision’\n\nKristy Sibanda and her husband, Lindani, lived together for 10 years before tying the knot, because it was only through marriage that their relationship was afforded “formal recognition” in Lindani’s Ndebele culture.\n\nLindani and I were only 19 when we met so we knew that we wouldn’t get married for some time. We wanted to finish university, set ourselves up in our careers, mature and have a level of financial security before [we had] a wedding.\n\nDespite the fact that being de facto in Australia now holds the same legal weight as marriage, the rights that come with [a de facto relationship] in Australia [are] not legally recognised in Zimbabwe. For us this could significantly impact the passing on of assets in a deceased estate.\n\nFormal recognition of a relationship in my husband’s Ndebele culture requires marriage, which involves a number of cultural practices. This includes notifying both sides of the family … typically an aunt on the woman’s side and an uncle on the man’s side … [to] ascertain whether the families will get along. [Then] there’s the lobola process (“bride price”) which is designed to be a show of respect and gratitude, and an indication of the commitment and seriousness of the union. Further, the two representatives of each family who were initially notified are essentially charged with assisting the relevant couple in their marriage if there are ever any issues that need to be resolved. It is somewhat of a safeguard, like counselling, to ensure your marriage has the best chance of survival.\n\nIf these traditional practices do not occur, and a formal marriage does not take place, whether it be traditional or civil, then the relationship is not recognised as being legitimate.\n\nI think there was probably still an element of tradition in our decision to marry: we wanted to declare our commitment to one another in front of family and friends and have it formally recognised. Marriage does not guarantee a lifelong partnership [but] I think that as a society we still tend to hold on to the notion that marriage ‘holds more weight’.\n\nWe also wanted to be married before having children. [While] I am no longer practising, I was raised Catholic, and I think up until recently I had a subconscious sense of obligation to “not have children out of wedlock”.\n\nNeither of us were nervous about tying the knot. I think we had lived together long enough to know each other extremely well, and to know how we worked together as a couple. We did not anticipate our day-to-day relationship changing significantly as a result of getting married [but] I think it has simply evolved over time, as every relationship does.\n\n* Names have been changed"
