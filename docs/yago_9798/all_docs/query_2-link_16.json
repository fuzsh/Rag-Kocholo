        "text": "Make-It-So Annual Scholarship\n\nThis scholarship was established by Dr. Jennifer Helbley to give hardworking undergraduate students the little bit of financial assistance they need to complete their degree, pay for one more quarter, or buy textbooks and supplies. The desire to found this scholarship came from witnessing diligent students struggling to cover their expenses. The scholarship seeks to offer immediate assistance to deserving students.\n\nAwarded By: Endowed Scholarship Committee\n\nEndowed Scholarship Committee\n\nAnees A. Haddad Endowed Scholarship\n\nThe recipients of this scholarship are international students who for financial reasons might not otherwise benefit from the Christian educational environment at La Sierra University. The scholarship is named Anees A. Haddad, a long-time La Sierra Professor of Sociology and Family Studies, former Director of the Division of Behavioral Sciences and Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. Dr. Haddad's career of excellence as teacher, scholar and academic administrator represents the best of La Sierra's cross-cultural tradition which has enriched the lives of all individuals in the La Sierra community.\n\nAwarded By: Endowed Scholarship Committee\n\nEndowed Scholarship Committee\n\nCaribbean SOUP Scholarship\n\nThis Fund is established by Bobby and Velda Brown to perpetuate the commitment of the La Sierra University alumni of the Caribbean and their friends (the SOUP family) to providing Seventh-day Adventist youth from the Caribbean educational opportunities at La Sierra University for years to come. When Bobby and Velda Brown came to La Sierra in 1996, they were welcomed into a community of Adventist believers who not only preached Adventism, but lived it. It was much like things were back in their home community, Jamaica; where most Adventist homes prepared soup for dinner on Friday nights, followed by vespers. You could show up at any Adventist home without an invitation and you would be sure to receive a warm welcome and some good food and great fellowship. So, even though they were living in someone’s home, they treated it like their own and continued the tradition of Friday night soup for dinner followed by vespers. It was not too long before they invited other Caribbean students and friends from La Sierra University to come and partake of SOUP and worship with the host family, Harriet Myres. After graduating from La Sierra University, Bobby and Velda established their own home in Riverside, and SOUP became even bigger, where not only were Caribbean students from La Sierra University attending, but also from Loma Linda University, DeVry University, and ITT Technical Institute. What “SOUP” Means S— Sustained support extended in a wholistic manner that encompasses the spiritual, social, emotional, physical and educational. O— Optimum environment that fosters academic excellence and promote opportunities for students to grow their dreams. It reminisces on the successes of previous students, inspires current students to remain steadfast in their dreams, celebrates individual accomplishments, as well as explores financial resources. U— Utopia—the perfect place away from home where Caribbean students meet weekly to be fed physically and spiritually. After a week of academic rigors, expended energy and other attendant challenges, students are provided with home cooked meal, warm fellowship, physical rejuvenation, and enough motivation to fact the uncertainties of the ensuing week. P— Prayer and persistent petition to God, powerful testimonies and spirit filled worship. The great hallmarks of SOUP are that it affords students the opportunity for worship, Christian fellowship, spiritual replenishment, and professional growth. The success of this magnificent program, established by Bobby and Velda Brown can only be measured by the caliber of students who benefited and the significant impact of their careers. The achievements of alumni from SOUP range from educators, nurses, financial controllers, researchers, philosophers, doctors, among others.\n\nAwarded By: Endowed Scholarship Committee\n\nEndowed Scholarship Committee\n\nChan Shun Endowed Educational Fund\n\nThis fund is established in memory of Dr. Chan Shun and in honor of Dr. Eugenia Chan by the Chan Shun International Foundation Board.

Howe Student Missions Endowed Scholarship\n\nParshall L. Howe, Ed.D. dedicated 43 years of service to Seventh-day Adventist education; his interest in mission service was been both strong and sustained. In 1937, he and Adelia Swingle Howe began seven years of mission service in central Africa and the Middle East. The bulk of Howe’s career was spent teaching mathematics at PUC Prep School, and later at Pacific Union College. At PUC he was director of the student missions program and took pride in the numbers and quality of the student missionaries. At age 57, Parshall and Adelia served as the oldest student missionaries when they spent six months in Uganda and Korea. After Adelia’s death, Howe married Myrtle Wakeham Hicks who comes from a family with impressive credentials as missionaries and educators. While Howe was never formally associated with La Sierra University, his son and daughter-in-law, Vernon and Winona Howe, have taught for many years at La Sierra. In addition, his daughter-in-law and grandchildren, Andrew and Stephanie Howe, are La Sierra alumni. Awards from this endowment are given in recognition of outstanding service by student missionaries.\n\nAwarded By: Endowed Scholarship Committee\n\nEndowed Scholarship Committee\n\nPaul and Evelyn Wickman Endowed Scholarship\n\nIn just three years Paul Wickman finished his training at La Sierra while pitching hay at $.25 an hour to help reach his dream of becoming an SDA evangelist.

He taught on the campus from 1960 to 1992. Hilmer got his formal education the hard way: he attended nine elementary and high schools in eleven years, and wasn’t able to enter college until the age of 31. Hilmer studied on his own during the years he wasn’t in school, even tackling subjects such as calculus. When he was unable to solve some calculus problems by himself, he walked six miles across Winnipeg to seek help from the high school mathematics teacher. The teacher looked at the problems and said, “Hilmer, you’re on your own; you are way beyond me in math.” Education was not the only thing that Hilmer did the hard way. He and his wife Lily adopted three Yugoslavian sisters age 11, 13, and 15 who didn’t speak any English. Their love for their new daughters transcended the inevitable problems of communication, and a loving family was formed.
