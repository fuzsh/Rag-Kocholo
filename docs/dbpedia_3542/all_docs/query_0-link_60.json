        "text": "Since the emergence of the global challenges of COVID-19 pandemic, its impact could be widely viewed in various human society aspects, such as education, business trading and also social interaction limit. Apart from many discussions on the pandemic from a wide range of such perspectives, scholarly attention is still rarely mainly in trying to elaborate the critical overview from an Islamic perspective following theological, historical, and sociological points of view. In this paper, the critical elaboration of the pandemic has been widely discussed by analysing the contents of sacred scriptures and responses from an Islamic point of view. The literature was critically conducted from religious sources such as the Qur’an and Hadith, and also related contemporary works. The finding reveals that the pandemic has been given full attention as stated in the Qur’an and narrated in Hadith by taking a lesson from pandemics and strategically battling the pandemic. The following attentions were addressed in order to strengthen the Muslim community and society in order to support the health protocols arranged by the local and international health organizations. The value is that religion’s clear comprehension could give continued support to encourage the Muslim community especially and general society at large in the attempts to battle the spreading pandemic.\n\nIslam is the religion of all ages. It is adaptive, assimilative and accommodating religion that provides its adherents an unparalleled blueprint to lead an exemplary life. It guides its followers about every aspect of life, be it of past, present and future. Therefore, a true believer always looks towards Islam whenever he encounters any calamity or catastrophe. The latest outbreak of COVID-19 also warrants moving towards Islamic teachings for coping strategies. Corona virus, for sure, is an apocalypse for humanity. The aim of this article therefore, is to analyze the guidelines that Islam provides to its followers, for prevention and management of the pandemic. The paper reveals that, what today immunologists and the WHO are suggesting as preventive measures in order to remain protected from global contagion, were also advised by Prophet Muhammad (SAW) about 1500 years back. In addition to these, Islam recommended seeking medical treatment, intake of good foods and drinks, supplica...\n\nThe study&#39;s purpose is to analyse the prevention of the Covid-19 Pandemic in the light of the Holy-Qur&#39;an and Prophet Muhammad (Pbuh)’s Sunnah. Just as a Pandemic, disaster, or calamity in the world has some external causes, it also has some internal and subtle reasons. Islam considers the plague as a punishment in a natural and broad sense; simultaneously, Islam believes this epidemic to be a test and a warning for the believer. Besides, Islam thinks that dangers and calamities happen according to Almighty Allah&#39;s judgment. Islam always gives the idea of a healthy-capable human group. There are &#39;Kitabut Tib&#39; or medical chapters in almost all Hadith texts regarding the importance of health and treatment. The golden branch of Islam was the development of a particular scripture called the Prophet in Tibet. If there is a Pandemic in a specific area, Islam prescribes quarantine and lockdown. Modern medical systems embraced this warning fourteen hundred years ago as t...\n\nThis paper, examines the Covid 19 pandemic and its future predictable like the deadly influenza virus, showcasing the Islamic-social measures to deal with such viruses with references to its events in history. The research traced back centuries in the history of the world to identify similar case studies. In the history of humans, there is Hong Kong/68 (H3N2) pandemic, and when the Russian contagious disease strain (HINI) resurfaced in 1977, the contagious disease family originated from mammals and several other animals. Hence, the study established the fact that Islam prescribes different measures to contain it. Muslim folks and others should take good care of their health by eating a balanced diet and maintaining good health habits in their bodies and places of worship. Descriptive and doctrinal methods are adopted to explain the Islamic perspective and some social strategies for dealing with pandemics. Finally, it is recommended that the provision provided in the Islamic objecti...\n\nAbstract Though the COVID-19 pandemic may seem novel, pandemics are not new to the greater human experience. This paper highlights the psychological and spiritual coping mechanisms that early Muslims drew upon from Islamic teachings when they endured similar plagues. We analyze Muslim experiences of communicative diseases with a focus on their personal, communal, and public responses throughout history. This perspective provides valuable insights as to the role played by faith and spirituality in the responses of the Muslim community. By examining a selection of plague outbreaks between the 8th-19th centuries across the lands broadly defined as the Islamic Mediterranean, we highlight psychological and spiritual coping mechanisms that can serve as a model for dealing with similar contemporary challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the responses of previous generations of Muslims, modern Muslims can construct adaptive responses guided by Islamʼs rich resources of meaning-making to thrive in the face of the challenges of the current pandemic.\n\nThe Coronavirus crisis has undoubtedly changed the landscape of the world. The pandemic has radically changed the way of life of most of the seven billion people in the global community. In the past, people living in uncertain times have sought solace and comfort in God, through the medium of faith. This paper considers historical perspectives of past epidemics and pandemics, comparing and contrasting the themes that arise through relevant religious teachings of Islam and Christianity, with the aim of identifying sources of consolation to contemporary adherents in the current crisis."
