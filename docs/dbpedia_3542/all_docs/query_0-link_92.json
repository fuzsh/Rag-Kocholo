One of them may be set in Lisbon, in 1999, when wandering through the streets I witnessed several public demonstrations against the brutality of the militias and the Indonesian military, in the aftermath of the referendum for the independence of East Timor. My curiosity on this occasion inspired me to try to understand violence in Timor and its historical connections with the Portuguese presence. In addition, a remark by a former Portuguese colonial officer, a relative of the late governor Celestino da Silva, at an early stage of my research was also a key trigger for this project. He had read the manuscript reports of the 1895–96 campaigns, which he continues to keep carefully as part of family archives: ‘Look, Doutor’, he said to me, ‘The Portuguese were so few; the Timorese so many. How could “we” have remained in Timor so many years?’ The question, and the possibility of searching for an answer, ignited my historical and anthropological imagination. The central mystery of this book—the question of the authenticity of the skulls at Coimbra University—first grabbed my attention as I encountered a lengthy paper of 1937. This put me on the track of this fascinating collection and the interlaced histories of scientific collecting and indigenous headhunting, in ways that I would not have predicted. The uncertainty of this collection’s provenance and the mystery that it fed on ethnological discussion in the 1930s–40s became my own historical enigma and forms the storyline of this book. In 2003, the themes of the possession and repatriation of historical human remains in British museums took centre stage in public debate. If I had not been in the United Kingdom in this period, my perception of the wider implications of skull collecting for world history, and of the contemporary significance of historicizing the colonial past of human remains collections, would not have come into being. Several people helped lay the foundations of the book and I can only hope that none of them will be omitted here. In Cambridge, this book started as a doctoral dissertation in history approved in 2007. I am indebted, first of all, to my supervisor, Christopher Bayly. The example of his scholarship has been a constant inspiration, and without his unceasing and generous support, and his challenging comments and criticism, this study would never have been completed. I also owe a great deal to Diogo Ramada Curto for encouragement and advice in the initial stages of this project. In Cambridge, Richard Drayton has offered precious guidance and enthusiastic support in many important ways over the years. For comments and conversations that significantly shaped this work, I am grateful to Rosalind O’Hanlon, Simon Schaffer, and Megan Vaughan. In the examination of the thesis from which ix\n\nx Acknowledgements\n\nthis book derives I was fortunate to benefit from the comments and criticisms of Nicholas Thomas and Ian Brown. Their demanding remarks have challenged me to improve and reshape this work. I hope at least some of their questions have been answered. A number of friends and scholars have kindly shared their expertise and offered helpful advice. With Kim Wagner and Patrice Ladwig I have held long and enriching discussions about anthropology and history. Their companionship was invaluable. Paul Turnbull has introduced me to the history of ‘body-snatching’. Among the many friends and colleagues who have given me support, ideas, and criticism I wish to thank particularly Chris Ballard, Cristiana Bastos, Barry Craig, Henrique Martins, Tiago Moreira, Andrew Moutu, João Arriscado Nunes, Gonçalo Praça, Sara Rasmussen, Hugo Reinert, Amiria Salmond, Lynne Stumpe, Jorge Varanda, and João Vasconcelos. For insightful comments and criticism on draft-chapters, I am grateful to Vee Barbary, Rachel Berger, Mathew Carey, Martin Holbraad, Max Horster, Patrice Ladwig, Ashley Lebner, Hank McCurdy, Sadiah Qureshi, Taylor Sherman, Alan Strathern, and Kim Wagner. Sadiah and Taylor, in particular, have shown great patience and courage in helping me improve this text. In Ponta Delgada, Alexandra Baptista has generously offered her help in the preparation of the cover image of this book. Thanks are also due to João Segurado for his assistance in preparing maps and images. In Lisbon, finally, the completion of this book benefited from the support and encouragement of my fellow colleagues, anthropologists, and historians in particular, at Institute of Social Sciences. I could not have done this work without the outstanding support of the curators, archivists, and anthropologists of the Coimbra Anthropological Museum, notably Eugénia Cunha, Maria Rosário Martins, Nuno Porto, and Maria Augusta Rocha. During my stay in East Timor and Macao in 2003–04, I received the help of many generous people. In Dili, I am greatly indebted to José Mattoso for guidance and advice; Tânia Bettencourt Correia and João Ferro for friendship and support; and to Dr Fernanda Santos and the staff of the Fundação Oriente in Dili for assistance in a difficult period of illness. Virgílio Smith and Benjamim Côrte-Real took time from their busy schedules to discuss Timorese colonial history. In Macao, I wish to thank Rui Rocha and Maria Manuela Paiva for their hospitality, and Tereza Sena of the Macau Ricci Institute. In Sydney, I am grateful to Margrit Koettig and Alasdair Macgregor for receiving a young researcher in Australia; in Port Moresby, I owe a debt of gratitude to Jim Robbins, and especially Sebastian Haraha and his family for friendship and assistance. In Lisbon, I am most grateful to Commander Guilherme Alpoim Calvão and Colonel José Carlos Montalvão for permission to study their family archives regarding the former governor of Timor, José Celestino da Silva. João Loureiro has offered me priceless guidance in gaining access to private archives and illustrations; I am also grateful for\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nxi\n\nhis permission to reproduce postcard images of colonial Timor from his private collection. For help in locating collections and documentation, I must thank Hugo Cardoso, Janet Gunter, Cristina Neto, Artur Teodoro de Matos, and Ivo Carneiro de Sousa. Thank you also to Vítor Oliveira Jorge for clarifying issues of copyright. For their patient help I am especially indebted to the librarians and archivists of the Casa-Museu Leal da Câmara, Sociedade de Geografia de Lisboa, Arquivo Histórico Ultramarino, Australian Museum, Macleay Museum of the University of Sydney, Royal College of Surgeons of England, and Coimbra University. For permission to reproduce illustrations, I am grateful to Câmara Municipal de Sintra/Casa-Museu Leal da Câmara, Museu e Laboratório Antropológico da Universidade de Coimbra, and Arquivo Histórico Ultramarino. I am especially grateful to Eng. António Bandeira for permission to reproduce pictures from his grandfather’s unique private album of photographs. The set of rare and anonymous photos of Portuguese officers and Timorese warriors in colonial campaigns here published was a possession of the late army officer Carlos Leitão Bandeira, a second-lieutenant in Timor from 1900 to 1903. The pictures possibly depict the campaigns led by Celestino da Silva against either Aileu or Manufahi and its allies in 1900. I wish to thank the Institute of Social Sciences of the University of Lisbon for essential support in the final stages of this book, and the authorities of the University of Azores for granting me research leave from 2002 to 2006. For fundamental financial assistance I am obliged to the Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia, Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior, Portugal, for a Doctoral Grant (BD/9048/2002). For funding my fieldwork I am grateful to the Smuts Memorial Fund and Darwin College, University of Cambridge. For welcoming me as affiliated researcher in late 2003, I am indebted to the authorities of the Papua New Guinea National Museum and Gallery. I am also grateful to the Fundação Oriente, Portugal, for the accommodation and facilities generously provided to me at Dili and Macao. As always my parents, Manuela and Jaime, and my sister, Cecilia, have provided me unconditional affection and support over the years. My final and greatest debt is to Catarina, who has always believed this work was possible. Her love and strength have never let my weaknesses prevail.

The original colonial terms were respected in quotations. It is to Tetum-praça that I refer when mentioning Tetum words and concepts. Tetum-praça was the lingua franca of the territory during the colonial period, constituting a form of Tetum influenced by the Portuguese language. All passages originally in Portuguese and French have been translated into English by the author. Aclála: Timorese war cry. Arraial (pl. arraiais): irregular armies composed of Timorese warriors and supplied by the Timorese kingdoms to the colonial government. Asua’in: title bestowed on brave warriors and headhunters. Bando (pl. bandos): instructions communicated by the governor to the kingdoms. Barlake: traditional Timorese marriage contracts. Batuque: Timorese drum-playing. Dató (pl. datós): Timorese aristocrat or noble. Estilo (pl. estilos): lawful traditional norms and customs. Finta: annual tribute paid by the Timorese kingdoms to the Portuguese government in Dili. Liurai (pl. liurais): Tetum term signifying ‘lord of the land’ or ‘territorial lord’. Lorosa’e: songs chanted on occasion of decapitation of enemies; lorosa’e could also designate the rites of reception of severed heads.

It is an enquiry into the interactions between European colonialism and indigenous cultures, and an investigation into the relationships between colonial violence and the science of anthropology in that historical period. By looking closely at Portuguese colonialism in East Timor, it aims to understand how indigenous peoples and colonial powers interacted in a mutually dependent way, and how collected remains came to be seen as objects of political, symbolic, and scientific significance. As such, this work combines imperial history and historical anthropology with the history and sociology of science. The social life of collections, the relations between colonizers and colonized, and the nature of indigenous ritual violence, or headhunting, have been studied by scholars of the history of science, imperial history, and social and cultural anthropology. However, these topics have not been investigated as a connected whole. This study brings them together through an interdisciplinary approach that examines the circulation of human skulls and the stories told about them to offer a broader understanding of how colonialism, headhunting, and anthropology become mutually intertwined. Hence this book is an attempt to use skulls and their webs of documentation as a prism through which to view how these different processes intersect. The book explores these issues through a focus on a revealing case study. It tells the story of a unique museum collection of skulls obtained in East Timor in the late decades of the nineteenth century, the authenticity of which was the subject of controversy throughout the twentieth century. Although at the time Timor was a peripheral colony of a secondary European empire, this territory nonetheless epitomizes the critical significance of severed heads to both colonial power and indigenous cultures. Moreover, the rich, and contentious, history of Timorese museum collections exemplarily brings to light how colonial documentation systems and historical accounts interacted with colonial order, racial theories, and with the identification 1\n\n2 Headhunting and Colonialism\n\nMap 1 East Timor.\n\nof human remains. I expect the narrative that follows, as it examines in detail the historical events and elaborates on their conceptual consequences, to illuminate the wider relevance of the cases which form the basis of this study. My purpose now is to introduce the reader to the particular research problems posed by the colonial setting. The remaining sections will explain the methodology of this study.\n\nEast Timor, a fragment of the imperial past Imperialism is an atavism. It falls in the great group of those things that live on from earlier epochs, things which play so great a role in every concrete situation and which are to be explained not from the conditions of the present but from the conditions of the past.1 From the 1870s to the early twentieth century, Portugal was experiencing a rising tide of nationalist and imperialist euphoria. Portugal’s colonial possessions then extended from significant portions of land in Africa to a handful of small colonies in Asia. But the empire had seen better days. It looked diffuse, neglected and disconnected, and seemed to promise diminished economic returns. Attachment to the idea of its resurgence,\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nhowever, dominated the minds of contemporaries.2 The sixteenth-century Age of Discoveries, recalled as a glorious era that had taken Portugal to a place of political eminence and economic success in the world-system, had long past. The revival of opulence enjoyed during the eighteenth century with the exploitation of South American resources had been put to an end in 1822, when Brazil declared independence, definitively breaking ties with its former colonial masters. Brazil had been lost. Portugal’s early modern maritime empire in Asia had been crumbling since the seventeenth century, under the pressure of Dutch and British interests in the region. Only fragments survived: Goa and the small territories of Damão and Diu in India; the city of Macao; and, finally, the eastern side of the island of Timor. The hope of a new age that would restore the economic prosperity and political glories of the past inspired the dream of a ‘Third Portuguese Empire’ centred on the exploration of the imagined, nearly mythical, wealth of the African colonies—primarily Angola and Mozambique.3 The energies were turned to the scramble for Africa; the lands of the East, Timor above all, lingered on the margins of old imperial maps. Throughout this period, East Timor was perceived as an utterly remote and mysterious Portuguese colony. Despite nearly four centuries of Portuguese presence—initially in West Timor, based in Lifau and since 1769 in the East, based in Dili—the impact of European ‘civilization’ seemed nil and economic profits a mirage. Portuguese rule, a governor confessed in 1893, had resulted solely in ‘loss of lives and money’.4 It was conventional in Portuguese colonial literature to open with a statement on how little the Portuguese public actually knew, and how misinformed the imperial authorities were about the most remote, most ‘unfortunate’, most rejected, and ‘least known’ of Portugal’s colonies.5 Timor’s reputation in Portugal was, in fact, very poor: it was said to be a ‘damnable colony’ cursed to perpetual backwardness.6 ‘Considered from every possible point of view’, a former official complained in 1903, ‘except for its natural wealth, one must admit Timor is the most miserable country in all the universe, where civilization has never entered.’7 The chronically ‘uncivilized’ and unprofitable character of Timor was then difficult to accept, and an influential current of opinion in the 1880s vehemently argued for ‘abandoning’ the colony ‘once and for all, for no matter what price.’8 This perception gained wider currency in the context of critiques of the ‘decadent’ and ‘backward’ state of the Portuguese nation vis-à-vis other ‘modern’ European countries, a leitmotif of progressive Portuguese intellectual circles of the 1870s. Nevertheless, engulfed by the rising imperialist–nationalist ideology that would dominate imperial policy in Portugal from the 1890s, these critical views did not prevail. Thereafter, the sacred principle of the Portuguese empire’s historical continuity would determine that all colonial territories dating back to the Discoveries were necessarily inalienable.9 In Timor, the empire may have been adrift, but\n\n4 Headhunting and Colonialism\n\nin the name of a splendid imperial past, no colony, not even Timor, could be relinquished. The prosperous era of the sandalwood trade with Macao in the seventeenth century had long passed, and the Portuguese had ceased commerce and navigation in Timorese waters.10 Relationships with the colony were limited to routine administrative matters, and, in any case, troubled and erratic. Despite two inconsequential periods as an autonomous province (1851–52 and 1863–66), Timor had always been subordinate to governors either in Goa or Macao. By the 1870s, ‘Macao and Timor’ constituted a single province. The ‘district’ governor in Timor was subordinate to the authority of the ‘provincial’ governor in Macao. Yet, the colonies were separated by many miles of water and by many days of travel. When, why, and how a certain occurrence took place in Timor was often unintelligible to Macao, let alone to Lisbon: ‘all attempts are practically vain’, the governor of Macao wrote in 1880, ‘to know what goes on there in the various areas of public administration’.11 Moreover, the political conflicts between the authorities in Macao and Timor caused constant problems for the imperial administration. In 1896, administrative autonomy was finally granted to Timor. But the tensions with Macao and the communication problems continued. During much of the year, Timor was isolated. In the 1890s–1900s, for instance, an urgent telegram from Dili to Lisbon could take at best 15 days, for the Dutch steamers that called at Dili twice a month had to first take the message to Makassar or Surabaya, from where it was finally transmitted.12 The Portuguese establishment in Timor, furthermore, seemed defenceless. Throughout the colonial period the shortage of regular troops was constant. The regular army was a fluctuating and undisciplined amalgam of Africans, Goanese, Portuguese, and Macanese, who erratically arrived either to replace other aged and diseased soldiers, or to staunch episodic rebellions. In the event of war against local enemies, the Portuguese dependence upon indigenous forces—the arraiais and the moradores—was complete. The arraiais represented a rather unstructured company of irregulars: armed men supplied by Timorese allies to the Portuguese on occasion of war, as a tributary obligation of vassalage. The moradores were a more structured and loyal company of irregulars composed of the Timorese residents in Dili and in the fortified settlements of Manatuto and Batugadé.13 Created by the governor Coelho Guerreiro in 1702, at Lifau, and later reorganized in Dili, these companies were under the direct command of a Timorese lieutenant colonel, had an autonomous body of Timorese officers, and military ranks similarly to the regular army. They served as volunteers, whenever they were called to fight, and received no stipend, simply their arms. Distant and isolated, the administration seemed condemned to oblivion and misery. The complaints about shortage of military forces, officials, and scarcity of financial resources were a perennial feature of official correspondence. Apart from occasional non-Portuguese nationals, the European\n\nIntroduction 5\n\ncommunity was largely confined to Dili and numbered a few Portuguese officials and army officers, a body of regular soldiers, and occasional missionaries. Beyond the capital city, government authority was said to be ‘nominal’.14 The territory was fragmented into a multitude of variously sized and highly autonomous indigenous polities, the so-called reinos (kingdoms), ruled by Timorese authorities who bore the title of rei (king). The autonomy and rivalry of the kingdoms towards the Portuguese establishment seemed to block colonial rule. Wars with the Timorese kingdoms were practically an annual occurrence. A military model of territorial administration was attempted in 1860–63, and the kingdoms were divided into administrative districts supervised by colonial officers.15 However, the shortage of military personnel severely limited the efficacy of this system. In 1891, for instance, only five army officers supervised the north coast; on the south coast only one out of six districts had an officer in charge.16 Throughout the nineteenth century an extensive gallery of governors arrived with dreams of modernizing the government. Between 1873 and 1894, when Celestino da Silva began his 14-year tenure, Timor experienced 17 governors and one government council. Most governors did not last more than 2 years; some succumbed to malaria, the unbearable conditions of isolation, or often to the political conflicts with Macao and local officials within months. But those who survived disease usually left the island convinced that colonial administration was practically hopeless. Every imperialist project aimed at modernizing the state, civilizing the people, or bringing indigenous authorities under more centralized control seemed to produce little or no effect. It was as if colonialism in Timor could never be modern. In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, then, East Timor challenged in important ways the contemporary imagination of modern imperial rule. Yet, the Portuguese did not want Timor because of the present. They were there because of the past. The past, a mythical past of imperial glory, was, indeed, the reference. Timor was regarded as a vestige of the golden Age of Discoveries. For this reason, imperialism in the island was meaningful, legitimate, and desirable. An ideological form of ‘imperialism as atavism’, to borrow from Joseph Schumpeter’s critical insight, thus seemed to be expressed in Portuguese official policy with regards to Timor. The territory was and should remain Portuguese because it was part of a holy heritage of revered ancestors. Eventually, on this kind of ideological ground the Portuguese government continued to claim legitimate possession of East Timor as an integral part of Portugal, practically until 1975, when the Portuguese were forced to leave in the face of the Indonesian military invasion.\n\nThe sociology of Timor’s ‘colonial atavisms’ The attachment to a sacred national past legitimated an atavistic imperial policy of preservation of Portuguese rule in the territory, against all odds. Yet,\n\n6 Headhunting and Colonialism\n\nideology alone is insufficient to explain the persistence of the Portuguese colonial presence in the territory. How, locally, could the European establishment be maintained with such a weak colonial apparatus, left on its own in such a marginal fragment of the empire? The answer to this question should consider yet another kind of colonial atavism that seemed to prevail in Timor. In fact, the daily practice of administration seemed to reproduce institutions, symbols, and practices perceived by the Portuguese as coming from the past. These atavisms enabled the effective exercise of government, and included elements that the Europeans classified as ‘oldfashioned’, ‘primitive’, ‘feudal’, ‘pre-modern’, or even ‘barbaric’. Although fundamental to colonial rule, the ceremonial institutions of the Portuguese administration were a heritage that most governors wished to see definitively behind them. Governor Lacerda in 1880, for instance, regretted that the Portuguese had once put the colony ‘under an entirely aristocratic organization, for we even committed the mistake of granting the title of kings to régulos [indigenous authorities]’.17 Many political institutions of the late nineteenth century, in effect, had been introduced by former Portuguese governors in the seventeenth and eighteenth century. Then, just like in other Asian and African colonies, the Portuguese tried to secure the subordination of local chiefdoms by means of a ‘feudal-styled’ institution: vassalage oaths.18 The Portuguese also granted European military ranks and status titles to Timorese aristocracy. These institutions were the basis of important political ties with Timorese polities. In return for their investiture as kings, for instance, the Timorese authorities were obliged to obey the orders of the governor, annually pay a tribute in kind—the so-called finta—and supply labourers for public works and armed men—the arraiais—at the governor’s request. As one governor stated in 1795, ‘because of a very ancient pact established with the first Portuguese conquerors . . . they provide support against the enemies of the State.’19 However, the persistence of these early colonial elements was generally perceived as undesirable. All the more so since these ‘colonial’ structures to a considerable extent had blended with the ‘indigenous’ political structures. This colonial system, to a significant extent rooted in atavistic colonial institutions and in the indigenous cultures, could hardly be reduced to the dichotomy ‘indirect’ or ‘direct’ rule, to a process of post-conquest vulgarization of power, or to a functional rapport with collaborators.20 Its workings were of a different character. The interconnections with the indigenous world in particular, as Chapter 1 will suggest, had over the centuries become symbiotic. These ties seemed to be especially intimate concerning warfare and the exercise of justice. Critical to the argument of this book, colonial warfare offered an occasion for the Timorese warriors to practice traditional headhunting against the Portuguese enemies. By the late nineteenth century, the intimate connection between Portuguese and these ‘barbarisms’ was increasingly uncomfortable. Yet, colonialism in Timor seemed to be too\n\nIntroduction 7\n\ndependent on the energies of Timor’s ‘pre-modern’ and ‘barbaric’ configurations to be able to survive without them. These were colonial atavisms that actively were made part of the contemporary reality so much so that they were not mere ‘atavisms’ at all. They were the quintessence of colonialism in practice. One purpose of this book is to explain how precisely the Portuguese engagement with these ‘atavisms’ made colonialism possible. Part I in particular will deal with this problem. This study, thus, does not approach the apparent survivals of the early modern Portuguese empire, or the blending with indigenous elements as dysfunctional signs of barbarism and backwardness. Instead, here they are regarded as processes that could play a dynamic part in the formation of colonial order. The existing literature fails to provide a convincing explanation for Timor’s atavistic colonialism. Its negative connotations remain, and Timor’s colonial atavisms have been either inadequately discussed, or superficially investigated.21 In this vein, for example, the main work with any historiographical pretensions regarding the period covered by this book has portrayed the colonial military mechanisms as evidence of the ‘feeble’, ‘miserable’, or ‘mediocre’ character of Portuguese colonization.22 This work does not analyse in detail the diversity of atavistic structures associated with the practice of colonial rule. The intention is to characterize its general mechanisms and focus on the most striking of these structures: ‘headhunting’. Timorese ritual violence might be seen as a way of expressing hostility towards the Portuguese establishment. Yet, this book demonstrates that Timorese headhunting was also a constituent element of Portuguese colonialism. Since the beginning of the Portuguese presence on the island of Timor in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the ritual decapitation of enemies had been a common practice in colonial warfare. In the late nineteenth century, this form of violence grew to an unprecedented scale and intensity in the course of the so-called ‘pacification’ campaigns led by the Portuguese against their indigenous enemies. These campaigns caused enormous devastation. Many indigenous villages were destroyed, and hundreds of people were killed and beheaded by the Timorese warriors who fought alongside the Portuguese as auxiliary troops. This suggests that ‘colonialism’ and ‘headhunting’ could form a dynamic unity. Their interdependencies enabled colonial power and indigenous cultures to coexist and prosper in a reciprocally significant way, even if their distinctiveness in some manner was retained. This book characterizes this form of entanglement as ‘mutual parasitism’. This conceptual framework seeks to enrich imperial and postcolonial studies with a fresh alternative to current understandings of colonial interactions based on the notion of cultural hybridity, a matter which will be dealt with thoroughly in Chapter 1. The focus will be the period from 1875 to 1912–13. This period covers the critical years of the Portuguese late imperialist activity in Timor,\n\n8 Headhunting and Colonialism\n\nuntil the moment when eventually the greatest ‘rebellion’ against the Portuguese establishment took place in the country.23 This was followed by important shifts. Although these did not totally break with previous patterns, some of the basic institutions that had organized colonial order for many decades (such as the organization into kingdoms, the finta, or the vassalage) changed rather dramatically. Timorese headhunting, too, seems to have entered a period of some inactivity, possibly resuming during the conflicts that followed the Japanese occupation of East Timor during the Second World War. How and why could such a historical configuration have come about, exactly when European imperialisms were so self-conscious of their ‘civilizing mission’? How could the rising ‘modern’ science of anthropology engage with such an ‘atavistic’ form of colonialism, one in which ‘European’ and ‘indigenous’ cultures of violence seemed to be entangled? This book will attempt to answer these big questions by tracing small things. It will focus on a particular aspect of this atavism—the colonial engagement with Timorese headhunting—and observe its connections with anthropology at the micro-scale.\n\nThe micro-history of a collection of skulls In 1882, 35 human skulls were sent from the Portuguese colony of Timor to the Coimbra University museum in Portugal, where the greater part of the collection is still held today. It was a rare and invaluable set. Although many hundreds of human skulls of ‘exotic races’ had already reached the hands of anatomists and anthropologists in Europe, nowhere could a similar sample of Timorese skulls be found. In the second half of the nineteenth century human skulls from ‘savage’ populations and remote parts of the world were desirable scientific objects for museum scholars working in the emergent science of anthropology. Skulls were expected to provide crucial evidence for the construction of a universal table of the ‘races of men’. In Portugal, the arrival of the collection virtually coincided with the institutionalization of anthropology at Coimbra University. The skulls were measured and studied in 1885 by anthropology students and in 1894 the findings were published in a Portuguese journal. The author of the paper, J. G. de Barros e Cunha, relied on craniometry for drawing a classification of the races of Timor. This work is meaningful within the context of international debates on the ethnology of the Indonesian Archipelago. Yet, in the early decades of the twentieth century, this anthropological study was strongly questioned in Portugal. Then, a public controversy about the authenticity of the collection arose. Former colonial officers in Timor claimed the collection was not ‘authentic’, and suggested that the crania belonged to a mixed group of Portuguese, African, Timorese, and Indian soldiers slaughtered by Timorese head hunters in 1895. The controversy reached its peak in 1935–37, and in the process some of the main actors in the field of\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nPortuguese colonial anthropology became involved. The dispute sparked debate on the ethnology of Timor, along with historical research on the colonial origins of the collection. However, the history and identity of the collection was to remain uncertain. The controversy, too, despite its coeval importance to the field of anthropology, has since remained invisible— only a few, locally, at Coimbra Museum, recall its existence. The original participants in the discussion had passed away by the 1960s. Ethnogenic debates and the study of skulls fell out of academic fashion from the end of the Second World War. In Portugal, after the April Democratic Revolution of 1974, the paradigm of physical anthropology with its racial and colonialist undertones gave way to the predominance of social and cultural anthropology. This book investigates the trajectory of this museum collection of Timorese crania. The reconstruction of the history of this collection between the 1870s and the 1930s takes the form of a ‘micro-history’.24 The empirical perspective is microscopic. Yet, as micro-historians have insistently emphasized, the main purpose is to view single and marginal events within larger historical processes. Its virtue lies in the capacity to restore the fragment, in the words of Comaroff and Comaroff, to ‘a world of meaningful interconnections’.25 In the discipline of history, this approach has been normally explored in the European context, especially in biographies of subjects, communities, or events at the margins. This book extends the scope of micro-history. On the one hand, it argues that historians ought to embrace the micro-history of objects. It calls attention to the need to engage, from approaches grounded in the singular, with ‘material life’, that ‘rich zone, like a layer covering the earth’, as Fernand Braudel suggested, ‘made up of people and things’.26 This engagement is pursued in relation to museum collections. It is worth clarifying here that because it is concerned with the fragment as a world of interconnections, the micro-historical approach to collections goes beyond the museum. Its object is much wider in scope, scale, and reflexive ambition than the circumscribed and individualized historical knowledge attached to museum objects in archival registers and labels. These museum ‘histories’, as this study demonstrates, offer a ‘miniature historiography’, which should be taken as the very object of micro-historical analysis and a starting-point for accessing wider interconnections and circulations.27 On the other hand, it suggests that it is the moment for imperial historians to explore the methodological insights of micro-history, so as to articulate the recent concerns with world history with a focus on ‘small’ things rather than on ‘big’ structures.28 The history of the ‘big’, in effect, may offer additional reasons for treating singularities as ‘worlds of interconnections’. As C. A. Bayly recently argued, a major change in world history during the period covered by this work was the proliferation of linkages and connections. Therefore, if ‘the long nineteenth century’ has made the significance of local histories increasingly global, so the dense analysis of singular\n\n10 Headhunting and Colonialism\n\nhistories of circulation can become a privileged site for the study of global processes in that context.29 The circulation of the collection—both as a material entity and as an object of knowledge—is examined across time, geographical space, and cultural and institutional boundaries. As such, it offers fertile ground for exploring a set of important and wider issues. Firstly, with its origins in ceremonial violence in Timor, the collection enables us to analyse the relationship between colonialism and headhunting in a specific locality. Secondly, as the object of a controversy about ‘authenticity’, the collection enables the discussion of processes of the ways in which anthropological knowledge and colonial history were mutually constituted. Controversies, as students of science and technology have shown, are appropriate subjects with which to think about ‘science and society’.30 In a similar vein, the dispute about the collection’s authenticity brings to light complexities in the circuits of things and documentation, thereby charting the development of the connections between ‘anthropology and empire’. Because this dispute is set in Portugal, its analysis exposes the specificities of Portuguese colonial anthropology. However, this study also intends to show that the traditional national histories of anthropology, such as the Portuguese, need to be reconsidered at a transnational level. By the same token, it suggests that the narratives of anthropology’s history conventionally centred on the British, French, or German anthropologies ought to encompass the crossnational circulations revealed by ‘other’ histories of anthropology. Thus, thirdly, in intersecting with international ethnological debates, the collection brings out the webs of scientific knowledge in which the collection was entailed. The transnational dimension of the collection was not confined to scientific ideas. Because the Timorese collection was an example of the large-scale circulation of things and texts, there is a fourth and important aspect that it enables the study to address: the ‘global political economy’, in the words of Andrew Zimmerman, of anthropological specimens, during the ‘museum era’ of anthropology (c. 1850s–1920s).31 Museums then became central nodes of long-distance networks through which artefacts, skeletons, and skulls were circulated as ‘collections’.32 The fact that these circuits were sustained by the often violent intrusion of European colonization into indigenous territories of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and America has become a source of post-colonial distress, especially visible in repatriation disputes.33 Perhaps for this reason, the circulation of indigenous skulls in the colonial period has not been addressed outside the political struggles regarding the ethics of collecting.34 The history of the Coimbra collection offers an occasion to study unexplored aspects of this large-scale process. It brings to light a significant and little discussed dimension of the ‘global political economy’ of colonial anthropology: the traffic of collections of histories that followed the traffic of collections of things.\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nTracing connections between objects and archives Rather than simply offering a micro-history centred on subjects, therefore, this work proposes a micro-history centred on objects. It combines the potency of approaches grounded in the singular with approaches centred on the analysis of things. This might encourage colonial studies, for some time epistemologically trapped in the vicious circles of discourse analysis, to engage actively with the recent attention paid to the social study of materiality.35 As such, this work explores new ways of thinking about material objects in imperial and post-colonial studies. The privilege given to material objects in human sciences has roots in the epistemologies of nineteenth-century museum anthropology. In the twentieth century, these were criticized for their essentialist and evolutionist views of material culture, giving way to symbolic and linguistic orientations.36 In the last three decades, the focus on museum things was revived as a legitimate means of accessing the cultures of people. Many have thus found inspiration in Appadurai’s ‘social life of things’, Kopytoff’s notion of ‘cultural biography’, or Thomas’s approach to the ‘recontextualizations’ of objects.37 Methodologically, this book also ‘follows things around’, but it takes alternative theoretical directions. This study is concerned with looking at culture, power, and knowledge as emergent within the social and material webs formed by skulls, texts, and people.38 It explores the epistemologies and collective effects generated along these webs, by focusing on the trajectories of attachments of things and words. Chapter 5 will further explain how this approach theoretically differs from the conventional cultural biography of things. The methodological sensitivity to the circulation of things, consequently, implies symmetrical sensitivity to the circulation of texts. For, texts, too, can be approached as ‘things’ in circulation. Thus, it is not simply the circulation of human skulls that this micro-history of collections intends to analyse, but the connections that objects in motion maintained with circuits of archives. This book considers archives of things as ‘circulating entities’. This notion differs from current definitions in two ways. On the one hand, it calls attention to the material nature of archives, in contrast with a notion of the archive as a de-materialized and supra-discursive totality; on the other hand, it emphasizes the archive as a fluid and mobile entity in a state of becoming, an entity which emerges in practice and can be located in many places. In social theory, the notion of the archive has been marked by Michel Foucault’s view of the archive as a discursive system of historical a priori that rules over the formation of particular discourses.39 Foucault’s emphasis on the discontinuous, historical, and fractured nature of such archives may be worth preserving in this context of analysis. However, its structuralist connotations should be avoided. Instead, I intend to start from a more ‘down-to-earth’ definition: circulating archives can be seen in the traditional\n\n12 Headhunting and Colonialism\n\nsense as a ‘collection of records’. However, the word archive does not refer to a precise physical location in which these records are kept. Archives are not immobile documentation systems with a permanent location. They constitute formations of texts and stories that are in flux across time and space. As such, they emerge throughout the collective networks of circulating museum objects. In effect, that ‘global political economy’ of anthropological objects that historians have talked about did not just move objects from place to place. It also traded narratives and information; it circulated texts from hand to hand. This was a dynamic economy of archives in circulation whose networks extended beyond the museum and gave rise to a productive economy of knowledge. In many cases, in fact, descriptions of objects resulted from practices and occasions that preceded the arrival of collections in the museum. Thus, a view of the documentation of objects as static systems in a museum fails to understand the workings of these knowledge processes. Strikingly, despite recognition of the growing importance of documentation in museum practice at the turn of the nineteenth century, and the emergent interest in the ethnography of archives (colonial archives in particular), the analysis of archives as circulating entities remains a largely unexplored topic in the histories of science and of anthropological collections in that period.40 By following the ways in which archives of museum objects come into emergence, this study reconsiders the significance of knowledge-making and archive-building as processes entailed in the trajectory of collections. The account that follows, then, is not solely a micro-history of a collection of objects. It is a history of documents, and of the consequences for colonial history and anthropological understandings, which could result from their presence or absence. In effect, this study begins with a singular silence; it begins with a broken archive. The identity of the crania held today at Coimbra University has been labelled problematically ‘Timorese’ throughout the period of its presence in the museum. Their provenance is not clearly established; their original documentation remains unknown. In undertaking a micro-history of this collection, this study will bring out new linkages, and will unearth the missing story.\n\nThe structure of the book This book is structured as an analytical narrative, the sequence of which tries to respect the contingent, reversible, and multiple interconnections that shaped the course of the Timor collection from the 1870s to the 1930s. For these reasons, throughout this work the linkages between the collection and the events described may for some moments disappear from sight, only to re-appear later in the account. Part I, ‘Encounters with Parasites’, discusses the dynamics of colonialism and headhunting in East Timor from the\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nearly 1870s to 1912. The purpose is to understand the connections between colonial power and the circuits of decapitated heads created by indigenous ritual violence during colonial warfare. In offering a cross-cultural analysis of Timorese ritual life and the ceremonial character of Portuguese rule, it brings forward a theory of colonial parasitism that guides the understanding of colonial interactions in Timor, and is expected to be of wider application in other empirical contexts. The circulation of severed human heads in East Timor is here examined as a central manifestation of this complex symbiosis arranged by the European and indigenous collectives in the realm of justice and violence. Chapter 1 explores an episode associated with the origins of the Coimbra collection—the military campaigns of 1896—so as to examine critically the categories of ‘headhunting’ and ‘pacification’. It also introduces the conceptual framework of ‘mutual parasitism’. Chapter 2 investigates the forms of colonial power that resulted from the entanglement of the colonial and indigenous worlds. It describes the theories and cultural strategies by which the Portuguese and Timorese cultures were entangled both in the exercise of justice and in the conduct of war. The relationship between colonial warfare and headhunting rites is explored further in Chapter 3. This chapter analyses the colonial accounts of headhunting rites. By examining the ritual circuits of severed heads in colonial warfare, it demonstrates how colonial rule and indigenous societies could form a circulatory system. In addition, it describes this system as organized by the Portuguese attempts to regulate purity and pollution in the circulation of human remains. Part II, ‘Skulls and Histories’, investigates the trajectories of human skulls throughout the networks of museum anthropology, and explains how the colonial events of warfare became intertwined with the collection, with the trade, and with the scientific study of skulls. By looking in detail at the complex trajectory of one set of human crania from East Timor to the Coimbra Anthropological Museum, in Portugal, it examines why and how the severed heads circulating in colonial territories could appear in anthropological museums. The intention here is to understand how colonial circuits could engage with scientific circuits of human skulls, and to attend to the mediatory role played in this process by the stories told about the skulls’ racial and colonial identity. Chapter 4 analyses how the collection was sent from Macao to the Coimbra University in 1880–82. It will be revealed here that the collection was sent to Coimbra without associated ‘histories’. The significance of human skulls for late nineteenth-century anthropology is investigated at the international, national, and local level in Chapter 5. The following chapter, Chapter 6 describes international and national debates on the classification of the races of Timor, and focuses on the controversy over the authenticity of the skulls, in the 1930s. The collection’s conflicting narratives will then be analysed. Chapter 7 brings together\n\n14 Headhunting and Colonialism\n\nthe dynamics of colonial interactions discussed in the first chapters and the anthropological trajectory of the human skulls. It investigates two colonial collecting histories for the collection as ‘social dramas’ of colonialism. It then recovers the ‘original’ archive of the skulls, and explains its emergence in the context of struggles between the Catholic Mission and its enemies in Timor.\n\nPart I Encounters with Parasites\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 Parasitism in Colonial Interactions\n\nIn historical as in anthropological approaches a dichotomous idiom prevails in the description of European intrusions into indigenous societies. ‘Barbaric’ practices, such as headhunting, figure prominently in this imagery: they are doomed to elimination by European colonialism that imposed ‘civilization’ on ‘savage’ and exotic tribes. Recently, this colonial idiom has been criticized by post-colonial theoreticians who resort to the concept of hybridity. This chapter argues, however, that both colonial and post-colonial vocabularies are inadequate to describe symbiotic associations between indigenous and European realms, in particular between headhunting and pacification in colonial Timor, and provides an alternative analytical framework. Building on the notion of mutual parasitism, a new way of conceptualizing intimate colonial interactions between the European and indigenous collectives is proposed. This chapter focuses on one event of the ‘pacification’ wars, thus called to express the Portuguese determination to eradicate local ‘resistances’ to colonial authority in late nineteenth-century Timor: the destruction of the mountain village of Dato-Tolo in 1896 by a punitive expedition composed of Timorese headhunters and Portuguese military. This episode reveals that ritual violence and decapitated heads could add to the vitality of colonial empires, at the same time as indigenous headhunting intensified and prospered in becoming part of pacification campaigns. These observations disrupt the dichotomy between ‘headhunting’ and ‘pacification’, and pave the way for an argument on parasitic symbiosis. Moreover, the focus on this episode is meaningful for reasons examined later in the book. The Dato-Tolo campaign also intended to avenge the massacre of a Portuguese military column and the beheading of Portuguese officers, in 1895. The severed heads resulting from this campaign were to be at the centre of a controversy about the authenticity of the skulls held at Coimbra Museum. Chapters 6 and 7 will explore in detail the connections between this event and the collection’s history. 17\n\n18 Encounters with Parasites\n\nThe first two sections of the chapter examine the headhunting/ pacification dichotomy, as it has been displayed in colonial imagination and anthropological literature. The third section, in particular, attempts to extend the consequences of a critique of this dichotomy to the understanding of colonialism in Timor, and to the comparative discussion of similar colonial interactions in other contexts and periods. Here, the notion of symbiosis is set against the idea of hybridity, shifting the interpretive framework of post-colonial theory into a mutual parasitism framework. Because thinking of colonialism symbiotically moves the analysis forward, the final section of this chapter offers a theoretical discussion of parasitic symbiosis in human relations. The conclusion provides an interpretation of Michel Serres’s theory of parasitism. The purpose is to transfigure his proposal into an original theory of mutual parasitism informed by the historical anthropology of colonial interactions in Timor. This perspective provides an interpretive device for examining the Portuguese activity in East Timor from the 1870s to 1912 in the remaining chapters. Mutual parasitism explains how the colonial and the indigenous worlds could be held together by mutual inclusion and asymmetric balances. This form of symbiosis between European and indigenous collectives allowed colonial rule and indigenous order in the jural realm to coexist and prosper through a relationship of close interdependence. This involved reciprocal gains and reciprocal losses, mutual change through minimal transformations, as well as many political and cultural intimacies. Yet, it also involved the creation of boundaries and the preservation of difference. This perspective, then, calls attention to the fact that colonial communities and local societies might be mutually energizing and mutually reliant, whilst in some manner retaining their distinctive dynamics. Ritual violence and the circulation of severed human heads played a principal role in this symbiosis. Chapters 2 and 3 will explore further how this mode of relating held together colonial and indigenous collectives in the realm of justice and war.\n\nDato-Tolo, 1896 Às fogueiras das clareiras, nas clareiras, ao luar, Vamos todos, vamos todos, vamos todos a bailar. As cabeças de inimigos, as cabeças vão saltar. Inimigos, perdoar, inimigos, estalar, rolar! Ui! Na serra a guerra aterra a terra. É rumor o tambor, é rumor de guerra.1 Dato-Tolo was located in the peak of a rocky hill, surrounded by dense groves of trees. The ruggedness of Timor’s mountain range, the central backbone of the island irregularly ascending in height from East to West, seemed to have\n\nParasitism in Colonial Interactions\n\n19\n\nconspired to place Dato-Tolo—a hamlet in the kingdom of Sanir—in a perfect defensive position.2 The inland populations of East Timor, particularly in the western regions, took advantage of the relief to build their villages. Rings of settlements were scattered along the top of the hills. Each was a potential citadel, encircled by walls or palisades made of trees, bamboos, or stone. Dato-Tolo gave the impression of a village ‘shaped as a castle’,3 and the Timorese populations, according to the Portuguese, considered it ‘unconquerable not just because of its position but also its fortifications’.4 This view added to the reputation of Sanir as a lawless country, a ‘small kingdom’ traditionally disobedient to colonial authority, living off plundering its neighbours and where ‘robbers, assassins, drunkards, tramps, and criminals of every kind’ found safe haven.5 Second-lieutenant Francisco Duarte and captain Francisco Elvaim camped in front of Dato-Tolo on the afternoon of 13 August 1896. The governor of Timor, Celestino da Silva, had sent them on a mission to punish the indigenous kingdoms deemed responsible for the most disastrous Portuguese loss registered in recent wars against Timorese enemies: in September 1895, a government column, including all the Portuguese officers, was massacred at the hands of warriors from the Western kingdoms of Cová, Cotubaba, Fatumean, and Sanir. This time, nearly 6000 armed men were under the command of Duarte and Elvaim. A small force was composed of Timorese irregulars (the moradores) and less than 40 Portuguese regulars—sergeants, corporals, horn-players, artillerymen, and one missionary. Yet, the large majority of the troops consisted of auxiliaries, the arraiais,6 supplied by allied indigenous kingdoms as a tribute to the government.7 As the troops approached Dato-Tolo from the mountains, the beating of drums and strident Timorese aclalak (war cries) sounded. There were reasons to worry. The sight of stone walls freshly built by the residents and the cold reception by the villagers on the way alarmed the officers.8 Confrontation was imminent. A sequence of diplomatic attempts to negotiate the allegiance of Sanir with the government forces, and thereby prevent an attack, had proved to be unsuccessful. Furthermore, information reached second-lieutenant Duarte about Dato-Tolo harbouring fugitives from Cotubaba and Cová. When a request to deliver the fugitives to the Portuguese was ‘insolently’ denied, immediate assault was ordered.9 The resistance was tenacious. For four days losses occurred on both sides. Dressed in traditional war costumes, armed with flint guns, swords, spears, and some Albini firearms given by the government, the Timorese arraiais stood at the forefront. Second-lieutenant Duarte and allied indigenous leaders urged on the arraiais as they struggled to scale the walls. At the rear, artillery fire targeted the defences, but often with little success. On 17 August, however, Dato-Tolo’s defences finally broke, and the village was taken. Some managed to get away by releasing the village buffaloes—a most valuable source of wealth—and causing general confusion; various men even\n\n20 Encounters with Parasites\n\nabandoned the arraiais in a greedy attempt to secure a few buffaloes for themselves. But inside Dato-Tolo, and in the surrounding villages, many did not have the same chance. The violent assault continued, unusually, through the night and for the following days across Sanir territories. Francisco Duarte described the moment as a memorable colonial victory, unforgettably cruel: I cannot recall the natives having suffered such a complete punishment set by the government until this very day. The spectacle offered by Sanir to all neighbouring kingdoms that witnessed the events of the evening of 17 to 18 August shall live on in the memory of the living for many years, I am sure, and the tale will pass down from parents to children and from grandparents to grandchildren.10 Captain Elvaim was no less assertive: after a ‘blood-thirsty fight’, he remarked, ‘we came out as winners and with our sovereignty established once and for all among these rebel and treacherous peoples, who have for so long mocked our forces.’11 In official reports to the governor, Duarte and Elvaim told of the scale of violence by quantifying the number of dead and wounded on both sides. The count also included the number of Sanir’s smaller villages plundered and set on fire by government arraiais during and after Dato-Tolo had resisted. They recorded how many hamlets were burnt down; how many cattle, agricultural produce, and all possible kinds of village objects and wealth were taken as booty by the arraiais; and how many trees, how many agricultural fields were destroyed. A record was to be kept of every occurrence of damage, as if the ‘severity of punishment’, the military victory, and the prestige of Portuguese sovereignty in Timor was increased in strength and prosperity by the very act of recording the material destruction and dispossession inflicted upon the people and property of Sanir. In a vain literary attempt to depict that tragic evening at Dato-Tolo, captain Elvaim reported: To paint the scenes of horror inside the hamlet [of Dato-Tolo] during that evening is beyond my powers; I will simply say that the flames, the anguishing cries combined with the raging yells of the victors, the shooting, the sound of bamboos cracking on the fire, and the lorosá sang from all directions offered an example of what hell should look like. And this scene lasted from 7 p.m. until dawn of the next day. Dato-Lolo [sic] was taken and the floor covered with more than 100 corpses, disembowelled, decapitated and horribly mutilated; nevertheless the pillage went on, and now and again some shots and one lorosá announced that one more had fallen into the hands of our [forces].12\n\nParasitism in Colonial Interactions\n\n21\n\nTimorese ritual violence was an integral part of the Portuguese victory. Lorosás, or lorosa’es, ritual headhunters’ songs, ‘two single notes in thirdminor’13 accompanying lyrical verses of sacred connotations were chanted by the warriors of the government arraiais on occasion of successful beheadings of enemies in battle. Such songs were performed during the battle, and also on the communal occasions of reception of the severed heads at the village or the arraial encampment.14 In Portuguese eyes, this could but be seen as barbarity. Yet Duarte would confess himself powerless in the face of the ritual violence of arraiais in combat: fifteen persons were killed and decapitated, because the arraiais cannot resist the pleasure of watching the heads of their adversaries roll on occasions of war, it is indeed a barbaric act, but we cannot avoid it whilst we need such forces to go to war, and unless the natives attain a higher degree of civilization.15 Awareness of risking European values at the sound of the auxiliaries’ lorosa’es coexisted with a pragmatic capitulation to the efficiency of Timorese ritual violence. As if simultaneously inevitable and highly rewarding, the Portuguese deliberately abandoned themselves to the flow of indigenous actions. Who in fact was included or excluded from the collective ‘we’ used by the military officers also appears difficult to ascertain. The tone forming the mixed identity of the winning armies was ambivalent, in a rhetoric that slipped from moments of demarcation to a picture of mutual association: ‘they’ (Timorese arraiais) barbarously took heads of ‘our’ (Portuguese . . .) enemies; ‘our’ (Timorese and Portuguese . . .) ‘forces’ won; ‘we’ (Portuguese . . .) gloriously ‘came out as winners’. To add yet more complexity to the divisions and entanglements of this collective, one observes that the officers’ reluctant acceptance of the arraiais’ ‘barbaric actions’ ran parallel with an insistent incorporation of both Timorese arraiais and enemies’ decapitated heads into a narrative of imperial aggrandizement. The head of Brao Sacca, the presumed assassin of Captain Câmara, was one of the prizes, among the many other heads taken from the enemy: ‘In that day,’ Duarte wrote, ‘the enemy left 104 heads in possession of our arraiais, and many more would have been taken were it not for their stratagem [of setting buffalos free]. Among the heads taken was that of the famous Brau Sacca, assuai of Cová, a proof that the Cová people received and witnessed the punishment imposed on Sanir . . .’.16 After wiping out Sanir, the government troops proceeded in the direction of Cová. In a telegraph message to the Ministry of Navy and Overseas Affairs in Lisbon, the governor requested urgent aid from Macao: ‘Rebels Sanir defeated many dead large booty. We are in front of Cová.’17 Aid and ammunition would not come in time. But the governor took the gamble,\n\n22 Encounters with Parasites\n\nand ordered the attack on Cová. Surprisingly, the Queen’s village and the rest of the kingdom were rapidly taken with little resistance. As in Sanir— and also as before, in Cotubaba—the officers’ records of plunder, killing, decapitation, and destruction were no less exhaustive. So it was later in Lokeo, Fatumean, Dácolo, and Deribate—the violence of Deribate’s combats was impressive enough to be described as the ‘bloodiest and most tenacious war’ ever seen in Timor.18 The fighting generated such an emotional charge that the arraiais and moradores proved their devotion to the Portuguese cause shouting as they advanced towards the enemy: ‘We shall die! We shall die! It is service of the government!’.19 In Sanir, Cová, and Cotubaba 169 people were beheaded, while a high, yet unknown, number of dead and wounded had been left behind.20 ‘Punishment’ was accomplished, ‘justice’ done, Portuguese ‘prestige’ re-established. Dato-Tolo was erased from the map. From Lisbon, reactions to the news of victory were enthusiastic. The King of Portugal, D. Carlos, congratulated the ‘officers and soldiers’ for having ‘once again demonstrated the bravery of the Portuguese people.’21 On 20 October, the General Overseas Office sent a telegram to Dili praising the feat of arms and reassuring the governor of their ‘full confidence’ in his ‘energy, direction and good judgement’ in the governance of Timor. As proof, Lisbon announced that it was granting Timor the autonomy its administrators had longed for, finally putting an end to Timor’s complicated subordination to the governorship of Macao.22 Colonial wars were in their heyday. Metropolitan public opinion had lived in a general atmosphere of nationalist excitement about overseas possessions since the ‘pink-map’ episode and the humiliation caused by capitulation to the British ultimatum of 1890.23 Imperialist patriotism thrived. As noted in the Introduction, a highly emotionally patriotic ideology that fed on the historical imagination of ‘the Portuguese empire’ as a sacred heritage from the glorious age of the Discoveries fostered the project of a ‘third Portuguese empire’. Recent military victories in Mozambique in 1895 had stimulated truly collective apotheosis. The national newspapers followed every step of the Portuguese troops in Africa, Goa, and Timor as ‘heroic’ achievement. The news of another native rebellion successfully crushed by the Portuguese army in Timor, therefore, could only add to the belief in the nation’s spiritual mission as imperial power. It was the idea of a perennial empire in the flesh, the revalidation of a lost glory.24 The war accounts of 1896 were received at the Ministry in Lisbon as part of official correspondence from Dili. A long report by the governor Celestino da Silva preceded and introduced the military reports, explaining the rationale behind the military occupation of the Western kingdoms. The imperial government recognized the achievements of the campaign by ordering the reports to be fully published as a book under the official patronage of the Ministry. It came off the press just a few months later, in 1897.25 Further\n\nParasitism in Colonial Interactions\n\n23\n\nnationalist readings would commemorate this publication as an illustrious landmark of the Portuguese colonial presence in Timor.26 Yet, prior to publication, a reader of the original manuscripts at the General Overseas Office commented passionately on the achievements described in the reports. Two months of campaigns, which had mobilized more than 8000 men, had augmented Portugal’s national glory. The ‘Portuguese nation’ owed a ‘debt of honour’ to those ‘braves’ who raised the name of Portugal to such a crowning point. Medals and high honours should rapidly be granted to the victors—and indeed they were.27 Keeping count of beheaded enemies, moreover, seemed to reach a peak at the ministerial offices in Lisbon. For if doubts remained about how empowering the arraiais’ ritual violence was for the vitality of the Portuguese empire, an emphatic mention at the General Overseas Office would dissipate them: ‘Fights were sometimes so violent that our losses heightened to forty men among dead and wounded, and the enemy, in one single combat, also left 104 heads in possession of our forces.’28 The underline is original. The quantification of destruction is a conventional mark of victory in war reports. Strikingly, however, in the military accounts sent to the Timor governor in 1896, which were praised by the Ministry, and published with official honours in 1897, the enactment of this discursive convention involved a ceremonial calculation of beheaded people by Portuguese forces. This practice amounted to an enactment of headhunting in which words take the place of ‘real’ heads, a practice we might begin by describing (to borrow a notion from Kenneth M. George’s ethnography of Sulawesi rites with surrogate heads) as ‘ritual mode of speaking’, a performative representational practice of ‘showing signs of violence’ by staging headhunting in narration.29 Yet, here there is a peculiarity that pulls apart a straightforward ascription of ‘headhunting’ to non-Europeans. It consists simultaneously of a ‘ritual mode of speaking’ about headhunting and empire. The accounts bring headhunters and imperialists strangely together as one collective, one whole, strategically unified in the attainment of military victory. This takes us beyond the mere essentializing of otherness. The resonance of lorosa’e ritual songs in the accounts cannot be taken simply as a Timorese trait; it is a selfdescription of imperial encroachment. It is not a story that the Portuguese officers simply told about ‘others’, but one they told about themselves. More complexity can be added as we look in detail at this peculiar ritual mode of speaking. It is not suggested that Portuguese military officers or soldiers physically took heads; it was something the arraiais did. Yet, the texts point to more than a semiotic incorporation of decapitated heads as information. They suggest a way of actually performing colonialism by head-counting. Texts in Timor and Lisbon display the Portuguese taking heads as signs, but not as material entities. This suggests a double circuit of mutual incorporation of decapitated heads by imperialists and headhunters. Chapter 3 comes back to the complexity of this circuit in more\n\n24 Encounters with Parasites\n\ndetail. It suffices to observe here that, in the colonial texts, both forms of sign and substance appear inter-connected in a discursive enactment of Portuguese colonialism. Imperialism was performed by the arraiais’ ritual decapitation and the Portuguese ceremonial headcounts for their own profit. An association prevailed such that detaching Timorese headhunting from Portuguese empire-building could only be done at the expense of a loss of imperial strength, prestige, and prosperity. Ultimately, this dissociation could only occur at the expense of the very possibility of colonialism in Timor. In the colonial texts, human heads were not outside the empire—they were brought inside it, infusing vitality into colonialism. As a consequence, semiotic head-taking in colonial texts resembles the link between severed heads and communal prosperity exhaustively discussed by ethnographers of indigenous headhunting.30 Yet, here, one finds the Europeans (not the indigenous people) claiming such collective prosperity from the act of staging ritual violence and head-counting in colonial speech. Heads as signs added to Portugal’s vitality as an imperial nation. This seems puzzling, however. For ‘headhunting’ and ‘colonialism’ should not coexist in the same space. Timorese ritual violence came to life inside the logic of colonialism; even the Portuguese incorporation of heads into narratives displayed logics of vitality analogous to structural ethnographic features of indigenous headhunting. We are, therefore, faced with complexities that break down the conventional opposition between headhunting and colonialism. Instead of setting these notions apart, the war reports of DatoTolo invite us to think of them together, as a composite entity in which the two terms interpenetrate, forming a new whole. This merging, however, runs against a long-standing dichotomy. The next two sections examine this dichotomy demonstrating how the terms ‘headhunting’ and ‘pacification’ have been imagined in opposition. An alternative way of conceptualizing the entanglement of these categories, in and beyond the literary accounts of Dato-Tolo, is then proposed in conclusion.\n\n‘Headhunting’ Head-hunter: n. A savage who practises head-hunting. Head-hunting: n. Among certain savage tribes, the practice of making incursions for the purposes of procuring human heads as trophies or for use in religious ceremonies.31 As victories were reported from Timor in 1896, the notion of ‘headhunting’ conveyed a meaning opposite to an interpenetration of European and nonEuropean cultures. Decapitated heads had a powerful presence in Western representations, for they were central to various Biblical stories and Greek myths.32 Yet, long since the classical era, the European imagination had also\n\nParasitism in Colonial Interactions\n\n25\n\nbeen used to drawing a sharp line between the ‘barbarism’ of societies practicing ritual decapitation and the advent of a ‘civilized’ social order, even within the geographic borders of Europe.33 In the late nineteenth century, this latter meaning crystallized as a stereotype attached to remote nonWestern societies seen as the ‘barbarian’ otherness of ‘civilized’ Europe. It organized one of those anthropological dichotomies characteristic of the civilizing and evolutionist idioms of the Victorian age. A deterministic historical ordering juxtaposed to the classical category, and the tribal peoples of Southeast Asia especially fitted into the stereotype. Encyclopaedias of the period described headhunting as a trait of primitiveness ‘still surviving’ only among ‘savage tribes’ outside Europe, a custom more generally ‘prevalent among all Malay races’, particularly in Southeast Asia, Borneo, and the Philippine Islands.34 Headhunting was a primitive custom seen as naturally doomed to extinction in the face of Europe’s civilization. ‘Colonial contact’ and the unequal clash of races would, sooner or later, bring about its complete collapse. The extermination of headhunting constituted a historical inevitability and a moral duty of late nineteenth-century colonizers. Entrapped in the idiom of the Western civilizing mission, headhunting represented more than just a descriptive label for ‘otherness’; it conveyed a prescriptive moralizing agenda that justified intrusions and repression on the basis of the need to morally redeem the ‘savage’. Colonizers were expected to live up to the ethical principle of the extermination of barbarous customs (headhunting as well as cannibalism and other stereotypes of unruly and pagan savagery) and to see to the replacement of barbarous heathens for good Christians, disciplined subjects, or productive labourers. To act in contravention of this principle was a dangerous perversion of the neat symbolic boundaries that organized European identity and difference in the colonial venture. Thus a good deal of the most fervent contemporary criticism of colonial expansion adopted the trope of Europe’s fall into indigenous barbarisms, like headhunting, and other moral perversions of the civilizing mission. Stories of Europeans ‘going native’ by turning into ‘white headhunters’ stood as ultimate evidence of these dangers.35 They epitomized imperialism’s most sinister side, the selfannihilating fall of the civilizing mission into its opposite: a danger famously elaborated in Joseph Conrad’s powerful allegory of Heart of Darkness in 1902, ‘those heads drying on the stakes under Mr. Kurtz’s windows’.36 For the ethical principles of colonialism to be preserved, headhunting was a category that could only apply to the Timorese arraiais of 1896. The only acceptable way Europeans could relate to their barbaric opposites was by causing their elimination—by violent means if necessary, or, in other words, by ‘pacification’, a colonial term then used to designate the legitimate exercise of violence for the purpose of severely repressing indigenous barbaric practices, and eradicating indigenous resistances to colonial occupation. In the early twentieth century, alternative courses of history seemed difficult\n\n26 Encounters with Parasites\n\nto be imagined: ‘Severe repressive measures’, readers of the Encyclopaedia Britannica were informed in 1910, ‘have led to its [headhunting] decrease.’37 Today, this statement sounds prophetic in Southeast Asian historiography. The Dutch pacification campaigns of the 1900s, part of the moralizing Dutch Ethical Policy, are taken as having profoundly eroded autochthonous political systems and headhunting traditions in Southeast Asia.38 And it has been conventionally accepted that, from the 1890s onwards, every European power acting as bearer of ‘civilization’ took effective steps to eliminate headhunting and other forms of savagery in the region.39 This oppositional idiom and the historical fact of the eradication of headhunting have prevailed in colonial ethnographies. Yet, most post-colonial anthropology has some difficulty in totally erasing the main terms of the dichotomy. Structuralist approaches consider headhunting as a characteristic of indigenous communities (a cultural trait most particular of Southeast Asian cultures), which one could understand abstracting the history of colonial contact.40 Certainly, since the ‘historical turn’ of the 1980s, anthropology has gone beyond both civilizing ideologies and structuralist essentialisms. It has exposed the fallacy of presuming that headhunting was static and belonged to a primitive, ‘pre-colonial’, past. Although anthropologists still tend to draw upon the historical idea that modern Western imperialism forcibly suppressed headhunting as a form of practice,41 they nevertheless contest that headhunting as a form of culture simply disappeared with the coming of the colonizers’ ‘severe repressive measures’. As Renato Rosaldo, Janet Hoskins, and other scholars have demonstrated, postcolonial indigenous communities continued to rely on memories, artefacts, and traditions of headhunting for shaping their collective identities and the politics of the present.42 In these post-colonial times, the stereotype is turning against the Europeans, as a criticism of the colonial period. The demonizing effects of the stereotype, however, are not dissimilar from the colonial construct. Various researchers have shown how Southeast Asian indigenous communities inverted the original dichotomy. Indigenous critical reformulations of Europeans as headhunters (such as the rumours of ‘construction sacrifice’) have been interpreted as a form of cultural reaction to the violence of colonialism as well as to that of the post-colonial nation-state.43 Collectors of human remains for anthropological purposes have also been labelled as ‘headhunters’ by means of the same inversion, in the wave of critiques that focused on the horrors of colonial methods of collecting.44 Anthropological analysis and indigenous critique give new life to the perception of the headhunter. Yet, they do so by retrospectively making complicit the ‘white colonizers’ in the same evils of barbarous otherness that the Western civilizing vision excluded from its self-definition. One ends up, however, moving in circles. The old opposition returns, now as\n\nParasitism in Colonial Interactions\n\n27\n\nan inversion, and so anthropological analysis remains stuck in a dichotomy. If European colonizers can be part of an analysis of headhunting as a cultural construct, they continue to be excluded from any analysis of headhunting as a practical form of ritual violence. Hoskins’s conception of headhunting as ‘trope’ and as ‘practice’ is in this respect exemplary. A consequence of this distinction is that anthropologists should allow colonial Europeans to participate in headhunting’s ‘life as trope’, but not in its life as practice; indigenous ‘traditional practice’ alone represents proper ceremonial violence—‘modern’ practices of decapitation, thus, are at best mimicry.45 Perhaps anthropology’s tendency to lay its empirical focus exclusively on indigenous communities has detracted from a serious interrogation of the Europeans’ involvement in ‘traditional’ headhunting in the colonial past. It seems at any rate clear that the dichotomy arranged by the category ‘headhunting’ hinders an understanding of what was happening in Timor in 1896. In practice very little justified such a sharp antagonistic demarcation between ‘colonial pacification’ and ‘traditional headhunting’. Therefore, if anthropology and history have yet much to learn from each other, we might do well by going back to the colonial past and re-assessing the categories. The complexities of the events of Dato-Tolo challenge us to conceive of the European presence as internal to, and constitutive of, indigenous structures of headhunting, and vice-versa—even when Europeans thought of themselves as bringing about headhunting’s final extermination by means of ‘pacification’.\n\n‘Pacification’ The campaign reports of 1896 made the intimate contact between the Portuguese empire and Timorese ritual violence dramatically visible. Further references to the campaigns by Portuguese nationalist historiography insistently pointed this out. The victories over the Western kingdoms have been highlighted as the landmark of the Portuguese modern colonial occupation of Timor, and emphatic references to the campaigns and their so-called ‘liturgy of decapitations’ resonate well into the twentieth century (Fig. 1).46 Furthermore, the counting of heads in military reports, and their incorporation into visions of imperial prosperity, was not limited to the events of 1896. It constituted a common mode of reporting headhunting and imperial expansion in Portuguese war reports throughout the nineteenth century, and in particular during the so-called ‘pacification period’ of Timor, from 1894 to 1912, the date of the most destructive, and last Timorese rising against Portuguese authority. In this period, more than 20 devastating ‘pacification’ wars opposed the colonial government and its allies to other indigenous kingdoms.47 Pacification would indeed become synonymous with the name of José Celestino da Silva, governor of Timor\n\n28\n\nFigure 1 Headhunting in colonial pacification wars depicted as an expression of indigenous savagery.

(Fig. 2) Celestino da Silva led 22 pacification campaigns. Because of his victorious campaigns and effective methods of government Celestino da Silva earned recognition as the creator of modern Portuguese Timor. The Estado Novo nationalist historiography of the 1930s has covered the figure of Celestino with a legendary aura, the influence of which is still evident.48 Celestino da Silva’s campaigns were carried out with virtually no regular troops. (Fig. 3) Instead, he mobilized thousands of indigenous irregulars, moradores, and arraiais. The glorifying versions of his governorship perceived this circumstance as evidence of an intelligent manoeuvring of indigenous divisions, as well as an artful economic expedient for saving Lisbon the costs of sending expeditionary armies from Portugal. Some also tend to attribute to him the feat of the quasi-eradication of the indigenous traditional chiefdoms—a point, however, made impossible to sustain in the face of Celestino’s pragmatic politics, as explained below in Chapter 2. The recurrent taking of human heads by the arraiais in the course of pacification campaigns, a fact integral to primary historical documentation, has, therefore, not been overlooked in ideological readings. Colonial and anti-colonial scholars have brought forward contrasting ideological interpretations of the involvement of indigenous headhunters in\n\n30 Encounters with Parasites\n\nFigure 3 Portuguese army sergeants in East Timor, c. 1895. CMS/CMLC, Ref. 107 Fot/1998. Photographer unknown. Reproduced with permission of CMS/CMLC.\n\ncolonial pacification campaigns. These have either been sympathetically justified or fervently denounced. Reasons of tactical and economic nature could be advanced: arraiais were cheap armed forces and skilled warriors in the mountains.49 Later commentators could echo the contemporary pragmatic arguments for justifying the activity of the arraiais in the campaigns:50 ‘Back then and in those barbaric lands, where we [Portuguese] resorted to the natives for our conduct of the war’, captain Felgas wrote in his referential Timor Português of 1956, ‘native customs could but be respected; otherwise the loyal arraiais would desert.’51 The ideology of luso-tropicalismo (lusotropicalism), which portrayed Portuguese colonialism as essentially based on cultural tolerance and racial mixture, has provided compatible, yet different, justificatory explanations.52 Initially advanced by the Brazilian anthropologist Gilberto Freyre to account for the uniqueness of Portuguese colonial culture, luso-tropicalismo was willingly appropriated as official imperial ideology by the Estado Novo regime in the mid-twentieth century. According to the ‘luso-tropical’ perspective, the military participation of the Timorese has been seen as a proof of the benevolence of Portuguese colonialism, an expression of indigenous spiritual communion with Portugal caused by an age-old colonial policy of tolerance devoid of racial prejudice. Conversely, an inflamed anti-colonial historian has read the same fact as an instance\n\nParasitism in Colonial Interactions\n\n31\n\nof the weakness, mediocrity, and backwardness of the Portuguese colonial state. However, even this critical interpretation puzzlingly surrenders to the efficacy of Celestino’s methods of conquest. Unlike any other Portuguese colony, the pace and violence of Timor’s ‘pacification through decapitation’, this historian writes, was largely perpetuated by the Timorese themselves, with the complicity of the Portuguese.53 This complicity, however, has to be understood in the longer historical context. Similar colonial interactions are recorded for earlier periods. Celestino’s pacification follows about 250 years of close Portuguese–Timorese interactions in the island, which needs to be considered. Late nineteenthcentury imperialist language notwithstanding, recording signs of violence in military reports was not confined to the campaign reports of the 1890s. From the early eighteenth century it appears in Portuguese war accounts.54 The same holds true for the involvement of arraiais. Ritual violence in service of the colonial government was dramatically displayed during nineteenthcentury warfare but it had probably happened ever since the arraiais fought side by side with the Portuguese. Whenever conflicts arose in Timor, noted Luna de Oliveira, the Portuguese complied with the superstitions and ritual ‘bellicosity of the loyal tribes’ in order to keep possession of the island: ‘And it was always like that, since the era of 1500 to the civilized twentieth century’.55 (Fig. 4) The foundational moments of the Portuguese establishment in Timor, in fact, point to the persistence of a kind of reciprocally convenient association. When the Portuguese ventured into West Timor, they famously reduced the mighty potentate of Wehale to ashes in 1641–42, by siding with the armies of the Queen of Mena, recently converted to Christianity.56 Early Timorese willingness to convert to Christianity in the aftermath of colonial victories can be interpreted as an attempt to seek association with the military force of the Portuguese. In this respect, it is not coincidental that the Dominican friars repeatedly directly intervened in local wars, either against Timorese adversaries or the Dutch. Wars conducted in the East since the re-foundation of Portuguese rule in Dili in 1769, by means of a ‘contract’ with the Motael kingdom owning Dili’s lands, displayed similar patterns over the long term. Pacification in the 1890s reveals continuities in the form of a long-standing complicity between Portuguese and Timorese. Rather than marking a rupture, pacification campaigns perhaps constituted a moment of intensification of prior, older, forms of colonial contact, creatively reconfigured and amplified. The interactions involved in the Dato-Tolo episode call for a broader conceptualization of Portuguese colonialism in Timor. It might be specific to the Portuguese pacification period that it did not break with either pre-existing colonial or indigenous structures of warfare; instead, it gave them a new impetus for making ‘modern’ colonial occupation possible. However, colonial relationships in Timor are unlikely to represent a characteristic, as it\n\n32 Encounters with Parasites\n\nFigure 4 East Timorese warrior, c. 1900.

Conceptualizing Timor’s colonial entanglements can have wider implications for comparative colonial history. Historical evidence points to the occurrence of similar relationships with indigenous ‘barbaric’ practices in other colonial situations. Historians accept the inclusion of indigenous fighters (namely from ‘tribes’ renowned for the wildness and bravery of their fighting style) in imperial armies as a common trait of European colonial conquest, particularly in their heyday of late nineteenthcentury expansionism.57 In West Timor, for instance, from the seventeenth century to at least the ‘pacification’ of 1905–06, Dutch colonizers mobilized\n\nParasitism in Colonial Interactions\n\n33\n\nheadhunters in conflicts with local adversaries. The Dutch and their Timorese allies in the West got as much mutual benefit from ritual violence in colonial warfare as their counterparts in East Timor.58 Elsewhere, and in other historical contexts, indigenous warriors siding with colonial armies had been passively or actively encouraged by Europeans to practice ritual forms of violence—when not the European military themselves actually participated in mimicking the ‘savage’ doings of their allies: for example, North American Indian scalping in the Seven Years’ War;59 Iban headhunting in the British anti-piracy campaigns in early nineteenth-century Southeast Asia;60 and Ilongot headhunting in the American pacification campaigns in the Philippines, in the 1900s.61 Evidence for the intimacy of European colonizers with indigenous customs, particularly ceremonial violence, abounds in the historical record. Yet, their complexity has not received adequate attention, in spite of a recent interest in colonial hybridity. Deconstrutivist literary studies and post-colonial theory have recycled nineteenth-century notions of ‘hybridity’, ‘creolization’, and ‘miscegenation’ in an attempt to go beyond the limitations of antagonistic vocabularies in colonial discourse.62 Colonialism in these perspectives is not so much about the creation of purified divides, but the generation of hybridizations or amalgamations of distinct cultures, languages, or races—the merging of different entities into ambivalent constitutions.63 Hybridity questions the depiction of colonialism as domination, and is advanced as an instrument of intellectual criticism. Homi Bhabha, for instance, has argued influentially that European dominance is undermined by the ambivalences generated by colonial language itself; hybrids within texts (and subsequently within colonialism) weaken, and ultimately destroy, the authority of colonial power.64 These critiques have began to disturb oppositional idioms and Western dualisms, notwithstanding their methodologica"
