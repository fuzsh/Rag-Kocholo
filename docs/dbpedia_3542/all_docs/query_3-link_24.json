        "text": "Someone once remarked to me at a social function how wonderful it was that we were having so much by way of art, music, poetry, literature, sport, and culture in general, such a lot of it that one was at a loss for choice. And she was right, of course.\n\nBut the phrase “bread and circuses” did come to mind as well. “Bread and circuses” (from the Latin ‘panis et circenses’) is a figure of speech which in politics has come to mean “the generation of public approval, not through exemplary or excellent public service or public policy, but through diversion, distraction or mere satisfaction of the immediate, shallow requirements of a populace.”\n\nThe term was coined by the satirical Roman poet Decimus Iunius Iuvenalis, better known as Juvenal (active in the late 1st and early 2nd century AD), in reference to the ploy of providing free wheat and costly, blood-and-gore circus games and other forms of popular entertainment as a means of gaining and holding on to political power. It is a distracting device that has been successfully employed through history: it has been said of the Portuguese dictator António de Oliveira Salazar that he diverted the minds of his population from his excesses by offering them “football, fado and Fátima.”\n\nThere is nothing ‘shallow’ about the arts, music or sport of course, but when we get a barrage of festival after festival, quite a few of exceptionally high quality, but do not get the governance and comprehensive planning and delivery of basic amenities to our populace, the discrepancy is glaringly evident.\n\nThis is obvious to even a short-term visitor to our state. We had over a hundred delegates from eleven countries descend upon Goa for the recently-concluded ABCD (Asset-Based Community Development) festival, at which I was invited to deliver the keynote address. While all of them were awestruck by Goa’s natural, built and intangible heritage, even during their short stay here they came face-to-face with issues that bedevil residents all the time: garbage disposal, sanitation, noise pollution, parking problems, a poor public transport system, exorbitant taxi fares and the lack of a basic airport bus shuttle transfer system in what despite everything is still India’s hottest and most iconic tourist destination.\n\nThe whole ethos of the global ABCD movement is one of “strengths-focussed, place-based and community-driven development”, the “power of communities, neighbourhoods and residents focussing on their assets, capacities and opportunities, as opposed to their needs, deficiencies and limitations.” I must admit that this definition flummoxed me when I first encountered it. Whenever I think of community-driven development for Goa, I can’t help thinking first of what I perceive to be our basic needs, and what is lacking in our day-to-day living (and we have enumerated just a few already above).\n\nSo let’s look holistically at assets, capacities and opportunities and at our strengths, the USP (unique selling point) of Goa and our communities. If we are truly honest with ourselves, we have to admit we have taken a wrong turn in our vision for the future. Our USP is our natural beauty, our unique position in history and our intangible heritage of art, music, dance and culture. It is the reason that the plethora of festivals, conventions, workshops, symposiums etc are held in Goa in the first place. It is this that we should safeguard zealously and jealously, instead of trying to mimic vacuous templates like Las Vegas.\n\nThe development should be holistic, inclusive, and should maintain our sensitive ecological balance. The pride we have for our land should be instilled and shared by all of us, not just a few communities, societal layers or enclaves.\n\nGoa is poised at a crossroad like never before. If we choose the right path, we could become such an exemplar for the rest of the country (a true ‘Goa model’) and indeed the India-Pacific region. But if we choose our status quo, generations after us will hold us accountable for aiding and abetting Goa’s decline through complacency.\n\nWhich brings us to the opportunities we have before us. The looming election can be a watershed moment in our history if we collectively vote for true, clean, honest, positive, wholesome change. It is a change Goa sorely needs. It is a change that ought to have come so much earlier. But better late than never.\n\nIt is time to rethink the image of ‘brand Goa’ we are putting out into the ether, be it for tourism or in the more general sense. Goa is already taking centre-stage as a hub for the arts, literature, music, dance, and creativity in general, and for sport. But if we have a government that fails to deliver on basics, and that fails to protect what is still left of our natural heritage, this will by default be reduced to just ‘bread and circuses.’\n\n(An edited version of this article was published on 29 January 2017 in my weekend column ‘On the Upbeat’ in the Panorama section of the Navhind Times Goa India)\n\nUS-trained Goan-origin pianist Evelyn Dias was recently in the city for a recital and spoke to the Navhind Times about her roots, musical upbringing, and her work as performer and teacher.\n\n1. Tell us a little about your Goan roots\n\nMy mum’s side of the family came from Anjuna and my dad’s side from Panjim. My aunt and uncle, who are both siblings of my parents, still live in Goa. My sisters and I visited Goa many times as children. I remember seeing the large living room of the family house for the first time. I was so impressed! I have many fond memories of picking green mangoes and cashew fruit up the hill in Anjuna. Even now when I return to Goa, I feel a sense of belonging that I have never felt anywhere in the world.\n\n2. How did you get started on piano? How old were you?\n\nThe first piano in our house was a wedding gift to my parents. I wanted to play it for as long as I can remember. My sisters (who are a little older than I am) had lessons and I couldn’t wait for my turn. Although I wanted to start earlier, I finally began music lessons at the age of 6. My dad was a big influence. He often played his classical music LPs at home. He was also a violinist and a member of both the Cantata choir as well as the Paranjoti chorus. Going to his concerts at the N.C.P.A. and other venues across the city was something l looked forward to. Without doubt these experiences inspired my love of music.\n\n3. Tell us a little more about your career path. How and when did you decide to go to the US?\n\nI studied Economics and Statistics in Mumbai but realized quickly that those subjects didn’t make me happy. Since my sisters had already left the country, I wanted to stay behind with my parents. Eventually though it became clear that I was denying my dream of being a professional musician.\n\nI still remember my first day in music school in the U.S. in August 2001. It was a theory class of 80 students and I was the happiest one there!\n\nI consider myself fortunate to have had wonderful teachers at both the University of Iowa and Northwestern University. An “invested” teacher can make a huge difference. In addition exposure to great musical performances is vital to the growth of a musician. Completing my doctorate in the Chicago area was an excellent experience. I took advantage of affordable student tickets and am lucky to have seen/heard many of my musical heroes in concert.\n\n4. Having returned to India, what is your impression of the music ‘scene’ here?\n\nUpon my return to India, I have been delighted to observe many more musical activities and opportunities than were available to me when I was a student. From the increased number of visiting artists to the growth of music schools and programs, music students today have much more access than ever before. In addition the vast amount of recordings, scores and information available on the internet can supplement learning. It is my hope that curiosity for information and initiative to keep improving standards continues.\n\n5. Describe your experiences of playing here in Goa.\n\nI have enjoyed coming back to Goa to perform. The concert with Madeleine Mitchell was my third opportunity to play here. In addition to meeting wonderful people, these concerts have allowed me to explore parts of Goa that I have never seen before.\n\n6. You’ve had an insight into the current situation regarding teaching at Child’s Play. You’ll agree there’s a lot of potential on so many levels? Tell us about the experience.\n\nThe highlight of my recent trip to Goa was a meeting with the teachers and students of Child’s Play. I attended a few lessons/classes and was really moved by the experience. I witnessed dedication and investment from the teachers and the joy that music brings to the students. The impact of music in the lives of both students and teachers is undeniable especially in the case of students who come from challenging backgrounds. I thoroughly believe that music/training should be for everyone and not an elite few. I hope to return to Goa to work with Child’s Play in the months ahead.\n\n7. Lastly any advice: for the music student in general, the piano student in particular, to music teachers, and to parents and the wider public. What can we all do to take India further along the path where music education and the flourishing of music in general are concerned?\n\nI would encourage students and teachers of music to avail of every possible opportunity to perform, to go to concerts and to refine their craft. Even if they don’t intend to make music a career, there are so many benefits to studying/playing music. Recent research has proven the positive effects of music-making and listening on our brains. Parents play a vital role in supporting young musicians – taking them to lessons, concerts and ensuring consistent and thoughtful practice. Although the process is long and sometimes difficult, every professional musician knows that the learning never stops!\n\n(An edited version of this article appeared in the Buzz section of the Navhind Times on 25 January 2017)\n\nThe Serendipity Arts Festival (SAF) is something everyone is talking about ever since it made its dramatic appearance on Goa’s cultural calendar last month.\n\nIt was so wonderful to find the beautiful heritage Secretariat building come to sparkling life after decades of stagnation and disuse. It was as if an evil spell in some fairy-tale had at long last been broken.\n\nWe hope that this is the beginning of a fresh new lease of life for the iconic building. It was an exhilarating feeling, walking along former corridors and balconies of political power to find them repurposed as glorious celebrations of art, history and heritage.\n\nWhat with the preparations for our Child’s Play Christmas concert, and being laid up with the flu the week after, and having to dash to Mumbai to the Royal Flemish Philharmonic concerts at the NCPA, I missed the publicity and buzz before the SAF, and most of the festival itself. It was through a chance meeting with my friend Jack Sukhija that I learnt of the exhibition of paintings in Campal by iconic masters of Indian Modern Art curated from the collection of DAG (Delhi Art Gallery) Modern, as part of the festival.\n\nI managed to catch the last two days of the exhibition, and kept returning to it, almost in disbelief that there could be works by so many famous Indian painters all at once, and so flatteringly displayed, right here, in the heart of my hometown. I fervently hope that if SAF becomes an annual affair, that the DAG Modern returns along with them as well.\n\nIt was a joyous homecoming for so many of the paintings of Goan masters Francis Newton Souza and Laxman Pai. It is a crying shame that their homeland doesn’t have a dedicated space with more of their work, and of their Goan contemporaries prominently and appropriately displayed.\n\nFrancis Newton Souza\n\nLaxman Pai\n\nAt my last visit to Mumbai, I was able to duck into the Chhatrapati Shivaji Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSVS) (formerly the Prince of Wales Museum of Western India) and spend a day there before the evening concert. I came across a few paintings by another Goan icon, Vasudeo S. Gaitonde in the Jehangir Nicholson gallery there, as part of a wider exhibition ‘The Infinite Project’, showcasing the work of Laxman Shreshtha. Although the museum does a great job of displaying the art, on repeated visits there, I have found the care-a-damn attitude of the staff really disturbing, in the way they chatter loudly among themselves or into their phones, paying no heed to visitors who wish to take in the exhibits in silence. This is all too often the case at the Goa State Museum as well. So the experience at the DAG Modern exhibition at Campal was a refreshing contrast to this.\n\nAt the CSVS Mumbai, I revisited “The Adoration of the Magi” attributed to Italian master Bonifazio Veronese (1487-1553), in the Sir Dorabji J. Tata Collection, and thought it would be appropriate to highlight it in this column, two days after the feast of the Epiphany.\n\nBut on returning to Goa and seeing the section of the DAG Modern devoted to Christian art, I was struck by a painting on the same subject by Bengali artist Jamini Roy (1887-1972). Although untitled, the work was described as “Madonna and Jesus with the Magi”.\n\nThe contrast between the two paintings I had seen on the same subject in two cities within the space of a day could not be more striking.\n\nVeronese and Roy are separated from each other by a vast gulf of time (four centuries) and space. The scale of the Veronese work dwarfs the Roy hugely. Veronese uses oil on canvas, while Roy’s painting uses tempera on box board pasted on masonite board.\n\nAnd when it comes to the treatment of the subject, I couldn’t help remembering Orhan Pamuk’s ‘My Name is Red’, the tension created in the art world by the contact between East and West, and the completely different frames of reference in the Eastern and Western schools of art.\n\nVeronese celebrates perspective, depth, chiaroscuro, foreground and background, detail and realism. Jamini Roy’s earthy style makes a break not only from Western tradition but from the Bengal School of Art as well, and draws inspiration from the Kalighat Pat, folk and tribal styles instead.\n\nThe Madonna and Child seems to have been a theme Roy returned to again and again, and there was one other such example on display in the exhibition as well, which although unmistakably Indian in style, still uses the Western format adopted by the Great Masters in the way the Mother holds the Child against her right shoulder.\n\nSo in Roy’s Adoration of the Magi, the Madonna and Child are featured, but Joseph does not. Also scale and proportion are less important than symbolism. Madonna And Child occupy the top centre of the painting, at the centre of what seems almost like a baandhini tie-and-dye circular decoration mounted atop a thin tapering pedestal upon a narrow base. Just two of the three Magi look solemnly unsmilingly at us on either side. They have matching crowns (just a horizontal brush-stroke of white paint, with little dabs above them as spartan embellishments) but different garb, although their stance is identical, almost as if they are standing guard for the Mother and Child, ready to draw their swords at any moment. They are larger, so perhaps they are meant to be in the ‘foreground’? But unlike most depictions, where they are turned towards the baby in adoration, here they direct their gaze at us instead.\n\nThe baby Jesus is given a different hue from the rest of the characters in the painting. This is something Roy seems to do in other depictions of the Madonna and Child as well when using the Kalighat pat style. When I pointed out the absence of Joseph and the third King to a young friend, he quipped “Maybe they ‘took’ the picture and the rest posed for it!” Today’s generation think only of photos and selfies.\n\nIn Goa, we are lucky of course to have the paintings of the son of the soil who revolutionised Christian iconography: Angelo da Fonseca. I remember the exhibition of his work at the Xavier Centre for Historical Research Porvorim a few Christmases ago. I don’t recall if Fonseca painted his own version of the Epiphany. It is time for me to pay his paintings another visit.\n\n(An edited version of this article was published on 8 January 2017 in my weekend column ‘On the Upbeat’ in the Panorama section of the Navhind Times Goa India)\n\nMany of you must have attended Talatum, the circus adaptation of Shakespeare’s tragicomedy The Tempest. This is the fascinating thing about Shakespeare; four centuries later, his plays still provide creative inspiration in the most unexpected ways.\n\nHaving been away from Goa for most of the Serendipity Arts festival, I must confess I didn’t have much of an idea about this production before going to see it, almost directly from the airport. So everything about it, from its staging in a big top tent, to the acrobatics, the sound-and-light show (the actual tempest was really spectacularly depicted) took me quite by surprise.\n\nThis quatercentenary of Shakespeare’s birth has prompted me to delve into his plays more deeply through the year, so I was familiar with the broad outline of The Tempest, aided, I must admit, by the illustrated retelling for children that lies on my son’s bookshelf. He was able to follow the storyline as it unfolded far better than me.\n\nAmazing as the acrobatic displays were, I still felt there could have been more use of the text in the production. Upon returning home, I read the description which was almost a disclaimer: “The text for this production aims to transcend the barriers of language through minimal multi-lingual dialogue and pure visual expression.” Fair enough. But a little more of the Bard’s lines would have enhanced my enjoyment of the play. The microphone failed a few times, and sometimes Prospero’s accent in particular was a little difficult to follow. But I did catch a few lines, and they were like a lifeline, notably “We are such stuff / As dreams are made on.” Something about the surreal setting and the way the words floated into our consciousness called to mind the 1980s Eurhythmics smash hit “Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)”which I am quite sure was not Tempest-inspired.\n\nThere is a connection, albeit a tenuous one, with the New Year. In a critical essay about the play titled “The Day of The Tempest”, John B. Bender discusses the significance of the date the play was first performed in court, 1 November 1611. We know 1 November as All Saints’ Day, of course, but in Shakespeare’s time, it had even more significance than in our times, and was known as Hallowmas: “Hallowmas itself became a solemn day for praising all of the saints –tangible presentments of God’s presence on earth – and for anticipating the Last Judgment. It figures forth a sense of last chances, a sense of endings, for it was the time of the ancient Celtic New Year.”\n\nI learnt later that Talaatum is the Urdu for sea-storm, and for upheaval. And whether we like it or not, following 8 November, the topic of discussion and the subject on everyone’s mind has been the currency crisis and the stress it has caused to people’s lives. I’m terrible for example at remembering PIN numbers for credit cards, and I often mix them up, sometimes to my embarrassment in public places. And the shortage of cash has meant that I am compelled to use the credit card more often. But I know I’m more fortunate than most; so many people I meet every day: posrekars, nustekanns, bhajiwallas, rickshaw-drivers, have had, and are still having it much much worse. They need cash on a daily basis to meet their living expenses and keep their businesses going. These are not terrorists or black marketeers or anti-nationals, but they, like millions of honest hard-working people all over India, have been hit the hardest by this obviously not-fully-thought-through demonetisation caper. Those who sniff at their suffering as “a minor inconvenience” and “media hype” from the comfort of their ivory towers should step down from them and just walk around the block and a few bylanes, talking to strangers they meet to learn the truth.\n\nAt Talatum, we were compelled to pay by credit card, as there was a change shortage. And sitting in one of the tiers of the big top amphitheatre, I was taken back to the circuses we went to in our childhood. And it struck me that the upheaval of the last two months is also A Great Indian Circus.\n\nClowns, jokers, jesters and buffoons a-plenty. Jugglers and acrobats and sleight-of-hand too. Now you see your own hard-earned money, now you don’t. Suddenly overnight it’s not worth the paper it’s printed on. What was white is black, then white, black and then white again. You have to account for every last rupee and paisa in your wallet and bank account but political parties don’t have to account for anything. ‘Ordinary’ families have to budget family weddings to fit within 2.5 lakhs (and a very good thing too!) and furnish valid proof of said wedding, but ‘extra-ordinary’ people (politicians, businessmen) can spend 550 crores and everyone whistles and looks the other way. Abracadabra! What ought to be a newsworthy scandal is air-brushed, turned into thin air. China is the enemy for other boycotts, but not for PayTm, whose single largest shareholder is Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.\n\nAn unprecedented source of hardship in our nation’s history to millions of its people is actually touted as a major triumph. “Wait and see”, we are paternalistically told, as if the electorate has less intelligence than the ruling political class.\n\nRidiculous medical analogies, to chemotherapy, to radical oncological surgery and labour pains are made, with the common underlying mantra that “you may suffer now, but it’ll be worth it in the end”. For whom is the question. Certainly for everyone invested in the banking industry and digitisation of money; for the rest of us the payoff is far from clear.\n\nDemocracy itself has become The Great Indian Circus. We wake up one morning to find ourselves forced to queue up to see a production of a Tempest that we didn’t ask to see, and are not enjoying so much. But if we protest, it is further proof of our lack of patriotism. Somehow the conjuror’s trick (or is it a confidence trick?) can neatly tie in the actual War on Cash to a supposed War on Black Money, Terrorism and Tax Evasion.\n\nBut will the evil triumvirate really vanish with the War on Cash? “Wait and See”. If one political analyst in a section of the press is to be believed, there will be no electoral backlash to this demonetisation (as civic municipal elections seem to indicate up north) because the Indian electorate historically votes along religious, caste and other fractious lines, no matter what suffering is dished out to them.\n\nThis is why empty displays of patriotism (standing to attention in cinemas for the national anthem) mean nothing as long as there is no empathy from the politicians for the people, the rich for the poor, the haves for the have-nots, the majority for the minority and the disadvantaged and vulnerable, and men for women.\n\nBut hope springs eternal, so let us enter the New Year with some optimism, however contrived it might feel right now.\n\n(An edited version of this article was published on 1 January 2017 in my weekend column ‘On the Upbeat’ in the Panorama section of the Navhind Times Goa India)"
