COVID-19 IN THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR Notes Select Bibliography Photographic Inserts Index About the Book About the Author Copyright\n\nAuthor’s Note\n\nbook is the outcome of serendipity and timeliness to address T his the loss of memory about past pandemics, written while we were in the middle of one. In writing it, I offer two core arguments. First, the cholera, plague and influenza pandemics between 1817 and 1920 need to be placed firmly in the global historiography of this period, currently dominated by themes such as nationalism, imperialism, capitalism or globalization. Second, I argue that the Age of Pandemics has been forgotten in the country most affected by it—India—and that there is value in remembering it as a major event just as the ‘Black Death’ plague pandemic of the fourteenth century is registered in European consciousness to this day. This is important because building such collective memory is useful to counter current and future pandemics. My approach is partly inspired from the field of demographic history. My interest in this subject began by reading the pioneering work of Tim Dyson, whom I have never met, but with whom I have had the good fortune of interacting over email in recent years. I also learnt a lot from the work of researchers who have devoted large parts of their careers to understand the history of epidemics and health in India—Ira Klein, David Arnold, Mark Harrison, Ian Catanach, Mridula Ramanna and many others. I would particularly like to thank Maura Chhun for promptly sharing her doctoral research on Influenza in India and other relevant resources. Remote research during a lockdown was possible only because of excellent digital archives maintained by the Wellcome Collection, National Library of Scotland (Medical History of British India), the Edinburgh Research Archive, the Visual Plague Project at the University of Cambridge, Archive.org, ProQuest Times of India Digital Database, South Asia Archives and Ideas of India Archive. The pictures from the Wellcome Collection are courtesy of the\n\nCreative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial license (CC BYNC 4.0). The book also benefited from excellent research assistance provided by Aasha Eapen and Mrinal Tomar. While writing, I have used the old and new names of places interchangeably. The statistical analysis is provided in a separate document, available online, and mentioned in the Notes section. I would like to thank Yogesh Kalkonde for sharing an important oral history he collected in Gadchiroli district in central India on the 1918 pandemic. To him and Ambarish Satwik, I owe a debt of gratitude for taking out time from their busy hospital schedules in the middle of a pandemic to provide feedback on the draft chapters. I also benefited from detailed comments by Tirthankar Roy and Maura Chhun. Many others have contributed in different ways: Ravi Abhyankar, Sanghamitra Chatterjee, Lucy Taksa, Patrick French, Jeemol Unni, Amol Agrawal, Aparajith Ramnath, Aashish Gupta, Basav Biradar, C.J. Kuncheria, Yunus Lasania, Y.B. Satyanarayana, Aanchal Malhotra, Abhi Sanghani, Sudev Sheth, Amrita Roy, Sandeep Badole, Ankur Sarin, Jeevant Rampal and Sukanya Basu. Presentations in the CASI-UPenn and EHDR webinar series and discussions with Ed Glaeser and his Dev-Urban group prompted great feedback. Swati Chopra encouraged and edited, motivated and manoeuvred this book with infectious enthusiasm, as did the wonderful team at Harper Collins. I thank Gavin Morris and Bonita Shimray for designing the cover, and Chandna Arora for her work on the copy edits. Friends and family chipped in from time to time with little known nuggets. During the lockdown, my father, Vasudev Tumbe, eased into retirement and reading, and my mother, Sudha Huzurbazar Tumbe, into prolific writing. Both of their newly acquired skills were valuable in improving this book. My wife, Divya, survived the lockdown with plants, wit, humour and her own wonderful writing, all of which added to this project, as did my son, Siddhartha, who prompted the first spark. Good architecture provides a stimulus to thinking, or so I feel after writing this book in Louis Kahn’s awe-inspiring red-brick campus of the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad. The\n\ntallest point among those red bricks is the Vikram Sarabhai Library, whose staff provided outstanding support for my research, locating rare material through their global inter-library ties. This remarkable effort was due to the leadership of Dr H. Anil Kumar, librarian, colleague and friend. His untimely death on 17 July 2020, the day he turned fifty-three, was a personal loss for many of us and brought home the painful reality of the pandemic. We miss you, Anil. This book, sitting on library shelves and elsewhere, is dedicated to you and your passion for books and libraries, both of which make this world a more beautiful place.\n\n‘Were there pandemics in the past as well?’ asked Siddhartha, my eight-year-old son. I paused nervously, registering the fact that the word ‘pandemic’ had entered his vocabulary at such a young age. ‘Well, there was something known as influenza …,’ I began. But before I could complete, he pulled out Tintin and the Picaros from his prized collection and opened page sixteen of the Egmont edition. Sure enough, a villainous army officer on that page laments the cancellation of Tintin’s trip due to influenza in Europe. Taken aback by the effortlessness with which he had spotted a word that I had assumed he would never know, I said nothing further, until he pressed on, and asked me, ‘Go on, tell me more.’\n\nA Timeline of the Age of Pandemics, 1817–1920\n\n1817 Onset of Cholera Pandemic 1866 Third International Sanitary Conference held in Constantinople (Istanbul) (First two conferences were held in Paris in 1851 and 1859) 1894 Third Plague Pandemic (Onset of first two being the sixth century CE and the fourteenth century CE) 1918 Influenza Pandemic (Milder prior outbreak in 1889) Death toll estimates in millions\n\n1 Pandemics of the Past\n\n‘Our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them’ – Mary Evans/George Eliot1 upon a time, we barely lived before we died. We would O nce celebrate on average only twenty-five birthdays in our lifetimes and we rarely grew old enough to see our grandchildren. Mass mortality through war, famine, natural disasters and epidemics was a way of life. We began to live longer only when we fought fewer wars, understood how to prevent famines, grew resilient to natural disasters, and learnt how to control the spread of disease. Different parts of the world began their journeys out of mass mortality at different times. In India, this journey began in 1920.2 Between 1920 and 2020, death rates in India fell consistently from forty-five deaths per thousand people to seven deaths per thousand people. At birth, Indians can now expect to celebrate on average nearly seventy birthdays instead of only twenty-five, the norm before 1920.3 It is an incredible achievement that stands in stark contrast to the remarkable century that preceded it. Between 1817 and 1920, over 70 million people in the world died from pandemics, a figure far greater than the number of people killed by wars.4 These pandemics were principally of three diseases —cholera, the plague and influenza—and India was at the epicentre of this mortality crisis, where over 40 million people perished.5 Never heard about this? Perhaps it is because we had collectively\n\nforgotten about pandemics till the words ‘COVID-19’, ‘lockdown’ and ‘social distancing’ came into our consciousness.\n\nEpidemics and Pandemics One of the fundamental laws of mortality in the past century has been that over time, and especially as we get richer, we tend to die in smaller proportions from ‘communicable’ diseases.6 In the US, the share of such diseases has fallen to under 10 per cent today and in India, it has fallen to less than 30 per cent.7 The list of such communicable diseases is long and even seasoned medical practitioners routinely consult their books for diagnosis. Malaria has been the deadliest communicable disease in history, transmitted to humankind through female Anopheles mosquitoes, for several millennia.8 Those mosquito bites that you feel on your hands, those desperate claps to kill the buzzing irritation you hear, those stagnant water pools you see and smell with great dismay, provide a fulsome sensory experience even before getting the disease. I have vivid memories of open-air musical performances in my boarding school held in the evenings, less for the music and more for the organized mosquito-killing sprees we conducted through whispers and silent claps, with the sole objective of saving our hands and legs. We spared no singer, male or female, young or old, Hindustani or Carnatic; our attention was unabashedly directed towards the mosquitoes because the music, evidently, did not kill them. If those mosquitoes successfully inject malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites into your bloodstream, then, depending on the level of your immunity, you could expect the first symptoms, common to many diseases—fevers, chills and headaches. Death by malaria was exceedingly common until the early twentieth century in much of the tropical world, and in places like India it formed the single most common cause of death. However, medical developments in the twentieth century drastically curtailed fatality rates. Today, around half the world is still at risk of getting malaria, around 230 million cases occur every year, but there are only\n\n500,000 deaths worldwide, which is equivalent to what a small province of India would suffer annually in the nineteenth century.9 The medical knowledge of malaria and its transmission evolved over centuries, and several malarial epidemics have been noted at various times, but few would consider malaria to be a pandemic, even though it has affected many countries at the same time. What then distinguishes a disease from an epidemic, and an epidemic from a pandemic, or equivalently, for animals, an epizootic from a panzootic? For a disease to become an epidemic, it must suddenly affect many members of a community at the same time. Time, that is, simultaneity, matters more than space, or geographic coverage. Simultaneity is often matched with seasonality, as many of us realize during our visits to the doctor’s clinic when the seasons change. When that happens periodically and is localized, those diseases are considered to be endemic to the region. An endemic disease may or may not turn epidemic in a given year depending on the rate of transmission between human beings or that between vectors, like mosquitoes, and humans. Thus, while malaria is endemic in many parts of the world, it can quickly turn into an epidemic if disturbed environmental conditions in a year or in a particular time period lead to stagnant pools of water suitable for mosquito breeding. But for an epidemic to become a pandemic, both time and space are equally important, that is, the disease has to spread across a sufficiently wide geographical region to be declared a pandemic. What constitutes as ‘wide’ has typically been a judgement call involving either countries or continents as the regional units. The use of the word ‘pandemic’ picked up only in the twentieth century; major outbreaks of diseases in the nineteenth century were routinely referred to as epidemics by observers of that time even though historians have now classified them as pandemics. An Englishlanguage dictionary in 1775 defined ‘pandemic’ as an adjective derived from Greek that meant ‘incident to a whole people’.10 The word was rarely used in the way it is used today, and ‘pandemic love’ was a phrase used to describe forms of vulgar love.11 The corresponding word for pandemic in parts of north India,\n\nmahamaari, was used in the nineteenth century, though the word maari (referring to epidemics) was more in vogue.12 An early reference to the English word ‘pandemic’ in the medical sense was used, ironically, to disprove the existence of one in the context of an attack on quarantines and lockdowns. Benjamin Moseley (1742–1819), a physician and the author of A Treatise on Tropical Diseases, wrote the following in a chapter on the plague in a treatise on sugar in 1800: ‘I never could discover that fevers are propagated by contagion. Were it possible so to be, I should have been long since dead. Quarantine, always expensive to commerce, and often ruinous to individuals, is a reflexion on the good sense of countries. No pestilential, or pandemic fever, was ever imported, or exported; and I have always considered the fumigating ship-letters, and shutting up the crews and passengers of vessels, on their arrival from foreign places, several weeks, for fear they should give diseases to others, which they have not themselves- as an ignorant, barbarous custom.’13 (Emphasis added) Many economists today would concur with this rare economic assessment undertaken by an epidemiologist but they would also disagree with his sense of epidemiology. It is worth pointing out that when Moseley wrote his book in 1800, it was possible to deny the existence of contagious diseases and abuse quarantines. Moseley would have found it hard to maintain such a position a century later. This is because the transmission of diseases across wide areas intensified in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries through revolutions in the means of transport and communication, making the word ‘pandemic’ more frequent in medical circles. A recent dictionary of epidemiology defines it as ‘an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people’.14 The key theme is ‘simultaneous worldwide transmission’, not severity,\n\nand pandemics are declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in anticipation of severity.15 Malaria, therefore, is unlikely to become a pandemic, even though it affects many people in many countries, because there is little evidence of transmission of the disease from one place to another and the affected regions are usually those where malaria is endemic. Unsurprisingly, diseases that can be transmitted directly from one human to another tend to spread more rapidly than vectorborne diseases such as malaria and are more likely to become pandemics. Influenza, better known as the ‘flu’, is the classic contagious disease that exhibits seasonality but can also easily turn into a pandemic. Dropping severity from the definition, however, puts the spotlight on WHO when pandemics are declared. In 2009, the H1N1 influenza pandemic was declared as such by WHO, but eventually it turned out to be as mild as the seasonal flu.16 The declaration of the pandemic was then questioned, as were the links between WHO advisors and pharmaceutical industries which stood to benefit from vaccination orders.17 Whether to declare a pandemic or not is therefore not as simple as it may appear, as it is closely tied with international relations, trade and business. From a historical viewpoint, though, pandemics are inextricably linked with the notion of severity because in the absence of global data collection systems, mild pandemics would never be recorded. What we observe across the centuries are instances in which one or two or several continents were simultaneously affected by the same disease through some means of transmission, due to which mortality increased substantially. Before the late fifteenth century, ‘worldwide’ disease transmission was almost impossible to establish as the knowledge of the American worlds was practically unknown to the others and vice versa. Our consideration of pandemics in history therefore uses the simple definition of at least two continents being affected by mass mortality through the simultaneous transmission of a disease. Those pandemics left their marks not necessarily in statistical registries, but in literature, art and culture, on tombstones and even inside the occasional tomb.\n\nPandemics before 1817 If one looks hard enough, one can find the concern with disease and epidemics expressed in numerous texts, medical doctrines and holy scriptures from the ancient world. To quote one example, here are translated extracts from different sections of Kautilya’s Arthashastra, an ancient Indian treatise on statecraft compiled at least eighteen centuries ago: Calamities due to acts of God are fire, floods, diseases and epidemics and famine. Other calamities of divine origin are rats, wild animals, snakes and evil spirits. It is the duty of the king to protect the people from all these calamities. Whenever danger threatens, the king shall protect all those afflicted like a father and shall organize continuous prayers with oblations.18 But in ancient texts and holy scriptures, including in the Arthashastra, epidemics tended to receive less attention than war, natural disasters and famines, the other reasons for mass mortality. One explanation for this relative inattention could be a lack of dramatic impact. Death in epidemics often came silently, without the destruction of buildings, the plundering of cities, the devastation of earthquakes, the havoc of floods or the tragic desiccation of fields due to lack of rain. Epidemics might have been under-reported in history simply because they were not glamourous enough to be noted; those which were reported were epidemics that left clearly identifiable marks on the body. Among the few known epidemics that grew to become pandemics on account of affecting at least two continents simultaneously, one disease stands out prominently—the plague. If malaria and the mosquito are the historical torchbearers for epidemics, the plague and rats are those for pandemics. Historians have identified three clearly discernible episodes of pandemic plagues that started in the sixth, fourteenth and nineteenth centuries,\n\nrespectively. The evidence so far suggests that Europe was most affected in the first two plague pandemics while Asia was affected more in the third.19 All three are generally considered to be plagues of the bubonic variety, referring to the bubo or swollen lymph node caused by the disease, typically around the groin or armpits. This striking visual element of the disease has been useful for historians in identifying it, compared to other types of plague that can be septicaemic (involving blood clotting) or pneumonic (involving lung infections). Since the discovery of the plague-causing bacterium in 1894, medical knowledge about the plague has grown tremendously. We now know that it is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, named after Alexandre Yersin (1863–1943), a Swiss physician who made the discovery in Hong Kong, a key city affected in the third plague pandemic. The plague bacterium could well have been named Kitasato pestis as Yersin and Kitasato Shibasaburo (1853–1931), a Japanese physician, competed in a ‘rat race’, as it were, to discover the root cause of the plague. Yersin’s analysis was found to be more comprehensive, though Kitasato had published the results first.20 A theory soon developed of plague transmission from rats to rat fleas to humans via flea bites, though research has also suggested other rodents and animals as vectors, and that rodents themselves are not necessary for the transmission. While bubonic and septicaemic plagues generally spread through the rat-flea-human transmission path, pneumonic plague can spread through human-tohuman transmission via infection-laden droplets.\n\nThe first plague pandemic The first plague pandemic, recorded in the sixth century, is referred to as the ‘Justinianic’ plague. It occurred during the reign of Emperor Justinian I of the Byzantine Empire around 540–550 CE.21 The descriptions of the disease in those times suggest that it was bubonic. Procopius, a historian of that period, identified the trading centre of Pelusium in Egypt as the point of origin from where the disease spread to Alexandria, and further on to Palestine. A traveller’s record of that time mentions the depletion of the\n\npopulation of a town ‘with (only) seven men and one little boy ten years old remaining in it’.22 By 542 CE, the plague reached the capital city of Constantinople, and by one account, even managed to infect the emperor. The plague then moved to Italy and Spain, reaching as far as the British Isles. The demographic devastation in the Mediterranean world was stark, with records in multiple languages describing how thousands of people died in a single day or how, as per one traveller, corpses were ‘lying in the fields and along the roadside, and cattle wandering untended into the hills’.23 Here is Procopius on the inability to keep pace in digging new burial sites, a common theme in all lethal pandemics: [T]hose who were making these trenches, no longer able to keep up with the number of dying, mounted the towers of the fortifications in Sycae (Galata) and tearing off the roofs, threw the bodies in there in complete disorder.24 The plague did not immediately lead to the fall of the Byzantine Empire but the depopulation of rural and urban areas and the desertification of farmland is said to have created a fiscal crisis, with the emperor also lamenting the high wage expectations of the diminished workforce.25 A few decades later, there would be mutiny against a cut in military expenditure, a civil war and a Persian invasion. The global population in the sixth century has been placed at around 250 million and the largest mortality estimates of the first plague pandemic, hazy as they are, run into a few tens of millions, mostly in Europe.26 Thus, this pandemic may have killed around 10 per cent of human beings in the world at that time, though this figure would be higher for Europe, ranging from 25 to 50 per cent. Its impact on Asia, home to around 70 per cent of the global population at that time, is largely unknown. It is quite plausible, based on current evidence, that the impact was marginal.\n\nThe second plague pandemic\n\nThe plague reappeared sporadically over the next few centuries but came back with a vengeance in the fourteenth century. Between 1346 and 1353 CE, the second plague pandemic ravaged Europe, northern Africa and West Asia—an episode dubbed ‘Black Death’. The colour in this title refers to the colour of the bubo that the plague causes, though given the high mortality rate in Europe, ‘White Death’ would have been equally appropriate. It was also called the ‘Great Mortality’, ‘Great Pestilence’ and ‘Universal Plague’ by contemporaries.27 This plague pandemic has been better studied than the first and is said to have had consequences that are open to debate, such as laying the foundation for the rise of Europe, the Renaissance movement, the Protestant Reformation and even accelerating anti-Semitism. Not surprisingly, the history of pandemics has focussed disproportionately on this particular episode given its Eurocentricity and purported long-term consequences. Curiously enough, the source of this plague is attributed to East Asia, despite little evidence to that effect. In a classic study titled ‘Plagues and Peoples’ in 1976, William McNeill had argued that plague reservoirs in wild rodents existed in three key locations of the world: the Himalayan foothills between India and China, a region near the Great Lakes in central Africa and the Eurasian steppe region from central Asia to China.28 The second plague pandemic arose, in McNeill’s reconstruction, when the Mongols’ expansionist empire connected north-eastern China, where an epidemic broke out in 1331 CE, all the way to Europe via the shores of the Black Sea. However, evidence of the plague occurring in China or India in the fourteenth century has recently been shown to be very weak. Thus, the exact origins of the second plague pandemic are still unclear.29 The plague appeared in Crimea in 1346–47 and reached Constantinople soon after. From there, it surged through the Mediterranean world and by 1348, reached Spain, France and southern England.30 In 1349–50, it devastated northern France, the British Isles, Germany and the Scandinavian region. It then crept up to Russia, touching Moscow in 1353. It moved like a wave, spreading over an average of five to six months in one place.\n\nWinters were generally safer as the bubonic plague then seems to have flourished in warmer climates. The pandemic affected both rural and urban areas, killed people across classes though more among the poor, and spread throughout Europe in a very short time. This characteristic and the apparent absence of rodent-related observations have led to speculation over the exact mechanism of transmission. Port towns seemed to receive the disease first, suggesting that it travelled faster by sea than by land; some remote areas in the Balkans were spared entirely. Infected rodents on ships could have transported the disease but fleas could survive even without rodents and be transported in clothing. Incidents of pneumonic plague in pockets also suggest airborne transmission. Overall, death in Europe was widespread, and the impact, seen as a share of the population, was possibly higher than in the first plague pandemic. Up to 50 million people could have died, representing 35 to 60 per cent of Europe and the Mediterranean world, and 10 to 20 per cent of the global population at the time.31 The experience of the pandemic was unprecedented for those who lived through it, since the last recorded plague had occurred in the eighth century. Instant flight to relatively safer zones was the most common reaction. Christian and Islamic religious leaders organized events to pray for the pandemic to end, and some marked it as an apocalypse.32 Jews emerged as scapegoats in Aragon, Provence, Catalonia, Switzerland, Rhineland and southern Germany, accused by Christians of spreading the plague by poisoning wells, as the exact cause of the plague was not known at that time. Despite the Pope’s intervention, violence ensued and property was destroyed or confiscated. The medical fraternity tried in vain to provide cures. Steeped in the medical traditions of Hippocrates and Galen and the ‘miasma’ theory of diseases, which attributed causes to impure air, corpse decay and even astrological events, it found the plague to be a formidable disease to fight against in the fourteenth century. Largescale public health measures were taken more readily in parts of Europe than in the Middle East, with Italy taking the lead in passing sanitation and burial legislations and travel and cloth-trade\n\nregulations. Public assemblies were also curtailed, and at least one city, Milan, which forcefully implemented these measures, rode the plague wave better than others.33 Economic compulsions of keeping infection rates low and trading channels open drove several of these efforts in Italy. These measures in the fourteenth century were critical in shaping European public health organizations in later centuries. The short-term effects of the pandemic were costly in human lives, in economic damage through trade disruption, in the psychological impact on survivors, and in the resources expended to contain it. Solidarity and trust also suffered. As observed and fictionalized by the Italian writer Boccaccio during the pandemic, ‘One citizen fled after another, and one neighbour had not any care of another. Parents nor kindred never visiting them, but utterly they were forsaken on all sides.’34 The legacies of the second plague pandemic also varied across regions. In relatively underpopulated Spain and in eastern Europe, the pandemic may have further worsened the position of labour as the smaller workforce could not make the most of existing natural resources.35 In Italy, wealth inequality declined in the aftermath as real wages rose due to substantial labour scarcity. In northern Europe, the labour shortage may have led more women to join the labour market and thus fundamentally change demographic behaviour. The second plague pandemic was at the peak of its severity between 1346 and 1353 CE but also covered a wider cycle of localized plague outbreaks that stretched on into the early nineteenth century. Many cities in France and Italy were affected from 1628 to 1631 and London was severely affected in 1665–66, first by the plague and then by a fire. The plague in Marseilles in 1720 was the last major plague outbreak in western Europe. Mortality rates in these subsequent outbreaks were lower than in the fourteenth century and disproportionately affected the poor since they lived in densely populated, unsanitary areas and had limited access to treatment. The selection of victims meant that the plague also began to be seen as a way to check population growth. As one\n\nseventeenth-century friar battling the plague in Genoa in 1656–57 noted, What would the world be, if God did not sometimes touch it with plague? How could he feed so many people? … Contagion is the effect of divine providence, for the good governance of the universe.36\n\nPandemics from new encounters When Christopher Columbus sailed to the Caribbean islands in 1492 CE and inaugurated a ‘New World’ for Europe to discover and exploit, he inadvertently set in motion a remarkable pandemic. Known as the ‘Columbian Exchange’, the European colonization of the American world carried new goods and animals across the Atlantic Ocean but also circulated new diseases.37 Syphilis, the sexually transmitted disease, is likely to have entered Europe from the American world and travelled from Europe to Asia and Africa, tormenting many generations. But more devastatingly, the Americas began to grapple with diseases from Europe, Asia and Africa, against which the native population had little immunity. Among such diseases brought to the Americas, smallpox was the deadliest. Today’s generation may not remember smallpox, as the last infectious case was registered in the 1970s. The virus (Variola major and Variola minor) has been successfully eradicated from general circulation and is now preserved only in laboratories. Transmitted through airborne droplets, it had an incubation period of around twelve days, after which the body would show symptoms like high fever, body aches and rashes, followed by pimples turning into pustules.38 For survivors, those pustules would erupt, dry and crust and the scabs would fall off three or four weeks after the onset of the disease, leaving marks on the skin. In fact, perhaps the earliest evidence of smallpox comes from marks preserved on the body of the mummy of the ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses V, who reigned during the twelfth century BCE.39 Blindness and male infertility were only some of the potential side effects of smallpox.\n\nBut if you did not die from it, you did get lasting immunity against it. That is why an old saying in India, common in the nineteenth century, was that children were not counted as permanent members of the family until they had encountered smallpox once and survived.40 Smallpox was widely prevalent in the non-American world. It broke out as an epidemic at least once, if not twice, in the first millennium CE and wreaked havoc in the Roman Empire. A ninthcentury treatise, The Treatise on Smallpox and Measles, by a Baghdadi physician named Rhazes, outlined the disease’s characteristics in great detail.41 In India, Goddess Sitala came to be revered for her power to spark or curtail smallpox, and the disease was well-known in China as well. Between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, it affected Europe substantially, with records indicating that the disease was responsible for 10 to 15 per cent of all deaths annually in a few countries in the eighteenth century, the victims being mostly children under the age of ten.42 It is in this period, roughly after 1519 CE, that the disease landed in the Americas. Tribe after tribe, society after society, whether in the West Indies or in Mexico or further south in the Incan Empire or north towards Canada, perished in staggering numbers. While researchers have found it difficult to distinguish between mortality by war and mortality by disease, the native American experience was nothing short of a demographic catastrophe. Because the disease was transmitted from Europe and because it was raging simultaneously in Europe and the American world for much of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, this episode may be categorized as a pandemic. By some estimates, the population of the American world shrank by 80 to 90 per cent—a far greater impact than what Europe suffered during the second plague pandemic.43 This mortality was around 2 per cent of the global population of that time. In the late eighteenth century, a similar wipeout took place in Australia and other Oceanic regions when Europeans reached those shores, though on a much smaller population base than in the Americas.\n\nAn early form of vaccination, known as inoculation or variolation, involved some measures to protect oneself against smallpox. These practices had long been known in Asia and Africa and were eventually also adopted in Europe and by non-native American folk in the eighteenth century. This included rubbing a part of the scab into one’s skin or blowing it up the nose so as to contract a mild infection that granted lasting immunity.44 Edward Jenner (1749–1823), an English variolator, perfected a vaccination procedure using cowpox matter (vacca means cow in Latin) in the 1790s that proved to be a superior technique and was adopted around the world in the nineteenth century, but not without controversy. Hindus in India, who worship the cow, were hostile to the idea of using bovine material in vaccination and the arm-based injection method was also unpopular.45 However, the initial hostility decreased, presumably after seeing the effects, and smallpox-related mortality started to fall rapidly. To sum up, based on the evidence available today, the first and second plague pandemics and the pandemic from the new encounters barely touched Asia, in relative terms. This historical asymmetry was to change in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when pandemics corresponding to three different diseases would ravage many parts of Asia and other territories. These pandemics had one thing in common and that is the country with the highest mortality. Good luck would finally run out in the land of karmic beliefs, and it would be India’s turn to be affected in a new century of pandemics.\n\nThe Age of Pandemics, 1817–1920: Cholera, the Plague and Influenza The Age of Pandemics saw cholera break out in recurring bouts and on a wider scale from 1817 onwards, the plague wreak havoc from the end of the nineteenth century, and reached its crescendo with the influenza pandemic of 1918–20. Cholera was endemic in India but a new strain seems to have appeared in 1817 that gradually moved out of the country and overwhelmed the world. In western Europe and the Americas, the impact was felt acutely between the 1830s and\n\n1860s, but in Russia and Egypt the impact was felt throughout the nineteenth century. Around 20 million died worldwide in the cholera pandemic until 1920. Its impact was lesser after 1920 because techniques on both, prevention and cure, improved dramatically in the twentieth century. The third plague pandemic in history began in China in the late nineteenth century. It broke out in Hong Kong in 1894 and arrived in Bombay in 1896, most likely via ships, before becoming endemic in many parts of western and northern India. It also circulated across leading ports and some hinterlands of the world. The plague had tapered out by 1920, though it continued to break out in a few places for a while afterwards. Until 1920, it had claimed around 13 million lives, 12 million in India alone. Unlike cholera and the plague, the influenza pandemic was far more global in distribution. It was also shorter-lived, lasting for only a few months in most countries, with the peak occurring between September and December 1918. The influenza pandemic of 1918–20 is considered to be the deadliest pandemic in history, wiping out over 40 million people.46 Again, the Indian subcontinent was affected most severely as 20 million people died in the span of a few months, making it the worst demographic disaster ever to fall upon a region in such a short period of time.47 This book is about these pandemics between 1817 and 1920, which are unique for their wide geographical coverage and high mortality impact, especially in places previously unaffected by other major pandemics. The book is centred on India because India was at the epicentre of mass mortality in all these episodes. In contrast to the several volumes written on pandemics before 1817, this period has so far attracted scant attention outside the limited world of medical historians. The reason for this neglect is not surprising: this period overlaps with a period of tremendous significance in history, known in Eric Hobsbawm’s classic series as the ‘Age of Revolution, 1789–1848’, the ‘Age of Capital, 1848–1875’, the ‘Age of Empire, 1875–1914’, and in Christopher Bayly’s seminal work as ‘The Birth of the Modern World, 1780–1914’.48 In economic history, this is a period of the ‘Great Divergence’, when western Europe and North America marched ahead of China,\n\nIndia and the rest of the world in economic terms.49 This is also a period of globalization and mass migration, both of which picked up pace in the late nineteenth century and peaked at the onset of World War I in 1914. And yet, chronicles of empire, economic advancement and globalization tend to downplay or omit the significance of pandemics in this period, presumably because Europe was not as adversely affected as in the past.50 To put it simply, it would be impossible to write the global history of the fourteenth century without mentioning the plague or, for that matter, to write the history of the twentieth century without mentioning the two world wars. And yet, the Age of Pandemics that this book describes has curiously been forgotten, even though the pandemics of this period collectively killed an equivalent number of people or more. Together, the pandemics claimed over 70 million lives (40 million in India) between 1817 and 1920, which is about the same as the battle casualties of the two world wars of the twentieth century.51 And because these deaths were concentrated in Asia, it contributed to the stunning decline in Asia’s share in global population from 65 per cent around 1817 to close to 50 per cent in 1920. This is important to note because the vast literature on the ‘Great Divergence’ shows that in the same period Asia’s contribution to global economic output fell from over 50 per cent to close to 20 per cent on account of the ‘rise of the west’.52 And yet, Asia’s falling share in global population has not attracted equal attention. The unequal geographical distribution of mortality in the Age of Pandemics was certainly one factor which caused this phenomenon. After 1920, the world rarely witnessed severe pandemics. The influenza pandemics of 1957–58 and 1968 killed less than 3 million, mostly in Asia, while the 2009–10 H1N1 influenza pandemic killed even fewer. The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) 2002– 04 outbreak caused a major scare, especially in Hong Kong and China but the number of infected people ran into only a few thousands. A similar case is observed for the Ebola virus in west Africa in recent years. The deadliest pandemic since 1920 has been that of HIV–AIDS (Human Immunodeficiency Virus–Acquired\n\nImmunodeficiency Syndrome), moving slowly through populations to claim over 30 million lives since it was first recorded in the 1980s. The HIV pandemic spread widely but had its biggest impact on sub-Saharan Africa. Between 1920 and 2019, around 40 million deaths can be attributed to pandemics but in the same period the population of the world has also grown enormously, from under 2 billion to over 7 billion. Pandemic deaths of the past century, therefore, comprised around 1 or 2 per cent of the global population in this period. In contrast, this figure was over 5 per cent for the Age of Pandemics between 1817 and 1920. And this figure was never so high for any other century in recorded history, barring perhaps the sixth and the fourteenth. The historical amnesia about the Age of Pandemics in Europe and North America is understandable as mortality rates were relatively lower there, though COVID-19 is reviving interest in the events of 1918–20, the most recent lethal pandemic to affect those regions. The memory loss in Asia is harder to understand, more so in India, the country most affected by the pandemic age. This was brought home to me starkly at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020, when social media was rife with misinformation, attacking China as the source of all pandemics in history, applauding the wholesome diets and vegetarianism in India as a traditional bulwark against pandemics and more generally lauding the nation for never having been the originator of pandemics. In early March 2020, there were articles written on how Indians were not affected in recent influenza pandemics and that there was no need to overreact to COVID-19. Public conversation was filled with boasts about the special nature of Indian immunity against diseases contracted from growing up in unclean environments, and that the West was susceptible to pandemics because they did not develop immunity due to childhoods spent in clean environments! It was as if the Age of Pandemics that devastated India for a century had been wiped clean from people’s collective memory. The nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in Indian history are known for the rise and fall of British colonial rule, not for pandemics. This\n\nbook hopes to change this narrative. And, as we will see, these pandemics were important events that served as springboards for the resistance towards colonial rule and therefore had a significant impact on the history of India. But the Age of Pandemics did not shape only India. It also shaped the world. The quest to control the pandemics transformed medical science. Public health systems were revolutionized, cutting down mortality in some parts of the world and laying the foundations for it to happen after 1920 in the other parts. The health surveillance system that started with a series of conferences to control pandemics from 1851 ultimately led to the formation of the WHO in 1948. And as each of the chapters of this book will attest to, the Age of Pandemics had social, economic and political ramifications.\n\n2 Cholera\n\n‘Bahut bade doctor miya Haiza ki soorat dekhte hain to unki rooh kaanp uthti hai’ (Even distinguished doctors tremble with fear when they see Cholera [haiza]) – Hakim Saiyad Amaldar Hussain in India, 18831 around the graves at the South Park Street Cemetery in A walk Kolkata makes for an offbeat outing in a city with multiple tourist attractions. Established in 1767 and known as ‘The Great Cemetery’, it is today a charming place with distinctive tombstones and obelisks, curious epitaphs, thick foliage and lovers seeking privacy in one of the most densely populated cities in the world. It is also immortalized as the site of the action in Gorosthaney Sabdhan (The Secret of the Cemetery) from Satyajit Ray’s detective series featuring Feluda. The identities of those buried here are, of course, no secret. They were mostly Europeans living in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in what was then Calcutta, at a time when the English East India Company, and later the British government, administered the city. A glance at the epitaphs discloses professions such as ‘surgeon’, ‘translator’ and ‘schoolteacher’, even ‘breeder of cattle’, but the real secrets of the cemetery unfold through a statistical analysis of the burial records, available as a slim book at the entrance counter.2 This shows that the median age of the 2,000-plus who are buried here was only twenty-nine. Of them, 40 per cent were female and 20 per cent under the age of ten, a feature less\n\neasily recognizable while walking around the graves. It also shows that in a particular year, burials that had averaged twenty every year for decades suddenly doubled to over forty and stayed similarly high for the next few decades as well.3 The year that marked this tragic shift was 1817, the beginning of a great cholera pandemic that would sweep the world in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The cholera pandemic would reshape commerce and pilgrimage through quarantine regulations, spark global cooperative efforts in the form of periodic sanitation conferences, trigger riots and revolts, generate legendary medical controversies and scientific breakthroughs, haunt cities such as Calcutta, Cairo, London and New York, dampen the euphoric mood of western Europe’s industrial revolution and even, mysteriously, become associated with the circulation of chapatis. By the late nineteenth century, the cholera pandemic was so widespread that it could be identified as a defining period, inspiring the novelist Gabriel García Márquez in 1985 to title his book, set in the South American past, as El amor en los tiempos del cólera or Love in the Time of Cholera.\n\nCholera Strikes, 1817–1823 The year 1817 was otherwise a relatively ordinary one in global history. There were around 1 billion human beings on the planet, nearly two-thirds of whom lived in Asia—around 200 million in India and close to 400 million in China.4 In Europe, the Napoleonic Wars had just ended two years before, by which time Britain had emerged as the undisputed supreme naval power in the world.5 Much of Africa had not yet been colonized by European nations. Slave trade persisted in certain pockets, despite mounting pressure from those seeking to abolish the system. The Russian Empire under Tsar Alexander I had just scored a famous victory against Napoleon in 1812; the long-running Ottoman Empire was struggling to hold on to its territories; Muhammad Ali Pasha was earning respect for his military accomplishments in Egypt. The Qing dynasty ruled in China, the Saud dynasty in Arabia and the Qajar dynasty in Persia.\n\nThe English East India Company ruled less than a third of the land mass of the Indian subcontinent, and was mostly confined to the east and the south. It had lost its monopoly over trade with India in 1813 but had profited vastly from the opium trade with China in return for tea. The cities of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras were key sites of commerce and the Company also raised land revenue from the places it governed directly in the hinterland. The Maratha Empire administered large tracts of India and the Nizam-ruled Hyderabad state was another formidable power in the south. On the other side of the planet, the clarion call for freedom reverberated in South America. The United States was in its forty-first year of independence and had a small population of 10 million, a figure smaller than the population of Kolkata today.6 (That year, two brothers in the US started a publishing house, Harper Brothers, whose later avatar would publish a book on pandemics in 2020.) The most important event of 1817, then, in hindsight, would not be related to business or politics, but to the outbreak of a disease— also what 2020 is likely to be remembered for in the future. The cholera outbreak began in Bengal in eastern India, owing to a likely mutation of certain bacteria, much later named Cholerae vibrio. Its key disease-causing symptoms—a diarrhoea with rice-water stool, vomiting, dehydration, sunken eyes and changes in the colour of the skin, often to blue—had almost certainly been noted before 1817 in India and in other parts of the world.7 Historically, since bile was a common humoral element in the Hippocratic tradition of medicine in Europe and in Ayurvedic practice based on the texts of Sushruta and Charaka in ancient India, various interpretations have been drawn on the existence of cholera in the world.8 Vishuchika, in Ayurvedic traditions, is now considered to mean ‘cholera-like’ while Arabic references used haiza or similar sounding words to describe the disease, which stuck on in Unani medicinal practices in India.9 A clearer reference to an epidemic known as moryxy, marked by crippling stomach pains and mass mortality with cholera-like symptoms, emerges in 1543 CE in Portuguese-ruled Goa.10 Every burial was accompanied by the ringing of the church bell but as the\n\ndeath count increased, this practice had to be banned by the governor, Martim Afonso de Sousa, to calm the citizens. When patients died in hospital, the orders were to open up the corpse for examination, but all they found were shrunken stomachs. Steeped in Hippocratic and Christian traditions of that time, climatic factors and demons were held responsible for the epidemic. A few decades later, the physician Garcia da Orta added eating disorders and excessive ‘conversation with women’ to this list of causes.11 More mentions of cholera-like diseases followed and by the eighteenth century the French in India were referring to the disease as mort-de-chien (dog’s death), a corruption of mordexim, used by the Portuguese, which in turn is likely to have been derived from the Konkani verb moixi, which means to fall.12 Military and pilgrim sites were noted to be worst affected by the disease, and would later emerge as major centres in the nineteenth century. For instance, a reference appears to cholera affecting the invading army of Ahmad Shah Durrani, the ruler of Afghanistan, in 1757, close to the holy city of Vrindavan in north India.13 The army was forced to retreat due to the epidemic. In 1783, the pilgrimage centre of Haridwar on the banks of the Ganga in north India, which attracted crowds in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, suffered a cholera outbreak that killed around 20,000 people.14 Then, in 1813, James Johnson, a physician, devoted an entire chapter in his book on diseases in tropical climates to Cholera Morbus, as it was then being called by the British.15 He argued that the bile secretions should not be seen as the cause but as a symptom of the disease and that the cure should focus on ‘the early restoration of balance in the circulation’, which was remarkably prophetic for that time.16 The greatest cure for cholera, and indeed, against other diarrhoeic diseases, would be invented only in the middle of the twentieth century as Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT), and involve salts, sugars and fluids to restore balance in circulation. Johnson’s recommendations for therapy, instead, focussed on the prevailing practice of a dosage of opium and calomel (mercurous chloride) to allay ‘the orgasm of the stomach and bowels’.17\n\nThe British medical system at this stage did not confer substantial advantages over what was being offered by the vaids and hakims practising Ayurvedic and Unani medical traditions, respectively. In fact, the British themselves had it as tough as the Indians when it came to surviving diseases in India. According to the historian David Gilmour, in his book The British in India: In 1805 one visitor reported that he had twice lunched with men whose burials he had been invited to attend before supper that same day. When an epidemic arrived at a station, people began measuring their lives in hours: they went to the Club ‘each evening apprehensive to know who was missing from the night before’. Death was so familiar to the British in India, so quick and so frequent, that there hardly seemed room for prolonged grief. If an officer died on campaign, his belongings were auctioned as soon as the funeral was over: horses, clothes, revolver, even his cooking-pot and his water-bottle.18\n\nLeonard Roger’s sketch of the cholera outbreak in India, 1817–1819\n\nNumbers marked on the map refer to the dates of cholera outbreak. Source: Leonard Rogers, ‘The Forecasting and Control of Cholera Epidemics in India’, Journal of the Royal Society of Arts, 75 (3874) (1927): 323. The cholera of 1817 came amid this background of high mortality caused by other infectious diseases such as malaria, and was still noted for its lethality and virulence. The official report of the Medical Board of Bengal in 1820 pointed out that the disease was ‘quite new’ when it appeared in 1817.19 While the officials blamed it on fluctuations of weather in 1816 and 1817, this was most likely a new strain of cholera, just as another strain was identified in the\n\nlate twentieth century, which quickly became the dominant strain in the world, albeit with a milder impact than the one before it.20 Much of what we now know about cholera in the nineteenth century is due to detailed medical reports prepared by numerous physicians and government officials, especially in India and Europe.21 Despite their many scientific errors, as later research would show, those reports were valuable in identifying outbreaks and understanding how officials responded to medical crises. An early announcement of the first of many explosive cholera outbreaks came by way of a letter dated 23 August 1817 from Dr Tytler, a civil surgeon at Jessore in Bengal, who wrote the following to the district judge: An epidemic has broken out in the bazaar, the disorder commencing with pain or uneasiness in different parts of the body, presently succeeded by giddiness of the head, sickness, vomiting, griping in the belly, and frequent stools. The countenance exhibits anxiety, the body becomes emaciated, the pulse rapidly shrinks, and the patient, if not speedily relieved with large doses of calomel, followed by one of opium, is carried off within four and twenty hours.22 The first reaction in Jessore (a centre of indigo processing), as in other towns of the region, was a mass exodus as people fled in panic.23 By September, reports of a major cholera outbreak were pouring in from various parts of the Bengal province, a region comprising much of modern-day Bangladesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and coastal Odisha. The epidemic struck during the prelude to the Third Anglo-Maratha War and caught the English forces unawares. The governor general, Francis Rawdon-Hastings (1754–1826), was camping in Bundelkhand in November 1817 in a bid to oust the Pindaris, powerful mercenaries operating in central India under Maratha patronage. Cholera ripped through his camp, killing hundreds by the week. Hastings’s diary entry for 14 November reads as follows:\n\nNinety-seven deaths are reported to me as having occurred during yesterday forenoon. There is an opinion that the water of the tanks, the only water which we have at this place, may be unwholesome and add to the disease; therefore I march tomorrow, so as to make the Pohooj river, though I must provide carriage for above 1,000 sick.24 The association of cholera with water stood him in good stead as he survived the ordeal, won the war, obtained a greater part of western India and continued as governor general till 1823. In 1817–18, cholera devasted the countryside of Bundelkhand and hit most parts of the subcontinent, claiming many more lives than the war. Cholera reportedly killed 10,000 in Allahabad in March 1818, though curiously, not one of the 700 prisoners in that city suffered from the disease.25 In Calcutta, it was not just the South Park Street Cemetery that reported a spike in deaths. The number of deaths attributed to ‘Cholera Morbus’ recorded at the Kashee Mittens Ghat crematory ground for Hindus rose from a couple of hundred in 1815 and 1816 to over 1,000 in 1817 and nearly 3,000 in 1818, before dropping to a little under 1,000 in 1819.26 In 1818, over half of all deaths at the Ghat were attributed to cholera. Epidemics provoked desperate prayers and the reigning deity for cholera in Bengal was Ola Bibi, just as Sitala was for smallpox. Temples to the goddess had been springing up even before 1817, but the events of that year led to a huge demand for the worship of Ola Bibi, much to the dismay of priests at other temples.27 A publicity drive by the priests of the Kali temple at Kalighat, emphasizing the protection provided to all those who came to that temple, was met enthusiastically with the theatrics of Ola Bibi devotees.28 In Bundelkhand, Hurdoul Lala became the cholera deity; the disease was blamed on Hastings’s British soldiers who sinned when they killed cows to feed themselves in the sacred grove of Lala, a former king’s son.29 While Hurdoul Lala was worshipped earlier for different reasons, the connection with cholera after 1817 led to his soaring popularity extending, by some accounts, from Calcutta to Lahore.30\n\nIn villages, religious processions were common to ward off the evil spirit of cholera, though as one traveller observed in the Narmada Valley in central India, there could be fights between those who wanted a silent procession and those who preferred noise.31 One Sanskrit scholar from that region mused that there were three types of disease in the world—for sins committed in past lives, for sins of the current life and for accidental sins—and that an epidemic like cholera came under the second category.32 In the Konkan region on the west coast, ‘witches’ and ‘sorcerers’ were blamed for cholera and attacked by the villagers.33 Despite these views, the native physicians, vaids and hakims, did command respect and were enlisted by the British in relief efforts. The cures offered could be a mixture of various medical traditions.34 The vaids prescribed black pepper, ginger, cloves and that most beloved Indian ingredient, heeng or asafoetida.35 In Madras in south India, physicians practising Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha (native to the region) assisted the government.36 And where the cures seemed to be effective, it won the appreciation of the locals, irrespective of who the ruling class was, the British or the local royals.37 Raja Serfoji II of Tanjore even established a chattram or charitable institution, with a public hospital for men and another for women built in 1802–03 along the Rameswaram pilgrimage route in south India, which saved numerous travellers during the cholera epidemic.38 Quarantines were rarely employed against cholera at this stage since the disease was not seen to be contagious and was instead attributed to poverty, filth, lack of ventilation, bad sanitation and environmental factors. In Calcutta, the worsening of congestion was noted and led to proposals of urban reform.39 A Lottery Committee was set up in 1817 to generate funds from public lotteries, and after the cholera outbreak, public health became its central focus. In this, the memory of London freeing itself from the plague in the seventeenth century provided the inspiration that it was indeed possible to combat epidemic diseases.40 Despite their efforts to clean up the city, cholera would continue to ravage Calcutta for four\n\nmore decades until the introduction of piped drinking water, since cholera was mainly a water-borne disease. The exact means of cholera transmission, including the waterborne theory, was a hotly debated topic during the nineteenth century and shall be discussed in greater detail in a later section. For now, it is worth noting that the cholera outbreak of 1817 is likely to have been transmitted across the subcontinent by soldiers, pilgrims and traders. The means of transport and communication were still slow and the disease moved from station to station in weeks, so it may not have been registered as a unified event. It took about sixteen months to overwhelm the Indian subcontinent; the epidemic nature of cholera receded only around 1821.41 Nepal in the north and Punjab in the north-west were not spared either, though the epidemic appeared late in those places.42 Cholera death rates were 21 per 1,000 among European troops and 10 per 1,000 among the native troops serving in the Madras army, and would have been much higher in north India.43 The statistics on deaths among the general population are unclear and from the scattered records of towns and villages, the historian David Arnold estimates that 1–2 million died in this cholera outbreak in the subcontinent.44 Such large demographic losses were commonplace since India’s fragile monsoon-dependent economy had caused a number of famines throughout history whenever the rains failed. The Bengal famines of the late eighteenth century were particularly devastating. And yet, for non-famine years, the loss of lives in the cholera outbreak of 1817 was perhaps unprecedented for that time. However, what distinguished the 1817 cholera outbreak from all records of preceding ones was its rapid spread to places as far away as Japan in the east and the borders of the Russian Empire in the west. In boats and caravans and in deserts and plateaus, people watched in horror the passing of rice-water stools and the subsequent deaths. As in India, prayers, calomel and opium were resorted to as possible remedies in many places. Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka) and Burma (modern-day Myanmar) had also reported cholera before 1817 and were affected in due course in 1818–19. Outside the Indian subcontinent,\n\nSingapore and Penang (in Malaysia) were vulnerable as they were ruled by the government of Bengal, and commanded by troops of the Bengal Native Infantry, and were thus exposed to constant troop movement from Bengal.45 Their position at the crossroads of east– west traffic provided trading benefits but also brought with it the risk of epidemic. Cholera appeared in Penang in October 1819, by when medical orders on the disease had already arrived from Bengal. Mortality was light in Penang and non-existent on the island of Singapore, which had ship-quarantine systems in place.46 However, from Penang, it spread inland through the Malay states, and from there to Siam or Thailand, where, reportedly, over 100,000 people died. The king of Siam conducted a religious ceremony in 1820 to ward off cholera but 7,000 died in the event.47 Around the same time, the Dutch-ruled island of Java in the Indonesian archipelago was also devastated, with some 17,000 dying in Batavia (now Jakarta) alone.48 Next on cholera’s path of destruction was China, where it perhaps first reached the busy port of Canton, and then other ports all the way up to Peking or Beijing. By one account, it also crossed the Great Wall, and then, on a caravan route, reached the borders of the Russian Empire.49 It touched Manila in the Philippines in 1820 and Nagasaki in Japan in 1822, most likely from a ship that sailed from Java, and spread to Osaka and other places, taking a considerable toll.50 Going west, cholera hit the Arabian and Persian worlds quite hard. A British expeditionary force from India took cholera to Oman in 1821. From there, it went up the shores of the Persian Gulf all the way to Persia or Iran. In Basra, over 15,000 people died within three weeks. Further north, cholera affected a war being fought between Turkey and Persia over an alleged insult of Persian pilgrims travelling to Mecca.51 A prince of Persia’s Qajar dynasty, Mohammad Ali Mirza Dawlatshah (1789–1821), who had previously won battles against the Ottomans and besieged Baghdad in 1821, was finally humbled by cholera and his forces had to retreat after his death. The disease proceeded further to Astrakhan on the border of the Russian Empire and to Aleppo in Syria in 1822, but there are no records of cholera outbreaks beyond those points. It\n\nappeared in Port Louis, Mauritius, imported from a ship that sailed from either Ceylon or India in 1819; that outbreak killed 6,000 people, mostly slaves working in plantations. From there, it proceeded to Reunion Island, and later was also observed in Zanzibar in coastal Africa in 1820–21. Between 1817 and 1823, cholera had ripped through India and other parts of Asia, touched Africa and reached the frontiers of Europe. After a brief pause, it began a longer march and would regularly be called ‘epidemic cholera’, ‘Indian cholera’ or ‘Asiatic cholera’ for its apparent origin.\n\nA Hundred Years of Intestinal Melancholy In the century that followed 1817, momentous changes took place in the world. In the realm of politics, European imperial powers overcame brief internal revolts and grew from strength to strength, with a unified Italy and a unified Germany joining France, Britain and Russia in the race to colonize the independent regions of Africa and Asia. Japan’s imperial ambitions also rose after the Meiji restoration in 1868. Wars and famines weakened China, the Ottoman and Persian empires waned in relative terms, and the British consolidated their hold over India, with Company rule transforming into Crown rule in 1858 after a major uprising. In business and economics, the cotton textiles–based first industrial revolution, which had begun in Britain in the late eighteenth century, was followed by a second industrial revolution towards the end of the nineteenth century. This one was led by advancements in chemicals, electricity, steel and petroleum. Scientific knowledge grew exponentially in various fields and at the turn of the twentieth century, bacteriology was fast replacing millennia-old notions of diseases based on miasma. In the realm of transport and communication, the concept of distance and time was fundamentally altered by the introduction of the railways, steamships and telegraphs. A wave of globalization, driven by the movement of goods and people and the trans-Atlantic boom of the late nineteenth century, led to a demographic reordering in the Americas. The population of the US rose ten-fold to around 100\n\nmillion by 1920, raising its share in the global population from about 1 per cent in 1817 to nearly 6 per cent in 1920.52 Urbanization took place unevenly in the world in this period but the population of the largest cities ran into hundreds of thousands, if not millions, across continents, with greater congestion and more slums. By 1920, nationalism and capitalism were widely entrenched, though the euphoria of the latter was punctured by World War I (1914–18) and the Russian Revolution of 1917. Amidst all these developments, cholera lurked in the background, bursting forth with great ferocity in certain places and times, leading to panic and protests. It was the nature of the disease, with its clear symptoms of watery excrements, that shocked societies. Cholera remained a mystery almost throughout this period, spurring endless unresolved debates on its causes and means of transmission, but always provoking actions and reactions in the form of quarantines and treatments. Based on a variety of statistical records, I estimate that cholera killed around 50 million people worldwide between 1817 and 1920.53 Of this, over 10 million people died outside the Indian subcontinent, some 3 million in Russia alone. Egypt experienced arguably the worst loss, relative to a country’s population, anywhere in the world. Another 10 million people died in the Indian subcontinent during the raging epidemics; around 30 million died because of cholera’s endemicity in India.54 Pandemic cholera thus killed about 20 million in this period. Table 1 at the end of this chapter provides a brief global distribution. This is not an exceptionally large figure by pandemic standards and we will see later how influenza killed 20 million people in India alone in a matter of a few months in 1918–19. Cholera’s significance is to be understood more in terms of how it captured the popular discourse rather than in the number of its victims. It was undoubtedly the most talked about among the four big diseases of the nineteenth century, the others being the plague, smallpox and typhus. Malaria was far deadlier but unlike cholera, it did not sweep across the world in the form of a pandemic. Since the late nineteenth century, cholera researchers have attempted to characterize pandemic cholera in distinct waves that began and ended in particular years, the first being 1817–1823.55\n\nRobert Pollitzer wrote a monumental book on cholera in 1959 for the WHO, outlining six cholera pandemics beginning in 1817, 1829, 1852, 1863, 1881 and 1899.56 The implicit assumption then was that all the cholera pandemics originated in India, a position that is difficult to defend today given the recent research on the nature of the disease.57 This is because the bacteria that cause cholera have been found to live in certain maritime systems and the disease can become endemic in certain regions over time. Thus, one possibility is that the new and virulent strain of cholera, which probably emerged in 1817, spread initially and settled in certain water bodies, causing frequent outbreaks and spreading outwards from those locations. Seen in this light, the six pandemics could be considered as being nested within one large pandemic extending over a century.58 While Bengal in India could well have been the origin in 1817, it was unlikely to have been the source of all the observed outbreaks over time. It is therefore more useful to understand pandemic cholera in geographic rather than in sequential terms.\n\nThe Indian Subcontinent Cholera was endemic in eastern India and parts of the south and the west and hurt the poor disproportionately, but in epidemic form it haunted all alike, especially the British rulers.59 Prominent members of the ruling elite killed by cholera in India in the nineteenth century included Commander-in-Chief General Anson, on his journey to Delhi during the 1857 uprising, and General Barnard, his successor, while he was attacking the city; Olive Fergusson, the wife of the presidency’s governor, in 1882 in Bombay; Thomas Munro in 1827 and George Ward in 1860, both governors of Madras.60 Nearly 9,000 British soldiers fell prey to cholera between 1818 and 1854, and in the decade that followed nearly a third of all deaths among them were attributed to the disease.61 There were several cholera epidemics in India after 1817, but the severe epidemic of 1856–57 is of some political significance because it coincided with a major revolt against British rule that began in the first half of 1857. Indian soldiers in some garrisons in\n\nnorth India mutinied because of rumours of animal fat being used in gun cartridges, which had to be bitten off before being loaded into the gun; eating the meat of certain animals was prohibited in both Islam and Hinduism. These mutinies soon sparked a full-blown violent confrontation between several princely states and the British, which the latter eventually won. What is less widely known about this saga is the circulation of chapatis and cholera. In early 1857, district officials observed a mysterious circulation of chapatis, the staple unleavened wheat bread of north India, which were being prepared and passed on from one village headman to another.62 This was taken to be sign of protest by ruling officials but some historians have interpreted it to be a way of passing communication about the arrival of cholera. As one study has shown, regiments that observed this circulation were likelier to mutiny because fear of the disease inflated their prejudice against ethnic outgroups (the British) that were rumoured to be interfering with their religion.63 Chapatis and cholera also appear in J.G. Farrel’s novel The Siege of Krishnapur (1973), which is set against the backdrop of the 1857 revolt.64 Whether or not the practice of warning by chapatis persisted over time we do not know, but cholera certainly did. Alarmed by the devastating cholera epidemics of 1856–57 and 1860–61, the British instituted a death registration system, first for the military and then for the general population. It is from this point onwards that we obtain a clearer understanding of cholera. Using these statistics and scattered sources for previous decades, I estimate that around 40 million Indians died due to cholera between 1817 and 1920.65 This works out to around 300,000 gut-wrenching deaths every year, comprising around 5 per cent of all deaths in the Indian subcontinent in this period. What the death statistics also show is that cholera death rates were increasing in India in the late nineteenth century, even as they were receding in most parts of the world. A major factor in this was the series of devastating famines in the late 1870s and 1890s as India experienced record shortfalls in rain.66 Famines led people to congregate in relief centres where the water quality could be\n\nunpredictable, spurring large outbreaks, and they also weakened people’s bodies, making them susceptible to infectious diseases. In 1900, the year cholera mortality in India peaked, around 1 million cholera-related deaths were reported, closely associated with a famine. From 1919, cholera began to recede—in impact because of better treatment methods and in incidence because major famines in peacetime conditions had ceased to occur.67 It briefly resurfaced in the 1940s during the Bengal famine and at the time of the Partition of 1947 but never displayed its past ferocity again. In the nineteenth century, there emerged several popular ideas to beat cholera, all based on the assumption that it was transmitted by air. The residential segregation in urban settlements was intensified to keep infectious diseases away from British quarters.68 In the military, ‘cholera-dodging’ was considered to be effective: troops would break up into smaller groups and move to higher grounds.69 Hill stations were one popular way to beat the Indian heat and diseases. Cholera, it was observed by the British in the nineteenth century, had ravaged the plains for forty years but touched Nepal only twice and had barely ever touched Darjeeling.70 The means of communication improved with the telegraph system in the late nineteenth century and information of cholera outbreaks began to be relayed in real time to the public. The mobility of people within and emigration from India both rose in the nineteenth century, widening the arc of the cholera epidemics. The semi-permanent, male-dominated, remittance-based Great Indian Migration Wave that took off in the late nineteenth century provided the ideal transmitter of infectious diseases: the circulatory migrant labourer.71 All throughout this period, Bengal was undoubtedly the worst affected region, registering the highest cholera death rate of nearly 3 per 1,000 before 1920.72 This was followed by the Madras Presidency in the south, where cholera was endemic in some places, and then by parts of central and north India. Punjab in the northwest was the least affected and when epidemics did occur there, they were traced to Hindu pilgrimage routes connected with the famous Kumbha Melas in Haridwar and Allahabad, discussed in\n\ngreater detail later.73 The regional variation in endemicity almost certainly reflected the survival prospects of Cholerae vibrio in different water systems. We know less about how cholera affected India’s princely states even though they comprised close to 40 per cent of the subcontinent’s land mass during British Crown rule. The Nizamruled Hyderabad state was certainly affected. One account shows that cholera was known there as gattara, and that it was remembered as a painful episode of the early twentieth century.74 In his memoirs about his family, published in 2011, Dr Y.B. Satyanarayana noted the devastating impact of a cholera outbreak in a region close to Karimnagar. His grandfather, Narsiah, had to carry the dead bodies of his parents and bury them with his own hands; soon afterwards, his wife would also die of cholera at a very young age. He describes the taboos around cholera in the first decades of the twentieth century as follows: In those days, infectious diseases were widespread in villages, particularly in untouchable dwellings. Cholera was one such disease. Each house had at least a couple of deaths due to cholera. People called this dreadful disease gattara and were even afraid of touching the dead body of a person who had died of the disease. Only the inmates of the house could carry the dead body for cremation.75 Such taboos persisted till the middle of the twentieth century, by when the impact of cholera had greatly reduced. Dr B.R. Ambedkar (1891–1956), a key architect of independent India’s Constitution, recounted the following incident that occurred in 1943 and was reminiscent of the attacks on ‘witches’ during the early nineteenth century: It was reported from Nasik on 1st September that the Hindus of a village attacked an Achchut [Untouchable] family; tied the hands and feet of an elderly woman, placed her on a pile of wood which was subsequently set on fire. All this because they thought she was the cause of the Cholera in the village.76\n\nSuch cholera deaths or retributions evoked horror but the deaths themselves, when sufficiently large in number, could have unexpected economic consequences. From the viewpoint of factors of production, an important distinction between epidemics, and wars and natural calamities, is that epidemics usually destroy only labour while the others potentially destroy land, labour and capital. The consequence of this is the possibility that people who survive epidemics can work with more land and capital and that there could be changes in the bargaining positions of different sections of society. The evidence for this occurring due to the cholera epidemics of India is limited, though very early on, the Bengali social reformer Ram Mohan Roy (1772–1833) did note the following to the House of Commons in 1831: The vast number carried of late years, by cholera morbus, having greatly relieved the pressure of surplus population, the condition of the labourers has since much improved in comparison with what it was before the people were thinned by that melancholy scourge.77 On the other hand, cholera reduced workdays in the year and could slow economic activity. It could also cut short budding talent, as it did with Henry Louis Vivian Derozio (1809–1831), whose grave lies in the South Park Street Cemetery. Born in Calcutta, the AngloPortuguese Derozio was a gifted poet who accomplished a lot in his twenty-two short years.78 In a poem titled ‘To India–My Native Land’, he lamented the advent of colonial rule in India and longed for a brighter past, one without colonialism—presumably, also a past without epidemic cholera. It was a fitting tribute to him that the landmark discovery that resolved much of the mystery of cholera was made by a team of Indian scientists in independent India, and only a few kilometres away from his grave.\n\nEurope\n\nThe first major cholera outbreak had stopped at the borders of the Russian Empire in 1823. This was not by chance. Due to the recommendation of one German physician serving Tsar Alexander I, the government had set up a board for all medical-administrative matters, which worked towards stopping cholera from entering Russia.79 This seemed to work until 1829, when cholera finally made inroads and worked itself westwards slowly across the Russian rivers, reaching Moscow in 1830 and England in 1831–32. Troop movements due to the Polish–Russian war of 1830–31 hastened cholera’s transmission from Russia to western Europe and were criticized by the French, who pointed out that it was ‘historically known that it first appeared and was propagated in India by Lord Hastings’ army’.80 Cholera broke out in Europe repeatedly until the 1860s, after which it abated in most places. Military movement, markets and fairs, inland and overseas water transport, railways and the roads were cited as key reasons for disease dispersion. Like in India, deprivation and famines pushed countless people from the countryside to the towns in central Europe, where many eventually succumbed to the disease.81 Cholera’s impact in Europe was significant because it challenged the notion of material progress. According to the historian Richard Evans, cholera ‘challenged common assumptions of European cultural and biological superiority by demonstrating the vulnerability of even the most civilised people to a disease associated mainly with oriental backwardness’.82 Cholera’s disproportionate impact on the urban poor also exacerbated social tensions and exposed the weaknesses of urban infrastructure. London, for instance, was not very different from Calcutta in terms of sanitation in the early nineteenth century. The novelist Charles Dickens (1812–1870), whose son’s epitaph lies in the South Park Street Cemetery in Calcutta, eloquently described the inequality and abysmal living conditions of the urban working poor in the England of those times. In 1849 and 1853–54, poorer London districts like Rotherhithe and Bermondsey experienced cholera mortality rates nearly eight times higher than those in\n\nKensington or Westminster.83 Among the poor, the seeming immunity of the rich led to perceptions of exploitation and deliberate action taken against them. To make matters worse, the anatomy departments of medical schools required corpses to examine, leading to the suspicion that doctors were gravediggers. In such settings, ‘cholera riots’ took place in many corners of Europe and outbreaks of the disease coincided with Europe’s revolutionary year of 1848, the Crimean War in the 1850s, the overthrow of the German Confederation in 1866, the end of France’s Second Empire in 1871, and the skirmishes in Russian Poland in 1892.84 However, the pandemic was usually a consequence rather than a cause of those political upheavals, although it was one that could claim more lives than the upheaval itself. Russia had it the toughest, connected as it was with west and south Asia by road networks in many directions, and it is likely that cholera became endemic there to some extent. Nearly 500,000 cases were reported in 1831, nearly 2 million in 1848, and nearly 1 million in 1892, with several other years in between with hundreds of thousands of cases. Case fatality rates, that is the death rate among those infected, when reported, hovered around 50 per cent and the death toll for 1817–1920 is estimated to be around 3 million.85 The famous Russian music composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840–1893), shortly after composing his Sixth Symphony, died due to cholera (a glass of unboiled water in a restaurant being the likely culprit), just like his mother had years before.86 Prizes were offered in the early days of the pandemic to anyone who could develop an effective cure for cholera. Those prizes remained unawarded but based on a Russian doctor’s recommendation, steam baths became a fad as a way to treat cholera.87 The first instances of intravenous treatment of cholera occurred in Russia but the method would be perfected only in the early twentieth century in India. However, at that time, injections were treated with great suspicion, as in 1910, when one Dr Pantchenko was accused of being a ‘hitman’ and injecting cholera bacteria into his ‘victims’.88\n\nIn England, cholera first arrived in 1831–32 on ships that sailed from the Baltic region, and quickly claimed over 5,000 lives.89A London medical journal observed in 1832, ‘In Asia the fiend was contemplated by us with curiosity—in the wilds of Russia, with suspicion—in Germany, with alarm—but on English soil, with TERROR!’90 The experience of tackling cholera in India from 1817 to 1821 came in handy and those measures were imported to England.91 During the 1848 outbreak, measures to combat the epidemic included ‘cholera belts’, flannel or woollen belts to be worn around the belly, as per an army manual. Called ‘kummerbunds’ in India, these were widely worn by military folk in the late nineteenth century to prevent abdominal chills supposedly associated with cholera.92 In 1854, a year of high cholera mortality, a public debate focussed on the question ‘Which Is Worse – War or Cholera?’93 Military deaths during the conflict-ridden years between 1793 and 1815 amounted to around 20,000; in contrast, in 1848–49 alone, cholera killed over 70,000. Expenses on sanitation and war were compared with each other to make an argument for greater expenditure on public health measures. Those efforts arguably did yield results in ending cholera but not before it had claimed close to 200,000 lives in the nineteenth century.94 Spain was the worst hit by cholera in western Europe, where the death toll amounted to around 600,000 over four waves, occasionally bringing the reigning monarch to the streets to show solidarity with the suffering public.95 Cholera claimed around 300,000 lives in France in the nineteenth century. When it first arrived there in 1832, it killed 7,000 in Paris within three weeks. Significantly, it killed two important political leaders, one a supporter of the monarchy and another who opposed it, sparking riots and the June 1832 Rebellion. In Brest, fishermen in 1832 looked at cholera as a punishment from God. Generally, the cholera epidemics led to a religious revival in Catholic Marseilles.96 It also prompted charity from unexpected quarters. Dwarkanath Tagore (1794–1846), a Calcutta-based Indian businessman and philanthropist, and grandfather of Nobel Prize–winning poet Rabindranath Tagore, donated money to the cause of cholera victims\n\nin France, thereby projecting moral parity with the Europeans.97 Cholera’s sweep across Europe was wide, hurting Hungary and Germany extensively. As urban sanitation, water supplies and sewage systems improved, cholera outside Russia receded from the 1870s onwards.98 Sporadic outbreaks continued, including one in 1892 in Hamburg, Germany, caused by a contaminated water supply, but that only reconfirmed the role of water contamination in spreading the disease. Cholera’s impact on Europe also led to its eventual downfall. Russia would provide the inspiration for the intravenous treatment of cholera, Britain the water-borne transmission theory, France and Germany the bacteriological revolution, and Italy and Spain would discover the vibrio and the vaccine, though both discoveries would be overlooked at the time.\n\nThe Americas Cholera first arrived in the Americas through trans-Atlantic sailing routes in the 1830s. As in Europe, the outbreaks ended in most places around the 1860s.99 It lingered in Mexico and Cuba until the 1880s and in Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina for even longer. By the end of the nineteenth century, there had been over 500,000 deaths due to cholera in the Americas. Cases first appeared in Quebec in Canada in 1832, brought on ships carrying cholera-infected immigrants from Britain.100 While some ships were quarantined, the disease still managed to slip through, and was blamed on the easterly winds blowing in from the infected atmosphere of Europe.101 Over 1,000 died within a few weeks.102 After that, across the eastern seaboard of North and South America, trans-Atlantic and coastal traffic would bring cholera to various ports, from where it would make its journey inwards through transport networks, especially waterways. The US suffered significant nationwide outbreaks in 1832, 1849 and 1866 and even lost a former president, James K. Polk (1795– 1849), to the disease only months after he vacated the top post.103 When cholera first arrived in the US in 1832, a newspaper reported\n\nthe event as follows, with the headline ‘The Destroying Angel Has Reached America’: It is with feelings of no ordinary nature, that we announce to our readers the alarming fact that the India CHOLERA, that dreadful scourge of Asia & Europe, which has swept off, it is thought, at least fifty millions of human beings, has reached the shores of America, and is already carrying death and desolation before it.104 The exaggerated death toll in the article notwithstanding, ‘India Cholera’ (like the ‘Chinese virus’ in 2020) caused substantial alarm and mass movement in the US. When it hit New York in 1832, the richer folk left the city just as the ‘inhabitants of Pompeii fled when the red lava showered down upon their houses’, reported one newspaper.105 Business dried up and according to one painter’s description, there was no work to be found barring that done by ‘Doctors, Undertakers, Coffinmakers’; the streets had fallen silent.106 Over 3,500 died in New York, which was around 2 per cent of the city’s population. When cholera went southwards to the plantations, it affected the African-American slaves, whose masters blamed the high mortality rates on their habit of not eating during the day but ‘eating enormously very late at night’.107 Such observations were common around the world where the victims were blamed for lack of appropriate behaviour during an epidemic. Cholera made a dramatic entry in Cuba in 1833, quickly overwhelming the two cemeteries of Havana and spreading further, wiping out over 20,000 or 3 per cent of the Cuban population.108 Cuba would face an outbreak again in the 1850s, disproportionately affecting its slave population. Plantation owners also suffered as the fields were left desolate. Cholera affected other islands of the Caribbean unevenly as quarantines were implemented with greater vigour; Puerto Rico succeeded in escaping almost entirely, except for an outbreak in 1854–55. A church in San Juan interpreted the event as a punishment from above for ‘excesses, vices, and public and private scandals’.109\n\nIn Mexico, the arrival of cholera in 1833 coincided with civil war (due to which Texas was eventually lost in 1836) and very soon the disease had claimed more lives than the fighting.110 This was in contrast to Guatemala, which had anticipated the epidemic after it hit the US in 1832 and had imposed a strict quarantine despite opposition from political opponents and merchants, thus saving itself from the outbreak.111 Mexico reacted late, only after cholera struck Cuba in February 1833, and political uncertainties delayed the action required to contain the epidemic. Civil war broke out in May just as the first cholera cases began appearing via the ports. Soon, town after town suffered from cholera, with those who pushed the ‘death carts’ wearily making the rounds. One local tale described how a French tailor who lay unconscious on the ground was carted to the burial ground but as per custom, was not buried because he was picked up on the last round of the day.112 The story said that he was actually alive and eventually walked back to his house, much to the amazement of the townspeople the next day. Such stories were told in Mexico for several decades as cholera entered the common vocabulary. Brazil felt the effect of the disease only in 1855, leading some to speculate until then that it was cholera-resistant because of equatorial heat or the long distance that separated it from Europe.113 The illusion was broken when cholera struck the city of Belem, along the equator, initiating ‘the blackest page in the medical history of Brazil’ as one chronicler in 1873 put it, since over 200,000 died in 1855–56.114 Belem alone lost 4 per cent of its population. As reported by the British consul based in the city, cholera was ‘chiefly confined to the negro, the mixed races, and the Indians’.115 Public charities received orphaned infants in the havoc, which also claimed the life of the acting governor of the province, who was seen healthy in the morning but was dead by the afternoon. Farms lay desolate as people either died or deserted them, and as one doctor described, ‘all was confusion, all was horror’.116 One of the consequences of the large loss of labour was that the government, which had banned slave imports in 1850, became more open to encouraging European immigration. The great migration from Europe to Brazil that\n\noccurred in the late nineteenth century thus had some roots in the crisis created by cholera. This is useful in understanding a central paradox of cholera in the Americas, that is, why it began receding in the late nineteenth century at the same time that mass immigration from Europe picked up. Cholera receded after the 1860s presumably because of a better understanding of the nature of the disease, but its ravages in the prior decades also contributed to a greater demand for European immigrants.\n\nAfrica and Asia Cholera would skim the coasts of Africa, from around Madagascar on the south-eastern end, all the way north and west to Senegal.117 Traders, troops and pilgrims to Mecca would be seen as the transmitters of the disease that killed around 1 million people in the nineteenth century. The bulk of those victims were in Egypt, where cholera took over 100,000 lives each year in 1831, 1855 and 1865, and many thousands in other years until 1902.118 Like in Russia, it is likely that cholera became partly endemic in the region. Egypt’s unique location, close to the intersection of three continents, and the fact that the seaport, Suez, oversaw traffic between the west and the east through a canal, certainly exposed it to epidemic risks. Along with cholera, Egypt also had to battle the plague in the early nineteenth century. When cholera first appeared in Cairo in 1831, it killed 40,000 people, or over 10 per cent of the city’s population, within a month.119 Panic led to mass flight as camel processions left the city. Enraged, the ruler, Muhammad Ali Pasha, later dismissed the medical officers who had abandoned the city during the crisis. But mass desertions continued to take place in later outbreaks as well. The cholera pandemic had its greatest impact on the African continent in the 1860s. Tunisia was badly affected and the cholera crisis led to people shunning the ruling elite. Historians have argued that this later contributed to the French annexation of Tunisia in 1881.120 Senegal, Algeria, Ethiopia and Somalia were also affected by cholera in the 1860s. The outbreak in Zanzibar city and island in\n\n1869–70, among the worst recorded anywhere, wiped out 10–20 per cent of the local population, or some 40,000 people.121 This outbreak was carefully recorded by a doctor called James Christie who provided important evidence on the east African slave trade that compounded the crisis and also the water-borne nature of the disease.122 In Asia, outside India, cholera made its presence felt in the Arabian peninsula, with regular outbreaks in the holy city of Mecca until 1912, after which it became cholera-free.123 Pilgrims, as will be seen later, were blamed in large part for spreading cholera to different corners and an elaborate quarantine system was implemented in response. In Iran, public baths or hammams, among other reasons, were blamed for the cholera crises.124 East Asia suffered sporadically all through but had its worst moments in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Burma all had their periods of sorrow, and it is likely that cholera had become endemic in some of those regions. One 2019 study argues that cholera was endemic in Japan in the late nineteenth century and that the country did not suffer repeated outbreaks brought from outside, as has long been argued, but from within.125 From 1817 onwards, cholera affected humans across most continents, touching the whole world at some point or the other, barring perhaps south-west Africa and Oceania. But what exactly caused cholera and which factors led to its transmission? It would be the ultimate medical whodunit of the nineteenth century that would play itself out in the high stakes of imperial scientific competition. In many ways, though, it is also a question that has not been fully answered yet.\n\nSanitation versus Contagion In the late 1830s, a young English woman, Julia Charlotte Maitland (1808–1864), travelled across south India and wrote letters describing her new surroundings in great detail. She described a particular cholera outbreak raging near Rajahmundry, twenty days\n\nafter 100,000 people had assembled there for a grand festival that was held once in twelve years, as follows: When I arrived in the town I was fast asleep in my palanquin, and was literally awakened by the horrible stench … There is little fear of cholera among Europeans, except in travelling. It is caused among the poor natives by bad feeding, dirt, and exposure to the climate … The poor natives go on beating their tom-toms, or drums, all night, in hope of driving it away; and the want of rest weakens them, and makes them still more liable to catch it.126 Her observation summarizes the prevailing view of that time: that cholera was synonymous with poverty and that climatic factors and insanitary conditions were the cause of cholera. Since climatic factors were outside one’s control, better sanitation was seen as the best way to prevent cholera. The corollary was that the disease was not passed through humans, and the most obvious implication was that quarantines were ineffective. This was what Benjamin Moseley had in mind in 1800, as seen in the previous chapter. There were three clearly discernible positions on cholera held before 1860, described by the historian Christopher Hamlin as ‘contagionism’, ‘positivist anti-contagionism’ and ‘miasmatist anticontagionism’.127 On the question of whether the disease was internal, the positivists maintained that diet was an important factor whereas the other two maintained it was caused by an external factor. On the origins, the contagionists were unsure but the miasmatists maintained that climatic factors were of paramount importance. On transmission, the miasmatists argued that the disease moved due to the changing conditions of the atmosphere or soil while the contagionists insisted on human carriers. Finally, there was an important question that contagionists were always asked: why did the disease attack some and not all in places where cholera appeared? Surely, contagious diseases should have been passed on to doctors, but that was rarely the case. In one incident in Russia, a few villagers abducted two doctors on duty who espoused quarantine, tied them to cholera corpses and placed\n\nthem in a pit.128 Their survival would be proof against contagion. In that particular case, they did survive and were eventually pulled out of the pit. The contagionists argued that survival depended on how exposed one was to the disease while the miasmatists argued that people differed in their predisposition to the disease. The evidence in favour of the contagionists was that outbreaks were often noted after the arrival of a person infected with the disease, a fact that the miasmatists found hard to explain with their pet theory of a change in climate. As for other diseases, contagionism was widely accepted as an explanation for smallpox but the history of the plague over centuries had also led to debates similar to those over cholera. Scientific developments in the late nineteenth century convincingly turned the tide towards contagionism, albeit with a lot of resistance and theatrics. Cholera provided this spark as the leading minds of the day wanted to decipher the disease. In 1849, John Snow (1813–1858), a doctor from Yorkshire in England who had seen the cholera visitations of the 1830s, published a short pamphlet titled On the Mode of Communication of Cholera.129 The pamphlet started with an assertion of cholera being contagious and also noted that ‘many eminent men hold an opposite opinion’. Ruling out transmission via blood poisoning, he likened the disease to those caused by ‘intestinal worms’ in acting directly on the alimentary canal and in the significance of the excretions.130 One of the mysteries of cholera was how the disease could affect people in quarters distant from those who were sick. Snow posited a faecal"
