We had left England in the early evening, from an airport near Bristol; being little, I was in the care of Helena Palmela, daughter of the Portuguese Ambassador in London at the time and I remember there were two other passengers, spies maybe â¦. and many, many enormous bags, mail, no doubt? It was dark in the plane. We stopped in Shannon, Ireland and then took off on a wide arc over the Atlantic before arriving, safely, at the recently opened Portela airport, in Lis- bon, where my Mother awaited me. Today one lands at the same air- port, still in the middle of the City but somewhat larger. How could I imagine how the story would unfold? My youth progressed as planned without any hiatus or intervention on my part; in those days children were not asked what they wanted to study. All decisions were left up to their elders and betters and strictly adhered to. In 1958 I was lucky enough to meet and marry a brilliant scientist, a visionary, âa man for all seasonsâ, who at the same time enjoyed the social side of life, he loved giving parties. Together we travelled the World, first by necessity but later we managed to fit in trips to the most beautiful spots for pleasure. Ivan enjoyed talking to his children and, later, his grandchildren, as adults, none of their questions were ever left unanswered, he seemed to know everything. He adored me and we lived happily, complementing each other, for 45 years. With him, I en- joyed the full life I had dreamt of. The year following our marriage we founded Hovione â my husband was the researcher, the producer, the analyst and the salesman and I looked after the paperwork and the money, where he had no interest or knowledge. Each of us had our field of responsibility and thus it lasted until his death in 2003. How many times was I asked âAnd youâre\n\nP:10\n\nThe first 50 years still married after working together for 20, 30 or 40 years?â Appar- ently unheard of! But it is a fact; we never had an argument about work. Sometimes, when money was short I would mention it and, lo and behold, within a few days he would come up with an order for some steroid. In those days the price per gram was such that even an order for 200 grams was ample for our needs for quite a time. Thanks to much hard work, excellent timing, profound technical knowledge, a high level of rigor throughout the Firm and a little bit of luck, Hovione grew and developed into an internationally known and respected brand. None of this happened by chance. From day one, we took the decision that the World would be our market, and we were well aware of what this implied. The beginning was not easy. I remem- ber well prospective clients coming to the Firm and leaving without concluding business because our prices were not competitive. My husband would reply, âOur quality is higher than that of the competi- tion and we deliver on timeâ. Decades later, these values have paid back, and many times over! Today, clients come to us from all sectors of the pharmaceutical in- dustry precisely because we maintain these principles. Today given the rate at which technology evolves and change occurs, we need stable principles anchored in tradition and corporate culture. Strategies have to be long term, objectives ambitious, values crystal clear, manage- ment professional and the whole team motivated and aligned. It is the story of these 50 years that we have endeavoured to de- scribe in this book. More important than the chronology of the facts, we have tried to express the vision and ideals of the Founder â Ivan Villax. His objective was excellence and rigor. A fighter who never gave up, who took on every challenge that he believed in and considered he could overcome, a father who had time for all, a leader who listened to\n\nP:11\n\n8 everyoneâs problems and, insofar as possible, helped all who worked with him. The Second Generation stands by the same principles and lives the unchanged Hovione values in a radically different world and industry. There is a new style, and the leadership is now a team made up of dedicated specialists â but the vigour, the enthusiasm and the optimism is the same as ever. A family firm has that great advantage of being able to plan for the long term as it has time on its side and is here to stay. What more can I say â I thank God for all he has given me, a com- plete life which continues as full as on the first day, for despite the years I insist on knowing all that is going on at our sites in Portugal, New Jersey, Macau, China and now Ireland; what our plans for the future are and how we expect to achieve them.

Hovione grade product crystals â controlled crystallization\n\nP:13\n\n10 11 Introduction The 1st 50 years of Hovioneâs history have been very exciting, full of challenge and satisfaction. Anyone that has ever worked at Hovione cannot forget the energy, the passion and the rigor in the quest for customersâ smiles. The company started business in a world upon which an iron cur- tain had descended. And the safe harbor from which this company sprung was Portugal, a country with a great history, friendly people and amazing weather â but not an obvious launch pad for a fine chem- ical technology based international business. But for Hovione, from day one, the world was its oyster â our outlook was always global. Somehow, with only telexes and airmail, Hovione built an international business and was on the ball with patents in all the major markets. If we take the two families of compounds Ivan Villax picked âand listed in his 1979 catalogue (corticosteroids and semi-synthetic compounds) â these still account for a third of the companyâs sales 30 years later. In 1979 Deng Xiao Ping rolled out Chinaâs âopen door policyâ and Hovione set its sights on Asia; in 1989 the Berlin wall collapsed and Ivan Villax returned to his Alma-Mater in Budapest. In the last 20 years we have seen globalization and free-trade take over much of the World, indeed my first job was selling APIs to India, to the likes of Cipla, Ran- baxy and Lupin. So much had changed. Hovione has always had a good sense of timing, and has always been original in its thinking. The raison dÂ´Ãªtre of the company has been to turn every challenge that clients bring to us into a solution,\n\nP:14\n\nThe first 50 years and -through close collaboration- we have made sure their great med- icines make it to the market and have an assured supply. Hovione in its first 25 years was a company of chemists and chemi- cal engineers â brilliant research and rigorous production made sure the company grew and was successful. The company had great prod- ucts and patents, the Chemicals Abstracts were our yellow pages, and customers flew to Lisbon from as far as California and Japan and rang our door bell. During those times the genius, instinct and charisma of Ivan Villax made up for the MBA he never attended; Human Resources was not uppermost in his mind, sales and marketing was what Uni- lever did with toothpaste, and finance was something his wife Diane dealt with marvelously. Ivan was all about sound science, process patents and good engi- neering. He made sure elegant processes were executed routinely and that a dedicated team made sure every detail was addressed to per- fection. He wanted customers to be satisfied so they would came back for more. The first 25 years set the foundations for the following 25. The cap- ital accumulated during the profitable Japanese corticosteroid years was invested in research into semi-synthetic tetracyclines and in new plant capacity. The next market was the USA and we provided APIs to the growing US Generics industry. Most of the staff joined Hovione without previous work experience. Ivan wanted them keen to learn and free of bad habits. He led by exam- ple, and out of this team grew capable managers and talented scientists who expanded Hovione and took its values to Europe, America and China â and made sure every year sales grew and remained profitable. Managing growth is difficult. Investing in capacity, controlling costs and adding management skills at the same time is a tall order, and to make sure we stay ahead of the game by being early adopters of what-\n\nP:15\n\n12 13 ever it is that makes a difference, is a stiff cocktail. This is what we have been doing for the last 20 years, this is why anyone that has worked at Hovione, or with Hovione, has kept fond memories. Today the pharmaceutical industry is facing challenges. We believe one of the necessary solutions involves handing over its manufactur- ing to specialists. This is Hovioneâs mission for the next few decades â to become the NÂº 1 innovative, integrated, solution provider to the global pharmaceutical industry. We will have the methods, breadth and depth to develop the processes and manufacture to the standards that the best pharma clients demand for their products. We will serve every segment that requires demanding know-how, fast and faultless execution and exacting rigor â for that is what we do well. The next fifty years will be no different â the cocktail still includes sound science, rigor, passion â but the intensity of competition, the range of necessary disciplines, the depth of understanding, the ability and speed to execute, the degree of complexity will grow to unprece- dented heights. But again nothing really changes, the only competitive advantage that truly endures is our ability to learn and to re-invent ourselves. Guy Villax Chief Executive June 2009\n\nP:16\n\n1. The first 50 years Diane Villax Ivan and How it all began Diane and Ivan Villax â Lisbon, 1957\n\nP:17\n\n14 15 HovioneÂ´s story is diverse and rich â from the intricate and eventful beginnings of Ivan VillaxÂ´s research and all important patents, to the profes- sionally managed multi-local company of today, Hovione is a company with a story to tell. With sustained growth throughout its 5 decades, Hovione has its very own culture, and is a brand that has provided better health to many millions around the world. What we find at Hovione is a sense of mission and rigour that we, as citizens, demand and expect from the pharmaceutical industry. At Hovione one finds a sense of constant dedication and technical competence at all levels and in all areas. The Company maintains a healthy balance between the original guid- ing principles and the ever increasing challenges of a fast changing World. The beginning of this 50 year account is based on the family who established the companyâs foundations and the values which, as we will see, have been present all along. Ivan Villax Hovioneâs main reference and guiding force is Ivan Villax, born on 16th April 1925 in the important agricultural town of Ma- gyarÃ³vÃ¡r in Hungary, now MosonmaygÃ¡- rovar. This town situated in Pannonia, the vast plain in Western Hungary, had been a rich agricultural region since the days of the Roman Empire. Ivanâs mother came from a traditional land-owning Austro-Hungarian family. His father was an eminent academic in plant genetics. Ivan Villaxâs maternal family di- vided its interests between the fertile land on the shores of the Danube and in real- estate. Indeed the soil on their land was suitable for the manufacture of bricks, so one thing let to another. Ivan Villax c. 1928\n\nP:18\n\nThe first 50 years MagyarÃ³vÃ¡r, located 50 kilometres East of Vienna, was the site of the oldest higher educational institute in Europe dedicated to agronomical studies, foun- ded in 1797. ÃdÃ¶n Villax (1899-1964), Ivanâs father, held a Chair at the Univer- sity, and wrote more than two dozen scientific books. After the Second World War, with Hungary on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain, Ivan Villaxâs family chose to leave the country. They were landowners, openly anti-communist and the science of genetics clashed head-on with Marxist ideology. Professor Villax was advised to either limit voicing his opi- nions or leave the country, the alternative being a one-way ticket to Siberia. In September 1948 the Villaxes departed for Austria. They left by the dark of night. Ivanâs parents and two younger brothers in a horse drawn carriage, he and his brother Edmond went separately by bicycle. At one moment in their flight they had to take cover in a chicken pen whilst the frontier guards were taken to the local pub by several of Professor Villaxâs loyal local workers. They never stopped till they reached the American Zone in Western Austria. After a stay of several months in Salzburg, Professor ÃdÃ¶n Villax was in- vited to work by the French Government in Clermont-Ferrand at a scientific research station working on plant genetics. His work there led to a publica- tion in Nature 177, pp 412-413), in 1953, he authored âBehaviour of a Triticum x Secale hybrid under the action of colchicineâ.

The family settled in Elvas, where the Professor would work at the National Station for Hungary, c. 1933 the Improvement of Plants for the next 10 years. Professor Villax continued his scientific work in Portugal, publishing many papers under the name of Edmond Joseph Villax. His most important work entitled âLa culture des plantes fourragÃ¨res dans la rÃ©gion mediterranÃ©enne occidentaleâ, beautifully illustrated in colour with his own drawings, was to become a bible for many Portuguese agronomists.\n\nP:20\n\nThe first 50 years Ivan Villaxâs diploma of Chemical Engineering, translation of school book and diploma of PhD in Chemistry Ivan Villaxâs early research and work at the Instituto Pasteur de Lisboa From an early age, Ivan decided he had no intention of following the family tradition of agronomy or architecture. His option was to read Chemical Engi- neering at the Budapest Technical University. His family did not exactly sup- port this initiative so Ivan Villax was on its own from the start. Despite an in- terregnum during the War years, Ivan concluded his higher education in Hungary in June 1948. Ivan used to say that he had left his country, aged 23, with a toothbrush in one pocket, his university degree in the other, and the Russians at his heels. After several months in a displaced personsâ camp in Salzburg, Ivan Villax accompanied his family to Clermont-Ferrand, France, where he concluded a Maitrise (MSc) in Microbiology. His work consisted in the study of the ink di- sease of chestnut trees. During this period, he started to work on the isolation of micro-organisms with antibacterial properties and after years of selection\n\nP:21\n\n18 19 Arrival of Ivan Villax with his parents at Lisbon airport, December 1951\n\nP:22\n\nThe first 50 years IIvan Villax â Instituto Pasteur de Lisboa, 50âs\n\nP:23\n\nand mutation, by the time he was living in Portugal, he obtained a strain which 20 21 produced tetracycline to which he gave the name, Streptomyces lusitanus var. Ivan Villaxâs synthetic route tetraciclini, the basis for his US Patent No. 3432394. Reference to this strain to penicillin appears later in this story in relation to a patent litigation case where his laboratory notebooks, dating back to the years in Clermont-Ferrand, were fundamental to its favourable outcome. His parents were, by now, living in Elvas, Portugal, and in order to reco- ver from a serious motorbike accident, Ivan came to stay towards the end of 1951. At their insistence, he decided to contact three local laboratories and was offered a job at the Instituto Pasteur de Lisboa (IPL), at the time an im- portant centre for research in the country, unrelated to the Paris based Institut Pasteur. By 1952, when he started work at the IPL, Ivan Villax was clear about the field he wanted to work in: antibiotics, which luckily coincided with his em- ployersâ objectives and he was allowed to proceed with his research interests. Ivanâs first inventions were in the field of chloramphenicol, a broad spec- trum antibiotic, and in the development of fermentation processes of tetracy- clines. In 1956/57, he developed a synthetic process for the manufacture of penicillin. This was a significant scientific development for those days, how- ever the price of fermented penicillin was more competitive and in the end the synthetic route was found not to be economically viable.\n\nP:24\n\nThe first 50 years Ivan Villax made good use of Professor Maia Loureiroâs innovative equip- ment for aerobic submerged fermentation. He focused his research into the antibacterial micro-organisms that he had brought from France. This re- search resulted in process patents and Villaxâs employment contract with IPL provided that these would be applied for in both his and IPLâs name. The Por- tuguese rights to such patents belonged to IPL, however with respect to the rest of the World, should IPL not turn such patent rights into a business with- in 6 months of grant, the rights reverted to Ivan Villax to exploit as he saw fit. It was to be this specific clause that enabled much of Hovioneâs business during the Companyâs first years. One of Ivan Villaxâs early patents, PT33.310 dated 1957, described a new compound, PantofenicolÂ®, a complex of a broad spectrum antibiotic â chlo- ramphenicol â with sodium pantothenate. This compound had the advantage of overcoming the serious side effects of chloramphenicol and therefore be- came a commercial success in Portugal and, later, in several European coun- tries. This was but the beginning of over 600 patents applied for by Ivan Villax, alone or as co-author, in Portugal and throughout the world. Cuttings from Portuguese newspapers,1957, referring to the Synthesis of Penicillin in Portugal\n\nP:25\n\n22 23 The Antibiotic industry in the aftermath of World War II Discovered by Sir Alexander Fleming, thanks to a series of coincidences, antibiotics created a revolution in the field of medicine and the world of pharmaceuticals after the end of World War II. The first antibiotic, penicillin, resulted from a fungus. Fleming noticed that a certain culture of bacteria, did not develop when contaminated by this fungus. In 1922, Fleming discovered that human secretions, such as saliva and tears contained an antibacterial substance, lysozime. In 1928, on looking through some old cultures before discarding them, he discovered that a colony of a certain fungus had sponta- neously grown in Petri dishes seeded with Staphylococcus aureus. This fungus was later identified as Penicillium notatum. As World War II continued to escalate, Sir Howard Florey and Ernst Chain from the Uni- versity of Oxford succeeded in isolating penicillin for therapeutic means in 1940 thereby saving many lives of those who would otherwise have died from infected wounds. But production in significant quantities was only possible thanks to a Portuguese in- vention by Prof. Maia Loureiro. Quoting Ivan Villax in his text âEstratÃ©gias empresariais para a Bio-Economia (23/11/2001) The production of the first antibiotic â penicillin â got a great thrust forward by the introduction of the process involving aero- bic submerged fermentation, invented and patented by a Por- tuguese scientist, Prof. Maia Loureiro, who used this method for the preparation of vaccines. During the Second World War, he visited Fleming and Florey in England to introduce this tech- nique in the production of penicillin. At that time the Instituto Pasteur de Lisboa, where Ivan Villax started in 1952, was virtually the only company doing any research in Portugal. In many ways the history of the IPL and antibiotics coincides with that of Ivan Villax. During the late forties, when Ivan Villax was working in France, specifically on fungi research, selecting strains with antibacterial activity, he understood the importance of this field, and that the timing was right for the scientific and commercial development of antibiotics. Combining science with a business sense, Ivan Villax worked on the development and scale up of these fermentation processes. His plan was to license out his strains and processes to fermentation manufacturers.\n\nP:26\n\nThe first 50 years Diane Villax The Du Boulays were a Huguenot family from Normandy that fled to England at the time of the Revocation of the Nantes Edict in 1685. Dianeâs paternal great grandfather, J.P. Hornung, was English, of Austro- -Hungarian origins. John Peter Hornung arrived in Lisbon, in the late 1870âs as the local representative of his familyâs shipping company. Shortly after, he mar- ried a young Portuguese girl, Laura de Paiva Raposo. Soon after his marriage he received the unfortunate news that his fatherâs firm had gone bankrupt, thanks to his partner fleeing with the cash, leaving him penniless. The Paiva Raposo family had a large land concession on the southern shore of the Zambezi river in Mozambique, and they suggested J.P. Hornung should go out and try to make a living from it. On his own, leaving his wife behind, and having no knowledge of Africa, he set off to plant sugar. The cane did well, there was ample water from the Zambezi and the timing was good as railways were beginning to be introduced in Africa, allowing the transport of large tonnage. Initially named Companhia de Assucar de MoÃ§ambique, the company was re- named Sena Sugar Estates after a local village called Sena, in Sofala in the early 20s. After years of pioneering work on the land, the factories of Marromeu and Luabo were built. On the 12th March 1909, the Refinaria Colonial, in Alcantara, was opened in the presence of D. Manuel II, the King of Portugal. This refinery had an initial annual capacity of 20,000 tons, producing both white and brown sugar, continuing to operate until 1994. It became a most successful company, J.P.

Hornung very prosperous. The firm went public in 1920 and was listed on the London Stock Exchange in the early 20s. During the first half of the 20th century Dianeâs family divided their life between Africa, on the plantation, in Lisbon where the refinery operated, and in London where the headquarters of the firm were located. . Dianeâs father, Barney Du Boulay, came to work in Portugal in 1933, when he was 23. He married Isabel Bleck de Lancastre in 1934, and Diane was born in Lisbon, the following January. However, the couple were to make England their main home where both of Dianeâs siblings, Peter and Philippa, were born. During World War II, Dianeâs father served as an officer in the Irish Guards. Her mother re- turned to Lisbon in 1943 and Diane followed in 1944. As from 1946, Dianeâs paternal grand- mother, Lady Elles, J.P. Hornungâs daughter, also came to live in Lisbon and her influence was most important during Dianeâs formative years. Diane was a boarder at the Dominican con- vent in RamalhÃ£o, Sintra from January 1945 to June 1950 and then spent two years at the French LycÃ©e, in Lisbon. In addition to her lan- guages, fluent in English, Portuguese and French, Diane took a Secretarial Course in Lon- don where she learnt to type, take shorthand and a smattering of bookkeeping which would come in very useful when Hovione was esta- blished. Laura Paiva Raposo Hornung with her 3 eldest children, including Blanche Elles, Dianeâs grandmother (right)\n\nP:28\n\nThe first 50 years On 2nd November 1954, Diane started work as a trilingual secretary at Crocker, Delaforce, a company set up by an Englishman, Cyril Crocker, in 1946. They were importers of a range of goods, from electronics to non-ferrous metals, pharmaceutical specialities and shipping agents. Her 3 years experience, until she left in October 1957, taught her all about the business side of a firm, banking, invoices, import licences, bookkeeping, commercial correspondence, quotes and orders.

The Sixties An auspicious start Ivan Villax patents\n\nP:31\n\n28 29 The founding of Hovione A year after the marriage of Ivan and Diane Villax, Hovione was establi- shed. During the first years â HOVIONE â Sociedade Industrial e Comercial de Produtos QuÃ­micos, Lda., operated from their home at Travessa do Moinho de Vento, nÂº 6, in Lisbon. It had a licence to operate as an âAgent or repre- sentative for foreign or local manufacturers of medicinal chemical productsâ and was incorporated on the 8th April 1959, with a capital of Esc. 210,000-, about USD7,500- . There were three equal partners: Nicolau de Horthy, Diane Villax e Andrew Onody, thus forming the name HOVIONE. Ivan Villax, in those days still an employee of the Instituto Pasteur de Lisboa (IPL), only entered formally as a partner in 1961. The reason for creating the company arose at the beginning of 1959. Nicolau de Horthy and Andrew Onody, both of Hungarian origin, arrived in Lisbon in March with a proposal for the IPL. They were friends of other Hungarians, owners of Fermentfarma S.p.A, a newly established fermentation plant in Corsico, Milan, a manufacturer of chlortetracycline, and were looking for dis- tributors for the Iberian PenÃ­nsula. Official document certifying incorporation of Hovione, 8th April 1959\n\nP:32\n\nThe first 50 years Ivan Villax in the lab. 50âs It so happened that Ivan Villax was already developing processes for the production of chlortetracycline and tetracycline by fermentation at the IPL, having several granted patents in this field. However, due to serious financial difficulties which would, eventually, result in the sale of the company in 1960 to Wyeth Laboratories, the Instituto Pasteur was not in a position to enter into such a collaboration despite the rights it held over Villaxâs research work. Such rights lapsed after a 6 monthsâ option period, and Villax became free to make use of the foreign patent rights. This proved to be of immense value to the newly formed Hovione. Despite IPLâs refusal, the proposal remained open. Ivan accepted the chal- lenge and Hovione was formed. In order to raise money for the required capital, Diane sold 500 shares of Sena Sugar Estates which she had recently received from her grandmother, and was able to subscribe to a third of the issued capital. The partnership with these two Hungarians provided two business oppor- tunities. On the one side, Hovione would distribute in Portugal chlorotetracy- cline manufactured in Milan and, on the other, Fermentfarma would be able to make use of Ivan Villaxâs know-how and patents. In exchange for his patent rights Ivan Villax would become a shareholder in the Italian firm. Patent law in Italy was different to that of most other countries; since the days of Mussolini, it did not extend protection over medicines. However, Fer- mentfarma was anxious to export, namely to the USA. Therefore, when Horthy and Onody became aware of the fact that Villax had his own patented know- -how for the production of antibiotics, specifically tetracyclines, they realised that a licence negotiated with Fermentfarma would be of great value, the Villax independent processes would allow it to access export markets without fearing infringement suits. Hovione would therefore sell the Italian products\n\nP:33\n\n30 31 in Portugal and, simultaneously enable the Milanese Company to export to other markets. Nicolau de Horthy and Andrew Onody remained partners in Hovione until 1963, more than doubling their initial investment in 4 years. Ivan Villax re- mained a partner in Fermentfarma until it was sold to an American company in 1967. Hungarians in Italy, the Fermentarma years, 1960-67 Since his escape from Hungary, Ivan Villax had lost his nationality, and constantly travelling on an Alien Passport, was troublesome. Ivan applied to become Portuguese in 1960, by then it was clear he had decided that his fu- ture was to be in Portugal. Nevertheless, his origins played an important part at the beginning of his business. In addition to Horthy and Onody, all the other board members of Fermentfarma were of Hungarian origin or spoke Hungarian. Contract between Ivan VillaxÂ´s first contact with Fermentfarma took place in June 1960 when Fermentfarma S.p.a. he was present during a complete production cycle and able to see for him- and Hovione , self to what extent their technology was lacking. Many batches were ruined September 1960 and had to be discarded, incurring substantial losses. In view of this unsatis- factory situation, Dr. Rado Rakusa, the president, invited Ivan to take over pro- duction, giving him carte blanche to go forward and make whatever alterations he saw fit. The licensing of Villaxâs patents and his know-how in the field were worked out to represent a 12% share in Fermentfarmaâs capital and he was appointed Technical Director.\n\nP:34\n\nThe first 50 years In order to improve the process and yields Villax had to spend long periods in Milan. From September to December 1961 and from March to June 1962, the Villax family, already including the two young boys, moved to a house on the hills overlooking Lake Como and Ivan commuted daily to Milan. During that period, he ensured production was carried out according to his own pro- cesses. He made sure everyone realised the importance of following the pro- cess rigorously and complying with strict procedures. Armindo Santos, who had recently joined Hovione from IPL, and his wife, Angelina, Villaxâs laboratory assistant at the institute for 9 years, spent ten months in Italy ensuring that the new processes were properly industrialized and became robust, thus enabling stable and ever-improving yields. During this period, Hovione, in Lisbon, although tiny with 4 employees, continued its research work. The Italian company thrived and became an important exporter, to the ex- tent that by 1967, their licensee Rachelle Laboratories, of Long Beach, Cali- fornia, decided to buy the company. Ivanâs share in the sale, in return, gave him the possibility to start the construction of Hovioneâs first building in its current site, in Loures, just North of Lisbon . As part of the Fermentfarma sale however, Villax accepted to stop all work in the field of fermentation. From then onwards, his research was directed exclusively to chemical synthesis. The first patent court case Results obtained with Patents were all important to Hovione from its beginning. strain of streptomyces Amongst many of his patents, PT37.424, applied for in 1960, became out- lusitanos var. tetracycline standingly significant. This patent was abandoned in Portugal in 1979 after 19 year of opposition, although its equivalents were granted in, amongst other countries, the USA (US3432394) Germany, Canada, France, the United King- dom, Ireland and Switzerland. This patent claimed a process for the production of tetracycline free from chlortetracycline, based on the selection and mutation of strains of micro- -organisms, specifically of the Streptomyces family. This was research work that Ivan Villax had started back in Clermont-Ferrand, France and that led to the selection of a strain denominated Streptomyces lusita- nus var. tetraciclini, deposited at the NCIB under number 9500, which produced commercially viable quantities of tetracycline. The long opposition was by American Cyanamid. The American company opposed this claim, invoking priority and alleging in fact that there was no other micro-organism capable of effectively producing tetra- cycline under those conditions. The UK litigation case got to the High Court, in London where American Cya- namid accused a client of Fermentfarmaâs, Berk Phar- maceuticals Ltd., of infringing their patent.\n\nP:35\n\n32 33 The Berk Story I first came into contact with Hovione, and to meet Ivan Villax, by a rather indirect route in the early 1970âs. Clients of mine, Berk Pharmaceuticals Ltd., were being sued for patent infringement in the UK by American Cyanamid Company. Cyanamid had a patent for a fermentation process for making tetracycline using some particular micro-organisms they had isolated and developed by mutation and selection, the invention residing in the fact that these were thought to be the first micro-organisms capable of producing tetracycline free of chlortetracycline which was a very valuable feature. Berkâs tetracycline was made in Italy by a company Fermentfarma. It came to light from enquiries of Fermentfarma that they also were using a micro-organism which produced tetracycline free of chlortetracycline, and further that this particular micro-organism had been developed many years previously by one, Ivan Villax, working in France. Cyanamid alleged that this process (and the Berk tetracycline produced using it) infringed their patent and accordingly brought an action against Berk to cease sales. The main thrust of Cyanamidâs case was that Ivanâs micro-organism was actually one of theirs, and it was necessary therefore for Berk to determine the provenance of the Fermentfarma micro-organism. These enquiries led to me being posted off to Lisbon to meet Ivan and to go through matters with him. This turned out to be the first of many visits, all of which were an immense pleasure in spite of being very hard work. It turned out that Ivan had developed the micro-organism strain (with his then employerâs permission) from some soil isolates obtained in France in the 1950âs for the purpose of studying the ink disease of chestnut trees! All his work on the antibiotic-producing strains, was continued over many years and recorded in his notebooks. Unfortunately, however, since he was fluent in at least six languages and used them all and his own unique shorthand in his notes, it was not immediately obvious (even sometimes to him!) what the notebooks said. They were eventually transcribed showing how, through multiple mutations each meticulously carried out, the desired tetracycline-producing strain was obtained. At the trial, these notebooks and Ivanâs personal testimony were the foundation of Berkâs eventual success in showing non-infringement. He was subjected to examination in court for four days and, despite the fiercest of attacks, he remained throughout the master of the situation. It was very remarkable and impressive, and despite attack after attack from Cyanamid, the judge accepted his evidence as completely accurate and honestly given. It was a complete vindication for him. As the judge noted, there was actually nothing for Ivan to gain from agreeing to appear at the trial at all since neither he nor Hovione had any financial interest of any sort in the outcome. But it was, of course, typical of him that his fierce pride and honesty would compel him to defend his name (which he did superbly), particularly against the accusations of a major pharmaceutical company. I spent many days with him in Portugal working on the notebooks, and subsequently over many years kept in professional contact with him, especially on his visits to London. To me, he was the most considerate and courteous of men, a giant in intellect, always with a warm twinkle in his eye. It was always such a pleasure to meet up with him and a singular privilege to have been able to work with him. Paul Wain, 1973 Paul was one of the defence lawyers who participated in the case and subsequently worked with Hovione as a patent lawyer.\n\nP:36\n\nThe first 50 years This was but the first example of Ivan Villaxâs persistence in defending what he believed in. It made no difference that he was up against legions of attorneys from the largest firms in the World, what mattered was that he was right. In 1962, realising the interest of his research work, he went to Chicago to deliver a communication at a scientific meeting entitled âAntibiotics and Che- motherapyâ. Abstract of Ivan Villax paper at the Chicago Conference, 1962 This first visit of Diane and Ivan Villax, together, to the U.S.A., was somewhat frightening, worthy of a thriller movie. Both in Chicago as well as in Washington D.C., they were obviously followed. When they had arrived at OâHare airport they were received by two men, in raincoats and hats, typical of those detective films of the 60s. They were escorted from the plane to an office where they were ques- tioned as to the reason for their visit, where they were going, who they were meeting. Their luggage was searched and the reason for Dianeâs bringing jewel- lery was asked. Having been invited to dine at the Portuguese Embassy in Wa- shington, it seemed normal to wear some jewellery was the answer, it sufficed. On entering their hotel room, the phone would ring, with no one at the other end, just a metallic click. They were followed to restaurants, by a large limou- sine; two men in dark glasses would sit down at a nearby table. Upon their ar- rival at the hotel, the receptionist would say âA gentleman has called, but did not leave his nameâ. It was nerve wracking; Europe seemed a long way awayâ¦ Years later Ivan Villax discovered that it was a situation of industrial espio- nage. The large pharmaceutical companies had been suffering from the lack of patents in Italy. There had been leaks and situations of stolen know-how finding its way most profitably to Italy, namely the Fox case. So they wanted to know whom Villax would be talking to in the States â this happened at the time of his work at Fermentfarma. However, indirectly, this trip would have very positive results. When in Wa- shington, Ivan Villax got a message that an American had turned up in Milan to talk to one of the directors at Fermentfarma. None were on site at the time so\n\nP:37\n\n34 35 George Kresk and Diane Villax in Long Beach, California, 1967 he returned to the States to meet with Mr. Villax. The gentleman was George Krsek, a director of Rachelle Laboratories, Long Beach, California. Rachelle was owned by International Rectifier, which had recently decided to commence the pro- duction of tetracycline. The Food and Drug Administration knew about Ivan Villax and his processes following the inspec- tion of Fermentfarmaâs plant in Milan. It was FDA that suggested to Krsek to approach Fermentfar- ma for advice. A licensing agreement was signed in 1963 and Villaxâs process was used in the tetra- cycline production in Long Beach. In fact, a few years later both Ivan and Diane Villax were invited to Los Angeles by Mr. Eric Lidow, the owner of In- ternational Rectifier. He made Mr. Villax a most enticing proposal: money no object, carte blanche, state of the art equipment, an irrefutable offer. However, Ivan Villax thanked him and said that, despite the disadvantages of working in Portugal, he was his own boss and that was not negotiable. After that first contract, further licenses were negotiated. Processes were licensed to National Fermentation Pty, of Johannesburg. Imperial Chemical In- dustries Ltd, Wilmslow, U.K. licensed a process to manufacture oxytetracycline. Technology transfer was already a challenge at that time. The first fermen- tation batches in California had very poor results. After long, inconclusive and frustrating reports and analyses â at a time when email, fax, or courier were unknown â and mail took at least a week to cross the Atlantic, it was suspected that in the end there might be a problem with the local water. As a result seve- ral cubic metres of Milan municipal water were flown to California to confirm whether or not water was at the root of the problem. Once ascertained, the problem was quickly resolved. A Cottage Industry During its first few years, Hovione was a small company, working in the centre of Lisbon, exporting all its production. Already at that time the Portu- guese market was too small to provide adequate returns for the development and manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients. It was key to export and to gain market share in as many countries as possible. This early commitment to globalization was not just due to the type of products involved. The multi-national origins of the Villaxes made them feel comfortable in any international setting. Their horizons were broad. They had no difficulty taking on the World as their natural market, although they never underestimated the challenges that such ambition implied in terms of com- pliance, quality, capacity and delivery.\n\nP:38\n\nThe first 50 years Hovione started with 5 employees at the beginning of the 60s and by 1967 had only 12 staff... But they were worth their weight in gold and long will they be remembered for their dedication, hard work and ambition to see the Com- pany succeed. Their names: Armando SimÃµes â started July 1960, Manuela Moura Leite â November 1960, LuÃ­s Armindo Santos â November 1960, Arlete Santos â 1960, Maria Angelina Santos â April 1961, Maria Rosado, Manuel Armando Moreira â September 1963 and they all stayed with the Firm for at least the next 30 years, with two completing over 40 years of service. It is important to point out that Angelina, Armindo, Maria Rosado, Arlete and, later Alberto Gomes, the fitter, all left the Instituto Pasteur de Lisboa â where they had a steady, guaranteed job â at Mr. Villaxâs invitation, to join an embryonic team in a newly founded firm with no assured future. They all refer to the rigour, hard work and high standards demanded but also to the per- sonal satisfaction derived from a job well done and appreciated, as well as admiration and respect for the boss, strict, yet so human. Although the group was small, it was definitely teamwork. The installa- tions operated out of a family home. Even at that early stage, the flexibility that has always been expected of Hovioneâs staff was already evident. Travessa do Moinho de Vento housed both office and family home until 1962. During those first two years, the main business was the importation of chlorotetracycline from Fermentfarma supplied to Cipan â the first invoice dates back to 24th September 1959. Diane and Ivan Villax in front of Travessa do Ferreiro, no. 3, 1969 The sale of tetracycline to Vietnam The year after Ivan Villax started work at Fermentfarma, Hovione was receiving tetracycline to pack and export to Vietnam. The Vietnam War was dragging on and under cover of a number of aid projects created at the end of World War II to boost European economies; Italy was entitled to export certain pharmaceuticals to battlegrounds where U.S. troops were engaged. At about this time, the Italian economic development came under review and this country was no longer deemed to meet the criteria. Hovione, exporting out of Portu-\n\nP:39\n\n36 37 gal, was entitled to take over the supplies, which Fermentfarma had been Peter OâNeill .Hovioneâs customer carrying out up till then. in Vietnam 1961, photo taken in Macau, 2006 The product arrived in bulk from Italy, was formulated into capsules by LaboratÃ³rios VitÃ³ria, and then packed in blisters by Neocel. These had to be inserted into individual packages, put into orange carton boxes and finally crated for shipment to Vietnam. The pharmaceutical importer and distribu- tor in Saigon was Peter OâNeill, a charming Irish American with whom the Villaxes have kept up with to this day. This production line took place on the Villax family dining room table, with all the family involved. PantofenicolÂ® production On leaving Instituto Pasteur de Lisboa, in 1960, Ivan Villax was contractually allowed to continue his research and to make a business out of any of his inven- tions that IPL was not exploiting outside of Portugal. Ivan Villax started off on a trip through Europe, with the view to concluding business with his chloram- phenicol complex, PantofenicolÂ®. Again, it was a matter of meeting up with ex- -Hungarians who had connections or had set up firms similar to those where they had previously worked in Hungary. He returned with a number of con- tracts; firms such as Promesa, in Madrid, Chinoin in Milan, Biobasal in Basel and Chifar in Athens all showed interest in the product. This work was taking place in parallel with his responsibilities at Fermentfarma. Chinoin in Hungary had been taken over by the State. However its owners had fled the country and re-started the operations of the Italian and Mexican subsidiaries as separate businesses. The manager in Italy, Rudolf Vamos, a Hungarian, was a good friend of Villaxâs â so Chinoin Italy became one of the first clients for PantofenicolÂ®. Later, Armindo and Angelina spent some time at the Chinoin plant transferring the technology for its manufacture. Hovioneâs first Japanese client was a laboratory named Tobishi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Its owner and manager, Mr. Masao Nagaoka, was to become and remains to this day a personal friend of the Villax family. A contract for the supply of Pantofe- nicolÂ® was signed with Tobishi in June 1966 and supply started in May 1967. Later this Tokyo based firm was to purchase many other products from the corticosteroid line. Many clients were now lined up for this new compound, the next question was â where to ma- nufacture the product? Who would do the work was easily solved, as Armindo knew the procedure well from his days at IPL. Hovione found an annex, in Paper on PantofenicolÂ®, 1957\n\nP:40\n\nThe first 50 years Laboratorio Asclepiusâ backyard, situated in the Avenida Miguel Bombarda in central Lisbon. A rental contract was signed. Not much space was required, no large quantities were needed â the daily dose was so low and the price at be- tween $70 and $100/kg high . In order to initiate the manufacture of PantofenicolÂ® it was necessary to buy equipment. A large aluminium saucepan was purchased from Braz & Braz. All the glassware and a vacuum pump came from Frederico Bonet. All this was installed in the outhouse at Lab. Asclepius. A glass vessel, containing the ingredients according to the specification, was placed in a paraffin bath within the aluminium pan, heated, distilled, then con- centrated and precipitated. About 4 kilos a day of PantofenicolÂ® were thus pro- duced. It was a simple one step reaction, followed by a crystallization. The first client was a South African company, Continental Ethicals Pty, with whom the contract was established through Fermentfarma, and the first order consisted of 25 kilos of product at about $70/kg. In 1963 Hovione was to move. The family and the firm moved to a larger house in Travessa do Ferreiro NÂº1 & 3, still in the Lapa district. There was space for a good office, with a separate entrance on the Ground Floor and, at last, a research laboratory in the basement for Ivan Villax. The Lab Asclepius outhouse was abandoned and all the work was concentrated in the Villax home. Life during these first years was not always easy for Hovione. Nevertheless when the cash at the bank dropped to uncomfortable levels, Ivan Villax would find a way to sell several more kilos of PantofenicolÂ®. There was one case, when, in order to pay salaries, Dianeâs jewellery was pawned for several months. Laboratories PantofenicolÂ® supply agreement at Travessa do Ferreiro, NÂº1 & 3 with Promesa SA Madrid, 3rd June 1960\n\nP:41\n\n38 39 Steroid production In 1964, Ivan Villax started regular work in the field of corticosteroids. He purchased and installed in his basement a 20 litre glass reactor for the production of Betamethasone alcohol which was manufactured by means of a novel 16 step chemical process which he had elaborated. The respective Portuguese patent application, PT52923 dated 1969, was granted in many countries, including the USA, Japan and Canada. Starting raw-materials were obtained from Upjohn or Roussel-Uclaf. Another 60 litre reactor with glass charging vessels and EIVS condensers was later installed in the gardenerâs shed. In order to get enough height for the installation of this equipment and accessories, it was necessary to dig out the floor and sink the base of the reactor down about 2 metres. Ivan Villaxâs business plan was simple: focus on difficult products. That would surely reduce competition and maintain high prices. At that time, a gram of corticosteroid sold for $100/g. By the years 1965/66, the Japanese fine chemical industry had discove- red Villaxâs scientific work on corticosteroids through the publication of his patents in the Chemical Abstracts. The firm was approached by several Japa- nese firms and this was the beginning of a very important business relation- ship which was to reach great heights in the 70s. In the meantime, sales continued to increase steadily. Ivan Villax with Japanese colleagues at Tobishi, Tokyo, end 60âs 60 liter reactor in gardenâs shed, Travessa do Ferreiro, NÂº1 & 3\n\nP:42\n\nThe first 50 years âA moment of panic!â One night at Travessa do Ferreiro No. 1, during the 60âs, Ivan away in Italy, I woke up and smelt something peculiar. What could it be? After a few seconds I realised it could only be some sort of solvent. Being very much a layman in the matter, it could have been any one of many solvents, but I was certain it was of the family of liquids I used to remove grease stains from clothes which, Ivan had always warned me, were either highly inflammable or explosive or both!! Something said to me âDonât turn on the light it can create a spark and we would all go up in smokeâ so I trailed downstairs from the first floor, past the ground floor to the basement, opening windows as I went and more or less in the dark, I may have had a torch. Sure enough, the floor was wet and smelt strongly of what I then found out was âethyl acetateâ. I telephoned the engineer who worked with us in those days, whose name has evaporated in the haze of time and he showed up shortly after. We conversed and realised that we had to pour the remains of the leaking drum into a sound one. It was heavy. I had seen procedures whereby a plastic tube went from one drum to the other and everything was transferred. However, the heavy drum had to be higher that the empty one for this to function. We somehow got the leaking drum onto a stool and inserted a tube but you have to get the thing flowing. The engineer did not have much imagination and my only suggestion was âsuck the tube and get the liquid going, after that it will flow on its ownâ. He wouldnât, so in the end I had to and that solved the problem. Between us we mopped up the floor, firmly closed the new drum containing the solvent and I went back to bed. Ivan was horrified when I told him the story but it was resolved most satisfactorily.â Diane Villax, 1966 Travessa do Moinho de Vento, Lisbon\n\nP:43\n\n40 41 Some unexpected situations Naturally, there were some occasions during this âcottage industryâ which Company lunch, 1970 caused some concern, or, even, slight panic. However, decades on, they are good stories worth telling. Ivan Villax was well aware of the danger of some of the chemicals with which he worked and he always put safety first. All the installation in the basement at Travessa do Ferreiro was fire and explosion proof. A German drier, certified explosion proof was purchased. However, the fact is, one day when it was drying PantofenicolÂ® it did explode. No one was injured and there was no significant loss of product but everyone got a great fright. The four children also lived in the houseâ¦ Mr. Villax immediately took action. He summoned Celestino, his carpen- ter, and between them designed and made a plywood cupboard with slatted shelves. Two domestic hair driers blew hot air into the cupboard through two plastic tubes. The product got dried and there were no more explosions. There was an earthquake in Lisbon in February 1969 and it so happened that Ivan Villax, at that time was abroad on business. It wasnât very strong but enough for plaster to fall from some of the ceilings and the floor to shake. Angelina and Armindo, most conscientious as always, and aware that Mr. Villax was away, came quickly round to see that all was well in the laboratory. It was luck they did as a small jar of metallic sodium had moved and was on the edge of the self, about to fall, when they arrived. Apparently, if it had fallen there could have been a serious problem. In order to produce betamethasone it was necessary to carry out a reac- tion known as a Grignard which was somewhat dangerous. For a layman it is difficult to understand the exact reason but to cut short the story it was ne- cessary to prevent the reaction from overheating so kilos and kilos of ice had to be fed into the reactor. Mrs. Villax remembers well, before going to bed, having to check out the 60 litre glass reactor to see if it was necessary to change the wet cloths that covered it in order to maintain the temperature.\n\nP:44\n\nThe first 50 years 3. The Seventies First industrial steps Building 1, Loures, 1970\n\nP:45\n\n42 43 As a result of the sale of Fermentfarma to Rachelle Laboratories in 1967, Ivan Villaxâs share gave him sufficient finance to consider the construc- tion of a new plant in Sete Casas, Loures, just north of Lisbon. The site was on a farm he had purchased in 1966, where his mother and brothers lived. The plant would be built from scratch. There had already been a great deal of process development and scale-up work done on the corticorsteroid line. A new line was under development â doxycycline. This semi-synthetic antibiotic was produced from oxytetracycline through a 4 step chemical synthesis process. The first building, later named Building 1, would house two reactor trains with a capacity totalling 16 cubic meters, a QC lab and Mr. Villaxâs research lab. In 1967 Plurichemie Anstalt, belonging to IvanÂ´s ex-partners in Ferment- farma, subscribed to 25% of Hovioneâs share capital. Ivan Villax had a 50% share, his wife and Plurichemie 25% each. As such, half of the capital of the company was foreign owned. The new plant ushered the industrial phase. Exports grew and it was nec- essary to take on more staff. From 12 people working in Lisbon, the number increased to 27 in 1970, 50 in 1974 and 98 in 1979. It was at this time that the Japanese business grew tremendously with the exports of corticosteroid products. This became a regular, high margin business. The first plant Loures was then a small rural town, known as the vegetable garden of Lisbon due to its fertile soil, about 10 km from the city limits. Thus Hovione was outside the city but close enough to have easy contact with the official entities, banks, suppliers and maintenance firms. Initially, the connection with Lisbon was difficult and slow as there was one narrow approach, dating back to the previous century, heavy with all types of vehicles, mainly public transport and trucks. In fact the last couple of kilometres were not even tarmacked. The move to Loures involved the purchase of a people carrier, driven by one of the employees. Eventually a motorway was built which greatly facilitated the connec- tion to the city. If the daily staff commute was difficult and slow, much more complicated was the arrival of the trucks bringing heavy equipment from abroad. Some of the staff still remembers the expert manoeuvring of the truck drivers arri- ving from Italy with large and heavy equip- ment to be unloaded. Building 1 under construction, 1969\n\nP:46\n\nThe first 50 years Progression of built-up area at the Loures site from 1969 Unloading of Equipment - to 2009 persistence and imagina- tion! 1984 âAnother heavy piece of equipment arrived 1995 in the middle of the afternoon. It came on a large truck which had to lower its sides Production in order to unload by means of a crane or Warehouses forklift. However, we had neither of these Maintenance/Utilities two items and it was too late to send for Recycling units anything. Pathways Mr. Biro â who was as persistent as he was competent, decided we had to unload the equipment so that we could start installing it the following morning. I was watching and thinking âwe might not be able to and we might be in for an unfortunate situation... What if the crate falls!?â It was dark when we started the unloading, sliding the crate down lengthwise, using steel cables to control the movement. Being very heavy at one moment the front of the truck began to rise. The skill of those holding the cables managed to stabilize the truck. We got a nasty shock! It was near dawn when we succeeded in unloading the equipment, thanks to much persistence and a lot of imagination. We had to prop up the truck both at the front and rear so that it did not upturn again.â Armando SimÃµes, 1972\n\nP:47\n\n1969 1979 44 45 1988 1980 1991 1996 1999 2001 ACTUAL\n\nP:48\n\nThe first 50 years R&D lab, Buiding 1, 1970 Although today the site is totally built up, the property maintained a large area of rural space during the 70s and the 80s. In fact, for as long as it was possible, part of the land was run as a farm. Vegetables were grown and the orchard produced fruit for the canteen. Now, with the space managed down to the last square metre, Hovione still has quite a number of orange trees near Building 1. This insistence on maintaining the greenery, a clean environment ena- bling the fruit trees to prosper was non negotiable for Ivan Villax, perhaps a connection with his early life in the fertile Hungarian countryside. It was only in the last instance that he would allow a tree to be cut down. At one time, when a new building was going up, this meant eliminating a considerable number of citrus trees â Mr. Villax had them carefully uprooted and taken to his country house near Sintra where they were replanted. The cow shed was maintained for many years as a warehouse until it had to be demolished for the construction of Building 7. Initially, the property, Quinta de S. Pedro, had an area of about 17,000m2. In the mid 80s a contiguous 20,000m2 plot came up for sale and was promp- Isabel Ferreira, Analytical lab, 1979, QC team, 1979 standing in front of Hovioneâs Adelina Gomes, GraÃ§a Correia, first GC Theo Noij, Alcidia Alves, Maria Rosado Oliveira e Manuela Gouveia\n\nP:49\n\n46 47 Production Areas in Building 1 tly purchased. Hovioneâs architect during the first decades was JosÃ© Gabriel Pinto Coelho, who for many years worked as a full time di- rector of the Firm. The first building, at the south end of the site, was simple and func- tional. The offices were divided in two floors, the production areas were the full height of the building with metal floors where neces- sary. Adjacent to the main building there were smaller buildings for the generator and the boiler. Mr. Villax had conceived the layout of the work space as well as of the production areas, drawing everything on his squared paper note pad during the summer of 1968. Later came Building 2, which housed more production and research, as well as some administrative offices. It was not easy to obtain the industrial licences for the factory. There was already one manufacturer of active phar- maceutical ingredients in the country and it was not deemed convenient for a second unit to start up as it would create competition. It was only thanks to the help of Professor JoÃ£o Antunes Varela, who had been Minister of Justice and was at the time a Director at Sena Sugar Estates, that the obstacles were overcome and the licence obtained. Below is the recollection of one of our staff, who joined us in 1970 and is now a Team Leader; he was present at the start up of the Macau factory in 1986 where he led and trained local employees to work in production.\n\nP:50\n\nThe first 50 years Extraordinary Leadership âIn 1969, aged 19, I worked in a small garage in Rua do Sacramento Ã Lapa, near the Villax family house. I met Mr. and Mrs. Villax via their cars which I used to wash and fill up with petrol. Once work started at the Loures plant, more production staff was needed. It was, thus, one day during that year that Mr. Villax invited me to form part of his team, which took place in February 1970. It meant a higher salary, better working conditions all round and the opportunity to learn things that would increase my qualifications and offer me a better future. As soon as I started to work I realised the distance between the demand and rigour required in the procedures of chemical reactions, compared to what I had done up to date at the garage. I understood I had everything to learn. I witnessed the growth and success of Hovione over the years from production at a pilot plant scale to that of several tons, using an ever increasing degree of technology and higher demands of quality. However, what I always saw and learned at Hovione was that no obstacles are insurmountable; all problems however complex have a solution. This philosophy was constantly transmitted to me and others who worked directly with Mr. Villax A man of an exceptional intellectual standing, who naturally transmitted confidence, high standards and an enormous work capacity. To work with Mr. Villax meant to achieve more with less effort. At times, if problems arose during production, the head of production would tell us âToday Mr. Villax will accompany us throughout the whole manufacturing process of this batchâ. At that moment, in view of our very limited experience as chemical operators we would panic, as if we had been told that we were about to be launched out of a plane with a parachute for the first time, the adrenaline rising to new heights. Not because it was the Boss who would be working directly with us but because it was Mr. Villax with his immense technical knowledge who was going to lead us and see how we worked. Such was the respect we had for him. Once, one of my colleagues said âMr. Villax, things arenât going well, we must go to the witchâ. Mr. Villax answered, with the calmness of one who knows exactly what he is doing, âI am the witchâ. And, in fact, all the technical problems were solved. I also realized Mr. Villax had a very human side to his character. He was very approachable, would listen and was never indifferent to any private problems a member of the staff might have. In 1986 I had another pleasant surprise. In view of my experience, Mr. Villax asked me to participate in the start-up of the Macau factory. It was such a wonderful invitation as since very young I had been fascinated by the East. This was a great opportunity and I made every effort to do my best. It was a pleasure to work and live in Macau for ten years. It was also a great challenge to train my Chinese and Filipino colleagues, people with other cultures, who had no idea what a reactor or a chemical reaction was. Despite a certain amount of stress and loss of weight at the beginning, there were no significant problems and within less than 2 years we had very good production operators and even responsible team leaders. Hovione is about to commemorate 50 years of existence, whose beginning is due, without a doubt to two people of great intelligence, capable of hard work and extraordinary leadership â Mr. Ivan and Mrs. Diane Villax. A long life and great success during the next 50 years is what I sincerely wish for Hovione.â JosÃ© Carrilho, 1970\n\nP:51\n\nNew products, patents and innovation 48 49 UK patent 1510617, 1975, By 1969, Building 1 was ready and in 1970 industrial operations commen- equivalent to PT 61637, 1975 ced. To this date this building remains in operation. From day one, the Sete Casas site had its own effluent treatment system with pH control and adjust- ment, before discharge to the municipal sewer. Mr. Villax continued to work in his research laboratory. The 70s were, perhaps, Hovioneâs most productive decade in scientific terms. Between 1970 and 1979, 26 patents covering products and/or processes were applied for, corresponding to 145 applications throughout the World. The 70s are marked by large scale production of corticosteroids. Back in 1957, Mr. Villax had been granted PT33309 relating to a new non-steroidal compound having an anti-inflammatory action similar to that of the steroid family. During Hovioneâs first years, correspondence with various firms, in- cluding Wyeth, was entered into, with a view to con- cluding business on this compound, to which Mr. Villax gave the name of Hexacortison, but nothing ever came of it, the Firm was too small and insigni- ficant for its inventions to be considered by a large multinational. Mr. Villax had in 1969 applied for PT52923, a pa- tent that covered a 16 step process for the produc- tion of betamethasone and its derivatives, later granted in over 20 other countries. This process had been developed in the Travessa do Ferreiro base- ment, and had by now been scaled-up and was being used on a daily basis in Loures. This new process allowed Hovione to enter the corticosteroid market â these are high value, low volume products that still today are amongst the Firmâs most significant products. During this decade the most important markets were Argentina and Japan. In the latter, the large client was Nippon Shoji Kaisha, Hovioneâs Japanese distributor for many years. Within the same field, in 1974, Mr. Villax applied for three new process and product patents â PT61636 and its addition, and PT 61637 â relating to a steroi- dal topical application of high activity. This product patent was applied for in 29 countries. It was given the generic name of Dexamethasone 17,21 dipro- prionate and licensed to a Japanese firm, Taiho Pharmaceutical Co. Limited, in 1988, who sold it in MethadermÂ® cream and ointment, sold in Japan\n\nP:52\n\nThe first 50 years the form of topical cream and ointment, under the brand name of Metha- dermÂ®. This product reached 1st place in the list of topical anti inflammatory products sold in the Japanese market and remains on sale. Japanese clients came knocking on Mr. Villaxâs door in the mid 60s with- out any salesman ever having gone to Japan. Hovione had no local repre- sentative in that country. It was in the Chemical Abstracts that Japanese busi- ness development managers came across Ivan Villaxâs patents and brought them to Portugal. In those days, in Japan, as in many other countries, patents did not protect pharmaceutical products, only processes. When these Japanese firms operating in the field of dermatology disco- vered that there were patents, independent from those of Allen & Hanbury (the innovator, who had subsequently been bought by Glaxo, who then li- censed Schering Plough for the Japanese market) they immediately made contact with Hovione. Their intention was to buy from Hovione, and thus to enter, legally, the Japanese market with a generic form of the Schering Plough products. Our clients were immediately sued for infringement of patent and, as usual, Mr. Villax came, at once to their aid with his technical know-how. Many were the nights, in the Travessa do Ferreiro office where the telex machine was installed, that Mr. Villax would dictate to his wife the technical information required by the Japanese clients for their defence. These lengthy telexes, sometimes taking over an hour, had to be typed at great speed as the cost was per minute and this was before the days of previously typed tapes that went through quickly. Hovione and its clients won the case and this was followed by ten years of ever increasing sales with great margins. There were no other independent processes apart from those of Allen & Hanbury and this left Mr. Villax in a very favourable situation. Hovione owes its initial growth and consolidation to the Japanese market with the export of betamethasone alcohol and valerate. It was thanks to the Japanese patents that enough cash flow was generated to finance Hovioneâs development in the 70s â there was never any need to seek further investors and control remained in the family. Kenji Senga and Masao Nagaoka from Tobishi Pharmaceuticals, in Loures 1969 Telex from Tobishi Pharmaceuticals during the betamethasone litigation\n\nP:53\n\n50 51 To be or not to be a DRUGâ¦ that was the question... âOne day in 1970, a tall, blond gentleman turned up at the Lisbon airport Cargo Terminal with a small package to be sent to Switzerland. It didnât weigh more than 1kg but I was astonished when I looked at the respective invoice. A product called betamethasone, of enormous value for those days. It caused great impact and I told the gentleman who was waiting that before leaving the package would have to go through Customs and the Airway Bill checked. The Customsâ official immediately asked to see what was in the package as there was a suspicion that the powder within the glass flask might be cocaineâ¦ The gentleman who was still waiting said that the flask could not possibly be opened due to technical reasons but he invited the official to visit the Loures factory in order to understand, and see for himself, what was being produced. The officer came round to the plant, the product left later â this was probably the first guided tour of Hovioneâs factory. Since that first shipment, ALL Hovioneâs invoices have to be accompanied by a declaration stating that the product to be exported âDOES NOT CONTAIN DRUGSâ â¦ just to be on the safe side. A final note â the participants in this story: 1) Hovioneâs representative was Mr. Ivan Villax. 2) The TAP agent was the undersigned Armando Bacelar Begonha, Hovioneâs Forwarding Agent, 1970 As betamethanones were produced and exported, development work con- Maria Rosado, tinued in the industrialization of the doxycycline line. The initial processes for Analyst, 70âs this production were covered by patent Nos. 54108 and its addition, PT54109 and two additions, as well as PT54109, all dated 1970, although developed in the days of the Lisbon basement research laboratory. Equivalent patents were granted in seven of the most important world markets. Naturally, the produc- tion facilities needed new equipment of a bigger scale and adapted to some very innovative chemistry. The 4 step process involved complex chemical reac- tions that were difficult and hazardous to execute. Patent PT52217, applied for in 1970, relating to the process for the production of doxycycline, described the transformation of oxy- tetracycline into hemicetal base at a low temperature of -45ÂºC. The claim states that the lower the temperature of the chlorination re- action, the higher the purity and yield. It was only much later, when rational drug design came into being, that reactions at -70ÂºC star- ting being more commonplace. It was, in part, due to this long ex- perience with cyrogenic reactions, that Hovione found itself in a favourable position to produce HIV protease inhibitors, which, at the end of the 90s represented a very important percentage of the Companyâs sales. The process to make doxycycline also involved a dehydration with large amounts of pure HF and a high pressure hydrogenation that used a rhodium catalyst. Armindo Santos, who originally worked with Mr. Villax at IPL, was given the task of carrying out all hydrogenations, an operation requiring care and precision.\n\nP:54\n\nThe first 50 years Hydrogenation work in Sete Casas âI started working at the Sete Casasâ plant in 1970, when we commenced production of doxycycline although the initial work and assays had been carried out at the laboratory in Travessa do Ferreiro. We were a team of about 12 to 15 people to begin with although the Lisbon office was maintained. We started carrying out hydrogenations and this became my responsibility until I retired at leadership level 4. Mr. Villax knew this operation was dangerous but he considered me careful and responsible that was why it became my job. Sometimes I was frightened and would worry at home whether everything had been satisfactorily concluded. â Armindo Santos, 1970 Although Hovioneâs technology was innovative, the same cannot always be said about the routes taken by some of the products to their final destination. For instance, one of Hovioneâs regular doxycycline clients in 70s was based in Barcelona, Spain, but always requested dispatch to Andorra. The product went by truck, via Spain to Andorra. Eventually, it ended up in the clientâs laboratory in Barcelona, but the exact route was never known, probably on a donkeyâs back ! It was also usual that products initially produced and exported by Hovione to Italy and Switzerland were subsequently imported by Portuguese laborato- ries to be formulated and sold in the country. The attitude was â âIf it came from abroad, it was likely to be better qualityâ. Good Science is not enough My father often said that if our products are good enough they will sell themselves. Indeed throughout most of his life my fatherâs best advertising were his inventions and he was pleased that for 25 years his name showed up every year at no cost in his very own yellow pages (the Chemical Abstracts !). Sure enough many customers from Japan came to his doorstep and rang the bell, and for over 10 years Japan was our Number 1 market. Sales of corticosteroids to Japanese customers are at the root of Hovioneâs initial success. As a result my father flew to Japan several times a year in the Sixties and the Seventies. The flight from Europe stopped in Anchorage and then flew across the North Pole. One day on arrival at Haneda airport, at dusk, as my father got off the plane, went down the stairway and started to walk towards the terminal, he saw the new moon. He had picked up on a splendid superstition of my great-grand-mother and proceeded to stop on the tarmac, drop his bags and perform a ceremony: he bowed to the moon holding coins in both his hands, and then did a full turn on himself and again bowed to the moon again shaking the coins so they would make noise â this he repeated 3 times. Standing in a circle around him was a group of surprised Japanese, staringâ¦ Ivan felt that good science was not enough, you needed luck and the New Moon would smile at those that took risk. In those early days every bit of luck was necessary â so even after a long flight, even in a strange and far away place, Ivan Villax never missed a chance to get luck on his side. Guy Villax, 1978\n\nP:55\n\n52 53 The 1974 Revolution Those years were naturally difficult and uncertain, but Hovione overcame this period thanks to its stability and the staffâs commonsense. Perhaps, the greatest problems were created by the government bodies, rather than as a result of the revolutionary atmosphere. There was never any real risk of nationa- lization, the firm was small, its business incomprehensible to most people. 50% of the capital was foreign owned, the patents, at that time, were still individually owned and the staff were well looked after and had no claims of wrongdoing. Yet Hovione was a large exporter as well as an importer of many raw ma- terials and equipment. All import/export formalities and currency controls became very cumbersome and time consuming, involving endless justifica- tion, forms and stamps. Whatsâmore, the bureaucracy was constantly chan- ging, laws were drawn up but not implemented, nothing was easy. Foto da FamÃ­lia Villax Ã Ã©poca (?) Cover of Time Magazine, May 6th, 1974\n\nP:56\n\nTheTRheefirastc5t0iyoeanrsaries âAfter the 25th April 1974, there was considerable upheaval in all sections of society â it was the climax of the infamous period known as PREC (Revolutionary Process under Way). This process, depending on the political/social force in power, kept on changing the labour laws and procedures in all sectors. Along this line, someone âdecidedâ to locate all the Official Customs Brokers and their assistants who worked at the airport, in one single office. This meant that to move around one had to manoeuvre around a labyrinth of desks, cupboards, files, etc. etc., until reaching his desk. At lunchtime, the âbossesâ left and the majority of the Assistants stayed in the office as they brought food from home and soon the office became a meeting room. They would read the sporting papers with their feet on the desks, play cards and bit by bit the others, having finished their meal, would arrive so that there was an ever increasing background noise of talk and laughter. I must point out that this situation did not affect me directly as I only went to this office on behalf of Hovione. One day I arranged to meet one of the employees of our Customs Broker at the Lisbon Airport Cargo Terminal to resolve a question that had arisen. After the meeting with the Customsâ Official, our broker and I returned to his office. It was lunch time so to get through we had to put up with and avoid the legs of those reading the newspapers, others playing cards , all giving us dirty looks as we weaved our way to my friendâs desk at the rear of the room. He sat down with me next to him and together we prepared the documentation required in order to solve the problem with the Customsâ authorities. After a few minutes we noticed that the background noise had subsided, the room was silent and suddenly we heard a chorus, low to begin with, then getting louder and louder until we understood they were all staring at us and shouting âDown the reaction, down the reactionariesâ. I looked at the chap, a man of a certain age and great experience, and he just said âdonât take any notice of them, they will soon tireâ and we continued to work. Conclusion: We were working during the lunch hour and therefore considered reactionaries.â Manuel Armando Moreira, 1975 Manuel Armando Moreira was responsible for getting our imports and exports through customs upon arrival and departure for the best part of 30 years. Manuel Armando Moreira, Travessa do Ferreiro, 70âs\n\nP:57\n\n54 55 That said, operations in the plant proceeded normally. The sales were not affected by the revolutionary atmosphere and salaries were paid on time. The companyâs pay scale was well above the national average, so there was really no basis for complaints. During the following years, with interest and inflation reaching occasionally 40% a year, Mr. Villaxâs had two priorities: first, to make sure the staff was looked after because that was central to keeping the plant operating and customer needs met, second to find an alternative manufacturing site in a location with political stability and favourable to Hovioneâs needs. However, Hovione was not totally immune to the general attitude and so- cial unrest, and insisted that any political meetings had to be held outside the premises. During 1974 and 1975 these meetings were held at the Lisbon office of the Hairdressersâ Union, it was the cheapest venue that could be found. These meetings would go on into the early hours of the morning. Endless debate through dense cigarette smoke seemed to satisfy the emotions of the time. Armando SimÃµes, who had joined the firm in 1960, patiently explained that given the complexity of the operation and the importance of Mr. Villaxâs patents, Hovione would not be able to continue without him. In addition, how could the staff aspire to higher wages and better social benefits than those already in force without him. In the end, common sense prevailed and work resumed without further ado. Villax Family, 1975, left to right: Peter, Sofia, Diane, Ivan, Guy and Miguel sitting below Revolutionary Times ââ¦. Great expansion took place during those years, only interrupted by the 25th April 1974 and the âhotâ summer of 1975, with the consequent instability within the work force. Some will still remember the Workersâ Commission promptly formed and the innumerable meetings which followed. I remember an episode at the Hairdressersâ Syndicate in Lisbonâ¦ For me and many others they were turbulent times, only Mr. Villax could take us safely through the storm. And so it was, the majority won. We made every effort to steady the boat and I think we succeeded.â Manuela Leite, Ivan VillaxÂ´s secretary for over 40 years, currently retired\n\nP:58\n\nThe first 50 years For Ivan Villax, this revolutionary period in Portugal must have been a diffi- cult experience. The situation must have reminded him of what had happened in Hungary after the War bringing forth the anxiety of having to move yet again and, at the age of 50, restart his life elsewhere. However, Ivan Villax was opti- mistic, after all there were no Russian troops on Portuguese soil. We were in the middle of the Cold war, Portugal was a strategic member of NATO, America would never allow Portugal to fall under the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union. But the situation was very anarchic, particularly in the schools and univer- sities. Therefore, Mr. and Mrs. Villax decided to transfer all four children from the French LycÃ©e in Lisbon to the French LycÃ©e in London for the 1975/76 school year. This was communicated to the staff. On 15th August, the family left for England and rented a house in London where a small office was set up. At 8 Markham Square, Adelina Reis Mendes managed the office and sent telexes. Mr. Villax would spend three out of the four weeks, each month, either in Lisbon or travelling on business. âHovione had a total staff of 45 on the 25th April 1974, most of whom had been admitted within the previous 4 to 5 years since the Loures plant had started production in 1969. Only a small nucleus of 7 employees had been admitted during the first years of the company. During the PREC - being the period following the 25th April 1974 which lasted several years â many companies was nationalized, some directly (banks, insurance companies, parts of industry) others, indirectly, due to a shareholding position by banks. Frequently, people were ousted, this being totally unfair, compulsive sacking based upon false accusations, never verified. This was a way of settling personal vendettas. The newspapers took to relating such situations daily and there was an incitement to take part in the ârevolutionâ and for âthe employees to take over the companiesâ. Anyone who did not agree was accused of being a reactionary and would be ousted from his job. At Hovione there was some turbulence but with different characteristics, probably because the people did not really think they were being exploited (conditions were far better than what they had had previously) and they knew they were learning a profession. However, even so there was a group of people who, immediately after the 25th April started insisting on wage increases without waiting to see if this was the general feeling and without the consent of the majority of the staff. The increases were accepted â Esc.1, 000 (â¬5.00) and Esc. 1,500 (â¬7.50) depending on the level of their previous wages. Some people â more preoccupied with maintaining their jobs and recognizing the satisfactory conditions of work â did not agree with these demands and proposed that, in future, all matters had to be made known to everyone and accepted by the majority. Furthermore, the matters had to be discussed after working hours and outside the plant. Acceptance was peaceful and complied with. Today, years later, I feel that the good common sense that led to this compromise agreed upon by all Hovione employees ensured that the firm never held the infamous plenary meetings which were summoned from one moment to another and upset the normal work in so many firms. In our case and due to the nature of our business (chemical reactions that could last up to 24 hours) if this had happened, it would have had a devastating effect. The climate within the firm was calm, nothing comparable to what was going on in the vast majority of Portuguese firms.â Armando SimÃµes, 1975\n\nP:59\n\nWork and the human touch 56 57 Canteen in Loures By the end of the 70s, Hovione had a staff of nearly 100. The Company had grown and it was at this time that Mr. Villaxâs qualities of leadership, vision and charisma were most felt. He continued to address all members of staff by name, and was sympathetic to their problems. Everyone knew that if they faced a problem, and if the boss could help, all they had to do was knock on his door. The result was a motivated workforce who knew they could rely on the Company. To face the growth of exports to Japan, the Com- pany needed to increase its head-count. At the same time Portugal was seeing a tremendous in- flux of people, well educated, ambitious and with wide horizons, returning from the ex-colonies all in quest of a livelihood. Mr. Villax, himself a refugee, had arrived in Portugal seeking a new life, as such he felt a close affinity with those that had lost everything and had been forced to leave their homes in Mozambique and Angola. For a number of years, other things being equal, he would give them priority whenever vacancies at Hovione arose. It was a wise decision. To this day, there are still many team members that joined Hovione after their trau- matic return from Africa. Caring and Human âAfter several attempts, I collected up my courage and decided to go and speak to Mr. Villax to ask for a loan of 50 contos (Esc.50,000) to buy a car as public transport was scarce, and I promised to repay in five instalments. A few days later, Mr. Villax came across me in the bar, at lunch time and told me âIâll grant the loan but you can repay me in ten instalments, as you have a child to bring upâ. Words such as these show what a great person Mr. Villax was - R.I.P.â JosÃ© Adriano GuimarÃ£es, 1988 Staff safety was a constant preoccupation of Ivan Villax. From the start, all work was carried out with adequate safety protection. He also insisted that those requiring such pro- tection complied with the safety manual. At Hovione, constant innovation required in- creased qualifications. Training was a feature early on in the life of the Company. Gas masks, 70âs\n\nP:60\n\nThe first 50 years A School In one word I would describe Hovione as a School. A School both on a professional as well as a personal level. A school formed by fascinating people with whom I had the privilege of living and working during 8 years of my life and that helped me grow as a person and as a professional. Hovione transmits strength and ensures that its staff always feels that they are part of a team and that only as a team can the required objectives be achieved. I speak for myself as I always wore the Hovione cap with pride. Literally speaking, in fact, for although I no longer work for Hovione I find myself wearing the shirts with the Hovione logo! Thank you Hovione and that these are merely the first 50 years! Diogo Botto, 2006 Hovione Japan Limited First Purchase Order for When the Schering Plough patents expired, the Dexamethasone 17,21-dipropionate Italian competition arrived in force and Hovioneâs pri- (MethadermÂ®) 13 years after ces began to erode. The Companyâs distribution chan- the initial patent application nel in the Empire of the Rising Sun, was Nippon Shoji Kaisha, client, importer and distributor. Hovione knew its final clients and was aware that its brand was strong. It therefore came as a surprise that, despite the lower prices, quantities sold were also falling, al- though market surveys indicated an overall increase in volume. Hovione discovered that its agent was importing betamethasone from Italian manufactu- rers, counterfeiting Hovione labels in order to supply Hovioneâs clients. The agency contract was immedia- tely terminated and Mr. Villax decided to establish a sales office in Tokyo. Hovione Japan was founded and survived for 19 years without great success in either maintaining prices or increasing its market share. Hovione learnt an important lesson: Japan is a lucrative market but you cannot fight Japan Inc. In order to succeed in this great market you have to play by their rules and know how to choose the right partner. Today, Hovione has two agents in Japan, and even has some direct rela- tionships without intermediaries but it is important to respect the traditions, the cultural habits and, even, certain ways of business behaviour which would not be logical or obvious to the Western world. The Japanese clientsâ quality demands are very very stringent, more than any Westerner can imagine. It takes a long time to establish a relationship, this\n\nP:61\n\n58 59 involves time and personal effort but once established, and consolidated by constant contact, the Japanese client becomes very loyal and a friend. Taiho Pharmaceutical Co. Limited of Tokyo has been Hovioneâs client of the same product for 21 years. By 1980, after 11 years of increasing sales and very high margins, Hovione in Japan was confronted by a decade of reduced business in the field of gene- rics. Indeed, Hovione would see its sales of generics reduced to virtually no- thing. Nippon Shoji Kaisha eventually got caught up in the Japanese financial bubble and was punished for insider trading. For a renaissance of its business in Japan, Hovione will have to wait till 1994 when it launches Contrast Media products. China First visit to Canton Fair, Autumn 1978, The business in Japan and the endless trips to Osaka and Tokyo had enabled Hov- Diane and Ivan Villax with ione to get to know Asia. Hovione also had Fernando Rodrigues dos Santos clients in Taiwan and Korea, in India and Pakistan. In Hong Kong Shin Kee drug and Hong-Kong agent. bought APIs from Hovione and distributed them in South-East Asia. Visiting Mr. Shin- Keeâs warehouse was an eye opener â there were drums from every company in Europe and many from China, it was a great source of information. It became clear that China represented an opportunity to source raw- -materials. It produced hormones from plants that yielded the starting materials for the corticosteroid line. The docycycline line nee- ded a large tonnage of oxytetracycline â again this was available in the PRC. In Octo- ber 1978, Mr. and Mrs. Villax took a train from Hong Kong to Canton to visit the im- portant bi-annual trade fair. The potential for business was immediately obvious. Since the 60s many of the more brilliant Chinese students had been sent to the USA to conclude their higher studies. Upon their return to China, they were capable of giving an enormous technological advance to many industries, including that of pharmaceutical chemicals. Thus, as a result of the first of many trips to the Canton fair, Hovione con- cluded a contract for the supply of intermediates for its production lines. In those days, business was discussed and concluded with government officials, direct contact with the factories was only permitted in the 80s. In January 1979, Hovione Hong Kong Limited was incorporated, with capi- tal supplied by Plurichemie. In those days Portuguese firms were not allowed to invest abroad. This sales office followed up the business initiated in Octo- ber 1978 and paved the way for Hovioneâs growth in Asia.\n\nP:62\n\nThe first 50 years 4. The Eighties Globalization The 80s was an important decade for Hovione. The Company grew, con- solidated and entered new international markets. The companyâs growth was financed by the constant reinvestment of its profits.

An imaginative present that was highly appreciated. The companyâs growth was reflected in the increase of production capacity and number of employees. The decade started with 123 staff in Loures and ended with a total of 225 plus 67 in the Macau factory, doubling the number in 10 years. Production volumes and the value of exports also doubled. Amongst Hovioneâs new markets, the USA was to be the most important. In 1982 the Waxman-Hatch Act was approved. This permitted for the first time, upon expiration of the innovatorâs patent, the sale of the pharmaceutical product by any party so long as bioequivalence could be shown. This avoided the lengthy and expensive repetition of clinical studies. Hovione was the right company at the right time, and was able to take advantage of the fast growth of the generics industry, first, in the United States and then in Europe.\n\nP:63\n\n60 61 Hovione Team in front of Building 1, 1983\n\nP:64\n\nThe first 50 years View of Building 1, 80Â´s With the US sales, doxycycline, a broad spectrum antibiotic of the tetracy- cline family, became Hovioneâs biggest product. Hovione, together with Pfizer â doxycyclineâs Innovator â were its largest manufacturers. The 80s were an amazing decade. Sales grew at 20% a year, and EBITDA was around 30%. The customer list grew in number and diversity â 38 coun- tries were being supplied at some point. The team expanded and demons- trated an increasing number of competencies. The FDA approvals, the capacity to design, install and operate high tech plants in Portugal and Macau, the success in the US market, everything appeared to indicate that Hovioneâs future was rosy. The success, however, had a major weakness, Hovione was now a one product company. The corticosteroid lines were declining. As Hovioneâs crea- tivity was almost totally absorbed by a long patent litigation that would con- sume most of Ivan Villaxâs efforts, along with those of William Heggie, Head of Research and of Philip Page, Technical Director. The new product pipeline was empty.\n\nP:65\n\n62 63 In this industry it takes years to launch a new product â there is great risk involved as it is only after investing millions in R&D that one knows if the gamble has been won. Time flies and during years Hovione had to invest its best brains in patents fights â lucrative yes, but sterile in terms of guarante- eing the future. The development of several projects had been initiated in the laboratory, amongst them, Danazol and Praziquantel, but none proved successful - ex- cept minocycline. In 1989 Hovione was ready to launch this product, 7 years after the launch of doxycycline in the United States. In 1984 Hovione commemorated its 25th anniversary. The celebrations in- cluded a lunch party for all the employees at the beautiful Palacio of the Cor- reio Mor in Loures. An exhibition providing insights into the first 25 years was held at the plant and was followed by a cocktail party for clients, suppliers, lo- cal authorities and friends.

Annually, depending on the Companyâs results a profit-sharing bonus was paid to all employees. Mr. Villax believed that they were the basis of the Companyâs success and merit should be compensated.
