Physics joins to Astronomy to explain the phenomenon, while the use of Music and Painting make possible the immersion in the subject in way to many trips to the imagination capable to awake emotions.A proposal didactic is presented and justified for some consensus of the research in the area of teaching-learning of science, since that related to the persistent alternative conceptions concerning the causes of the changes observed at the different times of the year until the qualitative modelling of phenomena that appeals three-dimensional pedagogical models. Such proposal was developed in the activity named \" Hiper interesting Talk: The Four Seasons, Science and Art\" in the first Sunday of August/2003 in the Museum of Astronomy, MAST. O artigo trata do tema das EstaÃ§Ãµes do Ano, explorando elementos da CiÃªncia e da Arte como forma de motivar estudantes ou pÃºblico de museus de ciÃªncia e tecnologia a compreendÃª-lo a partir de vivÃªncias culturais atuais e de outras Ã©pocas. A FÃ­sica se junta Ã Astronomia para explicar o fenÃ´meno, enquanto a MÃºsica e a Pintura possibilitam a imersÃ£o no tema em meio a muitas viagens Ã imaginaÃ§Ã£o capazes de despertar emoÃ§Ãµes.Uma proposta didÃ¡tica Ã© apresentada e justificada por consensos das muitas pesquisas na Ã¡rea de ensino-aprendizagem de ciÃªncias, desde os que se referem Ã s persistentes concepÃ§Ãµes alternativas acerca das causas das mudanÃ§as observadas nas diferentes Ã©pocas do ano atÃ© Ã modelagem qualitativa de fenÃ´menos que recorre a modelos pedagÃ³gicos tridimensionais.

C.\n\n2003-08-01\n\nNeste trabalho ampliamos a discussÃ£o da abordagem holÃ­stica para o ensino de astronomia que temos desenvolvido nos Ãºltimos anos, analisamos novos resultados e apresentamos exemplos prÃ¡ticos para interessados em experimentÃ¡-la. A constataÃ§Ã£o bÃ¡sica a orientar este enfoque Ã© que cursos introdutÃ³rios em astronomia costumam ser excessiva e prematuramente tÃ©cnicos, alÃ©m de assumirem uma visÃ£o tradicional, muito estreita, do que seja educaÃ§Ã£o cientÃ­fica, herdada da era cartesiana e positivista da ciÃªncia. Fundamentamos porque Ã© importante que elementos de astronomia cultural ofereÃ§am o mote e constituam o eixo norteador daqueles cursos e porque Ã© urgente revermos a visÃ£o que temos da relaÃ§Ã£o entre astronomia e meio ambiente. Um ponto central nesta abordagem Ã© explorar formas de reativar e atualizar uma relaÃ§Ã£o orgÃ¢nica com o meio e excitar a consciÃªncia de nossa inevitÃ¡vel e profunda interdependÃªncia com ele em nÃ­vel cÃ³smico. Neste trabalho exemplificamos a possibilidade de concretizaÃ§Ã£o desta proposta em trÃªs diferentes situaÃ§Ãµes: disciplinas de cursos de licenciatura em geografia e em fÃ­sica; escolas de nÃ­vel fundamental; e, neste caso ainda a ser implementada, comunidades carentes. Estes casos envolvem pÃºblicos e espaÃ§os diferenciados para educaÃ§Ã£o formal e nÃ£o-formal. Dos casos jÃ¡ implementados, destacamos os resultados alcanÃ§ados pelos alunos: enriquecimento cultural, aprendizagem significativa de conteÃºdos astronÃ´micos tradicionais; mudanÃ§as de comportamento, incorporando contato diÃ¡rio com o cÃ©u; e freqÃ¼entes vivÃªncias de sentimentos empÃ¡ticos que redirecionam a relaÃ§Ã£o com a natureza e a consciÃªncia ecolÃ³gica global. AlÃ©m disto, para interessados em aplicar esta proposta, tambÃ©m socializamos procedimentos e cuidados para a implementaÃ§Ã£o de aÃ§Ãµes alternativas consonantes com a mesma.

Como Ã© de conhecimento geral a astronomia Ã© um dos conteÃºdos a serem ensinados na EB fazendo parte dos ParÃ¢metros Curriculares Nacionais e das Propostas Curriculares do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo, mas Ã© um fato, que vÃ¡rios pesquisadores apontam, a existÃªncia de muitos problemas no ensino da astronomia. Com o propÃ³sito de minimizar algumas dessas deficiÃªncias foi realizado um trabalho de pesquisa com a utilizaÃ§Ã£o de questionÃ¡rios prÃ© e pÃ³s pesquisa, para tanto foi desenvolvido um Curso de ExtensÃ£o UniversitÃ¡ria para professores da Diretoria de Ensino Regional (DE) que abrange MauÃ¡, RibeirÃ£o Pires e Rio Grande da Serra (no Estado de SÃ£o Paulo) com os seguintes objetivos: levantar concepÃ§Ãµes alternativas; subsidiar os professores por meio de palestras, debates e workshops, e verificar o sucesso da aprendizagem apÃ³s o curso, adotando-se como referÃªncia, para a anÃ¡lise dos resultados, os dicionÃ¡rios de LÃ­ngua Portuguesa (FERREIRA, 2004) e EnciclopÃ©dico de Astronomia e AstronÃ¡utica (MOURÄO, 1995). Portanto, dezesseis questÃµes foram aplicadas antes e apÃ³s o curso, assim pode-se verificar apÃ³s a pesquisa que 100,0% dos professores sabiam os nomes das fases da Lua, 97,0% entenderam que o Sistema Solar Ã© composto por oito planetas, 78,1% foram capazes de explicar como ocorre um eclipse lunar, um eclipse solar e um solstÃ­cio, 72,7% sabiam como explicar a ocorrÃªncia das estaÃ§Ãµes do ano; 64,5% explicaram corretamente a ocorrÃªncia do equinÃ³cio, 89,7% foram capazes de definir adequadamente o termo cometa; 63,6% definiram asterÃ³ide, 54,5% meteoro, 58,1% galÃ¡xia, e 42,4% planeta. Os resultados obtidos indicam uma aprendizagem significativa por parte dos participantes.\n\nFistula in ano.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoss, S T\n\n1988-12-01\n\nExcept for unusual diseases, fistula in ano originates from infection in the anal crypts of Morgagni, forming an abscess which, when it opens, results in a tract leading to the skin surface. A tentative diagnosis can often be made by a careful history followed by local examination. A history of para-anal abscess followed by intermittent discharge will almost always be elicited. Alternative causes, including especially Crohn's disease, are also described. Operative technique is described, including various methods for finding the internal opening and obscure branching tracts, as well as a number of pitfalls to be avoided.\n\nA normal ano-genital exam: sexual abuse or not?\n\nPubMed\n\nHornor, Gail\n\n2010-01-01\n\nSexual abuse is a problem of epidemic proportions in the United States. Pediatric nurse practitioners (PNPs) are at the forefront of providing care to children and families. The PNP is in a unique position to educate patients and families regarding sexual abuse and dispel common myths associated with sexual abuse. One such myth is that a normal ano-genital examination is synonymous with the absence of sexual abuse. This article will provide primary care providers, including PNPs, with a framework for understanding why a normal ano-genital examination does not negate the possibility of sexual abuse/assault. Normal ano-genital anatomy, changes that occur with puberty, and physical properties related to the genitalia and anus will be discussed. Photos will provide visualization of both normal variants of the pre-pubertal hymen and genitalia as well as changes that occur with puberty. Implications for practice for PNPs will be discussed.\n\nUse of anoctamin 1 (ANO1) to evaluate interstitial cells of Cajal in Hirschsprung's disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nCoyle, David; Kelly, Danielle A M; O'Donnell, Anne Marie; Gillick, John; Puri, Prem\n\n2016-02-01\n\nInterstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) are pacemaker cells involved in facilitating neurotransmission and the generation of slow electrical waves necessary for colonic peristalsis. Their distribution has been found to be abnormal in the aganglionic and ganglionic colon in Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) using c-kit-labelling. Anoctamin-1 (ANO1) is a Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channel thought to be specifically expressed on ICCs. Unlike c-kit, it plays a key role in ICC pacemaker activity. We aimed to investigate the utility of ANO1 in evaluating the colonic ICC network in HSCR. We collected full-length pull-through specimens from children with HSCR (nÂ =Â 10). Control colon specimens were collected at colostomy closure in children with anorectal malformation (nÂ =Â 6). The distribution of ANO1 and c-kit expression was evaluated using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. ANO1 expression was quantified using Western blot analysis. ANO1 was not expressed on 23Â % of c-kit immuno-positive cells in the circular muscle; however, 100Â % of ANO1-positive ICCs were c-kit positive. The distribution of ANO1-positive ICCs was sparse in aganglionic colon, with a modest reduction in ICCs seen in the ganglionic colon in HSCR compared to controls (pÂ =Â 0.044). ANO1 protein expression was reduced in aganglionic colon but similar in ganglionic colon relative to controls. ANO1 is preferential to c-kit in evaluating the ICC network in HSCR due to its specificity and functional importance. Abnormal distribution of ANO1-positive ICCs in the ganglionic colon in HSCR may contribute to persistent bowel symptoms in some patients after pull-through surgery.\n\nA causa das estaÃ§Ãµes do ano: modelos mentais\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nde Campos, J. A. S.; de Araujo, J. F. S.\n\n2003-08-01\n\nA dÃ©cada de 70 do sÃ©culo passado foi marcada pelo estudo das concepÃ§Ãµes alternativas que os alunos trazem para a sala de aula. A identificaÃ§Ã£o destas concepÃ§Ãµes foi o ponto de partida para promover a mudanÃ§a conceitual, onde as prÃ©-concepÃ§Ãµes seriam trocadas pelas concepÃ§Ãµes cientÃ­ficas. Na dÃ©cada seguinte, surgiram muitas propostas de estratÃ©gias educacionais para facilitar esta troca, na sua maioria baseadas na idÃ©ia do conflito cognitivo, proposta por Piaget. Entretanto, os resultados pouco animadores conduziram Ã percepÃ§Ã£o de que a mudanÃ§a conceitual Ã© um processo mais complexo. Pelas idÃ©ias da CiÃªncia Cognitiva, a mudanÃ§a conceitual Ã© uma mudanÃ§a progressiva dos modelos mentais que o aluno tem sobre o mundo fÃ­sico, atravÃ©s de enriquecimento e revisÃ£o. A causa das EstaÃ§Ãµes do Ano Ã© um tÃ³pico sobre o qual a maioria dos estudantes apresenta concepÃ§Ãµes alternativas. Os autores fizeram um levantamento sobre as prÃ©-concepÃ§Ãµes encontradas em trabalhos sobre o tema (16 referÃªncias), procurando encontrar elementos comuns que indicassem a presenÃ§a de modelos mentais especÃ­ficos. As prÃ©-concepÃ§Ãµes encontradas na literatura foram obtidas usando-se diversas metodologias (desde entrevistas clÃ­nicas atÃ© questionÃ¡rios de mÃºltipla escolha) e envolvendo alunos e professores de diferentes regiÃµes geogrÃ¡ficas. A partir de uma anÃ¡lise aprofundada de cada trabalho, e utilizando-se a tÃ©cnica das Redes SistÃªmicas, chegou-se a conclusÃ£o que as diversas prÃ©-concepÃ§Ãµes identificadas (em torno de 50), poderiam ser representadas por 6 modelos mentais, onde a explicaÃ§Ã£o da causa das estaÃ§Ãµes do ano tem um mecanismo causal responsÃ¡vel. Os mecanismos causais identificados foram: a dependÃªncia da distÃ¢ncia, a dependÃªncia da orientaÃ§Ã£o, a dependÃªncia conjunta da distÃ¢ncia e orientaÃ§Ã£o, a dependÃªncia da obstruÃ§Ã£o, a dependÃªncia da velocidade e a dependÃªncia da inclinaÃ§Ã£o dos raios solares. Foram ainda identificadas\n\nEvolution of treatment of fistula in ano.\n\nPubMed\n\nBlumetti, J; Abcarian, A; Quinteros, F; Chaudhry, V; Prasad, L; Abcarian, H\n\n2012-05-01\n\nFistula-in-ano is a common medical problem affecting thousands of patients annually. In the past, the options for treatment of fistula-in-ano were limited to fistulotomy and/or seton placement. Current treatment options also include muscle-sparing techniques such as a dermal island flap, endorectal advancement flap, fibrin sealent injection, anal fistula plug, and most recently ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract (procedure). This study seeks to evaluate types and time trends for treatment of fistula-in-ano. A retrospective review from 1975 to 2009 was performed. Data were collected and sorted into 5-year increments for type and time trends of treatment. Fistulotomy and partial fistulotomy were grouped as cutting procedures. Seton placement, fibrin sealant, dermal flap, endorectal flap, and fistula plug were grouped as noncutting procedures. Statistical analysis was performed for each time period to determine trends. With institutional review board approval, the records of 2,267 fistula operations available for analysis were included. Most of the patients were men (74 vs. 26%). Cutting procedures comprised 66.6% (n = 1510) of all procedures. Noncutting procedures were utilized in 33.4% (n = 757), including Seton placement alone 370 (16.3%), fibrin sealant 168 (7.4%), dermal or endorectal flap 147 (6.5%), and fistula plug 72 (3.2%). The distribution of operations grouped in 5-year intervals is as follows: 1975-1979, 78 cutting and one noncutting; 1980-1984, 170 cutting and 10 noncutting; 1985-1989, 54 cutting and five noncutting; 1990-1994, 37 cutting and six noncutting; 1995-1999, 367 cutting and 167 noncutting; 2000-2004, 514 cutting and 283 noncutting; 2005-2009, 290 cutting and 285 noncutting. The percentage of cutting and noncutting procedures significantly differed over time, with cutting procedures decreasing and noncutting procedures increasing proportionally (Ï(2) linear-by-linear association, p < 0.05). Fistula-in-ano remains a common complex\n\nActivation of the Ano1 (TMEM16A) chloride channel by calcium is not mediated by calmodulin\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhu, Jinqiu; Qu, Zhiqiang; Cui, Yuan-Yuan; Hartzell, H. Criss\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe Ca2+-activated Cl channel anoctamin-1 (Ano1; Tmem16A) plays a variety of physiological roles, including epithelial fluid secretion. Ano1 is activated by increases in intracellular Ca2+, but there is uncertainty whether Ca2+ binds directly to Ano1 or whether phosphorylation or additional Ca2+-binding subunits like calmodulin (CaM) are required. Here we show that CaM is not necessary for activation of Ano1 by Ca2+ for the following reasons. (a) Exogenous CaM has no effect on Ano1 currents in inside-out excised patches. (b) Overexpression of Ca2+-insensitive mutants of CaM have no effect on Ano1 currents, whereas they eliminate the current mediated by the small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK2) channel. (c) Ano1 does not coimmunoprecipitate with CaM, whereas SK2 does. Furthermore, Ano1 binds very weakly to CaM in pull-down assays. (d) Ano1 is activated in excised patches by low concentrations of Ba2+, which does not activate CaM. In addition, we conclude that reversible phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is not required for current activation by Ca2+ because the current can be repeatedly activated in excised patches in the absence of ATP or other high-energy compounds. Although Ano1 is blocked by the CaM inhibitor trifluoperazine (TFP), we propose that TFP inhibits the channel in a CaM-independent manner because TFP does not inhibit Ano1 when applied to the cytoplasmic side of excised patches. These experiments lead us to conclude that CaM is not required for activation of Ano1 by Ca2+. Although CaM is not required for channel opening by Ca2+, work of other investigators suggests that CaM may have effects in modulating the biophysical properties of the channel.

Recently, pathogenic mutations in the anoctamin 3 gene (ANO3) have been identified to cause autosomal dominant craniocervical dystonia and have been assigned to the dystonia locus dystonia-24 (DYT24). Here, we expand on the phenotypic spectrum of DYT24 and provide demonstrative videos. Moreover, tremor recordings were performed, and back-averaged electroencephalography, sensory evoked potentials, and C-reflex studies were carried out in two individuals who carried two different mutations in ANO3. Ten patients from three families are described. The age at onset ranged from early childhood to the forties. Cervical dystonia was the most common site of onset followed by laryngeal dystonia. The characteristic feature in all affected individuals was the presence of tremor, which contrasts DYT24 from the typical DYT6 phenotype. Tremor was the sole initial manifestation in some individuals with ANO3 mutations, leading to misdiagnosis as essential tremor. Electrophysiology in two patients with two different mutations showed co-contraction of antagonist muscles, confirming dystonia, and a 6-Hz arm tremor at rest, which increased in amplitude during action. In one of the studied patients, clinically superimposed myoclonus was observed. The duration of the myoclonus was in the range of 250 msec at about 3 Hz, which is more consistent with subcortical myoclonus. In summary, ANO3 causes a varied phenotype of young-onset or adult-onset craniocervical dystonia with tremor and/or myoclonic jerks. Patients with familial cervical dystonia who also have myoclonus-dystonia as well as patients with prominent tremor and mild dystonia should be tested for ANO3 mutations. Â© 2014 The Authors.

The present study analyses the results of ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT) technique in treating fistula-in-ano in particular with recurrence, healing time, and continence status. LIFT in the management of patients of fistula-in-ano of cryptoglandular origin. Prospective study. This is a prospective study of 52 patients admitted from September 2012 to August 2014. Patients were managed with LIFT technique and results of LIFT technique were compared with other studies in terms of recurrence rate, incontinence rate, and other postoperative complications. A total of 52 patients were studied. Median follow-up was 24 weeks. Primary healing was achieved in 32 (71.11%) patients. Thirteen patients (28.88%) had a recurrence. No patient reported any subjective decrease incontinence after the procedure. LIFT technique is simple and easy to learn. With this method fistula-in-ano could be easily treated even at primary health care level. LIFT technique is a simple and novel modified approach for the treatment of fistula-in-ano with rapid healing rate and without any resultant incontinence.\n\nManagement of Ano-Rectal disorders by Ká¹£ÄrasÅ«tra: A clinical report\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKurapati, Vijaya Kumari; Nishteswar, K.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground: Ano-rectal complaints are usually benign in origin. Most of the patients suffering with these disorders do not seek medical advice at an early stage due to embarrassment. It results in advancement of the disease and significant disturbance in the quality of life. Among the available treatment modalities of ano-rectal disorders (ARDs), Ká¹£ÄrasÅ«tra (medicated thread) appears to be the best in terms of relief and nonrecurrence. Aims and Objectives: The aim of this study is to provide evidence-based data about the practical application of Ká¹£ÄrasÅ«tra (medicated thread) in the management of ARDs. Materials and Methods: An ano-rectal operation theatre was established in September 2012, in association with the Government Ayurvedic Speciality Clinic at District Hospital, Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh, to facilitate the AYUSH services in Allopathic Hospitals. Present report includes the details of ARDs treated by Ká¹£ÄrasÅ«tra (Medicated thread) method during 2012â2013. A total of 127 ano-rectal cases were operated, which included 44 cases of hemorrhoids, 40 cases of fistula-in-ano, 39 cases of fissure-in-ano and three cases of peri-anal abscess. All the cases were analyzed as per the observations, subjective and objective parameters, and follow-up was carried out for a period of 6 months. Results: In the 127 ARDs treated, 45 patients suffering from hemorrhoids, 36 patients got complete relief, marked relief observed in 4 patients, moderate relief observed in 5 patients. In fistula-in-ano, out of 40 patients 29 patients got complete relief, marked relief was seen in 7 patients out of them 4 patients were referred to anti-tubercular treatment center, 4 patients left against medical advice. In fissure-in-ano-out of 39 patients, 32 patients got complete relief, 5 patients got marked relief, moderate relief observed in 2 patients. These results authenticate the effectiveness of Ká¹£ÄrasÅ«tra, no adverse effects or recurrence observed in any case.

This is a retrospective study developed in a public university hospital. We included patients with 18 or more years of age, diagnosed with solid tumors, and followed between 2005 and 2015. Clinical features were assessed by descriptive statistics, and survival was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression. Fifty patients were included. The cancer incidence was 15.73 per 100,000. The mean age at diagnosis was 54 years and most patients were female (58%). Cancer of the cervix (28%) and prostate (16%) were the most common. The mean time between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis was 9 months and from diagnosis to the treatment was 3.4 months. Disease diagnosed at stage IV (17%) had worse overall survival (HR: 11.4; p<0.05). The 5-year survival rate ranged from 88% for prostate cancer to 0% for lung cancer. All 5-year survival rates were lower as compared to other populations. The most prevalent cancer sites were cervix and prostate. Disease stage and primary site were prognostic factors.

Constatou-se pouco conhecimento dos temas investigados sendo que apenas 20% dos alunos relacionaram as semanas com as fases da lua enquanto 28% associaram as estaÃ§Ãµes do ano Ã inclinaÃ§Ã£o do eixo de rotaÃ§Ã£o da Terra e 23% tinham noÃ§Ãµes das distÃ¢ncias entre objetos celestes prÃ³ximos da Terra. Enquanto 56% conseguiram relacionar o Big Bang com a origem do Universo verificou-se que 37% reconheciam ano-luz como unidade de distÃ¢ncia e 60% reconheciam o Sol como uma estrela. Apesar de 60% dos alunos indicarem a escola como principal fonte dos conhecimentos de astronomia seus conceitos ainda sÃ£o inadequados havendo necessidade de aprimoramento da abordagem desses conteÃºdos pois apesar de popular a astronomia Ã© veiculada de maneira pouco esclarecedora e com imprecissÃµes.\n\n[Effects of stable ANO1 overexpression on biological behaviors of human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma Hep-2 cells in vitro].\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Yadong; Zhang, Jinsong; Yang, Kai; Zhang, Fujun; Chen, Rui; Chen, Dan\n\n2014-02-01\n\nTo detect the effects of ANO1 overexpression on the biological behaviors of human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma Hep-2 cells. A Hep-2 cell line stably overexpressing ANO1 were examined with flow cytometry, soft agar assay, wound healing assay, siRNA experiments, and chloride channel block with DIDS to observe the effect of ANO1 overexpression on the growth, migration and invasion of the cells. Flow cytometry revealed a comparable cell percentage in G0/G1 phase between ANO1-overexpressing cells and the control cells (P>0.05). The two cells showed no significant difference in soft agar assay (P>0.05), but in wound healing experiments, ANO1-overexpressing cells showed significantly accelerated migration (P<0.05), whereas siRNA-mediated silencing of ANO1 significantly inhibited the cell migration (P<0.05). Treatment with DIDS resulted in an effective block of the ANO1 chloride channel activity and obviously decreased the migration speed of Hep-2 cells. ANO1 overexpression does not significantly affect the proliferation of cancer cells, but can enhance the migration ability of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting the value of ANO1 as a new gene therapy target for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nDevelopment of Bifunctional Gadolinium-Labeled Superparamagnetic Nanoparticles (Gd-MnMEIO) for In Vivo MR Imaging of the Liver in an Animal Model.\n\nPubMed\n\nKuo, Yu-Ting; Chen, Chiao-Yun; Liu, Gin-Chung; Wang, Yun-Ming\n\n2016-01-01\n\nLiver tumors are common and imaging methods, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), play an important role in their non-invasive diagnosis. Previous studies have shown that detection of liver tumors can be improved by injection of two different MR contrast agents. Here, we developed a new contrast agent, Gd-manganese-doped magnetism-engineered iron oxide (Gd-MnMEIO), with enhancement effects on both T1- and T2-weighted MR images of the liver. A 3.0T clinical MR scanner equipped with transmit/receiver coil for mouse was used to obtain both T1-weighted spoiled gradient-echo and T2-weighted fast spin-echo axial images of the liver before and after intravenous contrast agent injection into Balb/c mice with and without tumors. After pre-contrast scanning, six mice per group were intravenously injected with 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-MnMEIO, or the control agents, i.e., Gd-DTPA or SPIO. The scanning time points for T1-weighted images were 0.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min after contrast administration. The post-enhanced T2-weighted images were then acquired immediately after T1-weighted acquisition. We found that T1-weighted images were positively enhanced by both Gd-DTPA and Gd-MnMEIO and negatively enhanced by SPIO. The enhancement by both Gd-DTPA and Gd-MnMEIO peaked at 0.5 min and gradually declined thereafter. Gd-MnMEIO (like Gd-DTPA) enhanced T1-weighted images and (like SPIO) T2-weighted images. Marked vascular enhancement was clearly visible on dynamic T1-weighted images with Gd-MnMEIO. In addition, the T2 signal was significantly decreased at 30 min after administration of Gd-MnMEIO. Whereas the effects of Gd-MnMEIO and SPIO on T2-weighted images were similar (p = 0.5824), those of Gd-MnMEIO and Gd-DTPA differed, with Gd-MnMEIO having a significant T2 contrast effect (p = 0.0086). Our study confirms the feasibility of synthesizing an MR contrast agent with both T1 and T2 shortening effects and using such an agent in vivo. This agent enables tumor detection and\n\nAno-Genital Warts and HIV Status- A Clinical Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nDhumale, Shashikant Balakrishana; Sharma, Shimpa; Gulbake, Arvind\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAno-Genital Warts (AGW) like other Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) is associated with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. This study of AGW was done in HIV positive and HIV negative patients. To study the risk factors and clinical presentations of ano-genital warts in HIV positive and negative patients. A comparative, cross-sectional, descriptive study of 25 HIV positive and 25 HIV negative (n=50) AGW patients between 15-60 years of both sex was conducted in Dr. D. Y. Patil Hospital and Research Centre from July 2014 to July 2016. Significant association of HIV positivity (p<0.05) was observed between age group of 15-30 years and HIV negative status (p<0.05) in age group of 31-45 years. HIV positive status significantly higher in patients with self-admitted multiple sexual partners (p<0.01), homosexuality (p<0.05) and presentation with anal warts (p<0.01). HIV negative status correlated significantly with single sexual partner admission (p<0.01) and hetero-sexuality (p<0.05). Gender did not show significant association with number of sexual partners or HIV positivity. Extra-genital or only genital warts had no association with HIV status. Co-STDs though more in number in ser-positive group, did not show any significant association with HIV positivity (p>0.05). No patient presented with changes of malignancy. Four were adolescents below 19 years. Two patients had atypical presentations of giant condylomata i.e., Buschke-Lowenstein Tumour (BLT). HIV positivity was significantly associated with the risk factors of age below 30 years, homo sexuality and multiple sexual partners. Anal warts were significantly common in HIV positive patients. Four adolescents with AGW underline the need for high risk behaviour counselling. No patient had malignant ano-genital warts. Follow up of these patients with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) sub-typing is necessary.\n\nA Coding Variant of ANO10, Affecting Volume Regulation of Macrophages, Is Associated with Borrelia Seropositivity\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHammer, Christian; Wanitchakool, Podchanart; Sirianant, Lalida; Papiol, Sergi; Monnheimer, Mathieu; Faria, Diana; Ousingsawat, Jiraporn; Schramek, Natalie; Schmitt, Corinna; Margos, Gabriele; Michel, Angelika; Kraiczy, Peter; Pawlita, Michael; Schreiber, Rainer; Schulz, Thomas F; Fingerle, Volker; Tumani, Hayrettin; Ehrenreich, Hannelore; Kunzelmann, Karl\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn a first genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach to anti-Borrelia seropositivity, we identified two significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs17850869, P = 4.17E-09; rs41289586, P = 7.18E-08). Both markers, located on chromosomes 16 and 3, respectively, are within or close to genes previously connected to spinocerebellar ataxia. The risk SNP rs41289586 represents a missense variant (R263H) of anoctamin 10 (ANO10), a member of a protein family encoding Clâ channels and phospholipid scram-blases. ANO10 augments volume-regulated Clâ currents (IHypo) in Xenopus oocytes, HEK293 cells, lymphocytes and macrophages and controls volume regulation by enhancing regulatory volume decrease (RVD). ANO10 supports migration of macrophages and phagocytosis of spirochetes. The R263H variant is inhibitory on IHypo, RVD and intracellular Ca2+ signals, which may delay spirochete clearance, thereby sensitizing adaptive immunity. Our data demonstrate for the first time that ANO10 has a central role in innate immune defense against Borrelia infection.

In Ayurvedic texts, Parikartika is described as a complication of Vamana and Virechana as well as complication of Atisara. Ksharasutra was proved successful in the management of fistula-in-ano, piles, and there is a need to try its efficacy in fissure-in-ano. Aim: To evaluate the role of Ksharasutra suturing (KSS) in fissure bed in chronic fissure-in-ano. Materials and Methods: Total 100 patients of chronic fissure-in-ano were selected and randomly divided into two groups (50 in each group). In group-A, patients were undergone by KSS; while in patients of Group-B Lord's anal dilatation followed by KSS was done under spinal anesthesia. The KSS was done once and after slough out of Ksharasutra, the wound was treated for 4 weeks and assessment of the result was done on the basis of gradation adopted. Results: The pain relief on 14th day in Group-A was 86% while in Group-B 100% was observed. As on 7th day in Group-A, oozing was stopped in 68% patients, while in Group-B, oozing was stopped in 82% patients. On 21st day, Group-B showed more healing (85%) as compared to Group-A (69%). In this study 68% of patients were cured. Conclusion: In Group-B (KSS with Lord's anal dilatation) patients were cured early as compared to patients of Group-A (KSS alone).

Anoctamin 5 (ANO5) belongs to the anoctamin protein family that includes calcium-activated chloride channels. However, recent data together with our own experiments reported here add weight to the hypothesis that ANO5 may not function as calcium-activated chloride channel. By sequencing the entire ANO5 gene coding region and untranslated regions in a large Italian GDD family, we found a novel missense mutation causing the p.Thr513Ile substitution. The mutation segregates with the disease in the family and has never been described in any database as a polymorphism. To date, only two mutations on the same cysteine residue at position 356 of ANO5 amino-acid sequence have been described in GDD families. As ANO5 has also been found to be mutated in two different forms of muscular dystrophy, the finding of this third mutation in GDD adds clues to the role of ANO5 in these disorders.

All consecutive fistula-in-ano patients operated between July 2013 and May 2015 were prospectively enrolled. Preoperative MRI was done in every patient. The details of tracts, internal opening and \"complex parameters\" (additional tract or additional internal opening, horseshoe tract, associated abscess and supralevator extension) found at surgery were compared to the findings determined by MRI. A total of 229 patients (424 tracts) with mean age-49.0Â Â±Â 11.3Â years were included. M/F 198/31. James hospital classification: Type I 58, II 20, III 49, IV 86 and V 16. The sensitivity and specificity of MRI in diagnosing fistula tracts were 98.8 and 99.7%, respectively, and in identifying internal opening were 97.7 and 98.6%, respectively. MRI added significant information in 46.7% (107/229) patients which was presence of additional tracts in 71 (66.3%), horseshoe tract in 63 (58.8%), supralevator extension in 16 (14.9%), unsuspected abscess in 11 (10.3%) and multiple internal openings in one patient (1%). The proportion of simple/complex fistula (based on history and clinical examination alone) was 32.8/67.2% which changed to 21.4/78.6% after the MRI scan. MRI added significant information about unsuspecting complex parameters which were missed on history and clinical examination in more than one-third (26/75: 34.6%) of simple fistulae and more than half (81/154: 52.5%) of already known complex fistulae. MRI is highly accurate in diagnosing fistula-in-ano and added significant information about unsuspected complex parameters in over one-third (34.6%) of simple and in half (52.5%) of complex fistula-in-ano.\n\nANO1 in intramuscular interstitial cells of Cajal plays a key role in the generation of slow waves and tone in the internal anal sphincter\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHannah, E. E.; Zhu, M. H.; Lyle, H. E.; Rock, J. R.; Sanders, K. M.; Ward, S. M.; Keef, K. D.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nKey points The internal anal sphincter develops tone important for maintaining high anal pressure and continence. Controversy exists regarding the mechanisms underlying tone development.We examined the hypothesis that tone depends upon electrical slow waves (SWs) initiated in intramuscular interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCâIM) by activation of Ca2+âactivated Clâ channels (ANO1, encoded by Ano1) and voltageâdependent Lâtype Ca2+ channels (CavL, encoded by Cacna1c).Measurement of membrane potential and contraction indicated that ANO1 and CavL have a central role in SW generation, phasic contractions and tone, independent of stretch.ANO1 expression was examined in wildtype and Ano1/+egfp mice with immunohistochemical techniques. Ano1 and Cacna1c expression levels were examined by quantitative PCR in fluorescenceâactivated cell sorting.ICCâIM were the predominant cell type expressing ANO1 and the most likely candidate for SW generation. SWs in ICCâIM are proposed to conduct to smooth muscle where Ca2+ entry via CavL results in phasic activity that sums to produce tone. Abstract The mechanism underlying tone generation in the internal anal sphincter (IAS) is controversial. We examined the hypothesis that tone depends upon generation of electrical slow waves (SWs) initiated in intramuscular interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCâIM) by activation of Ca2+âactivated Clâ channels (encoded by Ano1) and voltageâdependent Lâtype Ca2+ channels (encoded by Cacna1c). Phasic contractions and tone in the IAS were nearly abolished by ANO1 and CavL antagonists. ANO1 antagonists also abolished SWs as well as transient depolarizations that persisted after addition of CavL antagonists. Tone development in the IAS did not require stretch of muscles, and the sensitivity of contraction to ANO1 antagonists was the same in stretched versus unâstretched muscles. ANO1 expression was examined in wildtype and Ano1/+egfp mice with immunohistochemical techniques.

This study characterises for the first time the calcium-dependent chloride channels (CaCC) in the plasma membrane of primary human atrial cardiac fibroblasts by means of the iodide efflux and the patch clamp methods. The calcium ionophore A23187 and Angiotensin II (Ang II) activate a chloride conductance in cardiac fibroblasts that shares pharmacological similarities with calcium-dependent chloride channels. This chloride conductance is depressed by RNAi-mediated selective Anoctamine 1 (ANO1) but not by Anoctamine 2 (ANO2) which has been revealed as CaCC and is inhibited by the selective ANO1 inhibitor, T16inh-A01. The effect of Ang II on anion efflux is mediated through AT1 receptors (with an EC50 = 13.8 Â± 1.3 nM). The decrease of anion efflux by calphostin C and bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM I) suggests that chloride conductance activation is dependent on PKC. We conclude that ANO1 contributes to CaCC current in human cardiac fibroblasts and that this is regulated by Ang II acting via the AT1 receptor pathway. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract Chloride (Clâ) and bicarbonate (HCO3 â) are two major anions and their permeation through anion channels plays essential roles in our body. However, the mechanism of ion selection by the anion channels is largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence that pore dilatation increases the bicarbonate permeability (P HC O3/ Cl ) of anion channels by reducing energy barriers of sizeâexclusion and ion dehydration of HCO3 â permeation. Molecular, physiological and computational analyses of major anion channels, such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), anoctaminâ1(ANO1/TMEM16A) and the glycine receptor (GlyR), revealed that the ion selectivity of anion channels is basically determined by the electric permittivity and diameter of the pore. Importantly, cellular stimuli dynamically modulate the anion selectivity of CFTR and ANO1 by changing the pore size. In addition, pore dilatation by a mutation in the poreâlining region alters the anion selectivity of GlyR. Changes in pore size affected not only the energy barriers of size exclusion but that of ion dehydration by altering the electric permittivity of waterâfilled cavity in the pore. The dynamic increase in P HC O3/ Cl by pore dilatation may have many physiological and pathophysiological implications ranging from epithelial HCO3 â secretion to neuronal excitation.

B.\n\n1963-01-01\n\nAltogether 94 patients with perirectal abscesses and/or fistulae in ano were tested for lymphogranuloma venereum in a Washington, D.C., clinic. They included men and women of low socio-economic status, many of the men being overt psycho-sexual hermaphrodites. The findings were compared with those in a control group of similar sex distribution (females, male homosexuals, male heterosexuals). All persons in the study were tested for lymphogranuloma venereum by the complement-fixation and Frei tests. Homosexuals and persons with rectal lesions were also examined by proctoscopy. Among other findings, a significantly higher frequency of Frei reactors or positive complement-fixation reactions was observed among patients (both male and female) with abscesses than among the controls and among male homosexuals than heterosexuals. The author concludes that lymphogranuloma venereum should be excluded in the differential diagnosis of perirectal abscess and fistual in ano, that homosexuals should be routinely tested for lymphogranuloma venereum, and that sexual perversion should be considered in male patients with ano-rectal disease of lymphogranuloma venereum origin.

Cross-sectional imaging techniques, however, can accurately identify deep abscesses and characterize complex fistulae. MRI is well suited for this examination, with almost no motion artifact, excellent contrast between muscles and fatty spaces, and multiplanar acquisition. A fistula starts from an internal opening in the digestive tube and can end in an abscess cavity or open at the skin at an external opening. The cryptoglandular anal fistulae (fistula-in-ano) are non-specific in origin and are usually simple, whereas specific fistulae are due to many diseases such as Crohn's disease, tuberculosis, trauma, radiation, colloid carcinoma, hidradenitis suppurative, actinomycosis or lymphoma and are often complex. MRI appears useful in the cases with recurrent fistulae, Crohn's disease, when the secondary orifice is atypically placed, during a multistep treatment for complex fistulae, or when an anal stenosis forbids a clinical or ultrasound examination. A good knowledge of the perineum anatomy is required for analysing the fistula tracts. The muscle planes separate fatty spaces which have an important role in the spread of the disease: sub-mucosal space, marginal space, intersphincteric space, postanal space of Courtney, supralevator space, and the two ischioanal spaces on both sides of the anal canal. The anal canal is surrounded by the ring-like internal sphincter, which continues the internal muscularis propria of the rectum, and the external sphincter, which is intermingled with the puborectalis muscle. We perform our MRI examination with an external phased array coil, and we place a cannula to identify the anal canal. The T2W sequences give the more interesting information, but the sequences with fat-suppression and gadolinium chelate injection are also very useful. The MRI examination allows the analysis of: 1) the location of the fistula tracts\n\nEFFICACY OF KSHARA SUTRA MAD FROM PAPAYA AND SNUHI LATEX IN THE TREATMENT OF FISTULA IN ANO\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRao, S.

The pulmonary ventilatory function was measured in 100 patients with the internal piles, the interno-external hemorrhoid and prolapse of rectum, the prolapse of anus was the principal symptom of them. Data from the 100 patients showed that 67% of them were diagnosed with the obstruction of pulmonary ventilation, the ratio was far less in the health control group. FEV 1.0 (mean +/- s) (2011.65 +/- 875) ml, MMF (1.84 +/- 1.24) L/s and PEF (2.34 +/- 1.51) L/s in male patients, (1551.54 +/- 514) ml, (1.57 +/- 0.62) L/s and (1.85 +/- 0.92) L/s in female patients, but those values were higher in the control than in the patients. The statistical analysis was performed and the difference was significant between patients and the control group (P < 0.01). The patients with ano-rectal diseases caused by deficiency of Qi accompanied with obstruction of pulmonary ventilation in different degree and varied sorts, it confirmed that the pathogenesis of ano-rectal diseases caused by deficiency of Qi is related with \"sinking of pectoral Qi\".\n\nIntraoperative body temperature control: esophageal thermometer versus infrared tympanic thermometer.\n\nPubMed\n\nPoveda, Vanessa de Brito; Nascimento, Ariane de Souza\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTo verify the correlation between temperature measurements performed using an infrared tympanic thermometer and an esophageal thermometer during the intraoperative period. A longitudinal study of repeated measures was performed including subjects aged 18 years or older undergoing elective oncologic surgery of the digestive system, with anesthesia duration of at least 1 hour. Temperature measurements were performed simultaneously by a calibrated esophageal thermometer and by a calibrated infrared tympanic thermometer, with laboratory reading precision of Â±0.2ÂºC. The operating room temperature remained between 19 and 21ÂºC. The study included 51 patients, mostly men (51%), white (80.4%). All patients were kept warm by a forced-air heating system, for an average of 264.14 minutes (SD = 87.7). The two temperature measurements showed no different behavior over time (p = 0.2205), however, tympanic measurements were consistently 1.24Â°C lower (p<0.0001). The tympanic thermometer presented reliable results but reflected lower temperatures than the esophageal thermometer.

Current treatment of transphincteric fistulae is controversial, with many options available. We reviewed the history of treatment using cutting setons and present our series of transphincteric fistulae in the light of the series in the literature. Design Literature review and case series. Setting Hospital based coloproctology service Participants 140 consecutive patients presenting with fistula-in-ano were included. Main Outcome Measures The literature pertaining to treatment of transphincteric fistula was reviewed, along with the outcome of various treatment methods for this condition. Data were collected for 140 consecutive patients presenting with fistula- in-ano were assessed for fistula healing, recurrence and complications. Results A total of 140 consecutive patients with fistula-in-ano were identified, of which 111 were cryptoglandular (79.3%). Eighty-one of these 111 were transphincteric (73.0%). At a median follow-up of 35 months (range, 2â83 months), 70 transphincteric fistulae had healed (86.4%), 10 were still undergoing treatment (12.3%) and one patient was lost to follow-up prior to treatment (1.2%). Two patients in this group required a stoma (2.5%), six patients developed recurrence (7.4%); three âtrueâ recurrences (3.7%). One (1.2%) developed a chronic fissure. There were no reported cases of incontinence. Conclusions The management of transphincteric fistula-in-ano is complex and controversial, for which no clear surgical procedure has gained acceptance as the gold standard. This study demonstrates that transphincteric fistulae can be successfully treated using cutting setons. A high healing rate (86.4%), low recurrence rate (7.4%) and a low complication rate (3.7%) are shown, which compares favourably with published rates over a long follow-up.

Bhagandara (Fistula in Ano) can be treated by Kshara Sutra Therapy with minimal loss of sphincter muscle and low reoccurrence rate.\n\nStructural Insights into the PorK and PorN Components of the Porphyromonas gingivalis Type IX Secretion System.\n\nPubMed\n\nGorasia, Dhana G; Veith, Paul D; Hanssen, Eric G; Glew, Michelle D; Sato, Keiko; Yukitake, Hideharu; Nakayama, Koji; Reynolds, Eric C\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe type IX secretion system (T9SS) has been recently discovered and is specific to Bacteroidetes species. Porphyromonas gingivalis, a keystone pathogen for periodontitis, utilizes the T9SS to transport many proteins including the gingipain virulence factors across the outer membrane and attach them to the cell surface via a sortase-like mechanism. At least 11 proteins have been identified as components of the T9SS including PorK, PorL, PorM, PorN and PorP, however the precise roles of most of these proteins have not been elucidated and the structural organization of these components is unknown. In this study, we purified PorK and PorN complexes from P. gingivalis and using electron microscopy we have shown that PorN and the PorK lipoprotein interact to form a 50 nm diameter ring-shaped structure containing approximately 32-36 subunits of each protein. The formation of these rings was dependent on both PorK and PorN, but was independent of PorL, PorM and PorP. PorL and PorM were found to form a separate stable complex. PorK and PorN were protected from proteinase K cleavage when present in undisrupted cells, but were rapidly degraded when the cells were lysed, which together with bioinformatic analyses suggests that these proteins are exposed in the periplasm and anchored to the outer membrane via the PorK lipid. Chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry analyses confirmed the interaction between PorK and PorN and further revealed that they interact with the PG0189 outer membrane protein. Furthermore, we established that PorN was required for the stable expression of PorK, PorL and PorM. Collectively, these results suggest that the ring-shaped PorK/N complex may form part of the secretion channel of the T9SS. This is the first report showing the structural organization of any T9SS component.\n\nStructural Insights into the PorK and PorN Components of the Porphyromonas gingivalis Type IX Secretion System\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGorasia, Dhana G.; Veith, Paul D.; Hanssen, Eric G.; Glew, Michelle D.; Sato, Keiko; Yukitake, Hideharu; Nakayama, Koji; Reynolds, Eric C.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe type IX secretion system (T9SS) has been recently discovered and is specific to Bacteroidetes species.

Fistulas-in-ano in Crohn's disease tend to be complex and have a high recurrence rate. Therefore the role of surgery is generally more conservative. Hydrogen peroxide enhanced transanal ultrasound has proven superior to physical examination, fistulography, computed tomography, and conventional ultrasound in demonstrating the fistula tract. This study examined the fistula tracks in patients with Crohn's disease. Forty-one patients with Crohn's disease and fistula-in-ano were investigated using physical examination, sondage of the fistula, proctoscopy and transanal ultrasound. Hydrogen peroxide was infused via a small catheter into the fistula. The main track and the ramification of the fistula were classified according to the anatomical Parks' classification. Only 9 (22%) patients had a single inter- or transsphincteric fistula. In 5 (12%) patients a single supra- or extrasphincteric fistula (high fistula) was found, in 14 (34%) more than one fistula track (ramified), and in 13 (32%) an anovaginal fistula. Thus 78% of patients had a surgically difficult to treat fistula. In the ramified fistula the main track follows the Parks' classification, but ramifications can have a bizarre pattern which is not in agreement with this classification. Optimal documentation by means of hydrogen peroxide enhanced transanal ultrasound is therefore mandatory before surgery or before other therapies such as anti-tumor necrosis factor treatment.\n\nThe PorX Response Regulator of the Porphyromonas gingivalis PorXY Two-Component System Does Not Directly Regulate the Type IX Secretion Genes but Binds the PorL Subunit\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVincent, Maxence S.; Durand, Eric; Cascales, Eric\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Type IX secretion system (T9SS) is a versatile multi-protein complex restricted to bacteria of the Bacteriodetes phylum and responsible for the secretion or cell surface exposition of diverse proteins that participate to S-layer formation, gliding motility or pathogenesis. The T9SS is poorly characterized but a number of proteins involved in the assembly of the secretion apparatus in the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis have been identified based on genome substractive analyses. Among these proteins, PorY, and PorX encode typical two-component system (TCS) sensor and CheY-like response regulator respectively. Although the porX and porY genes do not localize at the same genetic locus, it has been proposed that PorXY form a bona fide TCS. Deletion of porX in P. gingivalis causes a slight decrease of the expression of a number of other T9SS genes, including sov, porT, porP, porK, porL, porM, porN, and porY. Here, we show that PorX and the soluble cytoplasmic domain of PorY interact. Using electrophoretic mobility shift, DNA-protein co-purification and heterologous host expression assays, we demonstrate that PorX does not bind T9SS gene promoters and does not directly regulate expression of the T9SS genes. Finally, we show that PorX interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of PorL, a component of the T9SS membrane core complex and propose that the CheY-like PorX protein might be involved in the dynamics of the T9SS.

Este trabalho tem por objetivo analisar os conhecimentos bÃ¡sicos em astronomia dos alunos de EM da escola estadual Batista Renzi, bem como investigar os meios atravÃ©s dos quais estes conhecimentos foram adquiridos. Para tanto foi elaborado um questionÃ¡rio de mÃºltipla escolha aplicado a 310 alunos distribuÃ­dos entre as trÃªs sÃ©ries do EM dos perÃ­odos matutino e noturno. Dessa forma, observou-se que apenas 34,5% relacionaram as estaÃ§Ãµes do ano Ã inclinaÃ§Ã£o do eixo de rotaÃ§Ã£o da Terra, 21,3% indicaram a influÃªncia gravitacional da Lua e do Sol como responsÃ¡veis pelo fenÃ´meno das marÃ©s, 24,5% indicaram corretamente quais sÃ£o os objetos celestes mais prÃ³ximos da Terra, 36,1% identificaram ano-luz como uma medida de distÃ¢ncia e 34,2% reconheceram uma estrela cadente como meteoro. Em contrapartida, 67,1% compreendiam a sucessÃ£o entre dia e noite, 73,9% identificaram o Sol como estrela e 52,3% relacionaram o Big Bang Ã origem do Universo. AlÃ©m disso, foram comparadas as respostas de alunos de diferentes sÃ©ries e perÃ­odos, observando-se, dentre outras coisas, que os estudantes do terceiro ano apresentam um percentual de acertos semelhante ao dos alunos do primeiro, caracterizando que a abordagem de tÃ³picos relacionados Ã astronomia no EM nÃ£o tem contribuÃ­do para uma maior compreensÃ£o dos fenÃ´menos e conceitos.\n\nSize matters at deep-sea hydrothermal vents: different diversity and habitat fidelity patterns of meio- and macrofauna\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGollner, Sabine; Govenar, Breea; Fisher, Charles R.; Bright, Monika\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSpecies with markedly different sizes interact when sharing the same habitat. Unravelling mechanisms that control diversity thus requires consideration of a range of size classes. We compared patterns of diversity and community structure for meio- and macrofaunal communities sampled along a gradient of environmental stress at deep-sea hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise (9Â° 50â² N) and neighboring basalt habitats. Both meio- and macrofaunal species richnesses were lowest in the high-stress vent habitat, but macrofaunal richness was highest among intermediate-stress vent habitats. Meiofaunal species richness was negatively correlated with stress, and highest on the basalt. In these deep-sea basalt habitats surrounding hydrothermal vents, meiofaunal species richness was consistently higher than that of macrofauna. Consideration of the physiological capabilities and life history traits of different-sized animals suggests that different patterns of diversity may be caused by different capabilities to deal with environmental stress in the 2 size classes. In contrast to meiofauna, adaptations of macrofauna may have evolved to allow them to maintain their physiological homeostasis in a variety of hydrothermal vent habitats and exploit this food-rich deep-sea environment in high abundances. The habitat fidelity patterns also differed: macrofaunal species occurred primarily at vents and were generally restricted to this habitat, but meiofaunal species were distributed more evenly across proximate and distant basalt habitats and were thus not restricted to vent habitats. Over evolutionary time scales these contrasting patterns are likely driven by distinct reproduction strategies and food demands inherent to fauna of different sizes.

Compounds I-III are isostructural and crystallize in the trigonal crystal system. The structures of I-III are built of hydrated magnesium cations [Mg(H2O)6](2+) and mononuclear [AnO2(C2H5COO)3](-) complexes, which belong to the AB(01)3 crystallochemical group of uranyl complexes (A = AnO2(2+), B(01) = C2H5COO(-)). Peculiarities of intermolecular interactions in the structures of [Mg(H2O)6][UO2(L)3]2 complexes depending on the carboxylate ion L (acetate, propionate, or n-butyrate) are investigated using the method of molecular Voronoi-Dirichlet polyhedra. Actinide contraction in the series of U(VI)-Np(VI)-Pu(VI) in compounds I-III is reflected in a decrease in the mean AnâO bond lengths and in the volume and sphericity degree of Voronoi-Dirichlet polyhedra of An atoms.\n\nA ConcepÃ§Ã£o de Universo entre Alunos do Ensino MÃ©dio de SÃ£o Paulo e suas Fontes de AquisiÃ§Ã£o\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAraÃºjo, M. A. A.; Elias, D. C. N.; Amaral, L. H.; AraÃºjo, M. S. T.; Voelzke, M. R.\n\n2006-08-01\n\nNesse trabalho procurou-se identificar por meio de um questionÃ¡rio as concepÃ§Ãµes de Universo, de espaÃ§o e tempo que sustentam a visÃ£o de mundo de um grupo de 270 estudantes de Ensino MÃ©dio, pertencentes a trÃªs escolas de SÃ£o Paulo. As questÃµes relacionadas aos conhecimentos prÃ©vios dos estudantes permitiram constatar que hÃ¡ pouco conhecimento acerca dos temas investigados, destacando-se que apenas 20% dos alunos foram capazes de relacionar as semanas com as fases da lua, enquanto 28% associaram as estaÃ§Ãµes do ano Ã inclinaÃ§Ã£o do eixo de rotaÃ§Ã£o da Terra e 23% tinham noÃ§Ãµes das distÃ¢ncias entre objetos celestes prÃ³ximos da Terra. Enquanto 56% conseguiram relacionar o Big Bang com a origem do Universo, verificou-se que 37% reconheciam ano-luz como unidade de distÃ¢ncia e 60% concebiam o Sol como uma estrela. No que se refere Ã s fontes de aquisiÃ§Ã£o que proporcionaram esses conhecimentos, apesar de 60% dos alunos indicarem a escola como principal fonte dos conhecimentos de Ast! ronomia, verificou-se claramente que para a maioria dos alunos seus conceitos ainda sÃ£o inadequados, havendo necessidade de aprimoramento da abordagem desses conteÃºdos, pois apesar de popular, a Astronomia ainda Ã© veiculada de maneira pouco esclarecedora e com imprecisÃµes. Nesse contexto, sÃ£o discutidas algumas possÃ­veis contribuiÃ§Ãµes que podem ser dadas para o ensino de Astronomia pelo uso das ferramentas computacionais nas escolas.\n\nNK receptors, Substance P, Ano1 expression and ultrastructural features of the muscle coat in Cav-1(-/-) mouse ileum.\n\nPubMed\n\nCipriani, G; Serboiu, Crenguta S; Gherghiceanu, Mihaela; Faussone-Pellegrini, Maria Simonetta; Vannucchi, Maria Giuliana\n\n2011-11-01\n\nCaveolin (Cav)-1 is an integral membrane protein of caveolae playing a crucial role in various signal transduction pathways. Caveolae represent the sites for calcium entry and storage especially in smooth muscle cells (SMC) and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). Cav-1(-/-) mice lack caveolae and show abnormalities in pacing and contractile activity of the small intestine. Presently, we investigated, by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunohistochemistry, whether the absence of Cav-1 in Cav-1(-/-) mouse small intestine affects ICC, SMC and neuronal morphology, the expression of NK1 and NK2 receptors, and of Ano1 (also called Dog1 or TMEM16A), an essential molecule for slow wave activity in gastrointestinal muscles. ICC were also labelled with c-Kit and tachykinergic neurons with Substance P (SP). In Cav-1(-/-) mice: (i) ICC were Ano1-negative but maintained c-Kit expression, (ii) NK1 and NK2 receptor immunoreactivity was more intense and, in the SMC, mainly intracytoplasmatic, (iii) SP-immunoreactivity was significantly reduced. Under TEM: (i) ICC, SMC and telocytes lacked typical caveolae but had few and large flask-shaped vesicles we called large-sized caveolae; (ii) SMC and ICC contained an extraordinary high number of mitochondria, (iii) neurons were unchanged. To maintain intestinal motility, loss of caveolae and reduced calcium availability in Cav-1-knockout mice seem to be balanced by a highly increased number of mitochondria in ICC and SMC. Loss of Ano-1 expression, decrease of SP content and consequently overexpression of NK receptors suggest that all these molecules are Cav-1-associated proteins.

There are number of diseases were after repeated surgery. Fistula-in ano is one such condition which is prone to recurrence even after repeated surgery and can be effectively treated by Ayurvedic medicines. An extensive work has been done on the treatment of Bhagandara by Kshara sutra exploring various aspects of the problem and finding our the solution to them1. the present study is related to similar type of medicated thread known as Aragvadadi Sutra which has been mentioned by sushruta in Bhagandara. It consists of Aragvadha (Cassia fistula), Haridra (Curcuma longa), Agaru (Aquilaria agalocha), Madhu (Honey) and Ghrita (Ghee). This is the first non-caustic thread being tried on different types of Bhagandara. Especially it is a painless thread, non-irritant and very useful in sensitive patients like children, females and elders.

R.\n\n2014-08-01\n\nA Astronomia Ã© um tema que sempre exerceu fascÃ­nio sobre as pessoas de um modo geral. Conhecer e estudar o que hÃ¡ nos âcÃ©usâ, alÃ©m de nossos olhos, continua sendo instigador e de grande interesse. Baseado nestas justificativas desenvolveu-se uma pesquisa de Doutorado, na qual, o objetivo principal foi investigar sobre a presenÃ§a dos conteÃºdos de Astronomia nas Propostas Curriculares da regiÃ£o Sul do Brasil, a saber, os estados de ParanÃ¡, Rio Grande do Sul e Santa Catarina e, posterior comparaÃ§Ã£o com os ParÃ¢metros Curriculares Nacionais (PCN) que trazem propostas de conteÃºdos para toda a EducaÃ§Ã£o BÃ¡sica brasileira. Tal investigaÃ§Ã£o pautou-se na abordagem de carÃ¡ter qualitativo e utilizouse para tal da AnÃ¡lise de ConteÃºdos (Bardin, 2011), que possibilitou a construÃ§Ã£o de quatro categorias, nas quais os conteÃºdos astronÃ´micos foram agrupados: Terra, Sistema Solar, Via LÃ¡ctea e Universo. ApÃ³s a leitura, coleta de dados, construÃ§Ã£o de categorias, observou-se a dicotomia na apresentaÃ§Ã£o destes conteÃºdos. As propostas curriculares analisadas foram as de Geografia, CiÃªncias e FÃ­sica dos estados do ParanÃ¡ (2008), Rio Grande do Sul (2009) e de Santa Catarina (1998), responsÃ¡veis pelo trabalho com Astronomia nestes estados. No Ensino Fundamental, a proposta curricular do estado do ParanÃ¡ apresenta conteÃºdos ligados Ã Astronomia desde o sexto ano atÃ© o nono ano, como conteÃºdo do primeiro bimestre, o que tambÃ©m Ã© apresentado na proposta curricular do estado do Rio Grande do Sul, porÃ©m, este, nÃ£o divide os conteÃºdos por bimestre e nem por ano, mas por ciclos, sexto e sÃ©timo anos como primeiro ciclo e oitavo e nono anos como segundo ciclo, deixando livre para o professor estruturar sua sequÃªncia de conteÃºdos. A proposta curricular de Santa Catarina nÃ£o apresenta estes conteÃºdos de maneira explÃ­cita, nÃ£o divide dos conteÃºdos nem por ano, nem por sÃ©rie, traz uma sequÃªncia de conteÃºdos para serem trabalhados ao longo dos\n\nANOS1: a unified nomenclature for Kallmann syndrome 1 gene (KAL1) and anosmin-1\n\nPubMed Central\n\nde Castro, Fernando; Seal, Ruth\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract It is accepted that confusion regarding the description of genetic variants occurs when researchers do not use standard nomenclature. The Human Genome Organization Gene Nomenclature Committee contacted a panel of consultants, all working on the KAL1 gene, to propose an update of the nomenclature of the gene, as there was a convention in the literature of using the âKAL1â symbol, when referring to the gene, but using the name âanosmin-1â when referring to the protein. The new name, ANOS1, reflects protein name and is more transferrable across species.
