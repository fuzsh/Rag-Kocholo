Saturday's wedding was Show's second, as the 50-year-old actor was married to model Pollyanna McIntosh from 2004 to 2010. His 45-year-old bride was married twice before to Dennis Hopper from 1989 to 1992 and to "Third Rock From the Sun" actor French Stewart from 2004 to 2009.

The stars' wedding took place in Los Angeles' The Oak Grove at Ribbit Tree & Plant Nursery on Saturday.

LaNasa paired Prada shoes with a wedding gown by Naeem Khan for the event, while Grant wore a custom-made suit by Di Stefano Italian Fashion Group, according to People.

Both actors maintain very busy schedules. LaNasa recently starred as Will Ferrell's wife in the new release "The Campaign," and the actress will appear in upcoming films "The Frozen Ground" and "Jayne Mansfield's Car."

Alternately, Grant will appear in the horror film "The Possession" in theaters later this month. Also, he is set to begin filming Lifetime's "Devious Maids" this year.

LaNasa is well known for guest-starring on NBC's "Two and a Half Men," and she will appear in a new murder mystery series "Infamous" in the future.

Many fans of both actors have wished the newlyweds their best wishes on Twitter following the news of their nuptials.

"Congrats to Grant Show and Katherine LaNasa," posted Twitter user Emily.

"One month engagement," noted Twitter user Dave. "Apparently that is all Grant Show and Katherine LaNasa needed."

Debra added, "Well, that was quick!"
