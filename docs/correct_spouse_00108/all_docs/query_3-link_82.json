His 45-year-old bride was married twice before to Dennis Hopper from 1989 to 1992 and to \"Third Rock From the Sun\" actor French Stewart from 2004 to 2009.\n\nThe stars' wedding took place in Los Angeles' The Oak Grove at Ribbit Tree & Plant Nursery on Saturday.\n\nLaNasa paired Prada shoes with a wedding gown by Naeem Khan for the event, while Grant wore a custom-made suit by Di Stefano Italian Fashion Group, according to People.\n\nBoth actors maintain very busy schedules. LaNasa recently starred as Will Ferrell's wife in the new release \"The Campaign,\" and the actress will appear in upcoming films \"The Frozen Ground\" and \"Jayne Mansfield's Car.\"\n\nAlternately, Grant will appear in the horror film \"The Possession\" in theaters later this month. Also, he is set to begin filming Lifetime's \"Devious Maids\" this year.\n\nLaNasa is well known for guest-starring on NBC's \"Two and a Half Men,\" and she will appear in a new murder mystery series \"Infamous\" in the future.\n\nMany fans of both actors have wished the newlyweds their best wishes on Twitter following the news of their nuptials.\n\n\"Congrats to Grant Show and Katherine LaNasa,\" posted Twitter user Emily.\n\n\"One month engagement,\" noted Twitter user Dave. \"Apparently that is all Grant Show and Katherine LaNasa needed.\"\n\nDebra added, \"Well, that was quick!\""
