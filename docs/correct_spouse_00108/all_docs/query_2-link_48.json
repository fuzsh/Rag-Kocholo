        "text": "Pollyanna McIntosh was a Scottish actress who was best known for her role as Jadis on AMC's zombie-horror series \"The Walking Dead\" (AMC, 2010- ). McIntosh was born in Scotland but spent the better part of her formative years in Portugal and Colombia, where she easily absorbed the rich histories of both countries. In her early teens she returned to her native Scotland where she was immediately bit by the acting bug. She got her first brush with performing at the age of 16, when she appeared on stage in The Edinburgh Festival. From that moment on, McIntosh decided to devote her life to acting, and immediately moved to London to focus on her stage craft. Before long she was appearing in plays all across London by prominent playwrights such as Irvine Welsh. McIntosh stayed in London until 2004, honing her acting craft the entire time, before finally making the move across the pond to Hollywood, where she hoped to pursue more screen acting work. She nabbed her first role, a small part, in the 2005 horror film \"Headspace\" (2005), and from there her Hollywood acting career took off. McIntosh landed several more film roles over the course of the next decade, most notably \"Exam\" (2009), \"Offspring\" (2009), and \"The Woman\" (2011). In 2013 McIntosh nabbed her first recurring TV role on the CBBC series \"M.I. High\" (CBBC, 2007-2014), and appeared in 13 episodes of the series. McIntosh continued landing film and TV parts over the next few years, before landing her breakout role in 2017 on AMC's \"The Walking Dead.\" McIntosh played Jadis on the series, with her character debuting on the eighth season of the popular zombie drama."
