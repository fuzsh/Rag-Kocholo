I know \"plus size\" is relative when it comes to models and maybe she's lost weight, but she looks way too skinny to be posing in a Lane Bryant ad.\n\nWow never realised he was 49, what a DILF!\n\nShe looks a bit.... not quite sure\n\nI was just about to say 'gee he looks like Archer from PP', then I did my research and found out he IS Archer from PP.\n\nI'm an idiot.\n\nI used to have such a crush on him back in his Melrose days. NGL, he's still pretty hot.\n\nThis guy is in so many Lifetime movies, I love him.\n\nremember when he was on that cbs summer show about swingers in the 70's and had that ENORMOUS pornstache?\n\n....i'll see myself out."
