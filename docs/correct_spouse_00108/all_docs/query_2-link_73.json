        "text": "_\n\nIf you were a fan of the original \"Beverly Hills, 90210,\" there's a pretty good chance you followed Jake Hanson home on his motorcycle to \"Melrose Place.\" With adultery, explosions and characters who came back from the dead, it's hard to forget the residents of the Los Angeles apartment complex. Wonderwall.com is taking a look at how the actors and actresses from \"Melrose Place\" have changed over the decades.\n\nKeep reading to see what Courtney, Heather Locklear, Thomas Calabro and the rest of the cast of the hit '90s show look like now…\n\nMORE: '90s heartthrobs: Where are they now?\n\n_\n\nAndrew Shue played struggling writer Billy Campbell on \"Melrose Place\" from 1992 to 1999. The actor, who's the younger brother of actress Elisabeth Shue, also briefly played professional soccer in the '90s for teams including the Anaheim Splash and the Los Angeles Galaxy.\n\nMORE: '90s supermodels: What they're doing (and look like) now\n\n_\n\nFollowing his stint on \"Melrose Place,\" Andrew Shue stepped back from acting and focused on DoSomething, the global nonprofit he co-founded in the '90s, as well as the social networking site CafeMom.com, which he helped launch in 2006. He worked with sister Elisabeth Shue, brother John Shue and director brother-in-law Davis Guggenheim to make the 2007 film \"Gracie,\" in which he also appeared. Andrew and floral designer Jennifer Hageney, with whom he has three sons, divorced in 2008 after more than a decade of marriage. In 2010, he married ABC News journalist Amy Robach. In November 2022, DailyMail.com reported that Amy and Andrew split over the summer amid a cheating scandal, reporting that she had moved on with \"Good Morning America\" co-host T.J. Holmes, who was also married.\n\nMORE: Talk show host scandals, feuds and controversies\n\n_\n\nCourtney Thorne-Smith played troubled Allison Parker on \"Melrose Place.\" She also dated her \"Melrose Place\" on-screen love interest, Andrew Shue, in real life.\n\nMORE: Find out what '90s female singers are up to (and look like) now\n\n_\n\nFollowing her portrayal of Allison Parker on \"Melrose Place,\" Courtney Thorne-Smith starred on the hit TV series \"Ally McBeal\" from 1997 to 2002, on \"According to Jim\" form 2001 to 2009,\" then on \"Two and a Half Men\" from 2010 to 2015. After a brief marriage to genetic scientist Andrew Conrad ended in divorce in 2001, she married Roger Fishman in 2007. The couple welcomed their first child, Jacob Emerson, in 2008.\n\n_\n\n\"Dynasty\" and \"T.J. Hooker\" star Heather Locklear joined the cast of \"Melrose Place\" as icy advertising exec Amanda Woodward at the end of the first season.\n\n_\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Heather Locklear starred on \"Spin City,\" earning two Golden Globe noms for her efforts. She reprised her role as Amanda on the \"Melrose Place\" reboot in 2009 but the show was canceled after one season. Since then, Heather's personal life has made more headlines more than her acting career. She's faced arrests for alleged DUI, domestic violence and battery amid a struggle with addiction issues. Following years of ups and downs including psychiatric holds and treatment stints, she's been sober since 2019 and has started working again, most recently starring in the 2021 Lifetime movie \"Don't Sweat the Small Stuff: The Kristine Carlson Story.\" She divorced Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee in 1993 — the same year she joined \"Melrose Place\" — after seven years of marriage and was married to Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, with whom she shares daughter Ava, from 1994 to 2006. She and \"Melrose Place\" co-star Jack Wagner were briefly engaged in 2011 following a few years of dating; she later moved on with plastic surgeon Marc Mani, from whom she split in 2016. Heather has been engaged to her high school boyfriend, Chris Heisser, since 2020.\n\n_\n\nGrant Show's character, bad boy Jake Hanson, was first introduced on \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" as a manual laborer and close friend of Dylan McKay. Jake was initially attracted to Kelly Taylor, but their relationship never took off because she was still in high school. On \"Melrose Place,\" he opened a motorcycle shop and later bought hangout spot Shooters amid his romances with the apartment complex's female residents.\n\n_\n\nSince the end of \"Melrose Place,\" Grant Show has popped up in a number of TV movies, guest starred on a few TV series and appeared on Broadway in the late '90s. From 2013 to 2016, he starred on \"Devious Maids\" and from 2017 to 2022, Grant starred as Blake Carrington on the reboot of the delicious '80s drama \"Dynasty.\" The actor married Pollyanna McIntosh in 2004 but it wasn't meant to be — they divorced in 2011. The next year, he wed actress Katherine LaNasa and in 2014, they welcomed daughter Eloise.\n\n_\n\nThomas Calabro was the only cast member to remain on \"Melrose Place\" for the show's entire run from 1992 to 1999. Before playing Dr. Michael Mancini on the TV drama, the actor began his career in the theater at Fordham University. He landed a role as Oberon in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" after his classmate, Denzel Washington, dropped out of the play.\n\n_\n\nAfter his days on \"Melrose Place\" came to an end, Thomas Calabro enjoyed guest roles on shows like \"Nip/Tuck,\" \"Greek\" and \"Glee.\" In 2009, he joined the cast of the short-lived \"Melrose Place\" reboot, reprising his role as Dr. Michael Mancini. Thomas has three children — Connor, Augie and Luna — from his marriage to Elizabeth Pryor. The pair divorced in 2006. He married advertising executive Lisa Nichols in 2015.\n\n_\n\nLaura Leighton became a fan favorite on \"Melrose Place\" after she joined the cast in 1993 as Sydney Andrews, Jake's trouble-magnet younger sister, and remained on the series until 1997.\n\n_\n\nAfter \"Melrose Place,\" Laura Leighton played an aspiring actress on \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" for six episodes in 1998. She returned as the allegedly dead Sydney Andrews on the CW's short-lived \"Melrose Place\" reboot before joining the cast of the hit teen drama \"Pretty Little Liars\" from 2010 to 2017. In 1998, she married \"Melrose Place\" co-star Doug Savant, with whom she has two children, Jack and Lucy; she's also a stepmom to his two kids from a previous marriage, Arianna and Madeline.\n\n_\n\nWhen Daphne Zuniga joined the cast of \"Melrose Place\" midway through season 1 as photographer Jo Reynolds — replacing Amy Locane to become part of the main cast — she was known for her breakout turn playing a Princess Leia-inspired character in the hysterical 1987 Mel Brooks farce \"Spaceballs.\" She left after four seasons.\n\n_\n\nDaphne Zuniga joined the cast of \"One Tree Hill\" in 2008. She also rejoined the cast of \"Melrose Place\" when it was rebooted for a new generation in 2009. The environmental activist briefly dated actor Billy Marti before marrying David Mleczko, who co-founded the PR company Signature Green, in 2019 after more than a decade of dating.\n\n_\n\n\"General Hospital\" star Jack Wagner played Dr. Peter Burns, who romances residents including Amanda, on \"Melrose Place\" from season 3 to 7.\n\n_\n\nAfter \"Melrose Place\" ended, Jack Wagner worked on \"Titans,\" returned to \"General Hospital\" and later appeared on \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" before landing a starring role on the Hallmark Channel's \"When Calls the Heart\" from 2014 to 2022. Co-star coupling seems to be his thing! In 2007, Jack — who split from \"General Hospital\" colleague Kristina Malandro for good in 2005 after two kids and more than a decade of marriage, following a failed reconciliation attempt — began dating his old \"Melrose Place\" love interest Heather Locklear. The couple announced their engagement in 2011 but called it off just a few months later. In June 2022, Jack and Kristina suffered a terrible tragedy when they lost son Harrison, 27, to a drug overdose.\n\n_\n\nRob Estes went from starring on the series \"Silk Stalkings\" to joining the cast of \"Melrose Place\" a few seasons in. Though he guest starred early on, he returned as a series regular in a different role — restaurateur Kyle McBride — from 1996 to 1999. He married \"Melrose Place\" co-star Josie Bissett in 1992 a few months before the FOX drama debuted.\n\n_\n\nAfter leaving the show, Rob Estes focused on expanding his family with wife and co-star Josie Bissett. The couple welcomed son Mason in 1999 and daughter Maya in 2002 before divorcing in 2006. He found love again with teacher and surfer Erin Bolte, whom he married in 2010; they welcomed a son, Makai, in 2011. After \"Melrose Place,\" Rob appeared on shows like \"Providence,\" \"Suddenly Susan\" and \"CSI: Miami\" before joining the cast of the \"90210\" reboot from 2008 to 2010. In more recent years, Rob's starred in films like \"After We Collided\" and \"After We Fell.\"\n\n_\n\nJosie Bissett played fashion designer Jane Andrews Mancini on \"Melrose Place\" for more than four and a half seasons until she suffered a miscarriage with then-husband and co-star Rob Estes. After some time off from the hit show, Josie returned in 1998 for the final season.\n\n_\n\nAfter reprising her role as Jane on the briefly rebooted \"Melrose Place,\" Josie Bissett — who welcomed son Mason in 1999 and daughter Maya in 2002 before divorcing co-star Rob Estes in 2006 — starred in \"The Wedding March\" movie series for Hallmark. (The sixth and most recent installment debuted in 2021.) Josie, who relocated to Seattle, married quantity surveyor Thomas Doig in 2017.\n\n_\n\nBefore landing a gig as good-natured gay social worker Matt Fielding on \"Melrose Place,\" Doug Savant played a young Mac Mackenzie on the long-running nighttime soap \"Knots Landing.\" The '80s was a great decade for Doug, as he also appeared in such films as \"Masquerade\" and \"Teen Wolf.\"\n\n_\n\nDoug Savant found love on the set of \"Melrose Place\" — he married co-star Laura Leighton in 1998. They later welcomed two children, Jack and Lucy (Doug also has two children from a previous marriage.) He memorably starred on \"Desperate Housewives\" from 2004 to 2012 and since then has popped up in guest spots on a slew of shows including \"Criminal Minds,\" \"Hawaii Five-0,\" \"9-1-1,\" \"NCIS\" and \"NCIS: New Orleans,\" \"Dirty John\" and more.\n\n_\n\nJuilliard grad Marcia Cross appeared on \"Melrose Place\" as Dr. Kimberly Shaw, one of Michael Mancini's colleagues with whom he has an affair before things get dangerous and wild, leading to a shocking reveal.\n\n_\n\nIn 2004, Marcia Cross found major success when she starred on the hit ABC series \"Desperate Housewives\" from 2004 to 2012, earning an Emmy nod and three Golden Globe nominations for her work. Since then, she's notably popped up on \"Quantino\" and \"You.\" During her run on \"Melrose Place,\" Marcia Cross weathered personal tragedy, losing her partner, actor Richard Jordan, to a brain tumor in 1993. In 2006, she married financial adviser Tom Mahoney, with whom she shares twin daughters Eden and Savannah. In 2018, she revealed she was in remission following a battle with anal cancer.\n\n_\n\nKentucky native Kelly Rutherford had been working for nearly a decade when she joined the cast of \"Melrose Place\" during the latter part of its run as a prostitute who's briefly married to Michael Mancini.\n\n_\n\nAfter her success on \"Melrose Place,\" Kelly Rutherford again struck gold when she landed a gig on \"Gossip Girl,\" on which she starred for five seasons. More recently, she's appeared on shows like \"Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists\" and the \"Dynasty\" series reboot. Her six-month marriage to Venezuelan banker Carlos Tarajano ended in 2002 after just six months. In 2006, she married European businessman Daniel Giersch, but drama soon ensued: Kelly filed for divorce after just a few years while pregnant with their second child, sparking a bitter deportation and custody battle. Daniel, who ultimately settled in Monaco, won physical custody of their children after years of legal battles that led Kelly to file for bankruptcy in 2013."
