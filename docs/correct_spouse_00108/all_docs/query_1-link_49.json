        "text": "Sony’s Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire had no trouble winning a relatively quiet weekend at the box office: Stronger-than-expected Saturday turnout rescued the movie from opening behind the franchise’s last installment.\n\nSunday estimates show Frozen Empire launching with $45.2 million in North America thanks to multi-generational turnout and families. In 2021, the pandemic-challenged Ghostbusters: Afterlife debuted to $44 million. The new movie will need to have decent legs, considering it cost more to make — $100 million, versus $75 million for Afterlife. And there’s still concern that the film hasn’t broadened out to any notable degree in terms of new fans.\n\nOverseas, the Sony tentpole started off with $16.4 million from 25 markets — it has a staggered rollout for competitive reasons — for a global start of $61.6 million. In like-for-like markets, Sony says it is pacing 15 percent ahead of Afterlife. The U.K. leads with $5.3 million, followed quickly by Mexico with $5.2 million.\n\nOn Saturday, rival studios showed Frozen Empire launching in the $41 million range domestically after getting dinged by critics and slapped with a B+ CinemaScore, compared to an A for Afterlife. Sony remained bullish that it would indeed gross $42 million to $44 million after earning $16 million on Friday, including $4.7 million in Thursday previews. The studio turned out to be right, although numbers could shift again when Monday actuals come in.\n\nNearly 40 percent of the weekend gross came from premium format screens, including select Imax locations. (Dune: Part Two still has a large Imax footprint.)\n\nFrozen Empire is a direct sequel to Afterlife, which succeeded in restoring some of the luster to the classic franchise created by the late Ivan Reitman. His son, Jason Reitman, directed Afterlife, but this time turned over helming duties to series co-scribe Gil Kenan. The movie features returning castmembers Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, Celeste O’Connor and Logan Kim, alongside Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and William Atherton, who starred in the original 1980s films. Series newcomers include Kumail Nanjiani and Patton Oswalt.\n\nWritten by Kenan and Reitman, the story follows the Spengler family as they return to the New York City firehouse to team up with the original Ghostbusters, who have developed a top-secret research lab to take busting ghosts to the next level. But when the discovery of an ancient artifact unleashes an army of ghosts that casts a death chill upon the city, demon fighters new and old must join forces to protect their home and save the world from a second Ice Age.\n\nThe weekend’s other new nationwide opener is Neon’s specialty horror pic Immaculate, starring Sydney Sweeney, who is fresh off her hit rom-com Anyone But You.\n\nImmaculate, fueled by younger women, placed No. 4 with an estimated $5 million, in line with expectations for the indie film. The pic, fully financed by Black Bear, earned a C CinemaScore, which isn’t unusual for a horror film.\n\nIn Immaculate, Sweeney plays a devout nun traveling to a remote convent in the picturesque Italian countryside, but her journey soon devolves into a nightmare as it becomes clear her new home harbors a sinister secret and unspeakable horror. It is tracking to open in the low single digits.\n\nLegendary and Warner Bros.’ Dune sequel held at No. 2 with an estimated weekend haul of $17.6 million in its fourth outing, a mere 39 percent drop . The movie will finish Sunday with a sensational domestic cume of $233 million, or thereabouts. It is doing even more business overseas, earning another $30.7 million from 73 markets — including a running total of $44.3 million in China — for a foreign tally of $341 million and $574 million globally. (Legendary East is handling the movie in China).\n\nUniversal and DreamWorks Animation’s Kung Fu Panda 4 is also making news in China, where it opened No. 1 this weekend with a pleasing $26.7 million.\n\nIn North America, Kung Fu Panda 4 is holding in nicely as more kids are sprung from school for spring break. The movie, now in its third outing, earned an estimated $16.5 million for a domestic tally of $133.2 million through Sunday and $268.2 million globally.\n\nRounding out the top five was Lionsgate’s Arthur the King, starring Mark Wahlberg. The movie, about the inspirational bond formed between a dog and a group of professional adventurers, is pacing to earn $4.5 million in its second outing for a subdued domestic total of $14.3 million.\n\nAt the specialty box office, A24 used this weekend to expand Kristen Stewart’s lesbian body building romance-drama Love Lies Bleeding into 1,828 cinemas. The movie, a 2024 Sundance Film Festival entry, earned $1.6 million for a cume of $5.7 million.\n\nVeteran distributor Bob Berney’s new outfit released the doc Carol Doda Topless at the Condor in four theaters in New York, Los Angeles and New York. The pic posted a promising per-screen average of $10,756, and held what Berney calls “Doda-Esque Burlesque” shows at the Roxie in San Francisco and the Nuart in LA.\n\nDomestically, year-to-date revenue is running 9 percent behind 2023, which was hardly a banner year. However, that’s down from a 12 percent gap a week ago, according to Comscore. Hollywood and theater owners remain hopeful that moviegoing will pick thanks to a slew of upcoming tenptoles, including next weekend’s Godzilla v. Kong: The New Empire.\n\nMarch 24, 9 a.m. Updated with foreign grosses and additional domestic grosses.\n\nMarch 24, 3 a.m. Updated with year-to-date domestic grosses.\n\nThis story was originally published at 8:15 a.m. on March 23.\n\nElliot Page came to the Junos Awards on Sunday night to denounce a rollback of LGBTQ2+ rights after the Umbrella Academy star came out as transgender and nonbinary at the end of 2020.\n\n“We are at a time in history where the rights of LGBTQ2+ people are being revoked, restricted and eliminated throughout the world, and the effects are devastating,” Page said when citing the work by the Tegan and Sara Foundation to support and build social change for trans and queer youth at the Junos in his hometown of Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\n“If the world was not so hostile to LGBTQ2+ people, we would see ourselves purely as musicians,” Sara Quin, one half of the Canadian indie pop musicians Tegan and Sara, told the Juno audience. She called out the province of Alberta for recently proposing to restrict health care for transgender youth, including halting access to hormone therapy for children aged 15 and under.\n\n“Advocating for our community’s rights is a great privilege and we are dedicated to confronting any form of discrimination that threatens the well-being of our community,” Sara Quin added as sister Tegan and Page looked on in Halifax.\n\nAlso at the Junos, Canada’s version of the Grammys, on Sunday night, Charlotte Cardin took home the prize for best album of the year for 99 Nights. Cardin came into the Junos with a field-leading six nominations, and she was also the big winner at the 2022 Junos, where she picked up four trophies, including best artist of the year.\n\nOther Juno winners included Nicholas Durocher, also known as Talk, picking up the trophy for breakthrough artist of the year, and Anne Murray, who attended the first Junos in 1970, handing out the group of the year award to The Beaches, an all-women indie rock band with roots in Toronto’s Beaches neighborhood.\n\nAlso on Sunday night, the Juno Fan Choice award, voted on by ordinary Canadian music lovers, went to Karan Aujla, a Punjabi pop music star. An emotional highlight at the Junos this year came when Maestro Fresh-Wes, aka Wesley “Wes” Williams, was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.\n\nThe pioneering Canadian hip-hop artist has had a five-decade career, which includes TV acting credits for The Listener, The Transporter and Mr. D, among other series. On Saturday night, during pre-TV awards prize-giving, Calgary’s Tate McRae earned two Junos for best artist of the year and best single of the year for Greedy.\n\nAnd Tobi also picked up two Junos on Saturday night, for best rap single and best rap album of the year, while Aysanabee nabbed trophies for best songwriter of the year and best alternative album.\n\nA full list of winners is available on the Juno Awards website.\n\n[This story contains major spoilers for The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live episode five.]\n\nThe Walking Dead giveth, The Walking Dead taketh. In its penultimate hour, the Rick and Michonne-centric The Ones Who Live reintroduced one of the mothership series’ most enduring figures: Father Gabriel, the once-cowardly preacher turned warrior-leader of Alexandria, played by Seth Gilliam.\n\nIn the same breath, the spinoff also removed one of the franchise’s other most enduring figures from the board: Jadis, aka Anne, aka Jadis Stokes of the CRM, played by Pollyanna McIntosh. Having appeared in three different iterations of The Walking Dead in a variety of antagonistic roles, McIntosh’s erstwhile leader of the Garbage People is now in the heap herself — though, not without putting up as much resistance as humanly possible.\n\n“She died by a bed on the head, an axe wound, a car crash, a walker and Rick’s gun,” McIntosh tells The Hollywood Reporter as she counts out the myriad ways Jadis suffers in her final episode. “Yeah. Boy. She sure dies for a long time!”\n\nJadis’ end comes at the conclusion of an episode in which she takes center stage, with some flashbacks for good measure. The story is framed by scenes in which Jadis returns to the outskirts of Alexandria where she meets up with Father Gabriel, her onetime lover, now turned confidant. Jadis and Gabriel embark on a series of annual meetings, during which the preacher takes the military woman’s confessions and provides a place where she can truly be herself.\n\n“It’s like the comedy, Same Time Next Year,” Gilliam tells THR about his return, which resolves the brief but intense relationship between Gabriel and Jadis from the early going of The Walking Dead season nine. “He was very much left in the lurch and, even if it was brief, it was extremely intense and fast moving. There was some unfinished business.”\n\nAs the original Walking Dead finished airing only a year earlier, Gilliam says Gabriel was still close enough for him to access, and remains that way in case he’s called back into action again. According to the actor, music is an important part of how he gets into character, and his scenes with Jadis were no different, the two of them relying on “Torn,” made famous by Natalie Imbruglia’s 1997 version of the song.\n\n“Seth always works with music,” says McIntosh, “and I think in this song, it’s relevant.” For her part, the actress had her own playlist, which includes “Down by the River” by Milky Chance and “Little Girl Gone” by Chinchilla. “She’s just always holding onto so much, especially in those scenes with Gabriel. Even the knowledge that Rick is not dead is this huge thing she’s holding onto.”\n\nIn the modern-day storyline, Jadis is going out of her way to make sure Rick is actually dead. She hunts down Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and Michonne (Danai Gurira) and decides to put the two of them down once and for all, resulting in the myriad bloody steps toward her eventual death. According to McIntosh, Jadis’ death was a surprise, if not a huge one.\n\n“I found out I’d be popping my clogs about a week into being in New Jersey,” she says. “But I knew about five months before I left the flagship show, about four-and-a-half years ago now, that we were going to make this. In the interim, [showrunner] Scott Gimple texted me one day and asked if I’d want to be in The World Beyond. I thought that was fun, let’s do more with Jadis! But it ended up being very lucky that I had the time to be on that show, because it helped inform this world in new ways.”\n\nBut when she found out about Jadis’ fate, McIntosh had one question: ‘What do I have to do not to die?’” Not seriously, of course, as the actress makes it clear: “This is part of the deal with Walking Dead. And, what fun to get to do it on that show? Because they’re just so good at making you question a character and really go deep with the nuance of the grays amongst the black and white of humanity. They didn’t disappoint with how they brought me down.”\n\nThe six-episode season of The Ones Who Live releases weekly on Sundays starting Feb. 25 on AMC and AMC+, with the finale releasing next week.\n\n[This story contains spoilers from the first four episodes of The Regime.]\n\nAcross four episodes of HBO‘s The Regime, Kate Winslet has morphed into an evolving tyrant. Her Chancellor Elena Vernham, the populist leader of a fictional, unnamed country identified as being located in Middle Europe, was introduced to viewers as a vulnerable, paranoid and easily influenced ruler who was this close to unraveling. But by the end of the fourth installment in the six-part limited series from Succession writer Will Tracy, Elena has taken her power back — in more ways than one.\n\nThe “Midnight Feast” episode concludes with Elena reuniting with Herbert Zubak (Matthias Schoenaerts), the volatile soldier she had domesticated, elevated to be her right-hand man and then threw out to pasture. She exiled him from her inner sanctum because her imposter-syndrome demons — mainly related to her deceased tyrannical father, whom she regularly visits in the palace mausoleum — got the best of her, and she overcompensated by leading her country into an abrupt annexing of the neighboring (and also fictional) Faban Corridor.\n\nHer dangerous political maneuverings give her new life as the once-erratic leader ultimately calls upon Zubak — after he enacts vengeance of his own by killing the country’s former leader (played by Hugh Grant) with his bare hands. When they lay eyes upon one another after months apart, Elena and Zubak embrace and proceed to have animalistic sex — as her own husband (played by Guillaume Gallienne) and wide-eyed staff are quickly ushered out of the room.\n\nThe scene would be shocking, if The Regime hadn’t already made its tone clear to viewers. When speaking to the series’ co-directors Stephen Frears and Jessica Hobbs, the helmers were clear about their goal: They want the audience to both laugh and be terrified.\n\n“The intent of the show is that it’s dangerously funny,” Emmy-winning Hobbs (The Crown) told The Hollywood Reporter. “You should find yourself laughing and then questioning why you are laughing at something that makes you so uncomfortable, and that’s probably reflective of a lot of real-world situations, which is why we wanted to do it. I loved it. It terrified me. I didn’t quite know how to bring it to screen, and it turned out to be a very good thing.”\n\nFor double Oscar nominee Frears (The Queen), he echoes that both feelings can coexist, which is what drew him to the series upon reading the script. “I’m greedy. I want all those things,” he told THR. “The script was so unusual and intoxicating, and so challenging. The idea that you had to invent a country was wonderful. So I thought about the Marx Brothers, and I said yes.”\n\nTracy, writer and showrunner on the series, was inspired to make The Regime after years of voraciously reading about autocracies, authoritarian leaders and totalitarian states across all countries and time periods. So even though the series can seem eerily prescient at times, particularly with the annexation storyline playing out amid the ongoing war in Ukraine (which took place after pen was put to paper), setting the Winslet-led series in a fictional country was key to making it work. And it proved to be the biggest challenge for the helmers and the crew.\n\n“We’re creating something that doesn’t exist, so you don’t have anything to fall back on. And you are very conscious that you don’t want it to be referencing anywhere in particular, so it actually makes your choices quite tough,” explained Hobbs.\n\nThe country waves a red and blue flag and its national emblem is constantly visible, but the name of the country — which Elena has now withdrawn from NATO — has been hidden so far. The show, which filmed in January 2023, was shot mainly in Vienna.\n\n“You’re examining every costume, every design choice. ‘Where are we putting that? If we’re putting that there, then let’s try to get some of this area into that so it feels global,'” recalled Hobbs of the production process. “So you didn’t feel like we were being specific. It was important to us that it existed in and of itself.”\n\nBut, fictional or not, and prescient or not, there are still underlying messages to take away as viewers continue to watch Elena morph into a dictator of darkly comedic proportions.\n\nOne message, Frears puts quite simply: “Don’t vote for Trump.”\n\nThe Regime releasing in a U.S. election year is a result of the show being delayed due to the writers and actors strikes in 2023. And Frears says that has brought about the biggest real-life comparison that they couldn’t have predicted.\n\n“The reality of Trump [and the presidency] has increased and grown stronger. He was more of a distant idea [when we began],” he said.\n\nHobbs added, “The great job of entertainment is, if you can make something dangerously funny that makes people uncomfortable to laugh at it, maybe they’ll think about the ridiculousness of some of the real world situations, and maybe that will make them think a little about what they could do. That would be a great thing.”\n\nAs The Regime continues with its final two episodes, Elena’s (Winslet) relationship with Zubak will also continue to evolve. When Winslet spoke to THR about returning to television with the role, the Oscar-winning actress talked about the care she put into her chancellor’s mannerisms and dictation, and how quickly she can turn her on and off. “The wigs were originally Kate’s idea,” said Hobbs. “She wanted something where the character could quickly reflect whatever she wanted to be presenting to her people or anyone around her, and such a good way to do it was through hair.”\n\nFrears and Hobbs stressed how integral Winslet, who also executive produces the series, was both behind and in front of the camera. “There was never a second option,” said Frears. Hobbs added, “You cannot imagine someone else doing it.”\n\nWinslet found her version of Elena by the time production began, so the directors got a taste of the character in their first read through. “She could switch her on and off easily. She’s very funny, too. When you’re talking to her at lunchtime and she’s still in character and telling you what she wants to eat, she could be very entertaining,” said Hobbs. “I would describe it like pure clowning. Clowns are the darker side of ourselves expressed through humor, and when you’re portraying someone like Elena, you can get away with an enormous amount. You can be unbelievably outrageous and still say those things, and I think that’s why she keeps appearing.”\n\nThe director says she and Winslet spoke at length about Elena’s narcissistic qualities, which will continue to emerge as the season barrels towards its conclusion, and that, no matter how over-the-top she may appear, there was truth in every scene.\n\n“When you’re portraying a narcissist, they are often unbelievably charismatic and charming people. They need to be, in order to get people to do what they want, but they’re also brilliant disruptors,” said Hobbs. “Kate just understood for the character of Elena that, in any scene, whatever she said in that scene was true for her at that time. There wasn’t truth beforehand or after. That could change. It was a flexible thing. But she could be truthful in herself in that time. And I think that was a great kind of yard stick for her.”\n\nAnd the scenes of Elena in the mausoleum with her dead father are when the actress brought that most to life, in moments where viewers can see the character and no one else can.\n\n“They were her kind of confessional spaces, and they revealed a lot more of who she was,” she said. “Those scenes were tough for Kate. She did them really brilliantly, but they were challenging because they were digging deep into some darker stuff. But the truth is, with Kate, she brings it. She does it. You are there to help her if she needs it, but she doesn’t need a lot of help.”\n\nThe Regime is streaming on Max and releases new episodes Sundays at 9 p.m. on HBO.
