        "text": "Although it might not seem like it, life gives you enough time to do anything you want. \"Melrose Place\" star Grant Show knows it firsthand as he became a dad at 52.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a few failed relationships, including with his first wife Pollyanna McIntosh, Grant Show found love in \"Three Sisters\" star Katherine LaNasa.\n\nMcIntosh, a Scottish writer, director, and actress best known as Jadis in \"The Walking Dead\" franchise divorced Show in 2011 after seven years of marriage. LaNasa came into the actor's life shortly after and has never left.\n\nGrant Show and Katherine LaNasa on June 17, 2013, in Beverly Hills, California | Source: Getty Images\n\nGrant Show and Katherine LaNasa announced their engagement in July 2012 and tied the knot at The Oak Grove at Ribbit Tree & Plant Nursery in Topanga, California, later that year (August 18).\n\nWhile some fans were shocked that the couple married only weeks after going public with their engagement, they were about to start working on different time-consuming projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLuckily, everything went great. LaNasa, who was previously married to late actor Dennis Hopper and \"3rd Rock from the Sun\" star French Stewart, wore a Naeem Khan dress and Prada shoes. At the same time, Show put on a Di Stefano Italian Fashion Group custom suit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne year after the wedding, Show said they were like best friends who kept working to make their marriage work. They did things they don't necessarily enjoy for the other's sake, like playing golf or shopping.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrant Show and his wife also make their time together \"a priority.\" Despite their busy schedules, they do as much as possible to sleep in the same bed at least once every ten days.\n\nLaNasa frequently shares photos of Eloise on social media, and they are adorable.\n\nThe \"Dynasty\" actor added that he and his wife were actively trying to welcome kids. Due to their ages – Show was 51, and LaNasa was 46 at the time – conceiving a kid naturally was \"a little difficult,\" but they were unwilling to give up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately, their determination paid off. Grant Show's daughter was born on March 25, 2014, when the actor was 52. The couple named her Eloise, and she weighed six pounds, three ounces.\n\nShow and LaNasa admitted they were \"truly blessed\" to have a healthy and beautiful child. Although Eloise became their first child as a couple, LaNasa already had a 23-year-old son, Henry, from her marriage to Dennis Hopper.\n\nEven though becoming a dad at 52 is uncommon, other celebrities have also welcomed children after 50: Bruce Willis' youngest daughter joined his family when he was 57, and Steve Martin's first child was born four months after turning 67.\n\nStill, Show and LaNasa have enough time and energy to spend quality time with their daughter. LaNasa frequently shares photos of Eloise on social media, and they are adorable.\n\nOne shows Katherine LaNasa laying on the grass while lifting Eloise with her feet, and another – probably taken by Grant Show – depicts LaNasa and her daughter walking side by side, holding hands."
