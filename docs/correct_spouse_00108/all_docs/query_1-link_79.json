        "text": "\"Melrose Place\" alum Grant Show is as dashing as ever at 58 and now plays tycoon Blake Carrington in the reboot of the hit 80s series \"Dynasty.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans of the long-running 90s soap \"Melrose Place\" will remember Grant Show as the handsome bad-boy biker Jake Hanson. Nearly 30 years later, Show is still making hearts beat faster, on and off the screen.\n\nAfter a career spanning 36 years, Show is still a romantic leading man, on and off the screen. He famously dated many of Hollywood's most beautiful women before marrying wife Katherine LaNasa in 2012.\n\nGrant Show at a press junket for \"Dynasty\" in 2018 in Atlanta, Georgia | Source: Getty Images\n\nRED-HOT ROMANCES\n\nBack in 1984, Show was dating the lovely Judie Aronson at around the time he met \"Baywatch\" star Yasmine Bleeth, with whom he co-starred in the daytime soap, \"Ryan's Hope.\"\n\nShow won a Daytime Emmy nomination for his role as Rick Hyde, but in 1987, he decided to go to London and try his hand at classic theater, and the romance with Bleeth ended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFAME AND \"MELROSE PLACE\"\n\nOn his return to the US, Show guested on a series of hit series, including \"Beverly Hills, 90210.\" Producer Aaron Spelling decided to spin off Show's character Jake Hanson and build a new series around him: \"Melrose Place.\"\n\n\"Melrose Place\" made Show one of the best-known and best-loved actors of the 90s, and he ended up involved in yet another work-place romance, this time with actress Laura Diane Leighton. Show and Leighton dated for 3 years, and although the romance didn't last, the two remained friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMEETING POLLYANNA MCINTOSH\n\nIn 2003, Show was hired by fashion brand Lane Bryant for a shoot, and that is where he met Scottish model/actress Pollyanna McIntosh, 13 years his junior. After a whirlwind romance, the couple married in 2004, but in 2011, McIntosh filed for a divorce.\n\nMcIntosh cited \"irreconcilable differences\" as the cause and asked only for her wedding and engagement ring, a 1960 Mustang convertible, and some of the couple's appliances and furniture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy then, Show had already met the woman who was to become his second wife: actress Katherine LaNasa. Show met LaNasa on the set of the TV series \"Big Love.\"\n\nShow admits that becoming the father to a daughter has made him reevaluate his relationships with women\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actress, who had been married to iconic \"Easy Rider\" actor-director Dennis Hopper, was recovering from her second divorce from \"Third Stone from the Sun\" actor French Stewart. Show revealed:\n\n\"Katherine and I met while filming (...) in 2010. Her son's father, Dennis Hopper, had just died, and while I was attracted to her I thought it best to leave this one alone.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSix months later, Show ran into LaNasa again in Vancouver, and they became friendly. On their return to Los Angeles, the actors started dating, and a year later, they were married.\n\nThen, in March 2014, Show and LaNasa welcomed their first child together, Eloise McCue Show. Eloise is LaNasa's second and Show's only child. LaNasa has a grown-up son, Henry Lee Hopper, 30, from her first marriage to Dennis Hopper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEloise is now 6, and Show admits that becoming the father to a daughter has made him reevaluate his relationships with women. He said:\n\n\"It's made me think I could have been a nicer guy to women in past relationships. I think that is something all men could learn. (...) I appreciate women more now than ever before.\"\n\nAs for his relationship with his wife, Show reveals that at its base is caring, nurturing, and mutual trust. After a lifetime of searching for the perfect woman, Hollywood's heartbreaker has finally settled down.\n\nBEING BLAKE CARRINGTON\n\nShow took up the challenge of depicting Blake Carrington in the reboot of the hit primetime soap \"Dynasty,\" and he had big shoes to fill. Blake Carrington was originally played by the suave and dashing John Forsythe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Blake Carrington from the 1981 series was a very different man -- a controlling power-obsessed man who dominated Krystal, his trophy wife, completely. The 2019 Blake is more than willing to share power and eager to mentor his new wife's career inside his empire.\n\nThe new character suits Show and the man he has become since those long-ago \"Melrose Place\" days: a supportive husband and a loving father who is raising his daughter to be a strong, confident woman."
