        "text": "Nevertheless, she is also known for her popular television character roles such as slick, English candidate Nick Edwards' wife Olivia McAllister, in the acclaimed British television sitcom Bob Servant, The Crime Minister in the hit BBC's children's spy-fi adventures series M.I. High, and Soilder’s ferocious lover and formidable partner in crime Angel, who is angry in nature, and in 2016 started the American Television Drama series Hap and Leonard, which is based on the Hap and Leonard novel written by novelist Nick Damici.\n\nBorn on 15 March, 1979 in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK , Pollyanna has been interested in acting since her childhood. Active in school plays and local plays, Pollyanna enjoyed performing for The Queen's play as Henry the VIII when she was just 9 years old. Her mother enrolled her in acting classes to combat her hyperactivity during childhood. Her mother believed all hat excess energy should be put to good use.\n\nA theatre and drama graduate, Pollyanna was raised in South America, mostly in Colombia and Portugal, thanks to her international trader father who worked for a thread company, but was also an actor in his younger years. However, she later moved to Scotland, where she went to St. George’s School for Girls and was mercilessly bullied. Amazingly, she started modeling in London at the age of 16. It was in 2004 when she decided to finally move to Los Angeles to test her acting chops and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nAs far as Pollyanna’s physique, she possesses a tall height of 5 feet and 11 inches. Impressively, the white English actress is celebrated for her fit, pear shaped body of 34d-28-39 inches. Currently, she wears an elegant, short hair style (hair color: brown). Her current hairstyle was not chosen for a part, it was one she already sported. Several websites have suggested that her busty breasts are the results of breast enhancements. However, Pollyanna has refuted such speculative claims on numerous occasions.\n\nRegardless of whether she had plastic surgery or not, we happily rate her as someone with high physical sex appeal. If you don't know, she is one of the most sought after full-figure models in the country. That means she is not someone who is into extreme dieting. However, what makes the hot model a beautiful personality is her straightforward, hardworking and daring personality. At the end of the day, she is someone who has impressed everyone by portraying tough roles, in spite of being someone from the glamour industry. Cutting her hair by herself to portray the mucky, cannibalistic, physically apt woman, or initiating extreme diet and exercise routines for roles such as Angel and Pc Rachel, Pollyanna has proved that she is a serious actress who not only cares how her characters should behave, but also what they should physically look like when she is portraying them. Looking back, you will see she started her on-screen career in her mid 20's portraying Stacy in the 2005 horror movie Headspace. Now, it's 2016, and she looks healthier and happier than ever. More than that, she has proved her worth as an indie sensation being especially known for specializing in horror or action films, and the occasional comedy."
