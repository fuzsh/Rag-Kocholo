        "text": "Pogues for life!\n\nBut how long will we spend with John B and our favorite treasure-hunting crew?\n\nFortunately, we have all the details about Outer Banks Season 4.\n\nMake sure you bookmark this page, as we'll continue to update it when new information comes in!\n\nHas Outer Banks Been Renewed for Season 4?\n\nBabes, Outer Banks Season 4 was renewed before season three even aired!\n\nThat's how confident Netflix has been in this action-packed adventure involving our favorite group of besties on a mission.\n\nIn February 2023, a pretty epic Outer Banks event took place, featuring many of the cast.\n\nRelated: The Runarounds: Will the Outer Banks Create Similar Magic for Prime Video?\n\nPoguelandia, which took place in Huntington Beach, California, was the place to be.\n\nPart of the immersive fan-friendly event included John B's very own Chase Stokes announcing that the series got renewed for a fourth season.\n\n\"Outer Banks has been renewed for a fourth season! This is an incredible moment for all of us,\" he shared. \"To our cast and crew, thank you so much for all of your hard work.\"\n\nFingers crossed that we'll get a similar announcement ahead of the fourth season, right?\n\nIs Outer Banks Season 4 Currently Filming?\n\nCurrently filming? You guys, it just WRAPPED filming!\n\nDual strikes halted many things, causing many series and their future seasons to be out of whack.\n\nBut now that things are back on track, so is the excitement about what's to come.\n\nFortunately, Outer Banks was able to plug away.\n\nThe series started filming its new season in November 2023 in Wilmington, North Carolina, and it just officially wrapped up filming on June 20.\n\nThe Pogues made a fun announcement about the news, sharing that the season was a \"wrapski\" and teasing another epic journey!\n\nWhen Will Outer Banks Season 4 Be Released?\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have an official premiere date for the new season.\n\nRelated: The Shows That Best Depict Being a Gen-Z Teenager\n\nBut speculation is that it'll likely be in Fall 2024.\n\nAnd now that things have officially wrapped and that the season will go into post-production for touch-ups, the likelihood that we'll be reuniting with the Pogues and the Kooks sooner rather than later is infinitely higher.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see if it drops in the heart of Fall primetime television hitting the airwaves and the impact of that.\n\nAs a notoriously summer show with all the summer vibes, the series is released at a different time of the year.\n\nHow Did Outer Banks Season 3 End?\n\nLet's dust off the sand and refresh our memories of the previous season.\n\nAfter another chaotic ordeal that included John B. mostly splitting up from the group to run off with his father in search of El Dorado, tragedy struck when he lost his father again, officially this time.\n\nSarah could say the same as Ward died after doing one final good deed for the love of his daughter.\n\nDespite some kidnappings, and Kie getting rescued from a sadistic behavior camp by bestie turned beau, JJ, and Pope and Cleo finally making a love connection of their own, the Pogues got their happily ever after.\n\nRelated: The Best Heist Movies on Netflix if You Don't Like Heist Movies\n\nThey found El Dorado's treasure and returned to Kildare as heroes, able to cash in and achieve the success they had been hunting for over the course of three seasons.\n\nShockingly, the finale treated us to an 18-month time-jump that saw these teens now young adults, free from the confinements of high school and parents (not that it EVER held them back in the first place) and moving on to bigger and better things.\n\nJohn B felt like he had found some normalcy, and he and Sarah had a surf shop.\n\nPope went off to school, with Kie saving the turtles and JJ buying a charter boat.\n\nBut all their adult-like plans came to a screeching halt when a wealthy individual sidled up to them and dangled the prospect of another adventure.\n\nBlackbeard's treasure is up for grabs, and the Pogues are just the people to find it.\n\nDespite the finality of the season's time jump, the prospect of a new adventure opens things up!\n\nWhat Will Outer Banks Season 4's Plot Be About?\n\nThe fourth season has the potential to be the most exciting one yet.\n\nWe can easily look at the impending season as a new chapter or ear for the series.\n\nThey've spent three seasons searching for the same treasure and unraveling the same mysteries, but now that those storylines are tied up with a neat bow, the series can explore so much more.\n\nRelated: The Witcher Season 4: Everything We Know So Far\n\nBy aging the characters up a bit, the series gets to mature more, as do the characters and their dynamics.\n\nJohn B. and Sarah will both still be dealing with the loss of their fathers and grieving, and we'll likely get to see how that manifests and changes them in due time.\n\nAnd that may or may not have an impact on their relationship as well.\n\nAnd now that they've matured, there's a level of self-doubt, according to star Chase Stokes, as the Pogues have officially been hired and tasked with finding one of the most famous treasures on earth.\n\nYes, the show introduced Blackbeard into the mix, and it sounds like the showrunners will play around with some of Blackbeard's mythology.\n\nShowrunner Josh Pate has also previously teased that the season will feature many flashbacks to recap what transpired in the 18-month time jump.\n\nWhat Cast is Returning in Outer Banks Season 4?\n\nIt wouldn't be P4L without the Pogues, right?\n\nEven though nearly the entire cast has catapulted to star level and are staying booked and busy these days, they'll all be back for season 4.\n\nRelated: Suits, White Collar, Burn Notice: Why We Still Yearn for USA's \"Blue Sky\" Shows\n\nThe main cast will include:\n\nChase Stokes as John B\n\nMadelyn Cline as Sarah Cameron\n\nJonathan Daviss as Pope\n\nMadison Bailey as Kiara\n\nRudy Pankow as JJ\n\nCarlacia Grant as Cleo\n\nDrew Starkey as Rafe Cameron\n\nThe cast will also include Austin North as Topper.\n\nRelated: Prequel Problems: Why are TV Execs So Fixated with the Past?\n\nDespite the fate of Charles Esten and Charles Halford's characters during season three, it's possible that they will still appear via flashbacks.\n\nAre There New Faces Joining Outer Banks Season 4 Cast?\n\nOf course, there are, and we're excited about who is joining the cast and in what capacity.\n\nJ. Anthony Crane from Billions will play a grief-stricken widow who plays a connective role in leading the Pogues toward their newest adventure.\n\nThe Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live's Pollyanna McIntosh will fittingly guest-star as Dalia, a rogue revolutionary who may prove to be a point of conflict for the Pogues.\n\nDynasty's Brianna Brown is a former colleague and acquaintance of Ward and the island's biggest realtor, who may partner with Rafe for future business deals.\n\nRigo Sanchez, who recurred in Station 19, will play a dangerous pirate of sorts, Lightner, who may be an obstacle for John B and the gang.\n\nMia Challis from FBI: International will guest-star as wild child Ruthie, who takes a shine to Topper, although she may put the \"to\" in toxic!\n\nIs There a Teaser for Outer Banks Season 4?\n\nIf you want a taste of the Pogues, then yeah, there's a quick little teaser that will make you smile.\n\nRelated: Balancing Act: Examining Fans' Influence on Storytelling\n\nWhile it doesn't show us much, it reminds us that a fourth season is coming.\n\nAnd it also totally embodies the characteristics of our favorite Pogue members.\n\nCheck it out!\n\nHow Many Episodes Will Be in Outer Banks Season 4?\n\nWe don't have any official word on this, but it will most likely have ten episodes like the previous three seasons.\n\nIt's not ultra-short, and, thus, the perfect episode count for a series like this!\n\nWhen we get an official episode count, we'll let you know!\n\nWill Outer Banks Season 5 Be Split Into Two Parts?\n\nUnfortunately, we don't know if Netflix will opt to subject another one of its most popular shows to the occasionally frustrating two-part split.\n\nOther hit series such as Bridgerton and YOU have had to endure, while Virgin River had a season followed by a two-episode holiday event a few months later.\n\nIt's too early to know if Netflix will do the same for Outer Banks, but their intention is typically to maintain and gain subscribers and keep people talking about a series for longer periods.\n\nRelated: The Bear Season 3 Round Table: All Sizzle and No Steak\n\nHope for the best; expect the worst.\n\nLet's keep our fingers crossed that they'll drop all the episodes at once and won't break up the momentum that this fast-paced series will likely deliver in its fourth season.\n\nIs There A Trailer for Outer Banks Season 4?\n\nThere is no trailer for the new season yet, but we'll update this post when one drops!\n\nRemember to bookmark this page, Outer Banks Fanatics!\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to when the series returns?\n\nLet's hear it below!"
