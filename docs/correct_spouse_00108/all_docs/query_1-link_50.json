        "text": "This review contains major episode spoilers.\n\n“Become,” the penultimate episode of “The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live,” takes viewers back to a more nostalgic-style of storytelling in the TWDU. On the heels of their rocky escape from the Civic Republic Military, Michonne and Rick are honeymooning their way through Wyoming, enjoying the sights and sounds of a quiet, apocalyptic grassland. Moving from place to place, staying in all sorts of random structures left to rot – this traveling style of survival calls to mind the many episodes of Season 4 and 5 which featured our band of survivors endlessly roaming the countryside. Most memorably, Carl, Michonne, and Rick once had an eventful journey down the railroad tracks in rural Georgia. As the spin-offs in the universe start leaning heavily into more civilized, polished settings, it’s a breath of fresh (or rotten) air to return to the greenery and grass that once defined “The Walking Dead’s” visual aesthetic.\n\nAfter so much tension and turmoil, it’s wonderful to see Rick and Michonne in high-spirits again, slowly sinking back into the dynamic they once had. Later in the episode, the duo flirt and frolic their way into an abandoned national park gift shop. Rick secretly collects gifts for Michonne, breaking off the letters of a custom necklace so that it remains just a shiny “M” on a chain. Who says love is dead in the zombie apocalypse?\n\nIn a classic display of Walking Dead-isms, Rick and Michonne stumble across a small group under attack from some particularly rocky walkers. The duo immediately jump into hero mode, quickly dispatching the shambling enemies. As another act of kindness, they gift the recovering survivors some bagged noodles (not so subtly labeled “Tasteful Noods”). Just as Rick and Michonne start to walk away, the survivors pull out pistols. In a situation that would have caused massive conflict in the main series’ earlier seasons, the duo makes quick work of the hostiles, disarming them almost immediately.\n\nThe brief de-escalation comes across as almost comedic, but viewers shouldn’t expect any less extreme of a reaction from Rick and Michonne after what they’ve experienced over the years. Afterwards, the duo grab their noodles back, take one of the hostiles’ pistols (noticeably a red pistol, red machete anyone?), and give them one more chance to change their ways of survival. The scene at first seems to be nothing more than a fun wink to Michonne and Rick’s skills, but in The Walking Dead world nothing comes without a consequence. The spared survivors cleverly show up later, playing a key role in how the episode shakes out; but more on that later.\n\nOne of the most notable elements from “Become” is the surprising return of Seth Gilliams’ Father Gabriel character, last seen in the flagship series’ finale. The character appears in several brief flashbacks scattered intermittently throughout the episode. At different periods throughout the main show’s timeline, it is revealed that Father Gabriel and Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh) used to have yearly meet-ups in the woods near Alexandria. Jadis would frequently ponder about her sins and decisions, with Gabriel almost serving as a priest in a confession-style dialogue. Gabriel upsettingly recounts the loss of Rick Grimes on the bridge, with Jadis (knowing of his fate) having to keep her lips sealed regarding the livelihood of their seemingly-fallen leader. It’s an interesting dynamic to see on-screen again, although I’d be lying if I said I didn’t forget that Father Gabriel and Jadis’ relationship briefly turned romantic earlier in Season 9.\n\nIt’s great to see a classic “The Walking Dead” character return to the screen and these sequences also grant Jadis a few more intimate and authentic moments before her imminent demise. The narrative placement of these moments in comparison to the broader The Walking Dead timeline is tough to mentally sort out on the spot, but with a quick Google you’ll find that fans have already broken out what events in the main show’s story were occurring during these sequences. The Walking Dead fans are very much still out and about.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, episode 5 sees the grand demise of none other than Jadis AKA Anne. First appearing in Season 7 of the series, Pollyanna McIntosh has felt like a key part of The Walking Dead’s story for many years. Despite slimming the amount of legacy cast leads within its spin-off shows, it’s great to see The Walking Dead still committing to their “no one is safe” mantra in regards to its main characters’ mortality.\n\nKick-started by a dangerously hilarious surprise visit from Jadis while Rick and Michonne lay in bed together (similar to Jesus’ surprise appearance to Rick and Michonne in Alexandria), Jadis’ final stand is commendable and downright captivating. Tied together by hand-to-hand combat, a vicious car chase, and a suspenseful shoot-out, Jadis’ final battle with Rick and Michonne is well-earned and tense. The episode conveniently brings back the disgruntled survivors from earlier, allowing for a wounded Jadis to enlist their help in taking down Rick and Michonne\n\nRick, Michonne, and Jadis shout out at each other amongst the chaos, desperately trying to make an arrangement that results with none of them bleeding out. Jadis’ hostile survivors perish in the fight, bringing us back to a solely Jadis vs. Rick and Michonne matchup. Jadis still boasts the fact that she has stowed a secret document with all of Alexandria’s information at the CRM in the event of her demise. As the fight reaches its intensive end the now re-animated versions of the dead survivors pop up and take a chunk out of Jadis’ neck, perhaps revenge for using them as a punching bag just to get to Rick. As Jadis succumbs from her fatal wound, she reminisces about her journey in the apocalypse. It’s an elegantly written monologue, albeit a bit watered down by cuts to shots from the original The Walking Dead show that stand out due to the drastic difference in video quality.\n\nJadis’ final message sums up her character’s experiences and arc pretty beautifully, showing us that in the end Anne prevailed and “Jadis” was never truly as cold-hearted as the Civic Republic Military wanted her to be.\n\n”I wish I died an artist. It was never about survival. And that life… it was just about truth. And this is mine. The end of my story. My peace,” Jadis proclaims.\n\nThis final dialogue is delivered with such vivid emotion from McIntosh, perfectly conveying the anguish and longing of one wishing for their life before the apocalypse. The entire sequence is intercut with Gabriel and Jadis’s last yearly visit, in which she holds him at gunpoint in order to eliminate any loose ends. As Jadis is defeated in the present day, the events in the flashback unfold only to reveal that Jadis’ opted not to kill Gabriel, choosing her heart over allegiance to the CRM.\n\nMajor props to Pollyanna McIntosh for portraying such a dynamic and eccentric character throughout an ever-evolving series. Much like Dead City, these spin-off shows allow the TWDU to fully explore grand and drastic evolutions of characters from the main series.\n\nBefore dying, Jadis reveals the whereabouts of her secret briefing on Alexandria, laying the seeds for Michonne and Rick’s next journey. Lastly, Jadis reveals that she has a ring on hand, one that Father Gabriel gave to her after remembering Rick’s wishes to marry Michonne back in the main series. They take the ring, Michonne vows to take down the CRM, and soon after Rick executes Jadis before she turns.\n\nTo cap-off yet another phenomenal episode, Rick finally proposes to Michonne using the ring from Father Gabriel in a romantic moment that has been a long-time coming for fans of these characters. Only in The Walking Dead would a character’s gruesome death somehow play a part in a marriage proposal. The soon-to-be newlyweds start their journey back to the CRM, setting up the finale of Season 1(?) of The Ones Who Live.\n\nWith much to cover in only one episode, it seems all but certain that this spin-off will have some sort of continuation within The Walking Dead Universe; even if not under the same name.\n\nHell hath no fury like an overprotective mom in Lifetime Movie Network’s latest thriller, When Mom Becomes a Murderer.\n\nIt’s obviously a ridiculous title that initially seems to reveal all of the movie’s cards, which is frustrating considering that the first two acts treats everything as a mystery. Thankfully writers Declan Dineen, Lucy Foster and Victoria Saxton have a few additional surprises up their sleeves.\n\nUnlike many other recent Lifetime films, there’s an earnest straightforwardness to When Mom Becomes A Murderer. The film opens with recent high school graduate Ellie (Matreya Scarrwener) securing the win for her debate team, much to the delight of her principal father Nathan (Roark Critchlow) and high school counsellor mother Marion (Lauren K. Robek).\n\nAlmost immediately, however, Ellie’s good girl status is put in question when she locks eyes with a cute boy post-debate and secretly plans to go clubbing with “bad girl” Nancy (Emily Giannozio) against the wishes of her best friend Isla (Khamisa Wilsher). Despite being exceedingly bad at sneaking out of the house and disobeying her parents in general, it’s understandable why Ellie wants to break out: Marion is the embodiment of a helicopter parent and she is smothering her daughter (figuratively).\n\nThe plot kicks into gear when Nancy, who has borrowed Ellie’s jacket, is pushed over Gib’s cliff by an unseen assailant. And while Ellie immediately catches her mother in a lie, it takes several more developments, including the reveal that Nancy lodged a complaint against Marion that got the counsellor put on administrative leave, that Ellie starts investigating her mother’s shady past.\n\nThe summary of suspicious behavor includes: Why is Marion so averse to having her picture taken and why does she insist on having no social media presence? Why do they never visit family or talk about the past? Why is Marion so intent on infantilizing Ellie? And why does she lie to Chief Jones (Byron Wilson) about taking the car out on the night of Nancy’s murder?\n\nIn true Lifetime fashion, there’s both a convoluted explanation and more than a few twists, but aside from the seemingly spoiler-y title, all of these developments are treated as a genuine mystery. By withholding the identity of the killer, Dineen, Foster and Saxton spend most of the film exploring red herrings, including Isla’s complicated relationship with Nancy, while also turning Ellie into an amateur sleuth who connects with journalist Simon (Spencer Borgeson) and librarian Carla (Beth Fotheringham) to piece together her mother’s secrets. Naturally, in true mystery form, everyone seemingly has their own secret agenda.\n\nWhile the mystery is treated 90% seriously, there are still moments of silliness that teeter dangerously close to camp. First and foremost is Robek’s performance, which walks a razor’s edge of utter ridiculousness. The mother’s reactions to every single one of her daughter’s infractions is outsized to the point of parody. Marion is terrified when her daughter dares to speak to a boy in the film’s opening scene, and her response only grow in intensity as Ellie’s rebellious acts escalate.\n\nThen there’s the idea of a girl in 2024 who is on the cusp of going away to College who has never a) had a drink, b) dated, or c) done something other than debate and get good grades. It’s so quaint that the film might as well be set in the 50s.\n\nDitto Isla, a goody-two shoes whose concern over Ellie’s investigation would be appropriate for a middle school girl, but makes no sense for a teenager. Certainly there are girls who want to savour a final pre-College summer with their girl friend, but Isla’s definition of friendship lives and dies on ice cream and slumber parties.\n\nThe other extremely silly (and very late-90s) element is When Mom Becomes a Murderer‘s reliance on asthma attacks. The film features no less than five different instances that hinge on Ellie’s (in)ability to breathe, so each time the girl gets into a scrape, out comes Scarrwener’s frantic eye-acting, plus the requisite gasping and sucking on an inhaler. The use of debilitating asthma as a narrative crutch truly feels like something from a bygone era; it’s both hilarious and apt to induce plenty of eye-rolls.\n\nDespite this, Scarrwener is winsome in the lead role. As Ellie’s paranoia about her mother escalates, the screenwriters manage to tow the line between satisfying red herrings and ludicrous developments, and Scarrwener holds it all together capably.\n\nThe film is admittedly light on moments of violence and director Paula Elle is hit and miss when it comes to the tension. For every sequence that works (like the final killer reveal at the site of Nancy’s death), there’s another that doesn’t (like a mother/daughter hiking trip that relies on bad cell service and a rocky quarry).\n\nStill, When Mom Becomes a Murderer works decently well as a mystery. Thankfully it is more than its very obvious title, and there’s enough silliness here that it’s clear that, despite all of heightened teen drama, the film doesn’t take itself too seriously. That’s enough to recommend.\n\nWhen Mom Becomes a Murderer debuts on Lifetime Movie Network Thursday, July 18 at 8pm EST."
