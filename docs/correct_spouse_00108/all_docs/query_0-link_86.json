        "text": "If you're after some escapism, look no further than Outer Banks on Netflix. The series follows a group of friends - the pogues - as they attempt to find some treasure hidden on a desert island, while uncovering the mystery surrounding the disappearance of John B.'s father.\n\nAnd while parts of their story feel idyllic at first (well, the sunshine, mainly), season three watched the gang as they struggled with money issues or finding people they can trust, all while being hunted by a ruthless Caribbean Don.\n\nThankfully, they survived! Which is good news for season four, which sees the Outer Banks gang on a brand new adventure. So, here's everything we know about the fourth season of Outer Banks.\n\nOuter Banks season 4 release date speculation\n\nGood news! Outer Banks revealed in mid-June 2024 that it had officially wrapped filming for season four. In a video shared on social media, the cast told the camera, \"Hey everybody, we just wrapped season 4. We did it! We are super stoked about this season. We hope you love it. See you soon.\"\n\nIn another video, Chase Stokes - who plays John B - said, \"Alright guys, we have officially wrapped season 4 of Outer Banks. It has been a crazy, crazy journey. But it's done.\"\n\nIn a Netflix press release shared in February 2024, the streaming service confirmed we can expect Outer Banks season 4 later in 2024! Woohoo.\n\nGiven the previous release date, we can make an estimation of when it could come out: Outer Banks season three was confirmed in December 2021 with the season coming out at the end of February 2023. If a fourth season were to follow a similar pattern we could probably expect to see it land in mid- to late-2024.\n\nGiven that filming wrapped in June, it's likely to be September onwards.\n\nWhen was Outer Banks season 4 confirmed?\n\nOn 19th February 2023, Netflix revealed the show will officially be back for a season four. The tweet read, \"BREAKING NEWS OUT OF POGUELANDIA: The Pogues (P4L) just dropped a bombshell. @obxnetflix has been renewed for Season 4!\"\n\nSpeaking about the exciting season 4 news, co-creators, executive producers and showrunners Jonas Pate, Josh Pate and Shannon Burke told Variety: \"Seeing Poguelandia come to life was nothing short of spectacular. The Pogues are enjoying an adventure of a lifetime and we now get to map out more twists and turns as the joyride continues into Season 4 of Outer Banks. Thank you to Netflix, our cast and the amazing fans who helped to make this happen.”\n\nOuter Banks season 4 cast news\n\n*SPOILERS* The end of season three sees both Ward and John B's dad killed off, but fans can expect all the rest of the lead cast will be back for another round of episodes:\n\nChase Stokes as John B\n\nMadelyn Cline as Sarah Cameron\n\nMadison Bailey as Kiara\n\nCarlacia Grant as Cleo\n\nRudy Pankow as JJ\n\nJonathan Daviss as Pope\n\nAustin North as Topper\n\nDrew Starkey as Rafe\n\nFiona Palermo as Sofia, in a recurring role\n\nExcitingly, there will also be a whole new bunch of faces in the Outer Banks for this season:\n\nJ. Anthony Crane from Billions) as Chandler Groff, who Netflix describe as \"Darkly grief-stricken over the loss of his wife, he is welcoming to the Pogues on their latest adventure.\"\n\nPollyanna McIntosh (The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live) plays \"Dalia, a revolutionary-like leader and worldly baddie on a plunder who comes face-to-face with the Pogues.\"\n\nBrianna Brown (Dynasty) plays Hollis Robinson: \"the biggest realtor on the island who previously worked with Ward in a successful business deal, she now has her eye on Rafe for a new venture.\"\n\nRigo Sanchez (Animal Kingdom) plays Lightner, \"an imposing stranger with a piratical nerve. This dangerous and calculating outdoorsman appears to test the Pogues.\"\n\nMia Challis from Clickbait plays Ruthie, \"a wild child with a toxic streak who develops a close relationship with Topper.\"\n\nOuter Banks season 4 plot speculation\n\nIn a very vague teaser, Netflix said of season four: \"The treasure hunt is far from over. The Pogues are returning for more action and adventure with a fourth season of Outer Banks in 2024. While one chapter of the Pogues’ story has closed, the next phase of #P4L has only just begun, and the hunt for Blackbeard’s gold is on the horizon. Here’s everything we know so far about the upcoming fourth season.\" Intriguing.\n\nSpeaking with Variety, Madelyn Cline, who plays Sarah Cameron, opened up about how her character has evolved over the years. \"We’ve seen her truly grow up a lot. She’s gone from a teenager who doesn’t have much of a care in the world or responsibilities to having the weight of so many things on her shoulders.\n\n\"[For season three], we continue to piggyback on that with a few wrenches thrown into the mix. She found this voice and she’s learning how to make decisions for herself.\"\n\nCarlacia Grant, who plays Cleo, added to Cosmopolitan US, \"I have some theories. I don't want to ruin them, but I would love to see Cleo's backstory. Like if a person came back from Cleo's past to really explain some of her mannerisms. It's Outer Banks. Her mom died, her dad left, but any of these people could appear somehow.\"\n\nIs there a trailer for Outer Banks season 4?\n\nSadly nothing yet, but refresh your memory with the season 3 trailer instead:\n\nOuter Banks season 3 is now available to stream"
