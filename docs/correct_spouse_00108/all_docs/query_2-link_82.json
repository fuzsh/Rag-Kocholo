        "text": "\"Gal\" Friday! Pollyanna McIntosh\n\nSince I'm going to the Carowinds Amusement Park tomorrow evening to enjoy their annual \"Scarowinds\" Halloween event AND with the second season of AMC's \"The Walking Dead\" premiering on Sunday night, I thought it would be nice to choose an appropriate seasonal lass for this weeks \"Gal\" Friday post.\n\nPollyanna McIntosh grew up in Portugal and Colombia before returning to her birthplace in Scotland where she first began performing on stage at The Edinburgh Festival. She left home for London at sixteen, and soon became involved as both an actress and director in indie filmmaking and theatre. A move to Los Angeles in 2004 coincided with her marriage to actor Grant Show.\n\nIt was as lesbian party girl, Thumper Wint in the 2007 comedy \"Sex and Death 101\" (starring Simon Baker & Wynona Ryder), that critics really began to take note of her unique talent, citing a blend of powerful sexuality and irreverent humor. McIntosh can be seen in a limited release suspense thriller opening today that features her in a demanding turn as the titular character in director Lucky McKee's \"The Woman\", which first premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Starring alongside Angela Bettis (May/Dexter) and Sean Bridgers (Deadwood), McIntosh plays a feral woman at the end of her rope after being forced into \"civilized\" society by a lawyer and his family who capture and imprison her character. AICN describes the film as unusually brutal and gory, so if it's playing in your area and if you like that sort of thing, then check it out."
