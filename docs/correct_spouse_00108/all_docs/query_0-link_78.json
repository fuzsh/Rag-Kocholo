        "text": "Fans of the beloved soap opera Melrose Place are mourning the tragic loss of Brad Johnson, who passed away from COVID-19 at the age of 62 back in February, his family has confirmed.\n\nThe actor, who starred as Dr. Dominick O'Malley in the '90s show, died on February 18 in Fort Worth, Texas, of pneumonia - which he contracted while fighting the deadly virus.\n\nBut what had he been been doing since starring in the Beverly Hills, 90210 spinoff series? In honor of his death, FEMAIL has uncovered everything he - and his Melrose Place costars - have accomplished since the show went off the air 23 years ago.\n\nMelrose Place premiered on Fox in 1992, and went on for seven seasons before it ended in 1999. It followed a group of young adults living in an apartment complex in West Hollywood.\n\nIt was created by Darren Star and Aaron Spelling, and it also starred Heather Locklear, Andrew Shue, Courtney Thorne-Smith, and Thomas Calabro.\n\nAfter the series concluded, many of the stars went on to accomplish a lot - landing roles in a slew of big movies and TV shows, with some even launching major music careers and taking the stage in Broadway productions.\n\nHowever, some were plagued with controversy and scandal, and faced numerous arrests after the show end off the air.\n\nBrad's family released a heartbroken statement on Thursday night, while remembering a man who they said 'lived life to the fullest' but 'was taken too early.'\n\n'He was a true renaissance man,' his family wrote in an obituary. 'He was not only interested in all life had to offer, but was gifted in it as well. Although he was taken too early, he lived life to the fullest. He was larger than life.\n\n'Brad was loved by many and loved people back, a genuine friend, trusted colleague, and a dedicated husband and father, he will never be forgotten, and his legacy will go on.'\n\nHis other acting credits included Steven Spileberg's hit drama Always, CSI, the Kirk Cameron-starring religious trilogy Left Behind, and the syndicated TV series Soldier of Fortune, Inc.\n\nThe most recent role cited on his IMDb page was a 2015 cowboy film called Nail 32.\n\nThe star, who was born on October 24, 1959, in Tuscon, Airzona, had stayed away from films over the last few years, but had been planning a comeback in the Western Treasure Valley - before it was shut down due to the writer and star of the film, Jay Pickett's death.\n\nFrom run-ins with the law to romances between former costars, here's what the stars of Melrose Place have been up to over the last two decades.\n\nAmanda Woodward played by Heather Locklear\n\nHeather, now 60, was born in Los Angeles, California, on September 25, 1961.

Hooker.\n\nShe also starred in the 1984 movie Firestarter (playing Drew Barrymore's mom), superhero movie The Return of the Swamp Thing, and the sitcom Going Places.\n\nShe then played Amanda Woodward in Melrose Place, starring in only four episodes in the first season but being promoted to a regular due to her popularity.\n\nAnd that was just the beginning for Heather.

She spent four weeks there before returning home.\n\nShe faced numerous legal problems throughout her career, and was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in September 2008.\n\nShe eventually pleaded no contest to reckless driving, and was sentenced to three years probation.\n\nIn 2018, the actress was charged with one count of domestic violence and three misdemeanor counts of battery against a police officer.\n\nAccording to reports, her brother had called 911 because of a fight she was having with her then-boyfriend, racer Chris Heisser, and she allegedly kicked three of the officers after they tried to enter her home.\n\nIn the end, she pleaded no contest to the charges and was sentenced to 30 days in a residential mental health facility.\n\nBilly Campbell played by Andrew Shue\n\nAndrew was born in Wilmington, Delaware on February 20, 1967.
