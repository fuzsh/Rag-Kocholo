        "text": "This article contains details from The Devil and Father Amorth, The Exorcist (both film and television show), Belzebuth, The Last Exorcism, Requiem, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, The Taking of Deborah Logan and The Devil’s Doorway – expect spoilers. It also contains details of real-life deaths so some may prefer to avoid those elements.\n\nThe idea for this was originally sparked by The Devil and Father Amorth – a documentary fronted by William Friedkin visiting a priest renowned for his exorcisms. As part of the film, we are introduced to Cristina, a woman who has struggled with supposed demonic possession for some time. The exorcism scenes in The Devil and Father Amorth are shot close-up and feel a great deal like an intrusion on a woman suffering from a severe mental health issue. However, Friedkin (acknowledged as a believer in demonic possession and exorcism) does attempt some balance in consulting medical professionals, although this is secondary to lengthy scenes of Cristina in distress. The consensus seems to be that if nothing medical emerges, then an exorcism might work because if she truly believes she is possessed, only treating that as a legitimate ailment has any hope of serving her.\n\nThe issue with The Devil and Father Amorth is that it presents no actual evidence for why exorcism still exists in modern times, other than the fact that it seems to temporarily soothe the patient where no medication works. It is also shot in the style of a quite poor, low budget TV documentary on ‘real’ exorcists and so loses even further credibility. Cristina is no doubt a tragic figure and her entire family are haunted by her bizarre behaviour. Despite the assurances from those around her that the sessions are helpful, they don’t appear to be and even seem to enhance her belief that she has been corrupted by an external force. As I’m neither a medical nor religious expert I can’t make any real assertion about her issues, but the documentary feels ill-judged. This led me to think a lot about the gendered representation of exorcism – particularly in terms of film and television.\n\nFollowing the Friedkin thread, we have to start with The Exorcist – a film that has set the stage for pretty much every other representation of exorcisms on-screen, for better or for worse. It does certainly set up a perfect victim and goes to great pains to show the continual degradation of a young girl. The ‘girl in soiled nightdress’ has become shorthand for some sort of evil infestation. The Exorcist places the onus on men as the saviours. The women observe many of Regan’s early behaviours and are victimised by them but seek help from both the male-dominated (in the film, at least) medical and clerical worlds.\n\nThe original story that Blatty’s novel is based on involves a young boy as the central figure in the exorcism. The boy from the original case is said to have made a full recovery and continued a normal life. This is in stark contrast to that of women and girls who are involved in such rituals and exorcism is still prevalent today. Most famously, Anneliese Michel was killed during an exorcism rite – her story has been handled numerous times, including a fantastic German film called Requiem. Requiem deals with the conflict between church figures suggesting exorcism as a solution, while the secular world seeks to offer treatment for epilepsy and mental illness. The film leans more towards mental illness, lack of medication and isolation as a cause of Michaela’s troubles. The Exorcism of Emily Rose, also based on the case, hovers between a horror film and courtroom drama to decide if priests and medical professionals were negligent in performing rites. The film offers more energetic, unbelievable scenes that lean toward possession, but as they are told by those involved, the true nature is unknown. Emily Rose also offers the open-minded female lawyer, played by Laura Linney, who despite being agnostic, finds herself defending the clergy.\n\nThe true story of Anneliese Michel is far more distressing and it is difficult to see how anyone could condone the treatment she endured. The fact that photographs of her suffering exist online serve both as a warning about these practices as well as feeling like further exploitation of a very troubled young girl. The fact that many films seize on her case as inspiration while focusing on the physical trauma undertaken by young women is troubling, but it remains a frequent occurrence within the genre.\n\nFor women, the risk of possession is dismemberment, loss of dignity and often eventual death. Usually, women are seen to have put themselves at risk due to indulging in sin or other disobedience. Regan’s possession is brought on by her discovery of the Ouija board that she begins to play with, referencing a mysterious Captain Howdy. There is plenty of material within The Exorcist to make it a ‘family panic’ film, where the broken family unit with a working mother opens young children to danger. A popular theme within the 1970s, the all-female unit at the outset of The Exorcist calls upon male figures for help and in that sense, represents religious values coming back to ‘save’ them from themselves. That is possibly a more cynical reading of the text and this isn’t to say I don’t love The Exorcist as a film, but there are inherently conservative elements within it that are difficult to ignore. Indeed, Emily Gaudette of Bitch Media’s article sums this up within the title as ‘In Most Films About Demonic Possession, Women are Simply Vessels’. Similarly, Maribel Hermosillo’s Mic article posits that exorcism films are about shaming women.\n\nIn Requiem, Michaela’s behaviour is more restrained. In Emily Rose, the titular character does undergo unnatural movements, hoarse screaming and frequently falls into the ‘dirty nightdress’ territory of Regan’s possession. The use of a white nightdress as a basic symbol of domesticity and purity that comes to be soiled and broken is self-explanatory as far as metaphors go, especially when so many victims of possession in these films are introduced as innocent young girls. Nell from The Last Exorcism isn’t a child but is certainly child-like at the outset of the film with one of the first signs of her possession being an increased interest in sexual activity. While this level of conservatism is somewhat understandable in the early 1970s it speaks to the ongoing fear of burgeoning female sexuality in more modern, supposedly more enlightened times. The Taking of Deborah Logan (acknowledging this film is not ideal due to Bryan Singer’s role as a producer) takes the traditional ‘look’ of the possessed young woman and transfers it to an older woman but considerably mutes the sexual elements. Even when under the influence of a demon, older women are still seemingly barred from being presented as sexual beings in their own right.\n\nFor men, there is an opportunity to become a saviour, avenge past failings and forge a closer connection to God (after the obligatory questioning). Even in The Exorcist where both priests die, it is framed as for a noble cause. In contrast to the simple, soiled clothing of the girls they seek to help, much is made of how the priests dress and prepare solemnly for their ritual. Despite the reverence to the tradition depicted in these preparation scenes, the male priests are almost always positioned as oppositional to the Church establishment in one form or another. For Karras (Jason Miller) this is a loss of faith spurred on by his mother’s illness, while Merrin (Max von Sydow) struggles with his health and ability to continue in his role. Often, the decision to undertake an exorcism is framed as a thoughtful one, furthering the idea of men as rational, against the hysterical nature of possessed women they attempt to save.\n\nAs already covered in The Devil and Father Amorth section, there is a wealth of material that exists concerning ‘real’, documented possessions and the fallout from them. These are important artefacts in seeing how culture (and by that I mean both the culture one grows up in and the more narrow art definition) defines how we understand the concept of possession. More importantly, it reveals even more about the gendered differences and perhaps hints that the representations of female victims and knowledgable male saviours both influence and are influenced by popular culture.\n\nHostage to the Devil tells the story of Malachi Martin – where people consider his death to be a direct result of the last exorcism he performed on a young girl. There is considerable debate around his claims. Martin often criticised the Vatican hierarchy and was also criticised by Exorcist writer Blatty for attempting to cash in on the success of the book and film by claiming to be an exorcist. He was a prolific writer and his keen interest in the supernatural elements of religion made him an interesting (and polarising) figure. His death garnered a considerable amount of suspicion with some alleging he had been pushed by a demonic force. Before his death, it is said that he was visiting a young girl who was showing signs of possession.\n\nBelief: The Possession of Janet Moses is an interesting documentary as it moves away from the traditional representation of exorcism as a Catholic concern and into a New Zealand, Māori context. The film chronicles how the family of Janet Moses, believing her to be possessed undertook a mākutu lifting. Nine people in the family were originally charged following Moses’ death from drowning during the rituals. The details are upsetting, with family members using vast amounts of water to cleanse her, forgoing toilet breaks and suspending all other activity over the four days until she passed away. Mākutu lifting, it is stressed by community elders does not involve this and should be a last resort – much in the same way that exorcism is referenced by Catholics. Indeed, in many true tales of exorcism, victims are overwhelmingly female. The following link, detailing the circumstances of Vilma Trujillo’s death is incredibly upsetting but shows how her exorcism is linked to wider issues of misogyny and femicide. Ideas about women being dangerous, unsuitable mothers contribute to a need to take control of their behaviour and in religious or spiritual communities, this seems to take the form of cleansings or other rituals that put women at risk.\n\nA key issue in the act of women undergoing an exorcism is consent. Many women are seen to request an exorcism to rid themselves of imagined demons or untreated health problems. As a result, this often absolves the exorcist of abuses and harsh treatment because the inhabited victim has requested the removal of the demon. In this sense, supposed mental health checks seem ineffective – it feels impossible to imagine that anyone otherwise healthy would consent to many of the actions performed as part of exorcisms.\n\nIt is possible to find rare examples of women who perform exorcisms. The ‘teen exorcists’ are likely the most infamous example. The trio of hyper-religious martial arts enthusiasts preach against ‘demonic’ elements like Harry Potter novels and travel around the world offering spiritual salvation under the watchful eye of a pastor who is the father of two of the girls. Again, the emphasis is on ruling out mental health problems before undertaking any exorcisms, but the appearances on chat shows and claims that exorcism, like drug rehab, is a service that requires payment does give the appearance of a profitable gimmick.\n\nOne of the most refreshing things about the regrettably-cancelled The Exorcist series was that in their second season they made Jon Chow’s loving father Andy the subject of possession instead of the traditional choice of troubled teen Verity (Brianna Hildebrand). It also gave the central priests recurring issues that could not be overcome or escaped through death. Marcus Keane (Ben Daniels) is a gay man who struggles with his faith in a way that feels less solemn and with far more flippancy than would be found in more traditional representations. Tomas Ortega (Alfonso Herrera) is just as susceptible to possession as any of the victims they attempt to help but is not given an easy, or noble way out. In contrast, Verity, although troubled, is thoughtful and resourceful, essentially managing to save herself. In one scene, she adopts Danny Torrance’s walking backwards through the snow from The Shining to great effect, positioning her as a genre-savvy heroine. This subversion is just one of the reasons I wish the show had been given more time to breathe and grow.\n\nSimilarly, Shudder’s Belzebuth offers a more balanced version of possession – offering a gender balance in those possessed. Emmanuel Ritter (Joaquín Cosio) is seen to undergo the physical transformation more commonly seen in female victims. Both Andy in The Exorcist season two and Emmanuel undergo more invasive physical trauma than any of the previous priests. The Exorcist season two also furthers the idea of demons within the Vatican so that Tomas and Marcus, even with their struggles still maintain a sense of integrity that is lost in the institution. Belzebuth also relies on isolated individuals banding together against evil, rather than the established powers.\n\nSo, are modern horrors starting to overturn the idea of the possessed female victim and if so, why? In a religious context, it is worth suggesting that faith in institutions has been rocked by repeated accusations of corruption and abuse so religious figures who are part of that system no longer inspire the authority and trust they had previously. Aislinn Clarke’s The Devil’s Doorway points to abuses within the Irish Catholic church and blends this perfectly with the supernatural in a way that feels genuinely scary but also a scathing critique of people endowed with too much power. The behaviour of men, in general, is perhaps under more scrutiny than ever before. The idea of men as rational, knowledgable figures who can save women from themselves is now challenged perhaps more than ever, both on and off-screen.\n\nThere is research into an inequality that exists in terms of medical treatment for women (and even more so for black men and women). Due to my cis-ness and whiteness, I feel unable to discuss issues with black or trans racial bias in healthcare though would always invite anyone who wanted to share their experience to do so. I am, however, undergoing treatment for an ongoing injury, for which I’ve been questioned about pain and the possibility of my mood influencing the pain, despite having evidence in the form of an MRI scan. Possibly because men under-report health issues, it is seen that women are more likely to complain of pain or ailments. The research suggests that women are less likely to be taken seriously. More distressingly, black Americans are said to receive less effective pain relief than their white counterparts. With such inequality, it is a possible explanation for people seeking answers and treatment outside of the medical establishment.\n\nFrom a creative standpoint, movements like Women In Horror Month and resultant festivals seek to explore work by female and non-binary creatives. The wealth of voices finally finding an outlet means that oppositional takes on the subgenre can emerge and find an audience more easily than before. Different voices can represent a different way of telling the same story. While the popularity and endurance of the exorcism film mean we are unlikely to ever be free of the grubby nightdress, there is certainly room for growing nuance, humanity and critique within those stories.\n\nThis post is part of a larger series of reviews focused on films showing at the Final Girls Berlin Film Festival. You can see more about the festival on their website. Not all shorts have been available for review outside of the festival environment so the website listings may include more films than are included in this post.\n\nHorror has always had a relationship with queerness, however it is debatable how healthy that relationship has been. With Shudder looking to follow the immensely successful Horror Noire (exploring black horror) with a currently untitled queer horror documentary it seems like it is time for more LGBT voices to make the horror genre a home. The films in this block are a mixture of overt LGBT themes and/or films made by LGBT creatives.\n\nSkin\n\nDirected by Audrey Rosenberg, USA, 2019\n\nSkin is a beautiful film that uses fairytale-like tropes to tell a story about self-discovery and acceptance. The arrival of a period hastens an already developing dysphoria for Charlie (Rhys Fehrenbacher). Coupled with bullying at school the difficult feelings drive Charlie to an increasingly androgynous appearance and increasing attempts to escape, separating them from their family. During one bathtime, Charlie is witness to another world, that may just hold what they have always wanted. I would hate to spoil this for anyone as it truly is delivered wonderfully, with an empathetic performance from Fehrenbacher, that I don’t think my words could do it justice. The horror comes from the uncanny nature of what is found, rather than the finding being scary in itself. The film features an incredibly emotional conversation between Charlie and their mother that indicates a level of hope for the future.\n\nTea Parties Are For Babies\n\nDirected by Teja LoBreglio, USA, 2019, International Premiere\n\nTea Parties Are For Babies uses a burgeoning relationship between two women to create an Alice in Wonderland-style tale with a difference. Freshman Emily is watching a couple take part in some enthusiastic PDA in a park when she is approached by Bunny – a beautiful woman who knew her from school. Bunny wants to draw Emily out of her shell and offers to take her to a night club. The film employs flashing, disorientating lights and close-up shots to emphasise the intimate nature of the club and their escalating relationship. Motifs like butterflies feature as symbols of potential rebirth and acceptance into a new world in addition to flashbacks of a young girl’s tea party. The resultant finale feels a little out-of-nowhere but is well-handled enough that it works. As a story about leaving a previous life behind in favour of something more darkly seductive, it is undoubtedly successful.\n\nLabrys\n\nDirected by BJ Colangelo, USA, 2019, European Premiere\n\nLabrys uses a symbol rich in meaning for lesbian communities to create a film about powerfully claiming an identity and making a new start. Leenie (Venchise Glenn) and Jill (Madison Woods) are on their first date when they are rudely interrupted by a man (referred to within the film as Captain Cheesefries due to him repeatedly offering his cheese fries to them, even after they have declined). The ensuing row causes them to leave the bar and there is a heartfelt conversation between the two, Leenie, who is only recently out, recounts that she feels that meeting Jill has been like someone has taken pages from her diary and made them into a person. The two have excellent chemistry that gives the film a lot of heart. Later, a more serious encounter with the man from the bar turns into something incredibly unexpected. Backed up with some great looking effects the surprise is carried off well – I won’t reveal any more so I can’t spoil the surprise. This is an engaging tale with plenty of character.\n\nBlood Orange\n\nDirected by Aliya Haq, USA, 2018, German Premiere\n\nBlood Orange uses a heavily stylised, vibrant colour scheme to create a fashionable juice bar that becomes a world of its own in this interesting short that builds to an excellent reveal. Angela (Shara McGlinn) works at Vitals – a juice bar dealing in faddy juices, especially the Blood Orange. Angela has designs on leaving her small town to move on to greater success, but her friend Em is concerned by this. As Angela increasingly ignores her surroundings in favour of her potential future, she is placed in danger. The reveal is cleverly unwound with the aid of some excellent effects that give this a real feeling of uncanny horror. Superbly confident in its design and the way it unravels throughout director Aliya Haq has a highly skilled eye for creating a space and story that is both engaging and striking.\n\nDestruction Makes The World Burn Brighter\n\nDirected by Kalen Artinian, Produced by Claire Allore, Brendon Whelton, Alexandria Benoit, Canada, 2019\n\nDestruction Makes The World Burn Brighter is a punchy short that takes the ‘what would you do for your partner’ question to extremes. The film takes place in a dystopian environment where food is scarce, likely due to damage caused by industry. Repeated shots of towers pumping out thick smoke cement the idea that there is something wrong with the atmosphere. It is clear that Destruction has been made on a relatively small budget and this is a good example of successful stripped-back storytelling. The muted colours and views of industrial skyline add to the overall mood of the film. Eve (Alexandra Benoit – also a co-writer on the project) is seen caring for her girlfriend Jane (Keeya King) in their flat. With little to no dialogue, King and Benoit have good physical chemistry, essential in a short of this length to add emotional weight. On a trip out of the flat, Eve is unable to obtain any other food and so returns to take drastic action. While the majority of this action takes place off-screen, the effects that are seen are of good quality. There are hints at a wider story that could be built upon but also functions perfectly as a snapshot of love and desperation.\n\nLone Wolf\n\nDirected by January Jones, Australia, 2019, European Premiere\n\nSam is a 15-year-old girl attending a sleepover, trying to ignore her growing feelings for her friend Willow, cruel taunts from mean-girl Blair and battling against changes within her body. The four actresses involved are very natural in terms of their delivery – it feels like teenagers talking to one another, rather than an adult’s perceptions of how teenagers speak. Sam’s arrival at Willow’s house quickly turns sour when she finds that Willow and Blair are at the poolside. Sam’s self-consciousness about her body makes this an uncomfortable experience, made worse by Blair’s repeated sniping. Sam’s issues escalate throughout the evening before reaching a surprising conclusion. The film takes a relatively simple concept and turns it into a metaphor for feeling different and isolated, delivering some quirky effects to further the message. After the frankly adorable punchline to this film, I could not wipe the grin from my face.\n\nThe shorts within this block use horror as a perfect way to express feelings of difference (and the fear/uncertainty of that difference) with an emphasis on the need to find and embrace identity. Many of these shorts also enhance the importance of finding acceptance and love within that identity. While the tone of delivery and stylistic choices differ hugely, these are exciting shorts from exciting voices.\n\nThis post is part of a larger series of reviews focused on films showing at the Final Girls Berlin Film Festival. You can see more about the festival on their website. Not all shorts have been available for review outside of the festival environment so the website listings may include more films than are included in this post.\n\nStatistically speaking, women make up the majority of true crime fans. I would include myself as someone with a great interest in the crimes of serial killers because of the psychology involved, but there is no denying that this is a sometimes complicated relationship, especially when most victims at the centre of true crime media are women. The reasons why women may enjoy true crime content are too numerous to go into here, but I think it makes a great deal of sense that female filmmakers would turn to the genre.\n\nLast Seen\n\nDirected by Drew Van Steenburgen, Written by Annie Powers & Drew Van Steenbergen, USA, 2019, European Premiere\n\nEmily Alderson is the host of true crime podcast Last Seen who looks to take her show to the next level in terms of unbeatable content by solving a murder on her show. It is no secret that the true crime market is heavily saturated by different podcast teams covering different cases in great depth and standing out can be incredibly difficult. To tackle this, Emily takes drastic measures to make sure she can provide the content. The short manages to evoke the tone and feel of a podcast with a running narration but also breaks out into conversations between Emily and people in her life. Peppered with dry humour, including the oft-inappropriate adverts during the horrific content, this is a slickly-edited and mostly loving pastiche of true crime podcasters. It is critical of the white-centric nature of cases and hosts and the pressure on creatives to provide content to increasingly demanding audiences and stay ahead of the competition, ruthlessly if necessary.\n\nSouth Shore\n\nDirected by Xavier Hamel, Produced by Nellie Carrier, Audrey D. Laroche, and Xavier Hammel,2019, European Premiere\n\nSouth Shore is an eerily quiet, sombre film about the aftermath of a young woman’s murder in the area. As the news enters the community, Francine appears quietly distressed. Her involvement in the neighbourhood choir draws her closer to the loss as it is agreed that the group will sing at the woman’s funeral. Shot with an almost blurry, dream-like quality, for the most part, there is a sense of numbness throughout. The film, like the community, has a sense of disbelief and almost detachment from what has happened. Through Francine, we are placed in that area to experience it directly. The film maintains a sense of tension throughout as Francine is increasingly disturbed by the event. A meditation on shock, grief and guilt with a dark edge, this is an impressive short.\n\nKaya\n\nDirected by Catherine Fordham, USA, 2019\n\nKaya follows the titular character on her mission to find her teenage sister who she believes has fallen into the hands of traffickers. Shakira Barrera gives an excellent, highly physical performance that should be commended. Considering the content, it is hardly surprising that this is an uncomfortable watch. Kaya waits until a young girl is let into a motel room and then tries to swap rooms with her so she can gain information about her sister. Impressively, much of the violence is kept off-screen, a trick that only serves to make the reveal that much more powerful. At the outset of the film radio codes from the gathering trucks feel disorientating, like entering a world you know little about, which adds a great deal to the effect of being drawn into a very dark place. The film is incredibly poignant, with the on-screen text over the credits, “May all beings be free” cementing the fact that for many people around the world, trafficking is a horrible reality.\n\nChildren of Satan\n\nDirected by Thea Hvistendahl, Sweden, 2019, German Premiere\n\nChildren of Satan is arguably my favourite of the shorts I’ve covered from the Final Girls Berlin Film Festival. It not only looks stunning, with an incredible location used to great effect but also contains a powerful message about the power of belief causing human beings to do the most extraordinary things. It is so difficult to talk about this without offering spoilers, but the film revolves around a Christian camp for girls. A new girl is introduced who behaves strangely, grabbing others and seemingly entering catatonic states while grunting. Two of the girls begin to believe that she is possessed, an ailment that is brought on by improper behaviour. As the story unfolds with skin-crawling, eerie imagery the pair take every happening as a further sign of her ailment and seek to save the rest of the camp. Despite being given some incredibly lofty, dark material the young actresses are believable, putting on performances that are mature and measured. The beautiful, but stark mountain house with a neon cross on display is such a simple idea, but the contrast between them is incredibly striking. Ending on a stomach-churning note with what feels a great deal like a homage to The Long Good Friday, it offers the audience a long time to reflect on the events of the film.\n\nThe films within this block are not about true crimes, but offer fictionalised accounts of the kind of cases that fascinate people and are told again and again within the media. Striking a balance between showing the brutality of crime, without dwelling too long on gory details, these films highlight issues within society concerning how people interact with the darker elements of life.\n\nThis post is part of a larger series of reviews focused on films showing at the Final Girls Berlin Film Festival. You can see more about the festival on their website. Not all shorts have been available for review outside of the festival environment so the website listings may include more films than are included in this post.\n\nThe #MeToo movement is well known now, due to a resurgence in use of the term in 2017, largely as a reaction to victims of Harvey Weinstein coming forward. #MeToo became a rallying cry from those who had suffered abuse but who were prevented from seeking help or achieving justice. The hashtag originally coined by Tarana Burke in 2006 has become a rallying cry for women who no longer wish to stay silent. The shorts in this block reflect how women navigate professional and personal relationships and the thread of women reclaiming control. It also features some films that highlight the progress still to be made.\n\nWoman in Stall\n\nDirected by Madeleine Sims-Fewer & Dusty Mancinell, Canada/UK, 2018, German Premiere\n\nThere is a powerful sense of unease within this short, enhanced by the directors’ decisions to obscure so much of the male character. By using close ups we never see his facial expressions, meaning that more emphasis is placed on his words, placing the audience in the cubicle with the woman. Using a toilet cubicle door as a physical barrier soon leads to it becoming a barrier to understanding between the pair. The male character shifts from asking questions, that are somewhat intrusive but reasonably harmless into rants about ‘super sensitive feminists’. By keeping her in the stall, the woman is deprived of power – she is told by the man outside that she is in the men’s bathroom, but has no way of checking this for herself. With a simple idea, the clashes caused by miscommunication and mistrust are laid bare.\n\nLili\n\nDirected by Yfke van Berckelaer, The Netherlands, 2019\n\nPossibly the most recognisable #MeToo story within the block, Lili features an actress (Lisa Smit displaying incredible charisma) auditioning for a role. Already impressed with her ability to have learned the lines in advance, the director soon starts to ask for the lines to be delivered in different ways. Using one mid-shot that Smit is the centre of, everything is done between the pair, but we only see Lili. What follows is a depiction of exchanges in power. The way that Lili is directed to change her performance is an indicator of her beginning to lose control of the situation. The static shot is used incredibly well to reflect the quiet escalating tension, culminating in a punchline that is both surprising and visually impressive.\n\nThe Rat\n\nDirected by Carlen May-Mann, USA, 2019, German Premiere\n\nThe Rat uses its 1980s setting to include all the motifs of Americana – Renee (Isabell Shill) is picked up by her boyfriend Jim (Collin Kelly-Sordelet) in a pickup truck, wearing a letterman jacket. On their way to a Halloween party, Jim takes a different route to an abandoned house where their relationship changes. Using the trappings of slasher horrors – the young couple about to have sex, the dark, abandoned house and another factor I won’t go into for fear of spoiling the effect, the film explores how trust between a couple is paramount. The eventual handling is quirky, but instantly understandable as to the point that is being made.\n\nThe Follower\n\nDirected by Stephanie Szerlip, USA, 2019, European Premiere\n\nThe first thing to mention about The Follower is that the film has a wonderful misty look which gives everything a kind of ethereal quality that later enhances the change to something more far sinister. Logan Polish plays Sophie – a young girl with a fondness for posting photographs on social media. Early on repeated ‘likes’ can be seen on her app from one user before she is left home alone and a stranger (Jack Kilmer) appears to spend time with her. The film cleverly uses social media as a launching point for stalking, invasion of privacy and the breaking of boundaries. Kilmer gives a really uneasy performance and his interactions with Polish are suitably intense.\n\nGaslight\n\nDirected by Louisa Weichmann, Australia, 2019\n\nStriking effects and beautiful utilisation of lighting, plus a stirring central performance from Meg McKibbin make this a fascinating short. It invokes the discomfort of being a woman waiting somewhere alone at night as April encounters mysterious stranger Roy (Matt Dwyer). Roy’s attempts to get April into his car play on the fact that she has no one around her who cares enough to pick her up from work. April is tested by and clearly uncomfortable with his actions and the worry that she is completely vulnerable in her loneliness is very effective. Both performances gradually turn up the heat and the night-time setting is wonderfully eerie. Their interaction evolves into a more powerful story about a woman reclaiming her place in the world and rejecting the things she has been told.\n\nRape Card\n\nDirected by Madeleine Sims-Fewer & Nathan Hughes-Berry, USA, 2017, Berlin Premiere\n\nMadeleine Sims-Fewer takes on dual roles (as in Woman in Stall) in this disturbing short in which every man is afforded a ‘rape card’. The concept is horrifying in its simplicity: men are given a licence-type card with their fingerprint on and after they commit their chosen rape, they apply the fingerprint to the victim, rendering the card used. The film tackles the toxic elements involved for both genders in terms of young men being expected to engage in violent, predatory behaviour and the fear that hangs over women. This fear prompts the lead character (played by Sims-Fewer) to seek out a man to attack her. The film is as bleak as it sounds and makes for a fittingly uncomfortable watch as it sets out to deliver a very successful, immensely cynical gut punch. Urgent and dark, interesting visuals and a haunting credits detail make this short feel very powerful.\n\nThe shorts in this block have focused mainly on a female perspective, but also in terms of communication between genders and how the idea of ‘traditional’ roles push both sides into behaviours that cause problems for both. Equally, the films feature powerful messages about reclaiming space and power – most importantly giving a voice to those abused and starting conversations about prevention and protection.\n\nThis post is part of a larger series of reviews focused on films showing at the Final Girls Berlin Film Festival. You can see more about the festival on their website. Not all shorts have been available for review outside of the festival environment so the website listings may include more films than are included in this post.\n\nHorror has a long history of tackling societal issues and anxieties, often using metaphors to deal with challenging subject matter in a way that is easier to digest and even sometimes cathartic for audiences. The Social Ills block of the festival showcases films that seek to tackle social issues.\n\nRe-Home\n\nDirected by Izzy Lee, USA, 2019, European Premiere\n\nRe-Home opens on a close-up shot of Maria (Gigi Saul Guerrero) holding her young daughter at the gates of Future Horizons, a facility that allows Mexican women to rehome their children for a chance at a better life. When Maria meets Laura (Kasey Lansdale) their conversation references the ‘wall’ and the changes brought by that. Despite a sugary-sweet appearance, Laura repeatedly ‘others’ Maria, even when trying to sympathise with her situation. The tension builds almost unbearably during Maria’s meal with Laura and her husband Matt (Morgan Peter Brown) – the balance between them being kind and generous with a constant edge in their choice of words. Maria asserts that she too is an American – a powerful statement in a situation where her rights are being eroded. Guerrero gives a heartbreaking performance with Brown and Lansdale’s delivery punctuating their distance from her emotion. The film steadily builds tension to a sharp conclusion that I did not anticipate.\n\nExam\n\nDirected by Sonia K. Hadad, Iran, 2019, German Premiere\n\nExam follows a day in the life of Sadaf (Sadaf Asgari) as an Iranian girl preparing for a school exam. Her stress around the exam is ignored as she is pressured into delivering a package on her way. Her concerns about being late are disregarded and this leads her to take the package with her to school. Sadaf Asgari is mesmerising in the lead role, easily sustaining the focus as the camera moves fluidly around her. Her class is subjected to a random bag check and this shows the concern about policing hair and behaviour as a further barrier to education. Director Sonia K. Hadid switches from the moving camera to a wide, static shot, but Sadaf is so wonderfully performative that she continues to draw your eye. In an intense scene that illustrates the danger Sadaf finds herself in, Hadid refuses to hide it. This is a film highlighting a serious issue, delivered with great energy.\n\nSnowflakes\n\nDirected by Faye Jackson, UK, 2019 German Premiere\n\nArguably one of the most cathartic films in this block follows two women who are taken to a detention centre. The recent Windrush scandal in the UK should be a greater source of shame for our country and it is all too convenient that the media doesn’t seem to cover the stories of those impacted by it. Esther (Sharon-Duncan Brewster) is sent to a detention centre to be sent to Jamaica even though she has only spent a very small amount of time there and her home is in the UK. Her protestations and the cold responses they garner are genuinely upsetting. Her worry about her cat being trapped in her flat is met with disdain, suggesting she should not have had one. Miriam (Cherelle Skeete) attempts to keep her calm, while also explaining to the guards that God is watching what they do. At the same time, an outbreak starts with surprising consequences, which I wouldn’t want to reveal too much about within this review. Mixing interesting visuals with a melodic score this is an emotionally heavy film covering content that needs more of a voice.\n\nTorching the Dusties\n\nDirected by Marlene Goldman, Canada, 2019, German Premiere\n\nBased on a Margaret Atwood short story Torching The Dusties is an extreme take on the conflict between generations. Frank (Eric Peterson) and his wife Wilma (Clare Coulter) are residents of an upmarket care residence. At the outset, Frank is diagnosed with macular degeneration and warned that as he adjusts to this, he might experience hallucinations as his brain tries to fill in the gaps between what he can and can’t see. At the same time, there is a spate of youth protesters who are attacking nursing homes while wearing baby masks. Some of the attacks are said to be motivated by environmental concerns. Wilma starts to prepare for her and Frank’s safety but Frank is determined to ignore the impending threat. Utilising slow motion for scenes of the protesters enhances the sinister nature of young people violently turning against older people who they blame for the current state of the world. Wilma’s actions at first position her as someone attuned to outside events but soon reveal her sense of self-preservation. Even though it is a feature taken from the original short, the hallucinations and the outside protests don’t quite gel for me as part of the same story, but the moments are still handled with technical expertise that makes them feel unnerving.\n\nReformed\n\nDirected by Samantha Timms, Australia, 2019, German Premiere\n\nThis was my second viewing of this short that uses snippets of brutality to explore the chances of rehabilitation for violent offenders. John (Bob Newman) plays a man released from a correctional facility attempting to get home via a train. The train delay becomes a kind of purgatory for him as he struggles with his past and ability to contain the urges he was imprisoned for. The black dog imagery as a metaphor for his underlying brutality and the use of flashbacks is balanced with his appearance as an approachable and friendly man. There is a moment that appears critical of how people treat ex-offenders which perhaps leads people into further crime. Light and sound are used to great effect as John’s night in the train station becomes increasingly frightening.\n\nTingle Monsters\n\nDirected by Alexandra Serio, USA, 2019\n\nASMR is a huge phenomenon and not one I think I entirely understand, although it is worth mentioning that I think it has been subject to more criticism because it is dominated by young women. It has been under fire for being annoying, sexualised and inane. Taking directorial and lead role duties, Alexandra Serio stars as Dee, an ASMR star who has taken time away from her online platform to process a difficult breakup and a move. The film takes the form of a live stream, featuring text comments appearing on the right side of the screen. There is a mix of commenters – those who idolise Dee as a ‘mom’ type, while others who begin to sexualise her and the video. It soon becomes clear that something is not quite right, with spotty WiFi causing the connection to occasionally stall. Films that take place all on one screen are difficult to pull off and this manages to do it in a way that is simple, but effective while weaving several threads about what it means to be a woman in online and face-to-face interactions. The handling is simple, effective and undoubtedly creepy.\n\nThe social ills strand of short films covers a wide range of issues, introducing some powerful messages, even when using only a short amount of screen time. The array of acting, directing and other creative talent displayed shows just what the horror genre has to offer.\n\nThe Final Girls Berlin Festival has announced the line-up for its 5th edition and it looks very impressive. Including shorts, features and talks, the festival “showcases horror cinema that’s directed, written, or produced by women and non-binary filmmakers”. Taking place at the City Kino Wedding art house cinema in Berlin from February 6th to the 9th, the festival promises a great mix of exciting new releases in addition to revisiting older titles.\n\nThe festival kicks off with a programme of shorts under the theme Bad Romance. Films from Poland, China, Malaysia, Canada, UK and the USA indulge in the exploration of sex, fetishes and the consequences of secrets in relationship.\n\nThe first feature is Mary Harron’s Charlie Says, a film chronicling a graduate’s interactions with the three women involved in the Manson Family murders. Harron’s handling of difficult subject matter in American Psycho makes me feel pretty confident that she’ll cover this in an interesting way.\n\nThe second feature is The Father’s Shadow, a Brazilian film that follows a grieving young girl turning to magic while her depressed father struggles to stay in work. Horror and magic often make very suitable bedfellows so I’m very keen to see how this works.\n\nThe February 7th lineup starts with the talk Horror Comes Home. The talk will be presented by Amanda Reyes and explore the representation of women in television movies from 1964-1999. This is followed by a second block of shorts entitled Social Ills. The block contains a number of films tackling issues of racism, socialism and oppression. I’ve been lucky enough to see the high-quality Reformed previously and if the other films are of this standard this block is likely to be very impressive, if difficult to watch. From the lineup Tingle Monsters about an ASMR blogging live stream has really caught my attention.\n\nAn industry talk with Rue Morgue executive editor Andrea Subissati follows the shorts and the donation-based event looks like a fantastic opportunity for writers to learn from someone with success in horror journalism. Next up is the German premiere of The Deeper You Dig, a story of three characters whose lives collide in mysterious ways. The last shorts block of the day Graveyard Shift promises a collection of the stranger side of horror, featuring zombies, vampires and even one girl’s journey through her own gut. For those keen to extend their day, a party at GR_UND promises experimental films, drag performances and DJs, which sounds like an excellent way to spend a night.\n\nValeria Villegas Lindval starts proceedings on Saturday 8th February with a talk about The Bad Mother in Mexican Horror. A doctoral candidate at the University of Gothenburg, Valeria’s talk looks to track the representation of La Llorona from early cinema to modern genre takes. Andrea Subissati returns for another talk – this time on the use of martyrdom in horror, which you have to know by now is exactly my kind of thing. As God Is My Witness looks to be an informed exploration of a much-misunderstood concept.\n\nSaturday’s first feature is an anthology film bringing together eleven female directors from across Australia. Dark Whispers uses the central device of a book to reveal each woman’s chapter. With #MeToo dominating so many discussions of women in film, it stands to reason that female film-makers would be exploring this in their work. The #MeToo shorts block features a number of films dealing with power, sexual assault and the legal system that so often fails victims.\n\nPerhaps as a chance to recover from dark subject matter the program also includes a horror trivia event hosted by drag performer Vanessa Júpiter. The fact that the talks and events like this are free (donation-based) really allow them to be accessible for all, which feels so important. Shorts program 5 revolves around Queer Horror, including stories of self-discovery and becoming. The True Crime strand plays on the popularity of the genre among women but also looks at female killers, including a short called Watching Karla Homolka that looks at the infamous killer’s ongoing legacy, even after release. Following this is a film I am very interested in, having heard mostly positive feedback from its screening at the Frightfest Halloween event. Swallow, following a pregnant woman who develops a compulsion to swallow dangerous objects feels exactly like the kind of thing I’ll enjoy. The final showing of the day is a screening of Slumber Party Massacre, a film subjected to reappraisal as being far more feminist than the title expresses. It screens with I Was A Teenage Serial Killer, which invokes the spirit of punk, DIY film-making.\n\nThe final day begins with an event I’m not sure I’ve seen at any other festival. How Did She Do That? invites Pretty Deadly Self Defense to show clips, break them down and detail some of the moves involved in famous arse-kicking horror scenes. I can’t imagine anything quite as fun as this on a Sunday morning! After the adrenaline wears off, attendees will be treated to another talk from Orla Smith exploring Outer Threats and Inner Demons: The Changing Face of the ‘Female Monster’. Using films like Julia Ducournau’s Raw, Smith explores the changing role of women as their own antagonists.\n\nThe penultimate shorts block Blood Ties looks at the role that women play in their families, from tormented little sisters, curious daughters and terrified mothers. The final shorts block Folk Tales portrays rituals, strange creatures and myths. Folk horror is often one of my favourite sub genres and the variety of stories within the block offer a wide range of stories to engage with.\n\nThe final talk is a panel involving visiting filmmakers to the event. While these have yet to be announced, it is always interesting to hear directly from filmmakers about the challenges and joys of working within the industry. The last three events are all feature films, starting with Tito, a Canadian film about a recluse who finds his restricted, terrifying life changed by an intruder who offers protection. Next up is Rock Paper Scissors which features three siblings engaging in a number of twisted games. I’m intrigued by this one, having missed it at Frightfest last year. The final film of the festival is the wonderful Hail Satan? a film that perfectly balances its off-kilter characters with very serious messages. I honestly can’t think of a better way to close the festival.\n\nTickets for the entire festival are priced at €68 (approx £58) and are available from this link. You can see more about the program on the Final Girls website – https://www.finalgirlsberlin.com/\n\nWith the recent news that 3 members of The Craft were being booked for conventions while Rachel True was conspicuously absent from proceedings it has really brought home how important ensemble casts are within horror films. The term ensemble suggests that each character within a film is given roughly equal amounts of screen time and the horror genre has done a great deal with the format including playing it straight and also subverting expectations, particularly within horrors aimed at a teen audience where star power is often a big selling point.\n\nWith February being Women in Horror Month I thought there would be no better time to explore some of my favourite groups of women in horror films. For this I’ve excluded duos and have looked to groups of three or more. In addition, I’ve excluded entries where men are part of the ensemble (which rules out a surprising amount). Unfortunately, this list is majority-white, which is perhaps indicative of the fact that BAME characters are frequently sidelined, or that I’m just not watching the right kind of content. I’d love to hear your recommendations for more diverse horror films and am certainly excited to start making my way through the Horror Noire syllabus.\n\nThe key thing about a horror film which revolves an ensemble female cast is that it broadens the character types to be played, even if some still fall into the realm of stereotypes. So often, there are calls for strong female characters to be represented in horror (and other genres, of course) and sometimes I feel that it is interpreted that strong characters are all to be heroic, perfect figures who are able to outrun, outsmart and outshine any villain they come up against. For me, strong characters mean depth, flaws and often becoming villains themselves. This idea is reflected within this list. The list has been arranged in chronological order and will contain spoilers for the films featured.\n\nThe Craft (1996) – Robin Tunney, Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell and Rachel True\n\nThe revelation that Rachel True was being excluded from reunions concerning the film also prompted confessions from True that some of her parts within the film had also been trimmed, meaning that her character was not given the same importance as her white co-stars. While Fairuza Balk’s Nancy Downs is arguably the breakout character that everyone recalls first when thinking about the film, it simply wouldn’t work without the contribution of all the actresses for balance.\n\nThe Craft is primarily a film about four teenage girls struggling to navigate their way through high school and while their interest in witchcraft adds some unique challenges, the majority of what they deal with is based in the teenage experience. All the girls have experiences and backgrounds which cause them to turn further to witchcraft and one another. They are empowered by their relationships, but it is also a story about how power can corrupt and how easily people who want to be seen can go along with it.\n\nIn having four characters who find a kinship with one another, despite their different backgrounds and goals The Craft remains an excellent teen movie, although it has a darker edge. Nancy is undoubtedly a victim of a mental illness, strengthened by her childhood problems and she suffers for it. Bonnie and Rochelle too, are punished for their transgressions and Sarah has to carefully come to terms with her own past and family history in order to improve. While their friendship is doomed to fail, their statement ‘we are the weirdos mister’ serves as a wonderful, subversive moment which kicks back at what young women are ‘supposed’ to be.\n\nJawbreaker (1999) – Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart, Julie Benz and Judy Greer\n\nPlacing Jawbreaker in this article feels like something of a stretch, but this pitch-black comedy clearly owes a debt to the horror genre in terms of its dark comedy and also it’s casting choices involving a number of women who featured in other horror ensembles. McGowan (Scream), Gayheart (Urban Legends), and Benz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) have all worked within teen horror vehicles. The cruelty of high school is also invoked by the casting of a number of actors from Carrie in small roles.\n\nI have fond memories of watching Jawbreaker – its excellent soundtrack, glossy production designs and suitably 90s fashions as well as its acerbic tone make it feel different to other teen movies of its type by being unafraid to deal with dark material and make its central figures truly villainous. As with The Craft there is always a moment where the true villain emerges and in Jawbreaker, it is undoubtedly Rose McGowan’s alpha-bitch Courtney (Satan in heels) who has to face the greatest punishments for her transgressions. Her calm and emotionless, “I killed Liz, I killed the teen dream. Deal with it.” being repeated over and over on a recording from a birthday card reveals her to the school as someone far more toxic than anyone imagined. Courtney truly is a dark figure. As soon as the accident in which their friend is killed by being choked by a jawbreaker in a botched birthday kidnapping, her mind immediately turns to staging a rape and sewing the seeds that the ‘perfect’ Liz Purr had a secret life with much more adult appetites. However, there’s relatively little room for anything too serious within the film – much of the film has its tongue placed firmly in its cheek and certainly owes a debt to Heathers.\n\nLaughably dim Marcie (Julie Benz) is a real highlight of the film. Benz is clearly aware that she’s a sidekick within the ensemble, but her delivery of Marcie’s ditsy dialogue is so joyful it’s impossible for her to fade into the background. Rebecca Gayheart’s Julie is the conscience of the “Flawless Four” and is the most clearly affected by Liz’ death and Courtney’s manipulation of Fern. Fern (Judy Greer being delightful, as always) is a shy, geeky girl who finds out about the death and is promptly adopted by Courtney as a pet project. A zany makeover sequence turns Fern into Vylette (a plant to a flower) and she joins their ranks. Again, it’s a comment on the corruption of popularity within the high school and soon Vylette embraces her position. Fern is an admirer of Liz at the outset of the film and so the chance to become anything like her is particularly tempting. A Pam Grier cameo as Detective Vera Cruz is huge amounts of fun and her questioning sequences with the girls are wonderfully played.\n\nWhile Jawbreaker is mostly a surface-level comedy with a dark edge but little in the way of commentary, it still allows its female characters to be good, bad, but most vitally, interesting. Now, 20 years after the original film, creator Darren Stein is listed as being involved in a Jawbreaker TV series. While little has been revealed about the project thus far, it seems that the accident occurs at a bachelorette party, aging the central group from the original high school setting. If the characters are even a little as fun as the original cast I’m sure it will be an interesting show.\n\nThe Descent (2005) – Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Mendoza, Alex Reid, Saskia Mulder, MyAnna Buring and Nora-Jane Noone\n\nThe first entry on this list which I’d describe as terrifying – The Descent combines the claustrophobic nature of caving with a monster film and also an intense breakdown of female friendships to create a really effective horror which feels ageless thanks to its universal themes and carefully crafted environments.\n\nUnlike the previous entries on this list, The Descent concerns slightly older women with a variety of different priorities in life, but all are invested in extreme sports. This immediately sets The Descent apart from some other female-led films by removing them from traditional domestic situations. In many female-led horror films, the horror invades women’s spaces, whereas in The Descent the female characters go looking for danger and thrills. This separation from domesticity occurs violently for Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) who we see lose her husband and daughter in a car crash a year before the caving expedition. The expedition is organised by Juno (Natalie Mendoza) who seeks to bring Sarah out of an isolated depression following the accident. While Sarah and Juno are central characters the other women are still represented as having their own concerns, opinions and skill sets which lead them to the weekend. Holly (Nora-Jane Noone) is represented as being reckless and in the true fashion of horror is punished for this by enduring a very bad accident in which her leg is broken.\n\nBeth (Alex Reid) acts as a referee between some of the more forceful personalities and is also the most supportive of and sensitive to Sarah. Sam (MyAnna Buring) and Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) are also more calm figures, with Sam’s medical skills helping to stabilise Holly’s leg. Over the course of the film the women all reveal insecurities and flaws which make them vulnerable to attack. Juno is quick to fight the creatures and it is her willingness to fight so quickly which results in her inadvertently killing Beth – the voice of reason and calm. Beth’s death does however reveal another side to Juno in that she had been having an affair with Sarah’s husband before his death. This exposes the tension between the two women as being more than a simple lack of Juno being there for her. It further ruptures Sarah’s idea of her previous life as a wife and mother and forces a confrontation between Sarah and Juno which, according to Linnie Blake evokes the “duelling traditions of the post-Peckinpah Western” ( The Wounds of Nations : Horror Cinema, Historical Trauma and National Identity) – another way in which traditionally masculine behaviour is transposed onto the women.\n\nThe threat of the monsters within the cave, especially given that they have evolved to live and hunt perfectly within the dark and damp atmosphere of the caves is reduced as the women become more dangerous themselves. The Descent has Sarah’s need for vengeance and catharsis through fighting and killing Juno override her ability to save herself or the other women from their hopeless situation. Her turn to something more primal and self-focused is not something usually seen in female characters and this is one of the biggest reasons that The Descent still feels so fresh a number of years on.\n\nThe Woman (2011) – Angela Bettis, Pollyanna McIntosh, Lauren Ashley Carter and Shyla Molhusen\n\nI have made no secret about how much I love The Woman. It is an unashamedly dark piece of work which focuses on a man attempting to ‘civilise’ a feral woman he captures and the impact this has on his wider family. Unlike The Descent where we watch the characters descend (fully intended) into more primal versions of themselves, The Woman begins by showing us a female figure (Pollyanna McIntosh) who has made her own space in the world outside of normal society. She is seen as feral, but with an unspoken understanding with wolves in the area. When taken to the Cleek household by vicious patriarch Chris (played skin-crawlingly well by Sean Bridgers) she remains speechless, responding with only the violence she is capable of enacting from her vulnerable position.\n\nChris Cleek is an absolute monster and his crimes are revealed throughout the film. He is abusive to his wife Belle (Angela Bettis) and daughters Peggy (Lauren Ashley Carter) and Darlin (Shyla Molhusen) while encouraging son Brian (Zach Rand) to experiment with cruelty against The Woman, which soon extends to his classmates. Peggy is clearly the subject of abuse and a suspected pregnancy from her father. While mother Belle is clearly undermined, beaten by and fearful of Chris, she allows her children and The Woman to suffer rather than question him too far. This is why, when Peggy finally decides to unleash The Woman that she attacks Belle with equal ferocity to Chris due to her inaction. It is a complex and upsetting idea, because there is a feeling that Belle was a victim of circumstance, yet she allows that to result in pain and suffering for others.\n\nThe most shocking moment comes as Peggy’s worried schoolteacher approaches the home to confront Chris about his daughter’s pregnancy. The innocent schoolteacher is thrown into the barn with two German Shepard dogs, but also Socket (Alexa Marcigliano) – another feral woman who joins the dogs in their attack. It is the shock of this reveal which prompts Peggy to release The Woman. In The Descent Sarah unleashes her primal nature by choosing to kill Juno, whereas in this film The Woman becomes the physical embodiment of primal violence. Polite society, in the form of an intervening schoolteacher has failed and so Peggy is forced to fight along the same lines, even if she doesn’t possess the violence within her.\n\nThe ending of The Woman features The Woman, Socket, Darlin and Peggy all accepting that a life together in the wilderness is preferable to the chaos left behind and a world that has consistently failed them. Darlin’s reverence and trust of The Woman is especially touching as it is clearly something she has not experienced in her young life. Pollyanna McIntosh has directed a sequel to the film called Darlin which will debut at SXSW on March 9th. While I’m excited for the continuation of the ideas first displayed in this film and cannot wait to see what Darlin has to offer I’m also slightly concerned that the subject of the film hints at the dissolution of the strange family unit formed at the closure of The Woman. Making Darlin the focal point hints at some very interesting possibilities.\n\nAmerican Mary (2012) – Katherine Isabelle, Tristan Risk and Paula Lindberg\n\nIn another example of images being deceiving, it is the female characters who at first appear as unusual and even potentially dangerous who are revealed as innocent people trying to find their way in a world which refuses to see them as anything more than ‘other’. Beatress (Tristan Risk) and Ruby (Paula Lindberg) don’t share a huge amount of screen time with our antihero Mary (Katherine Isabelle) but their characters and impacts have a long-lasting effect on the film.\n\nRuby seeks to turn herself into something more doll-like to protect herself from sexualisation. Beatress’ reasons for her transformation to a Betty-Boop-like figure are not fully explored although it is possible that it adds a unique selling point to her stripping performances. The film elevates the characters from their initial quirks and while Mary originally views Beatress as something of an unusual annoyance she does soften towards her.\n\nThe fact that all three succumb to male violence originally made me feel very despondent about the ending of the film and how much it could actually empower. However, that misses the point of the empowerment and how it moves through the film. Mary’s decline into being more of a villain than a hero after her rape is saddening but also suggests an ability for her to repair herself. This is most effectively realised in the film’s finale where Mary quite literally sews herself back together. She has to die, just because she is so far removed from the girl she started out as, but her death is restorative. In terms of Ruby and Beatress, they are primarily women who are self-actualised and walking their own paths, supported by their own money and means. While it is saddening and maddening that they are attacked that feeling can only be evoked by the fact that we care about them.\n\nThe fact that Mary is irretrievably changed by her attack at the hands of Doctor Grant and even her mutilation of him does not change how she feels (it only serves to send her on a darker path) is a subversion of many other rape-revenge films in which female characters are galvanised by their revenge plans and actions. Far from being a cathartic act, like Sarah in The Descent her desire for vengeance traps her and holds her in place, unable to move on. It would be easy (and perhaps preferable, if like me Beatress’ final phone call prompts you to cry all of the water out of your body) to have the film end with all three women heading off into the sunset, but it would do little for the depth of the world those characters are created in.\n\nWhat are your favourite female-led ensemble cast in horror?
