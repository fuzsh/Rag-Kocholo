        "text": "Tori Spelling and hubby Dean McDermott celebrate the opening of their new bed & breakfast Chateau La Rue on Saturday afternoon in Fallbrook, Calif. The couple are taping for the Oxygen Network’s new reality TV show Tori & Dean: Inn Love.\n\nGotta hand it to Tori’s TV shows for at least having creative twists to them — so NoTORIous and Tori & Dean: INN Love. Bravo!\n\nTori, 33, is expecting a baby boy later this month with Dean, 40.\n\nAlso in attendance at Tori and Dean’s B&B opening were Lisa Rinna and hubby Harry Hamlin, Grant Show and wife Pollyanna McIntosh, and Kelly Rutherford and hubby Daniel Giersch with 4-month-old son Hermes.\n\nLittle tidbits: Rinna, Show, and Rutherford all starred on Aaron Spelling’s Melrose Place (Tori did make guest appearances). Rutherford practices yoga with Lisa Rinna and Desperate Housewives star Marcia Cross.\n\n(Images via Bauer-Griffin)\n\nhttp://justjared.buzznet.com/galler...st&pic=tori-spelling-bed-and-breakfast-06.jpghttp://justjared.buzznet.com/galler...st&pic=tori-spelling-bed-and-breakfast-09.jpg\n\nhttp://justjared.buzznet.com/galler...st&pic=tori-spelling-bed-and-breakfast-10.jpghttp://justjared.buzznet.com/galler...st&pic=tori-spelling-bed-and-breakfast-12.jpg\n\nhttp://justjared.buzznet.com/2007/03/04/tori-spelling-bed-and-breakfast/\n\nIs this \"bizarre\" news or what?\n\nNormally it would be \"fun\" to see a \"Beverly Hills princess\" / former-billionaire-daughter enter -real life with real work- but I feel totally sorry for Tori (after that Yard Sale etc) that she has to work so far-along pregnant and after the loss of her father.\n\nI admire her for doing work she probably never expected to have to do and even going on after the death of her father and that terrible family feud instead of drowning in self-pity.\n\nIt`s amazing what strenght people develop if they have to and I`m glad her man is standing by her side.\n\nAll this -real work- + reality TV must feel \"humiliating\" for her but she swallowed her pride and it`s amazing how she goes on. GO TORI!\n\nThe commercials that I've seen about their show seem really cute I'm excited-- I loved Notorious and I think Tori has a great sense of humor. I agree with Heroin, I do feel bad she was pregnant and left with nothing. I hope the Inn Love show takes off for them though it might be hard considering it's on the Oxygen network (I only watch it for Campus Ladies).\n\nI wonder if they'll only have famous people stay there or if they'll actually have regular people stay at their Inn ?\n\nProblem is Tori doesn't want to work for a living and never really had to until her Dad died and she got cut off. Tori and her new hubby figured they'd be sat at home counting their millions but it didn't work out like that. If she wanted to get a real job she would instead of \"pretending\" to open a B&B to stay on TV.\n\nThis couple have whored out every aspect of their lives together. A week doesn't go by that one of the rags doesn't have some kind of exclusive from them - I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't sell footage from the delivery room for the $$$.\n\nI figure these 2 deserve each other and Dean & Tori's exs had a lucky escape."
