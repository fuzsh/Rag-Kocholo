        "text": "After announcing their engagement last month, Grant Show and “The Campaign” actress Katherine LaNasa have tied the knot!\n\nThe former “Melrose Place” star, 50, and his 45-year-old bride married on Saturday in Los Angeles, according to People.\n\nKatherine wore Prada shoes with a gown by Naeem Khan, while Grant wore a custom suit by Di Stefano Italian Fashion Group, the mag reports.\n\nThe ceremony took place at The Oak Grove at Ribbit Tree & Plant Nursery in Topanga, Calif.\n\nWith the newlyweds’ upcoming filming schedules, it’s no wonder the couple chose to wed just weeks after their engagement.\n\nKatherine, currently starring as Will Ferrell’s wife in “The Campaign,” will soon be seen in upcoming films “The Frozen Ground” and “Jayne Mansfield’s Car,” and on NBC’s new murder mystery series, “Infamous.”\n\nGrant will be seen on the big screen in “The Possession” – a horror film due in theaters on August 31, and is set to begin production on Lifetime’s “Devious Maids” later this year.\n\nThis is Katherine’s third marriage – she was previously married to the late Dennis Hopper from 1989 to 1992, and to “3rd Rock from the Sun’s” French Stewart from 1998 until 2009.\n\nGrant was married to model Pollyanna McIntosh from 2004 to 2010."
