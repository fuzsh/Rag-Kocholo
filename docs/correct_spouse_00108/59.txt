Former Melrose Place star Grant Show is planning a second marriage after proposing to late movie legend Dennis Hopper's ex-wife Katherine Lanasa.

Show asked the former ballet dancer to be his bride last week (begs02Jul12) and handed his now-fiancee a four-carat diamond sapphire ring, according to UsMagazine.com.

The actor has been married once before - to model Pollyanna McIntosh. They divorced last year (11).
