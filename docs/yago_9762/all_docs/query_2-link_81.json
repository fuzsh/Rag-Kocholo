        "text": "Over the years, several dedicated folks have actively been keeping the Lending Library ready for Ranch residents. We use an honor system instead a formal check-out system. All books and DVDs are donated, and periodically re-donated to local thrift shops.\n\nThe library received a facelift in Phase I of the house re-design to an early 1900s period look. We opened up a window by removing some unnecessary shelving, and added a drop-leaf table, with chairs in which to read and relax. The room is looking fabulous with a paint job in a historic green called Cushing Green, retaining the gorgeous wood trim (restored by a team from Hollywood when the movie Love at Large was filmed here).\n\nWe added a section for works by local authors and historic resource materials. A nice selection of gardening books were donated as well. If you enjoy western fiction, weâ€™ve got a pretty good selection including Louis L'Amour and Zane Grey!\n\nThe room is available for rental for small groups, such as book club meetings and luncheons.\n\n*[====|====|====|====|====|====]*\n\nLibrary Hours (free admission)\n\nTuesday 10am - noon\n\nThursday 9am - 11:30 (closing time depends on the dominoes players! )\n\nAll-hours: Drop-box in the back porch for book returns & donations"
