        "text": "Everywhere! The whole Bible displays God’s love and demonstrates how humans love (or neglect to love) God and one another. Here are a few examples of the way the Bible talks about love.\n\nGod instructs the Israelites to treat refugees and immigrants as natives and to love them as they love themselves (Lev. 19:34).\n\nMoses teaches the people God’s command to listen and love God with all their heart, soul, and strength (Deut. 6:4-5).\n\nJonathan dedicates his loyalty to his friend David “because he loved him as himself” (1 Sam. 18:3).\n\nA woman pursues the man she loves, searching but not finding him (Song of Songs 3:2)\n\nFearful leaders hide their faith because they love human admiration (John 12:42-43).\n\nJohn says, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life” (John 3:16).\n\nIn his letter to Corinth, Paul describes how crucial love is to our identity while defining what love is (e.g., patient, kind) and what it’s not (e.g., proud, rude; see 1 Cor. 13).\n\nOnce you learn to look for it, you’ll see that the entire Bible talks about love.\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 13:1-8, Paul describes the nature and activity of real love. He says that even if we do impressive things with great faith, none of it matters if we do not have love. A loving person has learned to be patient, kind, hopeful, and enduring. A loving person turns away from all forms of violence or coercion and refuses to entertain jealous, boastful, arrogant, rude, selfish, or quick-tempered thoughts and behaviors.\n\nJohn says that God is love (1 John 4:16). In other words, it is the essence of who God is. So when we learn to love in the way the Bible describes love, we are learning to live according to God’s character.\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the authors symbolize love through characters in stories, such as the story of Ruth’s faithful relationship to her mother-in-law, Naomi (Ruth 1:14-22). In Song of Songs, the author compares love to a banner (Song of Songs 2:4), representing one’s allegiance and loyalty. And when Moses raises the bronze serpent so that the people can live (Num. 21:6-9), it is a symbol of God’s healing love. Jesus recalls this symbol when he is teaching about his own love for humanity (John 3:14-16).\n\nAnd not only does blood symbolize life and death in the Bible, it also becomes a poignant symbol of love. Losing blood means losing life, and humbly giving one’s life for the well-being of another is the ultimate form of love. We see this most notably in the sacrifice of Jesus. The biblical authors say that Jesus poured out his blood for the good of all humanity (Matt. 26:28; 1 John 1:7)—the ultimate act of love.\n\nThe whole Bible tells the story of God’s love for humanity through these and many other symbols.\n\nThe Apostle Paul describes love in several letters, perhaps most famously in 1 Corinthians. He says even if we do good deeds and have strong spiritual gifts and faith, none of it matters without love. Paul then gives us a practical list to explain what love looks like—what it does and does not do. Love is patient, kind, hopeful, and enduring. Love is not jealous, boastful, arrogant, rude, selfish, or quick-tempered (1 Cor. 13:1-8).\n\nJohn, a disciple of Jesus and an apostle, says that God is love (1 John 4:16). Love characterizes God’s core essence. We see examples of God’s patient, kind, and enduring love throughout the Scriptures, especially in the story of Jesus’ non-violent responses to Roman oppression and religious coercion. Rather than fighting back with the power of force, he humbly offers his own life to bless and heal all humanity (1 John 3:16). Jesus’ selfless and compassionate treatment toward all people (including his enemies) shows us what true love looks like.\n\nThe Bible is a collection of stories that point to God’s ultimate act of love in Jesus. Every biblical narrative can be seen as part of one story that teaches us about God’s love for humanity. However, some story collections are about the human rejection of God’s love. And there are other stories that show people giving their lives and everything they have in order to love God and others well. The biblical authors also capture various kinds of love between friends, relatives, spouses, and even enemies. Here are a few examples of biblical love stories.\n\nIn the face of fear, Jonathan loves his friend David as he loves himself (1 Sam. 18:1).\n\nRuth's love and care for her mother-in-law, Naomi, outweighs that of seven sons (Ruth 4:14-16).\n\nPeople turn away from God to love other gods, an action compared to adultery (e.g., Isaiah, Hosea, Jeremiah, etc.).\n\nWisdom, personified as a woman, pursues people’s hearts and ears. She longs to love those who would listen to her guidance (Prov. 8-9).\n\nJesus’ love for his followers is compared to a bridegroom’s love for his bride (Eph. 5:25-32; Rev. 19:7-16).\n\nJesus teaches us that the ultimate test of real love is how well we treat others, especially those who harm us or cannot offer anything in return. When Jesus is physically assaulted, he does not return violence. When he is maligned, falsely accused, and mistreated in many ways, he does not respond with the same kinds of attitudes or behaviors. Instead, Jesus teaches people to do good toward all, including their opposers. We are to be generous, forgiving, and compassionate without preference. We see Jesus embody this lifestyle as many harm him, yet he never returns harm in any way.\n\nIn the book of Mark, Jesus responds to a question from the scribes about which of God’s commands are the most important of all. He says, “Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength. And you shall love your neighbor as yourself.” Notice how he fused two commands into one: “There is no other commandment greater than these.” (Mark 12:29-31)\n\nLoving our neighbors is important to God, so much so that he describes loving one’s neighbor as one aspect of loving God himself. The two are different parts of the same love. So what does loving our neighbor look like?\n\nIn the Bible, love includes positive affection for others, but it also transcends a person’s emotions to include actions—the way a person cares for the well-being of another. Loving one’s neighbor is about actively caring for the neighbor’s health and well-being in the same way we might care for our own lives. And Jesus takes it a step further, inviting his followers to consider the radical way he has been loving and caring for them, and he tells them to do the same for their neighbors (John 13:34).\n\nTo learn more about what it means to love our neighbors, especially when they happen to be enemies, dive into day 10 of our Youversion reading plan, “A Journey Through Luke & Acts.”\n\nLoving one another is about attitude and action. It means listening to each other, remaining patient, and forgiving each others' faults or weaknesses. It’s about working for the health and well-being of the other, generously caring for the person, and learning to see the inherent beauty and good in one another.\n\nLove is the distinguishing mark of all of Jesus’ followers, and we are able to love in this radical way because of the self-giving love of Jesus. His love empowers his followers to love each other with the same patience, devotion, and fervency he showed to them.\n\nThere are many biblical examples of what it means to love one another. Here are a few."
