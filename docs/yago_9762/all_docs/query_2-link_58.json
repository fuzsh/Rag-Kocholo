        "text": "Opportunity is often described as a favorable or promising combination of circumstances. This certainly describes what is available for anglers in Maryland this time of the year. Hot days and the cooling effects of water with the bonus of catching fish, it’s hard to get better than that.\n\nMiddle Bay\n\nAnglers are enjoying good fishing for white perch and a mix of spot and small croakers on the west side of the Bay Bridge this week in the shallower waters. Peeler crab and pieces of bloodworm are popular baits. There is a limited amount of striped bass fishing during the early morning and late evening hours near the bridge piers. Drifting live spot, eels, soft crab or cut spot towards the pier bases is a popular tactic. Casting soft plastic jigs close to the piers is another method of fishing for striped bass at dawn.\n\nRecently, anglers are finding good shallow water fishing for striped bass, white perch and a mix of red drum and speckled trout during the early morning and late evening hours. The striped bass are being caught on paddletails, poppers, soft plastic jigs and jerkbaits. The white perch are being caught by casting a mix of small spinnerbaits in white or chartreuse, Beetle-Spins and Roadrunner lures along promising looking shorelines. Red drum measuring around 12” or so are being caught by anglers casting for white perch. Slightly larger red drum, slot size red drum and speckled trout are being caught by anglers fishing for striped bass.\n\nThe rocks and shorelines of Poplar Island, Thomas Point, Eastern Bay and the mouth of the Choptank have all been good locations to give casting a try. Anglers fishing in the Poplar Island area may notice fish that are tagged with telemetry tags from an ongoing NOAA study.\n\nAnglers who keep their eyes on the horizon are encountering schools of breaking striped bass out in the main part of the bay on both sides of the bay. Many of these breaking fish tend to be striped bass in the 16” to 18” size range with some measuring over 19”.\n\nSmall croakers seem to be everywhere this summer and those of us who remember the wonderful croaker fishery in the late 90’s, with plentiful catches of 14” and longer croakers hold great anticipation. It is hoped that these small croakers will provide a future fishery equal or greater. Memories of bottom fishing with peeler crab baits close to port on a quiet summer evening is not easily forgotten.\n\nFreshwater Fishing\n\nAnglers at Deep Creek Lake continue to enjoy a typical summer pattern of fishing for most species in the lake. Largemouth and smallmouth bass are a very early morning or late evening adventure with boat traffic playing a major role in fishing success. Quiet coves and isolated shorelines usually offer the best opportunity for fishing grass beds and sunken wood. Fishing under floating docks and moored pontoon boats is the place to look for bass during the day and will often take putting a wacky rigged worm or a tube right in there where they live. Some anglers have really developed a knack for skipping their baits like one skips a flat stone right under the docks. Rocky Gap State Park Reservoir is also a great place to fish and Asher Krampf holds up a large redear sunfish to prove it.\n\nThe upper Potomac is running low this week and many anglers are enjoying the relief of wading while others are carefully fishing from small boats. The early morning and evening hours offer the best fishing opportunities for smallmouth bass. Casting poppers and small white buzzbaits are popular offerings when casting to riffles and current breaks.\n\nThe lower Potomac River water temperatures are still holding in the high 80’s so the largemouth bass tend to be a bit sluggish. The same can be said for most other tidal rivers. Most fishermen are reporting that the last of the ebb tide and the first two hours of flood offer the best fishing. Small 4” soft stickbaits or small crankbaits have been working well near small streams or marsh guts emptying into the river. Spinnerbaits retrieved slowly along grass bed edges can also work, as well as poppers in the grass early in the morning or late in the evening. In most tidal waters Chesapeake Channa will be an exciting part of the mix when fishing topwater lures.\n\nFishing for largemouth bass is always a summertime favorite at the many small ponds and larger reservoirs across the Maryland landscape, this week is not different. In the early morning and evening hours casting a variety of topwater lures in the shallower areas is always a fun and exciting way to fish for largemouth bass. Casting spinnerbaits, lipless crankbaits and soft plastics near the edges of grass and cover in the form of sunken wood and fallen treetops is always a good bet.\n\nSummer is a great time to fish for smaller panfish such as bluegills in lakes and ponds. Small rubber legged poppers on a fly rod can offer some exciting fishing or simply casting small lures with an ultra-light spinning outfit. Bobbers, worms and small children are another opportunity that should also not be missed. Lazy summer evenings are a great time to enjoy some company with a friend or a family member, a few beverages and maybe a sandwich, while watching a fishing rod propped in a forked stick on the river or lakeshore.\n\nAtlantic Ocean and Coastal Bays\n\nThe big news in the Ocean City area this week is of course the White Marlin Open and there have been some notable catches including two large blue marlin, a qualifying white marlin and some large bigeye tuna. Some weather is forecast towards the end of the week so many boats are getting in their allotted days of fishing as soon as possible.\n\nSurf anglers continue to enjoy a nice summer mix of kingfish, spot and croaker in the surf. Those fishing finger mullet or cut mullet are catching bluefish and a red drum now and then. At the inlet when boat traffic is down anglers are catching bluefish and striped bass by casting soft plastic jigs and Got-Cha lures. At night drifting cut bait is a good way to fish for bluefish. Sheepshead are being caught at the South Jetty and inlet bulkheads on sand fleas.\n\nFlounder fishing has been good in the back bay channels this week, but anglers are warned to be careful in the East Channel and Thorofare due to large sportfishing boats here for the White Marlin Open. Channels farther away from the inlet and Sinepuxent Bay can offer calmer conditions. Larger baits of spot, finger mullet and Gulp baits offer better opportunities for larger flounder.\n\nFishing for black sea bass remains very good this week and it is not uncommon for anglers to catch limits of sea bass. At times small mahi mahi (chicken dolphin) and flounder to round out the mix.\n\nThe boats headed out to the canyons this week have done well, with two large blue marlin, some notable bigeye tuna and large dolphin being caught. The large fleet of sportfishing boats fishing in the tournament is always a great way to show us what is out there.\n\n“I love fishing. I can think of no greater pleasure than to sit alone toward the evening by the water and watch a float.” – Anton Cherhov 1896\n\nMaryland Fishing Report is written and compiled by Keith Lockwood, fisheries biologist with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.\n\nClick Before You Cast is written by Tidewater Ecosystem Assessment Director Tom Parham.\n\nA reminder to all Maryland anglers, please participate in DNR’s Volunteer Angler Surveys. This allows citizen scientists to contribute valuable data to the monitoring and management of several important fish species.\n\nThis report is now available on your Amazon Echo device — just ask Alexa to “open Maryland Fishing Report.”"
