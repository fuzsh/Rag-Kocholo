        "text": "DAVIS, Calif. â€“ Entering 2024 UC Davis football can boast a large collection of playmakers on the edge, with a talented and experienced group of wide receivers and tight ends first year head coach Tim Plough has a large arsenal to choose from throughout the season.\n\nAs a group the Aggies return a combined 1,460 receiving yards from the wide receivers and 396 returning receiving yards from the tight ends for a returning total of 1,856 receiving yards racked up by both groups last season.\n\n\"I think the receiver room is going to be quite exciting to watch,\" said assistant coach (wide receivers) Colin Lockett. \"As a wideout group we're going to attack down the field and with head coach Tim Plough at the helm it gives us an easy blueprint to follow.\"\n\nSenior Trent Tompkins is the leading receiver for the Aggies having recorded 430 yards during 2023, scoring two touchdowns for an average of 39.1 yards per game. Tompkins also brings an all-purpose threat, racking up 333 yards on the ground and adding two rushing touchdowns during his junior campaign.\n\nEntering the season, Tompkins was named second team (punt return; all-purpose) and third team (wide receiver) as part of Phil Steele's Big Sky Preseason All-Conference teams.\n\n\"Trent's biggest strength is that he is a complete competitor, and I feel as though that's why he's successful on the football field,\" said Lockett. \"He's a team player and he's willing to do whatever it takes to win.\"\n\nNot to be out done junior Samuel Gbatu Jr., brings 364 receiving yards of his own from the 2023 season, having snagged three receiving touchdowns as well. Chaz Davis, tied with Gbatu Jr. for most receiving touchdowns by an Aggie receiver, finished the year with 341 yards receiving.\n\n\"Sam is a playmaker, who has really good footwork and has the ability to get open,\" added Lockett. \"His strong hands and how savvy he is at the line of scrimmage are some of the better tools that Sam brings everyday.\"\n\nSenior CJ Hutton brings 322 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown from his 2023 season to round out the Aggie leading returning receivers.\n\n\"C.J. an extremely hard worker and he's very mindful of kind of who, and of his own body,\" said Lockett. \"He's a very analytical type of football player so he's going to try and find his edge any which way he can.\"\n\nThe depth in the wide out room is another one of the unit's strengths, with seniors Julian Alessi, Abe Del Real, juniors Laviel Pickett and Fernando Morales and sophomores Zach Jones, Robbie Mascheroni and Malachi Bean-Seay all returning with time spent in the Blue and Gold.\n\nNew faces in the room also make up a deep group, led by graduate transfer Cole Wright (Boise State) the Aggies have added freshmen Stacy Dobbins, Cole Owens and Greer Arthur.\n\nAt the tight end spot, the Aggies are again strong from a depth's perspective.\n\n\"I love this group of tight ends we have, and I think they are dynamic guys that can just get it done,\" said assistant coach (tight ends) Taylor Chapatte. \"The group is extremely selfless\n\nReturning Big Sky Preseason All-Conference honoree (Phil Steele) senior Josh Gale leads the Aggies with a returning conference-high 335 receiving yards and he caught four touchdowns, both Big Sky highs during the 2023 season.\n\nGale was named the 12th-best returning tight end in the nation by HERO Sports and he is the highest nationally ranked returning tight end in the conference as listed by HERO Sports.\n\n\"Josh is an extremely fast, athletic and explosive player,\" said Chapatte. \"He is very difficult for defensives to cover and match up against.\"\n\nJunior Ian Simpson, who suffered an injury that cut his 2023 short, is another Aggie who brings talent, size and game time to the unit. Having made the move over from quarterback, junior Mitchell Dixon brings a unique vision to the position, while senior Winston Williams will look to continue to be a force for the Aggies in the run game.\n\nSophomores Connor Bonesio, Franz Pohlman and Mason Norberg round out the Aggie tight ends, which all look to play a key role in helping open up the passing game for the UC Davis offense.\n\nWhen senior Miles Hastings approaches the line of scrimmage this year and he looks out to the edge on either side, the Aggie quarterback can feel secure knowing he is surrounding by playmakers and difference makers that will look to help ignite the UC Davis offense throughout 2024.\n\n2024 FALL CAMP: UC Davis opens fall camp on July 31 and all practices are open to media and fans. The Aggies will split time between the grass of Bob Biggs Practice Field and the turf of UC Davis Health Stadium. Fans and media can watch the Aggies regardless of which field they are on.\n\nFilming and photography are ALLOWED for all sessions of practice held on BOB BIGGS PRACTICE FIELD (grass-field). Filming and photography are PROHIBITED for all sessions of practice held on the UC DAVIS HEALTH STADIUM turf field.\n\nPlayers and coach Plough will be available to the media in the Bruce Edwards Club Room following each practice. Specific times are listed on the fall camp schedule.\n\nUC Davis opens the season at Cal on Aug. 31, with kick set for 2 p.m. The Aggies open UC Davis Health Stadium on Sept. 7 with a 7 p.m. kickoff against Texas A&M-Commerce.\n\nFans can buy season tickets, group tickets, mini plans, single game tickets and corporate ticket packages, by clicking the links or by calling the Aggie Ticket Office at (530) 752-2471 or by emailing aggietickets@ucdavis.edu.\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\nStacy Dobbins\n\nWR\n\n5' 8\"\n\nFreshman\n\n#5 Julian Alessi\n\nWR\n\n6' 2\"\n\nSenior\n\n#40 Malachi Bean-Seay\n\nWR\n\n5' 11\"\n\nSophomore\n\n#15 Connor Bonesio\n\nTE\n\n6' 6\"\n\nSophomore\n\n#4 Chaz Davis\n\nWR\n\n6' 3\"\n\nSenior\n\n#9 Abe Del Real\n\nWR\n\n6' 3\"\n\nSenior\n\n#11 Mitchell Dixon\n\nTE\n\n6' 4\"\n\nJunior\n\n#81 Josh Gale\n\nTE\n\n6' 4\"\n\nSenior\n\n#7 Miles Hastings\n\nQB\n\n6' 1\"\n\nSenior\n\n#12 Zach Jones\n\nWR\n\n5' 9\"\n\nSophomore"
