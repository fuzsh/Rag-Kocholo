Billed as a show in which âhome cooks compete to transform leftovers into delicious creationsâ, it sounds, at best, like an admirable attempt to inspire viewers to minimize food waste, and at worst, like a harmless but forgettable cooking competition. Instead, it offers something more uncanny, unsettling, and unhinged.\n\nFrom the first notes of royalty-free, upbeat guitar music, the show embraces you like a party host squeezing your hand while staring into your eyes with a panicked smile. You are blinded by the overbearing brightness of the studio set: turquoise polka dots punctuate 10-foot tall set pieces fashioned into cartoon takeout containers, the neon green judgesâ panel glows with an alien sheen, everything is yelling at you. Â\n\nOur judges appear to have been given the sole direction to amplify their personalities in inverse proportion to their celebrity status. If their smiles are big enough and their exclamations loud enough, they canât be ignored: they will become household names. The only judge who knows how to cook is drunk on her own sense of power and expertise, while the other judges appear to be passing a mickey back and forth underneath the table (which may explain the spontaneous songs, open mocking of contestants, and deranged chants of âFRIDGE! FRIDGE! FRIDGE!â).\n\nThough the winner receives $10,000, the true stakes of this competition seem higher. The showâs kitschy comedic energy may try to hide it, but as their sweat beads under the lights, you worry that these home cooksâ ability to turn day-old casserole into restaurant-quality dishes may determine whether or not they leave this studio alive. And what, or who, is in that casserole? The producers laugh maniacally. Send help.\n\nâTago Mago is a performing person with food opinions from Toronto.\n\nSound of Metal (2019)\n\nOn a recent Saturday night, I drew the curtains, turned off the lights, and hid my cellphone. I pretended I was at The Bytowneâan Ottawa indie theatre that opened in 1947 and went out of business last monthâsitting in a stiff, hard-backed chair up in the balcony, instead of the soft green couch that takes up most of my living room. I rented a movie, the first new release I watched since Trolls World Tour went straight to VOD during the first lockdown, when we all thought this would take a month or two, maximum.\n\nThe first scene of Sound of Metal depicts an environment I am well-versed in: a smelly basement punk show with a shy crowd and an aggressive band. Riz Ahmed (hair bleached, shirt off) bangs a building, ferocious beat on the drums as Olivia Cooke (eyebrows bleached, black cropped shirt on) wails into the microphone, rips a heavy chord on her electric guitar, and presses her foot down on a fuzz pedal, hard.\n\nWatching the scene, my heart panged for an experience I thought Iâd grown to loathe; being at an awful show, listening to a band I donât really like, speakers too loud, in a crowd of people Iâve seen around for years yet still didnât know. Iâd wake up the next morning with my ears ringing a long and sustained high note, an involuntary soundtrack that doesnât leave for days.\n\nNormally, Iâd wait outside the theatre for the bus #14 to take the usual late-night ride home; debating what Iâd just seen if I was with a friend, headphones cranked to the max if I was alone. Now, I shut the TV off after the movie and walk only a few feet to my apartmentâs other room before falling into bed. What Iâd give for my ears to ring again.\n\nâAlanna Why is a pop culture and fiction writer from Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nThe Scary of Sixty-First (2021)\n\nRed Scare fans be like (adds Los Angeles Apparel tennis skirt to shopping cart): Iâm so close to figuring out the truth about the pedophilic billionaire class, I know it.\n\nAfter plugging in my European Film Market login details, graciously provided to me by a Parisian film exec with whom I occasionally cam for cash, I eagerly refreshed the Berlinale webpage in anticipation of the premiere of The Scary of Sixty-First. Despite being a world premiere, an occasion traditionally associated with excitement and glamour, Dasha Nekrasovaâs demonic, amphetamine-fueled directorial debut was actually well suited to the depraved COVID release landscape, fitting in nicely with the now abject familiarity of my laptop (and growing Vyvanse dependency).\n\nEngaging with the dialectics of apophenia, Scary captures the obsessive, pattern-seeking logic of the web and personifies it in two young women desperate to uncover the âtruthâ about Jeffrey Epstein and his elite cabal of pedophiles. If this dynamic sounds familiar, youâve probably heard, for better or for worse, an episode or two of Red Scare; the popular podcast (co-hosted by Anna Khachiyan and Nekrasova herself) situated within an emergent class of pseudo-political pundits somewhat embarrassingly known as the âdirtbag leftâ. Strikingly similar tonally (Anna K makes an appearance, along with both R and F slurs), Scary reproduces the intoxicating, boundary-pushing affect of Red Scare, swapping the ambient intimacy of the parasocial for the histrionic unease of the paranormal.\n\nThough reactive, the conspiratorial mode depicted in Scary is not entirely illogical. Paranoid as they are, the characters find both intentionality and purposeful humanism within the otherwise absurd, irrational, and meaningless world of late-capitalism. As finance-backed violence and networked power produce equal parts angst and anesthesia, world-building in this schizophrenic, conspiratorial mode seems not entirely unreasonable, and in some cases (as evidenced in the growing landscape of podcasting) functions as an antidote to the atomization of neoliberal individualism (until, of course, it meets its logical conclusion in ISIS merch). While the Red Scare sign-off is infamously âsee you in hell,â Scary makes it abundantly clear weâre already there.\n\nâNicole Richardson is a sporadic writer and full-time film scholar living in Toronto with her cats Melfi and Carmella.\n\nBabe (1995)\n\nWhat is the little animal in all of us, wanting to be? I canât name it. It doesnât have to be named. It can be referred to, given a pet name, a referential so often necessary for language. But these little animals have their own names; they keep them close, tucked behind ears or in the twitching of whiskers, but if we look close enough, we can see them. But the gap in understanding, in naming the name, is a valley. A valley unfamiliar and still home, its green a green we know, its shapes shapes we know, its sky the same sky that is everywhere. It is not uncanny, no, but it unsettles all the same, the little stories in this valley made up of these little animals, with their own names and voices and rituals. If you, a new and newly named animal, set foot in this space, how would you proceed? It is a question that takes a lifetime to answer. So to justify its existence the little animal in us thinks not of curiosity or community or camaraderie but of work. The little animal can live because there is work, important work, work that is necessary and yet should not be a necessity to its right to live. The little animal walks the fields and sees the sun and the trees and the grass and the river and the sheep and the dogs and the ducks and the hens and the cows and the humans and all the other animals and thinks I. A question punctuates every step into the unknown: what am I, a little animal, doing in this world? All the other little animals in us are asking this question. They are all trying to provide an answer. They work with and against and for each other in the ways only they can offer, but all are watching the same sun set behind the trees and the grass and the river. Â In that way the little animal thinks it is right to live and keep living. The little animal wanted to be and it was. And thatâll do.\n\nâTerrence Abrahams is always a Libra and often a poet.\n\nLove At Large (1990)\n\nAlan Rudolphâs use of colour and camera movement demands the big screenâNew Yorkâs Quad Cinema hosted a retrospective in 2018 that thrilled this viewerâbut his fondness for loners proves spiritually appropriate for at-home viewing after dark. The characters in his noir-besotted Love at Large (1990), a spectacular showcase for the directorâs trademark air of melancholic voyeurism, exist in their own little silos of disappointment and contemplation.\n\nThe assignment given to private-eye hero Harry Dobbsâthe secretive Miss Dolan hires him to tail a man in glasses who appears to have two separate familiesâis just one link in a chain of following, snooping, and pining from afar. The movieâs objects and settings underline this sense of transient spectatorship: binoculars, payphones, used cars, parking garages, motel rooms.\n\nRudolph stations his odd-duck characters in these liminal spaces and observes their unsettled states: Harry canât sleep; Stella Wynkowski, another sleuth, is being hounded by an aggravated ex; Ellen McGraw has eyes for one of her husbandâs farmhands and peers out at him from the kitchen window. Love at Large operates on a wavelength of nocturnal poignancy, with people coming and going at all hours, aching for connection but rarely feeling content. Harry and Stella first form something like a real bond in a domain of utter impermanenceâan early flight during which multiple Bloody Marys are consumed. (At a time when regular bar-going has only recently started making a gradual return, Rudolphâs drinking marathons summon a vicarious pleasure.)\n\nIn an oeuvre full of marvelously contradictory personalities, the burly, gravelly-voiced Harry Dobbs holds his ownâhereâs a detective who doesnât particularly enjoy delivering bad news or prying into peopleâs lives. On breaks from his dirty work, he entertains himself with mock play-by-play for his handheld golf video game. He is a charmed creation andâthis is crucial at the momentâgood company.\n\nââDanny King is a writer and editor based in New York.\n\nSuspiria (2018)\n\nSometimes when I was young and would find stray strands of my hair on the floor, Iâd flinch with disgust. A part of me, apart. Iâd react the same to dust, knowing it was made up of dead skin.\n\nI often forget my skin is alive. Sometimes I scratch it in my sleep and it cracks and bleeds and I wake up and twist my neck like a swan to look back at myself in the mirror and inspect the damage. And then my skin heals and scars and fades all by itself, without me telling it to, because it is alive; I am alive.\n\nSometimes I fold my body in half to look at the hair on my shins and it looks alien. Sometimes I pluck it or wax it or shave it so I can be happy for a little bit as a skinned little thing. And then the hair grows back in shards.\n\nIf you had to choose, would you prefer to jump or crawl out of your skin? Sometimes nothing is scarier than a live body, dripping and hairy.\n\nâSennah Yee is the author of How Do I Look? and My Day With Gong Gong.\n\nDragonslayer (1981)\n\nVermithrax Pejorative is so fucking sick to me. Mouldering, always shedding scales and teeth. She lurches painfully on her wing tips. Her movement was modelled on the skeletal structure of the pterosaur Rhamphorhynchus, a fossil from 145 million years ago. It feels that old. Hundreds of people worked on building and animating dozens of machines, puppets, and robots to make this feeling possible. A new type of stop-motion was invented so the dragon would blur; post-production alone lasted eight months for a crew of 80 people. The effort shrinks everything around it. The landscapes diminish too, pulling wide and craggy. They leave people picking over the surface of the world like needlepoint. If you have a carriage, youâre the king. The dragon feels like a dying god. Â\n\nI canât get over how good this movie looks and how so many genre-defining fantasy films that came after failed to carry some of its strongest visual sensibilities into the digital age. I know computers can still make purple and orange! I know they still have contrast in there! Would it kill someone to rotoscope in some sparks or a cool beam of light? Itâs funny to feel nostalgia for old film stocks and practical effects while watching a sword and sorcery movie. One type of magic has to die so that another kind of power can horn in and take its place. Dragons, magic, or the church: to the king, theyâre just different tools for hoarding power. He comes on his little cart and pretends he killed the dragon, sticks his swords in its flyblown guts and waves. I donât know. Iâm googling photos of dinosaur skeletons.\n\nâPaige Sabourin lives in MontrÃ©al and is always wandering around.\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n\nThere are various greeds. if you turn your back on something you wanted, you donât deserve to call yourself greed. that is why death is as wrong as possible. greed is perpetual mourning. a mirror in every corner of the world, reflecting the land back on itself. the sky faces the land. all things face each other in the perfect clam, brought together. greed the pearl, the magnetic. layers of aragonite and conchiolin secreted to form your body. opaque in the endless sleep of my gut. if my dreams are neither past nor future then i cannot lose you. if my dreams are neither past nor future then i can still find you.\n\nâLily Wang is the author of Saturn Peach.\n\nBest Leftovers Ever!\n\nTrapped in a Food Media Fever Dream\n\nSomething is wrong on the set of Best Leftovers Ever!

(At a time when regular bar-going has only recently started making a gradual return, Rudolphâs drinking marathons summon a vicarious pleasure.)\n\nIn an oeuvre full of marvelously contradictory personalities, the burly, gravelly-voiced Harry Dobbs holds his ownâhereâs a detective who doesnât particularly enjoy delivering bad news or prying into peopleâs lives. On breaks from his dirty work, he entertains himself with mock play-by-play for his handheld golf video game. He is a charmed creation andâthis is crucial at the momentâgood company.\n\nââDanny King is a writer and editor based in New York.\n\nSuspiria (2018)\n\nSometimes when I was young and would find stray strands of my hair on the floor, Iâd flinch with disgust. A part of me, apart. Iâd react the same to dust, knowing it was made up of dead skin.\n\nI often forget my skin is alive. Sometimes I scratch it in my sleep and it cracks and bleeds and I wake up and twist my neck like a swan to look back at myself in the mirror and inspect the damage. And then my skin heals and scars and fades all by itself, without me telling it to, because it is alive; I am alive.\n\nSometimes I fold my body in half to look at the hair on my shins and it looks alien. Sometimes I pluck it or wax it or shave it so I can be happy for a little bit as a skinned little thing. And then the hair grows back in shards.\n\nIf you had to choose, would you prefer to jump or crawl out of your skin? Sometimes nothing is scarier than a live body, dripping and hairy.\n\nâSennah Yee is the author of How Do I Look? and My Day With Gong Gong.\n\nDragonslayer (1981)\n\nVermithrax Pejorative is so fucking sick to me. Mouldering, always shedding scales and teeth. She lurches painfully on her wing tips. Her movement was modelled on the skeletal structure of the pterosaur Rhamphorhynchus, a fossil from 145 million years ago. It feels that old. Hundreds of people worked on building and animating dozens of machines, puppets, and robots to make this feeling possible. A new type of stop-motion was invented so the dragon would blur; post-production alone lasted eight months for a crew of 80 people. The effort shrinks everything around it. The landscapes diminish too, pulling wide and craggy. They leave people picking over the surface of the world like needlepoint. If you have a carriage, youâre the king. The dragon feels like a dying god. Â\n\nI canât get over how good this movie looks and how so many genre-defining fantasy films that came after failed to carry some of its strongest visual sensibilities into the digital age. I know computers can still make purple and orange! I know they still have contrast in there! Would it kill someone to rotoscope in some sparks or a cool beam of light? Itâs funny to feel nostalgia for old film stocks and practical effects while watching a sword and sorcery movie. One type of magic has to die so that another kind of power can horn in and take its place. Dragons, magic, or the church: to the king, theyâre just different tools for hoarding power. He comes on his little cart and pretends he killed the dragon, sticks his swords in its flyblown guts and waves. I donât know. Iâm googling photos of dinosaur skeletons.\n\nâPaige Sabourin lives in MontrÃ©al and is always wandering around."
