The first episode features Barry Norman’s reviews of the following films:\n\nThe Freshman\n\nLove at Large\n\nYoung Guns II\n\nThe Handmaid’s Tale\n\nThere’s a report on the National Film and Television School.\n\nThere’s also a follow-up on a report on disabled access to cinemas.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 30th October 1990 – 22:20\n\nIn the next episode, there are reviews of:\n\nFlatliners\n\nThe Mad Monkey\n\nMy Blue Heaven\n\nThere’s a look ahead to the London Film Festival.

I don’t know why this clip was something I remembered, but it did stick in my mind. Maybe it’s just to set up another coincidence, when I’d meet and marry a girl called Bernadette four years later.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 13th November 1990 – 22:20\n\nIn the next episode we get to hear Barry Norman’s opinions of the following films:\n\nHenry & June\n\nMetropolitan\n\nThe Exorcist III\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\nLinking to yesterday’s tape, Jason Miller in The Exorcist III.\n\nThere’s a look at the importance of film music.
