        "text": "The Dance World Championship will kick off on Friday, April 26, and run through Monday, April 29, 2024. Over the past few years, event producers have experienced All Star growth, enabling them to award an increasing number of Dance Worlds bids. To accommodate the growth and help ensure a magical experience for everyone, it is necessary to expand the event to four days. The extra day will feature the following divisions/rounds:\n\nUSASF Senior Small Jazz - preliminary round for U.S. teams with at-large bids\n\nUSASF Senior Small Pom - preliminary round for U.S. teams with at-large bids\n\nUSASF Senior Small Contemporary Lyrical - preliminary round for U.S. teams with at-large bids\n\nIASF Junior Division - semi-final round for all teams\n\nAdvancement. U.S. teams with at-large bids will compete in prelims on the first day of the competition. A minimum of 50 percent of prelim teams will advance to the semi-final round. Prelim teams advancing to semi-finals will be reverse-seeded and distributed among the partial-paid bid teams within the performance order. The Junior Division will follow the IASF Open Division protocol where the top three teams from each country advance from the semi-finals to the finals. Scores do not carry over from one round to the next.\n\nWe are currently evaluating how the remaining divisions/rounds will flow on Saturday-Monday, as we work to strive for more balanced days allowing dancers, judges and staff more time to regroup and prepare for the upcoming day's competition. Stay tuned and be sure to visit TheDanceWorlds.net to stay up-to-date with the latest event information.\n\nIn 2024, we anticipate celebrating more than 450 dance teams and 6,000 dancers from 25 countries. We hope to see you there!\n\nTHE DANCE WORLDS\n\nApril 26-29, 2024\n\nDisney's Coronado Springs Resort\n\nOrlando, FL\n\nEach year following Worlds, the USASF and IASF evaluate the most recent divisions offered to ensure they remain competitive. With increased international participation and growth in certain genres, The Dance Worlds announces the following division updates.\n\nUSASF SENIOR DIVISIONS\n\nSenior Small Contemporary/Lyrical will conduct a preliminary round for at-large bid recipients\n\nSenior Small Jazz and Senior Small Pom will conduct a preliminary round for at-large bid recipients\n\nIASF OPEN DIVISIONS\n\nThese divisions will split by size:\n\nOpen Open\n\n• Open Open Elite 6-15 members\n\n• Open Open Premier 16-30 members\n\nOpen Jazz\n\n• Open Elite Jazz 6-15 members\n\n• Open Premier Jazz 16-30 members\n\nOpen Pom\n\n• Open Elite Pom 6-15 members\n\n• Open Premier Pom 16-30 members\n\nIASF JUNIOR DIVISION REMINDER\n\nU.S. teams only: The bottom age for Juniors on the USASF age grid DID NOT come up to match the International age grid for the 2023-24 season. If you plan to roster a Junior team to be considered for selection to compete at The Dance Worlds you must meet IASF age grid and division requirements. Go to: IASF AGE GRID AND DIVISIONS.\n\nAll other divisions will remain the same from 2023. Watch for updates to be posted on TheDanceWorlds.net soon.\n\nUSASF knows the All Star community continues to thrive when we can help provide positive and nurturing environments for our athletes in training and in competition. With best practices in place, the All Star community works to actively safeguard our athletes, aiming to help prevent misconduct or abuse. One such practice is the required JDP background checks for adult participants of the USASF. New for the 2023/24 season is JDP’s introduction of Verified Identification (vID) to the background check process. vID is highly accurate, fraud-protected identity verification to better safeguard our athletes and the security of our members’ data. vID uses your phone’s camera to scan your ID and to take a real-time selfie to ensure the member applicant matches the ID. vID is quick and easy. All you need is a valid state-issued photo ID and your phone.\n\nFor more information: usasf.net/background-screening\n\nAdult members with more than one membership category now have the option to merge their various member profiles into one account. For example, a coach who is also an athlete may combine the separate accounts into one; a coach who is also a parent of an athlete may combine their coach and athlete accounts. This will enable the member to maintain just one login with the ability to toggle between the various profiles. Each adult member participating in more than one membership category will receive a notification that multiple profiles have been found and prompted to designate one email address for their login username. Fees for each member type still must be paid separately. Eligibility requirements for each role must be met."
