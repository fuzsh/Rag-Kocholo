        "text": "It’s happening: Netflix has officially ordered a sequel to Happy Gilmore.\n\nThe streamer announced at its upfront presentation to advertisers on Wednesday that it was moving forward with Happy Gilmore 2 with Adam Sandler on board to reprise his role as the titular rage golfer.\n\nThe 1996 comedy stands written by Sandler and Tim Herlihy stands as one of Sandler’s most popular films, telling the store of an ice hockey player who discovers he can channel his anger into winning pro golf tournaments.\n\nNetflix didn’t release any details about the film, such as its story line, writer or director.\n\nSandler previously told the Dan Patrick Show that the film was in development. “Dude, we’ve been talking about a Happy 2 and we’re working on some stuff… But don’t tell anybody.”\n\nDrew Barrymore also teased the announcement on her talk show, telling viewers, “This just in, I have breaking news…. I’ll just say this, from my source, that [Happy Gilmore 2] is in process.”\n\nChristopher McDonald who played the golfer Shooter McGavin the first film, has suggested his character might return in the sequel. “I saw Adam [Sandler] about two weeks ago, and he says to me, ‘McDonald, you’re gonna love this,'” McDonald said during a radio interview. “I said, ‘What? ‘ He says, ‘How about that,’ and he shows me the first draft of Happy Gilmore 2.'”\n\nSandler has a $250 million Netflix deal and the actor-comedian has produced eight titles for the streaming service, ranging from the somewhat notorious Western parody The Ridiculous Six to dramedy Sandy Wexler to his acclaimed stand-up special 100% Fresh (which ended up at 90 percent fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, in case you’re wondering). His most recent was the well reviewed teen comedy You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah which premiered on Netflix last August."
