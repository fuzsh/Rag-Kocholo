        "text": "Page 123 →Chapter 8 Archives, Afterlives, and Acknowledgments\n\nIn 2010, a DVD of Trouble in Mind was released to commemorate the film’s twenty-fifth anniversary. Its promotional trailer unintentionally reveals some of the tensions—indeed, careens—that have consistently marked Rudolph’s career, and Trouble in Mind in particular. One of its first frames announces, in white letters on black background, “The critically acclaimed long lost film” and, after a few brief cuts from the film, “from filmmaker Alan Rudolph.”\n\nThe thing is, Trouble in Mind, Rudolph’s anticlassic neo-noir, was never “lost.” Not only was a videocassette released within a year of the film’s theatrical release, as I have noted, but a laser disc of the film was pressed (not to mention the release of its soundtrack or its novelization.) When DVDs hit the scene in the 1990s, Trouble in Mind, thanks to Rudolph’s personal efforts, enjoyed a small-scale release in that format; even a Blu-ray was pressed. True, by 2010, the film had gone out of print in these formats, but the film print was still available to see in revival and art-house cinemas, and several film festivals had mounted retrospectives of Rudolph’s work. In other words, Trouble in Mind was never a missing film.\n\nPage 124 →Trouble in Mind’s asserted absence from history is nonetheless telling, bestowing a characterizing mark on both the director and his output more generally. On the liner notes to the commemorative DVD, Rudolph even joins in on the game: “This film, like the main character of its story, has been locked away for decades, presumably paying its debt to public taste.” To revisit Trouble in Mind means to observe the interplay of successes and near-misses that characterize Rudolph’s work and that inform the reception of this single film.\n\nThat tension—along with another, that of presence and absence—finds a material corollary in the Makers and Mavericks Archives at the University of Michigan, where Rudolph has deposited his professional papers and related materials. And to a certain extent, those tensions characterize archival collections everywhere. Film, as a mass-produced, now multiplatform phenomenon, seems to have a permanence, a lasting record, that other time-based arts such as dance and theater do not. But it is far from permanent. Film is notorious for fading and decomposing; tapes and discs wear out. Disinterested institutional stewardship is often the culprit—studios are notorious for losing or tossing prints and negatives, failing to provide proper storage or otherwise abandoning them. And preserving materials poses a special challenge for American indies: small, independent production and distribution companies did not always have the means or facilities to store prints and negatives; many were short-lived, and, by the 1990s, with the endless mergers, collapses, and buyouts, films and film records were often left behind. Directors could easily lose access to their own prints and negatives for rerelease Page 125 →or transfers to digital formats. Footage that was edited out by worried studios, such as Rudolph’s original ending for Made in Heaven, are often lost to history. Directors often lose—or, in some cases, are unable to track down—rights to their own work. The same situation faces the many documents associated with filmmaking: business records, casting notes, contracts, shooting schedules, scripts, set photos, press releases, inter alia. In the end, archives are repositories, ghostly ones, for things gone missing as much as they are for things preserved, harboring vanished papers, unrealized projects, and so on. They are vaults for submerged stories as much as records of actual ones.\n\nLike any archival collection, Rudolph’s Makers and Mavericks collection is uneven. It is not very large, consisting of several dozen boxes (Robert Altman’s, by contrast, spans over seven hundred). Its main contents are script drafts of Trouble in Mind, a list of cast and crew contacts, some photographs taken from its production, and copious amounts of magazine and newspaper clippings of reviews and interviews, especially those linked to individual film projects. Going through archival material in Ann Arbor, I found numerous invitations, interviews, and personal notes of gratitude over the course of Rudolph’s filmmaking career. There is even a thank-you from schlock-meister William Castle “for assistance [as assistant director] on Riot,”Page 126 →the Naked Dead—small wonder that Rudolph does not look back on it with deep fondness).\n\nFew pieces of correspondence exist, but those that do speak volumes. A long, handwritten note from Geraldine Chaplin, star of Remember My Name and Welcome to L.A., shows the two were creative kindred spirits. In an undated one, she writes, “I love you and I miss you and I want to work with you again,” reminiscing about their first meeting over “great catered food” on the set of Nashville, chez Altman, and talking about Patty Hearst.Page 127 →whom Rudolph remains close: “He has a particular vision of what he wants,” and within that vision he gives free rein and “is an inclusive collaborator.”4 That Trouble in Mind’s Bujold, Morton, Singer, Carradine, and Kristofferson, producers Block and Pfeiffer, composer Isham, and cinematographer Kurita all appear on the commemorative DVD extras with their fond memories about working with Rudolph on the film shows that the director succeeds.\n\nIn the archives, the fact that Rudolph kept a ticket to the special Directors Guild screening of Trouble in Mind is slightly curious for an artist constantly mocking his own status as an outsider. For not only does the souvenir indicate Rudolph’s engagement with “mainstream” cinematic institutions, but it also shows that he confers respect on them as well. (Other archival documents mention the screening and its importance to the film in its Oscar bid.) That invitation is an unquestionable index of mainstream success that mattered enough to keep, a sign of what Rudolph could transpose in his quip, “Hey, I’m lukewarm in Hollywood!”\n\nThe bulk of the business documents regarding Trouble in Mind are archived with the company papers of Alive Films in Kihei, Hawaii, including box-office reports (largely from foreign sales), advertising campaigns, and several contracts. The extent of those holdings, however, is somewhat restricted, largely owing to the fact that Trouble in Mind was initially green-lit under Island Alive productions and became the property of Alive Films midproduction when Shep Gordon and Carolyn Pfeiffer left the former business to create the latter. Understandably little thus exists documenting the film’s Page 128 →preproduction and actual production (Kristofferson’s contract exists, and it reveals that his payment for the film equaled Rudolph’s and that he, like the director and other key players, arranged to get a percentage of the film’s net profits). No documents definitively pinpoint a moment when the film broke even—if in fact it did. We know that its initial box office didn’t recoup its investment, though it was not as low as twenty-first-century IMDb figures have it—at $20,000—enough to account only for its Academy run, according to Pfeiffer.5 (Over time, Pfeiffer reasonably approximates, Trouble in Mind has made back most, if not all, of its investment.) Since the 2020s, Shout Factory has held worldwide rights to it, along with its DVD and Blu-ray rights. The soundtrack, released in LP and CD formats, remains out of print. As usual, Rudolph is circumspect: “My work seems to lack the success gene and popularity chromosome.”6 As I’ve indicated before, though, the archives, incomplete though they may be, show Rudolph’s remark to be only partially true. Documents from the Toronto and Deauville Film Festivals unambiguously verify the success that Trouble in Mind enjoyed with critics and audiences, and French newspapers, journals, and television guides convey the wide-ranging enthusiasm with which the film was received across much of the country.\n\nAfterlives\n\nAfter Trouble in Mind, Rudolph completed eight other films in the 1980s and 1990s: the ill-fated Made in Heaven, about a romantic pairing that was celestially arranged under the Page 129 →assumption that the pair could find each other before their clock ran out; The Moderns, his dream project set in the Parisian art scene of the 1920s; Love at Large (1990), another neo-noir, less stylized than Trouble in Mind; Mortal Thoughts (1991), a noir mystery starring Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, and Demi Moore; Equinox, in which Matthew Modine plays a set of twins raised under very different circumstances in a fantastical city; Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle, which captures the adventures of Dorothy Parker at the famous Algonquin Round Table; Afterglow, a dramatic film of troubled couples starring a radiant Julie Christie; and Breakfast of Champions, his playful adaptation of the “unadaptable” social satire by Kurt Vonnegut. (With the exception of Made in Heaven and Mortal Thoughts, Rudolph penned all of these.) The familiar casts of these films are further proof that actors enjoy working with Rudolph. Trouble in Mind’s Genevieve Bujold and Keith Carradine both appeared in The Moderns, and Carradine also had a small role in Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle; Lori Singer was in Equinox, Dirk Blocker in Love at Large, and actors of other projects made repeated appearances across the films of this period, such as Bruce Willis, Nick Nolte, Wallace Shawn, Geraldine Chaplin, and Harvey Keitel.\n\nSince these years marked by intense filmmaking activity, Rudolph has been recognized at numerous retrospectives and film festivals. Here the official archival record is spotty, but there have been retrospectives in Italy, Prague, Chicago, New York City, Seattle, and other places, including university campuses (like the University of Michigan) and at independent theaters, what few there are left.\n\nPage 130 →Rudolph’s online presence shows that a new generation of fans has come to appreciate his work in general and Trouble in Mind in particular. If you type “Alan Rudolph” into the search page of IMDb, what comes up first is “Alan Rudolph (I) (Director, Trouble in Mind [1985]).”7 Customer ratings and reviews of the film introduce new angles: “Photoscribe” calls it “a genuine cult sleeper,” a cultural time capsule. After praising Coop’s weird “capturing” of the glam look of the time, another fan comments, “After finding out that jobs are hard to come by . . . Coop soon turns to crime,” adding, “This movie captures the neon world of the late seventies new-wave/punk era near-perfectly and is unique in the fact that it is the ONLY movie to do so! The acting, specifically Carradine, Bujold and Morton, is top-notch, the music, by Mark Isham, is moody, jazzy and noir-perfect and humor abounds throughout. . . . Buy this movie, and I assure you, it will stay in your OWN mind for quite a while.”8\n\nAnother Amazon critic9 offers a description that is more astute than some of the professional critics who first reviewed the film:\n\nThere is a pervasive sense of melancholy that hangs over it like a cloud. The people who live there all have their pasts, but what really drives them is the hope that they will make it and overcome their circumstances. That, I believe, is at the heart of what this movie represents. In many film noirs past, the general thematic tone was one of fate and destiny, and it being out of human control. Here, in a similarly constructed world, we have people trying to wrest control back into their own hands.\n\nPage 131 →All of these popular assessments hit the mark, and many of the comments—“jobs are hard to come by,” “people trying to wrest control back into their own hands”—sound as if they could have been made by the director himself. Another (“Johnny Rocker”) writes:\n\nIt’s a hard movie to follow at times. . . . Yet it’s intriguing and infectious because of it. At its core, it’s about love and redemption—but for who? They all seem like good people in a very bad place, trying to protect themselves from losing themselves, and making painful sacrifices to protect those that need it most. It’s so ambiguous as to time and history. . . . It seems futuristic in one regard, then so retro and squalid in another. . . . by the end, the viewer feels they have lived a strange dream with a happy ending—but whose dream was it? A low end pretentious sci-fi thriller, or a sophisticated high end art house character study?10\n\nOther appreciations have come from critic/filmmaker like Dan Sallitt11 and professor Steve Rybin,12 who have posted lengthy critical appreciations of Rudolph’s career that demonstrate they “get” the director’s fractured “adult fairy tales”—as Vincent Canby put it in his 1985 review of Choose Me.13 These newer voices compensate for some of the gaps and silences encountered in the filmmaker’s history and indeed, in his archive.\n\nThe ongoing and enhanced traces of Trouble in Mind in particular—in two sets of archives, on the DVD interviews, in print and online media—indicate to me, at least, that this film should not be considered “lost to history,” as has either been Page 132 →claimed or inferred. For Trouble in Mind speaks quite forcefully to American political and cultural history of the mid-1980s; it exhibits the stylistic flourishes of film noir and art cinema at their best; and American humor at its most engaging. Rudolph—and Trouble in Mind—deserve a more robust inclusion in the history of American independent cinema, with all the irregularities, gaps, and careens that that history, like his own, cannot elude.\n\nPage 133 →Acknowledgments\n\nIf an archive can never tell a full story, neither can a short book cover the entirety of a film’s life and achievements, much less those of its director and writer. Still, it’s been my aim here to begin to do that, and to bring Trouble in Mind back into the limelight of independent cinema, along with Alan Rudolph, whose unique perspective and contributions to that movement—at its pinnacle in the mid-1980s—far exceed those of a “protégé.” Fortunately, I’ve had the help of a number of others, including several members of Rudolph’s circle. Some of those people, such as the film’s producers, costume designer, and the director himself, have weighed in on the project in concrete ways, transforming what for me could have been a piecemeal stumble through clippings and interviews into a rewardingly concrete, collaborative experience.\n\nFirst and foremost, my appreciation goes to the staff at the University of Michigan Library Special Collections and to my editors at the University of Michigan Press, Sara Cohen, Matthew Solomon, and Phil Hallman. The open-access publication of this book was made possible through the generous support of Joshua A. Bilmes and JABberwocky Literary Agency. I want to thank the two anonymous readers of the manuscript of this book for the press for their useful suggestions and observations. I also want to acknowledge the varied contributions of the following friends, colleagues, and students: Bailey Apollonio, Gabby Dias, Krin Gabbard, Gary Goertz, Genevieve Havemeyer-King, Ungsan Kim, Richard Ness, Markus Nornes, Sarah O’Brien, James Reel, Justin Page 134 →Wyatt, and Feiyang Zhang. I extend my deep gratitude to those involved in the production of Trouble in Mind who took the time to speak with me or otherwise assist this project: David Blocker, Luke Wynne, Mike Kaplan, Tracy Tynan, Shep Gordon and his assistant Kanza Scott, and, especially, Carolyn Pfeiffer, for her help across many interactions about the film’s production and Rudolph’s work more generally. Her contributions have helped this book immeasurably. My deep appreciation and gratitude also go out to Joyce Rudolph, for her help with this project in ways both direct and indirect and for her overall menschlikeit and, last, to Alan Rudolph, for our many interviews, for his humor and support . . . and for making films like Trouble in Mind in the first place."
