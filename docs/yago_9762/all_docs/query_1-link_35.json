        "text": "Anglers Encouraged to Experience Some of the Best Fishing the Great Lakes Have to Offer\n\nNew York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) Interim Commissioner Sean Mahar today highlighted the record-breaking fishing season on New York’s Great Lakes. Lake Erie and Lake Ontario provide year-round excitement for anglers of all experience levels and contribute significantly to local economies.\n\n“The New York State waters of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario provide world-famous recreational fisheries and fishing in 2024 has been exceptional,” Interim Commissioner Mahar said. “Angler reports and DEC data indicate fishing for walleye in Lake Erie and Chinook salmon in Lake Ontario have been outstanding since the beginning of the season. In fact, we may have yet another record-breaking year of fishing on hand, so I encourage all anglers to get on the water and experience the excellent fishing these lakes have to offer.”\n\nEmpire State Development Vice President and Executive Director of Tourism Ross D. Levi said, \"New York State is home to some of America's best fisheries, which welcome countless anglers from around the world every year, and Lakes Erie and Ontario are providing exceptionally strong opportunities this season. Any fishing trip can easily become an extended getaway when coupled with unique lodging, dynamic food and craft beverage experiences, and exciting outdoor recreation opportunities, making it so easy to love New York.\"\n\nLake Erie\n\nIn recent years, Lake Erie’s remarkable walleye fishing has been driven by an unprecedented run of hatching success over the past decade. That trend continued into 2024, with June fishing setting a new record based on DEC’s 37-year angler survey.\n\nIn addition to record-setting walleye fishing, anglers are having success catching smallmouth bass, yellow perch, and tributary steelhead this year. New York stocks nearly 200,000 steelhead into the Lake Erie tributaries each year; the yellow perch and smallmouth bass fisheries are supported entirely by natural reproduction.\n\nCaptain Jim Skoczylas, Vice President of the Southtowns Walleye Association of Western New York, said, “Right now is some of the greatest opportunities on Lake Erie to catch walleye for the novice and expert angler. We have seen a tremendous number of fish being taken over the past several weeks across the lake due to our strong fishery. As of today, there are multiple year classes of fish being taken and the bite has been very consistent. Whether you are bottom bouncing in Buffalo, pulling boards or dipsey divers, or running riggers in open water, there are plenty of walleye to be had. If you are considering going out for walleye, right now is a great time to put quality time on the water.”\n\nCaptain Jim Steel, President of the Eastern Lake Erie Charter Boat Association, said, “Fishing on Lake Erie is truly an amazing experience. The fish population is thriving and keeps getting better every year. Our captains are on the water almost every day and are experiencing fishing we’ll be talking about for years. Now is the time to enjoy a fun-filled day of fishing.”\n\nLake Ontario\n\nSpring and early summer Chinook salmon fishing is historically best in western New York and this year has been one of the best on record. Fishing for Chinook salmon is also exceptional in eastern Lake Ontario with limits of fish being reported all along the shoreline. In addition to Chinook salmon, anglers are also catching strong numbers of Coho salmon, steelhead, brown trout, lake trout, and Atlantic salmon. The salmon and trout fishery in Lake Ontario is supported by a combination of stocking and naturally reproducing fish, and New York stocks Lake Ontario with approximately 2.7 million salmon and trout each year.\n\nOutstanding Chinook salmon fishing in Lake Ontario is an indicator that fall salmon runs in Lake Ontario tributaries will also be great this year. Chinook salmon enter Lake Ontario tributaries to spawn in late September through October. Tributary fishing offers anglers the opportunity to catch trophy-sized fish from shore, with fish returning to tributaries all along the lakeshore.\n\nCaptain Frank Campbell, Tourism Director for Destination Niagara, said, “In over 30 years of chartering and several years as sportfishing promotions director for Niagara County, I have never witnessed Lake Ontario fish so well for king salmon. Not only are the numbers of fish present, but also the size to make Lake Ontario the hottest salmonid fishery in the world. I've heard countless anglers say that even though they heard fishing has been on fire, it far exceeded their expectations.”\n\nJoe Yeager, President of the Lake Ontario Salmon and Trout Association, said, “This year for June through mid-July, Lake Ontario has provided anglers fishing the west end of the lake with the best Chinook salmon fishing ever. The fishery has been amazing for the consistent day-after-day large catches of all year classes of Chinook. The fishing has occurred relatively close to shore providing anglers with smaller boats the opportunity to also enjoy the best Chinook salmon fishing anywhere in the country!”\n\nCaptain Tom Burke of Oswego, said, “The 2024 Lake Ontario king salmon fishing has been incredible. The combination of the salmon stocking program, natural reproduction, and conducive weather patterns leading to a resurgence of the baitfish population has all come together to make this the best king salmon fishing on the planet at this time!”\n\nPremier fishing opportunities on the Great Lakes also support the Governor's “Get Offline, Get Outside” initiative, which promotes physical and mental health by helping encourage New York’s kids and families to put down their phones and computers, take a break from social media, and enjoy recreation and outdoor social gatherings.\n\nFor more information on Lake Erie and Lake Ontario fisheries management, visit DEC’s website.\n\nAspiring anglers interested in fishing Lake Erie or Lake Ontario tributaries are encouraged to venture out and bring friends along for DEC’s free fishing day on Sept. 28. New and experienced anglers alike are encouraged to check out DEC's 'Tackle Box' feature in the HuntFishNY mobile app, which provides anglers one-stop shopping for waterbody-specific information on fishing regulations, stocking, and fishing/boating access sites."
