        "text": "DETROIT LAKES, Minn. (Gray News) – Country singer Carly Pearce kicked someone out of the crowd during her set at a music festival in Minnesota over the weekend.\n\nPearce was performing at the WE Fest Country Music and Camping Festival in Detroit Lakes on Friday when she asked security to kick the man out, saying she felt disrespected by his comments.\n\nFans captured the moment on video.\n\n“Somebody get him out of here. I do not want him at my show,” Pearce said, pointing to a man in the crowd. “Get out of my show.”\n\nShe continued, “If you’re gonna be an a******, then you’re gonna have to say it to me and get the f*** out of my show. I do not have time for d***s. See ya later.”\n\nFans cheered her on as security escorted the man out of the venue.\n\nThough the man’s comment wasn’t captured on video, People reports that the issue started when Pearce told the crowd she “wanted to tell you all a little about me,” and the man allegedly yelled, “No one cares.”\n\nAfter kicking the man out of the crowd, Pearce explained herself further.\n\n“Words hurt. That hurt me. That was not nice. And I’m just here to tell you guys, be kind,” she told the crowd. “Do not say mean things to people just to be mean. Don’t think that there aren’t consequences for it. It is not kind. It is not right. And I do not believe that he should have been at my show if he is going to speak to me like that.”\n\nPearce told the crowd that this was the first time she ever kicked someone out of a show.\n\n“That is the first time I have ever sent somebody out of one of my shows. But if somebody is going to be that mean and disrespect me, you are not welcome,” she said.\n\nThe 34-year-old Grammy winner finished her speech by saying, “Seriously, just be nice to people. Do not be mean. It is not worth it.”"
