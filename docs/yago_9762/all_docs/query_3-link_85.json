        "text": "“Twisters,” a stand-alone sequel to the 1996 blockbuster “Twister,” raises the question, Can sequels recreate the magic of a classic?\n\nDirected by Lee Isaac Chung, the movie follows meteorologist Kate Carter, played by Daisy Edgar-Jones, as she navigates the trauma of losing her significant other while chasing a tornado years earlier. Having grown up in Tornado Alley, Kate can predict when tornadoes are coming.\n\nKate’s old friend Javi, played by Anthony Ramos, shows up years after their shared traumatic experience in their last tornado chase. After he begs her to track tornadoes with him — part of a new project aiming to diffuse tornadoes before they hit large towns and cities — Kate reluctantly agrees. Upon arriving in Oklahoma, Kate discovers that the tornado season has lured a large crowd of tornado chasers. The most insufferable of them is Tyler Owens, played by Glen Powell. Owens travels with his ragtag band of “tornado wranglers,” who fly drones, sell branded T-Shirts and shoot fireworks into tornadoes for their YouTube channel.\n\nThe preserved old-school formula of a disaster action movie feels nostalgic and almost refreshing. Nonetheless, “Twisters” has been modernized to reflect current scientific advancements and social concerns. In the 1996 “Twister,” directed by Jan de Bont, the tornado takes on the form of a mysterious and unruly monster. In “Twisters,” however, modern science has made this so-called monster into a measurable scientific phenomenon, shifting the focus to fighting and taming it. The film not only depicts the scientists striving to control this natural disaster, but it also features the devastating impacts of extreme weather fueled by climate change.\n\n“Twisters” goes even further to explore the dark underbelly of disaster, exposing those who profit from it, including land speculators and social media influencers. The film embraces the challenge of integrating contemporary issues and modern science into a classic disaster narrative and, for the most part, succeeds.\n\nScience and social commentary aside, the majority of us are here for Powell as a midwestern cowboy and the enemies-to-lovers trope between Kate and Tyler. “Twisters” is Powell’s third large movie of the year, following the hit rom-com “Anyone but You” and Netflix’s “Hit Man.” Powell is on everyone’s radar, including mine. I could never pass up on a cheesy romantic comedy featuring Powell, in a love plot between a timid, virtuous girl and an insufferable yet disillusioned and ultimately likable guy.\n\nAs in many of his films, Powell exudes charisma. As Kate is working on the field with Tyler, on the edge of a scientific breakthrough, time seems to slow as the camera pans to Tyler. His gaze softens with admiration — and perhaps love. Though it may be cliche, this scene justifies Powell as a rising actor. Yet, their chemistry and passion seems unreciprocated by Kate. Compared to the magnetic presence of Powell — and Ramos, even in his limited screen time — Edgar-Jones’s character feels lackluster. She doesn’t have much emotion to offer, leaving the audience anticipating Powell’s return to the screen.\n\nDespite the slightly underwhelming romance, this film had its fair share of thrill and suspense. It does a solid job of reviving the classic “Twister” and making it resonate with current issues. “Twisters” was a solid disaster film that provided a compelling blend of romance and action — and a healthy dose of Glen Powell.\n\nRating: ★★★★"
