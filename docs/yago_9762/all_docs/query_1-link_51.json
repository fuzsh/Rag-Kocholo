        "text": "WASHINGTON— A Texas man was sentenced today for the felony charge of assaulting a police officer related to his conduct during the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol. His actions and the actions of others disrupted a joint session of the U.S. Congress convened to ascertain and count the electoral votes related to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBrian Scott Jackson, 48, of Katy, Texas, was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras to 37 months in prison; 36 months of supervised release, including an obligation to serve 60 hours of community service within the first 12 months; and $2,000 restitution. Jackson pleaded guilty on February 28, 2024 to assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers.\n\nAccording to court documents, Jackson traveled from Texas to Washington, D.C., with his brother, co-defendant Adam Lejay Jackson, and a friend to protest Congress' certification of the Electoral College. The three attended the \"'Stop the Steal\" rally on the Ellipse and later made their way to the West Plaza of the Capitol grounds.\n\nBrian Jackson then recorded a video and posted it to his Facebook account. In the video, Adam Jackson appears to be holding a police shield, and Brian Jackson states that, “Adam got a god-damned shield, stole it from the f— ing popo!” The trio then made their way to the Lower West Terrace. On the Lower West Terrace, police had formed a defensive line at the mouth of an archway leading to an entrance to the Capitol building known as the Tunnel. The Tunnel was created by the construction of the Inauguration stage and the site of some of the most violent attacks against law enforcement on January 6th. Rioters at the Tunnel battled police officers for hours as they attempted to storm the Capitol building.\n\nCourt documents say that Adam Jackson rammed the police line with his stolen police riot shield. Seconds later, Brian Jackson threw a long, tan-colored flagpole with an attached American flag like a spear at the officers in the Tunnel.\n\nAfter the events of January 6th, Jackson sent several text messages expressing his pride in regard to having participated in the violence at the Capitol. One message read, \"We love our president and we stood up for America today be proud we did it and f— these hoe ass cops that are traitors we f— ed up that capital up today !!!\"\n\nThe FBI arrested the Jacksons on June 7, 2022, in Texas.\n\nAdam Lejay Jackson was previously sentenced for his role in the events of January 6th.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia and the Department of Justice National Security Division's Counterterrorism Section prosecuted this case. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas provided valuable assistance.\n\nThe FBI's Houston and Washington Field Offices investigated this case. The U.S. Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department provided valuable assistance.\n\nIn the 43 months since Jan. 6, 2021, more than 1,488 individuals have been charged in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, including nearly 550 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement, a felony. The investigation remains ongoing.\n\nAnyone with tips can call 1-800-CALL-FBI (800-225-5324) or visit tips.fbi.gov."
