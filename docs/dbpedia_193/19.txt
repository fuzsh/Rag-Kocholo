Several new foliicolous plant pathogens including Pseudocercospora beilschmiediae, P. coprosmae, P. dianellae, P. libertiae, P oleariae, P pomaderridis, Pseudocercosporella helenii, Ramularia coprosmae and Stenella aucklandica are described from New Zealand, and the new combination Pseudocercospora nogalesii is introduced. Furthermore, some additional cercosporoid leaf spot diseases that are new to New Zealand are recorded. The taxonomy of Cercospora on Limonium spp. is discussed and it is shown that two species are involved, viz., Cercospora apii s.lat. (= C. statices Pesante) and C. insulana (= C. statices Lobik).
