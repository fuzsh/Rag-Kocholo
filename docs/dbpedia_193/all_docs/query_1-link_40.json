        "text": "Profile\n\nThe leaf spot fungus Cercospora apii occurs on celery during prolonged periods of higher temperatures during the summer months. Brown spots appear on the leaves of infested plants, which eventually dry out.\n\nPropagation and transmission\n\nCercospora apii is seed-borne and can persist on infected plant debris incorporated into the soil. Spores are spread by wind, water droplets, field operations, and machinery.\n\nTemperatures between 15 and 30 °C promote the occurrence of Cercospora apii, but the fungus spreads preferentially at temperatures between 22 and 28 °C.\n\nEconomic importance\n\nCercospora apii occasionally occurs on celery, but due to its higher temperature requirements (over longer periods) it has so far only gained economic importance in Austria in warm summers.\n\nPrevention and control\n\nUse of pest-free seed\n\nAdherence to a crop rotation of at least four years\n\nDeep plowing of crop residues\n\nControlled irrigation\n\nIf this fungus becomes more important on celery due to changed weather conditions(Cercospora apii prefers higher humidity and temperatures between 15 and 30 °C), the area of spread, the demands of the pathogen, the infestation intensity and frequency as well as possible modified countermeasures must be surveyed.\n\nYour privacy settings\n\nWe use cookies to adapt the website to your needs and to offer special features to you.
