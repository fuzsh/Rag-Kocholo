        "text": "Scouting your vegetable plants in the greenhouse and field will help you identify potential issues early on. In most cases, the earlier you detect an issue, the more effective the management tactics can be. But what are the differences between a disease and a disorder?\n\nLet’s focus identifying diseases in the greenhouse. There are multiple pathogens that cause damping off in seedlings, including Pythium spp., Phytophthora spp. and Rhizoctonia spp. Damping off is a term that describes when a pathogen infects the roots and parts close to the soil line, delaying growth but ultimately resulting in seedling death.\n\nVegetable transplant diseases will depend on the crop. The table below lists the most important diseases on vegetable transplants in Michigan. Click on the disease name and the link will direct you to a symptom image to help with scouting.\n\nVegetable transplant diseases in Michigan\n\nTomatoes/Peppers\n\nDisease name\n\nBacterial pathogen\n\nBacterial Speck\n\nPs. syringae pv tomato\n\nBacterial Spot\n\nX. campestris pv vesicatoria\n\nBacterial canker\n\nClavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis\n\nDisease name\n\nFungal pathogen\n\nEarly blight\n\nAlternaria solani\n\nGray mold\n\nBotrytis cinerea\n\nLeaf mold\n\nFulvia fulva\n\nDisease name\n\nOomycete pathogen\n\nLate blight\n\nPhytophthora infestans\n\nDisease name\n\nViral pathogen\n\nTobacco mosaic virus (TMV)\n\nTobacco mosaic virus (TMV)\n\nCabbage-cole crops\n\nDisease name\n\nBacterial pathogen\n\nBacterial leaf spot\n\nPs. syringae pv maculicola\n\nBacterial blight\n\nPs. syringae pv alisalensis\n\nBlack rot\n\nX. campestrisi pv campestris\n\nDisease name\n\nFungal pathogen\n\nDamping off and wire stem\n\nThanatephorus cucumeris\n\nAlternaria leaf spot/head rot\n\nAlternaria brassicae\n\nDark leaf spot\n\nAlternaria brassicicola\n\nDisease name\n\nOomycete pathogen\n\nDowny mildew\n\nPeronospora parasitica\n\nDamping off\n\nPhytophthora or Pythium\n\nCelery\n\nDisease name\n\nBacterial pathogen\n\nBacterial leaf spot\n\nPs. syringae pv appi\n\nDisease name\n\nFungal pathogen\n\nEarly blight\n\nCercospora apii\n\nAnthracnose\n\nColletotrichum acutatum\n\nDisease name\n\nOomycete pathogen\n\nDamping off, root rot\n\nPythium spp.\n\nPreventative management tactics are the best approach to manage diseases. Planting pathogen-free seed and managing irrigation will keep fungal and bacterial diseases to a minimum for vegetable transplants.\n\nTo eradicate seed-borne bacterial pathogens, use hot water and chlorine treatments on vegetable seeds. “Hot Water and Chlorine Treatment of Vegetable Seeds to Eradicate Bacterial Plant Pathogens” and “Hot Water Treatment of Vegetable Seeds to Eradicate Bacterial Plant Pathogens in Organic Production Systems” by Ohio State University’s Sally Miller will provide the steps necessary to treat seed properly for conventional and organic production systems. Treatment is a function of time and chlorine concentration. Care must be taken to avoid seed damage. It would be best to practice on small seed lots and understand the procedure before moving into larger batches.\n\nEarly morning irrigation and increased airflow will minimize leaf wetness conducive to disease development on high-density plug trays. Once transplanted in the field, avoid overwatering vegetable seedlings.\n\nIf symptoms arise in the greenhouse or the field, make sure you consider the fertility program and have learned to recognize disorders on vegetable transplants in the greenhouse. If you have additional questions, find an MSU Extension expert or collect and send samples to MSU Diagnostic Services. Remember, correct diagnosis is the first step to effective disease management.\n\nLearn more about IPM basics, scouting guides and more at the Online Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Academy. Among the webinars Michigan State University Extension is offering at the Online IPM Academy website, the webinar titled “What is wrong with my vegetable plants?” discusses the differences between vegetable diseases and disorders. Accommodations for persons with disabilities may be requested by contacting Erin Lizotte with MSU Extension at taylo548@msu.edu to make arrangements. Requests will be fulfilled when possible.\n\nFor Part 1 of this series, see “Disease or disorder: How do I tell the difference? Part 1.”\n\nAdditional resources"
