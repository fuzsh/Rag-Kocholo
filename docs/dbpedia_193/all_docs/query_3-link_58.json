        "text": "A pathogen usually appears when the right set of circumstances is present, conducive to the infection of a given plant. Three main factors contribute in the emergence and development of diseases in plants, commonly referred as the Disease Triangle: presence of a pathogen, presence of a suitable host, presence of environmental conditions that favor disease development and maintain the interaction between the pathogen and its host. Some pathogens are more specific as to their requirements to develop, their ability to infect (more prevalent with vulnerable plants and whitin disturbed/unbalanced ecosystems), and are limited to certain habitats and regions.\n\nTo reduce the emergence and propagation of such seed borne pathogens and diseases is of the utmost importance. Specific procedures and precautions must be taken at each step of seed production processing. Garden tools and processing equipment must be thoroughly checked and cleaned between each use, especially if they are suspected of carrying seed borne pathogens. This will also limit potential/accidental mixing when cleaning seeds as well as disease propagation. Similar precautions are to be observed whenever seeds are stored, ensuring adequate labeling (inside and outside each container). In the event of seed falling on the floor prior to their storing or while taking them from storage, they should not be picked up and replaced in the container. Seeds from certain species such as the Brassicas are indeed known to share a very similar appearance and can be easily mistaken, and therefore significantly increasing the risk of seed mixing.\n\nSpecific treatments and techniques aiming to kill bacterial disease-causing organisms on or within seeds are discussed under the Storing section in Module V.\n\nSeed Borne Microorganisms of Common Vegetable Crops\n\nDisease Severity Classes\n\n1 – Severe: Seed borne pathogens that represent the greatest risk, resulting in often highly destructive diseases for a number of crops. Infected seeds are usually the primary source of inoculum for these pathogens. If seed infection is controlled, then the disease is typically controlled.\n\n2 – Intermediate: Seed borne pathogens that represent a significant risk to subsequent crops. While infected seeds may not always be the primary source of inoculum for disease outbreak, there are many cases in which seeds infected with these pathogens can lead to severe outbreaks when planted under environmental conditions that favor the growth and spread of a particular disease.\n\n3 – Minor: Important crop pathogens that can be transmitted via seeds, but infected seeds are not usually the primary source of inoculum for subsequent outbreaks of disease.\n\nAlliaceae\n\nScroll horizontally over the table to view it in its entirety\n\nAmaranthaceae\n\nScroll horizontally over the table to view it in its entirety\n\nApiaceae\n\nScroll horizontally over the table to view it in its entirety\n\nAsteraceae\n\nScroll horizontally over the table to view it in its entirety\n\nBrassicaceae\n\n*20 min. for broccoli, cauliflower, kale, collards, kohlrabi, rutabaga, turnip; 25 min. for Brussels sprouts and cabbage.\n\nScroll horizontally over the table to view it in its entirety\n\nCurcurbitaceae\n\nScroll horizontally over the table to view it in its entirety\n\nFabaceae\n\nScroll horizontally over the table to view it in its entirety\n\nPoaceae\n\nScroll horizontally over the table to view it in its entirety\n\nSolanaceae\n\nScroll horizontally over the table to view it in its entirety\n\nCredit (seed borne microorganisms list): Chelsea Green Publishing"
