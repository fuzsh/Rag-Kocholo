        "meta_description": "Cercosporoid fungi (former Cercospora s. lat.) represent one of the largest groups of hyphomycetes belonging to the Mycosphaerellaceae (Ascomycota). They include asexual morphs, asexual holomorphs or species with mycosphaerella-like sexual morphs. Most of them are leaf-spotting plant pathogens with special phytopathological relevance. The only monograph of Cercospora s. lat., published by Chupp (1954), is badly in need of revision. However, the treatment of this huge group of fungi can only be accomplished stepwise on the basis of treatments of cercosporoid fungi on particular host plant families. The present first part of this series comprises an introduction, a survey on currently recognised cercosporoid genera, a key to the genera concerned, a discussion of taxonomically relevant characters, and descriptions and illustrations of cercosporoid species on other fungi (mycophylic taxa), Pteridophyta and Gymnospermae, arranged in alphabetical order under the particular cercosporoid genera, which are supplemented by keys to the species concerned. The following taxonomic novelties are introduced: Passalora austroplenckiae comb. nov., P. backmanii comb. nov, P. condensata comb. nov, P. gymnocladi comb. nov, P. thalictri comb. nov, Pseudocercospora davalliicola sp. nov, P. chamaecyparidis comb. nov, P. cratevicola nom. nov, P. gleicheniae comb. nov, P. lygodiicola sp. nov, P. lygodiigena nom. nov, P. nephrolepidigena sp. nov, P. paraexosporioides sp. nov, P. pini-densiflorae var. montantiana comb. et stat. nov, P. pteridigena sp. nov., P. ptisanae sp. nov, P. sciadopityos sp. nov, P. subramanianii nom. nov, P. thujina comb. nov, and Zasmidium australiense comb. nov.",

        "text": "The genus Pseudocercospora was introduced by Spegazzini (1910) in order to accommodate Septonema vitis (Cercospora vitis). This genus name was little used until Deighton (1976) reintroduced it in the course of his splitting of Cercospora s. lat. into smaller generic units. He used Pseudocercospora for cercosporoid hyphomycetes with unthickened “conidial scars” (i.e. conidiogenous loci), widened its circumscription and added a large number of species. Unthickened conidiogenous loci are characterised by having locus walls not thicker than the walls of the surrounding conidiogenous cells. Such loci are often inconspicuous, but may be more rigid and conspicuous in other species by being more or less denticle-like. The unthickened nature of the conidiogenous loci is, indeed, the fundamental character of Pseudocercospora, although in almost all species of this genus the loci are in addition not darkened-refractive, i.e. not darker than the surrounding wall of the conidiogenous cells (the darker pigmentation of conidiogenous loci, which is diagnostic for species of other cercosporoid genera like Cercospora, Passalora and Zasmidium, is generally caused by a combination of darker pigmentation and sometimes structural differences that may cause altered refraction of the light). The basic importance of unthickened conidiogenous loci as generic character for Pseudocercospora is supported by several “abnormal” species with more conspicuous loci which are unthickened but darker by being somewhat refractive or even slightly darkened (Crous & Braun 2003). Nevertheless such species belong in Pseudocercospora, which has been confirmed in several studies based on molecular sequence analyses (e.g., Crous et al. 2001, 2012).\n\nAnother problem concerns conidial formation. In almost all Pseudocercospora species, the conidia are consistently formed singly, but conidial catenation may occasionally occur, e.g. in Pseucocercospora nyctanthis, P. millettiae and P. noveboracensis (Hsieh & Goh 1990, Braun 1995a, Braun & Mel’nik 1997, Crous & Braun 2003, Crous et al. 2013). Some other pseudocercospora-like species, characterised by subconspicuous conidiogenous loci (unthickened or almost so, but somewhat refractive or darkened-refractive) giving rise to short conidial chains or disarticulating conidia, were considered to be intermediate between Passalora and Pseudocercospora and assigned to the new genus Pseudophaeoramularia (Braun & Mel’nik 1997). However, the phylogenetic position of species with Pseudophaeoramularia morphology within the Pseudocercospora (s. str.) clade revealed that catenate conidia and somewhat darkened-refractive loci and hila are acceptable variation within Pseudocercospora.\n\nPrathigada is another example for a misinterpreted and confused genus. Due to at least partly conspicuous conidiogenous loci, it has previously been interpreted as close to Passalora, but distinct by having obclavate, relatively thick-walled, often apically rostrate conidia. Beside type material, a collection on Crateva formosensis, collected in Japan, has been examined and compared. The Japanese material agrees perfectly with the type material. The conidia do not exceed 50 µm in length and three septa in both specimens. Results of molecular sequence analyses based on the Japanese material (C. Nakashima, unpubl. data) showed that Prathigada crataevae, the type species of Prathigada, clusters within the Pseudocercospora s. str. clade near to P. fjiensis, i.e. Prathigada has to be reduced to synonym with Pseudocercospora. The molecular data are supported by morphological characters of P. crataevae. The conidiogenous loci and conidial hila are somewhat intermediate between the Passalora and Pseudocercospora type by ranging from inconspicuous to conspicuous by being denticle- or peg-like or by being somewhat refractive to slightly darkened-refractive, but on the other hand they are always unthickened and thus not in conflict with the current concept of Pseudocercospora s. str. (Crous et al. 2013). Unthickened conidiogenous loci which are more conspicuous by being somewhat darkened-refractive are known in other proven Pseudocercospora species, e.g. in Pseudophaeoramularia, which has been reduced to synonymy with the latter genus (Crous et al. 2013). Due to the discussed results, Prathigada crataevae has to be reallocated to Pseudocercospora. The following redescription is based on the re-examination of type material and an additional Japanese sample:\n\nPseudocercospora cratevicola C. Nakash. & U.

Nakashima (CNS 797 and HAL 2597 F).\n\nNotes: Subramanian (1953) introduced Micaraea for Napicladium cratevae as type species and added the new species M. punjabensis distinguished from the latter species by having longer conidia, about 30–70 µm, with mostly 3–6 septa. Later he assigned the two species to Prathigada introduced as replacement name since Micaraea proved to be a younger homonym. The source for the description and illustration of Prathigada cratevae in Ellis (1971) is unclear, but undoubtedly covers P. cratevae as well as P. punjabensis, although the latter name is not cited as synonym. The re-examination of type material of Napicladium cratevae (S, F42112) showed that this collection perfectly coincides with Subramanian’s (1953) description and illustration. Mature, fully developed conidia do not exceed a length of 50 µm and are consistently 0–3-septate, and the examined and sequenced Japanese collection on Crateva formosensis agrees completely. Therefore, we prefer to maintain Macraea punjabensis (Prathigada punjabensis) as separate, easily distinguishable species and transfer it to Pseudocercospora as well:\n\nPseudocercospora subramanianii U.

Madras Univ., B, 26: 367 (1956).\n\nNotes: It is not surprising that the structure of the conidiogenous loci of Prathigada was previously misinterpreted and confused with scars of genera with thickened and darkened loci. Due to at least partly conspicuous conidiogenous loci, Prathigada has previously been interpreted as a genus close to Passalora, but distinct by having obclavate, relatively thick-walled, often apically rostrate conidia (Braun 1995a, Crous & Braun 2003). As discussed above, the loci may be visible by being more rigid and somewhat darkened-refractive, but they are always unthickened, i.e. they fall into the morphological range of Pseudocercospora. Due to the discussed confusion, additional prathigada-like cercosporoid hyphomycetes have been assigned to Prathigada, including several species with true passalora-like conidiogenous loci, i.e. with conspicuously thickened and darkened scars, which cannot be reallocated to Pseudocercospora. They belong in Passalora in its current circumscription. The latter genus is, as far as known, not monophyletic, but a comprehensive phylogenetic revision is not yet available. Hence, the species concerned can currently only be assigned to Passalora s. lat.:\n\nPassalora austroplenckiae (A. Hernández-Gutierrez & Dianese) U.

Komarova 20: 97 (1997).\n\nNotes: Other species assigned to Prathigada do not agree with Passalora, belong elsewhere or they are doubtful and unclear. The status of Prathigada bauhiniae (Rao et al. 1975) is unclear. Stenellopsis shoreae was reallocated to Prathigada by Kamal (2010), but due to unthickened hila it is possible that this species belongs to Pseudocercospora. Prathigada tamarindi (Muthappa 1968) is a doubtful species characterised by its unusual conidia which are about 20–30 × 8.5–11 µm and 1–2-septate. A re-examination of type material or examinations of new collections are necessary to reassess this species. Prathigada terminaliae (Sutton 1994) is better considered a species of Pseudocercospora (P. terminaliae). Prathigada terminaliae-bellericae (Kamal 2010) is tentatively reduced to synonymy with P. terminaliae. The significance of differences in the length of conidiophores and conidia between P. terminaliae and P. terminaliae-bellericae is unclear and doubtful as the values for these structures of the latter species are intermediate between P. terminaliae and P. kenemensis, which has been reduced to synonym with the former species as well (Crous & Braun 2003). Prathigada ziziphi (Rao & Ramakrishnan 1965) is tentatively reduced to synonymy with Pseudocercospora jujubae. Type material was not available, but the shape and size of the conidia agree well.\n\nThere are several other morphological characteristics which were proposed for a further splitting of Pseudocercospora into smaller generic units, but all of them failed due to a morphological continuum between the particular morphological types and numerous intermediate taxa. Furthermore, there is no molecular (phylogenetic) evidence for and support of genera to be segregated based on morphology (Crous et al. 2000, 2001, 2013). Braun (1998) tried to use morphological characters for a separation of Pseudocercospora into morphological, non-phylogenetic sections, which are, however, little useful. Pallidocercospora (Crous et al. 2013), recently introduced for the “Mycosphaerella heimii” complex (Crous et al. 2004a), is a segregation from Pseudocercospora mainly based on its distinct phylogenetic position and culture characteristics (formation of red crystals on MEA, PDA, SNA and WA), whereas the morphology of the asexual and sexual morphs is pseudocercospora- and mycosphaerella-like, respectively.\n\nCercoseptoria was recognised and reintroduced in Deighton (1976) for pseudocercosporoid species with acicular conidia. Most of the species assigned to Cercoseptoria are distinctly sporodochial. Deighton (1987) and Braun (1988) questioned Cercoseptoria as properly distinguished genus and reduced it to synonymy with Pseudocercospora. Absence or presence of stromata and conidial shape are too variable in Pseudocercospora to be used for the discrimination of smaller units on generic rank. Braun’s (1993) introduction of Cercostigmina for pseudocercospora-like former Stigmina species (conidiophores and conidia thin-walled, conidia scolecosporous) with consistently percurrently proliferating conidiogenous cells, partly associated with mycosphaerella-like sexual morphs, is another example. Sympodial and percurrent proliferations of conidiogenous cells are often mixed in particular Pseudocercospora species, and species with consistently percurrent proliferation cluster within the big Pseudocercospora clade as well (Crous et al. 2001, 2013; Taylor et al. 2003).\n\nThe conidiogenous loci of Phaeoisariopsis griseola, type species of Phaeoisariopsis, were previously considered to be passalora-like, i.e. slightly thickened and darkened. However, the loci in P. griseola range from being quite inconspicuous (neither thickened nor darkened), as exhibited in the type material of Pseudocercospora columnaris (Cercospora columnaris), one of the synonyms of P. griseola, to subconspicuous (i.e. non-protuberant, lying flat around the conidiogenous cells, unthickened, but slightly darkened-refractive). Deighton (1990) maintained Phaeoisariopsis as separate genus, but confined it to a few species with scars similar to those of its type species, P. griseola. He reallocated synnematous species with inconspicuous conidiogenous loci to Pseudocercospora and those with distinctly sympodial conidiogenous cells and conspicuously thickened and darkened loci to Passalora, whereas Braun (1992) considered Phaeoisariopsis a synnematous counterpart of Passalora. However, the locus type of Phaeoisariopsis griseola, type species of Phaeoisariopsis, falls within the range of loci in Pseudocercospora, which has been proven by means of results of molecular sequence analyses (Crous et al. 2006). These comprehensive examinations of angular leaf spot of bean (P. griseola) showed that this species clusters within the Pseudocercospora clade and revealed that the formation of synnematous conidiomata does not play any taxonomic role on generic level within the Pseudocercospora complex (Crous et al. 2006, 2013). Hence, this species was reallocated to the latter genus and Phaeoisariopsis was reduced to synonym with Pseudocercospora, which was proposed to be conserved as the former genus name is older (Braun & Crous 2006), i.e. former Phaeoisariopsis species with subconspicuous, P. griseola-like scars as well as inconspicuous loci are now part of Pseudocercospora and those with conspicuously thickened loci belong to Passalora. Furthermore, Crous et al. (2006) demonstrated the unexpected phylogenetic position of Stigmina platani, type species of Stigmina, within the Pseudocercospora clade. Although older than Pseudocercospora, the latter genus name was conserved over that of Stigmina (Braun & Crous 2006).\n\nParacercospora (Deighton 1979), with P. egenula as type species, was introduced for former pseudocercosporoid hyphomycetes characterised by having a special type of conidiogenous loci, viz. the scars are only visible by a ringlike structure formed by a slightly thickened and darkened rim. P. fijiensis was originally assigned to Pseudocercospora, a position later confirmed in molecular sequence analyses (Crous et al. 2000, 2001, Stewart et al. 1999, Arzanlou et al. 2008). Therefore, Crous & Braun (2003) reduced Paracercospora to synonymy with Pseudocercospora, but the situation is more complicated as P. fijiensis is, indeed, a species of the latter genus, but P. egenula, the type species of Paracercospora, does not cluster within the Pseudocercospora clade and is tentatively maintained as separate genus (Crous et al. 2013). The problem is that the scar structure (Paracercospora type) is not informative and distinctive in this case, i.e. Paracercospora is confined to its type species and only phylogenetically distinguished from Pseudocercospora. Phaeocercospora (Crous et al. 2013) is another pseudocercospora-like genus just based on its separate phylogenetic position.\n\nBased on detailed multilocal phylogenetic examinations, Crous et al. (2013) revealed a large monophyletic Pseudocercospora (s. str.) clade, including the type species of this genus, representing Pseudocercospora emend., which is now a holomorph genus in its own right. Beside species of the “Mycosphaerella heimii” complex, forming a separate clade that is now treated as Pallidocercospora, and Phaeocercospora, there are some additional species morphologically indistinguishable from Pseudocercospora which cluster, however, apart from Pseudocercospora (s. str.) in other clades. Such phylogenetically unresolved species, as for instance P. colombiensis on Eucalyptus (Crous 1998), P. thailandica on Acacia (Crous et al. 2004b), and P. tibouchinigena on Tibuchina (Crous et al. 2013), are tentatively retained in Pseudocercospora.

(2011), Seifert et al. (2011: 95).\n\nDescription: Usually foliicolous, leaf-spotting hyphomycetes, Mycosphaerellaceae. Mycelium in vivo internal; hyphae branched, septate, colourless to pigmented, thin-walled, smooth or almost so. Stromata usually well-developed, substomatal to intraepidermal, often somewhat erumpent, pigmented. Conidiophores macronematous, usually densely fasciculate, forming sporodochial conidiomata, continuous to septate, pigmented, wall thin to slightly thickened, smooth or almost so; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal or conidiophores reduced to conidiogenous cells, usually polyblastic, sympodial, but mostly not strongly geniculate, conidiogenous loci conspicuous, thickened and darkened. Conidia solitary, amero- to phragmosporous (non-scolecosporous), mostly ellipsoid-ovoid, obovoid, fusiform to short cylindrical or obclavate, mostly with 0–3 eusepta, sometimes with a single or several oblique or longitudinal septa, pigmented, distinctly verruculose to coarsely verrucose, basal hilum thickened and darkened, conidial secession schizolytic.\n\nNotes: Asperisporium is morphologically very close to Passalora, as already emphasized by Crous & Braun (2003), except for verrucose conidia. The phylogenetic position of A. caricae, its type species, has recently been elucidated in Minnis et al. (2011), based on DNA sequences from the ITS region and nLSU, showing that this species clusters within the Mycosphaerellaceae clade close to several Passalora species, including P. brachycarpa. According to this result, Asperisporium is undoubtedly a potential synonym of Passalora. However, as Passalora is still para- or even polyphyletic and the phylogenetic position of its type species is still unknown, a formal reassessment of Asperisporium was postponed by Minnis et al. (2011) until the whole Passalora complex will be phylogenetically examined and reassessed in detail. However, the postponed reassessment of the genus name Asperisporium does only concern its type species. Other species assigned to Asperisporum have to be individually reassessed, if possible based on molecular sequence data. Asperisporium sequoiae and A. juniperinum, two species on Gymnosperms with relatively delicately rough-walled conidia, are typical examples. Sequences of the two species are rather similar, cluster with other species of Passalora s. lat., but they are only distantly related to the type species of Asperisporium (Solheim 2013). Therefore, these species are better assigned to the polyphyletic Passalora in its current circumscription. Comprehensive phylogenetic examinations of the whole complex of asperisporium- and passalora-like hyphomycetes are necessary to reach a better more natural genus concept in this group of cercosporoid hyphomycetes. The surface sculpture of the conidia as character for the discrimination of Asperisporium from Passalora is undoubtedly unreliable, at least species with delicately verruculose conidia may belong to Passalora, which is supported by phylogenetic data.\n\nCladosporiella Deighton, Mycol.

The hyperparasitic habit as single character is barely acceptable and usable to discriminate this genus from Passalora, but since the phylogenetic position of Cladosporiella and its relation to the Mycosphaerellaceae are still unclear and unproven, we tentatively prefer to maintain it as separate genus.\n\nDenticularia Deighton, Trans. Brit. Mycol. Soc. 59: 421 (1972).\n\nType species: Denticularia modesta (Syd.) Deighton 1972.\n\nLiterature: Ellis (1976: 182–183), Braun (1995a: 42), Crous & Braun (2003: 23), Seifert et al. (2011: 176).\n\nNotes: Morphologically close to Pseudocercospora (leaf spotting hyphomycetes with unthickened, not darkened conidiogenous loci and hila), but the conidiogenous loci are distinctly denticle-like, and the catenate conidia are non-scolecosporous, only with 0–1(−3) septa.\n\nCultures of the type species of this genus and results of molecular sequence analyses are necessary to resolve its phylogenetic position and clarify its relation to Pseudocercospora. It is still unclear and unproven if this genus belongs in the Mycosphaerellaceae. Therefore, Denticularia is tentatively retained as genus on its own.\n\nElletevera Deighton, Mycol. Pap. 118: 17 (1969).\n\nType species: Elletevera parasitica (Ellis & Everh.) Deighton 1969.\n\nLiterature: Braun (1995a: 37), Crous & Braun (2003: 17), Seifert et al. (2011: 193).\n\nDescription: Fungicolous, hyperparasitic dematiaceous hyphomycetes. Mycelium immersed; hyphae hyaline to faintly pigmented; stromata lacking; conidiophores macronematous, erect, laxly fasciculate, frequently branched, septate, faintly pigmented, thin-walled, smooth; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal or formed as lateral branchlets, conidiogenous loci neither thickened nor darkened, but distinct by being denticle-like and somewhat refractive; conidia solitary, rarely catenate, phragmo- to scolecosporous, pigmented, with slightly refractive basal hilum.\n\nNotes: This genus was introduced for hyperparasitic cercosporoid hyphomycetes with “distinct” conidiogenous loci, morphologically resembling species of the former genus Mycovellosiella. However, the re-examination of several collections of the type species of Elletevera showed that Deighton’s (1969) original description of the conidiogenous loci (scars) is misleading (Crous & Braun 2003). Due to denticle-like loci with unthickened, not darkened walls, Elletevera is possibly related to Pseudocercospora or perhaps not cercosporoid at all. But this question cannot be answered without knowledge of the phylogenetic affinity of this genus, which is still unproven and unclear. The hyperparasitic habit alone is insufficent to uphold Elletevera as separate genus, but until its phyologenetic position is proven the latter genus is tentatively maintained.\n\nEriocercospora Deighton, Mycol. Pap. 118: 5 (1969). Type species: Eriocercospora balladynae (Hansf.) Deighton 1969.\n\nLiterature: Ellis (1971: 248–249), Rao et al. (1982: 1155), Braun (1995a: 39), Seifert et al. (2011: 199).\n\nDescription: Fungicolous, hyperparasitic dematiaceous hyphomycetes. Mycelium superficial; hyphae branched, septate, pigmented, thin-walled, smooth. Stromata lacking. Conidiophores macronematous, mononematous, solitary, in vivo arising from superficial hyphae, lateral, erect, usually unbranched, continuous to septate, pigmented, thin-walled, smooth; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal and intercalary, sympodially proliferating, but usually not distinctly geniculate, conidiogenous loci subconspicuous, i.e. unthickened, not or barely protuberant, not or only slightly darkened-refractive. Conidia solitary, scolecosporous, transversely euseptate, pigmented, thin-walled, smooth or almost so, hila unthickened, not or barely darkened-refractive.\n\nNotes: Crous & Braun (2003) re-examined type material and numerous other collections of E. balladynae and found that Deighton’s (1969) original description of the conidiogenous loci (scars), which were compared with those of the former genus Mycovellosiella, are misleading. The loci are neither thickened nor conspicuously darkened (at most they are only slightly darkened-refractive), i.e. they are rather Pseudocercospora-like. In E. olivacea, another hyperparasitic species, the loci and hila are quite unthickened and also not darkened-refractive. Eriocercospora websteri and E. moghaniae are two excluded plant pathogenic species that were reallocated to Pseudocercospora (Braun 2002, Crous & Braun 2003). Eriocercospora is possibly a synonym of Pseudocercospora, but without proof based on molecular DNA sequence analyses a final decision has to be postponed. Stenospora (type species: Stenospora uredinicola, Deighton 1969) is very close to Eriocercospora but mucedinaceous (colourless).\n\nEriocercosporella R. Kumar, A.N. Rai & Kamal ex U. Braun, Monogr.

Rai & Kamal, Indian Phytopathol. 47: 127 (1994), nom. inval.\n\nLiterature: Seifert et al. (2011: 199).\n\nDescription: Foliicolous hyphomycetes, associated with leaf spots. Mycelium internal and external, superficial hyphae emerging through stomata, branched, pigmented, septate, thin-walled, smooth. Stromata lacking. Conidiophores macronematous, mononematous, in vivo solitary, arising from superficial hyphae, lateral, simple, occasionally branched, pigmented, septate, thick-walled, smooth; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, uni- to multilocal, sympodially or occasionally percurrently proliferating, loci truncate, flat, broad, neither thickened nor darkened, conidiogenesis thalloblastic, i.e. at first blastic, then thallic (base of conidia ± agreeing in width with the diameter of the broad conidiogenous loci). Conidia solitary, cylindrical to subclavate, occasionally disarticulating, plurieuseptate, occasionally with 1–2 additional distosepta, thick-walled, brown, smooth, not attenuated at the base, hila truncate, broad, width ± agreeing with the diameter of the conidiogenous loci, neither thickened nor darkened, conidial secession schizolytic.\n\nNotes: Due to the conidiogenesis, the structure of the conidiogenous cells and the thick-walled conidia, this genus seems to be allied to the Sporidesmium complex, but an affinity to Pseudocercospora can also not be excluded with certainty. However, the phylogenetic affinity of Eriocercosporella and its relation to the Mycosphaerellaceae are currently quite unclear. Molecular examinations of the phylogenetic position of the type species of this genus are necessary to decide if Eriocercosporella belongs to the cercosporoid or to the sporidesmioid complex. Therefore, this genus is only tentatively treated in the present context of cercosporoid genera.\n\nPantospora Cif., Ann. Mycol. 36: 242 (1938).

(2011: 325).\n\nDescription: Foliicolous hyphomycetes, associated with leaf spots, Mycosphaerellaceae. Mycelium internal; hyphae colourless or almost so. Stromata developed, pigmented. Conidiophores macronematous, in dense coremioid fascicles or synnemata, septate, pigmented, thin-walled, smooth; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, proliferation sympodial and percurrent, conidiogenous loci planate to slightly convex, neither thickened nor darkened (pseudocercospora-like). Conidia formed singly, shape variable, ellipsoid-ovoid, fusiform, clavate to obclavate, didymo- to scolecosporous, with 1–11 transverse eusepta and often a single or few oblique to longitudinal septa, hila neither thickened nor darkened.\n\nNotes: The genus Pantospora was described by Ciferri (1938). Pantospora guazumae, the type species, is a leaf-spotting hyphomycete on Guazuma ulmifolia. Dictyocephala, based on Cercospora ulmifolia described from Colombia on G. ulmifolia, is undoubtedly a synonym of Pantospora as already pointed out by Deighton (1976), who recognised the latter genus although its type species is very similar to the type species of Pseudocercospora by forming conidiophores in dense coremioid fascicles or distinct synnemata and sympodially to percurrently proliferating conidiogenous cells with unthickened, not darkened conidiogenous loci. The regular formation of oblique to longitudinal conidial septa was considered to be the only difference, although a few nonhorizontal septa may also occur in some Pseudocercospora species, including P. vitis, its type species. As there is no rational base for a morphological discrimination between the two genera, Crous & Braun (2003) reduced Pantospora to synonymy with Pseudocercospora. However, sequence analyses based on data from the rDNA ITS and nLSU region, recently carried out by Minnis et al. (2011), showed that Pantospora guazumae did neither cluster within the Pseudocercospora s. str. clade [= clade 16, including the type species P. vitis, according to Crous et al. (2009b)] nor in clade 14 with other pseudocercospora-like species. The closest relatives were rather passalora-like. These results suggest that Pantospora cannot be considered a synonym of Pseudocercospora. This genus is, at least tentatively, maintained as separate genus until a better resolution of the assemblage of species around P. guazumae will be available.\n\nParacercospora Deighton, Mycol. Pap. 144: 47 (1979).\n\nType species: Paracercospora egenula (Syd.) Deighton 1979.\n\nLiterature: Crous & Braun (2003: 22), Crous et al. (2012).\n\nDescription: Dematiaceous hyphomycete genus morphologically barely distinguishable from Pseudocercospora, but phylogenetically distinct; Mycosphaerellaceae. Mycelium in vivo internal. Conidiophores macronematous, fasciculate, pigmented; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal or conidiophores reduced to conidiogenous cells, conidiogenous loci subconspicous by being circular with very slightly thickened and darkened-refractive rim. Conidia solitary, scolecosporous, subhyaline to very pale olivaceous, hila very slightly thickened and darkened-refractive along the rim.\n\nNotes: The phylogenetic position and taxonomy of Paracercospora is complicated and not yet fully understood. Based on early phylogenetic analyses, Stewart et al. (1999) considered Paracercospora a synonym of Pseudocercospora and concluded that conidiogenous loci (scars) only slightly thickened and darkened around the rim are not sufficiently different from quite unthickened loci to be used as distinctive character on generic level, which was supported by additional rDNA ITS examinations (Crous et al. 2000, 2001). Therefore, Crous & Braun (2003) followed this conclusion and treated Paracercospora as synonym of Pseudocercospora. However, the reassessment of Paracercospora was based on data derived from non-type species, mainly P. fijiensis and P. basiramifera (Crous 1998, Arzanlou et al. 2008), which indeed cluster within the big Pseudocercospora clade. Paracercospora egenula, the type species of Paracercospora, has recently been included in molecular sequence analyses, but clustered apart of the Pseudocercospora clade in a not yet fully understood clade together with Passalora brachycarpa, a species with catenate conidia, Pseudocercospora tibuchinigena, which is morphologically indistinguishable from genuine Pseudocercospora spp., and several Mycosphaerella spp. (Crous et al. 2012). Hence, Paracercospora is currently confined to its type species, characterised by circular conidiogenous loci with slightly thickened, darkened-refractive rim and very pale conidia. Since such paracercosporoid loci as well as subhyaline or pale conidia are also known in several genuine Pseudocercospora species, there is no rational base for a morphological discrimination of the two genera, i.e. Paracercospora s. str. is currently just a phylogenetically differentiated monotypic genus.\n\nParastenella J.C.

(2011: 330).\n\nDescription: Dematiaceous hyphomycete genus resembling Zasmidium (in vivo with superficial mycelium, hyphae, conidiophores and solitary conidia pigmented, distinctly verruculose to verrucose), but the conidiogenous cells are terminal and intercalary, denticulate, with lateral short peg-like protuberances, conidiogenous loci inconspicuous, neither thickened nor darkened.\n\nNotes: The phylogenetic position of this genus is unknown. It is quite unclear if it is part of the Capnodiales and Mycosphaerellaceae at all.\n\nPseudoasperisporium U. Braun, Schlechtendalia 5: 72 (2000).\n\nType species: Pseudoasperisporium tupae (Speg.)

(2011: 363).\n\nNotes: Morphologically close to Asperisporium, but the conidiogenous loci and hila at the base of conidia are unthickened and not darkened. Species of Pseudoaspersporium are distinguished from superficially similar Fusicladium species (Venturiaceae) by having coarsely verruculose conidia. The phylogenetic affinity of this genus is, however, unclear and unproven.\n\nPseudocercosporidium Deighton, Mycol. Pap. 133: 55 (1973).\n\nType species: Pseudocercosporidium venezuelanum (Syd.)

(2011: 367).\n\nDescription: Foliicolous, plant pathogenic, leaf spotting hyphomycetes, teleomorph unknown. Mycelium internal. Stromata lacking. Conidiophores in vivo solitary or in small loose fascicles (groups) emerging through stomata, laxly erect, macronematous, frequently branched, septate, pigmented (very pale brown), thin-walled, smooth; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, intercalary or pleurogenous (as lateral branchlets), sympodial, polyblastic, conidiogenous loci conspicuous, protruding, convex (papilla-like), but wall of the loci neither thickened nor darkened, only somewhat refractive. Conidia solitary, didymo- to scolecosporous, pigmented (deeper in pigmentation than the conidiophores), thin-walled, smooth or almost so, hila neither thickened nor darkened.\n\nNotes: The phylogenetic affinity of P. venezuelanum and its relation to the Mycosphaerellaceae are unknown. Pseudocercosporidium resembles Passalora, but the structure of the conidiogenous loci is quite distinct and closer to scars of genera like Neoovularia and Pseudodidymaria (Braun 1998).\n\nQuasiphloeospora B. Sutton, Crous & Shamoun, Mycol. Res. 100: 979 (1996).\n\nType species: Quasiphloeospora saximontanensis (Deighton) B. Sutton, Crous & Shamoun 1996.\n\nLiterature: Deighton (1983: 7–8), Braun (1998: 400–401), Crous & Braun (2003: 14), Seifert et al. (2011: 376–377).\n\nDescription: Cercosporoid hyphomycetes characterised by forming large immersed sporodochium-like conidiomata with filiform, somewhat pigmented, irregularly verruculose conidiophores, aseptate, i.e. reduced to conidiogenous cells, monoblastic, determinate or sympodially to percurrently proliferating, with slightly thickened and darkened conidiogenous loci, and very pale to somewhat pigmented scolecosporous conidia formed singly.\n\nNotes: Quasiphloeospora is a cercosporoid genus with intricate morphology and complex morphological relations to several other genera, including Cercospora, Passalora and Pseudocercospora (Crous & Braun 2003), but due to very pale, almost colourless structures also to genera like Pseudocercosporella. Sutton et al. (1996) classified the conidiomata as acervuli, although they may better be referred to as sporodochia. The particular characters of Q. saximontanensis, above all the structure of the conidiogenous loci, are intermediate between the three similar genera cited above. A clear affiliation to one of these genera, just based on morphology, is not possible. It is also possible that this species is unrelated to any of the cercosporoid genera. Affinity and position of Quasiphloeospora can only be proven by means of results of molecular sequence analyses, which are, however, not yet available. This genus might belong in the Mycosphaerellaceae, but this is unproven. Thus, Quasiphloeospora is only tentatively maintained as separate cercosporoid genus.\n\nScolecostigmina U.

(2013)].\n\nLiterature: Crous & Braun (2003: 24), Crous et al. (2013: 74–75), Seifert et al. (2011: 396).\n\nDescription: Scolecostigmina is morphologically close to Pseudocercospora, above all to former Cercostigmina species (leaf spotting dematiaceous hyphomycetes with sporodochial conidiomata, macronematous densely fasciculate conidiophores, percurrently proliferating conidiogenous cells, neither thickened nor darkened applanate loci, and scolecosporous, plurieuseptate, pigmented conidia formed singly), but the wall of the conidiophores is somewhat thickened and mostly verruculose, possesses conspicuous, coarse annellations and the conidia are transversely and occasionally also obliquely or longitudinally septate.\n\nNotes: S. mangiferae, the type species, which belongs in the Mycosphaerellaceae, does not cluster within the Pseudocercospora clade, i.e. it is phylogenetically distinct, supporting Scolecostigmina as separate genus. The correct placement of numerous additional species in Scolecostigmina is, however, phylogenetically unproven and quite unclear. Sequence data derived from cultures of Scolecostigmina chibaensis on Pinus spp. in Japan (Nakashima et al. 2007) have been analysed and showed that this species is not allied to the type species of Scolecostigmina and does not belong to the Mycosphaerellaceae at all. It takes an isolated position with unclear affinity on family level, and does not belong to any other families containing cercosporoid hyphomycetes as for instance Cladosporiaceae, Dissoconiaceae or Teratosphaericeae (Nakashima, unpubl. data). Due to the phylogenetic position of Cercospora cryptomeriicola within the Pseudocercospora clade, this species has been reallocated to the latter genus, although its morphology is rather scolecostigmina-like. The conidiomata are sporodochial, conidiogenous cells proliferate percurrently with conspicuous annellations, and the walls of the conidia are thickened (Nakashima et al. 2007). These data indicate that the typical “Scolecostigmina” morphology is unreliable, i.e. all species assigned to Scolecostigmina have to be re-examined and reassessed once molecular data are available.\n\nSemipseudocercospora J.M. Yen, Mycotaxon 17: 361 (1983).\n\nType species: Semipseudocercospora peristrophes-acuminatae (J.M. Yen) J.M. Yen 1983.\n\nDescription: Morphologically close to Pseudocercospora (leaf spotting hyphomycetes with unthickened, not darkened conidiogenous loci and hila), but the conidiogenous cells are not geniculate, i.e. not distinctly sympodially proliferating, the conidiogenous loci are distinctly denticle-like, and the solitary conidia are didymo- to phragmosporous, i.e. not scolecosporous.\n\nNotes: The phylogenetic position of the type species of this genus and its relation to the Mycosphaerellaceae as well as to the genus Pseudocercospora are still unknown and unproven. Therefore, Semipseudocercospora is only tentatively maintained as separate cercosporoid genus.\n\nSirosporium Bubák & Serebrian., Hedwigia 52: 272 (1912).\n\nType species: Sirosporium antenniforme (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) Bubák & Serebrian. 1912.\n\nLiterature: Ellis (1963: 2–11; 1971: 288–290; 1976: 299–303), Braun (1995a: 39), Mel’nik (2000: 284–288), Crous & Braun (2003: 18), Seifert et al. (2011: 404).\n\nDescription: Morphologically close to Passalora, i.e. above all mycovellosiella-like (leaf spotting dematiaceous hyphomycetes with internal and external mycelium, superficial hyphae giving rise to solitary conidiophores, lateral and terminal, conidiophores may also be formed in fascicles, conspicuous conidiogenous loci and hila, thickened and darkened, conidia solitary, size, shape and septation variable), but the conidia are relatively thick-walled and at least partly dictyosporous.\n\nNotes: The morphological differentiation between Sirosporium and mycovellosiella-like Passalora species is vague. The phylogenetic meaning and value of thick conidial walls and oblique to longitudinal septa as distinguishing characters between Sirosporium and Passalora is unclear. The phylogenetic position of the type species of Sirosporium is still unknown. As already proposed in Braun (1995a) as well as Crous & Braun (2003), Sirosporium is tentatively treated as separate genus and should be confined to species with dictyosporous conidia with thick walls.\n\nCercospora\n\nTabular key to Cercospora species on ferns\n\nMost species on ferns belong to the Cercospora apii complex (sensu Crous & Braun 2003), i.e. they are morphologically very similar and morphologically little differentiated, so that it is barely possible to key out the species concerned just based on morphology.

Hsieh. To-anun et al. (2011: 75, fig. 58) described and illustrated a Cercospora collection on Pteris biaurita from Thailand and referred it to C. cyclosori.

Several Cercospora spp. have been described from other hosts of the Pteridaceae. Furthermore, C. cyclosori, to which this collection was assigned, is morphologically C. apii-like.\n\nCercospora diplaziicola A.K. Das, Indian J. Mycol.

However, type material of the latter species could not be traced, is probably not maintained and thus cannot be re-examined to prove the variation of the conidial shape. It is possible that the two species described from Diplazium esculentum in Asia are conspecific.

(1964: 182–183), Greene (1960), Saccardo (1972: 1382), Crous & Braun (2003: 340), Kamal (2010: 133).\n\nIllustrations: Lall et al. (1964: 182, fig. 3), Braun & Mel’nik (1997: 121, fig. 49).\n\nDescription: Leaf spots amphigenous, formed as irregular discolorations, yellowish brown, brown, later darker, margin indefinite. Caespituli hypophyllous, subeffuse, not very conspicuous. Mycelium internal and external; superficial hyphae branched, septate, 2–6 µm wide, smooth, thin-walled, subhyaline to olivaceous. Stromata lacking or only formed as small substomatal hyphal aggregations. Conidiophores in small, loose fascicles, arising from internal hyphae or hyphal aggregations, or solitary, arising from superficial hyphae, erect to decumbent, flexuous, simple or occasionally branched, subcylindrical to somewhat clavate, to geniculate-sinuous, 20–100 × 5–10 µm, continuous to pluriseptate, olivaceous to brownish, thin-walled, smooth; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, often somewhat swollen, subclavate, about 20–40 µm long, conidiogenous loci conspicuous, somewhat thickened and darkened. Conidia solitary, broadly obclavate-subcylindrical, (30−)40–120(−140) × 5–8 µm, pluriseptate, hyaline, subhyaline to pale olivaceous, thin-walled, smooth, apex obtuse, base obconically truncate, hila slightly thickened and darkened.\n\nHolotype: Russia: Pskhu, Caucasus Mts., on Pteridium aquilinum, 1917, W. Siemaszko (not seen).\n\nHost range and distribution: On Pteridium (aquilinum, Pteridium sp.), Dennstaedtiaceae, Asia (India, Japan), Caucasus (Georgia), Europe (Russia, Spain), North America (USA, Wisconsin).\n\nNotes: Type material of C. pteridis could not be traced in Siemaszko’s herbarium at WA. The reallocation of this species to Mycovellosiella and Passalora, respectively, was based on the examination of type material of Cercospora pteridicola. The identity of a Japanese collection on Pteridium aquilinum subsp. japonicum (P. aquilinum var. latiusculum), Iwate, 31 Aug. 1947, K. Sawada (IUM-FS79), recorded by Sawada (1958) as Cercospora pteridis, is unclear and remains unproven as this sample is devoid of any fructification, which has been confirmed by a recently made re-examination. Records of this species from India and Myanmar on Pteridium sp. (Lall et al. 1964, Thaung 1984) are also unclear and unproven. Material was not available for a re-examination. A previous record from Colombia on Pteris sp. (Chupp 1954) was based on a misidentification and belongs to a Pseudocercospora described in this paper as P. pteridigena.\n\nPassalora pyrrosiae (Togashi & Katsuki) C. Nakash. & I.
