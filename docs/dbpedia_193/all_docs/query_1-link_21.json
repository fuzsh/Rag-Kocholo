        "text": "Cucurbits, plants belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family, have been cultivated for edible purposes or grow wild throughout the world. Several cucurbits, such as watermelon, cucumber, melon, and pumpkin, are economically important crops cultivated in Korea. In 2018, 29,508 ha were used for cucurbit production, occupying about 10% of the total area used for vegetable production in Korea [Citation1]. Among cucurbits, melon (Cucumis melo L.) is one of the most popular tropical fruits and is cultivated for its juicy and sweet taste worldwide. The cultivated area of melon in Korea has fluctuates slightly each year; however, the average area over the last decade (2009–2018) was about 1530 ha [Citation1].\n\nIn November 2016, circular leaf spots were observed on the leaves of melon in a greenhouse located in Gochang, Korea (35°21′02.6″N, 126°32′58.8″E) (). Initially, small pale brown spots with a yellow halo were observed on the leaves; later, they coalesced to from larger irregular dark brown lesions (). The centers of the lesions became grayish white. As the disease progressed, the diseased leaves finally wilted and dried (). About 80–90% of plants presented these symptoms. The identity of the disease-causing agent was determined based on morphological characteristics, molecular analyses, and a pathogenicity test.\n\nSmall sections of leaf tissue were excised from lesions and surface-sterilized by dipping in 70% ethanol for 3 min and 1% sodium hypochlorite for 1 min, after which they were rinsed in sterile distilled water. To isolate the causal agent, the leaf tissues were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates and incubated at 25 °C. Mycelia growing out from the plant tissues were subcultured on fresh PDA plates. All cultures showed same colony morphology, and one representative fungal isolate (16–525) was selected for use in subsequent experiments. The culture was deposited in the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection as KACC 48922. Morphological features of fungal structures formed on fresh plant materials were examined and photographed using a Zeiss AXIO Zoom V16 and AXIO Imager A2 microscopes equipped with AxioCam 506 color (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Colonies on the PDA were pale pinkish to light gray, with cottony aerial mycelium, and reached approximately 65 mm diameter at 25 °C after 10-day incubation (). Morphologically, stromata were poorly developed, consisting of brown hyphal cells, and were 3–10 µm in size (). Conidiophores were fasciculate, olivaceous brown, paler toward the apex, straight to slightly curved, 3–15-septate, 50–250 × 3–5 µm (). Conidia were hyaline, acicular to cylindric, truncate to subtruncate at the base, 3–17-septate, and 40–200 × 3–5 µm (). The morphological characteristics of the causal fungus were consistent with the description of Cercospora flagellaris Ellis & G. Martin [Citation2–4].\n\nMulti-gene sequence analysis was performed to identify the fungal species. An aerial mycelium scraped from a 7-day-old culture was used to extract genomic DNA. Sequences of five genes; the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region including 5.8S rDNA, translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF), actin (ACT), calmodulin (CAL), and histone3 (HIS), were amplified and sequenced using the primer pairs described by Groenewald et al. [Citation4]. The sequences derived from this study were registered in GenBank (). Reference sequences of Cercospora spp., including C. cf. flagellaris, were downloaded from GenBank (), and used to construct a phylogenetic tree. A neighbor-joining (NJ) tree was generated based on a concatenated five-locus dataset using MEGA7 [Citation5] (). Septoria provencialis (CBS 118910) was used as an outgroup. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the present isolate from melon formed a well-supported clade together with isolates of C. cf. flagellaris obtained from diverse host plants with a bootstrap value of 98%.\n\nThe pathogenicity of the present isolate from melon was tested in a glasshouse on melon seedlings. The leaves of young plants at the second-leaf stage were spray-inoculated with mycelial suspension from the fungal isolate following growth on PDA for 10 days. Plants without fungal inoculum served as the control. After inoculation, plants were sealed in plastic bags, transferred to a growth chamber at 25 °C, and maintained for 48 h. Leaf spot symptoms appeared on the inoculated plants 7 days after inoculation (). The symptoms were not visible on non-inoculated control plants. The fungus was re-isolated from the symptomatic tissues of inoculated plants. A pathogenicity test revealed that the present isolate was pathogenic to melon seedlings, thus fulfilling Koch’s postulates.\n\nThe genus Cercospora includes important phytopathogens that cause leaf spot diseases on many host plants worldwide [Citation6,Citation7]. Currently, polyphasic approaches based on ecology, morphology, cultural characteristics, and molecular phylogeny, are used to identify Cercospora species following the consolidated species concept [Citation8]. Multi-gene phylogeny inferred from the sequence data of five genes (ITS rDNA, TEF, ACT, CAL, and HIS) has been used to identify and delimit Cercospora species [Citation4,Citation9–13]. More recently, three genes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2), and β-tubulin (TUB), were found to be useful for improving the phylogenetic resolution of Cercospora species complexes, including C. apii, C. armoraciae, C. beticola, and C. cf. flagellaris [Citation14]. Members of the C. cf. flagellaris species complex were phylogenetically separated into three distinct clades but were indistinguishable by morphology or host range [Citation14]."
