Could someone please help me confirm if this is the case, and if so, which fungicide you've had luck with?\n\nMy bigger concern is that all the growing tips are brown and seem dead. I've been using a moisture meter to make sure I'm not overwatering, so I don't think it's a moisture problem. There's a ficus elastica right next to it that is thriving, so I don't think it's a lighting problem either.\n\nShould I trim off these dead tips to encourage new growth, or just be patient while the plant recovers?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\nEdit: I recently discovered some mealybugs on the leaves, so perhaps the black spots were due to them, rather than a fungus?"
