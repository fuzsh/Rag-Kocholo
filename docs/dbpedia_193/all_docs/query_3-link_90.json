        "text": "The following plant disease highlights from the University of Kentucky Plant Disease Diagnostic Laboratories represent recent sample submissions from field crops, fruit, vegetables, and ornamentals.\n\nDiagnostic samples of agronomic crops from the last two weeks have had southern rust, gray leaf spot, Fusarium root rot, and anthracnose stalk rot on corn; brown spot, downy mildew, Cercospora leaf blight, frogeye leaf spot, potassium deficiency, stem canker, anthracnose, sudden death syndrome, and soybean cyst nematode on soybean; frogeye leaf spot, brown spot, black shank, soreshin, boron deficiency, compaction, frenching, and hollow stalk on tobacco.\n\nOn fruit, vegetable and herb crops, we have diagnosed Septoria leaf spot on blueberry; bitter rot on grape; Mycosphaerella leaf spot on pear; Cercospora leaf spot on hops; early blight on celery (Figure 1); thrips injury on lettuce; ripe rot (anthracnose) and Phytophthora blight on pepper; downy mildew on squash; Pythium root rot, blossom end rot, and tomato spotted wilt on tomato; and blossom end rot on watermelon.\n\nOn ornamental samples, we have seen Pythium root rot and Fusarium wilt on chrysanthemum; bacterial stalk rot on sunflower; powdery mildew on sedum, crape myrtle, and dogwood; Phyllosticta leaf spot on maple; bacterial leaf scorch on hackberry, sycamore and oak; Botryosphaeria dieback on elm; Stigmina needle blight and Rhizosphaera needle cast on spruce; and Armillaria root rot on sweetgum.\n\nBy Julie Beale and Brenda Kennedy, Plant Disease Diagnosticians"
