The fungus causes lesions of about 2-15 mm diameter. The frog-eye shape of the lesions gives the disease its common name. Lesions are greyish-brown, with necrotic tissue like parchment in the centre. Conidia and short conidiophores are scattered in the centre of the lesion as minute black dots. Spots occur mostly on the lower leaves, near the ground, because old, mature leaves are more susceptible than young and apical growing leaves. In wet weather spots also occur on younger leaves. Near harvest time the middle to large leaves can show numerous, heavily necrotized spots.\n\nList of Symptoms/Signs\n\nPrevention and Control\n\nCultural Practices\n\nRemoval and destruction of infected tobacco stalks and roots should be carried out when preparing for a new tobacco crop, although rotation may be more effective. Elimination of weed-host reservoirs of C. nicotianae around tobacco fields could also help to control the disease.\n\nExcess nitrogen fertilization enhances susceptibility to the pathogen and should be avoided. Balanced fertilization and light planting density reduce the incidence of leaf spots (Tanton and Abington, 1979). Overhead irrigation can favour disease development by allowing periods of free water on leaves.\n\nChemical Control\n\nDue to the variable regulations around (de-)registration of pesticides, we are for the moment not including any specific chemical control recommendations. For further information, we recommend you visit the following resources:\n\n•\n\nPAN pesticide database (www.pesticideinfo.org)\n\n•\n\nYour national pesticide guide\n\nImpact\n\nC. nicotianae causes yield losses on tobacco in many countries. Since 1960 it has become a serious leaf problem on the shade-grown cigar types grown in Central America.When numerous spots are present on cured leaves, the quality of tobacco smoke is seriously compromised. Infection by C. nicotianae reduces alkaloid, sugar and total phenol concentrations, while increasing the nitrogen content, mainly in infected leaves from higher stalk positions (Stavely and Chaplin, 1972). Reduction of sugars and total phenols is greater in flue-cured than in air-cured leaves.The disease spreads in latitude 35° above and below the equator, reaching most tobacco-producting areas (Lucas, 1975), but is a problem for tobacco crops mainly in Central America, India, Taiwan, Nigeria and Pakistan (Fajola and Alasoadura, 1973; Reddy et al., 1992).\n\nInformation & Authors\n\nInformation\n\nPublished In\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © CABI.
