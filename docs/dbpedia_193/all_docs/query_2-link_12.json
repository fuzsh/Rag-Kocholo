        "text": "A fungal disease which affects mostly older leaves.\n\nThe spots start as small brown flecks, expanding to brown round to slightly angular spots with grey centres up to 1 cm diameter (Photos 1-3). The spots have reddish-brown margins, sometimes with yellow halos. The spots dry and pieces fall out giving a ragged look. The fungus also causes spots on the pods and grows inside them.\n\nSpread is by spores in wind and rain. Survival between crops is on seed, and in crop debris. It may also survive on weeds.\n\nCULTURAL CONTROL\n\nBefore planting:\n\nUse wide spacing, 50 x 30 cm, so that air movement dries the leaves quickly after rains.\n\nAvoid overlapping crops, preventing spores from older crops infecting newer ones. If not possible, then plant the newer crop far from those established already.\n\nDuring plant growth:\n\nIf practical, prune the older infected leaves when spots are first seen to prevent further spread of spores.\n\nWeed regularly.\n\nIn commercial plantings, use drip irrigation. If using overhead irrigation, time it so that plants dry out rapidly after watering.\n\nAfter harvest:\n\nCollect and burn or plough in trash.\n\nPractice crop rotation, using maize or sorghum, or root crops, between crops of legumes planted on the same land.\n\nRESISTANT VARIETIES\n\nThere are less susceptible varieties of cowpea and mung bean.\n\nCHEMICAL CONTROL\n\nTreat seed with thiram, captan or mancozeb. It is very unlikely that fungicides will be required to control this disease in the field; if they are required, use mancozeb or copper.\n\n____________________\n\nWhen using a pesticide, always wear protective clothing and follow the instructions on the product label, such as dosage, timing of application, and pre-harvest interval. Recommendations will vary with the crop and system of cultivation. Expert advice on the most appropriate pesticides to use should always be sought from local agricultural authorities."
