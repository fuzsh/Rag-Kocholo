        "text": "The intrepid MykoGolfer, winner of the Golf Cup, is now providing regular updates to our website. Watch this space....\n\nFUNGAL SNIPPETS for 2012 / 2011 / 2010 / 2009\n\nOut early this morning to Speke Hall in order to take a look round before the dogs and kids arrive. The car park opens early and the surrounding strip of woodland is usually rewarding. This morning I counted 20 Amanita phalloides (Death Cap) with lots of little ones to come. Also a sweet smelling Hebeloma sacchariolens (Sweet Poisonpie). Once the Hall opened I identified a number of rusts and mildews but a few are unidentified because I could not tell what the plant was, many being non native. One Conocybe apala (Milky Conecap) in the orchard but nothing on The North Lawn. It was in the adjoining woodland that I came across Apioperdon pyriforme (Stump Puffball) and a splendid display of Pleurotus pulmonarius (Pale Oyster). One Inocybe (Fibrecap) that I have not yet been able to identify. No surprise there.\n\nMy intention was to look for truffles following the adventures of some of my colleagues on Facebook. I knew of a most promising area at Hale Hall woods. Large mature trees with an extensive open woodland floor. But it was winter when I last visited. To my disappointment, a couple of the mature trees had been downed and the whole area was covered in thick vegetation. Not a squirrel excavation to be seen. The only higher fungus I found was a nice group of Ramaria stricta (Upright Coral). Not truffles though, are they?\n\nIt has not been the weather for fungi forays. Pouring rain and when it is not raining I have had other things to do. My collections have been restricted to rusts and mildews on various weeds and flowers at the allotment site. Until today. I have a patch of ornamental grass that has been identified by Liverpool Botanical Society as Phalaris arundinaris var. picta, a variety of Canary Reed Grass. The grass has grown outside my back door since I bought the house decades ago. I noticed that the seed heads were darker than I have seen before. Closer inspection revealed black seeds. I suspected a fungus so put some under the microscope which revealed spores of a smut fungus. With the help of Debbie Evans, co-author of a book about the smuts of Wales, we identified the smut as Tilletia menieri. There are only eight records on the National Database. After an exchange of Emails I have been asked to send it to Kew to be kept in The Fungarium. You just never know what might turn up.\n\nA morning walk around some local parks. Not a lot of finds. My difficulty is that Liverpool Council have extended No Mow May to No Mow Anywhere Ever. Most of my favourite spots are overgrown and the paths impassable. I need a machete. Two interesting finds. Crepidotus luteolus (Yellowing Oysterling) on dead nettle stems. Not too hard to identify as most of this Genus grow on wood and nettle is its favioured host. The other was the tiny Marasmius setosus (Beechleaf Parachute) that grows on the petioles of dead Beech leaves. Beech is the dominant tree in this park but identifying a rotten leaf is not easy.\n\nIt is so cold and windy. None of the tender veg such as courgettes and borlotti beans are making any progress on my allotment. I decided to go fungi hunting instead. I went to Springwood Crematorium where the trees give a bit of cover from the keen breeze. But nothing much was growing. A single Geastrum striatum (Collared Earthstar) and a group of Geastrum floriforme (Daisy Earthstar) in their ususal spot. Both under Cupressus as were a few Chlorophyllum rhacodes (Shaggy Parasol).\n\nI managed to get out today and joined Liverpool Botanical Society at Hightown on the Sefton Coast. I did not expect much in the way of fungi and I was correct. Only one species, Psathyrella ammophila in the marram grass on the frontal dunes. We did identify some uncommon plants like Clustered Clover and Twiggy Spurge. Also a few Bee Orchids. In the village, numerous plants grew on the sandy grass verges. We met Phil Smith, the local expert, who had identified 130 plant species along the roadside. Not a rust fungus on any of them. I did eventually find Bovista nigrescens (Brown Puffball) on my way back to the station.\n\nIt was a nice day. Heavy gales forecast for the weekend. Time for a walk to test progress of my plantar fasciitis problem. I decided on Freshfield Dune Heath which is easy for me to get to by train. I was disappointed to discover that in the year I have been unable to walk far, the Reserve has been fenced off, leaving only a muddy path through adjoining woods. My favourite bits were inaccessible. The wood had one or two species, one being a Postia. Very difficult to identify except this had sausage type spores so this cuts the field down. My best guess is Postia hibernica. Not often recorded and very little voucher material which probably reflects the identification problem. I shall lodge my specimen at Liverpool Museum. I also found a very nice stalked Ascomycete on a dead herbaceous stem but I have not been able to identify it yet (if I ever do). My foot held up but I am out of condition after a year off.\n\nThe weather has been so poor that I have not been able to venture far. Even the golf course is closed. I managed to mow my lawn today. The Entolomas (Pinkgills) had increased in number to about twenty. Usually I only get a couple. They had been joined by a group Psathyrella corrugis (Red Stem Brittlegill). This is a species that grows in association with wood remants, sawdust or buried. It must have beeen growing on the remains of my old, dead Cotoneaster that I had to cut down last year. I cut it into pieces on the lawn. It will be interesting to see if any return.\n\nNo rain today so I went to see if anything was showing at Speke Hall. Surprising that there were not many visitors. Not many fungi either. Nor were there any gilled fungi either. A few crust fungi and a slime mould, Trichia decipiens. One of the crusts caused me a problem. It was on very rotten wood in a pile within a Scot's pine area. Under the microscope it looked a bit tired. I assumed it would be a common Phlebiopsis. I put it in for a spore print that I looked at this morning. The spores clearly identified the specimen as Subulicystidium longisporum. But this grows with beech. Someone had piled wood from other areas of Speke in one heap. Confusing. I wish people were not so tidy.\n\nI took advantage of a break in the rain for a quick walk to the crematorium grounds. Still nothing of note around except for a large patch of Entoloma sericium (Silky Pinkgill) on the large lawn. I even ventured down to the Eric Hardy Reserve but had to give up when one of my wellies came off in the mud. I am surprised that I am not finding many crust fungi under the damp fallen wood.\n\nI decided to give a first cut to my tufty lawns before it rains again. To my surprise I had six Entoloma sericium (Silky Pinkgill) growing. Early, but I have found them on my lawn in February before.\n\nIt was such a nice afternoon so I paid a visit to Speke Hall. Being the last day of half term it was packed to the gills with children in the various play areas. I retreated to the adjoining Stockton's Wood. I only saw three people. Heaven. Still no gilled fungi in my collection, only crusts and a couple of brackets. The problem I find in local woods, especially maintained parks, is the lack of decent size pieces of fallen wood. This particular wood frequently loses trees in severe gales. But although there are numerous fallen and decaying trunks, there are very few large branches lying around. The size being easy to roll over and more likely to support fungi. Where do they go? My finds included the colourful Peniophora incarnata (Rosy Crust) and Phlebiella sulphurea (Yellow Cobweb), this woodland being the only place I find the latter.\n\nNot everything goes to plan. I decided to take a look at a wood I have never visited, Mill Wood, Speke. It is one of the few remnants of ancient forest left in Liverpool. I have been told it is alive with fungi in autumn. It is situated on the edge of a huge Liverpool Council estate. Looking at the path it is obviously popular with the biker boys. Boots on, I set off and then realised it is a wellies job. Undeterred, after twenty yards I was faced with a huge puddle. I tried to go round. My foot got snagged by a bramble. I then fell into the puddle. Fortunately a soft landing in the deep mud. End of visit. 'He stepped in a puddle, right up to his middle and never went there again'\n\nA nice morning until another gale arrived. Not much around. A couple of poor samples from dead wood that proved easy to identify from the spores. The crust fungus Cylindrobasidium laeve is known as the Teardropper because of the spore shape. The other was a mystery until I managed to spot some very tiny spores in my microscope. They are allantoid or sausage shaped, difficult to see unless you keep changing the focus. It had to be Skeletocutis but because of the condition I had not noticed any pores. I did spot some eventually and was helped by the specimen changing colour to an orangy colour as it dried. My conclusion is Skeletocutis amorpha.There is a Larch plantation at the entrance to this wood although I suspect my rotten piece had been deposited by a dog.\n\nI visited Black Wood in Childwall, Liverpool. It was one of the first woods that I forayed when I began my interest in fungi. It was very good then but in recent years I have found very little on my visits. I did not expect much today and was proved correct. A lot of birch with some beech and oak, there is a lot of dead wood to examine. After over an hour of searching, looking under logs and along branches, all I found of interest was one Scleroderma citrinum (Earthball), two Skeletocutis semipileata and Kretzschmaria deusta (Brittle Cinder). Even Auricularia (Jelly Ear), Stereum (Hairy Curtain Crust) and Trametes (Turkey Tail) were difficult to find.\n\nIt stopped raining for an hour so I took advantage to take a bit of fresh air after last night. I took a look at a small wood beside Dowsefield Lane, Liverpool. A very damp area hence the name of the lane. The wood is marked on my plan as The Imagined Forest but I have no idea why. I Must ask. For once the boy racers had stayed in bed. But apart from a couple of Crepidotus Mollis (Peeling Oysterling) everything else was a white crust fungus from the underside of dead wood. I identified Botryobasidium aureum which is easy because of the large lemon shaped conidia. Another on broadleaf, had basidiospores of a size that matched Botryobasidium vagum. The other six specimens that I collected all microscoped as Hyphodontia sambuci (Elder Whitewash). Not very interesting. Then it rained.\n\nChristmas Day in the morning and it was not raining. I therefore took the opportunity to take a walk in the woods at Hale Village. I did not expect to get too far as there are a couple of ponds that overflow when it rains hard and the paths turn to thick mud. First find was of Mycena inclinata (Clustered Bonnet) on an oak stump, followed by the tiny Crepidotus epibryus (Grass Oysterling) on a sycamore leaf in pile of dead leaves. I found Mycena filopes (Iodine Bonnet) and a couple of common crust fungi. While searching the undergrowth I spotted something on a tiny piece of thin bramble stem. It has taken me until the 30th to work out what it is, with the help of colleagues. It is the crust fungus Aleurodiscus aurantius. My photo shows how small it is. Lucky find. A new personal record so a good end to the year.\n\nAt last it has stopped raining. I needed a walk so went to one of my local sites to see if anything had not been drowned. In the woods were a number of fruitings of Flammulina velutipes (Velvet Shank) in very good codition. A couple of common Mycenas (Bonnets). I was surprised to find two Geastrum floriforme (Daisy Earthstar) under Cupressus leylandii. In the same spot as my first find in 2019. Then it started to rain again.\n\nLooking at the weather forecast I decided to have one last visit to Speke Hall to see if any waxcaps had shown their presence on the North Lawn. Disappointingly, all I found were Gliophorus psittacinus. No other grassland species at all. This piece of grassland has always been the best spot in Liverpool for these fungi. Perhaps the heavy rain has defeated them for this year. A look round the woodland delivered the tiny Crepidotus epibryus (Grass Oysterling) on small twigs and a leaf and a group of Infunibulicybe geotropa (Trooping Funnel) but little else.\n\nA couple of years ago I dug out the root ball of a bamboo plant that had started to send out runners. It was too heavy to lift so I rolled into a corner of my garden where it has remained, hopefully rotting away. I happened to look at it to see if I could shift it and was surprised to see numerous fungi fruit bodies growing from it. I identified them as Mycena leptocephala (Nitrous Bonnet). Turning it round I saw that it is also growing Psilocybe cyanescens (Blueleg Brownie). I shall leave it where it is for the time being to see if it produces anything else. The Mycena is probably growing from soil that adheres to the ball but the Psilocybe usually grows from rotten wood so bamboo is an unusual host.\n\nAt last a sunny dry morning. I went Springwood Crematorium which is just down the road. I hoped to find waxcaps but none were there. The Council have been clearing up after the recent storms and placed the fallen wood into piles. Very convenient for me. I identified a few crust fungi such as Phlebia rufa and Postia subcaesia on the dead branches. In the pine plantation was a huge ring of over one hundred Clitocybe nebula (Clouded Agaric) surrounding a fir tree. I also came across Tricoloma ustale (Burnt Knight) well camouflaged under the autumn leaves.\n\nBeautiful sunny morning although a bit too bright when looking for fungi. As I had recorded some waxcaps, including on a neighbour's lawn, I paid a visit to Speke Hall. The North Lawn is usually excellent for waxcaps and other grassland fungi. Today nothing but a few Cystoderma amianthinum and a couple of Clavulinopsis helvola (Yellow Club). I think all the rain is affecting them. The only area of interest was where a fallen pine tree had been cut into pieces. Growing on the wood was Phlebiospis gigantea, a waxy crust fungus. Interestingly this species is used commercially to impede the growth of Heterobasidion annosum (Root Rot) which also grew on these trunk pieces.\n\nThe rain stopped so I paid a visit to a local park, Allerton Towers. Fallen leaves and mud. There is a small piece of lawn that supports waxcaps. It did and there were hundreds of Gliophorus psittacinus (Parrot Waxcap). But nothing else. I did locate four Geastrum striatum (Striate Earthstar) in a small plantation but that was it.\n\nThe weather forecast looked dreadful so I took advantage of a bit of sunshine to take a walk to a local park, Clarke Gardens and the adjacent Springwood Crematorium. I toured the parts where fungi usually grow and recorded what I expected to be there. No surprises. Of interest was lots of Gymnopus fuscopurpuresu under a Cupressus as, according to the literature, it does not grow under conifer. Yes it does. A first find of Leotia lubrica (Jellybaby) on this site and my first find of Calycina herbarum on a dead nettle. The rotting Sycamore is still displaying a fine collection of Coprinellus disseminatus (Fairy Inkcap).\n\nI agreed to take a training foray for Merseyside Biobank staff at Speke Hall. I took a look round on Wednesday afternoon and found very little so was not optimistic. Friday morning it was raining which was not promising but by the time we had assembled at 10am the weather perked up. We had permission to go into Speke Hall but I had found a few specimens in the car park so we started there. My group of eight started to find fungi everywhere. I shall have to go to Specsavers. We spent an hour and a half on one hundred yards of woodland surrounding the car park were we recorded over thirty species. We eventually went into Speke Hall and had a look at the main lawn for twenty minutes where more species were recorded that were not growing the previous day. The total was forty-eight identified. Not bad for the distance covered.\n\nI went to Court Hey Park in Huyton to arrange a training foray for staff of Merseyside Biobank. An old site having belonged to Gladstone's elder brother in the 19thCentury. I had a look round to ascertain the most promising areas. Since I was last there one good area is now an adventure playground and it looks like the local population have run riot everywhere else. I found one Tricholoma. I would suggest another site but there is no guarantee it would be any better. I hope more eyes on the day will produce something. I may have to bring specimens in from elsewhere.\n\nMet up with my friend Dave Higginson-Tranter who was taking a foray at Speke Hall. Before he started we had a little wander round the woods surrounding the car park and checked on the Amanita phalloides (Death Cap). Only a few this year but still going strong. Nothing new to add to my recent visit. I was going to join him in Speke Hall but it poured down. I made my excuses and left.\n\nVisit to my local library hoping for something intelligent to read. Outside is a raised shrubbery with a small Abies alba (Silver Fir). It was surrounded by a host of Inocybes (Fibrecaps). Not easy to identify but having just one species I was able to concenrate on it. I am very confident that it is Inocybe posterula. Goes to show that you can find fungi anywhere.\n\nI felt confident enough to join North West Fungus Group at Rixton Clay Pits near Warrington. I lasted longer than I thought I would but gave up eventually. Some interesting finds especially Tricholoma quercetorum, a species that has only recently been reported for the UK. Others that I had not seen before were Cortinarius largus and Paxillus olivellus. My contribution was Tomentella fuscocinerea, a nondescript white fungus that grows on damp soil. Very spiny spores.\n\nStill suffering from my sore heel, I tested it out at Speke Hall at the end of September. After walking round the large North Lawn I had to call it a day. They had cut the grass so all I found were bits of Lycoperdon utriformis. Still easily identifiable. The only other siting of note was Fistulina hepatica (Beefsteak Fungus) near to where my car was parked. I had hoped to go to Ainsdale on the following Saturday and join North West Fungus Group at Wepre on Sunday but my foot was too sore. I gave it a rest until Thursday the 5th October when I tried it out at Calderstones Park and survived. A couple of interesting finds. Phaeoclavulina (Ramaria) curta an uncommon coral fungus under coniferous trees and Singerocybe (Clitocybe) phaeophthalma (Chicken Run Funnel). The Funnel Cap smells disgusting.\n\nI managed a quick hobble round before it rained. Not much showing at the moment. Agaricus augustus (The Prince) under Yew, Lactarius blennius (Beech Milkcap) and Russula ionochlora (Oilslick Brittlegill) under Beech and a couple of common small species in the grass. My mystery Milkcap is still there. I took another specimen. After taking it apart and using Geoffrey Kibby's key from his Lactarius book, my conclusion is Lactarius pallidus (Pale Milkcap). Although it is not particularly pale it is said to darken with age. Nothing else seems to fit. New one for me.\n\nDodging rain showers again. I was able to get out for a quick walk around the gardens at Liverpool Crematorium. Some new arrivals under Beech were Russula nobilis (Beechwood Sickener) and a milk cap I had not seen before. I usually find Lactarius blennius in this area but this turned out to be a close relative, Lactarius fluens (photo). Both have very acrid milk. Under a small stand of Cupressus, I counted six Geastrum striatum (Striate Earthstar) and along the boundary, again Cupressus, I found a small collection of the rare Geastrum floriforme (Daisy Earthstar). This the third year running it has grown in this one small spot. The Cupressus also supported Echinoderma asperum (Freckled Dapperling) and the uncommon Lepiota ochraceofulva, the latter being another that reappears in the same place every year.\n\nI am struggling with plantar fasciitis at the moment but I still managed to hobble to the North West Fungus Group foray at Wigan Flashes. I only lasted until lunchtime but I still managed to make my contribution. Tarzetta catinus (Greater Toothed Club), Mycoacia uda, a few Ascomycetes on dead nettle stems and the star of my effort, Flagelloscypha minutissima. It looks like a common Ascomycete but is one of the tiniest Basidiomycetes. My colleagues made some interetsing finds in my absence. Details will appear in the NWFG website in due course.\n\nI went to Speke Hall to see if the Amanita phalloides (Death Cap) had returned after the bumper crop of over 50 last year. Since then the National Trust has 'maintained' the area by cutting down the tree saplings. The police have used the area for training woodland searches. There has been a lot of disturbance. The result is that I counted only a dozen. A few Lactarius pyrogalus (Fiery Milkcap) were present. Yes, I stupidly tasted it. A very nice collection of Clitocybe odora, unusually under pine (Aniseed Funnel). Lovely smell. Other finds were of Leotia lubrica (Jelly Babies) and Clavulina rugosa (Wrinkled Club) both in large quantities.\n\nA quick turn round a couple of local parks while the rain stopped. Fungi are starting to appear but not many. All my finds were in one small area of mixed woodland at Springwood Crematorium in Liverpool. A nice fruiting of Agaricus arvensis (Horse Mushroom) in some open grass but the insects had got there first. I was able to compare them with a patch of Agaricus xanthodermus (Yellow Stainer) growing out from the adjoining cemetery, bright chrome yellow when cut and without the pleasant almond smell. A single Lacrarius deliciosus (Saffron Milkcap) and a lone Russula sanguinaria (Bloody Brittlegill) under on of the pines. A nearby stand of beech revealed a mass of Russula nigricans (Blackening Britlegill).\n\nAfter all the rain, I ventured out again. This time to my favourite local woods at Hale beside Liverpool Airport. There are always large piles of prunings and stumps and woodchip by the entrance. I am not sure that this debris is from the site but it has produced numerous interesting fungi over the years. Today it was a group of Agaricus sylvicola (Wood Mushroom). I cut out a tiny red object from a rotten tree that turned out to be Scutelina crinita. Under the same tree I spotted a couple of yellowish fungi. I assumed they would be Pluteus leoninus but the cap cuticle has round cells not long ones. The choice is between Pluteus romellii (Golden Shield) and chrysophaeus (Yellow Shield). I have not yet worked out which it is. Having regard to the varying descriptions in the literature and the similarity of the microscopics, I may never do so.\n\nA visit to Speke Hall proved more rewarding than expected. Nothing unusual. Amanita rubescens (Blusher), Parasola auricoma (Golden Haired Inkcap) on wood chip and Parasola plicatilis (Pleated Inkcap) on the lawn, I intended to walk through the woods but it was so dull that it was too dark to see anything much.\n\nSaturday's violent thunderstorms encouraged lots of Agrocybe pediades (Common Fieldcap) to sprout on the grass paths round my allotment. I had a walk round the site but nothing else had shown themselves.\n\nAt last, I found a fungus. At my allotment on a grass path, I came across Boletus cisalpinus (Bluefoot Bolete). Easy to identify because the flesh in the cap and stem turn blue when cut. Said to grow with oak but I could not see one. I do know that squirrels bury acorns on my plot so there must be one close by. This find encouraged me to take a look at my local haunts. Apart from a couple of Marasmius rotula (Collared Parachute), I found only a few common crust fungi including Peniophorella pubera. Under a microscope I could see the remnants of the encrusted cystidia. Better than nothing. Hopefully things will pick up soon.\n\nDespite the fact that it has not rained for weeks in the Liverpool area, I decided on a visit to Freshfield Dune Heath at Formby. It was hot, sandy and dry. It did not look promising and so it proved. I did find a couple of Psathyrella candolleana, now Candolleomyces candolleanus (Pale Brittlestem) and some Laccaria tortilis (Twisted Deceiver). Both species were next to each other under the same birch tree. By midday, it was getting hotter so I crossed the golf course to Ainsdale Pinewoods where it was much cooler. I found nothing. By the time I left for home I had spent four hours walking over five miles for two fungi.\n\nI went out with Liverpool Botanical Society to Dibbinsdale Nature Reserve. A large patch of Ficaria verna subsp. verna (Lesser Celandine) was immediately identified. It was infected by the rust Uromyces dactylidis. I then delved into the dead stems of nettle and hogweed on which I identified a number of species that included Stictis stellata and an uncommon Pyrenopeziza chailletii. The long spores are up to 31 x 3 m. One short piece of nettle produced four different species. Only a couple of gilled fungi, both inkcaps. Strangely there were no Sulphur Tufts, no Glistening Inkcaps, No Jelly Ears nor Birch Polypore, all of which are common elsewhere.\n\nMy front lawn has sprouted numerous Entoloma sericeum (Silky Pinkgill) and some Galerina clavata (Ribbed Bell), Encouraged by these finds, I went to one of my local parks and found the same two fungi. The Entoloma is a regular visitor but the Galerina is said to appear after heavy rain, which we had. I also found Sarcoscypha austriaca (Scarlet Elf Cup). You might think this not unusual but it is the first I have seen in Liverpool this year. My usual sites have disappeared under redevelopment schemes. This is what happens in urban areas.\n\nMy green lichenised Ascomycete has progressed. My photos ended up at the Royal Botanical Gardens in Edinburgh where the senior lichenologist identified it as Lecania cyrtella. You expect to find lichens on wood but according to Edinburgh there are several otherwise mainly corticolous lichens that can find their way onto grasses, esp. Bacidina species. They need a keen eye to spot and happenchance of being in the right place at the right time and in decent weather conditions to be able to 'screen' such a habitat. Also, being aware that such a habitat niche can exist!\n\nWhen I find something that I cannot identify, I take photos, note the details, and keep it in a Mystery Folder in case something 'turns up'. In 2017, I visited the green beach at Ainsdale & Birkdale Hills Reserve. The beach is slowly being taken over by land plants and I am interested to see what fungi might appear. In 2017 I found a green Ascomycete on Ammophila (Marram Grass) I could not identify it so into the folder it went. Last week there was an item on the Ascofrance forum about an Ascomycete on marram that looked like mine. It suggested it might be a lichenised species, a Lecania. I informed the NWFG of this progress to discover that another member had found this Ascomycete on marram in Argyll. Still do not know what it is but I am patiently moving forward.\n\nI was due to join a group at Sefton Meadows as it included a lichens expert. But it was cancelled at the last minute. As I had made my sandwiches I decided to wander round my local sites. Surprisingly dry conditions. I found very little and nothing of much interest. When I returned home, I discovered my front lawn had six Agrocybe praecox (Spring Field cap) growing and two more on my rear lawn. Should have just stayed at home.\n\nNorth West Fungus Group AGM at Risley Moss. After selecting committee members and a talk from our president Geoffrey Kibby, we went for the now traditional walk round the Reserve. Not a lot to find but nice to meet up at the start of the year and compare notes. We ended up with 38 species, brackets such as Fomes fomentarius (Hoof Fungus), different Xylaria species and Sarcoscypha coccinea (Scarlet Elf Cup), a guaranteed find at Risley at this time of year. My contribution was a stemmed Ascomycete, Phaeoheliotium subcarneum found on some very rotten wood. Not many records on the National Database.\n\nStill no rain so despite the lovely weather, I did not go foraying. I did not expect to find anything. But you can never tell for on my front lawn was a small fungus. Immediately taken for examination. It is an Agrocybe. But a problem. The spores are the correct size for Agrocybe praecox (Spring Fieldcap) but the cystidia are not swollen and match the description for Agrocybe pediades (Common Fieldcap). I can not be certain what it is.\n\nNow that the weather has warmed up a bit and snowdrops and crocuses are blooming, I took advantage and went for a couple of local walks. The first to Stockton's Wood at Speke, the other to The Eric Hardy Reserve, both in Liverpool. Both woods were very dry, not a puddle in site. Not many fungi in sight either. The few I recorded were either common brackets or resupinates on fallen wood, the exception was two Mycena arcangeliana (Angel Bonnet) hiding under large piece of cut branch. The problem at Stockton's Wood was that there was very little fallen wood of a size I could turn over to examine. It was all large heavy bits of trunk or very long branches. National Trust assure me that they do not tidy it up. Could it be that people take it away for wood burning stoves? The wood is outside the Hall grounds and free to enter. There was a lot of fallen wood in Eric Hardy Reserve but this is a very young wood so not yet very productive. My best find there was Phellinus pomaceus (Cushion Bracket) on one of the many cherry trees.\n\nI did manage to get out for my usual walks on Christmas Eve and Boxing Day. In past years I have done quite well. But this year everywhere was very wet and the few fungi bedraggled and past their best. A few Mycena hiemalis in moss at the base of a tree and a group of Gymnopus fuscopurpureus on bare soil were all I could identify.\n\nAll the best for the New Year and Good Hunting.\n\nI have not been able to catch up on my forays in November. A busy time on my allotment made more difficult by the persistent rain. I managed the odd hour here and there but some of my usual sites were very disappointing and not worth the visit. I shall report the highlights.\n\nI did get to Rimrose Valley again on the 6th, as assistant to a friend who was taking a public foray. This new woodland and it was wet so 62 species was good. It included an uncommon Hemimycena hirsuta. The best find of Schizophyllum amplum (Poplar Bells) went to a small girl who was very proud when told.\n\nMy next sighting was of dozens of Tricholoma scalpturatum (Yellowing Knight) on woodchip at an Aldi car park. Followed by a crowd of Clitocybe amarescens on rotted manure on a allotment. This species is a relative newcomer to the UK from Europe.\n\nMy next outing was on the 13th with North West Fungus Group to Ainsdale where the recorded total was 125 species. I was part of a splinter group who searched the dune grassland. Lots of finds but the only one of interest was Neottiella rutilans, a short turf specialist.\n\nThe 19th, a beautiful day, found me at Freshfield Dune Heath They have been removing large areas of gorse, leaving large areas of bare sand. These have been colonised by masses of Aleuria aurantia (Orange Peel). Amazing sight. I crossed over to Fisherman's Path for my lunch in the pinewood. Within arms reach of my pine stump seat, I recorded Strobilurus tenacellus (Pinecone Cap), Baeospora myosura (Conifercone Cap) and Auriscalpum vulgare (Earpick Fungi) on buried cones. I have never seen them all together before.\n\nTwo late visits to Stockton's Wood and Hale woods were disappointing and a visit to Calderstones Park on the 30th produced nothing until I spotted a swarm of tiny fungi on a dead tree. I thought a slime mould but research came up with Phleogena faginea (Fenugreek Stalkball). So called because of the smell of fenugrfeek or curry. New to me. It is now well below freezing outside so could be the end for this year.\n\nIt had been raining for a couple of days so I went to Speke Hall before the grass mowers started on the large lawn in front of the Hall. I was not disappointed as there were lots of waxcaps and other grassland fungi, a bit rain bedraggled but unmown. I identified six waxcaps and lots of common grassland fungi. A good find was of Galerina clavata in large numbers. This uncommon large spored species grows after heavy rain on old lawns so qualified on both criteria. A better find was of Gymnopus imudicus in the patch of heather that National Trust has grown in the middle of the lawn. Another pleasing fact was that Ramaria decurren (Ochre Coral) that I first identified in 2017 is still growing under the same ornamental Yew bush.\n\nMereseyside Biobank invited me to take a look at some ancient woodland in an area known as Howard, Pits, adjoining the M57 motorway. It was bit muddy along the path between fields to the wood. Despite some mature oaks, I found not a thing. Perhaps too late. However, the adjoining wood of young birch and willow trees, growing on an abandoned field, produced a number of species but nothing of any note. Very disappointing.\n\nI called into Court Hey Park, Roby to meet with my colleague who manages Merseyside Biobank. He usually suggests a site I should look at and report any finds. I had a qick look round while I was there. The only fungi I found was a group of Agaricus altipes under some Rhododendron. An uncommon member of the Agaricus, noticeable by it's height, the stipe being 14cms.\n\nThis morning I had a tyre puncture so had to get a new one fitted. My tyre fitter is on the road to Speke Hall. Opposite his garage is a piece of wast ground which is usually fenced off. Until the local people make a hole in the fence because it is the only way to walk from the housing estates to the River Mersey. So I took advantage while I was waiting. In an area of scrub were hundreds of Lepista flaccida (Tawny Funnel Cap), Hebeloma sacchariolens (Sweeet Poison Pie) and a large number of Helvella Lacunosa (Elfin Saddle). Sadly no time to look further.\n\nI went to Croxteth Hall, Liverpool, a large estate with plenty of old woodland. It was difficult to search because loads of leaves had fallen and the sun was extra bright. In the first half hour, I collected only two species. I went into Mull Wood and the scene changed. Loads of fungi. I recorded forty species. Highlights were Clitocybe geotropa (Trooping Funnelcap), the tiny Mycena capillaris (Beechleaf Fungus) and one Pluteus aurantiorugosus, a bit battered but recognisable. Also Tomentella sublilacina, a crust fungus which I thought would be an Oak Crust. Good job I always check spores on these crusts. Tomentella spores are very spiny. I walked a bit further along the path and had lunch where I added a couple more. Off I went again but in the next one hour I found one Honey Fungus. I gave up and went home.\n\nI joined Merseyside Naturalists at Lunt Meadows Nature Reserve, my last visit being ten years ago. The Reserve is wetlands and acts as the River Alt flood storage basin, a different ecology from my usual forays. I did not expect a lot of fungi. My first find was of an ink cap that I knew was unusual and I identified it as Coprinellis hiascens. Along the raised river bank we found Lepista saeve (Field Blewit) and Volvariells gloiocephala (Stubble Rosegill). The alder woods were a disappointment. I expected more after ten years. The only Alder fungi I found was a small patch of Naucoria escharioides (Ochre Aldercap). The birding was good. Peregrine, Marsh Harriers and someone disturbed about 500 Pink Footed Geese in a carrot feld. They all went up together. A sight to behold.\n\nActing on a tip off from a good friend, I went to Speke Hall.The target was a troop of Amanita phalloides (Death Cap). My friend had counted 86 but I think they had started to get old by the time I got there. I go to Speke Hall quite often being a NT member but I never think of going to this part of the estate. There were also numerous Lactarius pyrogalus (Fiery Milkcap). I tasted one but it was not as hot as I expected. More Laccaria proxima (Scurfy Deceiver) in the car park. It must be the year for this species.\n\nToday I led a foray for members of my golf club. At last they are taking an interest in the natural world in which they play. Because of the danger from badly hit golf balls, our foray was limited to the areas by the car park and practice ground. In one hour we managed to find 35 species. Laccaria proxima (Scurfy Deceiver), with its very scurfy cap was more abundant than the smaller Deceiver. Chalciporus piperatus (Peppery Bolete) was found under some birch. Then someone spotted a nice squat Bolet. What is that I was asked. Mine, I replied. I very nice Boletus edulis (Cep) into my bag. I was leader after all. The last collection was Agaricus urinascens (Macro Mushroom) with lots of squamules at the bottom of the stem. I took it home to confirm the identification. Very nice it was too.\n\nI joined Merseyside Naturalists on a foray at Dibbinsdale Nature Reserve, one of my favourite sites. Noticeable was the abundance of Bulgaria inquinans (Black Bulgar) on dead wood. It was everywhere. A good selection of all types of fungi. The star of the day was Pluteus aurantiorugosus. No English name because it is a rarity. Not in the best condition but clearly identifiable.\n\nA wander round local parks today. I have seen lots of the Lepiota family recently, especially Echinoderma asperum (Freckled Dapperling). Other notable finds were Pluteus salicinus (Willow Shield) and a couple of Agaricus augustus (The Prince) in their usual site by a pine tree.\n\nStarting to get busy. A walk up the old lane alongside Allerton priory. I wanted to take a photograph of Clitocybe giganreus that I saw last week. It had totally collapsed. I did find lots of Oudemansiella mucida (Porcelain Fungus) on the fallen beech trees. Not a species I find very often in south Liverpool.\n\nNational Fungus Weekend. I joined Liverpool Botanical Society. I collected and identified the fungi for the botanists while my colleague from Liverpool Museum did the same for flowers, trees, lichens and everything else. We surveyed Rimrose Valley Country Park. This is under threat from a new road between the container port and the motorways to take heavy goods. Lots of local objections. It is new woodland much of it being created from a refuse tip. Hardly any microrrhizal fungi, no Amanitas, Russulas. Mycena filopes (Iodine Bonnet) was the only Mycena we found. Hundreds of Inocybe geophylla both white and lilac throughout. Lots of Lyophyllum decastes (Clustered Domecap), some large Lactarius controversus (Blushing Milkcap) and fuliginosus (Sooty Milkcap). Lots of microfungi, some of which were lichenenicolous. I let my Museum colleague identify those as I did not have a clue about them.\n\nI went for a quick look at a local park, Allerton Tower, to see if local fungal numbers are as good as Sunday at Moore. There is a small area with a Monkey Puzzle tree, Cupressus and Sweet Chestnut which is usually very good and so it was. Twenty-five species in just an hour. Lots of Hygrocybe ceracea (Butter Waxcap), Russula farinipes and praetiversa, Inocybe fuscidula (Darkish Fibrecap), Gymnopus fuscopurpureus and Cortinarius hinnuleus (Earthy Webcap) which smells very strongly of gas.\n\nNorth West Fungus group Beginners Foray at Moore Nature Reserve, Warrington. Good weather. Eager novices. Plenty of fungi - mostly standard fare which is what you want for beginners. Lots of Amanita muscaria (Fly Agaric), Paxillus involutus (Brown Rollrim), a good selection of Mycenas (Bonnets), Russula, Lactarius and Boletes including Boletus edulis (Cep) which I managed to snaffle. I took a lot home for microscopic examination. I have to confess I got a couple wrong on the day but I was close enough for a beginners foray. My best was Tomentella pilosa, a cobwebby resupinate under a rotten log. Difficult to get a decent specimen without bits of wood breaking the cover slips. I managed to spot the spiny spores which is the giveaway clue. No photos from reserve as I was too busy passing on my knowledge.\n\nAfter a morning of allotment digging, I went for a walk to unwind my muscles. Calderstones Park and my favourite shrubbery did not disappoint. My first find in the middle of a nettle patch was of a good number of Collybia cirrhata (Piggybank Shanklet). It grows on mummified fungi but I did not risk being stung to delve further. It has always been a good place for Lepiota species. Lots of expected Lepiota cristata (Stinking Dapperling) and also Echinoderma asperum (Freckled Dapperling) and Echinoderma jacobi although the latter can be confused with other species. I gave up on another collection. Another difficult identification was of Ramaria curta (Ochre Coral) which also has a lookalike and the microscopy is not very clear either.\n\nI attended the North West Fungus Group foray at Stanley Bank Woods, St. Helens. I have been before but the foray leader took me to parts I had not been to on past visits. Plenty of fungi about. The beechwood gave us Boletus edulis (Penny Bun), Kuehneromyces mutabilis (Sheathed Woodtuft), Caloboletus radicans (Rooting Bolete) and the usual collection of Mycenas (Bonnets), Inkcaps and brown jobs. At home I spent some time getting to grips with a couple of Xerocomus species and eventually decided on porosporus (Sepia Bolete) and chrysenteron (Red Cracking Bolete). My best contribution was identifying one I had never identified before. A whitish resupinate under a log turned out to be Goiothele lactescens. The final list will appear on the NWFG website when all the results are in.\n\nToday I visited Hightown on the Sefton coast hoping to find something on the dunes. A walk along the Sefton Coastal Path was more like an army survival course. It was very overgrown as the residents tend to take the route along the beach. Most of my finds were of rusts and mildews on very different plants from my local finds at home. Some higher fungi turned up. Agrocybe molesta (Bearded Fieldcao), Psathyrella potteri and a couple of Agaricus campestris (Field Mushroom). I had not been to this area before and had expected some dune grassland but the vegetation was thick throughout. The dunes are all frontal and it had been windy so no sign of any fungi. It was a lovely walk back along the beach watching hundreds of pink foot geese flying north and hearing the curlews across the bay.\n\nI visited one of my pet sites at Hale woods. I have never seen it so dry. The small brook and one of the ornamental ponds had dried up. Usually the area floods and wellingtons are required. After two hours the count was a few Psathyrella microrhiza, one Gymnopus dryophilus and a very nice Pluteus plautus hidden on the underside of a fallen branch. We are promised a week of rain, but there will have to be a lot of it to improve the lack of fungi.\n\nAfter three nights of thunder storms I went for a walk in the hope that some fungi might have shown up. I tried one of my favourite Liverpool sites but after an hour had only one specimen. But an interesting one. Gymnopus fuscopurpureus. It is probably a alien species. According to the British Checklist, it grows with broadleaf trees. My recent finds have ben under conifer. I sent one from last year to Kew for DNA sequencing. No result yet but Kew believes there are a number of different species. This one will also be dried to await sequencing.\n\nStill no rain in Liverpool. I went for a short walk round Stockton's Wood this morning. Very dry with the leaves crackling under foot. No fungi on the ground at all. I did find a nice Fistulina hepatica (Beefsteak Fungus) and a Laetiporus sulphureus (Chicken of the Woods). But that was all. It might rain at the weekend or so they say.\n\nAs it had rained for a couple of days, I did the rounds of my local parks. A good start with some nice Agaricus arvensis (Horse Mushroom) and Gymnopilus peronatus (Wood Woollyfoot) at the crematorium, A few common species in the adjoining park including Hyphoderma setigerum on fallen wood. Interstingly this piece of wood also supported the ascomycete, Tapesia fusca which was growing through the corticiod. On a fallen tree I noted a crustlike pink cushion. This was Hypocrea rufa, identified by the ostioles that make it look like a pepperpot. I then went to Speke Hall but did not find anything and it was so full of people that I called it a day.\n\nI visited Speke Hall before a promised heatwave arrived. Back to pulling dead stems and checking on mildews and rusts. I picked a good selection of leaves and even knew what the plants were. Another collection of Flagelloscypha minutissima, this time on the usual host of broadleaf twigs. In a gloomy part of the woods I turned over a large rotten log and noticed two very tiny specimens, only 5mm, which I collected. When I looked at them under a microscope, I was surprised to see that they are Entolomas (Pinkgills). My literature does not take me further than Entoloma byssisedum or parasticum. A colleague sent my research to Machiel Noordeloos, the expert on this Genus. He is currenty researching these tiny species and that there may be up to fifteen different species. Therefore he could not help me. Nothing more I can do.\n\nMore rain. Another visit, this time to the woods at Hale. At last a fungus with gills even if it is only Coprinellus micaceus (Glistening Inkcap). Back to dead stems. A lot of tall plants grow along the line of a ditch. One of the picked stems of hogweed (or teasel) was very thick at almost 2cms, and solid like a wooden stick. Back home I dentified Flagelloscypha minutissima, one of the very tiny Basidiomycetes. As it is unusual to find this on a herbaceous stem, I checked some specimens further down the stem. They identified as Lachnella villosa. The hairs are different, one long and pointed, the latter blunt and rounded. I checked my first stem area again and confirmed the Flagelloscypha. It appears that both species can grow on the same substrate. Not something I expected but not uncommon for other species.\n\nAfter a few healthy rain showers I went to one of my local parks to see if anything had been encouraged to grow. Nothing. Back to looking at dead stems. I found one Ascomycete I had not seen before despite the books saying it is common, Crocicreas coronatum. Next, I found a patch of tallish blue flowers. I am a vegetable person and it took me most of a day to identify them as Anemone coronaria. The leaves had a rust on them that I identified as Tranzschelia discolor, another new one.\n\nI went back to Clock Face Country Park for anoter specimen of the rust growing on Carex otrubae (False Fox Sedge Grass). Fortunately I rembered where it was. Having examined it under a microscope I identified it as Puccinia caricina. A common rust fungus but as the host is not, it is of interest.\n\nI joined Liverpool Botanical Society at Clock Face Colliery Country Park near St. Helens. Still very dry but lots of standard Ascomycetes on dead stems and an number of rusts on Field Rose, Hawthorn and Southern Marsh Orchid. One interesting rust was on Carex otrubae (False Fox Sedge Grass) I have not yet identified it as the sedge is not mentioned in any of my literature. I enlisted the help of a rust expert but her advice was not conclusive so I will have to go back for some more. I did find Hygrocybe conica (Blackening Waxcap) only one. Coincidentally, a colleague found one on the same day at a Colliers Moss, another country park a couple of miles away. We both found Bee Orchids.\n\nThere is a small field near to home which I believe was formerly a refuse tip. It has been allowed to run wild and I describe it as Tall Ruderal. All plants are at least knee high, nettles, thistle, dock, knapweed, hogweed and large clumps of Deschampsia grass. Very good for dead stems and I visit it a couple of times a year to see what is growing on them. I found ten discomycetes including Brunnipila palearum, Pyrenopeziza chailletti, Belonidium mollisimum, Mollisia clavata and a few spots and pimples, some of which are new to me. Also Lachnella villosa which looks like Lachnum virgineum but is a Basidiomycete. I always check for asci to make sure. It does not have any. I am not sure how long this field will remain as it is because it has been decided to make it The George Harrison Memorial Wood. A pity as there are very few areas like this in south Liverpool.\n\nI fancied a day out so caught the train to Freshfield Dune Heath Reserve. It looked as if it had been hit by a bomb. They are removing the gorse and lots of trees. The result is large patches of bare sand in some places. A lot of the most fruitful fungus areas have been destroyed. There were still some fungi about. Gymnopus dryophilus in the moss, Conocybe apala on a bonfire site and Mollisia obscura on a dead heather stem. I then went into the adjoining Ainsdale Sand Dunes Reserve. It was very overgrown and a few of my short cuts had disappeared, including to the area where morels grow. I know that they are trying to take the area back to a dune system but this seemed to have reversed in some places. I did spot Auriscalpium vulgare on a buried pine cone and a few microfungi but disappointing overall.\n\nA nice afternoon. I went for a walk round Calderstones Park in Liverpool to see if anything had started fruiting. All I found was a single crust fungus, Cylindrobasidium laeve (Tear Dropper). I need the exercise but had to run when it suddenly started to rain.\n\nA wander around the Eric Hardy Reserve. For once it was completely dry. A bad sign as it is usually very muddy. A nice walk but it was when I climbed to the upper level that I came across a large patch of fungi that I thought were ageing St. Georges Mushrooms. I was wrong. They were Entoloma clypeatum (Shield Pinkgill). But that was all folks.\n\nI hoped that after a couple of days of rain it would be a good idea to visit the Formby dunes to look for fungi. Wrong. After two hours of search I located a few Agrocybe pediades (Common Fieldcap) and two Conocybe apala (Milky Conecap). My day was saved at the very end when I came across a sandy bank full of Tulostoma brumale (Winter Stalkball). Having returned home early, I went to my allotment to find a group of Conocybe rickenii growing on bare soil with my coriander. This species likes nutrient rich soil. When I got home, my wife handed me a couple of Entoloma sericium (Silky Pinkgill) that she saved while mowing the lawn. I may as well have stayed at home.\n\nI joined the Liverpool Botanists on a visit to Sankey Valley in St. Helens. An area of canals and streams, a wet site. It was \"wettish\" but this did not persuade many fungi it was time to show themselves. We did find Calocybe gambosa (St. Georges Mushroom) but only one. A lone Inocybe rimosa (Split Fibrecap) an early summer species and a couple of mini Bonnets under a log. A very nice show of Phellinus igniarius (Willow Bracket) one of the hoof fungi on fallen trees. I benefit joining the botanists because they identify the plants for me (I am getting better at it) and I can identify the plant fungi accurately. Interesting rust on the Ramson leaves was Melampsora allii-fragilis which is much less common that the usual Ramson rust. It is one of the rust species that have two hosts, the other being Willow which was everywhere in these woods.\n\nI have not been out much due to the weather. Cold and dry is not the weather that encourage fungi to grow. I visited a couple of local sites last week and found nothing. The only species on Saturday from Speke Hall was the tiny Resupinatus applicatus (Smoked Oysterling) and only a couple. Not much better on Saturday when I went out with Liverpool Botanical Society to Croxteth Hall. The only gilled fungi were both together on a lawn. Panaeolus fimicola (Turf Mottlegill) and Galerina clavata (Ribbed Bell). Let us hope for a bit of wet and warm soon.\n\nI have managed to go for a few walks in between the rain storms. But all I have found is mud. Until today. I finished up at the local crematorium gardens, It was mostly cordoned off because of all the trees that have blown down. Along one boundary a good 100 yards of mature Cupressus has been demolished like a pack of cards together with five mature broadleaf trees. Quite a mess. There is a cherry tree that died last year but did remain standing. I am interested to see what will grow on it. It was finished off by Armillaria (Honey Fungus). It now supports a large growth of Trametes versicolor (Turkeytail) and some Daldinia concentrica (King Alfreds Cakes) one that I have not seen on a cherry tree before. On another dead cherry I identified Phellinus pomaceus (Cushion Bracket). Lots of Scurfy Twiglets but nothing else.\n\nI visited Stockton's Wood, part of Speke Hall grounds. A strange wood. I have found some rarities over the years but it is very unreliable. For a couple of weeks per year it is marvellous. For the rest of the year, nothing. Today was nothing. A nice walk in the woods on a sunny day. Except for a tiny white specimen on the end of a fallen branch. I thought it was a discomycete, Under the microscope it proved to be a basidiomycete, Flagelloscypha minutissima. This is a species that often grows high up in a tree. Recent gales have felled a lot of mature trees in this wood which may explain my find. It is identified by the shape of the hairs. It is so small, I did not know it was hairy until I looked at it under a microscope.\n\nA walk round a local park. Nothing much to see. A lone Galerina clavata (Ribbed Bell) on the lawn, the second one I have found recently. I collected what looked like a white crust fungus but got no information from it. But I did notice some small black round Ascomycetes on the same piece of wood. These were Chaetosphaeria pulviscula. Meanwhile, back at home, I found a group of Peziza varia (Layered Cup) hiding behind my compost bin.\n\nAnother nice day so I took advantage to go for a bit of exercise, this time my local golf course. It is being redeveloped and they are dumping rubbish everywhere. Most of my favourite spots are unrecognisable. On to the next site, Allerton Tower, a local park. Nothing until I noticed a promising fallen branch. It was under a holly bush. When I moved it to look underneath I noticed a tiny fungus. Closer examination revealed that it was Marasmius hudsonii (Holly Parachute). This the second time I have found it this month. It is rare but favours the west coast. It is very small and this is not the most promising time to look for fungi. In some moss, I found a single Galerina clavata (Ribbed Bell). This was difficult to identify. It took five attempts before I found the necessary microscopic features. Perhaps affected by the time of year and weather.\n\nLovely weather. A trip to my favourite woods at Hale that I had not visited since the gales before Christmas. It is usually very, very muddy but it has not rained for over a week. Paths were good but not much in the way of fungi. Mainly looking under logs and there were fungi to be recorded. Nothing unusual but microscopy was necessary as the crust fungi were white. I identified Brevicellicium olivascens and Postia tephroleuca (Greyling Bracket) from their spores. Only one gilled fungus, a lone Mycena filopes (Iodine Bonnet). Disappointing.\n\nNice day. I walked up to Calderstones Park, one of the main parks in Liverpool. I have not visited for a long time because it gets so busy. I was surprised by the number of trees that had been blown down in the gales, one stand of three conifers was totally decimated. My favourite shrubbery had also suffered, looking a bit bare. Liverpool Council were busy making woodchip. My favourite derelict tree, Polylepis australis from South America, had been removed. I was looking forward to see what would grow on it. Not to be disappointed I found Stereum hirsutum (Hairy Curtain Crust) and Byssomerulius corium (Netted Crust) on the adjacent Zanthoxylum (Sichuan Pepper Tree) so not all is lost. Only other species of interest was Sarcomyxa serotina (Olive Oysterling).\n\nFamily visits, poor weather and the need to prepare my allotment prevented me from doing much foraying since Christmas. I have managed to get out for a bit of exercise round local parks but even that was difficult as everywhere is so wet and muddy. All the expected species were present such as Flammulina velutipes (Velvet Shank), and Clitocybe nebularis (Clouded Agaric). Species of more interest were all tiny, hidden on small twigs and leaves. Marasmius hudsonii (Holly Parachute) growing from dead leaves has very unique spiky cap and is hard to find due to its size. Mycena capillaris (Beechleaf Bonnet) grows from the leaf petioles of dead leaves. Mycena hiemalis (Winter Bonnet) grows in large numbers on the moss round the base of large trees. Baeospora myosura (Conifercone Cap) was seen on litter from Cedar. There are still fungi about but they take a bit of finding.\n\nI needed a post Christmas walk so went to the Eric Hardy Nature Reserve. I kept to the upper section but after the rain it was also a sea of mud and difficult to negotiate. I hoped to find crust fungi but there was not much under the piles of fallen wood. However there were a lot of small basidiomycetes around in the litter. Clitocybe nebularis and Mycena filopes recorded as expected. In the drifts of beech leaves I found Mycena capillaris and Mycena polygramma. Best by far was a holly leaf on which was growing Marasmius hudsonii with its spiky cap. I have only seen this once before, at Dibbinsdale on the Wirral. But it is very small and hard to find under all the dead leaves.\n\nSuccess. A morning visit to Stockton's Wood beside Speke Hall. Lots of old stumps. I found my Xylaria hypoxylon (Candlesnuff). I managed to get a decent photograph. Unfortunately, the good collections of specimens were all under the dead wood so too difficult to get a decent picture. My article is now complete and submitted for publication. I found only one other fungus, a Mycena. In view of the weather, I expected to find more. Very disappointing.\n\nI am writing an article about winter fungi for a local organisation. It includes photographs of the selected species. I need a photo of Xylaria hypoxylon (Candlesnff) as I do not have one in my collection. It is so common anyway. Until I went to look for some. I spent two hours in all the places where I was certain they would be growing. I found only one miserable specimen. If it does not rain, I shall try again tomorrow. There were masses of Flammulina velutipes (Velvet Shank) particularly on dead trees in the very wet areas. I did not see much else as it was so cold my eyes kept watering.\n\nAfter the storms and continuous rain, this was the first time I had a chance to look round for a couple of weeks. I had a wander through a couple of local parks. More trees down which have been cut up. As long as the Council does not move of burn them that should be source for future fungi. The usual species for this time of year, Clitocytbe nebularis (Clouded Agaric), Lepista sordida (Sordid Blewit), a nice Pleurotus dryinus (Veiled Oyster) growing in a crack on a fallen tree. Best find was of Hemimycena lactea (Milky Bonnet) growing underneath a large Thuja tree which must have protected them from the bad weather.\n\nNot much recent rainfall so I decided to risk the lower level of The Eric Hardy Nature Reserve. There is a stream that flows through which is prone to flood at the slightest excuse. The paths are usually very muddy, often impassable. But it produces some interesting fungi as there is a lot of dead and fallen wood. I found Inocybe geophylla var. lilacina (Lilac Fibrecap), Mycena rorida (Dripping Bonnet) and the uncommon Entoloma minutum that looks like a very small version of Silky Pinkgill. The damp soil conditions are perfect for this species. Then I crossed the stream which was a grave error as the mud came up to my ankles. Should have worn my wellies.\n\nIn my last posting, I reported I had identified the earthtongue Glutinoglossum glutinosum. I was wrong. During the course of further study of some more recent literature, I had another look at my specimen. I have concluded that it is Geoglossum umbratile although the identifying features are not a lot different from glutinosum. Only a couple of points in it. As there are more growing on the lawn, I took a fresh specimen for another look. It turns out to be different. Geoglossum fallax. Much longer spores. There are still a few more left so I may get another species before they are done.\n\nI happened to look at my next door neighbours' front lawn and noticed some fungi. I therefore picked them before they came home. Mycena flavoalba (Ivory Bonnet), although I think it may have changed name to an Atheniella, Clavulinopsis corniculata (Meadow Coral), Galerina vittiformis (Hairy Leg Bell) and a Geoglossum glutinosum (Glutinous Earthtongue). Not bad. I shall wait until they go out tomorrow and sneak into their back garden to see what else is growing.\n\nI made an early start to beat the dog walkers to my favourite woods at Hale Hall. The fungi were standard for the time of year, Mycena inclinata (Clustered Bonnet) on fallen oak, a nice Pleurotus dryinus (Veiled Oyster) in a hole on a living tree. Three tiny Mycenas attracted my attention, minute would be a better description. They all had to be taken home to look a them under a microscope. One was Marasmius setosus (a Parachute) growing on a leaf petiole but the other two were on a twig, so different. They turned out to be Mycena tenerrima (Frosted Bonnet). I then spotted a tiny oysterling type fungus when I was examining a fallen tree. It looked like Resupinatus but had brown gills. I took it home thinking it would be a Crepicdotus or a Melanotus. But the spores and cystidia, flexuose with round heads, were wrong. After much research I found Simocybe haustellaris, a new one for me. I had to check the cap cystidia which were the same as for the gills which confirmed the identification. This is why these are my favourite woods.\n\nNo longer any need to book in advance so I went to Speke Hall to look for waxcaps on the large North Lawn in front of the hall. It is a very good site for grassland fungi. There were lots of fruit bodies but unfortunately the lawnmowers got there first and squashed a lot of them. Not a bad list of waxcaps. My finds include virginea (Ivory) irrigatus (Slimy), psittacinus (Parrot), pratensis (Meadow) and insipida (Spangle). I expected to find other species but there were only a few squashed Lycoperdon utriforme (Mosaid Puffball) and hundreds of Clavulinopsis helvola (Yellow Club). Away from the lawn I came across a patch of Tricholoma ustale (Burnt Knight) under a beech tree.\n\nHaving found a number of interesting species at my local cemetery, which covers a huge area in south Liverpool and was opened in the late 19th century, I decided to take a look at the older Aintree Cemetery, a place I have never been to. It is another huge area in central Liverpool. Very interesting with catacombs and massive funerary statues and stones. Despite the age of some of the areas and the acres of grass, the fungus species count was very disappointing, only sixteen. Most of my finds were under the same pine tree by one of the catacombs. Russula delica (Milk White Brittlegill), Lactarius deterrimus (False Saffron Milkcap) and Mycena flavoalba (Ivory Bonnet).\n\nAfter over an hour of digging on my allotment, I went for a short walk to unwind my muscles so as not to seize up when I got home. The local golf course is just across the road and I have not been for some time because they are busy with a massive redevelopment of the course and buildings. There are diggers and lorries everywhere. I still found a few fungi. Russula delica (Milk White Brittlegill), Melanoleuca grammopodia (Grooved Cavalier) and two Inocybes (Fibrecaps) that I managed to identify, sindonia (Beige) and cincinnata (Collared). Also Tricholma terreum (Grey Knight) under some pine trees. Sadly, quite a few of my 'good spots' have been ruined where they have dumped soil and rubbish in the woods. A large part of the area has been dug up and covered with mounds of topsoil. I have no access anyway so I will have to strike this site off my list for the time being.\n\nI took a friend with me to one of my better sites at The Crematorium Garden of Remembrance. He is a photographer. I was not sure if we would find much as it had poured with rain for over 24 hours and places were flooded. It turned out to be a good day as the Council had been unable to mow the lawns and the fungi enjoyed the respite. A lot more fruitbodies than when I went the week before. Additions to that list include Tricholoma scalpturatum (Yellowing Knight), Gymnopus brassicolens (Cabbage Parachute) and Helvella elastica (Elastic Saddle). I also have a mystery, a yellow Entoloma of which there are very few. There is one that seems to fit the physical and microscopic features but is said to be easily identified because it smells strongly like pear drops. I can not smell anything on mine. I shall have to ask my mycological family for assistance on this one.\n\nA break in the rain. I decided to take a quick visit to the 13th century All Saints Church in Liverpool. The mossy graves and grass surrounding the church are always maintained and a good spot for waxcaps and other small grass lovers. A bit disappointing as the only waxcaps were virgineus, ceracea and reidii, all fairly common. A few Golden Spindles and Geoglossum fallax and that was it. Then it rained again.\n\nI paid a short early morning visit to Calderstones Park as it gets too busy later especially as it is half term. I only had time to visit my favourite ornamental shrubbery and was not disappointed. First find were two excellent Echinoderma aspera (Freckled Dapperling). Then a mass of Ramaria curta, one of the lesser known Coral fungi. Thus was followed by Pluteus nanus (Dwarf Shield) and, new to me, Cystolepiota bucknallii (Lilac Dapperling). The only thing lilac on my specimens were the stems. The giveaway is a very, very strong smell of coal gas. Then I found a very dry orange resupinate fungus on a dead tree. I identified it on the spot as a Peniophora. But when I checked it at home, having kept it in a damp box, it had a wrinkled skin and the spores were wrong. After much research, I identified it as Hymenochaete cinnamomea, which is not a common species.\n\nI have been taking people out on forays and finding difficult species so I am now having to catch up on my reporting. A visit to Springwood Crematorium after heavy rain produced twenty specimens that included Lepiota ochraceofulva, Gymnopus fuscopurpureus, Russula nobilis (Beechwood Sickener) and Cortinarius talus (Honey Webcap). Yes, it did smell of honey. Then I made the error of crossing the road into Allerton Cemetery. Just for a look round the older parts. Another twenty to add my box. Lots of fruitbodies but as this is a huge area there is a lot of walking involved. Mainly grassland species but I found a nice group of Tricholoma sulphureum under some trees. Someone reported to Merseyside Biobank of finding eight different waxcaps on the site. I only found one but must go back if time allows.\n\nReturning from my allotment along the grass path to the exit I came across a number of small Bonnet fungi. Brown edged gills told me they are Mycena olivaceomarginata (Brownedge Bonnet). They have been growing regularly in the same small patch but nowhere else on the paths since 2009. Another regular is Tubaria dispersa (Hawthorn Twiglet), except mine flourish under a Cotoneaster that grows over the boundary fence from the neighbouring garden and have been doing so since 2002. Only five today. They grow from buried berries. They clearly like red.\n\nThis morning I went to my local waste disposal centre to get rid of some broken electrical items. The centre is opposite Otterspool Promenade, an area of grassland and shrubberies that extends for about two and a half miles along the River Mersey. Although fairly new, a lot of fungi grow in the grass and in wood chips around the trees and bushes. As it had stopped raining, I took a short stroll and noted a number of fungi, mainly Agrocybe praecox (Spring Fieldcap) along the grass verges. One in a shrubbery caught my eye and when I picked it up, it immediately bruised bright red, although by the time I got it home it had turned almost black. It is Leucoagaricus badhamii (Blushing Dapperling). Must return as soon as possible to see what else has grown.\n\nForay number two, this time with North West Fungus Group at Ainsdale Sand Dunes Reserve. There were lots of fungi and lots of forayers. Although we did not travel far from our starting point a growing and interesting collection was made. From round the small lake we found Hypholoma mysotis (Olive Brownie) which has a very long stem, Cortinarius uliginosus (Marsh Webcap). Along the path were lots of Lyophyllum connatum (White Domecap). In the oak wood was a variety of species including Helvella elastica (Elastic Saddle) and Boletus edulis (Cep). Most exciting was the rediscovery of the very rare Stereopsis reidii still in the same place as two years ago.\n\nFirst foray of a busy weekend. I joined the Liverpool Botanists at Dibbinsdale. Not a large quantity of fungi about. Some of the favourite spots were bare of any of the usual specimens. Part of the problem is that more people are using the woodland so a lot of disturbance. Nevertheless by working hard we found quite a few and it ended as a successful day out. Our finds included Leotia lubrica (Jelly Babies), Kuehneromyces mutablis (Sheather Woodtuft), Cortiarius albobiolaceus (Pearly Webcap) and Scleroderma verrucosum (Scaly Earthball).\n\nSome friends wanted some sloes to make sloe gin. Knowing of a thicket of blackthorn, I went to see if there was any fruit. There was. Sloe gin is now under production. I had a look round for fungi and managed to find Lactarius blennius (Beech Milkcap), a couple of Gymnopus confluens (Clustered Toughshank) and Gymnopilus sapineus (Scaly Rustgill). The last one is difficult to identify as it is separated from more common species by the size of the hyphae in the cap. A microscope is essential.\n\nI visited some friends and afterwards popped into the nearby small Black Wood before I went home. It was very dry despite the recent rain. A couple of common Mycenas (Bonnets). The only find of interest was of Heterobasidion annosum (Root Rot) growing on fallen birch. Usually a coniferous species, I have found it on birch on a few other sites. I do not know of any conifers in this wood.\n\nBack to normal. Back to the allotment. Some fellow allotmenteers directed me to their site which has wood chip paths. The paths were covered with Parasola conopilea (Conical Brittlestem). It looks like other brown species but this one has hairs in the cap that can be seen with a decent hand lens. Tiny whiskers. Also on the paths were Marasmius oreades (Fairy Ring Champignon) and Lacrymaria lacrymabunda (Weeping Widow), the latter growing out of a gravel path.\n\nI went to Scotland for a week to play on the steam trains running to Mallaig and Oban. It was a little damp but it was the first rain they had seen for weeks. I looked for fungi on my walks but nothing to be seen. Until we went to Mull and visited Duart Castle which sits on a rocky outcrop over the sea. One lonely pine tree stood beside the castle walls. It was surrounded by fungi. Cupophyllus virgineus (Snowy Waxcap) and Hygrocybe ceracea (Butter Waxcap), an Entoloma (Pinkgill) some Panaeolus (Mottlegill) and a couple of Lactarius (Milkcaps) with orange gills. I suspect deterrimus (False Saffron Milkcap) because of the green tints in the caps but the gills were too dry to extract any milk to be able to confirm.\n\nStill no rain to speak of. I took a quick walk on my local golf course. An old bridleway runs along one side. To stop scrambler and quad bikes trespassing on the course, the club has built a barrier by piling soil on top of fallen trees and branches. A good spot for fungi. Today there was a circle of huge Leucopaxillus giganteus (Giant Funnel), the second local site this month. Beside them were dozens of a small whitish fungus. I thought they would be Lepiota cristata but when I picked one my finger was powdered white. Cystolepiota seminuda (Bearded Dapperling). Stinking Lepiota was also there. Much larger than I have seen before. My only other find was one tiny Rickenella fibula (Orange Mosscap) growing on my lawn.\n\nAfter recent rain I thought it would be a good time to have a wander around some of my usual sites. Everybody is posting photographs of finds on Facebook. I wandered far and wide, turned over every log, poked about in the nettles and brambles. My reward was zilch. I did not find one specimen of anything. Still very dry but I thought something would turn up.\n\nI joined Liverpool Botanical Society on a visit to North Wirral Coastal Park starting at Leasowe Lighthouse. It is dune heathland. It was very dry. I found only one gilled fungus all day, a small group of dried up Marasmius oreades (Fairy Ring Campignon). I did return home with a reasonable collection of rusts and mildews. Perfect weather for them. The reason why I join the botanists is that I have no idea what most of the plants are. So, they identify and record the plants and I can then find the relevant fungus in my books. The botanists are also interested in my records as these parasites affect the plants. Everyone is happy.\n\nI went out to look for elderberries for wine. My usual path was blocked by a fallen tree. They were not ready anyway. I wandered down to the stream, now dry, in the Eric Hardy Reserve. Lots of soggy wood and lots of Polylyporus squamosus (Dryads Saddle). I was surprised to find two Oudmansiella mucida (Porcelain Fungus) not often seen in this area. Then I met a man and his dog who I bump into from time to time. He gives me information about any fungi he sees. This time it was about a group of large specimens in a blackthorn thicket in another park. Off I went on my mission and found them immediately. A large group of Leucopaxillus giganteus (Giant Funnel). I managed to get the photograph but it was quite a thorny fight to get near. This group appeared in this same spot in 2018 so nice to know they have returned.\n\nA visit to Halewood Triangle Country Park. Until the 1970s it was a major railway complex serving Liverpool Docks. Despite its youth, it produces interesting fungi. My collection included Lactarius pubescens (Bearded Milkcap), Hymenopelis radicata (Rooted Toughshank), Russula velenovskyi (Coral Brittlegill), Laccaria tortilis (Twisted Deceiver) and an uncommon Inocybe calospora (a Fibrecap). This last one was easy to identify because if its unusual spores. A pity all the other Fibrecaps are so difficult to identify. I still have two left to do without any confidence I will succeed.\n\nAn early morning visit to woods at Hale to beat the crowds. Quite a decent collection. Some Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca (False Chanterelle) growing on wood chips together with Agaricus xanthodermus (Yellow Stainer). Three Calvatia gigantia (Giant Puffball) just starting to grow in the nettle bed. Also a very young Fistulina hepatica (Beefsteak Fungus) on an old oak stump. Lots of Russula amoenolens (Camembert Brittlegill). A lot of minute Inocybe geophylla (White Fibrecap) and the smallest Entoloma (Wood Pinkgill) I have ever seen at only 2 centimetres. Find of the day was another tiny 2 centimetre species that I could not identify in the field. The pink spore print next day suggested Pluteus. I tracked it down to Pluteus podospileus, a species more of southern England than the north west.\n\nI had to take my car to a local garage for service. It is just over a mile from home so I walked there and back. My route is along a dual carriage way which, like many in this area, has a wide central reservation and grass verges lined with mature trees. They support a good selection of fungi. Early days but I recorded Parasola plicatilis (Pleated Inkcap), Agaricus xanthodermus (Yellow Stainer), Agaricus sylvicola (Wood Mushroom) and Laetiporus sulphureues (Chicken of the Woods). This was growing on the cut stump of an old ornamental cherry tree, not the usual host for this species.\n\nI attended my first North West Fungus Group foray since the pandemic began. Nice to talk to people I have not seen for so long. Not an easy foray as fungi were not abundant and the site has become very overgrown. We still managed a collection of forty odd. Not bad as a lot of the searchers were beginners, this being the purpose of the foray. A good number of common species, always welcome on a beginner's foray. A few unusual species, Mycena corynephora, a small white Bonnet fungus growing on a mossy trunk. The best being a group of Melanophyllum haematospermum (Redspored Dapperling). With its red gills and stem, this was exciting to many of the experienced members who had not previously seen one. With luck we may have attracted some new members to the Group.\n\nI was invited to a local wood to see a fungus found by a dog walker who is also an enthusiastic fungus finder. Until the pandemic he was proprietor of a very good restaurant. He knows his edibles. The fungus he showed me was Hericium erinaceus (Lions Mane). It was well hidden. On hands and knees to see it at all. Normally a species in the south and south west of England, only two known records on the National Database for this far north. One I visited when it grew at Erddig in north Wales. It is edible, popular in Chinese cuisine. I tried it when on holiday in Hong Kong but was not impressed.\n\nI went for a wander to see if the recent rain had encouraged the fungi to appear. Still not much progress. One Boletus luridiformis (Scarletina Bolete) under some beech trees was all I saw although there was a broken Russula that I could not identify from the bits, The large group of Phallus impudicus (Stinkhorn) 'eggs' has increased in number. I also noticed a couple of open Geastrum floriforme (Daisy Earthstar) in the area they grew last year. They looked old so could be leftover from 2020 but I did not see them when I looked for them on a recent walk in that area. A few Ascomycetes on nettle stems and that was all I found.\n\nA wander around the Speke Hall area this morning before it got too hot. I could not get into the Hall because you have to prebook. But I know of a hole in a fence which leads to a path through a narrow stretch of mixed woodland on the boundary. The locals use it as it is the only route to the river from the residential areas as the way is blocked by the airport, the Hall and many industrial complexes. The boundary ditch was dry but enough to support Psathyrella candolleana (Pale Brittlestem), Laccaria laccata (Deceiver) and a couple of slime moulds. Agrocybe pediades (Common Fieldcap) grew on the pathside grass and the dead nettle stems produced a couple of Ascomycetes. Enough to be interesting.\n\nAnother morning of picking on my allotment, followed by a walk in one of the local parks. Things are picking up. A couple of Pluteus cervinus (Deer Shield), Psathyrella candolleana (Pale Brittlestem) and a couple of 'eggs' of Phallus impudicus (Stinkhorn). It was difficult to find anything because a lot of the park is swamped by Himalayan Balsam. The Council do not seem to be taking any steps to control it.\n\nAfter a busy day on my allotment picking redcurrants, blackcurrants, loganberries, broad beans and digging up some potatoes, I needed a walk to straighten my back up. I popped across the road to my local golf course to see if the rain had produced anything. It had. Russula ionochlora (Oilslick Brittlegill) under beech, Lepiota cristata (Stinking Lepiota), lots of Panaeolina foenisecii (Brown Mottlegill) clearly excited by the rain. One that attracted my attention was a pinkish Russula with ochre gills that I did not recognise, After further research at home I concluded that it is Russula puellaris (Yellowing Britlegill) so called because the flesh turns yellow when handled. I have not seen this one before. Must look out for it.\n\nBored with my local area, I had a day trip to Formby, more in hope than expectation. I was right. Freshfield Dune Heath was very dry but I did record a lone Amanita fulva (Tawny Grisette) and a couple Amanita rubescens (Blusher). I continued my walk along Fisherman's Path into Ainsdale. Again it was dry and very overgrown. The only fungus I found in two hours was Microbotryum violaceum, a smut that affects the flower anthers of Silene dioica (Red Campion). I got very excited about some large purple spots on a Sonchus oleraceus (Smooth Sow Thistle) but they are galls produced by a midge, Cystophors sonchi. Unfortunately, I did not have any binoculars with me because I think there was a pair of ravens sitting on a dead tree at a quiet stretch of the coast. If not, they were very large chicks. I must check with the Site Manager.\n\nI watched Royal Ascot on TV and the heavens opened. It poured. All we got in Liverpool was a teaspoonful. In the hope that something might be persuaded to grow, I took a walk round a couple of local woods. All I found were lots of large Polyporus squamosus (Dryad's Saddle). I had not been to these woods for over a month. Where I expected to find fallen trees and branches it was completely overgrown with bramble. Impossible to penetrate.\n\nElderflower picking today. I make wine with them. Also superb dipped in batter and deep fried then sprinkled with icing sugar. Lots of Polyporus squamosus in my local nature reserve. The species seems to thrive in the current dry weather. Unfortunately the weather is perfect for rusts and mildews.. My pear tree has acquired Gymnosprangium sabinae (Pear Rust) and my apple trees have both been attacked by Podosphaeria leucotricha (Powdery Mildew). Happy Days.\n\nThe kids have gone back to school so I went for a walk in my local park. It was hot and dry and slow going. Not much to see. An old Polyporus squamosus (Dryad,s Saddle) on a dead tree and the Myxomycete Ceratiomyxa fruticulosa. I doubt I will find anything until we get a bit of rain. Emptying my garage seems a good plan for this week.\n\nA spot of rain this morning. And I mean spot after three days of very hot. I was surprised to find eight Agrocybe praecox (Spring Brittlestem) growing on a grass path adjoining a vegetable allotment. If the weather stays cool I shall consider going for a wander.\n\nI visited a small wood only five minutes drive from home. It has been closed for a year for safety reasons. Someone went for a walk during a severe gale. Unfortunately and tragically a tree fell on him. Usually overused it looks beautiful at the moment. I found one gilled fungus, Mycena galericulata (Common Bonnet). The rest were dead wood species. Interestingly, I identified three species of Botryobasidium, aureum, conspersum and subcoronatum. They all look the same, white and cottony but the spores and microscopics differ. Usually when you find one, all other finds are the same so this is unusual to me. All other finds were standard stuff.\n\nI joined a friend on my first post vaccination foray. We decided on Ainsdale Nature Reserve to look for morels. The weather was beautiful. Unfortunately after all the rain this month, the water table was very high and the usual route was impassable due to flooding. Alternative cross country attempts to by-pass the floods were also thwarted by water. So we gave up the attempt and followed our usual foray route. Not much around, as one would expect, although I had hoped the dune grassland would have produced something. Most finds were on dead wood. We did find two species not recorded by us previously. Thanetophorus fusisporus, a non-descript crust fungus and a Hyphomycete, Brachysporium masonii. This was identified from rogue spores that were found on a crust fungus. We could not identify the crust fungus even though it was bright yellow.\n\nAs it has been raining a lot I thought now would be a good time to see if anything had started to grow. I chose the wood adjoining Speke Hall. Unfortunately, I failed to spot the menacing black cloud that loomed over me. It then thundered and lightninged and poured down. I got soaked. I did mange to retrieve a couple of specimens. One was Schizopora paradoxa (Split Poregill), one of the most common fungi in any wood. The other was Mollisia cinerea (Common Grey Disco), probably the most common disco in any wood. Not one of my successful forays.\n\nI went for a walk as part of my exercise regime so did not expect to find anything even though it poured with rain last night. Everything was still very dry. To my surprise, I came across two Coprinopsis atramentaria (Common Inkcap). Life at last.\n\nI went for a walk round my local parks. It is so dry that even the bracket fungi have completely dried out. Nothing under the few logs I turned over except woodlice. I do not expect anything until it rains so It is exercise only until that happens. But there is nothing in the forecast. It is very difficult doing anything on the allotment as it is too dry to sow seeds but too cold in the mornings to plant things like peas and beans. Everything is on hold.\n\nA nice but cold morning so I decided to go for a walk. Back to the same route like everyone else. Still very dry as well as cold. A morning of looking under dead wood although not much of that left as the local children seem to have collected it to make hides. Just like I did when I was young. I found a few crust fungi but nothing new for the sites I visited. I had to miss out on going to Ainsdale last weekend but the Manager informs me that there is much flooding and I would not have been able to follow my usual route. It was the same as when I went last year.\n\nA chilly morning so I decided to make another attempt at Hale woods, before everyone realised it was going to be a nice day. It was so quiet until the sun came out but by then I had completed my round. Still very dry and not many gilled fungi. A couple of Melanotus horizontalis (Wood Oysterling) under a log. I found a nice group of Trametes ochracea (Ochre Bracket) and a good selection of crust fungi that I managed to identify at home. The tiny uncommon disco Mollisia subglobosa was where I found it last year. One that has me fooled is a tiny hairy basidiomycete disc. It has the spores and basidia for Episphaeria fraxinicola. It was on a fallen ash tree. But the hairs are wrong with no encrustations. Is there another cyphelloid fungus I do not know about?\n\nFreedom (nearly) at last. I went to Hale to visit my favourite woods. It has been off limits, the Police stopping non residents and issuing fines. But when I got there it was crammed full of kids and dogs. So I turned tail and went to Speke Hall. It shuts on Mondays but the good folk of Liverpool have knocked a hole in the fence of an adjoining wasteland that leads to a path down to the Liverpool Sailing Club. This path is through an avenue of Pinus sylvestris which are in poor state. Lots of dead wood. Still very dry so not much to collect. I did extract a white smear from a dead pine branch more in hope than expectation. It gave me a spore print which was very like Elder whitewash so I thought I must have got the wood wrong. But under the microscope I could not find any clamps or crystals on the cystidia. I did see lots of 'spiders'. Nothing in Fungi Europaei matched. I started on B&K and there it was - Stypella vermiformis. The spiders are basidia. Not one I have recorded before. There is a good illustration at asturnatura.com. As someone recently on Email, it is a victory when you identify one of these.\n\nLockdown over so I went to Hale Woods which have been off limits for a while. Silly me. Warm day. Kids off school. It was packed. So I made for Speke Hall which is closed on Mondays. But I know a hole in the fence which the good people of Liverpool have created that leads to a path from the Speke Hall entrance through a narrow strip of pine trees to the river Mersey and the Speke Coastal Reserve. It still has gun emplacements and machine gun posts built to protect the airport during the war. Still very dry so only a few crust fungi under branches collected. Nice quiet walk.\n\nA bit more rain this morning. I needed my daily exercise. I went for a walk to the usual park. One thing about fungi is that every time you visit the same place there is always the chance that something new has arrived on the same tree you look at every time you go. No agarics but some different crust fungi. My finds included Scopuloides rimosa, Sistotrema brinkmanii and Peniophorella praetermissa. Long names but all very common species.\n\nVery little to report recently as the weather has been cold and dry, a bit eyewatering when trying to search for small Ascomycetes. I did not find any. A few crust fungi but not many and nothing unusual. I did not really need my microscope to identify them but one should always check. You just never know. But today, Spring may have sprung. On my lawn, a couple of Entoloma sericeum (Silky Pinkgill), a common resident. So I had a look at the lawns at the Crematorium and found Entoloma conferendum (Star Pinkgill). They look pretty much the same, brown. It is the spores that differ so they always need checking.\n\nI have managed a few local visits to the golf course and parks but since the freeze it has been cold and dry. Nothing seems to want to grow except a few crusts and the odd bracket. Today I went to Stockton's Wood beside Speke Hall. You have to book and entry time for the Hall but not for this wood. Being National Trust they lock the gates on Monday and Tuesday so today was the day. Still very little under the logs and branches. Seven crusts and a slime mould. Annoyingly, people keep sending me photos of Scarlet Elf Cups from all over Lancashire. I have not yet seen any, not even in the usual places.\n\nI went for a post arctic freeze walk and ended up in Allerton Cemetery. A huge site of 56 acres going back to 1900. I have found fungi there but only at one corner when I take a short cut to home after taking my car for service. Looking round the oldest parts near the chapel, there are some promising areas that should be worth a look later in the year. Lots of tight grass and moss that should suit waxcaps. I ended my walk back at the Crematorium to check on the Geastrum floriforme (Daisy Earthstar). Still there but all closed up. Difficult to see because they now look just like Cupressus leylandii cones. I had to look hard to spot them in the litter.\n\nAnother visit to Liverpool Crematorium, one of the few places that is not covered in mud after all the rain. I only went for a walk before the next storm blew in. Not much fungi around. Probably drowned. The site has a long boundary of Cupressus leylandii which is always worth a look. I was looking for Geastrum striatum which regularly appears there. Part of the boundary is not easily accessible. I persevered through the brambles and I came across a patch of small white stars that I took for petals from paper flowers that are left on the memorials. When I looked closer, I saw that they were overturned Geastrum floriforme (Daisy Earthstar). I counted twenty of this rare species. This is the third time I have recorded it in the last eighteen months at three different sites\n\nThe snow started to melt as the sun came out so I went for my exercise to the local golf course. Still no golf so allowed to wander. I came across some large stacks of cut trunks from various trees. Lots of bracket and crust fungi so I took a selection home. Scopuloides rimosa was easy due to the tine sausage spores. The brackets were tricky. I thought my samples were all the same until I put them under the microscope. The pores are different. One is Daedala quercina (Oak Mazegill). This surprised me because I do not know of any oaks on the course. I have never seen an acorn. First for the site. As is the other, Bjerkandera fumosa (Big Smoky Bracket). This is not a common species. Not bad for a couple of hours in the snow.\n\nI am writing an article and needed to check that I had correctly identified the tree where I found the subject fungus. So I went to Calderstones Park, Liverpool. The lake had overflowed. The area was a marsh. I managed to get to where I wanted. Tree identified. I also checked on my small site of Geastrum striatum and counted sixteen, twice as many as last year. I could get no further so gave up. In the afternoon I went to a wood beside Speke Hall. Decent paths but the ditches had overflowed so most of it looked like the Everglades.I managed to collect a few crust fungi which are awaiting spore prints. Interesting finds so far of Creidotus epibryus (Grass Oysterling) on a beech leaf and Volutella ciliata on a dead Ivy stem.\n\nAs it was a nice morning in that it had ceased raining, I went for my daily exercise. I had hoped it would be quiet in the morning but I was wrong. The usual funny looks as I turned over large branches and logs so gave it up. I shall just have to go out in the rain in future. I did find Stereum rugosum (Bleeding Broadleaf Crust), the Asomycete Hyaloscypha hyalina and a Myxomycete Didymium squamulosum. Most interesting were some tiny white spots on a leaf which usually amount to nothing but in this case they have basidia. So I am keeping the leaf moist to see what might grow. My guess is a Mycena (Bonnet).\n\nI managed a couple of hours on Tuesday. A few Mycenas made an appearance. Mycena vitilis (Snapping Bonnet), one I do not find in Liverpool very often. Mycena speirea (Bark Bonnet) was found under a log. The crust fungi have taken a couple of days to get spore prints. The results are Phlebia radiata (Wrinkled Crust), Brevicellium olivascens, Peniophora limitata and Phlebiella vaga (Yellow Cobweb). The last one is usually bright yellow but does turn white with age. My specimen had small yellowish traces but the spores and hyphae matched and I could not find anything else that did. Since Tuesday we have had incessant rain which has now frozen. I had slippery mud problems on Tuesday and could not access some of my favourite spots. It will be impossible now.\n\nA frosty morning but then the sun came out. So I took advantage and went to the local golf course as they are not permitted to play. Lots of dead and fallen wood about but not much growing on it. I found a single Psathyrella microrrhiza. (Rootlet Brittlestem). All of the crust fungi were Xylodon sambuci (Elder Whitewash) which is not unusual. When looking at the Xylodon under my microscope I found some different spores that I tracked down to the microfungus, Helminthosporium velutinum. A large Tremella mesenterica (Yellow Brain Fungus) and that was all that I found.\n\nMy last foray of the year. I did go out yesterday but it snowed after twenty minutes so I gave it up. Better weather today. The golf course was closed for golf so I was able to wander to places not usually accessible. Plenty of fallen wood from which I recorded Datronia mollis (Common Mazegill) and the Corticioids, Radulomyces confluens and Scopuloides rimosa. Species to be expected now that winter is here. My most interesting find was of a decent sized Basidiomycete under a Cupressus. Under the microscope it proved to be an Inocybe (Fibre Cap) which was a surprise. After further study my conclusion is Inocybe praetiversa. Then it started to snow again. Happy New Year.\n\nA smattering of snow but the sun came out so I took my permitted exercise at my local park. Unfortunately everybody else had the same idea so children and dogs everywhere. Moving off the paved paths just ended up in mud so getting about became difficult. I did see Lepista nuda (Wood Blewit) and Paralepista flaccida (Tawny Funnel) in the shrubberies. I managed to collect a Peziza micropus from a fallen beech tree which is new to that site. But the mud and cold and trying to keep a social distance from people persuaded me it was time to go. So I did.\n\nI took advantage of a lull in the weather to get out before forecasted storms arrive. Some interesting finds. A single Geastrum striatum (Striate Earthstar) under the same stand of Cupressus that I found the rare Geastrum floriforme. What is it about this small area that attracts these unusual earthstars. This is always the first place I look at when I visit this site. I have never seen striatum there before. I also had a look at The Eric Hardy Reserve which was not as muddy as I had feared. A fine example of Ceratiomyca fruticulosa under a large branch and Ascocoryne cylichnium (Purple Jelly Rot). Still lots of Tubaria, Gymnopus and Clitocybe around. I was more interested in dead wood and came home with a good selection of crusts and slime molds to look at at home.\n\nIt has been so wet that I have to spend dry days on my allotment to keep the maintenance up. I managed a short walk to the golf course but the paths were so muddy that I gave it up. I did find a bracket that looks like a Postia but I can not find any spores. So I gave up. I had to park outside one of the local churches. On the lawn I spotted a lone Geoglossum (Earthtongue) so I took it home. Geoglossum fallax (Deceptive Earthtongue). Being forced to stay home, I have been catching up with the specimens I have not yet identified. More news later. Merry Christmas.\n\nI went to Springwood Crematorium in Liverpool to see if any waxcaps had grown on the lawns. I usually find a few different species but nothing at all this year. Nothing today either. I had a look round a small Scots pine plantation which had a few Mycenas in the grass. I also noticed a bright orange fungus under one of the pines. A Gymnopilus. The common one is Gymnopilus penetrans but this looked different. It has small squamules on the cap which identifies it as Gymnopilus sapineus (Scaly Rustgill), an identification I confirmed microscopically at home. In moss that covered the base of a nearby broadleaf tree, I noticed a lot of small brown fruitbodies. I assumed they were Psilocybes, but despite having brown gills, the spore print was white. These I identified as Gymnopus fuscopurpureus. This species is becoming increasingly common, my first ever find being on woodchip which it is said to prefer. I do find it on moss in another park nearby. The only other specimen of note was Mycena olida (Rancid Bonnet), another that likes moss on trees. Usually they are very tiny fruitbodies, making microscopy difficult. This one was at maximum size of 1.5cms, biggest I have ever seen. Made further examination much easier.\n\nThe sun. The sun. A dreadful weather forecast for Sunday and Monday so I took advantage of a clear period to see if anything had popped up. A few of the usual Mycenas (Bonnets), a grey crust fungus Peniophora limitata. Under a pine tree, among the needles and cones, I found a large group of Baeospora myosura (Conifercone cap). One that made me think was Agrocybe elatella (Marsh Fieldcap) as this site is not a marsh. I do have records from previous visits of species more associated with wet habitats. Taking account of the wet weather we have had this autumn, as we did last year, no reason why not.\n\nIn my search for waxcaps, I visited the old graveyard at St. Mary,s Church in Ha"
