        "text": "Introduction\n\nUnderstanding the genetic structure and evolutionary trajectory of pathogen populations in agroecosystems is fundamental to sustainable disease management [1]. Population genetics studies provide insights into pathogen biology, epidemiology, and co-evolutionary interactions with plants, which, in turn, help define management units and dynamic management strategies in response to ever-changing pathogen populations [1,2]. Recently, microsatellites (also known as simple sequence repeats) have been the markers of choice for population genetics studies, and have improved our knowledge of the biology and epidemiology of plant pathogens [3–8]. Some of the characteristics that make microsatellites popular (high mutation rate and variability) also complicate data analysis due to homoplasy, null alleles and complex mutation patterns that may violate assumptions of mutation-migration-drift equilibrium [9,10]. Moreover, ascertainment bias, caused by selection of the most polymorphic microsatellite loci after screening a limited number of individuals, may introduce a systematic bias in the estimates of population variation and structure [11,12]. Some studies also have proposed that microsatellites do not accurately reflect genome-wide patterns of diversity [13,14].\n\nAlternatively, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) offer genome-wide coverage; and confer stable inheritance and analytical simplicity [15]. However, the biallelic nature and lower information content of SNPs demand a higher number of loci to be analyzed, which has traditionally hindered the use of SNPs in population genetics studies of non-model organisms [16–18]. Moreover, ascertainment bias persists as a substantial complication in methods of SNP discovery that use a non-representative sample of individuals for discovery of loci that are subsequently used for genotyping a broader set of individuals [16].\n\nThe advent of reduced-representation sequencing (RRS) methods [19] that facilitate genome-wide discovery of a large number of SNPs at lower costs has enabled the transition from population genetics to population genomics [20,21]. RRS approaches such as restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) [22] and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) [23] use restriction enzymes to reduce genome complexity before sequencing. These methods enable sequencing of a targeted genome fraction for a large number of individuals thereby reducing ascertainment bias through simultaneous marker discovery and genotyping [12,14]. Population genomics approaches can improve population genetics studies through generating multitudes of polymorphic markers that better reflect the genome-wide genetic diversity of populations [13,24]; and enhance resolution to identify fine-scale genetic variation [25–27] or detect rare recombination events [28].\n\nAn essential step in population genomics analyses using RRS genotyping techniques is filtering of poor quality reads and loci with low read depth, low minor allele frequency and a high proportion of missing data [20]. However, best filtering practices are poorly defined for population genomics studies [20,21]. Another potential area of confusion when using RRS genotyping techniques, especially for population genomics analyses of clonal populations, is the identification of genotypes and clones [20,29]. When using only a handful of microsatellite loci, a clone is defined as a unique multi-locus genotype (MLG) [30,31]. However, sequencing and SNP calling errors and missing data in RRS genotyping techniques result in identification of genetically identical individuals as different MLGs [25,29,32]. Moreover, in populations where clonal reproduction predominates, accumulation of somatic mutations over generations results in genetically non-identical individuals within clones, which may be more readily differentiated through high throughput genotyping methods with improved resolution. Thus, assignment of clones based only on MLG will result in highly inflated estimates of clonal diversity [12,20]. Presence of genotyping errors or somatic mutations at high frequencies may be detected through a peak at very low distance magnitudes in the frequency distribution of genetic distances. This may be used to define a distance threshold below which distinct MLGs are assembled into multi-locus lineages (MLL) [32]. Use of analytical tools that depict clonal boundaries based on defined genetic distance thresholds is, therefore, indispensable for identification of MLLs in genome-wide SNP data sets [20,29,32].\n\nCercospora beticola Sacc. is a haploid fungus and the cause of Cercospora leaf spot (CLS) on Beta vulgaris L. (sugar beet, table beet and swiss chard) worldwide. Previous population genetic studies using microsatellite markers uncovered cryptic recombination and high genetic diversity [33–38] in C. beticola populations, yet also revealed the predominance of multiple clones in New York and Hawaii [37–38]. Discovery of low population differentiation and distribution of recurrent genotypes across table beet fields separated by kilometers was interpreted as evidence for long distance dispersal of C. beticola in its asexual form, i.e., genotype flow [38]. Since asexual spores of C. beticola are reported to be dispersed by water or wind over short distances [39,40], long distance dispersal of clones may be mediated by other mechanisms such as agricultural machinery [41,42], seedborne inocula [34,43,44], or insects [39,43]. The relative roles of these mechanisms in initiation of CLS epidemics are not yet fully understood.\n\nDetection of genotype flow in microsatellite population genetics studies of C. beticola may also have been a function of the low power of the 12, microsatellite loci to discriminate non-identical genotypes. In addition, due to the high mutation rate of microsatellite loci, identical multi-locus genotypes may arise through convergent evolution (homoplasy), and not be identical by descent [12]. The use of molecular markers with lower mutation rates, e.g., SNPs, and more refined genotyping methods such as GBS that provide thousands of markers and greater resolution of clonal structure may improve our understanding of genotype flow in C. beticola populations.\n\nThe primary objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of global genotype flow in C. beticola populations using microsatellites [29,33] and GBS [23]. We used the R package poppr [29,45] for defining clonal boundaries in a GBS-SNP data set of C. beticola populations, and assessed the impact of various filtering strategies and distance thresholds on the estimation of clonal diversity and genotype flow. A complementary objective was to compare measures of clonal diversity, differentiation and structure of C. beticola populations obtained from both genotyping approaches.\n\nResults\n\nGBS data summary\n\nA total of 349 genotyped DNA samples had an average of 1,168,032 ± 512,427 reads that passed quality filtering. One DNA sample with less than 10,000 reads failed the quality filtering. The unfiltered data set containing all the 350 DNA samples representing 333 individuals (17 replicates of three individuals) included 27,838 SNPs, which reduced to 19,126 SNPs after initial filtering by the IGD. Further filtering of the entire data set for minor allele frequency of at least 0.01, and minimum 80% coverage of loci resulted in 7,431 SNPs.\n\nPCA using the entire data set (333 individuals and 7,431 SNPs) detected two distinct clusters of individuals (Fig 1), separating 18 DNA samples (from Fields 3 and 5) into a distinct cluster. Microsatellite loci failed to amplify in these same samples. Subsequent multi-locus phylogenetic analyses (ITS, actin, calmodulin, histone H3, and translation elongation factor 1-α) revealed these samples were a different species; Cercospora cf. flagellaris, and were not included in subsequent analyses.\n\nSNPs (n = 7,431) obtained through GBS detected two distinct clusters later identified as C. cf. flagellaris (triangles) and C. beticola (circles) using multi-locus sequence typing.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186488.g001\n\nRelaxed vs. strict-filtering of SNP data set\n\nFor the relaxed-filtered data set, 2,696 SNPs were retained in 319 DNA samples (307 individuals); and 4.89% of the data set was missing. Strict filtering parameters retained 1,631 SNPs in 322 DNA samples (310 individuals), resulting in 1.35% missing data.\n\nReplicated samples\n\nFor the relaxed-filtered SNP data set, none of individuals had the same MLG, including the replicated samples. The bitwise distance among the replicated samples ranged from 4.1 × 10−4 to 1.855 × 10−3 (Table 2). For the strictly filtered SNP data set, the bitwise distance among the replicated DNA samples was zero. However, 37–50% of the replicated samples were identified as different MLGs, which were attributed to loci with missing data.\n\nDelineation of clonal lineages\n\nGenotyping of the 307 C. beticola isolates using microsatellites resulted in detection of 130 MLGs. Contracting the microsatellite data set using the threshold estimated by the cutoff_predict function in poppr resulted in collapsing of 10 genotypes and retention of 120 MLLs (Table 3).\n\nThe relaxed-filtered GBS data set included minimum minor allele frequency of 0.01 and a maximum of 25% missing data for each locus. The strictly filtered data set included a minimum locus-by-individual read depth of three, minimum minor allele frequency of 0.01, and a maximum of 10% missing data for each locus.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186488.t003\n\nThe relaxed-filtered SNP data set (2,696 SNPs in 307 individuals) included 307 MLGs. Collapsing the data set using the more conserved threshold estimated by cutoff_predict resulted in 235 contracted MLLs (relaxed-filtered SNP data set 1). Using the average bitwise distance among the replicated DNA samples as the threshold resulted in 166 MLLs within the 307 individuals (relaxed-filtered SNP data set 2; Table 3).\n\nThe strictly filtered SNP data set (1,631 SNPs in 307 individuals) included 275 MLGs, i.e., 32 individuals had the same genotype at all 1,631 SNPs loci. The distance threshold estimated by the cutoff_predict function and maximum distance among the replicated DNA samples were estimated as zero. Therefore, the strictly filtered SNP data set was only contracted once, collapsing all the individuals with a bitwise distance of zero to the same MLL, resulting in 111 MLLs (Table 3).\n\nRecurrent lineages and genotype flow\n\nOf the 120 MLLs identified using microsatellites, 43 were recurrent and nine were shared among populations (Fig 2A). MLLs 98, 121, 122 and 125 were shared among the C. beticola populations from New York. MLLs 46 and 108 were shared between different states within the USA. Three MLLs were shared between New York and Europe, all of which occurred in Farm 2 (MLLs 31, 32 and 36). The probability of the recurrent MLLs having originated from independent sexual events was ≤ 0.003 for all microsatellite MLLs.\n\nCircles represent MLLs shared among Hawaii (HI), Michigan (MI), New York (NY), and Europe (EUR), with circle sizes proportional to MLL frequencies. The vertical axes show the MLLs detected in the microsatellite (A) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data sets generated through genotyping-by-sequencing (B [strictly filtered], C [relaxed-filtered data set 1], and D [relaxed-filtered data set 2]). MLLs detected using microsatellites are indicated in bold and italic font. When the same MLL was detected in a SNP data set, the original MLL number was replaced with the microsatellite MLL number to allow comparisons between markers. SNP MLLs that included some, but not all, of the individuals in a microsatellite MLLs are indicated with an asterisk.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186488.g002\n\nThe strictly filtered SNP data set (111 MLLs) included 46 recurrent MLLs and nine were shared among populations from different locations (Fig 2B). Four MLLs were shared among the populations within New York, and two MLLs occurred in Michigan and New York. The microsatellite MLL36 also was detected in the strictly filtered SNP data set as shared between Farm 2 (New York) and England. Microsatellite MLLs 31 and 32 were shared between Farm 2 and Denmark but not differentiated from each other in the strictly filtered SNP data set and were identified as a single clonal lineage. An additional MLL (66) was only detected in the strictly filtered SNP data set as shared between Denmark and Sweden.\n\nOf the 235 MLLs detected in the relaxed-filtered data set 1, 46 were recurrent and four were shared among populations. Three MLLs were shared among various farms and fields within New York, while one MLL occurred in both Farm 2 and England (Fig 2C). Of the 166 MLLs in relaxed-filtered data set 2, 52 were recurrent, and eight were shared among populations; five MLLs among table beet fields and farms within New York; one MLL between New York and Michigan; and two MLLs between Farm 2 and Europe (Fig 2D).\n\nIndices of genetic diversity\n\nThe indices of allelic diversity (He) and richness estimated using microsatellite loci were not significantly correlated with the He obtained from the SNP data sets (r < 0.69; P > 0.085) (S1 Table). A significant positive correlation was detected between the number of MLLs and clonal fraction estimated from the microsatellites and SNP data sets (Fig 3A and 3B). Simpson’s complement index of genotypic diversity (λ) obtained with the microsatellite and one of the relaxed-filtered SNP data sets was not significantly correlated (Fig 3C).\n\nRelationships between the (A) Number of multi-locus lineages (MLLs); (B) Clonal fraction; and (C) Simpson’s complement index of genotypic diversity for Cercospora beticola populations estimated using 12 microsatellites (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated using genotyping-by-sequencing. Values were estimated using the strictly filtered SNP data set (filled triangles), relaxed-filtered SNP data set 1 (open circles) and relaxed-filtered SNP data set 2 (open squares).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186488.g003\n\nPopulation structure and differentiation\n\nPairwise indices of differentiation obtained using microsatellites showed low differentiation among the two table beet monoculture fields (Fields 3 and 5) within New York (D = 0.06, GST = 0.05, FST = 0.06) while the populations from the mixed-cropping farms were more differentiated from each other (D = 0.46, GST = 0.22, FST = 0.12) and the other two fields (D > 0.20, GST > 0.13, FST > 0.12; S2–S4 Tables). The C. beticola population from Europe showed low to moderate differentiation compared to populations from Farm 2 (New York) (D = 0.07, GST = 0.03, FST = 0.03) and North Dakota (D = 0.20, GST = 0.08, FST = 0.09), but higher differentiation when compared to other populations (D > 0.46, GST > 0.21, FST > 0.21; S2–S4 Tables).\n\nPatterns of population differentiation obtained from SNP data sets were similar to those obtained using microsatellites (S2–S4 Tables). Mantel tests revealed strong and significant correlations between the values of pairwise D, GST, and FST estimated by microsatellite markers and SNP data sets (Fig 4).\n\n(A) Jost’s D, (B) Pairwise Nei’s GST, and (C) Pairwise FST between Cercospora beticola populations estimated using 12 microsatellites (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified using genotyping-by-sequencing. Values were estimated using the strict SNP data set (filled triangles) and relaxed-filtered SNP data set 1 (open circles). Values estimated using the relaxed-filtered SNP data set 2 were almost identical to those obtained from data set 1.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186488.g004\n\nPatterns of population structure were not affected by marker or SNP filtering parameters (Fig 5). DAPC analysis demonstrated that C. beticola isolates from the two, monoculture table beet fields (Fields 3 and 5) and Farm 1 in New York clustered together, and individuals from Farm 2 clustered with isolates from Europe and North Dakota (Fig 5). The majority of the Hawaiian isolates formed a distinct cluster.\n\nDiscriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) for Cercospora beticola populations from Hawaii (HI), Michigan (MI), New York (Farms 1 and 2; Fields 3 and 5), North Dakota (ND), and Europe using (A) microsatellite, (B) strictly filtered and (C) relaxed-filtered SNP data sets generated using genotyping-by-sequencing.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186488.g005\n\nPopulation structure analysis of microsatellite and SNP data sets resulted in three distinct clusters (Fig 6). The number of clusters was not affected by marker or SNP data set filtering parameters. However, assignment of some individuals to populations differed between data sets generated from the two markers (Fig 6). This could be due to hypervariability of the microsatellite loci and resultant homoplasy in MLGs that are not identical by descent depicted by state. Therefore, individuals with different SNP profiles may be assigned to the same clonal lineage when only analyzed at 12 microsatellite loci.\n\nAssignment of Cercospora beticola isolates from Hawaii (HI), Michigan (MI), New York (Farms 1 and 2; Fields 3 and 5), North Dakota (ND) and Europe to three clusters detected through Bayesian clustering analysis of (A) microsatellite, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data sets generated by genotyping-by-sequencing using (B) strict filtering and (C) relaxed filtering. Each bar represents one individual and the bar height indicates estimated membership fraction of each individual in the inferred clusters.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186488.g006\n\nThe three clusters detected in the microsatellite data set consisted of 60 (cluster 1; green in Fig 6A), 120 (cluster 2; blue in Fig 6A) and 127 (cluster 3; red in Fig 6A) individuals. The most distinct of the clusters was composed entirely of individuals from Hawaii (cluster 1). Five individuals from Hawaii were assigned to cluster 3 using microsatellites and SNP data sets. Analysis of the SNP data sets assigned an additional nine isolates from Hawaii to cluster 2 (Fig 6B and 6C). Cluster 2 almost exclusively included individuals from New York and Michigan, in addition to two individuals from North Dakota (Fig 6A). The SNP data sets also assigned two individuals from North Dakota to cluster 2, but their identity was not consistent between the microsatellite and the SNP data sets. Unique to the SNP data sets, was the assignment of an individual from Europe (Germany) to cluster 2. Cluster 3, was the most diverse in all data sets, and included individuals from Europe, Hawaii, New York and North Dakota.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAdvances in high throughput SNP genotyping approaches have facilitated the identification of multitudes of SNPs in non-model organisms [19], which offer potential advantages over microsatellites for population genetics analyses due to genome-wide coverage, enhanced resolution of population diversity and structure, and stable inheritance facilitating simpler data analysis [14–18]. Our comparative analyses revealed major differences in the estimates of genetic diversity obtained from GBS and microsatellite data sets. However, both marker types and filtering parameters for the GBS data set revealed similar patterns of structure and differentiation in C. beticola populations from the USA and Europe.\n\nThe SNP data sets provided higher resolution in identification of MLGs compared to microsatellites but also greater error rates [68]. A previous study revealed that the error rates for the 12 microsatellite markers used in the current work for genotyping of C. beticola populations were zero, except for a single hypervariable locus (CbSSR3) with an error rate of 0.01 [37]. Here, we assessed GBS genotyping error through including replicated samples and estimating the mismatch rate [69]. Genetic distance among replicated DNA samples varied among isolates and was attributed to a combination of error sources including sensitivity of GBS results to DNA sample quality and quantity, sequencing error and locus drop out. Relaxed filtering of the SNP data set resulted in a bitwise distance of 4.1 × 10−4 to 1.855 × 10−3 among replicated samples. In contrast, strict filtering parameters resulted in an error rate of zero. It has been suggested that higher mismatch rates among replicates are associated with lower read depth [70]. For diploid organisms, filtering for minimum read depth from four to seven has been used to reduce error rates [25,70]. For the haploid C. beticola, filtering the SNP data set for a minimum locus-by-individual read depth of three was sufficient to reduce the mismatch rate of replicated samples to zero. Stringent filtering approaches are especially critical for population genomics analyses that rely on individual identification and delineation of clonal lineages [69–71].\n\nHigher error rates and resolution of GBS approaches can substantially inflate the number of MLGs [12,20]. Even when the SNP data set was filtered using stringent parameters, some of the replicated samples with a mismatch rate of zero were assigned to different MLGs due to missing data. Thus, a more biologically relevant representation of clonality was obtained by collapsing MLGs to MLLs. Contraction of MLGs using a threshold that was too low resulted in inflation of the number of MLLs, and genotypic diversity in all populations was greater than 0.96 (relaxed-filtered data set 1). When the relaxed-filtered data set was contracted using an arbitrary threshold based on the distance among replicated samples, the index of genotypic diversity decreased for some populations but did not correlate with the microsatellite data or the strictly filtered SNP data set. More stringent filtering parameters reduced the number of SNPs from 2,696 to 1,361, and the indices of genotypic diversity were strongly correlated with those obtained from the microsatellite data (Fig 3). There is no “standard” way of filtering and contracting genome-wide SNP data sets, and such parameters are selected based on the type of data, objectives, and biology of the organism in question [20,71]. As filtering parameters and distance thresholds for contracting MLGs substantially impacted the number of retained loci and MLLs, we suggest that population genomics studies based on GBS use variable filtering parameters to critically assess the sensitivity of the results to the filtering approaches.\n\nDetection of repeated MLLs of C. beticola across two continents strengthens the argument for genotype flow [36,38]. Even with relaxed-filtering of the SNP data set and a conservative distance threshold for contraction of MLGs to MLLs, which was even lower than the average error rate, one recurrent clonal lineage was shared between New York and England (Fig 2C) and multiple MLLs were shared among table beet fields in New York. The microsatellite data set (Fig 2A) and strictly filtered SNP data set (Fig 2B) detected many more MLLs that were shared between continents, and among different states in the USA.\n\nA potential means of long distance migration of clonal lineages is contaminated seed. Cercospora beticola has been associated with raw sugar beet seed (‘beet balls’) [43] and population genetics studies in Europe have suggested infested seed as a potential source of inoculum [34,44]. However, other studies have not found C. beticola on sugar beet seed [72,73]; and the presence of C. beticola on table beet seed lots in New York is also unknown. Commercially available table beet seed is not polished to remove the exterior corky layer as is done in sugar beet seed to enhance germination and reduce pathogen contamination. The seed planted in the monoculture fields in New York (Fields 3 and 5) originated from Skagit Co., Washington State, USA, where occurrence of C. beticola in seed crops is rare [74]. If the high number of shared MLLs and low population differentiation of C. beticola populations from table beet monoculture fields in New York is not a result of contaminated seed, transfer by agricultural machinery [41,42] or insects [39,43] may also be involved. The shared clonal lineages between New York and Europe were collected from table beet at Farm 2, which is a mixed-cropping organic production enterprise. The table beet seed used at Farm 2 is obtained annually from various organic certified seed providers, while the seed planted at Farm 1 had been produced at that location for many years.\n\nThe predominant source of C. beticola inoculum in table beet and sugar beet fields is most likely to be alternative weedy hosts or volunteers [43,75], infested plant debris [76,77] or soilborne inoculum [78]. Cercospora beticola is reported to persist for 22 months to over three years on infested plant debris [76,77], and also remain virulent for 27 and 20 months in sterilized and C. beticola-infested field soil, respectively [78]. CLS epidemics then spread rapidly within a few weeks through short-range rain splash of asexual spores, which are unlikely to be involved in long-distance dispersal [39,40]. The presence of a sexual form remains unknown but multiple studies have postulated cryptic sex [79–81]. Even if C. beticola is capable of sexual reproduction, due to its heterothallic nature [79], ascospores are unlikely to be of the same clonal lineage and will most likely have recombinant genotypes [82]. Thus, ascospores are unlikely to be the source of long distance dispersal of MLLs in this study. Other plausible routes for inter-continental transmission of C. beticola is international trade of diseased alternative hosts. For example, Groenewald et al. [83] reported C. beticola from Chrysanthemum spp. suggesting that trade in cut flowers and ornamentals could be involved. Evidence for long distance migration of C. beticola genotypes provided here warrants further investigations on potential seedborne inoculum as a means of dispersal.\n\nAlthough measures of genetic diversity (He and λ) were not associated between different marker systems, there was significant correlation among the number of clonal lineages and clonal fraction estimated from microsatellite and SNP data sets, which led to similar clonality rankings of populations across data sets. The population in Hawaii was the most clonal while the European population had the highest diversity. This is most likely an artefact of sampling strategies as the population from Hawaii was isolated from one community garden while the isolates from Europe were collected from a broad geographical area. Lack of significant correlation between expected heterozygosity obtained from microsatellites (SSR-He) and SNPs (SNP-He) has been reported, and may be due to the restricted genome coverage of microsatellites [13,84].\n\nAbsolute values of population differentiation (D, GST and FST) obtained from the microsatellite and SNP data sets varied, however, there was a strong, significant correlation between the indices of differentiation, supporting results of other studies [13,84–87]. Analyses based on allele frequencies, such as estimates of genetic differentiation, are not as affected by genotyping errors as those based on individual identification [69]. Although shared recurrent MLLs were indicative of long distance dispersal of inoculum, pairwise population genetic differentiation and clustering of individuals based on geographic location indicated that the C. beticola population is not panmictic within New York, nor worldwide, providing evidence for restricted dispersal of inoculum.\n\nSpatial patterns in C. beticola population structure were not affected by markers or filtering parameters for the SNP data set. However, minor differences were observed in the assignment of individuals to inferred clusters. Other studies have also found no or little impact of marker system on biological conclusions concerning the broad-scale structure of populations [70,88,89]. In general, due to the lower information of SNPs, accurate estimation of the number of populations has been reported to require more SNPs than microsatellites [11,24,85,89,90].\n\nIn conclusion, different marker systems, filtering approaches and distance thresholds used to collapse MLGs to MLLs, strongly affected clone identification in C. beticola. However, general patterns of variation or population structure were not affected by marker type or filtering parameters used to interrogate SNP data sets. For analyses based on allele frequencies, maximizing the number of SNPs may be more beneficial. In contrast, for analyses that require confidence in genotype of individuals, more stringent filtering for locus-by-individual read depth and clear definition of clonal boundaries based on genotyping error rate is necessary. The results also emphasize the need for development of species-specific molecular markers for rapid and reliable detection of C. beticola. The PCR markers based on the calmodulin region reliably differentiate C. beticola from C. apii [46], but failed to differentiate C. cf. flagellaris isolates collected from CLS symptoms on table beet. An earlier study also demonstrated these primers did not differentiate C. chenopodii from C. beticola [38]. The GBS-SNP data produced here may be useful for discovery of informative SNPs for diagnostic assay development [90,91]."
