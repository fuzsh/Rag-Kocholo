        "meta_description": "The genus Cercospora includes many important plant pathogens that are commonly associated with leaf spot diseases on a wide range of cultivated and wild plant species. Due to the lack of useful morphological features and high levels of intraspecific variation, host plant association has long been a decisive criterion for species delimitation in Cercospora. Because several taxa have broader host ranges, reliance on host data in Cercospora taxonomy has proven problematic. Recent studies have revealed multi-gene DNA sequence data to be highly informative for species identification in Cercospora, especially when used in a concatenated alignment. In spite of this approach, however, several species complexes remained unresolved as no single gene proved informative enough to act as DNA barcoding locus for the genus. Therefore, the aims of the present study were firstly to improve species delimitation in the genus Cercospora by testing additional genes and primers on a broad set of species, and secondly to find the best DNA barcoding gene(s) for species delimitation. Novel primers were developed for tub2 and rpb2 to supplement previously published primers for these loci. To this end, 145 Cercospora isolates from the Iranian mycobiota together with 25 additional reference isolates preserved in the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute were subjected to an eight-gene (ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, his3, tub2, rpb2 and gapdh) analysis. Results from this study provided new insights into DNA barcoding in Cercospora, and revealed gapdh to be a promising gene for species delimitation when supplemented with cmdA, tef1 and tub2. The robust eight-gene phylogeny revealed several novel clades within the existing Cercospora species complexes, such as C. apii, C. armoraciae, C. beticola, C. cf. flagellaris and Cercospora sp. G. The C. apii s. lat. isolates are distributed over three clades, namely C. apii s. str, C. plantaginis and C. uwebrauniana sp. nov. The C. armoraciae s. lat. isolates are distributed over two clades, C. armoraciae s. str. and C. bizzozeriana. The C. beticola s. lat. isolates are distributed over two clades, namely C. beticola s. str. and C. gamsiana, which is newly described.",

        "text": "Specimens and isolates\n\nA total of 170 strains, including 145 previously identified as Cercospora species in Bakhshi et al. (2015a), as well as 25 other related strains formerly identified by Groenewald et al. (2013), were studied. Isolates used in this study (Table 1) are maintained in the collection of the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute (CBS), Utrecht, The Netherlands, the working collection of Pedro Crous (CPC; housed at CBS), the culture collection of the Iranian Research Institute of Plant Protection (IRAN C), Tehran, Iran, and the culture collection of Tabriz University (CCTU), Tabriz, Iran. Type material of the new species recognized is preserved in the Fungal Herbarium of the Iranian Research Institute of Plant Protection (IRAN F).\n\nDNA extraction and PCR amplification\n\nDNA samples comprised those previously extracted by Bakhshi et al. (2015a) and Groenewald et al. (2013). Three additional partial nuclear genes were targeted for PCR amplification and sequencing, namely, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (rpb2), and β-tubulin (tub2), using corresponding primer sets (Table 2). PCR amplifications were performed in a total volume of 12.5 µL on a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The gapdh PCR mixture consisted of 5–10 ng genomic DNA, 1 × PCR buffer (Bioline, London), 2 mM MgCl2 (Bioline), 50 µM of each dNTP, 0.5 µL BSA (10 mg/ml) (Promega, Madison, WI), 0.28 µM of each primer and 0.5 units GoTaq® Flexi DNA polymerase (Promega). The tub2 PCR mixture contained 5–10 ng genomic DNA, 1 × PCR buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 40 µM of each dNTP, 0 µL/0.5 µL BSA, 0.25 µM of each primer and 0.5 units GoTaq® Flexi DNA polymerase using respectively the BT-1F/BT-1R (this study) or T1 (O’Donnell & Cigelnik 1997)/β-Sandy-R (Stukenbrock et al. 2012) primer sets. The rpb2 gene was amplified in three parts with three primer sets. Part three was only amplified in some selected species in order to design a new reverse primer for amplification of part two. The rpb2 PCR mixtures using the fRPB2-5F (Liu et al. 1999)/fRPB2-414R (Quaedvlieg et al. 2011) primer set consisted of 5–10 ng genomic DNA, 1 × PCR buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 40 µM of each dNTP, 0.5 µL BSA, 0.2 µM of each primer and 0.5 units GoTaq® Flexi DNA polymerase. The PCR mixtures using RPB2-C5F/RPB2-C8R (this study) and fRPB2-7cF/fRPB2-11aR primer sets (Liu et al. 1999) were the same as gapdh.\n\nTo obtain the partial tub2 and rpb2 (using the fRPB2-5F/fRPB2-414R and fRPB2-7cF/fRPB2-11aR primer sets) sequences, PCR amplification conditions were set as follows: an initial denaturation temperature of 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 (tub2) or 45 (rpb2) cycles of denaturation temperature of 94 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at the temperature stipulated in Table 2 for 30 s, primer extension at 72 °C for 45 s and a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min.\n\nA touchdown PCR protocol was used to amplify the partial gapdh (using the Gpd1-LM/Gpd2-LM primer set (Myllys et al. 2002)) and rpb2 (using the RPB2-C5F/RPB2-C8R primer set) sequences: initial denaturation (94 °C, 5 min), five amplification cycles (94 °C, 45 s; 60 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 90 s), five amplification cycles (94 °C, 45 s; 58 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 90 s), 30 amplification cycles (94 °C, 45 s; 53 °C (gapdh) or 56 °C (rpb2), 45 s; 72 °C, 90 s) and a final extension step (72 °C, 5 min). PCR products were visualised by electrophoresis using a 1.2 % agarose gel, stained with GelRed™ (Biotium, Hayward, CA) and viewed under ultra-violet light. Size estimates were made using a HyperLadder™ I molecular marker (Bioline).\n\nSequencing and phylogenetic analyses\n\nThe resulting PCR fragments were sequenced in both directions using the same primers used for amplification (Table 2) and the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v. 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA sequencing amplicons were purified through Sephadex G-50 Superfine columns (SigmaAldrich, St Louis, MO) in 96-well MultiScreen HV plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA) as outlined by the manufacturer and analysed with an ABI Prism 3730xl Automated DNA analyser (Life Technologies Europe BV, Applied Biosystems™, Bleiswijk, The Netherlands).\n\nThe raw DNA sequences of tub2, gapdh and rpb2 were edited using MEGA v. 6 (Tamura et al. 2013) and forward and reverse sequences for each isolate were assembled manually to generate consensus sequences. Two parts of the rpb2 gene (part amplified with the fRPB2-5F/fRPB2-414R primer set + part amplified with the RPB2-C5F/RPB2-C8R primer set) were compiled manually using MEGA v. 6. The assembled consensus sequences were initially aligned with MEGA v. 6 and optimised with the multiple sequence alignment online interface of MAFFT using default settings (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) (Katoh & Standley 2013), and adjusted manually where necessary. In addition, sequences of the same isolates corresponding to the ITS locus (including ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2), together with parts of four protein coding genes, viz. translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1), actin (actA), calmodulin (cmdA) and histone H3 (his3), were retrieved from the NCBIs GenBank nucleotide database and included in the analyses, after separate alignment as described above. Sequences of Cercospora sorghicola (CBS 136448 = IRAN 2672C) were used as outgroup. Evolutionary models for phylogenetic analyses were selected independently for each locus using MrModeltest v. 2.3 (Nylander 2004) under the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Table 3). The individual alignments of the different loci were subsequently concatenated with Mesquite v. 2.75 (Maddison & Maddison 2011) prior to being subjected to a combined multi-gene analysis. Given the different sizes of the data partitions, they could not be properly used in statistical tests for (in) congruency. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using Bayesian inference (BI) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in MrBayes v. 3.2.2 (Ronquist et al. 2012). Two simultaneous MCMC analyses, each consisting of four Markov chains, were run from random trees until the average standard deviation of split frequencies reached a value of 0.01, with trees saved every 100 generations and the heating parameter was set to 0.15. Burn-in phase was set to 25 % and the posterior probabilities (Rannala & Yang 1996) were calculated from the remaining trees. The resulting phylogenetic tree was generated with Geneious v. 5.6.7 (Drummond et al. 2012).\n\nAll new sequences generated in this study were deposited in NCBIs GenBank nucleotide database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; Table 1) and the alignment and phylogenetic trees in TreeBASE S22944 (www.TreeBASE.org).\n\nMorphology\n\nMorphological descriptions are based on structures from dried material. Diseased leaf tissues were viewed under a Nikon® SMZ1500 stereo-microscope and taxonomically informative morphological structures (stromata, conidiophores and conidia) were picked up from lesions with a sterile dissecting needle and mounted on glass slides in clear lactic acid. Structures were examined under a Nikon Eclipse 80i light microscope, and photographed using a mounted Nikon digital sight DS-f1 high definition colour camera.\n\nThirty measurements were made at ×1000 for each microscopic structure, and 95 % confidence intervals were derived for the measurements with extreme values given in parentheses. Colony macro-morphology on MEA was determined after 1 mo at 25 °C in the dark in duplicate and colony colour was described using the mycological colour charts of Rayner (1970). Nomenclatural novelties and descriptions were deposited in MycoBank (www.mycobank.org; Crous et al. 2004). The naming system for tentatively applied names used by Groenewald et al. (2013) and Bakhshi et al. (2015a) is continued in this manuscript to simplify comparison between the studies.\n\nIdentification of the best-performing DNA barcode\n\nThe dataset of the eight loci, ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, his3, tub2, rpb2 and gapdh, was individually tested for two factors: Kimura-2-parameter (K2P) values (barcode gap) and molecular phylogenetic resolution (clade recovery). Inter- and intraspecific distances of eight loci were calculated for each single-locus sequence data alignment, using MEGA v. 6.0 with the Kimura-2-parameter distance values using the pairwise deletion model. Microsoft Excel 2010 was subsequently used to sort these distance values into distribution bins (from distance 0–0.1 with intervals of 0.01 between bins) and the frequency of entries for each individual bin was then plotted against the Kimura-2-parameterdistance of each bin.\n\nIn addition, Bayesian analyses using the corresponding nucleotide substitution models (Table 3) were applied to each data partition to check the stability and robustness of each species clade (clade recovery) under the different loci (data not shown, trees deposited in TreeBASE S22944) (Table 4). The clade recovery and Kimura-2-parameter values for each locus were calculated after applying the consolidated species concept to the results of eight-gene phylogenetic tree.\n\nAllele group designation\n\nThe isolates in each of the Cercospora species complexes, including C. apii, C. armoraciae, C. beticola, C. cf. flagellaris, and Cercospora sp. G, were compared using the individual alignments of the eight single loci in MEGA v. 6. Allele groups were established for each locus based on sequence identity, i.e. each sequence with one or more nucleotide difference from the other sequence was regarded as a different allele.\n\nSpecies delimitation in the genus Cercospora in this study follows the Consolidated Species Concept accepted in recent revisions of the taxonomy of cercosporoid fungi (e.g. Groenewald et al. 2013, Crous et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a, Videira et al. 2017). Twenty-eight lineages of Cercospora were resolved based on the clustering and support in the Bayesian tree obtained from the combined ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, his3, tub2, rpb2, and gapdh alignment (Fig. 1, Table 4). Ofthese, 15 species including C. althaeina, C. chenopodii, C. convolvulicola, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. cylindracea, C. iranica, C. pseudochenopodii, C. cf. richardiicola, C. rumicis, C. solani, C. sorghicola, Cercospora sp. T, C. violae, C. zebrina, and C. cf. zinnia, were the same as those also accepted before in the five-gene phylogenetic tree (ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, and his3) (Bakhshi et al. 2015a). However, the eight-gene phylogenetic tree separated strains previously recognised as C. apii, C. armoraciae, C. beticola, C. cf. fagellaris, and Cercospora sp. G, based on five-gene phylogenetic tree (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a) into at least three, two, two, four and two well-supported clades respectively (Fig. 1). Some of these clades are supported by the host range or morphological characters of the isolates and are therefore described as new below.\n\nCercospora apii complex\n\nThe 16 isolates previously recognised as C. apii based on five-gene phylogenetic tree (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a) are assigned here to three lineages based on the eight-gene phylogenetic tree, host association, and morphology, including C. apii s. str., C. uwebrauniana sp. nov., and C. plantaginis (Fig. 1, part 2). The results of allele group designation for the isolates in this complex detected one, four, two, two, four, three, four and two allele groups for the ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, his3, tub2, rpb2, and gapdh sequences, respectively (Table 5).\n\nCercospora apii Fresen., Beitr.

Mycelium internal. Caespituli amphigenous, brown. Conidiophores aggregated in loose fascicles, arising from a moderately developed, intraepidermal and substomatal, dark brown stroma, to 30 µm diam; conidiophores brown at the base, becoming paler towards the apex, 2–10-septate, straight to geniculate-sinuous due to sympodial proliferation, simple, uniform in width, somewhat constricted at the proliferating point, (45–)60–85 × 4–5 µm.

Three species of Cercospora, including C. apii, C. pantoleuca and C. plantaginis, have been reported from Plantago (Crous & Braun 2003, https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/). This species is morphologically close to C. plantaginis described from Italy on P. lanceolata (Chupp 1954). Since one European isolate from P. lanceolata in Romania (CBS 252.67 = CPC 5084) also resides in this clade, we designate an epitype here for this species, and fix the application of the name C. plantaginis to this clade.\n\nAdditional specimens examined: Iran: Guilan Province: Chaboksar, on P. lanceolata, Jul. 2012, M.

Conidiophores in moderately dense fascicles, arising from the upper cells of a moderately developed, intraepidermal and substomatal, brown stroma, to 40 µm wide; conidiophores straight to slightly geniculate, pale brown to brown, unbranched, regular in width, (60–)115–145(–230) × 3.5–5.5 µm, 2–9-septate. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, brown, proliferating sympodially, 15–35 × 3.5–5.5 µm, mostly mono-local, sometimes multi-local; loci distinctly thickened, darkened, refractive, apical or formed on the shoulders caused by geniculation, 2–3.5 µm. Conidia solitary, hyaline, subcylindrical to cylindrical, straight or slightly curved, truncate to subtruncate at the base, obtuse to rounded at the apex, (23–)38–48(–70) × 4.5–8 µm, (0–)3–4(–9)-septate; hila thickened, darkened, refractive, 1.5–3 µm diam.\n\nNotes: Two isolates, obtained from H. europaeum in different provinces in Iran, clustered in a small clade within C. apiis. str. (Fig. 1, part 2). This independent clade is supported by tef1, his3 and tub2 from C. apii s. str. Morphologically, these two strains are completely distinct from their most closely related species in the phylogenetic tree, namely C. apii (conidia acicular, subacute or subobtusely rounded at the apex, (30–)65–80(–115) × 3–5 µm), C. beticola (conidia subacute to acute apex, (40–)90–140(–300) × 2–5 µm), C. gamsiana (conidia subobtuse at the apex, (27–)49–62(–100) × 2–4 µm) and C. plantaginis (conidia subobtuse to subacute apices, (40–)60–70(–105) × 2–3.5 µm), by the obtuse to rounded apex, wider and shorter conidia ((23–)38–48(–70) × 4.5–8 µm), and are regarded as a separate species, appearing to be confined to H. europaeum.\n\nPresently, three species of Cercospora have been described from Heliotropium, C. apii, C. heliotropiicola, and C. taurica (Crous & Braun 2003, https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungalda-tabases/). Cercospora uwebrauniana differs from C. taurica in the cylindrical conidia with truncate or subtruncate bases and somewhat shorter and wider conidia, (23–)38–48(–70) × 4.5–8 µm vs 40–110 × (2.5–)4–6(–7) µm in C. taurica (Braun 2002). In addition, C. taurica has obclavate-cylindrical conidia with obconically truncate bases and rather wider conidiophores, 4–9 µm diam (Braun 2002). Cercospora heliotropiicola is morphologically quite distinct from C. uwebrauniana in having acicular or subulate, much thinner (2–3 µm wide) and longer (to 300 µm long) conidia with subobtuse or acute apex (Pons & Sutton 1996).\n\nAdditional specimen examined: Iran: Guilan Province: Astara, on H. europaeum, Jun. 2012, M. Bakhshi (IRAN 17096F, CCTU 1134).\n\nCercospora armoraciae complex\n\nThe 10 isolates previously recognised as C. armoraciae based on a five-gene phylogenetic tree (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a) are assigned to two lineages here, based on the eight-gene phylogenetic tree, including C. armoraciae s. str. and C. bizzozeriana (Fig. 1, part 1). The results of allele group designation for the isolates in this complex revealed one, three, one, two, seven, three, three and two allele groups for the ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, his3, tub2, rpb2 and gapdh sequences, respectively (Table 6).\n\nCercospora armoraciae Sacc., Nuovo Giorn. Bot. Ital. 8: 188 (1876).\n\nNote: This clade includes the ex-type culture of C. armoraciae (CBS 250.67).\n\nCercospora bizzozeriana Sacc. & Berl., Malpighia 2: 248 (1888).\n\n(Fig. 5)\n\nType: Italy: Padova, on Lepidium latifolium (Brassicaceae), (Berlese, Malpighia 1: tab. XIV, fig. 23, 1887 — lectotype, designated here, MBT 383343); Romania: Fundulea, on Cardaria draba, isol. by O. Constantinescu [deposited in the CBS culture collection in 1967] (CBS 258.67 — epitype designated here, MBT 383154, preserved as a metabolically inactive culture).\n\nNotes: Type material of C. bizzozeriana is not preserved in Saccardo’s herbarium (see Gola 1930). Therefore, the original illustration published by Saccardo & Berlese (in Berlese 1888) is designated as lectotype (according to Art. 9.3 and 9.4). Berlese’s article “Fungi veneti novi vel critici” was split into several parts published in Malpighia 1 (1887) and 2 (1888). The description of C. bizzozeriana was published in vol 2, but with reference to tab. XIV, fig. 23 already issued in vol. 1.\n\nDescription: Leaf spots amphigenous, circular, 1–5 mm, white to white-grey with grey to black dots (stroma with conidiophores) and definite brown border. Mycelium internal. Caespituli amphigenous, brown. Conidiophores aggregated in dense fascicles, arising from a well-developed, brown stroma, to 75 µm diam; conidiophores brown, 1–5-septate, straight to geniculate-sinuous due to sympodial proliferation, simple, sometimes branched, uniform in width, sometimes constricted at the proliferating point, (30–)50–60(–80) × 4–7 µm. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal or lateral, pale brown to brown, proliferating sympodially, 10–25 × 3–6 µm, multi-local; loci distinctly thickened, darkened and somewhat refractive, apical, lateral or formed on shoulders caused by geniculation, 1.5–3 µm diam. Conidia solitary, obclavate-cylindrical, straight to slightly curved, hyaline, (20–)60–80(–125) × 3–6 µm, 2–10-septate, with obtuse apices and subtruncate or obconically truncate bases; hila thickened, darkened, refractive, 1.5–3 µm diam.\n\nNotes: Isolates obtained from different host species including Tanacetum balsamita, Capparis spinosa and Cardaria draba clustered in a clade distinct from the ex-type isolate of C. armoraciae, and are regarded as a separate taxon. In addition, five isolates obtained from Car. draba (three from Iran and two from Romania) all cluster in this clade. Until now, three species of Cercospora are known from these host species, including C. bizzozeriana, C. chrysanthemi and C. capparis (Crous & Braun 2003, https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/). Cercospora chrysanthemi is in the C. apii s. lat. complex (Crous & Braun 2003). Cercospora capparis differs from this species by the narrower (4–5.5 µm diam) conidiophores and 3–5 µm diam conidia (Chupp 1954). The species is morphologically close to C. bizzozeriana which was described from Italy on Car. draba (Chupp 1954). Since two European isolates from Car. draba in Romania also reside in this clade, we designate an epitype here (ex-epitype culture CBS 258.67 = CPC 5061) for this species, and fix the application of C. bizzozeriana to this clade.\n\nAdditional specimens examined: Iran: West Azerbaijan Province: Khoy, Firouragh, on leaves of Car. draba, Nov. 2011, M.

One, one, one, one, one, two, three and four allele groups were distinguished for the ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, his3, tub2, rpb2 and gapdh sequences, respectively (Table 7).\n\nCercospora beticola Sacc., Nuovo Giorn.

Mycelium internal. Caespituli amphigenous, brown. Conidiophores aggregated in loose to dense fascicles, emerging through stomatal openings or erumpent through the cuticle, arising from the upper cells of a moderately to well-developed brown stroma, to 110 µm diam; conidiophores brown, becoming paler towards apex, 2–8-septate, thick-walled, straight to geniculate-sinuous, unbranched, uniform in width, (30–)80–110(–185) × 4–5(–6) µm. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal or lateral, unbranched, brown, smooth, proliferating sympodially, 10–30 × 3.5–5.5 µm, mostly multi-local, sometimes mono-local; loci apical or formed on shoulders caused by geniculation, thickened, darkened, refractive, 1.5–2 µm diam. Conidia solitary, subcylindrical, filiform to acicular, straight to variously curved, hyaline, 3–15(–29)-septate, apex subacute to acute, base truncate to subtruncate, (40–)90–140(–300) × 2–5 µm; hila thickened, darkened, refractive, 1.5–2.5 µm diam.\n\nNote: This clade includes the ex-epitype culture of C. beticola (CBS 116456 = CPC 11557), therefore we fixed the application of the name C. beticola s. str. to this clade.\n\nAdditional specimens examined: Egypt, on B. vulgaris, 15 Apr. 2004, M.

Bakhshi (IRAN 17011F — holotype; CBS 144962 = CCTU 1074 = CPC 24909— ex-type culture).\n\nDescription: Leaf spots amphigenous, circular to irregular, 3–8 mm diam, grey to brown. Mycelium internal. Caespituli amphigenous, brown. Conidiophores aggregated in moderately dense fascicles, arising from a well-developed, intraepidermal and substomatal, brown stroma, to 45 µm diam; conidiophores pale brown, 1–5-septate, geniculate-sinuous, irregularly constricted, unbranched, moderately thin-walled, irregular in width, often conical and attenuated at the apex, sporulation is restricted at the terminal part of conidiophores, 45–60(–110) × 4–5 µm. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, pale brown to olivaceous-brown, proliferating sympodially, 10–25 × 3.5–5 µm, uni- or multi-local; loci distinctly thickened, darkened and somewhat refractive, apical, circumspersed, 1.5–2 µm diam. Conidia solitary, subcylindrical to obclavate or somewhat narrowed towards the tip, straight to slightly curved, hyaline, thin-walled, (27–)49–62(–100) × 2–4 µm, distinctly 3–10-septate, subobtuse at the apex and long obconically truncate at the base; hila distinctly thickened, darkened, refractive, 1.5–2.5 µm diam.\n\nNotes: Until now, 14 species names in Cercospora have been introduced from these host species, including C. apii, C. althaeina, C. beticola, C. hyalospora (C. apii s. lat. complex), C. malvarum (C. apii s. lat. complex), C. malvicola, C. sigesbeckiae, C. peckiana (C. apii s. lat. complex), C. rumicis, C. sonchi (C. apii s. lat. complex), C. sonchicola (C. apii s. lat. complex), C. sonchifolia, C. sesami (C. apii s. lat. complex), and C. sesamigena (Crous & Braun 2003, https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/). Cercospora gamsiana is phylogenetically clearly distinguishable from C. apii, C. althaeina, C. beticola, C. sigesbeckiae and C. rumicis (Bakhshi et al. 2015a) (Fig. 1, part 2). It is morphologically well distinguished from species of the C. apii complex and other species of Cercospora by its irregularly constricted, thin-walled, often conical and attenuated at the apex conidiophores and, conidia with long obconically truncate bases; sporulation is restricted at the terminal part of conidiophores.\n\nAdditional specimens examined: Iran: Zanjan Province: Tarom, Zehtar Abad, on leaves of Malva sylvestris, Sep. 2011, M.

Three, four, six, seven, seven, seven, two and nine allele groups were distinguished for the ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, his3, tub2, rpb2 and gapdh sequences, respectively (Table 8).\n\nCercospora cf. gossypii Lall et al., Indian Phytopath. 14: 116 (1962) [“1961”].\n\n(Fig. 8)\n\nDescription: Leaf spots amphigenous, circular to subcircular, 1–4 mm diam, with grey-brown centre and purple-brown margins. Mycelium internal. Caespituli amphigenous, brown. Conidiophores aggregated in dense fascicles, arising from the upper cells of a well-developed, intraepidermal and substomatal, brown stroma, to 65 µm diam; conidiophores pale brown to brown, simple, rarely branched, 1–4-septate, straight or flexuous caused by sympodial proliferation, almost uniform in width, often constricted at proliferating point, (35–)60–75(–110) × 4–5 µm. Conidiogenous cells terminal or integrated, pale brown, smooth, proliferating sympodially, 10–45 × 3.5–5 µm, multi-local; loci thickened, darkened, refractive, apical, lateral, circumspersed, 1.5–2.5 µm diam. Conidia solitary, smooth, subcylindrical to obclavate, straight or mildly curved, successively tapering towards the apex, hyaline, 1–7-septate, apex subacute to subobtuse, base truncate to short obconically truncate, (30–)65–90(–160) × 2–4 µm; hila distinctly thickened, darkened, refractive, 1–2 µm diam.\n\nNotes: This clade includes two isolates obtained from G. herbaceum and Hib. trionum, both in the Malvaceae (Fig. 1, part 3). Cercospora althaeina, C. fagopyri, C. malayensis (C. apii s. lat.), C. gossypii, C. gossypiicola, C. gossypina and C. lhuillieri (C. apii s. lat.) are six Cercospora species which have been reported until now on Gossypium and Hibiscus host genera (Crous & Braun 2003, https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/). This species is phylogenetically distinct from C. althaeina (Fig. 1) and C. fagopyri (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a). Cercospora gossypina is distinguished from this species in that it induces wider leaf spots (0.5–10 mm), and has unbranched, longer and wider conidiophores (75–250 × 4–6.5 µm) (Hsieh & Goh 1990). Cercospora malayensis is distinguished from C. cf. gossypii in that it has elliptical, yellow to tan leaf spots; unbranched, 1–8-septate conidiophores and mostly terminal conidiogenous cells and somewhat longer conidia (50–270 × 2.5–4 µm) (Little 1987). Cercospora gossypiicola (Narayan et al. 2001) and C. lhuillieri (Montegut 1967) resemble C. apii (with acicular conidia), but are different. They do not have stromata, and form less conidiophores per fascicle. The description of C. gossypii (Lall et al. 1961) is rather close to this taxon. The type of C. gossypii is from India. Thus, fresh material is needed from India to resolve the application of the name C. gossypii.\n\nSpecimens examined: Iran: Ardabil Province: Moghan, on Gossypium herbaceum (Malvaceae), Oct. 2011, M.

Martin, Am. Nat. 16: 1003 (1882).\n\nClade 1; Clade 2; Clade 3\n\nIn view of the overlap between the morphological characters of these three clades, we provide a single over-arching description here.\n\nDescription: Mycelium internal. Caespituli amphigenous, brown. Conidiophores aggregated in loose to dense fascicles, arising from a weakly to well-developed, intraepidermal and substomatal, brown stroma; conidiophores pale brown to brown, 2–18-septate, straight, sinuous to distinctly geniculate, flexuous, simple, unbranched or rarely branched, uniform or irregular in width, sometimes constricted at septa and proliferating point, (75–)130–165(–300) × 4–5.5 µm in clade 1; (30–)80–120(–210) × 3.5–5.5 µm in clade 2; (25–)60–95(–230) × 3.5–5.5 µm in clade 3. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, proliferating sympodially, mono- or multi-local; loci thickened, darkened, apical, lateral or circumspersed, 1.5–2.5 µm diam. Conidia solitary, hyaline, subcylindrical, filiform to obclavate, straight to slightly curved, with truncate to obconically truncate base and subacute to subobtuse apices, (60–)125–170(–300) × 3–5 µm, 5–20-septate in clade 1; (25–)60–95(–260) × 2.5–4.5 µm, (2–)8–11(–25)-septate in clade 2; (30–)100–155(–320) × 2–5 µm, (2–)10–14(–28)-septate in clade 3; hila distinctly thickened, darkened, refractive, 1–2 µm diam.\n\nNotes: Screening the remaining isolates of C. cf. flagellaris, with three more genomic loci in this study (tub2, rpb2 and gapdh), clusters them into at least three distinct clades in the eight-gene phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1, part 3); clade 1 is sister to C. cf. gossypii; clade 3 is sister to C. convolvulicola and clade 2 is sister to the clade including C. cf. flagellaris clade 3 and C. convolvulicola. However, there is a high level of variation in morphological characteristics between different isolates of these three clades. In addition, several isolates originating from diverse hosts and families reside in these three clades and there is also overlap between host ranges among them. Different names can therefore be applied to these clades, and therefore we prefer to simply regard them as distinct phylogenetic species for now. To resolve their taxonomy, fresh collections authentic for the names (based on host and country) need to be recollected and included in future studies.\n\nCercospora cf. flagellaris Clade 1\n\nSpecimens examined: Fiji: on Amaranthus sp.

G based on a five-gene phylogenetic tree (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a) cluster into two distinct phylogenetic clades based on the eight-gene phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1, part 1). One, four, one, two, two, two, three and two allele groups were detected for the ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, his3, tub2, rpb2 and gapdh sequences, respectively (Table 9).\n\nCercospora sp.

Caespituli amphigenous, brown. Conidiophores aggregated in loose to dense fascicles, arising from a weakly to well-developed, intraepidermal and substomatal, brown stroma, to 50 µm diam; conidiophores pale brown to brown, 3–11-septate, straight to flexuous, simple, unbranched, uniform in width, (30–)65–105(–240) × 2.5–5 µm. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, proliferating sympodially, 10–30 × 2.5–5 µm, mono- or multi-local; loci distinctly thickened, darkened and somewhat refractive, apical or formed on shoulders caused by sympodial proliferation, 1.5–2.5 µm diam. Conidia solitary, subcylindrical, filiform to obclavate, straight to slightly curved, hyaline, (25–)75–110(–200) × 3.5–5.5 µm, (3–)8–15(–20)-septate, with subacute to subobtuse apices and truncate to obconically truncate bases; hila thickened, darkened, refractive, 1–2 µm diam.\n\nNotes: Isolates of Cercospora sp. G clustered in two distinct clades with high posterior probability in the eight-gene phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1, part 1). However, several isolates from diverse host families cluster in these two clades, to which different names can be applied. Moreover, there is also overlap between host ranges of the two clades. On the other hand, there is no morphological basis to divide them into two distinct species. Based on the gene loci screened in the present study, we were unable to resolve the taxonomy of these isolates and for now prefer to treat them as unresolved phylogenetic species. As with C. cf. fagellaris, in order to resolve their taxonomy, fresh collections from the same host and country as the original material need to be recollected and included in future studies.\n\nSpecimens examined: Iran: Zanjan Province: Tarom, Pasar, on leaves of P. major, Oct. 2011, M.

Hill (CBS 115518 = CPC 5360).\n\nIdentification of the best-performing DNA barcode\n\nKimura-2-parameter values\n\nThe Kimura-2-parameter distribution graphs (Fig. 9) visualise the inter- and intraspecific distances per locus corresponding to the barcoding gap (Hebert et al. 2003, Schoch et al. 2012). A useful barcoding locus should have no overlap between the inter- and intraspecific K2P distances and generally should have an average interspecific distance that is at least ten times as high as the average intraspecific distance of that locus (Quaedvlieg et al. 2012, Verkley et al. 2013, Stielow et al. 2015).\n\nThe eight tested loci showed varying degrees of overlap in their K2P distribution between inter- and intraspecific variation graphs (Fig. 9). In this dataset, the average interspecific variation in ITS dataset was very low (0.002) compared to its intraspecific variation (0.0005), leading to a very low inter-to intraspecific variation ratios of 4:1 for this locus (Fig. 9, Table 4). This low ratio is far below the recommended 10:1 ratio, indicating a general lack of natural variation within the ITS locus, making it ill-suited for effective identification of the individual species of Cercospora. Due to the presence of introns in the seven protein coding loci, these genes provide much higher interspecific variation than the more conserved ITS locus. These protein coding genes had K2P inter- to intraspecific variation ratios of 127:1 for tef1, 76:1 for cmdA, 74:1 for rpb2, 71:1 for tub2, 44:1 for gapdh, 15:1 for actA and 13:1 for his3 (Table 4), making them all suitable for reliable species resolution of Cercospora spp. As the tef1, cmdA, rpb2, tub2 and gapdh have the largest barcoding gap, these loci should give the highest species resolution. However, all of these genes do have overlap between the inter- and intraspecific K2P distances (as is evident in the graphs of Fig. 9), suggesting that no one of them can serve as a single ideal barcoding locus for Cercospora spp.\n\nMolecular phylogenetic resolution (clade recovery)\n\nBased on the results of the individual gene tree assessments, no single gene region was found which could reliably distinguish all species, and occurrences of the same sequence(s) shared between multiple species were observed in each locus.\n\nThe ITS phylogeny had low resolution and was only able to distinguish C. chenopodii, C. solani and C. sorghicola from the other included species. The remaining loci had different levels of resolution. The gapdh region was more effective and could resolve 61 % of 28 lineages, whereas his3, tub2, actA, tef1, cmdA and rpb2 had respectively 48, 43, 43, 39, 32 and 32 % clade recovery. Based on the gapdh region, we were able to distinguish 17 of the 28 species clades, including C. althaeina, C. armoraciae, C. bizzozeriana, C. chenopodii, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. cf. fagellaris clade 1, C. cf. fagellaris clade 2, C. cf. gossypii, C. pseudochenopodii, C. cf. richardiicola, C. rumicis, C. solani, C. sorghicola, Cercospora sp. G clade 1, Cercospora sp. G clade 2, C. violae and C. cf. zinnia; whereas, 13 species clades including C. althaeina, C. chenopodii, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. cylindracea, C. pseudochenopodii, C. cf. richardiicola, C. rumicis, C. solani, C. sorghicola, C. uwebrauniana, C. violae, C. zebrina and C. cf. zinniae were distinguished in the his3 phylogeny; 12 species clades including C. althaeina, C. chenopodii, C. conyzaecanadensis, C. cylindracea, C. iranica, C. pseudochenopodii, C. cf. richardiicola, C. solani, C. sorghicola, Cercospora sp. T, C. uwebrauniana and C. cf. zinniae were distinguished in the tub2 phylogeny; 12 species clades including C. althaeina, C. chenopodii, C. convolvulicola, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. cylindracea, C. pseudochenopodii, C. cf. richardiicola, C. solani, C. sorghicola, C. violae, C. zebrina and C. cf. zinniae were distinguished in the actA phylogeny; 11 species clades including C. bizzozeriana, C. chenopodii, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. pseudochenopodii, C. cf. richardiicola, C. rumicis, C. solani, C. sorghicola, C. uwebrauniana, C. violae and C. cf. zinniae were distinguished in the tef1 phylogeny; nine species clades including C. convolvulicola, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. iranica, C. cf. richardiicola, C. solani, C. sorghicola, Cercospora sp. T, C. violae and C. cf. zinniae were distinguished in the cmdA phylogeny; and nine species clades including C. bizzozeriana, C. chenopodii, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. pseudochenopodii, C. cf. richardiicola, C. solani, C. sorghicola, C. zebrina and C. cf. zinniae were distinguished in the rpb2 phylogeny.\n\nTherefore, the gapdh phylogeny displayed a high resolution and had the highest clade recovery and was responsible for resolving most of the cryptic taxa within C. apii, C. armoraciae, C. beticola, Cercospora sp. G, and C. cf. fagellaris."
