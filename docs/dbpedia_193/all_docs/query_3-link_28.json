        "text": "1 INTRODUCTION\n\nCercospora leaf blight (CLB) and purple seed stain (PSS), caused by Cercospora kikuchii, are important fungal diseases of soybean (Glycine max) worldwide (Ward et al., 2015). PSS symptoms manifest on infected seed as light to dark-purple discolorations that can cover part or the whole surface of the seed. CLB symptoms in the field appear as a purplish bronze blight in the upper third of the canopy during the reproductive growth stages of soybean (Ward et al., 2015). CLB and PSS are part of the late season soybean disease (LSD) complex, which is characterized by latent infections (Carmona et al., 2015).\n\nIn Argentina, the average damage caused by LSD to yield is estimated at 10%, but can reach up to 30% (Carmona et al., 2017a). However, because of the difficulty and complexity of assessing yield and economic losses caused only by CLB and PSS under field conditions, there are still no accurate estimates of yield losses in Argentina. In the USA, the average economic losses due to CLB/PSS across 28 states were estimated at $77.8 million per year between 1996 to 2016 (Bandara et al., 2020).\n\nIt is thought that C. kikuchii was introduced into South America from Asia, most probably Japan, through seed (Imazaki et al., 2006a). This proposed route of introduction is based on amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis of a collection of isolates from Japan and South America (mainly Argentina and some from Brazil). The first molecular and phylogenetic identification of C. kikuchii isolated from CLB/PSS symptoms in Argentina came from Groenewald et al. (2013). However, over the past few years additional studies using multilocus phylogenetic analyses of cercosporoid fungi isolated from soybean in Argentina, Brazil, and the USA have confirmed that CLB and PSS are associated with several cryptic species (Soares et al., 2015; Albu et al., 2016a). In South America, C. kikuchii and C. cf. sigesbeckiae have been reported to be associated with these diseases. Recently, C. cf. nicotianae was identified as one of several species in association with CLB in Bolivia (Sautua et al., 2019a), and has been confirmed for the first time to be a causal agent of CLB on soybean (Sautua et al., 2020). However, these studies focused on a limited number of isolates not representative of the major soybean-growing regions in Argentina, one of the largest soybean-producing countries in South America. Therefore, sampling a greater number of isolates from different regions of Argentina to confirm the identity of the CLB/PSS-causing species is critical.\n\nSo far, there are no LSD-resistant soybean varieties available, and crop rotation, seed treatment, and fungicide application are the only available control measures to combat these diseases (Carmona et al., 2015). In Argentina, estimates indicate that approximately half of the area planted to soybean annually (on average 17 million hectares) is treated with fungicides at least once per crop season (authors' unpublished data). Mixtures of two or three fungicide active ingredients (a.i.) from demethylation inhibitor (DMI, FRAC Code 3), quinone outside inhibitor (QoI, FRAC Code 11), and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI, FRAC Code 7) mode of action (MoA) groups are commonly used as commercial fungicide formulations sprayed during the reproductive growth stages of soybean (Carmona et al., 2011, 2017a). In Argentina, QoI fungicides in mixtures with DMI fungicides (QoI + DMI) have been applied in soybean cultivation since 2002 (Carmona et al., 2011). In comparison, methyl benzimidazole carbamates (MBC), mainly carbendazim, have been used in soybean crops over the last 30 years as the sole a.i. Lastly, SDHI fungicides were introduced to the market in 2015 as part of a triple mixture QoI + DMI + SDHI (Carmona et al., 2017b).\n\nIn Argentina there are no previous studies on fungicide sensitivity of Cercospora isolates causing CLB/PSS, except a preliminary study that determined that one single C. kikuchii isolate was sensitive (EC50 < 1 µg/ml) to four QoI + DMI commercial mixtures (Carmona et al., 2017b). In the USA, Price et al. (2015) reported QoI and MBC resistance in Cercospora isolates from Louisiana. These researchers reported that QoI fungicides were first used in Louisiana in 2000 and CLB-control failures began to appear in 2005, and were generalized from 2012 onwards. Afterwards, Albu et al. (2016b) reported that the G143A mutation in the cytochrome b gene was the cause of QoI-resistance in C. cf. flagellaris isolates from Louisiana. Sautua et al. (2019a) reported that this mutation conferred resistance to azoxystrobin in Bolivia. These are the only reports on mutations that confer resistance to QoI fungicides in this pathosystem. Dixon et al. (2020) reported that mutations F129L and G143A conferred resistance to azoxystrobin in C. nicotianae, the causal agent of frogeye leaf spot of tobacco. Imazaki et al. (2006b) reported on the E198A mutation in the β-tubulin gene as responsible for the resistance to thiophanate-methyl (MBC fungicide) in C. kikuchii observed in Japan. There are no additional studies on mutations or mechanisms that confer resistance to fungicides in C. kikuchii infecting soybean crops.\n\nSimilarly, CLB-control failures have been observed over the last 6 years in many soybean fields throughout Argentina. In these field plots, CLB intensity remained high even after being sprayed with MBC fungicides or QoI + DMI or QoI + DMI + SDHI mixtures. These observations motivated the present study to: (a) collect samples of soybean leaves and seeds displaying CLB and PSS symptoms distributed throughout Argentina and isolate cercosporoid pathogens; (b) determine the identity of the isolates using a multilocus phylogenetic approach; (c) determine the sensitivity or resistance of Cercospora isolates to DMI, MBC, QoI, and SDHI fungicides; and (d) identify the mutations associated with field resistance.\n\n2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n2.1 Fungal isolates\n\nIsolates of Cercospora spp. were obtained from soybean leaves and seeds with symptoms sampled from 2014 to 2019 from commercial soybean fields throughout Argentina and Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Samples were taken at random from different fields. Additionally, isolates of Cercospora spp. were obtained from Amaranthus hybridus with symptoms and from symptomless Araujia hortorum leaves sampled in 2019 from Bragado and San Andrés de Giles, Buenos Aires province, respectively. A.hybridus and A. hortorum leaves were sampled from soybean fields and adjacent urban areas, respectively, to examine whether these species were alternative hosts for the pathogen, and also to explore their sensitivity to fungicides. The total samples in Argentina were divided into three regions: north-west, centre, and south-east, and within each area, isolates were chosen at random. The north-east (two isolates) and west (three isolates) regions were not included as they were not equally represented. Only one isolate per seed or leaf was selected. Fungal isolation was performed according to the method described by Price et al. (2015). Isolates were maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA; Britania) at 25°C with a 16 hr light:8 hr dark cycle and preserved with three different storage methods: (a) in cryovials with sterile water at 4°C, (b) on PDA slants covered with sterile mineral oil at room temperature, and (c) in 20% glycerol at −40°C. In Argentina, Cercospora isolates had been exposed mainly to carbendazim and QoI + DMI mixtures, whereas in Bolivia they had been exposed to QoI, DMI, SDHI, MBC, and more recently to multisite fungicides such as mancozeb. Thus, for the present study, 62 Argentinian and 3 Bolivian isolates from different locations were chosen to represent surveyed areas equitably (Table S1). Of the total samples from Bolivia, an isolate of each species previously identified (Sautua et al., 2019a) was chosen at random. Thus, in total, the present study included 65 isolates for the in vitro fungicide sensitivity tests and the exploration of mutations that were associated with the observed resistance phenotypes. Of these 65 isolates, a subset of 42 isolates was chosen to perform a phylogenetic analysis to determine the species identity (Table S2).\n\n2.2 Pathogenicity tests\n\nTo confirm pathogenicity on soybean, we carried out pathogenicity tests in greenhouse assays with each isolate. The 65 isolates were inoculated onto 11 soybean varieties (DM3810, DM4214, DM4612, DM4615, DM4670, DM4915, NS4309, NS4611, NS4619iPRO, NA5009, and NA5019iPRO) that represented the most common cultivars grown in the Argentinian Pampas region. The methodology was carried out according to Sautua et al. (2020). Conidial suspensions (103 conidia/ml) from each isolate grown on soybean leaf decoction agar (Sautua et al., 2020) were sprayed on whole plants at the beginning seed stage (R5 stage; Fehr and Caviness, 1977). Spore suspensions were prepared by collecting spores from 7-day-old colonies in sterile water, with 1 ml Tween 20 (0.2%) added to facilitate the dispersal of conidia. Leaves sprayed with sterile distilled water plus Tween 20 (0.2%) served as the control. After inoculation, plants were kept in moist chambers for 24 hr. Following this initial period, plants were maintained in the greenhouse at 24 ± 3°C. The plants were closely observed on a daily basis for the detection of symptoms. This procedure was carried out until physiological maturity. The experiment was repeated twice. After detection of symptoms in inoculated leaves, these were incubated and the pathogen was reisolated. The reisolated isolates were compared with the original isolates to confirm the completion of Koch's postulates.\n\n2.3 DNA extraction\n\nFor DNA extraction, liquid cultures of isolates were initiated by placing small pieces of mycelium into 250 ml flasks containing 50 ml potato dextrose broth, prepared according to a standard recipe (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2001). The initial mycelium was carefully scraped with a sterile needle from the aerial mycelia of cultures growing on PDA plates. Liquid cultures were incubated at 24°C for 3 days in the dark with constant shaking provided by a standard shaker. After incubation, mycelia were recovered with a strainer and approximately 600 mg transferred to a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Genomic DNA was extracted following the Dellaporta protocol (Dellaporta et al., 1983). Quantification and quality control of extracted DNA was performed with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and diluted to a working concentration of 12 ng/µl.\n\n2.4 Isolate identification\n\n2.4.1 actA, cmdA, his3, tef1, and gapdh amplification and sequencing\n\nForty-two isolates were chosen to be characterized by sequencing portions of five nuclear loci: actin (actA), calmodulin (cmdA), histone 3 (his3), translation elongation factor 1-α (tef1), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh; Table S2), and aligning them with data from 379 other isolates published by Groenewald et al. (2013) and Bakhshi et al. (2018; Table S3, see Section 2.4.2). Fragments of actA, cmdA, his3, tef1, and gapdh genes were amplified from genomic DNA with the primers described in Table 1. The protocols and PCR conditions were those previously described (see references in Table 1). Additional primers were designed using Primer3 v. 4.1.0 (Untergasser et al., 2012) for either improving amplification or sequencing of cmdA of a few isolates. PCR products were purified using the Wizard PCR and Gel Cleanup System (Promega) and sequencing services were performed by Macrogen Inc. (www.macrogen.com). Sequencing reactions were carried out with the same primers as in the PCR amplifications.\n\nLocus Primer Sequence (5′–3′) Product size (bp) Annealing (°C) Amino acids Nucleotide length (bp) Region sequenced a No. introns Reference Nuclear Actin (actA) ACT-512F ATGTGCAAGGCCGGTTTCGC 300 61 375 1,553 304–530 5 Carbone and Kohn (1999) ACT-783R TACGAGTCCTTCTGGCCCAT Calmodulin (cmdA) CAL-228F GAGTTCAAGGAGCCTTCTCCC 500 55 149 754 172–471 4 Carbone and Kohn (1999) CAL737R CATCTTTCTGGCCATCATGG CAL2Rd TGRTCNGCCTCDCGGATCATCTC 500 47.5, 50.8, 54.9 172–600 Groenewald et al.

Each locus was aligned using iterative refinement methods implemented in MAFFT v. 7 (Katoh et al., 2019) with the G-INS-I algorithm, a 200 PAM/k = 2 scoring matrix, gap penalty of 1.53, and offset of 0.0. Individual locus alignments were concatenated into a multilocus alignment with data from previous studies. Sequence data of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (nrITS), actA, cmdA, his3, and tef1 published by Groenewald et al. (2013) along with data of actA, cmdA, his3, tef1, and gapdh from Bakhshi et al. (2018) were integrated with the data generated for this study. Septoria provencialis CPC_12226 was included as an out-group. The final alignment lengths and number of parsimony informative characters (PIC) were as follows: concatenated, 3,354 sites (626 PIC); nrITS, 652 sites (14 PIC); actA, 234 sites (72 PIC); cmdA, 465 sites (103 PIC); his3, 400 sites (90 PIC); tef1, 684 sites (142 PIC); gapdh, 919 sites (205 PIC). The maximum-likelihood phylogeny for each gene and the concatenated alignment were estimated using the parallel AVX version of RAxML v. 8.2.12 (Stamatakis, 2014) specifying the GTR model of nucleotide evolution and a Γ distribution on rate heterogeneity across sites. Bipartition support was estimated with 1,000 bootstrap replicates for each analysis (mpirun raxmlHPC-MPI-AVX -f a -x 12345 -p 12345 -# 1000 -m GTRGAMMA). Prior to Bayesian inference, the best-fit model of nucleotide evolution and best partitioning scheme across alignments was estimated in Partition Finder 2 (Lanfear et al., 2016), specifying the greedy algorithm (Lanfear et al., 2012) with linked branch lengths and using the corrected Akaike information criterion for selecting the best-fit model among the set of models considered for MrBayes. The models selected were SYM + I + Γ for nrITS and GTR + I + Γ for actA, cmdA, his3, tef1, and gapdh. The joint posterior distribution of parameter values and tree topologies for the concatenated, partitioned multilocus dataset was estimated in MrBayes v. 3.2.6 (Ronquist et al., 2012) with four replicate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs, four Metropolis-coupled chains per run (one cold and three heated), and 2.5 million generations per run with a sampling frequency of 1,000. Convergence was determined by observing a standard deviation of split frequencies below 0.1 and effective sample sizes (ESS) above 200 for most parameters, discarding the first 50% of samples as burn-in. The majority-rule consensus phylogeny was computed using SumTrees v. 4.3.0 in Dendropy v. 4.3.0 (Sukumaran and Holder, 2010). The bipartitions with a posterior probability equal to or greater than 0.85 were mapped, if present, to the maximum-likelihood phylogeny alongside the maximum-likelihood bootstrap support values greater than 50%. Species assignments were based on the results of the concatenated phylogenetic analyses and comparisons with each single-locus phylogenetic analysis. In order to assess the sensitivity of our results to missing data for gapdh and nrITS, we ran phylogenetic analyses that both included and excluded gapdh as well as including and excluding nrITS in the concatenated analyses and running multiple single-gene analyses. There was remarkable congruence across the analyses and no strongly supported conflict, suggesting that the missing data do not affect the phylogenetic results in a significant way.\n\n2.5 Chemicals\n\nFive DMI (cyproconazole, difenoconazole, epoxiconazole, prothioconazole, and tebuconazole), three QoI (azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin), one SDHI (boscalid), and one MBC (carbendazim) were used for sensitivity tests as technical-grade fungicides (>97% active). These fungicides were provided by Agrofina S.A. and Nova S.A. Additionally, the SDHI fungicides fluxapyroxad (Sistiva, 33.3 g a.i./100 ml, BASF Argentina S.A.) and pydiflumetofen (Miravis, 20 g a.i./100 ml SC, Syngenta Agro S.A.), and a multisite fungicide, mancozeb (Manzate Pro Stick, 75 g a.i./kg DF, UPL Argentina S.A.), were included as their commercial formulation.\n\n2.6 In vitro fungicide sensitivity testing\n\nBecause of scant sporulation in culture and following Price et al. (2015), mycelial radial growth inhibition instead of spore germination assays were used for determining fungicide sensitivity. In order to calculate the effective fungicide concentration to inhibit 50% of fungal radial growth (EC50) for each isolate × fungicide combination, all fungicides were tested on isolates 1–35 (Table S1). This set of isolates included 32 isolates from Argentina and 3 isolates from Bolivia. The Bolivian isolates were included for comparative purposes because these strains were isolated from soybean fields that received a significantly higher number of fungicide applications and are resistant to QoI fungicides (Sautua et al., 2019a). PDA plates were amended with serial dilutions of each technical and commercial grade fungicide at 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 μg/ml. Stock solutions of technical grade formulations of each fungicide were prepared at concentrations of 10 mg/ml and serially diluted in acetone. An accurate volume of 20 ml PDA was measured with a Falcon tube and dispensed into each 9 × 1.5 cm Petri dish. There were four replicates (Petri dishes) per concentration. As initial inoculum, 6 mm-diameter mycelial discs were cut from the margins of 7-day-old stock cultures of each isolate actively growing on PDA using a #3 corkborer, inverted, and transferred to amended PDA. Petri dishes were incubated under a 16 hr fluorescent and near-ultraviolet/8 hr darkness cycle at 24 ± 1°C. Non-fungicide-amended PDA served as the control. After incubation for 7 days, colony diameter was measured twice using a digital caliper. Each experiment was conducted using a randomized complete block design with incubator shelves serving as blocks. There were four replicates per isolate.\n\nIn a second set of experiments, discriminatory doses of each fungicide were used on isolates 36–65 (Table S1) in order to detect fungicide resistance. Because there are no previous studies in Argentina and there is only one previous study in the USA (Price et al., 2015), discriminatory doses of 10 and 100 μg/ml were selected based on preliminary research and according to EC50 values calculated from isolates 1 to 35 (Table S1). These experiments were conducted as described above. Isolates that were not inhibited at 100 μg/ml were considered completely resistant.\n\nBoth types of experiments (EC50 and discriminatory dose to detect sensitivity) were repeated once for cyproconazole, difenoconazole, epoxiconazole, prothioconazole, tebuconazole, carbendazim, and mancozeb, and twice for azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin, boscalid, fluxapyroxad, and pydiflumetofen.\n\n2.7 Determination of alternative respiration\n\nSome fungi possess the ability to use an alternative oxidation (AOX) pathway (Ziogas et al., 1997); however, it is not known how frequently this process may occur spontaneously in vivo. It has also been documented that the in vitro growth of QoI-resistant isolates is inhibited only in the presence of AOX inhibitors. Nevertheless, Price et al. (2015) found that propyl gallate (an AOX inhibitor) did not significantly affect radial growth of Cercospora isolates from Louisiana, USA. In order to determine whether an AOX pathway was present in Cercospora isolates chosen for the present study, the effect of salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 99% active; Alfa Aesar) was examined on six Cercospora isolates in a preliminary experiment. Isolates 1, 8, 9, 10, 31, and 32 (Table S1) were selected at random for this purpose. Serial dilutions of SHAM were made in ethanol (95%). Afterwards, PDA was amended with SHAM at 0, 30, 60, 100, and 200 μg/ml. The experiment was conducted as described in Section 2.6. Radial growth of Cercospora was significantly reduced by SHAM at 200 μg/ml (80% on average) but not at 60 μg/ml (<20% on average). Thus, assays including isolates 1–35 were conducted as in Section 2.6 to compare the effect of azoxystrobin on mycelial growth with and without the addition of SHAM to the media. SHAM was either added to a final concentration of 60 μg/ml or omitted for each concentration of fungicide. The experiment was repeated once.\n\n2.8 Sequence analysis of cytb, tub2, cyp51, and sdh genes\n\nIn order to assess DNA sequence variation between fungicide-sensitive and -resistant isolates, we amplified and sequenced fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene and the nuclear β-tubulin (tub2) gene using PCR for 64 of the 65 randomly chosen individuals and sequenced the complete genome of the C. kikuchii reference isolate ARG_18_001 (Sautua et al., 2019b). We also amplified and sequenced fragments of the sterol 14α-demethylase cytochrome P450 (cyp51) gene for 36 isolates (isolates 1–36, Table S1). Additionally, for some randomly chosen isolates, we amplified and sequenced the complete sequence of cytb, tub2, and cyp51. Furthermore, we amplified and sequenced the complete sequence of genes encoding the B, C, and D subunits of the SDHI fungicide-targeted succinate dehydrogenase enzyme (sdhB, sdhC, and sdhD) where mutations associated with SDHI resistance had been previously described in different fungi (Sierotzki and Scalliet, 2013). The summary of the loci sequenced for each isolate and used in both the phylogenetic and the mutation analyses is shown in Table S2. Primers and PCR conditions used in the present study are described in Table 1. New primers were designed for cyp51, tub2, sdhB, sdhC, and sdhD using Primer3 v. 4.1.0 (Untergasser et al., 2012). Sequencing services were performed as described previously. Multiple sequence alignment was performed for each locus using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) and including the complete sequence from the genome of isolate ARG_18_001 as a reference. Conserved loci were detected in the reference genome sequence using C. beticola sequences of each locus recovered from the NCBI against a local BLAST database. Coding regions and introns for each locus were identified by comparing with the mentioned C. beticola sequences (Sautua et al., 2019b).\n\n2.9 3-D modelling of the sterol 14α-demethylase protein\n\nIn order to locate the positions of mutations within the 3-D structure of the C. kikuchii sterol 14α-demethylase cytochrome P450 protein (CYP51), the enzyme structure was modelled by comparative protein modelling methods using the SWISS-MODEL server (http://swissmodel.expasy.org). The modelling structure of the C. kikuchii CYP51 was obtained with the 5eah.1 template (Saccharomyces cerevisiae CYP51 complexed with difenoconazole) by the On-line Swiss-model software.\n\n2.10 Data analysis\n\nDose–response curves and EC50 values were generated for each isolate × fungicide combination (isolates 1–35). Function drm() from drc package v. 2.5-12 (Ritz et al., 2015) was used in the R environment v. 3.6.3 (R Core Team, 2020) for nonlinear regression analysis. A log-logistic model, specifically a Weibull type I four-parameter model, was fitted and estimation of parameters was based on the maximum-likelihood estimate as described in Carmona et al. (2017b). Mean EC50 values and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated by combining all the data from the two (or three) experiments and using the ED() function of the drc package. A normality test for EC50 values was performed using the Shapiro–Wilk test of normality with the stats package of R. In all cases, data were non-normally distributed. Therefore, a Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance was used with the stats package in R to assess for significant differences among distributions of EC50 values for the different fungicides. Dunn's multiple comparison test was used post hoc to compare distributions among fungicide a.i. (p = .05) with the dunnTest() function of the FSA package in R (Ogle et al., 2019). For AOX analysis, mean EC50 values (or growth inhibition values at 100 µg/ml if EC50 values could not be estimated due to resistance) for SHAM-amended PDA and nonamended PDA were compared using a two-sample t test with the stats package in R.\n\n4 DISCUSSION\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study in Argentina investigating sensitivity of Cercospora species causing CLB/PSS to technical and commercial grade fungicides from different MoA groups. In total, 65 Cercospora isolates were tested, and were highly resistant to QoI, and half of these isolates were highly resistant to carbendazim. Similarly, Cercospora isolates were reported resistant to QoI and MBC fungicides in Louisiana, USA (Price et al., 2015). All isolates tested here were insensitive to SDHI fungicides. In contrast, all tested isolates were sensitive to the DMI fungicides, except for one C. kikuchii isolate from Bolivia (BOL_17_035).\n\nAll QoI molecules tested (azoxystrobin, trifloxystrobin, and pyraclostrobin) were ineffective against all isolates, indicating that these isolates possess cross-resistance to multiple QoI fungicides. It was not possible to test picoxystrobin in this study, but we speculate that it would most likely exhibit a similar response against the Cercospora isolates tested here, as cross-resistance was reported in the in vitro tests, and field observations from location Alejo Ledesma, where isolates 49–56 were recovered, showed that plots were heavily infected with CLB/PSS after being treated twice with a picoxystrobin + cyproconazole mixture (300 ml/ha).\n\nIn general, QoI-resistance and MBC-resistance in ascomycetes are usually caused by mutations in the cytb and tub2 genes, respectively (Imazaki et al., 2006a). In the present study, we identified the most frequently found mutations that are known to confer resistance to QoIs and MBCs in the majority of tested isolates.\n\nIn Argentina, the G143A mutation in the cytb gene was the only one found in most of the isolates tested that contributed to the field control failures of CLB treated with QoIs, and a similar situation in USA and Bolivia has been observed (Price et al., 2015; Sautua et al., 2019a). No other known mutations, such as the F129L and G137R (Sierotzki, 2015), were identified in this gene among the 65 sequenced isolates. The G143A mutation is the most frequent mutation associated with resistance to QoI fungicides in plant pathogens (Sierotzki, 2015). However, although all isolates tested were resistant to all QoIs, we only detected the G143A mutation in the cytb gene in 82% of these isolates. Thus, it might be possible that factor(s) other than target-site modification are involved in the resistance of Cercospora species to QoI fungicides. For example, Vielba-Fernández et al. (2018) recently reported on the role of mitochondrial heteroplasmy for the cytb gene in Podosphaera xanthii as a mechanism explaining resistance to QoIs. Their findings suggest that the proportion of G143 and A143 alleles in an isolate may determine the QoI resistance level.\n\nSimilarly, in this study the E198A mutation in the tub2 gene was present in 31 of 32 (97%) isolates resistant to carbendazim. No other mutation was found in the full-length sequence of tub2, suggesting that mechanism(s) other than fungicide target-site modification may confer resistance to carbendazim. In Japan, MBC-resistance was attributed to the E198A mutation only, as 154 of 247 (62.3%) isolates of C. kikuchii were highly resistant to thiophanate-methyl (MBC) and the 12 resistant isolates that were sequenced possessed the E198A mutation (Imazaki et al., 2006b).\n\nOn the other hand, boscalid, fluxapyroxad, and pydiflumetofen were ineffective against all isolates tested here. For instance, at 10 µg/ml boscalid and fluxapyroxad/pydiflumetofen had an average inhibition percentage of 9%, 11%, and 20% in the 62 Argentinian Cercospora isolates, respectively, whereas Corynespora cassiicola isolates from cucumber in Japan highly resistant to boscalid had EC50 values from 8.9 to 10.7 µg/ml (Miyamoto et al., 2010). The H278Y and H278R mutations in the sdhB subunit were responsible for the resistance (Miyamoto et al., 2010). However, in the present study, no mutations were found in the complete sequence of the sdhB, sdhC, and sdhD genes of the sequenced isolates. Moreover, in Argentina SDHI fungicides have only recently begun to be applied on soybean crops. These fungicides are used with low frequency and always mixed with QoI and/or DMI fungicides. Although the SDHI began to be used in soybean fields in Argentina in 2015, currently, the application of these a.i. represent approximately 3%–4% of the total area planted to soybean or 7%–8% of the total area applied with fungicides. Therefore, the Cercospora isolates found insensitive were only exposed in the field to SDHI for a couple of years. It would be unlikely that a resistance mechanism developedafter being exposed briefly to these fungicides. Therefore, we hypothesize that Cercospora species are insensitive (naturally resistant) to SDHI fungicidesin vitro because of unknown factors. Our results are in line with those reported by Nikou et al. (2009), who tested different fungicides on the in vitro mycelial growth of C. beticola and found that boscalid had the lowest fungitoxicity, with an average inhibition percentage of 22% (1.7%–39%) at 5 µg/ml. Recently, Ishii et al. (2016) reported that isolates of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, C. cereale, and C. orbiculare tested insensitive to SDHI fungicides (boscalid, fluxapyroxad, and fluopyram). In that study, authors sequenced the sdhB, sdhC, and sdhD genes but did not find mutations associated with SDHI resistance. Consequently, these authors proposed that Colletotrichum species are insensitive or naturally resistant to SDHI. These results are similar to those presented here for Cercospora. Future studies such as in vitro and in vivo inhibition tests involving more Cercospora isolates and different SDHI a.i. should seek to test this hypothesis. In order to fully confirm the insensitivity of Cercospora to SDHI, it is important to establish the relationship between in vitro inhibition assays and CLB/PSS control efficacy in field trials. Secondly, to rule out that mechanisms other than point mutations could confer resistance to SDHI, genome-wide association approaches could help identify different mechanisms that could generate resistance to certain fungicides.\n\nThe C. kikuchii CYP51 protein is coded by a 1,632 bp intron-free gene with homology to other fungal cyp51 genes and is present as a single copy in the C. kikuchii genome (Sautua et al., 2019b). Polymorphisms were detected in the partial sequences of the cyp51 gene sequenced from the 36 isolates tested here, and none of the SNPs corresponded to any mutation known in Cercospora or other genera of phytopathogenic fungi that confers resistance to DMI. In the present study, the lowest average EC50 value corresponded to difenoconazole, which only began to increase in use in recent growing seasons and in mixtures with SDHI or QoI fungicides. In contrast, we have detected higher EC50 values for cyproconazole, the most commonly used DMI fungicide in the history of soybean production in Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil (Carmona et al., 2017a). This indicates a loss of sensitivity of the Cercospora populations in Argentina towards this particular DMI molecule. Nevertheless, all isolates were sensitive to all DMI molecules tested, except for a single C. kikuchii isolate from Bolivia, which was resistant to some DMI molecules. Two new mutations were identified in the cyp51 gene for this Bolivian isolate, conferring nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions I387M and D440N. Neither of these match the mutations that correspond to previously reported amino acid polymorphisms associated with DMI resistance in C. beticola (E169, I330T, P384S, E297K; Nikou et al., 2009). However, because these mutations are solely present in the only DMI-resistant isolate, we speculate that they may be involved in the loss of sensitivity to cyproconazole, tebuconazole, and prothioconazole (EC50 values equal to 45.8, 10, and 6 µg/ml, respectively). Resistance could be attributed to this mutation, but future experiments and analysis should confirm this hypothesis as mechanisms other than single-site mutations in the cyp51 gene could also be involved in the DMI resistance observed in the Bolivian isolate.\n\nMultisite fungicides have been widely used in horticulture for many years, and during the last 10 years their use has increased significantly in Brazil to control soybean rust (Phakopsora pachyrhizi; Carmona et al., 2017a). Even though the risk of developing resistance to mancozeb is considered low (Carmona et al., 2018), the appearance of several tolerant or resistant fungal species on various crops has been reported (Yang et al., 2019). We cannot confirm that the Cercospora species evaluated here should be considered resistant or naturally insensitive to mancozeb, because mancozeb has never been used on soybean for the control of any disease in Argentina.\n\nOur findings suggest that QoI-resistance is widespread in Argentinian Cercospora populations causing CLB/PSS, as all of the populations tested appear to be composed of strobilurin-resistant individuals and the G143A mutation is present in the majority of the isolates collected from soybean and from alternative hosts such as A. hybridus and A. hortorum. Likewise, half of the tested isolates were highly resistant to carbendazim, suggesting that resistance to this fungicide is spreading in Cercospora populations as well. Moreover, this confirms that isolates of the Argentinian population of Cercospora are harbouring multiple amino acid substitutions that confer resistance to fungicides with different modes of action, which may have implications when mixes of fungicide a.i. are applied. Secondly, SDHI fungicides are a special case for which we propose that the Cercospora species evaluated here are insensitive (naturally resistant)in vitro. Similarly, mancozeb, an example of a multisite fungicide, only exhibited complete inhibition of mycelial growth at 100 µg/ml. Consequently, it was only possible to establish the in vitro baseline sensitivity of Cercospora isolates causing CLB/PSS to five DMIs and carbendazim. This is the first fungicide sensitivity study to be carried out for Cercospora species causing CLB/PSS of soybean in Argentina. Therefore, we tested several isolates and technical- and commercial-grade fungicides. The EC50 values estimated in this work represent the baseline fungicide sensitivity to DMI and carbendazim, as there are no isolates available from previous years. The results presented herein will be useful to guide detection and evaluation of sensitivity shifts in Cercospora populations towards these fungicides during subsequent years. Finally, further studies are needed to (a) fully elucidate the basis of different molecular mechanisms that may be involved in the resistance to QoI, MBC, and DMI fungicides; (b) confirm insensitivity or natural resistance to SDHI; and (c) confirm the lack of fungitoxicity of mancozeb in Cercospora."
