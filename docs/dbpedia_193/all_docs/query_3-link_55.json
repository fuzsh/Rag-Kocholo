        "text": "Advertisement\n\nIdentification\n\nThe initial symptoms are small water-soaked spots on the upper and lower leaf surfaces. As the lesions expand, they are delimited by leaf veins, which give them an angular appearance. In most cases, the lesions become dark brown. However, under dry conditions they may be lighter in color. The close proximity of seedlings and the environmental conditions in the seedbed at that time (hot and rainy weather) contribute to rapid development of the disease.\n\nLesions may coalesce to cover large areas of an infected leaf, but rarely appear on leaf petioles. Bacterial blight lesions appear similar to lesions caused by the early blight fungus (Cercospora apii), but are typically smaller, darker in color, and have a more water-soaked appearance. The margin of the lesions are more distinct than that of early blight, and chlorosis occurs more slowly. In addition, fungal growth may be observed on early blight lesions under favorable conditions.\n\nBrown stem is a petiole necrosis of celery caused by the same pathogen. Unlike bacterial blight, which is present every year, brown stem is more sporadic, appearing every five or six years. When it does occur, however, it can be severely damaging to the celery crop. Brown stem causes more curling and stalk rot than bacterial blight. The principal symptom of brown stem is a brown discoloration over the entire petiole. Although brown streaks may be seen along the whole petiole, the base of the stalk receives the greatest amount of damage. Symptoms intensify closer to harvest as the plant approaches maturity.\n\nSurvival And Spread\n\nBacterial blight is favored by warm and humid conditions, and might be difficult to control during wet weather. The bacteria can be spread from plant to plant by rain, irrigation, or on machinery and people. Symptoms appear within days of the bacteria entering a plantâ€™s tissue through natural openings or wounds. The reasons for the sporadic appearance of brown stem outbreaks are unknown, but are thought to be related to unusually wet winters with high humidity, frequent rainfall, and windy conditions.\n\nManagement Methods"
