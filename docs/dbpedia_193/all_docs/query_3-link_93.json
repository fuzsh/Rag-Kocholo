        "text": "Cercospora leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cercospora beticola Sacc., is the most serious and important foliar disease of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) wherever it is grown worldwide. Cercospora leaf spot first caused economic damage in North Dakota and Minnesota in 1980, and the disease is now endemic. This is the largest production area for sugar beet in the United States, producing 5.5 to 6.0 million metric tons on approximately 300,000 ha, which is 56% of the sugar beet production in the United States. This Plant Disease feature article details a cooperative effort among the participants in the sugar beet industry in this growing area and represents a successful collaboration and team effort to confront and change a fungicide resistance crisis to a fungicide success program. As a case study of success for managing fungicide resistance, it will serve as an example to other pathogen–fungicide systems and provide inspiration and ideas for long-term disease management by fungicides.\n\nSUMMARY Four sugar beet cultivars exhibiting increasing levels of rate-reducing resistance towards Cercospora beticola (&#x27;Cyrano&#x27; or &#x27;Univers&#x27;, &#x27;Bushel&#x27;, &#x27;Monodoro&#x27;, and &#x27;Break&#x27;) were used in monocyclic infection experiments to study the following resistance components: incuba- tion length (IP, the degree-day cumulation, base 5°C, during the time between inoculation and appearance of spots), infection efficiency of conidia (INF, the number of necrotic spots per cm2 of leaf at the end of a single in- fection cycle), and lesion size (LS, the area of single spots). All the resistance components were influenced by cultivar significantly; whereas no differences in lesion type were found. Resistance delayed the appearance of spots by a maximum of 12 days compared to the sus- ceptible cultivar. IP50 was delayed by a degree-day cu- mulation of 28°C, 60°C and 100°C in &#x27;Bushel&#x27;, &#x27;Mono- doro&#x27;, and &#x27;Break&#x27;, respectiv...\n\nThis investigation was carried out on commercial organic field in the Fayoum Governorate of Egypt under conditions of natural infection, 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 to evaluate the effectiveness of four commercial biocides-Blight Stop (Trichoderma harzianum), Bio Zeid (T. album), Root Guard (Bacillus subtilis), and Bio ARC (B. megaterium)-as well as, four biocontrol agents (T. harzianum, T. album, B. subtilis, and B. megaterium) in controling Cercospora beticola Sacc, the main causal of Cercospra leaf spot (CLS) disease on sugar beet in an organic farming systems. All biocontrol agents and commercial biocides sprayed at the recommended dose in a two spray regime with 15 days between sprays, were significantly reduced Cercospora beticola, total amino acid and juice impurities (K, Na and α-a N %) in comparison to control treatment. All bioagents and biocides put to the test resulted in a significant rise in phenolic compound values, total chlorophyll, sucrose (%), purity (%), root, top and sugar yield quality of sugar beet during both seasons. Spraying Blight Stop was the most effective treatment followed by T. harzianum. B. megaterium was the least effective biocide treatment compared with the control treatment during the two growing seasons.\n\nThe complex inheritance of resistance to Cercospora leaf spot (CLS), the most severe fungal foliar disease in sugar beet, was investigated by means of quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. Over a three year period, recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), generated through a cross between lines resistant (&#39;NK-310mm-O&#39;) and susceptible (&#39;NK-184mm-O&#39;) to CLS, were field-tested for their resistance to the pathogen. Composite interval mapping (CIM) showed four QTL involved in CLS resistance to be consistently detected. Two resistant QTL (qcr1 on chromosome III, qcr4 on chromosome IX) bearing &#39;NK-310mm-O&#39; derived alleles promoted resistance. Across 11 investigations, the qcr1 and qcr4 QTL explained approximately 10% and over 20%, respectively, of the variance in the resistance index. Two further QTL (qcr2 on chromosome IV, qcr3 on chromosome VI) bearing &#39;NK-184mm-O&#39; derived alleles each explained about 10% of the variance. To ide...\n\nThe breeding of sugar beet varieties that combine resistance to Cercospora and high yield under non-diseased conditions is a major challenge to the breeder. The understanding of the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) contributing to Cercospora resistance offers one route to solving this problem. A QTL analysis of Cercospora resistance in sugar beet was carried out using a linkage map based on AFLP and RFLP markers. Two different screening methods for Cercospora resistance (a field test at Copparo, Italy, under natural infection, and a newly-developed leaf disc test) were used to estimate the level of Cercospora resistance; the correlation between scores from the field (at 162 days after sowing) and the leaf disc test was significant. QTL analysis was based on F2 and F3 (half-sib family) generations derived from crosses between diploid single plants of 93164P (resistant to Cercospora leaf spot disease) and 95098P (susceptible). Four QTLs associated with Cercospora resistance (based on Lsmean data of the leaf disc test) on chromosomes III, IV, VII and IX were revealed using Composite interval mapping. To produce populations segregating for leaf spot resistance as a single Mendelian factor, we selected for plants heterozygous for only one of the QTLs (on chromosome IV or IX) but homozygous for the others.\n\nIn this study, we attempt to optimize the use of strobilurin fungicides by testing the efficacy of azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin under field conditions, by testing for the most efficient partners in fungicide mixtures, and by testing control efficacy of strobilurin fungicides applied at several application times to determine the better options for disease management. Results showed that trifloxystrobin was the most efficient strobilurin fungicide, followed by pyraclostrobin. Azoxystrobin provided a modest to poor control efficacy, whereas kresoxim-methyl provided only poor disease control efficacy. Mixtures of azoxystrobin and trifloxystrobin with either chlorothalonil or maneb and difenoconazole or flutriafol were tested for their efficacy in controlling the disease. The results showed that the azoxystrobin-containing mixtures provided significantly better control compared with that obtained by single applications of each mixture component. The ..."
