        "text": "During on-farm visits and one-on-one meetings with growers, crop\n\nconsultants, and Extension agents in southern Florida, early\n\nblight, caused by the fungal pathogen Cercospora apii,\n\nemerged as the most important foliar disease affecting celery\n\nproduction (Xavier 2022, personal communication). Florida plays a\n\ncrucial role as a major producer of vegetables for the fresh\n\nmarket, including celery, supplying the nationwide demand during\n\nthe winter season. However, the detrimental effects of this\n\ndisease, characterized by stunted plant growth and damaged\n\nleaves, pose a significant threat to the marketability of the\n\nfinal product. To mitigate these yield losses, celery growers\n\nrely on weekly fungicide applications as a preventive measure,\n\nprimarily due to the absence of alternative curative or\n\npreventive measures. Therefore, there exists a critical need to\n\nidentify and establish sustainable management strategies for\n\nC. apii. Failure to address the need for sustainable\n\nmanagement of early blight on celery production will result in\n\nsignificant yield losses, reduced marketability, increased\n\nchemical fungicide use, environmental and health risks, economic\n\nstrain on growers, and potential dissatisfaction among consumers,\n\nposing threats to both the celery industry and the environment.\n\nOur long-term goal is to develop sustainable and future-proof\n\nsolutions for controlling early blight in both conventional and\n\norganic celery production systems. Our overarching goal is to\n\ncreate both an early detection system and biocontrol products\n\nagainst early blight on celery. Our central hypothesis is that it\n\nis feasible to develop and implement more efficient,\n\nenvironmentally sustainable, and socially beneficial management\n\nstrategies for early blight in celery production, resulting in\n\neconomic advantages for growers. We are well-positioned to lead\n\nthis project based on our 56-year partnership with celery\n\nstakeholders in Florida, our access to cutting-edge technologies,\n\nand our interdisciplinary team of experts. Moreover, our\n\ndedication to community engagement ensures we understand local\n\nconcerns and needs, building trust vital for project success. We\n\nplan to attain the overall objective by pursuing the following\n\ntwo specific aims: 1) Develop a UAV-assisted disease monitoring\n\nsystem to visualize and track disease onset and progression in\n\ncelery. Our working hypothesis is that current\n\nmachine/deep-learning algorithms have the capability to\n\naccurately identify celery plants infected with C. apii.\n\nCombining these algorithms with previously established C.\n\napii forecasting models will yield an effective\n\ndecision-making system for growers. 2) Identify, select, and\n\nevaluate effective biological control agents against C.\n\napii for the management of early blight in celery. Our\n\nworking hypothesis is that the Everglades Agricultural Area\n\nharbors a reservoir of powerful microorganisms with the capacity\n\nto effectively control C. apii. Economic analysis will\n\nguide the timing and optimization of the deployment of\n\ncontrolling measures, ensuring a cost-effective approach for\n\ngrowers. Upon the successful completion of this project, it is\n\nour expectation that we will have established novel, economically\n\nadvantageous, and safe strategies for early detection of early\n\nblight, advancing sustainable agriculture. This project offers\n\nachievable and practical solutions for celery growers that, if\n\nadopted, can enhance disease management practices, leading to\n\nimproved production outcomes and the overall ecosystem health.\n\nOur central hypothesis revolves around the notion that more\n\neffective and sustainable management of Cercospora early blight\n\nin celery is not only attainable but also economically\n\nadvantageous. Below, we delineate four specific objectives, along\n\nwith their corresponding working hypotheses, research design, and\n\nanticipated outcomes.\n\nObjective 1: Develop a UAV-assisted disease\n\nmonitoring system to visualize and track disease onset and\n\nprogression in celery. (Drs. Xavier, Ferreira, and Wang’s\n\nsupervision).\n\nWorking hypothesis: Celery plants undergoing pre-symptomatic\n\nstages of early blight have a distinctive spectral profile.\n\nCurrent machine/deep-learning algorithms have the capability to\n\naccurately identify celery plants infected with C. apii.\n\nCombining these algorithms with previously established C.\n\napii forecasting models will yield an effective\n\ndecision-making system for growers.\n\nResearch design: Our experiment will focus on the early detection\n\nof Cercospora early blight of celery, specifically at\n\npre-symptomatic stages. To achieve this, we will employ an\n\ninnovative disease monitoring system using AI-powered Unmanned\n\nAerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multispectral cameras\n\nExpected outcome: Substantial reductions in fungicide usage in\n\nboth organic and conventional cultivation systems, coupled with\n\nenhanced control over Cercospora early blight.\n\nObjective 2: Identify, select, and evaluate\n\neffective biological control agents against C. apii for\n\nthe management of early blight in celery. (Dr. Ferreira and\n\nXavier’s supervision).\n\nWorking hypothesis: The EAA harbors a reservoir of powerful\n\nmicroorganisms with the capacity to effectively control C.\n\napii.\n\nResearch design: We will employ a comprehensive research approach\n\nthat spans laboratory, greenhouse, and on-farm field trials. This\n\nmultifaceted strategy will enable us to identify, assess, and\n\nvalidate potential biological control agents effective against\n\nC. apii.\n\nExpected outcome: A biopesticide product effective at commercial\n\ncelery production, and consequently reduction of contamination by\n\nreducing chemical fungicide use.\n\nObjective 3: Develop an economic analysis for\n\norganic and conventional growers to manage Cercospora early\n\nblight based on standard and new management practices. (Dr.\n\nGuan’s supervision)\n\nWorking hypothesis: The proposed solutions proposed are\n\ncost-effective, yielding a positive economic impact for growers\n\nwho adopt these technologies.\n\nResearch design: Economic analysis will be performed for the five\n\nfield trials to be conducted at this proposed project, comparing\n\nstandard management practices used by growers and the new ones\n\ndeveloped in this proposal. The goal is to provide growers with a\n\ncost-benefit analysis to evaluate the profitability of the\n\nproposed management practices.\n\nExpected outcome: Empowerment of our approach, facilitating its\n\nadoption among growers, and attracting new growers who recognize\n\nthe economic benefits of implementing these practices.\n\nObjective 4: Disseminate research findings and\n\neducate growers about the benefits of biocontrol and UAV\n\ntechnology via events and written publications. (MS Meszaros and\n\nDr. Xavier’s supervision).\n\nWorking hypothesis: Individuals and institutions already engaged\n\nin the celery business will be interested in improving their\n\ndisease management practices, particularly when they discern the\n\npotential economic gains.\n\nExpected outcome: Increased awareness of improved C.\n\napii management practices as well as adoption of the\n\nproposed solutions among celery growers, enabling them, workers,\n\nand society at large to seize of potential benefits provided by\n\neach solution."
