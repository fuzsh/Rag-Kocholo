        "text": "Former Michigan State and Los Angeles Lakers basketball star Magic Johnson took to social media following the death of NBA legend Kobe Bryant.\n\n\"As I try to write this post, my mind is racing,\" Johnson said in the first of a series of tweets. \"I’m in disbelief and have been crying all morning over this devastating news that Kobe and his young daughter, Gigi have passed away in a helicopter crash. Cookie and I are heartbroken.\"\n\nCookie is Johnson's wife.\n\n\"I love him, his family and what he stood for on the court and off the court,\" Johnson said next.\n\n\"My friend, a legend, husband, father, son, brother, Oscar winner and greatest Laker of all-time is gone,\" he said. \"It’s hard to accept. Kobe was a leader of our game, a mentor to both male and female players.\"\n\nJohnson went on to praise Bryant's accomplishments and the impact he made on the basketball world.\n\n\"He gave his knowledge, time, and talent to tutor so many at the youth level, collegiate level, & NBA & WNBA players,\" Johnson wrote. \"Words can’t express the impact that he had on the game of basketball. I know basketball fans all over the world will miss him, especially the City of Los Angeles.\"\n\nJohnson next acknowledged Bryant's tributes to women's basketball and the city of Los Angeles.\n\n\"He was such an icon but also did so much for LA,\"Johnson said. \"He was passionate about serving the homeless and was an advocate for women's basketball. Coaching his daughter’s basketball team brought him so much happiness.\"\n\n\"Kobe and I shared so many special conversations about life and basketball,\" Johnson tweeted. \"We had so much in common off the court. I used to love talking to him about Lakers basketball, being fathers and husbands and how much we loved Italy. I will miss those conversations and him so much.\"\n\n\"Laker Nation, the game of basketball & our city, will never be the same without Kobe,\" Johnson said before sharing his love and prayers for the Bryant family. \"Cookie & I are praying for Vanessa, his beautiful daughters Natalia, Bianka & Capri, as well as his parents Joe & Pam & his sisters. We will always be here for the Bryant family.\"\n\nJohnson ended the series of tweets with the final statement: \"We love you forever. #8 #24\"\n\nTMZ first reported Sunday that Bryant had died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, Ca. The LA County Sheriff's department announced in a press conference that nine people total died in the accident.\n\nBryant spent his entire 20 year career in the NBA with the Lakers. Johnson played for the Lakers for 13 seasons, and then later served as coach and president of basketball operations for the franchise."
