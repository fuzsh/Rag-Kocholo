        "text": "New details continue to emerge about the helicopter crash that killed NBA legend Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others in Calabasas, California, on Sunday afternoon.\n\nAs fans mourn the sudden death of one of the NBA's iconic athletes, authorities are still in the early stages of investigating the crash and its potential causes — a process that could take several weeks.\n\nMultiple federal agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, have joined local authorities in their efforts to understand what caused the helicopter to slam into a hillside, killing all nine people aboard.\n\nKOBE BRYANT COVERAGE: Get the updates delivered to your inbox. Sign up here\n\nHere are the latest details on the crash, as of Monday.\n\nNTSB updates first day of investigating Kobe Bryant crash\n\nNTSB board member Jennifer Homendy told reporters Monday evening the helicopter took off from John Wayne Airport. Near Burbank, the pilot requested a special visual flight rule, which had to be authorized by an air traffic controller. It allows an aircraft to proceed in controlled airspace at less than the basic visual flight rule, which includes a minimum flight ceiling of 1,000 feet and 3 miles of visibility.\n\nWhile awaiting that approval, the helicopter circled for 12 minutes, then the special visual flight rule go-ahead was given.\n\nThe aircraft then went south and west at 1,400 feet, Homendy said. The pilot requested flight following from air traffic control but was informed the helicopter was flying too low for that to be possible. Flight following is ongoing surveillance information assistance from air traffic control and could include situational awareness and location of nearby aircraft.\n\nInvestigators determined the helicopter had climbed to 2,300 feet and began turning left. The last radar contact was 9:45 a.m. PT. and is \"consistent with the accident location.\"\n\nHomendy said no cause of the crash had been determined and that a cause would likely not be identified this week. She was confident the investigation will yield the root of the accident.\n\nThe pilot had a commercial certificate and was also a flight instructor. As of July 2019 he had accrued 8,200 hours of flight time. “It’s an experienced pilot,” Homendy said.\n\nExtensive debris field, no black box\n\nHomendy said the impact crater is 1,085 feet above sea level. The debris field is about 500-600 feet wide, Homendy said.\n\n“It was a pretty devastating accident scene,” Homendy said.\n\nThere was no black box and no requirement to have one aboard the aircraft, according to Homendy. An iPad that had flight assistance applications on it has been recovered.\n\nCrash site being monitored\n\n“We’ve had an inordinate amount of interest in the crash site,” LA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said.\n\nPolice had to deter citizens Sunday who arrived at the site. Officers are patrolling the rugged terrain on horseback, Villanueva said, and it is a misdemeanor for anyone to trespass the perimeter.\n\nThe coroner’s office began recovering human remains Sunday night, Villanueva said. That process is still ongoing. The sheriff's department has been in contact with the victims' families, but Villanueva did not publicly name any of the victims, including Bryant.\n\nNBA postpones Lakers-Clippers game\n\nThe NBA announced it has postponed Tuesday's game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers, in the wake of Bryant's death.\n\n\"The decision was made out of respect for the Lakers organization, which is deeply grieving the tragic loss of Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven other people in a helicopter crash on Sunday,\" the league said in a statement.\n\nThe NBA added that the game will be rescheduled at a later date.\n\nESPN to re-air Bryant's final game\n\nESPN is honoring Bryant's death by rebroadcasting the final game of his NBA career at 9 p.m. ET on Monday night, the network announced.\n\nBryant scored 60 points in that 2016 game, against the Utah Jazz, and played 42 minutes in the Los Angeles Lakers' 101-96 win that night.\n\nAll victims' identities now known\n\nLos Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva declined to immediately name the nine victims of the crash Sunday, but six have now been identified through official channels, and three by family members or news outlets.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver confirmed the deaths of Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, known as \"GiGi,\" in a statement. Orange Coast College confirmed that its baseball coach, John Altobelli, his wife, Keri, and one of their two daughters, Alyssa, were also aboard the helicopter.\n\nThe other victims were Christina Mauser, an assistant girls basketball coach, and Sarah Chester and her daughter, Payton. The pilot has been identified by multiple news reports as Ara Zobayan.\n\nWas weather a factor in the crash?\n\nAuthorities are still investigating potential causes of the crash, but foggy conditions might have played a role.\n\nVillanueva said low clouds and fog in the area prompted the sheriff's office to ground its helicopters Sunday morning. The Los Angeles Police Department took similar precautions.\n\n\"We do know there was an issue with visibility and a low ceiling,\" Villanueva said Sunday evening. \"The actual conditions at the time of impact, that is still yet to be determined.\"\n\nShawn Coyle, an experienced helicopter pilot and expert witness on accidents, said the decision to fly in fog might have contributed to the crash.\n\n\"With an aircraft like that, that’s capable of flying on airways, why they would be flying in bad weather’s got to be in question,\" Coyle said.\n\nWhat do we know about the helicopter?\n\nThe helicopter in the crash was a Sikorsky S-76B that was manufactured in 1991, according to FAA records. It was owned by Island Express Holding Corp., a helicopter flight charter business.\n\nLockheed Martin acquired Sikorsky Aircraft in 2015, and all five branches of the U.S. military use its helicopters in some capacity. The company offered condolences to those affected by the crash and pledged to investigate.\n\nThere were no immediate indications as of Monday morning that defects or systems failures caused the crash.\n\nIt appears that Bryant had used this particular helicopter with some regularity. Its tail number matches that of a helicopter in an April 2016 Getty Images photo, which shows Bryant boarding the chopper to travel to his final NBA game.\n\nWhy was Bryant traveling by helicopter?\n\nBryant traveled frequently by helicopter, both during his NBA career and afterward. As a player, he regularly used a helicopter to avoid two-hour travel times through L.A.’s traffic while also keeping his body fresh.\n\n\"Sexy as it might seem, Bryant says the helicopter is just another tool for maintaining his body,\" J.R. Moehringer wrote for GQ magazine in 2010. \"It’s no different than his weights or his whirlpool tubs or his custom-made Nikes. Given his broken finger, his fragile knees, his sore back and achy feet, not to mention his chronic agita, Bryant can’t sit in a car for two hours.\"\n\nBryant's helicopter travel continued in retirement, as he focused on creative endeavors and spent time coaching his daughter's basketball team.\n\nMore on the shocking loss of Kobe Bryant\n\nHere's more coverage of tributes and more after the tragic passing of Bryant:\n\nMark Medina reflects on the conversation he had with Bryant earlier this month about his post-playing days, and his future.\n\nThe NBA did not seriously consider canceling Sunday's slate of games.\n\nShock and sadness overcame those at Bryant's Mamba Sports Academy on Sunday\n\nKobe Bryant's death had Grammy attendees reeling\n\nDallas Mavericks will retire Bryant's No. 24\n\nFans at Kobe's high school alma mater mourn loss of star\n\nCarmelo Anthony, Doc Rivers, Derek Jeter, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Jerry West were among those offering condolences and tributes\n\nContributing: John Bacon, Nathan Bomey, Cheri Carlson, Kristin Lam, Mark Medina, Josh Peter, Chris Woodyard and Jeff Zillgitt"
