        "text": "This week, a ceremony was held in Los Angeles in remembrance of basketball legend Kobe Bryant, who tragically passed away in a helicopter crash this past January. The ceremony helped to highlight the impact that Kobe's death has had on people across the world.\n\nNearly a month has passed since the shocking news that he, his 13-year-old daughter Giana, and seven other lives came to an abrupt end. To this day, the event is still a main topic of conversation on social media.\n\nIt seems that Kobe had a connection to people from all walks of life. For many, he signified strength; a tireless competition driven to achieve greatness in all of his pursuits. Kobe is a household name. People have mourned his death as if they’d lost a family member.\n\nPersonally, I became familiar with Kobe Bryant as a student at my undergraduate institution, where he frequently visited. He loved engaging with students, buying people an In-N-Out burger, and playing basketball at the gymnasium. He was special, and held a special place in the hearts of everyone he touched.\n\nI was devastated to hear of his loss, but came to view his death as a symbol of something beautiful; something that should be carried as a lesson to all of us.\n\nLife is short and beautiful. Kobe was blessed with otherworldly athletic talent. He was beloved. He had comfort in his wealth. Despite all of his good fortune, however, he passed away in an accident.\n\nDeath does not discriminate.\n\nKobe’s death has served as a daily reminder that — no matter our circumstances — at the end of the day we are all equals. We must realize that life is too precious to waste.\n\nToo often we spend our time worrying about the future and forget to live in the present. We take for granted each and every day. We overlook our families and friends, assuming they’ll be here tomorrow. We hold grudges. We complain about anything that doesn’t go our way.\n\nWhile Kobe’s death is tragic and devastating to many, his memory should serve as a reminder to enjoy life to its fullest.\n\nWe can get through our worst times. We should hold on to the beautiful things in life. We should appreciate our bad days as rough patches on a magnificent journey. Life is full of ups and downs and we have to enjoy every minute of it. We never know which minute may be our last.\n\nWhether it’s a day in medical school or a day in the real world, life should not be taken too seriously. Never forget to live. Too often people spend a lifetime worrying, only to realize — often too late — that their worries were a waste.\n\nNo matter who you are or what stage you are in life, take a moment to enjoy the moment you are in. Reflect on all that you have to be thankful for.\n\nLet go of your grudges. Spread love."
