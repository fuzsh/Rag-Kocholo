        "text": "Larry Bird (born December 7, 1956, West Baden, Indiana, U.S.) is an American basketball player who led the Boston Celtics to three National Basketball Association (NBA) championships (1981, 1984, and 1986) and is considered one of the greatest pure shooters of all time.\n\nBird was raised in French Lick, Indiana, and attended Indiana State University, where he helped revive the basketball program and led the team to a 33–1 record in his senior season. That season ended with a loss to Michigan State University in the NCAA championship game (1979), which was the first meeting of Bird and Magic Johnson, a rivalry that would become the centerpiece of the NBA’s popularization during the 1980s. Bird was drafted by the Celtics after his junior year at Indiana State (1978) but did not play professionally until the 1979–80 season, when he won the Rookie of the Year award after contributing to one of the largest single-season turnarounds in NBA history (a 32-win improvement).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nOver the course of his 13 seasons with the Celtics, the self-described “hick from French Lick” cemented his legacy as one of the greatest players in NBA history. A 6-foot 9-inch (2.06-metre) forward, he was known for his unflappable confidence and clutch shooting ability, which together created an intimidating presence on the court. The Celtics won their first NBA title with Bird (and 14th overall) in 1981; they repeated with title wins in 1984 and 1986. Bird was a 12-time All Star and won three consecutive league Most Valuable Player awards (1984–86), the first noncenter to do so. He averaged 24.3 points, 10 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game over the course of his career, and his 21,791 total points scored was the 11th highest in NBA history at the time of his retirement. At the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Bird was a member of the NBA-superstar-laden “Dream Team,” which won a gold medal in basketball. He was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998."
