        "text": "In the days before Kobe Bryant’s death in a helicopter crash on a hillside outside the city of Los Angeles, the Lakers legend texted his wife plans for a romantic vacation. He agreed to help Dwight Howard at the 2020 dunk contest. He asserted his 13-year-old daughter Gianna could follow his footsteps to the NBA.\n\n“I think there are a couple of players who could play in the NBA right now honestly,” Bryant told CNN on Jan. 22, 2020. “There are a lot of players with a lot of skill that could do it. Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore, Elena Delle Donne. There are a lot of great players out there, so they could certainly keep up with them.”\n\nIt was a microcosm of the post-retirement life Bryant was leading. He was a dedicated husband and father. He was burying the hatchets he had taken to the NBA for 20 years and inspiring the generation that came after him. It all translated to the advancement of the women’s game and the trail his daughter was blazing.\n\nBryant spent his final afternoon alive courtside for Gianna’s doubleheader at Mamba Sports Academy, the athletic training facility he helped launch two years earlier in Thousand Oaks, California. Hours later, LeBron James — the superstar tasked with carrying his Lakers torch — passed Bryant on the all-time scoring list.\n\n“He had zero flaws offensively. Zero,” James, who wrote “Mamba 4 Life” on his sneakers for the game, said of Bryant. “You backed off him, he could shoot the three. You body him up a little bit, he could go around you. He could shoot the midrange, the post, make free throws. That’s something I admired.”\n\nThat night, in a Twitter message that would be his last, Bryant paid homage to James.\n\n“Continuing to move the game forward.” The following is a timeline of the nine months that followed, from the tragedy of Bryant’s death to the triumph of another Lakers championship won in his honor by James.\n\nPart II: The Kobe Timeline, February-March 2020: Vanessa's emotional, moving eulogy at public memorial\n\nPart III: The Kobe Timeline, April-October 2020: First-ballot Hall of Fame nod, birthday tributes and Lakers' 17th NBA title\n\nJan. 26, 2020\n\n(All times Pacific)\n\n7 a.m.: At Our Lady Queen of Angels Church in Newport Beach, California, Bryant stops by his chapel to pray for a quiet moment, blessing himself with holy water, according to his pastor, Father Steve Sallot.\n\n8:19 a.m.: Bryant direct messages Shareef O’Neal, “You good fam?”\n\n“Yeah!” O’Neal responds. “Just been getting this work in trying to figure out my next move.”\n\n9:30 a.m.: Ara Zobayan, the pilot flying a Sikorsky S-76B helicopter carrying Kobe, Gianna and six other passengers from John Wayne Airport for another set of games at Mamba Sports Academy, contacts the control tower at Hollywood Burbank Airport. He had been circling the L.A. Zoo in intense fog at a low altitude.\n\nSitting beside his family in church, Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka receives a text from Bryant. His former client and best friend wants to know if they can set up Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli’s eldest daughter, Alexis, with an internship for MLB super-agent Scott Boras.\n\n“Kobe’s last human act was heroic,” Pelinka publicly reveals in the months that will follow. “He wanted to use his platform to bless and shape a young girl’s future. Hasn’t Kobe done that for all of us?”\n\n9:45 a.m. Traveling north into heavier fog, Zobayan turns south and rapidly ascends. The helicopter crashes into a Calabasas hillside at a speed of nearly 185 miles per hour.\n\n11:24 a.m.: News of Bryant’s death breaks on TMZ.\n\n12:35 p.m.: News breaks that Gianna Bryant was among the eight other passengers on board.\n\n12:49 p.m.: President Donald Trump, since banned from Twitter, tweets, “That is terrible news!”\n\n1:12 p.m.: John Altobelli is the third passenger identified.\n\n1:46 p.m.: Shaquille O’Neal publicly addresses Bryant’s death.\n\nA slew of athletes follow suit in the hours and days ahead.

As an organization, we’re devastated. Our players are devastated.”\n\n2:27 p.m.: Magic Johnson posts a series of tributes on Twitter.\n\n2:40 p.m.: Officials confirm nine people were on board the helicopter, and there are no survivors.\n\n2:45 p.m.: Jerry West, who traded for Bryant as Lakers GM in 1996, issues a statement.\n\n“The news we’ve all received today is the most devastating news that anyone can imagine,” West says, via The Athletic’s Jovan Buha. “I am so saddened for Kobe’s parents, Vanessa, Natalia, Bianka, Capri, Kobe’s sisters and all of the NBA fans that hold Kobe in their hearts. This loss of Kobe, Gianna, and everyone on board is beyond tragic and incomprehensible. I will love Kobe forever and always cherish the time that I spent with him. I watched him grow from an energetic kid into the man he became, making a difference in so many people’s [lives]. He has left the world a better place. Kobe’s legacy will live forever.”\n\n3:16 p.m.: Trae Young switches his jersey to No. 8 in honor of Bryant.\n\n3:49 p.m.: Michael Jordan, Bryant’s idol, issues a statement: “I am in shock over the tragic news of Kobe’s and Gianna’s passing. Words can’t describe the pain I'm feeling. I loved Kobe — he was like a little brother to me. We used to talk often, and I will miss those conversations very much. He was a fierce competitor, one of the greats of the game and a creative force. Kobe was also an amazing dad who loved his family deeply — and took great pride in his daughter’s love for the game of basketball. Yvette joins me in sending my deepest condolences to Vanessa, the Lakers organization and basketball fans around the world.”\n\n3:42 p.m.: Mourners begin flocking to Lower Merion High School, Bryant’s alma mater.\n\n3:56 p.m.: Video captures a tearful LeBron James departing the Lakers’ team plane.\n\n4:13 p.m.: The Toronto Raptors win the tip and run out the 24-second shot clock in honor of Bryant.\n\nThe night’s remaining games followed suit, some of which also featured eight-second backcourt violations.\n\n4:23 p.m.: A moment of silence is held for Bryant at the NFL’s Pro Bowl.\n\n4:40 p.m.: The memorial outside Staples Center grows, a stunning visual representation of the unique bond Bryant forged with Los Angelenos and young NBA fans of the 2000s, including a number of rising stars in the NBA. As New Orleans Pelicans rookie Zion Williamson said, “He was this generation’s Michael Jordan.”\n\n4:55 p.m.: Gregg Popovich is among the NBA’s voices to address Bryant’s death during a slate of games.\n\n“All of us know what a great player he was, but he went beyond great playing. He was a competitor that goes unmatched and it’s what made him, as a player, so attractive to everyone,” he says. “That focus, that competitiveness, that will to win. More importantly, we all feel a deep sense of loss for what he meant to all of us in so many ways. And so many millions of people loved him for so many different reasons.”\n\n4:56 p.m.: Girls basketball coach Christina Mauser is identified as a passenger.\n\n5:22 p.m.: Phil Jackson issues a statement: “The crash was a tragedy for multiple families.

He went beyond the veil.”\n\n5:41 p.m.: The Dallas Mavericks retire Bryant’s No. 24.\n\n8:05 p.m.: Damian Lillard scores 50 points to bring his three-game total to 157, joining a list of players that only includes Bryant, Jordan and James Harden. “We’re losing the great Kobe ‘Bean’ Bryant,” Lillard said. “His impact on the game, players, coaches, everybody individually is going to be missed. It can’t be replaced. There’s definitely going to be a hole in this game going forward that can’t be replaced.”\n\n8:16 p.m.: Alicia Keys and Boyz II Men sing “It’s So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday” in front of a national television audience, as The Grammys pay tribute to Bryant.\n\nJan. 27, 2020\n\n• All nine passengers are identified: Kobe Bryant, 41; Gianna Bryant, 13; John Altobelli, 56; Keri Altobelli, 46; Alyssa Altobelli, 13; Sarah Chester, 45; Payton Chester, 13; Christina Mauser, 38; and Ara Zobayan, 50.\n\n• Boston Red Sox scouting director Paul Toboni creates a GoFundMe for the Altobelli family.
