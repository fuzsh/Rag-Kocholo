        "text": "A bronze statue of NBA legend Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna has been placed at the crash site in Calabasas, California, where the Bryants and seven others were killed.\n\nThe statue was installed for the second anniversary of the Jan. 26, 2020, crash. Created by sculptor Dan Medina, it shows Kobe Bryant in his Lakers uniform with his arm around Gianna, who is also wearing a basketball uniform with a basketball in her hand.\n\nThe base of the statue has a plaque with the names of all nine crash victims: Kobe Bryant, Gianna Bryant, John Altobelli, Keri Altobelli, Alyssa Altobelli, Sarah Chester, Payton Chester, Christina Mauser, Ara Zobayan.\n\nMedina told Los Angeles TV station KABC the statue would remain at the site “temporarily. ”\n\nIt is on public land: Las Virgenes View Park, which is overseen by the Mountains Recreation & Conservation Authority and Las Virgenes water district.\n\nThe shortest path to the site is the Bark Park Trail, which starts at a dog park at 4232 Las Virgenes Road (red dot on the map), south of Highway 101 in Calabasas. A hike of about 1 mile with 300 feet elevation gain reaches the spot where the helicopter crashed, near the junction with the New Millennium Trail.\n\nThe area was closed for several months after the crash because of the clean-up required by the fuel spill. Since its reopening, it has had many visitors who have left behind flowers, jerseys, inscribed rocks.\n\nThe New Millennium Trail is part of a 12-mile loop popular with mountain bikers. The crash was witnessed by several cyclists were in the area at 9:45 a.m. on that Sunday in 2020."
