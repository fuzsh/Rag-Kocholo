When I was a boy in junior high, we were assigned to read a short story called “The Soul of Caliban”, by Emma-Lindsay Squier. “The Soul of Caliban," first appeared in the December 1924 issue of Everybody's Magazine, so it’s just about 100 years old.

To this day, some 50+ years later, it is still my favorite dog story, and makes me cry every time I read it.

If you love dogs, you will want to read this story. It’s only 12 pages; take the time . . .
