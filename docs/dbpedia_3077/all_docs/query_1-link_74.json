        "text": "Before we talk about Jonathan Edwards’s “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,” we should talk about the foundations of American gothic literature. The first texts we’ll discuss center around two themes: religion and anxiety.\n\nA Brief Introduction to Early American Gothic\n\nFaye Ringel writes in “Chapter 1: Early American Gothic” of The Cambridge Companion to American Gothic that “American Gothic is inherently ahistoric” because it “‘revives’ a time and place that never existed” (14). We have to acknowledge the establishment of America when we talk about gothic literature. Ringel notes that those who traveled from Europe to America “painted the New World landscape in the colors of the European imagination” in an attempt to seek out and create legends (14.)\n\nAnother thing we’ll notice about these texts is that they often present dual visions. For instance, the Puritans saw New England as a Utopia and Hell simultaneously. We’re going to talk more about that with this unit’s reading. I always find that looking for dual meanings as I read creates a great launching point for analysis.\n\nI also think it’s worth thinking about anxiety as you read this piece. There are a lot of good arguments made about anxiety and insecurity (security of one’s land or security of one’s country, perhaps) as they contribute to many of these American gothic works.\n\nIntroduction to “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God”\n\n“Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God” is a sermon written by Jonathan Edwards. The Calvinist theologian was born in Connecticut in 1703. His father was a minister, and his mother’s father was also a theologian. At the age of 12, Edwards matriculated at Yale. By 1729, he was a minister. “Sinners” is not the only work Edwards wrote. Another of his prominent pieces is God Glorified in the Work of Redemption, by the Greatness of Man’s Dependence upon Him (1731).\n\nOne concept you need to understand before you read is Calvinism. Calvinism is a Protestant branch that essentially believes in God’s sovereignty and humankind’s depravity. Additionally, Calvinism largely centers on the concept of predestination, that God has already decided who will be saved.\n\nEdwards and this sermon were part of creating the First Great Awakening, a period of Protestant religious revival that spanned the 1730s and 40s. Religious fervor increased significantly during this time.\n\nWhat to Look For When You Read\n\nWhen you read “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,” there are a few things to look for. One of the most prominent features of this piece is the imagery. Look at the images Edwards presents, including the idea of a religious deity dangling sinners over the pits of hell. As you read these descriptions, consider the role of pessimism and fear as persuasive tools. How does the imagery build tension? Additionally, think about the way Edwards wants us to feel about this “angry God.”\n\nMany of the gothic texts we’ll read in this course will surround narratives of captivity. How does this sermon relate to this concept?\n\nHere’s one more point to reflect on. It’s said that Edwards delivered this sermon in a calm, unemotional manner. Think about the strategy behind this as you read, determining how such a delivery might be effective for Edwards’s audience.\n\nPrevious Lesson: Course Introduction"
