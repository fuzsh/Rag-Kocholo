        "text": "If could pick any age, how old would you be? A writer for the San Diego Union asked women writers this age-old question in 1923.\n\nFrom The San Diego Union, Monday, July 2, 1923:\n\nWHAT AGE WOULD YOU RATHER BE? SAN DIEGO WRITERS GIVE OPINIONS\n\nBY MARY ELIZABETH IRWIN\n\nIF you had your “ruthers”, as the folks say back home, what age would you rather be?\n\nThere’s a pretty general opinion current in certain well advertised circles that human beings of the advanced 20-plus are simply cluttering up the earth—at least that nothing interesting ever happens to them. Of course that is that air of amused tolerance which says audibly and as often as possible, “Yes, dear. I felt the same way about it at your age, but you’ll outgrow it.”\n\nYouth, alas—or, is is alas?—is about the fleetingest thing there is. Youth thinks it is the happiest time. But is it?\n\nI asked some of San Diego’s women writers what they thought about it. Just exactly what, if any, are the golden years for a woman. I asked Harriet Welles and Mildred Cram, Emma-Lindsay Squier, Bertha Lowry Gwynne, and got such interesting opinions that asking of the trite question was worth while.\n\nHarriet Welles refuses to make any “blanket assertions concerning a woman’s best years, because she says there’s no standard of intelligence or charm.\n\n‘NEXT PORT BEST’\n\n“I think that a woman’s happiest age should be the year in which she is living, and that—if she is intelligent enough to have profited by past experiences—her best work is being done right now. I wouldn’t want any age to stand still. As the sailors say: ‘Next port is always the best port.’ “\n\nYou’d expect Harriet Welles to wind up with a navy quotation, wouldn’t you? As the wife of Admiral Roger Welles and a writer of short stories that have been called naval classics, she has three grand passions, “Roger,” the navy and China. When her stories aren’t navy they are Chinese. She lived in China several years when her husband had duty there, and everybody knows how ardently she wants to go back. She gets terribly upset over the average run of magazine Chinese stories because she says they are so untruthful, so unpardonably inaccurate–and I know how she fells, because I will never forgive Hergesheimer because he once wrote a story about Kentucky in which he picture Lexington as a crude mountain community full of oil wells and new-rich illiterates.\n\nOf course this is rambling a bit.\n\nThere is an especially good reason why Harriet Welles is not repining for the past and is looking forward to the ‘next port.’ That is because she painted pictures in the past, and now she writes stories. They were good pictures, good enough to be hung in most of the big galleries and exhibitions of the east. She studied with masters of the day. Bus she never liked to paint. She does like to write—the chief thorn in her enviable existence as an admiral’s wife is that she hasn’t as much time for writing as she wants. So she’s looking forward, not backward—to the next port in ears and work and geography. It may be China.\n\n30 perfect age\n\nMildred Cram was more definite.\n\nThirty, she believes is the perfect age. “At 30,” she says, “a woman is still young enough to be intellectually flexible; she is potentiality realized; she is at her best physically; she has usually had enough sentimental experience to be emotionally balanced, yet she is not quite old enough to have lost her romantic illusions. socially, she is experienced. As an artist, a professional, she can afford to call herself a ‘modern’ and to be in touch with the new influences, trends, movements.”\n\nAnd then she adds this telling reflection, “She has had time to study herself, but not to be sorry for herself. Yes, 30 is a glorious age. If I could choose I would be eternally 30. But not 40, because at 40 there is, inevitably, a hint of autumn, the declining sun, and even the most courageous woman would prefer summer and the sun at the zenith.\n\nMiss Cram believes that the women of 50 years ago were probably as reluctant to grow old as we are today, but at least growing old then was entirely respectable, if not desirable. Matrons were candidly matrons and grandmothers published their stains proudly to the world–and spinsters were unquestionably spinsters!\n\nSOCIAL STIGMA\n\n“But today,” says Miss Cram, “there is social stigma attached to wrinkles, gray hairs, comfortable waist lines, and that general air of relaxation and surrender associated with being a frankly middle-age woman. No one dares to be old—and yet Youth is not sooner come than it is gone. Thirty is the perfect age; the best years for work between 20 and 40, and there are a few who have survived the dangers of physical deterioration, have carried their art, their wit and their spirituality over into the ‘second best’ age—that marvelous time between 40 and 60 granted to those rare women who are superior to time.”\n\nMildred Cram is out at La Jolla, writing a novel for Harper’s. They sent her out, if you please, with a heavy advance so that she might have leisure to write the kind of book they knew she could do. She’s been writing short stories for years, and that’s what Harper’s thinks of her work. She’s a ‘modern’—so modern that when a friend asked her not long ago how the book was coming on she said it was growing rapidly but was getting to be “frightfully immoral”—and so unmodern that she wailed when she said it and said she didn’t want it that way!\n\nEmma-Lindsay Squire and Bertha Lowry Gwynne speak out in meeting tomorrow, and tell what they think about this age question. And I’d like to know what others think. You don’t have to be a writer. I’d like to know what a home woman, a business woman, a flirt, a flapper, or even a man—or especially a man—thinks about a woman’s most interesting age. What do you think?"
