        "text": "By Terri Gorney\n\n“I was to meet Gene Stratton-Porter and I was scared to death,” wrote young nature\n\nwriter Emma Lindsay-Squier in 1922. Both women were native Hoosiers and living in\n\nCalifornia. According to Emma, “A New York editor had asked her to give me some\n\nadvice concerning nature stories.” At the time of this meeting, Emma was a journalist for\n\nthe Los Angeles Times and wrote a society coumn under her own byline.\n\nEmma was born to Russell and Ada Squier in Marion Indiana in 1892. When she was a\n\nyoung woman, she read Gene’s books about the Limberlost and to Emma, Gene was “a\n\nwielder of high magic, a maker of big medicine.” Emma loved nature and began writing\n\nshort stories on the subject. Before she was 13, she was writing a weekly newsletter in\n\nTerre Haute. Eventually the family moved to Salem Oregon, then Glendale California.\n\nGene thought it was splendid that she was writing about nature “because the [WWI]\n\nbrought people closer to nature than ever before.” Gene told her tales of the Limberlost\n\nthat Emma had not read. It was a place she loved to hunt flowers, mosses and birds. She\n\nwas happy with the “companionship of the out-of-doors.”\n\nAt this meeting, Gene gave Emma a copy of her latest book, “The Fire Bird,” and\n\nautographed it: “For Emma Lindsay Squier from Gene Stratton-Porter. A high place in\n\nthe mountains. Great magic. Many blue shells.”\n\nIn 1922, Gene wrote an eleven page introduction for Emma’s first book “Wild Heart.”\n\nEmma’s book came out to great reviews. “To anyone who knows the field and woods the\n\nbook carries the conviction of truth.” Nineteen years after the Gene’s first book, “Song of\n\nthe Cardinal,” came out Gene was a well respected author and naturalist. She was at a\n\nplace in her life where young authors were asking her for advice and wisdom. Gene’s\n\nadvice was to be humble and sincere in her writing. Gene told Emma, as she did her\n\npublisher, Nelson Doubleday, she felt that her best writings were still to come.\n\nAt the close of the interview, Gene told Emma that the Limberlost “belongs to me – and –\n\nI belong to it.” She would be forever linked to the Limberlost with her books. It was a\n\nplace that she made famous.\n\nEmma would have a second book published that year called “On Autumn Trails.” She\n\nwould write a number of short stories and books. One of her short stories, “Glorious\n\nBuccaneer,” was produced as a Hollywood film.\n\nShe married John Bransby, a movie producer, who also did the photography for a couple\n\nof her books. In the 1930s, the couple moved from California to New York City. Emma\n\nshe died at Saranac Lake of tuberculosis at the age of 48. John lived until 1998 and died\n\nat the age of 97.\n\nWriter’s Note: Emma Lindsay Squier wrote about her meeting with Gene Stratton-Porter\n\nfor the Los Angeles Times."
