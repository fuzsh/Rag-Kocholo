Supplements to original issues are sold separately. Virtually all of our magazines have been in circulation, read by their original purchaser, and in some cases are decades old.\n\nAbout mailing labels. Cover images you see at Wolfgang's may not show mailing labels, but the magazine you receive may have one on it, either pre-printed or affixed."
