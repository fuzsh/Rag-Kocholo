        "text": "A Serial Killer is Stalking and Murdering Gay Men.\n\nA Hateful Minister Says It’s the Hand of God.\n\nWho Will Be Next?\n\nA serial killer is stalking young gay men in a Midwest college town. High school senior Kevin Bland, rich, brilliant, and a wild-child, meets a college freshman, Mitch Christman, who is just Kevin’s type. And also the killer’s type. Adding to the mix is college sophomore Brent who enlists Mitch’s help in finding answers and possibly unmasking the killer. And all the while, Dr. Spencer Fellows, anti-gay crusader, and hate-monger, stirs the pot, praising the killer for ridding the city of gay men, one by one by one.\n\nPraise for Angry God\n\nA wild, dialogue-driven and somewhat murderous ride through dark, but ultimately redeeming territory.”\n\n—Nick Wilgus, author of the bestselling Shaking the Sugar Tree\n\n“Russell J. Sanders’s fast-paced novel, told mostly through dialog, combines all the right ingredients for a contemporary murder mystery: college boys in love, vast riches and power, rancid religion and a serial killer.”\n\n—Elliott Mackle, author of It Takes Two and Captain Harding’s Six-Day War"
