        "text": "MAY IS EARLY 3-STRIP TECHNICOLOR MONTH\n\nThe only American screwball comedy in Technicolor, 1937’s NOTHING SACRED finally comes to home video in a version it deserves.\n\nAs the Thirties passed the midway mark, and, as the Depression was winding down, David O. Selznick amped up his desire to see more perfected three-strip Technicolor on the worldwide screens. To the famed producer, it was time to stop just showcasing the process for the way it looked, and to integrate it into the various genres. Primarily, he wanted to crank down the “ooh-and-ahh” factor, striving for a more “natural color” look. Screwball comedies seemed a ripe choice, so he hired The Front Page‘s Ben Hecht to pen a wacky script of modern lovers. As usual, Mr. Hecht (along with James Street, from his story; plus, uncredited, Ring Lardner, Jr., Moss Hart, Budd Schulberg, George Oppenheimer, Sidney Howard, Robert Carson, Selznick himself AND director William A. Wellman – Jeez, what a load of wiseacres!) didn’t let his employer down.\n\nIn NOTHING SACRED, spinning its tale in a mere 74-minutes, we are quickly introduced to wily New York City reporter Wally Cook – a solid gold-plated tabloid dude who will stoop to any level for a story, much to the contradictory delight (circulation)/dismay (lawsuits) of his publisher/editor (wait for it), Oliver Stone. The opening, one of my favorite parts in the movie (or in ANY screwball riot) has Manhattan’s cafe society/political royalty paying tribute to the visiting Sultan of Marzipan – a banquet ruined by the arrival of the potentate’s wife and kids. “That’s him!,” she angrily points to her errant spouse, in reality a Harlem bootblack.\n\nThe backlash Cook receives (banishment to the basement-housed obits column) is likely to become vocationally lethal – unless the prank-driven writer redeems himself. Desperate, Wally discovers a six-line squib that smacks of the stuff gullible suckers’ll eat up. In Warsaw, VT, Hazel Flagg, a young woman, has been fatally exposed to radium, unhappily spending her final days hoping to spend a $200 stipend the company who poisoned the unlucky female has bestowed upon her. And she wants to do in style, along the Great White Way. Perfect, eh?\n\nEven more so when Flagg turns out to be totally gorgeous.\n\nSoon, Wally, Hazel and her personal physician, Dr. Downer, are planning a grand sendoff in New York City – commencing with the key to the city, unending tributes (including a deli offering extra cheese and baloney), and culminating in Hazel Flagg Day – with one small unrecorded detail. Hazel’s quack sawbones made a mistake – she ain’t kicking off.\n\nPlayers being played was never so much fun…or colorful, and, indeed, moviegoers gasped in awe at the many second unit Technicolor shots of Manhattan (we do too, seeing the city in three-strip, ca. 1937).\n\nOf course, you needed a no-nonsense, machine-gun-paced director to keep things moving, and Selznick got him with William Wellman – not known for comedies in the talkie era, but who had done some silent burlesque gems (When Husbands Flirt, The Boob, You Never Know Women, The Cat’s Pajamas). And, natch, ya needed two top leads to seamlessly bounce situations off each other – verbally and physically – from romance to one memorable moment involving fisticuffs.Enter Fredric March (Hecht originally wanted John Barrymore, but Selznick absolutely refused) and Carole Lombard (hmmm…would have been interesting to see a reunion of the Twentieth Century stars…in Technicolor), who handled rapid-fire dialog with sublime panache (Lombard’s comment/delivery to her co-conspirator doc, once she discovers the truth, and decides to ride the gravy train for all it’s worth is timing ambrosia: “It’s kind of startling to be brought to life twice – and each time in Warsaw!”).\n\nW. Howard Greene shot the picture brilliantly, and no less than Oscar Levant scored it with an almost Gershwinian smooth sophistication (there’s even Raymond Scott quirky band music in a nightclub scene). And what a supporting cast, too! An array of 1937’s Who’s Who Character Actor Heaven, comprising Margaret Hamilton, Walter Connolly (as Stone), Charles Winninger (as Downer), Sig Ruman, Frank Fay, Maxie Rosenbloom, Olin Howard, Bobby Barber, Billy Barty, George Chandler (the director’s human good luck charm), Ann Doran, Jinx Falkenburg, Hedda Hopper, Leonid Kinskey, Charles Lane, Edwin Maxwell, Mary MacLaren, John Qualen, Aileen Pringle, Monty Woolley, Ernest Whitman, and Hattie McDaniel.\n\nA literal image problem with this title made it a notorious item for many years. Reissues in the 1940s, when Technicolor was in high demand (and the distributor wanted to save a buck), relegated the prints to the inferior CineColor. Worse, CineColor was a two-strip process (not until 1952 would there be a SuperCineColor three-strip edition), so, without decades-later technology of CRIs (Color Reversal Intermediates), muddy, murky results were the throwback fate of a three-strip movie being reduced to two-strip. Adding to the dilemma was the fact that CineColor had no emulsion – it was double-sided base, which rendered the images soft to boot. More indignation when this title fell into public domain and dupes of dupes of dupes from 16MM CineColor flooded the market, incorrectly causing armchair movie archivists to conclude that early color sucked. Lombard’s cautious quote during production (that color can make you “look screwy”) didn’t aid the dilemma.\n\nWell, hold on to your hats, folks, cause Kino-Lorber, has secured a new 2K scanned 35MM master, restored from the original fine grain elements. It is truly the best version of NOTHING SACRED that I’ve ever seen! In addition to the outstanding video, there’s excellent supplemental audio commentary by William Wellman, Jr., and, the theatrical trailer).\n\nWhile NOTHING SACRED isn’t my favorite screwball comedy, it’s definitely up there. And for fans of the stars, Technicolor, and the era, this Blu-Ray’s a must!\n\nNOTHING SACRED. Color. Full frame [1.33:1; 1080p High Definition]; 2.0 DTS-HD MA. Kino-Lorber Studio Classics. CAT # K23099. SRP: $29.95.\n\nHey, collectors, click on Kino-Lorber’s site to take advantage of a sale currently offering this wonderful Blu-Ray at 80% OFF! https://www.klstudioclassics.com/search?q=film%7C%7CNothing+Sacred+%28Restored+Version%29&dvd=off&dvd=on&bluray=off&bluray=on\n\nMAY IS EARLY 3-STRIP TECHNICOLOR MONTH\n\nJust as so many moviegoers were curious as to how their favorite stars sounded during the talkie revolution, many cinema fans were equally piqued about how their glam gods and goddesses looked in color. This fact did not escape David O. Selznick, who cast Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer in his 1936 opus THE GARDEN OF ALLAH (the producer’s first foray into three-strip), now on Blu-Ray from Kino-Lorber Studio Classics.\n\nThe movie, based on the controversial (albeit absurd) novel by Richard Hichens (and scripted by W.P. Lipscomb and Lynn Riggs, with uncredited assist from associate producer Willis Goldbeck) concerns Domini Enfilden, a convent-reared beauty, who, upon her’s father’s death (a widower she cared for dearly), retreats to the vastness of the Sahara…to find peace. Once there, she meets Boris Androvsky; little does the religiously-guided lass know that this strange dude who is getting her juices flowing is a guilt-ridden disgraced Trappist monk, who has eschewed his vows, and retreated to the desert…and found one helluva piece!\n\nAdd some Arabian treachery and nearly 80 minutes of awesome three-strip vistas (with Yuma, AZ and Buttercup Dunes, CA subbing for the Sahara), and you got the makings of a high-priced budgeted freak show extraordinaire.\n\nTo backtrack a bit, Selznick, upon seeing the tests for perfected Technicolor, went totally ga-ga over three-strip, even decreeing that all his future productions would be shot in the process; it would be a notoriously bad decision, costing him a number of important projects – most notably John Ford’s Stagecoach. Still, color prevailed long enough for him to envision what a book like Gone with the Wind might look like if the grays could properly be contrasted with the blues. Already, a key GWTW cornerstone Selznick crew was in place for ALLAH, including set designer Lyle Wheeler, composer Max Steiner, plus a barrage of color consultants who, collectively, put style over content, creating a spectacular IB feature-length test reel that virtually demanded that viewers disregard the prejudicial, right-wing religious bosh of the lip-biting scenario.\n\nAnother GWTW run-through was the search for the leads. No less than Joan Crawford and Merle Oberon were considered/tested for Domini before Dietrich was signed. And Robert Taylor, Fredric March, George Brent, Laurence Olivier, Robert Donat, Ivor Novello, Gilbert Roland, and Jean Gabin did likewise for Boris before Boyer got the news. George Cukor was, at one point, listed as director, but these chores eventually went to Richard Bowleslawski, a strange choice as he was generally known for comedies, intentional and unintentional (Theodora Goes Wild, Hollywood Party, Rasputin and the Empress, The Painted Veil).\n\nThe remaining cast of (literally) colorful characters include C. Aubrey Smith, Alan Marshall, Lucile Watson, Pedro de Cordoba, Nigel De Brulier, Helen Jerome Eddy, Robert Frazer, Frederick Gottschalk, Leonid Kinskey, Mary MacLaren, Michael Mark, and Frank Puglia. Young convent girls rhapsodizing over Domini’s breathtaking looks comprise Ann Gillis, Bonita Granville, Marcia Mae Jones, and prominently Dietrich’s daughter Maria Riva (their squealing line “Isn’t she beautiful?” was likely suggested by Marlene).\n\nThe lusty, animalistic dancer Tilly Losch makes her debut in an early, memorable sequence, writhing amok in an extremely sensual display; she would repeat that in spades for Selznick super Technicolor western Duel in the Sun, in 1946. And if one oily personification of smarmy villainy wasn’t enough, Selznick gave this show more dastardly mountebanks than you can shake a Technicolor stick at, aka, Basil Rathbone, John Carradine, Joseph Schildkraut, and Henry Brandon.\n\nFor Boyer, this was an early plum role (indeed, he seems to be the only one turning in a performance); for Dietrich (essentially portraying a human mannequin for Ernest Dryden’s sensational frocks), it was a career move she almost immediately regretted – not that she had a choice. After two Josef von Sternberg mega-flops at Paramount (The Scarlet Empress, The Devil is a Woman), Marlene was treading deep water. Sternberg already got his walking papers, and was kicked out of the elegant studio – his next stop being Columbia! Dietrich hung on by a thread called Desire, a Frank Borzage comedy, produced by Lubitsch, which proved to be a sizable hit. Yet, post-Code, her charms were certainly compromised (imagine what this plot could have been like three years earlier!).\n\nThe striking use of locations didn’t help. Practically before she set one over-priced tootsie upon the Salton basin, Dietrich was bitching about the heat. And she wasn’t necessarily wrong. Without the array of her approximately 9000 costume changes, the temps, occasionally rising to 112 degrees, would be unbearable. Add the generator-driven hot movie lights – made worse by Technicolor cameras requiring even more illumination, and it was purgatory.\n\nBut it didn’t stop there. Marlene disliked horses, remarking on their smell, their attracting armies of flies, and the fact that they could kill you. Her erotic riding scenes were shortened, and those mostly achieved by stunt doubles.\n\nThe worst target of Marlene’s malice was costar Boyer – by no fault of his own. Dietrich spared him nothing, mouthing off to anyone who would listen about his “tewibble toupee”! Apparently, the intense heat caused the already-balding actor’s hairpiece to open front end, with warm “towents” of sweat cascading over La Dietrich’s punim.\n\nSternberg-deprived, she would often bemoan out loud “Where’s my Joe?” to deaf ears and pissed off smelly, fly-friendly equines.\n\nLike it’s recent predecessors, ALLAH‘s celebrated faces took a backseat to the glories of Technicolor, as rendered by three masters of photography: W. Howard Greene, Harold Rosson, and (uncredited) Virgil Miller (the former two winning a special Oscar for their endeavors). The visuals far outweigh the narrative (including such immortal dialog as “You come a land of fire, and, I think, you ARE fire!”), and are, as we often fondly state, drop dead gorgeous. With every new production, three-strip was becoming more advanced; the difference between ALLAH and Dancing Pirate (released the same year) is like night and day.\n\nThe Kino-Lorber Blu-Ray of THE GARDEN OF ALLAH is a knockout, faithfully rendering a hues-and-tones facsimile of what the 1936 excitement was all about, certainly the most expensive IB pic for the then-new process to-date. Herbert Kalmus’s Technicolor company fared best for all the production’s grueling toils…as evidenced by the reception. Long story short, Technicolor got the lion’s share of the reviews, and while ALLAH, at least initially, did a fairly brisk business, it could come nowhere near to recouping the pic’s massive costs. Dietrich would continue to plummet in popularity polls until 1939’s Destry Rides Again permanently resurrected her from the Box-Office Poison list. Her last word on Technicolor, ALLAH, and the company that released it (United Artists) would come several months later. UA invited the star to attend the premiere of the Disney’s Snow White, the first animated feature in three-strip. Besieged by the press upon exiting the theater, her response was classic Marlene: “Big deal,” she shrugged, “it’s a cartoon!”\n\nSelznick was undaunted, however, and eagerly planned more Technicolor vehicles for his upcoming release schedule. But that’s for another time (like next week).\n\nTHE GARDEN OF ALLAH. Color. Full frame [1.33:1; 1080p High Definition]; 2.0 DTS-HD MA. Kino-Lorber Studio Classics. CAT# K22826. SRP: $29.95.\n\nMAY IS EARLY 3-STRIP TECHNICOLOR MONTH\n\nTo celebrate the dawn of perfected Technicolor, we’ve chosen the colorful month of May to herald the release of a handful of mid-Thirties’ titles filmed in the then-new process, and recently released on Blu-Ray and DVD.\n\nFirst up is the incredibly obscure, but historically important 1936 release, DANCING PIRATE, the first three-strip Technicolor musical (or, more precisely, “dancing musical,” as it was lauded), now available from The Film Detective.\n\nEven while two-strip briefly flourished (in highlighted sequences and rare full-length features throughout the silent and early talkie era), Technicolor head Herbert Kalmus was forever tinkering around to further improve the process. Two-strip went through various evocations, including the actual cementing of two strips of film (magenta and yellow) before imbibition allowed the printing to be done on a single strand of 35MM stock. Still, the results varied – from pleasing to strange and bizarre (which is why it was usually reserved for musical numbers once sound arrived, or, more famously, for horror like Dr. X and Mystery of the Wax Museum). As far back as the mid-1920’s, Kalmus was experimenting with three-strip, usually hampered by his not winning over enough backers to make his vision a reality.\n\nIndeed, the Technicolor story is a fascinating one, and would make a great movie in and of itself, with as much nasty corporate intrigue as Wall Street, The Hucksters, Executive Suite, Glengarry Glen Ross, The Wolf of Wall Street, or an entire season of Mad Men…yeah, it’s that mysterious, double-dealing and shady (the behind-the-scenes Disney stuff alone…oh, never mind).\n\nBy the beginning of the 1930s, Technicolor took a dive when audiences tired of musicals, and producers tired of the expense (not helped by the Great Depression); but three-strip was on the way, and the initial tests looked gorgeous. The biggest problem had been solved: rendering the color “blue,” or “cyan,” as the IB folks chose to call it. This also enabled the process to fully encompass day and night photography – the latter always previously a particularly difficult chore.\n\nOnce lawsuits had been resolved (did I mention “Disney”?), Kalmus interested Sam Goldwyn, who filmed the final sequence of the Eddie Cantor musical Kid Millions in three-strip. It took place in an ice-cream factory, and the nervous “yes men” in the screening room could barely look at the mogul – until they heard him audibly drooling “Mmmmmm, strawberry!”\n\nMovie producers, explorers and entrepreneurs Merian C. Cooper and John Hay Whitney went further by contracting Technicolor to film the first full-length feature in three-strip, Becky Sharp, an adaptation of Thackeray’s Vanity Fair, starring Miriam Hopkins and directed by Rouben Mamoulian. While critics were divided as to the movie’s worth as pure screen drama, everyone was ga-ga over its physical presence. Perfected Technicolor had exploded in a rainbow tsunami. Under their banner Pioneer Pictures, Cooper, Whitney, and John Speaks searched for a follow-up (Paramount had already decided to shoot a remake of Trail of the Lonesome Pine on-location – the first outdoor movie in IB). Long story short, Pioneer’s second feature had to be a first (they had already done a mini-musical short, La Cucuracha). Since they were operating through RKO (Cooper’s old haunt, the one from where he made King Kong, and, equally relevant, a studio where he subsequently, albeit briefly, had been head of production), Fred Astaire seemed like a good Technicolor bet. So, the first dancing three-strip musical, brilliantly entitled DANCING PIRATE, would be the second Pioneer IB feature. They immediately hit a snag when Astaire took one look at the script (by Ray Harris and Francis Edward Faragoh, adapted by Jack Wagner and Boris Ingster – from Emma Lindsay Squier’s 1930 story Glorious Buccaneer) and promptly refused. Undaunted, Pioneer combed the theater stages and music halls and scooped up Charles Collins. He would be supported by Steffi Duna, Frank Morgan, Luis Alberni, Victor Varconi, Cy Kendall, Jack La Rue, and Marjorie Reynolds; also in the cast were the Royal Cansino Dancers, featuring Rita Cansino before her last name was changed to Hayworth.\n\nThe screenplay quality (concerning a shanghaied Boston dance instructor ending up in old California, ca. 1820) certainly mirrored another major creative choice; instead of an A-list director, like Mamoulian, the producers sought to save a dime by hiring competent Lloyd Corrigan, better known as a jovial character actor. The rest of the credits, however, were non-negotiable. Soon-to-be Technicolor expert (and nine-time Oscar nominee) William V. Skall (The Little Princess, Reap the Wild Wind, Rope, Joan of Arc, the latter winning him an Academy Award) won the coveted position of d.p., working closely with Ray Rennahan, (who had been with Technicolor since 1923); art/set, and costume design by Wiard Ihnen and Eugene Joseff, and choreography by Russell Lewis (who was Oscar-nominated) appended the visuals. The all-important music, under direction of Alfred Newman, comprised a Rodgers and Hart score, truthfully, not their finest moment – as colorless a contrast as the movie is colorful.\n\nAlmost immediately, it’s easy to see why Astaire bolted. The fact that Collins, aka Jonathan Pride, becomes the title character by default doesn’t stop the local gentry from wanting to hang him. He is saved by his Terpsichore skills – ample proof he ain’t no pirate; sadly, unlike Astaire, he ain’t no movie star either (even with a pasted-on Douglas Fairbanks mustache). There’s a B-movie subplot where corrupt Spanish military officials attempt to ravage the community and female costar Duna. You can pretty much figure out what happens, and how it all ends.\n\nTo paraphrase Gold Hat in Treasure of Sierra Madre, “we dunt need no stinkin’ screenplay. We’ve got three-strip Technicolor!” And, yesiree, the hues and tones were the authentic stars of this saga. Falling in love with the capabilities of three-strip IB might have been a mistake, though; there’s way too much footage devoted to nighttime shenanigans. But, again, in 1936, it didn’t seem to matter; the oohs and aahs had ’em lining up around the block.\n\nFor the most part, the Film Detective restoration of DANCING PIRATE is clean, sharp and (when daylight allows) ebullient. Previously only available in black-and-white or murky CineColor 16MM prints, the three-strip materials were long-thought lost until a 35MM nitrate print was discovered in 2015. A few jump cuts (nicely digitally-cleansed) are evident where the footage no longer exists; not a prob, these tally up to mere seconds. Extras include audio commentary by Jennifer Churchill and two mini-documentaries: Glorious Pioneers: The Birth of Technicolor of and Ambushed by Mediocrity: Remembering The Dancing Pirate.\n\nFor me, the best part of the picture encompasses the opening sequences where Collins/Pride teaches untalented pupils how to waltz; it’s the most Astaire (and grownup) moment, and also beautifully lit and shot (it should be noted that one of the young would-be twinkletoes is Pat Nixon!).\n\nBy the following year, all the majors were planning three-strip endeavors, and Kalmus & Co. never had to look back.\n\nAt 83 minutes, this is an interesting way to spend a movie night; for Technicolor fans and classic cinema buffs, however, it’s a MUST.\n\nDANCING PIRATE.

SRP: $24.95.\n\nYou know I’m a sucker for pre-Code movies (as are most if not all of my readers), so I’m delighted to announce the Blu-Ray remasters of two superb specimens from that era, LADIES THEY TALK ABOUT and MARY STEVENS, M.D. (both 1933, and now available from The Warner Archive Collection).\n\nWe pre-mies, of course, are more than familiar with each of these excellent titles. They often run on TCM, and have been in the Warner Archive Collection for years – the latter as DVDs. Now don’t get me wrong. These older transfers were quite good, but, damn, the new 1080p High Definition re-dos blew my mind. Truly, it’s as if I’m seeing these naughty nuggets for the first time. Mel Mantra #1: Never forget how well (if not brilliantly) these movies were lit and shot. Long story short, the difference between the DVDs and the Blu-Rays is the difference between “very nice” and “jaw-dropping gorgeous.”\n\nA gender switch on convict redemption, as only pre-Code can deliver, LADIES THEY TALK ABOUT is a first-rate vehicle for rising star Barbara Stanwyck, who can do more with a smirk and a look than a script packed with risque one-liners (never mind, they’re here, too – courtesy of a scenario by Brown Holmes, William McGrath, and Sid Sutherland). Interestingly, LADIES is based upon Dorothy Mackaye’s and Carlton Miles’s play, Gangsteress, recounting Ms. Mackaye’s 1928 ten-month imprisonment in San Quentin. Stany plays Nan Taylor, the proverbial hottie from the wrong side of the tracks (jaded in girlhood by religious wingnuts), who ends up taking the fall for the heads of the bad crowd she’s hooked up with (the lead noggin and her squeeze being – who else? – but Lyle Talbot). Enter sanctimonious radio preacher Dave Slade (Preston Foster), who instantly becomes attracted to a suspicious Nan; much to her dismay, she starts gets the physical vibes herself. That all goes south when, hormones aside, Slade causes the now conflicted (but mostly pissed off) Nan to be sent up the river.\n\nThe prison sequences are primo pre-Code, with new fish Taylor taken under the tutelage of sassy Linda (Lillian Roth in her best movie role). They BFF like nobody’s business, and Nan’s intros to the penitentiary’s lesbian contingent, Aunt Maggie (the ex-Madam of a “beauty parlor,” where men were the clients), and Susie (a Dave Slade-obsessed nympho, out to destroy Ms. Taylor, once the revivalist’s lingering attraction becomes common knowledge) comprise cinematic snarkasm from Heaven. There are attempted crash-outs, double-crosses, and triple-crosses before Nan finally realizes that her love for Slade is genuinely mutual (but only after she pays him back by shooting him).\n\nIn stir, Roth and the other goils put the frustrated sexual heat on sizzle, particularly in one scene where horndog (or is it “kitten”?) Linda tells Nan that the only things on their collective minds are “freedom…and MEN!,” the last word delivered with such lip-biting frenzy that the poor lass nearly gnashes her puckerers to the teeth. They also moan to pinup photos of their favorite male movie stars (coincidentally, all Warners contractees).\n\nThe cast is terrific with Babs additionally backed up by Maude Eburne (Aunt Maggie), Dorothy Burgess (Susie), and Ruth Donnelly, Harold Huber, Grace Cunard, Mary Gordon, and Robert Warwick. Director William Keighley (who codirected with Howard Bretherton, and also appears in a bit) moves the action at a lightning paced 69-minutes. As underlined above, this Blu-Ray is gorgeous, with John Seitz’s cinematography looking like it hasn’t looked since 1933! The music score by Cliff Hess and Bernhard Kaun is okay, highlighted by riffs of W.C. Handy’s “St. Louis Woman” playing throughout – almost becoming Nan’s theme. I Like Mountain Music, a vintage Merrie Melodies, which may have originally supported the LADIES playdates, is also included.\n\nMARY STEVENS, M.D., gives so-fun-to-watch-her-suffer Kay Francis one of her best Warners pre-Code turns. As the title character, she is the brunt of many cruel, sexist snubs despite the fact that the lady sawbones is aces in her profession. Opening a clinic with her fellow graduate student pal Don Andrews proves to be…dare I say…a pill. Even with a guy in tow, a woman doctor has difficulties payin’ the rent (fortunately, she has wise-cracking Glenda Farrell as her all-purpose gal Friday nurse to keep the doom out of gloom). But Don has other plans: marrying a rich, beauteous harpy (the always welcome Thelma Todd) and getting her daddy to fund his super-duper clinic. Ta-ta, Mary. Turns out that although Dr. Andrews is a competent medical practitioner, he’s an absolutely brilliant drunk; he’s also a class-conscious, ladder-climbing under-achiever, who – even with all the breaks – can’t cut it (in or out of surgery; “the less I do, the more I make,” he smirks). Self-loathing, selfish Don is played by – who else? – Lyle Talbot. Prior to going on the lam for embezzlement, Andrews sets Mary up with an office in his swanky practice, transforming her into an overnight success. As a result, Stevens and Andrews move from just friends to friends with benefits – the main one being her soon-to-arrive little tax deduction (an adulterous encounter while ducking the authorities). Back then, all women of means, when faced with this situation, booked passage on the Loretta Young Cabbage Patch Tour. Mary, sporting a Rachel Maddow “do,” and accompanied by Glenda (that’s Farrell’s character’s name, too), takes off for Europe, eventually returning with a little bundle of joy.\n\nBefore the story ends with a surprising outcome for Drs. Stevens and Andrews, Mary proves that many things haven’t changed for career women in nearly 90 years. Unwanted pregnancy aside, the femme physician also deals with a brief suicidal moment and, more topically, a mini pandemic aboard an ocean liner because…well, you know, some folks don’t take precautions…like maybe wearing a masks when your brood is infected. All of this unspools at a sprightly 72-minutes. Warners house talent Lloyd Bacon moves Rian James’s, and Robert Lord’s script (based on Viginia Kellogg’s play, with William Keighley acting as dialog consultant) at a more-than-brisk pace. Like LADIES, MARY STEVENS utilizes some smokin’ Orry-Kelly frocks (when not wearing scrubs or prison gear) – so much so, that, frankly, he should share responsibility for Stevens’s blessed event. D.P. Sid Hickox, another Warners’ workhorse, shows us how terrific slick, quickly-made movies could look. The crystal-clear, shimmering monochrome is double-take stunning in this new 1080p High Def remaster. The fact that none of the female trouble (in both these sensational titles) would be “acceptable” within a year makes us grateful that this and all those other great pre-Codes made it to the theaters before mid-June, 1934.\n\nLADIES THEY TALK ABOUT\n\n(CAT# B09HMZTCSP).\n\nMARY STEVENS, M.D. (CAT# B09GKLZLD3).\n\n(both 1.37:1; 1080p High Definition); 2.0 DTS-HD MA. The Warner Archive Collection/Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. SRP: $21.99 @.\n\nThis title and others can be purchased at the Warner Archive Amazon Store or online retailers where DVDs and Blu-rays® are sold.\n\nThank God for Kino-Lorber Studio Classics and the 3-D Film Archive for keeping true (and rare) stereoscopic Blu-Rays alive, as evidenced by the recent releases of a pair of 1970’s chop-socky “classics,” DYNASTY and REVENGE OF THE SHOGUN WOMEN.\n\nAdmittedly, neither of these two Chinese imports would hold any special merit in most film archives. At least, flat. In 3-D, they’re kinda a big deal. The Seventies had a handful of 3-D releases, mostly porn – after the super-smash of The Stewardesses. 1973’s Andy Warhol’s Frankenstein (aka, Flesh for Frankenstein), too, made quite a splash. Other than that Third Dimension titles were kept to a minimum.\n\nThe 1977 unveiling of DYNASTY was practically an event picture for addicts of the process. The combo of 3-D and martial arts seemed like a natural. And it was. Add the Mystery Science Theater 3000 dubbing (even the horses are ludicrously synched, something I didn’t even envision possible!), the feature-length trailer plot, plus buckets of blood and flying limbs and you had an instant kitsch masterpiece.\n\nThe narrative (by Kuo-Hsiung Liu), taking place in the Ming Dynasty, hovers (like most martial arts pics do) around treachery, pillaging, and retribution. And, following that template, DYNASTY doesn’t disappoint. There’s even a Good, the Bad and the Ugly finale…on the side of a mountain!\n\nDirector Mei-Chun Chang pulls out all the stops, and the cast (Tao-Liang Tan, David Wei Tang, Taiko Rin, Kang Chin, Chang Ma, Yung-Hsing Chin, Chia-Chuan Tang) seems fairly game; costar Ying Bai even won a Best Supporting Actor award at that year’s Golden Horse Film Festival.\n\nBut the real star is 3-D (photographed in Super-Widescreen Super Touch 3-D 2.39 by Jung-Shu Chen, and supervised by Mike Findlay). Spears, swords, even body parts come flying out at the audience with great rapidity, resulting in many grindhouse “oh, shit!” moments. Even the non-effects shots are nicely-framed with background/foreground/center levels to enhance the feeling of 100% depth. Super Touch 3-D, BTW, was reportedly understandably a bigger hit in select Hong Kong movie houses, where it was showcased in the equivalent of today’s large format IMAX presentations. Producers didn’t scrimp on the sound, either. The tracks were recorded in the then-pre-digital/pre-surround catchword “Quad,” and, indeed, heralded on the posters as Quadrophonic Sound (the 4-track audio has been restored for this release, as have the 3-D elements – the latter nevertheless showing slight signs of negligence in the nearly fifty years since the pic’s debut; the audio is also accessible in 2.0 mono).\n\nKnowing what we know about restorations (particularly in 3-D from a non-major), it’s amazing that DYNASTY looks this good. Can’t credit the 3-D Archive gang enough. And, as usual, they loaded this disc with a plethora of enticing extras, including The House of Terror, a 1953 3-D comic book (comics had their own 3-D run in the early 1950s in an attempt to cash-in on the brief Hollywood momentum), two 3-D slide presentations from the Fifties: Sold on Stereo and Inside a Mid-Century Department Store, “Go Away I Like You Too Much,” a 3-D music video from The Simple Carnival (by Jeff Boller), a featurette on the Super Touch 3-D process, and more.\n\nThe movie is available for viewing in three versions: the real 3-D edition for owners of the specially-required TVs and Blu-Ray players, an anaglyph version (with two pairs of red and blue glasses provided), and a standard flat version. Be prepared to gasp, laugh, and duck with great regularity – sometimes simultaneously.\n\nWith the impressive success of DYNASTY worldwide, it was inevitable that there would be a follow-up. But perhaps not as soon as REVENGE OF THE SHOGUN WOMEN, released the same year in many territories, originally under the title 13 Nuns. Utilizing the word “Shogun” to straddle the bandwagon of the wildly successful American mini-series was a standard ploy for kung-fu importers back then, so the pic was re-released under its more famous moniker in the early 1980s.\n\nThe plot for WOMEN (as concocted by Huang-Kun Lin and Terry Chambers) is a lollapalooza, even if the execution is less so. In 1797, thirteen gorgeous women are en route to a monastery to become nuns when they are ravaged by rapacious bandits. They “carry on” in the best stoic condition, and complete their journey which, we happily discover, includes the mastery of kung fu. Not surprisingly, once emboldened, the women decide to extract their vengeance upon the pigs who defiled them. See, this should have been a pip. But it becomes a strictly by-the-numbers exercise. Maybe it was the rushed production to ride the coat tails of DYNASTY, maybe there were behind-the-scenes problems…who knows? The femmes (led by Shirley Han, Hsiu-Shen Liang, Shisuen Leong, Di Lin, and others) are never allowed to exhibit any notable histrionics, save “angry face” and “angrier face.” The fight scenes themselves are often presented in wide long shots, detaching the audience even more from the action and the actresses. This “enthusiasm” seems to have infected returning director Mei-Chun Chang. As indicated, this should have been a cheering-for-revenge, sexy, kicking, garroting, spearing, chopping, horse stomping cinematic coup. But it isn’t. Fortunately, like he had in DYNASTY, producer Frank Wong opted to have the visuals lensed in 3-D (again, relying upon the photographic expertise of Jung-Shu Chen). This becomes WOMEN‘s saving grace, as there are some cool formation shots, decent weapons in your face moments, and a “watch-out, muthafucka!” sequence with a lethal braid (not the ladies, they’re heads are shaved, it’s a traditional male queue).\n\nLike DYNASTY, the disc comes in three versions, as well as with some terrific extras, including two 1953 “nudie” shorts, College Capers and Persian Slave Market (screened in strip joints as a hopeful draw for the dying burlesque market). The latter defines “inept”; the former is a hoot with 40-year-old frat boys attempting a panty raid. Capers‘ 3-D is quite good, not surprising, as it is an early effort from the great d.p. Joe Biroc (plus, Ed Wood’s favorite babe, Dolores Fuller, is one of the co-eds). A third short, 1973’s Two Guys from Tick Ridge, is a redneck-made-good-in-Hollywood affair, exhibiting quite a bit of knowledge of the process’s Golden Age.\n\nAs a 3-D fanatic, I’m so thrilled that these obscure movies are available in these fantastic proper stereoscopic editions. I never thought they’d EVER see the light of day in the versions they were created for. Kino-Lorber and 3-D Film Archive, once again, I thank you!\n\nDYNASTY. Color.

LSS, they’ll likely all be gone by October.\n\nReleased in 1960 (with Alglo distribution on-hold until 1962), MILL OF THE STONE WOMEN, the first Italian horror movie to be shot in color, and based on a genuinely creepy short story by Pieter van Weigen, is proof (very) positive of the ever-spreading influence of Hammer Films worldwide. As early as 1958, clueless producers began inserting color sequences in their product – figuring that was the Hammer magic touch. Indeed, it took AIP and Roger Corman a full three years to realize that gothic charm was the real carrot to the British company’s success. Even then, the U.S. Poe adaptations never quite match the early Terence Fisher masterpieces.\n\nBut it was more than merely goth and color. There was a new, insidious and addictive sense of eroticism liberally dousing the baroque prim-and-proper proceedings. Ironically, Roger Vadim’s 1959 entry Blood and Roses (the overrated director’s only great pic) “got it,” but still remains unreleased on Blu-ray/4K; fortunately, he wasn’t alone. Other talents on the European continent prevailed, and the primo result is this Italian-French co-production, nicely scripted by Remigio Del Grosso and Louis Sauvat, with uncredited assist from Giorgio Stegani, Ugo Liberatore, and director Giorgio Ferroni (wearing his two hats ably), and superbly photographed by Pier Ludovico Pavoni.\n\nMILL OF THE STONE WOMEN, surely a contender for one of the oddest movie titles of all-time, is possibly the most deliberate attempt to ape Hammer in style and content. And it’s the most successful. In brief terms, it can be categorized as House of Wax meets Eyes Without a Face with a side of The Man who Could Cheat Death and a nod to the Gorgon legend (which Hammer would tackle four years later). Quite a lot for an hour-and-a-half.\n\nPlayed out among the hauntingly alluring Flemish countryside in the late Victorian era (and sumptuously filmed on-location in Holland and Belgium), MILL concerns the renowned artist Professor Wahl, who lives in an ancient mill/studio near the university where he teaches. But the mill is more than a mere residence. Housed on the main floor is an iconic museum featuring exquisite statues of females carved in orgiastic states of death and torture on a revolving carousel, created decades ago by the Wahl’s ancestor. To commemorate a celebration of this macabre crowd-pleaser, the community has commissioned Hans, a budding, young writer, to compose a monograph on the work and the family behind it. That he is also romantically involved with Liselotte, a beauteous promising student at the Professor’s academy is the enticing-icing on the cake.\n\nAs the unfaithful scribe is to learn, there are strange secrets at the mill, including Dr. Bohlem, a weird resident/voyeur who seems to pop in and out at inopportune times. But primarily there is Elfie, Professor Wahl’s (literally) drop-dead gorgeous daughter. Revealed to be suffering from a rare disease, the malady does not intrude upon Hans being a willing participant in Elfie’s seduction of the author. Since she is played by the sensually spectacular Scilla Gabel, it’s easy to see how this dangerous liaison happened. Soon, fetching locals are disappearing, most notably the popular model/whore, Annalore. Coinciding with these occurrences are new additions to the carousel…and remarkable recuperative powers from the oft bed-ridden (in more ways than one) vampiric succubus Elfie.\n\nThe chilling conclusion is an artistic kaleidoscope of visual fireworks – some hallucinatory, all sensational.\n\nMILL OF THE STONE WOMEN had a varied release, in no less than FOUR different versions: the Italian, the UK, the French, and the U.S. ALL FOUR ARE INCLUDED IN THIS TWO-DISC SET, housed in a sturdy, handsome slipcover. While the Euro versions highlighted its stunning cinematography in Eastman Color, the American prints were Technicolor – and as good as the process gets. Pavoni’s lavish photography is as near to Hammer’s Jack Asher’s (my bid for Hammer’s top d.p.) as one could wish. This is indeed one beautiful-looking movie (and disc). Because the Euro editions tended to be more graphic, running times vary (between 90 and 96 minutes). It’s definitely worth exploring them all. Admittedly, the English dubbing is occasionally like something out of a Second City sketch, so I suggest the French or Italian versions (with excellent English subtitles). Aside from the extraordinary Gabel, MILL features a game cast, including Pierre Brice (Hans), Herbert Boehme (Professor Wahl), Dany Carrel (Liselotte), Wolfgang Preiss (Dr. Bohlem), Liana Orfei (Annalore), and Marco Gugliemi, Olga Solbelli, and Alberto Archetti, . The excellent mono track contains an appropriately moody score by Carlo Innocenzi.\n\nThe splendidly restored imagery in 1080p High Def is certainly reason enough to purchase this eerie triumph. But the enormous amount of extras that Arrow has embodied the set with pushes a mere reason into no-brainer territory. Included as supplements are, as indicated, a quartet of different cuts, restored (but different) British and American dubbing, a wonderful fully-illustrated booklet with writing by Roberto Curti, comparisons between the four versions by Brad Stevens, a fold-out double-sided poster with the original and newly-commissioned artwork (the latter by Adam Rabalais), six double-sided postcard-sized lobbycards, audio commentary by Tim Lucas, a visual essay by Kat Ellinger, archival interviews with Liana Orfei and Wolfgang Preiss, still galleries, a collection of international trailers, and more.\n\nThat MILL precedes Bava’s Black Sunday/Black Sabbath duo and The Whip and the Body is yet another reminder of how influential this pic was. In conclusion, this is a limited edition classic horror fans won’t want to miss!\n\nMILL OF THE STONE WOMEN. Color. Widescreen [1.66:1; 1080p High Definition]; 1.0 DTS-HD MA. Arrow Video.

Now, by “owned,” I don’t mean that he physically had the Culver City studio as a property holding. I’m talking about artistically and, pretty much, commercially (by osmosis). The director had proved that he could practically do no wrong.\n\nEveryone with even a small amount of functioning braincells knew that he was the master of the musical, Metro’s most recognizable genre. But, by 1956, he showed us some considerable dramatic teeth as well. The Bad and the Beautiful, The Cobweb, and Lust for Life hit all the right targets, critically and at the box-office. Most remarkably (and delightfully), the talented Mr. Minnelli exhibited a spectacular flair for comedy, brilliantly on display with the 1950 smash Father of the Bride (and the equally successful 1951 sequel, Father’s Little Dividend). It came as no tremendous shock that, after coming off the ultra tragic biopic of Vincent van Gogh, MGM’s Vincente decided to pursue an extreme change of pace, and, as usual, did so with great panache, wit, charm, and creativity – as evidenced via two outstanding CinemaScope works, 1957’s DESIGNING WOMAN and 1958’s THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE – both now available in stunning new High Definition Blu-Ray transfers from The Warner Archive Collection.\n\nDESIGNING WOMAN shows Minnelli in top comedic form, as he effortlessly helps usher in the new “big” type of laff genre, so prevalent throughout the late 1950s-mid 1960s. What was new was the lavish budget, the emphasis on middle-upper-middle class characters, a fun albeit sneer-friendly wink-wink/nudge-nudge storyline, and the jettisoning of comedian stars in favor of pairings between actors/actresses you’d never expect in a wacky pseudo-sex romp. Here’s it’s Gregory Peck and Lauren Bacall. He’s a sports writer, she’s a magazine fashion designer/consultant. It’s fish oil out of water antics from frame one, involving gangsters, ex-lovers, show biz denizens, the New York theater scene, and 1950’s decolletage. The movie’s so frothy and infectious – and belies the behind-the-scenes drama, so much so that it’s amazing any of the pic’s enjoyability factor ever reached the screen. LSS, DESIGNING WOMAN was not a happy shoot. Bacall’s great love, Humphrey Bogart, passed nine months prior to production, after a long and gruesome battle with cancer. Yet, you wouldn’t know it from Betty’s courageous “carry on” professionalism. She’s often hilarious. Peck genuinely adored her (they had known each other in New York during their salad days, and were old pals, so their chemistry is the real McCoy). Bringing up the rear is a wonderful supporting cast, including Dolores Gray, Tom Helmore, Mickey Shaughnessy, Jesse White, Ed Platt, Chuck Connors, Alvy Moore, Jack Cole (who also served as choreographer), Madge Blake, Richard Deacon, Don Dillaway, Dean Jones, Stuart Holmes, Sid Melton, Benny Rubin, Max Showalter, and May McAvoy. A sprightly music score by Andre Previn appends the lavish wrapping, superbly photographed in (gorgeously restored) MetroColor and CinemaScope by the great John Alton. A mammoth hit, the mystery surrounding DESIGNING WOMAN isn’t how it turned out so well despite the dire filming circumstances, but rather how George Wells won an Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay – Written Directly for the Screen when even uninformed movie-goers knew this was a reboot of 1942’s Woman of the Year (minus the political ballast and a way-too-precious Katharine Hepburn). Suggested by an idea from designer Helen Rose, the most original narrative aspect is a Rashomon device wherein lead characters explain their varying versions of situations to the camera.\n\nDESIGNING WOMAN indeed paved the way for other they-ain’t-supposed-to-be-funny teamings, including Jose Ferrer/Gena Rowlands (The High Cost of Loving), Kirk Douglas/Susan Hayward (Top Secret Affair, originally slated for Bogart and Bacall), a post-Love Me or Leave Me/Man Who Knew Too Much Doris Day with Richard Widmark (Tunnel of Love), then, more prominently, opposite Rock Hudson in Pillow Talk (their co-starring almost becoming a sub-genre), and, even, Clark Gable/Sophia Loren (It Started in Naples) and Charlton Heston and Elsa Martinelli (The Pigeon that Took Rome)!\n\nAmazingly flourishing for a full decade, these boudoir romps only went limp via the new permissiveness. Not even Warren Beatty and Leslie Caron (Promise Her Anything) or the Newmans (Rally ‘Round the Flag, Boys, A New Kind of Love) could match The Graduate. It was the end of an era.\n\nI must spend a bit more time than usual on THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE for the simple reason that I absolutely love this movie. And always have. The picture is relatively unknown, and thoroughly deserves to be rediscovered. It’s a top-flight sophisticated romp costarring real-life marrieds Rex Harrison and Kay Kendall as reel-life marrieds Lord and Lady Broadbent. She’s his second wife, and is lovingly determined to make the most of their privileged lifestyle. To this end, she has devoted herself to grooming Jane (Sandra Dee), hubby’s visiting American teenage daughter from marriage #1, as debutante of the year (the pic opens with the title “London, 1958, “THE” Season”).\n\nNow, you reg’lar folks might be already yawning “who cares?” But, my fellow yanks, hold on to your hot dogs and apple pie, as this is a smooth, hilariously funny excursion performed by the best of the best. Harrison and Kendall are marvelous together, displaying an on-screen bonding relationship as good as any cinema romantic team. Kendall is perhaps the most underrated screen comedienne of the post-War era. It’s as if the word “madcap” was coined specifically for her (and I’m not alone. I can’t praise Eve Golden’s 2002 bio, The Brief, Madcap Life of Kay Kendall, highly enough; it’s simply one of the best entertainment biographies I’ve ever read). Indeed, the actress’s delivery, poise, beauty, and ability to segue from high-brow to slapstick never ceases to startle me. Her untimely death at 32 from leukemia was a true loss to The Movies (I can still remember my parents’ shock at her obit, both being big fans; not Flynn, Power, Gable, Cooper or Monroe rivaled their sadness. The only one who came close was Ernie Kovacs. That’s my mom and dad!). One scene had audiences roaring in ’58, and still bowls me over today. Kendall is talking to haughty friend Mabel Claremont (a wonderful Angela Lansbury performance) over the phone when she notices stepdaughter Jane poking around her proboscis. “Stop picking your nose!”, she ewws in disgust, then turns her apologetic attention back to Lansbury. Then the capper. “Oh, you were, too?” It’s comedy perfection.\n\nI’m also stunned whenever I enjoy Rex Harrision’s thesp skills, knowing that apparently everyone in the business hated his guts. And out of the business. And even his own children; suffice to say, he and Kay didn’t exactly have the nicest (albeit brief) run of wedded bliss (nowhere near Broadbent harmony). To digress, I cite an infamous Harrison moment. While basking in the success of the Broadway run of My Fair Lady, the acclaimed actor was enjoying an after-theater drink at a nearby posh watering hole. An exuberant admirer approached him to tell the star how much he loved his Professor Higgins turn. Harrison responded by violently shoving the man out of his way. The theater-goer retaliated by punching Rex square in the face. Close-by observer Stanley Holloway (Eliza’s father in the show) made history by quipping to his drinking mate, “Looks like the fan hit the shit.” And that’s pretty much all you need to know about Rex Harrison.\n\nBut back to DEBUTANTE. The “coming out” preps, gaffes, and everything else in-between are handled magnificently by director Minnelli, working from William Douglas Home’s script (based on his own popular play). Correctly surmising that American audiences might shy away from the toffee-nose proceedings, MGM brought in Julius J. Epstein\n\n(Yankee Doodle Dandy, Casablanca) to “Americanize” it. He did so brilliantly, by simply making Lord Broadbent’s daughter, Jane, a Yank, residing in the U.S. The sidebar plots include a budding romance between drummer David Parkson and Jane (John Saxon and Dee) and even an eyebrow-raising aside about upper crust sexual harassment/entitlement. BTW, it’s easy to see why Dee prefers Saxon; all the male Brit candidates are dullards (and the twist-on-the-twist capper is…well…poifect). The rest of the cast is as game as the leads and includes terrific bits by Peter Meyers, Ambrosine Phillpotts, and a particularly lovely, understated piece of acting from Diane Claire (a role that could have been bitchy, but is refreshingly molded into a nice Dee/BFF sisterhood nod).\n\nLike DESIGNING WOMAN, THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE was plagued by off-screen medical problems, namely Kendall’s already succumbing to the illness that would end her life the next year. On top of that, the actress’s doctors were not within reach, as the movie – although taking place in London – was actually entirely filmed in Paris. The reason was mercenary, as it was a tax haven dodge for Harrison despite his wife’s increasing health problems (it was later revised as being a legality issue, stating that at the time the actor could not work in either the U.S. or the UK; you be the judge).\n\nProduction dilemmas continued after the pic wrapped. Due to a musician’s strike, no original score was composed for the A-plus movie. In fact, no music could be recorded either. The entire score for DEBUTANTE is cobbled together from existing Metro library tracks, mostly from DESIGNING WOMAN, whose melody is heard over the main credits.\n\nThe picture debuted at Radio City Music Hall, where it did its best business. The reviews were ecstatic, but, once outside of the big cities, DEBUTANTE tanked big time. After cost/promotion deductions, the worldwide gross was an astonishingly tepid $3030! Minnelli, still at his peak, was not effected career-wise; two other MGM releases he directed in 1958 went through the roof: Gigi and Some Came Running. What a year!\n\nThe new Warner Archive Blu-Ray of THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE sumptuously befits its subject matter. The restored MetroColor looks sensational in 1080p High Definition (d.p. Joseph Ruttenberg would be quite proud) with an excellent mono track. Regarding the latter, the original audio was recorded in a pre-Dolby stereo process known as Perspecta (the logo is clearly seen in the credits). I imagine these tracks no longer exist, a big shame, although, as indicated, the sound reproduction is just fine.\n\nWith so little starring material on Kendall available, I am doubly thrilled by this Blu-Ray release. I at once contacted the aforementioned Ms. Golden, who likewise expressed her joy that this obscure title was getting another chance. “Kay has that wonderful offhand ‘just wandered in and making it up’ quality in DEBUTANTE that she brings to most of her films. Like Bob Newhart and Jack Benny, she plays very well off of characters who are idiots.” Eve also reminded me that in addition to the excruciating pain caused by the rapidly spreading leukemia, “she had also just broken her pelvis in a tobogganing accident.” Talk about a trouper! FYI, Eve’s Kendall book is now in paperback. You have no excuse! Buy it!\n\nDESIGNING WOMAN and THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE.

Hey, he might be me – or even you…if it wasn’t for the unfortunate fact that he’s also a serial killer, rapist…and (gasp) a fisherman!\n\nIt’s Red’s latest vocational skill, that of an extortionist, that warrants our discussion, since he’s actually the main character – and certainly the most interesting one – in Blake Edwards’ great 1962 noirish thriller EXPERIMENT IN TERROR, now available for microscopic inspection in a limited edition from Twilight Time/Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.\n\nNow let me say up front that while I enjoy many of the movies Blake Edwards is famous for – specifically the Peter Sellers comedies, I far more prefer his darker, nastier explorations of the human condition.\n\nEdwards, of course, started out co-scripting vest pocket noirs with Richard Quine at Columbia, then wrote and/or directed a labyrinth of hard-boiled TV programs (Mind Over Murder; Mike Hammer; The Lineup; Mr. Lucky; Richard Diamond), before scoring big with the Peter Gunn series in 1958. Pursuant to the latter, I am a big fan of the virtually forgotten 1967 Gunn movie…and also long for a complete version of his butchered 1973 abortion mystery The Carey Treatment. I’d like to add that my favorite Edwards-obscura is the 1957 Tony Curtis crime drama Mister Corey, a CinemaScoped Blu-Ray I wish Universal would serve up to at least compensate for their 900 E.T.: The Umpteenth I’ve-Had-Enough-of-this-Shit Editions.\n\nEXPERIMENT IN TERROR, one of a gaggle of major studio releases following in the wake of Psycho, crept onto the screens the same year as Aldrich’s What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\n\nWhile less of a camp outing, it is no less a freak show. And the 123-minute black-and-white roller-coaster ride doesn’t waste a minute. No sooner does drop-dead gorgeous Kelly Sherwood (aka drop-dead gorgeous Lee Remick) arrive home from her job as a bank teller than her borderline-normal (i.e. boring) world is shattered. She’s attacked in her garage by a phantom-cloaked maniac, whose only identifiable trait is his heavy asthmatic breathing. Guess who? Yup, it’s Red Lynch.\n\nLynch has mastered the art of terror to instantly bring his newest victim to her breaking point. His demand: steal 100k from her bank…or suffer the consequences…To underline the fact that he’s thoroughly researched his target, he threatens Remick with an appended ultimatum: do not refuse or contact the authorities “…or I’ll kill your sister.”\n\nNow while – kinship-wise – this personally wouldn’t bother me, it does upset Kelly, as Toby, her beloved teenaged sib, is the almost as beauteous (and up-and-coming starlet) Stefanie Powers (the two live together, Remick acting as surrogate mom).\n\nOne of the picture’s most frightening sequences follows. Thinking she’s safe in her secured home, she logically contacts the FBI…only to have Lynch leap out in a startling you-think-I’m-fucking-kidding?! sociopathic display of inappropriate behavior. Lovingly snuffing her face into the carpet, he grinds his foot into the back of her neck, repeating his demands and threats.\n\nAlas for Lynch, Kelly did manage a telling thirty seconds of phone time, and was lucky enough to capture the attention of agent Glenn Ford, who, with less to go on that the law enforcement factions who solved the Boston marathon bombings, locates the shaken-but-not-stirred woman.\n\nThis is the basic set-up for the narrative, and it’s a honey. EXPERIMENT IN TERROR, above anything else, is a movie that relentlessly succeeds in twisting a knife in the viewers’ guts via its theme of invasion of privacy. That’s the main tag here. Reflecting the then volatile fear-of-frying atomic-political climate, Kelly and everyone else immediately go on paranoid alert (the movie’s working title was Grip of Fear). LSS, no one is safe in 1960s America; to this distressing goal, the advent of technology is alarmingly demonstrated to work both ways. That no idiot producer has thought to remake this underrated classic – with the even more potent threat of identity theft and persecution in the cyber 2020s – is a solemn nod to the probable fact that these boneheads have no idea this movie exists.\n\nAnyways, Remick’s performance is so (no pun) on the money that you’re really grieve for her. All of a sudden, her coworkers, neighbors, passersbys – even the FBI agents – are all suspect. This is in perfect contrast to Ford, in one of his finest portrayals. Now at first look, you might think: What are you saying? He’s acting by-the-numbers…almost phoning it in. Check it out again. He’s keen on getting facts, and it’s only after he receives them that he becomes thoroughly detached and disinterested with his “clients.” Craggy, weary and displaying the shellacked hairdo from the era where the aging star seemingly decreed to combat advancing years by dipping the top of his head in a tar bucket, Ford is apathy personified.\n\nIn one incredible scene, he listens to Remick do her best to provide details. When done, she almost collapses in sobbing shock. Once Ford has processed the pertinent information, you can actually see the switch go off in his head: her concerns mean nothing to him; he’s got what he wanted and needed. As Kelly pours her heart out, Ford impatiently taps his wrist, looks at his watch…he just really isn’t that interested. Insult to injury, he then honestly reveals what Lynch will do to get her to pull off the heist; in effect, he’s scaring Remick with the same predatory gory stuff Lynch did. Ford’s agent Ripley is Lynch’s doppelganger. I’m not kidding. Two secondary victims – a silent movie addict/informant named Popcorn (Ned Glass) – and a seductive Anne Bancrofty mannequin artist (Patricia Huston) are sloughed off as pathetic expendables, even when the latter ends up hanging upside-down slaughterhouse-style alongside her plaster of Paris arms and legs. Ford nonchalantly muses to another agent that he guessed wrong about her involvement in the case and calmly exits the crime scene. Later, an equally cold-blooded cohort remarks of another fatality, “Bound to happen…Can’t expect to live forever.” Ford does everything but respond with, “Say, I don’t know about you – but I could sure go for a hoagie.”\n\nFord reminds me very much of Robert Ryan in Nicholas Ray’s 1951 gem On Dangerous Ground. While not as outwardly psychotic, there is that same detached connection. I’m especially referring to a scene where Ryan confronts a blind Ida Lupino, who is instantly attracted to him because he’s the first one who hasn’t been condescending to her, or, more precisely, her affliction…a mistaken emotion, as the cop’s m.o. is that he simply doesn’t care.\n\nMost prominently, Ford’s sober I-don’t-wanna-hear-your-crap attitude is a direct descendent of his own incarnation of detective Bannion in Lang’s The Big Heat. Ripley could be Bannion ten years later…like in the concurrent wildly popular Paladin ballad, “A knight without honor in a savage land…”, the terra firma in question being Kennedy’s Camelot.\n\nLee Remick’s psychologically pulverized woman at the picture’s taut conclusion isn’t comforted by Ford (the usual wrap-up in a million other crime movies and TV episodes). The job is over; he couldn’t care less what happens to her. He walks off frame.\n\nThe climax in question unfolds at San Francisco’s Candlestick Park (offering viewers the unintentional jolt of ringside seats to a Giants game for $2.50!); it’s an exciting location, reminiscent of another SF-based police thriller, Siegel’s Dirty Harry, filmed almost a decade later. The nocturnal, fog-enshrouded Frisco locale is used to stunning, if not chilling effect and is played out in the community of Twin Peaks, which I suspect likewise inspired another Lynch.\n\nMany of the “terror” sequence compositions seem to have additionally emboldened a slew of giallo directors, including Mario Bava and Dario Argento…as well as Sergio Martino and Umberto Lenzi. Edwards has also acquiesced to Alfred Hitchcock’s Politically Incorrect Guide to Film Mayhem. Turn off the sound during some of the confrontational scenes between Lynch and Remick and they could be misinterpreted as rapturous intimate couple moments. In the proper context, however, these segments comprise some of the creepiest visuals in Edwards’ canon, save exposing Julie Andrews’ breasts in S.O.B.\n\nOf course, Red is the Lynch-pin holding the tense narrative together. He’s also the movie’s most complex character – the only one fully-developed. Although seen largely in shadow or disguise, we know more about him than we do of Kelly, Toby or even Ripley (believe it or not, a recurring character in several of the writers’s books, upon which this movie was based on). And it’s frustrating. For the majority of the picture’s two hour-plus running time, I was champing at the bit for someone to kill Lynch. Then Edwards throws a wild pitch: Lynch has a serious girlfriend whom he treats lovingly and compassionately, even paying the thousands of dollars to treat her son’s physical disability. The result is that I ceased to want Lynch killed…now I only wanted him maimed. Lynch is superbly played by Ross Martin (whose identity, as part of the picture’s promotion, was withheld until the very end). While the movie did well critically and chalked up decent box office, it was Martin who ultimately reaped the rewards for his performance. His chameleon expertise garnered him the plum supporting role of Artemis Gordon in the long-running hit television series The Wild, Wild West.\n\nKelly’s increasingly fragile mental state makes her suspicious of even inanimate objects; everyday utensils (especially the telephone) become objects of terror. Lynch’s “experiment” is to envelop Sherwood into a world governed completely by fear, humiliation and degradation – essentially the current GOP playbook should any moderate Republican even consider running for office. This intrusive horror bodily manifests itself in a shocking sequence where Kelly’s space is defiled by the ultimate invasion: Lynch-in-drag cornering her in the ladies room of a restaurant (made all the more grating by his apparent decision to model his old lady impersonation after Lionel Barrymore in Devil Doll).\n\nThe script doesn’t miss a trick – one of the few forays into screenwriting by the husband and wife team, The Gordons. That the male Gordon’s first name was also Gordon is likely a parental faux pas I surmise to have been his own adolescent experiment in terror. Bizarrely enough, the duo’s most famous motion-picture work was That Darn Cat!, filmed by Disney in 1965, starring Hayley Mills and Dean Jones. Like Operation Terror (the name of the novel), the story concentrated on the importance of surveillance in contemporary crime detection (Gordon Gordon spent World War II working for the FBI in counter-intelligence).\n\nThe Blu-Ray of EXPERIMENT IN TERROR is aces in all departments. The spectacular black and white photography by Philip Lathrop has never looked as crystal clear. Rich in dark velvety tones and ominous spectral imagery, Lathrop’s sinister canvas truly paints a nightmarish vision of the city. While the old DVD looked okay – the B-D is a revelation, truly befitting the picture’s trappings of noir voyeurism.\n\nThe sound is even better. Henry Mancini’s eerie jazzy score is one of his best, certainly my favorite of all his Edwards projects. A couple of years ago, in a jazz club, I was ecstatic when a combo segued into a version of the title theme. Apparently, one of the musicians caught sight of my delighted approval and approached me afterward.\n\n“You must be a movie fan,” he announced to me, hand extended.\n\n“So must you,” I replied.\n\nHe nodded, and proudly explained that a baptism by fire prerequisite for all new musicians to the group was to do a cover of EXPERIMENT IN TERROR.\n\nIndeed, the spine-tingling main title has become a standard for seriously cool jazz and rock ‘n’ roll bands (there is a rock version in the movie, playing on Kelly’s car radio).\n\nWhat’s particularly terrific about this B-D is that the audio is in authentic stereo. I never knew the movie was recorded that way; maybe it wasn’t (certainly no other screening/video master was ever released in anything but mono), but the music surely was. It’s awesome to have that main track fill the room in full digitally-cleansed 5.1 stereo. The soundtrack, like all Twilight Time offerings, can be accessed in IST (Isolated Score Track), which allows film music fans to access the Mancini work as a CD album.\n\nThe platter comes with two theatrical trailers and two sixty second TV spots. One of each is a strange take on the pic’s promotion (utilizing the jittery opening montage), the other more traditional. Curiously, we are told by the narrator that the movie uniquely “…uses San Francisco as its laboratory” – something I naturally assumed all stimulant-minded people did back then.\n\nEXPERIMENT IN TERROR. Black and white. Letterbox [1.85:1; 1080p High Definition]; 5.1 stereo-surround DTS-HD MA. Twilight Time/Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. SRP: $24.95.\n\nNothing defines guilty pleasure entertainment more than big budget Hollywood sextravaganzas, ca mid-1950s-mid-1960s. The key players in this cinematic flesh peddling can be whittled down to two dubious “artistes,” legendary producer/exploiter Joseph E. Levine and legendary author/exploiter Harold Robbins.\n\nBut first (as opposed to butt first) a wee history lesson.\n\nBefore Levine plied his trade in the rich and infamous genre, there was Ross Hunter and Douglas Sirk. Their Fifties Technicolor soaps, Magnificent Obsession and All That Heaven Allows pretty much elevated Universal-International to…well, universal international status. It made a mega-star out of studio contractee Rock Hudson and gave new life to older female stars like Jane Wyman…By the time Albert Zugsmith (auteur of High School Confidential, Sex Kittens Go to College…to say nothing of Touch of Evil and The Incredible Shrinking Man) came along, the pattern was ripe for ascension to the next salacious level. Written on the Wind not only did this in spades, recounting its saga of the filthy (in more ways than one) rich Texas Hadleys – but, as personified via the deviant brother/sister combo of impotent psycho Robert Stack and nympho (accent on the ‘ho’) Dorothy Malone, broke all box office records. One of the era’s most memorable celluloid moments – Malone fondling a desk ornament oil derrick – probably won her that deserved Best Supporting Actress Oscar….But, more importantly, it opened the flood gates.\n\nPeyton Place, a brown paper wrapper best seller, was considered unfilmable. Them’s fighin’ words for an industry struggling with dwindling theater attendance…and 20th Century-Fox pulled out all the stops to bring it to the screen. The super production smashed existing house records worldwide – and recharged star Lana Turner’s fizzling career (as well as giving her a Best Actress nomination). That Turner was then embroiled in a real-life sex scandal – beyond anything in the pages of Grace Metalius’ smoldering pages – certainly didn’t hurt. Turner, whose current lover, gangland maven Johnny Stompanato, died of unnatural causes in the bedroom the pair shared. This termination was due to the actress’ teenage daughter plunging a Dario Argento-friendly carving utensil into his heart. This story became the hottest headline ticket since Sputnik – and sold papers for months and months. Speculation on what really happened (was the teen taking the heat from mom, was she raped by the thug, were the both sharing the stud – finally causing a jealous rage eruption?…) culminated in tabloid manna from heaven.\n\nCue sleazy writer Harold Robbins, who saw an ideal way to cash in on this tragedy. By changing the names, professions (actress to artist)– adding more drama (if possible), making up ludicrous sexual antics to bookmark his text, he published WHERE LOVE HAS GONE…The book became an in-your-face hit – and created a cottage industry for the writer and his soon-to-be media partner in crime…\n\nCue Joseph E. Levine. Like many of his predecessors, Levine began as an exhibitor; soon he realized that the real reel money lay in producing…and, through a series of outlandish stunts (armed guards standing over an opened crate containing a million dollars – the amount he spent on promoting the cheaply-acquired Italian pickup, Hercules), and savvy acumen (he was the first to see the value in importing the likes of Godzilla)…he was on his way. Through some unscrupulous dealings and sub-dealings with Paramount, Levine parlayed his low rent beginnings into amazing longevity – truly becoming the last of the colorful (and slimy) moguls. To quote Laurence Harvey in A Dandy in Aspic, that Levine should team up with Robbins was “…as obvious as a whore in a creaky bed.”\n\nLevine’s alternate buddy relationship with Paramount is so convoluted and labyrinthian that, to this day, scads of industry legal eagles have no clue who owns the rights to what. Deals were made so that Paramount would control American distribution – while Levine, through his Embassy Pictures banner – would keep Europe and the Middle East; then, after a time, the music would stop – and the roles and rights would be switched. This became even more complicated when subsequently extended to television and, later home video. Posters thus exist on many Paramount titles – with Embassy logos…and vice versa. The sex pics were the big studio jackpots; the smaller art house pickups (like Divorce Italian Style and Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow) would be totally Levine property. Ironically, these arty flicks with their undeniably sensual and erotic content, soon became cross-over hits – rivaling the lushly-produced all-star epics divvied up to the majors. Generally, Levine ended up the victor – losing only once when he foolishly gave Paramount all but the American rights to 1964’s Zulu, which, did moderately well in the States – but cleaned up in blockbuster revenues overseas (it briefly became the UK’s all-time box office champ, usurped a year later by Thunderball).\n\nWith Robbins, Levine and Paramount engaged in a vigorous threesome – the next hand to be dealt with was the scripting. John Michael Hayes, the brilliant prolific writer of such Hitchcock classics as Rear Window, To Catch a Thief and The Trouble With Harry had bolted from the famed director’s grip when he all-too-quickly realized that greatest suspense from the heralded Master of Suspense was receiving a decent paycheck. Hayes penned Fox’s Peyton Place – and thereby was considered prime cut for the Paramount-Levine-Robbins triad. His penchant for adding witty dialogue to otherwise stolid and clichéd situations would elevate these movies to kitsch magnificence.\n\nWhen The Carpetbaggers sucked up millions of tickets on both sides of the pond, all involved knew they had made the right decision. Next up was the big screen adaptation of WHERE LOVE HAS GONE. In a case of art imitating life, many still believe that Lana Turner stars in this lurid expose. In all fairness, it’s a reasonable faux pas – due to A) the film’s obscurity in the 58 years since its release, and B) post-Peyton Place, Turner did indeed relegate herself to this kind of movie – appearing in such lip-smacking tantalizing titles as By Love Possessed, Love Has Many Faces, an updated umpteenth version of Madame X, and, most notoriously, The Big Cube – wherein the one-time MGM diva takes an LSD trip. Appearing in Robbins’ sensational rendition of her life would have been a step up. It’s Susan Hayward who has the Turner part – and if you think she cried tomorrow back in 1955 – you ain’t seen nothing yet. She’s not only crying but screaming, drinking, whoring – and even painting and sculpting. The long-suffering fictional ex-spouse is Mike Connors, whom, along with Hayward and her harpie mother’s help, quickly degenerates from a promising architect into a drunken womanizing scumbag – all within the running time of a standard Mack Sennett short. Firmly entrenched in Manchurian Candidate fetal position, it’s the evil mother who scene steals the proceedings…and who better to be a predatory bitch on wheels than Bette Davis? – dressed and coiffed like a primer for Drag Queens For Dummies. To say that Davis’ incarnation of this ultimate mother from hell makes her Little Foxes characterization look like Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch is a gross understatement. Then there’s the smoking smoking gun (or butcher knife) teenage murderess – Joey Heatherton in her debut – whose on-camera emoting and pouting as a potential Lolita wannabee could never match the WTF sexual events that plagued her off the soundstages. What can I say – she was a Harold Robbins car wreck waiting to happen! We can go on about George Macready at his Macreadiest as an oily lawyer or DeForrest Kelley as a horny art critic – but just mentioning it becomes self-explanatory. The A-plus production values, the fantastic supporting cast (framed in ebullient Technicolor and TechniScope by the great Joe MacDonald), the sappy Jack Jones’ title song…all add up for a rollicking time for viewers and fans of great trash movies. Olive Films have secured a perfect transfer – in both picture and sound; Blu-Ray audiences in search of camp will be delighted from fade in to fade out!\n\nWith The Carpetbaggers still raking it in by the truckload, Levine and Paramount decided to continue down a similar road. Robbins’ prime literary targets had always been crazed degenerates modeled after the likes of Howard Hughes and Jean Harlow; Carroll Baker scored big as the Harlow character in Carpetbaggers – so when Irving Shulman’s god-awful biography of the platinum blonde hit the bookshelves in the mid-Sixties, the wily producer immediately took an option. Shulman’s work was more of a mystery than a biography – they mystery being for any reader to find one iota of truth within the text. Only Jean, her parents, Paul Bern and Arthur Landau remained within this demented fantasy; no mention of Gable, William Powell, MGM or even Laurel & Hardy. Landau was only implicated, due to his participation in the book’s publication; he had been Harlow’s agent – but more on him later (Note: If you crave the real dope on Harlow, seek out Eve Golden’s marvelous 1991 biography, Platinum Girl: The Life and Legends of Jean Harlow). Another curiosity was why the usually sharp Levine didn’t know that a rival production company was simultaneously preparing a Harlow bio-pic, based on the same tome. Made on a remarkably shabby scale, the alternate 1965 Harlow, filmed in gritty black and white, starred another Carol – minus the extra ‘R’ and ‘L’, surnamed Lynley. This backyard version, featuring Ginger Rogers as the clinging mother, portrayed by Angela Lansbury in the Levine evocation, was released by Electrovision – the company known primarily throughout the 1960s for their live big screen theater-casts of prize fights. With Paramount behind him and a budget easily triple the Lynley pic, Levine’s HARLOW K.O.-ed its monochrome feeble clone in the first round.\n\nSnagging Hayes to once again create the screenplay, Paramount’s HARLOW has some cool things going for it – if non-discriminating viewers are willing to eschew the art of fact-checking from frame one. The opening credit scene, anachronistic clothes and hairstyles aside, is one of the picture’s best moments – an early morning studio extra call that’s right out of Day of the Locust. Accompanied by Neal Hefti’s cool soundtrack and Gordon Douglas’ smooth direction, HARLOW, while 100% outrageous nonsense, is never boring. Douglas, who like the title star, began at Hal Roach, was obviously having a lot of fun; thus, the embryonic sequences of Jean getting pie-smacked, ass-sprayed and wardrobe malfunctioned have an authentic air of vintage slapstick. The aforementioned Hefti score, while indeed terrific, is nevertheless as out of place as the mod look visualized in club scenes and pushin’-in-the-cushion partying. With its electric organ a-pumping more vigorously than the libido-fueled cast members– the music is about as 1930s as the go-go boots worn by various females sprinkled throughout Joseph Ruttenberg’s spectacularly Technicolored and Panavision-composed visuals.\n\nBaker, essentially reprising her Carpetbaggers role, plays it like a Barbie doll on Spanish Fly – and looks amazingly gorgeous. If the method actress took the money and ran with the Robbins adaptation – she took it, ran, sprinted over the Paramount gate and fled to Europe for 14 years with this haul. Americans unfamiliar with her gialli efforts pretty much associate her with these two Levine portrayals – probably even before Baby Doll, which put her on the sex goddess map.\n\nApparently no one told co-stars Lansbury and Raf Vallone what was really going down, as they are actually acting – giving the movie it’s only true thespian pedigree. As Harlow’s parasitic parents, they run the gamut from repulsive to funny to poignant – presenting a bona fide flip side to the remaining cast members.\n\nWhich brings us to Red Buttons. As cherubic as ever, Buttons plays the previous-discussed Arthur Landau. Seeing Jean’s potential, this oh-he’s-so-cute-you-just-wanna-pinch-his-cheeks walking dashboard troll figurine takes the aspiring starlet under his wing. When she admits that she can’t pay him, he pooh-poohs her. He’ll pay HER! Both he and his equally-goody-goody wife shell out her expenses, nurture and support her through thick and thin. We wonder if this depiction had anything to do with the real Landau’s hovering over the book and the movie; not that we’re suspicious, as we all know that Hollywood agents by nature are loving, sweet non-mercenary benevolent souls. Of course, this doesn’t prevent Landau from essentially pimping her to a Hughesian womanizing millionaire-turned-director. Enter Leslie Nielsen as super stud Dick Manley (I SWEAR I’m not making this up – jeez Hayes must have had a ball with this movie!). With one swift well-placed kick, that wacky Jean effectively disables his naked gun, dives into Red Button’s waiting sedan – and the pair drive off into pre-smog horizon. Early on, Jean told her agent that she’s a virgin (Harlow’s actual first marriage is never mentioned – then again, why am I even bringing this up?!!!) and can’t stand men touching her. Buttons, like all of us in the audience, figures his client to be a frigid freakazoid…but no – here comes the twist on the twist…Jean is a carnal-charged unstoppable animal, and fears that if she let’s her guard down, she’ll man-eat more dudes than Simon Simone in Cat People.\n\nBy the time impotent nutjob Paul Bern (a laughable Peter Lawford, as if there’s any other kind) marries Jean, reveals himself and blows his brains out – the platinum dye has been cast for the volatile third act. It’s here that Jean Harlow becomes Jean Harlot – laying more pipe than Roto-Rooter – even attempting to rape step-father Vallone, who, in this narrative, turns out to be a right guy. As he strives to adjust his step-daughter’s askew moral compass, Baker, tear-stained and mascara-dripping delivers her bid for an Oscar nomination – spouting a speech in decided Ronnie Spector whine wherein she realizes that the bad men in her life are not so bad – and the good ones are not so good. Indeed words that all girls whose boyfriends own 4K video cams should live by. Unfortunately, this knowledge comes way too late. As with all sexually-active Hollywood-portrayed women, Jean’s liberation is her death-knell; in short, she’s toast within ten minutes – the result of an all-nighter climaxed by the beloved unloved movie star deliriously wandering along the ocean front like Baby Jane Hudson.\n\nTruth may be stranger than fiction – but not as strange as fiction purporting to be truth (and certainly not as hilarious). If you’ve never seen HARLOW, you owe yourself a treat. The Blu-Ray is a knockout – looking and sounding even better than WHERE LOVE HAS GONE. Those in search of cinematic junk food need search no further than this pair of High Definition doozies.\n\nWHERE LOVE HAS GONE CAT # OF338\n\nHARLOW CAT # OF689\n\n(both color, mono; Letterboxed [2.35:1]; 1080p High Definition; dual layer)\n\nOlive Films/Paramount Home Video. SRP: $24.95@."
