        "text": "Emma Dialectical Journal\n\n1177 Words | 5 Pages\n\nEmma has an addiction to Rodolphe; the person she runs to when she wants to get away from her life and go to another place. Emma and Rodolphe’s relationship is on pause for a little while; wanted nothing to do with him until her husband, Charles, became too much for her to deal with. He became an embarrassment to her after he failed to cure a man of a clubfoot. Only then did she run to her lover, who takes her away to a secret place where she can be oblivious of her problems. 2.“You're my king, my idol!\n\nLike Water For Chocolate Rhetorical Analysis Essay\n\n1085 Words | 5 Pages\n\nThe discovery of a new “communication” technique for the longing “couple” is captured in a very sensual way to show the lengths love can make you go, “With that meal, it seemed they had discovered a new system of communication, in which Tita was the transmitter, Pedro the receiver, and poor Gertrudis the medium, the conducting body through which the singular sexual message was passed”(52). Hyperbole is an exaggeration of speech, describing or saying something you have done, will do, or has happened that is not meant to be taken in a literal sense. Esquivel uses the literary device to describe a sensual moment between her and the person she loves, Pedro, to describe the lengths they have gone to continue a forbidden relationship. Their new way of communication through food is powerful as it shows the lengths they will go to get to each other, but also as it gets you to think about their love and how the desire to partake in something they have not yet experienced with each other is causing them to go through these lengths to experience love. Esquivel uses the scene of a wedding to depict the extreme wanting and longing of love and desire and its effects, “The moment they took their first bite of the cake, everyone was flooded with a great longing”(39).\n\nReturn Of Martin Guerre Quotes\n\n1027 Words | 5 Pages\n\nWith Martin, she only ever stuck to the duties a woman normally sticks to, but Arnaud is a merchant. When a woman’s husband is a merchant, she is allowed to engage in merchant activities as well, thus with Arnaud Bertrande’s sphere of freedom expands. She gets more opportunities to experience the world around her aside from the normal confinement a woman has to her house. Bertrande seizes this chance for independence to the fullest, and “What Bertrande had with the new Martin was her dream come true,” (44). For not only does she get more freedom with him by being a merchant, but she also fulfils her previous more mature independent desire for a partner she genuinely likes.\n\nForeshadowing In The Judges Wife\n\n531 Words | 3 Pages\n\nAs Vidal expressed his disapproval of Casilda, imagery is very evident. “This ethereal slip of a girl in her wedding gown, eyes filled with wonder, and fingers obviously unskilled in the art of rousing a man to pleasure, seemed to him almost ugly.” (Pg.283) These lines describe to the audience how Vidal saw Casilda on her wedding day. He sees her as innocent and inexperienced as he describes some of her features.\n\nMaking Assumptions In 'Soul Of Caliban'\n\n1050 Words | 5 Pages\n\nEmma Lindsay Squier wrote, “Amelie screamed. . . Leon came running with a face the color of\n\nLove In The Play Cyrano De Bergerac\n\n601 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe play Cyrano de Bergerac is about a love triangle between Roxane, Cyrano, and Christian. Christian and Cyrano desire Roxane’s love, but Christian has the upper hand because of his outer beauty. Cyrano writes letters conveying his love to Roxane, but allows Christian to use them as his own. Christian wins Roxane’s heart by deceit and eventually realizes that Roxane only loves the fake version of him. Although Christian uses Cyrano, he is a noble and honest man because he wants to tell Roxane regardless of how he feels about her.\n\nAdeline Mowbray And The Anti-Jacobin Movement\n\n1209 Words | 5 Pages\n\nThe end of the eighteenth - beginning of the nineteenth century England was characterized by the downfall of the revolutionary “Jacobin” movement which advocated for freedom and equality, and symbolizes a return to, as well as an empowerment of the conservative British patriarchal system. This was the context in which Amelia Anderson Opie wrote “her most political novel”(King and Pierce, viii) Adeline Mowbray, a tale which provides a case study about, as Roxane Eberle notes, “progressive ideas that heterosexual relationships can and should exist outside of marriage”(1994: 127). As a result the clash between these innovational type of relationships and the English legal and social norms collide in their representation of models of proper conduct for women. Although Opie’s fiction is roughly known or read nowadays, her writing technique made her be considered one of the representative women authors of that period.\n\nFlaubert's Relationship In A Simple Heart\n\n532 Words | 3 Pages\n\nOne of the most interesting (and probably the strangest) things that I found in Flaubert’s “A Simple Heart” was the relationship between Félicité and her parrot Loulou. From the very beginning, the relationship between the two proved extremely significant to Félicité as the bird brought a little bit of happiness into her miserable life that had been plagued with loss and death. The bird was such an important companion to her that after his death, she could hardly handle it and was completely distraught. In fact, “she cried so much her mistress said ‘All right, then—have him stuffed’” (page 281).\n\nThe Legend Of Sleepy Hollow Individualism Essay\n\n398 Words | 2 Pages\n\nAnd in this respect is must be noted that, “As a romantic heroine, she continues to cross boundaries in terms of the expectations of her gender” (\"LITR 5535, American Romanticism,\n\nMean Girls Chapter Summaries\n\n480 Words | 2 Pages\n\nBack home in Brazil she met a tourist named Luca. She spent a few weeks with him and quickly fell in love. Ever since he left Brazil she has been heartbroken and on the search for her lover. When she accepts the au pair job she starts her search for Luca right away. On her first night her and Eliza get invited to a club and they go.\n\nLove is a complicated affair, it involves the two lives of the couples and the lives of everyone around them. There are many factors that could break or make a relationship, for one to be successful they must be able to succeed in all of those factors. Oscar Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest delves into these factors regarding love and marriage. Wilde stresses the importance of social status and gender expectations as a key guideline for a successful marriage. For Wilde, social status is defined as birth, wealth, and power.\n\nThe play An Ideal Husband was written by Oscar Wilde in 1895 in England’s Victorian era. This era was characterised by sexual anarchy amongst men and women where the stringent boundaries that delineated the roles of both men and women were continually being challenged by threatening figures such as the New Woman represented by Mrs Cheveley and dandies such as Lord Goring(Showalter, 3). An Ideal Husband ultimately affirms Lord Goring’s notions about the inequality of the sexes because of the evident limitations placed on the mutability of identity for female characters versus their male counterparts (Madden, 5). These limitations will be further elaborated upon in the context of the patriarchal aspects of Victorian society which contributed to the failed attempts of blackmail by Mrs Cheveley, the manner in which women are trapped by their past and their delineated role of an “angel of truth and goodness” (Powell, 89).\n\nTheme Of Friendship In Ferrante's My Brilliant Friend\n\n904 Words | 4 Pages\n\nWithout these moments, it would be impossible to tell the well rounded story of their lives and friendship, for it is truly the simple moments of joy that make life compelling. A central moment of joy for Elena is spending a summer in Ischia with Maestra Oliviero’s cousin Nella. She describes “for the first time I was leaving home […] the neighbourhood and Lila’s troubles grew distant, and vanished” (Ferrante 209), and within this joy she “blossomed” (209). Life in Ischia is diametric to the neighbourhood Elena leaves behind. Nella is described as kind, enthusiastic, and encouraging, while Elena’s mother is seen as bitter, and resentful.\n\nAs a writer one is greatly influenced by their personal experiences with social, historical, and cultural context within their specific time period. Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray was shaped by the aspects of the world around him. The themes of the text are are influenced by morality in the Victorian Era. Throughout the Victorian Era a deeper movement was also prominent in London called Aestheticism. Aestheticism is the worship of beauty and self-fulfillment.\n\nLove can exist as affection, infatuation, obsession, pleasure and in many other ways, as love is abstract. Hence, there is no one single interpretation of love. Love is a theme that has been embedded into language and literature over the centuries, yet due to the ever changing perception of love people continue to search for a universal definition of love. Poems are able to showcase the inner feelings and desires of a poet as well as their own unique views on love. Nevertheless, through poems “La Belle Dame sans Merci” by John Keats, “My Last Duchess” by Robert Browning, “Mother in a Refugee Camp” by Chinua Achebe, “The day is gone, and all its sweets are gone!”"
