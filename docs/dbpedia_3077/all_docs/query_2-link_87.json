She studied at the University of California, Berkeley, where the poet Witter Bynner was one of her teachers and she served as an associate editor of the literary magazine The Occident.[1][2] After graduating from the university in 1922, she returned to Guadalajara and became a secretary in the American Consulate there, continuing in that position through 1924. In 1923, she started the poetry magazine Palms, which she continued to publish until 1930. In 1925, she served as the head of the foreign book department at the Los Angeles Public Library. She moved to Aberdeen, Washington for a short time and then returned to Guadalajara. In 1932, she served as the dean and organizer of the first summer session at the University of Guadalajara. Beginning in 1935, she opened a gold mine at Ameca, Mexico, remaining there through 1937. She also began publishing fiction at about this time. Beginning in 1938, she taught creative writing in Los Angeles. During World War II, she was a riveter for Douglas Aviation and Fletcher Aviation. In 1957, she became a practitioner of Scientology, and remained one through 1966, serving briefly as the director of the Center for Dianetics and Scientology in Pasadena, California. She died in Los Angeles in 1982.[3]\n\nMarriages and children\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1927 she married John M. Weatherwax; they divorced about 1930.[4] She married Remington Stone on September 10, 1932.
