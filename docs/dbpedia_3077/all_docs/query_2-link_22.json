        "text": "By Terri Gorney\n\nGene Stratton-Porter met and became friends with fellow writers. She found a true\n\nkindred spirit in writer and poet Constance Lindsay Skinner. Constance was a British\n\nColumbia native. Constance, like Gene, loved the outdoors and nature and both were born\n\nin a rural setting. Constance was very much her own person, and loved to wear jewelry\n\nand to dress in bright colors.\n\nConstance, like Gene, wrote poetry, novels, and non-fiction books. Later she evolved into\n\na historian on pioneer life and wrote articles for newspapers. One of her novels “Good\n\nMorning, Rosamond” was adapted to a comedy that was performed at the Shubert\n\nTheatre in New York City. For a short time, she lived in California and in her later years\n\nin New York City where she became a U.S. citizen in 1935.\n\nAfter reading Constance’s poetry in “Poetry” magazine, Gene wrote to Constance. She\n\nwrote, “in my estimation all of this work is wonderful.” She was especially fond of the\n\npoem “The Song of the Search,” and stated “in my estimation the finest piece of work of\n\npoetical quality that I ever have seen from the pen of any woman living or dead and at the\n\npresent minute I recall nothing from the pen of any man which makes so strong appeal to\n\nme. This may be because from my life and work in the woods, I am peculiarly and\n\nparticularly receptive of such work as yours, and it may be, and I think it is, because it is\n\nthe finest thing of the mind I ever have read.” Gene asked for permission to use it in her\n\nnext book. She wanted to help Constance’s career and “put the poem before millions.”\n\nIn her book “Michael O’Halloran” Gene quote “The Song of the Search.” Her character,\n\nDouglas Bruce, loved the poem and recited it. Constance’s maternal side, the Lindsays,\n\nhave a long and famous Scottish pedigree which also may be why Gene gave the Douglas\n\nBruce, one of the main characters, a Scottish surname.\n\nConstance, like Gene, was an early environmentalist. She wrote many poems about\n\nnature and Native Americans. She wrote a poem called “The Song of Cradle-Making”\n\nabout a Native American woman weaving a baby cradle for her child that is coming. She\n\nwon a literary prize for it in 1913 and she dedicated the poem to Gene.\n\nGene commissioned Carl Arthur Faille, who painted under C.A. Faille, to bring\n\nConstance’s poem “Song of Cradle-Making” to “life.” In March 1920, he completed the\n\npainting. Carl said that Gene called him her “painter man.” He credits her with launching\n\nhis career. He specialized in large nature landscapes. The painting hung in her Rome City\n\nhome and later in one of her homes in California. It was sold after her death.\n\nWhen Gene’s secretary, Lorene Miller, married Frank Wallace at Wildflower Woods,\n\nConstance wrote a special “Wedding Song” for the occasion. Gene read the poem at the\n\nwedding. The Fort Wayne “Journal-Gazette” wrote that “no setting could have been more\n\nappropriate for this exquisite song beginning.”\n\nThe poem began: “The pine trees shadow blessings.\n\nThe cedars drop odours.\n\nWhere love is the depth of the waters\n\nAnd the light of the prairie’s smile.”\n\nConstance and Gene shared a friendship until Gene’s accidental death at the age of 61 in\n\nLos Angeles in 1924. Constance died after a brief illness in New York City in 1939 at the\n\nage of 61. We will never know what more these two creative and engaging women would\n\nhave accomplished had they been granted longer lives.\n\nWriter’s Note: A special thank you to historian, and Constance’s biographer, Jean\n\nBarman for your generousity and support of my research. Thank you to Dave Reichlinger\n\nfor editing suggestions.\n\nBy Terri Gorney\n\nOne hundred years ago, the Great War began in Europe. Gene Stratton-Porter was a supporter of the war effort when America entered WWI. She purchased a $5000 Liberty bond from the Allen County Chapter of the Liberty Loan Club. Dr. Miles Porter, her brother-in-law, was chairman of the first aid committee for the Red Cross Chapter in Fort Wayne.\n\nUnder Indiana native Ernest Bicknell, the National Red Cross developed three committees: a National Relief Board, an International Relief Board, and a War Relief Board. According to the “Fort Wayne Sentinel” Gene was on one of the national committees. In 1935, Ernest wrote down his experiences in a book called “Pioneering With The Red Cross.” Before the war, the Red Cross had 17,000 members by the end of the war, there were 20 million members.\n\nShe watched while the men in her life were affected by the war. Her son-in-law, G. Blaine Monroe served as a dentist. Her nephew Donald Wilson served in the army aviation. Nephew Dr. Miles Porter Jr was according to Gene “a fine surgeon, who is to have charge of a base hospital near Paris.” He spent eighteen months in service. Another nephew, Dr. Charles Porter Beall, served as a doctor in France as did Dr. Corwin Price, a Geneva friend who would buy the Limberlost cabin in 1920.\n\nJoyce Kilmer who wrote the “Tree” poem had corresponded with Gene. He was killed by a sniper in the war. In 1915, Kenyon Nicholson who became a playwright and screenwriter won Gene Stratton-Porter’s prize in literature while he was attending Wabash College in Crawfordsville. He served in France during the war. Gene’s own driver, William “Bill” Thompson, enlisted.\n\nDuring the war years, Gene and her friends were knitting wool socks so that they could be sent to the troops overseas. Gene encouraged the average citizen to do what they could for the war effort whether it meant knitting socks or donating time, money or books.\n\nThere were book drives across the country to send books to American service men in Europe. There was a 1918 report from Kingston, New York newspaper about a copy of “Freckles” that was donated to the book drive. In it was the following inscription, “My mother gave me this book to send to those who read it keep courage like Freckles did. I have two cousins and one uncle at the front some place. I am only 10 years and you don’t know how I wish I was old enough to help you catch the Kaiser.” James G---Port Angeles, Washington.\n\nIn 1915, Queen Mary of Great Britain wrote to Gene to ask her permission to use her writings in a book that would be a collection of different popular writers of the day. The book was known as the “Queen’s Book” and was sold to benefit wounded soldiers and sailors (England was already in the war by this time). Unfortunately for Gene, in the end, it was decided to use short stories by English writers only.\n\nGene penned a poem called “Peter’s Flowers” that was hauntingly beautiful. It was first published on pages 3 and 4 of the April 1919 “Red Cross” magazine. It was illustrated by Thomas Fogarty. The story is about the World War I tradition that the first flower to spring from the soil of a battlefield is the red poppy. The poppy is a living sign that they will not be forgotten. Gene could have been inspired by the poem “In Flanders Fields” by Lt. Col. John McCrae.\n\nAt the time Gene’s poem was published, John Sanburn Phillips was the editor of the “Red Cross” magazine. With the war over, Gene sent him a cheery Christmas greetings by writing, “I think “Peter” would want me to wish you all the joys of peace for the coming Christmas and all the blessings of prosperity for the New Year.”\n\nGene was sensitive to the soldiers and veterans. Her book, “The Keeper of the Bees” was about an injured veteran of the war named Jamie MacFarlane who left a military hospital without proper discharge. She had it completed at the time of her death in December 1924. In a letter to her publisher, Nelson Doubleday, she wrote about a “Harvester type” character that she was developing. It is possible that she was referring to this book.\n\nIn 1921, the “Brooklyn (NY) Daily Eagle” carried an article about President Harding appointing a woman as a delegate to a disarmament conference. In the article, Gene insisted that one woman is not enough to be appointed by President Harding as delegate to the disarmament conference. She wanted an equal number of men and women. She wrote, “After twenty years of experience in business with men, I have lost my awe of a man as an infallible business proposition. I have yet to find the time or the place in which a big-hearted, well-educated, commonsense woman could not be of the very greatest assistance in any business proposition of any nature that any man or body or body of men might attempt.”\n\nBy Terri Gorney\n\nGene Stratton-Porter made the Limberlost Swamp famous in her novels. Gene’s writings\n\ninfluenced several generations of people from all walks of life in a number of countries. Because Gene paints Limberlost as a magical place, some even today believe that it was a place born of her imagination. Not so, the Limberlost Swamp was once 13,000 acres in Southern Adams County and Northern Jay County. Today, 1800 acres have been returned to wetlands.\n\nClarise Cliff, of Tunstall, England was ten years old when “A Girl of the Limberlost” was first\n\npublished in 1909. She was inspired by Limberlost. Clarise would grow up and become one of\n\nthe most influential and renowned ceramic artists of the 20th century. A ceramic pattern created in 1932 by Clarise would be called Limberlost.\n\nClarise had a similar background as Gene. She came from a large family that lived in a small\n\nvillage of Tunstall. She would have a productive career and marry a successful man who was a\n\nnumber of years older than herself.\n\nThe modern Jazz Age and the Art Deco style influenced her designs, but her Bizarre patterns and shapes were all from her own creativity. She called it Bizarre as she said, “because it is intended to surprise people.” In 1930 she stated, “Women today want continual change, they will have a color and plenty of it. Color seems to radiate happiness and the spirit of modern life and movement, and I cannot put too much of it into my designs to please women.”\n\nThe 1930s was a busy and creative time for Clarise. She loved nature and taking long walks in\n\nthe woods. This was reflected in her art. Her landscape designs became some of her best known works of art and are very collectible today. In 1932 the pattern “Limberlost” was one of these landscape designs. It was a tree with tan foliage and white flowers, with a green plain\n\nbackground.\n\nClarice’s career as a ceramic designer was just beginning when Gene died in a car accident in\n\nCalifornia. Her mentor, Colley Shorter, was the owner of the pottery in which she worked. For\n\nover twenty years, she devoted herself to her career. In 1941, Colley and Clarise married. Today, there are Clarice Cliff Clubs in a number of countries and her pieces are considered works of art. A number of her pieces are in museums. In her lifetime, she created over 2000 patterns.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about Clarice Cliff, go to: www.ClariceCliff.com There are\n\nseveral good books about her life and her art. I enjoyed reading “Clarice Cliff: The Art of the\n\nBizarre” by Leonard Griffin."
