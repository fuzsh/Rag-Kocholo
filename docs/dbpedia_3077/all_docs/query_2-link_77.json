        "text": "Reverence For All Life, by Kamala Silva\n\nexcerpts\n\nReverence for life is a divine precept. PARAMAHANSA YOGANANDA prayed, “Divine Father, teach me to pass through smaller territories of love until I can enter into the endless territory of Divine Love in which I shall find all living things as my own.” … With wisdom’s insight Paramahansa Yogananda prayed, “Teach me to perceive all animate and inanimate objects as breathing and living by thy love.”….\n\nWritings help awaken or deepen this reverence for life….In our reading, we may share many experiences that have taken place between persons of understanding hearts and creatures of nature. When this has been under conditions of mutual trust and respect–not to measure or capture or change their ways–then we see the natural gentleness of creatures revealing their great capacity for love and trust. On our part is it essential to accord them freedom as well as love for both are innate needs in all beings.\n\nGANDHI extended his respect and regard for every being and he pledged the avoidance of harm to any living creature in thought or deed…When DR. ALBERT SWEITZER described his inner discovery of reverence for life and its spiritual meaning, he included all creatures. In his autobiography he said, “To the man who is truly eithical all life is sacred.”\n\nIt is written about SAINT FRANCIS OF ASSISI that … his soul overflowed with a feeling of brotherhood with all created things….He felt brotherly love for everything under the sun. ….The newfound brotherly love that Saint Francis felt is the cosmic, all-encompassing love of God, an infinite love for all. …It was said his sensitive heart was not less concerned about the welfare of a sparrow, the fate of a flower or a tree, than the affairs of his order. And if he was that concerned about the plants and flowers, he certainly could not pass by without helping an animal which he found in need.\n\nSee also~ Paramahansaji and the Desert Bush Story ~ Bro. Anandamoy\n\nWhen HENRY THOREAU lived in the solitude of the woods in his hut beside Walden Pond, he has related the birds would come without fear and sit on his shoulders, and the snakes would curl around his legs without doing him any harm. He lived there as happily as the first man in Paradise. He and St. Francis lived centuries apart, but shared the same harmony with all nature.\n\nTrue Stories of Man’s Kinship With the Animals\n\nAn intuitive presentation of relationships between man and animal may be found in the book, Kinship With All Life which considers the real inner self of all beings. The Boston Sunday Post described this “one of the most remarkable and unique animal books we have ever read. The author is J. Allen Boone. Letters to Strong Heart, by the same writer, is like discovering truth throught newly opened eyes. …Every chapter yields surprises and original viewpoints. It reverses attitudes presenting new ones that give understanding and meaning to man’s kinship with all life.\n\n…The books recommended here, and all of those mentioned at the end of this talk…are not chosen to turn thoughts to animal behavior which implies an observer rather than an interrelatedness. They are not presented for story interest only. They aquaint us with a climate wherein spiritual values have evolved. Each book listed has a quality of love within it, love that was so deeply moving and genuine in real life that it is imparted to the reader.\n\nWhen we read about That Quail Robert, the story that is mentioned later on in this chapter when books are listed, we feel very close to that tiny-sized form and to the consciousness that was in it that showed so much love, loyalty, responsiveness, intelligence and friendliness. There are inspiring moments from certain happenings that evoke holy thoughts, and many other revealing occurrences which we share in this interesting story of a quail. hat can this small life mean to us? If our love is kindled for Robert so that we sense the Divine Life within this small creature, then we begin to find it equally in every quail, in all fowl, and we begin to know that pain or injury to any one of them concerns us. We have related from Robert to the many, enlarging the scope of our love.\n\nWhen we really know and understand the little skunk and the porcupine from the Northernaire books listed, which are mentioned later, they become dear to us. We feel friendly toward them, toward all of their kind. This is equally true of the wolf, fox, bear and the many others in these writings when we know them as individuals. As each one becomes dear to us, we grow aware of the same life in all.\n\nParamahansa Yogananda prayed, “Father, bless us that we may obey thy laws of life and respect with kindness the freedom of all thy free born children, not only men but also the mammals, birds and beasts.”\n\nHave we respected the freedom of birds and all animals and shown kindness by giving them environmental rights? All of the species that God created, found good and told to multiply need man’s loving concern and protection. When our lives touch upon any living creature–animals, fish, insect, reptile or bird–may we be gentle, may we ensure kindness to these sentient beings by compassionate laws that reveal our empathy. A true understanding may begin with our courtesy extended toward each.\n\nSt. Francis said in a talk to the brothers of his order, “Courtesy is one of the properties of God.” Courtesy implies spiritually a perception and recognition that God is within another, in everyone. It is a precept of divine behavior. In a prayer our Guru spoke of the endless territory of divine love in which I shall find all living things as my own. When we have kinship with all life we share the divine love of saints. Cosmic consciousness encompasses the realization that the individual Self is a part of all Selfs in many forms. And equally a part of our greater Self. We have become loosed from the finite to merge with the infinite. In true reverence for life, we find our souls aflame with cosmic love where we are one with the creator and his creation.\n\nREAD the Story of Paramahansaji’s little deer at Ranchi, Autobiography of a Yogi, CHAPTER 27 ‘Founding a Yoga School in Ranchi’\n\nBOOKS THAT AWAKEN CONCEPTION OF THE ONENESS OF ALL LIFE\n\nThis is a listing of some of the books, the special books that give a wakening conception of the oneness within all life, and especially the sense of love which the devotee will feel and which can help to expand from finite love into the infinIte kind of love of God, the love which all of the saints felt.\n\nKinship With All Life by J. Allen Boone which considers the real inner self of all beings. The Boston Sunday Post described this “one of the most remarkable and unique animal books we have ever read.\n\nForest Orphans by August Derleth is a beautiful story about a man called the St. Francis of Northernaire and about his woodland friends.\n\nNorthernaire’s Ginger and Her Woodland Orphans by Carl Marty and Mother is a Saint Bernard, Edith L. Johnson are also books about the forest foundlings at Northernaire. Wilderness animals live peacefully together while free to roam the surrounding woods and lakes. The dogs who befriended them all have a large role in these remarkable true happenings. The guests of a large resort hotel there delight in seeing the different species of wild creatures play together in fellowship. They are appealing stories with real drama.\n\nThe Wild Heart by Emma Lindsay Squier and also On Autumn Trails by Emma Lindsay Squier are two other books. And this quotation is from the first one: “Suddenly I knew the tawny lioness before me was a wild thing, even as were the other wild things I had loved–not a savage beast. Hers was not a savage heart, only a wild heart, and I found that love could speak to it.” These are about the unusual encounters of the author with wild creatures which include a bear, seagull and bengal tiger.\n\nThat Quail Robert, Margaret A Stanger is about a diminuitive quail hatched under a lamp that wins fame in an eventful life. It is a tender and unusual story.\n\nLittle Tyke by Georges H. Westbeau speaks of lambs, baby chicks and human celebrities, all who sought the company of this vegetarian lioness\n\nSandy: [The True Story of a Rare Sandhill Crane Who Joined Our Family],\n\nby Dayton O., Hyde tells by the author of reaching across the barriers of bird language to communicate with sandhill cranes who share his life, told with insight and humor\n\nThe Bears & I by Robert F. Leslie speak of an old bear aunt who turns over the responsibility for rearing three small cubs to the author, now a school teacher. He wrote that in the instruction of them such human institutions as reward and punishment, training routines, dog and master status and blind obedience eemed in conflict with mutual respect.\n\nThe Bears and I VIDEO\n\nThe Seal’s Summer THE SEAL SUMMER THE ENCHANTING TRUE STORY OF A WILD SEAL AND HIS HUMAN FRIENDS by Nina Warner Hooke tells of a seal who comes to shore for human companionship and a community shares his friendship.\n\nRacoons Are The Brightest People by Sterling North–This delightful books tells about human sharing and association with these gentle creatures who live in freedom but come visiting.\n\nNever Cry Wolf, by Farley Mowett present the wolves courtesy to man and respect for his rights, and the pure joy of their own family life. You live with this wolf family through the eyes, words and understanding of the writer who knew them.\n\nBorn Free by Joy Adamson, well known for television presentations and the moving picture as well as the book is the exchange of love and understanding with a lioness, a remarkable and endearing story. …\n\nAdditional titles informative and enjoyable–\n\nThe Year of the Whale, by Victor B. Scheffer, about the sperm whale\n\nSila the Mink by Ewin Clarkson\n\nVala, the Story of a Sea Lion, by Dean Jennings\n\nThen there are book of imagination, with liberal seasoning of truth.\n\nThe Cat Who Went to Heaven, by Elizabeth Coatsworth. In this Newberry Award book, a Japanese artist contemplates the inner qualities of many animals to know each one before placing it on a special canvas for a temple. A banyan dear, elephant, monkey, tigress, horse, snail, dog, swan and many others were included, because all of them were related to stories about Buddhists. Only the cat is absent, and this creates the drama in this deeply spiritual story.\n\nThe Fur Person, by Mary Sarton — gives us an aquaintance with this cat that enables us to better understand all fur persons from their own view of life.\n\nHorton Hears a Who by Dr. Seuss\n\nis a book for children but worthy of adult regard about a large sensitive being that shows respect and consideration for some very minute lives, reminding us of the words of Emerson: “There is no great and no small, to the God that maketh all.”\n\nAs we have said, the benefits in reading these books are to help expand our consciousness to know true reverence for life and feel our interelatedness with all life that is sacred.\n\nThe devotee who is seeking Cosmic Consciousness would hear the words of Paramahansaji who asked that the territory of his love be expanded to the endless territory of divine love. And in order for us to do this, we have to feel the same life pervading every manifestation in all of God’s creation in which “there is no great and no small, for the one Creator maketh all.”\n\nAnd this is the brotherhood of man, the brotherhood of all created things that St. Francis felt when his perfect joy and love were expressed that have touched and stirred mankind through the centuries. …And we find this same quality in Albert Sweitzer. We find the same expression in Paramahansa Yogananda. We find this same expression wherever we turn to people who have realized the meaning of a reverence for life.\n\nPARAMAHANSAJI with SQUIRREL\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nSee also~ KAMALA SILVA ~ Beloved Early Householder Disciple of Yogananda\n\nBACK TO"
