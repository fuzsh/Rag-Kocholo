        "text": "Hello. My name is Steve and Iâ€™m a music junkie. Itâ€™s been zero minutes since my last fix.\n\nTruth be told Iâ€™ve been kinda obsessed with music since I was about 9 years old. Iâ€™ve never been interested in sports so, as kids, my friends and I would spend our spare time hanging out listening to albums and literally counting the days til the next concert. Back then our music tastes were limited. Lots of 80s metal and hip-hop. Weâ€™d listen to albums by AC/DC, Motley Crue, Beastie Boys and Guns N Roses repeatedly, studying the lyrics and plastering our bedroom walls with posters. Iâ€™d save my dinner money from school so that I could buy the new Janeâ€™s Addiction album on the day of release, cycling from school into town and then home to stick it on the turntable. Every album was an event and I would indulge myself every time.\n\nBut thatâ€™s not how it works in 2018.\n\nNow we can check out almost every album the instant itâ€™s released. Spotify, Tidal, Apple Music and others make it so easy to listen to whatever we like, and it only costs a small subscription fee. I listen to so much music and care about good quality sound, that Iâ€™m subscribed to Spotify, Tidal and Apple Music, although Apple is mostly for Beats 1 radio shows. I prefer Tidal for its sound quality but Spotify has a better interface and has some albums that arenâ€™t on Tidal. Spotify is also better for sharing playlists with other music fans.\n\nBut Iâ€™ve recently realised that all this access to music has had one definite downside to my enjoyment of listening to the bands and artists I love. Whereas back in the 80s Iâ€™d listen to Violator by Depeche Mode til I pretty much wore it out, now Iâ€™ll get excited about the new Beck album, listen to it a couple of times before spending hours listening to new music just in case I discover a band Iâ€™ve missed. Iâ€™m not spending time getting to really know albums inside out like I used to. Iâ€™m listening to so much good music, but I think I need to make an effort to spend most of my time with GREAT music. I actually donâ€™t think thereâ€™s enough time to listen to music thatâ€™s just good. And I have a job that allows me to listen to tunes all day long unless Iâ€™m out shooting. Sam Hurd even listens to music on headphones when heâ€™s shooting a wedding reception. Iâ€™ve considered doing the same. Especially when Iâ€™m at a wedding where the DJ plays Despacito!\n\nOver the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve been thinking about what my favourite albums of 2017 have been. I always take this list far too seriously, to be honest, and I have listened to almost every album that made any Best Of 2017 list just in case I missed something amazing. Like the Jordan Rekai album for example. I donâ€™t always agree with the albums in those lists of course. I struggled to get into the LCD Soundsystem album despite it topping so many lists, and I genuinely can not listen to Father John Misty!\n\nOne other thing that has changed dramatically over the years is that my taste in music has expanded more and more. There are almost no genres of music where I canâ€™t find anything I love. Iâ€™ve yet to hear any ska music I like but feel free to offer suggestions. I love a lot of alternative, metal, acoustic, electronic, indie, hip hopâ€¦. the list goes on. And I now have a system that makes the albums Iâ€™m listening to sound even better. It all just fuels my addiction.\n\nSo I think this year Iâ€™m gonna stop chasing new music quite so much and spend time with the albums I truly love. Just like the old daysâ€¦ Some of those albums will be played on vinyl. Most will be streamed via Tidal. But Iâ€™ll be spending more time with them. I have no doubt itâ€™ll be time well spent.\n\nSo, if youâ€™re interested, and I really hope you are, here are my favourite albums of 2017. In rough order. But that changes weekly. Iâ€™ve kept the heavier stuff separate cos so many people would find it unlistenable. I know my tastes can be a bit weird. I like it that way ðŸ™‚ My love for atmospheric black metal has really developed recently with bands like Icelandâ€™s AuÃ°n making stunning soundscapes that evoke the landscapes the band evolved from. But then Iâ€™ve loved the Rose Cousins album, which is pretty much as far from metal as you can get. It all depends on what Iâ€™m in the mood for. And if Evelyneâ€™s in the house with me!\n\nPlease take time to check out any artists in these lists youâ€™re not familiar with. You may stumble across your next favourite albumâ€¦ And if you have Spotify, Iâ€™ve compiled two playlists of my favourite music of the year. And yes, that is a Harry Styles song you see!\n\nFavourite Albums of 2017 (excluding the really heavy stuff)\n\n1. The War On Drugs â€“ A Deeper Understanding\n\n2.
