We cannot be held responsible for these delays.\n\nIf your order hasn't arrived within 50 days (90 days for preorders/international orders) of the original purchase date, contact our support team for a replacement or full refund on your purchase. (This policy excludes errors made by customers when providing shipping details on their order(s) or missed parcel deliveries).\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nYou agree to our refund/exchange/cancellation policy by placing an order on our website. Don't hesitate to contact our customer service team for assistance if you have any questions or concerns.\n\n30-DAY MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE\n\nWe have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after receiving your item to request a return. If more than 30 days have passed since the items were delivered, we, unfortunately, cannot accept returns or issue refunds.\n\nTo be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, unwashed, with tags if applicable, and in its original packaging. You'll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.\n\nTo start a return, you can contact us at support@authenticbandmerch.com\n\nIf your return is accepted, we’ll send you instructions on how and where to send your package. Items sent back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted. Please note that if your country of residence is not United States, shipping your goods may take longer than expected.\n\nYou can always contact us for any return questions at support@authenticbandmerch.com\n\nDAMAGES AND ISSUES\n\nPlease inspect your order upon receipt and contact us immediately if the item is defective, damaged, or if you receive the wrong item, so that we may evaluate the issue and make it right.\n\nWe will send you a no-cost replacement if you receive a damaged or defective item. Picture documentation is required. Standard sublimated marks are exempt. Faulty items will be exchanged for good items of equal value only.\n\nRETURNS OR EXCHANGES\n\nThe fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new item.\n\nIf you would like to return an item for a refund, you are responsible for paying for the shipping to get the item to us.\n\nIf you request an exchange, you are responsible for paying the shipping cost to get the item to you.\n\nAll clothing items must be in their original unworn and unwashed condition with all tags attached (if applicable) and be free of any stains or smells to qualify for an exchange/refund.\n\nOnce we receive the item(s), we will issue a refund to you for the cost of the item minus a restock fee and/or our shipping costs (our shipping costs are not refundable) of $6.97/item.\n\nRefunds are issued to the original form of payment within 7 to 14 business days of receiving your return. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.

They are paid in full upfront and are usually items that will be arriving in the future, so by preordering, you are securing a piece before they sell out. They are made to order.\n\nDiscounted items are final and cannot be returned or exchanged.\n\nWRONG ADDRESS\n\nIt is the responsibility of the buyer to make sure that the shipping address is correct. We are not responsible for orders delivered to the wrong address at the customer's fault.\n\nWe do our best to speed up processing and shipping time, so there is always a small window to correct an incorrect shipping address.\n\nPlease get in touch with us immediately if you have provided the wrong shipping address.\n\nIn case an order is returned to us due to an incorrect address (as indicated by the carrier's website), please note that a restocking fee of 15% and a shipping cost of $6.97 per item will apply.\n\nLOST OR STOLEN PACKAGE\n\nWe are not responsible for lost or stolen packages.\n\nIf your tracking information states that your package was delivered to your address and you have not received it please report it to your respective shipping carrier.\n\nIf you have further questions about doing this, please get in touch with our customer support team.\n\nIf your order hasn't arrived within 50 days of the original purchase date (or 120 days in case of pre-orders/international orders), contact our support team for a replacement or full refund on your purchase. (This policy excludes errors made by customers when providing shipping details on their order(s) or missed parcel deliveries).\n\nCANCELLATION POLICY\n\nWe understand that sometimes customers may need to cancel their orders. Therefore, we have created this cancellation policy to help make the process as easy and fair as possible.\n\nEligibility: Orders can be canceled up to 3 hours after the order was placed.\n\nProcedures: Please get in touch with our customer service team at support@authenticbandmerch.com to initiate a cancellation. In your request, please provide your order number, your first and last name.\n\nTimeframe: Refunds will be processed within 7-14 business days of receiving your cancellation request.\n\nIf you prefer, we can also offer you a store credit or the option to exchange your product for something else.\n\nORDER CANCELLATION/ADJUSTMENT POLICY\n\nOnce an order is placed, we incur irreversible fees and cannot do so free of charge. All orders will incur a 15% cancellation/adjustment fee. Preorders (Made-to-order) will incur a 30% cancellation/adjustment fee. We may not be able to cancel/edit orders but contact us if you want to change anything.\n\nOrders refused or returned to us due to a wrong/incomplete address (as per carrier status) will incur a 15% fee (or 30% for made-to-order/preorder items) plus the shipping charge. For example, if an item costs $35 and it’s returned to us due to a wrong address, the customer will receive $35 - (15% of $35) - $6.97 = $22.78.\n\nWe reserve the rights to cancel and issue a refund for any order without prior notice if necessary.\n\nWhat our customers are saying about Authentic Band Merch:\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nI was very skeptical when I first came across Authentic Band Merch on social media as I typically only buy from trusted vendors and sites. I decided to take a shot and ordered a few shirts. I was astounded by how quickly they shipped and the high quality of every item ordered. And the customer service is amazing. Ask a question and you get a reply almost immediately. Since my initial order, I have since ordered multiple shirts and I’m completely satisfied with each and everyone. Getting ready to place another order soon. Rock On Authentic Band Merch!!\n\nTim\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nIt's so hard to find 2 sided tour shirts that look good. These are great quality, look sharp and fit me perfectly. No oversize tent shirts for dad bods here. If you look good and want to flaunt it, these are perfect for a nice V-taper body. I have a new path to leave corporate and pursue my love of music with DJing EDM and singing in the style of Leonard Cohen, Strumbellas, Mumford and Sons, Elvis, Bob Dylan. The cowboy rocker look works like fire for me.\n\nCowboy hat, stylish belt with and outlandish buckle, silver and black rings on nearly every finger, overdoing it with leather bracelets and necklaces, some sick boots and then bring it all together with a band tour shirt......and owning the ridiculousness every step of the way in the footsteps of my favorite rock stars.\n\nI've had such a hard time finding the shirt, and have ordered around 9 from Authentic Band Merch and they look amazing and will be coming back for more often. Marianne, in customer service, was friendly, fast and responsive as well. I don't usually vouch for products, but these are some serious stud duds and can't recommend these shirts enough.\n\nThanks so much\n\nRay R.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nI have ordered a couple of shirts from Authentic Band Merchandise and I love love love everything. My shirts have came in on time, look fantastic and the best part is that they feel really cozy. This is my favorite store and I will continue to shop on this website. 10/10 stars would highly recommend.\n\nZachary J.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nI wanted to let you know I recently received my order from you and was pleasantly pleased with the quality and results. I was worried about ordering from your company as I was unfortunately the victim of fraud from another T-shirt company. I will only order from you in the future as the merchandise was what I was expecting!\n\nRob L.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nI’d like to thank y’all for a trip back in time. My Pink Floyd Animals Tour shirt was simply awesome. In 1977 money was tight & the 3 hour drive, several beers consumed, left little money for any Memobilia. Thanks.\n\nGreg\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nI’ve told everyone these are the best shirts!!\n\nJohnny B\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nI’m very happy with the quality of both shirts I received. ZZ Top and Led Zep!\n\nDarin L.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nWe got our CBGB’s shirts for the holiday and love them! They’re soft and fit perfectly!\n\nHarriet W.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nHey, so I’m impressed with the quality of the shirts i bought from you guys!\n\nNot usually impressed with stuff I’ve bought off facebook ads, but your stuff is the real deal. Thanks!\n\nSal D.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nThank you love your merchandise\n\nI have received and like them very much great quality\n\nKevin M.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nThank you. I love your customer service and speed. Hard to find.\n\nMatthew R.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nJust got one of my shirts today and love it, I'll be ordering more in the future.\n\nJeff L\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nAmazing customer service\n\nJen T.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nI received my order and I do really like the quality\n\nJosh B.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nOMG I love my shirts I will absolutely be ordering again soon for myself and gifts, I shared your site with my brother he loves it\n\nTheresa S.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nI received my t-shirts today and I absolutely love them. Thank you so much!!\n\nChris D.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n\"Thank you! Love the vibes your clothing carries 🧡 \"Jennifer S.\n\nThis is our feedback from our clients directly from Facebook\n\nFacebook uses a variety of information, including surveys from people who purchase from Facebook, Instagram, and Facebook Audience Network ads to help ensure the ads accurately represent the product and service provided.\n\nFacebook uses this information to give each business a score from 0 to 5.\n\nThese scores are updated on a continual basis, based on the most recent feedback.\n\nAuthentic Band Merch vs. \"other stores\"\n\nAt our officially licensed t-shirts store, we are proud to offer the most extensive collection of bands and musical artists.\n\nOur t-shirts are printed in the US or UK and are fully licensed, giving you the peace of mind that you are buying an authentic and high-quality product.\n\nAt our officially licensed t-shirts store, we take great pride in the quality of our products. All our t-shirts are printed with the highest quality materials. In addition, they are thoroughly inspected before being shipped to ensure that they meet our strict quality standards.\n\nIn comparison, our competitors' products may live up to different standards. For example, some of their t-shirts may be printed with lower-quality materials, resulting in designs that fade or crack after a few washes. Additionally, their inspection processes may be less rigorous, meaning there is a higher chance of receiving a faulty product.\n\nAt our store, we believe that quality should never be compromised, which is why we always put the customer first. We stand behind our products and are confident that you will be delighted with your purchase.\n\nSo why settle for less when you can have the best? Choose us for a truly premium t-shirt experience.\n\nOne of the most significant differences between our competitors and us is our pricing.\n\nWhile \"other stores\" may offer higher discounts, their prices are also higher, meaning you end up paying more.

While \"other stores\" only offer free shipping over a certain amount, we offer free shipping on all orders, no matter the amount.\n\nIf you are looking for a wide selection of officially licensed t-shirts at a great price, with the convenience of free shipping, then look no further than our store. We are confident that you will find what you're looking for at a better value than our competitors.\n\nAt authenticbandmerch.com officially licensed t-shirts store, we are committed to offering the highest quality products to our customers.\n\nThis is why we print our merchandise in the US or UK and never import from China. As a result, our customers can feel confident that they are buying a product that has been responsibly made and meets our rigorous standards of quality.\n\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said for our competitors. Some may bring their products from China, resulting in lower quality products and longer customer wait times. Sometimes, the products they sell may even be manufactured under unethical working conditions.\n\nWe believe that our customers deserve better. That's why we are committed to sourcing our products from the US or UK, where we can ensure that they are made to the highest standards and that our customers are receiving a product that they can trust.\n\nSo why settle for less when you can have the best? So choose us for a truly premium t-shirt experience.\n\nAt our officially licensed t-shirts store, we are always looking for ways to enhance the customer experience.\n\nThat's why we add new designs and bands to our portfolio each week, ensuring that our customers have access to the latest and greatest in musical apparel.\n\nWith a wide range of bands and designs to choose from, there's something for everyone, regardless of your musical taste.\n\nIn addition to our extensive selection, we offer variations you won't find anywhere else.\n\nSo we've got you covered whether you're looking for a unique design, a specific band, or something different from what you see in other stores.\n\nWe are also proud to offer plus and tall sizes so that all our customers can find a t-shirt that fits them comfortably.
