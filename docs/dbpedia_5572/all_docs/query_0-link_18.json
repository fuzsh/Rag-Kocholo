He has a one-year old YouTube channel with 34K subscribers and growing and was one of the principle creators of the Red Man Group.\nRollo has been married to his wife for 23 years and has a 21-year-old daughter in college. He lives in Reno, Nevada with anywhere between 2 to 5 greyhounds depending on how many he’s fostering at the time\nRollo’s website is www.therationalmale.com\nIN THIS EPISODE:\n\n Feminism has conditioned males to become more feminine, more beta\n We live in a global, sexual marketplace which has affected how men and women mate\n For women, when looking for a long-term mate, being “alpha” is more about owning your masculinity than about how much money you have, your looks, social status, etc.\n The Soulmate Myth: There’s no such thing as the One. The soul mate mentality is not a good way to plan your life\n Hypergamy is how women select their mates (mating strategy)\n Women’s and men’s sexual market value timeline is not the same (a woman’s SVM tops out around 23. Around 27-30, the realization sinks in that they must trade in their party years and find a mate)\n  Women tend to find men that are 3-5 years older than they are; men tend to find women between the ages of 22-23 are most attractive\n  We’re still clinging to equality, or the “clean slate” theory that men and women are the same\n  Men and women are better together than they are apart\n  It is impossible for a woman to be as sexual as a man, based on biological factors.\n  Men’s sexual strategy is unlimited access to unlimited sexuality.\n  Women have reproductive costs that men don’t have\n\nSign up for relationship coaching with Suzanne:  https://www.suzannevenker.com/relationship-coaching/\nSubscribe to The Suzanne Venker Show:  https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-suzanne-venker-show/id1471433977\nFollow Suzanne on Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/SuzanneVenker\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SuzanneVenkerAuthor/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/suzannevenkerauthor/\nBuy Women Who Win at Love or The Alpha Female's Guide to Men & Marriage NOW:   https://www.amazon.com/Suzanne-Venker/e/B001K7VY7K%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share",

Are you a married mother who wants to quit her job and stay home with the littles, but your family and friends—even your own husband!—want you to continue to work full-time?\n\nIf so, you will NOT want to miss this episode! Suzanne has written a book just for you.\n\nIt’s called How to Build a Better Life: A New Roadmap for Women Who Want to Prioritize Love and Family, and you’ll hear all about it in this episode.\n\nhttps://www.suzannevenker.com/books/how-to-build-a-better-life/\n\nDating in America has become an absolute mess. Men and women have no compass for how to proceed and no idea what the roles and the rules are anymore.\n\nIn this episode, Suzanne lists 7 dating rules for marriage-minded women since they have the power to get to what they ultimately want: marriage.\n\nDon’t marry the first person you fall in love with. The more relationship experience you have before getting married, the better. That way you'll really “know” yourself when you say, ‘I do.’\n\nFor decades this has been the relationship narrative passed on to the young and unattached. But my experience as a relationship coach suggests the opposite is true.\n\nSo does the data.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ6WXvBvwWE\n\nhttps://themattwalshblog.wordpress.com/2013/09/05/heres-some-honest-dating-advice/comment-page-1/\n\nOverachieving is defined as the unrelenting drive for high performance, and women are drowning in this phenomenon. Suzanne reads from an article in the Wall Street Journal that explains how overachieving is a form of self-protection that is harmful to our physical and mental health and outlines three strategies to help women stop overachieving.\n\nLINK: https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/for-happiness-in-the-new-year-stop-overdoing-everything-6b9a4b99 MARRIAGE OR RELATIONSHIP TROUBLES?

They are completely helpless and utterly dependent on their mothers—and not just to feed them and change their diapers. So many people think this is all that goes on during this stage, and they could not be more wrong.\n\nSuzanne takes listeners on a journey to see what's really going on behind the scenes when Mom is home with her baby.\n\nMore and more women are choosing to have children and remain single. When these women are asked why, most say it’s not that they don’t want to get married but that there are no longer any marriageable men from which to choose.\n\nThe so-called \"rise\" of women and lack of marriageable (read: gainfully employed) men is the #1 reason marriage in America has tanked.\n\nIn this week's episode, Suzanne discusses 4 things Americans MUST begin to do if we ever expect to turn this mess around.\n\nLinks:\n\nhttps://www.suzannevenker.com/the-war-on-men-ebook/\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2023/10/22/1207322878/single-parent-married-good-for-children-inequality\n\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/media/economist-makes-data-driven-case-stable-two-parent-households-clear-kids-benefit.amp\n\nIs it possible to combine raising a family with the pursuit of a career? Does it have to be all or nothing? Suzanne reads an email from a woman who wants to know how to stay home with her baby but also be able to work part time and utilize her creative energy professionally.\n\nSuzanne reads a letter from a woman whose parents don't support her staying home with her babies and offers tips on how to live on less for those who are trying to save more money or move from two incomes to one.\n\nSuzanne talks with Liz Durham of Being Different about the position employers are in when it comes to investing in young women who have not had children yet, and the likelihood that they will leave once that happens.\n\n\"My soon-to-be-husband is a software engineer and works from home. I can forsee potential challenges. What are your thoughts on both spouses working from home together?\"\n\n\"I have a one-year-old and a two-year-old, and they are going to daycare two days a week from 7 to 4. Home with mom or dad the rest of the days. We have no family or friends to help. Can this arrangement flourish for healthy marriage and children?\"\n\n\"Help! I want to stay home with her children, but my husband doesn't agree.\"\n\n\"What are your thoughts about the cry it out method?\"\n\n\"Is it possible for some men to have a lower sex drive than women? My husband rarely wants sex.\"\n\nIf you're struggling with modern motherhood, you do not want to miss this episode. I brought back Liz Durham (host of the podcast Being Different), who has transitioned from being a full-time working mom to a full-time SAHM. She and I offer a countercultural guide for younger women who've been raised at a time in which motherhood has been sidelined or even rejected altogether.\n\nWe discuss (among other things):\n\nHow dumping the 50-50 mindset will make the experience lighter.\n\nHow it takes a family, not a \"village,\" to raise healthy kids.\n\nThat motherhood isn't about you.\n\nThe significance of the first three years\n\nHow to embrace the discomfort and the unknown\n\nHow to deal with isolation\n\nWhy daycare can't provide discipline\n\nMoney remains the #1 cause of marital conflict and divorce. But money conflict is never about money itself. It’s about power and control vs. trust, and often it’s about mismatched values.\n\nIn this episode, Suzanne discusses three major money mistakes modern couples make and the conversations married couples need to have about money if they want a less roommate-like and more intimate relationship with their spouse.\n\nSuzanne brings relationship coach Andre Paradis back on the show to help couples better understand sexual dynamics as they are designed to be, versus the role reversal couples are contending with today. Men are made to be providers and protectors and are not cut out for emotional warfare with women. Thus, when women behave in a way that feels combative, men often back down. But this is the wrong response.\n\nSuzanne brings relationship coach Andre Paradis back on the show to help couples better understand sexual dynamics as they are designed to be, versus the role reversal couples are contending with today.

But this is the wrong response.\n\nAccording to a new report by Pew Research, American women are increasingly becoming the breadwinners in their marriages. But they're also taking on the lion's share of household chores and childcare.\n\nAre their husbands just lazy, or is there more going on than what the media would have us believe?\n\nPew study: https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/04/13/in-a-growing-share-of-u-s-marriages-husbands-and-wives-earn-about-the-same/"
