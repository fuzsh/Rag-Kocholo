        "text": "Caroline – Caroline\n\n(Rough Trade)\n\nWe were pretty transfixed by the graceful alt folk stylings of Caroline’s debut single ‘Dark Blue’ back in 2020. Lo-fi but with a warm sense of grandeur, they definitely had us at hello here at BCFB. Formed in late 2017, the London based outfit spent the best part of a year behind closed doors, developing in sound and members, forming as a trio but emerging from the practice room as an eight piece. With live shows now played, a deal with Rough Trade inked and a few more singles out, it’s finally time for Caroline’s debut album.\n\nBorn out of hours of improvised sessions, this is an album that lives in the moment. Most of the shorter, almost interlude-like tracks are experimental pieces of close mic’d acoustic guitar that at times seem like they come out of nowhere. I think that’s what makes this album such an interesting piece – it’s not about a polished performance or even a polished recording, it’s about being present in the here and now. That’s where the improv element of Caroline really starts to shine through, as you can hear them feeling their way through certain sections, particularly on the meandering outro to ’Skydiving Onto The Library Roof’.\n\nMusically, they combine avant-garde folk, mid-western emo and even bits of jazz and post-rock to deliver a set that really needs to be absorbed with full engagement. It would be all too easy to link this to Black Country, New Road and though I can see parallels in this sprawling sound, there is something about Caroline and this record that goes deeper, almost on a spiritual level.\n\nThere is so much poise and patience in these arrangements, they tend to stay in one place before darting off in another direction and diving deep into a motif or a groove. I find that a lot of the tracks end with these hypnotic passages that usually come from big, beautiful builds, like in the gorgeous emo folk melodies of ‘Good Morning (Red)’ or the Godspeed-goes-free-jazz chaos of closer ’Natural Death’.\n\nIt’s amazing how Caroline manage to be totally heart-warming and unsettling at the same time. If you like things on the more experimental side, you’ll love digging into this; mysterious, unnerving, intoxicating and beautiful, Caroline lure us in on a fascinating debut.\n\nHolodrum – Holodrum\n\n(Gringo Records)\n\nWe’ve only very recently banged on about the greatness of the Leeds scene, with both Thank and Yard Act already releasing bold, brash and beautiful debuts in 2022. And now we have a third, which even includes a member of the aforementioned Yard Act! To be fair, the collective CV of Holodrum reads extremely well, with members lending various hands to the likes of Drahla, Virginia Wing, Cowtown and Hookworms.\n\nI was informed by our faithful Ed that we featured the band right at the start when they released their debut single at the back end of 2019 (he’s right ya know – Ed). Needless to say, it’s been a wee while since we’ve heard much else, but excitingly Holodrum have an album ready to show us!\n\nThis self titled debut is a sparkling set of vintage disco, with 80’s electro pulses, shimmering pop melodies and even hints of post-punk sharpness. Half of these tracks are shorter bursts of danceable, electro pop, brimming with bubblegum hooks and undeniably infectious grooves. Recent single ‘Free Advice’ is a glittery piece of synth laden funk pop that shifts into dizzying levels of transcendency more than once, while ’No Dither’ locks into the groove with some fully hip shaking bass work and an excellent call and response breakout that sees guitarist Sam taking on the role of Yorkshire’s answer to James Murphy.\n\nThe other half of the songs build all the previous traits mentioned but sink deeper into a vibe, moving well over the 5 minute mark; my favourite probably being the disco kraut bewilderment of closer ‘Clean’. It seems to cater for every kind of dance fan – it can go in and keep the beat moving for the seasoned raver, but also has some briefer bursts of melody fuelled energy for those that want a quick fire dance pop hit.\n\nIt’s very clear to see that Holodrum is made up of musicians that come from all sides of the alternative scene. You can hear glimpses of so many different genres in here. Aside from the obvious, you can hear the punk, you can even hear the prog, but ultimately you can feel these sumptuous pop grooves that all members have injected into their previous projects in some shape or form. It manages to be both immediate and expansive and is pretty much impossible not to move to. All in all, an effortlessly cool and delightfully groovy debut from a supremely talented collective. Was there ever any doubt!\n\nLike what you see? Why not stick around and check out the other articles and interviews!\n\nDon’t forget to follow Birthday Cake For Breakfast on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter!\n\nIt’s something we’ve talked a lot about on this site recently, but the UK metal scene is really thriving at the moment. Not only are more established bands pushing themselves further than ever before and handing in their best work, but there’s also a plethora of young new bands that feel so fresh and exciting within the genre. Tonight is a celebration of both. Rolo Tomassi headline as part of a UK tour in support of their freshly released sixth album ‘Where Myth Becomes Memory’, with support from Pupil Slicer and Heriot.\n\nFirst up are Heriot, who seem to be spreading like wildfire with a smattering of singles released over the last year, a tour support recently completed with the mighty Svalbard and a debut EP out next month. It’s fair to say that it’s all happening for the young Midlands quartet and with good reason. They combine absolutely crushing metal core riffs with an industrial influenced intensity. There’s also ethereal vocal passages, bludgeoning breakdowns, thrash workouts and some pretty serious guitar soloing.\n\nIt’s a full on live show with the band playing as intensely as they sound; guitarist Debbie often sounds as if she’s descending into hell. An incredibly thrilling live set with plenty of killer riffs and neat twists, this lot already seem like a well oiled machine. Definitely a band you wanna keep an eye on.\n\nNext up are Pupil Slicer. I got into this band due to absolutely loving their name, but ended up really getting into their blistering debut album ’Mirrors’ released last year. Blending metal-core meatiness with math, grind and hardcore, I can confirm that they are just as frantic live as they are on record. Possibly even more so, which makes for a super fun live show, with guitarist and vocalist Katie often jumping into the front row, guitar around her neck, soloing away!\n\nThere is something very old school about Pupil Slicer which I love – in a world where metal bands take themselves very seriously, it’s nice to see some of that mid-noughties party band spirit come out in their set. Making techy sound party, Pupil Slicer warm us up for Rolo Tomassi perfectly.\n\nThe crowd interaction has been belting throughout the gig, pits kicking off immediately for Heriot and a lot of excitable moshing for Pupil Slicer. So, now on to to our headliner, Rolo Tomassi. Tonight we get a fairly even mix of tracks from the last two full lengths, opening with the absolutely colossal riff of recent single ’Cloaked’. It sounds fucking gigantic, as I’d hoped for.\n\nOne of the many reasons I’m pretty obsessed with this new record is its perfect blend of the heavy and the melodic and hearing them execute that so well tonight is a pleasure to watch. One minute you’re completely lost in a barrage of ludicrously heavy riffs and guttural screams, the next you’re floating on a cloud of candy floss. ‘Mutual Ruin’ is another gleaming example of this, particularly its beautifully concluding piano passage. Annoyingly, some drunk dude finds it appropriate to yell ROOOLLLOOO all over it, but is thankfully stopped by a select few punters politely telling him to shut the fuck up. Oh, I’ve missed gigs.\n\nOf course, it’s great to hear stuff from ‘Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It’, working really well against the new album material as well. ‘Alma Mater’ is completely brutal with its ferocious beat downs, while ‘Rituals’ nearly makes my head fall off with it’s pummelling doomy riff. As well as Rolo being superb at the heavy stuff, they’ve really nailed the melodic stuff recently. New track ‘Closer’ sounds stunning in all its shimmering, post-rock beauty and ‘Aftermath’ closes the main set with such elegance, the whole room swaying along to its infectious vocal refrains.\n\nYou have to give it to this band – they have always pushed themselves, not just in a recording setting but in a live setting as well. On top of that, they’ve put together an insanely well crafted live show that is equal amounts ferocious and euphoric. With three sets as good as this tonight, I reiterate my initial point on the UK metal scene being in the strongest position it’s ever been in right now, to the point of it being absolutely vital.

For me the album felt like an updated version of their seminal second LP ‘Gangs’, pushing their heavy side into the stratosphere. I expected the next record from ASIWYFA was going to be quite a drastic departure from its predecessor, and ‘Jettison’ sure is that.\n\nConceived as a multimedia project that the band have been able to perform live a few times now, in its audio form ‘Jettison’ acts as a continual 40 minute suite split into nine movements. From the moment it starts, you’re brought into an entirely different landscape to what you’d expect from your usual ASIWYFA opener; piano, strings, ambient textures and spoken word. The first half of this record is all about the slow burn and though we do get a quick dart off into an off-kilter math groove (‘Lung’) or a sprightly guitar lead (’In Air’), for the most part we ride on a wave of atmospheric soundscapes, orchestral swirls and gradual rhythmic builds.\n\nIt’s not until movements six to eight (‘Submerge’, ‘Emerge’ and ‘Jettison’) that things really start to kick off and we get the rock band we all knew was hiding in the wings. Guitar wise, some of the licks soar higher than they ever have before and it’s a pretty euphoric feeling when it really starts to hit. For this to then finish on ‘A.D Poet’, a gorgeously heart wrenching strings arrangement, shows clearly that ASIWYFA want to hit every emotion with maximum impact. Intended as a counterweight to the tense social climate, there is a lot of light and shade within the arrangements here that only enhances the very human connection that consumes it.\n\nThose that get their enjoyment from the more expansive, grandiose dynamics of post-rock will love this. Those that expect the full throttle, riff driven madness of And So I Watch You From Afar material may need to wait it out a bit longer. It’s totally worth the wait though and definitely brings out some classic ASIWYFA moments. ‘Jettison’ manages to continue to do what this band does best whilst pushing their sound into places we’ve not heard before and for this, this is a transcendently triumphant piece.\n\nMetronomy – Small World\n\n(Because Music)\n\nThe last time we heard from Metronomy in album form was on 2019’s ‘Metronomy Forever’; a sprawling, ambitious affair that very much felt like an amalgamation of everything we love about the project in its then 20 years of existence. After something that felt so grandiose, I was intrigued to see where Metronomy would go next. My thinking was, if they went big last time, then maybe this time they’d focus in and cut the fat.\n\nMy assumptions were correct as they hand in seventh album ‘Small World’, their most concise record to date. Concise not just in its nine track, 30 minute runtime, but also in its musical and lyrical themes. Usually ones to blend electronica, disco, indie and punk, here they gun for a simplistic indie pop sound, honing in on that traditional band-in-the-room feel.\n\nInfluentially it’s hard not to hear 80s Indie goliath’s such as The Cure and New Order seep in, especially on ‘Hold Me Tonight’ and ‘It’s Good To Be Back’ respectively. Ultimately, it has a very timeless quality to its songwriting and doesn’t get too flashy with its production or dynamics, just straight up, heart on sleeve pop songs.\n\nOn ’Things Will Be Fine’, band leader Joe Mount rewinds to his teens; when decisions and big ideas started to creep in and young adulthood was gently starting to unravel itself. This is a common theme across the record, which he beautifully links to his present life as a husband and father. This is an album that takes stock in the little things and as with most Metronomy songs, love prevails; especially on ‘Love Factory’ and ‘Right on Time’. I’ve always taken solace in Metronomy’s lighter, candid moments, so it’s really cool to see them craft a full album of them here. Shimmering in simplicity, ‘Small World’ is their most succinct and delightful album to date.\n\nSea Power – Everything Was Forever\n\n(Golden Chariot)\n\nExploding into the mid 00’s with wonky rock songs, elaborate stage sets and costumes, Sea Power really seemed to be in a league of their own. I’d argue that they’ve very much stayed there too, growing old with grace. With a sound that has flourished into being both lush and anthemic, you can count on Sea Power to deliver with consistency and distinctiveness.\n\n‘Everything Was Forever’ comes five years on from the sparkling synth pop tones of ‘Let The Dancers Inherit The Party’. Having particularly loved the crisp, glittering production of that record, I was hoping for a continuation of the rich, warm textures that swirled across it. If anything, Sea Power go even bigger, with some of their most widescreen material on show.\n\n’Scaring At The Sky’ comes in as a bit of a curveball, opening the record with warming, atmospheric indie folk stylings. It’s a beautiful easing in and definitely throws you off the scent as the next two tracks (‘Transmitter’ and ‘Two Fingers’) come in with stadium sized melodies and euphoric synth lines that feel as if they could move mountains. From there it’s a beautiful mix of psychedelic pop and dreamy indie, with just the right amount of post punk slotted in (the latter sounding particularly energising on the snappy ‘Doppelgänger’).\n\nAs always, Sea Power deliver a well balanced pallet of sounds with much elegance – I love, for example, the way ‘Fear Eats The Soul’ elegantly leads into ‘Folly’, a hauntingly beautiful and cinematic piece that manages to move into this electronically infused chamber pop track that still has an ethereal tone, but moves into a new direction. It’s a really well structured record that manages to flow so gracefully, despite its ever moving dynamic changes. In conclusion, ‘Everything Was Forever’ is a bold and beautiful effort that sounds like a band at a comfortable place in their career.\n\nLike what you see?

You’re running away from a creepy castle on a deserted road, when all of a sudden a cauldron of bats descends upon you, ultimately killing you. Bloody hell, will this week ever end?\n\nAlright, maybe that’s not an everyday scenario, but it IS the long and short of it in the brand new video for ‘Suck My Blood (Please Don’t)‘.\n\nThe piss-funny new video apes pixelated side-scrollers from back in the day, capturing Cheshire based musician Ben Forrester a.k.a. Cold Comfort as he legs it away from Transylvania with blood-thirsty bats right up his arse.\n\nDirected and edited by Tom Brewins (a mint drummer in his own right), the sticksman is rapidly becoming our favourite DIY director, having previously wowed us with videos for the likes of JOHN and his own band USA Nails (which might be one of our favourite videos of the past decade!) On working with Brewins:\n\n“… he came up with this really fun idea of me being in an old school video game quite literally batting off bats. I did a lot of running on the spot for this and totally realised just how unfit I am, but it was worth it to see the incredible editing Tom did on it.”\n\nIf you can take your eyes off our protagonists plight, the new single is an anthemic, fuzzy burst of energy, Forrester giving your ears a good seeing to as he rips it up in frantic fashion. Cut us off a slice of this!\n\nOff the back of releasing debut EP ‘Weak and Dazed‘ last November, the new single is backed with ‘I Shot The Messenger‘, together as a double A single released digitally to stream and download through Die Das Der on 18 February 2022. Live shows are on the horizon too, one of which is next week!\n\n26/02/22 – The Peer Hat, Manchester (w/ Thank and Obey Cobra)\n\n09/04/22 – Tiny Rebel, Cardiff (w/ The Vega Bodegas and Feverjaw)\n\nLike what you see?

A collie or pointer if I live in the countryside.\n\nEver picked up any injuries on tour?\n\nYes, I hurt my left ankle and hip by doing a funny run on wet cobblestone.

We equally love hearing from artists when things go dreadfully wrong. A song that was a piece of piss, written in 20 minutes? Or years in the making and a bastard to write?\n\nWhether it’s a song that came together through great duress or one that was smashed out in a short amount of time, we’re getting the lowdown from some of our favourites on the one song that they can’t stop thinking about – in their own words.\n\nOff the back of releasing the new Modern Nature record ‘Island Of Noise‘ (via Bella Union – vinyl pre-order available now), Jack Cooper talks us through ‘Spell‘. Take it away, Jack…\n\n“The Modern Nature records have all been written around a narrative or framework, so when it comes to picking out an individual song, it’s quite difficult. I’m not sure how well the individual tracks work without the context of what’s adjacent to them. I suppose a comparison would be to pick out an individual scene from a film to represent the overall picture.\n\nThe track ‘Spell‘ is probably the closest we’ve come to realising how I think of the music in my head. I realised whilst recording this album that when you impose time and meter on an idea, it can understandably constrict the music and therefore expression. The same can be said for trying to impose chords onto a musical idea. Songwriters will often imagine a melodic idea and then reach for an instrument to work out the chord progression. Once you do that, the idea changes very subtly to fit in with the chromatic scale, often to the detriment of the idea.\n\n‘Spell‘ ‘Ariel‘ and ‘Symmetry‘ are all performed in free time (albeit with some kind of loose pulse). The space and composure in the music on these tracks points towards where I’d like the music to go. It makes me think about the term ‘experimental’ when applied to music. I don’t think of these records as being experimental because the experiments made to develop this music isn’t evident on the record BUT these tracks in particular feel like experiments for the next record… so figure that out.“\n\nLike what you see?

The last time we heard from the New York formed outfit was when they released two albums in 2019. And in the time since then, three members have released solo records and they’ve recorded this here double album. I mean, talk about prolific. And what’s more, the quality across their back catalogue of just seven years has been extremely high, Big Thief becoming a band you can rely on to deliver the goods.\n\n‘Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You’ is their fifth album, recorded across four different studios, which contains 1 hour and 20 minutes of music. Basically, this is their White Album. And in that vein, it does whatever it feels like. The warming and harmonious alt folk they’re known for is ever present but of course, there are glimpses into sonic experimentation. This isn’t to say they’ve gone full psych, but there’s certainly a few twists here which keep you engaged across its mammoth track-list.\n\nOnly two tracks in and ‘Time Escaping’ is a cosmic mirage of percussion and swirling synth textures. ‘Little Things’ comes a little later in the first half, pushing the limits with layers of guitars, percussion and keys, with vocalist Adrianne sounding new levels of euphoric, swirling into the atmosphere with warm delays. It’s always seemed clear that the four members of Big Thief have an unfathomed chemistry together, but I’ve always enjoyed it when they’ve let the vibe take over, and that’s what propels some of its expansive passages.\n\nBut in the same breath, it’s a welcome feeling when we get some folk gems poking through. They just know how to lure you in and give you a big old melodic hug. ‘Certainty’ sounds like the musical equivalent of a well needed duvet day, while ‘Simulation Swarm’ has this deliciously gentle groove to it, complete with guitar solo, and has quickly become my favourite Big Thief song.\n\nI’ll be honest, ‘Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You’ needs time to let its sprawling run time bed in. It’s got plenty of immediate moments but as a whole, it’s supposed to be a bit ram shackle to warrant its tonal switch ups. It’s that total stream of musical consciousness that permeates this collection with a beautiful sense of freedom. The more you go through it, the more you move with it. Once again, Big Thief continue to impress, with sharp musicianship and solid songwriting that adds to their well loved sound, whilst also bursting forward into the great wide beyond.\n\nLike what you see?

LAUNDROMAT answer a series of inane questions!\n\na/s/l?\n\n40/m/Brighton UK.\n\nHave you ever seen a dead body?\n\nNot a human one, no.\n\nWho is your favourite Simpsons character?\n\nHomer, straight up.\n\nWhat T-Shirt are you wearing?\n\nA yellow one that says ‘Big Crown Records’ on the front.\n\nWhat did your last text message say?\n\n‘UB40 Power Rangers’.\n\nWhat’s the last song you listened to?\n\n‘Forget Me Not’ by Say She She & Piya Malik.\n\nHow did you meet the people in your band?\n\nThe line-up shifts about a fair bit, but the current squad consists of a pal from back in the day and two new friends made through the Brighton music scene. They’re megadudes. I’ve been real lucky with players for Laundromat.\n\nWhat’s the first record you bought?\n\nI think it was a cassette of The Bluetones, ‘Expecting to Fly’ from Our Price in Aldershot.\n\nWhat was your favourite VHS growing up?\n\nThere was a mad old kids thing called Fuzzbucket, I used to love watching that at my Grandparents place. Jesus, I just googled it. It looks so weird.\n\nWhen was the last time you cried?\n\nAbout a week ago, I was listening to Prom Song by Pile and the guitar solo reduced me to tears. I just started full on blubbing.\n\nHave you ever kissed someone & regretted it?\n\nyyyyyyyyep.\n\nBest Physical Feature?\n\nThe backs of my knees. Super proud of those.\n\nWorst physical feature?\n\nWithout a doubt my Cochlear hair cells.\n\nReasonably ok/not bad feature that you’re not fussed about?\n\nMy nose. It probably used to be my favourite feature, but I took a swift knee to the face about 8 years ago – my nose cracked and it’s never been the same since.\n\nDo you have any pets?\n\nI do not.\n\nEver picked up any injuries on tour?\n\nYeh, Tinnitus – it’s absolutely no joke. Also I’ve fallen off a few stages in my time, I did my ankle in a number of times that way, flopping about like an idiot.\n\nWhat did you do for your last birthday?\n\nI celebrated at my local, The Bee’s Mouth in Brighton, where a bunch of friends and I made fools of ourselves. And then I got Covid.\n\nName something you CANNOT wait for?\n\nTo see my family. It’s been years.\n\nDo you have a crush on someone?\n\nAll the time.\n\nWhat’s the shittest experience you’ve had as a musician?\n\nHold up, isn’t this meant to be a quickfire thing?\n\nIf you could go back in time, how far would you go?\n\n40 years.\n\nHow do you want to die?\n\nLate morning on a Summers day, having a coffee and a lean out front of a service station, somewhere in mainland Europe.\n\nWhat’s your favourite thing about pizza?\n\nProbably the vague association with TMNT.\n\nWhat are you craving right now?\n\nWatermelon.\n\nHave you ever been on a horse?\n\nI have not, I don’t think.\n\nWhat did you dream about last night?\n\nThe guitarist from a band called CLT DRP. It involved him and I trying and failing to disarm a bomb.\n\nIf you could go back in time and kill the baby Hitler, would you?\n\nI’m not sure killing babies is the way to go.\n\nDo you like Chinese food?\n\nSort of. I lived in China for a short while. Some of the meals scared the living hell out of me, but I was also regularly cooked for by a friend of the family known as ‘Uncle’, and he made the most delicious meals.\n\nHave you ever been on TV?\n\nI had a music video on MTV2 once, where you could see me flopping about like an idiot.\n\nEver meet someone famous?\n\nI once spent a night in a bar with the son of Bruce Reynolds, the mastermind of The Great Train Robbery. He was a proper laugh, we listened to Trout Mask Replica on the jukebox and shouted a lot.\n\nWhat do you want to be when you grow up?\n\nI wanted to be a street cleaner. I used to wake up early and watch them out the window, loved seeing those mad little vehicles with brushes on the front. Kid can dream.\n\n‘Combo‘ is out now via Brace Yourself Records!

Fuck that for a game of soldiers.\n\nForward thinking labels the likes of Skin Graft Records out of the US and the UK’s Box Records have got the right idea, joining forces to bring together two raging releases split across two sides of wax to satisfy noise fans both side of the pond.\n\n‘Split‘ sees the release of new tracks from USA Nails and Psychic Graveyard, available April 1st 2022 on randomly mixed coloured vinyl variants (limited to 400 pieces worldwide) with a choice OBI strip to really seal the deal.\n\nHaving been utterly chuffed with just about everything they’ve put out, we’re delighted to share an exclusive first listen to the USA Nails side of things. ‘It’s All In The Context‘ is an absolute mind-melter, screeching into life and packing loads into a raging little 50 second parcel.\n\nRecorded with Wayne Adams at Bear Bites Horse (naturally), of the track, guitarist and vocalist Steven Hodson suggests “It’s about trying to understand both sides of an issue. How peoples’ past experience has lead them to where they are. And how they justify weird or extreme behaviour and such.“\n\nThe Vinyl and CD pre order links for those in the UK can be found here, whilst Yanks can look here for such things.\n\nBoth bands are hopefully out on the road this year too, Psychic Graveyard joining the gnarly METZ throughout the UK and Europe between April and May, whilst USA Nails join Mclusky for three dates!\n\n01.04.22 Bristol – Fleece w/ Mclusky\n\n02.04.22 Manchester – Gorilla w/ Mclusky\n\n03.04.22 Birmingham – Hare & Hounds w/ Mclusky\n\n01.04.22 Leicester – O2 Academy Leicester w/ METZ\n\n02.04.22 Blackpool – Bootleg Social w/ METZ\n\n03.04.22 Manchester – YES w/ METZ\n\n04.04.22 Newcastle Upton Tyne – Cluny w/ METZ\n\n06.04.22 Glasgow – Stereo w/ METZ\n\n07.04.22 Leeds – Brudenell Social Club w/ METZ\n\n08.04.22 Bristol – Thekla w/ METZ\n\n09.04.22 Brighton – Green Door Store w/ METZ\n\n10.04.22 London – Scala w/ METZ\n\nLike what you see?

Prepare for mediocrity and anything else is a bonus, right? Following three sold out dates in London and Nottingham last week, the anticipation to see Turnstile live had been bubbling up, making it hard to stick to this credo. Then again, anything but fever pitch would seem inappropriate, considering I’ve listened to their latest album ‘GLOW ON‘ on and off every week since its release last August.\n\nThe outfit from Baltimore, Maryland hadn’t just got us worked up of course, their third studio album lighting up EOY lists a mere two months ago. With this being their only Northern date, it seemed everyone on the train into Leeds was off to the show. I don’t like to judge a book by its cover, but it wasn’t a shock to see the lad with tunnels who got on at Huddersfield drinking a PBR tallboy re-appear later on at the Refectory…\n\nAs Whitney Houston blared out of the speakers at the venue, the room joined her in belting out ‘I Wanna Dance With Somebody‘ in Saturday night right-on-it fashion. Before long, the lights went down and a big cheer went up as a pink ‘GLOW ON‘ style haze appeared on stage. The bass thud signalled the arrival of “Freaky” Franz Lyons, the bassist boo’d on arrival as he was inexplicably wearing a Man United shirt (if it was intentional trolling, fair play to him!)\n\nOpener ‘Mystery‘ put to bed any sense of disappointment, the kick-off for the evening being a joyous burst of euphoria that would carry on throughout the night, everything from the new record sounding just as engaging from the stage. The crowd did their best to be just as loud as vocalist Brendan Yates, letting it all come out having patiently waited to hear the new album in a live capacity.\n\nThe sold out room came alive for just about everything dished out from on stage, often singing back riffs in between shouting back every lyric. “Shake it up!” Yelled out Yates not long after they’d raced through ‘Real Thing‘ from 2018s ‘Time & Space‘, one of the many instructions, encouragements and yelps given throughout the night as he vibed off the energy of the punters. Bodies shot up above the heads of others constantly, rolling about in the surf whilst a topless Yates threw his body about, prone to bust a move.\n\nA change of vantage point from behind a pillar by the stage to nearer the bar provided a different atmosphere entirely and looking at the crowd as one from the back captured the room like an artist’s impression. The colours from on stage – pink, purple and a mist of blue for the rush of ‘FLY AGAIN‘ – lit up the crowd beautifully as the band did their thing from up above.\n\nYates told the people before him that if they had someone in the crowd they love, they should lift that person up and invite them to climb onto their shoulders. Having tweaked my back sweeping the living room earlier that day, I had to politely decline, but I was in the minority, and the outpouring of love was clear via the many jumping up onto their loved ones shoulders.\n\n‘T.L.C. (TURNSTILE LOVE CONNECTION)‘ (one of our top 50 tracks of 2021) came in hot as the closer, the last chance to rip it up amongst the congregation. Multiple bodies flung themselves into the pit from the balcony above and my companion hit the deck himself whilst trying to two-step. The audio bled out long after the band had departed, the purple and pink lights shining on the crowd as they shot off into the night, coming down off a Turnstile high.\n\nLike what you see?
