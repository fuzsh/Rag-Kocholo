        "text": "On her label debut, Corrinne James is still laying her vulnerabilities on the line in what sounds like the most intimate setting.\n\nGeoff Rickly shares how the continuation of what looked like a one-off side-project allowed him to scratch an itch left untouched by the recent Thursday reunion.\n\nThis sophomore solo LP is an exhilarating ride with some moments of magic, but one that never quite reaches the inimitable heights that Dillinger Escape Plan offered.\n\nThe Circa Survive vocalist’s latest solo release sees him turn all his pained experience and existential torment into a gorgeous soundtrack to pure, distilled feeling.\n\nThere’s a real darkness holding the quiet hush of the Brooklyn-based duo’s debut full-length together, which reveals a deep pain and trauma if you pay attention.\n\nThe West Coast punks’ 1980 debut full-length stands as both an important historical document and a necessary, contemporary reflection of the world today.\n\nThis self-titled record takes The Mars Volta in the most unexpected of directions as it firmly shakes off any preconceptions of what this band is or ever was.\n\nThe fifth full-length from the Baltimore post-hardcore outfit is a beautifully bleak yet overwhelmingly comforting examination of life.\n\nDespite being a record about feeling stuck, the Norwegian trio’s sophomore LP shimmers with an infectious freedom and inexorable vitality.\n\nCarré Callaway’s latest is a brilliant testament to human endurance, to battling extreme adversity, to keeping going when you really don’t want to.\n\nWhile this motley crew surely had no idea of the profound impact their songs would go on to have on alternative music and culture, this 1982 debut EP nevertheless sounds revolutionary, vital, important.\n\nIt’s the cumulative effect of the Austin rockers’ 11th LP that makes this album what it is: an interdimensional fever dream that reinvents the entire history of modern music.\n\nThe latest from the Cincinnati-based folk songwriter captures the extremes of the human experience, the highs and lows of being alive.\n\nThe songwriter’s 18th LP is a haunted concept album that brings to life the tired hearts, souls, and minds of characters based in a distant, perhaps parallel, past.\n\nThe Austrian political-punk four-piece’s unfortunately timely third record is out now via Hassle Records.\n\nThe Ontario punks’ sixth full-length New Ruin is out August 5 via Fat Wreck Records.\n\nBarry Johnson talks blending past and present on 40 oz. to Fresno, and how curiosity continues to fuel the West Coast pop-punk outfit."
