        "text": "Practical lessons learned rock climbing hundreds of feet up at Joshua Tree. Lesson 3Ô∏è‚É£: The Crux. The Crux is the section of a climb with the greatest difficulty or where the greatest danger is. The legendary Action Directe in Frankenjura, Germany is only 49ft. But has a crux where the climber holds onto the slab with a SINGLE finger from each hand. (Shown below) I did NOT do that in Joshua Tree, but my climbs had cruxes as well. And they sucked. What can the Crux teach you? 1. There is always at least one crux when climbing up, sometimes multiple. Whether you like it or not, it‚Äôs there. Embrace it. 2. To conquer the crux, preparation and determination are your greatest allies. He who conquers the mountain, conquers himself. 3. Often, the greatest joy comes not from completing the journey, but from completing the most difficult part of the journey. Learn to love the process and not just the prize. Each job, each goal, each day has its crux. üßó‚ôÇÔ∏è Embrace it, plan for it, start climbing it. Then celebrate the victories you have throughout it. #ruppertlandscape #businessdeveloper #construction #crux #rockclimbing #willpower\n\nThe bass are biting and the crawfish are boiling on Toledo Bend.
