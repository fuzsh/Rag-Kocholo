        "text": "WELCOME TO THE SOCIAL MEDIA ESCAPE CLUB\n\nHi, I’m Seth Werkheiser, and you can call me Seth W (he/him).\n\nI’ve written about having a SOCIAL MEDIA ESCAPE PLAN over the last few years. Now it’s time to turn this place into an actual club, an online space, an internet support group for creative folks who want to escape social media.\n\nThis club is for any creative person who has said the following out loud, with friends, or to themselves:\n\n“I wish I didn’t have to be on social media to promote my work.”\n\nIt’s time to escape the algorithmic depths and launch into a dimension of cosmic possibility.\n\nEmbark on your journey with 2,100+ other subscribers - subscribe today!\n\nWHAT DO WE DO HERE?\n\nI usually send a newsletter once a week, sometimes twice, if something happens in the social media landscape that makes my blood boil.\n\nLeave comments on posts - this is a great way to meet other creative folks on a similar journey!\n\nCheck out my ongoing “Where are you at with social media?” thread and see how you’re not alone!\n\nSend me questions, comments, and challenges: sethw@sethw.xyz\n\nP.S. I’ve been writing about this stuff long before I made this newsletter, so check out my Social Media category archive (it goes back to 2012) on my sethw.xyz blog.\n\nGUIDANCE SESSIONS\n\nI’m available to talk about how you can escape the social media rat race, reach your fans, and sustainably grow an email list.\n\nCheck out my Guidance Sessions page for more details.\n\n✅ “I’ve spent the better part of two weeks trying to drill down on what that intention might be and finally found it just a couple of days ago in conversation with my friend Seth Werkheiser. Btw, Seth is a fellow substacker who is as spectacular as he is insightful,” Nina from Flora & Forage.\n\nWHO IS SETH WERKHEISER?\n\nI do D2C email operations for Grammy Award-winning MNRK Heavy: home to bands like High On Fire, Underoath, Creeping Death, Rolo Tomassi, The Callous Daoboys, Crowbar, and tons more.\n\nI sent D2C emails for Death Row Records in 2021 (before it sold to Snoop Dog) and individual band campaigns for Holdtight PR in mid-2022. I’ve worked on email newsletters with Artists & Fleas, SOFIE, Black Label Society, Nina Nastasia, and Solid MFG.\n\nI got my start in all this as a music blogger.\n\nI launched the Noisecreep metal blog for AOL Music back in 2008, and that shirt I’m wearing (above) is from the music blog I started back in 2001, so yeah, 23 years of running music sites, working with music publicists and labels, going to shows, and tons more.\n\nGet in touch! sethw@sethw.xyz"
