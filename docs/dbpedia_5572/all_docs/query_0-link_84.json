        "text": "The preamble for this interview has literally been derailed in the past 24 hours with the news that Rozi Plain, the Winchester raised artist of solo adventures and This Is The Kit fame, will be opening up for Paramore this spring! Bloody nora!\n\nAlright, right back down to earth. You see, before that massive slice of news received this week, there was a slightly smaller matter to attend to (but no less important) – releasing a new album and being interviewed by Birthday Cake For Breakfast in the space of four days. It’s enough to make you want to support Hayley Williams and co!\n\n‘Prize‘ (out now via Memphis Industries / Dinked) follows ‘What A Boost’ from 2019 and comes in as her fifth long-player. Described on these very pages as “her most refined set to date”, the theme of collaboration runs thick through it, with contributions from Kate Stables (This Is The Kit), Alabaster Deplume, Serafina Steer (Bas Jan, Jarv Is) and Yoshino Shigihara (Yama Warashi), to name a few.\n\nOn a Monday lunchtime, from my maisonette in Manchester, I spoke with Rozi via the world wide web, herself broadcast from the living room of Rachel Horwood (Bas Jan member and a keen Rozi Plain contributor) in Bristol. A string of in-stores were on the cards to coincide with the release of ‘Prize’ and it was here where our conversation began, with Rozi venting on a car emergency that nixed the first stop on the tour (suitably occurring on Friday the 13th.)\n\nRozi Plain: I couldn’t believe it. I paid the AA and I wasn’t at home, they were just like – yeah, you just need to take it to a garage. I was like – but I can’t take it to a garage, I don’t live here and it’s 6PM. They just drove off, it was awful. Oh my god. Anyway, sorry – I didn’t need to go into that.\n\nBirthday Cake For Breakfast: Did I read correctly that Friday the 13th was actually quite a date for your family in that it’s when your parents met and your sister passed her tractor driving test, is that right?\n\nRP: Exactly *Laughs* Yeah my sister went to Agricultural college and she passed her tractor driving test then.\n\nBCFB: On that, you were saying you’ve not had too many issues in the past with all this travelling about. Touring though itself was obviously cut off with the pandemic, how did this impact you on a day to day – were you able to sit at home and stay still or were you still collaborating with people?\n\nRP: Well I mean, I definitely did sit at home and stay still, because that’s what everyone had to do. But I mean, we did make an album in the pandemic. When we were allowed and could, we went to Glasgow a few times, me Gerard (Black) and Jamie (Whitby-Coles), to work on the songs there before we recorded it and to my parents’ house when they were away. I think actually this time we did more sort of working on the songs before recording than I’d done in the past.\n\nBut to sort of actually be able to get us all together and go and do the recording, that took a long time to be allowed. Logistically, because we went to do it in the South of France, we had to sort of wait till the quarantine ended… No one had the time to quarantine going there and quarantine coming back.\n\nBut yeah, it did impact stuff, but I’m pleased that we did manage to get an album done and it felt really special the time together.\n\nBCFB: On that – coming out of Covid and the pandemic, you’ve said elsewhere that it felt so special to play with others again and be able to still get out there and get on the road and such, something maybe that you’d taken for granted. How’ve you found getting back out there and were there any reservations?\n\nRP: I think there’s definitely things that have changed… Just realising the physical effect of these things on your body. It’s hard – I don’t mean it’s harder than other people’s jobs – but just noticing the physical knackering-ness on your human body. Charging around, lugging stuff around all the time. Also, just the sort of lengths that are gone to to make nice stuff happen…\n\nWe did a few of those sort of distanced shows and it was really good to be able to do them. For me, it was really great to play with the band and be with them and it was nice to do the things, but it was also… I don’t think I thought as much ‘is it worth it?’ but just this weird, weird environment of everyone’s feelings being so scrutinised all the time and you sort of being forced to say ‘Oh this is so great being together and doing stuff…’ It was just weird, it was almost painful. It was almost worse, it’s just sort of like someone herding you into a corner and then going ‘HAVE A NICE TIME NOW’.\n\nA thing for me that feels really nice about things being more normal is to regain some sort of sense of privacy about enjoying things and doing things and it not being this enormous organised event. You can do your stuff and it can mean something to you privately or something, instead of just constantly having to assess, which was also of course so necessary, people have to talk to each other about what’s happening and it was hugely significant for stuff to happen again. But that element I found deeply exhausting, just talking about how you felt about it, how weird it was, how nice it was… Oh god, that bit was so painful, I found that really painful. It’s nice to just sort of ooze back into your interests, your enjoying things in your personal private way.\n\nBCFB: …And being able to also step your foot off the gas, so to speak, in terms of – maybe I don’t have to do this or maybe I don’t have to engage with everything.\n\nRP: I feel like I’m sounding really gloomy about it, and I really don’t mean that. It’s really lovely to do stuff and I’m so thrilled to be touring again. But yeah, also I’m really looking forward to just being on tour, because so far since new stuff for this album has come out, I’ve just sort of been putting things on the internet. We haven’t really been doing that many shows, so it’s really cool to do some more tangible feeling stuff. Doing gigs, selling records, making some t-shirts.\n\nBCFB: From the lows of the car breaking down to the highs of last week… Three years on from your last release, we’ve pushed through a pandemic and whatever else has gone on (we won’t talk about the pandemic anymore), it’s finally out and better than that, it’s being received really well. In terms of your side of things, not just yourself but the players on the record, how has everything been in your camp? Rather than a sense of relief, has it just been a great feeling to just get it out there?\n\nRP: Yeah, it is a great feeling to get it out there. I mean, we finished it a long time ago now, so it’s also that funny thing of you’ve had the stuff for ages and then it’s suddenly out there. But it’s really mad how people responding to it well makes a huge difference. *Laughs* Because yes, I guess when you then have a release date in the distance and you’ve got that long to sort of worry about it, as well as – I felt really pleased with it – but I thought, god, I wonder what do people think of anything these days.\n\nBut it’s really, especially the last couple of weeks, there’s been a lot of really nice reviews. I don’t know, it’s just weird things, like there was a thing in the Guardian – that made a huge difference, that had such a big response from that being there. It’s funny that these things do make a really big difference, in a people seeing it way. I definitely feel much more relaxed about it, which makes sense, but I’m also surprised the effect that has.\n\nBCFB: It seems to often be the case with your work and obviously playing in This Is The Kit at the same time, but nevertheless, there’s quite the list of players on the new record, helpfully listed on the inner of the record itself. From Kate (Stables) to what looks most of Bas Jan as well.\n\nRP: Look, here’s one of Bas Jan right now! *Rozi whips her laptop round to reveal Rachel Horwood herself in earshot*. There she is, hello Rachel.\n\nBCFB: *Waves* …So obviously without going into Bas Jan too much because one is sat right there, how stoked were you to get everyone involved and again, get everyone to put the record together with you? On that, were there any particular favourite parts that you were really chuffed with and how they worked out?\n\nRP: It’s always thrilling, the things people can bring out in the music by their interpretation. It’s such a privilege that people are up for playing and adding stuff. I was really thrilled that my friend Cole – they’re called Cole Pulice – I love their music so much and they played on a couple of songs. We did the single for Adult Swim a few months ago (‘Silent Fan’), they have like a Singles Club thing, and Cole added some stuff for that and then they did some more for the album. I love their playing so much, so it was really thrilling.\n\nGerard, he had a couple of new keyboards that did some really funny, surprising things, and they sort of had a really significant impact on the album. From me and Jamie going up there and spending quite a few days, we tried loads of stuff. I think we’d never be able to get those sounds back again, because no one can remember how we did it. *Laughs* They really changed the direction of a few of the songs.\n\nBCFB: Do you think that’s the amazing thing about collaboration? That you can write a song and then have everyone add a nuts keyboard part or what have you. Do you think that’s the best thing about putting it out there for everyone else to involve themselves?\n\nRP: Yeah, absolutely. You have so much to learn when you collaborate with other people. The limits of what you can do is suddenly opened out and it’s just like – what a thrilling thing to experience, other people’s ideas. I think it’s really important to make the most of the musicians that you play with. I can be really specific, but also I want to make the most out of these musicians, I don’t just want to say ‘play exactly this part’.\n\nBCFB: In terms of getting everyone together, I was reading about ‘What A Boost’ – it came about in various locations – an old dentist’s studio in Clapton, an RAF base in Suffolk. This time around, you had moments on the Isle of Eigg, Glasgow, Margate, parts of France and also Total Refreshment Centre in London. I take it that – getting from this conversation I would assume this is the case – it’s magical being able to not only say we did this here, we did that there, but just being able to do it in these locations must just be a total thrill.\n\nRP: Yes, it is thrilling doing stuff in different locations, but it’s always how it’s been because we don’t all live in the same place and we’re on tour a lot, so we’re always in different locations. Yes, we went to the South of France to make this thing and it was a really thrilling adventure going that long way to do it, but I live in London, Jamie lives in Bristol, Gerard lives in Glasgow, Amaury (Ranger) lives in Paris – everyone’s in different places anyway, so whenever we do stuff together, it involves a lot of geography. It involves being in different places and logistics dictate that you have to sort of be – ok, this is the easiest place for us to go, this makes the most sense for us.\n\nIt’s not necessarily born out of a romantic idea of adventure and travel, it’s practical decisions sometimes. But that does involve adventure and travel and it is remarkable the places make a difference and you have a feeling in places, but also it’s us in those places doing our stuff and that’s what we’re trying to capture. I don’t mean to sound like I’m dissing on places, because I’m not dissing on places. But yeah…\n\nBCFB: A logistical point getting everything together really. But still magic, in a sense.\n\nRP: But still magic, nevertheless. *Laughs*\n\nBCFB: One of the magical sounding places is the Isle of Eigg, which I’d only heard about because of Pictish Trail. So, you were recording an EP for Lost Map, is that right?\n\nRP: Yeah, me and Gerard and Jamie went, three years ago now. Lost Map did this thing called ‘Visitations’, that was a sort of EP series where you’d go and stay in this bothy and make an EP of new music that you come up with there. We went there for a week and made this EP, but sort of came up with a few ideas and a couple of things came into the album as well.\n\nBut yeah, it’s a really, really amazing place, it sort of feels like the raw earth. It’s just this crazy, rocky, beautiful island – you can really feel how sculpted by the weather it’s been over thousands and thousands of years and it feels like it probably doesn’t look that different than it did thousands of years ago. It’s a really, really remarkable place to be. It’s such an epic journey getting there, driving through incredible landscape and then getting the ferry there.\n\nBCFB: With the record itself on the horizon, like you say you had a due date and such, even though a practicality comes into it with locations and such, did you not fancy ticking off a few more locations that you could stick on the back of the record?\n\nRP: To be honest, I didn’t say all the loads of places… There’s loads of extra recordings in people’s houses. There is loads of other locations in there, it just felt a bit too faffy to actually go and list all of them. But yeah, loads of other locations were involved in it, but those ones on there were the sort of main crux and I didn’t want to bore people with details. *Laughs* ‘Cus it would just be this really long list – this song was recorded in a van, a bit of this was added… There was some stuff in Brussels…\n\nBCFB: You could push for a gatefold sleeve though, maybe next time. You know, to just list everything.\n\nRP: I will, I will do that. *Laughs*\n\nBCFB: In another practicality sense, there was something about the contract that it had to be 10 songs long or what have you. But it’s notable that your releases seem to hit 10 songs for each one. As a firm believer in 10 track album’s being perfect and if they can go below 30 minutes, that’s even better, was it all a handy coincidence with that sort of thing or is it a conscious choice?\n\nRP: Yeah, I don’t know. Someone was asking me about this the other day. I think probably I just somehow think album’s need to be 10 songs at the minimum, but I don’t actually think that and I love it – and I feel like it happens a bit more now – that people release nine song albums or something. Also, I’m a really slow worker, I’m not really prolific and I don’t have loads of extra songs to choose from, so that wasn’t particularly me whittling it down to 10, that was me having 10 songs. *Laughs*\n\nBCFB: It would be nice I’m sure if you had 50 demos to work from…\n\nRP: It WOULD be nice. It WOULD be nice if you had 50 demos to work from.\n\nBCFB: This is gonna be a funny one, but I’ve read about this in reference to your music and I’m sure you get this all the time.\n\nRP: Uh-oh.\n\nBCFB: Yeah… On top of being branded folk and what have you, there’s always discussion saying your music, the listener goes into their own realm. They can hit play and then they’re in their own world. Even though that’s obviously the sort of thing that music reviewers talk about, do you feel that that is kind of mirrored in your own playing and when you all get together and produce the record and such, that you can go into this world and get lost in the music?\n\nRP: I guess. When we’re making it, I want the feeling to be compelled to keep doing it and go into it. When that happens, then people do get a bit lost in it.\n\nIsn’t it interesting though, that when people writing about the album say – if you’re listening to it, you get lost in your own world. That statement is an open thing. I love it when people say stuff like that because it’s like a sort of open statement and I know it’s difficult describing music, how lucky that it’s not my job to describe the music. Other people can do that, that’s fine. But it is funny to me when people say it’s this type of music, it’s really reductive, it’s a closed statement. I’m so grateful for people writing about it and people interpreting it and people feeling a certain thing, that’s fine, people can say it. But it’s just interesting to me that through describing something, you can say something that shuts it off slightly by calling it a thing, or you can describe a feeling that you get from it and it opens it out and I think that makes me, if I’m reading about something, that makes me interested to listen to it.\n\nBCFB: Just to finish up, obviously you’ve been sat on this record for a while so I take it that we’re ready for the follow up any day now?\n\nRP: Oh yes, that’s already been recorded. *Laughs*\n\nBCFB: So are there plans to get moving or is it just a case of focusing on ‘Prize’ now?\n\nRP: Focus on ‘Prize’ now, yeah. But yes, I do feel like when you make an album, by the time you finish it you’re really good at making albums. You’ve remembered all the stuff about your own decision making and how to do stuff. You’re in such a good position to do another one quickly, but you haven’t written any songs. So you have to go and forget it all, spend ages writing loads of songs, then spend ages trying to remember how to do it, have a few little crises along the way and then remember it all again just in time for it to come out. Then forget it all again."
