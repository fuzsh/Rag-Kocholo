        "text": "Tribes\n\nRollo — You’ve been a major help to my understanding the underlying dynamics between men and women. I’ve observed them in bits and pieces over the years but never really understood the whys behind them or how to turn them in our favor.\n\nIt seems like one mid-term focus you have is on male-male dynamics, specifically fathers and sons. But I also wonder whether you’d consider writing more about bonding and support between men and how those relationships can anchor men’s lives at a time when male relationships are regarded with skepticism by larger society. Lately it’s struck me that men tend to innately trust the men they know and distrust those they don’t (and that it’s often the reverse for women). This inclines us to believe women when they decry the “assholes” who have mistreated them in the past while women are empathetic and credulous toward women whose character they don’t know and whom they’ve never met.\n\nMany of us out here are lacking strong male relationships, and our small social circles translate to fewer men we innately trust and more men we innately don’t. Women seem to regard male friendships as a luxury at best — we should be focusing on career, family, and her needs — while women’s friendships are seen as a lifeline in their crazy, have-it-all world. Indeed, a man discouraging his wife/girlfriend’s friendships is widely seen as a sign of emotional abuse, whereas the reverse is “working on the relationship.”\n\nThis strikes me as a deep but largely untapped Red Pill well and could provide essential guidance for men looking to live a proud, constructive Red Pill life however women and children might fit into it. I’d definitely welcome your insights in future entries.\n\nBack in February of 2016 blogger Roosh proposed (and attempted to initiate) a worldwide event that would be a sort of ’gathering of the tribes’ with the intent of having men get together in small local gatherings to “just have a beer and talk amongst like-minded men.” My impression of the real intent behind putting this together notwithstanding, I didn’t think it was a bad idea. However, the problem this kind of ’tribes meeting’ suffers from is that it’s entirely contrived to put unfamiliar men together for no other purpose than to “have a beer and talk.” The problem with unfamiliar men coming together simply to meet and relate is a noble goal, however, the fundamental ways men communicate naturally makes the function of this gathering seem strange to men.\n\nWomen Talk, Men Do\n\nThe best male friends I have share one or more common interests with me — a sport, a hobby, music, art, fishing, lifting, golf, snowmobiling, etc. — and the best conversations I can remember with these friends occurred while we were engaged in some particular activity or event. Even when it’s just moving a friend into his new house it’s about accomplishing something together and in that time relating about whatever is relevant. When I lived in Florida some of the best conversations I had with my studio guys were during some project we had to collaborate on for a week or two.\n\nWomen, on the other hand, make time for, and with the expressed purpose of, talking between girlfriends. Over coffee perhaps, but the act of communication is more important than the event or activity. Even a ’stitch-and-bitch’ where women get together socially to knit, is simply an organized excuse to get together and relate. For women, communication is about context. They are intrinsically rewarded by how that communication makes them feel. For men communication is about content and they are rewarded by the exchange of information, solutions to problems and ideas.\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, it’s likely that our hunter-gatherer tribal roles had a hand in men and women’s communication differences. Men went to hunt together and practiced the coordinated actions for a cooperative goal. Bringing down a prey animal or building a communal shelter would likely have been a very information-crucial effort. In fact, the earliest cave paintings were essentially records of a successful hunt and instructions on how other men might do it too. Early men’s communication would necessarily have been a content driven discourse or the tribe didn’t eat.\n\nSimilarly women’s communications would’ve been during gathering efforts and childcare. It would stand to reason that due to women’s more collectivist roles they would evolve to be more intuitive, and context oriented, rather than object oriented. A common recognition in the manosphere is women’s predisposition toward collectivism and/or a more socialist bent to thinking about resource distribution. Whereas men tend to distribute rewards and resources primarily based on merit, women have a tendency to spread resources collectively irrespective of merit. Again this predisposition is likely due to how women’s psychological ’hard-wiring’ evolved as part of the circumstances of their tribal roles.\n\nFrom this perspective it’s a fairly easy follow to see how the tendency of men to distrust unfamiliar (out-group) men might be a response to a survival threat whereas women’s implicit trust of any member of the ’Sisterhood’ would be a species-survival benefit for the sex that requires the most parental investment and mutual support. There is also a notion that early men’s predisposition towards the infanticide of his rivals children, and the uncertainty of paternity within a tribal collective made covert communication and collusion among women a survival necessity.\n\nDivide & Conquer\n\nIn our post-masculine, feminine-primary, social order it doesn’t take a Red Pill Lens to observe the many examples of how the Feminine Imperative goes to great lengths to destroy the intrasexual ’tribalism’ of men. Since the time of the Sexual Revolution the social press of equalism has attempted to force a commonly accepted unisex expectation upon men to socialize and interact among themselves in the same, socially ’correct’ way that women do.\n\nThe duplicity in this striving towards “equality” is, of course, the same we find in all of the socialization efforts of egalitarian equalism — the emasculation of men in the name of equality. A recent (2015), rather glaring, example of this social push can be found at Harvard University where more than 200 female students demonstrated against a new policy to discourage participation in single-gender clubs at the school. Women were very supportive of the breaking of gender barriers when it meant that men could no longer discriminate in male-exclusive (typically male-space) organizations, but when that same equalist metric was applied to women’s exclusive organizations, then, the cries were accusations of insensitivity and the banners read “Women’s Groups Keep Women Safe.”\n\nThat’s a pretty fresh incident that outlines the dynamic, but it’s important to understand the underlying intent of the “fine for me, but not for thee” duplicity here. That intent is to divide and control men’s communication by expecting them to communicate as women do, and ideally to do so of their own accord by conditioning them to accept women’s communication methods as the normatively correct way to communicate. The most effective social conventions are the ones in which the participants willingly take part in and willingly encourage others to believe is correct.\n\nTribes vs. The Sisterhood\n\nBecause men have such varied interests, passions and endeavors based on them it’s easy to see how men compartmentalize themselves into various sub-tribes. Whether it’s team sports (almost always a male-oriented endeavor), cooperative enterprises, cooperative forms of art or just hobbies men share, it is a natural progression for men to form sub-tribes within the larger whole of conventional masculinity.\n\n“Four experiments confirmed that women’s automatic in-group bias is remarkably stronger than men’s and investigated explanations for this sex difference, derived from potential sources of implicit attitudes”\n\nThis quote sums up the results of Rudman, L. A., & Goodwin, S. A. (2004). Gender differences in automatic in-group bias: Why do women like women more than men like men? Journal of personality and social psychology, 87(4), 494.\n\nBecause of a man’s’ outward reaching approach to interacting with the world around him, there’s really no unitary male tribe in the same fashion that the collective ’Sisterhood’ of women represents. One of the primary strengths of the Feminine Imperative has been its unitary tribalism among women. We can see this evidenced in how saturated the Feminine Imperative has become into mainstream society and how it’s embedded itself into what would otherwise be diametrically opposed factions among women. Political, socioeconomic and religious affiliations of women (various sub-tribes) all become secondary to the interests of ’womankind’ when embracing the collective benefits of just being women and leveraging both their default victimhood and protected statuses.\n\nThus, we see no internal disconnect when women simultaneously embrace a hostile opposition to one social faction while still enjoying the benefits that faction might offer to the larger whole of the ’Sisterhood’. The Sisterhood is unitary first and then it is broken down into sub-tribes. Family, work, interests, political / religious compartmentalizations become sublimated to fostering the collective benefits of womankind.\n\nSpeculatively, I can understand the evolutionary benefits of how this psychological dynamic came to be, but I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out just how effective this collectivity has been in shaping society towards a social ideal that supports an unfettered drive towards women’s need to optimize Hypergamy. This unitary, women-first, tribalism has been (and still is) the key to women’s social power — and even in social environments where women genuinely do suffer oppression, the Sisterhood will exercise this gender-tribalism.\n\nGiven this collectivist, female gender tribe vs. atomized male tribes we begin to see why men organizing what might be a ’Brotherhood’ is so difficult and discouraged.\n\nThreat Assessments\n\nAsserting any semblance of a unitary male tribalism is a direct threat to the Feminine Imperative.\n\nNothing is more threatening yet simultaneously attractive to a woman than a man who is aware of his own value to women.\n\nThat quote is from a section called The Threat in my first book, The Rational Male. When I wrote this essay I did so from the perspective of women feeling vulnerable about interacting intimately with men who understood their own value to women, but also understood how to leverage it. One of the reasons Game is so vilified, ridiculed and disqualified by the Sisterhood is because it puts this understanding and awareness into practice with women and, in theory, removes some degree of control from women in the optimization of Hypergamy. Red Pill awareness and Game lessens women’s control in that equation and makes intersexual dynamics adversarial. Men who just get it is sexy from the standpoint of dealing with a self-aware, high SMV man, but also threatening from the perspective that her long-term security depends on him acquiescing to her Frame and control. Women are conditioned to expect men to be ridiculous, untrustworthy and lacking any capacity to provide them with the long-term security they need, so it follows that the Sisterhood would balk at the idea of men coming into an awareness of their value to women and using it on his terms.\n\nUp to this point, Game has represented an individualized threat to women’s Hypergamous control, but there has always been a larger majority of men (Betas) who’ve been easily kept ignorant of their true potential for control. However, on a larger social landscape, the Feminine Imperative understands the risks involved in men forming a unitary tribe — a Brotherhood — based solely on benefiting and empowering men. The manosphere, while still effectively a collection of sub-tribes, represents a threat to the imperative because its base purpose is making men aware of their true state in a feminine-centric social order.\n\nAs such, any attempt to create exclusively male-specific, male-empowering organizations (such as the Men’s Rights Movement) is made socially synonymous with either misogyny (hate) or homosexuality (shame). Ironically, the shame associated with homosexuality, that a fem-centric society would otherwise rail against, becomes an effective form of intra-gender shame when it’s applied to heterosexual collectives of men. Even suggestions of male-centered tribalism are attached with homosexual suspicions, and these come from within the collectives of men themselves.\n\nThis picture is from an “academic” conference (class?) called Mediated Feminisms: Activism and Resistance to Gender and Sexual Violence in the Digital Age held at UCL in London. There’s quite a bit more to this than just collecting and codifying the sub-tribes of the manosphere.\n\nNow, granted, this conference was replete with all of the uninformed (not to mention willfully ignorant) concern to be expected of contemporary feminists, but this does serve as an example of how men organizing for the exclusive benefit of men is not just equated with misogyny, but potential violence. As a unitary collective of men, a growing manosphere terrifies the Feminine Imperative. That fear, however, doesn’t stem from any real prospect of violence, but the potential for a larger ’awareness’ in men of their own conditions and the roles they are expected to play to perpetuate a feminine-centric social order. They fear to lose the control that the ’socially responsible’ ignorance of men provides them with.\n\nMen’s predisposition to form sub-tribes and intrasexual competition (“lets you and him fight”) have always been a means of covert control by women, but even still the Feminine Imperative must insert its influence and oversight into those male spaces to make use of them. Thus, by assuring that feminine primacy is equated with the idea of inclusive equalism, all Male Space is effectively required to be “unisex space” while all-female sub-tribes must remain exclusively female. For an easy example of this, compare and contrast the reactions to Harvard’s unisex institution of campus club equalism I mentioned earlier to the worldwide reactions to, and preemption of, the “Tribe” meetings only just attempted to be organized by Roosh in February, 2016.\n\nMaking Men\n\nBy controlling men’s intrasexual communications with each other the Feminine Imperative can limit men’s unified, collective, understanding of masculinity and male experiences. Feminine-primary society hates, and is terrified of, men defining and asserting masculinity for themselves (to the point of typifying it as “toxic”), but as connectivity progresses we will see a more concentrated effort to lock down the narrative and the means of men communicating male experiences.\n\nI’ve detailed in many essays how the imperative has deliberately misdirected and confused men about a unified definition of masculinity. That confusion is designed to keep men guessing and doubting about their “security in their manhood” while asserting that the feminine-correct definition is the only legitimate definition of healthy, ’non-toxic’, masculinity. This deliberate obfuscation and ambiguity about what amounts to ’authentic masculinity’ is another means of controlling men’s awareness of their true masculine potential. This potential they rightly fear will mean deferring to men’s power over their Hypergamous social and personal control. Anything less than a definition of masculinity that fosters female primacy and ’fempowerment’ is labeled “toxic masculinity” — literally and figuratively, poisonous.\n\nThis is the operative reason behind the obsessive, often self-contradicting, need for control of traditionally male spaces by the Feminine Imperative. Oversight and infiltration of male sub-tribes and instituting a culture of men who will self-police the narrative within those sub-tribes maintains a feminine-primary social order.\n\nBuilding Better Betas\n\nSince the time in which western(izing) societies shifted to unfettered Hypergamy on a social scale there have been various efforts to de-masculinize — if not outright feminize — the larger majority of men. Today we’re seeing the results, and still persistent efforts, of this in much starker contrast as transgenderism and the social embrace of foisting gender-loathing on boys becomes institutionalized. A deliberate promotion of a social constructionist narrative about gender identity and the very early age at which children can “choose” a gender for themselves is beginning to be more and more reinforced in our present feminine-primary social order.\n\nAs a result of this, and likely into our near future, today’s men are conditioned to feel uncomfortable being “men”. That discomfort is a direct result of the ambiguity and misguidance about conventional masculinity the imperative has fostered in men when they were boys. This feminization creates a gender loathing, but that loathing comes as the result of an internal conflict between the feminine-correct, “non-toxic”, understanding of what masculinity ought to be and the conventional aspects of masculinity that men need to express as a result of their biology and birthright.\n\nEffectively, this confusion has the purpose of creating discomfort in men among all-male sub-tribes. These masculine-confused men have difficulty with intersocial communication within the male sub-tribes they’re supposed to have some sort of kin or in-group affiliation with. Even the concept of “male bonding” has become a point of ridicule (something typical of male buffoons) or something suspiciously homosexual. Thus, combined with the feminine identification most of these men default to, today’s “mangina” typically has more female friends and feels more comfortable communicating as women communicate. These men have been effectively conditioned to believe or feel that uniquely male interaction or organization is inherently wrong. It feels uncomfortable or contrived, possibly even threatening if the organizing requires physical effort. Consequently, interacting ’as a male’ becomes ridiculous or superficial. For the past 60 years of social feminization, all-male connection has been effectively suppressed.\n\nPushing Back\n\nWhat then is to be done about this conditioning? For all the efforts to destroy or regulate male tribalism, the Feminine Imperative still runs up against men’s evolved predispositions to interact with the extrinsic world instead of fixating on the intrinsic world of women. I’ve pieced together some actionable ideas here that might help men come to a better, unitary, way of fostering a male tribalism the Feminine Imperative would see destroyed or used as a tool of socio-sexual control:\n\n· While it is vitally important to maintain a male-specific mental point of origin, together men need a center point of action. Women talk, men do.\n\nMen need a common purpose in which the tribe can focus its efforts on. Men need to build, coordinate, win, compete and problem solve amongst themselves. The ’purpose’ of a tribe can’t simply be one of getting together as like-minded men; in fact, groups with such a declared purpose are often designed to be the most conciliatory and accommodating of the Feminine Imperative. Men require a common, passionate purpose to unite for.\n\n· Understand and accept that men will naturally form male hierarchies in virtually every context if that tribe is truly male-exclusive. There will be a reflexive resistance to this, but understand that the discomfort in acknowledging male hierarchies stems from the Feminine Imperative’s want to make any semblance of male authority a toxic form of masculinity. Contrary to feminine conditioning male hierarchies are not necessarily based on Dark Triad manipulations. That is the ’fem-think’ — any male created hierarchy of authority is by definition evil Patriarchy.\n\n· Recognize existing male sub-tribes for what they are, but do so without labeling them as such. Don’t talk about Fight Club, do Fight Club. As with most other aspects of Red Pill aware Game, it is always better to demonstrate rather than explicate. There will always be an observer effect in place when you call a male group a “male group”. That tribe must exist for a mutual goal other than the expressed idea that it exists to be about men meeting up. Every sub-tribe I belong to, every collective interest I share with other men, even the instantly forming ones that arise from an immediate common need or function, all exist apart from “being” about men coming together. Worldwide “tribe” day failed much for the same reasons an organization like the Good Men Project fails — they are publicized as a gathering of men just “being” men.\n\n· Push back on women’s invasion of male space by being uncompromising in what you do and organize with passion. Make no concessions for women in any all-male space you create or join. There will always be a want to accommodate women and/or the fear of not being accommodating of feminine-primary mindsets within that all-male purview. Often this will come in subtle forms of anonymous White Knighting or reservations about particular passions due to other men’s Blue Pill conditioning to always consider the feminine before considerations of themselves or the tribe. It is vitally important to the tribe to quash those sympathies and compromising attitudes as these are exactly the designs of the Feminine Imperative to destroy a tribe from within. Make no concessions for competency of women within the tribe if you find yourself in a unisex tribal situation. Even the U.S. military is guilty of reducing combat service requirements for women as recently as the time of this writing. If you are a father or you find yourself in a role of mentoring boys or young men, it is imperative that you instill this no-compromise attitude in them and the organizations that they create themselves.\n\n· The primary Red Pill awareness and Game tenets that you’ve learned with respect to women are entirely applicable in a larger scope when it comes to resisting the influences of the Feminine Imperative. Frame control and a return to a collectively male-exclusive Mental Point of Origin are two of the primary tenets to apply to non-intimate applications of resistance. Objective observations and an internalized Red Pill perspective should inform your interactions with women and men on a social scale.\n\nMy approach to resisting the influences of the Feminine Imperative on a meta social scale is the same bottom-up approach I would use with unplugging men from their Blue Pill conditioning. Once men have taken the first steps in Red Pill awareness this new perspective has a tendency to expand into greater social understandings and a want for applications that go beyond hooking up with desirable women. Red Pill awareness becomes a way of life, but moreover, it should inform us as men, as tribes, about how best to maintain ourselves as masculine-primary individuals and organizations.\n\nIndividually men are competitive. It’s part of our survival instinct to desire to win. Studies prove we get a rush of testosterone when we are the victors over some adversary or adversity — a fact that coincides with women’s sensitivity to, and arousal for the winners. However, we are also cooperative in our victories. Men banding together to overcome adversity or to create magnificent achievements of humanity are also characteristic of conventional masculinity.\n\nAs the social influences of feminine-primacy has spread over the last 60 years the effort to separate and isolate men from this conventional cooperation has become more and more evident. There’s no shortage of concerned bloggers lamenting the ’drop out’ generation of young men who’ve become so disenfranchised from conventional masculinity that they content themselves with video games and online porn. What they fail to consider is that these young men have been deliberately isolated in order to contain their masculine potentials. As a result these young men have no male-only purpose or endeavor to apply themselves to. With a lack of purpose comes a lack of male communication and engagement, and with that comes the atrophy of understanding masculine ways of interacting with each other.\n\nRites of Passage\n\nIn the past I’ve discussed the hesitancy of young men to refer to themselves as ’men’ or to really even embrace what might be considered a ’conventional’ idea of masculinity. You’ve probably read me using that word before. I use the word conventional because I feel it conveys a better understanding of a naturalized expression of masculinity in a way that men evolved into. Occasionally I have a reader ask me why I don’t use the term ’traditional’ with respect to masculinity, but I’m not sure they really mean the same thing.\n\nIt’s easy to think of masculinity in terms of tradition, but whose tradition are we really referring to? ’Traditional Masculinity’ as a term has assumed a derogatory meaning in a feminine-primary social order. It’s become one of those catchterms that we’re all supposed to understand as being characteristic of backward mindsets. It’s part of the social convention that seeks to ridicule, shame and confuse boys who later become men about what masculinity ought to mean to them. So, it’s for this reason I use the word ’conventional’. It conveys the idea that masculinity in a binary sense has evolved aspects that are inherent and unique to men. So while certain cultures may have had different traditions and traditional roles for men, there is a unifying conventionality of masculinity that relates to all men and maleness in general.\n\nFeminine-centrism doesn’t like this idea. It doesn’t like the idea that masculine characteristics or behaviors are the sole propriety of men. The reflex then is to paint any conventionally masculine attribute, way of thinking, aggression, passion or aspiration as either representative of ’toxic’ harmful or anti-social, or, depending on its usefulness in securing power, it’s cast as something “not necessarily masculine” (i.e. strength) since some women can lay claim to that trait.\n\nI’ve outlined before how boys are taught from a very early age to gender-loathe their maleness. It’s part of Blue Pill conditioning, but more so, I think it’s important for Blue Pill or unplugging adult men to understand the mechanics and reasoning behind why it’s in the Feminine Imperative’s interests to keep conventional masculinity something ambiguous, arbitrary or something men ought to be able to fluidly define for themselves. That last part there is important, because what most men of today think is their own self-generated definition of masculinity is generally founded in what the Feminine Imperative has conditioned him to believe is healthy and correct.\n\nLatent Purposes\n\nIn a social order that’s ostensibly founded upon a baseline equalism (in principle) among men and women we have to look at why it might be necessary for boys to be taught that ’traditional’ masculinity is toxic. The easy answer is that it stems from a want for control, but not so much in the terms of convincing boys to become men who will loathe their maleness. Remember, there are many aspects of conventional masculinity that are conveniently useful to further the interests of women and Hypergamy — but the conditioning becomes one of selectively classifying the useful aspects as ’healthy’ and the non-useful ones as ’toxic’.\n\nThe most important thing to consider here is that, for future men, egalitarian equalism’s (the Village’s) purpose in boy’s upbringing is to prevent them from ever internalizing the idea that they should be their own mental point of origin. This, I think, is one of the fundamental issues most Blue Pill men struggle with in their own unplugging; unlearning the deeply embedded idea that his wellbeing must always come after that of women’s.\n\nOne of the Old Books, traditional, understandings is that men, by virtue of being male, can expect a degree of authority in their lives and in their families. A man may not be the boss at work, but the traditional understanding was that he could expect to be the head-of-household in his own home. Feminine primacy, under the auspices of equalism, has effectively conditioned this idea out of men over the course of generations. If men and women are blank-slate functional equals, ideally, there will never be a default authority in an intersexual relationship.\n\nFrom a conventional, evolutionary perspective we know this baseline equalism is not just false, but we also understand that it serves as a control over the masculine nature men are born into. Men and women are different; cognitively, neurologically, biologically and psychologically, but our feminine-socialized presumptions with regard to how boys are raised to be men deliberately conditions them to believe we are the same — or at least functionally so.\n\nThe Crime of Being Male\n\nThere’s been some push-back to this in our Red Pill awakening, and not all of it is the result of the manosphere. As Hypergamy becomes more openly embraced in a larger social respect, more men are made aware of their deliberate conditioning to accommodate it. What men choose to do with that awareness is up to them, but the response from the Feminine Imperative to this awareness is to criminalize or make ’toxic’ the embrace of conventional masculinity on the part of men. It becomes a hate-crime to express any conventionally male attribute, but moreover it’s a hate-crime to foster those attributes in boys/men.\n\nThis is a potential danger for Blue Pill men in that the expressions of maleness that they display are on one hand desired by women, but also a risk to their reputation or livelihoods if that expression is offensive to womankind. Red Pill aware men may have the advantage of knowing women’s nature well enough to mitigate the risks, but Blue Pill men will be stuck in a paradigm that puts them at risk for wanting to be conventionally masculine men.\n\nAgain, equalist Blue Pill conditioning’s purpose is to prevent men from assuming themselves as their mental point of origin, but once a man’s disabused himself from putting the feminine as his primary internal concern there must be an opposite, contingent, reaction on the part of the Feminine Imperative to put him back into compliance. Thus, we see the criminalization of maleness.\n\nPedestals\n\nFor some time it’s been a manosphere staple to tell guys to take the girl off the pedestal if he wants to be successful with women. We call it pedestalization, but one reason that dynamic, to put a woman on a higher order than oneself, is so pervasive among men is due exactly to this “equalist” conditioning. The internalization is one of making that girl, that woman, that mother, that female boss, the centerpiece of a man’s headspace. This becomes who he is and it’s the result of a childhood that taught him he must place the concerns of girls above his own on many different psychological levels. Ostensibly this is sold to men as being ’honorable’ in putting others before himself, however the latent purpose of ’being a good servant’ has been bastardized by the Feminine Imperative to be defined as being ’supportive’ of women. And men are to be supportive of women’s interests at the risk of being considered a misogynist.\n\nOnce that guy becomes Red Pill aware, no matter who does his unplugging, not only does he remove girls from the pedestal personally, but also in a larger, sociological scope. And this scope is what the Feminine Imperative must pushback against.\n\nBlue Pill conditioning teaches boys/men to cast doubt on their own masculinity. What constitutes masculinity? Is it a mask or a performance they put on? Is it something to be proud of, or some problem/privilege to keep in check? Should boys/men feel insecure or secure about it? These are the consistent ambiguities the Feminine Imperative wants to invest into the next generations of men because it keeps women on the pedestal. In this social paradigm only women possess the solution to men’s problem of maleness.\n\nBut the Blue Pill also conditions boys/men to never presume to consider themselves as a “man”. The joke is that men are never really men, but rather they become ’bigger boys’. This is a social convention that attempts to keep men in a juvenilized state and thus ensuring women are the only ’adults’ to make the judgment call. This ridicule has the purpose of denying men their status of ’manhood’. If men are perpetual boys, they can never assume the default ’headship’ of being men. It is a control for authority.\n\nThis is another reason men are conditioned to keep women on the pedestal; only women can confirm ’manhood’ from a superior (mental) position in that man’s mind. When a woman is at the top of a man’s mental point of origin — and not even a specific woman, but womankind — she decides and confers his status of being a man. So it follows that men ought to be raised to internalize the doubt of understanding manhood or conventional masculinity.\n\nThe struggle men have in coming to a Red Pill awareness is one of removing women from this pedestal, but also one of giving oneself permission to be a man. This may seem kind of simplistic, but to a guy who’s been conditioned to put women before himself in his own internal, mental, conversations it’s a very tough challenge. Blue Pill conditioning invests a doubt into boys and then men. They are conditioned to self-regulate on many levels, but to generally put their own concerns beneath those of others and largely the feminine. They are taught to self-sublimate by never giving themselves permission to be “men” in a conventional sense.\n\nIron Rule of Tomassi #9\n\nNever Self-Deprecate under any circumstance. This is a Kiss of Death that you self-initiate and is the antithesis of the Prize Mentality. Once you’ve accepted yourself and presented yourself as a “complete douche” there’s no going back to confidence with a woman. Never appeal to a woman’s sympathies. Her sympathies are given by her own volition, never when they are begged for — women despise the obligation of sympathy. Nothing kills arousal like pity. Even if you don’t seriously consider yourself pathetic, it never serves your best interest to paint yourself as pathetic. Self-Depreciation is a misguided tool for the AFC, and not something that would even occur to an Alpha mindset.\n\nOne important reason I made this an Iron Rule (see The Rational Male) was because it is almost a default response of men to presume the validity of their own ridiculousness. The reflexive response is, of course, “not to take yourself so seriously” and have an ability to laugh at yourself when it’s merited. That’s all fine and well, a necessity for a healthy sense of self, but few men realize their ease with self-deprecation is a result of their conditioning to find themselves ridiculous as men. The concept of “Men” is associated with “ridiculous”.\n\nIt’s very easy for Red Pill aware men to lose sight of what the Blue Pill conditions men for and how this conditioning has evolved over the course of generations. The latent purpose remains the same (preventing men from adopting their own mental point of origin), but the methods and social mores change fluidly with what the Feminine Imperative finds most efficient for the time. For the past 20 years there’s been a concentrated effort to remove men from deciding their own manhood for themselves.\n\nRemove the Man\n\nIn 2013, Washington state Governor Jay Inslee signed off on the final installment of a six-year effort to make language in the state’s copious laws gender-neutral. The sponsor of the bill, Senator Jeannie Kohl-Welles’ reasoning for initiating the six-year endeavor was,\n\n“It brings us to modern times, to contemporary times, why should we have in statute anything that could be viewed as biased or stereotypical or reflecting any discrimination?”\n\nThus, words such as ’freshmen’, ’fireman’, ’fisherman’ and even ’penmanship’ are neutralized to ’first year student’, ’fire-person’, ’fisher’ and ’writing skill’. Perhaps the easiest way to grasp the process the committee used in their six-year effort is to presume that any noun or verb with the successive letters of ’m-a-n’ in its syntax was replaced with ’person’ or a substitution for a term that excluded the offending ’m-a-n’ letters.\n\nThis hasn’t been the only effort to geld the English language under the guise of a want for avoiding legal repercussions. The University of North Carolina has initiated a similar effort in their school’s by-laws. Kent Law, Marquette and virtually every state college in the union, while not mandating the ’manless’ language, has made efforts to encourage linguistic androgyny.\n\nThe Washington state initiative is really just the next predictable progression in this gelding, however the six-year effort represents something more endemically hostile; the Feminine Imperative, in its inconsolable insecurity, would re-engineer the very language society uses in order to feel more secure.\n\nNow granted, this is English, the second most commonly spoken language in the world, but in order to fully appreciate the scope of the Feminine Imperative and the lengths to which it will go unhindered to assuage the need for feminine-security, a Red Pill man has to recognize the importance language represents to the human race as well as the removal of male, not masculine, influence from that language.\n\nIn all Latin-based languages there are gender associations with definitive articles. Nouns (and many adjectives) are specifically feminine or masculine as part of their intrinsic qualities. In Spanish ’La Casa’, the home, is a feminine association. ’El Toro’, the bull, is a masculine association. Anyone with even a rudimentary grasp of a Latin-based language understands that millennia ago the Latin culture found gender differentiation so important that it attached gender associations to the words, written and spoken, that represented the ideas and articles each word meant.\n\nThis might seem like a remedial review of language and society, but it’s important to understand what it is the Feminine Imperative hopes to undo, and the magnitude of its insecurities. The six-year effort of gender-abridgment in the Washington state law is really an illustration of the lengths to which the Feminine Imperative would re-engineer society; from the very foundations of human communication, language, by eliminating masculine associations with any article or quality. The Feminine Imperative, that is dependent upon men being Men when convenient, simultaneously makes herculean efforts to remove men from its idealized environment and society.\n\n“But if thought can corrupt language, language can also corrupt thought. Bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation,even among people who should and do know better.” — George Orwell\n\nBe a Man\n\nThere used to be a time when some cultures had a rite of passage into manhood or a passing into adult responsibility and masculine respect. In Latin cultures a young woman becomes a woman on here quinceñera — her fifteenth birthday. Jewish boys have a Bar Mitzvah, certain Native American tribes had similar traditions, etc. I think that if there’s a modern social complaint about men remaining perpetually juvenile this is the root of it — we don’t respect Manhood enough to define what’s expected and when that adult, masculine respect is due.\n\nA lot has been written on my blog and many others about the ceaseless efforts of the feminine to marginalize and ridicule anything masculine. It’s easy to find consistent examples of this in the past 50 years of popular media, movies, TV sitcoms, music, etc. While masculinity is ridiculed, there’s more to it than this. It’s not simple masculine ridicule, because the same masculine attributes and qualities that make women ’strong’ are the same that make men strong. The difference is in the application — it wasn’t enough to implant the seeds of masculine self-doubt into men, the Feminine Imperative had to make men, not necessarily masculinity, the problem to be solved.\n\nIn all of the examples of masculine gender reversal in popular culture, men are the unique problem, to which only women have the resources, wisdom and intuition to correct. The men of today are characterized as the Lucy Ricardos of the 50’s, requiring women’s guidance to avoid, often mutually destructive, disasters. However, the key to solving those problems, characterized as uniquely male, still require masculine-associated, mindsets, skills and applications.\n\nGuys vs. Men\n\nI was participating in a conversation with a young woman of 26 and a young man of 18. The conversation itself wasn’t important, but at one point the young man referred to himself as a ’Man’. He said something to the effect of, “Well I’m a man, and men do,..” At the word ’man’ she cut him off with the unconscious snigger that’s resulted from years of feminine ridicule conditioning. Just the mention of a man self-referencing as a “man” is enough to inspire feminine ridicule. It’s laughable for a man to consider himself a man.\n\nThis exchange got me to wondering about the turning point at which I began to self-reference as a “Man”. In the face of a constant conditioned ridicule, it’s almost an uncomfortable recognition to distinguish yourself as a Man. It’s too easy to just think of yourself as a ’guy’ and never be so presumptuous as to insist upon your manhood. In girl-world, to claim to be a Man is to accept one’s own arrogance — it’s to embrace a flawed nature.\n\nIt’s important to note here that in embracing your status as a Man, instead of ’just a guy’, you are passing a meta-shit test. By embracing self-referenced manhood, you are rejecting what a world aligned against you would like you to believe about yourself. You’re endorsing yourself as a Man with self-assurance despite the self-doubt the Feminine Imperative relies upon men believing about themselves — masculinity and the dubious state of manhood as a whole.\n\nBy flagrantly referring to yourself as a Man you are passing the meta-shit test, you’re overtly declaring you’re a Man, but you you’re covertly stating “I Just Get It.”\n\nThe Man Removed\n\nThe Feminine Imperative perceives your Manhood as a Threat. By endorsing yourself as a Man, on some level, whether you’re cognizant of it or not, you’re alluding that you have an inkling of your own personal value as a Man. You’re expressing a self-awareness that is attractive and terrorizing for women, but due to the constant influence of feminine primacy you’re perceived as arrogant, self-serving and prideful. Even in the most innocuous context, insisting upon your status as a Man is inherently sexist to a world defined by the Feminine Imperative.\n\nBut the imperative needs masculinity. To insure its (temporary) satisfaction of security a masculine element is required. Strength, confidence, determination, a capacity for risk taking, dominance and the comfort in security that women naturally derive from those masculine attributes are necessities of a healthy, secure, existence for women and the feminine. However, brutish, ridiculous and stupid men can’t be trusted to universally provide this masculine security that every woman has been taught she deserves irrespective of attractiveness or merit by the Feminine Imperative. So Men must be removed from masculinity.\n\nNo longer are Men allowed a monopoly on masculinity. Domineering, “Alpha Women” as a default status in heterosexual relationships pushes masculinity into her domain. Dominant masculine partners in Sexually Fluid lesbian relationships are similarly, unironically, re-characterized.\n\nThese are the easy examples. Volumes have been written in the Manosphere about how feminine-primary government assumes the masculine providership role in modern relationships, thus freeing an already unhindered Hypergamy even more so, but the effort to remove the Man goes far beyond this obvious institution. The fundamental restructuring of gender reference in our very language — in the way we are to communicate appropriate thoughts — attempts to, literally, remove the Man from the equation.\n\nMasculine Security\n\nI can remember an instance at a former workplace where some coworkers were organizing a team to run in a Breast Cancer awareness walk/run. At one point a particularly ’mangina’ coworker suggested we all wear the prerequisite pink color at the event, and needless to say I arrived in a black T-Shirt amongst a sea of pink. The predictable accusation of my sexual security came up: “What, aren’t you secure enough in your manhood to wear pink?” to which I answered “I’m secure enough in my Manhood not to wear pink.”\n\nWhat the guy was obliviously parroting back is the same social tool that’s been used by the Feminine Imperative for the past 60 years; inspire self-doubt in male-specific masculinity. By making compliance with the Feminine Imperative a qualification of masculinity, men assign the power to define masculinity to the Feminine Imperative. My answer to him was simply taking that power of definition back into a male-controlled frame — “I’ll tell you what manhood is, your conditioned grasp of manhood doesn’t qualify you to tell me.”\n\nThis power of defining the masculine isn’t limited just to snarky, subconscious referencing; it’s simply one aspect of a greater effort to remove men from masculinity. While the efforts of certain women bloggers and psychologists (both within and without the Manosphere) to build better betas seems ennobling to White Knights, the unifying purpose behind their efforts is really one of apportioning masculine authority to men in as convenient a way as would satisfy their immediate needs for those masculine aspects. Be Alpha as needed, but Beta for the greater part so as to allow for feminine-masculine dominance and primacy.\n\nI’ve explained this previously as the Male Catch 22 in my first book (The Honor System), but it’s important to understand that this Catch isn’t some unfortunate byproduct of male inheritance; it’s a careful, calculated feminine social dynamic with the latent purpose of making men accountable for masculine responsibilities while simultaneously making them shamed and guilty of ’male privilege’ when that masculinity conflicts with the dictates of the Feminine Imperative. That’s the crux of the dynamic, but the mechanics of it are still rooted in specifically male masculine self-doubt.\n\nFor the Feminine Imperative to sustain itself men can never be trusted with masculinity. Solution: remove men from being the definers of masculinity and apportion them only enough authority of it that would benefit the Feminine Imperative as necessary.\n\nRites of Passage\n\nOne of the key elements to unplugging is changing your mind about yourself. This is one of the biggest obstacle to guys coming to accept a Red Pill aware reality. This self-denial of their own ’manhood’, which becomes a resistance to embracing anything conventionally masculine as being positive, is a foreign thought.\n\nThere used to be a time when boys would go through some rite of passage and be considered a ’man’ by his family and peers. It’s important for Red Pill men to realize how this passage into a state of manhood has been deliberately confused or shamed out of significance to all but the most traditional of cultures.\n\nMost male rites of passage are painted as cruel and barbaric hazing rituals in a fem-centric society. That’s a popularized and easy connection to make, but what underlies this effort to disqualify manhood as legitimate is a push to force men into compliance with the Feminine Imperative and feminine-primacy.\n\nI would suggest that men coming into a Red Pill awareness need to embrace being a “man”. Red Pill men need a rite of passage of some sort. In the Manosphere we sometimes ask about when a guy finally came into his Red Pill awareness. We compare stories about what we were like when we were still living in a Blue Pill paradigm and then what form of trauma (or not) triggered that Blue Pill disillusionment. We discuss the various stages of grief for our past Blue Pill idealism, the nihilism, the anger, the disbelief, then the acceptance and the new enthusiasm of being Red Pill aware and the potential it proposes.\n\nBut there needs to be a rite of passage for passing from that Blue Pill state to a new Red Pill awareness and part of this should be a conscious acknowledgment of giving yourself permission to be a man. This needs to be part of changing your mind about yourself as you become more aware of the agency you have in a conventionally male respect. You need a baptism of sorts; a point at which you set yourself apart from Blue Pill men and a feminine-primary social order.\n\nMost (Beta) guys have a difficult time embracing the authority and due deference that being a conventional man conveys to him. They’re uncomfortable on an ego-personality level with accepting this dominant male role because it goes against everything their feminine-centric upbringing has taught them.\n\nHowever, with that authority comes responsibility. I would argue that many a Blue Pill guy is comforted by the lies of equalism because he believes that egalitarianism and the expectations that men and women are functional equals in some way exempts him from his uniquely male burden of performance. On some level of consciousness, even the Beta men who are comforted by equalism still realize that their maleness will only ever be merited and judged by his performance. And that performance is firmly grounded in conventionally male tests.\n\nThe Second Set of Books\n\nOne of the cornerstones of Red Pill truth lies in men coming to terms with what amounts to (in most cases) half a lifetime of feminine conditioning. It’s interesting to consider that there was a time (pre-Sexual Revolution) when a man wasn’t in someway socialized and acculturated in his upbringing to give deference to the feminine or to become more feminine-identifying. There are plenty of other manosphere bloggers who’ll run down in detail all of the many ways boys are now raised and educated to be what a feminine-primary world would like them to be, but at the heart of it is a presumption that boys should be raised and conditioned to be more like girls; conditioned from their earliest memories to be better providers for what women believe they will eventually want them to be as adult ’men’.\n\nFor men who’ve become aware of this conditioning through some trauma or personal crisis that prompted him to seek answers for his condition, we call this period our Blue Pill days. I think it’s important to make a distinction about this time — whether or not a man is Alpha or Beta doesn’t necessarily exclude him from the consequences of a Blue Pill conditioning. That isn’t to say that a more natural Alpha Man can’t see the world in a Red Pill perspective by his own means, but rather that his feminine-primary upbringing doesn’t necessarily make a man Alpha or Beta.\n\nI’m making this distinction because there is school of thought that being Blue Pill (unaware of one’s conditioning) necessitates him being more Beta. To be sure, feminine-primary conditioning would raise a boy into a more feminine-pliable man — ready to serve as the good Beta provider when a woman’s sexual market value declines and she’s less able to compete with her younger sexual competitors.\n\nHowever, there also exist more Alpha Men conditioned to be servants of the\n\nFeminine Imperative. These men make for some of the most self-evincing White Knights you’ll ever meet and are usually the first men to “defend the honor” of the feminine and women for whom they lack a real awareness of. Binary absolutism and an upbringing steeped in feminization makes for a potent sense of self-righteousness. Blue pill Alphas live for the opportunity to defend everything their conditioning has taught them. To the Blue Pill Alpha, all women are victims by default, all women share a common historic suffering and any man (a White Knight’s sexual competitors) critical of the feminine are simply an opportunity to prove his worth to any woman in earshot he believes might at all find his zealousness for feminine identification attractive.\n\nThe Second Set of Books\n\nOn June 15th, 2011, a man by the name of Thomas Ball set himself on fire in front of Cheshire Superior Court in New Hampshire after a particularly ugly divorce proceeding. Prior to his suicide, Ball left a lengthy manifesto outlining his disillusionment with the government process, but more importantly it outlined his eyes being opened to a great deal of the more discomforting aspects of Red Pill awareness. I’d encourage readers to look up his last testament online. Unfortunately, Ball’s manifesto is a bit too long to include in its entirety here, but I will quote the operative point here:\n\nAny one swept up into this legal mess is usually astonished at what they see. They cannot believe what the police, prosecutors and judges are doing. It is so blatantly wrong. Well, I can assure you that everything they do is logical and by the book. The confusion you have with them is you both are using different sets of books. You are using the old First Set of Books - the Constitution, the general laws or statutes and the court ruling sometime call Common Law. They are using the newer Second Set of Books. That is the collection of the policy, procedures and protocols. Once you know what set of books everyone is using, then everything they do looks logical and upright. And do not bother trying to argue with me that there is no Second Set of Books. I have my own copies at home. Or at least a good hunk of the important part of it.\n\nWhile I strongly disagree with his decision to self-immolate, I do understand his sentiment. I’ve had many a Red Pill critic attempt to call me to the carpet over how a man might come to the conclusion of suicide or murder once he’d become confronted with a total loss of all his personal and emotional investment in life:\n\nBut Rollo, you just justified murder as “logical”, by illustrating that insecurity is the prime motivator for this man’s life. The decision may have be understandable in an empathetic sense, and he might have seen it as logical at the time, but there is nothing logical about it. You are making extreme beta-ism seem more and more like a mental disorder.\n\nJust for the record, I’ve argued in the past that ONEitis, or a life founded on the idea of the Soul-Mate Myth, however extreme, is in fact a mental disorder.\n\nHowever, I haven’t justified anything, murder or suicide, I’ve simply outlined the deductive process men use when confronting the actualized loss of their most important investment (or perceptually so) in life. They are convinced and conditioned to believe that women are playing by a set of rules, and will honor the terms of those rules; but only after ego-investing themselves for a lifetime in the correctness and appropriateness of those rules do they discover women are playing by another set of rules. They then wonder at how stupid they could’ve been to have ever believed in the rules they were conditioned to expect everyone would abide by. When critics label Red Pill men as characteristically ’angry’ or bitter, this is the source of that sentiment — their anger isn’t directed at women, but rather themselves for having been so blind.\n\nSuicide or murder certainly is a deductive and pragmatic end for some men, but by no means is it justified nor would I advocate for it. Thomas Ball, for all of his due diligence in uncovering the ugly processes of the American divorce industry, was far more useful alive than dead in some symbolic suicide. Now, in passing, he wasn’t the martyr he probably expected he’d be, he’s just another footnote. A casualty of the Feminine Imperative.\n\nFor all of that, Thomas Ball and his last message to humanity serves as an excellent illustration of a man coming to terms with his own conditioning. In his message Ball makes a very important observation about his legal ordeals. He comes to understand that there are two sets of books rather than the one he’d been led to believe that everyone understood as ’the rules’ everyone should play by.\n\nBall was largely making a political statement in his account of going through the legal system and the cruel education he got in the process, but when men transition from their comfortable Blue Pill perspective into the harsh reality that the Red Pill represents, the experience is a lot like Ball discovering that the set of books (the set of rules) he’d believed everyone was using wasn’t so. Likewise, men who’ve been conditioned since birth to believe that women were using a common set of rules — a set where certain expectations and mutual exchange were understood — were in fact using their own set. Furthermore, these men ’just didn’t get it’ that they should’ve known all along that women, as well as men’s feminization conditioning, were founded in a second set of books.\n\nIn my estimate, that first set of books — the Old Books — represents the social contract of an era before the Sexual Revolution. It was an old set of rules men were taught they could expect women and other men would honor in exchange for accepting a burden of performance that was itself an extension of those rules. The second set of books, the new set, represent the true rules a man is playing by whether he’s aware of it or not. These are the post-Sexual Revolution rules that serve the Feminine Imperative and unfettered Hypergamy; the rules that are extensions of the social re-engineering necessary for a feminine-primary social order.\n\nComing to terms with this separation of rule sets is an integral part of a man’s unplugging himself and becoming Red Pill aware. Men are expected to abide by the second set of books, while still being held accountable for the liabilities of the first set. Much of men’s disillusionment with notions of Chivalry comes from this serving of two masters. The old social contracts are an anachronism, but men are still taught to respect them while at the same time are persecuted according to the second set of books if they step over a line they may not ever be aware of.\n\nThis is a difficult lesson for young men to learn and then disabuse themselves of before they’ve invested their most productive years into what their Blue Pill conditioning has convinced them they can expect from life and women. However, when a mature man, who’s based the better part of his life, and invested his future, into the hope in the first set of books is disenfranchised by the second set of books, that’s when all of the equity he believed he’d established under the first set of books counts for nothing. Literally his life (up to that point) counted for nothing. This is the foundation of what I termed the Fallacy of Relational Equity in my first book.\n\nWhen a man is faced with the prospect of rebuilding himself after living so long under false pretenses, after having all he believed he was building turn up to be a lifetime of wasted effort, he’s faced with two real options; recreate himself or destroy himself. Needless to say suicide statistics among men (5:1 over women) are a strong indication that the majority of men (Betas) more commonly don’t have the personal strength to recreate themselves. Thomas Ball didn’t.\n\nThere’s usually a lot of disillusionment that comes with making the transition to Red Pill awareness. Guys get upset that what they now see was really there all along, but it’s not so much the harshness of seeing Red Pill dynamics in women or a feminized society play out with such predictability, it’s the loss of investment that causes the real sense of nihilism.\n\nThe overarching reason most men experienced what they called a righteous anger, isn’t directed at how the second set of books had been directing their lives behind the scenes for so long, but rather it was anger at having invested so much of themselves in the first set of books and losing that very long term investment.\n\nThe good news is you can rebuild yourself. A lot gets written about how nihilistic the Red Pill is, but this is due to a lack of understanding that you can recreate yourself for the positive with the knowledge of both sets of rules. One common thread I see come up often on the Red Pill Reddit forum is how Game-awareness has completely destroyed a guy’s world view. I get it, I realize it’s a hard realization, but their depression is only for a lack of understanding that they can become even better in this new understanding than they were in their Blue Pill ignorance.\n\nA foundation of internalizing a new definition of positive masculinity for yourself begins in coming to terms with the reality of your situation. And this is in respect to how these conflicting sets of rules have influenced the course of your life up to this point. Rebuilding sucks. I’ve done it enough times myself to feel exactly this sense of loss at many points in my life. And the older a man gets the more grave that loss will seem. Any sense of equity we believe we’ve merited must be valued by us first, but that value will always have a context.\n\nThe value of what we make of ourselves in an old books context has to be set and compared against what that value is in a second books context. Much of what we believed would be valuable in our Blue Pill existence, the equity we believed would get us closer to Blue Pill idealist goals, is expected or taken for granted. Yet we think it’s some kind of insurance against the worst of what those operating in the new social contract (if it can be called that) would use it for.\n\nUnderstand now that you’re living on the cusp of deciding what aspects of conventional masculinity are valuable to you, and yet you must still operate in the knowledge of the second set of rules being used all around you. I use this comparison of the old and new sets of books in many of my essays, but this is really a convenience, a tool, to set a contrast in the ideas I’m exploring. Just like Alpha, Beta, Red Pill, Blue Pill, etc. the old and new sets of books are abstracts to describe an idea of two states.\n\nI don’t think men ought to pine for some return to the good ole’ days — most of which are simply romanticizations of times that never really existed — but rather to accept the nature of how the Blue Pill conditions us, emancipate ourselves from it, and use the second set of books to our own best advantage. Once we become aware of our misguidance in basing our masculinity on the false terms of a social contract, a rule set, no one is playing by, then we can begin to effectively direct ourselves towards a positive, new conventional masculinity.\n\nThe Red Pill Balance\n\nI had a reader hit me with this meta-scale Red Pill question that dovetails very nicely into what I proposed in the Second Set of Books.\n\nA lot of what you’ve said echoes my own thinking to such a degree that it’s as if you read my mind. I agree 100%.\n\nWhat you’re talking about here, I think, is the inherent value of goodness or justice. I think Plato took up this question in the Republic and nailed it better than most.\n\nIn the beginning of the dialogue the question is “what is justice?” But it quickly transforms into “what is the value of justice?” In other words, if goodness wins us no reward, then what value does it have? Is it valuable in its own right? Would it have value even if it cost us something, or indeed cost us everything?\n\nGlaucon puts the question like this (paraphrasing): “What if the perfectly just man is seen by everyone as perfectly unjust, while the perfectly unjust man is seen as perfectly just?” He then puts it on Socrates to effectively prove that, even in this scenario, justice would be worth it.\n\nWe could gender this question and simply ask “what if the perfectly good man is seen as perfectly unattractive to women, while the perfectly evil man is seen as perfectly attractive?”\n\nIs goodness worth it even if it isn’t profitable sexually or socially? It’s the same question.\n\nWhy be a ’good’ man when what we consider good by both personal and social measures isn’t rewarded (or only grudgingly rewarded), while what we consider ’bad’ is what is enthusiastically rewarded with women’s genuine desire and intimacy? In other words, Hypergamy doesn’t care about what men consider to be good or bad.\n\nIt seems like this is the predicament Red Pill awareness puts us in when we have to consider the value of our formerly Beta self. What makes the Beta the Beta is his weakness, of course, but it is simultaneously his civility. We’re not defective people for wanting or even needing the possibility of love, empathy, truth, friendship, kindness, and — above all else — trust in our lives. It just makes us human. If we project our deeply rooted desires for these things and treat others the way we want to be treated, wouldn’t society be better off for it? And isn’t this what the supplicating, loyal Beta does when latches on to a woman he believes to be “the One?”\n\nNo Quarter Given\n\nIn my post (and book chapter) Of Love and War I quote a reader who summed up this want for relief from men’s inherent Burden of Performance:\n\nWe want to relax. We want to be open and honest. We want to have a safe haven in which struggle has no place, where we gain strength and rest instead of having it pulled from us. We want to stop being on guard all the time, and have a chance to simply be with someone who can understand our basic humanity without begrudging it. To stop fighting, to stop playing the game, just for a while.\n\nWe want to, so badly.\n\nIf we do, we soon are no longer able to.\n\nWhen I consider this perspective I begin to see a stark paradox; mens’ want for a relief or a respite from that performance burden tends to be their undoing. I wont get too deep into this, but one reason I see the MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way) sphere being so seductive is the hopeful promise of that same relief from performance. Simply give up. Refuse to play along and reject the burden altogether. The culture of Japan’s herbivorous men crisis is a graphic example of the long term effects of this.\n\nHowever, this is the same mistake men make in their Blue Pill, Beta conditioning. They believe that if they meet the right girl, if they align correctly with that special ONE, then they too can give up and not worry about their performance burden — or relax and only make the base effort necessary to keep his ONE happy. The Beta buys the advertising that his Blue Pill conditioning has presented to him for a lifetime. Find the right girl who accepts you, independent of your performance, and you can let down your guard, be vulnerable, forget any notion of Red Pill truths because your girl is a special specimen who places no conditions on her love, empathy, intimate acceptance or genuine desire for you.\n\nThis is also very seductive and inuring for the Beta who’s been conditioned to believe there can realistically be a respite from his burden. My reader continues:\n\nThat’s how it seemed to work in my own life. Looking back on it, I was so grateful to my ex, who was easily the most attractive girl I’d ever been with, that I would have taken a bullet for her. I didn’t want anybody else. I didn’t even think about other girls — the first time that had ever happened to me in a relationship. I can remember thinking that even if she gained weight, lost her looks, and got old, I’d still want her. I would have “loved” her forever. I was good and ready to cash in my chips, exit the sexual marketplace, and retire. I would have arranged my whole life around making her happy and would have felt lucky to have had the privilege.\n\nAt the time, all of that felt noble and brave, but looking back on it now, it just seems pathetic and pathological; the result of my neediness. But the thing is, what if she had reciprocated it? Wouldn’t it have been a relationship worth having? Had she reciprocated it — if any woman was capable of reciprocating that — it wouldn’t have been Disney movie bullshit, but the real thing. We’re supposed to think such a thing is possible and that’s what keeps us playing along. The Red Pill is really about recognizing its impossibility, I think. There is no possible equity. To be sure, a woman can be loyal and dedicated to you, in theory, but she’ll only give that loyalty to the guy who needs it least. It’s like a cruel, cosmic joke.\n\nSuch as it is, that girl lied to me, ran for the hills the moment I showed weakness and needed her the most, and cheated on me. Big surprise, right? With a red pill awareness now I can see how predictable that result was, but at the time I was blindsided by it. I never saw it coming. I couldn’t understand how she could do such a thing when I’d invested so much in her, when I was so willing to give her all the things I’d always wanted most. I assumed she wanted the same things — men and women are the same, right? That’s what the egalitarians tell us. I couldn’t understand how those things could be so valueless to her that she would just throw it all away like that. She didn’t value them at all.\n\nOn occasion I’ve suggested that men watch the movie Blue Valentine. You can check out the plot summary on IMDB, but you really need to watch the movie (on Netflix) to appreciate what I’m going to relate here. The main character suffers from the same romantic idealism and want for a perfected, mutually shared concept of love between himself and the single mother he eventually marries.\n\nIt follows along the same familiar theme of Alpha while single / Beta after marriage that most men experience in what they believe is their lot. More often than not the Alpha they believed their wives or LTR girlfriends perceived they were was really just a guy who’d do for their needs of whatever phase of maturity she found herself in.\n\nBy itself this would be enough for me to endorse the movie, but the story teaches a much more valuable lesson. What Dean (Ryan Gosling) represents is a man who idealistically buys the Blue Pill promise that men and women share a mutual love concept, independent of what their sexual strategies and innate dispositions prompt them to. Because of this misbelief Dean gives up on the burden of his performance. He drops his ambitions and relaxes with his Soul Mate girl, contenting himself in mediocrity, low ambitions and his idealistic belief in a woman sharing and sustaining his romanticized Blue Pill love ideal — in a word, “performancelessness.”\n\nHe relaxes, lets his guard down and becomes the vulnerable man he was taught since birth that women would not only desire, but require for their false, performanceless notions of mutual intimacy. The men of this stripe who don’t find themselves divorced from their progressively bored wives are often the ones who trade their ambitions and passions for a life of mediocrity and routine,… so long as the security blanket of what they believe is a sustainable, passable semblance of that love (but not desire) exists in their wives or girlfriends.\n\nTheir burden of performance is sedated so long as their women are reasonably comfortable or sedate themselves. That false sense of contentment is only temporary and leads to their own ruin or decay.\n\nNo Quarter Expected\n\nI’ve since watched something similar happen to a friend not once but twice. It’s textbook, standard shit.\n\nCultivating these unrequited beta aspects of somebody’s character, if we did it on a mass scale, creates a society worth living in. It’s a civilized society where these things are most possible and it’s a truly worthwhile relationship where both parties regard each other this way and can full expect it to be reciprocated. It requires faith and trust, but we all know better. Our survival depends on knowing better, post sexual revolution. Women were never worthy of such trust and they’re entirely incapable of it. They were never capable of it. We were just supposed to think they were and cultivate the better aspects of our natures in order to be worthy of them.\n\nThe ugly truth of it is that women were never worthy of us.\n\nWomen’s sexuality doesn’t reward justice or goodness — if it did, reciprocity would be the norm and none of us would be confused about relational equity. Women reward not goodness, but strength. And strength is amoral, meaning it can be either just or unjust, good or bad. The guy with strength can either be the villain or the hero — it makes no difference to women. They can’t tell the difference and in truth don’t care anyway.\n\nThere is a set of the Red Pill that subscribe to what I’d call a ’scorched earth’ policy. It’s very difficult to reconcile the opportunistic basis of women’s Hypergamous natures with men’s hopeful, idealistic want for a love that’s independent from their performance burden. So the idea is again one of giving up. They say fuck it, women only respond to the most base selfishly individualistic, socio or psychopathic of men, so the personality they adopt is one that hammers his idealism flat and exaggerates his ’Dark Triad’ traits beyond all believability. This assumes those traits aren’t some act he’s adopted to present the appearance.\n\nIt’s almost a vengeful embrace of the most painful truths Red Pill awareness presents to us, and again I see why the scorched earth PUA (pickup artist) attitude would seem attractive. Women do in fact observably and predictably reward assholes and excessively dominant Alpha men with genuine desire and sexual enthusiasm. Agreeableness and humility in men has been associated with a negative predictor of sex partners.\n\nThe problem inherent in applying reciprocal solutions to gender relations is the belief that those relations are in any way improved by an equilibrium between both sexes’ interests. Solution: turn hard toward the asshole energy. Once men understand the rules of engagement with women and they know Game well enough to capitalize on it, why not capitalize on that mastery of it?\n\nThe dangers of this are twofold. First, it lacks real sustainability and eventually becomes a more sexualized version of MGTOW. Secondly, “accidents” happen. MGTOWs will warn us that any interaction with a woman bears a risk of sexual harassment or false rape claims, but for the scorched earth guy a planned unplanned-pregnancy on the part of a woman attempting to lock down the guy she’s sure is Alpha is far more likely to be his long term downfall. Emotional and provisioning liabilities for a child tends to pour cold water on the scorched earth guy.\n\nIt wouldn’t be inaccurate to say that women are philosophically, spiritually, and morally stunted. They have a limited capacity for adherence to higher ideals and this is why they don’t know or care what actual justice or goodness is. Like Schopenhauer said, they “mistake knowledge for its appearance.”\n\nIt took me a long time to be able to accept this. That is women’s true inferiority — and women are profoundly inferior. And I take no pleasure in recognizing that, as if I’m somehow touting the superiority of team-men. It’s awful, in fact. Dealing with it is the ultimate burden of performance for us as individual men, but also as a society. At some point we’re simply going to have to confront women’s moral inferiority. If we look at our institutions, the very same that are crumbling now all around us, we can see that previous generations of men already figured this out. We just forgot what they knew.\n\nSo what’s the answer? Is justice valuable for its own sake? All of us would probably on some level want to be able to say yes and argue the case, but I don’t know if I can do so convincingly.\n\nI’m with you on this, part of me thinks “Fuck this. It can’t be like this.” But it is. I wish I had the answer.\n\nThere are men who attempt to redress the assumption that men feel some necessity to be someone they really aren’t. The Feminine Imperative is only too willing to exploit this self-doubt by labeling men as existential posers and their conventional masculinity is a ’mask’ — a false charade — they put on to hide the real vulnerability that lies beneath. Unfortunately many men accept this as gospel. It’s part of their Blue Pill upbringing and is an essential aspect of their feminine ’sensitivity training’ and gender loathing conditioning. When masculinity is only ever a mask men wear the only thing real about them is what real women tell them it should be.\n\nWhat we don’t consider is the legitimacy of our need for strength, independence, stoicism, and yes, emotional restraint. That need to be bulwark against women’s emotionality, that need to wear psychological armor against the Red Pill realities of women’s visceral natures is legitimate and necessary. If a man’s vulnerability is ever valuable it’s because his display of it is so uncharacteristic of his normal impenetrability. Women’s contempt is palpable for the weak, vulnerability they expect from lesser child-men — and a commensurate expectation of him to just get that he needs to be strong. Women hate to have to explain to men how to be masculine.\n\nThat’s the inconsistency in women’s Hypergamous nature and the narrative of the Feminine Imperative’s messaging. Be sweet, open, vulnerable; it’s OK to cry, ask for help, be sick and weakened, we’re all equal and empathetic — all new books rules — but, Man Up, “what, you need your mommy?”, assert yourself, the asshole is sexier than you, where’s your self-discipline? — all old books expectations — but, your masculine identity is a mask you wear to hide the real you,……\n\nI play many roles in the male life I lead today, and I’ve played many others in my past. I’m Rollo Tomassi in the manosphere, I’m a father to my daughter, a husband and lover to my wife, a brilliant artist and pragmatic builder of brands in my job, an adventure seeker when I’m on my snowmobile and a quiet contemplator of life and God when I’m fishing. All of those roles and more are as legitimate as I choose to make them. Do I have moments of uncertainty? Do I waiver in my resolve sometimes? Of course, but I don’t let that define me because I know there is no real strength in relating that. And strength is all that matters.\n\nThe Red Pill Balance\n\nRed Pill awareness is both a blessing and a curse. The trick is balancing your Red Pill expectations with your previous Blue Pill idealism. It’s not a sin for you to want for an idealistic reality — that’s what sets us apart from women’s opportunism. You do yourself no favors in killing you idealistic, creative sense of wonderment of what could be. The trick is acknowledging that aspect of your male self.\n\nIf men did not hold heroism as a higher ideal, we wouldn’t be here. If women did not hold survival as a higher ideal, we wouldn’t be here.\n\nMen’s idealism and idealistic concepts of love are the natural counterbalance to women’s pragmatic, Hypergamously rooted opportunism and opportunistic concepts of love and vice versa. Those differing concepts can be applied very unjustly and very cruelly, or very judiciously and honorably, but they are the reality of our existence.\n\nRed Pill awareness isn’t just about understanding women’s innate natures and behaviors, it’s also understanding your own male nature and learning how it fits in to that new awareness and living in a new paradigm.\n\nIs something like justice valuable for its own sake? I’d say so, but that concept of justice must be tempered (or enforced) in a Red Pill understanding of what to expect from women and men. Red Pill awareness doesn’t mean we should abandon our idealism or higher order aspirations, and it certainly doesn’t mean we should just accept our lot in women’s social frame because of it. It does mean we need to balance that idealism in as pragmatic a way with the realities of what the Red Pill shows us.\n\nIdealism\n\nWhen Neil Strauss was writing The Game there was an interesting side topic he explored towards the end of the book. He became concerned that the guys who were learning PUA skills and experiencing such success with women of a caliber they’d never experienced before would turn into what he called “Social Robots.” The idea was one that these formerly Game-less guys would become Game automatons; mouthing the scripts, acting out the behaviors and meeting any countermanding behaviors or scripts from women with calculated and planned “if then” calibration contingencies.\n\nThe fear was that these Social Robots “weren’t themselves”, they were what Mystery Method, Real Social Dynamics, etc. were programing them to be and the relative success they experienced only reinforces that “robot-ness”. My experience with guys from this blog, SoSuave and other forums has been entirely different. If anything most men transitioning to a Red Pill mindset tenaciously cling to the ’Just Be Yourself and the right girl will come along’ mentality.\n\nA strong resistance guys have to Red Pill awareness will always be the “faking it” and keeping it up effort they believe is necessary to perpetuate some nominal success with women. They don’t want to indefinitely be someone they’re not. It’s not genuine to them and either they feel slighted for having to be an acceptable character for women’s intimate attention or they come to the conclusion that it’s impossible to maintain ’the act’ indefinitely. Either way there’s a resentment that stems from needing to change themselves for a woman’s acceptance — who they truly are should be enough for the right woman.\n\nI’ve written more than a few essays about this dynamic and the process of internalizing Red Pill awareness and Game, but what I want to explore here is the root idealism men retain and rely on when it comes to their unconditioned Game. A lot of what men invest their egos in with regard to the old set of books is rooted in men’s innate idealism. In truth this Game is very much the result of the conditioning of the Feminine Imperative, but the idealistic concept of love that men hold fast to is what makes that conditioning so effective. Thus, men’s unplugging becomes a conflict between conviction in old books idealism and new books opportunism that serves the feminine.\n\nWhat’s Your Game?\n\nI’ve written before that every man has a Game. No matter who the guy is, no matter what his culture or background, every guy has some concept of what he believes is the best, most appropriate, most effective way to approach, interact with and progress to intimacy with a woman. How effective that “Game” really is is subjective, but if you asked any guy you know how best to go about getting a girlfriend he’ll explain his Game to you.\n\nMen in a Blue Pill mindset will likely parrot back what their feminine-primary conditioning had them internalize. Just Be Yourself, treat her with respect, don’t objectify her, don’t try to be someone you’re not, are just a few of the conventions you’ll get from a Blue Pill guy who is oblivious to the influence the Feminine Imperative has had on what he believes are his own ideas about how best to come to intimacy with a woman.\n\nFor the most part his beliefs in his methodology are really the deductive conclusions he’s made by listening to the advice women have told him about how best to “treat a woman” if he wants to get with her. A Blue Pill mindset is characterized by identifying with the feminine, so being false is equated with anything counter to that identification.\n\nWhen you dissect it, that conditioned Blue Pill / Beta Game is dictated by the need for accurate evaluation of men’s Hypergamous potential for women. Anything that aids in women’s evaluating a man’s hypergamous potential to her is a tool for optimizing Hypergamy. The dynamics of social proof and preselection are essentially shortcuts women’s subconscious uses to consider men’s value to her. Likewise the emphasis Blue Pill Game places on men’s ’genuineness’ is a feminine conditioning that serves much the same purpose — better hypergamous evaluation. If men can be conditioned to be up front about who they are and what they are, if they internalize a mental point of origin that defers by default to feminine primacy, and if they can be socially expected to default to full and honest disclosure with women by just being themselves, this then makes a woman’s hypergamous evaluation of him that much more efficient.\n\nThis is where most Blue Pill men fail in their Game; who they are is no mystery, their deference and respect is worthless because it’s common and unmerited, and just who he is isn’t the character she wants him to play with her. So even in the best of Blue Pill circumstances, a man is still playing at who he believes will be acceptable to the feminine. His genuineness is what best identifies with the feminine. Blue Pill / Beta Game is really an even more insidious version\n\nof social robotics; the script is internalized, the act is who he is. However, it’s important to consider that this genuineness is still rooted in his idealistic concept of a mutual and reciprocal love.\n\nWhat we need to consider here is that Beta Game stems from old books idealism being repurposed by the Feminine Imperative for its own usefulness. The message to men is this; hold fast to your idealism, but only express it in ways that are useful in terms of Hypergamous opportunism.\n\nAs with the opportunism that Hypergamy predisposes women to, men’s idealistic concept of love stems from his want for genuineness and a want for what could be. I’d suggest that men’s idealism is a natural extension of the burden of performance. From a Beta perspective, one where women are his mental point of origin, that burden is an unfair yoke; one to be borne out of necessity and ideally cast off if he could change the game. To the Alpha who makes himself his mental point of origin, that burden is a challenge to be overcome and to strengthen oneself by. In either respect, both seek an idealistically better outcome than what that burden represents to them.\n\nIn and of itself, a man’s idealism can be a source of strength or his greatest weakness. And while unfettered Hypergamic opportunism has been responsible for many of women’s worst atrocities with men, in and of itself Hypergamy is the framework in which the human species has evolved. Neither is good nor bad, but become so in how they are considered and how they are applied.\n\nMen’s idealistic concept of love is a buffer against women’s opportunistic concept of love. When that idealism is expressed from a Beta mindset, women’s opportunism dominates him and it’s debilitating. When it’s expressed from an Alpha mindset it supersedes her opportunism to the relationship’s benefit.\n\nConditioned Idealism\n\nIf you want to use Blue Valentine (the movie) as an example again, the guy in the relationship abdicates all authority and ambition over to his wife’s opportunism. He idealistically believes “love is all that matters” and has no greater ambition than to please her and ’just be himself’, because his conditioning has taught him that should be enough. His Beta conditioning convinced his idealism that his wife would share in that idealistic concept of love despite his absence of performance. Consequently, she despises him for it. She’s the defacto authority in the relationship and he slips into the subdominant (another child to care for) role rather than his ambitious Alpha idealism caring for her.\n\nNow if a man’s mindset is Alpha, willful idealism propels him to greater ambition, and to prioritize his concept of love as the dominant, and places himself as his mental point of origin. When a woman accepts it, you can see how this leads to the conventional model of masculinity. His idealism is enforced by how he considers it and how he applies it — irrespective of his woman’s direct interests.\n\nMen’s idealistic concept of love can be the worst debilitation in a man’s life when that idealistic nature is expressed from a supplicating Beta mentality. It will crush him when that idealism is all about a bill of goods he idealistically hopes a woman shares and will reciprocate with. This is predominantly how we experience idealism in our present cultural environment of feminized social primacy.\n\nFrom an Alpha perspective that idealism is a necessary buffer against that same feminine opportunistic concept of love that would otherwise tear a Beta apart There was a time when men’s idealistic concept of love was respected above the opportunistic (Hypergamy based) concept of love.\n\nUnder the old set of books, when a man’s attractiveness (if not arousal) was based on his primary provisioning role, his love-idealism defined the intergender relationship. Thus, we still cling to notions of chivalry, traditional romance, conventional models of a love hierarchy, etc. These are old books ideals. The main reason I’ve always asserted that men are the True Romantics is due exactly to men’s idealism as it translates to their concept of love.\n\nThere was a time when men’s idealistic love concept pushed him to achievements that had social merit and were appreciated. Ovid, Shakespeare and the Beatles would not be the humanist icons they are if that idealism weren’t a driving force in men and society. Likewise, women’s, hypergamy-based concept of love, while cruel in its extremes, has nonetheless been a driving motivation for men’s idealistic love as well as a filter for sexual selection.\n\nUnder the new set of books, in a feminine-centric social order, the strengths of that male idealism, love honor and integrity are made to serve the purpose of the Feminine Imperative. Men’s idealistic love becomes a liability when he’s conditioned to believe that women share their same idealism, rather than hold to an opportunistic standard.\n\nMen believe that love matters for the sake of it. Women love opportunistically. The Red Pill aware man realizes that men are the “romantics pretending to be realists” and women; vice versa.\n\nWhat we have today is generations of men conditioned and feminized for identifying with the feminine. These are the generations of men who were conditioned to internalize the equalist lie that men and women are the same and all is relative.\n\nFrom that equalist perspective it should follow that both sexes would share a mutual concept of love — this is the misunderstanding that leads men to expect their idealism to be reciprocated and thus leads to their exploitation and selfabuse.\n\nA man’s idealism becomes his liability when he enters a woman’s opportunistic frame still believing they both share a mutual concept of love. Men and women are different. Both sexes are incentivized to differing concepts of love by way of differentiated experiences, outlooks, in-looks and necessities. This isn’t to say that both sexes cannot find a mutual, symbiotic reference for love between them, it’s that both begin from differing concepts. The problem arises when men are conditioned to believe women share that concept and that women’s conditions and experiences are the only valid definition of love.\n\nAnd this then brings us back full circle to the confusion men experience when they attempt to balance the old books expectations of love with the new books, feminine-primary definition of love based on their own concepts of it. And all of this in the context of an equalism that neither acknowledges men’s experience as individuated from women, nor that love could be anything but what a woman’s experience necessitates it begin as and culminates as.\n\nComplementarity\n\nOver the years I’ve done my best to explain the differences between equalism and complementarity in Equalism and Masculinity (Preventive Medicine) and Positive Masculinity vs. Equalism (The Rational Male) My detailing the social dynamics and psychological influences men face in an equalist headspace has been a recurrent theme in many of my essays as well. On occasion I’ve made contrasting comparisons to Complementarity, but until the Red Pill Parenting series I hadn’t gone into the detail I’d like to.\n\nAs many readers have already mentioned in the stories they’ve shared, it is usually the father who pushes their children towards a higher standard of success. This is critical for the child to develop into a successful adult that excels in society.\n\nIt is usually the mother who coos and coddles their children. This is also necessary, as it’s vitally important for children to feel loved and accepted by their parents. This shows the necessity of the roles of both mothers and fathers in the development of children. If a child faces only criticism, it may have lasting effects on their self esteem. If a child is never criticized, they may never grow up into an adult.\n\nThe negative effects of too much coddling are so widespread, that we actually have sayings that illustrates it. “A ____ only a mother could love”\n\nTo understand the dynamic of complementarity first it’s important to consider the theology behind egalitarianism. I tend to use the term egalitarianism and equalism interchangeably, but I do so because I see them both as stemming from the same tree of blank-slate humanism. In the first Red Pill Parent section I made the following case against of a single parent, single gender upbringing of children:\n\nParenting should be as collaborative and as complementary a partnership as is reflected in the complementary relationship between a mother and father.\n\nIt’s the height of gender-supremacism to be so arrogantly self-convinced as to deliberately choose to birth a child and attempt to raise it into the contrived ideal of what that “parent” believes the other gender’s role ought to be.\n\nThis should put the institutionalized social engineering agenda of the Feminine Imperative into stark contrast for anyone considering intentional single parenthood. Now consider that sperm banks and feminine-specific fertility institutions have been part of normalized society for over 60 years and you can see that Hypergamy has dictated the course of parenting for some time now. This is the definition of social engineering.\n\nThe idea that a single mother is as co-effective as a father stems from the blank-slate belief that gender is a social construct rather than the physical and psychological manifestation of humans’ evolved mental firmware. While the foundations of this blank-slate theory originated with John Locke in in the 17th century it would take the anima/animus theories of Carl Jung to cement egalitarian equalism into the popular conscious with regard to gender relations.\n\nTabula Rasa (blank-slate) refers to the epistemological idea that individuals are born without built-in mental content and that therefore all knowledge comes from experience or perception. With the scientific and technical advancements of the 20th and 21st centuries we now have a better understanding of how the human brains of men and women operate from a far more advanced perspective than Jung or Locke ever had knowledge of. To be fair, Jung’s presupposition was one that humans possess innate potentials for both the masculine and feminine (thus the “get in touch with your feminine side” feminist trope for men), but those potentials derive from a presumed-accepted egalitarian base.\n\nYet still, from a larger social perspective, western(izing) culture still clings to the blank-slate models from Jung inspired by Locke and other tabula rasa thinkers of old.\n\nWhy is that? Why should it be that for all of our greater understanding of the biomechanics of the human body and its influences on behavior that the greater whole of society persists in the belief that men and women possess co-equal gender proficiencies based on an outdated, largely disproved Tabula Rasa model?\n\nI would argue that the more obvious and practical model of evolved gender differences presents an uncomfortable proposition of biological determinism to people conditioned to believe gender is a nurture, not nature, proposition.\n\nOne of the key elements Jung introduced into western culture’s popular consciousness is the theory of anima and animus; that each individual, irrespective of sex, possesses greater or lesser degrees of association and manifested behavior of masculine and feminine psychological affiliations. In 2017, when you hear a 6 year old girl tell a 6 year old boy “you need to get in touch with your feminine side” in order to get him to comply with her wishes for him, you can begin to understand the scope to which this idea has been internalized into society’s collective consciousness.\n\nSo long and so thoroughly has this theory been repeated and perpetuated that we can scarcely trace back its origins — it’s simply taken as fact that men and women possess varying degrees of masculine and feminine energies. First and second wave feminism founded their psychological premises of gender on Jung’s ideas and so evolved the reasonings for a push towards the social feminization we know today. The seeds for the feminine-centrism we take for granted today were planted by a Swiss psychiatrist in the early 1900’s who really wanted to nail his female patients.\n\nIt’s important to consider Jung’s bi-gender individualities within the individual person in context with Locke’s Tabula Rasa theory because in tandem they constitute the basis of the egalitarian equalism which feminism and our present feminine-primary conditioning rely upon. To the modern egalitarian mind, inequalities in social dynamics, gender conflicts and economic disparities are the result of a deliberate (if not malicious) intent on the part of individuals to limit the presumably ’equal’ potentials of others. Social ills are the conflict between the selfish need of the one versus the equalized needs of the many.\n\nThere is very little headspace given to the material, innate, mechanics that make up the condition of the individual. Natural talent, innate ability, in-born predispositions, and physical and adaptive advantages stemming from evolved differences — whether a boon or a burden — are either disqualified or marginalized in an egalitarian mindset. The egalitarian, while very humanistic, leans almost entirely on the learned behavior model of human development. It’s Tabula Rasa, social constructivism, and the zeroed-out-at-birth content of the individual is filled by the influence of a society that is corrupted by those who don’t agree with an idealized egalitarian imperative.\n\nComplementarity\n\nHowever, a second model exists, that of Complementarity. Complementarity acknowledges the importance of the inborn differences between the sexes that egalitarianism marginalizes or outright denies exist while recognizing and embracing the strengths and weaknesses those differences represent.\n\nThere are many well documented, peer reviewed, scientific studies on the neurological differences between men and women’s brain structure. The easiest evidence of these differences is the cyclic nature of women’s sexuality (versus men’s always-on sexuality) and the neurological/hormonal influences on beliefs, behaviors and the rationalizations for those behaviors prompted by the innate drive to optimize Hypergamy.\n\nWomen experience negative emotions differently from men. The male brain evolved to seek out sex before food. And while our feminine-centric social order insists that, in the name of equalism, boys should be forced to learn in the same modality as that of girls, the science shows that boys brains are fundamentally wired to learn differently.\n\nYet, stark differences exist in the wiring of male and female brains. In a 2013 PNAC brain study, maps of neural circuitry show that on average women’s brains are highly connected across the left and right hemispheres, in contrast to men’s brains, where the connections were typically stronger between the front and back regions.\n\nRagin"
