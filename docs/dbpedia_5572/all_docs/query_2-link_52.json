        "text": "Mina Caputo, best known for fronting alternative metal band Life of Agony, gave the trans community a world-famed representative when she came out in 2011. In the years to follow, Laura Jane Grace of punk champions Against Me! would become another boundary breaker, rising out of a background of toxic masculinity and releasing her manifesto Transgender Dysphoria Blues in 2014.\n\nFor Davies, inspiration came in the form of Connie Sgarbossa, vocalist of San Diego hardcore punk band SeeYouSpaceCowboy. She and Backxwash, who injects her Zambian heritage into metal-infused hip-hop, head up the new wave of intersectional trans visibility in the genre.\n\n“When I started making music, Connie was an icon to me representing that anyone can make it and be accepted in the scene,” says Davies, adding that now it seems they can pay it forward, with other trans fans and creatives seeing Pupil Slicer the same way, especially in the UK. “I’m happy that people have messaged us to tell me that our music has helped them through tough times and means so much to them.”\n\nAd Policy\n\nPopular\n\n“swipe left below to view more authors”Swipe →\n\nCan Harris and Walz Meme Their Way to the White House?

She is one of many artists and fans who use the art as an outlet, saying, “Metal music is a great stress reliever and we’ve for sure got a lot to be stressed about.”\n\n“I think extreme music is such a fringe culture that it tends to be more accepting of anyone that wants to be a part of it which provides a safe haven for queer musicians,” Davies says. “The music can also provide a strong form of catharsis for the ups and downs that become part of your life when transitioning and existing as a trans person.”\n\nTo Shevil, “It is raising a middle finger to bigots and conservative types and being yourself, being true to yourself.”\n\nAs an autistic black woman and self-described elder emo, music media personality Sophie K has fought her own battles to achieve this goal. “I grew up in a time when it wasn’t cool to be different,” she says, “and words related to being trans”—she pointedly refuses to repeat them —“were thrown around as insults. When I see so many trans artists being confident in themselves, I find it inspiring because it’s a lesson in self-acceptance.”\n\nThose lessons pay off in ecstatic crowds when Pupil Slicer plays landmark British festivals, like Bristol’s award-winning ArcTanGent and the Midlands’ Download. These two appearances became some of Davies’s most special live moments.\n\nDownload 2023 marked the band’s first major festival appearance after releasing Blossom, an existential sci-fi concept album combining post-rock, mathcore, death, and black metal. “That was our first time playing to around 8,000 people,” says Davies. “There were circle pits from the first note until we stopped playing, including between songs. It was pretty crazy to see ourselves so well received when we were worried what a more traditional rock/metal crowd would think of us.”\n\nIt is a comfort to see some of the UK’s biggest music events such as Download promoting acceptance in their bookings and zero-tolerance policies against discrimination. However, for smaller artists or fans, it can be difficult to find their people in metal crowds. With so little social infrastructure dedicated to lifting up trans artists, especially in the cultural margins where extreme metal lingers, fans and creators alike sometimes resort to building their own sanctuaries.\n\n“Most people don’t realize solo artists are already shelling out a good couple hundred pounds before they’ve even stepped on stage,” says Manor, who can’t afford to tour herself. Having struggled to find community at shows she went to as a fan, she resolved to set up her own festival in the UK’s renowned queer haven of Brighton. Mission Trans-mission, which last year donated all proceeds to queer mental health service MindOut, has just announced its third event to take place in November 2023. It will mark another year of giving the main stage to trans talent, in the hopes that this spurs others to do the same.\n\nYasmine Summan can attest to advocating for themself as a fan and journalist, as well as an ambassador for the trans community. On Wednesdays We Wear Black, which they cohost alongside Sophie K, won “Best Podcast” at last year’s Heavy Music Awards. Summan worked with designer Lauren Gelsei on a customized Disturbia jacket for the ceremony. Worn by Summan on stage, it was painted white-on-black with the names of all those who had been killed, through the previous year alone, in acts of transphobic hate crime.\n\n“We included blue, white, and pink safety pins to emulate the transgender flag, paying tribute to those transgender folk who died hiding their identity. We also had headlines and anti-trans legislation across the jacket to really emphasize the current threat against us, and where it is coming from,” Summan said.\n\nIn a culture of performative LGBTQIA+ support that folds the moment leaders and brands bow to fascism, Summan is proud of the conversation their statement started. “It wasn’t rainbow capitalism,” they said. “It was a real moment of vulnerability.”\n\nWhen artists can get out on tour, friendships made and rekindled stand out in a haze of travel and performance. One of Shevil’s best memories with Thronehammer is playing the Markthalle in Hamburg, on a 2019 tour supporting their doom metal compatriots Lord Vicar. “Chritus is one of my favorite doom metal vocalists,” she says of Lord Vicar’s front man, “so to see him perform onstage every night for nine nights in a row was definitely very cool and special!” He is also an old friend she had been unable to see since they performed in Stockholm, Sweden, back in 2001.\n\nThere are also jokes about fellow UK band Heriot being Pupil Slicer’s arch-rivals as they grow and claim unique victories alongside each other. “We can’t help but be a little jealous that they’re doing arena shows with Architects and playing with [major metal bands] Napalm Death and Knocked Loose,” Davies says. But the band counts their own blessings, having performed with many of their own idols, including British mathcore outfit Rolo Tomassi. In the end, camaraderie always wins out. “We love [Heriot] really, they’re great friends of ours and we’re incredibly happy for their success.”\n\nSophie K captures a social frustration and yearning in metal fans open to educating themselves about each other. “How can metal evolve if we keep hearing the same experiences generation after generation? A trans artist has a different pain to a Black artist or to a cis male or to a disabled person. We need new experiences and artists who are creating a new level of community for fans because it keeps the alternative scene evolving.”\n\nIf the trans bands, artists, and commentors at the vanguard are anything to go by, the British metal scene is becoming a more diverse, welcoming, and explorative space. But while that shift goes on, those at its heart are focused on creating from a place of pride and self-assurance.\n\n“I have shown what I can do musically and vocally over the years since I came out and shown I can be taken seriously as a trans musician,” says Shevil. “I don’t feel I have to prove anything to anyone anymore.”\n\nCorrection: This piece originally said that the area of Aston was located in Manchester. In fact, it is located in Birmingham."
