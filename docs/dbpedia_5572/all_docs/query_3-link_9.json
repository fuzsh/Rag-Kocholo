        "text": "The Rational Male\n\nBy\n\nRollo Tomassi\n\nDo you think you know a lot about relationships, specifically men with women relationships? If yes you do or no you don’t, I still suggest you read this book to get a new perspective. A perspective that Hollywood doesn’t show you and a perspective that a women might not ever share with a man.\n\nThere are rational explanations to women’s behaviors, thanks to red pill philosophy, a philosophy Rollo uses regularly in the book. When a woman gets in a relationship with you, she sees it as joining you on a full time ride where you’re the driver and a leader, then if she discovers that you aren’t leading, she will leave you or continuously test you to see if you can lead. IF You try too hard by saying yes to everything she wants because you want to be a loving boyfriend. You will become less and less attractive in her eyes. She could leave you or just keep you around as a useful doormat. Tomassi has compiled 9 iron rules that are based on his own experience and expertise in the field. Warning these rules aren’t for weak minded men. If you’re tired of being the nice guy that gets dumped or becoming the man- friend that never gets action, then read this book.\n\nRULE #9 Never Seriously Self-deprecate with A Woman You Intend To Be With.\n\nIf you were being a jerk on a date, don’t message her later saying like “Hey, sorry I’ve been a jerk lately, I hope we can hang out again because I like your company.” This is self-deprecating, clingy, and desperate for sympathy. If you act like a jerk, then be a fun jerk to be around and be less apologetic. There are situations where it’s better to sincerely apologize for something you did wrong, but do it with confidence and with no expectations of sympathy or pity.\n\nRULE #8 Always Let a Woman Figure Out Why She Won’t bang You, Never Do It for Her. The idea of leagues is an illusion. If you see a girl and you think to yourself “She’s out of my league” then you just helped her figure out why she won’t bang you. If you’re a part of pick up community, you know that 9’s and 10’s are typically glass cannons. Guys value appearance and her appearance is her identity. When that identity is challenged, she loses it. That’s why pickup guys act like they don’t care when they’re around beautiful women. The women are used to having beta guys drooling over them, so when a guy ignores them or makes sarcastic remarks about their appearance, they are on the hook. The point is never believe a women is out of your league, some might not be available, some might not interested, but never out of your league. Always take your swings at the plate don’t let the umpire call you out, with a fastball right down the middle. Home runs come from big swings. That’s how you make it in any league.\n\nRULE#7 It Is Always Time and Effort Better Spent Developing Better Relations With New, Fresh, Prospective Women, Than It Ever Will Be in Attempting to Reconstruct A Failed Relationship. Also known as a breakup. If you had to beg her back then it is the obvious reason why you’re a chump. She might be your “soul mate” but soul mates are a lie. Time is better spent on a new prospective woman. There really is plenty of fish in the sea, don’t be swayed by narrative of Disney movies. The idea that’s there one women meant for you and you only got one shot in this lifetime, sounds pretty ridiculous, when there’s billions of women on this earth. If you believe in soul mates, fine, just know that doesn’t mean there is one of them for you. If you met one high value women\n\nIf your girlfriend wants to bang you, she’ll find a way, not to make you wait for it. If you’re single and haven’t had sex after 5-6 dates then just get the hell out and move on.\n\nRULE#2 Never, Under Pain of Death, Honestly Or Dishonestly, Reveal The Number of Women You Slept With Or Explain Any Detail Of Your Sexual Experience With Them To A Current Lover.\n\nLaw 4 of the 48 Laws of Power: is always say less than necessary. Law 17: is cultivate an air of mystery. By telling her how many girls you’ve slept with, you are breaking both laws and thus giving away your power. Keeping it to yourself makes you mysterious and strokes her imagination. Revealing too much also gives her ammo for future arguments.\n\nRULE#1 Frame Is Everything. Always Be The Subconscious Balance of Who’s Frame In Which You Are Operating. Always Control The Frame, But Resist Giving The Impression That You Are.\n\nIdeally you want her to be operating in your reality or your frame. This gives you power. IF you are trying to convince her to like you or have sex with you, you are operating in her frame. When girls shit test you, they’re trying to see if you’re legit, if you’re a strong confident individual. When you enter a relationship either you will enter it her reality or she will enter yours. Which will it be?\n\nLet me know in the comments which Rule is your favorite or which one you disagree with. This book might offend some, but I’d say it’s required reading for all men looking to broaden their horizon on attraction and relationships.\n\nQuotes:\n\n“So entrapped are we in our self-expectation and self-imposed limitations that we fail to see that we have always had the keys to our own prisons - we&#039;re just scared shitless to use them.”\n\n“Women would rather share a high value Man than be saddled with a faithful loser.”\n\n“Anxiety, trauma and crisis are necessary catalysts to stimulate self- consciousness.”\n\n“The definition of Power is not financial success, status or influence over others, but the degree to which we have control over our own lives.”\n\n“Stimulating a woman’s imaginings is the single most potent talent you can develop in any context of a relationship.”\n\n“Women will cry a river about wanting Mr. Dependable and then go off to fuck Mr. Exciting.”\n\n“Nothing is as simultaneously fear inspiring and arousing for women as a Man she suspects is self-aware of his own value.”\n\n“Is the woman who applies make up everyday ‘being herself”?”\n\n“Women are fundamentally incapable of loving a man in the way that a man expects to be loved by a woman.”\n\n“Women want to be with Men who other women want to fuck, and other men want to be.”\n\n“In any relationship, the person with the most power is the one who needs the other the least.”\n\n“Experience teaches harsh, but it teaches best and the breadth of experience serves a man well.”\n\nSource:\n\ngoodreads/work/quotes/26430071-the-rational-male"
