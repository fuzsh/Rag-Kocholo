        "text": "In Preventive Medicine (2015) author Rollo Tomassi analyzes male and female sexual market value and the games women play to manipulate men and maximize their dating and sexual returns.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAbout The Author:\n\nRollo Tomassi is a popular figure in the manosphere.\n\nHe is the author of one of the most popular red pill books called, just like his blog, “The Rational Male“.\n\nTomassi defines himself in this book as “a student of life just as much as you are” and, he adds, “as such, I understand the value of knowing that I know nothing”.\n\nIt’s a nice virtue signal, but doesn’t seem to us it corresponds to reality.\n\nSee:\n\n#1. This Is Hypergamy In A Nutshell\n\nHypergamy is one of the most defining concepts of Rollo’s theorizing.\n\nAnd we can summarize it as follows:\n\nHypergamy is the female drive to secure the best genes she can and, ideally but not necessarily from the same man, attract the most resources she can.\n\nRollo Tomassi says that ideally, she will get both great genes and abundant resources from the same man.\n\nBut that’s unlikely… Particularly in these days.\n\nMy Note: Are today’s men really poorer than in the past?\n\nThis is a recurring theme in the manosphere that today’s men are not as “good” or “mannish” as in the past.\n\nAnd albeit that’s potentially true, I’m far from convinced about it -and there is no data to back that up, as far as I’m aware-.\n\nAlso read:\n\nWhy you must stop whining about female hypergamy\n\n#2. The Science of Alpha Fucks Beta Bucks\n\nRollo Tomassi mentions the Kinsey Institute study.\n\nThe study shows how facial preferences in women change depending on their menstruation period.\n\nAnd, Rollo says, women want mannish man when they’re ovulating and most likely to be impregnated and prefer more feminine men when they’re least like to get pregnant.\n\nRollo Tomassi claims that’s the basis, and proof of the “alpha fucks beta bucks” theory.\n\nMy Note: The study was unclear, actually\n\nAlbeit what Rollo says makes sense, the study he cites actually disproves his own theory.\n\nThis is what the study says:\n\nHowever, there was no significant difference in masculinity preference between women in the low- and high-conception probability groups\n\nRead more in the “criticism” section.\n\n#3. This How Women Behave Depending on Which Phase They’re In\n\nRollo Tomassi categorizes women -and their dating behaviors and expectations- into different categories depending on which life’s phase they are in:\n\n15 years old: into hot boys with good bodies, facial symmetry, right eyes color, and proper haircut.\n\nBetween 15 and 25, even a man with a beta mindset can be successful if he has a good physique.\n\nWomen between 18 and 20 are incapable to commit to anything.\n\nThe Break Phase: late teen years, moving to college she is inclined to end the relationship and enjoy her options during her peak years\n\nparty years (20-25 YO): enjoy peak SMP and start developing and appreciation for inner alpha qualities. She longs for an ideal of alpha man with long-term provider capabilities\n\nLate party years: during the last third of party years she starts feeling more pressure for a long term commitment\n\nEpiphany Phase (28-30 YO): she realizes it’s hard to compete with younger women, she switches from offers coming to her to feeling like it’s her who needs to secure a good man.\n\nShe still hopes she can “convert” the bad alpha boys\n\nTransitory phase (29-31 YO): competition anxiety increases, she’s now getting more interested into beta providers\n\nSecurity phase (31-34 YO): affluence, status and resources become the major attractor for women. It’s more difficult to game them because they require commitment\n\nDevelopment phase (7-9 years after commitment & children): After a few years she has consolidated her position with a provider, a woman doesn’t need a provider anymore.\n\nHer SMV decreases while his holds steadier, so she tries to become more dominant to preserve the power balance (my note: I’m not sure this is accurate: women initiate most divorces in long term marriages)\n\nMy Note:\n\nA lot of good points in these phases.\n\nBut, as well, some mistakes some generalizations.\n\nAges and mores also change a lot depending on the culture, and this applies to liberal and libertine cultures (ie.: as of today it’s very western-centric).\n\n#4. These Are Female Manipulation’s Tools\n\nI really enjoyed these pearls of wisdom.\n\nFor example:\n\n“Men are incapable to commit“: it’s only women who find it hard to find a man who say that in an effort to mend their egos\n\n“What happened to all the nice men“: women say this one to the beta chumps to signal they’re ready for commitment… If he plays the nice guy role\n\n“Men need to men up“: 30 YO or older trying to shame men into getting serious, but actually masking her realization that she’s now losing all her power to attract men\n\n“Men are threatened by powerful women“: shaming men into giving up younger women and appreciate her other (less important) qualities\n\nAnd more generally:\n\nMen shaming: this is what she does when she can’t find a man who “forgives her” of her wild past or when he refuses to provide\n\nAlso read:\n\nCommitment games women play\n\nGames women play (a long list)\n\nAre men threatened by powerful women or just being rational?\n\n#5. Providers Are Culturally-Manipulated Men\n\nI only partially agree but I loved this part.\n\nRollo Tomassi says that the “feminine imperative” (sic) and the cultural expectations for men to provide can become straight-jackets for men.\n\nRollo recommends you watch this clip from “Breaking Bad” to understand the point:\n\nTo understand how women do it, read a classic article on this website:\n\nHow women domesticate men (with examples)\n\nProviders VS Lovers: the quality of the man is what makes the biggest difference\n\nShould you date as a lover or as a provider? This article will help you decide which strategy suits you best\n\n#6. The More Powerful She Is, The More Honest She Is About Hypergamy\n\nThis was a very deep observation.\n\nRollo Tomassi says that women who can provide for themselves are freer to talk openly about their dual dating strategy (ie.: love the alpha bad boy but pretend you prefer the provider who sticks around).\n\nThe example is Sheryl Salzberg, author of Lean-In.\n\nSalzberg openly recommends women to date around the bad boys but only marry and settle with a man who wants an equal partnership and “is happy or, even better, wants to do his fair share of chores in the house”.\n\nLOL, Rollo Tomassi totally nailed it there.\n\nHowever, women who cannot provide for themselves as much as Salzberg can, still need to play the game and pretend they actually prefer the “egalitarian man”.\n\nThis is because most women have to settle for a tradeoff between alpha men and providing men.\n\nAnd when the time comes to settle down, they have to pretend they prefer the providing men.\n\nPreventive Medicine Quotes\n\nOn what women want:\n\nWomen want men who other men want to be and other women want to fuck\n\nOn women’s position on a man’s life:\n\nWomen should be the supplement to a man’s life, not its focus\n\nOn women’s manipulation effort to make men into providers (I paraphrase):\n\nMen need to man up is the battle cry of every single woman older than 30\n\nThis is how Rollo Tomassi defines game:\n\nA series of behavioral modifications to life skills based on psychological and sociological principles to facilitate intersexual relations between genders\n\nCriticism\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed “The Rational Male Preventive Medicine”.\n\nAnd I agree with much of the content.\n\nBut, same as for its predecessor “The Rational Male“, I also found much to object to.\n\nIf you’re a red-pill Rollo fan, arm yourself with an open mind before delving in.\n\nDid you?\n\nGreat.\n\nThen, for an overview of the red pill, see this video analysis:\n\nOK, then let’s start:\n\n#1. The Data Is Misrepresented (To Fit The Narrative)\n\nRollo misquotes studies to fit his narrative.\n\nFor example, he quotes The New York Post saying:\n\nAccording to a recent study by iVillage, less than half of wedded women married the person who was the best sex of their lives (52 percent say that was an ex)\n\nRollo titles the chapter “nobody marries their best sex ever”, which is obviously a complete mischaracterization since almost half do.\n\nBut, most of all, he misrepresents -or misunderstands- the data to fit his narrative.\n\nIn a nutshell, he implies that the research proves that women fuck the alphas when young but marry the betas later on when looking for a beta provider.\n\nHowever, Rollo doesn’t realize the research proves the opposite of what Rollo Tomassi says.\n\nYou only need a modicum of logic and math to understand it.\n\nSurvey data shows that women’s average sex partner count, just to stay on the safer lower end, is 5 partners.\n\nIf women were to marry the best sex of their lives just by pure chance, that would be a 20% chance.\n\nInstead, it’s more than double!\n\nAnd that is the opposite of Rollo’s theory.\n\n#2. There Are Several Unsubstantiated Claims\n\nSays Rollo Tomassi:\n\nThe most secure, monogamous attachment women make are with men they perceive to be one to two points above what she perceives to be her own sexual market value.\n\nI actually agree with the gist of the concept.\n\nBut… Based on what does he assign “points”, and on what scale?\n\nThe famous old PUA “0 to 10 HB scale”?\n\nAnd then again:\n\nArguments about chores and sex life are most common in couples where the woman makes the decisions.\n\nFemale decision-making status is an even bigger predictor of relationship dissatisfaction than female breadwinner status.\n\n(…)\n\nWomen despise being the leaders\n\nBased on what does he say that?\n\nBecause my personal observations don’t substantiate that at all. Relationships with female leadership tend to be more stable and last longer.\n\nSo I really would have liked to check for resources. Or at least for a deeper analysis as to the “why that’s the case”.\n\nBut nothing… Just Rollo’s own ideas presented as truths.\n\nOverall, the whole “Preventive Medicine” is basically a book built around unsubstantiated claims.\n\nThat’s not necessarily wrong.\n\nI often repeat that a good observer of social dynamics can be better than a good researcher, but it’s something to keep in mind.\n\nPop Psychology\n\nIt’s funny.\n\nRollo Tomassi pokes fun at what he refers to as “the pop psychology of the love languages”.\n\nBut love languages are not pop-psychology and several studies have confirmed their existence. Even psychologists who are critical of their usefulness confirm their relevance.\n\nIt’s “The Rational Male Preventive Medicine” that sounds like pop-psychology at times.\n\n#3. Evolutionary Psychology Doesn’t Add Up\n\nEvolutionary psychology is the best tool to understand sexual dynamics.\n\nBut not when you make up stories that sound credible but that have no scientific backing.\n\nThat’s just storytelling.\n\nAnd that’s OK… IF one clearly stated that they are personal conjectures.\n\nThat wasn’t always the case in “Preventive Medicine”.\n\nSometimes, I found evolutionary psychology to contradict some of Rollo’s theory.\n\nFor example, the popular theory that beta males are always left holding the bag for the “alpha fucks men“.\n\nBut if beta males were consistently so stupid to provide and stick around older and less fertile women -and many surely are!-, shouldn’t these men have disappeared from the lineage?\n\nOr, at the very least, shouldn’t there be so few of them that the “alpha fucks” strategy stops working so well?\n\nThat doesn’t seem to be the case.\n\nInstead, it seems like beta men are creating lots of other beta men. So, in the end, it might be more correct to say “alpha fucks more and provides less”, betas fucks a bit less, and provides more”.\n\nAlso read:\n\n#4. Young Girls Pair Up With Alphas, Old Girls Pair Up With Betas Doesn’t Add Up Mathematically\n\nThis one also doesn’t add up.\n\nThe idea of the “alpha fucks, beta bucks” is that the alphas are sexy and cool and they only give their dick.\n\nAnd the betas are boring, pedestalize women, act like their emotional tampons and support them financially.\n\nYounger women, says Rollo, want the alpha.\n\nOlder women want the betas because they stick around.\n\nThere is quite some truth in that and that is the case for some women. But reality is not so black and white.\n\nFor all women to fuck alphas as youngsters and marry betas as oldsters, there should be twice the numbers of men.\n\nObviously, that’s not the case.\n\nThat’s becuase reality is more complex and variegated.\n\nSome betas also do bang (a bit).\n\nAnd some alphas also do get married and stick around (just look at Trump, Berlusconi, and many other tycoons. Even if they had women on the side, they still got married).\n\nThere are indeed two more important categories of alphas:\n\nAlpha providers\n\nAlpha fathers\n\nOr watch here:\n\nOverly Simplistic Split of Betas/Alphas\n\nSplitting men in two categories is bound to be overly simplistic.\n\nJust like Marx was wrong dividing society in a Manichean “owners VS employees”, so you can’t be right simplifying a complex reality to “alphas” and “betas“.\n\nFor a quick explanation, watch this video:\n\nOr read “lovers VS provers VS friends” for a slightly deeper explanation of sexual market values.\n\nAlpha Fucks: A Tool For Posturing & Ego-Massaging\n\nThat mantra is often used in the manosphere as a tool for ego massaging.\n\nPeople who read alpha fucks think of themselves as alphas.\n\nAnd then they go around repeating the mantra as an attempt to social climb on some imagined (or sometimes real) “blue-pilled betas”.\n\nThis is called “alpha male posturing”.\n\nAnd as Rollo said in this same “Preventive Medicine”: rich people don’t need to say they’re rich.\n\nAnd alpha men don’t need to say they’re alphas.\n\n#5. The Ovulatory Shift Is Not The Scientific Basis of The “Alpha Fucks Theory” It’s Drummed Up To Be\n\nTomassi presents the ovulatory shift as if it the corroboration of the “alpha fucks, beta bucks” theory.\n\nLogically, it makes sense.\n\nHowever, the ovulatory shift in humans is a hypothesis, and the evidence backing it remains quite, well “shifty”.\n\nAlbeit it sounds very appealing, the actual results when it comes to humans are not as obvious -or as strong- as Rollo makes it sound.\n\nMeta-analysis shows both supporting evidence and contrasting evidence.\n\nI quote a good recent study providing a nice overview:\n\nWhile some studies that measured women’s hormones to characterize current fertility reported women’s preferences for masculine characters were stronger when conception is more likely47, several recent studies have found no change in mate preferences among women at the peri-ovulatory phase for muscularity48,49, facial masculinity23,49,50, beards23,51, vocal masculinity52,53 and facial symmetry49. Thus, the extent to which ovulatory cycle shifts are associated with women’s mate preferences may have been overestimated in past research due to imprecise methodologies and small sample sizes54.\n\nMarcinkowska et al., 2019\n\nI personally think the ovulatory shift is probably real.\n\nAnd yet, the ovulatory shift not nearly as strong as Rollo Tomassi makes it sound in his “Rational Male trilogy”.\n\nPersonal female preferences seem to stronger than cycles.\n\nOverall, I find some of the “science” behind Rollo’s theories to be evolutionary psychology conveniently bent to fit the narrative.\n\n#6. The “Feminine Imperative” Cultural Inculcation Is (Vastly) Overblown\n\nRollo Tomassi is almost as obsessed with this as feminists are with the patriarchy.\n\nHe seems to be convinced that there is a feminine propaganda that crooks all men’s natural instincts.\n\nFor example:\n\nThis is a major frustration for beta young men predisposed to effeminate conditioning that convinces them they will be rewarded for loyalty, support and building relationship equity\n\n“Effeminate” conditioning?\n\nI get what Rollo is talking about, but it’s not effeminate conditioning.\n\nLoyalty and support are valid qualities to be exchanged in the sexual marketplace.\n\nMaybe they’re not the ones Rollo favors -and neither are they the ones I favor-, but they’re still valid traits which do can help men to find mates, under certain circumstances.\n\nAt parity of genetics, a loyal and supportive man will most often beat an unsupportive and disloyal one for long-term mating.\n\nIt makes sense, no?\n\nAnd I’m also missing what would be Rollo’s alternative here.\n\nDisloyalty, selfishness and not building relationship equity?\n\nIt sounds like a great recipe for a great relationship… Not.\n\n#7. The Rational Male Has Sect-Like Undertones\n\nThere are elements of sect-dynamics in this philosophy.\n\nThe group that should stick together, the “manipulative enemy” to study and defend from and other men to recruit and turn to the red-pill credo.\n\nLabeling is also part of that game.\n\nSects make their members feel “special”.\n\nAnd what’s the easiest way to do it if not denigrating anyone else who doesn’t buy into the sect?\n\nEnter the terms “beta” for those who don’t buy into your theories.\n\nThe “blue-pilled betas” are the idiots and the suckers who get played.\n\nAnd reflection “us”, the red-pilled people within the sect, we are the cool alphas.\n\nI find that both childish and off-putting.\n\nAnd I wished more for a thought leader.\n\nAlso see:\n\nDark psychology in group dynamics: how group leaders want to strengthen the group to increase their power\n\nAnd I advise you to read this article so central both to this website, and to personal empowerment:\n\nThe Individualist’s Manifesto\n\n#8. Made Up Conspiracy of “Feminine” Propaganda Used As Straw-Man\n\nRollo sees society as a big feminine indoctrination.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe feminine imperative has learned to recognize and exploit this natural deference by including as an inevitable part of future men’s early conditioning\n\n(…)\n\nThe feminine imperative IS the priority.\n\nWhat?\n\nAgain, I actually agree with the general principle that different interest groups try to manipulate others.\n\nBut it’s rarely an organized effort, and it’s even more rarely an organized effort which manages to dominate all other groups’ interests.\n\nInstead, Rollo Tomassi speaks as if there were a secret sect of “master of puppets” women who successfully manipulate the media and the culture to keep men subjugated.\n\nThat is hogwash.\n\nLet me state this clearly:\n\nThe idea that there is some sort of secret propaganda governed by the “feminine imperative” that effectively “effeminizes” men and manipulates men to serve women is nonsense.\n\nBut that’s exactly what reading Tomassi feels like.\n\nIt’s all about “feminine imperative”, “conditioning”, “feminine influence pervading men” etc. etc.\n\nThe keyword in my sentence is “effectively”.\n\nBecause sure women tend to embrace and talk up values that benefit men.\n\nBut so do men.\n\nThe truth is that society is far too complex and far too fragmented to yield so passively to any indoctrination or propaganda from a population’s minority.\n\nSure, everyone will be trying to pitch what best suits their interest, but rarely any voice can be so strong as to drown out all other groups’ interests (with the only exception maybe being the conservative propaganda, but even there we’re not talking about indoctrination).\n\nFurthermore, Rollo then keeps using this made-up conspiracy as a straw-man technique to finger-point at women and “blue-pilled” society at large.\n\n#9. Culture Encourages Male Providing Because It’s Good For The World (Not Just for Women)\n\nIt’s true:\n\nThere is indeed a strong cultural strand influencing men to behave subserviently to women.\n\nAnd I have even personally spent all of my life rejecting the cultural diktat of the provider’s role.\n\nBut this is what Rollo doesn’t get:\n\nIt’s not (just) the “feminine imperative” that seeks to influence men into providers’ roles.\n\nWhen men provide instead of, say, fuck and abandon pregnant women, it’s good for society.\n\nAnd it’s because male providing is good for everyone that society embraces it, not because it’s part of the “feminine imperative” to trick men.\n\nThat’s what Rollo never seems to get.\n\nSure, women benefit when men provide, forgive their partying past and stay loyal.\n\nBut so do the children, the neighbors, the communities, society as a whole and, more often than not, those men themselves.\n\nFurthermore, we could make the case that a man providing for his family is embracing certain values that should respected, and not laughed at (even if we personally haven’t chosen that lifestyle).\n\n#10. Rollo Tomassi Mistakes Cultural “Feminine Imperative” With Simple Effects of Supply & Demand\n\nTomassi gets this all wrong.\n\nHe says that men pedestalize women because of the “female imperative” and the “cultural conditioning”.\n\nI don’t see it that way.\n\nSure, some men may fall for the cultural strand of the feminine worldview. And I even agree that, today, the feminine view is the most powerful.\n\nBut most powerful of all it’s the supply and demand of the dating marketplace that influences male behavior, not the “feminine imperative”.\n\nBecause most men are happy to impregnate most women and women are more selective, the rule of thumb is that women are the demand and men are the offer.\n\nAnd that is what makes women, naturally (and on average), the object of desire.\n\nNot the “propaganda”, “female imperative”, “conditioning” or any other made-up conspiracy.\n\nFurthermore, we can argue that for most men, with the little options they have, it’s rational to provide for women.\n\nFor more or and supply and demand read:\n\nSexual market place: an analysis of dating power dynamics\n\nHow to date\n\nDate-onomics by Jon Berger\n\nWhy successful women lose at dating\n\n#11. Lots of Sweeping Generalizations That Make For Bad Analyses\n\nRollo’s theories are not wrong per se.\n\nBut they become mostly wrong when he pretends they generalize to almost everyone.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe girlfriend you expect to build a Disneyland life with will break up with you as her options expand and your restrict\n\nI can’t believe how many pre-suppositions that sentence include. And most of them are unlikely to be true.\n\nEspecially to be all true at the same time.\n\nFor example:\n\nIt presupposes he has a Disneyland fantasy in mind\n\nIt presupposes she has no Disneyland fantasy\n\nIt presupposes she goes to college, but he doesn’t\n\nIt presupposes she wants to “shop around”\n\nIt presupposes he does not want to shop around (really?)\n\nIt presupposes her options expand, but his don’t\n\nNotice that each of them are possible and, in some situations, even likely to be true.\n\nBut that they’re all true at the same time is not the most likely scenario.\n\nBasically, what Rollo says is true… For a few cases.\n\nBut the moment he writes as if he were describing a typical situation, then Rollo’s otherwise great micro-analysis becomes a nonsense macro-theory.\n\nThe whole “Rational Male Volume 2” is fraught with sweeping generalizations.\n\nMost of them are great analyses of specific situations, but most of them turn into very poor systemic theories when Rollo over-generalizes.\n\n#12. Let’s Be Frank: There Are Misogynistic Understone All Through It\n\nSame as for “Rational Male Volume 1”.\n\nIn Rollo Tomassi’s worldview, women are “hypergamy-driven”, while men are idealistic.\n\nFor example:\n\nHypergamy doesn’t care for male idealistic expectations of love\n\nOf course, Rollo Tomassi portrays himself as neutral and open-minded.\n\nBut it just doesn’t come out well.\n\nHe says yes, “women can love deeply”, but take a look at the caveat:\n\nWomen can love deeply, but from an entirely opportunistic perspective\n\nWhat’s that supposed to mean?\n\nDoes it mean that men “love deeply” from a purely altruistic perspective?\n\nNonsense.\n\nThe way I see it, you can’t fool me with your “men and women are better together” and then break bread and laugh at Andrew Tate’s blatant gaslighting:\n\nWatch this video for more.\n\n#13. If A Few Men Are Gullible, It’s Not Necessarily Women’s Fault, Is It?\n\nThe feeling of “Preventive Medicine” is that of manipulative men who dupe men.\n\nYet my feeling was that the men Rollo describes are not “typical” men, but a minority of gullible men.\n\nIs it women’s fault if some men have Disneyland fantasies well into their maturity?\n\nI don’t think so.\n\nFurthermore, Rollo confuses manipulation with self-manipulation.\n\nIt’s not only women who might want to hide a wild sexual past: it’s men who don’t want to see that past.\n\nAlso read the “Madonna-whore dichotomy“.\n\nThe Rational Male Is Male Feminist Equivalent\n\nHave you noticed the parallels with feminism?\n\n“Feminine imperative” is the equivalent of “patriarchy” and “hypergamy” is the feminist equivalent of “toxic masculinity”.\n\nMy appeal to you, my dear reader, is to move beyond petty group-identification and to look instead at humanity, as well as genders, as subsets of the whole.\n\nAs Robert Greene says (I paraphrase) “the only sense of belonging worthy of that name is the belonging to the human race”.\n\nLook For Win-Win Instead\n\nBottom line:\n\nYou can be better and stronger looking for win-win relationships within that whole, rather than looking at reasons why you should be at war.\n\nAlso read:\n\nToxic manosphere mindsets\n\n#14. I Don’t See A Society of Men Conditioned To Prioritize Relationships\n\nAgain another case of bad generalization.\n\nRollo says that men are conditioned to stick to relationships to the detriment of their professional achievements.\n\nWomen, instead, are conditioned to put themselves first.\n\nI don’t know in which world Rollo lives, but in this world, it’s women who, on average, put relationships first and men who, on average, prioritize work, success, and achievements.\n\nAnd in liberal societies, men are less conditioned to pursue long term relationships and do whatever they like, not more.\n\nMen have never been free to stay single as they are today.\n\nRollo’s advice that men should prioritize work and not get distracted by women is also wrong, in my opinion.\n\nJust look at the most successful men: many of them have long-term relationships and I’ve never seen any study linking bachelor-hood to male success.\n\nIf anything, it might be the opposite.\n\nIndeed as Amir Levine explains in Attached, studies show that strong intimate relationships help men to be more confident in life and achieve more.\n\n#15. It’s Great Analysis, But 100% Biased & One-Sided\n\nIt’s called “The Rational Male”.\n\nBut if one wanted to spoof it, they might dub it “the biased male”.\n\nRollo says he connects the dots.\n\nBut he only connects the dots from the biased perspective of what he wants to see.\n\nWhat Rollo says is not necessarily wrong but it presents, at (the very) best, only half of reality.\n\nThere is not even a single mention of male’s own games, manipulations, and efforts to influence culture.\n\nAnd sure you don’t believe men are innocent creatures who don’t partake in the sexual arms’ race, do you?\n\nIf you do, take this as a wake-up call and read around here a bit more.\n\n#16. It’s Divisive: It Pits Men Against Women\n\nThis is what I like least about Tomassi’s work:\n\nIt’s extremely divisive.\n\nAnd, in that, it’s only better than feminism because of its more realistic analysis.\n\nBut not for its effects.\n\nMost of Rational Male’s theories are deeply, inherently divisive. And it couldn’t be otherwise because it only looks at half of the game.\n\nWe have already seen an example: women have an “opportunistic approach to love” and men have “an idealistic approach to love”.\n\nAnd albeit, again, there is a backdrop of truth there… It’s just plain wrong to make it into a generalized rule.\n\nRollo Tomassi says quoting one of his readers:\n\nI know how hunger feels and I assume women feel the same way.\n\nHowever I have no idea how hypergamy feels like, I have never felt its pull\n\nWhat a load of bullshit!\n\nHypergamy is nothing but the tendency to maximize one’s own returns and men equally seek to maximize their returns (the good ones, at least).\n\nIt’s simply expressed differently, in men.\n\nRead more in:\n\nStop whining about hypergamy\n\n#17. Rollo’s Theory Leads to Toxic Relationships Because He Misapplies & Misunderstands Game Theory\n\nThis is “Rollo Tomassi cardinal rule of sexual strategy”:\n\nFor one gender’s sexual strategy to succeed the other gender must compromise or abandon their own.\n\nWhich is basically a deeply flawed misunderstanding of game theory applied to relationships (also read “game theory bargaining“).\n\nIt is true that one player from each gender can gain more by short-changing the other.\n\nFor example, purely from a utilitarian point of view, a woman might get more if she can trick more than one man to finance her lifestyle and invest in her offspring.\n\nAnd, similarly, a man can gain more by getting a woman pregnant and abandoning her.\n\nThis is because social relations are somewhat social exchanges and, thus, can be described in game theory terms.\n\nAnd tricking others (defections) can yield outsized wins.\n\nAnd at the core, that’s what this Rational Male philosophy is about: a long-winded description of how defection strategies apply to dating.\n\nThe problem is that Rollo stops there!\n\nRollo Tomassi never moves beyond a “me VS you” paradigm.\n\nWhy does Rollo Tomassi sees it as a struggle?\n\nBecause Rollo’s philosophy sees women as enemies of men.\n\nAnd that’s why, I stated and confirm here, Rollo Tomassi’s philosophy is inherently misogynistic.\n\nThe problem with it?\n\nFirst of all, morality.\n\nWhen you have an enemy, all amoral ways of dealing with them become moral (see Zimbardo, 2008)\n\nRape is also a type of “defection strategy” that you’d use with an enemy.\n\nBut let’s stick to facts here without any morality.\n\nSecond, and most important of all, both genders can also gain if they support each other.\n\nWhich is, guess what, the standard view of relationships that society aspires to -exactly what it should do-.\n\nNow, knowing the theory of manipulation (“defection” in game’s theory terms), is extremely important to understand reality and to protect oneself.\n\nBut listening to “red-pilled authors” pitching a defection strategy as the “real reality” that men should follow, that’s not only nonsense, that’s toxic nonsense.\n\nThe Truth of Sexual Arms’ Race\n\nIn evolutionary psychology, the defection strategy has also been referred to as “sexual arms’ race”.\n\nIt’s been well explored and discussed by Robert Wright, which I invite you to read (a good substitute for resentment-fuelled manosphere evolutionary psychology).\n\nThe truth of the sexual arms’ race is that it coexists with the many -and likely stronger- incentives for cooperation.\n\nAnd you can minimize the incentives to defection while enjoying an awesome and supportive relationship.\n\nTL,DR: Rollo Tomassi “red pill” is a potentially highly toxic misinterpretation of relationships.\n\nI warmly welcome readers to seek more information -at least if they’re interested in win-win and supportive relationships.\n\n#18. Not Good For Seducers Who Love Women\n\nI’m glad I can say this:\n\nI am a man.\n\nAnd I have been mostly single because I enjoy adventures. And I really dislike feminism because it pitches women against men.\n\nAnd I even think that this society is on a warpath against (white) men, especially with divorce law.\n\nThis gives me some credibility to criticize Rollo Tomassi’s philosophy.\n\nAnd Rollo Tomassi’s philosophy is toxic for men who love women, including men who like to sleep with lots of women.\n\nBecause seducers who like women, like women, and they don’t consider them as enemies!\n\nAlso read:\n\nPsychological breakdown of womanizers: the different types of womanizers, including those who love women\n\nTypes of seducers: different seducers’ styles with pros and cons\n\nReal Life Applications\n\nDon’t cave to ultimatums: women give ultimatums when they feel their control is slipping and they need to hurry. But they will lose respect for men who cave in (also read “how to handle breakup threats“)\n\nDon’t be vulnerable: vulnerability has become all the rage with Brene Brown, but Rollo says it’s a hoax. You will not be more attractive “opening up” and “showing your weak and tender side” (I agree, read: vulnerability is NOT power)\n\nDon’t settle because you’re afraid of dying alone: the image of passing away around your family is a fairytale dream. If you work on yourself, male value does not go down like female does (Rollo says men peak around 36-38).\n\nInstead of fearing to be alone, fear misery in a passionless marriage.\n\nDon’t buy PUA programs: Rollo doesn’t believe in PUAs selling programs and “cures”. The information is freely available and your reality is too specific to find answers in a single course / program\n\nCONS\n\nOn top of the criticism:\n\nNot really as open-minded as professed\n\nRollo says at the beginning of “Preventive Medicine” that “he knows that he doesn’t know” and he invites readers to form their opinions.\n\nThat’s all nice and good… In intent.\n\nBut he doesn’t seem always very open to being wrong -or to warrant dissenters the freedom to disagree-.\n\nI find indeed that “The Rational Male” is at times aggressive and bellicose towards anyone who disagrees:\n\nSometimes It’s Unclear\n\nIt was difficult to follow when Tomassi was talking about which phase was which.\n\nFor example, he has two different names, “transitory” and “epiphany” for what seems to be the same stage.\n\nThe fact he keeps changing names one minute after the other makes it confusing.\n\nIt’s a pity because the content he talks about is good and some insights are genius.\n\nSimplistic nomenclature\n\nI can’t help but find this “beta/alpha” “blue pill/red pill” dichotomies too simplistic and, sometimes, used in child-like fashion (such as: “you don’t agree, so you’re a blue-pill dipshit”).\n\nVery bad mindsets for relationships\n\nRollo is convinced his books are helping men (he says “saving lives”).\n\nBut I’m slightly worried that for each “saved life” there is an adversarial, toxic relationship looming.\n\nPROS\n\nI have a long list of criticism for “The Rational Male Volume 2” as you can see.\n\nBut that’s not to say there isn’t a lot of great wisdom in here. As a matter of fact, there is a lot of great wisdom and deep analysis:\n\nThe analysis on “social conventions” is genius and spot on\n\nRollo’s analysis of the dynamics of shaming as an ego-protection is superb stuff\n\nTop notch analysis of female and society’s social shaming of men (for example: to provide and accept her wild past)\n\nEye-opening analysis of the diverging interests of women and men, together with the cultural struggle that ensues (but keep in mind Rollo only focuses on one side of the equation)\n\nSuper funny -and deep- analysis of “Lean-In” by Salzberg (with which I wholeheartedly agree)\n\nREVIEW\n\nLet’s start with a personal take on the author:\n\nAnd now back on the book:\n\n“Preventive Medicine” is powerful medicine.\n\nBut it cuts both ways.\n\nIncluding the downsides of many drugs.\n\nIt reminds me of how the heroine was marketed as a “cure” for cough.\n\n“Preventive Medicine” is somewhat similar: it (effectively) “cures” the patient of Pollyannish views of dating and relationships while potentially infecting him with misogyny.\n\nIn short:\n\n“Preventive Medicine Book 2” can open your eyes if you’re a beginner.\n\nAnd it can harm your relationships and views on women if you’re advanced enough to have good win-win relationships.\n\nLuckily, this review is here to help.\n\nCheck the:\n\nBest red pill books collection"
