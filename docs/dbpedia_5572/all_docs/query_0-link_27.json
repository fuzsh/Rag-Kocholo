Yes, women. Because they are the only ones making that decision, to the (proud) exception of anything a man might say about it.\n\nWomen get indignant about men ever presuming to have a vested interest in her reproductive choices, so yeah, you own everything that goes with it.\n\nAnd yes, men should have a say in your reproductive choices when you are the sole arbiter of life & death.\n\nIn B4, âBut WHAT ABOUT MEN?! REEEEE?!â\n\nOnce the sperm leaves a manâs body he has 0% authority in anything after that. Abortion is eugenics. Women have determined the reproductive direction of western society since the Sexual Revolution. Yes, men should have a say in that.\n\nâWe have shifted from a Marriage based model of raising children to a Child Support based model of raising children.â - Dalrock\n\nI didn't plan on making a big deal out of this, but we've reached a point where abortion ceased to be a 'necessary evil for women making a tough decision' and has become a point of pride where women \"feel like God\" in aborting a man's child:\n\nAll the previous era's sensitivity women expected from men about abortion goes right out the window when an abortion becomes an element of women's hubris.\n\nNow you're gonna get the unvarnished truth about 'your' decisions.\n\nMissing some Tweet in this thread?

The Gestalt Masculine prevailed over the sure-thing, âher turnâ presumed victory of the Gestalt Feminine.\n\nRead 16 tweets\n\nInstagram conditions women to have unrealistic expectations about sex and men, and fundamentally alters their brains so they can no longer enjoy sex with ânormalâ men.\n\nInstagram is therefore not free speech and should be banned for the sake of perpetuating the human race.\n\nImagine thinking the Founding Fatherâs wrote the first amendment to protect Instagram, Eat-Pray-Love and 50 Shades of Grey.\n\nJust LOL\n\nClearly, by the careful consideration of the very astute gentlemen in this thread, @getongab must also consider Instagram and Snapchat discussions, imagery and Thotery as pornographic and therefore subject to its ban on porn. Clearly this is not âprotected speechâ, right?\n\nRead 4 tweets\n\nLadies, you must unlearn that which youâve learned.\n\nâ¢ Understand that solipsism is part of your evolved mental firmware.\n\nâ¢ Understand that youâve been conditioned to feel that men and any opinion they have are irrelevant to your being.\n\nâ¢ Understand you were taught men should serve you and be thankful you gave them the opportunity to do so.\n\nâ¢ Understand that this social order is predicated on the female experience superseding, and being more legitimate, than the male experience.\n\nâ¢ Understand that Hypergamy and your innate self-interest are being fed by a social order that profits on your self-absorption â only to discard you when you figure out the game too late in life.\n\nRead 5 tweets\n\nRelated threads\n\n@CNNSotu Oddly, you discuss #eugenics in America in the 1920s, but you never mention #MargaretSanger, the founder of @PPFA, and her approval of #GermanEugenicSterilzation, #KKK, and other efforts to eliminate the production of offspring by the #unfit.\n\nI say, \"oddly\" with respect to your omission because Sanger's love affair with #eugenics ran so deeply through her activism that it constituted a part of the masthead of her \"Birth Control Review.\"\n\nSanger didn't pull punches about the intended use of #eugenic #sterilization:\n\n\"There is only one reply to a request for a higher birthrate among the intelligent, and that is to ask the government to first take off the burdens of the insane and the feeble-minded from your backs.\"\n\nRead 7 tweets\n\nNot sure what thread you're reading. In the one I wrote, I brought up a few possible solutions to get people thinking, and then said that if you don't like my ideas, you can suggest your own:\n\nOther ideas/solutions I've shared:\n\n- A public opinion campaign to shift the conversation from stopping abortion to preventing unwanted pregnancies.\n\n- A media focus on studies that prove easily available birth control reduces unwanted pregnancies (and therefore abortion).\n\n- A public opinion campaign to help men recognize how dangerous their sperm is, and that they must be incredibly careful with their bodily fluids.\n\n- Fund programs that make condoms as available, affordable, and commonplace as toilet paper.\n\nRead 15 tweets\n\nAnd you call yourself a feminist.\n\nPlease take a minute and ask yourself why you donât seem to have room in your feminism for ppl who need more than one abortion (and who arenât ashamed). There are all kinds of reasons ppl might need >1 abortion (I feel a thread coming on).\n\nPpl who can get #pregnant can spend >35 years of reproductive life trying not to get pregnant. If typical use failure rates for #contraceptive methods like the pill or patch are ~9%, youâre almost inevitably going to have at least one failure in a lifetime.\n\nEven if ppl have an average # of children, thatâs still 30+ years of needing reliable #birthcontrol to avoid pregnancy.\n\nRead 17 tweets\n\nTrending hashtags\n\nEmbed code for your website:"
