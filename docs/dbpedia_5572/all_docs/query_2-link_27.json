        "text": "UK heavyweights of misery, the intense & visceral TURIN (formerly This Is Turin), have unveiled their latest single 'Hopeless Solutions' from their upcoming album The Unforgiving Reality In Nothing, scheduled for release via MNRK Heavy on 12th July. This single offers an unapologetic look into the brutal truths of the human experience, delving into themes of mental health, the erosion of faith, and the arduous journey of releasing trauma in a fervent pursuit of self-discovery.\n\nTURIN says, \"‘Hopeless Solutions’ is a brutal & uncompromising anti-establishment death metal anthem, that focuses on how twisted and broken humanity has become. The feeling of fighting tooth and nail to defy corruption, greed and tyranny but ultimately failing as history repeats itself.”\n\nWatch here: https://youtu.be/xyFq4onavS0\n\nStream and pre-order the record here: https://turin.ffm.to/theunforgivingrealityinnothingalbum\n\nThe upcoming album The Unforgiving Reality In Nothing promises a soul-crushing, savage, and remarkably abrasive musical experience. Seamlessly weaving through beautifully poignant symphonic death metal, hauntingly melancholic deathcore, and technically bold post-metal, TURIN have crafted a sonic landscape meant to be traversed. Each track presents a unique perilous journey, from the relentless onslaught of 'Abyssal' to the desolate introspection of 'Reflections,' the contemplative intensity of 'I Am The Truth,' and the raw power of 'Loss.' With each ebb and flow, listeners are drawn deeper into the abyss, culminating in the poignant finale 'Our Reality In Nothing,' a fusion of lush strings and crushing riffs that stands as the band's most personal and impactful composition to date. This track embodies a culmination of dark emotions, infused with the collective experiences and realisations of all five members, encapsulating the essence of existing within emptiness and finding solace in it. It is a creation that is both ethereal and grounded in reality, offering both escapism and a profound awakening.\n\nTeaming up with their trusted collaborator Mike Bennett at Fox Hound Studio, as well as enlisting the expertise of esteemed UK heavy metal producer and multiple Heavy Music Awards nominee Lewis Johns (known for his work with bands like Loathe, Rolo Tomassi, Ithaca, Employed To Serve, Svalbard, Conjurer and Pupil Slicer), TURIN sought to refine their sound and elevate their artistic vision to new heights. The outcome is a creation unlike any previous endeavour by the band, showcasing a fresh and innovative direction in their musical evolution.\n\nInfluenced by a diverse range of extreme music subgenres, TURIN are known for their bludgeoning live shows, earning them Kerrang’s MCN Live Award with appearances at the UK’s top festivals such as Bloodstock Open Air and Tech Fest plus supports with Martyr Defiled, Decapitated, Within Destruction, Hacktivist, Ingested, SikTh, Origin, Dragged Into Sunlight and a collab with Thy Art Is Murder’s CJ McMahon on 2020's ‘Misery’.\n\nTurin are:\n\nVocals: Darryl Jones\n\nGuitar: David Langford\n\nGuitar: Anthony Hayden\n\nBass: James Kinnear\n\nDrums: Ben Adcroft\n\nTurin online:\n\nwww.facebook.com/thisisturin\n\nwww.instagram.com/thisisturin\n\nwww.tiktok.com/@turinofficial"
