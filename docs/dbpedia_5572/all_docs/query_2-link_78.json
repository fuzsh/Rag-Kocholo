In other words, Sam, she’s checked out of the relationship because she sees you as needy.” Ouch! Wait a minute! All these years I’m paid to sound like the Man, I interview the A-list at The Oscars, I’m invited to the after parties, my life is fun, billionaires regularly meet with me to pick my brain, women find me attractive, I’m unusually successful and I’m on the list everywhere, so how could this happen to me? Because of choices made in my line of work, I was immune to a woman checking out of a relationship like that since I’m an outlier, right? Rollo would say, “It’s about Sexual Market Value Sam. You went from being an outlier because of notoriety, to a man on your back in inpatient care. You stopped acting like that Man, so she sees you like a girlfriend that she doesn’t even like.” The Rational Male explained what I, and millions of other men do and have done to cause a woman that once had genuine desire for us to check out of the relation-ship… and what to do about it. This book is contains that knowledge and wisdom. It’s THAT powerful. I’m that voice you’ve heard a thousand times. Movies, trailers, radio spots. In all my years as a voice actor, I’ve never read anyone’s work that sounded like my movie trailer voice, until I read the first essays at therationalmale.com.\n\nThe words of Tomassi felt like I feel when I’m putting myself into the script because that’s how to change the course of world events through a blockbuster film. I know of no one that’s read The Rational Male who isn’t transformed by it. If someone has handed this book to you, that person is loyal to you and loves you. It’s real. Never forget that. This book is going to transform everything in your life into a better state. In our times too many men are committing suicide because the woman he loves has lost her genuine desire for him. This book is the quintessential work that has it all; it’s the full experience that’s been proven to prevent those suicides. It’s not a motivational seminar, it’s not a meditation retreat, it’s simple truth mined from almost 15 years of observations and deep discussions among millions of men. You’ve heard those people say that they can’t wait until they get on the other side so they can have all their questions answered. Forget that. This powerful resource has answers like that… answers that have been intentionally hidden from you through all of your education, entertainment, family, friends and life. Know this now: You are going to be bothered by some of what you read. You’re a man, you can deal with it. You’re A Man. You will deal with it. The concepts in it are so powerful, I challenge you to complete this book within three days. Then, read it again, slowly. I have this book my Uncle gave me while I was in college. He’s passed away now, but I still carry that little book I Dare You first published 90 years ago by William H. Danforth. I carry it with me wherever I go. The Rational Male is like that.\n\nHe doesn’t write for money. He’s doing this to make the world a better place to live. He writes because he wants you to make the most of yourself. Though he could afford a major marketing and branding campaign, nothing has been spent on either. It all started with helping one person, now, through his blog and his first book, more than seven million have experienced the kind of change that enhances every aspect of life. There is no doubt that you’ll become as obsessed with absorbing this material - and spreading it as I am. I’m honored to have been asked to write this forward. This material has changed the course of my life. My ‘nice guy’ ways needed something more. Success, status may attract her, but without a guide, without a map, there’s no way 99% of men will continue to spark her genuine desire. It’s worked for me and for everyone I’ve introduced to it. It’s saved me from further heartbreak in life from relationships with women. Married men tell me the nightmares in their lives with wives that no longer see the value in emotional connection through the wonder of sexual intercourse. I tell them that would be misery, and I refer them to the work of Rollo Tomassi. This book is written by a man that’s become a close friend. I admire him like I admire my heart transplant surgeon brother. My brother has such precise mastery of his art that heart surgeons around the world utilize new techniques he discovered. When most surgeons follow his lead, more lives are saved each year. Rollo Tomassi has such mastery of his art that it’s improving the lives of millions of people around the world. He’s personally counseled me for free, and to men that are sincerely trying to learn the truths and wisdom he writes about, he counsels them for free as well. And this advice isn’t the standard advice that will cause you to further damage your relationship with that special someone. This advice works. I’m living proof. I’ve enjoyed the benefits of unusual success. My work has influenced the lives and habits of millions of people each year. Through all of it, I’ve realized that the work I do using an alias gives people what they want, and some things that people want may not be best for them. So my sharing this\n\nbook with you is also a way for me to make up for the influence some of my work has spread during my career. Rollo Tomassi is the only author I know who’s unplugging men from “The Matrix” effectively. Why does Rollo Tomassi not use his real name? The material is simply too powerful, and that can be dangerous. As I’ve stated, I’m known for parts of my work, but certainly not all of it. None of it is immoral, it’s just that the spotlight would be too bright if the world knew. I was in college, walking with a few sorority girls that were talking about how this other guy was a jerk and why couldn’t he be a nice guy. I said, “I’m a nice guy,” and they all laughed. I didn’t understand that because I was reared to be nice. Have you ever been blindsided by a break-up, then, the next time someone broke up with you, you wanted answers. When I found Rational Male, I had been blindsided by another breakup. I wasn’t going to go to a PUA (Pick Up Artist) seminar, and anything you could buy as a book had advice that was mainly about getting in touch with my feminine side. No matter what success I’ve had, I could never “just get it” when it came to keeping a woman attracted in a long-term relationship. I get it now.\n\nSam Botta Voice Actor, Radio Personality Burbank, California – 2015 ***\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAt the time of my writing this volume my first book, The Rational Male, is less than a year old. It was certainly an effort in experimentation to say the least. There were a lot of issues I hadn’t foreseen – font size issues, editing and grammatical issues, conversion to a digital format (twice) – and that was just with the book itself. I had severely underestimated the popularity of a digital format, and how most readers enjoy a book on their eReaders, especially in countries where an Amazon printed copy was hard to come by. Despite all of these issues, and in under a year, The Rational Male has become a success. Not because it increased the readership and popularity of the blog, nor because it’s still selling briskly, but because it has accomplished what I’d hoped it would. I had hoped to reach a broader readership by putting these ideas, literally, into the hands of men who would otherwise dismiss them from a blog link. I wanted something tangible for men (and women) to share with other men. I purposely kept it as affordable as Amazon would allow so the book might be carried into a coffee house or on an airplane, where hopefully the title would spark a discussion – even if just from scoffing at the title. I’m often asked why I put so much effort into the printed version, particularly since the digital sales regularly exceed those of the printed book. I’ll admit that my artistic sense and design background had a need to be satisfied, but I wanted a book for the ‘everyman’ – one that a guy working in a garage might find accessible, or one a soldier deployed in a very unfamiliar, inhospitable place might take along with him.\n\nYou can’t delete a book. You can burn a book, shred it or otherwise physically destroy that book, but you have to take it into your hands to do so. As melodramatic as this sounds, I fear that there may be a day when the authorities of digital publishing will become the authorities of permissible information. Deleting a book would be as simple as a keystroke. I had actually intended this volume to be a standalone digital format book, however my sense of aesthetics, and a small bit of wanting to hold another book in my own hands won out. Of course there is a digital version to make it accessible, you may even be reading it now, but bear in mind that books and the ideas contained within are meant to be discussed – or at least that’s how I’d intend these ideas.\n\nTerminologies In The Rational Male I presented the core concepts of what I consider Red Pill Thought. A lot of people in, and familiar with, the collectively male blog-space known as the ‘manosphere’ understand what “the red pill” is – a euphemism, courtesy of the Matrix movies, for a revelation of truth in a system that’s kept them blind to that truth. For most people with fresh eyes to the manosphere this sounds exactly like the schlock they’ve come to expect from online communities. Using movie references, in-group jingoisms, and cryptic acronyms seems par for the course, but it’s important to remember that new concepts demand new terminologies. It’s kind of hard to ask a new reader to try and read past these terms for the first time. A common complaint is a lack of reference for these terms or acronyms, and in the interests of helping the fresh eyes I’ve included an appendix of sorts at the end of the book to accommodate these new readers. That said, it’s important to bear in mind that terms, references and acronyms serve the purpose of labeling and outlining more broad or abstract concepts.\n\nFor instance one large point of contention most men unfamiliar with the manosphere or Red Pill thought chafe against is the concept, and categorization, of Alpha and Beta men. I dedicated a long section of The Rational Male to outlining and defining my interpretation of what constitutes the characteristics of both these types of men, and predictably, it often confuses or angers men’s ego-protection instinct. And just as predictably, an otherwise productive discussion of a broader idea becomes mired in an endless (sometimes hopeless) defining of mutually acceptable terms. In this volume of Rational Male, bear in mind that terms ‘Alpha’ or ‘Beta’ or any other term you might find esoteric are meant to be placeholders for abstract concepts. While I’ve attempted to minimize the manospherespecific references and jingoism, there will still be instances of core concepts that are just simpler to describe in terms of ‘Alpha’ or ‘Beta’ in order to outline a larger dynamic – or in this book’s case, how a man will be categorized by women at specific phases of her (and his own) maturation. So, I humbly ask that any new reader struggling with these terms for the first time refer to The Rational Male for more specific definitions. This volume will presume you’re familiar with the ideas I put forth in The Rational Male, so con-sider this book an accompaniment to the core concepts therein. Why I wrote this book Around mid-March of 2014 I endeavored to write a series of articles called Preventative Medicine on the Rational Male blog. I did so with the hope of providing my readers with a chronological outline of what to expect from women at various phases of women’s maturation throughout their lives. Consequently, this series was prompted by a 2010 article posted on the Château Heartiste blog titled The Difficulty Of Gaming Women By Age Bracket. In that post Roissy breaks down the pick-up artistry involved in using Game at various phases of women’s lives and how best to capitalize on what can usually be expected of western(ized) women.\n\nI had read this post when it was first published and bookmarked it. It seemed like a seminal post from Roissy at the time and I’ve referenced it in various posts on my own blog occasionally. However, as I kept referring back to it I never really made the connection as to how women’s lives (and by association men’s lives) tended to follow a somewhat predictable series of phases. For a pick up artist, interested in maximizing his lay-count, the utility of knowing what to expect from a woman in a certain age demographic, culture (or subculture) and socioeconomic tier is fairly obvious – know your quarry, adapt your approach. Something clicked for me after referring back to this article so often when I was doing consults for various men seeking advice about a specific woman and the circumstances they found themselves dealing with. As ever, one of the most common regrets (if that’s the word) men relate to me is that they wish they’d had the information I’ve offered in The Rational Male and on the blog when they were younger so as to have avoided some debilitating, life-affecting decision with a woman. It’s usually either that or some regret about the present situation they find themselves in and how horrible and regrettable the truth of the Red Pill has been for them. It occurred to me that a more expanded version of a ‘what to expect with a woman at this age’ post might be in order. This then developed into the four part series of Preventative Medicine articles, as well as being the inspiration for more than a few follow-up posts that further expanded understanding the “time line” of women’s life progressions. The problem I ran into was that providing such an exhaustive outline for my online readership tends to be a test of their attention spans. I think one of the biggest obstacles to really understanding a blog post’s point is the ‘tl;dr’ phenomenon – “too long; didn’t read.” This wall-of-text a commenter painstakingly typed out may be a hidden gem of philosophical brilliance, but in one swift ‘tl;dr’ act of desperation all that brilliance is distilled to a plea to a readers internet attention deficit disorder by summing it up in an easily digestible info-bite at the end.\n\nSo, in order to avoid overloading my readers with too much at once, it seemed like the best idea would be to break this progression down into a series of four (albeit long) posts to cover the ‘points of interest’ adequately. The reader response to this series exceeded anything I could’ve foreseen. To say the comments were insightful would be an understatement. Many different perspectives were expressed, but all had more to add to the progression and all made an attempt to address some particular aspect of the progression (and what men might expect at that point in the progression) that they felt was vital to a full understanding of women at various stages of maturity. I had men in every demographic adding their understanding to the collective purpose of providing other men with what they’ve experienced and what to possibly expect at that phase of life. Young men of 18 would relate their frustrations with having to deal with breakups after graduating high school and being torn between going to a university they thought was best for them or transferring to the school their ‘soul mate’ high school girlfriend was going to attend in order to maintain (or rescue) the relationship. Alternatively, I had men in their mid-sixties relate stories about the circumstances that led to their divorces and the issues they’d experienced in dealing with their ex-wives and the older (and younger) women they were dating at a time of their lives in which they never thought they’d be dating again. After the second installment of this series one of my regular readers and Christian-manosphere blogger, Donalgraeme commented the following: “Its amazing, when you consider it, to think of the various social constructs/conventions built up to support this female model of development. At each and every stage there are a slew of different organizations and support sources that encourage women along every step of the path. It would be a good thing to map them out, actually. You know, to peg different sources to different time periods in the ‘life\n\npath.’ Starting from Teen magazines and the Disney channel all the way to various middle-age celebrity and gossip mags.” This planted the germ of the idea that’s developed into the book you now hold in your hands. So it’s with this in mind that I set out to detail as best I could a chronological time line in which men might be better prepared to understand and develop ways to deal with the particulars a woman would be experiencing at various phases of her life. Furthermore, I’ve endeavored to a marginal degree to account for outlying variables and experiences that may modify the more predictable aspects of women’s phases of life. Obviously I couldn’t exhaustively account for every circumstance, but I’ve attempted to address how the most common decision women make at these various stages affect the later phases, and then how men might best prepare contingencies for, or avoid entirely, the consequences of associating with the women making those decisions. This time line wouldn’t be complete unless I also factored in the social conventions erected around each of these phases and how they modify, affirm or attempt to absolve the personal and social ramifications implicit to each phase. As such I’ve addressed the most common social conventions men might expect to encounter during these phases of women’s maturation. I’ll point out now that my individual effort to make this time line is in no way intended to be comprehensive. I wouldn’t presume to be so thorough in my scope here to think I’m going to cover every aspect of this maturation process – I’m simply providing you with my best estimate as drawn from my own experiences and those of the men who’ve shared theirs with me over the course of my time writing in the manosphere. As with the first Rational Male book, I ask that you understand I’m a connector of dots – I leave it to my readers to see the bigger picture. I expect most men reading this work will disagree with certain aspects of my outlines of these phases as they apply to their own circumstances with\n\nthe women they interact with personally. Some phases may not seem relevant to a particular phase men find themselves in presently, but may be relevant in their future. Other men will likely nod in ascension or shake their heads knowingly when I cover a phase they’ve experienced personally. For all these men, understand that my purpose, as with all my writing, is to better inform men what they might expect at various phases of their own lives, why those expectations are likely and how best to prepare accordingly for them. How to read this book In the introduction of The Rational Male I made mention of a reader, Jacquie, who’s son she said was in need of being made aware of the ideas I’d written about online for over a decade. The point being her hope was that what I’d written might help him avoid bad life decisions based on his unfortunate, feminine-conditioned mindset. My intent is much the same for this book as well, however, I’ve tried to be more comprehensive in outlining situations that apply to women at significant stages of their maturity. In doing so my intent for men is to help them not to simply avoid making bad future decisions, but to aid them in understanding what they’ve experienced up to the point of their particular circumstances with women in the now. The purpose of this book is to help you better understand the circumstances of what’s led up to whatever part of this time line you find yourself on, what you’re currently experiencing with a woman (or potential women) and what you might expect from women at future points of their maturation. The Time Line The first thing you’ll be aware of is the time line graph I’ve established to help you get a visual grasp of various phases of women’s maturity. At certain points along this time line I detail what I believe are the most prominent periods of situational change, crisis, personal insight (both\n\nconvenient and genuine) and the psychological and belief changes women most commonly pass through. Also along this graph I’ve placed sub-periods of how I believe women prioritize the importance of what they find attractive, arousing and generally filter for in men during different parts of their maturation. Though this aspect of the time line has definite (Game) applications for men in adjusting how they might best appeal to women in these phases, my purpose in adding these sub-periods is to illustrate the ‘how’s’ and the ‘whys’ that motivate many of the decisions women are prone to make during these phases. I’ve broken the time line down into four sections in four corresponding chapters; late adolescence through early adulthood, early twenties through early thirties, mid-life, and later life. The temptation of course will be for readers to skip ahead to phases a man might be currently experiencing at his own point of personal circumstance, but I’ll urge you to read the chapters in order. Your understanding of a particular personal crisis, or why you might be enjoying a better relationship earlier or later in life, are more or less contingent upon the general path a woman might take during her maturation to get to the point you’re experiencing now. By all means, go back and re-read certain sections later, but getting a general understanding of the maturation process, and what may or may not apply to a particular personal situation is necessary first. The Sexual Market Value Graph Many of the significant periods I detail in the time line also correspond with my now infamous sexual market value (SMV) graph. I introduced this very generalized graph in The Rational Male in the chapter, Navigating the SMP (sexual marketplace). I’ve included it in this volume as well for convenience sake as I refer to it to illustrate certain points in women’s maturation. If you haven’t read this particular chapter from the first book\n\nI’d encourage you to do so as it will help your understanding of those references. Social Conventions Following the outline of each phase of maturity, I’ll cover what I’ve found to be the most common social conventions a feminine-primary social order has established to justify, affirm or excuse the experiences and decisions women make during these phases – as well as to be used to condition men to be accommodating of that feminine-primacy. While each phase has operative social conventions unique to that stage of a woman’s maturity, there are some that span several. Furthermore, some conventions affect the consequences, outcomes or even the likely occurrence of women subscribing to other conventions that follow from an earlier originating convention. Needless to say accounting for every eventuality that comes from these conventions is not really feasible to outline, but the overall progression of those conventions is the important point. With a good overview men will have the tools to better grasp the progression of conventions, and the present convention, that color and influence the circumstances of a particular woman at her phase of maturity. Outliers In the interests of being as thorough as I can I’ve added some considerations for what I refer to as outliers at various parts of each section. These end notes are meant to account for some of the more common outlying personal situations which women may experience that, for whatever reason, may disqualify women from following the more predictable paths a certain phase of maturity will generally predispose most women to. In most instances these outliers don’t change a woman’s larger experience of the phase of maturity, but the outlying circumstances and decisions a\n\nwoman makes often modify the progression. In addition, these outliers also create or modify social conventions to accommodate, affirm (often with male participation) and absolve the consequences of the decisions women make as a result of those outlying circumstances. Book II – Supporting Chapters Finally, I’ve added several supporting chapters I hope will answer some of the more common questions and issues that will inevitably follow for certain, significant phases of this time line. Most of these topics originated as follow-up posts on The Rational Male blog, but I’ve reviewed and reconsidered many aspects of those posts and felt they deserved a greater mention in the whole of this work. Many of these support chapters directly reflect or help explain the various dynamics of a particular phase, while others present a broader perspective that may span several, or sometimes all, phases of maturation. I selected these particular sections with the consideration that they serve a cautionary or informative purpose that will help men to grasp the larger aspects of the time line itself. I’ve included most of this support in the second half of the book (Book II), but I’ve begun with the chapter Understanding Hypergamy because I feel this very base-nature dynamic serves as the cornerstone for every man to really come to terms with feminine nature. It is my sincere hope that this work will benefit your personal situation and interactions with the same impact and gravity that The Rational Male provided men with. As I began in the first book, I consider myself a connector of dots; and for the most part I always make an earnest attempt to present my ideas in as honest an observation as I’m able. So once again I’ll stress that The Rational Male – Preventive Medicine is not intended to be the final, definitive word on any of the issues or phases you’ll read hereafter. This volume is not intended to be comprehensive, but\n\nrather an outline to prompt even further discussion and understanding of these phases of maturity. As with everything I write, you’ll likely grate against and disagree with various aspects of what I describe, and later some aspect will resonate so strongly with you that you’ll only be able to shake your head at yourself for not having considered it in the same light when you first experienced that aspect with a woman at that phase of maturity. This is the intent of this book. I want you to be angry. I want you to nod in agreement and shake your head when you don’t. I want you have questions and I certainly want you to consider the validity of what you’re about to read and how they apply to your past, present and future interactions with women – as well as how they might apply to men you know or are related to who have yet to experience them. It’s only preventive medicine if you can pass along the warning. I’m always flattered when readers think I’m some phenomenal interpreter of psychology, the nature of women, intergender relations and a model upon which men should aspire to in order to get laid and still have a great (now 18 year) marriage. I honestly wish I was that guy, but that’s not Rollo Tomassi. I’m a student of life just as much as you likely are, and as such I understand the value of knowing that I know nothing really. These are my observations. They are not cannon, they are not law. So with this in mind I ask again in this book that you read with an open mind and with any luck we’ll both become better men (and women) for the time you consider these observations. As always, I’m as accessible as a comment on The Rational Male blog or a quick email (on my About page) if you have any questions or maybe a consideration you think I haven’t considered. Rollo Tomassi – February 2015\n\n***\n\nBOOK I ***\n\n“Why do my eyes hurt?” “You’ve never used them before.” ***\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nUNDERSTANDING HYPERGAMY ***\n\nYOUR FRIEND MENSTRUATION\n\nThere are methods and social contrivances women have used for centuries to ensure that the best male’s genes are selected and secured with the best male provisioning she’s subjectively capable of attracting. Ideally the best Man should exemplify the best of both aspects, but rarely do the two exist in the same male (particularly these days), so in the interest of achieving her biological imperative, and prompted by an innate need for security, the feminine as a whole needed to develop social conventions and methodologies (which change as her environment and personal conditions do) to effect optimizing women’s innate Hypergamy. Years ago, when I was writing the post that would become the Schedules of Mating chapter of my first book, my emphasis was on how an evolved dynamic (female pluralistic sexual strategy) translated into evolved social dynamics (feminine primary social conventions). My focus then was on how the feminine creates and normalizes social conditions that favor Hypergamy by covertly manipulating social expectations – not only of the men who would optimize that Hypergamy, but also for women themselves in how their own self-rationalizations (hind-brain, hamsters) can be socially justified. I wrote the post Schedules of Mating in 2005 (on SoSuave) in an effort to explain the rudiments of Hypergamy in a more accessible way for guys who were still struggling with understanding why women would say they wanted “a Nice guy with a good heart” yet would, in stark contradiction of this, behaviorally opt for Bad Boy-Jerks as their sexual partners of choice. I still think it’s a pretty good essay, which is why I revised and included it in the earliest posts at Rational Male. However, even at the time I was writing, I knew that the concept of an evolved Hypergamy and its social implication still had a lot more under the hood to explore.\n\nBiological Hypergamy The following is a quote from a 2008 study on hormones and brain activity from the Kinsey Institute. “One area of the brain in which we observed a difference in activation in response to masculinized versus feminized faces — specifically during the follicular phase — was the anterior cingulate cortex, which is a region involved in decision-making and the evaluation of potential reward and risk,” said neuroscientist Heather Rupp, research fellow at the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction. “Activation in this region has been previously reported to correlate with ‘high risk’ nonsocial choices, specifically monetary risk, so it is interesting that it is observed to be more active in response to masculinized male faces, who may be both riskier but more rewarding to women.” There are a multitude of studies that indicate women’s sexual preference for facial characteristics shift depending on their menstrual phase. These fluctuating preferences are thought to reflect evolutionarily founded changes in women’s reproductive priorities. Around the time of ovulation women prefer more masculinized faces — faces with features that indicate high levels of testosterone. These facial cues predict high genetic quality in the male because only such males can afford the immune system-compromising effects of testosterone. Testosterone may be costly for the males’ mates as well because high testosterone levels also are associated with high rates of offspring abandonment. Around the time of ovulation, a female’s preference apparently shifts from avoiding negligent parenting to acquiring the best genes for her offspring. This principle is known in evolutionary psychology as Ovulatory Shift. At other points during the cycle, women will prefer more feminized male faces, as they might signal a higher willingness of the males to invest in\n\noffspring. If you’ll pardon the vernacular, what Ovulatory Shift represents in a social con-text is what’s known in the manosphere as the Alpha Fucks and Beta Bucks principle; the drive for an optimization between the best direct genetic benefit (sex) and the best indirect benefit (parental investment and provisioning) is a biologically hard-wired feature of the female mind. Studies like this aren’t unknown to the manosphere, and even the early Pickup Artist (PUA) teachers had an almost instinctual understanding of how a woman’s ovulatory cycle could affect a guy’s odds of a successful hookup without ever having read them. Needless to say, there’s a plethora of practical applications a man might develop with a firm knowledge of how a woman’s hormonal cycle affects her mood, her susceptibility to his influence and how her post-sex rationalization will be altered as a result of the particular phase of her menstrual cycle she happens to be in. In his Blue Pill years, I think a lot of what accounts for a guy’s sporadic successes with women can be attributed to the woman’s ovulatory phase and favorable circumstance. Right phase, right place, right time and a guy who gave off just enough subconscious masculine prompts and Alpha cues to get the lay – or the brief girlfriend status until her subsequent follicular phase peaked and he wasn’t the ‘Alpha’ she thought he was three weeks prior.\n\nThe Alpha Phase From a Game perspective, using the above illustration as a guide, the latter half of the follicular (proliferative) phase – the period between day 7 to about day 14 – might be called the Alpha Phase for Men. The Kinsey study (and many similar ones) would indicate that this 7 (maybe 10) day window predisposes women to (Alpha) masculinized sexual influence and would be the optimal period for a man to make a lasting Alpha impression. Sexual tingles are most commonly born in the proliferative phase. It’s during this phase women are more predisposed to sexual ornamentation (dressing sexy) and vocal intonation changes, masculine body odor becomes more appealing and an overall preference for masculinized physical attributes (muscularity) intensifies as arousal cues for her in men. Female biochemistry and its resultant behavior patterns shift in the proliferative phase to optimize breeding potential with the ‘Best Genes’\n\n(direct benefit) male a woman has, or makes avail-able to herself by subconscious design. I’ve caught a lot of grief in the past from angry women for suggesting that all women have an ‘inner slut’, and that all a guy need do is be the right man at the right time to bring this out in them. An understanding of the behavioral changes of Ovulatory Shift during women’s menstrual cycle punctuates this. The hot coed on spring break in Cancun who fucks the cute guy in the foam cannon party is most likely in her proliferative phase. Add alcohol and you’ve got the chemical formula for sexual urgency – even from the ‘good girl‘. When she thinks or says “I don’t know what came over me, I’m not usually like this” she’s observing her proliferative phase behavior from a luteal phase perspective. She really isn’t “like that” the other 21 days of her cycle. It’s during this part of a woman’s cycle that she becomes subconsciously attuned to masculinized traits and makes subliminal efforts to capitalize on her concurrent ovulation. In other words, this is the period in which Hypergamy doesn’t care the most. It’s “fuck me now, I’ll rationalize it out later.” About now you’re probably wondering, “That’s all well and good, but how do I determine what cycle phase a woman is in?” If all a guy was doing was cold approaches with women I could understand the confusion. There are countless ‘tells’ women will display when they are in their proliferative phase. Dr. Martie Hasselton of UCLA has done some excellent studies on female ornamentation coinciding with ovulation and also how women’s vocal pitch shifts lower (sultry voice) during this phase, but if you’re still unconvinced, listen to your gut – men instinctually know when women are in the pro phase of ovulation. In fact, the phenomenon of ‘Mate Guarding’ is a wellstudied dynamic that appears to have evolved in men as a result of a\n\nsubconscious awareness of women’s behavioral cues during the period of their ovulation. If you have the patience to learn, pay better attention to the behaviors of the women in your immediate social circle, or to the behaviors of the girl you think you may want to target at some point. Beta Phase If the proliferate phase is the Alpha Phase for Men, then the luteal phase could be considered the Beta Phase. Again using the Kinsey study, as well as many from Dr. Hasselton as our general guide we can infer that women become drawn to more feminine features in men during the 14 day down side of their cycle. The attributes of attraction (not arousal) that define this stage are associated with comfort, familiarity, empathy, nurturing, etc. meant to reinforce the perception that a man is a good choice for long-term parental investment. Again, this is nothing novel in the manosphere. Even my manosphere colleague, Roissy has written several posts regarding the applied use of Beta-side Game – within context. Far too many men believe the WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) myth about women and their advertised attraction requisites as being predominantly Beta-associative. As I illustrated before, the girl who spontaneously banged the hot guy in the foam cannon party is the same girl who’ll say you need to earn her trust because she needs to be comfortable with you before you have sex. Betaprone men believe this at face value and don’t strike while the iron’s hot (the proliferate phase), wait her out and wonder why they get a, “lets just be friends” at the end of her luteal phase. I think where most Beta men lose the trail is in the belief that Beta attraction is (or should be) synonymous with Alpha arousal. Each of these concepts is representative of a different facet of women’s pluralistic sexual strategy – Hyper-my – Alpha seed, Beta need. Women’s sexual imperatives\n\ncan be defined by the degree to which her short term mating strategy can be justified, or offset, by her long term mating strategy. Nowhere is this disparity more obviously manifested than in the biological reality of a woman’s menstrual cycle that creates it. The Hypergamy Link One aspect of Hypergamy that I’m not certain most men really understand is that the socio-sexual strategy that is Hypergamy is a biological phenomenon in origin. To fully understand the time line I present in this book, it’s important not to confuse Hypergamy with being a social construct (i.e. “marrying up”). Women almost categorically, even deliberately, maintain a strict definition of Hypergamy as only a learned social dynamic. This is more from a need to protect the rationalizations that result from confronting the uncomfortable internal conflict that Hypergamy causes for them. You’ll hear women agonize with them-selves, “why am I not hot for the sweet Beta who’d give me the world, but cannot get enough sex from the hot guy who’s casually indifferent to me?” The Feminine-Primary Social Order The base truth of Hypergamy as a social dynamic is that it is the logical result of women’s innate, hormonal and psychological firmware. This rootlevel disparity of a dualistic sexual strategy (Alpha Fucks / Beta Bucks) led to the evolution of the feminine psyche – to be covert, to be excusably duplicitous, an evolved psychological capacity to be better communicators on more varied levels, but also to be the nurturers necessary to raise the next generation. Without this facility for being beneficially duplicitous on a psychological level, women cannot as effectively optimize their sexual strategy. Since the sexual revolution began, the biological rationale for social feminization has been men’s biological proclivity for violence and\n\naggression. Our biological proclivities make us potentially dangerous. We’re told that we’re poisoned by our testosterone; we’re controlled from youth to repress that in school to the point where teachers expect boys to ‘act out‘, so we drug them. Yet, the biological rationale for Hypergamy could also be said to lie in women’s biological (menstrual) impetus that motivates their sexual pluralism. It is exactly this biological motivation which a feminine-primary social order has been established in the wake of the sexual revolution. As you read through the following time line it’s important to fully grasp the feminine-primary motivators behind the reasoning for the personal and social shifts a woman will experience at various phases of her maturity. Understanding Hypergamy The reason I’m beginning with Hypergamy before we get too involved in this chronology is because it’s important to get a good idea of Hypergamy’s incentives and how they motivate women during these phases. The social aspect and the personal aspect of women’s maturation process hinge upon how Hypergamy influences women’s decision making – and ultimately affects the men who engage with them during those phases of her life. Both the personal and social elements of Hypergamy work in concert to produce a relatively predictable chain of events, personal crises and life decisions throughout a woman’s life. Much of the manosphere likes to define Hypergamy as a woman getting the best bang for her attractiveness buck, but this is only one side of Hypergamy. Using the Alpha Fucks / Beta Bucks principle of women’s dualistic sexual strategy it becomes clear that there is a drive to balance Hypergamy between these two impulses. As I began in Schedules of Mating, Hypergamy wants to have both sides of a woman’s sexual strategy equation\n\nsatisfied by the same man, but rarely is this dualistic satisfaction met in the same individual, and increasingly more men are becoming aware of this strategy. It’s my belief that a drive for hypergamic optimization exists in both the impulse to secure the best genes (sexy son theory – Alpha Fucks) and the best provisioning / emotional investment (parental investment – Beta Bucks) a woman’s attractive-ness can be leveraged for. The problem then is one of leveraging her attractiveness relative to any particular phase of her life and the circumstance that phase dictates for her. Needless to say a woman’s physical conditions, her personal decisions and modern social pressures will influence this ‘balancing act’ (careerism, feminism, religious conviction, etc.), but it’s only half correct to apply Hypergamy only to the Alpha Fucks side of women’s dualistic sexual strategy. Finally, it’s also important to consider that, from an evolutionary standpoint, Hypergamy always seeks an optimization of either side of the AF/BB motives that is better, more advantageous, than any individual woman’s attractiveness should realistically warrant. Hypergamy doesn’t seek its own level; it will always seek a better optimization than a woman’s sexual market value has a realistic expectation to afford her. Also keep in mind that modern social pressures (social media etc.) exacerbate this, and further distort women’s realistic evaluations of their own sexual market value (SMV) at any given phase of her life. The most secure, monogamous attachments women will make are with Men they perceive to be 1 to 2 points above what she perceives is her own relative SMV. I had a Rational Male reader pose the following question on the blog: Knowing what we know about Hypergamy – that it’s inborn and does not give a crap – and also what we know about women’s attraction cues sway-in toward much more Alpha men during ovulation…can men deal with the thought of living with someone who is having to\n\nfight against (presuming she’s fighting against it) a general innate desire to trade up and a specific desire to stray with an Alpha male during ovulation? The short answer to this is yes, in fact men have had socially and psychologically evolved contingencies to mitigate Hypergamy since our hunter-gatherer beginnings. You could even argue that much of our cultural and species-level achievements were the result of men’s latent drives to deal with women’s innate Hypergamy. The common mistake is to presume that Hypergamy’s natural state exists in a vacuum. Hypergamy is not static. The capacity an individual woman possesses to optimize Hypergamy is specific to that woman. There are many complex variables that affect what contributes to a woman’s selfperception of her sexual market valuation. For a general instance, a hot, 22 year old coed will generally be more predisposed to the Alpha Fucks side of her hypergamous impulses because she has a better capacity to capitalize on it than a 44 year old divorced mother of two. Many guys think that Hypergamy requires this endless attending to, but with the exception of outlier women, women will regulate their Hypergamy based on their self-perceived capacity to optimize it. Simply because a woman’s natural state is Hypergamy doesn’t mean she is able to optimize it. She may lack opportunity (i.e. no Alpha men in the right place or at the right time), she may lack the physical appeal, she may have internalized beliefs that cause her to be more self-conscious, she may have self-esteem issues (over and under inflated), or she may simply be acculturated in a society that enforces limits upon her capacity to optimize Hypergamy. All of these limiting conditions contend with her innate hypergamous impulse. This is the primary struggle women face; managing these limiting conditions while contending with a hard-coded Hypergamy, all before facing the inevitable, progression towards her lessened capacity to outperform her sexual competitors. Cash in too early and face the nagging doubt she could’ve consolidated with a more optimal man’s commitment.\n\nCash in too late and live with the consequences of settling for a suboptimal man her looks, personal conditions and societal influences allowed her to consolidate on (Alpha Widows). All of this occurs within the framework of the personal limitations (or benefits) women individually have a capacity for.\n\nHypergamy Unbound One common misunderstanding most men have about Hypergamy is that it requires constant attention to mitigate. Most ‘Men Going Their Own Way’ (MGTOWs) fool-low this logic to some degree, thinking that the effort necessary to contain women’s Hypergamy means this endless mind reading or jumping through behavioral hoops in order to maintain some balance and harmony in any relationship with a woman. They believe the pay off simply isn’t worth the effort, and by their individual case they may be correct, however what they don’t account for is the natural balance that already exists between the genders. Hypergamy is far easier to contain the less a woman is able to capitalize on it. Imposing limitations on women’s Hypergamy is really a matter of application. Why is our reflexive response to label possessive men as ‘insecure’? Because beneath an overt exercising of control we believe a man lacks the capacity to inspire genuine desire in a woman which prompts her to self-regulate her own Hypergamy. Yet, we still consider Mate Guarding behaviors (both conscious and subconscious) to be wise in a measured application. So there you have the line in controlling Hypergamy – like virtually anything else in Game, apply it overtly and you appear ‘insecure’, apply it covertly and you appear confident and in control. To really grasp this you have to also take into account the Alpha/Beta response dynamic. Women’s inborn Hypergamy will predispose women with even the most secure attachment to their mate to shit-test him.\n\nWhen men become aware of this their rational minds see it as insecurity and a nuisance that they will constantly have to deal with. However, nature has engineered into our own psyches the means to deal with these tests in ways we’re not really aware of. I’ve seen the most passive of men put their foot down after a particularly cruel shit-test and basically tell their wives or girlfriends to “shut the fuck up.” It came from exasperation, but that provocation and then the response their woman got for it was exactly the requirement for passing the test. Of course they didn’t realize they were doing it, they were just pissed, lost their temper and usually apologized profusely for acting so brash after the fact. However this was exactly the response Hypergamy needed to confirm that he isn’t a pushover. Mate Guarding is another of these subliminal efforts employed to contain Hyper-gamy. Most men don’t realize that they’re manifesting mateguarding behaviors at exactly the time his woman is ovulating and more aroused by the masculine cues of an unfamiliar Alpha. Her disposition manifests in behaviors that his psyche evolved to register and reflexively trigger his own subconscious mate guarding behaviors – all in a naturalized effort to contain her innate Hypergamy. For men, nature is already aware of Hypergamy and has contingencies to limit it. Ovulatory shift in mate preferences, and the evident behavioral shifts that result from them, prompted an evolved sensitivity to them in men. In turn, this peripheral awareness produced contingency behaviors (mate guarding) to ensure a man wasn’t wasting his parental investment efforts with a child that wasn’t his own. An evolved Mate Guarding sensitivity and contingent strategy was an insurance against the cuckoldry risks inherent in women’s Hypergamous sexual strategy. I would argue that a contingent Mate Guarding strategy evolved not as a direct response to Alpha (or even Beta) competition stresses, but rather due to women’s innate Hypergamy, their sexual pluralism and the potential for\n\nparental investment deception when women were left with their Hypergamy unchecked. If a woman’s predominant perception of you is Alpha, if her mental point of origin is one in which she recognizes her own SMV as being subordinate to your own, she wont be asking your “permission” to go to Las Vegas with her girlfriends for a weekend because her desire for a man she perceives as Alpha (hopefully you) will be stronger than her peers’ influence on her during her ovulation week. In theory, no woman who sees you as her perceived Alpha and Hypergamous best interest will want to ‘cheat’ on you – so the idea doesn’t occur to her. I realize this sounds simplistic until you consider the readiness with which most men will similarly isolate themselves socially, putting off friends and family in preference to spending his time with what he believes is a high-value woman. Another aspect of limiting Hypergamy is the inter-sexual competition women sub-jest each other to. Hypergamy is essentially a race to the top. The higher value resources (high SMV men) drive down the cost (effort) for the lower value ones. The highest value men cascade in value by the frequency of lower value men, but it’s important to remember that Hypergamy doesn’t seek its own level, it always defaults to a better optimization. For a woman, the biological jackpot is to secure a commitment of genetics and resources from a mate who registers higher than herself in SMV valuation. The very nature of Hypergamy has a culling effect for women. As if the pressures to optimize Hypergamy weren’t urgent enough in the light of her personal conditions and the impending expiration of her sexual competitiveness, add to this an unforgiving intersexual competition that mitigates Hypergamy. Thwarting Nature If a guy swings drastically toward the Beta-chump side of the bell curve, this may well trigger a new self-perception for a woman and reinvigorate\n\nher hypergamous impulse. Likewise our current social media experience is contributing to new generations of women who lack any realistic self-image with regard to SMV and thus a false perception of their capacity to optimize their Hypergamy. Women’s overinflated sense of SMV and all the contributing factors to it is a manosphere meme now. All of these factors and more upset the balance of the Feminine Imperative with the masculine and now demand new social and psychological adaptations (i.e. formalized Game). Many a manosphere commenter will tell you how unbound women’s hypergamous nature has become since the rise of feminism and the multigenerational push to feminize every aspect of western culture. While it’s true that Hypergamy “doesn’t care”, and many a man suffers the unprepared consequences of outdated expectations of relational equity, I don’t believe the cultural shift towards the primacy of the Feminine Imperative is the doom of modern society. To be sure, the sexual revolution and feminine-controlled ubiquitous hormonal birth control has radically shifted social primacy to the Feminine Imperative, but what this means is a readjustment of the masculine imperative is now necessary. With the rise of the Internet and the meta-Game that is the manosphere I think we’re seeing this adjustment in its beginnings. In our past, society and nature evolved ways to contain Hypergamy in ways we’re only peripherally aware of today, but they were serviceable contingencies that kept Hypergamy in check. That balance will return eventually, either by men opting out of the traditional measures or women coming to a generational realization of the predicament unbridled Hypergamy and the consequences of the falsehoods fem-centrism has brought to their mothers and grandmothers. ***\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nPREVENTIVE MEDICINE PART I ***\n\nSMV GRAPH\n\nTHE FORMATIVE YEARS\n\nIf what we refer to as Red Pill awareness has a lasting effect of any future significance, my hope is that this awareness becomes preventive medicine for young men’s feminine conditioning of today. This Red Pill awareness for men is the single greatest threat to the Feminine Imperative and feminine social primacy. I’ve covered aspects of this prevention in many posts on The Rational Male blog, but most were more of an after-the-fact perspective from more mature men’s experiences, and how they wish they’d have known earlier in life about the Red Pill, Game and the intergender dynamics I’ve written about over the past 12 years of my writing. When I originally wrote the post Navigating the SMP (sexual marketplace) on the blog and introduced the comparative sexual market value (SMV) chart I had no idea how influential, as well as relatively accurate, it would\n\nbe in the manosphere and beyond that arena. My hope then was to educate, in a tongue-in-cheek way, a younger generation of Red Pill men about the basic schedule of how men and women’s sexual market value waxes and wanes during the various phases of each sex’s lifetime. This post – and more than few subsequent ones – was prompted by the desire to have an outline of what young men could generally anticipate in a contemporary, and westernized, gender landscape. Critics of that SMV outline simplistically dismiss it as just an effort in the wishful thinking of older men convincing themselves they possess a higher sexual market value than they really warrant. However, the salient message of that graph is an uncomfortable exposing of the strategies women use in optimizing Hyper-gamy over the course of their lifetimes. When considered chronologically, many identifiable patterns become apparent both in women’s motivations and behaviors at or around distinct phases of a woman’s life. While regarding her capacity to fulfill them at any particular phase of maturity (attractiveness), men can get a better overall idea of what is motivating a particular woman during that period of her life and adjust their Game and/or expectations accordingly to a Man’s best advantage relative to that phase. A manosphere staple, Roissy, wrote a fantastic piece about the difficulty of Gaming women by age brackets back in 2010, and I’ll refer readers with a mind for Game to cross reference that article after reading what I propose in this section (see the appendix). With a better understanding of these phases, and the SMV fluctuations of these phases, a Man can more easily adjust his Game, maintain Frame, apply Amused Mastery, as well as a host of other Red Pill / Game practices covertly and confidently with a reasonable expectation of outcome – or at the very least, a better understanding of the personal pitfalls and traps that may await him. One common misunderstanding most men have with regard to the way Hyper-gamy effects women is how the rationalizations of her past and present sexual behaviors affect a man considering marrying (or divorcing) her. What men most commonly lack, or willfully ignore, is that a woman\n\nwas subject to conditions at particular periods in her life which motivated her to those behaviors – the results of which affect her present and future conditions. I’m not sure it’s realistic to expect an inexperienced man in this situation to see any of her sexual hang-ups or self-consciousness with him as the red flags that we can, as objective observers, and being dissociated with his condition. However, there is a certain awareness that comes with Red Pill awareness that helps us better understand what those flags are. The armchair counseling most men offer each other usually presumes that a man should have known a woman looks for her Beta provider at the time he happened to ‘choose’ to marry her. It happened because at that woman’s phase of life, when her sexual market value to the Jerks and Bad Boys she had an affinity for was waning, women commonly seek to consolidate long term security with the stability a Beta man provides. But can we really expect this foresight from a guy who in all likelihood based his decisions to marry her on false romanticized premises and a thoroughly Blue Pill hope that she’d ‘come around’ to being more sexual (or as sexual as the more Alpha men she’d been with prior) with him later in marriage? Can we really expect him to know what her motivations were in her past for her long-term security when he’d never had the benefit of ever having those motivations spelled out for him by Red Pill awareness? It’s with this in mind that I’m presenting this outline here. What I’ve constructed is a loose and generalized chronology of how women effect their Hypergamy over the course of a typical woman’s life between the ages of 15 and 50. While I’m fully prepared for the same outcries of over-generalizing and the “not all women are like that” (NAWALT) rationales that the infamous SMV graph inspired, understand this; before any woman or feminine-aligned man comes up with those predictable objections, this is an outline. Variables like culture, ethnicity, moralism, socio-economic status and outlying circumstance are all factors to consider when evaluating the motivations\n\nand behaviors of any woman. This time line however is intended as a road map to follow to get a better understanding of what motivates women at particular phases of their lives and hopefully help men to better prepare themselves for the strategies women will use to optimize Hyper-gamy during those phases. The Teen Phase I intentionally began the original relative SMV graph at age 15 since this is about the post-pubescent age during which girls come into their maturation and teenage boys begin to take a real sexual awareness of them. As you’ll see on the overall time line, girls prioritize their attraction based on archetypal Alpha characteristics with regards to teenage attraction cues. This is largely based on physical attributes and the physical prowess of teenage boys. These physical arousal cues girls find primarily attractive in adolescent boys (later men) will continue for the better part of a woman’s life, but during a girl’s formative years her foremost attraction is for the ‘hawt guy’ with a good body, the correct eye color, facial symmetry and the right haircut. Between the ages of 15 and 25 young women associate and prioritize their sexual selectivity according to men’s physical features. Even a relatively introverted guy with a Beta mindset and/or a brooding ‘creative’ personality can still be perceived as Alpha if his physical presence aligns with a girl’s physical attraction profile. The main reasoning for this is fairly obvious in that physical cues (though also influenced externally) are primarily innate. In other words, a teenage girl simply doesn’t have the life experience or a sense of provisioning necessity for much else to be an attraction consideration for her. Her mate prioritization cues on visceral arousal. Thus, this physical interest from adolescence through young adulthood is the top priority for both short-term arousal and, perceptually, long-term attraction.\n\nThese physical attraction / arousal cues are intrinsic. Extrinsic attraction cues such as status and social proof do factor in progressively as girls mature, but the priority is the physical. Other extrinsic factors (status, Alpha confidence, Game, etc.), while peripherally beneficial, are prioritized lower due to the simple fact that a young girl lacks any real experience of a guy with Game, social savvy or a real need for personal or emotional provisioning. Note that all of this is predicated on a variety of external existing resources. There is a whole lot of support for young women that is not visible to them, and that support is a product of a tremendous excess of resources at the society-wide level as well as the family level. Long term provisioning potential during this phase is rarely even an afterthought for a young woman. From adolescence forward a woman’s dualistic sexual strategy primarily revolves around short term breeding opportunity – the ‘Alpha Fucks’ side of Hypergamy. This can be attributed to a girl / young woman’s provisioning needs being relatively accommodated for by family, the state in some effect, or even her own selfprovisioning, as well as the breeding urgency that comes with puberty, hormones and youth culture. I’ll add the caveat here that a woman’s prioritization of the physical is inversely proportional to the degree to which her provisioning needs are being met beyond seeking a mate or mating opportunities. In other words, if things aren’t secure at home (Daddy Issues) an adolescent girl physically and mentally prepares herself for a long term mate earlier than when a solid, positive-masculine father is present in her life and in the home. This can be a precarious situation for a teenage girl since her maturity and understanding of what would make a man a good long-term prospect are limited by what she lacks in a positive-masculine role, and combined with an attraction priority that’s based on the physical attributes of a teenage boy. The short version for teenage Game (when you’re in high school) is that looks, physique and physical prowess are a girl’s attraction priority. This\n\npriority will build a foundation for her attraction cues later as she matures, but the primary importance during this phase is looks and performance. The Break Phase I’ve added this phase to the end of the late teen years because this ‘breaking’ event has become an increasingly too common, and potentially damaging, occurrence amongst young men I’ve counseled. Generally the Break Phase comes at or about the time of a young woman’s senior year (or shortly thereafter) of high school when she’s forced into a conflict between continuing a monogamous relationship she began in her teenage years, and severing it as college or a simple want for sexual independence looms closer as she approaches young adulthood, graduation and possibly moving away from her home for an indefinite period of time. This is a major frustration for Beta minded young men predisposed to a feminized conditioning that convinces them they’ll be rewarded for loyalty, support and building relational equity with a girl. I’m highlighting this phase because often enough it’s at this beginning point young men are most prepared to com-promise their life’s ambitions to play the idealistic supportive role their feminine conditioning predisposes them for. The danger being that long-term life decisions made in order to maintain a relationship he believes his sacrifices will be rewarded for will be an equitable sacrifice of personal goals or developing passions and personal potential. Here is the warning for any late teen / early adult man: This is generally the point at which you’ll have to make some real personal assessments of yourself if you’re involved with a steady girlfriend. This will likely be the first test of your Red Pill awareness conflicting with your feminine-primary conditioning. Most Blue Pill guys entertain the hope of the ‘invisible friend’, and a long distance relationship for the first time at this juncture. That or they alter their educational priorities and ambitions to accommodate maintaining their relationship.\n\nStatistically, the girlfriend you expected to build a Disney-story life with will break up with you as her options expand and yours constrict (due to prioritizing her goals above your own). If this is your situation the decisions you make at this stage are up to you, but understand (barring personal convictions) this event will come as a woman’s sexual market value begins it’s rapid ascent and along with it personal and sexual opportunities she’s been scarcely aware of until now. The Party Years The five-year span between 20 and 25 are what I euphemistically call a woman’s ‘Party Years’. It’s at this stage women generally experience their peak SMV (22-23 years old), and as I stated in the Navigating the SMP post, at no other point in a woman’s life will so many socio-sexual options be available to her. A lot of manosphere moralists believe that women ought to marry and get pregnant during the party years since this is the point of peak fertility as well as physical beauty, and in the not so distant, pre-sexual revolution past this certainly made sense. However, under the social conditions of the last 60 years, women’s priorities have changed. The available opportunities – social, sexual, educational and career-wise – that a woman experiences during these years are afforded to her in relation to her SMV. At no point will you find a woman more cocky and selfassured of her predominance in society according to the options she enjoys relative to her attractiveness. Her personal image will be one based on merit, and while it’s certainly possible she is talented or intelligent, her opportunities are predicated on her attractiveness and the leverage it has on other’s (men and women’s) decision making. The physical arousal priorities she had in high school remain a top attraction priority, however, as she matures into the new experiences her SMV peak affords her, status, and later affluence (wealth or potential provisioning) start getting added to the attraction mix. As women learn the utility of their relative SMV, and begin to understand a future need for long\n\nterm provisioning (on some level of consciousness) they come into a better understanding of the transactional nature of their sexual agency. It’s during the party years that women begin to prefer ‘dating’ men older than themselves. At this phase, this is generally between a 4-6 year difference, however, Roissy postulated that even more mature men still have potential depending upon their own SMV: It may be hard to believe, but it is often easier to bed a very young woman than an older woman, if you are an older man. This is because 20-40% of women are specifically attracted to older men. It is hardwired in them, and this hard-wiring can be reinforced by poor family upbringing resulting from divorce of parents or absentee fathers. Single moms are the greatest source of future generations of slutty daughters the world has ever known. During the party years, Hypergamy is still firmly rooted in physical attraction and short term mating cues, however, it’s during this time women begin to develop an appreciation for the personality cues of confidence and (Alpha) character as it relates to her long term investment. Later in the party years a woman’s Hypergamy leads her to look for the Alpha bad boy who might also be molded (tamed) into her long term ideal – this is the Tarzan Effect; the want for an idealized optimal balance of hypergamic interests in the same Alpha male. The idea is one that an Alpha Man might be tamed, in some cases coerced via pregnancy, into assuming the providership role (Beta Bucks) the other half of her sexual strategy demands. One point of attraction older men (who capitalize on their SMV potential) have is that their capacity to provide for more than themselves, and still maintain an above average physique, tends to be a form of preselection for this burgeoning awareness of a need for hypergamic balance as women mature past the latter part of their party years. Just to be clear, as a woman becomes more cognizant of her decreasing capacity to sexually compete with the attractiveness of younger women, her\n\nattraction for more than just the physical aspects of men begins to assume a higher priority. Those aspects (status, confidence, affluence, realized ambitions, worldly maturity, etc.) are typically found in men old enough to have had the experience to acquire them. Social Conventions Many of the predominant social conventions that persist through the Teen, Pre-Adult and early Party Years phases find their roots in women’s childhoods. These conventions may be more or less pronounced for a teenage girl depending on her parents’ involvement in her upbringing, but popular culture and a feminine-primary social order already have a preestablished series of conventions she’s expected to invest herself in. For the most part these conventions key upon an implied superiority of her gen-der while ridiculing any valuable aspect of masculinity beyond a Beta boy’s oafish usefulness to her. These conventions are generally learned in an ambient environment that boys are encouraged to reinforce and affirm for her, but increasingly these social conventions are becoming overt and accepted. By a girl’s ‘tween’ years she’s seen enough Disney feminine-empowerment features that the expectations and concerns of girls becomes one less about meriting the near-valueless attentions of mediocre boys and more about the girls who will eventually become her intrasexual rivals. Little girls fight in an entirely different realm than do boys. Where boys fight in a the physical realm, girls fight in the psychological. That’s not to exclude girls from actually coming to blows, but far more common is the occurrence of psychological combat, and in no realm is this more effective than the denial of reinforcing attention within a female social collective. Little girls have a predictable tendency to form small, girl-only collectives or ‘peer clutches’ from the time they are introduced into kindergarten. This social collective progressively becomes a rewarding and reinforcing social unit, locking out those not included, and nurturing those who are included.\n\nThis dynamic can last through high school (i.e. cliques, etc.), into college and into mature adulthood, but the commonality within all variations of this clutch is the qualifying influence of the affirming power of attention. Should one member offend another, it’s the hierarchy of an individual member’s ability to maintain the most attention that generally determines the victor in the dispute. The worst consequence of such a dispute being ostracization from the group, thus the absolute denial of this reaffirming attention-asreinforcement. This attention can be from any source; within the group, outside the group, but opposite sex attention becomes the most valuable after puberty. Attention-attraction capacity denotes social rank within the peer clutch. The more attractive the girl, the more popular she becomes and the more influence she wields. This isn’t to say that any particular girl cognizantly realizes this. However, when ostracized from the collective, this capacity for consistently attracting attention in a high degree makes her despised. The attention can still be beneficial for affirmation (i.e. realized jealousy), it’s just the intent that has changed. Thus, women use attention not only for their own affirmation, individually and collectively, but also to do combat with each other. Far more damaging than physical fighting is the long term psychological impact of denying this reinforcing satisfaction of attention, or better still, delegitimizing or disqualifying a girl / woman’s capacity to attract this attention. Combine this with a woman’s natural, and innately higher agency to communicate both verbally and non-verbally (i.e. covert communications) and you can see the potential this has in damaging a rival. This might explain a woman’s natural propensity to gossip. When a woman attacks the respectability and character of another (“she’s such a slut”), in essence, she is assaulting the woman’s agency for garnering attention by delegitimizing it. Attention is the coin of the realm in girl-world, and this is an aspect of the feminine psyche that men would be wise to remember during all stages of\n\nwomen’s maturity. Attention is valuable to both the twelve year old girl learning how to apply her first makeup and the eighty year old matron applying it for so long she can’t remember not doing it.\n\nOutliers There are of course going to be incidents of women who, for some condition or circumstance opt out of their party years. Either their socioeconomic situation prevents it, or an early, unplanned pregnancy, or for religious convictions, but whatever the reason they move past this phase without a sense of having capital-ized on it. In some respects this may seem to be a better choice than riding the proverbial ‘cock carousel’ into her Epiphany and Transitory phase (discussed in the next chapter), but it’s important to remember that these circumstances don’t disqualify a woman from the maturation process I’ve described here, they simply manifest relative behaviors in alternative ways. In some cases it may be the source of resentment at a man for having ‘held her back’ from all of the experiences her girlfriends went through (through which she vicariously lived), or it may be her coming into a better understanding of how other men (perceptually) meet her hypergamic balance better than the one she settled for earlier than she had the maturity to understand. As we’ll explore in the next chapter, this resentment can be a later source of marital dissatisfaction (and divorce) for women approaching the Epiphany and Transitory phases. The Break Phase is also an important concept to grasp here. While it commonly first occurs around the time of high school graduation, a Break Phase isn’t limited to that period. The Break can come later, when a woman is finishing up college or just prior to, or starting a job or grad school. Commonly a later Break Phase generally happens during women’s peak SMV or around the ages of 22 to 25.\n\nThere could also be more than one Break Phase – one at around 18, and another at around 22 or 23 depending on the context and circumstances of a young woman’s life. Later Breaks seem to occur with women at the time of major life events – high school graduation, college graduation, moving to a new locale, making a career move. In general, the events and the conditions leading up to them is what a man needs to be most aware of in anticipating a Break Phase crisis with a woman. The reason a woman has a Break is that her circumstances are changing; which affects her emotions. She’s changing her surroundings and then there’s how she feels about that change, and how she considers a man’s involvement in that change. The other thing to keep in mind around Breaks is that the crisis forces her to make a decision about whether the change is more important than the man she is with when the Break happens. In a feminine-primary social order most of the time she decides that the change is more important. This is likely because, women are acculturated in a social order that reinforces women’s aspirations and ‘empowerment’, and encourages her to postpone intimate and family relations until she attains some nebulous goal state. At that time she will always be able to find another man (or so she’s told). Needless to say this section is designed to help young men make better life choices by making them aware of what they can expect in their adolescence and young adulthood. Hold this outline in your head and plan accordingly, but also I think it should help a guy get a better perspective of the events he’ll likely find himself in and understand the influences he’s subject to by the women he involves and associates himself with. If you’re a young man reading this section, my best advice is to consider that the decisions and circumstances you’re confronted with today will drastically change in less than a decade. Understand that making lifechanging emotional or idealistically motivated decisions now will affect the direction of your life.\n\nThat might sound like something your old man or a school counselor will tell you in your senior year – I know because you couldn’t tell me shit when I was in my senior year – but what they wont tell you (because they’re conditioned to ignore it) is that the “do the right thing” idealism you think will be reciprocally appreciated by a girl or a young woman is part of a feminine-primary conditioning you’ve been raised in. You are the hardest reader to reach from a Red Pill perspective because young men are taught to believe that the more you suffer, the more you support, the more you lift up a girlfriend to help her realize her dreams at the cost of your own, the more it shows you really care. A final thought to remember – with the exception of the most necessitous and the most ethically convicted, most women in the developed world are literally incapable of committing to anything between 18-20 and not just because they’ve got some naive ideas in their head, but because they literally just walked into the candy store, and they’re not about to leave with the first flavor they try. It’s important to remember this now, because it will be a double standard women will hold for men later in life. “Men are commitment-phobic” is a popular social convention trope women like to repeat when they reach an age where their own SMV is in decline (The Epiphany Phase) and they want to cash out of the sexual marketplace with a man they can consolidate a long term provisioning with. As that man enters his SMV ascendancy and he enters the “candy store” the commitment imperative she enjoyed around 19 changes for him at 33. This is the parallel men will experience in respect to commitment; he is responsible to commitment with a woman, while she is responsible in exploring all her options. ***\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nPREVENTIVE MEDICINE PART II ***\n\nTHE EPIPHANY PHASE\n\nThe Late Party Years Although not a subsection itself, the latter third of a woman’s Party Years deserves some mention in that the end of this phase is often a prelude for the rationales women develop leading into what I call the Epiphany Phase. Certain third party SMV studies (online dating site informatics for instance) will place a woman’s peak SMV as late as 25 -26 years old. While this is generous for women’s sensibilities, I’d argue that this is far too late in a woman’s life progression when you consider that in earlier eras, men and women achieved social adulthood at much earlier ages. More commonly in our times most women express a desire to settle down, be married and start a family at or around the age of 27 to 29, and most first marriages do in fact happen at an average age of 28 (U.S. Census data corroborates this for 2013). The popularized, ideal of a woman capitalizing on her prime earning years – often excused as fulfilling her professional potential – is a primary contributor to this marriage postponement phenomenon, but it’s important\n\nto point out to men dating women in this phase that the last two years of the Party phase will be the stage at which a woman will begin to feel a more pressing urgency for long-term commitment. It’s during this phase that women, with the foresight to see it, will make their best attempts to consolidate on marriage with the man who best personifies, or has the potential to personify, both Alpha sexual-genetics combined with the providership and parental investment that an optimized Hypergamy seeks to balance in the same man. At no other time will a woman feel more urgency in capitalizing on her still prime attractiveness and sexual agency with a man she believes will fulfill the dual dictates of her sexual strategy. “Where is this going?” This is the most common phase in which a man will be asked “where is this going?” from a woman, or is delivered an ultimatum of withdrawal of intimacy (no more sex, or threats of break up) if no marriage proposal is forthcoming in the foreseeable future. Although women’s preferred method of communication rests in the covert form, as she matures towards a condition of a lessened capacity to intrasexually compete with her younger peers (competition anxiety) most men discover that women in this demographic, by necessity, lean more on overt communication. The coquetry, indirectness and blasé indifference she used to enjoy and hold male attentions captive during her SMV peak years is progressively replaced with a more direct upfront communication directed toward the certainty of promised, committed, assurances of future security. The urgency of her need to consolidate on a supportive monogamy intensifies in direct relation to the intrasexual competition stress she experiences as she ages and her sexual market value declines in comparison to that competition. This urgency makes the need for overt communication (men’s direct content based communication) increasingly more imperative for her so there is less and less margin for men to misunderstand her need.\n\nBear in mind that security for women isn’t always manifested as financial provisioning, but can assume the forms of emotional investment, parental investment, physical security and, most importantly, fulfilling a psychological need for a masculine role of stability, dominance and direction in her life. Of primary importance is the consideration of women’s drive to realize the Al-phi Fucks / Beta Bucks (AFBB) optimized balance of their hypergamous interests in the same man at this stage. That’s not to say this isn’t always the operative for feminine Hypergamy, but it’s during the late Party Years phase that a woman, on some level of consciousness, begins to realize this time is her best opportunity to use her quick-burn SMV to consolidate on what she thinks could be a realizable optimized Hypergamy. This isn’t due to premonitions of hitting the Wall of her SMV potential per se, but it is her first self-acknowledgment of her diminishing capacity to sexually compete for attention with her competition for that optimized guy – younger women experiencing their own SMV peak years. During this period women will often make their first earnest attempts to find ways – sometimes by coercion – to ‘fix’ an Alpha into satisfying the Beta Bucks side of her Hypergamy equation, or, to seriously reevaluate an already committed Beta man’s potential to ‘Man Up’ and become more Alpha, be more ambitious and assesses (what she believes will be) his future SMV potential. Lastly, bear in mind that women in this phase experience this urgency in direct proportion to what their looks, sexuality and command of male attention will still afford them. It’s simple reasoning to figure that women who maintain their physical attractiveness and sexual agency, and are consistently rewarded for it with male attention, will prolong that state for as long as possible. Thus, some attractive women may perpetuate their Party Years until such time as that attention abruptly ends. The Epiphany and Transitory Phase\n\nBetween the ages of 28 to about 30 (sometimes later for attractive women perpetuating their Party Years) women often enter into a more cognitive awareness of their personal conditions with regard to their declining SMV. This phase I call The Epiphany Phase; it is the point at which the subconscious awareness a woman has of her sexual market value in relation to her eventual date with the Wall can no longer be subconsciously repressed and ignored. It is of primary importance to men to fully understand the significance this phase has for women. Again, the epiphany isn’t about women hitting their SMV Wall during this phase (though it’s possible) it’s about a woman conscientiously coming to terms with a markedly lessened capacity to sexually compete with her SMV-peak peers for the same male attention she enjoyed during her Party Years. The abstract exaggeration is to think a woman necessarily hits the Wall at 30, her physical attractiveness shrivels and she magically transforms into a spinster cat lady overnight. Women absolutely (with commensurate effort) can and often do retain their looks and sexual agency past this phase; some into their late 30's and 40's. However, what defines this phase is the conscious realization that their looks are no longer what they were in their prime. Combined with this is the awareness that they can no longer sexually compete at the same level as young women in their own SMV peaks for the attentions of men they now hope to consolidate their Hypergamy on in long-term commitment and provisioning security. The Epiphany phase isn’t about women hitting the Wall so much as it is about an urgency to consolidate upon a man’s commitment of long-term security with the competition anxiety that comes from realizing it’s now she who must to put forth the effort to secure it rather than having it readily offered to her as it was by the men in her SMV peak years. This is a precarious time for a woman where she makes attempts to reassess the last decade of her life. Women’s psychological rationalization engine (a.k.a. the Hamster) begins a furious effort to account for, and explain her\n\nreasonings for not having successfully secured a long-term monogamous commitment from as Alpha a man as her attractiveness could merit for her. Even women married prior to this phase (early marriages) will still go through some variation of self-doubt, or self-pity in dealing with the hypergamic uncertainty of her choice (“Is he really the best I could do?”). A woman’s late Party Years are often the stage during which she entertains the hope that she can ‘civilize’ the Alpha Bad Boys who satisfy the visceral side of her Hypergamy into assuming the providership role the other side of her Hypergamy demands, and is increasingly becoming more urgent for her. Most Alpha Widows – women who psychologically imprint on the psychosexual ideal of the most Alpha man she’s been involved with in her sexual past – are most commonly made during this period. However, it’s during the Epiphany phase women conveniently make the rationalizations necessary for justifying this ‘fixing’ effort. During the Epiphany Phase a woman’s inner and outer dialog is selfexcusing, virtuously self-educational and self-congratulatory. “I used to be so different in college, but I’ve grown personally” or “I’ve learned my lesson about pursuing the ‘wrong kind’ of men, I’m done with Bad Boys now” and “What happened to all the Nice Men?” are the standard clichés women will tell themselves. Women will broadcast these rationalizations, either directly or indirectly, to men with a providership potential in the hopes of signaling to them that she is now ready accept their feminine-preconditioned offers of love, loyalty and dependability – offers which had been regularly forthcoming from men in the past, but she had no use of in during her Party Years. This phase is a functional parallel to men’s feminine-imagined midlife crisis. It’s during this stage that women will make radical shifts in their prioritization of what prerequisite traits qualify as ‘attractive’ in a man and\n\nattempt to turn over a new leaf by changing up their behaviors to align with this new “do-it-right-girl” persona they create for themselves. Since the physicality, sexual prowess and Alpha dominance that made up her former arousal cues in a Man aren’t quite as forthcoming from men as when she was in her sexual prime, she reprioritizes them with presumed preferences for more intrinsic male attributes that stress dependability, provisioning capacity or potential for it, humor, intellect, and esoteric definitions of compatibility and intimacy. All of which fall in line with her new sense of self-convinced feminine maturity and wisdom. For the metaphysically inclined woman (which is to say most women) this may manifest in a convenient return to religious convictions she’d disregarded or abandoned in her Party Years. For other’s it may be some kind of self-enforced celibacy – a refusal to have sex under the Hypergamic auspices of her Party Years in the hopes that a well provisioning male will appreciate her for her ‘new found’ prudence, so unlike how she used to be and all of the other girls who rejected him over the last decade. The self-affirming psychological schema is one where she’s “finally doing the right thing” or she’s determined to make a fresh start “the right way this time”, when in fact she’s simply making the necessity of her long-term security a virtue she hopes the “right” men will appreciate. And if they don’t, then there’s always the social convention of shaming them to think they’re ‘less-than-men’ for not forgiving her of eating her cake once she’s had it too. While looks and masculine physical triggers in men are still an important arousal factor, her desire for a personal association with a man’s status and affluence begin to sublimate her physical priorities for attraction as she increasingly realizes the necessity of these attributes for herself and any future offspring’s long-term provisioning. It should be noted that the appeal of a man’s potential for provisioning is proportional to her perceived need of that provisioning. The Transitioning\n\nAs a woman moves into the Transitory phase (29-31) the Epiphany Phase reprioritizing of intrinsic attraction cues also coincides with the adjusted self-percept-tin of her own sexual market value. As a woman becomes more cognizant of her lessened ability to sexually compete for men who (she believes) would meet her best Hypergamic balance, she’s forced to reassess her self-image. There are many feminine social conventions pre-established to help her deny or buffer this reassessment. However, her hindbrain still acknowledges the competition anxiety that (unless, by effort or genetics, she’s a notable physical exception) she simply cannot command the kind of male attention women in their SMV-peak years do. Thus she must imagine value added aspects for herself and convince men that if they don’t appreciate those newly contrived aspects as valuable their value as a man is lessened. Note that the reality of this assessment, or realistic expectations of it, aren’t the source of this anxiety, but rather it’s what she believes them to be. An exceptionally attractive 30 year old woman may in fact still be able to sexually select men above what most women her age can expect, however it’s what she believes about herself, her internalized expectations for her age and what the Party Years experience has or hasn’t taught her in this respect that contributes to this anxiety. As you may guess this selfassessment is also subject to the influences of social media and social conventions that pander to insulating her from the worst damage to her ego of this Epiphany and the Transition period’s anxiety. There’s a manosphere idiom that states the only women who complain about men needing to Man Up or how men have somehow juvenilely shirked the masculine responsibilities society expects of them are always 30 years of age or older. Younger women simply have no incentive to complain about what they believe they are entitled to in a man beyond his being ‘hawt’. What I term as the Transition phase is the culmination of the Epiphany phase’s influence on a woman who has thus far been unable to consolidate\n\non monogamy-my with a male who fulfills the role of provider (Beta provider most often) that her Hypergamy now holds in a much higher priority order. When women in this phase complain of men’s “adequacy issues” what they’re really bemoaning is their chronic inability to find (or merit) a man who can optimally balance the dual influences of her Hypergamy – Alpha Fucks and Beta Bucks. The urgency for this consolidation is then compounded by the misconceptions most women hold about the Myth of their Biological clock, but in biological terms she’s well past the years of her prime fertility window and conceiving and carrying a child to term becomes progressively more difficult for women with each passing year. I think it’s important to consider other outcomes of personal decisions women often do make during these periods. As I mentioned in Part I, it’s not uncommon for some women to consolidate on monogamy (LTR or marriage) well before either of these phase take place. While the experiences may differ, the underlying influences that prompt these phases remain more or less the same. I’ll elaborate more on this in Part III as it primarily relates to the later phases of women’s maturation process. Social Conventions In the Transition phase, the competition anxiety that prompted the Epiphany Phase is exchanged for an anxiety that results from confronting the possibility a woman may never consolidate on a long-term security. However, as always, feminine social conventions are already in place to absolve her of any real personal accountability for this insight. Thus, begins the ‘Men are threatened by powerful women’, ‘Men have fragile egos’, ‘Men are shallow and only want young girls they can manipulate instead of vibrant women who are their intellectual equals’ and various other canards intended to simultaneously shame men into compliance with their hypergamous imperative. These ready conventions are established to relieve women of any personal account-ability for the anxiety the Transition phase forces them to experience.\n\nFor Red Pill, Game-aware Men, the Epiphany phase is a supremely important stage in women’s maturation to consider. A woman in the Epiphany Phase is looking for a “fresh start” for a much more visceral reason than some newly inspired sense of self. This motivation prompts all kinds of behavioral and social conventions to facilitate a man’s commitment to forgiving her past indiscretions. As I mentioned, it’s women in this phase of life (or the mothers of women in this phase) who most vocally complain about men’s lack of interest in committing to them. Women in their peak SMV years don’t complain about a dearth of marriageable men– “Man Up” is the anthem of women in the Epiphany Phase. Operative social conventions abound for women in their late Party Years, through their Epiphany and Transitioning Phases, and not until their midthirties does the usefulness of these phases’ conventions really shift to more useful ones. Most of these center on two primary aspects of a woman’s maturity. The first being the necessity of absolving a woman of the consequences of following the dictates her hypergamous sexual strategy incurred for her. The Party Years are defined by a woman prioritizing the Alpha Fucks side of Hypergamy. Post-Party Years social conventions euphemistically refer to this as a woman finding herself or “exploring her options”, but this period is defined by the “bad decisions” women characteristically make with men who “weren’t really good for them”. That isn’t to say all women make these mistakes, but even the most reserved of women still prioritize Alpha excitement above Beta comfort and familiarity. “I was looking for love in all the wrong places.” “I always wanted marriage. I always wanted to find a great guy to settle down and have kids with. It just never happened for me.”\n\n“I made a lot of mistakes.” (I made a lot of decisions that seemed like a good idea in the moment but when aggregated make me look kind of bad to you now.) “I didn’t intend to get to 30 without being married. It just kind of happened.” The common thread running through all this is the woman’s having sex with various attractiveness-prioritized men with options in the hopes that one of them would offer her commitment on her terms. When she fails in her attempt to get one of these top men to commit, she has to find a way to rationalize it so as to put the best face on it she can. The simplest way of ego preservation is to say “well, I always wanted to get married all along; it just never worked out for whatever reason”. And this is why men hear these rationalizations and explanations for the “crazy pasts they’re over now”, the Alpha men they can’t seem to get over (Alpha Widows) and the first night lays they had. The second necessity for operative social conventions dovetails with the first in that they aid in consolidating on Beta provisioning and parental investment by ensuring those men remain compliant to what their own feminine conditioning has prepared them for. Women’s long term security and provisioning depends on a man never fully coming into an awareness of his true SMV until after a woman can consolidate on his commitment to her. Scarier still is the thought that a man might come to that awareness after his potential has been compromised and limited by the decisions he was led to believe were his responsibilities to the feminine imperative and can never fully realize because of those decisions. Social convention that key on presumed social responsibility bombard men from all sides during this phase of women’s maturity – even perpetuated by men them-selves. “Men should date women their own age.”\n\n“Men are ‘shallow’ for ignoring single mothers as viable long term mates.” “Men have ‘fragile egos’ needing constant affirmation in an infantile respect.” “Men feel threatened by ‘successful’ women.” These are a few examples but the prevalent social conventions of this phase all key on appeals to (Beta) men’s presumed social responsibility, shame and emphasis-sizing a man’s ‘duty’ to abandoning or compromising his own sexual strategy’s best interests.
