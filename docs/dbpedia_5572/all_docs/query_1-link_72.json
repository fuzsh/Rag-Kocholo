        "text": "September 23, 2020\n\nHypergamy.\n\n**The act or practice of seeking a spouse of higher socioeconomic status, or caste status than oneself.**\n\nLet me be very clear here. There are a LOT of interesting ideas rolling around within this book and almost all of them have *TM* words associated with them, but Hypergamy is one of the biggest takeaways I've seen.\n\nSo what's the context? I mean, other than the fact that about a million women want to murder Rollo Tomassi for speaking his mind. What could be so damning?\n\nThe term of the Red Pill. In general, it's taken from the Matrix and it always blows your mind and it can be applied to just about anything, but in this context, it's about waking up to the fact that women have different sexual agendas than men. Specifically, it's the double standard of women's agendas with respect to men.\n\nLet's keep it simple here without going into actual history, tons of studies, evolutionary psychology, legal precedence, massive observational correlations, or the gut feeling that most men nowadays have that SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG.\n\nI'll just lay out the idea of Hypergamy. It can apply to men as well as women, but in general, the tables have been flipped. The last sixty years have given us a nearly unending stream of media that celebrates female sexuality in any of its forms, telling them to get their rocks off when they're young and then settle down with the *dependable* man when their sexiness declines. A perceptive person would note that this was the male ideal BEFORE that time period, and aside from a brief macho period in the '70s that quickly became derision for men in the '80s, the tables have turned.\n\nHypergamy, in the vernacular, is \"always trade up when the opportunity presents itself\".\n\nMen who know what they want and plan for success are generally regarded as alpha males. They are the ones who ignore verbal narratives and act and behave in ways that are aligned with observable reality. They tend to eschew talk of soul-mates, softness in relationships, cuddly-feely emotionality.\n\nSince biology predisposes women to feel heavy sexual attraction to males who know what they want and who plan for success, alphas are the ones who always tend to get the most women for practically no cost in terms of investment, intellectualism, emotionalism, or even care. These are the truly sexy ones and they always tend to ignore the feminist narrative that SAYS men should put in tons of investment, intellectualism, and emotionalism, and care in order to appease a woman.\n\nNote, this statement is backed up by science, massive observations of real people, and (almost universally) in popular media.\n\nThe other kind of male is the beta male. These are the men who have grown up in an obviously feminist-dominated society, who were caught in the feminist narrative as children and bought it, hook, line, and sinker. The author notes that 80% of men are betas. These are the men who bought the idealized version of what they thought women wanted out of men. The ones who believe in soul-mates, true friendships, true equality, and believe (mostly because they are told to, repeatedly,) that women are smarter, stronger, and more capable than men.\n\nDoes this sound familiar? I think most men will agree -- if pressed -- and definitely not in the presence of anyone who might let it slip -- that something is very wrong. Men are collectively demonized as a whole sex.\n\nAnd this is reasoning is used as justification for demonizing a whole sex.\n\nWhy would women do this? It's simple: it protects them from having to look at the things they believe about themselves.\n\nHave fun in your youth and then settle down used to be the narrative of what men were taught to believe.\n\nIn this case, specifically, have fun with the bad boys (the ones who refuse to get down with the feminist narrative), and then dump them because they don't provide long-term stability. Marry the beta-choice, the one that doesn't truly stimulate you, and make sure he knows that he's a second-class citizen and that you always have someone else lined up on the sides if he doesn't stay cowed. Fortunately, most men are thoroughly indoctrinated to accept this. A man's self-worth is determined by how well he can provide for the family. The expectation is that he gets all the sex he wants within this stable arrangement. But here's the thing: women's behavior, in general, doesn't align with the narrative.\n\nThey drop the alphas that don't magically become subservient to the narrative once women are beyond their sexual prime. They actively start looking for the men who will be able to tow the narrative line, provide for them (despite being told constantly that they are just as good as men in everything, or better). This happens between ages 29-32. The second-best choice is beta men.\n\nHow many times have women complained that there aren't any good men out there?\n\nHere's the breakdown, adjusted for an idealized equal playing field where both the men and women are otherwise equally desirable. Women are turned on by the anti-feminist narrative men but these same men are not good marriage material. The ones who ARE good marriage material don't turn them on. Just look at the dominance fantasies in romance literature if you don't believe me.\n\nOf course, once you get beyond this point, it's in a woman's best interest to double down on the feminist narrative and make sure that this beta man is completely cowed and accepting of any and every decision you make, or he might wake up one day to realize that he was always the second-best choice.\n\nMaintain the power differential. He must provide, he must defer all parenting decisions, and he can't even dissent in an argument. How many \"Yes, dear\" men are out there? It is not a small number.\n\nLaws are designed to always side with the women. One example: 1 million men in the USA are forced to provide for children who aren't theirs. Let's get real here. That's called cuckoldry. There are very few support groups for men who have either been raped, need mental health assistance, who need pro-bono legal support in bad divorces, and the law even supports keeping genetic-data sealed from men on the assumption that it would be \"bad for the children\".\n\nThis is only one facet of a much larger problem. Of course, men know there is a problem. It's obvious when you see that men are 4-6 times more likely to commit suicide than women. The problem is REAL, it is PRESSING, and it is tragic.\n\nThe real issue, described here and with multiple resources within this book, (and others I myself could name), is whether or not we are able to SEE that there is a problem. Tomassi uses the term Red Pill constantly for this very reason.\n\nAnd all of this is mostly just an aside within this particular book. It is an important aside, but it's still an aside.\n\nWhat did I think of this book, aside from the important ideas inside it?\n\nI love the insistence that the whole subject should remain apolitical. I agree with this. It affects all men and should not be conflated with any other designation EVEN IF it disproportionally condemns, say, black men, more intensely than it does white men. The problem is becoming more universal every single day.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID. The way this particular book is written reminds me of Tom Cruise's character in the movie Magnolia. It does bring up a ton of interesting and/or valid points, but it does not and frankly cannot capture the spirit or the scope of the problem. And while I DO believe it brings up some excellent points against egalitarianism in favor of complementarianism, the WAY it is written makes it sound like it's trying to sell something... which, of course, it is.\n\nEven Trinity and Morpheus needed to seduce Neo into taking the Red Pill, and he backslid quite a bit.\n\nSuffice to say, while this book is not perfect, it is still a very important kind of book to be reading.\n\nAnd I mean that for both MEN AND WOMEN.\n\nNot all women buy into the feminist narrative. And by this, let's be very clear: I don't think anyone alive has a problem with first and second wave Feminism. It's the third wave we should all be very skeptical about.\n\nLet's open discussions! No name-calling, no shaming, no dehumanization, please.\n\nJuly 6, 2020\n\nI got a lot less out of this book compared to the first two books and there's a few reasons for this. I think the first is that there's a significant segment that isn't relevant to me such as the piece on Red Pill Parenting. Consequently I experienced a lot less \"a-ha!\" moments that I had with the first books.\n\nI think the second reason why this book felt less good is because the penny has already dropped for me. I get it now, but when I read the first two books the penny hadn't dropped. This book is really just building on the concepts explored in the first two books for the most part, with a new few additions and explanations. There was nothing mind changing or mind altering that I experienced in the first two books.\n\nI think I approached this book in the wrong frame of mind, and is one I will revisit in the future.\n\nAlso I thought the piece about The Private Man was a nice touch. RIP.\n\nNovember 17, 2017\n\nFar and away the worst of Rollo's 3 books, which is saying something cause he writes some shit. It suffers badly from a lack of an editor once again and it's like we know you have money Rollo, invest in one. In regards to needing an editor he does this: he has a section called \"how to read this book\" which basically says read my other 2 books first so you understand what I'm talking about and then proceeds to constantly talk about the same ideas that were presented in the first 2 books. R E D U N D A N C Y.\n\nHe also warns against marriage which is a fine position to have and talks about how corrosive single parents are which is 100% accurate but never addresses how to successfully navigate an intergender dynamic if you want to have children. If both options are poor choices what are you supposed to do? And him giving advice on how to raise a son without even having a son is a pointless read. Equivalent to what Bill Burr said about Oprah. And I recently saw a picture of him and I have to say he looks nothing like I imagined. Needs to hit the weights badly or at least get on TRT, very beta looking.\n\nAnother waste of time read by this beta.\n\nDecember 21, 2017\n\nNeeds an editor, good advice for anyone who is looking for a guide on the 'what now' effect after being unplugged from a blue pill narrative. Would recommend at least reading the first Rational Male before reading this one, as there is a lot of assumed knowledge in the chapters within.\n\nDecember 29, 2017\n\nBetween 3 and 4. Still entertaining but probably the least thought provoking book in the series. Target audience is married men.\n\nDecember 24, 2022\n\nYou want to know what my problem is?\n\nMy problem is living in a world teeming with young men who've become so conditioned to believing that anything remotely masculine is to be ridiculed, vilified or subdued until they have no concept of what conventional masculinity truly entails much less pass off even the possibility that it could be something positive and attractive.\n\nMy problem is when a personal, Beta friend swallows a bullet because he, literally, \"can't live without\" the girlfriend who left him.\n\nMy problem is watching a pastor's pretty wife leave him and 4 children so she can pursue her Hypergamous instincts after 18 years of marriage because he pedestalized her and deprecated himself (and men) every day of their marriage.\n\nMy problem is when a 65 year old man, steeped in his Blue Pill conditioning for his long life, cries in my lap about how he's been consistently blackmailed with his wife's intimacy for the past 20 years of their marriage and won't risk offending her for fear of losing her.\n\nMy problem is talking a close friend out of killing both the wife he married too young and the man she just cheated on him with in the parking lot of the motel he's spent all night tracking her down to with their three children crying in the backseat of their minivan at 4am.\n\nMy problem is civilly sitting down to Thanksgiving dinner with a hyper-religious woman and the new millionaire husband she married just 8 months after her former Beta husband of 20 years hung himself from a tree when she decided \"he wasn't the ONE\" for her. My problem is staring at the brand new tits and Porsche she bought herself with the money from the home he built for her, that he busted his ass for, just 3 months after he was in the ground. My problem is emphatically teaching a nephew how not to be the Beta his father was, while tactfully pointing out the Hypergamy of his obliviously opportunistic mother.\n\nMy problem is watching my father, though decaying from Alzheimer's, still playing out a Saviour Schema in an effort to get laid that he's thought should work for his entire life at 68 years old.\n\nMy problem is watching him feebly default to a behaviour that had obsessively motivated him to succeed until he was forced into early retirement at 53 and his second wife promptly left him after that.\n\nMy problem is consoling a good friend who fathered three daughters with two wives and is being emotionally manipulated by his third (another single mother), who's become so despondent that he dreads going home from work to deal with his personal situation and waits with anticipation for the weekends to be over.\n\nMy problem is counselling a guy who thought the best way to separate himself from \"other guys\" was to be 'chivalrous' and date a single mommy, also with three children from two different fathers, only to knock her up for a fourth kid and marry her because \"it was the right thing to do.\"\n\nMy problem is dealing with a 17 year old girl who witnessed her new boyfriend being stabbed 30 times by her ex-boyfriend because he believed \"she was his soul-mate\" and \"would rather live in jail without her than see her with that guy.\"\n\nMy problem is trying to explain to 'Modern Women' that - after 20 years of marriage, my wife could still model swim-wear and confidently respects my judgment and decisions as a man - and that I didn't achieve this by being a domineering, 1950's caveman-chauvinist who's crushed her spirit, but that it is an understanding and adherence to living a positively masculine, Red Pill aware role in the marriage.\n\nAnd my biggest problem is seeing 14 year old Beta boys all ready to sacrifice themselves wholesale to this pitiful, mass-media fuelled, pop-culture endorsed, idealised and feminized notion of romantic/soul-mate mythology—all because some other Betas trapped in the same quicksand are affirming and co-enabling each other to further their own sinking and spread this disease to other young men. It's infectious, and complacency, like misery, loves company. If I have a fear it is that I'm only one man, and I can't possibly be enough to kick these guys in the ass like their fathers were unable or unwilling to do.\n\nThis is why I bother. It really is a matter of life or death sometimes.\n\nAugust 21, 2019\n\nI read The Rational Male 1, 2, and 3 back to back. I pitch they need to be read together. 1 introduces you to the Redpill and is the hardest to read for that reason. 2 offers up a practical picture of what to expect in your relationships with women at various stages of life that men should be aware of. 3 details what to do as a parent, boyfriend, and husband to exercise the Redpill - not a detailed analysis but a general framework.\n\nI don’t know why, but Tomassi cares about men. The opening of 1 he outlines that there are men whom will not accept the Redpill and that you can only acknowledge that and move on. There are men whom are better off sleeping without the knowledge in his books. For those whom do read them and learn from them, he’s gone through a detailed analysis of the realistic differences between how men and women approach sex and relationships. When I say differences, I mean he shatters your paradigm completely. He points out truths about how men and women relate we tend to ignore because we’ve been conditioned to silence our wants and needs as men.\n\nIf you read these books, and really digest them, you will not look at the world the same way.\n\nSeptember 28, 2018\n\nAll of the ideologies discussed in this book are not founded in pessimism, cynicism or misogyny, though it may seem so, but rather, honest, unvarnished, assessments and correlated experiences of human praxeology.\n\nJanuary 23, 2018\n\nPriceless writings, but definitely needs some more editing.\n\nNovember 4, 2019\n\nI read \"Positive Masculinity\" before the other two \"The Rational Male\" volumes. That's actually how I discovered Red Pill awareness / manoverse and all that is orbiting (pun intended) around that in the first place. Actually I already left a review for \"The Rational Male\" erroneously thinking it was \"Positive Masculinity\", you can read it here by the way: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...\n\nI won't add much to what I wrote there because basically my ideas stand still for all the three books: I consider them all a \"must read\" and I can't recommend them more to anybody, doesn't matter their gender/age/etc.\n\nAs a differentiator I could mention that, between the first and the 3rd \"The Rational Male\" book, it's noticeable how the quality has been constantly increasing. For example, some of the long convoluted sentences in the 1st became way easier to grasp and understand, together with the brilliant ways Rollo manages to clarify deeper and deeper some of the most controversial (and enlightening) intersexual behaviors.\n\nDo yourself a favor, read it with an open mind and be ready to learn some uncomfortable truth that will make you, if not a better one, at least a more informed human being.\n\nApril 17, 2021\n\n9/10.\n\nA little subtracted for the writing style, which is at times tedious and incorrect, and for not buttressing the argument with as much evolutionary psychology as possible.\n\nAnother little subtracted because while Tomassi warns against marriage as being a trap of eternal legal ass-fucking of a man in service to women's hypergamy (i.e. strategic pluralism in evolutionary theory), and does ground his arguments in the gestalt of evolutionary psychology, he has no advice for men who want to become fathers, which is... the point of evolution.\n\nMay 12, 2021\n\nGreat trilogy with enlightening information. The way of Men. Good reminders.\n\nAugust 11, 2022\n\nA masterpiece and the best one yet from Rollo. Every man should read this book.\n\nApril 25, 2019\n\nBook was OK I just couldn't agree with any of the stuff I was reading.\n\nFebruary 5, 2020\n\nРоло Томаси го имат вече за \"Кръстника на маносферата\", заради първите му две книги, които наистина са неистово добри.\n\nНапоследък обаче, наблюдавам в подкастите, в които участва, че нещо много си е повярвал и направо не може да го накара човек да си затвори устата. Без каквато и да е научна подготовка, освен някакви повърхностни статийки от интернет, които цитира, той се опитва да създаде някакъв научен ореол на това което казва, въпреки, че нещата му напоследък са просто допускания, често градени на погрешните му представи за някакви други неща.\n\nТретата му книга не само не прави изключение, ами е и бляскавият пример за това неблагоприятно развитие на мисълта му. В нея стилът му на писане ескалира рязко до псевдо-научни висоти, със заплетени, дълги изречения и думи - чиято цел е да маскират факта, че казаното е просто предъвкване на предишните две книги - което би било очевидно, ако беше казано по нормален начин.\n\nSeptember 17, 2019\n\nThis books exposes a différente , extrême view on masculinity and relationships in general .\n\nMarch 5, 2024\n\nAlthough I really did like the second book in the series, I could not bring myself to finish this one. Already beginning was bad - the author could have cut away 7-8% easily. Another thing bothering me was the endless usage of difficult words as if to look smart. And I think by the third book more of his ego shines through, not in a good way. There is a lot of “VERSUS” thinking, like there is a battle to be fought. How about we just do our own thing and let the other world be? I mean it’s like Islam vs Buddhism, both of them think their worldview is correct, but one does not force upon the rest of the world. It’s naive to think that one man can change the world, so let the world be. Let’s change ourselves. Stopped listening at 60% but did write some solid ideas too, like:\n\n* The village raises our sons, meaning they get SO much outer influence that by the time of 10 years old it’s already too late to change anything. You have to show masculine role model examples to him when he is 3-5-7 years old, not start the “daddy son” talk at 12 or 15. And actually taking doesn’t help - only role modeling does. But don’t give too much attention to Your children, because You’d spoil them. The REAL WORLD will not treat them like that. Focus on yourself and Your wife, and the children will learn by example of you being a masculine man, the king of the house. All women like to have a rooted king, this is the only thing arousing the passion, “earning the passion with deeds and gifts” is not possible. The woman talk they want romance, but romance is not what triggers their thoughts of fu*king a random alpha male. And every woman wants to fu*k, they’d crawl over miles of wires to get to the man they want - if they don’t want You, then it’s a lack of desire, not gifts and romance. You can not appeal to a woman's reason to make her want you. Genuine arousal is an organic process. And alpha male intrinsically knows the clues of a woman if she is organically interested.\n\n* A lack of masculine examples is the reason “a village raises your son” to be SO soft that a lot of them start to see the softness as such a high value that the world starts to transition from boys to girls. It’s already happening in the United States. The leftism will masculinity, it’s made out to be a “bad” thing. It’s the only way to take power away from men. The Village will “praise” your son for being “mature” acting soft, and not “insecure” acting masculine, this is criticized.\n\n* Statistics say that the more a woman has had partners, the more likely she is to separate. Surely do ask about her past and don’t let them tell You “don’t be insecure” or what every lie/reason not to tell the truth. The more alphas she has had, the more You will be compared with them in her mind.\n\nApril 17, 2020\n\nThe female imperative. THE female imperative. The FEMALE imperative.\n\nHmm. The. Female…IMPERATIVE.\n\nEnjoyed that so far? Well, strap your dildos on, you magnificent alphas, because Rollo Tomassi, his supreme manship, is going to make sure to talk about it thousand more times. I’m writing the same review on his second and third book, “Preventive Medicine” and “Positive Masculinity”, because I honestly can’t really find much difference between the two.\n\nI like the idea of reminding people some of the benefits of traditional masculinity, but these guys make it really hard to find the few useful information they provide. For a group of people that spouse about manly characteristics, they are such huge whiners.\n\nLast time I checked, whining has never been a positive characteristic of a manly ideal. But for these guys, it’s always society and the females putting these poor men down. Also, something else that’s really gets on my nerves is all their childish use of stupid words and phrases. Alpha Fucks, Beta Bucks. See, it rhymes, you absolute child, so make sure you use it a million times since your macho readers can only understand a concept if you apply the communication theories learned from teaching to preschoolers.\n\nThere is a lot of these. The Manosphere (there’s one) has full of these terms. AWALT, AFC, Cock Carousel, DTF, Hypergamy, Oneitis, and on and on.\n\nThey really act pathetic, and not for the reasons that more liberal minded people do, but because they just so totally suck at acting like a man.\n\nSeptember 24, 2019\n\nDespite having a lot of discretion about some of its content, I have true respect for the author for standing up for what he truly thinks is righteous. This book offers more detailed and practical implications of hypergamy. The first two books of this series has already caused a lot of \"ah huh\" moments. I though I understood hypergamy each time I finished one his books but in the next book I stood corrected. He simply goes further into this principle which is deliberately ignored, denied in the media, and socially rejected in a fem-centric society yet it's applied and observed every single day. I have never seen a single female in my life who did not behave according to it. Rare exceptions of that observation were usually accompanied with exceptional relationships (mostly in the negative sense). This book brought value to my life and it made me a better man. I feel I understand society and people much better now. I don't feel anti-female as many commentators claim this book to be, but it is anti-feminist, and well, feminism haven't done many favours as much as damage to this world and the female part of this world. There were many bitter truths to be swallowed but bitter truth is better than sweet dreams.\n\nJuly 21, 2024\n\nIf you've finally digested and accepted the vast majority of the ugliest Red Pill's truths discussed in Rational Male I & II, chances are that you will start feeling a kind of guilt and shame about the Game. Rollo has put a perfect sentence to counter that feeling of guilt and Shame: \"Putting angel's and devil's wings on observations hinders real understanding\".\n\nAlso, remember the Cardinal Rule of Sexual Strategies: \"For one gender's sexual strategy to succeed the other gender must compromise or abandon their own.\".....\n\nBeyond that, this whole book is about proudly and shamelessly embodying the role of a positive, rational alpha male in a society where being masculine is labeled as being toxic and threatening. The book explains how one can embody A positive masculine role in marriage towards his wife, daughter & son without being labeled as a superfluous, over-invested father.\n\nAs someone who read the Rational Male Volume I & II, I 100% recommend this book to get an in-depth understanding of intersexual dynamics. Finally, the male reader must always remember that in each of his books, Rollo tries his best to provide us with the necessary tools so that we make « informed & rational decisions » in our daily lives.\n\nRead\n\nOctober 1, 2020\n\nRollo, I’m so grateful to express that this book has helped me change the course of my life. I am blessed to have two fathers. My biological father and Father Time. I have discovered that my purpose is to advance the awareness of “The Red Pill” one song at a time. I pray to my third father that my understanding of the inner workings of both my conscious and subconscious thought processes will keep me on a humbled journey until I die of old age. The appendix of this book is what’s giving me the backbone to seek out your opinion on my plan. Thank you for doing what you believe to be your part in helping ensure the survival of our species by supplying us with more tools, allowing us more agency to create and expand in our universe. Us and our idealism. Boys being boys. I can’t remiss to thank my mother for her passions expressed through her nurturing love in ensuring I not only survive, but to thrive just as my father did. I truly believe that this read is a gift to future generations of men and women. I can’t wait for book 4. 🖤♠️\n\nWishing you and your loved ones well,\n\nAceofslayz\n\nMarch 22, 2023\n\nThis book helped me a lot. As a young man today you will find that you can't really trust what you are being told. Except for middle-aged white men. This is a very straight-forward book on how to be a masculine man in 2022 - without all the sugarcoating.\n\nI used to be your average frustrated chump taking advice from everyone who had a significant other, whether that be a boy or a girl. I wanted to see both sides. Thing is - they didn't know. \"Just be yourself\", \"be nice\", \"enjoy life\". This doesn't hold up when you are becoming an adult.\n\nThe book contains a brutally honest depiction of our genders' roles and expectations and takes no notice of modern political BS, which was my fault numero uno.\n\nIn short, reject modernity, embrace tradition. Tradition is not the worship of ashes, but preservement of fire.\n\nI would really really really recommend this book for sons of single-mothers with bad or no father-figures. You don't want to overcompensate. Masculinity is, despite popular belief, not to act like a gorilla. It's building, maintaining, creating.\n\nSeptember 19, 2023\n\nAn eye opening read that delves deeply into the complexities of modern masculinity. It challenges conventional wisdom and social norms in a way that is both provocative and enlightening. Tomassi expertly navigates through the cultural landscape to offer a comprehensive guide for men who are seeking to understand themselves better and achieve a more balanced, empowered life. Whether it's relationships, self improvement, or career goals, this book serves as a compass, providing invaluable insights that can transform your worldview.\n\nWhat sets this book apart is its unapologetic honesty combined with well-researched arguments. It's not just an opinion piece; it's a guide grounded in psychology, sociology, and personal experience. It's a book that every man, and even women, should read to truly understand the intricacies of masculinity in today's world. Highly recommended for anyone who is looking to elevate their understanding of gender dynamics, self-worth, and personal growth\n\nJuly 4, 2023\n\nRollo Tomassi, наричан от много “гуруту” на Red Pill обществото, представя защо мъжа и жената са напълно различни и е невъзможно да има “равенство” между двата пола. Книгата се преповтаря до голяма степен с другите две заглавия от поредицата “The Rational Male”.\n\nСмятам, че във времена в които израстващите момчета са бомбардирани от онлайн порнография, достъпва във всеки един момент от ежедневието, OnlyFans модели продаващи телата си за 5$ на месец и какво ли още не, книги като тази наистина трябват да бъдат прочетени, затова и давам 5 звезди.\n\nЕстествено, книгата представя обширно взаимоотношения между мъжа и жената, какво е hypergamy (хипергамия), по какъв начин жените я използват, разликите между “Alpha” и “Beta” мъжа, кои са чертите, които жените търсят в мъжа през различните етапи на живота и много други принципи от Red Pill.\n\nJune 16, 2019\n\nWhile enjoyed some of the insights of The Rational Male, I felt this book was either a rehash or way off mark. Parenting and having children is an end to itself and more fullfilling and meaningful than notch counts and hottie counts, by at least two magnatudes. While single parenting is less preferrable to dual parenting, men can and should raise children just fine on their own (as a single parent with single/duo IVF donor with surrogacy) as a worthy goal.\n\nJuly 23, 2019\n\nA terrific book how to raise and be a man in the feminized world we live in today. Every chapter is a gold mine of information and writing a review really wouldn't do justice on the quality of this bad-boy. I especially found the chapter on finding a quality wife to be insightful. I obviously don't agree with most of the information in this book, like how you shouldn't marry, but it's refreshing to see a unique perspective on such a contentious issue. I'd recommend any man read this.\n\n4/5\n\nSeptember 10, 2019\n\nhhmm well I need to get the first and the second version.\n\nany way society/culture becoming more degraded and degenerate,\n\nthanks with the help of feminism pushing agenda like \"strong independent woman\"\n\nmasculinity is toxic, there are no males just boys.\n\ngender is a social construct, and other lunacies.\n\nhe talks about this stuff and other stuff. but I felt it somewhat lacking in content.\n\nAnd it read like a sales pitch.\n\nSeptember 12, 2020\n\nThe parental and feminine nature parts are good. But the social imperative and positive masculinity parts are somewhat repetitive and more like ideology or social reform. I think it's going a bit too far. Red pill is about strategy against women, we should overly use it to direct other aspects of life.\n\nAnyway, I think the ideology it promotes won't succeed. Feminism will win and men will lose, that's what I think. I think men can just surrender in the societal dimension."
