        "text": "Read\n\nMarch 1, 2023\n\nThis has been the most difficult essay I've written. Rewritten four times. I went in a million different directions and could never be satisfied. I consider my essay somewhat of a failure in what it tried to achieve (there is something I feel I'm missing. Something like the purpose of the sexual imperatives and why they matter), but it makes some contributions. I have to let go of this now before it consumes more of my time...\n\nWhile Game can be conceived as something seductive that only scheming losers need to learn because they can't get a woman by just being who they are, a better way of understanding \"learning Game\" is seeing it as unlearning limiting ideas, attitudes, and habits that we have implanted from social conditioning and trauma.\n\nLearning Game is not about being less of yourself; it is about learning what is effective and unlearning what is not. You change personality when you let it sink in over time, so it shifts from explicit behavior to implicit identity. The problem with \"Being who you are\" is that we attach our identity to our beliefs, which come from outside ourselves; our families, our teachers, and the views of our society at large.\n\nSo, practicing Game and being oneself is a false dichotomy. Everyone has learned to a certain degree how to behave to be attractive to women. This may have come from implicit learning, such as watching role models, figures on TV, novels, etc., or explicit learning, such as family, friends, and teachers telling you how you ought to treat y'lady. The real dichotomy is Bad Game and Good Game.\n\nAn example of the confusion between Authenticity and Game is displayed in the Breadcrumbs chapter, which was great. Rollo writes how erotic tension is created out of mystery. However, problems arise when insecurity leads men to vomit out all their (carefully selected) personal details - because they think it will build intimacy.\n\nHis carefully tailored selection of personal details is designed to give her a favorable impression of him and make her feel comfortable around him. This is the default Game most guys do. And unlearning this and instead making her feel like she is \"figuring you out using her feminine intuition\" is just making the interaction more fun and authentic. Instead of telling her explicitly who you are, let her figure it out, and, based on your openness, you figure out who you are in the process, also. Learning Game principles is a round-about way to just being your more authentic self.\n\nRed Pill theory originated from Game - what early pickup artists figured out in the field. It became its own thing when the community wanted to flesh out a more general theory of intersexual dynamics - without necessarily learning how to be good with women. This book is a sort of high school reunion between these two.\n\nThe Red Pill is about understanding and adapting to the raw reality of sexual dynamics, removing the blue-pill rose-tinted glasses of romantic idealism, spiritual optimism, and fem-centric social conditioning, and instead, providing a rational and pragmatic perspective grounded in evolutionary psychology, statistical analysis and collectively shared experience of men today.\n\nIt's a valuable paradigm to protect against suffering and the weak \"blue pill\" attitudes we eventually slide into.\n\nWhile men need to learn and be aware of this stuff, the danger is that it's quickly taken for granted as an absolute fact; it becomes the primary lens you start viewing the world.\n\nThe problem is that it's based entirely on the physical realm. So it paints an animalistic predatory/prey, zero-sum, give/take picture of human relations. This is not ideal.\n\nWe can see how Rollo is in this paradigm by how most of his Youtube strategy is attacking other people to increase himself and gain more subscribers. There is so much negativity in the community, and there's no mystery as to why when Rollo himself is behaving like this. He makes videos attacking women who he and his fans, by default, assume has the worst of intentions. So now we end up in a part of the internet where grown-ass men gossip about who had sex with whom; assuming all women are subconsciously controlled by their instinct for hypergamy, all their actions can be explained as such.\n\nThe problem with paradigms is that they are self-reinforcing. You start seeing proof of them everywhere you go because your beliefs influence your perception. Moreover, it's not only your experience of the world that's changed by selective focus, but the crazy thing is that it changes to match your expectations.\n\nIn other words, models of reality and reality itself have a bidirectional relationship.\n\nRollo said he wanted to exclude his moral judgment in his Red pill literature, yet all his \"objective facts\" are highlighted. In contrast, others are ignored by subjective bias from his value system.\n\nHaving said all this. Rollo is the grandfather of The Red Pill - and he has a deep understanding of sexual dynamics and a solid grasp of Game, and he has contributed a ton to the common understanding of what the heck is going on around us. What's funny about Rollo is that he makes everyone feel blue-pilled.\n\nThe most interesting part of the book, for me, was how Rollo put tension between ethics and Game. Rollo discusses the short-lived push for \"Ethical Game\" in pickup circles, where players, witnessing the havoc they wreaked, wanted to leave girls better than they found her. This fad was short-lived, Rollo explains, because it's inherently contradictory with playing the game.\n\n\"Unless you intend to make her a permanent fixture in your life,\" writes Rollo, as he quashes this noble pursuit of aspiring knights in shining armor, \"there is no way to leave her better than you found her.\"\n\nBefore understanding this claim, we must be aware of Rollo's underlying premises and the context.\n\nThe idea of alpha widowing is when a woman has great sex with a man she can't lock down and thus will never be satisfied with a lesser man in bed in the future. Additionally, for every man a woman has sex with, she becomes less capable of creating a deep emotional bond with her partner.\n\nFor each man she dates, she invests her limited sexual youth, her sexual agency, and her ability to pair bond. And every man she dates, according to Rollo, will always be a net loss for her if she doesn't get the ring, children, or a promise of permanent security.\n\nAn essential concept in understanding these premises is SMV—sexual market value. The idea here is that women's only real agency over men is their sexuality, and their sexual attractiveness generally declines from their mid-twenties.\n\nIn other words, men find older women with a rich sexual past (with guys who are hotter than themselves) generally less desirable for a permanent relationship, and being a single mom does not help.\n\nThis is interesting because if we consider ethics, Rollo's statement \"you cannot leave her better off\" seems contradictory to one of the cornerstones of Game - namely, that of plate spinning and, uh, just dating and having sex in general.\n\nThe concept of plate spinning is seeing multiple women simultaneously (without the deception of false exclusivity). It is a strategy for getting a larger range of options for sexual satisfaction and even pursuing a high-quality long-term relationship.\n\nYou benefit from having options because it reduces neediness and avoids the pitfall of oneitis, an unhealthy fixation on a single woman. With plenty of options, you get an abundance mindset and therefore become more charismatic and successful with women. It is seen as a long-term strategy to get a high-quality relationship because the theory is that, ironically, if you don't obsess about one woman too much, you have a greater chance of getting her.\n\nIt seems to me that Rollo's stance is that, although we ought to strive to minimize any potential harm in our interactions with women by being honest to the best of our capacity, there are no viable means to avoid inflicting any damage at all, no route to absolute positivity for her. Yet, despite this realization, he posits that it remains in the man's best interest to behave in such a way for the sake of his own personal advantage.\n\nRollo dismisses ethical criticism of Plate spinning by saying that they operate from the viewpoint of societal constructs aimed to curtail male dominance. However, by his very own premises, the act of juggling multiple women is inherently harmful, not just for the female, but perhaps even for the ethical tenets governing the actions of a responsible man.\n\nRollo contends that plate spinning is commendable, as it adheres to the male sexual imperative. The question arises - what exactly is this imperative, and why does it seem to disregard ethics?\n\nHere are some statements from the book about ethics:\n\nScrewing others is screwing yourself up.\n\nGiving value makes you happier long term than taking value.\n\nLying and manipulation are unadvisable.\n\nIt's paradoxical that a man would bet on his \"male sexual imperative,\" as Plate Theory prescribes, even though it leads to ethical and long-term dissatisfaction. Is a man not better off being happy and \"not screwed up\" in the sexual marketplace? The concept of giving value instead of taking it seems to be at odds with the ethic of advancing the male imperative at the expense of the female one.\n\nLet's organize what Rollo is saying more succinctly:\n\n1) Plate spinning is commendable because it optimizes your sexual success.\n\n2) You should be ethical because it makes you successful/happy/not screwed up long term.\n\n3) Ethical Game cannot work. You can't leave a woman better than you found her.\n\nSo it appears, my dear players, that we've got ourselves in a knot of contradictions. However, without discarding Rollo's apparently contradictory statements, there are a few things to consider in trying to resolve this.\n\nWays of gaining the benefit of plate spinning without sexual relations\n\nAccording to a simple interpretation of Rollo's premise, one can offer another the gifts of memorable experiences and the treasures of personal growth, but it could be laid to waste in a single heated moment. Without the promise of permanence, the woman can become yet another defeated warrior of the ruthless battleground of biological imperatives with nothing but a dignity stolen, a heart shattered, and a soul scarred by a penetration far deeper than the depths of her sacred flesh.\n\nIt's inaccurate to say the exact moment of intercourse is the turning point of what makes a relationship disadvantageous for the woman. For starters, it isn't the only access to her sexuality or the only type of her investment.\n\nCompared to everything that leads up to it, intercourse is not necessarily the all-emotionally-consuming, spiritually-bonding nuclear bomb some would make it out to be. The gentle touch of a hand, the meeting of lips, the collision of naked flesh, the playful exploration of our bodies' outer and inner regions, each of these steps holds significance in its own right. It should not be overshadowed by what is deemed to be the one and only significant act.\n\nIt's a mistake to fixate solely on the tangible, inside or outside, black or white, yes or no. Though the physical undoubtedly holds significance, the principles of evolutionary psychology cannot explain its mysterious power. We cannot neglect the importance of the intangible - the spiritual and the psychological states in which these actions lead up to and result.\n\nNow, if we don't determine that having intercourse is the point where the relationship can be categorized as \"leaving her worse than you found her,\" what is?\n\nOf course, there is a certain degree of ethical accountability every step of the way. Rollo posits in his Plate theory essay that as long as you are honest with the woman, you bear no ethical responsibility for leaving her worse off. I respectfully disagree because it presupposes a simplified notion of truth that disregards the extent to which women are emotional creatures ;)\n\nAnd in general, it's far too simplistic to say that honesty alleviates any moral responsibility from what you're causing.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to reconcile the contradiction with an analogy of chess to push the idea that sexual imperatives are irrelevant in ethics.\n\nWhen you set up a trap to win a game of chess and get ahead of your opponent, it doesn't necessarily mean you're being unethical. Instead, you're just playing the game more skillfully.\n\nThe teaching of Jesus: \"whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them,\" is interesting in the context of a competition. You don't necessarily want your opponent to beat you in a chess game. But you also want your opponent to try their best and play the game with you - playing by the rules. There is a conflict of interest here, so we can see that ethics play on different dimensions where some rules apply and others don't.\n\nThe question is, then, do the sexual dynamics between men and women play in a contained, adversarial game like chess?\n\nMy problem with this interpretation is that sexual relationships, like any other type of human relationship, have both adversarial and complementary aspects. So it's not obvious why the ethical principles should not apply to this type of human relationship if it is not merely a justification for moral lack.\n\nThe problem lies in the inability to draw a clear distinction between \"her\" as an individual and \"her sexual imperative\" as an inherent facet of her being. Our sexual motives run deep and are woven into the fabric of our being. Attempting to bifurcate fundamental parts of our beings would grant us moral flexibility of great convenience: \"I did not hurt you; I only hurt your sexual imperative,\" which is a strong incentive to be extra skeptical toward this line of thinking.\n\nQuestioning the \"permanent fixture of your life\" exception.\n\nThere seems to be a growing idea that the purpose of relationships is for the growth of the individual. Therefore, when they stagnate in their personal development, the function of the relationship has been fulfilled, and they move on to the next person who will be more instrumental to their self-actualization.\n\nThus, in this view, permanence or children is not necessary for a relationship to be win-win. This is advocated by those who believe our highest purpose is self-actualization, not establishing a family as soon as possible because of the pressures of the sexual market.\n\nI will not opine on this individualistic outlook but rather emphasize that the truth we all know but sometimes forget. We should want to become the type of person we'd like our loved one to be. For a relationship to work - both have to be compatible in personal character and how you perceive relationships and the world. The best way to improve your relationships is to become the person you want to be with. This is a great motivation to be a better person.\n\nConclusion\n\nI have to conclude that something is wrong with The Red Pill's premises.\n\nPlate theory has its flaws. While I can appreciate that having an abundance of options makes a man even more likely to get more options, an abundance mindset does not necessarily require spinning plates. Moreover, believing it does has two negative consequences, firstly, men become even more desperate for sex and secondly, men tangle themselves up with women for all the wrong reasons.\n\nBut I completely understand it's a much better strategy than feeling morally obligated to only talk to one girl at a time. And then always end up blowing it because you start thinking about her too much and fail, then become depressed. That's not a good cycle.\n\nThe golden mean is to have an abundance mindset regardless. This is, of course, easier said than done, especially considering how our duty to fulfill our sexual imperative is such a cause of existential dread. But it's important to voice that not only is it possible, but it's also ideal. Unfortunately, there isn't enough emphasis on this in the manosphere.\n\nOn the whole, I see what Rollo is trying to do. He correctly exposes a problem where the well-being of women is becoming the only concern of society. For example, Hillary Clinton said: \"Women have always been the primary victims of war. Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat.\"\n\nObviously, I agree with Rollo. Men need to stop being a doormat for the female imperative. But what I believe ultimately, they need not be of disadvantage to the female imperative or female individuals in doing that.\n\nWhat I believe in any human interaction, especially sexual relationships, is that the person who did the least amount of damage to the other person will have the healthier relationship next time around.\n\nAs I pointed out, there's no black-or-white ethical or unethical way to go about this. Even withholding intercourse or being completely honest, or even both, isn't a strong enough sun factor for the hot rays of emotional toll. (Weird analogy, I know.)\n\nRegarding \"you cannot leave a woman better than you found her,\" my main difficulty here is that I got problems with the premises. I can't, with good faith, make a clear line between the \"female/male imperative\" and the \"personal imperative\" or her \"SMV\" and \"Life quality.\" There is too much overlap. It also presumes a false notion that the \"sexual market value\" is a universal numerical dimension scale. Everyone competes in the same market with the same currency and values.\n\nAdditionally, the idea that you're sabotaging someone's future contentment by having fun with them is highly questionable. There are many premises here that are up to scrutiny. I will explore them another day. More fundamentally, however, is my disagreement with the premise that the world is merely a physical place, that ethics is negotiable, and that there is a zero-sum game between sexual imperatives.\n\nWhile men and women, like any other separate beings in the world, have conflicting interests in one paradigm, they share a more significant common purpose to pursue the same end. Ethical Game is about playing in the spirit of the sexual game with her - aligning it with the deeper games in which this power dynamic is encapsulated.\n\nWhile \"You cannot leave a woman better than you found her\" rings true to many ears, so too with Plate Theory; they conflict when understood in a flawed paradigm."
