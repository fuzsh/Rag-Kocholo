        "text": "Engravings works best when taken in as a whole, but there are a few standout moments which deserve their own space. “Irby Tremor” overlays a scorched earth blues guitarline over top the cluttered percussion of ghost towns left to rot in the post-war era. The track is at once bleak and uplifting, a tome to the will of people who worked to build these places in the name of progress and a better life — as well as the inevitable degradation of their efforts and the lands they displaced.\n\nAlbum single “The Weight of Gold” also stands out against the gritty geography by wrapping another beautiful guitar line and an accompanying vocal sample — which calls to mind Forest Swords’ Rattling Cage EP — around the skeletal rhythm section of some unmarked dub joint. Like the best producers in that genre, Barnes manages to conjure powerful thematic imagery from empty space armed with a few dingy percussive samples and well-placed delay feedback.\n\nElsewhere the album ebbs and flows, darker here, surprisingly lighter there; but the overall vibe is one of mystical awe, and all of this done without resorting to traditional psychedelic tropes. There is sadness and pain as well as beauty and glory. This is earthy, organic music made from the scraps of human endeavors, reminding us that all things are natural and beautiful to a degree, just by way of their existence. Beneath perception, opinion, interest or even faith, there is being; and while our efforts are by no means trivial, they are subject to time. Engravings invites us to look at these movements as a whole and see them as part of the larger evolution of isness and reality.\n\nFrom the Dagger Paths EP\n\nΩ"
