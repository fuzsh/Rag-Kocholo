Her affair becomes an implied commitment to her lover, so having sex with the husband is now âcheatingâ on him. With every lay she feels,..\n\nfeels worse, resents the husband, manifest her contempt for him for not seeing the signs, compares him to her lover and sees the difference in herself with him and her lover. She comes to resent her decision to pair with the husband before she met the Alpha.\n\nMost Beta husbands rationalize this dynamic away because the Blue Pill teaches them to believe women and trust in âopen communicationâ to solve the whole thing. This only exacerbates that womanâs resentment of him. His Blue Pill idealism becomes an impediment to her,..\n\nsplitting up with her so she can move on to life with her Alpha lover.\n\nMissing some Tweet in this thread?

Women no longer need to look for you IRL. Theyâve had virtual sex with over a thousand men by the time they reach their peak SMV years - all courtesy of Instagram. Their digital consciousness is defined,..\n\n..by the low barrier of attaining the attention they seek for validation and affirming the artificial statuses of their digital selves.\n\nI read guys like Jaron Lanier talk about how social media hires psychology experts to make social media more addictive. Like how a gambling,..\n\n..addiction works. Refresh the feed for another chance at a progressive jackpot of positive reinforcement and dopamine. I wasnât joking when I said that social media rewires womenâs brains the way porn does for men. But now women use Instagram for sexual selection the way,..\n\nRead 5 tweets\n\nâI wasnât ready to be a parent.â\n\nTranslation: âDespite readily available birth control, I got pregnant twice by a man (men?) who my Hypergamous subconscious knew was not the âbest I could doâ so I terminated those children to continue my search for the âright guyâ.\n\nItâs time we look at abortion from the perspective of the utility it provides to women. Yes, women. Because they are the only ones making that decision, to the (proud) exception of anything a man might say about it.\n\nWomen get indignant about men ever presuming to have a vested interest in her reproductive choices, so yeah, you own everything that goes with it.\n\nAnd yes, men should have a say in your reproductive choices when you are the sole arbiter of life & death.\n\nRead 7 tweets\n\nOnce Trump defeated Hillary, the stakes were raised.\n\nIâm not here to debate politics, but the gender landscape has undeniably, unignorably, altered in the two years since a hyper-masculinized man put down the bid of a hyper-gynocentrist female-supremacist woman for the presidency she believed she was entitled to.\n\nWe didnât witness Trump defeat Hillary, we witnessed HIM defeat HER. The Gestalt Masculine prevailed over the sure-thing, âher turnâ presumed victory of the Gestalt Feminine.\n\nRead 16 tweets\n\nRelated threads\n\nðºð¸ Man Having an Affair with @OmarMN Received $230K from Her Campaign\n\nð saraacarter.com/the-man-havingâ¦\n\nOmarâs campaign paid Tim Mynettâs E.

It is important that from adolescence onwards, a more mature attitude to see and experience sexuality should be nurtured.\n\nC.c - @arpita_pedia\n\n#sex #gay #Lgbtq #men2men #girl2girl #pleasure #desire #samesex\n\nSex should be experienced as a vital, dynamic aspect of human interplay, rather than just a physical act or episode in our own lives\n\n#sex #gay #Lgbtq #men2men #girl2girl #pleasure #desire #samesex\n\nThe school of thought to be encouraged in this process should involve acknowledging, accepting and displaying confident masculine and feminine characteristics, without either provoking or submitting to erotic temptation. #sex #gay #Lgbtq #men2men #girl #pleasure #desire #samesex\n\nRead 6 tweets\n\nLeonid Teyf,Â 57, currently living in Raleigh, North Carolina, is charged with bribing a public official, planning a murder-for-hire, and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number, and unlawful use of a visa procured through false claims.Â justice.gov/usao-ednc/pr/fâ¦\n\n\"Teyf is also charged with multiple counts of money laundering in conspiracy with his wife, Tatyana Teyf, 41, a Russian citizen, and Alexsy Timofeev, 37, also a Russian citizen currently residing in Darien, Illinois.\"\n\n\"The superseding indictment alleges that between 2010 and 2012, Leonid Teyf was the Deputy Director of Voentorg, a company which contracted with Russiaâs Ministry of Defense to provide the Russian military with goods and services.\"\n\nRead 9 tweets\n\nJuly 2016.
