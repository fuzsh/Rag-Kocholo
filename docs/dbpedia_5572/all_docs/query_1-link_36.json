        "text": "Tag Archives: Rolo Tomassi\n\nINTERVIEW: Heriot: Rising Stars of The UK’s Metal Underground\n\nThe last two years have been a hell of a ride for Heriot, the English Post Hardcore/Extreme Metal band who have experienced a rebirth of sorts and are firmly riding the crest of a wave on a distinct upward trajectory. They started life in 2016 as a three-piece, consisting of Jake Packer (vocals/bass), Erhan Alman (guitar), and Julian Gage (drums), but in 2020 drafted in former Dead Hands guitarist Deb Gough, applying depth to their musicianship, while also adding a new voice for the band to share vocal duties with Jake, enabling an intriguing expansion of their sound.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nALBUM REVIEW: Rolo Tomassi – Where Myth Becomes Memory\n\nThey say no band is really an “overnight success” in the music industry. Like most cliches, that one has been ridden into the ground by lazy people. Rolo Tomassi has been a band for over fifteen years at this point, and if their ascent to the top of the underground metal genre has taken you by surprise, you just weren’t paying attention. The band has been DIY (with some proper distro mixed in) the entire way, making music on their own terms, gathering forces of fans and waves of respect. Wearing many musical masks and expertly jumping from Grindcore, to Thrash, Hardcore, Pop Rock and even Blackened extremism, the band has always sported loads of talent and great songs. For their debut album for MNRK Music, Where Myth Becomes Memory, the band is determined to change your perception of the band, even if you are a longtime fan.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nRolo Tomassi Shares New Video, New “Where Myth Becomes Memory” Album Coming Soon\n\nRising Metal band Rolo Tomassi will release their huge, expansive and ambitious, brand new album Where Myth Becomes Memory on February 4th, 2022 through MNRK.
