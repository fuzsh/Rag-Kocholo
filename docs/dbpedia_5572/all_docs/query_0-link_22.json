        "text": "It's 11pm on a December Saturday night, and there's an ominous rumbling in the bowels of Manchester's Piccadilly train station. Underneath the tracks, in a cavernous bunker, nearly 2,000 people are dancing in the murk. Gurning faces loom out of the dark like gargoyles. The chemical tang of poppers sours the air.\n\nOnstage, Oxford five-piece Foals are barely distinguishable from the audience, scruffily dressed in threadbare jeans and cheap plimsolls. Their 10-song set, fizzing with nervous energy, possesses a lean funk sensibility. It is, essentially, an unfolding fusion of the pared-down explorations of modern jazz, the avant-garde textures of post-rock, and dance music's pulsing beats, all of which, quite possibly, means absolutely nothing to the kids crammed against the barrier, high on enthusiasm. There is no denying that this is whip-smart art.\n\nTwo weeks later, Southend four-piece These New Puritans are awkwardly posing for pictures in an east London Victorian poor school. Drummer George Barnett, 20, returned last night from a trip to Berlin. His twin brother Jack, bassist Thomas Hein, 21, and 19-year-old keyboardist Sophie Sleigh-Johnson - who remains silent nearly all day - have journeyed from their seaside hometown. All are at odds with what you consider a rock band to be, talking to each other with a stiff-backed politeness, like characters from an Arthur Ransome novel. You suspect that they'd rather wear hair shirts than compromise on a principle. Later, it proves hard to stifle a guffaw, when, on being asked to look into the camera, George says, sulkily, that 'his face doesn't look good at that angle'.\n\nWhen we meet in late December, Devonte 'Dev' Hynes, of Lightspeed Champion, looks cartoonishly nerdy, dressed for lunch in a furry hat, earflaps pulled tight over his ears, his lanky frame inflated by a blue puffa jacket. As well as making music, he draws comics and is a compulsive blogger. He's a classic geek, but a cool one.\n\nThis morning the 22-year-old took delivery of a vinyl pressing of Falling off the Lavender Bridge, his first solo album, released at the end of January on Domino. It is a country-tinged curveball for fans of his noisy previous band, Test Icicles, who cited Mötley Crüe, Pantera and Pharrell Williams as influences before breaking up in 2006 after a riotous 45-minute London show. 'I don't know who everyone's trying to impress all the time, I just do whatever comes naturally,' says Dev, picking over a plate of chicken and chips in a Spitalfields cafe. Nonetheless, 'naturally' for him means taking an unexpectedly bucolic, harmonious direction. That he's singing about 'girls and stomach aches' is almost a given.\n\nThe week before Christmas, amid a gaudy menagerie of east London hipsters, the group known as Ox. Eagle. Lion. Man. are stalking the stage of the Hoxton Bar and Grill with dramatic intent. Frontman Frederick Macpherson, 20, and his bandmates Jareth (guitar), 20, Thommas Gunnz (bass), 20, and Eduard Quarmby (drums), 21, perform with Brechtian vigour, drawing as much on the dramatic conventions of cabaret as rock. In conversation before the gig, Macpherson, who goes by the stage name Frederick Blood-Royale, leads his own fight against modern vulgarity, covering pop culture ('I almost feel ashamed when I go home and watch Neighbours. I feel like I've let down my forefathers'), consideration ('If someone's made it their life to make music for you to listen to, I can't have it on in the background while I'm making a fucking bacon sandwich'), sobriety ('There's nothing to gain from choosing chemicals or alcohol to change your reality. Nothing can take you away bar death'), and artistry ('I write music for the mind. For the library'). He is immensely entertaining.\n\nThere has always been a place in rock'n'roll for cerebral outsiders, from the Velvet Underground to Pulp via the Smiths. And 'indie' has always been their badge. In the Eighties, you couldn't move for legions of floppy-fringed fops, cottage empires such as Postcard Records and the likes of Franz Ferdinand and the Libertines have never gone away. But ever since Britpop, when Oasis came to dominate the landscape like King Kong in an anorak, a swaggering aesthetic has taken hold. Suddenly indie meant dopey blokes, the sort who looked like plumbers. With guitars. They were moptop traditionalists, full of laddish bravado, appealing to the lowest common denominator. But now indie rock is as much about the yawningly inoffensive stadium drip of your Coldplays and Razorlights as anything else. It has become more ubiquitous than ever: co-opted by Tesco and your dad, by mobile phone adverts and the girl next door.\n\nIn the space of 12 months, though, the story has started to change. The smart kids are looking further afield. These days, it's practically mandatory for any self-respecting new band to stitch together dizzyingly idiosyncratic sounds. Listen to synthetic futurists Late of the Pier, or the acid bleeps of Canadian duo Crystal Castles, the day-glo synth hooks of Metronomy, the schizoid grindie mash-up of Hadouken!, Vampire Weekend's 'Upper East Side Soweto' vibes or the avant-funk wigouts of Battles. Or perhaps you'd prefer Tigerpicks' fairground-punk, perky Mancunian boy-girl duo the Ting Tings, the gaudy electronica of XX Teens, or the eclectic art-pop of frYars. Not since the mid-Eighties' post-punk boom has indie looked so diverse and colourful, nor have there been so many bands with stupid names.\n\nFrankly, the iPod/ MySpace/ Google generation - whichever sobriquet you care to slap on it - expect no less. For good or ill, the techno maelstrom has ushered in a new age of DIY discovery. The linear pop narrative which once saw Oasis neatly dubbed the Sex Beatles is a grizzled irrelevance: music history has collapsed in on itself. Everything, from Gregorian chants to Captain Beefheart, from Steve Reich to Stevie Wonder, from Sandy Denny to PiL, is fair game.\n\nTake the acts that OMM is particularly championing: Foals are informed by everyone from Fugazi to techno, from Gwen Stefani to Ethiopiques; Lightspeed Champion can rave about the genius of Weezer, and in the same breath praise Girls Aloud; Frederick Macpherson looks to King Crimson and Seventies prog while thrilling about dubstep and bassline niche; Jack Barnett is as much a fan of Wu-Tang Clang as German noise experimentalists Einstürzende Neubauten.\n\nThe New Yorker critic Sasha Frere-Jones recently ignited debate in US indie circles after accusing the likes of the Arcade Fire and Wilco of being musically myopic. 'Why did so many white rock bands retreat from the ecstatic singing and intense, voice-like guitar tones of the blues, the heavy African downbeat, and the elaborate showmanship that characterised black music of the mid-20th century?' he asked. This is not an accusation that can be levelled at any of these British bands in 2008.\n\nThis new breed have assumed the thinking person's mantle, recognising that music can be a crucible for grand gestures and condensing big ideas nicked from literature, history and cultural icons into simple mantras. For the sake of a soundbite, let's call them the New Eccentrics. As the author Dave Eggers, writing in Spin, observed, (about the Polyphonic Spree, but we can disregard this as his point holds true) nowadays audiences are hungry for bands that actually do something; who create a sense of mystery, glamour and showmanship, instead of crafting stodgy meat'n'spuds rock with Everyman appeal.\n\nIn part, this is a reaction to the Sixties-obsessed white rock that has dominated for 15 years. Such throwbacks do still exist, from the breast-ogling Pigeon Detectives to current Mancunian hot tips the Courteeners, - but they won't find favour with their sharper-thinking peers.\n\n'It just feels like you're protecting a lie. Retro indie-rock records take you to a place that is entirely fantasy,' says Foals' 21-year-old Yannis Philippakis, sipping on a pre-gig Negroni in Manchester, a taste acquired while working in an Oxford cocktail bar. 'It's like coffee-stained picture postcards from the Sixties. It's a shame that people feel so alienated from the present culture that they need to find security in something that is long dead.'\n\nApart from guitarist Jimmy Smith, who has a geography degree from Hull, Foals are university dropouts. Yannis and keyboardist Edwin Congreave quit Oxford after spending their first year in the St John's college practice rooms with Jimmy and fellow bandmates Jack Bevan and Walter Gervers. 'There were violins and shit next door,' he chuckles. The band share toothbrushes, beds, pants and shirts. In Yannis's words, they are 'as tight as five males can be, without descending into something that's more than platonic'.\n\nIn 2007, two years after they got together, Foals received acclaim for two singles, 'Mathletics' and 'Hummer', both of which were released on indie label Transgressive. Characteristically, they've chosen to leave the songs, their best known, off their album Antidotes, which is due in March.\n\nAs befits their background, Foals are champs of intelligent hedonism, their rider staples the Guardian and packs of Marlboro Reds. And while, live, they take their inspiration from high-velocity disco devilry, their album is a more artistic affair. Recorded in a sunless concrete bunker in Williamsburg, New York, with TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek, the 11-song set is heavily influenced by afrobeat, even featuring voodoo brass from Brooklyn's Antibalas. As such it rubber-stamps the suggestion that they are utterly unafraid of making clever music. Clever music that is quite brilliant.\n\nThe son of a Greek instrument maker and an anthropologist, frontman Yannis is a self-confessed control freak. He blabs on at length, his thoughts spiralling off like sparks from a Catherine wheel. Every so often he covers the microphone when he slags people off and says things like, 'You're not going to put this in. Seriously, if I see one thing about it I'm going to freak.' He's neurotic and self-conscious, but also fiercely bright. In his early teens, Yannis fronted the smart-arsed, but musically impenetrable, band the Edmund Fitzgeralds. During school holidays, they'd take their complex math rock around the toilet circuit in peripheral northern towns. He began Foals with best friend Andrew Mears (now of post-rock group Youth Movies) as a response to the seriousness of the Fitzgeralds and as an irritant to Oxford's 'very insular, self-applauding, neo-prog scene'. Their plan? 'To form this pop band that makes people dance and then we'll play at house parties and steal all these people's girlfriends.' An idea that has come to fruition, he reveals. 'Yeah, that's happened many times over. We call it stealing ex-friends' girlfriends.' Still, Yannis takes the notion of being a rock star very seriously.\n\nAs do These New Puritans, whose name hints, aptly, at Presbyterian austerity, discipline and drive. 'We always wanted to be different from our everyday selves. Always asking what is TNP and answering in a different way every second. Bands are too happy just being themselves,' says sombre-eyed leader Jack Barnett. His ambition is typical of the new order, springing from a drive to succeed on their own terms. TNP's debut EP, 2006's 'Now Pluvial', was released on a limited-edition seven-inch vinyl before they offered it up as a free download for 24 hours and then deleted it. With their sharp, elegantly tailored clothes, the group, who formed in 2005, could easily have stepped from a nouvelle vague film. Indeed some quarters have sniffily dismissed them as being a bit 'fashion'; an idea not helped by exotic Parisian designer Hedi Slimane adopting them as his muse for his 2007 Dior Homme show.\n\nTheir debut album, Beat Pyramid, released this month on Angular, should silence the naysayers. It is forward-thinking, idiosyncratic and astonishing. Jack is responsible for much of the sonic palette (in tandem with producer Gareth Jones), applying the sort of attention to detail that a medieval monk would lavish on a manuscript. Their spartan songs, full of chilly disengagement, hypnotic electronic textures and brutal beats, feature an unsettling amount of imponderable symbolism: numerology, rain, synchronicity, 'swords of truth' and, because Jack is a scamp as well as a high-minded character, Michael Barrymore wanking in Milton Keynes.\n\nThe Barnett brothers often look to each other when talking. Answers, when they are forthcoming, can be quickly contradicted. George is the eldest by several minutes and more outwardly confident. His mordant sense of humour leaves you wondering where exactly he places himself on the irony scale.\n\n'I don't think I'm a nice person. I realise I can be an arsehole,' he says with a foxy glint.\n\n'We make a lot of enemies, don't we?' agrees Jack with a slow smile.\n\nThe duo seem to instinctively sidestep preconceptions and labels, feeding off negative energy in the same way that other bands lap up plaudits. George says he's already bored with the new album. Jack once went to sleep on stage for half an hour during a gig in Spain while they played a song called 'Doppelganger'.\n\nJack: 'It's not like we're trying to be an intelligent band.'\n\nGeorge: 'Yeah, that's crap. I keep reading things like that and, personally, I don't like it.'\n\nThey are, Jack explains, not about intelligence or science but magic.\n\nAlong with a collective taste for silly haircuts, there is a blithe arrogance among these groups. If you were charitable, you could call it self-confidence. It is the typical sense of entitlement that comes from a good public school education.\n\n'We write for people who have something more in their heads than banality and indulgence,' says Ox. Eagle frontman Frederick Macpherson over a snack of chicken dumplings and lemonade in a Hoxton noodle bar. 'We don't sit in our rooms talking about how we only want the greatest minds of our generation to listen to our music and the rest can fuck off. I just hope that fans of our music have a slight interest in the finer things in life.'\n\nWhile These New Puritans are well spoken, Macpherson is a proper west London posho. He has a deep, buttery voice that makes semi-quavers sound like biblical portents of doom. When he declares that his is 'the worst generation that history has ever produced', you think of the gloomy, poor little rich boy character in Hal Ashby's black comedy Harold and Maude. Nevertheless, you can't help but be swayed by his determination to transform rock into an intelligent medium.\n\nOx. Eagle are a fledgling proposition, having formed from the ashes of the Libertines-esque Les Incompetents, a group that Macpherson dismisses as 'teenage and silly'. They put out one single at the tail end of last year on Transgressive, a double A-side called 'Motherhood/ Fatherhood,' released on seven-inch and, strangely, VHS. 'VHS is an even more archaic format than a seven-inch. Not only will it be seen as a novelty, but you'll have to make a really concerted effort to enjoy it,' says Frederick. 'It represents age and time and decay, and I hope that means something.' More interesting still, 'Motherhood' ruminates on the trauma of postnatal depression. It is sung from an empathetic and emotionally literate viewpoint.\n\nIf these bands are not quite on hugging terms with their feminine side, they are more sensitive than we've come to expect. Lightspeed Champion's album, for instance, which was recorded in Nebraska with Saddle Creek producer Mike Mogis, oozes beautifully crafted melody and unmediated emotion.\n\nDev's brain is teeming with ideas. He reels off notions for three albums that exist in his head, one of which is a blaxploitation number. His former band, Test Icicles, sold diddly-squat and sounded like idiots. ('We were never, ever that keen on the music. I understand that people liked it, but we personally, er, didn't,' said Dev when they disbanded.) But they were a key act, pioneering a chaotic, fearless cross-fertilisation of metal, hip hop and indie.\n\nHis first solo effort takes an entirely different tack, its lyrics dissecting failing relationships, teen sex, and love, evoking an atmosphere of dirty realism. Dev is a compulsive blogger, too, chronicling his life with naked honesty. 'I didn't realise people read my blog until recently,' he says. 'I'd talk about failed attempts to talk to girls and people would come up to me and be like, \"That's a shame you didn't talk to that girl.\"'\n\nDespite good school results at school in Essex, he got distracted from pursuing further education. 'I went to six form for two weeks, and on the way there ... I just went to the skate park and never went back,' he explains impassively.\n\nDev, who took his name from one of his comic characters, is a daydreamy type. He lives in a hermetically sealed bubble of his own making. 'There's nothing I dislike because if I dislike it I just ignore it; it doesn't exist to me,' he says. Currently homeless, he confesses that he's also girlfriend-less and needs to be looked after. The word 'obsessive' crops up in his vocabulary at least every third sentence.\n\nYou're quite probably huffing that life is too short to bother with snotty middle-class pseuds slumming it in rock. You might even be wishing that they'd choke on their own smart-arsed erudition and stop trying so hard. But at the Foals gig in Manchester, rough-tongued beer boys mingle with coquettish indie girls, T-shirted techno trainspotters with up-for-it pill-heads. Rock'n'roll needs extremes - from working-class hellcats to posh fops, from knucklehead rockers to highbrow thinkers - to work properly.\n\nAny attempt to grasp at the zeitgeist can result in comical crudeness. But there is an undeniable shared aesthetic here. A crop of bands who are unashamedly principled, smart and adventurous. Committed students of music, borrowing craftily from multiracial, multicultural sources. And while, intellectually, they may not be the finished article, their enthusiasm is engaging, opening an unlikely gateway to multifarious elements of music and culture.\n\nThe last word goes to Foals motormouth Yannis Philippakis. 'The moment that the tag 'this band is going to save rock'n'roll' started, that was when you knew rock'n'roll was dead, man. Optimistically, our band in some small, quiet way stand for something that goes against the super-sexed, super-consumerist, over-packaged music industry and comes from an authentic place.'\n\nQ&A: These New Puritans\n\nOMM: What's your opinion of bands with a very retro sound, like the Courteeners or the Enemy?\n\nGeorge Barnett: I've never heard them, but they're too obsessed with reality.\n\nJack Barnett: And love songs.\n\nGB: We live in a different world. There should be more magic.\n\nOMM: Your lyrics are full of clues. Do fans get carried away reading meanings into them?\n\nJB: People think we're new age. I always write lyrics just before I go to sleep, at two in the morning. Half asleep, half awake, so they're kind of on the edge. They're dream lyrics. Sleep is a really big thing. I go to sleep on stage. Like, when we played in Spain every night I would go to sleep.\n\nOMM: Have you got narcolepsy?\n\nJB: No. I've always wanted to do it. When you're on stage you don't always feel like performing or entertaining people. So if I don't I go to sleep. Then I'm recharged and I can do dramatic stuff.\n\nOMM: Couldn't this be perceived as rudeness?\n\nJB: No, I've always wanted to do it.\n\nGB: I strive to make enemies. It's much more enjoyable. I hate all these people that get off on a rock'n'roll lifestyle. I'm not into that.\n\nOMM: Do you ever get concerned that your songs are perhaps too esoteric for fans to grasp?\n\nGB: I don't think you ever think about fans, do you?\n\nJB: Probably not.\n\nOMM: At what level do you connect with your fans?\n\nGB: I just usually deny any existence.\n\nJB :You always pretend you're not in the band.\n\nGB: That's usually the best way.\n\nOMM: Don't you enjoy it?\n\nGB: It's not something I personally set out to do.\n\nOMM: Are you self-critical as a band?\n\nJB: [To George] You are. You rip everything apart.\n\nGB: It's quite fun. It's very volatile.\n\nOMM: How important is the image of the group?\n\nJB: It's important because people ignore it. It's always there so you might as well acknowledge it. Other bands just look ridiculous. I don't like the people with big floppy hair who hide under it. I really don't like the way most people look, especially bands.\n\nGB: Yeah, what do we like looking like? Eagles and St Michael. I've got a postcard of it. It makes me feel a bit more masculine.\n\nJB: [to George] Can you grow a beard?\n\nGB: Probably not.\n\nJB: Moustache?\n\nGB: A moustache might appeal. When I was in Germany I was surprised how many people had that Hitler thing. Loads of them, all the old men. Like, fucking hell.\n\nOMM: What was growing up in Southend like?\n\nJB: It's just a vacuum.\n\nGB: It's a horrible place.\n\nOMM: Were you encouraged to make your own entertainment?\n\nJB: Yeah, 'cause it's such an amorphous, boring place. In London everyone's done everything, it's got too much history already, but in Southend it's got nothing so you can do what you want. You can map it in your own way because it's a blank slate.\n\nQ&A: Foals\n\nOMM: Do Foals have a manifesto? You've mentioned that one of your aims is to always progress.\n\nYannis Philippakis: Nothing written, most of it's telepathic. Like the way me and Jimmy [Smith] play guitar; we'd only ever play above the 12th fret and that way everything was clean. That's already changing; we find it fun to work within limitations for a while and when they become stale we set new limitations.\n\nOMM: Describe your musical tastes?\n\nYP: We like a lot of minimal German techno, and stuff like Matthew Dear. Really brutal Eighties music like Skinny Puppy. We'll listen to a type of music intensely for six months. Literally, like, we only listen to techno and Jack [Bevan] would occasionally put on a rock record and we'd be like, No way, man! We get into this addictive hysteria about music. I look at us like vultures picking up what's left from the carcass. Garage rock has been recycled three times so very little remains. If there's any meat left then we take it and create a new thing out of that.\n\nOMM: How does the tour lifestyle suit you?\n\nYP: It's like the best time of your life and the worst time of your life simultaneously. I shattered my big toe three days after I saw you [in Manchester]. I kind of flipped and kicked through my amp. After being on tour for three months - not sleeping and over-indulging - in the heat of the moment you make a fucking stupid decision. It was funny at the time, I guess.\n\nOMM: What did producer Dave Sitek bring to the album?\n\nYP: What we were hungry for, and what Sitek brought, was the realisation that it's OK to adopt elements of sound from the past and make something that is more progressive than if you just use Pro Tools or do something ultra-modern that dates quickly. If you can blend different elements that are culturally and chronologically different then you've got something that's exciting. To me, this album's got a lot of soul and a lot of things that permeate over a number of listens.\n\nOMM: What's made you happy recently?\n\nYP: Gardening for my Mum about a month ago. Gardening's my favourite thing. I fucking love it.\n\nQ&A: Lightspeed Champion\n\nOMM: When you dropped out of college at 16, did you have any fears about not following a conventional path?\n\nLightspeed Champion: Yeah. I was probably terrified up until two months ago. Actually, my band tease me because recently we were doing uni sessions and we'd go into these campuses and I'd be wide-eyed. It's so crazy. I want to go to college one day. I don't know what I'd study, maybe film. Everything else I love too much to hear someone else talk about it.\n\nOMM: Who inspired you to become a musician?\n\nLC: Rivers Cuomo from Weezer. I learn the whole back catalogues of people that I like. I took a Weezer test online the other day and got 100 per cent!\n\nOMM: Have you ever met Cuomo?\n\nLC: Oh my God! No. I'm not good at meeting people I worship.\n\nOMM: Why do you turn to so many different mediums - comics, music, blogging ?\n\nLC: I really don't know. I like the idea of chronicling my life. I don't want to look back and not have things for me to look at. It's all selfish.\n\nOMM: Have you finished your Lightspeed Champion comic yet?\n\nLC: Yeah. I showed it to a friend of mine, the second person to have ever seen it, and he kind of liked it, so we'll see what happens. It didn't set the world on fire. I accidentally walked into a Jeffrey Lewis show yesterday. I didn't actually see him play, but he was selling his comics. He's actually good at comics. I've never been confident in my drawing.\n\nOMM: Falling off the Lavender Bridge is a huge step away from the sound of Test Icicles.\n\nLC: Yes, it is. That's probably why I'm constantly apologetic, because it's what I wanted to hear. But that reason nowadays isn't good enough in music. What interviewers want to hear in interviews is, I was on tour and heard a Bob Dylan song. I've never heard a Bob Dylan song! I just wanted to hear music like this. I think my album is quite weird.\n\nOMM: Does your mood affect your work rate?\n\nLC: When I'm content enough with life I can write until the end of the world, but when I'm unhappy I can't write. It really bugs me because that's usually when people can write and that's when they can be creative. I want some self-loathing, unhappy, dark songs, and I just can't do it.\n\nOMM: What else are you compulsive about?\n\nLC: Lost. That's actually the peak of television. I don't think it can get better than Lost at the moment. Everything else needs to make a huge step up if it wants to exist in the future.\n\nTen to watch\n\nPrimary 1\n\nFeelgood future funk from 21-year-old Joe Flory, signed to Erol Alkan's label Phantasy Sound.\n\nThe Ting Tings\n\nMancunian power-pop duo.
