        "text": "We Come in Pieces play loud music and have beards. While these two facts alone are enough to make them an essential part of Limerick’s sonic soundscape, WCIP tunes are also earworms delivered with a black sense of humour. Released in late 2010, the band’s debut album ‘Before The Chains’ was a 32 minute long opus that was produced for €600 just three weeks after the band formed. WCIP claim that the album dealt with “major sociological issues such as Die Hard, the shark from Jaws and the effects of gangland crime on a modern urban landscape” and was released “to absolutely no acclaim.”\n\nBut in fact ‘Before The Chains’ was a pure filler-free cacophony that perfectly represented the band’s energetic, high flying live show. Now 2011 has seen the band escape from the confines of institutional education in a bid to take over the roads and live life as a full time band. In February, they toured across the country supporting Rolo Tomassi and made their first trip over to the UK for a week of shows. In April they completed a three week tour of the UK and Ireland in support of their second single ‘Beefy Clyro’. Now July 9 will see the release of their shiny new EP (simply titled We Come In Pieces) and will be followed by month long tour of Ireland and a six week tour of the UK and the band’s first jaunt across Europe."
