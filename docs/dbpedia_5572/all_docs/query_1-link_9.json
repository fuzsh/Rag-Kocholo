        "text": "The past few months have had heavy impacts on our society, revealing deep-rooted issues in the world’s perception of black people. Lady Liberty’s racism has been exposed for the world to see. The cameras are everywhere, and America can no longer run from the truth. She must, quite literally, face the darkness and answer some long-neglected questions about her legacy.\n\nTo give a more accurate and resonating message to whoever is listening, this message is tailored towards men. Men live harder lives than women because we have to become valuable to society; we’re worthless without money and status, whereas women are valued for their looks. Being in a male-dominated society, a woman can be taken care of by a man if the man is inspired enough by her beauty and femininity. A man is expected to pay for both his and a woman’s meal on a date which means he must earn enough to pay for his meal at least twice over to even be considered as a dating prospect. We must be attractive, but even then we are loved for our utility and ability to provide. Due to the differences in our life experiences as men compared to women, I must tailor this message to them.\n\nTo be even more specific, this message is primarily for black men. Why? Because generally, they have the hardest lives. The Asian man is stereotyped as weak. the Latino man is stereotyped as an invader, the Arabic man is stereotyped as dirty. The white man is stereotyped as privileged, but the black man is stereotyped as dangerous. Generally, every woman recognizes that the white man is perceived as the most attractive because he has the highest value in society, that perception reinforced by white media. Not sending shots, just calling a spade a spade. Most people are biased towards the familiarity of their own race, but the white male is the highest value option when it comes to dating someone of a different race.\n\nChina complains to the US about racism yet uses COVID-19 to discriminate against Africans, even though it came from their country. If the Chinese are decrying racism in general in the US, why is there only racism towards Africans in their country? Who cares what the reason is? My point is: You were not supposed to be great. You were subhuman 150-400 years ago. You were killed for liking white women 60 years ago. White women call the police on black men not because they care about them being at the park, but because they want to see the black man dominated by the white authority figure, to serve as a reminder to “stay in your place”. It’s a variation of what Godfather and High Priest of the Red Pill, Rollo Tomassi calls the “Let’s you and him fight” phenomonon. You can read more about it here: https://therationalmale.com/2020/02/25/why-we-fight/\n\nThe world hates you. Accept the dark reality of your existence.\n\nYou are Angra Mainyu, All the World’s Evil\n\nYou are Madara Uchiha, The Savior of the World\n\nYou are Master Xehanort, the Seeker of Darkness\n\nYou are Jiren, the Survivor\n\nYou are Satan, History’s greatest scapegoat\n\nWhat do these legendary figures have in common? They are forsaken for their existence, destined to be defeated, to lose to the “correct” philosophies of their respective universes. Their existence is a disruption to the natural order. A convenient symbol of hate for the world to unify against.\n\nI dislike the term “white privilege” but if you want an understanding of what is meant when that phrase is mentioned, look at plot contrivances in video games and media. Take Naruto for example. How can a wise man and tactical genius like Madara Uchiha who was brought up in harsh times lose to a 16-year old ninja? Because that kid has the “privilege” of being directly related to the Six Path Sage and being brought back from the brink of death, and the classic shonen anime trope of “tHe PoWeR oF fRiEnDsHiP” compared to Madara who planned his resurrection as a part of his greater plan to rule the world. The cultivation of the Rinnegan, the planned resurrection, the manipulation of Obito Uchiha, and the initiation of the Infinite Tsukuyomi, all for a Karen to appropriate his efforts for her own plan and benefit from his hard work. Madara was too powerful, literally fighting the entire world to achieve his ideal, only losing to a plot contrivance. He wasn’t supposed to win, and the powers that be ensured that that was the case. Because of colonialism, the “story” is about you. You are the protagonist and the other races are supporting characters, Hollywood casting is a clear illustration of this dynamic. Is it any coincidence that the romantic comedic movies most accurately reflect the dating experiences of the middle-class white man? Or that Naruto and the Super Saiyans have blond hair and blue eyes?\n\nDark-skinned people, you become an inconvenience to the societal structure when you’re too ambitious. Do you think men of other races are OK with the idea of you fucking their women? Of you darkening their families with melanin? The stereotypical base small-town redneck fumes at the thought of the women in his family having sexual relations with a minority, especially a black man. Even the seemingly well-meaning white liberal may wince at the idea of a black man fucking their sister, mother, or daughter. You might get a sympathy fuck and even then, in some women’s minds, if she regrets the sex she had, that means she was forced to have sex with you, and you’ll be accused of sexual assault. The KKK/Neo Nazi-influenced justice system will be more than happy to play the White Knight and put the evil black thug in jail to protect “his” pretty white princess.\n\nAll around the world, black people are killed for expressing their humanity. You are mocked for not being able to breathe, a basic human necessity. You desperately withstrain your anger, instincts, and your sense of self-respect, begging the world to acknowledge your worth. Only with destruction, chaos, and the pain of loss does the world comply.\n\nThe world doesn’t give a fuck about understanding you. What they understand is power. A white woman won’t understand your struggle, being both white and a woman, the most privileged people on the planet, but they do understand how they feel when they see a high-value man of any race. You must utilize the power of objectification to your advantage. So what if she only wants to fuck you to get back at her father, or ex-boyfriend? So what if she’s only fucking you to try to prove to herself that she’s not a racist? The more women you fuck, the more you will understand their nature. You must become a student of human nature and become a collector of hearts like Master Xehanort.\n\nWhite people, understand that this isn’t written to make you feel guilty. Men of all races have an evolved desire to conquer and dominate, you just did it on a worldwide scale first. You killed the Indians and stole their land. You subjugated the blacks and told the world they were subhuman. You rigged the game towards you using your false god as justification but new balance patches are being implemented and the dynamic is shifting. We know some of you feel guilty about your pasts but some of us aren’t going to wait another 60 years to become the equivalent of a white beta. Equality is a fallacy; people want to either be or follow Number One.\n\nYou must learn to play and enjoy the game on Hard mode. Life will reward you for your efforts because the presence of a High-Value man of any race cannot be faked. Exercise your body, monitor your diet so you don’t become a statistic, staying away from excess sugar, fat, and oil, dying 10 years earlier than the white man on average. Lift heavy weights to build muscle and run fast to burn calories faster. Sleep well to maintain your mental health, and have interesting hobbies that you enjoy that help you become a better man. Read books to increase your knowledge, some personal recommendations include The Rational Male by Rollo Tomassi, The 48 laws of power by Robert Greene, and The Art of Seduction, also by Robert Greene. Invest your money into stocks and diversify your income streams. Learn the psychology behind being a good salesman and sell a product or service to a targeted group. Find mentors of any ethnicity to help guide you on your path, and don’t be afraid to challenge them on their views. These are only general tips, as to go more into detail would go beyond the scope of this article.\n\nConsider moving to another city, state, or country if you’re dissatisfied with your living condition. You must channel your anger into productive ways to overcome your oppression, to create your competitive advantage. Life isn’t fair, but the top performers will disproportionally benefit from their efforts. When you look good, smell nice, dress well, articulate your thoughts well, are well off financially, and have interesting hobbies, you increase your worth to society. Don’t whine about how things should be, lamenting about idealistic fantasies is for the weak. Don’t be one of these fools who doesn’t think you should come out of these times with a new skill, they only wish to share their mediocrity with you. Remember, you’re not supposed to win, so you have to defy your destiny.\n\nYou can do everything “right” and still get fucked over, just like Madara. That’s just the way it is, life was never meant to be fair. Most likely, you reside in an area with access to food, water, and internet. You’re very fortunate to even be alive, let alone feel entitled to anything. However, there’s never been more opportunity than now in human history to achieve success. Good luck on your journey to greatness. Accept the darkness within you, and remember that destiny is never left to chance."
