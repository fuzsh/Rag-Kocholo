        "text": "The Great Depression and the Cinderella Man\n\n895 Words | 2 Pages\n\nCinderella Man came out in the year 2005, it is a non fiction movie directed by Ron Howard. It is based on the story of a boxer during the Depression, James J. Braddock. Braddock had to over come many adversities such as the economical and societal conditions. Another adversity he had to overcome was living in the Depression and all the things that go along with that. Braddock’s character traits shown in the movie are all important and appropriate due to the harshness of those times.\n\nThe Great Depression In The Film Cinderella Man\n\n1501 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThe Great Depression was a time in American history where economic difficulties affected almost every person. It could turn the “best of the best” into just another beggar on the street. It is difficult for a movie to portray the true struggles of people who lives during that time. Although Cinderella Man is a fictional account of the life of Ray Braddock, it is an accurate portrayal of the problems faced by many Americans during the Great Depression. The struggles of daily life during the depression, references to problems later addressed by the New Deal, and social issues brought on by the Great Depression are all realistically described in this movie.\n\nThe Great Depression and John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath\n\n1699 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThe Great Depression and John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath Though most Americans are aware of the Great Depression of 1929, which may well be \"the most serious problem facing our free enterprise economic system\", few know of the many Americans who lost their homes, life savings and jobs. This paper briefly states the causes of the depression and summarizes the vast problems Americans faced during the eleven years of its span. This paper primarily focuses on what life was like for farmers during the time of the Depression, as portrayed in John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, and tells what the government did to end the Depression. In the 1920's, after World War 1, danger signals were apparent that a great Depression was coming.\n\nCinderella Man\n\n696 Words | 2 Pages\n\nCinderella Man is a flim based on the rise of World Championship boxer James Braddock. Braddock's life was affected heavily by the great depression, and the film does well to show this. The film also does a good job of chronicling the life of the everyday man during the great depression. This essay aims to discuss the role of the stock market crash in the beginning of the great depression, the effects of the depression on the life of the everyday man, and the effects of the depression on the life of James J Braddock and his family.\n\nThe Great Depression and the Dirty Thirties\n\n999 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThere were many causes of the Great Depression (need help on the first sentence). Yes, the stock market crash was a main reason of the Depression, but it actually began long before that, with the Roaring 20’s. With such a large disparity between the rich and the poor, the overproduction of goods (too much too quickly), and people racing to buy stocks, it was only fitting that it would soon come to an end. Before it actually crashed, the stock market played an important factor leading up to the Great Depression as well. As people were borrowing money to pay for stocks (on margin), they became more and more in debt, and caused the stock market crash to be a huge surprise to them. During the summer of 1929, an “ordinary recession” occurred, where people stopped buying things and goods piled up, due to their debt. Also, bank firms, which had received record profits during the ’20s, had invested their money into expanding, but as workers were no longer able to continue expanding it, soon had to close. (need help on a thesis statement)\n\nFilms During the Great Depression\n\n573 Words | 2 Pages\n\nA variety of films were created during the Great Depression era. For the most part, the films created between 1929 and 1940 featured a better life. Although the Great Depression took a huge toll on many other industries, the film industry still managed to make large profits compared to other businesses. All these films were produced during the same time period however, they all provide different details about life during this time period; specifically, they provide a different look on how women were treated in the 1930s. Such movies include Room Service, Modern Times, and The Public Enemy. Every film is different from the next, though many have several similarities. Modern Times and Public Enemy are similar to each other because of how they feature women, while Room Service is completely different. In Room Service, women were portrayed as equal to man; while in Modern Times, no women were featured as workers in the factory.\n\nFred Astaires iImpact on the Great Depression\n\n1776 Words | 4 Pages\n\nFamous choreographer George Balanchine once said, “He is the most interesting, the most inventive, the most elegant dancer of our times” and noted dancer Rudolph Nureyev also said, “He was not just the best ballroom dancer, or tap dancer, he was simply the greatest, most imaginative, dancer of our time.” These famous dancers were referring to Fred Astaire, who has been known as one of the greatest dancers of all time. His light, artistic joyful style of dancing has impacted dance in an extremely unique way. Astaire used techniques in films as well as in dance that have shaped society. Astaire was mostly prominent throughout the 1930s during the Great Depression. Everywhere, Americans were looking for some joy in their lives, and Astaire was able to give them hope in a period of history that lacked optimism. Fred Astaire’s carefree dance movement style and techniques, specifically in the films Swing Time and The Gay Divorcee, help America through the Great Depression and signifies the importance of art in this time period.\n\nThe Great Depression In The Cinderella Man\n\n900 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThe Cinderella Man In the movie the Cinderella man who is called James jay Braddock and he is a fighter and in his first fight he broke his hand and had a cast on for 6-8 weeks when he broke his hand the second time he got deregisted from the boxing industry until his hand was healed he could get back into the boxing industry so he could fight again and he fights to keep his family out of poverty.

After the war started, the main focus shifted to wartime propaganda. Film was used to display the war in a way that did not show its true colors—including the censorship of soldier causalities and other negative connotations that are a simple fact of war. There was even a time in which some actors became better known to America than politians. Through films, Hollywood began to make a statement of their anti-Nazi beliefs. They began to make motion pictures for American recruitment into the Army as well as many that supported the war effort, and intended to make other Americans more aware of the war’s effect on the United States, and how people can get involved. Many European countries banned these Hollywood films, as they began to affect not only America but many other countries that were involved in the war as well.\n\nThe Great Depression Essay\n\n1558 Words | 4 Pages\n\nPrior to the Great Depression the United States was flourishing with technology and consumer spending. The Roaring Twenties brought much cheer and prosperity to the economy. The invention of the automobile, radio and motion picture brought higher wages and more jobs. When families wanted to forget about their troubles for a little while, they would usually go see a movie. Some films were The Wizard of Oz, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and Gone with the Wind. Music was also an entertaining way to distract you from everyday life problems. Women were dressing differently and trying to gain a better place for themselves in the work force. Their views and mannerism were also changing.\n\nThe Great Depression in \"Cinderella Man\"\n\n1586 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThe Great Depression is seen as one of the most sorrowful and desolate times in the history of the United States. This time was the longest period of recession ever seen by this nation so far. It lasted from 1929 to 1939, over ten years of complete confusion and despondency within the people. Many Americans were affected greatly by this tragic time and sacrificed much of their lives so that they and their families may have the chance to live. This act of desperation can be seen throughout the movie, The Cinderella Man, where a professional boxer, Jim Braddock, becomes crippled by the depression, both economically and spiritually. The observer can see this through the explicit cinematography of the movie and depiction of the Great Depression made by the director. However the director left out a key aspect of the happenings of the depression, the stock market crash. Perhaps, this catastrophic event was irrelevant to the plot and message of the movie, but it is important to the actual Great Depression of the United States. Furthermore, the nation of 2010 is well on its way to repeating history. There are frightening similarities between that dreadful time of the 1930’s and the present that should not be overlooked, or the United States might condemn itself back into that horrific state it has so long tried to avoid.\n\nThe Great Depression Essay\n\n1508 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThe Great Depression was the deepest and longest-lasting economic downfall in the history of the United Sates. No event has yet to rival The Great Depression to the present day today although we have had recessions in the past, and some economic panics, fears. Thankfully the United States of America has had its shares of experiences from the foundation of this country and throughout its growth many economic crises have occurred. In the United States, the Great Depression began soon after the stock market crash of October 1929, which sent Wall Street into a panic and wiped out millions of investors (\"The Great Depression.\"). In turn from this single tragic event, numerous amounts of chain reactions occurred."
