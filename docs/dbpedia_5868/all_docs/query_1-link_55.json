        "text": "TULSA — One of the horses that portrayed Seabiscuit in the movie of that name has been rescued and given a second chance.\n\nAnd now that plain racehorse will join the equine therapy program at Tulsa Boys' Home to help give boys a second chance.\n\nThe movie tells the true story of three men who take a small, slightly lame racehorse named Seabiscuit to victory in a legendary race against the stellar racehorse War Admiral. The large and small victories in the late 1930s served to inspire the Depression-weary nation in need of an underdog hero.\n\nThe gelding that played major scenes in the movie took a circuitous track from anonymity to stardom and then to the verge of death.\n\nBut like all good horse stories, this one circled around to a happy ending.\n\nAlong with being used in the home's therapeutic equine program, in which the troubled boys learn to care for others, he will eventually be ridden by the more advanced students.\n\nThe boys were treated Monday to a showing of the 2003 movie. Then they were told that the equine star they had just watched would arrive in a different kind of winner's circle Monday afternoon, when he went to live at the boys' home.\n\n“This young, throwaway horse rises to become a super hero who galvanized a nation with hope,” said Gregg Conway, Boys' Home executive director. “That's really what our work is all about. We help them heal and provide them with a sense of hope.\n\n“That's what Seabiscuit did for a nation.”\n\nBut the 16-year-old horse that portrayed Seabiscuit almost missed the chance to do for the boys what the original Seabiscuit did for the nation.\n\nFinding Seabiscuit\n\nBefore filming, moviemakers traveled around race tracks looking for ordinary horses like the ordinary horse that made people believe they could overcome adversity, whether on the track or on Main Street.\n\nThey searched small race tracks for 15 smallish bay thoroughbreds — no bigger than 15.2 hands or 62 inches — with a reddish brown coat and black mane, tail and legs. They needed many backups with different personalities and abilities so the best horse could be used for each scene. A horse that would rear up and show the fractious side of Seabiscuit early on wouldn't necessarily play the lame Seabiscuit or the horse that affectionately nuzzled his jockey in the movie.\n\nLike 10 other selected horses, Oklahoma's little Seabiscuit was perfectly unassuming and spectacularly plain.\n\n“He's just a little 15.2 hand brown horse. He's a bay. Plain. Not a white hair on him,” said Leslie Hubbell, an Oklahoma volunteer with Exceller Fund, a thoroughbred racehorse rescue and retraining group based in Lexington, Ken., that maintains ownership of the horse, whose real name is Rich in Dallas.\n\nThe Arkansas-bred horse portrayed Seabiscuit in several scenes where the thoroughbred roared around turns on the track and near the end of the film where the blind-in-one-eye, too-big jockey victoriously gallops the underrated, too-small horse through the woods and over a bridge.\n\nThe jockey Red Pollard, played by Tobey Maguire, narrates: “You know, everyone thinks that we found this broken down horse and fixed him. But we didn't. He fixed us, every one of us. And I guess in a way we kind of fixed each other, too.”\n\nForgotten fame\n\nThe horse starred in the strongest scenes. But when the movie ended, Rich in Dallas became Nobody in California. The horse's real-life story twisted back to anonymity on another little racetrack. This is where Rich in Dallas almost missed another chance at life, and the chance to help the Oklahoma boys.\n\nFame forgotten, he was once again entered in a claiming race at the Los Alamitos track. But one sharp-eyed, anonymous race fan knew about the little horse's stardom. The former movie star came in second; the buyer picked him up for $2,500 in March 2004 and gave him to the Exceller Fund. The nonprofit fund, established in 1997 following the news that champion racehorse Exceller was killed in a slaughter house, works with groups such as ReRun and Old Friends that provide care and handling of off-the-track horses and other horses that might otherwise face slaughter.\n\nExceller turned the horse over to caretakers Paul and Kelly Linn, who promoted the racehorse ambassador for several years at horse shows and hospitals across the country. After allowing Tulsa Boys' Home to care for a couple of other horses, Exceller Fund volunteers suggested the home might be a perfect place for the next turn of the Seabiscuit portrayer's life. The Linns agreed.\n\nHubbell called Conway on New Year's Day.\n\n“Would you like to have the Seabiscuit horse as one of your horses?” she asked.\n\n“Are you kidding me? When can we get him?” Conway said.\n\nWith that, Rich in Dallas took the next turn in the track.\n\nAs the trainer in the movie said:\n\n“Every horse is good for something. You don't throw a whole life away just because it's banged up a little.”"
