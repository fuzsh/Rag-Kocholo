        "text": "During times of need, one seeks comfort from the world around them as it rages on inside and out, corrupting everything in sight. War expressed in both the books, The Great Gatsby and Seabiscuit are similar in that they offer two different insights of fighting physical and mental wars; manifesting internally, in their settings, and on the people around them. War takes many shapes and is dealt in more than one way. How you deal with it, is what matters.\n\nThe settings within the books is solely influenced by how the war has affected the people. For example, the book Seabiscuit written by Laura Hillenbrand, centers around the great depression. Inviting the people who have came in contact with this war to want a distraction from it. Seabiscuit is that distraction. This horse becomes part of everybody in a way to bring hope that even in the toughest times war can be overcomed.Pollard states “You know, everybody thinks we found this broken-down horse and fixed him. But we didn't. He fixed us; every one of us. And I guess in a way, we kinda fixed each other too”. Hence, the interaction with the setting displayed a sense of hope around every corner while looking to the future. In contrast, The Great Gatsby written by F.Scott Fitzgerald, incorporates war into the setting with conflict against love. Jordan states,\"Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.\" (63). Gatsby is so engulfed about getting Daisy back after the war, he is blind to the war he will start. This affects the setting by centering around what extent will Gatsby go to to “please” Daisy. Both books display a difference on how a war has affected the setting in both a positive and negative way. Yet, war also can also be internal, eating away at the characters.\n\nEmotions can be a war all by itself, when mixed in oneself it can be a “deadly disease” and could lead to life changing decisions. For example, in Seabiscuit Red pollard had this “disease”, as shown in chapter twenty two. During his recovery, Pollard was having trouble accepting he may never ride again, instead he waged a war inside himself battling this “impossible” outcome. Dimintrasting his passion to get up and keep on going even when people and even the odds tell him no."
