        "text": "The Braddock family faced economic hardships during the great depression. In the Cinderella Man movie, the man cut off the power because they weren’t paying the electric bills. Another scene was when they were eating baloneys to survive and Mr. Braddock hands the little girl his baloney. This depicted their economic hardships and inability to buy sufficient food for the family. The reason for the economic hardship was clear. During his conversation in the bar after working on the docks, Mr. Braddock tells his friend that he even invested his money on a taxi.\n\nCinderella Man came out in the year 2005, it is a non fiction movie directed by Ron Howard. It is based on the story of a boxer during the Depression, James J. Braddock. Braddock had to over come many adversities such as the economical and societal conditions. Another adversity he had to overcome was living in the Depression and all the things that go along with that. Braddock’s character traits shown in the movie are all important and appropriate due to the harshness of those times.\n\nThe depression was a burdensome time for everyone, yet some people rose to the challenge and gave hope to their struggling country. Some of these individuals were Red Pollard and his horse, Seabiscuit, who went on to fame because of their success while racing, along with James J. Braddock, the famous boxer. The films Seabiscuit and The Cinderella Man were made to share their achievements and give hope to others who are struggling. These two films consist of many similarities and differences that can be depicted throughout the story. Seabiscuit and The Cinderella Man both take place during the Great Depression, a time where everyone was desperate for the smallest bit of cash.\n\nThe movie Cinderella Man was about life in the Great Depression from a boxer's point of view. The focus of the movie was on the protagonist, James Braddock; a father who had to accept jobs on the docks and become a boxer again so he could earn money to buy food and pay the bills. The movie highlighted the conditions for the homeless, the trough in the economy, and the struggle to support a family. The movie was successful in being a true and accurate representation of the Great Depression.\n\nThe Great Depression is seen as one of the most sorrowful and desolate times in the history of the United States. This time was the longest period of recession ever seen by this nation so far. It lasted from 1929 to 1939, over ten years of complete confusion and despondency within the people. Many Americans were affected greatly by this tragic time and sacrificed much of their lives so that they and their families may have the chance to live. This act of desperation can be seen throughout the movie, The Cinderella Man, where a professional boxer, Jim Braddock, becomes crippled by the depression, both economically and spiritually. The observer can see this through the explicit cinematography of the movie and depiction of the Great\n\nDuring the great depression, everyone had lost everything that they owned, this is represented by the movie, “Cinderella Man”. James Braddock was fighter that much like everyone else had lost everything they owned in the depression. He was down on his luck and happen been winning many fights in the past until he got something better than the motivation to get a title, his family was his new found motive to fight. Braddock was a true symbol of the time period that he was fighting in because every American was trying to fight their way back to where they had previously been and get out of the pit they were in. There were a few historical inaccuracies and many historical accuracies that were added to give general effect. “Cinderella Man” was an\n\nThe Roaring Twenties were a very important time in America’s history. I chose this topic to discuss because I think it brought about many great changes, especially for women. Women were finally able to break away from tradition. They wore shorter dresses, cut their hair short, and expressed themselves more. Some women also enjoyed dancing and became flappers. This is one of the first times women have been able to do things like this, which I think is extremely important. The only downfall of the 1920’s was prohibition, which outlawed alcohol. I’m not really sure why they outlawed it during this time period. This was supposed to be the era of fun and prosperity, and many people drink for fun. However, this did not stop people from drinking,\n\nCinderella Man is a famous, nonfiction film that was directed by Ron Howard and produced in 2005. The timing of the production of this film can strike as interesting, and maybe even odd; this is because the film begins in the times of the roaring 20’s, when the United States experienced a peak in economic successes. However, the 20’s is not the only developed time period, rather, it is the 30’s that most of the action in the film protagonists’ story will take place. Jim Braddock, a well known, wealthy, married man takes the lead position to show audiences the first-hand impact that the Great Depression had on families of all backgrounds. Braddock's riches-to-rags-to-riches story has inspired the value behind family and hard work and brought hope to his neighbors and fans who found themselves also struggling to find work and pay their bills during one of the greatest the economic downturns in history.\n\nCinderella Man is a flim based on the rise of World Championship boxer James Braddock. Braddock's life was affected heavily by the great depression, and the film does well to show this. The film also does a good job of chronicling the life of the everyday man during the great depression. This essay aims to discuss the role of the stock market crash in the beginning of the great depression, the effects of the depression on the life of the everyday man, and the effects of the depression on the life of James J Braddock and his family.\n\nThe movie Cinderella Man is a biographical film of boxer James J. Braddock that illustrates his struggle through the Great Depression. Movies often exaggerate the suffering of the Great Depression or just gloss over it, but Cinderella Man accurately shows the prevailing attitude of the time through the facial expressions of the actors and the obstacles they overcome. In the film, the people on the street and in the crowd in the boxing arenas appear worried and never smile. The only time that people appear happy is while watching the excitement of a boxing match. This shows how important sporting events like boxing were to a public which had very little to cheer about. In a time when few people had television sets in their houses, listening to a boxing match on the radio let people imagine the fights through their own interpretations in their heads. The movie correctly shows how boxing was a temporary shelter from the suffering for many.\n\nThis movie took place September 25. 1933 which was four years into the Great Depression. The first impression I got was he was a happy man, was rich and made enough money from wrestling, I was wrong. His family included a wife, a daughter, and two sons. They lived in a run down apartment and didn't have enough money to pay for bills and there milk payment was past due. The daughter, Ariel woke up one morning and wanted breakfast she ate and was still hungry the father convinced her he was full and gave her his breakfast. I could tell by the time this movie is based on because of the music, there clothing, and the style of the town. The father, Jim was trying to get a job and there was many men at the fence trying to\n\nThe story of Cinderella is well-known by most people, however, there are several versions of this beloved tale. There is the one told by the Grimm Brothers, depicting a world where moral choices can affect your life in extreme ways, but it is Walt Disney’s 1950 cartoon version of Cinderella that most children think of when the story is mentioned. This version leaves behind both the question of morality and the bloody punishments, allowing children to enjoy an eye-catching, G-rated film. Both of these versions use their respective mediums to emphasize what the creator deems to be most important: a lesson about piety and goodness in the Grimm tale and the entertainment factor in the Disney cartoon. These are each shown in different ways, according to the medium used.\n\nHave you ever had a dark and gloomy day? Imagine having that feeling every single day. The Grimm’s Cinderella was written in 1812. 1812 was one of the harshest years for America. An event that formed it was the war against Great Britain and the United States. Not only was there a war, but there was also a series of disastrous harvests. Taxes got higher, and more than twenty people who were involved with a Luddite Act were hung. In 1812, there was also the only assassination of a prime minister, who was shot dead in the House of Commons. The Grimm Brothers have put the dark times of 1812 into their stories. Some of their stories contain violence, child abuse, and wicked mothers. They came up with these types of stories after their father died, and when they struggled out of school. That gave them enough time to research and put together a collection of folk tales. Now you can see why the Grimm’s Cinderella was dark and gloomy. Although the plot stayed the same, over the years, the story did get lighter. Disney’s Cinderella came out in 1950. In 1950, learning information was not by fear, but by engaging happiness. Disney’s Cinderella transforms the Grimm’s Cinderella into a happier atmosphere. While some similarities between Disney’s Cinderella and Grimm’s Cinderella are noticeable, the differences are pronounced, especially when referring to the slippers, her father, and the ball."
