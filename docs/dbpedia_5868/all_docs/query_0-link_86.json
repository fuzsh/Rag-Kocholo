This true story, set in the Depression-era, about a small horse named Seabiscuit is so emotional you might almost not believe it.\n\nSeabiscuit‘s repeated victories lifted the nation’s spirits during a rough time, and men and women from all around the country found solace in watching this mighty and stubborn horse race, win, and overcome all of those who doubted that he could ever win.\n\nI went the literal route with these biscuits, which actually ended up not being so obvious. These Seabiscuits are seaweed biscuits, with subtle flakes of dulse mixed into the dough (along with onion, garlic, and cheddar). The dulse gives these savory biscuits added depth, but never in an overpowering way.\n\nThese are truly the savory biscuits of my dreams. The buttered moist inner layers remain pillowy while the tops and bottoms bake to a delicious golden. They take a bit of time to bake, but having patience pays off. I mean it when I say that just like Seabiscuit, these biscuits are small but mighty."
