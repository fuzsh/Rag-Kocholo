        "text": "The 95th Academy Awards will air on ABC at 8 p.m. on Sunday night, and we're just as excited as you to see which of this year's best movies will take home an Oscar.\n\nMillions of people tune in to the show every year to see which movies and actors are dubbed the best of the best, several of which have had Kentucky connections. From Jennifer Lawrence to 1980s film \"Rain Man,\" here's a quick look at just a few of the notable industry giants that were a product of the commonwealth.\n\n\"The Shape of Water\" (2017)\n\n\"Shape of Water\" features Kentucky actors Michael Shannon and Jack Fox and won four Oscars in 2018. Vying for the win in 13 different categories, the film became the most nominated film of the night. Shape of Water is the story of Elisa Esposito, a voiceless woman working in a government facility. She finds discovers a classified secret: an amphibious creature from South America whose fate belongs in the hands of a government agent and marine biologist.\n\n\"Seabiscuit\" (2003)\n\n\"Seabiscuit,\" a 2003 film based on the book by Laura Hillenbrand, includes scenes shot in Lexington and Paris, Kentucky. The movie follows Seabiscuit, an underdog race horse, who struggles to win in the beginning but eventually captures the attention of the nation as he rises through the ranks, uplifting Americans' spirits during the Great Depression. An honorable mention goes to the movie \"Secretariat,\" another horse racing movie also filmed in Kentucky.\n\nMore:Heine Brothers Union moves to ratify its first contract with company\n\n\"Rain Man\" (1988)\n\nRain Man, \"shot in parts of Kentucky,\" won four of the eight nominations it received in 1988 and is credited for an influx of movies that would be filmed in Kentucky and Cincinnati over the next several years. Charlie Sanford, played by Tom Cruise, is a Los Angeles car dealer who learns his father died and is angered by the inheritance terms. Sanford kidnaps his brother, played by Dustin Hoffman, who received $3 million in the deal, and grows to overcome his resentment toward the situation.\n\n\"Coal Miner's Daughter\" (1980)\n\n\"Coal Miner's Daughter\" is a 1980 biographical film about the life of country music star Loretta Lynn. Sissy Spacek won an Oscar for \"Best Actress in a Leading Role\" in her portrayal of Lynn, from Butcher Holler in Van Lear, Kentucky. Lynn gets married at 13 and starts singing after her husband, Doolittle Lynn, buys a guitar as a gift for the couple's anniversary. Doolittle makes her audition at Grange Hall, and the story follows Lynn's rise to fame until a collapse and recovery, leading to a performance of the titular song to end the movie. It was nominated for six other awards but didn't make the cut.\n\nFor even more movies featuring Kentucky front and center, check out this list from Kentucky for Kentucky, a small Lexington-based company.\n\nWhich Oscar winners have connections to Kentucky?\n\nCan Catholics eat meaton St. Patrick's Day this year?
