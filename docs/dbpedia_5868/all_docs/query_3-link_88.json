        "text": "In the past three decades, due to the work of some distinguished historians, the discussion of film is being slowly integrated into Western historiography. However, while relatively few academic historians would deny today film’s ability to instigate awareness to and enrich the understanding of historical experiences, many fewer are willing – and able – to incorporate film analysis in their own research and teaching. This impasse is particularly apparent in the case of “historical films,” in which past events and experiences are reconstructed, invented and framed in varying degrees of sophistication. The convincing arguments that established film as a “legitimate” narrator of historical reality often fell short of explicating how film should be integrated into academic history discourse. This article reads Rosenstone and Parvulescu’s recent collection of essays A Companion to Historical Film as a demonstration of different approaches taken by contemporary historians in an attempt to meet this challenge. Within this context, it identifies four paradigms, each involves different premises about the nature of film’s realism, its role as an agent of social change, and its dialog with “conventional” (national, institutional, etc.) narration of the past. The analysis of these paradigms – and the ways they have been implemented by the contributors to A Companion to Historical Film – shows their potential contribution to the study of historical realities, as well as their weaknesses and limitations. Insightfully presenting and discussing these approaches, I argue, Rosenstone and Parvulescu’s volume is an important step forward in the ongoing endeavor to methodologically incorporate film analysis in the academic research of history.\n\nCourse Description: Memory, history and time work through the cinematic narrative in ways that make the medium significantly different from all the other art forms. Film in a variety of ways lends itself to the possibility of organizing not just historical knowledge but also comments on the nature of historical narration. As an archive of sensations, of emotions, of images and of sounds, film works as a powerful recorder of life and its events, and as a form of witnessing and testimony. Ideas of the past as they permeate the present through cinema will be analyzed in this course by looking at the different ways in which films make connections between history and evidence, between history and the present, between historical narration and the historical event, and between memory and representation. If the history of cinema is a history of the 20th century, it contains within its archive a history of modern subjectivity (Geoffrey Nowell-Smith). Moving through popular genres, documentaries, art cinema and avant-garde film practice, the course will explore the intricate relationship between film and history as it unfolds in the terrain of World Cinema.\n\nThis article consists of an extended review of Robert Rosenstone's book, History on Film/Film on History (Pearson, 2006). The review evaluates three key contributions: first, the description of the development of a field of study dedicated to examining the relationship between film and history; second, Rosenstone's demand that history on film be judged not in relation to written history but as a valid and productive form of representation in its own right; and, third, the book's presentation of a taxonomy of the history film.\n\nThe purpose of this essay, written from the viewpoint of a moderately supportive viewer of 'history on film', is to explore and assess what it is about the topic that provokes such expressions of hostility and defensive enthusiasm. The strengths of film, in an historical context, are examined within the broad category of public consumption and impact. Weaknesses are considered under the headings of firstly: accuracy, authenticity and invention and secondly: interpretation. While the essay concentrates on historically-themed feature films (using Titanic and Zulu as examples) since these provoke the most discussion, the theoretical ‘reality’ genre of newsreels, propaganda films and documentaries is also evaluated."
