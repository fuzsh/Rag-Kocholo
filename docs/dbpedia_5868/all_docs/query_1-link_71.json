        "text": "\"Seabiscuit” is a triumph-of-the-equine-spirit movie. The legendary horse of the nineteen-thirties—small, knobby-kneed, and often torpid, with an irregular gait and an uncertain temper—is all heart: he wins every race by overtaking the field just before the finish line. Intelligent but perverse, he has to want to win in order to do so, and, when he does, he makes the humans who care about him overcome their own difficulties, too. At least, that’s the way Laura Hillenbrand told the story in her vigorously written account from 2001 of the amazing animal that became a national obsession. Allowing for some condensation and a few invented episodes, the movie “Seabiscuit” follows Hillenbrand’s scheme closely enough. Written and directed by Gary Ross (“Pleasantville”), the picture is effective and satisfying—both realistic and poetic, and always vivid emotionally. Yet there’s an element of Oscar-grabbing opportunism and bullying in “Seabiscuit.” The movie is shaped as a national epic—not as a good story but as the good story, the story of you and me. Upbeat and redemptive, “Seabiscuit” at times seems no more than a galloping variant of “A Beautiful Mind” and “Forrest Gump” and “Chariots of Fire” and “Rocky” and the many other half-good, half-embarrassing melodramas about losers overcoming adversity. When a director exploits our hardwired responses to pathos, he fails, so to speak, a test of honor. For all his skill and tact, Gary Ross often fails in that way.\n\nThe movie begins oddly, with photographs of early-twentieth-century automobile factories, and a familiar voice narrating. Puzzled, we wait for the gratuitous introduction to be over. Eventually, Ross, who has learned a lot about pacing and momentum since the soporific “Pleasantville,” gets the story going by separately establishing the lives of the three principal human characters and then weaving them together. He begins with a quick tour through the early career of Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), an Easterner who went West, sewed up the Buick franchise in Northern California, and became a wealthy man. As Howard, Jeff Bridges has a big, broad smile, a hearty manner, and a gleaming intelligence disguised by the heartiness; his performance is a more complex and melancholy version of the grinning, upbeat businessman he played fifteen years ago in “Tucker: The Man and His Dream.” Bridges never says anything remarkable, yet he convinces us that Howard is a wonderful entrepreneur-sportsman—a generous risk-taker with superb judgment. Howard loses a son in an automobile accident (not, as the movie tells it, his only son but one of four), becomes interested in Thoroughbreds as a kind of solace, and hires Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), a hardscrabble type who knows everything about horses, to be his trainer. The two have a folkloric meeting by a campfire, each sizing the other up with profound glances and a minimum of small talk. The meeting is so exquisitely polite it borders on unintentional comedy. Yet I was impressed with Ross’s bold delicacy, the conservative-humanist approach to directing that evokes John Ford’s strong-and-silent mythmaking manner. And, in Chris Cooper, Ross has an actor with genuine mythic qualities. Cooper turns Tom Smith into one of those unnerving people who say exactly what they want to say and nothing more. He creates interest by his insistent wariness, his mouth slightly open as if to receive the vibrations in the air, his head turning and nodding gently, the way a horse tastes the wind.\n\nThe final member of the triumvirate is the jockey Johnny (Red) Pollard (Tobey Maguire), a bitter young man abandoned by a prosperous family that has fallen on hard times. Pollard is a lousy boxer and a so-so jockey, but he has the same streak of ornery independence as Seabiscuit, and Tom Smith, watching the horse bucking at one end of a stable yard and Pollard brawling at the other, has an intuition that the two might suit each other. A calculating young actor, Maguire draws attention to himself by slowing down the pace; he holds the camera with his big eyes, his slightly goofy smile, and his scratchy voice confidingly lowered to the microphone’s intimate ear. Maguire is the Seabiscuit of movie stars—he seems to lack the physical equipment for the job, but don’t make the mistake of underestimating him. His Red Pollard is a tough, strong performance. The adolescent softness has gone out of Maguire; he makes Pollard a tense, willful spark plug eager to take punishment, a man of limited talent determined to prevail.\n\nRoss brings the story together with a series of silent but momentous recognition scenes. Even the horse has one, stopping in its tracks and eying Smith at length. Those moments in which men (or horses) look at someone and just know are popular tropes in Hollywood, where every producer’s vanity is feathered by the assurance that he can judge talent on the spot. The recognition scenes are part of the movie’s legendary American tone—aided by the imitation-Copland music, by Randy Newman, and the softly lyrical views of wide-open spaces and the beautiful shots of a horse grazing under a tree or being drawn slowly through a yard by a disconsolate boy in a cap. Ross is better at pastoral enchantment than Robert Redford was in his limp, roaming-in-the-gloaming movies, “The Horse Whisperer” and “The Legend of Bagger Vance.” Convinced that Seabiscuit was ruined by his earlier training, Smith, in the most thrilling moment of the film, says that he “just needs to learn how to be a horse again,” and Pollard mounts up and takes off, racing with increasing exhilaration through the woods. The movie has scale, energy, and a persuasive sense of physical detail. The actual races, re-created from famous events at Pimlico, Belmont, Hollywood Park, and other tracks, are often shocking. Ross plunges us right into the shoulder-bashing melee—the nasty interplay among beasts and jockeys at super-high speed. A total of ten horses play Seabiscuit, and they all looked fierce to me.\n\nIf Ross had merely told his story and re-created the media folk culture of the thirties, the movie might have been a classic. The invented character Tick-Tock McGlaughlin (William H. Macy), a voluble, poeticizing radio announcer who specializes in constant excitement and stale metaphors, offers a blazing bit of comic atmosphere. But the documentary stuff seen at the beginning returns again and again. There are solemn crypts of photomontage, in which pictures of men and women in the Depression, gaunt-faced and desperate, are accompanied by the familiar voice, which is, of course, that of the historian David McCullough, who narrated Ken Burns’s documentaries about the Civil War and baseball. He tells us that Seabiscuit, like the unemployed, was cast aside and forgotten, but the horse fought back, and eventually he, along with the New Deal, rallied the nation. Somehow he became the nation, lifting itself out of the Depression. McCullough’s narration—liberal and humane, witty but not sarcastic, knowing but not clever—is an ideal voice for a documentary, but it’s wrong for a narrative film. It argues for the rightness, the sanity of its own intelligently rueful point of view—it’s like a seal of approval. Why wasn’t Ross content to just let the movie make the point? We can see for ourselves that thousands of destitute people adore the come-from-behind animal. The overexplicitness is a form of special pleading—Ross borrows the high authority of PBS rather than achieving something better through dramatic representation.\n\nThe hard sell also forces phony meanings onto the material. After all, Seabiscuit was not some prole nag. His sire was Hardtack and his grandfather was Man o’ War, both great racehorses. He’s as highborn as Franklin D. Roosevelt, who also overcame a handicap to become a winner, and who would have made a more appropriately analogous figure to Seabiscuit than the down and out. Howard and Smith liberated the fighting spirit of a warrior-aristocrat; that’s how they turned Seabiscuit into a champion. Despite all the talk in the movie about handicaps and lost men, the horse and his three handlers are redeemed by overwhelming popular success. And the movie tries to sweep itself aboard that onrushing victory train. At its worst, the triumphalism of “Seabiscuit” is not far from the shiny American glow emanating from an official Presidential-campaign film. This is a superbly crafted piece of salesmanship—a celebration of idiosyncrasy that turns out to be one of the squarest movies ever made. ♦"
