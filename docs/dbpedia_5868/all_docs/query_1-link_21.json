Another quote which speaks to Braddock overcoming adversary explains how he doesn’t take this opportunity for granted. “You think you're telling me something? Like, what, boxing is dangerous, something like that? You don't think working triple shifts and at night on a scaffold isn't just as likely to get a man killed? What about all those guys who died last week living in cardboard shacks to save on rent money just to feed their family, 'cause guys like you have not quite figured out a way yet to make money off of watching that guy die?

Some are big, some have mountains, some have dictators, some are as old as time. One thing that remains constant is the cultural pride and need for national identity in each. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, pride is the “delight or elation arising from some act, possession, or relationship.” Therefore, it can be inferred that cultural pride is the love, appreciation, and elation for where a person comes from and the practices of that culture. For example, Americans take pride in everything that has been invented and accomplished in America. Hispanics take pride in the traditions of their ancestors like “Day of the Dead.” The Scottish take pride in their heritage, and they traditions and didn’t appreciate England taking over their land and forcing them to change their way of living in the 1290’s. National identity is important because it is what makes countries unique from one another. If humans didn’t have their own personalities, every person would be the same, despite their different body shapes and features. Likewise, if countries didn’t have their own identity, what would make them different? The film Braveheart showed the strive Scotland had to form their own national identity. However, films that are fictionalized have many effects. Fictionalized films focusing on national identity can act as a demagoguery and cause political movements. Even though the film Braveheart provides a good example of cultural pride and the strive for national identity, it does not accurately portray the Scottish rebellion of England; moreover, many historical films don’t accurately portray historical events.\n\nForrest Gump Analysis\n\n520 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThe story of Forrest Gump is one for the ages.
