        "text": "When the economy is bad, and layoffs are happening, individuals often don't have the resources to pay for a resume writer or a coach's help. I'm lucky to have a full-time job, so I can do more pro bono work than those who do this full-time. But regardless, there are still costs associated with running my business like software, tools, and continuing education to stay on top of my industry and develop my skills and network to assist my clients. When you connect with me, whether a paid client or not, I always give my best to try and assist in any way possible to help you get back to work and fulfill your potential. If you've ever found the resources I share, my advice, or my coaching helpful, I'd love for you to consider contributing to my Buy Me a Coffee page. It helps me keep the lights on and gives me the ability to reach more folks who really need help in their job searches right now. #careercoach #jobseekers #resumes #coaching #layoffs\n\nJugaaḍ (or jugaaṛ) is a non-conventional, frugal innovation. It also includes innovative fixes or a simple workarounds, solutions that bend the rules, or resources that can be used in such a way. It is considered creative to make existing things work and create new things with meager resources. “Jugaad\" approach does not only provide an instant quick fix for a problem but also builds up the observational skills and makes the designers understand the importance of spontaneity, availability of tools and the existing infrastructure or the elements around them. Ever done any Jugaad in your work?

But not everyone will do that for fear of looking like they hadn't paid attention in that training class from last year or possibly they fear loosing their job for not knowing. Better yet, they ask a coworker for the answer and they don't know either. They've just been doing it their way and haven't been corrected, caught or disciplined yet. You see, they hadn't paid attention in that training class last year either and so the cycle continues. It goes without being said that this is a problem that can get out of control rather rapidly without anyone knowing, until its too late.

DM For Credit/Removal.\n\nIt's heart breaking to see thousands and thousands getting laid off, not even stopping during christmas and continuing well into the new year. I am also navigating the job search and see the avalanche of applicants per job. I don't know if it's going to get better anytime soon. I know that hoping can't change the fact there aren't enough jobs with reasonable pay and expectations. I also know that the negative self talk and internal rotting won't make the situation better either. Things may not get better tomorrow or next month, but in the meantime remember there is no virtue in suffering. If you can, if you can muster the motivation, try to push back against that self hate. You deserve better. You do. If you want to help me, I'm open to freelance, part-time, and full-time roles. If you want to help others, always repost for reach. Everyone needs the help, even if its a small bit of effort. #mentalhealthmatters #mentalhealth #impostersyndrome #selfdoubt #layoffs2024 #layoffs"
