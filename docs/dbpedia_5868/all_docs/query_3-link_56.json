        "text": "🕺 \"Boogying on a Budget: Disco Bathrooms & Doing the Branding Hustle\" 💃 For small businesses struggling with branding on a budget, I have two words for you: Disco Bathrooms. That’s right. HOP Shops Convenience Stores, a Kentucky-based chain has gone viral with their marketing thanks to some hustle and creativity. Their six locations each features a disco bathroom —complete with mirror balls, boogie music (“Party in the USA” anyone?), and a “don’t push this button” sign that of course everyone pushes. The result? National media coverage, late-night TV mentions, and even a bathroom wedding! The lesson? You don’t need a massive budget to make a memorable impact. By thinking outside the box (or bathroom), you can turn even the most mundane spaces into a brand experience that resonates with customers and makes your business stand out. Here are some other fun examples of c-stores rocking their branding without breaking the bank: Babir Sultan with Fav Trip has a selfie wall in his stores, creating instagrammable moments “Let your customers be your influencers,” he said on Convenience Matters podcast recently. 🤳 Host a local restaurant with crave-worthy food like my two personal faves, NFA Burger 🍔 in Dunwoody, GA and Che Butter Jonez in Atlanta (both inside a Chevron station). Pull Over Now! Offer an affordable attraction, like the Shell Station in Cross Plains, TN that features a giant pink fiberglass elephant carrying a martini glass 🍸 (see pic in comments) 🐘 At Your Service! Provide a useful service, like the Gator Stop in Eufala, AL that offers fishing licenses (and also boasts a swamp filled with gators next door) 🐊 Beer Cave: Become the go-to place for a special snack or beverage, like Swett’s Tire & Auto in Bangor, Maine, that is featured on beer websites for carrying an amazing selection of craft brews – they even host beer tasting events! 🍻 So, what small, bold move can you do to make your branding flush 🚽 with creativity (see what I did there)? Please share your fun ideas in the comments, especially recommendations for c-stores I should visit on my travels. And check out my video of the HOP Shop - I had the time of my life there 😉 #Branding #Marketing #SmallBusiness #Innovation #CustomerExperience Jeff Lenard NACS Josh Emmick Valor Oil\n\n🍑 Peaches, Pecans, & Partnerships: 3 Lessons for Growing Your Brand! 🍑 Happy National Peach Day! 🍑 Here in Georgia, where peaches reign supreme, we at Stuckey's are also proud to celebrate another Southern staple: the pecan. We had the pleasure of teaming up with Chef Guy Anderson from Big Green Egg to create a mouthwatering grilled peach salad topped with our signature Stuckey's kettle-glazed pecans last August at a #GeorgiaGrown event hosted by Regina Maddox & NextGen Manufacturing. It was a delicious reminder of the power of partnerships! Collaborations like these don’t just result in tasty treats—they also help brands like ours grow and thrive. Here are three ways you can nurture your brand by teaming up with like-minded companies: 1. Mix It Up! – Just like peaches and pecans, sometimes the best partnerships come from combining two unexpected flavors. Look for collaborators who bring something different to the table, and together, you’ll create something truly unique. 2. Shared Values, Shared Success – Partner with brands that align with your values and mission. When you’re on the same page, the collaboration feels natural, and customers can sense the authenticity. 3. Double the Fun, Double the Reach – Collaborating allows you to tap into each other’s audiences. It’s a win-win that can double your reach and introduce your brand to new fans! So next time you’re looking to shake things up, consider a partnership. Who knows? You might just cook up something amazing—just like our peach and pecan salad! 🥗#BrandBuildling #Collaborations"
