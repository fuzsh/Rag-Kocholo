        "text": "Films about historical events have enormous power to affect us, both to enlighten and to mislead. Historical films are perennially popular, often because they tell history through individual lives, because they invent characters and add personal, emotional drama to events that we want to learn about. Those same fictionalizing qualities make them great tools for teaching history. It has never been more urgent to train students to recognize how all stories — from those told by the most inventive narrator to the most professional historian — are told from particular points of view, shaped by the context of the storytellers’ lives.\n\nDuring the academic year 2019-2020, Not Even Past sponsored a history film series to accompany the U.S. History survey course. As part of this, we wanted to make titles available to teachers of U.S. history at any level or institution to use in their classrooms, supplementing lectures and other activities with films.\n\nPLEASE HELP US EXPAND OUR LIST OF FILMS by posting your films about U.S. History on social media and tagging Not Even Past.\n\nWhat’s included: This list includes general theatrical release feature films and feature-film length television films.\n\nWhat’s not included: Documentaries, TV series and individual TV episodes.\n\nJump to:\n\nMedieval North America, Colonial America, American Republic\n\nCivil War and Reconstruction\n\nSlavery\n\nExpansion and Westward Movement\n\nIndustrial Age (1871-1914)\n\nWWI-Depression\n\nWWII\n\nCold War\n\nCivil Rights, Segregation, and Jim Crow\n\n1960s-1970s\n\n1980s-Present\n\nMedieval North America, Colonial America, American Republic\n\n1776 (1972, Peter.
