        "text": "In “Shame on Miami for Ignoring West Grove,” Leonard Pitts argues that environmental racism is the cause of a social division between two parts of Coconut Grove. Pitts points out the eastern part of Coconut Grove to be the richest because of the festive celebrations and the vibrant people. Whereas, the western part of Coconut Grove is portrayed to be gloomy and unsafe; a place that is being neglected with lack of care and plagued by poor health related issues. In his efforts to bring this matter to the attention of his readers, the author uses a variety of rhetorical techniques. Pitts, is persuasive because of his style of involving pathos, his detailed logos, and his use of authority to provide first-hand experienced.\n\nThe term “hero” has many different interpretations for different individuals. In his speech “Heroes”, Tim O’Brien tells his audience how he views a hero and redefines the often dramatized term. He defines a hero as one who knows what a person needs and is willing to give that to them without question. O’Brien accomplishes sharing his argument of what a hero is through the use of appealing to Kairos, diction and syntax.\n\nHis physical features were the reason why he had to use more energy than the other horses when they were running, and that requires more food to replace his energy. Because of this he developed stronger leg muscles and of course his larger appetite. For whatever reason Seabiscuit was missing in physical nature, he more than made up for it with his stamina and willpower. Seabiscuit went to Sunny Jims ranch to train for races, but Sunny Jim did not like Seabiscuit. Once Seabiscuit was trained, Sunny Jim tried to get rid of him by entering him into claiming races, where thoroughbred horses are bought and sold. It is uncommon for a horse to be raced before 2 years old. Man of War, one of the greatest race horses in history, raced 21 times in his entire life. However, before Seabiscuit was 2 years old, he had raced 13\n\nIra C. Herbert, an executive of the Coca-Cola company, and Richard Seavers, a representative of Grove Press, are the speakers of their own respective letters and they both focus on the motto “It’s the real thing”. Herbert’s purpose is to convince Seavers to stop using the motto “It’s the real thing” and to use a different one and Seavers purpose is to address Herbert’s concerns about the motto and defends his company’s right to keep using the motto. Herbert adopts a friendly tone in order to point out what Seaver was doing, using the same slogan Coca-Cola uses. Seaver adopts a serious tone to guide Herbert what had happened to Herbert and the company of Coca-Cola. Herbert and Seaver use different rhetorical strategies in order to persuade\n\nIn 1944, the United States war effort in Europe was just starting to pick up. Even though the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor occurred just three years prior, the growing power of the Third Reich could not be ignored. During this time, France was already occupied by Nazi Germany and Hitler's war machine was on the path of conquering all of Eurasia. In an attempt to combat this immense threat, the U.S. formulated a plan to engage the German forces through an invasion of Normandy. This bloody offensive would be remembered in infamy as D-Day. Shortly before this violent clash of U.S. and German forces, the inexperienced men of the United States Third Army was given an encouraging and inspiring speech by the four star general George S. Patton.\n\nThe President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, presented his speech “What Is An American” while attending an I Am an American Day gathering in Central Park, New York City. At that time Germany completed multiple invasions throughout the European countries and was furiously attacking Britain. The American people were overall branched with the involvement of the U.S. in the war. One side believed in passivity, though others presumed even if Great Britain was conquered by Germany, the United States would remain in desolation. Harold’s Speech was directed to the Americans doubting involving the U.S. with the war against the Germans. His goal was to show that Americans are fighters and have always helped their\n\nSir Gawain and the Green Knight, the author’s rhetorical purpose is to persuade readers to be open to new experiences and to experiment with new things in different surroundings. A rhetorical pattern that was seen a lot though the story was alliteration. It is the occurrence of the same letter or sound at the beginning of adjacent. An example would be “So monstrous a mount, so mighty a man in the saddle.” This ties into the rhetorical purpose of “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight” by giving you the ability to make a picture in your head. Another rhetorical pattern that was seen a lot in the story was the use of color. This means to use colors to explain something in your writing. An example would be “Threads of gold interwoven with the glorious\n\nA leader has many responsibilities as a role model and caretaker for their people. Facing hard challenges and knowing how to deal with them is a part of being a great leader all of which are Chief Powhatan showed. Chief Powhatan whose proper name was Wahunsenacawh, was the superior chief of Tsenacommacah, an alliance of Algonquian-speaking Virginia Indians in the Tidewater region of Virginia at the time English settlers landed at Jamestown in 1607. In his address to Captain John Smith Chief Powhatan expresses how he desires peace between the settlers and the Tsenacommacah. He utilizes distinct rhetorical elements such as rhetorical questions, diction and argumentation to further support his view on what he desired to occur between his people and the English settlers.\n\nGuilt is a strong emotion that haunts us all, others hide it deep within themselves, some try to fix the wrong, and few people do good from it. The Kite Runner is the story of a boy named Amir, he struggles to find his place in the world, reason being of the all of the traumatic childhood events. He sends most of his time and life just sulking in guilt about the decisions he has made. Khaled Hosseini has given the idea that guilt can make you do good things, but all relies on what you're guilty about. The way this is portrayed is through the novel is through rhetorical strategies and imagery.\n\nThe Star Wars franchise has been a beloved series from Lucas Films since the first movie aired in 1977. Since then, the directors have composed a saga of movies that are dramatic and awe inspiring to the audience. In order to perceive what makes these films so popular to the audience, we must analyze the techniques used in one of the saga’s latest installments, Star Wars: Rogue One. This film was an installment meant to be set in the time period between Star Wars 3: The Return of the Sith, and Star Wars 4: A New Hope. The film pictures the events that happened in order to receive the plans for the Death Star, and interstellar spacecraft designed to be capable of destroying entire planets. (could\n\nThe science behind evaluating racehorses is deciding which faults make a direct impact to the horse’s career. The requirements needed for a horse to succeed starts at the conformation of the foal/yearling. To which conformational faults are passed down from parents, however, faults may or may not have consequences to their racing career, and therefore different trainers/bloodstock agents may have different inceptions with regard to acceptable faults (TOBA, 2015).\n\nPassion is a necessary trait all excellent speakers use to persuade their audiences. A passionate speaker uses pathos to sway his or her audience to the speaker’s side by playing with the audience’s emotions. Before pathos is used to move the audience emotionally, it is smart for the speaker to use ethos to build good credibility. With credibility, the speaker has the ability to make the audience trust him or her. That trust is beneficial to help the audience believe what the speaker is saying. Logos is another trait that a strong speaker must make use of to show intellect. It is the appeal to logic. Logic is needed to show the audience that the speaker knows his or her facts and can effectively back them up. Ethos, pathos, and logos are three vital aspects of a good speech. Elizabeth I uses all three appeals subtly throughout her speech, using pathos the most. The queen also uses rhetorical devices to emphasize her points. Through the use of amplification, asyndeton, and climax, Elizabeth I reassures and inspires her troops with her compelling speech.\n\nAlmost everyone in the world is familiar with the infamous Disney movie The Lion King, but very few have gone into detail and analyzed the rhetoric within the film. Each scene is filled with a sense of pathos that tugs on the emotions of the audience and inevitably pushes them to one side over the other. It is interesting to see how the voices, color, and actions of each character have such an effect on their personalities which then has an effect on the audience and leaves them judging the morals of the characters. For people who grew up watching the original Disney movies, this is a great film to watch in depth and really figure out the meaning behind each scene."
