Both forms of entertainment were similar and at the same time highlighted on different forms (change better wording).\n\nDonatelli in the novel, Gary Daniels is more than appropriate for the role; he is a retired professional kickboxer and hence he will be able to incorporate his own experiences as a fighter to further the film’s atmosphere and ideas of fighting one’s way to the top. Not only will he easily adapt to the novel’s plot for the fact that he is an experienced kickboxer, but also, he acquired experience from playing a team leader on the movie, Misfire. Such a trait (leadership) is a major part of Mr. Donatelli’s characterization and is imperative for a thorough representation of his well-versed, self-disciplined personality. (3) Whoopi Goldberg as Aunt Pearl: Aunt Pearl’s hardworking and wise personality cannot be played by any actor just as it cannot be taken lightly.\n\nI thought the acting in the movie was exceptional. The actor that played Nell did a very good job. She made the viewer’s believe that she really had her own language that no one else understood. Her body movements and responses were also very interesting. I also liked how Dr. Jerry made an effort to understand Nell instead of\n\nTaylor England playing the role of Lucia was very intriguing to watch. Her facial expressions alone made her a great actress for the role of Lucia in my opinion. Even when she was not the main focus of a scene, she continued to stay in character and the seriousness that came with a majority of the play. Taking acting for non majors has made me realize how much more difficult it is to not\n\nSince the beginning of civilization, many travelers left their homelands in order to explore new territories and cultures.

Tom tells the judge that Injun Joe was in there. The townspeople rush out to the cave and find Joe dead by the door.\n\nThe acting was generally composed and well remembered.The main characters Gomez, Morticia, Wednesday, Pugsley, Uncle Fester, Lurch, and Grandma Addams respectfully felt like a real family and communicated very well for the whole play. For example Erica Weisz as Morticia Addams whose performance stood out the most. She was the most exhilarating actor and I couldn’t wait to see more of here while each scene passed. My favorite scene with her was ‘The Game’ a dinner scene where they take turns sipping out of a cup that makes them say what they truly want in life. On the other hand Pugsley played by Brendan Knox forgot his lines and was acting quite over confident and obnoxious as if he was more\n\n“The Rocking-Horse Winner” is a tragic story written by D.H.
