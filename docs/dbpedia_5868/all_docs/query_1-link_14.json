        "text": "The 2003 film Seabiscuit, starring Tobey Maguire, Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper, tells the tale of three men, all damaged in different ways during the Great Depression who bond together while training an underdog horse that would captivate America, and rebuild all three men in the process.\n\nThe story is pretty split early on, focusing on each man and their respective talent and current life standing before the depression hits. Charles S. Howard (Jeff Bridges) works a clerk in a bicycle shop when he is asked to repair someone’s car, realizes he can make his own way by altering aspects of the engine to make the vehicles faster and more efficient. He then becomes the leading Buick salesman in the state, amassing a large fortune for himself in the process. Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) comes from a well off Canadian family. As a result of the Great Depression, his family is left with nothing and surviving day to day with menial jobs. Red, making some money as a young trainer at a horse track is left to live with an adult trainer and make his own way at the age of 15, eventually becoming a jockey. On top of being a jockey, Red participates in illegal boxing matches which have left him completely blind in his right eye. Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) is a horse trainer who has an affinity for injured or “untrainable” horses. When we encounter him, he is pretty much a drifter, working from stable to stable.\n\nHoward makes it through the depression mostly intact, but after his young son is killed in an automobile accident, he enters a deep depression. He eventually travels to Mexico to finalize his divorce (a result of the depression, and drink himself into a stupor when he meets his future wife Marcela Zabala (Elizabeth Banks). Marcela helps Howard recover from his depression with the help of her interest in horse racing. After acquiring some stables, Howard has a chance encounter with Smith, during which he showcases his skill with rehabilitating abused and otherwise injured horses telling Howard “You don’t throw a whole life away ‘cause it’s banged up a little bit.” After Smith is hired to run Howard’s stables, Smith talks him into acquiring a colt named Seabiscuit. The horse comes from a good lineage but is deemed unfit and has been abused, and trained to lose to other horses in order to build their self-esteem. While corralling “The Biscuit”, Smith notices a similar tenacity between Red and the horse and decides that Red should be his Jockey.\n\nWhat followed was an impressive career for all four participants. After a few close losses, Red revealed his disability to Smith and Howard, Smith, ready to cut ties with Red who he labeled a “liar” was reminded by Howard that “You don’t throw a whole life away ‘cause it’s banged up a little bit.” Red and The Biscuit go on to win many races and become and underdog icon for many still ravaged by the Great Depression. Howard, ever the salesman, would go on to publically challenge Samuel Riddle (Eddie Jones) the owner of prized Stallion, War Admiral, the top race horse in the country to a race. After many evasion attempts on the part of Riddle, he finally accepts the challenge but on his own terms; no start gate, match race (one on one) and on their home track, Pimlico. Only a few weeks before the race, Red is severely injured while breaking in a young colt that was spooked on the track. His leg is shattered and his career effectively ended. Howard, on Red’s suggestion, hires George Woolf (Gary Stevens), and accomplished jockey and Red’s old friend to ride Seabiscuit for the race and onward.\n\nThe race between War Admiral and Seabiscuit is an event. Workers are given half days at work, and the center of the field is open to the general public at the typically exclusive Pimlico Race Course. The Biscuit then proceeds to pull off a massive upset against War Admiral due mostly to advice given to Woolf by Red leading up to the race; on the final stretch, fall back and let The Biscuit look into The Admiral’s eyes and he will give everything he has to win, and that was exactly what happened.\n\nAfter more successful races, Seabiscuit injures his leg, and much like Red it is said that he will never race again. Red, feeling that neither he nor Seabiscuit is down for good, fabricates his own splint that gives him the ability to ride again, slowly regaining his racing ability as well as The Biscuit. We later see them both racing at the Santa Anita track (the same track where Seabiscuit was injured). Red is surprised to see Woolf riding another horse in the race. During the race, Seabiscuit falls into last place, and Woolf hangs back. After Woolf reassuring Red that his horse had no chance to be competitive in this race anyway, Red leads Seabiscuit close to get a good look at Woolf’s horse’s eye so that he will fight his way to the front; the strategy works as Seabiscuit goes on to win the race.\n\nReal Life, Reel Differences\n\nRed Pollard’s family was affected by the depression as depicted in the film, but the main cause for their struggles was a flood in 1915 destroyed their factory and essentially their livelihood. The Depression just made it worse.\n\nIn addition, Red wasn’t left on his own at 15, but instead with a guardian who accompanied him with the adult trainers. That guardian then decided to leave Red to his own devices.\n\nRed didn’t lose his vision while boxing, but instead in a horse accident (the first of many), where a horse kicked up a lose rock on the track that hit Red in the head, causing optical brain damage. This was before the time where jockey’s wore helmets, and would have prevented the accident.\n\nCharles S. Howard actually had four children, and while one did die in an auto-accident, he was not as young as he was depicted in the film. In actuality, he was 15 years old at the time of the accident.\n\nWhile Seabiscuit was trained to lose early, he became a marginal racer, not the complete loser depicted. Also, many of the losing results in the film either didn’t happen because the horse was not entered in the race or he actually won, and not by a slim margin.\n\nAlso, Red did not admit he was half-blind after losing a race; it would have been career suicide. Instead he just told Smith and Howard that he was trapped on the rail with soft dirt (The Biscuit didn’t like soft dirt) and couldn’t get free.\n\nRed was actually injured months before the race at Pimlico against War Admiral when a horse fell on him, crushing his ribs. He almost died. After he fully recovered from this incident, he raced several other times before the leg injury occurred; it was months before the race at Pimlico\n\nIn the film it is depicted as George Woolf’s first time riding Seabiscuit, but due to the earlier injuries suffered by Red, Woolf had ridden Seabiscuit 9 times prior to Pimlico.\n\nRed is shown as single, but he actually married the nurse who helped rehabilitate him after his leg injury. Her name was Agnes, and they had two children.\n\nAfter Red’s leg injury and recovery, he raced three times before the final race shown.\n\nSeabiscuit and War-Admiral were actually related, and both horses were sired by Man O’ War\n\nWar Admiral is constantly mentioned as being a large horse when in actuality he and Seabiscuit were around the same size, and was in actuality one of the smaller sires of Man O’ War\n\nIn the race between War Admiral and Seabiscuit, War Admiral’s owner insisted that there would be no starting gate in this race; the real-life reason for this was because War Admiral HATED starting gates, and they threw off his time. Watch the actual footage of that race in Pimlico between Seabiscuit and War Admiral; Seabiscuit is the lighter-haired horse that starts on the outside track.\n\nIn the final race, Red is shown as being surprised that Woolf is on another horse but in actuality, Red knew well before that Woolf would be in the race. Woolf did indeed finish last in that race. The movie also showed Seabiscuit at the back of the pack in that race when in reality, he was never any worse than 4th at any point in that race.\n\nAlthough unsubstantiated, there are rumors that the second place horse, Kayak II, tanked the race in order for Red and Seabiscuit to build some confidence. Kayak II was also owned by Charles S. Howard.\n\nWhere Are They Now?\n\nSeabiscuit retired soon after the 1940 season. Often described as lazy, mean, and broken, these traits would go on to be fondly remembered by all of those affected by The Biscuit. After a long stretch as a struggling horse, with some wins but many more losses on his record, Seabiscuit was finally purchased by the right owner, handled by the right trainer, and ridden by the perfect jockey.\n\nHe was retired to the Rigdgewood Ranch in California. At the time he was horse racing’s all-time leading money winner. When he was put to stud, he sired 108 foals which included Sea Sovereign and Sea Swallow, who were successful racehorses in their own right. Seabiscuit was also used to herd cattle as a form of exercise. Seabiscuit died peacefully in 1947, and per a tradition by Howard of all his horses, he is buried in an unmarked grave on the outskirts of his property. It’s said that over 50,000 people went to visit Seabiscuit during his seven retirement years, and hundreds were allowed to view the casket upon his death, before it was secretly buried. Seabiscuit has several statues and memorials throughout the country, including:\n\nA statue outside the main entrance of The Shops at Tanforan, formally the Tanforan Racetrack\n\nA statue at the Santa Anita Racetrack\n\nA Statue at his home, The Ridgewood Ranch\n\nA life-sized statue of both George Woolf and Seabiscuit at the Remington Carriage Museum in George Woolf’s hometown of Carldston, Alberta, Canada.\n\nESPN Classic’s SportsCentury series produced a profiled Seabiscuit:\n\nJohn “Red” Pollard, partially blind and plagued by injuries didn’t have an ounce of quit in him. Described by his sister as “happy as heck” even when he was going through the worst of it, Red was either reading or riding. He and Seabiscuit couldn’t have been more made for each other. Tom Smith may have selected Red to be Seabiscuits jockey, but it was really the horse who made the decision in a rare moment of affection to the complete stranger one day while Red and a friend were stranded in Detroit. Red Pollard was a founding member of the Jockeys’ Guild in 1940. Following that season, Red relocated to Rhode Island and continued to ride into the 1950’s, primarily in the New England area. He passed away in March of 1981 and was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1982. He is buried just north of the Naragansset Park Racetrack.\n\nCharles S. Howard was ever the innovator, and ahead of the curve. It was gut instinct and a marketing savvy that kept him relevant while others floundered. From racing his own cars to build the Buick reputation when could have easily retired with his insurance money, to buying The Biscuit because of a strong feeling about the spitfire Colt, Howard was a motivated man of vision. Although mostly known for Seabiscuit, Howard was a renowned Thoroughbred owner and bought/raised several other successful racehorses throughout his career, notably Kayak II, whom Seabiscuit would beat in his final race. He died of a heart attack in 1950.\n\nGeorge Woolf died tragically after falling off of his horse, Please Me, in a race at Santa Anita Park on January 3, 1946. He suffered a concussion and died in the hospital the next day as a result. George Woolf was a diabetic, and it is said that neither the jockeys nor track stewards saw any collisions or accidents that would have caused Woolf to fall from his horse, and it is assumed that he may have fainted as a result of his condition. Although Woolf was known to regulate his diet rigorously so he would not have to participate in the starvation tactics of most other jockeys, it is very possible that his diabetes played a part in his death. As he was only 35 years old at the time of his death, and being one of the most respected jockey’s in the country, the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award was created soon after his death. Also of note; the actor who portrayed Woolf in Seabiscuit(Gary Stevens) was in fact a renowned jockey and won the George Woolf award in 1996, he has also been inducted into the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame.\n\nGeorge Woolf has several statues and memorial dedicated to him throughout the U.S. and Canada\n\nA bronze, life size statue near the walking ring of Santa Anita Park\n\nIn 1955, he was the inaugural inductee into the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame\n\nIn 1956, he was inducted into Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame\n\nIn 1976, he was one of the first inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame\n\nA life-sized statue of both George Woolf and Seabiscuit at the Remington Carriage Museum in George Woolf’s hometown of Carldston, Alberta, Canada.\n\n“Silent” Tom Smith was a real life horse whisperer. He spoke very little, and was known to be cantankerous around humans. He was truly in his element with animals, specifically horses. Not much is known of his pre-training life as he never spoke of it except to a trusted few. All that is really known is that he’d been breaking and training horses since he was a young boy, and traveled extensively doing so by the time he was 15 or so.\n\nIn the 1940’s, Tom Smith was hired to train for the Maine Chance Farm owned by cosmetics mogul Elizabeth Arden. He was the U.S. Champion Trainer twice; 1940 and 1945. He was suspended from horseracing for a year in 1945 by The Jockey Club after being found responsible for administering ephedrine to one of his horses. The drug was actually given by the stable foreman but under New York State racing rules, Smith was held responsible as the trainer. Once he was no longer under suspension, he returned to the farm and trained 1947 Kentucky Derby winner Jet Pilot.\n\nSmith retired in 1955 having trained 29 winning horses over the course of his career. He died in 1957 at the age of 78 after complications from a stroke. Before then, he’d spent the remainder of his life away from the horses he’d loved so much. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame in 2001."
