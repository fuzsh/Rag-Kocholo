        "text": "But despite all this, Laura Hillenbrand's \"Seabiscuit\" became a best-selling book and Gary Ross' adaptation was one of last year's best-looking movies. And all the shots of horse racing that looked so difficult and unbelievable in the movie, are revealed in all their simplicity on the DVD release.\n\nHillenbrand's account of the life and times of the race horse was a sweeping account that captured the emotions of the Depression Era in which Seabiscuit flourished, which Ross admirably captures in the abbreviated film version.\n\nThe opening scenes of the movie show America's progression from bicycles and carriages to automobiles and later capture the desperation and longing caused by the Depression. All of these historical touchpoints also manage to serve as introduction to the three main human characters of the movie.\n\nCharles Howard (Jeff Bridges) falls into auto industry riches after he finds the bicycle trade fruitless. But the Great Depression and his own personal depression after losing his son derail his life.\n\nThe push West and advent of the car takes away horse trainer Tom Smith's (Chris Cooper) land and livelihood. And the Pollard family is driven into debt leading Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) to leave home and support his family.\n\nAll of these paths lead to Mexico where the unlikely trio finds they need each other to succeed. And the method of success just happens to be the nearly-discarded Seabiscuit.\n\nAfter the growing pains of getting use to the horse and each other, Pollard and Seabiscuit sweep through a number of victories leading to a match race with the seemingly unbeatable War Admiral. But there's plenty of true twists, turns and complications that maintain the story's drama.\n\nThere's plenty of strong performances to carry the load for the non-verbal horse. Cooper continues his string of memorable roles with as he plays his horse whisperer with compassion, but still with a touch of resentment as his world is being condensed. Bridges does a fine job while grandstanding his horse. And William H. Macy gives the movie a spark of energy as the schlocky track announcer.\n\nBut the crux of the movie lies on the back of Maguire, who also was one of the movie's executive producers. Maguire does a good job as the headstrong jockey, but the performance seems all too familiar. Maguire has made a niche market in playing the plucky underdog with the cracking voice and it would be refreshing to see him stretch his ability a little more.\n\nThere are lots of great-looking shots throughout the movie and while they seem utterly beautiful and complicated, the DVD features reveal the almost comical truth of the shooting style.\n\nThe \"making of\" feature shows conversations between Maguire and real-life jockey Gary Stevens on the backs of their horses were done with the two actors on animatronic horses that look real up close, but are seen to be nothing but glorified carnival horses from a distance. But there certainly was a lot of difficulty in staging the races with actual horses  which includes the jockeys acting out where their horse would be in the race  that the feature also reveals.\n\nThere's a lot of nice background information about the horse and his context also handed out with a documentary fleshing out the landscape of America during the depression with some interesting tidbits thrown in by historian David McCullough, who also is the film's narrator.\n\nBut the extras also manage to be entertainingly outside the realm of usual features. The director's commentary is actually more of Hollywood big shot Steven Soderbergh interviewing Ross about the process he went through in making the movie. This leads to a pretty informative track and also a surprising amount of humor from Soderbergh.\n\nRoss further explicates on his process while going through the shooting notes he put in his script which reveals that maybe all screenwriters have the nervous-talking affliction of \"Adaptation's\" Charlie Kaufman while they write. And if all this isn't weird enough there's a photo album of Bridges' shots he took during the filming of the movie.\n\nBut when a nation gets captivated by a horse, anything can happen.\n\n\"Seabiscuit\": AB\n\nDVD features: AB"
