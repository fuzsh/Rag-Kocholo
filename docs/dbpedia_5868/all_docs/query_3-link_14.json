        "text": "Seabiscuit\n\nThe story of champion racehorse Seabiscuit and the three men who shaped his destiny sounds like the worst sort of Hollywood hokum. Tragedies affect all of the characters and seem designed to pull at our heartstrings.\n\nYet the story behind the Laura Hillenbrand best-seller and this fine adaptation by director Gary Ross is true. Struggling to recover from the Great Depression, people embraced Seabiscuit, a short, discarded horse that walked with a limp and was too lazy and temperamental to be a champion. Like many Americans, the horse only needed a chance to prove himself. As Seabiscuit began to register one improbable victory after another, his Cinderella story gave hope to those who were feeling down-and-out. Seabiscuit became such a star he was named the biggest newsmaker of 1938, beating out FDR and Hitler.\n\nThree scarred men were responsible for saving Seabiscuit from the glue factory. Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) made a fortune in the automobile industry, but a tragedy left him distant and impersonal. Horse trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) was an old timer who struggled to find meaning in an ever more industrialized world. And young Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) never had an opportunity to realize his dreams. He supported himself with odd jobs and came upon success only by racing horses on dangerous tracks.\n\nEach performer rises to the occasion and provides some of the finest acting of the year. Ross does a magnificent job capturing the era. While cynical viewers might say the director overstates the horse's metaphorical significance, there's an undeniable power to this tale. Americans love to believe in underdogs, hard-earned success, and the possibility of redemption always around the corner. Ross's use of visual shorthand to suggest the inner thoughts of the characters is also effective and keeps the film moving at a brisk pace.\n\nSticklers will note that the film streamlines Hillenbrand's boook. Pollard's struggles to maintain his weight and his love affair with a nurse are given little attention, as is Smith's war with the press. Seabiscuit's long rise to fame is also condensed. But Ross and his fine cast economize and make the story work. (CK)\n\n(Running time 2:20, rated PG-13)\n\nGrade A\n\nParkway Pointe\n\nWhale Rider\n\nTwelve-year-old Pai has problems that may, at first, seem unique compared to those of American preteens. Though the young member of New Zealand's Maori tribe might not be worried about whether her first crush will return her affection or if she's fitting in with the hip clique at school, she still strives for that universal, elusive validation most tweens desire--to be accepted for who she is.\n\nNiki Caro's magnificent new film Whale Rider is based on the novel by Witi Ihimaera about the livings conditions of the once fierce Maori tribe. The chieftain of the tribe, Koro (Rawiri Paratene), longs to maintain tribal traditions. However, when his grandson and daughter-in-law die in childbirth and his own son, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis), turns his back on him, he's left with few options. Still, his obstinacy prevents him from acknowledging the treasure that survived these tragedies--Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes), the twin sister of the stillborn infant. The young girl grows up to be inquisitive and eager to please, embracing the Maori ways. Yet Koro's overlooks Pai as the best candidate to keep the Maori traditions alive, picking instead one of her peers to assume his mantle.\n\nStealing almost every scene she's in, Keisha Castle-Hughes gives a performance that's alive with genuine heartache, pain, and conversely, the joy of life. This young lady is a major find, lighting up the screen whenever she appears.\n\nThe film closes with one of the most emotionally satisfying climaxes of the year. It plays against our expectations, as much of the film also does, and refuses to take the easy way out. (CK)\n\n(Running time 1:45, rated PG-13)\n\nGrade A\n\nWhite Oaks\n\nLara Croft, Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life\n\nLara Croft, Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (forthwith called Tomb Raider 2 for the sake of brevity and my own sanity) is the best film adapted from a video game that has ever been made. The irony is that I also used that phrase to describe the original Tomb Raider, which I loathed. \"Confusing,\" \"boring,\" and \"soulless\" are only a few adjectives I sprinkled into my review. And truth be told, I wasn't expecting anything better from the sequel.\n\nThe key to its success is its star, Angelina Jolie, whose lippy, hippy curves come squeezed into as many skintight scuba suits and knee-high boots as the costume department can provide. She's forming an indelible physical presence few, if any, contemporary actresses can match. More importantly, Jolie is a very good actress. She can project a cool confidence in even the most outlandish situations and recite potentially laugh-inducing dialogue with enough wit to pull it off. That can't be as easy as it sounds when you're portraying an English aristocrat fighting African tree monsters while hunting for Pandora's Box. But Jolie does it in sophisticated style with a pitch-perfect accent to boot.\n\nThe plot is standard video-game stuff and is even structured as several \"missions.\" Evil scientist Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds), who creates biological weapons for terrorists, has stolen an orb which reveals the location of Pandora's mythical box, potentially a weapon \"more powerful than you can imagine.\" Beating feet to get there first is pony-tailed Lady Lara Croft (Jolie), hired by Her Majesty's Secret Service whose guide is Terry Sheridan, a former lover, mercenary, and traitor. Bouncing her way from Greece to Shanghai to Hong Kong to the peaks of Kilimanjaro, Croft rarely loses her cool, facing danger with the automatics pasted to her hips and the sensual snarl on her pneumatic lips. Jolie's performance is not unlike Sean Connery's early turns as James Bond. She mixes suspense with a touch of class typically lacking in action heroes.\n\nDean Georgaris' screenplay is lazy, but the performers are good enough to make the coincidences work. I'm a sucker for old-fashioned pulp adventures set in exotic locations, and Georgaris' glowing orbs, mysterious forces from outer space, and treasure-filled Greek tombs are joys to behold. Unfortunately director Jan de Bont (Speed) films too many close-ups to appease the audience who will one day watch Tomb Raider 2 on TNT. This plays especially poorly during the film's climax.\n\nDe Bont's editing keeps the pace moving at a rapid clip and thankfully eschews trendy MTV-style pyrotechnics. Hollywood's reliance on digital effects causes Jolie to unconvincingly bop a shark in the nose and crash a speeding aircraft into a Chinese lake, yet de Bont's most breathtaking action sequence is a daring skyscraper rooftop escape performed by actual stunt doubles. Action filmmakers, take note.

The movie brings up issues about genetic experimentation, the misuse of scientific research and our instinctive dislike of misfits, and actually talks about them. . . . [Director] Ang Lee (The Ice Storm) has boldly taken the broad outlines of a comic book story and transformed them to his own purposes; this is a comic book movie for people who wouldn't be caught dead at a comic book movie.\" (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times) \"Will somebody please get Ang Lee away from popular culture. . . .

It's an extraordinary waste of time and an astounding piece of incoherent storytelling.\" (Michael Wilmington, Chicago Tribune) \"If you've seen the miserable trailers for this movie, please ignore them. . . if this movie, with its literary underpinnings, sounds at all stodgy, relax.
