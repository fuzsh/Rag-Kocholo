        "text": "The author of \"Seabiscuit\" answered readers' questions about the book turned movie, her obsession with horses and living with chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nQ. 1. Your book is so wonderfully written; it's completely absorbing. It enters my heart when you speak for the feelings of the horse, as if Seabiscuit is describing what he's going through. My question is why this subject? How long did the research take?\n\nA. Thanks for the compliment. I stumbled on the subject accidentally. The basics of Seabiscuit's story have always been moderately well known among racing fans, but at the time that I came upon it, no one had ever explored the lives of the men who handled him. In 1996, I was going through some old racing material when I came across a few bits of information on Seabiscuit's jockey, owner and trainer. It struck me as fascinating that an automobile magnate who had devoted his life to making horses obsolete would find his greatest success managing a racehorse with a frontier horseman. I was intrigued enough to look a little deeper. I quickly realized that I had found an extraordinarily dramatic human story to go with the equine one. I spent the next four years researching it.\n\nQ. 2. I am a historian. How did you move through to make this time period \"live\"? In other words, what helped you in bringing this particularly harsh period of time to life on paper?\n\nA. I think the secret to bringing immediacy to any nonfiction story is to ferret out every detail that is there to be found, so that the reader feels like an eyewitness. To do this, I consulted a very broad range of sources, from record books to living witnesses, and everything in between. I studied every film and photograph that I could find, and acquired complete newspapers and magazines from the period and read them cover to cover so I could put myself in the mindset of the men and women of the era. I researched what things cost, what books and movies were popular, what the weather was on a particular day, anything that might help me stand in the shoes of an average American of the Depression era. I was very fortunate in that Seabiscuit was covered very heavily in the press and followed by millions of people, so there was a lot to be found.\n\nQ. 3. Do you credit any works of \"artful nonfiction\" that had an important influence on the style of your telling the Seabiscuit story?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
