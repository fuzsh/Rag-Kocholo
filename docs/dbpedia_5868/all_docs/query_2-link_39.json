        "text": "“I feel the need for speed”…Life & Business Lessons from Top Gun. With all the hoopla around the release of Maverick, I want to take a minute to revisit the original movie, a classic that stands the test of time. Top Gun featured some of the best actors of its day, songs that topped the charts, and dizzying special effects. But beneath its flashy exterior was superb storytelling that resonated with audiences. I recently visited Kansas City BBQ in San Diego, the bar where key scenes from the movie were filmed and reflected on the life and business lessons from the blockbuster film. Maverick’s story is one of redemption and revival. He’s a loner with something to prove, who was only selected for Top Gun when Cougar lost it and turned in his wings. Maverick wants to prove he belongs there. And that only happens when he learns to be part of a team and thanks to the mentorship of Viper. In the end, he prevails because he learns to trust others and believe in himself. I think many of us can relate to this story. For me, it’s very personal. I wasn’t the first pick to take over my family’s business, and I’ve had to work hard to prove that I’ve earned the CEO title. It’s thanks to wonderful mentors, like Paul Morris, FASLA and an amazing team, including my partner, RG Lamar, board members like Ted Wright, and the team at the candy plant (Tim Dell and Seaborn Dell) that Stuckey’s is on the road to redemption. Yes, beneath the “Highway to the Danger Zone” tough veneer is a great story that still provides inspiration and lessons of redemption for us all."
