        "text": "Hold your horses, ye ole Run for the Roses; the real equine history and admiration truly shines brightest within the big and small screens of the cinematic universe—where the four-legged stars of the show carried movie and TV franchises on their back, not just some jockey.\n\nThey made the scripts pop. Nay—Neigh!—they were the script.\n\nThroughout history, few horses in film or television have strutted with such prowess than these fine specimens.\n\nAnd we’re off!\n\nBefore the debate on “Did Rose have enough room on the door?” stemming from the “Titanic”film, there was the “Did Atreyu do enough to save Artax?!” conversation in “The NeverEnding Story.”\n\nYes, the Swamps of Sadness wrecked Artax’s moxie, but thankfully, Bastian saved the day in the end — for any child who’s ever watched the movie.\n\nAnother Oscar-nominated horse flick, this Steven Spielberg film took the adapted 1982 novel to the big screen and delivered a hit. And something of an interesting dive into a typical story of the timeframe: an athlete (in this case, a thoroughbred horse) having the expected path derailed by getting called to serve in the army during the war.\n\nNo horse can hang with the original A-list equine. Without Mister Ed, it’s difficult to say how the genre of talking-animal movies and shows might have progressed. (Up to that point, only Francis the Talking Mule had any kind of traction in Hollywood.)\n\nAnd remember: “A horse is a horse, of course, of course, and no one can talk to a horse, of course. That is, of course, unless the horse is the famous Mister Ed!”\n\nBut Mister Ed doesn’t take our top spot …\n\nSure, you don’t see the horse for one second, not even a glimpse, but in the current age of pop culture fame, that’s merely a small footnote in the grand scheme of things.\n\nNope, the reality is this: while you may have heard of all the horses listed so far, chances are, a portion of the readers have yet to. But, thanks to “A Christmas Story” playing on a 24-hour loop every holiday season, it’s almost a sure-fire fact of life that if we asked you the name of The Lone Ranger’s nephew’s horse, you’d say… “Victor!”\n\nNow that’s fame."
