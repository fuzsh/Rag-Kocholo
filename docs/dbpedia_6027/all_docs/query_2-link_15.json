        "text": "Although transformed by globalization, Australian colonialist prejudice resurfaces due to the continent's cultural affiliation with and geographical division from the Western world. Insurgent themes in horror such as the dangers of technology also contemplate a dystopian future augmented by transhumanism. Indeed, the persistence of the past surfaces in monstrous forms due to failing cultural integration between \" White Australia, \" interior Aboriginality, and an Asia perceived as invasive. This essay asks how The Perimeter (2016), a tense, \" creep-out \" film set in the traditionally malevolent, Australian bushland, is constructed within these paradoxical trends. This paper examines theory through self-reflective practice and action research detailing a meta-discourse on globalization by utilizing Debbie Lisle's analysis of global politics and A.K. Baishya's commentary on transhumanism and the returning political repressed via the \" optical unconscious. \" The paper asks how Australia is a unique ferment of conservative fears, which nevertheless remain globally relevant. How does a predominantly white-centric screen culture continue to manifest xenophobia as internal/ external binary and obfuscate global responsibilities such as border control and respect for Indigenous culture?\n\nPsychoanalysis touches many aspects of the 'two cultures' which seem so hard to reconcile and some analysts oppose neuropsychoanalysis as a dangerous biologizing of the mind (Blass and Carmeli 2007). It may seem that psychoanalytic applications to art and neuroscience are contradictory and pulling in opposite directions. However, the groundwork for a neuropsychoanalytic aesthetics has already begun (Oppenheim 2005, Holland 2003, 2007). Horror seems particularly appropriate for this interdisciplinary project, as it is prototypically a 'body genre' (Williams 1995) privileging affective bodily participation, and the centrality of powerful basic emotions such as FEAR (Panksepp 2004). Psychoanalysis has always had an affinity with horror (Day 1985, Schneider 2009, Creed 1993, Freud 1919, Jones 2008) but is increasingly challenged by new cognitive science approaches (Hasson et al. 2008, Price 2009). This article seeks to bring findings and methods of neuroscience into psychoanalytic film theory, and proposes a neuropsychoanalytic research programme into (horror) film spectatorship. Based on a presentation made at the tenth International Neuropsychoanalysis Congress, Paris 2009 https://psyartjournal.com/article/show/dodds-the_monstrous_brain_a_neuropsychoanalyti\n\nScience fiction is one of the most conceptually and politically adventurous fictional genres. It takes us to new worlds that may be fundamentally different from our own, though its genesis was in the industrial revolution at the beginning of the nineteenth century (Roberts 2006, 38). It was that basis in scientific experimentation and technological development that gave the genre its name and also provided its major tropes such as the robot, the android and the alien. In looking to the erotics of the genre, therefore, we are already in a highly politicized and often conceptually challenging fictional space, in which major questions about the nature and qualities of human beings are being articulated and/or interrogated. Science fiction film brings this conceptual and political challenge to a wide audience, deploying the major tropes of the genre and animating them through an erotics that engages the audience with both the world of the narrative and, self-reflexively or not, their own world-their own behaviours; their own fears and desires.\n\nIn this article we discuss videogame adaptations of the Alien series of films, in particular Alien: Colonial Marines (2013) and Alien: Isolation (2014). In comparing critical responses and developer commentary across these texts, we read the very different affective, aesthetic and socio-political readings of the titular alien character in each case. The significant differences in what it means to 'look' at this figure can be analyzed in terms of wider storytelling techniques that stratify remediation between film and games. Differing accounts of how storytelling techniques create intensely 'immersive' experiences such as horror and identification—as well as how these experiences are valued—become legible across this set of critical contexts. The concept of the 'look' is developed as a comparative series that enables the analysis of the affective dynamics of film and game texts in terms of gender-normative 'technicity', moving from the 'mother monster' of the original film to the 'short controlled burst' of the colonial marines and finally to the 'psychopathic serendipity' of Alien: Isolation.\n\nAs a distinct genre, Science Fiction film is the obvious genre dealing with the future. However, some of the recent SF cinema deals with the opposite – a journey into the past: films such as The Time Machine (GB, 1936), The Time Machine (USA, 2002) Terminator (USA, 1984) or Back to the Future (USA, 1985) or even Fifth Element (France, 1998). Some other films, such as Chris Marker’s La Jettee, (France, 1960) and Blade Runner (USA, 1982) are also interesting from the time-travel aspect, as well as Spielberg’s Jurassic Park (USA, 1993), offering a variant on the above. Such journeys into the past (and into memory, real or prosthetic) are by necessity recalling the psychoanalytical process, and its most well-known reference text, Oedipus Rex, a text wholly concerned with a journey back in time, into the personal and communal past. The concept of time-travel as an instance of the Freudian primal scene was examined by Constance Penley (Penley, 1990, 119) in an article about Critical Dystopia in SF cinema, and this is further developed here, as a way of decoding this atypical time-travel in the genre. Use is made also of the important writings of J T Fraser (Fraser, 1982) about time in psychoanalysis, and his concept of the Umwelt, the experiential inner world of time-layers. The current work is examining the confines, attributes and characteristics of time travel in a number of recent films, referring to a number of theorists from different fields. Specifically, it examines the journey back in time in those films from a psychoanalytical perspective, and its relationship to the oedipal, and also to the mythological, through Oedipus Rex. The paper also examines other theoretical approaches to cinematic time, based on Gilles Deleuze’s work (Deleuze, 1989), and dealing with time as a non-linear representational phenomenon. The paper ends with relating to the cinema itself as a time-machine, an apparatus of representing and reinterpreting the past, a virtual space of desire where social wishes, dreams and nightmares dwell.\n\nIn this thesis, Turkish horror films, which are made after 2000, and that which consist Islamic motifs are studied. The monsters or any elements oriented with the threat, characters and other motifs are analyzed through their relation with Islam and their representations are studied first within the films respectively and then across the films in a holistic approach. The Islamic motif is first studied through Turkish history and sociology and given in its literature study in order to find the representational relations of the motifs. The films project a conflict of Islam and modernity, as a reflection of the synthesis of the East and the West that builds the basis of modern Turkish identity, and the Islamic motifs in the films stand for political functions to rebalance the conflict within the modern and Islamic elements in order to achieve a synthesis of the East and the West."
