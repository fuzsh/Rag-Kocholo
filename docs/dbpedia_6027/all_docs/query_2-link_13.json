        "text": "No, it wasn't the first film:\n\nThere is quite a long article about the \"Death of a child\" trope. Let me bring just a few examples:\n\nCross of iron (1977) R shows the death of child-soldiers\n\nAssault on Precinct 13 (1976) R was quite famous for its brutality: In one of the scenes, the gang leader kills a little girl who was trying to buy ice creams from a truck\n\nJaws (1975) PG: shark attacks and kills a boy on a raft\n\nCome drink with me (1966) (not rated in the US, from PG to 16+ in other countries): a boy-monk is killed via poisoned needle shot to his eye\n\nOnce upon a time in the West (1968) PG-13: a boy is killed with his whole family\n\nDon't look now (1960) R: starts with a child drowning in a pond\n\nCanyon passage (1946) TV-PG: both mother and child killed on-screen by Indians\n\nFrankenstein (1931) TV-PG: the Monster throws a girl into a lake where she drowns.\n\nCountry Doctor (1909) has a child dying of a mysterious illness\n\nSo while indeed it happens quite rarely it did happen before 1980.\n\nThe rating is a bit hard to find for older movies, and it is hard to say that a child's death has caused an increased rating. In the case of really old ones like Frankenstein or Canyon Passage, the answer would be \"no\", as they are close to the PG rating. Don't look now is famous for a very realistic sex scene which caused quite a scandal, the death of the girl probably had little to do with it. Assault... and Cross... are generally brutal and graphic, hence the rating, while Come drink... is a wuxia movie, so while it is brutal with many deaths, it did not get overly high restriction in most countries.\n\nI add a number of films I have seen where one or more children die.\n\nThe Village of the Damned (1995)\n\nThe Adventures of Huck Finn (1993)\n\nRobocop 2 (1990)\n\nPet Cemetary (1989)\n\nChildren of the Corn (1984)\n\nThe Final conflict (1981)\n\nZulu Dawn (1979)\n\nDamien: Omen II (1978)\n\nWhat the Peeper Saw (1972)\n\nUlzana's Raid (1972)\n\nSoldier Blue (1970)\n\nSudden Terror/Eyewitness (1970)\n\nThe Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966)\n\nTower of London (1962) https://moviechat.org/tt0056606/Tower-of-London/58c724625ec57f0478ed7087/The-Child-Princes-Possible-Spoilers?reply=5df2aa640f49722942728325&animate=false[1]\n\nThe Innocents (1961)\n\nThe Village of the damned (1960)\n\nThe Giant Gehemoth (1959) https://moviechat.org/tt0052611/The-Giant-Behemoth/58c706b84e1cf308b937c223/A-Grim-Aspect-of-this-Film?reply=5df2aa2d0f49722942728320&animate=false[2]\n\nThe Oregon Trail (1959): https://moviechat.org/tt0053145/The-Oregon-Trail/58c723465ec57f0478ec8e10/Unusually-violent-for-its-time[3]\n\nThe Bad Seed (1956)\n\nThe Yellow Tomahawk (1954)\n\nWestward the Women (1951)\n\nTomahawk (1951)\n\nRocky Mountain (1950)\n\nTower of London (1939)\n\nThe Charg eo fthe Light Brigade (1936)\n\nEnd of the Trail: (1932)\n\nFrankenstein (1931)\n\nIt is quite possible there is at least one film where a child is seen dying onscreen for each of the more than 120 years that movies have been made."
