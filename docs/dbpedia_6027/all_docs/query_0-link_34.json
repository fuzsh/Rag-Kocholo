        "text": "Fellow Svengoolie SvenPals everywhere will be jumping for joy for his big coast-to-coast broadcast premiere of a classic Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer sci-fi thriller feature.\n\n“Svengoolie” presents his big coast-to-coast broadcast premiere of “Village of the Damned” (1960), this Sat. on Me-TV\n\nOriginal 1960 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer theatrical trailer for “Village of the Damned.”\n\nThe legendary Berwyn/Chicago-based sci-fi/thriller film host will present his big coast-to-coast broadcast premiere of “Village of the Damned” (1960), this Sat., Aug. 17 at 8 p.m. Eastern/7 p.m. Central on Me-TV.\n\nThe classic 1960 MGM sci-fi thriller production was directed by Wolf Rilla and was produced by Ronald Kinnoch. Rilla and Kinnoch (under the pseudonym of George Barclay for Ronald Kinnoch’s screenwriting position) also co-wrote the screenplay for “Village of the Damned” with screenwriter Stirling Silliphant (Silliphant was best known as the creator of the 1958-62 Columbia/Screen Gems TV adaptation of “Naked City” from 1958-63 and the studio’s “Route 66” TV series from 1960-64). Rilla, Kinnoch/Barclay and Silliphant’s screenplay treatment was adapted from the John Wyndham (a.k.a. John Harris) novel, “The Midwich Cuckoos.” Exterior scenes of Rilla’s MGM sci-fi thriller were filmed on location in the village of Letchmore Heath, England; according to Jeff Stafford’s Turner Classic Movies article on “Village of the Damned” (1960).\n\nIn the Berwyn/Chicago area, Svengoolie previously showcased “Village of the Damned” (1960) on his hometown television station, WCIU-TV/”The U” back in Oct. 1995, according to IMDB.\n\nWho was in “Village of the Damned” (1960)?\n\nThe players who appeared in “Village of the Damned” (1960) were George Sanders (as Gordon Zellaby), Barbara Shelley (as Anthea Zellaby), Michael Gwynn (as Maj. Alan Bernard), Laurence Naismith (as Dr. Willers), John Phillips (as Gen. Leighton)*, Richard Vernon (as Sir Edgar Hargraves), Jenny Laird (as Mrs. Harrington), Thomas Heathcote (as James Pawle), Martin Stephens (as David Zellaby), Charlotte Mitchell (as Janet Pawle), Richard Warner (as Harrington), Sarah Long (as Evelyn Harrington), Pamela Buck (as Milly Hughes), Rosamund Greenwood (as Ms. Ogle) and Susan Richards (as Mrs. Plumpton).\n\nVeteran actor George Sanders was best known for his numerous screen roles, including his title role of Simon Templar in the RKO Radio Pictures screen series adaptation of Leslie Charteris’ “The Saint” from 1939–41 and in the title role of Gay Lawrence in the RKO screen adaptation series of Michael Arlen’s “The Falcon” from 1941–42. Sanders won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his characterization of Addison DeWitt in Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s critically-acclaimed Twentieth Century Fox drama with Bette Davis, “All About Eve” (1950).\n\nBarbara Shelley was known for her various British horror film appearances, including her role of Carla Hoffman in Terence Fisher’s Columbia–Hammer monster classic with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, “The Gorgon” (1964). Michael Gwynn previously appeared in the role of Karl in Fisher’s Columbia-Hammer monster classic with Cushing, “The Revenge of Frankenstein” (1958) and was later known for his guest role of Lord Melbury in the pilot episode of the John Cleese–BBC comedy, “Fawlty Towers” (“A Touch of Class” in 1975).\n\nGeorge Sanders was not the first choice for the role of Gordon Zellaby in “Village of the Damned” (1960)\n\nAccording to IMDB, George Sanders was not the first choice for the role of Gordon Zellaby in Wolf Rilla’s MGM thriller. Veteran actor Ronald Colman was originally considered for the role of Gordon Zellaby when the studio originally planned to produce the screen adaption of Wyndham/Harris’ sci-fi thriller novel in 1957. Coleman was in ill health and died in 1958. The MGM feature project would not continue until 1960.\n\nMGM’s “spooky” film poster artwork design for “Village of the Damned” (1960)\n\nAccording to additional details from Jeff Stafford’s article on “Village of the Damned” (1960), many theatergoers were not only spooked by Rilla’s sci-fi thriller, they were also “spooked” by MGM’s poster artwork for the theatrical release of “Village of the Damned.”\n\nThe famed “eye glowing” visual effect\n\nThe “eye glowing” visual effects for the village children in “Village of the Damned” (1960) was perfected with the use of an optical photographic negative matte effect technique, according to additional information from IMDB. The British MGM theatrical print did not contain the “eye glowing” effects to comply with Britain’s film classification/certification protocol.\n\nSequel and latter re-make\n\nAccording to additional information from Jeff Stafford’s TCM article, the 1960 MGM-Villa production of “Village of the Damned” was a smash success throughout Britain and the United States. Four years later, Anton M. Leader directed the MGM sci-fi thriller sequel, “Children of the Damned” (1964); with Clive Powell, Bessie Love, Martin Miller, Ian Hendry, Barbara Ferris and Roberta Rex.\n\n35 years after Wolf Rilla’s original film adaptation of John Wyndham/Harris’ novel, veteran writer-director John Carpenter directed the Universal Studios sci-fi thriller re-make of “Village of the Damned” (1995) with Christopher Reeve (of “Superman” fame), Mark Hamill (of “Star Wars” fame), Kirstie Alley (of “Cheers” fame), Cody Dorkin, Trishalee Hardy and Jessye Quarry.\n\nBe sure to watch/record Svengoolie’s big coast-to-coast broadcast premiere of “Village of the Damned” (1960), this Sat. on Me-TV!\n\nWith George Sanders, Michael Gwynn, Barbara Shelley, Laurence Naismith, John Phillips*, Richard Vernon, Jenny Laird, Thomas Heathcote, Martin Stephens, Charlotte Mitchell, Richard Warner, Sarah Long, Pamela Buck, Rosamund Greenwood and Susan Richards, you will not want to miss out on Svengoolie and his big coast-to-coast broadcast premiere of “Village of the Damned” (1960), this Sat. on Me-TV!
