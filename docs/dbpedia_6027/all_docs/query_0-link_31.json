        "text": "Original Motion Picture Soundtrack by John Carpenter & Dave Davies (Limited Record Store Day Exclusive LP)\n\nWhile this writer will forever bow at the altar of John Carpenter’s solo work, there’s something very appealing about when the “Master of Horror” collaborates with other composers. Whether it be the once longtime partnership with Alan Howarth or JC’s recent work with son Cody Carpenter and godson Daniel Davies, it’s always an enjoyable time when the filmmaker/composer opens a project up to a joint attack. Teaming up with Dave Davies (the famed founder/member of The Kinks), Carpenter’s score for his 1995 evil children remake of Village of the Damned is given the exclusive Record Store Day treatment with a limited (2,000 copies made) must own 2X LP release.\n\nThe opening track “Angel of Death/Midwich Sleeps/Daybreak” is a great example of establishing a tone upfront, allowing its listener to be transported into this world of evil children all while hoping for survival. With ominous, mood-setting keys and some excellent string work, the score lets you know this is going to be something to fear. It isn’t long before “The Fair” pulls the rug out from underneath you, with Davies’ acoustic folk-like guitar work giving a serenity in contrast to the initial dark mood. If anything is true about Village of the Damned, it’s that you don’t quite know what’s coming from one cue to the next, and that’s the highest of compliments; the guessing game is part of its charm. It’s partially a function of the interesting way in which Carpenter and Davies work together. Their keys and guitar each bring you into a world you don’t quite understand, but want to. The duo continues to riff off of each other’s strong points, such as in later tracks like “Carlton” and “The Last Kiss,” becoming one of the score’s unique high points.\n\n“Baptism” kicks in with a music box meets bass-heavy ambience that feels like it would be playing in an evil crib toy. It’s equal parts pleasant and off-putting, something that could be said for the film’s own plot, with Christopher Reeve doing his best to find humanity’s survival while the entire town is held hostage by their own evil offspring. The way the cue digs under your skin and lives there is undeniable.\n\nThe real standout to this record is without a doubt “Children’s Theme,” which if this writer is being honest is one of Carpenter’s most undervalued score contributions. Beginning with a bell and Carpenter’s signature synth sound, the track finds bliss before we get one of the most infectious Carpenter riffs around. It builds and builds until something small and intimate feels like a bombastic amount of feeling and tone.\n\nWhile Village of the Damned didn’t quite gel with most critics and viewers, the score stands above the film’s (undeserved) reputation. Not only is it excellent on its own, but it breathes further life into an already interesting story. The way the images and music go together works flawlessly. Though it’s not many fans’ favorite JC joint, this record should be in every Carpenter fan’s collection."
