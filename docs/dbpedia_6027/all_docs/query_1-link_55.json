        "text": "David Farr, the writer behind films such asThe Night Manager and Hanna, is set to develop an adaptation of John Wyndham’s sci-fi novel The Midwich Cuckoos. If that novel doesn’t sound familiar, this is the novel that inspired the Village of the Damned movies.\n\nDeadline reports that the series is being produced by the broadcast network Sky, and it will be an eight-part series.\n\nThe classic 1957 story centers on the “sleepy English village of Midwich, where a strange sequence of events culminates in the community’s women falling pregnant with alien children with glowing eyes and otherworldly powers.”\n\nThe first Village of the Damned was released in 1960 by MGM Studios and was directed by Wilf Rilla. The second adaptation came in 1995 from director John Carpenter. That version starred Christopher Reeve, Kristie Ally, and Mark Hamill and was set in North Carolina, rather than England.\n\nI’ve always liked this story and have enjoyed both films that were made. It’ll be interesting to see how this series will turn out and how it will dive deeper into the story and characters."
