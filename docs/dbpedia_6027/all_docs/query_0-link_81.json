In contrast to auteur theory, the genre approach highlights film as a popular art form with qualities of mass entertainment and also includes the audience in the equation because genre films must be understood in terms of audience expectations. In effect a genre is a kind of subculture, a set of conventions of narrative, setting, characterisation, imagery, iconography which is shared by those fluent in its ‘language’. This means that a genre is a social construction subject to constant negotiation and reformulation, which is why, of course, a genre is hard to pin down, why a genre’s boundaries are forever shifting.\n\nThe Horror Genre\n\nIn contrast to some other genres, such as lyric poetry, horror is first and foremost a modern genre, one that begins to appear in the 18th century.\n\nThe Gothic Novel\n\nThe earliest examples of the horror genre were the Gothic novels which flourished between 1760-1820, a group of novels primarily produced but also consumed by women.\n\nThe most famous examples are:\n\nHorace Walpole, The Castle of Otranto (1764)\n\nAnn Radcliffe, The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794)\n\nMary Shelley, Frankenstein (1818)\n\nThere has been a great deal of critical debate about the sexual politics of Gothic novels.\n\n1. From its outset the horror genre and readings of it have been concerned with questions of sexuality and gender issues.\n\nThe American Gothic\n\nWhereas English literature excluded horror writers from its canon, the canon of American literature is dominated by them — authors such as Hawthorne, Poe and Melville. Horror writing has not been limited to popular fiction but has been highly influential on a number of different traditions of writing.\n\n2. The horror genre has straddled notions of high and low culture and in the traffic between high and low the innovations in horror may trickle upwards rather than the other way around.\n\nLate Victorian Resurgence of the Horror Genre\n\nThe Gothic novel seems to go into decline after 1820 and the influence of horror shifts to popular theatrical forms. In the late 19th century there is a resurgence of horror fiction with the production of four horror classics:\n\nH.G. Wells, The Island of Dr Moreau (1896)\n\nOscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891)\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886)\n\nBram Stoker, Dracula (1897)\n\nJekyll, Dracula and Frankenstein have been seen as the three central narrative forms of the horror genre. All these texts deal with the theme of doubling and transformation - the body and personality.\n\nGerman Expressionist film\n\nThe first film version of Frankenstein dates from 1910. It was in Germany during the silent period of film that horror began to emerge as a filmic genre. There are a number of classic German horror films of the 1930s which are particularly important for their visual style — above all for the fact that they did not adopt codes of visual naturalism but those of the artistic movement of expressionism\n\n3. Horror in the cinema starts out by rejecting codes of realism and drawing upon techniques of expressionism.\n\nHollywood Horror films of the 1930s\n\nThese were produced almost exclusively by one studio - Universal. These are films that have had a lasting impact; they are also associated with actors such as Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi famous for their portrayals of Frankenstein’s monster and Dracula.\n\nDracula 1931\n\nFrankenstein 1931\n\nBride of Frankenstein 1935\n\n4. Horror films even from the beginning are conscious of their antecedents: there is a sense of tradition which also invites repetition (Frankenstein becomes The Bride of Frankenstein etc). There is a focus on the star.\n\nHollywood Horror films of the 40s\n\nRKO Studios and Val Lewton producer. Often set in the modern world using modern characters, the horrors are personal and intimate and self-consciously stress psychological themes.\n\nJacques Tourneur, Cat People (1942)\n\nI Walked With A Zombie 1943\n\nCurse of the Cat People 1945\n\n5. Horror deals with themes of the body and has a particular power in addressing unconscious fantasies.\n\nFifties Invasion Films\n\nA shift from horror’s dependence on literary antecedents to borrowing from other popular genres in particular science fiction.\n\nThe Thing 1951\n\nInvasion of the Bodysnatchers 1956\n\nThe Creature from the Black Lagoon\n\nThese films emerged during the cold war and the invasion by an alien force which they frequently feature represents American fears of a Russian threat. They are often read as anticommunist but also anti-scientific technocracy.\n\n50s Popular Gothic from the Hammer Studios\n\nA resurgence of interest in the popular gothic from a series of low budget films made in the Hammer Studios in Britain in the late 1950s. Again centred around actors rather than directors: Vincent Price, Christopher Lee.\n\n6. The focus on production values and the role of studios is highlighted in a genre approach in a way that other critical approaches don’t. A genre approach may allow us to re-evaluate periods of filmmaking.\n\nContemporary Horror and Genre Fragmentation\n\nSince the late 60s the major production of the horror genre has been in the B-movie category but it has also been the material of major studio productions (Francis Ford Coppola’s Dracula) and there has been an enormous proliferation of the genre. Some of the variants:\n\n— psychological horror (Psycho)..\n\n— occult films (The Exorcist);\n\n— zombie movies;\n\n— the slasher and splatter subgenres (Texas Chainsaw Massacre);\n\n— body/horror (Werewolf, The Fly); sci-fi horror (Alien);\n\n— even a subgenre invented in New Zealand, Peter Jackson’s splatstick.\n\nPerhaps it would not be exaggerated to say that in the 1980s horror was one of the most important and widely viewed film genres. There has been a sort of self-reflexive, self-annihilating exploding of the genre in the late 80s and early 90s marked by:\n\n- first of all the self-mirroring of much recent horror film, where we find characters watching horror films or these films examine the horrifying consequences of looking at horror;\n\nand secondly the emergence of a camp, self-parodying quality that is a combination of elements of popular culture, slapstick comedy, sometimes a knowing use of high culture.\n\n7. The horror movie genre is caught up with questions of its own genre and medium, it is self reflexive; it is also caught up with issues of the audience, questions of spectator response; and finally it seems focussed around issue of psychoanalysis, the body, gender and sexuality.\n\nGenre features\n\nShift from genre history to genre features. Why do we watch horror movies?\n\nThe return of the repressed theory associated with the critics Robin Wood and Jean-Louis Baudry. The horror movie they argue provides for the release of repressed energies - our darkest thoughts about sadism, masochism, the breaking of norms associated with heterosexuality, incest, cannibalism, the family. In this sense Wood believes that horror is a radical genre, rather than seeing the pleasure of horror as primarily founded in the desire to contain the monster, Wood argues that horror movies elicit our interest in and sympathy for the monster, allow us to play out in a safe fashion being monsters ourselves..\n\nThe role of the spectator. Following the arguments of Carol Clover, the viewing subject of horror movie does not take up a fixed place or gender role, but is free to adopt a number of subject positions regardless of gender. This shifting viewing position encourages the spectator to oscillate between the positions of both victim and monster and in this respect the horror movie sets out to explore masochistic aspects of the gaze.\n\nWho watches horror movies?\n\nThere does not appear to be any clear answer to this question and audience surveys are made even more difficult with the use of home video where the audience is largely hidden from view. However, audiences for the horror genre in descending order of size appear to be the following: young adolescent males; male-female couples in the younger age bracket; a group referred to as rouge males (older men of somewhat dubious distinction possibly dressed in raincoats); adolescent women in groups.\n\nOne thing you will notice about all these audiences is that they are gendered.\n\nWhere does Psycho stand in relation to all of this genre history and identification of the codes and conventions of the horror genre?\n\nDespite the fact that Hitchcock is known as “the master of terror” within popular culture, Psycho was his first real horror film. It is clear that Psycho is the ancestor and antecedent of the slasher subgenre of the horror film. It is full of familiar elements: the killer is a psychotic product of a family; the film plays out a family romance; the victim is a beautiful sexually-active woman; the location is a haunted house, a terrible place; the weapon is a knife not a gun; the attack is filmed and registered from the victim’s point of view and is shocking and sudden it jolts us out of our seats. Hitchcock’s formulation and bringing together of these elements produced a master text and prompted a flood of imitations and a flood of homages.\n\nNarrative functions\n\nIt doesn’t seem to matter whether the monster in a horror movie is a giant sized gorilla, a shark, a blob, a parasitic alien, or a motel attendant as in the case of Psycho they all carry out the same function in terms of the narrative. Horror as a genre can be reduced to a number of standard character functions, conventional elements and standard plots. Look at some of those features.\n\nThe monster\n\nThe monster and sexual difference. The monster disturbs the boundaries of sexual identity. Norman Bates has been described as a mother-fixated would be transexual. The pleasure the genre offers is based on the process of narrative closure by which the horrifying or the monstrous is destroyed or contained. What is radical about Psycho and might been seen as a break or a crucial innovation in terms of the genre is that the horror, the monster, is not presented as a force coming from outside American society but from within the patriarchal family.\n\nThe victim\n\nThe victim was once an adult woman like Marion Crane in Psycho, now she is typically in her teens, a recent suggestion that new victims of horror movies might be children. Marion Crane is first and foremost a sexual transgressor and the first scenes of the film show her in a hotel room after a stolen lunch hour of sex asking her lover to marry her. In the early scenes of the film we watch her dress, in the shower scene we watch her undress. One equation the horror film seems to be making is that of victim=audience.\n\nThe terrible place\n\nThe labyrinth of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the mansion of Norman Bates in Psycho, the weatherboard suburban house of Halloween, the gingerbread house of Creepers. Many of these spaces have at their centre the figure of the mother: Norman Bates dead mother in a rocking chair, the decaying corpse of the grandmother in the Texas Chainsaw mansion, the monstrous mother in Peter Jackson’s Braindead.\n\nWeapons\n\nIt is interesting how guns have no or little role to play in horror movies. The preferred weapons are pre-technological: knives, ice picks, hypodermic needles, pitchforks etc. This allows of course for the silent assault. But when one links these weapons to those of technology found in recent horror movies such as the chainsaw or power drills, a feature they all have in common is that of closeness and tactility.\n\nThe shock effect\n\nHorror works upon a shock effect often heighten by the musical soundtrack. One reason that the famous shower sequence in Psycho has created such commentary is that so very little is actually shown. Only one shot in the forty-four shot sequence of Psycho sequence shows the body being stabbed. The horror lies less in the actual images than in their implications.\n\nThe survivors\n\nThe survivor, the one who encounters the mutilated bodies of her friends, is chased, cornered, wounded and almost always female. Lila (Marion’s sister) in Psycho; Ripley in Alien; Sally in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre; Laurie in Halloween. All these figures exhibit active defense mechanisms, they are intelligent, resourceful, competent, but also tomboyish — often indicated by their masculine sounding names. Clover calls this character “the final girl.”\n\nHITCHCOCK AS AUTEUR\n\nHitchcock’s signature\n\nWith Hitchcock the most obvious place to begin is with the signature appearance of Hitchcock himself in all his films. Generally, if you read the critical material on Hitchcock this is taken as little more than a sort-of in joke or teaser for Hitchcock fans.\n\nRather than just a joke, there are more serious meaning effects that arise from a Hitchcock cameo appearance in a Hitchcock film. Hitchcock authenticates each film, the sight of him reassures us that this is authentic Hitchcock even more than his name in credits at the beginning.\n\nBy appearing in the film itself, by this type of signing, Hitchcock is also introducing something outside the text of the film to the inside, it too becomes part of the film and so its effects must be read as part of the filmtext. Even though Hitchcock always disappears from the frame seconds after he appears textual elements that affect the meaning of the film have been put in motion and cannot be stopped.\n\nHitchcock’s appearances also function along the lines the characterisation of signature as style: they are a sign or another example of his particular style or idiom.\n\nFinally Hitchcock’s appearances are a sort of self-reflexive pointing to the act of representation.\n\nWhen you look at the signature effects, the very position of the director Hitchcock is made undecidable in these films. He is no longer simply the origin, or in total control of the filmtext. If he becomes like a character in the films does he then become simply another textual element inside the film? If so how can he be outside the text and its originator and in control of it if he is also inside?\n\nSo Hitchcock’s playing with the figure of himself is serious and the point is that it is not simply a question of intentionality but rather one of reading the textual dynamics of the film.\n\nNarrative structure\n\nRaymond Bellour claims that Psycho contains two stories slipping one under the other and one into the other. The first is the story of Marion, the other Norman’s story. The murder in Psycho makes a break, a rupture in the film as a result of which it is broken into two separate stories by the removal of its protagonist. The first story is that of Marion Crane up until her death. The second is the story of the investigation of her death by the detective Arbogast and her sister Lila. In the second story the focus of the narration is Norman Bates.\n\nWe might also compare this divided or double structure with other Hitchcock films: North by Northwest also contains two stories, the story of a crime and the story of an investigation; and Marnie also follows a similar underlying pattern. In Marnie and Psycho we have a mother figure who the investigators believe is being shielded and in both films it is the mother’s sexual involvement with another man, not the father, which is at the root of the original trauma. So in an interesting way in these various films by Hitchcock which seem on the surface quite dissimilar in their in type, subject matter and plot we find a common narrative structure which could be extended further to cover other films by Hitchcock.\n\nPsychoanalytic Themes/Structures of seeing\n\n1. Themes associated with eyes.\n\nAt the film’s focal point the film makes use of eyes. The cut from the closeup of water and blood spiralling down the drain to the close up of Marion’s eye with the camera spiralling out from it. We also have the mocking eyes of the dead corpse of Mrs Bates. A literalisation of the theme of seeing and voyeurism.\n\n2. Voyeurism\n\nIn the opening shots of the film we have a roving camera eye that moves over a city it selects one apartment block and tracks in and then selects one window and tracks in again to take us through the window. There is an insistence on seeing as the camera takes us in and makes us see deeper and deeper into things.\n\nThe most obvious and literal reference to voyeurism in the film is to be found just before the shower scene. As soon as Norman returns to his room we learn that he is a Peeping Tom, a voyeur. He has drilled a hole into one of the motel rooms so he can spy on its occupants. Norman’s eye is filmed in extreme close-up drawing attention to the act of voyeurism. A reverse shot shows us that he is watching Marion undressing. Hitchcock is drawing attention to the voyeurism of not just Norman but also of the cinema spectator. Norman’s eye stands in for the director’s eye and in turn our eye too.\n\nThe Shower Scene\n\nThis scene has been singled out as the most horrifying in the film, possibly in the history of cinema. The American critic Frederic Jameson calls it “the most horrific and immediate scene in motion picture history.” As a scene it has probably elicited more comment and generated more shot by shot analysis from a technical point of view than any other scene in cinema history.\n\nNot surprisingly it has generated a number of conflicting interpretations:\n\n1. The shower scene has been interpreted as representative of the desire of the mother to eliminate Marion as a dangerous rival. This is the argument given by the psychiatrist at the end of the film.\n\n2. There is the argument that the stabbing is a symbolic form of rape enacted by Norman.\n\n3. Various critics have suggested that Marion is punished because of the pleasure she is enjoying and exhibiting.\n\n4. Then there are those who argue that the shower scene awakens our unconscious fears of the mother as parental castrator. Again Psycho is exemplary of this structure — it acts as a sort of master text. In terms of the narrative of the film there are two stories — Marion’s story and Norman’s story; we might see the mother’s story as a third story that is used to fill in and connect the other two.\n\n5. Some feminist critics have pointed out however the shower scene doesn’t necessarily work like this, and that it has made decades of female viewers fear drawing their own shower curtains across. Tania Modleski has noted that the sexism in this scene is almost never discussed by critics. Modleski written convincingly in general terms on Hitchcock’s misogynist treatment of women and his homophobia.\n\n3. Shifting identification.\n\nWe identify and unite ourselves with the two major characters in the film. Our identification with Marion occurs in the opening sequence. We side with her in the dispute between the lovers. Each character is then presented through Marion’s eyes. The shower murder brutally breaks that identification and we attach ourselves and our gaze to Norman Bates.\n\n4. Themes of Mirroring\n\nThe mirroring of Mother’s face over Norman’s, a hallucinatory level of identification. The scene where Marion and Norman are face to face in the reception room of the hotel, the dialogue is organised according to shot/reverse shot. The mirroring of the sisters but also the mirroring of ‘lookalike’ Norman and Sam (Marion’s lover) in their confrontation across the counter in the motel office.\n\nWhat I have tried to do here is weave together two different approaches to the film: a genre approach that has looked at it in terms of the development and conventions of the broader features of genre and an auteur approach focussed in on the individual aspects of the director and how the film might reflect his world view, how he has structured and thematised his text. I would stress that I see both approaches as equally valid and as we have seen at times they coincide and can be used to illuminate each other.\n\nFOCUS ON A GENRE: THE HORROR FILM\n\nBackground Reading\n\n‘Body/Horror’, A Special Issue of Screen, vol. 27, Jan-Feb 1986.\n\nIvan Butler, Horror in the Cinema (London: Zwemmer, 1970).\n\nNoel Carroll, The Philosophy of Horror or Paradoxes of the Heart (New York: Routledge, 1990).
