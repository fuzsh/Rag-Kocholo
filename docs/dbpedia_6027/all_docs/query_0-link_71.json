        "text": "Fellow Svengoolie SvenPals everywhere will jump for joy for his upcoming big broadcast of a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer classic sci-fi thriller/horror masterpiece.\n\n“Svengoolie” presents his big broadcast of “Village of the Damned” (1960)\n\nThe legendary Berwyn/Chicago-based sci-fi/horror/thriller film host will present his big broadcast of “Village of the Damned” (1960), this Sat.; March 28 at 8 p.m. Eastern/7 p.m. Central on Me-TV.\n\n“Village of the Damned” (1960) was directed by Wolf Rilla and was produced by Ronald Kinnoch. Adapted from John Wyndham/John Harris’ novel, “The Midwich Cuckoos;” both Rilla and Kinnoch (the producer’s screenwriting credit was credited to his pseudonym name of George Barclay) also co-wrote the screenplay adaptation of the Wyndham/Harris novelization with veteran screenwriter Stirling Silliphant (Silliphant also created two popular television mystery dramas for Columbia Pictures/Screen Gems, the TV adaptation of “Naked City” from 1958-63 and “Route 66” from 1960-64).\n\n35 years after the original theatrical release of Wolf Rilla’s MGM production of “Village of the Damned” (1960), veteran writer/director John Carpenter directed his own re-make of “Village of the Damned” (1995) for Universal Studios with Christopher Reeve (of “Superman” fame), Mark Hamill (of “Star Wars” fame), Kirstie Alley (of “Cheers” fame), Trishalee Hardy, Jessye Quarry and Cody Dorkin.\n\nThis will mark Sven’s second big coast-to-coast broadcast of Rilla’s 1960 MGM classic sci-fi thriller masterpiece on Me-TV. He previously showcased “Village of the Damned” (1960) as a big coast-to-coast Me-TV premiere broadcast back in Aug. 2019.\n\nSven previously aired “Village of the Damned” (1960) for his Berwyn/Chicago big broadcast on his hometown television station in Berwyn/Chicago, WCIU-TV 26/”The U”* back in back in Oct. 1995, according to details from the official YouTube site of fellow super SvenPal David Fuentes and information from IMDB.\n\nWho was in Wolf Rilla’s MGM production of “Village of the Damned” (1960)?\n\nThe players who appeared in the 1960 Wolf Rilla-MGM sci-fi thriller production were George Sanders (as Gordon Zellaby; some of Sanders’ best-known screen roles include his role of Simon Templar in the 1939–41 RKO Radio Pictures feature film adaptation series of Leslie Charteris’ “The Saint;” the title role of Gay Lawrence in RKO’s 1941–42 post-“Saint” screen adaptation series of Michael Arlen’s “The Falcon” and his Academy Award-winning role of Addison DeWitt in Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s smash 1950 Twentieth Century Fox/Twentieth Century Studios screen drama with Bette Davis, “All About Eve”), Barbara Shelley (as Anthea Zellaby, Shelley was known for her various British screen horror roles, including her characterization of Carla Hoffman in Terence Fisher’s 1964 Hammer/Columbia monster classic with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, “The Gorgon”), Martin Stephens (as David Zellaby, Stephens previously appeared with George Sanders in Guy Hamilton’s 1960 Paramount comedy with James Mason and Vera Miles, “A Touch of Larceny;” Stephens later appeared in Jack Clayton’s 1961 Twentieth Century Fox/Twentieth Century Studios thriller with Deborah Kerr; “The Innocents;” ), Thomas Heathcote (as James Pawle), Charlotte Mitchell (as Janet Pawle), Michael Gwynn (as Maj. Alan Bernard; Gwynn previously appeared in Fisher’s 1958 Columbia-Hammer monster classic with Cushing, “The Revenge of Frankenstein” and later appeared in the guest role of Lord Melbury in the 1975 pilot episode of John Cleese’s BBC hotel comedy series, “Fawlty Towers”), Laurence Naismith (as Dr. Willers), Richard Vernon (as Sir Edgar Hargraves), John Phillips (as Gen. Leighton), Richard Warner (as Harrington), Sarah Long (as Evelyn Harrington), Jenny Laird (as Mrs. Harrington), Pamela Buck (as Milly Hughes), Susan Richards (as Mrs. Plumpton) and Rosamund Greenwood (as Ms. Ogle).\n\nOriginal considerations for the role of Gordon Zellaby in “Village of the Damned”\n\nAccording to additional details from IMDB, veteran actor Glenn Ford was originally chosen to play the role of Gordon Zellaby in Wolf Rilla’s MGM production of “Village of the Damned.” Filming of “Village of the Damned” was originally slated to begin in the United States at the insistence of Stirling Silliphant in 1957, yet Ford had commitments to other MGM feature productions at the time. Veteran actor Ronald Colman was also considered for the role of Gordon Zellaby, but was unable to due to his health; Colman died in 1958.\n\nAfter George Sanders was chosen for the role of Gordon Zellaby, production of “Village of the Damned” was filmed on location in the village of Letchmore Heath, England; according to the American Film Institute.\n\nMGM’s 1960 promotional tie-ins for “Village of the Damned”\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s publicity department had several promotional tie-ins for exhibitors for the 1960 theatrical release of “Village of the Damned.” According to additional information from IMDB, a “beautiful eyes” contest was held where theatergoers had to guess different “mystery staring eye” photos of celebrities. If the contestant got all 12 answers correctly, a U.S. Savings Bond with complimentary theater tickets were awarded to the winner.\n\nAccording to the Oct. 1960 edition of Motion Picture Daily, MGM arranged another promotional tie-in for “Village of the Damned” with famed magician and mentalist Joseph “The Amazing” Dunninger. The magician visited 200 theaters throughout his tour for “Village of the Damned” and made numerous TV and radio appearances promoting Wolf Rilla’s MGM thriller feature throughout his visits to Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia.\n\nMGM’s 1963 sequel to “Village of the Damned”\n\n***THEATRICAL TRAILER ADVISORY: Viewer discretion is advised.***\n\nFour years after the success of “Village of the Damned,” Anton M.
