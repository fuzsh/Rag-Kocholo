        "text": "This was a very hard month for me. For perhaps the first time since I started doing monthly movie-watching themes, I actually watched a substantial amount of films that fit the theme in relation to what I watched that did not. But why – why – did these stars choose to align on the month that I chose to devote specifically to bad movies? Indeed, I watched a large mess of material this month – with particular emphasis on mess. In general, I tend to watch a lot of TV and movies that pertain very particular to my own interests; therefore, sometimes I fall into patterns where I enjoy pretty much everything I watch. Since I believe that any appreciation of art should come with its own challenges, I decided to embark upon a journey of watching as many expectedly-bad films as I could, partially in an attempt to fully realize my personal tastes.\n\nWhile I did watch a few movies considered milestones in the “bad movie” subculture of cinephiledom, I also watched a whole bunch of trash that I had previously promised myself that I would never watch for my own sake. On the other hand, there were also a few films that, though often included among lists of the worst movies of all time (some even declared terrible by personal acquaintances), I didn’t think were all that horrendous in the end. And really, this was my end goal for this month in the first place: seeking out those hidden gems that maybe, just maybe, deserved a second chance. Of course, I didn’t find as many of them as I had hoped, but everyone’s got to start somewhere. This month, I watched a couple of films from M. Night Shyamalan: The Village and The Last Airbender. Previously, I had only ever seen The Sixth Sense from the filmmaker, along with various clips from some of his other films that video bloggers and general internet users implement in order to emphasize how bad his movies are. It could be argued that his name is up there with Edward D. Wood’s, in that both are considered among the worst – if not the worst – filmmakers of all time. My opinion? After venturing past the one film that most people consider his best, I think the hate toward Shyamalan is a bit misplaced, perhaps unfairly so. The Village has, for the most part, gotten mixed reviews and is relatively more acclaimed than his most notoriously bad flicks. I personally didn’t enjoy it, but I can see how others would. The worst one could say about it is that its narrative is uninteresting, bland, and not helped by its otherwise decent twist ending (also, Adrien Brody). The Last Airbender is definitely the worst of his I’ve seen, with poor acting, incomprehensible storylines, and an aesthetic that seems to generally suck the life out of its seemingly charming source material (although I’ve never seen the show). Once again, however, this is really the worst you can say about it. It’s not even the worst film of its year, let alone worst of the decade. Sure Shyamalan has proven time and time again that his genre pictures turn out rather silly, but there are hundreds of terrible horror, thriller, and sci-fi churned out every year. Picking on him because he’s got such high prestige (one of the only Indian directors in the US who does, by the way) simply comes off as misguided and it’s just one bandwagon within the film community I simply don’t get.\n\nThe other is the relatively recent appreciation for Michael Bay, whom I will set here as a counterpoint. This month, I watched his first Transformers film; previously, I had watched Pearl Harbor and Pain & Gain. After this month, honestly, I think I’m officially done with Michael Bay. I am literally unable to appreciate his juvenile, hypermasculine approaches to the types of films in which I have to push myself to become involved in the first place. Pearl Harbor could have even been halfway decent if it wasn’t so painfully boring. Yet Transformers isn’t just tiresome; it’s also blatantly misogynist and racist, in ways that I could only imagine twelve-year-old boys finding merit in. Yes, I actually enjoyed Pain & Gain when I watched it about a year ago, but that was mainly for its sharp, satirical edge and humorous performances from its cast (notably Dwayne Johnson). I’ve yet to uncover even a fraction of such strength in any other part of his filmography. Despite such advantages, his style is still cinematic trash and it astounds me that there are a rising group of movie-lovers who have come to defend the artistic merit of Bay’s films. Whew. I’m really not sure where that huge Shyamalan/Bay rant came from, but it does feel good actually writing it down. I don’t particularly wish to dwell on the negative in my blog, so I really don’t want to focus on the films that turned out to be just as terrible as I expected. Moreover, it probably wouldn’t benefit anyone for me to make a top 5 worst films I watched this past month, as it’ll be full of obvious picks that most people wouldn’t consider watching in the first place. I’ll just say that you should probably avoid the following films at all costs: Sharknado, The Nutty Professor, Jack and Jill, Transformers, Battlefield Earth, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, License to Drive. While some of the films I watched were ones I ended up disliking, I find these particular ones to have little to no redeeming qualities whatsoever. On a side note, I didn’t even initially plan on watching License to Drive for bad movie month – it’s just really terrible and no one should have to watch it.\n\nWith that being said, there are others that managed to stumble somewhere between trash and treasure while still unanimously being a “bad” movie. While Deep Blue Sea was certainly dated in many ways, I would be lying if I said I had at least somewhat of a good time watching it (I particularly recommend it for LL Cool J alone). It certainly was more charming than the very similar Anaconda, which I also recently watched for the first time. Secondly, I can’t really see the sequel to The Princess Diaries winning over many of the fans of the first film (which I personally have always enjoyed). Nonetheless, it’s pretty fun in its own right – at the very least, it contains a great all-ladies slumber party scene which coalesces into this brief, wonderful moment. I also rewatched the live-action/CGI clusterfuck Scooby-Doo for the first time in about nine years, and as a probably ridiculously unpopular opinion, I didn’t think it was all that bad. Yes, the plot is most likely too convoluted and weird for its own good, but its combination of sight gags and self-aware humor provided at least some substance to the final product. Considering that it was written by known fanboy James Gunn, this shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise. Finally, although The Beautician and the Beast has a ridiculously low rating on Rotten Tomatoes, I actually found it genuinely charming and a totally worthwhile watch. Then again, this is coming from someone who is a fan of both rom-coms and Fran Drescher, so perhaps this is an acquired taste.\n\nA particularly interesting sidenote is that I coincidentally watched three separate films this month that featured antagonistic sharks: Deep Blue Sea, Sharknado, and Kon-Tiki. These were all made several decades after Jaws, which is evidence that the general public still carries a deep-rooted fear of the aquatic creatures and probably always will. Besides all these bad movies, I also watched a good number of films that I didn’t plan for my bad movie month, but the most notable ones will be covered in my top 5 for the month. Here is the complete list of films I watched this month (asterisks indicate rewatches):\n\nPink Flamingos (Waters, 1972)*\n\nDeep Blue Sea (Harlin, 1999)\n\nSharknado (Ferrante, 2013)\n\nFrogs (McCowan, 1972)\n\nThe Village (Shyamalan, 2004)\n\nSaved!

This makes sense, of course, considering that I’m also trying to complete my Billboard Hot 100 challenge, which is eating up a lot more of my free time than I was expecting. This is on top of my decision to watch the entirety of Dragonball Z, with which I’m already one-third finished! In addition to all of this, I started watching Steven Universe in April, which is surprisingly super charming, beautiful, women-centric, and basically everything I could ever ask for in a cartoon. I almost have to hold myself back from devoting the entirety of my free time on this show, but with imagery such as this and this, it’s damned near impossible. So basically, if you get anything out of this blog post, let it be known that ’tis better to watch Steven Universe than shit cinema.\n\nNow that I’ve got all that out of the way, here’s my top five films I watched this past month. 5) The Warriors.\n\nDuring my first-time watch of this cult classic, I was utterly confused of what to make of it. Its old-timey misogyny really exemplifies some of the most distressing aspects of this era’s media representation. Yet at the same time, its focus on the invisible outcasts of the inner city makes for a story that is hard for me not to appreciate. Overall, more than anything else, the music is great and its campy aesthetic is to die for. I still can’t decide which of the gangs’ choice of outfits I prefer the most, but I think my vote goes for Mr. Overalls and Roller Skates. 4) Itty Bitty Titty Committee.\n\nWhile I was generally unfazed by …But I’m a Cheerleader (given that it has been a few years since I watched it), this film really won me over for Jamie Babbit. Sure, its political edge often unfortunately highlights the the more problematic facets of radical feminism, including its cissexism. On the other hand, its story is charming and rightfully subversive; inevitably, I found myself crushing on practically everyone (especially Melonie Diaz, who is such an underrated actress). We need more films about queer punk babes being friends, lovers, and overall challenging oppressive structures with DIY mantras and bad attitudes. 3) Pink Flamingos.\n\nI have a confession to make: before I rewatched Pink Flamingos at the beginning of the month, it was easily my least favorite John Waters film. After undergoing (enduring?) this experience once more, however, I can confidently state that there really is nothing else like it. Hilariously gross and successfully provocative, it captures the sheer essence of grotesque, trash cinema in ways of which other films have only begun to scratch the surface. Although I still hold the opinion that Female Trouble is his strongest film, the beautiful mess that Waters plants upon the screen in Pink Flamingos is still some of the most subversive stuff of all time. 2) Girlhood.\n\nCeline Sciamma cannot be touched. She has such a distinct flair for her stories about maturing young people, seen as she delicately approaches the topics of lesbianism and transgender identities in Water Lilies and Tomboy, respectively. Girlhood, her latest, is certainly no exception. The use of nonprofessional actors was a great decision, as the story of her protagonist feels all the more genuine, approachable, and sympathizing. Every scene of this film bursts to life with strong, beautiful, young Black women, whose mere presence in the narrative is so, so important. Overall, as grim as Girlhood may be, it values the invaluable power of female friendship amongst hard times. This is probably most explicit in the “Diamonds” scene, which is my favorite scene in any 2015 film thus far. 1) Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem.\n\nSeeing as I’ve recently became more serious about music these days, perhaps it’s fitting that Interstella 5555 would be my favorite thing that I watched all month. After all, it’s essentially little more than a prolonged video following a concept that probably didn’t exist upon the corresponding album’s original intentions. Nonetheless, it’s terrific. It combines two of my most recent favorite things – Japanese animation and Daft Punk’s Discovery – with absolute precision and compelling emotion. The artwork is absolutely astounding, and while the story isn’t really much to write home about, the methods the animators took to make sure it matched up to the music is certainly worth appreciating. More than anything, I think, it’s an excuse for me to listen to Discovery, with the advantage of an accompanying sci-fi narrative about an extraterrestrial band who gets sent to Earth to work for evil music executives. How could I complain about that? In March, I read B. Ruby Rich’s New Queer Cinema and was introduced to an array of titles from the late 80s to early 90s that worked to define this cinematic movement. I’d really like to watch as many of these titles as possible, while the ideas and concepts presented in the book are still fresh in my mind. Therefore, May’s theme will be devoted to LGBT films and filmmakers that would fall into this category. I hope during this time I could finally get around to films and filmmakers that are prestigious within this subculture yet relatively unknown on a larger scale – films like High Art and The Watermelon Woman, filmmakers like Todd Haynes and Derek Jarman. I expect to discover an eclectic blend of genres and quality tied together by this unifying, rainbow thread – and something tells me that I’m not bound to be disappointed.\n\nContinuing along with my journey through every one of Billboard’s Hot 100 lists, I’ll move along with the Hot 100 of 1958. In terms of quality, this matches up on pretty much an equal level as the 1957 list – there were a good number I loved, a like number I hated, and a bunch more dwelling somewhere in between. Overall, 1958 was a pretty strange year for music. While the previous year featured many rock ‘n’ pioneers at the height of their careers, this year saw many of them start to briefly fall off the face of the mainstream. Elvis Presley was drafted off to the Army at the early part of the year, yet still managed to gather a good amount of influence in the year-end Hot 100. Chuck Berry also had two rather iconic entries in the list – “Johnny B. Goode” (#73) and “Sweet Little Sixteen” (#29) – but would face arrest near the end of the year. Likewise, Jerry Lee Lewis, despite facing certain controversies of his own, still nabbed two spots of his own with “Breathless” (#95) and “Great Balls of Fire” (#36). On the other side of things, 1958 was the year that Little Richard denounced rock ‘n’ roll, eventually leaving the music industry altogether. As such, his talent was nowhere to be found in the ’58 list.\n\nWith so much happening in the world of rock ‘n’ roll outside of the actual music itself, there were many more additions of doo-wop and basic pop music in this year’s list, along with some other weird novelty stuff. True, Elvis still leads the pack with five entries, but none of them really stand out as particularly memorable; possible exceptions going toward “I Got Stung” (#65) and “Hard Headed Woman” (#49), although I much prefer Wanda Jackson’s cover of the latter. Second place in quantity is a three-way tie between The Everly Brothers, Pat Boone, and Ricky Nelson, each with four songs. I already went over my newfound love for The Everly Brothers and my newfound hatred for Pat Boone, so I won’t spend too much time on them. At this point, Ricky Nelson is no newbie to the Hot 100, as he had a couple songs in the 1957 list. However, all four of his songs on this list are very strong and carve out their own unique identities in their own ways. From the peppy wholesomeness of “I Got A Feeling” (#67), to the melancholy simplicity of “Lonesome Town” (#53), to “Stood Up” (#16) which meanders somewhere in between, such entries are definitive of why he’s my favorite of the 50s teen idols.\n\nOf course, since this is a feminism-driven blog, it’s probably important to look at how women fit into this list. Altogether, the 1958 Hot 100 includes works from twenty-one women across nine entries. This is only slightly better than the 1957 list – which includes seventeen women across twelve entries – but to put things into perspective, this list features 130 men across ninety-five entries (some songs feature both men and women, which explains the overlap). Of course, I didn’t take certain aspects into account, such as backup bands or singers, but rather who the song is specifically credited toward; nonetheless, it wouldn’t be unrealistic to presume that the tally for men on the chart are probably much higher. The highest ranking song on this list not by a man is “Sugartime” from The McGuire Sisters at #26, once again demonstrating a year where women don’t seem worthy enough to crack into the top ten of a given year. I really can’t wait until these numbers start to change, because so far this has only proven the hard fact that the music industry is unwelcoming to ladies.\n\n(On a side note, I may be showing my age here, but if any other millennials feel a sense of nostalgia over the tune to “Sugartime”, there’s a reason. In the late 90s, Bagel Bites used an uptempo cover of the song with changed lyrics to promote their product in TV commercials. Boy, was my mind blown upon hearing the original for the first time!)\n\nA weird trend that I’ve noticed beginning with this year specifically is the introduction of novelty songs into the mix. Wikipedia defines “novelty song” as “a comical or nonsensical song, performed principally for its comical effect”, which “may apply to a current event such as a holiday or a fad such as a dance”. Given the fact that the Hot 100 measures album sales, radio airplay, and overall popularity of particular songs, it’s always interesting when novelty music charts high enough to make it on the year-end list. There are about six songs from 1958’s list that would qualify as novelty songs, including The Playmates’ “Beep, Beep” (#60), Lou Monte’s “Lazy Mary” (#80), The Royal Teens’ “Short Shorts” (#35), and Sheb Wooley’s “Purple People Eater” (#12).\n\nOf course, the concept of a novelty song is so vaguely defined that it often becomes difficult to completely discern whether a song is indeed novelty or just happens to have a sense of humor in its lyrics. This is how I feel about The Coasters’ “Yakety Yak” (#21), which is certainly a funny song, but also legitimate in its artistic prowess. Yes, the lyrics essentially detail the plights of a suburban teenager who doesn’t want to do their chores (If you don’t scrub that kitchen floor / You ain’t gonna rock and roll no more), but with this logic would that also make The Silhouettes’ “Get a Job” (#14) a novelty song as well (After breakfast every day / she throws the ‘wanted’ ads right my way / And never fails to say / Get a job)? I also theorize that one vital attribute of novelty music is the aspect of one-hit-wonder-dom, which certainly isn’t true of The Coasters – they even had two songs making previous appearances on the ’57 Hot 100. Of course, this theory is blown completely away once “Weird Al” Yankovic enters the scene, but we’re a few decades ahead of ourselves.\n\nThere were a good number of instrumental hits on this list as well. Instrumental tracks were found on the 1957 Hot 100 as well, but only a total of two songs across four entries (two songs were originals, two songs covers). In the ’58 list, however, this number blew up with a total of nine instrumental songs. Most of these are jazz and orchestral tracks, such as Tommy Dorsey Orchestra’s “Tea For Two Cha-Cha” (#33), Billy Vaughn’s “Sail Along Silvery Moon” (#6), and even the theme music for The Bridge on the River Kwai, Mitch Miller’s “March From the River Kwai and Colonel Bogey March” (#61). While last year’s “Raunchy” earns the title of the first instrumental rock hit to chart, this year’s list features three purely instrumental rock tracks. They are The Royaltones’ “Poor Boy” (#97), Duane Eddy’s “Rebel ‘Rouser” (#46), and The Champs’ “Tequila” (#8).\n\nWhat really surprised me in this category was the strange lack of Link Wray, who is considered one of the most important in instrumental rock ‘n’ roll. He charted pretty highly this year with both “Rumble” and its B-side “The Swag”, both of which are considered fairly important tracks to instrumental rock scene even today. However, at the end of the day the Billboard charts are all a game of numbers which, unfortunately, happened to not work out in Mr. Wray’s favor.\n\nOne reason I decided to take on this Hot 100 challenge in the first place was to gain a wider perspective of the cultural influence that these songs and artists may possess in the wider scope of things. One of the most interesting songs I’ve researched thus far is Domenico Modugno’s “Volare”, which takes the #1 spot this year. “Volare” is actually the moniker that it’s most well-known by to non-Italian audiences, the actual song title being “Nel blue dipinto di blu”. Originally an entry in 1958’s Eurovision competition – and subsequently becoming one of the most popular Eurovision songs of all time – it is generally understood as a song hugely important in changing the landscape of Italian pop music. It was essentially the introduction of the Italian music scene to international listeners and Modugno is widely considered an important figure in the country’s transition from tradition to modernity. I was not previously unfamiliar with “Volare” by any means; however, its enormous popularity and cultural significance is something of which I was certainly previously unaware. Because of this, I can finally appreciate this beautiful melody so much more than ever before.\n\nSince I am an avid taker of notes, yet also still trying to find ways to efficiently organize them, here are a few short, collected points that I want to add before I move on to my top choices of the year\n\nFrankie Avalon, widely considered one of the bigger teen idols of this era, makes a good three appearances on this list, with “Ginger Bread” (#100), “I’ll Wait For You” (#99), and “De De Dinah” (#86). While I’m not as repulsed by him as much as I am by Pat Boone, I am not a fan of his. I don’t particularly hate him though… although I can’t get past his dastardly nasal voice.\n\nHooray, Johnny Cash is in the Hot 100! Although, it’s not particularly the kind of Cash I’m used to listening to. The lyrics to “Ballad of a Teenage Queen” (#81) are practically indiscernible from much of the other cool pop music in the list (all the world was at her door / all except the boy next door / who worked at the candy store), yet with his dark smoky voice, it still somehow feels like a Cash song to the core.\n\nA weird trend that started this year in charts: Christian music. There isn’t a whole much, but Pat Boone’s “A Wonderful Time Up There” (#24) as well as Laurie London’s rendition of “He’s Got the Whole World in His Hands” (#17) are relatively jarring placed next to the rest of the secular music in the Hot 100. This also ties in with the then-new popularity of Christmas pop music around the latter part of the year, none of which made the year-end list. As I mentioned before, it was a pretty strange year in rock ‘n’ roll; perhaps the music landscape opted for more conservatism at least for a little while.\n\nDanny & the Juniors’ “At the Hop” (#20) is a fun song and all, but it’s also the epitome of what I usually connect with the term “white people music”.\n\nJust an observation: the 1958 Hot 100 contains two songs from Buddy Holly & the Crickets (“Peggy Sue” (#50) and “Oh Boy” (#71)), one from The Big Bopper (“Chantilly Lace” (#52)), yet not a single one from Ritchie Valens. True, the only thing they all truly have in common is their tragic deaths in the early ’59 plane crash, yet the impact of Valens in the Latino community (particularly his reworking of “La Bamba”) is tremendously important. Once again, however, the Billboard charts are little more than a game of numbers, one which sadly continues to marginalize such communities.\n\nFinally, without further ado, here are my choices for top six of 1958’s year-end Hot 100. Yes, you read correctly – I had such a difficult time narrowing it down to only five, I’m giving you guys my top six this time!\n\n6) “Witch Doctor” (#4)\n\nLong before modern-day Hollywood decided to forever bastardize the name of the Chipmunks, David Seville tampered with his own vocal recordings to create a unique high-pitched voice all his own. The resulting song, “Witch Doctor” is one of the catchiest songs to come out of 1958. Out of the relatively large amount of novelty songs released this year, this one is probably the best; as I loved it as a child, it is also the one I hold the nearest to my heart.\n\n5) “Lollipop” (#37)\n\nOne would be hard-pressed to find another female vocal group that harmonizes as well and with as much young happiness as The Chordettes at their finest. This song and “Mr. Sandman” proves that these four ladies sure had some talent for carries melodies that are absolutely infectious. Apart from its catchy chorus, the lyrics capture the joy and rapture of young love in ways where other artists could’ve easily dwelled into artificiality and fallen flat. Good luck getting this one out of your head today.\n\n4) “Maybe” (#89)\n\nRight after The Bobettes, The Chantels were the second all-Black girl group to find success in the US charts. “Maybe” is a simple song – as many slow ballads of these days are – but the one aspect that sets it apart from the others lies in Arlene Smith’s soaring, heartbreaking vocals. It’s a punch to the emotions that refuses to ease up from start to finish. Accompanied by a smooth piano hook and lovely backing vocals from the rest of the Chantels, it’s hard not to be wooed by this melody.\n\n3) “Yakety Yak” (#21)\n\n“Take out the papers and the trash!” From that opening line, I was completely hooked and I haven’t stopped listening since. The Coasters are absolute pros at combining clean vocal harmonies with quick-paced, soul-infused saxophone kicks. As I mentioned before, I’m not too sure I completely buy this as a novelty song – its subject matter is humorous, sure, but humor should always be welcome into the realm of popular music and still remain legitimized by its artistic qualities. No one knows carries this candle better than The Coasters.\n\n2) “All I Have To Do Is Dream” (#2)\n\nIt seems that my love for The Everly Brothers continues into 1958. They have a few more songs on this chart, though I can’t say I’m a very huge fan of “Bird Dog” (#13) , “Problems” (#62), or “Devoted to You” (#88). This song, however, captures everything I appreciate about love songs that just happen to hit me right where it matters. On an additional note, this is a really great song to listen to when you’re missing someone you love really much and wish they were right next to you, listening to the song with you. In other words, the placement of this song may change over time; for now, however, it feels so right.\n\n1) “Tequila” (#8)\n\nAs someone who really hates tequila, I really love “Tequila”. It’s probably evident by now that a song automatically achieves a heightened importance for me once it’s used in a movie I really like. It’s also pretty obvious that Latino representation in media is really important to me. Overall, however, I just really like fun music that I can dance to, no matter the time of day. It just so happens that “Tequila” fits all of these prerequisites perfectly. It’s probably one of the more quirkier non-novelty tracks on the 1958 Hot 100, yet never obnoxiously so. With its smooth, sexy, Cuban-fused beat, tied together by a killer saxophone riff and complete with the single utterance of that infamous word, it’s easy to see that the game has been won.\n\nNote: As a bit of a change (one of the many I’ve had on this site), I’ve decided to broaden the perspective of this blog a little bit. Instead of being strictly about film, I’m also going to incorporate some overviews of music I’m listening to, books I’m reading, or TV I’m watching. As it stands, movies are still the biggest part of my life, but I think honing my skills on writing about other forms of media could only be beneficial. This first post will be about Billboard magazine’s Hot 100 songs of 1957.\n\nAs the above introduction implies, I am embarking on new personal challenge. In an attempt to get a somewhat good snapshot of popular music from the past fifty years or so, I want to try to listen to every song of the Billboard Hot 100 for each year since its conception – every year from 1957 until 2014. Yes that’s right – I’ll be listening to 5,700 songs overall, many of which will be first-time listens for me. For each list I complete, moreover, I want to write up a post covering some of the best songs, worst songs, and generally notable songs of that particular year. In tradition with the film-related posts that I have made in the past, I’ll go over some worthwhile highlights from the list, ending with my personal top five overall. I would love to go over every single song from the year, but that would simply eat up all my free time that I simply don’t possess. Also, at least for this year, there are a bunch of songs that would be difficult for me to write anything of worth about, simply because I don’t care for them at all. Finally, I’m not going to pretend that I know very much about music as a whole (I have a lot of informational gaps, especially in comparison to actual music critics), so I’m sure that I’ll make some factual errors along the way.\n\nObviously, I’ll start by covering Billboard’s Hot 100 of 1957.\n\nThe musical climate of pop music from 1957 – if this chart is any indicator – seems to be mainly composed of classic rock ‘n’ roll and country music, with the occasional doo-wop and R&B artist. In any matter, the vast majority of these songs ran at under three minutes long, making its listen-through a relative breeze. I was pleased to see that some of my favorite musicians were present on this year’s list: Chuck Berry, Little Richard, LaVern Baker, and Fats Domino, among others (although I’m saddened to see that “Lucille”, one of my favorite 50s songs, didn’t make the list).\n\nAs a whole, it’s not a bad list at all. While I certainly didn’t love most of what I listened to, I also didn’t outright hate much of it either. I will say, however, that I tend to be really picky when it comes to country music; therefore, I wasn’t too hot with the entries by Ferlin Husky, Jim Reeves, and Patti Page. A little less surprising, however, was the male dominance that rears its head. This list only contains seventeen women across twelve entries out of 100, the highest ranking song by a woman being Debbie Reynolds’ “Tammy” at #12. It’s no news to me that the music scene – especially in rock music – has always been a boys’ playing field, but actually applying numbers to this disproportion is always disheartening. Here’s to hoping this improves somewhat in later lists!\n\nJust a year prior to this list, Elvis Presley had premiered into the American landscape, forever shaking up the visibility of rock ‘n’ roll within the public eye. 1957, therefore, continues this trend; in fact, it seems that was the year of Elvis and Pat Boone. Elvis had six songs in the Hot 100 of that year, while Pat had five. They also each have two songs each in the top ten, both of them occupying the top two spots. There’s no doubt that they were pretty huge stars in their day, but I would argue that Elvis’ music holds up the best. While I can’t say that I’m the biggest fan of Elvis (his entries “Too Much” (#9) and “Loving You” (#98) are rather boring), there’s no denying infectious catchiness of “Jailhouse Rock” (#16) and “All Shook Up” (the #1 single of 1957). However, to this date, there hasn’t been a single Pat Boone song that didn’t take a painful effort to get through, checking the time marker every few seconds to see how much time I had to endure in the song. This includes all five of his entries on this list – in particular, “Remember You’re Mine” (#88) and “Don’t Forbid Me” (#6) are simply borderline creepy. His #2 entry, “Love Letters in the Sand” isn’t particularly terrible, however. Still, I can’t see myself getting into that fellow anytime soon at all.\n\nAnother interesting note for this year is that there were many duplicates on the list – two entries of the same song covered by two separate artists. These entries include “Raunchy” (Ernie Freeman (#86) and Bill Justis (#55)), “Dark Moon” (Bonnie Guitar (#77) and Gale Storm (#29)), “Around the World” (Victor Young (#75) and Mantovani (#65)), “Marianne” (The Hilltoppers (#68) and The Easy Riders (#37)), “Butterfly” (Andy Williams (#36) and Charlie Gracie (#31)), and “The Banana Boat Song” (The Tarriers (#26) and Harry Belafonte (#15)). Many of these entries feature rather unique variations of the regular source material and for me, there was usually one of the two that I preferred much more than the other. “Marianne” is already one of the catchier songs of the 50s calypso craze, but somehow the twangy guitars in The Easy Riders’ cover seems to fit it better than the bongo drums in The Hilltoppers’ version. Moreover, Bill Justis’ rendition of “Raunchy” feels a lot more cleaner and bouncier overall than Ernie Freeman’s, which seems to struggle at finding a sense of true identity for itself. It might also be interesting to note that Justis’ version was the very first rock instrumental hit to chart in the US, surely setting an example for others to come in the future.\n\nOne of my very favorite new discoveries I’ve uncovered from this musical journey so far is Joe Bennett & the Sparkletones and their song “Black Slacks”, which falls right at #100. I haven’t been able to find out very much about this band, besides the fact that they scored a massive hit with “Black Slacks”, yet failed to find any formidable success with any other singles they released during their short existence. In this case, they are a true example of a one-hit wonder. It’s such a shame, because if “Black Slacks” is any indicator, this band must have been really great to watch live. I love rockabilly music and practically any music that incorporates a stand-up bass, so this song was right up my alley. It’s catchy with great lyrics and an infectious chorus unlike anything else I’ve heard from this year. One of my favorite hidden gems I’ve uncovered from the year.\n\nI never realized that I had listened to Mickey & Sylvia’s “Love is Strange” (#78) before, until I pressed play a few days ago. It was featured in one of the most famous scenes of Dirty Dancing, which I had just watched for the first time fairly recently. Other than that, this song and duo has become relatively forgotten, which I think is a bit of a shame. In my personal top 100 of this year, “Love is Strange” would have ranked far higher. Its playful beat, iconic guitar lick, and undeniable chemistry between the two make it probably the sexiest song on this list. And when that final bridge kicks in, it’s everything anyone could ever wish for in a song of this nature. It doesn’t get any more fun than this.\n\nAt this point, I’ll start counting down my top five of the 1957 Hot 100. I was slightly disappointed to find that every song of my top five were ones that I was at least somewhat familiar with prior to starting this Hot 100 challenge. However, that just means that they were all really good songs, and I’ve got a bunch more lists ahead of me either way!\n\nHonorable mentions: “Gonna Get Along Without Ya Now” (#93), “I Like Your Kind of Love” (#76), “Love Me Tender” (#56), “Chances Are” (#39), “Jailhouse Rock” (#16)\n\n5) “Little Bitty Pretty One” (#72)\n\n“Little Bitty Pretty One” may not be the best song of 1957, but you’d be hard-pressed to find one that’s even catchier. Its hook is one that always seems to get stuck in my head after only listening to it one time. And that’s the cool thing about it – there aren’t many people that can claim to know all the words to this song, but once the chorus comes along, everyone can sing, hum, or whistle along. Bobby Day’s and Frankie Lymon’s versions of this song are also quite good, but I hold a personal deep attachment to Thurston Harris’ cover, which is arguably the most popular recording. The fact that this was used brilliantly in Matilda, one of my favorite movies as a kid, also certainly helps its placement on this list.\n\n4) “Blueberry Hill” (#48)\n\nIt’s hard for me to describe exactly what it is I love about “Blueberry Hill”. Could it be the lovely, melancholy lyrics? Fats Domino’s rolling piano riff? His infectiously soulful voice? The best answer would be that the true beauty of the song arises from the perfect combination of all of the above. I’ve heard a few other versions of the song, spanning several decades of influence, but nothing beats the original. Besides its early rock ‘n’ roll charm, I’ve also got an inexplicable attachment to New Orleans jazz (even though I’m relatively unseasoned on the topic) and the music of Fats Domino seems to meld the best of both worlds like no one else could.\n\n3) “Wake Up Little Susie” (#19)\n\nThe extent of my previous experience with The Everly Brothers is always seeing a greatest hits CD of their work sitting near the dashboard of my grandpa’s car. I’d never listened to them before now – but if I had known that if their music was essentially a predecessor of Simon & Garfunkel (whom I love), I would have remedied this years ago. Their highest charting song on the list is “Bye Bye Love” at #11, but I’m partial to “Wake Up Little Susie”, which I haven’t stopped listening to all week. It’s cute, playful, and the story is, for me, essentially one of the more satisfying romanticizations of what it must have been to be a teenager in the 50s.\n\n2) “Jim Dandy” (#94)\n\nIn yet another instance where my love for music crosses paths with my love for film, I was first introduced to Lavern Baker and “Jim Dandy” by John Waters, who included the song in the soundtrack for Pink Flamingos. I’m not gonna lie, my love for this song lies almost exclusively toward the undeniable power of Baker’s voice, which gives this song every bit of energy it requires while everything else plays second fiddle. It almost seems to subvert the “damsel in distress” storyline that the lyrics tell – sure all the women in this narrative are pretty weak, but when the narrator is someone as sharp and fierce as LaVern, it really couldn’t be all bad. Driven by some truly crafty horns and a subtle bouncy background vocalist, it’s hard not to love this song.\n\n1) “Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)” (#15)\n\nAs I said earlier about artists doing unique variations of original source material, I think Harry Belafonte’s version of the traditional Jamaican folk song “The Banana Boat Song” stands as one of the best, at least from this year. It’s also Belafonte’s most well-known single, thanks in part to a little film in which it, once again, helped make one of its most memorable scenes possible (was it Beetle… breakfast?). It’s so much more simple than the other two songs that Belafonte claimed on 1957’s Hot 100, yet its simplicity stands as one of its greatest strengths. There is so much heart and soul placed into what is ultimately a standard call-and-response work song. There’s a reason why it’s considered one of the best of the calypso genre of music: every aspect of it simply sticks as a bonafide example of the genre. Its stripped-down instrumentation means that Belafonte’s voice plays front-and-center here – as it totally should.\n\nAs a closer for this post, I think one of the most interesting facts I’ve discovered is that members of The Tarriers are credited as writers for their version of “The Banana Boat Song”, which has some variation from the Jamaican standard. One of the members? Alan Arkin.\n\nMarch was a very interesting month for me, in film-related ways and otherwise. As I mentioned in another post, I had intended on this being almost solely focused on completing the James Bond franchise. I soon realized that I had bit off a bit more than I could chew; therefore, I focused instead on completing the Bond films of the 60s throughout this month. And complete I did… and you’ll find out what I think about each one in a blog post that should hopefully appear here fairly soon!\n\nI’ve found that I always want some variety in the things I watch month by month. I could never stick to a monthly theme any stricter than as a loose underlying theme, one that works more as a strong suggestion than anything else. While I’ve enjoyed following these topics month by month, it’s really hard for me to follow it very strongly, especially after long work days when I simply don’t feel up for watching anything more than easygoing comedies, cartoons, or the ilk. It’s especially difficult when there’s always new stuff coming out in theaters that I really want to check out. And I don’t think there’s anything wrong with this sense of looseness at all, especially since I expect to upkeep my reputation of being up for watching basically everything under the sun.\n\nOverall, however, this month was successful. I’ve had more time on my hands than usual, so I’ve been particularly friendly toward my Netflix account lately. The lists of what I watch each month have not been as vibrant and unpredictable as when I could afford to go to my favorite independent video store a year or two ago, but I’ve still been able to get a lot of stuff watched. Besides Bond and films I watched in theaters, I’ve also been trying to watch some stuff I should have watched years ago. I watched James Cameron’s Avatar and was thoroughly unimpressed; I also watched Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and, while not enjoying it as much as the first installment, I still really loved it. On top of that, I’ve also been reading a lot of comics (especially manga!), nonfiction, and some novels. Finally, I’ve set up another goal for myself to watch the entirety of Dragonball Z in a month or two – that’s 300 episodes of pure, unadulterated, epic anime funtimes, a lot of which has been filler. Gonna need a lot more vodka for this one…\n\nSo here is the full list of movies that I watched this past month:\n\nThe Great Muppet Caper (Henson, 1981)\n\nMuppet Treasure Island (Henson, 1996)\n\nDr. No (Young, 1962)\n\nShaolin Soccer (Chow, 2001)\n\nGett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem (Elkabetz & Elkabetz, 2015)\n\nLeviathan (Zvyagintsev, 2014)\n\nTeen Witch (Walker, 1989)\n\nFrom Russia With Love (Young, 1963)\n\nGoldfinger (Hamilton, 1964)\n\nThe Loving Story (Buirski, 2011)\n\nRelatoes salvájes (Wild Tales) (Szifron, 2014)\n\nThunderball (Young, 1965)\n\nYou Only Live Twice (Gilbert, 1967)\n\nThe Hunting Ground (Dick, 2015)\n\nThe Invisible War (Dick, 2012)\n\nEntre Nos (La Morte & Mendoza, 2009)\n\nDownloaded (Winter, 2013)\n\nAvatar (Cameron, 2009)\n\nL.I.E.

Nonetheless, here is my best attempt.\n\n5) Wild Tales.\n\nSix delicious tales of revenge and unflinching critique of the upper-middle class make up Wild Tales, which has very quickly become one of my favorites from last year. While some of these stories are certainly better than others (the wedding segment being a particular favorite), they are all very well-made, often hilarious, and certainly worthy of every bit of attention it’s gotten. I’m almost afraid to potentially become disappointed upon rewatch, as the audience I watched this film with was particularly reactive and made the shock value of this film all the more plentiful. I give Wild Tales my highest of recommendations.\n\n4) Sense and Sensibility.\n\nA fanatic of Jane Austen’s novels I am not (with the exception of Jane Eyre). However, while Clueless will always be a personal favorite inspired by an Austen work, Sense and Sensibility may very well be my favorite strict adaptation. Emma Thompson’s screenplay really brings out the best parts of the Dashwoods’ plights into something emotionally fleshed-out and compelling. Kate Winslet and Thompson herself excel marvelously in their roles, and while I never thought I’d give in to Alan Rickman’s charms, I certainly did in this one. This combination of master performances and a lush Austenian atmosphere made this an absolute delight to watch, surely a film I’d love to curl up and live in for a little while (save for its obvious gender restrictions of the British 19th century).\n\n3) Castle in the Sky.\n\nAnd speaking of films inside which I’d like to live… although I suppose that could be said with most Miyazaki flicks. I don’t know why it’s taken me so long to get around to Castle in the Sky. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that I wasn’t very fond of the last Miyazaki film I watched – Nausicaä, which immediately preceded this one. Needless to say, however, my premonitions were incorrect, as this has become one of my very favorites from the filmmaker. I’m sure this isn’t only because of my recent fascination with Japanese animation. It simply seems that it comes so easy for Miyazaki to so skillfully combine simple concepts – friendship, triumph over evil – with such beautiful landscapes and mature overarching thematic elements. Simply put, it’s absolutely beautiful and breathtaking in every which way. It also seems to be the film that would affirm Miyazaki’s mastery, which he would continue with My Neighbor Totoro, Porco Rosso, Princess Mononoke, and Spirited Away.\n\n2) Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem.\n\nAs a feminist and as a woman, a lot of things I watched this month infuriated me. I watched The Invisible War and The Hunting Ground, two documentaries by Kirby Dick that covered the proliferation of sexual abuse toward women in the military and college campuses, respectively. Another documentary, She’s Beautiful When She’s Angry, skillfully details the exhausting trials and pinnacle accomplishments of second-wave feminism (although like the movement, this film is imperfect). The one film that affected me the most, however, surprisingly came in the fictional form of Gett: The Trial of Viviane Amsalem. In modern day Israel, this titular character is trying to get a divorce, the problem being that her husband refuses to offer consent. Shot almost entirely in one room, its tight framing and minimal personal characters stands opposite to the explosive dialogue and raw emotion that surrounds the trial. Although Ronit Elkabetz (who plays Viviane and also co-writes and directs this film) gets relatively little speaking roles, her presence and performance define this portrait of a woman who has become upsettingly fatigued by the patriarchy. Men are awful.\n\n1) Dancer in the Dark.\n\nNow, I’ve expressed my distaste for a lot of filmmakers over the years, but the one that I seem to get the most rebuttals from is Lars Von Trier. I just can’t help it – although I was really impressed with Melancholia, I hated Antichrist and Dogville and was thoroughly let down by Breaking the Waves (which a lot of my cinephile buddies consider his best). I’m not going to try to convince myself that any of these films are “bad”; there are just certain aspects of each that seriously bored me or turned me off completely. I can never connect to his exhaustively cold style, even in some of his more emotionally-charged films. With this kept in mind, it’s easy to see why I’ve been putting off Dancer in the Dark for so long. To be honest, there were only two selling points that even made me remotely interested in Dancer in the Dark: the first being that it’s a musical, the second being Björk. Ironically, once I finally rolled my eyes and got around to this “necessary” film (as “necessary” as I was told the others were), I could have kicked myself for not getting around to it sooner. Björk has got to be the best Von Trier protagonist I’ve seen yet; she truly put her very heart and soul into every second of screen time. All of the musical sequences happen in her head, as her way of making light of the tragic, grim circumstances that surround her. In such a way it’s a lot like Pennies From Heaven one of my favorite musicals, only these Berkeley-esque song-and-dance numbers are less humorous and much more steeped in realistic despair. Its story is a sadistic one, but the way our central character is fleshed out creates a layer of sympathy surrounding this tale that renders it viably humanistic and undeniably beautiful. And once again, it only further proves to me that everything Björk touches is bound to turn to gold.\n\nDespite these positive thoughts, I’m still not sure if I’ll ever get around to Nympomaniac or any of Von Trier’s other films – not yet anyway. If Dancer in the Dark forever remains the exception in my eyes, I wouldn’t be complaining at all.\n\nIn honor of April Fools’ Day, I’ve decided that the theme for the month of April will be devoted to a certain subsection of films that I don’t nearly pay enough attention to. I’m talking about bad movies, and while I do already watch a good amount of B-movies or mediocre films from directors I enjoy, these aren’t the films I’m talking about. I’m talking about the universally (or almost universally) despised movies, the ones with overwhelmingly bad reviews and less than 20% on Rotten Tomatoes. I’ve realized that I don’t spend nearly enough time seeking out films other than the ones I want to see. Lots of film critics go out and watch movies that they already expect to be bad; sometimes they are even pleasantly surprised, although not usually. I don’t think I could really call myself a true cinephile unless I delve into some real crap every now and then. I’ve already made a long list of movies for my personal usage – let’s just say that there’s a lot more sequels and bad CGI oriented movies that I’m particularly proud of. Nonetheless, I think I’m prepared for the month of masochism that’s bound to occur. Wish me luck!"
