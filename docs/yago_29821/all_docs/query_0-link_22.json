        "text": "When model, author, actress, TV host and philanthropist Padma Lakshmi released her memoir earlier this year, the buzz around it refused to die for quite some time.\n\nThe reason? The series of startling revelations that made up its content.\n\nTitled Love, Loss And What We Ate, the memoir houses vivid details about her relationship with celebrated novelist Salman Rushdie, her battle with Endometriosis and how being sexually abused at the age of seven transformed her life.\n\nPadma Lakshmi and Salman Rushdie in happier times. Photo: Reuters\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs the popular Top Chef host turns 46 today, here's a look at six shocking revelations from her book that came as a surprise to many.\n\nOn Salman Rushdie\n\nThe whirlwind romance between author Salman Rushdie and Padma Lakshmi was for the entire world to see--so was their subsequent divorce. Having met at a party in 1999, Rushdie, then 51, and Padma Lakshmi who was 28 at the time, exchanged vows in 2004.\n\nThe couple ended up divorcing each other in 2007, the reasons for which Lakshmi later penned down in her memoir, Love, Loss and What We Ate.\n\n1. According to Lakshmi, her getting diagnosed with Endometriosis was one of the major reasons behind her failed marriage with novelist Rushdie. The disease, which is caused when a tissue that normally grows inside the uterus grows outside it, resulted in a lack of physical intimacy between the two--which made Rushdie refer to her as a \"bad investment\". Lakshmi also hints how--to a certain extent--Rushdie was insensitive towards her disease and took her inability to have sex (due to Endometriosis) as rejection.\n\nLakshmi's memoir.

The memoir also had Lakshmi reveal that Booker-Prize-winner Rushdie used to be disappointed each time the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to some other author.\n\n3. Love, Loss and What We Ate also sheds light on how Rushdie \"seduced\" her with his words.\n\nAlso Read: Padma Lakshmi writes about her failed marriage to Rushdie\n\nOn being sexually abused at the age of 7\n\n4. Host of popular show Top Chef, Lakshmi also mentions how one of her father's close relatives sexually abused her at the age of seven.\n\n\"One night, I woke up to his hand in my underpants. He took my hand and placed it inside his briefs. I don't know how many times it happened before, since I suspect I slept through some incidents,\" the memoir has her write.\n\nLakshmi as a child.

As disturbing as the sexual abuse was in itself, her parents' reaction to it was equally, if not more, shocking.\n\nThe incident came to light when her mother discovered that she had \"urinated behind her bed in a sign of distress\". Lakshmi revealed how after confronting her parents about the same, she was sent off to Madras.\n\n\"In retrospect, however, he should have been the one to go,\" she writes. \"Years later, in tears, my mother would acknowledge this grave mistake.\"\n\nOn daughter Krishna's father\n\n6. Reportedly, Lakshmi also admits to not knowing the name of her now six-year-old daughter Krishna's father when she was first informed about her pregnancy.\n\nPadma Lakshmi with daughter Krishna.
