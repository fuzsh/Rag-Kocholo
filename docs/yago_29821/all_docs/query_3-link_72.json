        "text": "After revealing some very intimate and startling details about her marriage to author Salman Rushdie, Padma Lakshmi's memoir also houses a vivid account of how she was sexually abused at the age of seven.\n\nTitled Love, Loss And What We Ate, Lakshmi's memoir talks about how, at the age of seven, when she lived with her mother in an apartment in Queens, New York, she sometimes ended up sharing a bed with one of her then stepfather's relatives, which \"to people like us, who were used to living far too many to an apartment in India, seemed relatively normal.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nSpeaking to People magazine, Padma Lakshmi said, \"I wanted to talk about it because if women like me don't talk about it, who will?\"\n\nElucidating on the sexual abuse, Lakshmi writes, \"One night, I woke up to his hand in my underpants. He took my hand and placed it inside his briefs. I don't know how many times it happened before, since I suspect I slept through some incidents.\"\n\nAlso Read: Salman Rushdie needed constant care and frequent sex, reveals Padma Lakshmi in her memoir\n\nThe incident came into light with her mother discovering that she had \"urinated behind her bed in a sign of distress.\"\n\nLakshmi, 45, then recalled how a confrontation with her mother and her then stepfather led to her being sent to India. \"Once you take a girl's innocence, you can never get it back,\" she writes.\n\nElaborating on her then stepfather's reaction to the whole incident, Lakshmi writes how he used \"pantomime\" to \"demonstrate\" what had happened--by making her lie down on the living room divan. And how her mother sent her off to Madras.\n\n\"In retrospect however, he should have been the one to go,\" she writes. \"Years later, in tears, my mother would acknowledge this grave mistake.\"\n\nAlso Read:Lady Gaga's music video depicts campus sexual assault\n\nLakshmi says that the incident went on to change a lot of things in her life--\"It was the catalyst for my mother's divorce, for me going to India. It was the catalyst for me being different about my body and just less open in the world. It was a loss of innocence in a way. What happened to me was not even that bad compared to what happens to many young girls and boys. But it was something that happened. I didn't want to dwell on it.\"\n\n\"I think of all those girls I pass on the street who are in elementary school,\" she says. \"I think about my daughter's classmates or my daughter. It happens more than we think.\"\n\n\"Every time I go to JFK, I can see my apartment with the graffiti on the brick and I wonder what girl is living there and what her life is like. It was by no means on the scale of what many little girls and boys go through--but it did happen.\""
