        "text": "Mangaluru: Minister for Health and Family Welfare who is also District in Charge Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao said that an amendment has been made to the law to provide protection for doctors, nurses, and medical staff, and it is awaiting the Governor's assent.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Mangaluru on Saturday, he mentioned that the incident of sexual assault involving a medical student in Kolkata has caused concern and panic among all. Doctors and other staff work throughout the night. Female staff also work through the night.\n\n“We have amended law related to the protection of doctors. As per the amendment, none should abuse, insult doctors, nurses, and staff. Even making videos against doctors and staff and posting them on social media will be considered a crime under this law. Ensuring safety is also the responsibility of those running the hospital and we also have a responsibility,” he said.\n\n“I have convened a meeting with doctors and hospital owners on Tuesday to discuss the steps to be taken with regard to the safety,” he said.\n\n“With the doctors calling for a protest throughout the day, emergency services will be available in all hospitals. Only the OPD (Outpatient Department) will be closed on Saturday. I wont say that there will not be any inconvenience with the doctors protest. won’t say the protest is wrong and they are doing it with good intentions. There should not be any fearful atmosphere at the workplace,” said the minister.\n\nBengaluru: Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Thursday flayed the NDA government over its plan to amend the law governing Waqf boards, saying the move shows that it's against minorities.\n\nThe Bill has proposed far-reaching changes in the present Act, including ensuring the representation of Muslim women and non-Muslims in such bodies.\n\nThe Waqf (Amendment) Bill also seeks to rename the Waqf Act, 1995, as the Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency and Development Act, 1995.\n\n\"The NDA government is totally against the minorities in this country, they are not for secularism, they are not for social justice. We have been telling the people of the country that they are communal parties, they are casteists, that's why they are doing like that,\" Siddaramaiah told reporters here in response to a question.\n\nThe Bill was circulated among Lok Sabha members on Tuesday night ahead of its introduction.\n\nAccording to its statement of objects and reasons, the Bill seeks to omit Section 40 of the current law relating to the powers of the Board to decide if a property is waqf property.\n\nIt provides for a broad-based composition of the Central Waqf Council and the State Waqf Boards and ensures the representation of Muslim women and non-Muslims in such bodies. The Bill also proposes the establishment of a separate board of Auqaf for the Bohras and Aghakhanis.\n\nThe draft law provides for the representation of Shias, Sunnis, Bohras, Agakhanis and other backward classes among Muslim communities.\n\nIn a heart-wrenching incident, a 15-year-old boy from Benjanapadavu village in Bantwal taluk of Dakshina Kannada, has died by suicide.\n\nThe young student, Bhavish Acharya, was a Class 10 student who tragically ended his life by hanging himself in the bathroom of his home.\n\nBhavish, the son of Udaya Acharya, lived with his family in Benjanapadavu Karavali Site and was studying at a private school in Badakabailu.\n\nAccording to sources close to the family, Bhavish had frequently expressed difficulties with his studies, sharing his concerns with his parents. However, the exact circumstances that led to this devastating act remain unknown.\n\nOn the evening of August 7, Bhavish returned home and remained indoors. Around 7:30 p.m., he went to the bathroom and didn’t return for an unusually long time.\n\nWorried, his family knocked on the door, but there was no response. Fearing the worst, they broke the door open and were confronted with the heartbreaking sight of Bhavish hanging. He was rushed to Thumbay hospital, but tragically, doctors declared him dead on arrival.\n\nThe Bantwal twon police have registered a case and are conducting a thorough investigation to understand the factors leading to this tragic event."
