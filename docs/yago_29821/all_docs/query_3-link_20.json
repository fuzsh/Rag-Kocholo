        "text": "Filleted Salman, anyone? Literary big fish Salman Rushdie was reminded that hell hath no fury this week when his ex-wife Padma Lakshmi spared no detail of his faults in her new memoir, Love, Loss and What We Ate. The unhappy couple lead our roundup of revenge-wreaking books…\n\nPadma Lakshmi on Salman Rushdie\n\nThe model-turned-TV-chef-judge’s book lays bare her eight-year relationship with needy novelist Rushdie, 23 years her senior. Lakshmi claims that she had to console poor Sir Salman every year he didn’t win the Nobel prize for literature and that her struggles with endometriosis led him to call her “a bad investment”. When she refused sex due to being in pain, he’d allegedly reply, “How convenient.”\n\nRevenge rating: 2/5. Satanic versus.\n\nSven Göran Eriksson on Nancy Dell’Olio\n\nWhen the former England football manager published Sven: My Story in 2013, he called his Italian ex-partner “unbearable”, “irritating” and “demanding constant attention”. Sven said the diva-like lawyer was forever complaining about unflattering lighting or the temperature of champagne. When they split, he says she outstayed her welcome in his London flat by four years, then left with his kitchen utensils.\n\nRevenge rating: 4/5. Swede revenge.\n\nClaire Bloom on Philip Roth\n\nIn 1996’s Leaving a Doll’s House, the British actor Bloom chronicled her 18-year relationship with the American writer. Describing Roth as violent, abusive and manipulative, Bloom compares herself to a prisoner during their long affair and brief marriage. She outlines him taping their phone calls, handing her a “brutal” prenup and even faxing her an invoice for the time they’d spent together.\n\nRevenge rating: 3/5. Feel the Roth.\n\nValérie Trierweiler on François Hollande\n\nThe former French first lady’s explosive memoir, Merci pour ce moment, proved an embarrassment to the president on its 2014 publication. Humiliated on hearing that Hollande had a mistress, Trierweiler got payback by claiming he mocked the poor, struggled with his weight, was heartless, indecisive and a habitual liar. Doubtless to Hollande’s dismay, it became a bestseller and a film version is in development.\n\nRevenge rating: 4/5. Valérie singleton.\n\nKim Gordon on Thurston Moore\n\nThe couple were the epitome of cool in the seminal indie-rock group Sonic Youth, but last year’s candid memoir Girl in a Band saw Gordon sound off about her husband’s infidelity. She calls Moore’s stage presence “so phoney, so childish”, says he’s “inconsiderate and self-centred”, “a coward” and his temper “scared her”. She’s none too complimentary about his new partner either.\n\nRevenge rating: 2/5. Gimme Moore.\n\nLord Ashcroft on David Cameron\n\nFormer Tory donor Michael Ashcroft had a “personal beef” with the prime minister for not giving him a ministerial role in the coalition. Ashcroft got even last year by co-writing Call Me Dave, which hit headlines worldwide with its claims of him smoking cannabis at Oxford University, cocaine circulating at a party attended by the Camerons and, of course, the #piggate allegation that “Hameron” put part of his anatomy in a dead hog’s mouth."
