To which, Mr Rushdie however, would reply: \"How convenient\", nydailynews quoted Padma as writing in her memoir. She went on to mention that Mr Rushdie referred to her as \"bad investment.\"\n\nNews website nydailynews also reported that she mentioned, soon after her homecoming from a critical surgery, the author left for a trip, and before leaving he said: \"The show must go on, after all.\"\n\nPadma, who also described Mr Rushdie as, \"lethally eloquent\", mentioned his reaction after she featured on the cover of Newsweek magazine during the second season of Top Chef, which she has been hosting. \"The only time Newsweek put me on their cover was when someone was trying to put a bullet in my head,\" he had said.\n\nEarlier, in an interview to IANS, Padma had also said about her ex-husband: \"Now there is somebody who has great wit and is a great flirt. I don't regret a day I spent with Salman, but it was tiring. He has a big life, and it only got bigger when we were together. I'm happy to have stood next to him holding his hand, but we were in very different parts of our lives.\"\n\nPadma has daughter Krishna Thea Lakshmi-Dell with computer mogul Adam Dell, while Mr Rushdie's marriage to the Indian-American actress was his fourth one.\n\nPadma is also author of books like Easy Exotic and Tangy, Tart, Hot and Sweet, and has hosted Food Network's cook show Padma's Passport.
