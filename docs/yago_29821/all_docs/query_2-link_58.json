        "text": "Padma Lakshmi\n\nIndian-American fashion model, television personality, and author\n\nPadma Lakshmi (born September 1, 1970, Chennai, India) is an Indian-American fashion model, television personality, and author best known for her role as the host of the cooking competition show Top Chef (2006– ) and of the food and travel series Taste the Nation (2020– ).\n\nEarly life, education, and modeling career\n\nBorn in Chennai, India, Lakshmi moved to New York City in 1974, at the age of four, joining her mother, Vijaya Lakshmi, who had emigrated two years earlier after her divorce from Padma’s father. Lakshmi grew up spending the school year with her mother, first in New York City and later in Los Angeles, and the summers in Chennai with her extended family. After graduating from high school in Los Angeles, Lakshmi moved across the country to attend Clark University, in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1992, while attending a study abroad program in Madrid, Lakshmi was introduced to a booker at a model talent agency, a chance encounter that led to her securing representation and work as a model during the rest of her time in Spain. The work proved so lucrative that Lakshmi, after returning to Clark to participate in graduation, continued to pursue a career in modeling, first in Los Angeles, and later in Milan and Paris. Considered “exotic” by some in the industry owing to her complexion and a prominent scar on her right arm (a result of an auto accident when she was 14), Lakshmi initially had trouble securing routine work but achieved considerable success after posing for legendary fashion photographer Helmut Newton.\n\nTransition to television\n\nIn 1997, after years of working as a high-profile fashion model in Europe, Lakshmi became a cohost of the talk show Domenica In. Broadcast live, the show provided Lakshmi with an opportunity to hone her skills as a television performer, enabling her to develop a facility for improvisation.\n\nReturning to the United States in 1999, Lakshmi continued to pursue a career in television. After successful appearances on the Food Network to promote the release of her cookbook, Easy Exotic: A Model’s Low Fat Recipes from Around the World (1999), Lakshmi hosted Planet Food (2001), a short-lived series of food documentaries that combined elements of the travelogue and the cooking show genres, and was given an episode of the cooking series Melting Pot to host called “Padma’s Passport” (2001). In 2004 she married acclaimed author Salman Rushdie; the couple divorced in 2007.\n\nLakshmi became the host and judge of Top Chef in 2006, joining the cast of the reality competition program in its second season. Featuring veteran restaurateur Tom Colicchio, food writer Gail Simmons, and a rotating cast of celebrity chefs and food personalities, including Michelle Bernstein, Anthony Bourdain, Thomas Keller, and Emeril Lagasse, Top Chef became a cultural touchstone, introducing scores of cable television viewers to the world of haute cuisine. In 2023 Lakshmi announced her decision to leave the program after the finale of the show’s 20th season, ending her involvement as both host and executive producer.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

A critical success, the show’s 2021 holiday special received the prestigious James Beard Media Award for long-form visual media the next year.\n\nWriting career and advocacy\n\nIn addition to Easy Exotic, Lakshmi wrote books in a number of genres, including a second cookbook, Tangy, Tart, Hot, and Sweet: A World of Recipes for Every Day (2007); Love, Loss, and What We Ate: A Memoir (2016); the reference book The Encyclopedia of Spices & Herbs: An Essential Guide to the Flavors of the World (2016); and the children’s book Tomatoes for Neela (2021).\n\nDiagnosed with endometriosis in 2006, Lakshmi cofounded the Endometriosis Foundation of America in 2009. The organization is devoted to research and education concerning the disease. An American Civil Liberties Union artist ambassador for immigrant rights and women’s rights, Lakshmi has spoken frequently about her experiences as a survivor of sexual assault. In 2019 she was named a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme and used her position to raise awareness of global inequality.\n\nAndré Munro"
