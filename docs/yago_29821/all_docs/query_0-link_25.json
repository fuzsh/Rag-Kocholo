        "text": "WORRIED that you have been wasting time reading celebrity profiles? Don't be. The path to true love may be paved with glossy pages.\n\nThis, at least, was the experience of the author Salman Rushdie. When he was in Italy to promote his 1999 novel ''The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' a publicist gave him a copy of Panorama magazine. Although Mr. Rushdie was on its cover, he became absorbed in a profile of an Indian actress and model, Padma Parvati Lakshmi, who was sufficiently fluent in Italian to be the host of ''Domenica In,'' a popular variety show on Italian television, and the star of two films.\n\nMr. Rushdie, born in Mumbai, said he was proud to see a fellow Indian doing so well. Since his third marriage was ailing at this time, he also admitted that the comely photographs of Ms. Lakshmi made him think, ''If I ever meet this girl, my goose is cooked.''\n\nPerhaps a goose prepared tandoori style, since yogurt and garam masala are frequent ingredients in Ms. Lakshmi's cookbook, ''Easy Exotic: A Model's Low-Fat Recipes From Around the World.'' A native of New Delhi, she spent most of her youth in New York and graduated in 1992 from Clark University in Worcester, Mass., where she studied theater.\n\n''Padma is a born entertainer,'' her mother, Vijaya Lakshmi, recalled. ''Even back in elementary school talent shows, we had to drag her offstage.'' Ms. Lakshmi, whose family name is also the name of the Hindu goddess of prosperity, and Mr. Rushdie met on Liberty Island in August 1999, at Tina Brown's launch party for Talk magazine. Ms. Lakshmi saw Mr. Rushdie there and said hello. To her surprise, he began talking about all he had learned of her from the magazine.\n\n''This couldn't be Salman Rushdie,'' Ms. Lakshmi remembered thinking. He seemed to her more like a distant uncle whom ''my mother had bragged to all about me.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
