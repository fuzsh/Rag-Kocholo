When they met, she was single and 28; he was 51 and on his third marriage. They were lovers until he finally got divorced in 2004, and they married.\n\nThe N.Y. Daily News had a story summarizing the book’s account of their time together: Lakshmi, a model who became host of the long-running U.S. reality show Top Chef, depicts Rushdie as pretty much all ego and libido.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nDoug Camilli: Salman Rushdie was mostly ego and libido, ex-wife Padma Lakshmi says Back to video\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nThere with you then.

Then she developed a medical condition, long undiagnosed, that made sex painful. He got angry, sneering “how convenient” when she refused him, she writes. In arguments, she says, he was “lethally eloquent.”\n\nFinally, she called a lawyer; they split in 2007.\n\nShe’s 45 now. He’s 68.\n\n***\n\nSpotlight couple: Us Weekly says actress Amanda Seyfried, who split with Justin Long in September, is seeing Thomas Sadoski, her co-star in this picture The Last Word.\n\nTom divorced Kimberly Hope, a casting director, in October.\n\nSeyfried’s 30. Sadoski’s 39.\n\n***\n\nThe legal squabble over young Rocco is going badly for Madonna, and she’s trying to salvage what she can, says the Mail on Sunday in England.\n\nMadge has reportedly given up on custody and accepts that Rocco will remain in London with his father, Guy Ritchie. But she’s asking for specified weekly communication times, occasional trips stateside for him, a say in his education, a promise that he’ll have “native” bodyguards, etc. It’s not clear if Guy and Rocco will push back, as legal haggling continues.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n(“Native” bodyguards, it turns out, are not sturdy guys in dark suits who say “cheerio pip pip” and “spot of bother” and “boot” and all that. The phrase refers to youngish, cool-looking protectors who can fit in at places Rocco might go.)\n\n***\n\nCharlie Sheen says he can no longer afford $55,000 in monthly child support for Bob and Max, his twin sons with Brooke Mueller, whom he divorced in 2011.\n\nThe N.Y. Post says Sheen has asked a court to reduce the amount, since he’s making only $167,000 a month now. Most of that is the monthly payment from the sale of his residual rights to Two and a Half Men. No comment from Mueller.\n\nCharlie says he has $12 million in debts.\n\nHe’s 50. The boys turn seven next week.\n\n***\n\nOn last Friday’sToday show, Gwyneth Paltrow said she’s done with acting, at least for now. She wants to concentrate on Goop, her “lifestyle” website.\n\n“We took some investment last year, so as soon as we had other people’s money, I realized I really better focus on this completely,” she told Matt Lauer. “I’ll return to acting probably, but probably not right now.”\n\nThis sounds like co-operating with the inevitable: except for the Iron Man/Marvel movies, her only big-screen project lately has been the floperoo Mortdecai.\n\nShe’s 43.\n\ntellcamilli@gmail.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
