        "text": "NEW YORK, April 19 (UPI) -- Author Salmon Rushdie has married actress Padma Lakshmi in a traditional Hindu ceremony held in New York, Britain's Telegraph reported Monday.\n\nThe wedding was the fourth for Rushdie, who achieved international acclaim after writing \"The Satanic Verses\" and becoming the target of a Muslim death threat. It was the first wedding for his Indian bride, who wore a traditional purple sari at Saturday's event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGuests, which numbered 275, included Hollywood actors Steve Martin and Robert Klein; former Talk magazine editor Tina Brown and her husband, Sir Harold Evans; British columnist Christopher Hitchens; model Iman; British author William Dalrymple; Bollywood film director Ismail Merchant, and Sabeer Bhatia, the San Franciso-based inventor of Hotmail.\n\nRushie, 56, met Lakshmi, 31, at the 1999 launch party for Talk at the Statue of Liberty.\n\nLakshmi, who was born in southern India, has spent her television and modeling career in Los Angeles and Italy.\n\nRushdie reportedly is planning to turn his short story, \"The Firebird's Nest,\" into a feature film script, which will star his wife."
