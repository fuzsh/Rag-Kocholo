In the autobiography, published in the U.S. on Tuesday, the 45-year-old details a series of fiery relationships.\n\nShe met Sir Salman in 1999, when Miss Lakshmi was 28 and single, and Sir Salman was 51 and already married to his third wife. Miss Lakshmi and Sir Salman married in 2004, and he used to make her breakfast in bed every morning at first, she says.\n\nBut slowly it soured, with Sir Salman proving as “lethally eloquent” in wars of words as in print. The author, who was born in Bombay but brought up in Britain, was knighted in 2007, having won the Booker Prize in 1983 for Midnight’s Children.\n\nShe told People magazine this week: “I just wanted my own identity. I was making the transition out of one stage of my life and into another. But in order to do that, it required that I wasn’t everywhere that he needed me to be.”\n\nMiss Lakshmi developed endometriosis, a painful condition affecting the lining of the womb, and she writes that Sir Salman was unsympathetic. When she refused sex due to the pain, he would reply: “How convenient.”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIt’s not that I didn’t want to be there for him, but something was very deeply wrong\n\n“It’s not that I didn’t want to be there for him, but something was very deeply wrong,” she said. “And I didn’t understand it. And that caused a whole lot of misunderstanding.”\n\nAfter five-hour surgery, Miss Lakshmi had stitches in four organs and stents in her kidneys. But Sir Salman left the next day for a work trip.\n\n“The show must go on, after all,” he said on his way out the door, according to Miss Lakshmi.\n\nAs soon as she could leave the house, she went to a divorce lawyer. She went on to become involved with Ted Forstmann, a billionaire chief executive, who died in 2011, aged 71.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nIran threatens to boycott Frankfurt Book Fair due to Salman Rushdie speech\n\nThe fairy tale of Salman Rushdie\n\nSir Salman has not responded to his former wife’s onslaught. But shortly after his marriage to Miss Lakshmi ended, he said he thought marriage was an unnecessary complication in life — and that women only want it for the dress.\n\n“It’s strange, given that I’ve been married four times, but I actually don’t think marriage is necessary,” he said. “Girls like it, especially if they’ve never been married before — it’s the dress. Girls want a wedding, they don’t want a marriage. If only you could have weddings without marriages.”\n\nSir Salman also disclosed that he and Miss Lakshmi had marriage counselling, but without success.\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
