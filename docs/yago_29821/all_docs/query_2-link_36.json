        "text": "[#image: /photos/5ce4625c3bf9b426b0b20e93]||| |||\n\nImage: Prabuddha Dasgupta\n\nIn Salman Rushdie's literary-brilliant memoir Joseph Anton; Padma Lakshmi (Top Chef host, model, actress and author) was described as being \"ambitious in a way that often obliterated feeling\" and faulted her for her “majestic narcissism”. In Lakshmi's memoir Love, Loss And What We Ate, we get the she-said—from meeting the literary mogul for the first time in an electric-turquoise Calypso slip dress at a party on Liberty Island to their tempestuous marriage and Rushdie's inability to understand their flailing intimacy because of the pain she felt from (at first undiagnosed and later diagnosed) endometriosis. But just as Joseph Anton told the larger and fascinating tale of a man and writer living in exile, Love, Loss And What We Ate is not a Rushdie tell-all—the book is bigger than its first few chapters. Here's why Lakshmi's memoir should be on your must-read list:\n\n“…I've also at various times rendered quinoa as “kin-oh-ah” and calcium as “cal-shum,” thanks to the many accents and languages in my head competing for access to my mouth.” The Chennai-born Lakshmi grew up shuttling between continents—from her grandparents' home in India to her mother's in America. Her years in Europe as a struggling model and actor and finally her homecoming back to New York and celebrity. From everyday racism (being called “black giraffe” on the school yard) to her own need to obliterate her identity to fit in (she changed her name to Angie in high school) to being comfortable in her own skin–Love, Loss And What We Ate is in many ways the classic immigrant tale.\n\n“What I remember more is telling my mother what happened and her believing me…” According to a 2007 study by the Indian Government, about 53 per cent of children (boys and girls) are victims of sexual abuse in India. It's rampant but hardly spoken about. Lakshmi bravely recounts her experience of abuse. She tells us how her then stepfather's relative sexually abused her as a child. She reveals how this moulded her own ideas of her body, how it became the catalyst for her mother's divorce and how her mother's support helped her work through this.\n\n“My scar became adornment… Almost overnight, it had transformed from a stain into a sort of talisman, a source of power and confidence.” She was the model who lost job after job because of the scar (left behind by a horrific car accident) that runs across her arm, until the legendary photographer Helmut Newton booked her for a shoot because of it—Lakshmi's memoir is also the quintessential anonymous-to-celebrated-model story, from her first audition with unshaved legs to working with the likes of Giorgio Armani and Roberto Cavalli.\n\n“The greatest gift that Top Chef gave me was the blessing of living intentionally, with agency, and doing what I really loved.” The applesauce she makes to calm her dying lover and cheer her growing toddler, the kamquat and ginger chutney that helped her assert her womanhood post a failed marriage—food for Lakshmi is not just nourishment and sensual wonder, it is her agent of empowerment almost. Also, watch out for easy-to-cook recipes and the particularly delicious celebration of the Indian umami or chatpati, “the condition to which all food should aspire”.\n\n“Like the scar on my arm, my reproductive system was a liability.” Lakshmi who had suffered from endometriosis for decades was only diagnosed when she was in her late 30s. In her memoirs, she details the many surgeries, the toll it took on her idea of her own womanhood, sex life (and in turn, marriage) and the lack of awareness of a disease that led to years of pain and suffering. And much like her scar, she decided to make it her source of power: she is now co-founder of the Endometriosis Foundation of America, and is actively advocating for early diagnosis and raising awareness for this chronic disease.\n\n“We continued to trade stories until we reached year thirty-six, when I ran out of years. He had thirty more to go.” The media branded him her sugar daddy, but Lakshmi takes control of her narrative and tells her story of love and learning with Teddy Forstmann—who was a billionaire and CEO of IMG. He died in 2011, after a brief struggle with cancer. Her book is dedicated to him and she candidly describes their republican versus democrat squabbles, his calming presence in the delivery room when she gave birth to her daughter who was fathered by another man, and credits him as the man who changed her life by simply loving her unconditionally.\n\n“I prayed for her to always need me.” Lakshmi's prayer is for her daughter—her memoirs trace her journey to motherhood, through moments like the confusion around her daughter's paternity, the decision to consume her own placenta to combat post-partum depression, resisting the pressure to immediately lose her baby weight, the nastiness of a custody battle, finding piece with her daughter's father and finally, just being a mother."
