        "text": "Padma Lakshmi seemingly does it all. She began her career modeling before transitioning into acting for film and television. She also starred in a music video, launched her own jewelry collection, and began hosting Top Chef—a position she still holds. And the apparent superwoman added yet another notch to her belt when she released her debut memoir, Love, Loss, and What We Ate, on International Women's Day earlier this week. Though the book is filled with stories from Lakshmi's past, perhaps the most touching part of Love, Loss, and What We Ate is the portion where she discusses the negative impact having endometriosis had on her marriage to author Salman Rushdie.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, endometriosis is a condition in which tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus grows outside of it. This can cause pain, heavy periods, and in some cases, infertility. There is no cure for endometriosis, but several treatment options are available. Actress and writer Lena Dunham and singer Halsey opened up about their experiences with the disorder earlier this year, sharing how \"painful\" and \"discouraging\" endometriosis can be. Lakshmi has decided to do the same in her memoir, boldly telling the Today Show she planned to \"own her history.\"\n\nLakshmi's relationship with Rushdie began pleasantly—with walks in Central Park and conversations about their shared heritage. But as her endometriosis became more severe, ultimately requiring surgery, the couple's sex life was affected—leading to the demise of their marriage. According to the book, Rushdie accused Lakshmi of using her endometriosis as an excuse not to have sex with him, and he went as far as calling her a \"bad investment\" because of her condition.\n\nEventually, Lakshmi felt the pair would be better off separated, and she, better off alone. “I was free to wallow in my malaise, and nurse myself without seeing the disappointment in his face,\" she wrote. Despite the tension surrounding her endometriosis, Rushdie and Lakshmi have remained friends post-divorce. Rushdie even openly supported his ex-wife's book, saying she had a right to share her perspective of their story.\n\nThis situation is an unfortunately needed reminder that a woman’s worth is not tied to her sexual and reproductive health. Lakshmi is certainly not alone in suffering from the condition, and she, along with the 5 million other American women who struggle with endometriosis, deserve compassion and support from their loved ones. Lone Hummelshoj of the World Endometriosis Society recommends opening up communication with your loved one in an attempt to understand what they're experiencing, as well as offering support unconditionally. Endometriosis isn't a short-term thing—it doesn't go away—so long-term support is important.\n\nPhoto Credit: Getty / Michael Loccisano\n\n7 People on Why They Chose to Be Celibate for a Spell\n\n“This break ended up being a wake-up call: Most of the people I was seeing didn’t really care about my pleasure.”\n\n3 Trans Athletes on Why Being Excluded From Women’s Sports Is So Devastating\n\n“This wasn’t just my career.
