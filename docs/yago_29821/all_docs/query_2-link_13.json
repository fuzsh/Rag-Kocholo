        "text": "Padma Lakshmi, the cookbook author and reality television star, has a signature repertoire as host of “Top Chef” on Bravo. It plays out at key moments in the competition, when anxious chefs stand opposite her as she tastes their dishes, their faces scrutinizing hers for some clue about what she is thinking.\n\nShe chews silently and then puts down her utensils, often without a flicker of expression. “Thank you,” she finally says, before turning away gracefully and moving on to the next contestant.\n\nPart of the appeal of the moment is that Ms. Lakshmi, 45, leaves so much unsaid.\n\nNot so in her new book, “Love, Loss and What We Ate,” which was released on Tuesday. In the 324-page memoir, Ms. Lakshmi opens a window into her life, weaving together stories from her childhood, her love affairs and her work through the lens of the culinary experiences that eventually shaped her fame. The book appears to spare little, delving deeply into personal details about uncertainty over paternity during her pregnancy, the pain of a custody case and her efforts to overcome the insecurity she felt being Indian.\n\n“I am going to own my history,” she said in an interview on the “Today” show on NBC.\n\nMs. Lakshmi particularly highlights her high-profile relationship with the author Salman Rushdie, which was overshadowed by a fatwa, or religious edict, that had been issued in 1989 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran’s former supreme leader. It called for Mr. Rushdie to be put to death for his supposedly blasphemous book “The Satanic Verses.”\n\nThe two met at a party in New York in 1999, when he was married and she was an aspiring model and actress. They shared a high-profile love affair, and then a marriage. But health and professional tensions frayed their relationship.\n\nMs. Lakshmi suffered from endometriosis, a painful uterine disorder in which tissue grows outside the organ. The struggles of dealing with it — she had extensive surgery — upended their sex life and contributed to the demise of their marriage, she writes. Ms. Lakshmi said Mr. Rushdie at one point called her “a bad investment” and was insensitive to her medical condition even as she tried to recuperate.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
