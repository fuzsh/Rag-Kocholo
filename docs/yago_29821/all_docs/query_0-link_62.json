        "text": "British author Salman Rushdie is to divorce his fourth wife Padma Lakshmi.\n\n\"Salman Rushdie has agreed to divorce his wife Padma Lakshmi because of her desire to end their marriage,\" his literary agent said a statement.\n\n\"He asks that the media respect his privacy at this difficult time.\"\n\nThe announcement comes after Indian-born Rushdie, 60, was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II last month.\n\nThe knighthood triggered widespread Muslim protests, in particular in Pakistan and Iran.\n\nLakshmi, 36, who was also born in India, has been an actress and model and has hosted Italian television shows.\n\n\"I was taken with him before I could even admit it to myself. It seemed ridiculous, but we were falling in love,\" she has said of Rushdie.\n\nThe couple left London for New York several years ago, blasting the London literary circuit as \"backbiting and incestuous.\"\n\nRushdie met Lakshmi in 1999 when he was still wedded to his third wife.\n\nThe couple married five years later."
