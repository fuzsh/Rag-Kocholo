        "text": "Padma Lakshmi, the top-model turned Chef host wrote a memoir named Love, Loss and What We Ate. In this book, she mentions her experience of marrying Salman Rushdie. Salman and Lakshmi got married in the year 2004 and got divorced 3 years after that. An early copy of this memoir was obtained by our sources and some parts of this book were detailed.\n\nApparently, Lakshmi had stated that Salman needed frequent sex and constant care from her. She even revealed that he was quite insensitive to her medical condition and made sex a painful experience for her.\n\nWhen she used to tell him about this pain during sex, he would reply ‘How Convenient’.\n\nSome other quotes from her book include:\n\n1. “Salman needed frequent sex and constant care”\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BCakSZdJXP_/\n\n2. “My years with author Salman Rushdie are as a once beautiful meal that ultimately left me with mood poisoning.”\n\n3. “Salman Rushdie needed consoling every year he did not win the Noble prize for Literature.”"
