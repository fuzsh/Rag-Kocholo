        "text": "This feature was originally published on October 19, 2009.\n\nIn the 2000’s, gaming went through one of its most prosperous growth periods. Gone were the Sega vs. Nintendo “Bit Wars” that dominated the ‘90. In their place was the three-way battle for console supremacy that still exists today: Sony vs. Microsoft vs. Nintendo.\n\nWe had the Playstation 2, which sold a record-breaking 155 million units over the course of its lifetime. We had the Wii, which reinvigorated gaming on a mainstream level, more than any console since the original NES. We had the Xbox, the newcomer that prioritized processing power above all else.\n\nAnd gamewise, we had everything from narrative epics, to sports simulations, to open world sandboxes. Here are our picks for the Top 100 games of the 2000’s.\n\n100. Crazy Taxi\n\nReleased: 2000\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Hitmaker/Strangelite for Sega/Acclaim/Activision\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, GC, DC, PC\n\nBefore this highly addictive arcade hit found its way to other consoles, Crazy Taxi was one of the most popular titles available for Dreamcast. And it ain't hard to see why: its tight but fun driving controls, highly intricate worlds, and enjoyable missions were all we needed before GTA.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe taxis in the game are designed after Cadillacs, Chevrolets, and a 1949 Buick.\n\n99. The Sims\n\nReleased: 2000\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Maxis for EA\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, GC, PC\n\nWe still aren't so sure that it's good to play anything described as a \"strategic life-simulation,\" but hey, living a real life can be scary, so go ahead and play God to some mini-people, build them a nice career, start a family, and then let them all starve to death while you masturbate to climax.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe fake \"Simlish\" language is a mash-up of fractured Ukranian, French, and Tagalog. And if you know how to speak it, you probably need to get a life.\n\n98. World Soccer Winning Eleven 8 International\n\nReleased: 2005\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Konami for Konami\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, PC\n\nBefore EA’s FIFA came through and crushed the buildings, Konami’s Pro Evo (a.k.a. Winning Eleven, a.k.a. World Soccer Winning Eleven 8 International) was the first and last name in video-game footy. It feels like a long time ago, but people used to rank WE up there with Madden, and this edition is a good example of why: peerless controls and intuitive, authentic gameplay. Damn, Pro Evo—​​​​​​​in high school, you was the man, homie!\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nNorth London? Man Red? Merseyside Red? Any Pro Evo head recognizes these as the fake team names for Arsenal, Manchester United, and Liverpool. Damn you, lack of team licenses!\n\n97. Trauma Center: Under the Knife\n\nReleased: 2005\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Atlus for Atlus\n\nPlatform(s): DS\n\nMaking expert use of the DS touchscreen, this game—in which you play a hotshot surgeon with the \"Healing Touch\"—is maddening for all the right reasons. Just when you think you've exhausted all limits of stylus-eye coordination to work medical miracles—well, here comes another mind-bogglingly difficult mission to frustrate you to no end. Ouch.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nAncient Greeks believed that the \"Healing Touch\" came from Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine.\n\n96. Assassin's Creed\n\nReleased: 2007\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Ubisoft Montreal for Ubisoft\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS3, PC\n\nGet medieval on that assassin in this third-person action-adventure as a sword-swinging member of the Brotherhood trying to protect the world from the Illuminati-like group that's bent on subjugating people with religious visions produced by an artifact that makes them hallucinate. Whoa. Peyote anybody?\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe assassin Altair's targets are based on real 1191 movers and shakers like the Regent of Jerusalem Majd Addin, Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller Garnier de Nablus, and Abu-l Nuqoud, the wealthiest man in Damascus. Seems like some racial profiling going on, no?\n\n95. Hitman: Codename 47\n\nReleased: 2000\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Io Interactive for Eidos Interactive\n\nPlatform(s): PC\n\nThe game that started a multi-game, multi-movie franchise, Hitman has you follow the mysterious, barcoded Agent 47 as he attempts to piece together his past while following out CIA orders. With its third-person view, first-person controls, and sick storyline, it carved out an entire lane for itself in the stealth genre.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe game remains the only entry in the Hitman series to be exclusively playable on the PC.\n\n94. Braid\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Number None Inc/Hothead Games for Microsoft Game Studios/Number None inc.\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS3, PC\n\nIt doesn't look like great shakes, but if you've tried even the first few levels of this cult classic, you know it's a mindbender. Imagine being Mario, but you CONTROL TIME. Great game, and judging from Soulja Boy's reaction, great game...on weed.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nWith its 93% Metacritic score, Braid is the highest-rated game on the XBLA.\n\n93. Lumines\n\nReleased: 2005\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Q Entertainment/Opus/Fupac for Ubisoft\n\nPlatform(s): PSP, PC\n\nA worthy heir to Tetris as the portable-puzzle-game-you-can't-live-without, Lumines was the only PSP title worth playing for the first few years of the handheld's existence. You advance through \"skins\" by dropping blocks in one of two colors; align them with other blocks of the same color to make them disappear. Addictive as fuck, and that's without mentioning the hypnotizing soundtrack that changes to synchronize with gameplay. Seriously, Lumines invaded our dreams.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nWant to listen to music from the game? It is available online here.\n\n92. Twisted Metal: Black\n\nReleased: 2001\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Incog Inc. for Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nPlatform(s): PS2\n\nThe first PlayStation had multiple classics under the Twisted Metal franchise, so expectations were sky high when Black dropped in the summer of 2001. With some of the best graphics at the time and one of the era's darkest storylines, expectations were more than surpassed, making TMB one of PS2's first must-have games.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe multiplayer-only Twisted Metal: Black Online was later released for free with Sony's Network Adapter.\n\n91. Civilization Revolution\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Firaxis for 2K Games\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS3, DS\n\nWith Revolution, the legendary Sid Meier put together the most streamlined and accessible iteration of the digital crack-cocaine that he passes off as an innocent turn-based strategy/sim series. Cutting the length and complexity of the PC versions brought this to the console and portables in a huge way, getting an entirely new crowd hooked and paving the way for the strategy genre's future. You, too, can be a sim geek!\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThis game will crush your life. Stay far, far away if you know what's good for you.\n\n90. Smuggler's Run\n\nReleased: 2000\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Angel Studios for Rockstar Games\n\nPlatform(s): PS2\n\nOf the mostly average games available around the PS2 launch in the fall of 2000, this thuggish gem definitely stands out from the pack. Guess what? Dealing with the border patrol in video games is just as shitty as it is in real life.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nSome complained about the game's high level of difficulty and the fact that the police vehicles are significantly faster than yours. You know what? MAN UP!\n\n89. Mario Kart Wii\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Nintendo EAD for Nintendo\n\nPlatform(s): Wii\n\nNot just one of the best racing games ever, but one of the most fun video games ever! The graphics aren't all that, but you'll hardly notice once you get rolling through the surprisingly detailed worlds in an array of easy-to-control vehicles. What you will notice is that you just spent five hours racing virtual go-karts.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nBefore deciding on the wheel that wound up packaged with every copy, the developers tested over 30 prototypes.\n\n88. Tekken 6\n\nReleased: 2009\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Namco Bandai for Namco Bandai\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS3, PSP\n\nOne of the most respected fighting game franchises gets a fresh update for 2009 with new characters and bosses along with new game modes like \"Bound,\" which allows you to really beat your opponent's ass when they're down and out. All's fair in blood and gore.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nTekken 6 was the first game to be released for the PS3 -based System 357 arcade board.\n\n87. Forza Motorsport 2\n\nReleased: 2007\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Turn 10 Studios for Microsoft Game Studios\n\nPlatform(s): 360\n\nGoing for the racing-sim throne, Microsoft loads the third installment of the Forza series with so many new features that it ships on two discs! The physics and the graphical detail have been vastly improved, the Xbox Live integration is fully realized, and there's now enough in-game assistance to make anyone feel like Mike Schumacher—even if you drive like Halle Berry.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nEvery car in Forza 3 was built with 10 times the amount of polygons as in Forza 2.\n\n86. Yakuza\n\nReleased: 2005\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Amusement Vision for Sega\n\nPlatform(s): PS2\n\nPretty much everything about this game, from its combat mechanics to its mafia storyline, is standard action-adventure fare, but Yakuza earns its place on the list because it has one of the most faithful recreations of Tokyo we've ever seen in a video game, right down to the Boss coffee adverts. And boy, do we love Tokyo.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nMichael Madsen and Mark Hamill provide voices in the game. Wait, they were available?\n\n85. Golden Sun\n\nReleased: 2001\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Camelot Software Planning for Nintendo\n\nPlatform(s): GBA\n\nWho says the only good RPGs are Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest? As Issac, you lead a group of magic \"adepts\" who make a journey around the world (Weyward, not Earth) to save it from absolute destruction. The plot line, visuals, and battle system are all worthy of a proper console game, making it the best handheld RPG we've ever played.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nGolden Sun was originally going to be designed for the N64 but with GameCube in the works, it became a Game Boy Advance title.\n\n84. Katamari Damacy\n\nReleased: 2004\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Namco/Now Production for Namco\n\nPlatform(s): PS2\n\nYou're a magical space ball sent to earth with the ability to pick up anything you roll over, growing in size as you pile on more and more stuff. Anything is fair game, starting with small objects like thumbtacks and ants, eventually leading to people, houses, and mountains as the game progresses. Crazy original and crazy fun.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe game's Japanese name translates to \"clump spirit.\"\n\n83. Dead Rising\n\nReleased: 2006\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Capcom Production Studio 1 for Capcom\n\nPlatform(s): 360\n\nThe makers of the movie Zombieland definitely owe royalties to Capcom, because the film is basically Dead Rising come to life. Improvised weapons? Check. Classic American backdrops? Check. Shitloads of gruesome zombies to kill in comical ways? Check, check, check! We love this game, even if we owned it before we invested in a HDTV, making all that little-ass text impossible to read.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nGermany banned the game due to its graphic violence.\n\n82. Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader\n\nReleased: 2001\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Factor 5/LucasArts for LucasArts\n\nPlatform(s): GC\n\nWhile flying around and shooting stuff isn't always our cup of tea, we have to admit: This GameCube launch title isn't your average aerial dog-chase game. With thousands of allies and foes flying around you at top speed, it gets a little hectic out there. Even if it is pretty damn difficult, consider it a fun flight sim for people that don't normally mess with flight sims.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe game spans all three original trilogy Star Wars films and none of the shitty prequel trilogy that followed.\n\n81. Advance Wars\n\nReleased: 2001\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Intelligent Systems for Nintendo\n\nPlatform(s): GBA\n\nAdvance Wars offers deep gameplay and clean cartoon visuals with so many options that the replay value is infinite. You command a small army of grunts and officers on a strategical layout map laced with colorful and cute graphics. Yes, cute, but still deadly—as a top-down strategy game, AW crams a lot of tactical controls and schematics into a tiny console. Throw your guns in the air for this one.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nDue to 9/11, Nintendo canceled the originally scheduled Japanese release of the game. It was later released as part of a two-in-one compilation in 2004 with its sequel, Advance Wars 2.\n\n80. Fear Effect\n\nReleased: 2000\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Kronos for Eidos Interactive\n\nPlatform(s): PS\n\nPushing PlayStation One to its absolute limits, FE is a dazzling mix of puzzles, gun-bucking, and awesome cel-shaded animation. The futuristic plot line, chock-full of supernatural intrigue, is compelling enough that we didn't mind the fact that the game came on four—yep, count 'em—four discs. Fitting that the game takes place in China, since we copped the entire game on bootleg in Chinatown! Aha!\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe planned film adaptation was originally bought (and dropped) by Uwe Boll, then picked up (and dropped) by Mindfire Entertainment. In short—the project is dead.\n\n79. Midnight Club II\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Rockstar San Diego for Rockstar Games\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, PC\n\nThe sequel to Rockstar's hit arcade-racing game has more detailed cities (Paris, Los Angeles, and New York) along with an awesome multiplayer mode. The characters are a little stereotypical (what do you expect from the GTA team?) but the Capture the Flag mode is still ill.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nDue to its graphic nature (you're able to run over pedestrians) MCII originally came with a \"M\" rating which was later brought down to \"T\".\n\n78. Psychonauts\n\nReleased: 2005\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Double Fine Productions for Majesco Entertainment\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, PC\n\nTim Schafer's psychedelic platformer adventure debuted back in '05, instantly making it one of the standout titles of the last gen. The charm Schafer brought to PC adventures Monkey Island, Full Throttle, and Day of the Tentacle is in full effect here and solidifies Psychonauts place as the quintessential \"if you know, you know\" games of the Aughts.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe Psychonauts concept came from a sequence that Schafer thought up for Full Throttle in which the main character takes peyote, but LucasArts deemed it too inappropriate to include in the 1995 game.\n\n77. Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening\n\nReleased: 2005\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Capcom for Capcom/Ubisoft\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, PC\n\nDMC2 was almost universally hated on, so there was a lot of pressure on Capcom to make up for its mistakes with the third installment. Though the game might be a little too hard, the highly stylized fighting system and memorable storyline got the Devil May Cry franchise back into good graces with gamers worldwide.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nCapcom released a special edition of DMC3 with slightly different boss fights one year after the original's release.\n\n76. NBA Street Vol. 2\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: EA Canada for EA Sports BIG\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, GC\n\nHosted by Bobbito Garcia (a.k.a. Cucumber Slice), NBA Street Vol. 2 comes fully equipped with a great soundtrack and a stupefying collection of tricks that even And1 players wouldn't try—all that, plus three Michael Jordans. It's childish and unrealistic, and that's a compliment. There's a reason we wasted so many quarters on NBA Jam when we were little.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nUnlockable characters include Bobbito, Just Blaze, and Nelly and the St. Lunatics. Finally, the VG version of Murphy Lee we were all waiting for.\n\n75. Silent Hill 3\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Konami/Team Silent for Konami\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, PC\n\nSome would argue that Silent Hill 2 is the better of the sequels—and they'd be wrong. From wrapping up loose ends to just generally offering up a world even more disturbingly sick than the O.G., this is the definitive Silent Hill experience of the 128-bit gen.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nBergen St. Station is featured in the subway section of the game. It's a real-life Brooklyn train station, but its inclusion in SH3 was directly inspired by the film Jacob's Ladder (1990).\n\n74. Virtua Tennis: Sega Professional Tennis\n\nReleased: 2000\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Sega - AM3 for Sega\n\nPlatform(s): DC, PC, GBA\n\nSince tennis is basically just tennis, it's been hard for any video game to top the O.G. Nintendo version. Until the arrival of this one, that is. Gameplay is just as simple and fun as the '84 classic—with 10x better graphics, mind you—but it's the single-player World Circuit Mode and its collection of stupefyingly addictive mini-games that really make VT a legend.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe game is called Power Smash in Japan. Ayo!\n\n73. Ico\n\nReleased: 2001\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Team Ico for Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nPlatform(s): PS2\n\nThis commercial flop became a cult classic thanks to a sweeping, minimalist design that pushes the artistic envelope. In an often silent, romantic adventure, a boy with horns named Ico gets locked in a castle, where he meets another prisoner named Yorba, who happens to be the daughter of the castle's queen. The two spend the game trying to escape, holding hands the entire time. Adorable.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nIn 2005, the team behind Ico released a loose prequel called Shadow of the Colossus, which appears later on this list.\n\n72. LostWinds\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Frontier Developments for Frontier Developments\n\nPlatform(s): Wii\n\nOne of the launch titles for Nintendo's downloadable WiiWare service, this short but sweet side-scrolling adventure gives you the awesome ability to control the wind. Using the motion of the Wiimote, you can direct gusts of wind that lift your character (and various objects), effectively giving you the power of limited flight. Next to a Bangkok red-light tour, it's the best $10 you'll ever spend.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nA sequel called LostWinds: Winter of the Melodias was recently released.\n\n71. Super Smash Bros. Brawl\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Sora for Nintendo\n\nPlatform(s): Wii\n\nWhere to even begin? Wait, we know. SSB Melee on the GameCube loses its place on this list to SSB Brawl for one simple reason: Brawl's introduction of third-party characters like the much-requested Sonic. Finally, Sega and Nintendo can face off and fight! If that wasn't enough, this Wii title features Solid Snake, a roster of 37 Nintendo characters, and \"final smash\" attacks that left us battling for hours on end.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nDesigner Masahiro Sakurai said that Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima \"practically begged\" for Solid Snake to be included in SSB Melee. Hideo had to wait a game (and about seven years) to get his wish.\n\n70. Skate 2\n\nReleased: 2009\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: EA Black Box for EA\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS3\n\nWith this solid sequel, Tony Hawk's only competition went from underdog franchise to the new skate-game standard. No need for extreme sports gimmicks here, just great mechanics and a next-gen-worthy attention to detail. Yeah, it's a little harder than previous skateboarding games, but we were waiting for the challenge.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nAs downloadable content, the game gives you the option to skate in and around Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory.\n\n69. Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars\n\nReleased: 2009\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Rockstar North for Rockstar Games\n\nPlatform(s): DS, PSP\n\nEverything you love about GTA—only with a touchscreen! Yep, Chinatown Wars has all the violence, crime, and lawless fuckery of the franchise in handheld form, with a charmingly retro return to the overhead perspective of the O.G. GTA games. The just-released PSP version has a lot to live up to.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe music in the opening titles is the song \"Chinatown Wars,\" by MF Doom and Ghostface. Gyeah!\n\n68. Serious Sam\n\nReleased: 2001\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Croteam for Gathering of Developers\n\nPlatform(s): 360, XBOX, PC\n\nA lamely-titled first person shooter from an obscure developer that was originally released only for PCs, SS became a juggernaut franchise based on depth of plot, gameplay, and humor (OK, maybe the name isn't so bad after all). Never to be confused with the Sean Penn flick I Am Sam (though released in the same year), Serious Sam still gets props as one of the best action-adventure games of the decade.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nDeveloper Croteam had only six employees and four contractors when Serious Sam was conceived and produced.\n\n67. NCAA Football 2004\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: EA Tiburon for EA Sports\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, GC\n\nThe NCAA Football franchise was always on the radar, but it was around the 2004 edition that we really became devotees. Maybe it was the addition of \"College Classics,\" or the improved create-a-school feature, or just the sheer depth of the game (downloading player names was a MUST)—whatever the case, we're indebted to the NCAA series for holding us down in the years when Madden sucked.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nOnly two players have appeared on the covers of both NCAA Football and Madden: Shaun Alexander (NCAA 2001, Madden 2007 ) and Larry Fitzgerald (NCAA 2005, Madden 10).\n\n66. God of War: Chains of Olympus\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Ready At Dawn Studios for Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nPlatform(s): PSP\n\nWe'd been playing a fuckload of Lumines on the PSP and waiting for another original title to knock our portable-gaming socks off when the good ol' God of War delivered. Chains of Olympus retains the franchise's epic battles, challenging puzzles, and addictive orb-collecting in handheld form, making our daily commute a breeze for most of 2008.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nAccording to game director Ru Weerasuriya, multiplayer and co-op modes had to be cut from the game due to time constraints.\n\n65. Ninja Gaiden\n\nReleased: 2004\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Team Ninja for Tecmo\n\nPlatform(s): PS3, XBOX\n\nNinja Gaiden is technically the prequel to the Nintendo games we grew up on, all grown-up and deadly on the first Xbox. More beheadings, please!\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe game was originally supposed to occur in the setting for Dead or Alive, until the producers decided it would be better to create its own world.\n\n64. Resident Evil Zero\n\nReleased: 2002\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Capcom for Capcom\n\nPlatform(s): GC, Wii\n\nThe first game to come out of Capcom and Nintendo's three-year exclusivity deal features a bevy of new goodies, including an all-new \"partner zapping system\" so players can play as both Rebecca and Billy throughout the entire game. Yet like Fox and Scully, for some reason Rebecca and Billy never smash. C'mon, people. It's stressful out here!\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThis was the last game in the series to use the original Resident Evil engine before it was completely revamped for Resident Evil 4.\n\n63. Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga\n\nReleased: 2007\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Aspyr Media for Eidos Interactive/LucasArts\n\nPlatform(s): XBOX, PS3, DS, Wii\n\nIt doesn't get better than being able to playing through every Star Wars movie, scene by scene, controlling any character from the Lucas universe. Except when everything is made out of Legos, forcing you to destroy and rebuild your way through the surprisingly witty game. Double nostalgia!\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nAfter the success of Star Wars, Lego adapted Batman and Indiana Jones into bricked-out versions. Lego Harry Potter has yet to come to fruition.\n\n62. Red Faction\n\nReleased: 2001\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Volition, Inc. for THQ\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, PC\n\nXbox launched with Halo and but PS2 gamers were stranded without a must-have FPS when their system came out. Red Faction changed all of that. Before online gaming became the dominant feature in console shooters, this game proved that a great storyline and a sick arsenal are all an FPS really needs.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe game is often remembered for its introduction of Geo-Mod technology, which allows for real-time destruction of environments.\n\n61. Okami\n\nReleased: 2006\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Clover Studio (PS2)/Ready at Dawn (Wii) for Capcom\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, Wii\n\nTraditional Japanese myths come to life in this adventure game with an original visual style, drawing influence from classical Asian ink and wash painting. Art further fuses with action when you use the \"Celestial Brush,\" where specific brush strokes draw actions and objects into existence. Banjo-Kazooie, this ain't.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nIGN named Okami \"Game of the Year\" in 2006.\n\n60. NHL 10\n\nReleased: 2009\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: EA Canada for EA Sports\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS3\n\nEA added on to the awesomeness of 09 with all-new board play, post-whistle scrums, and first-person fighting. Above all, it's the peerless gameplay that consistently makes EA's hockey title one of the best sports franchises running.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nEagles of Death Metal? Rancid? Nickelback? Yep, the NHL 10 soundtrack is about as white as it gets.\n\n59. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Nintendo EAD for Nintendo\n\nPlatform(s): GC\n\nThe tenth installment in the ubiquitous Zelda series, WW finds Link sailing around a bunch of islands in the Great Sea. Landlubbers and the easily bored complained about all the waterworks, but the game's cel-shading graphics gave the lil' homie new dimensions of gameplay and Wind Waker became the biggest pre-order title in Nintendo history.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nWind Waker is one of a small handful of games to receive a perfect rating from Famitsu magazine.\n\n58. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune\n\nReleased: 2007\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Naughty Dog for Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nPlatform(s): PS3\n\nBefore that guy from Canada was on most people's radars, Nathan Drake held it down for gamers with one of PS3's first killer apps. Shooters have been around forever, but Uncharted made the experience cinematic. The game is hella short but it's a blast while it lasts. That's what we told her, at least.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nA film adaption is rumored to be in the works. Somebody get Aubrey's agent on the phone!\n\n57. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter\n\nReleased: 2007\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Red Storm Entertainment for Ubisoft\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS3, PSP, XBOX, PC\n\nIt was a decent-at-best FPS on most platforms, but a triumph on the 360. A tactical shooter with a innovative cover system (sorry, Cliffy B), first- or third-person POV, and the usual Tom Clancy military espionage, this one made sure everything remained GRAW.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nMicrosoft made this game available on XBL's Games on Demand.\n\n56. Beyond Good & Evil\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Ubisoft Montpellier for Ubisoft\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, GC, PC\n\nA futuristic action-adventure featuring a female investigative reporter and her slightly Shrek-y boar sidekick, BG&E was a commercial flop upon its release but has since achieved cult status. Sorta like Devin the Dude's Just Tryin' Ta Live, except set on a mining planet 400 years in the future.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nBG&E was conceived as the first in a trilogy of games, but those plans were initially scrapped due to the original's commercial failure. However, a sequel is currently in the works.\n\n55. Diablo II\n\nReleased: 2000\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Blizzard North for Blizzard Ent.\n\nPlatform(s): PC\n\nBefore Blizzard completely zombified a nation of nerds with World of Warcraft, they turned the RPG world upside down with what was one of the first adventures geared toward online multiplayer play. Sound familiar? There's a reason it became the fastest-selling video game of all time—at least until a little company called Bungie came along.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nA million copies in two weeks may not sound that crazy, but it was enough for a Guinness World Record in 2000.\n\n54. Fable II\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Lionhead Studios for Microsoft Game Studios\n\nPlatform(s): 360\n\nIt's what every sequel should be—the original, only better. The second edition of this action-RPG has all the choose-your-own-adventure fun of the first but this time you can be a female and you can get STDs. Peter Molyneux, you did it again! You's a genius!\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nPETA named Fable II—which awards points for eating non-meat products—the most animal-friendly game of 2008.\n\n53. NFL 2K1\n\nReleased: 2000\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Visual Concepts for Sega\n\nPlatform(s): DC\n\nWhat's commonplace now was mind-blowing back then: seamless online play in a console sports game. Along with that groundbreaking feature, 2K1 is notable for its innovations to the passing game, including realistic pump fakes and distinctions between bullet and lob passes. EA was definitely paying attention.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe NFL signed an exclusive deal with EA in December 2004, effectively killing off all non-Madden football titles.\n\n52. Onimusha: Warlords\n\nReleased: 2001\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Capcom for Capcom\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, PC\n\nA samurai and a female ninja pursue a warlord in 16th-century Japan. It might be a Merchant Ivory movie if it wasn't so KATANA-SWINGINGLY KICKASS. Come for the swordplay, stay for the fighting-the-final-boss-while-wearing-a-panda-suit. Yeah, that's right.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nOriginally designed for the PlayStation (and moved to the PS2 when halfway through development), the game was made more difficult for its Xbox port under the name Genma Onimusha.\n\n51. SSX 3\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: EA Canada for EA Sports BIG\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, GC, GBA\n\nBefore the Tony Hawk series set the formula, skateboard video games were pretty hard to make, so snowboarding games presented an easy alternative for developers—similar trick combos, less complicated settings. For the sequel to Tricky, EA created a super-fun (if a bit bizarro) representation of snowboarding that's hard to put down once you get over the terrible music and over-the-top gameplay elements.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nPurchasing accessories in the game allows you to distinguish you character from others. Even in video games, you are what you consume.\n\n50. Metroid Fusion\n\nReleased: 2002\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Nintendo R&D1 for Nintendo\n\nPlatform(s): GBA\n\nThe fourth installment in the legendary Metroid series bears a strong resemblance to the O.G. classic Super Metroid on the SNES—and that's an effing great thing. You get the same Samus but all-new tricks as you battle a bizarro Samus in space while dealing with a parasitic virus that causes all sorts of intergalactic fuckery. Get ready, pop it, let's go!\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nMetroid Fusion is the first 2D Metroid game with animated cut scenes.\n\n49. Shadow Complex\n\nReleased: 2009\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Chair Entertainment for Microsoft Game Studios\n\nPlatform(s): 360\n\nUnashamedly inspired by SNES classic Super Metroid, this brought the HD era back to its 2D roots in spectacular fashion. The variety of weapons, abilities, and upgrades in this game (plus subterraneous scumbags to try them all out on) makes this the best side-scroller since, well, Super Metroid.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nIn the beginning of Shadow Complex's four-year development cycle, developer Chair mapped the entire game out on graph paper and played it out to make sure everything worked. Analog style, FTW.\n\n48. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\n\nReleased: 2002\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Rockstar North for Rockstar Games\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, PC\n\nRockstar's follow-up to GTAIII pays homage to the drug trafficking decadence of '80s Miami, inspired by Miami Vice (the TV series, not the flaccid Colin Farrell version) and Scarface. Want to flood the country with yayo? Now you can! This is how Officer Rawse did it, too.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nStar-studded Vice City features Ray Liotta as the protagonist, parolee Tommy Vercetti, as well as Dennis Hopper, Burt Reynolds, Luis Guzmán, Danny Trejo, Gary Busey, Jenna Jameson, and Philip Michael Thomas, who played Tubbs on Miami Vice.\n\n47. Perfect Dark\n\nReleased: 2000\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Rare for Nintendo\n\nPlatform(s): 360, N64\n\nThe spiritual descendant of the legendary GoldenEye 007, PD took its predecessor's classic FPS format to the 20th century with high-resolution graphics and a Dolby Surround Sound system that were revolutionary for their times. You can have Lara Croft any day, we're still riding for Joanna Dark.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nPD was the last major first-person shooter to come out for the Nintendo 64.\n\n46. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\n\nReleased: 2006\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Bethesda Softworks for 2K Games\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS3, PC\n\nSwords and sorcery and social awkwardness were always well-repped by the Elder Scrolls franchise, but it wasn't until you had to go to hell and back to save the world that things achieved classic status. Huge open-world RPG adventure with high-def slaughter galore.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe game's rating was changed from \"T\" to \"M\" a month after release when a mod was discovered for the PC version that allows you to play with topless female characters.\n\n45. Shenmue\n\nReleased: 2000\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: SEGA-AM2 for Sega\n\nPlatform(s): DC\n\nWith its fascinating open world and realistic weather effects, Shenmue was clearly ahead of its time. (And costing a reported $70 million, it certainly should've been.) But more than any gameplay element, it's the compelling story of a teenager avenging his father's death that sticks with us to this day. Well, that and a seriously awesome score.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nRyo was also a playable character in Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing.\n\n44. FIFA 09\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: EA Canada for EA Sports\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS3, Wii, PS2, PC, PSP, DS\n\nFIFA already had the kit and stadium licenses, but it took the fútbol gaming trophy with improved ball-touch (pause), a collision, and jostling system that accounted for size differences (Freddy Adu ain't pushing anybody off a ball), user-controlled goal celebrations (especially fun against a human opponent), and updates based on real-world player performances. Floors you like a slide tackle.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nAlthough the game's tagline is \"Let's FIFA 09!\", FIFA is not an actual verb, it's an acronym for soccer's governing body: Federation Internationale de Football Association. Damned educational system's gone to shit.\n\n43. Super Mario Sunshine\n\nReleased: 2002\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Nintendo EAD for Nintendo\n\nPlatform(s): GC\n\nThe GameCube's only real Mario adventure, Sunshine is essentially a prettier version of Super Mario 64, but with a few cool new tricks and treats. Especially neat and really fun are the 2.5D platforming levels that are interspersed throughout the games 3D core—the remixed renditions of the classic Super Mario Bros. themes that play throughout these levels are pretty much the shit too.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nNintendo spent a few months of development on the prototyping of Sunshine's main gameplay mechanics before deciding that this would actually be a Mario game.\n\n42. Dynasty Warriors 2\n\nReleased: 2000\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Omega Force for KOEI\n\nPlatform(s): PS2\n\nLoosely based on ancient Chinese history, this epic hack-and-slash game was one of the PS2's launch titles. Its stunning graphics and chaotic crowd battles set a new standard for third-person fighters early in the new decade.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe game's eight stages are based on one fictional battle and seven real-life clashes, fought during the lead up to China's Three Kingdoms period, from 184 to 234.\n\n41. Rayman 2: The Great Escape\n\nReleased: 1999\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Ubisoft for Ubisoft\n\nPlatform(s): PS, PS2, DC, PC, DS, GBC\n\nThough debuting a little bit earlier on the N64 (and also appearing later on the PS2), it's without a doubt the Dreamcast version of this title that really delivered the goods. One of the first truly great-looking games of the last gen, the limbless wonder's second adventure filled a crucial gap in the years between Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nRayman 2 was initially planned to appear only on the original PlayStation and Saturn.\n\n40. Indigo Prophecy\n\nReleased: 2005\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Quantic Dream for Atari\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, PC\n\nAdventure games received a serious defibrillation from French outfit Quantic Dream in the fall of '05 with this cinematic, emotionally deep game. For fans of the genre, playing this paranormal thriller was as revolutionary as that first time playing King's Quest, with innovations that include creative usage of both analog sticks and a meter that measures mental health.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nKnown as Fahrenheit outside North America, publisher Atari pushed the name change due to fears of being confused with Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11.\n\n39. The Warriors\n\nReleased: 2005\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Rockstar Toronto for Rockstar Games\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, PSP\n\nBringing the beat-em-up back to the limelight, Rockstar's love letter to the classic late-'70s film represents its most singularly cohesive and fully-realized vision to date. With its retro-informed, reinvented brawling gameplay and expansive (but never overwhelming) levels, this is open-world done right. We can dig it.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nRoger Hill, who plays Cyrus in the film, sued Take-Two Interactive for $250,000 for using his voice and likeness.\n\n38. Fallout 3\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Bethesda Game Studios for Bethesda Softworks\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS3, PC\n\nPerfectly tuned dark humor means fighting your way through post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. was never so much fun (or so similar to fighting your way through regular D.C.!). Sure, the RPG system ensures that your actions could come back to haunt you, but that doesn't mean you can't still blow people's heads off and put them up on a shelf!\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nWhen you kill a Mister Gutsy robot in the game, its dying words are the marching chant from Full Metal Jacket. Fucking fun!\n\n37. Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2004\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: EA for EA Sports\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, GC, PC, GBA\n\nThe sixth edition in the Woods franchise built on the successes of the '03 model (namely the analog swing) with an additional seven courses and the appearance of a playable John Daly character. And unlike the real Daly, you could hit the links swigging Jack-and-Cokes and chain-smoking Marlboros and nobody would bat an eye.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nDue to the game's 19 courses, the GameCube version of TWPT had to be spread over two discs.\n\n36. Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem\n\nReleased: 2002\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Silicon Knights for Nintendo\n\nPlatform(s): GC\n\nSorta like The Da Vinci Code (minus lots of reading and/or watching Tom Hanks' shriveled dickface), Eternal Darkness centers on an ancient book that sets off a series of time-traveling adventures. Intricate, heady, and seriously effed-up (said tome is made of human flesh and bone), EDkept you up all night—no Viagra needed.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nED was the first game published directly by Nintendo (not a third-party developer) to receive an \"M\" from the Entertainment Software Rating Board.\n\n35. Shadow of the Colossus\n\nReleased: 2005\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: TEAM ICO for Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nPlatform(s): PS2\n\nThis game transcends all expectations, defies traditional controls, and advances an entirely new narrative logic. Shadow of the Colossus takes the familiar princess-in-peril storyline and works it into a landscape where you and your horse travel over a vacant countryside, searching for the misunderstood giants that you must climb to oxygen-deprived heights to destroy. Your morality as a character is challenged throughout this emotional trek—call us soft but it definitely got a little dusty in the room by journey's end.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe viral marketing campaign for Shadow led people to websites claiming that the remains of five giants resembling certain colossi had been discovered in various parts of the world.\n\n34. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess\n\nReleased: 2006\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Nintendo EAD for Nintendo\n\nPlatform(s): Wii, GC\n\nWhile there aren't many Zelda titles to pick from in the Aughts, this one would merit recognition on any list. We're already used to Link saving the Princess and Hyrule while fighting foes and demons, but this time around things are a little darker. Twilight Princess delivers what other Zelda games have lacked—a sense of maturity and seriousness.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nTwilight Princess was originally slated to be released in 2005 with the title The Wind Waker 2.\n\n33. Wii Sports\n\nReleased: 2006\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Nintendo EAD for Nintendo\n\nPlatform(s): Wii\n\nHaving Wii Sports as the Wii launch title was both a gift and curse for Nintendo. It was a gift because the interactive tennis, bowling, and golf fully exploited the unique capabilities of the innovative new console—but it was also a curse because many Wii owners never felt the need to buy another game.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nIn some rehabilitation centers around the world, Wii Sports has been used as a means of physical therapy.\n\n32. Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Kojima Productions for Konami\n\nPlatform(s): PS3\n\nTen years after Metal Gear Solid (and 20 after the original Metal Gear) came what was arguably the most cinematic PS3 title ever. Stealth, humor, epic cut-scenes, and plenty of jungle action for your beloved Snake. Wait, that came out wrong.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nA Little Big Planet expansion pack featured skins based on Old Snake, Raiden, Meryl, and Screaming Mantis. Sack up and play!\n\n31. Final Fantasy X\n\nReleased: 2001\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Square for Square EA\n\nPlatform(s): PS2\n\nAlmost every previous Final Fantasy, especially the three on PS1, were incredibly well-received. By late 2001, RPG-fanatics were eager to see how the franchise would transition to PS2. Square delivered by upping the ante in every way possible: better graphics, storytelling, and combat system. Now when people debate over which Final Fantasy is the illest, FFX is usually at the top of the list.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nFFX had a budget of over $30 million.\n\n30. Fight Night Round 3\n\nReleased: 2006\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: EA Chicago for EA Sports\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS3, PS2, XBOX, PSP\n\nThe Xbox 360 had been out for almost three months before the release of a game that truly flexed its next-gen capabilities—and that game was Fight Night Round 3. The actual boxing gameplay isn't significantly different from past editions—read: fun as shit—but it's the HD blood, sweat, and tears that elevate FNR3 to an all-time champ.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe Burger King \"King\" appears in the game as a selectable trainer.\n\n29. Deus Ex\n\nReleased: 2000\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Ion Storm for Eidos Interactive\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, PC\n\nThe thrilling paranoia in Warren Spector's RPG/FPS/stealth/action/adventure magnum opus has yet to be matched since its release at the beginning of the decade. This genre-bending title is as thought-provoking as it is fun.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nEven though it came out pre-9/11, Deux Ex has a skyline without the trade towers; the game's backstory reveals that they were destroyed by terrorists. Let's hope the developers weren't as prescient with the game's pandemic plot line.\n\n28. Metroid Prime\n\nReleased: 2002\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Retro Studios, Inc. for Nintendo\n\nPlatform(s): GC\n\nAlmost a decade after Super Metroid captivated millions of SNES gamers, Nintendo followed up with the series' first 3D game and gave owners of the struggling GameCube something to be happy about. The first-person perspective is a bit weird at first, but after a little time with this outer-space epic, it quickly becomes a non-issue. The plot is kinda weak, but the action is a prime example of the genre's best.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nAn enhanced Japanese version of the game was released for the Wii in 2009.\n\n27. Kingdom Hearts\n\nReleased: 2002\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Square for Square Electronic Arts\n\nPlatform(s): PS2\n\nOkay, so a Square Enix x Disney collabo seems a bit childish, but don't front, this game is a classic. You play as Sora, a boy separated from his friends who has to travel throughout the Disney universes to find them. KH has it all: stunning cut scenes, fluid motion, epic battles, a rewarding storyline, and just the right balance of action and RPG. We won't tell anyone that it's one of your favorites, too.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe hypnotizing theme for the game was composed and performed by Japanese pop singer Utada Hikaru.\n\n26. Little Big Planet\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Media Molecule for Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nPlatform(s): PS3\n\nWe've called a lot of people \"sackboy\" before, but never with the kind of affection we reserve for one of the most perversely charming platformers we've ever seen. Peerless level editing and continuous user patches have given the puzzle-heavy winner the longevity to make it one of the PS3's standout surprises.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nLevel editing is great and all, but there are enough dick jokes and terrorist attacks to make you think twice.\n\n25. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3\n\nReleased: 2001\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Neversoft for Activision\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, GB, PS, N64, PC, GBA, GBC\n\nThe third edition of the THPS series is clearly the best. Spending hours to personalize your skater is well worth it when you get to reap the benefits of that immensely satisfying \"grab trick + revert + manual + pivot + flip trick + grinding + etc. etc. = 1,000,000,000,000 points\" system. No matter how ridiculous the combo, it makes us all feel great knowing that we're way better at Tony Hawk's Pro Skater than actual skating. Well, it actually makes us feel like posers, but it's all good.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nWe've seen a lot of cool secret characters in games, but skating with Wolverine and Darth Maul in THPS3 might take the cake.\n\n24. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\n\nReleased: 2004\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Rockstar North for Rockstar Games\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS2, XBOX, PC\n\nWhile it had a lot to live up to, San Andreas more than met expectations. As Carl \"CJ\" Johnson, you leave Liberty City to return home to Los Santos to face a broken gang, dirty cops (one voiced by none other than Samuel L. Jackson), and never-ending drama. This installment introduces aircraft-jacking, swimming, bigger and better guns, and an awesome sense of '90s G-Funk-era nostalgia. All that, and 13.9 square miles to terrorize. Chronic!\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\n\"Hot Coffee,\" yeah? So drive-by shootings and killing cops is fine, but a little sex scene is gonna ruin the youth? Wow, America. Your priorities are screwed up.\n\n23. Super Mario Galaxy\n\nReleased: 2007\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Nintendo EAD Tokyo for Nintendo\n\nPlatform(s): Wii\n\nThe first Mario game developed for the Wii literally blasts you into space to explore 42 galaxies filled with hundreds of planets, each with their own eco-system, enemies, and gravity. Its innovative physics system gives you the ability to jump between and fully circumvent the spherical 3D planets. Hands down the best Wii game ever.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nSuper Mario Galaxy 2, a harder, more involved sequel, got a 2010 release.\n\n22. Max Payne\n\nReleased: 2001\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Remedy Entertainment for Gathering of Developers & Rockstar Games\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, PC, GBA\n\nLike an interactive version of The Matrix, this single-handedly brought bullet-time to video games. The unparalleled action set to a graphic novel-stylized noir plot and scummy NYC-underbelly backdrop made for an offer that you couldn't refuse.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nAfter releasing '03's Max Payne 2, Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment began work on Xbox 360 exclusive Alan Wake, which was released in early 2010.\n\n21. Madden NFL 2004\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: EA Tiburon for EA Sports\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, GC, PS, GBA, PC\n\nThe last great last-gen Madden before EA's early stumbles with its next-gen offerings, the 2004 edition introduced right-analog \"playmaker\" controls (allowing you to make on-the-spot adjustments during gameplay) and an in-depth ownership mode. Who knew setting concession prices could be so fun?\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nCover athlete Michael Vick has a speed rating of 95, the highest ever for a QB at the time. We're sure that served him well in the bing.\n\n20. Counter-Strike\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Valve for Microsoft Game Studios\n\nPlatform(s): XBOX, PC\n\nIt was originally a Half-Life mod, but Valve went ahead and officialized this tactical FPS for general commercial release—and that was all she wrote. Not only is it still played six years after release, but it boasts one of the most insanely dedicated user communities of all time. Blucka blucka!\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nPolice officers in the Chinese city of Tianjin played CS as part of their anti-terrorist training.\n\n19. Left 4 Dead\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Valve for EA/Valve\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PC\n\nThe only way to survive the zombie apocalypse in this disturbing cooperative FPS is to kill in concert with three other survivors (and not accidentally buck them down). There's no \"i\" in team, but there are two in \"eaten alive by zombies.\" And three in \"fucking sick shit!\"\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nArtificial intelligence detects how easily you're advancing and will adjust the number and type of zombies attacking you to keep things interesting.\n\n18. BioShock\n\nReleased: 2007\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: 2K Boston for 2K Games\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS3, PC\n\nThis intelligent and freaky first-person shooter follows a plane crash survivor exploring a mysterious underwater \"utopia\" populated by mutated creatures and mech-monsters. You know a game's scary when you need the lights on and somebody next to you to play it without shitting yourself. Well, either that or you're just one big, cowardly bitch.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nJuan Carlos Fresnadillo, director of 28 Weeks Later, worked on a film adaptation that was slated for 2010 release. Unfortunately, the project stalled and became mired in developmental hell.\n\n17. Far Cry\n\nReleased: 2004\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Crytek for Ubisoft\n\nPlatform(s): XBOX, PC\n\nJack Carver x archipelago x female journalist = vacation! Except, of course, for the weaponizing of genetic engineering, the genocide of local islanders, and the deformed creatures created by a mad scientist named Krieger. This puppy had it all: beaches, rain forests, canyons, mines, swamps, and volcanoes, oh my. FPS dopeness.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe original PC version features many more extensive worlds that the Xbox didn’t have the juice to handle.\n\n16. Halo 2\n\nReleased: 2004\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Bungie Studios for Microsoft Game Studios\n\nPlatform(s): XBOX, PC\n\n\"But...but...what about Halo 3! It's the newest version, yo!\" Step off noobs, we call the shots on this list. While Halo 3 is definitely entertaining, its impact doesn't come close to last gen's Halo 2. Innovative graphics? Check. Cool soundtrack? Check. Dope story? Check. Wielding the dual machine gun and staying up nights blasting fools online? Muthafuckin' check! Halo 2 changed our lives and changed gaming. Enough said.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nHalo 2 closes on a cliffhanger, but it wasn't the intended ending. Developers planned to offer closure to the story but had to improvise because of a rushed schedule.\n\n15. Grand Theft Auto IV\n\nReleased: 2008\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Rockstar North for Rockstar Games\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS3, PC\n\nBosnian war vet and illegal immigrant Niko comes to Liberty City (a painstakingly meticulous rendering of NYC) to flee the drama in his homeland. Thankfully he finds no peace in LC, 'cause we have far too much fun using him to blow up cop cars, steal fly whips (and choppers...and boats...and aircrafts), and smash women with low self-esteem. No wonder this franchise is the gaming voice of a (de)generation.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nGTA IV is the first game in the series in which hookers actually do their damn job and don't sit motionlessly in the seat next to you after taking your money.\n\n14. NBA 2K2\n\nReleased: 2001\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Visual Concepts for SEGA\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, GC, DC\n\nThey might add graphical bells and whistles every year, but the core gameplay of the consistently impressive 2K franchise has barely changed from the 2002 edition, which basically set the benchmark for all hoops titles to follow. It's why many still claim—including us—that 2K2 is the best basketball game ever.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nIverson appears on the cover of the first five NBA 2K games. Damn, he used to be good.\n\n13. Guitar Hero II\n\nReleased: 2006\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Harmonix Music Systems for Activision/ Red Octane\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS2\n\nGuitar Hero II was the Harmonix dudes' last stand before they said \"eff it\" and jumped ship to MTV to go after the whole pie with Rock Band. GHII is a classic because it got all the kinks figured out, the extras locked in, and the greatest songs tapped (\"Sweet Child O' Mine,\" \"Free Bird,\" \"War Pigs\"). Everything after this was cool, but just unnecessary. DJ Hero? We'll reserve judgment on that for now.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nTo play the secret Air Guitar version on the 360, enter Yellow, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Yellow, Blue at the main menu.\n\n12. The Orange Box\n\nReleased: 2007\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Valve Corporation for EA\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS3, PC\n\nTwenty bones for three of the most innovative games ever within their respective genres (Half-Life 2 as a single-player FPS, Portal as a puzzler, and Team Fortress 2 as team-based multiplayer)? Well, that about settles it: the cake is NOT a lie.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nPortal's end credits song, \"Still Alive,\" made its way to Rock Band. So GLaDOS we maaaaade it!\n\n11. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: BioWare for LucasArts\n\nPlatform(s): XBOX, PC\n\nThe Star Wars universe is ripe with infinite possibilities, and Bioware took full advantage in developing one of the Xbox's most memorable titles and probably the best Star Wars game ever. Set 4,000 years before the Vader era, the RPG's storyline presents a much-needed jolt of originality while paying strong tribute to the endless battle of Jedi and Sith. Way, way, way better than Hayden Christensen and co. did, that's for sure.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nKOTOR is based on the third-edition Dungeons & Dragons role-playing system. If you already knew that, you're even a bigger geek than we are.\n\n10. God of War\n\nReleased: 2005\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: SCE Studios Santa Monica for Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nPlatform(s): PS3, PS2\n\nIn this classic third-person action-adventure, mere mortal Kratos goes on an epic journey to kill Ares, the god of war (and the sadistic fuck who tricked Kratos into slaying his own family while working as his servant). This title set the standard for modern hack-and-slash fun, so much so that \"God of War-esque\" has become a popular adjective to describe promising new titles in the genre. Unlike old Greek women's mustaches, this mythology is fun to brush up on.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nA God of War movie was originally slated for 2010 release, but never came to pass.\n\n9. Madden 10\n\nReleased: 2009\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: EA Tiburon for EA Sports\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS3, Wii, PS2, PSP\n\nIt's hard to pick one Madden above the others as the decade's best, but most devotees regard this year's edition as the franchise's pinnacle. It took about four years, but EA finally mastered the next gen with a no-frills, no-bullshit title that makes solid gameplay—not gratuitous new features—its cornerstone. No matter what type of Madden player you are, there's no doubt that you love this game.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\n10 is the first Madden to feature two cover athletes (Troy Polamalu and Larry Fitzgerald). Polamalu sprained his MCL in the Steelers' season opener, ensuring the Madden Curse lived on.\n\n8. Mass Effect\n\nReleased: 2007\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: BioWare for Microsoft\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PC\n\nSci-fi games normally come with noisy fanfare, ludicrous weapons, gimmicky boss fights, and plots that are about as scientific as creationist theories. Mass Effect feels like you've been beamed into an involving serial drama with real intrigue, compelling dialogue with multiple-choice consequential actions, open environments, and escalating tension, all while feeding our basic human need to kill things that look different than us. It's a classic, kids.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nFox News and others decried the brief, non-explicit sex scenes in ME; a New York Times article on the controversy compared the raciness of the ME scenes to what is regularly shown on network prime-time television.\n\n7. Rock Band\n\nReleased: 2007\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Harmonix Music Systems for MTV Games\n\nPlatform(s): 360, Wii, PS2, PS3, PSP\n\nGuitar Hero was a very big stepping stone into the world of music games, but it left us wanting more. Thankfully, Rock Band filled the void. With two guitars, a drum set, and a microphone, the game became a cultural phenomenon that appealed to music heads, families that don't hate each other, and people in Toledo who need entertainment on Friday nights. So while GH may have opened the door, RB set the bar. And it didn't even have to resort to homoerotic ads with Kobe and A-Rod!\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nPlayers made more than 30 million song purchases of Rock Band's 600-plus downloadable tracks.\n\n6. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Ubisoft Montreal for Ubisoft\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, GC, PC, GBA\n\nQuite possibly the best-designed game of the last gen, PoP masters the platforming gameplay tropes of years past with the technical brilliance of modern 3D systems and the sheer fluid awesomeness of motion and movement at play—but basically, we just love fucking with the space-time continuum. Even Jake Gyllenhaal on HGH can't ruin this one.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nThe Sands of Time was developed by essentially the same team responsible for Splinter Cell.\n\n5. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare\n\nReleased: 2007\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Infinity Ward for Activision\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PS3, Wii, PC\n\nThwarting rebel leaders as USMC and SAS soldiers in storyline mode is entertaining, but this beautiful first person shooter's multiplayer action is what really bangs. Get up with your boys online to shoot the fuck out of contemporary war zones in the Middle East and Eastern Europe and make it a real gangbang! Now that's modern warfare.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nTechnically the eighth Call of Duty game, Modern Warfare is the first to not be set in World War II—which is dope, 'cause Hitler died a long fucking time ago.\n\n4. Resident Evil 4\n\nReleased: 2005\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Capcom Production Studio 4 for Capcom\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, GC, Wii, PC\n\nRare is the game that takes an established, much-loved series and rips out its guts and reanimates it into an unbeatable classic. The movement is fluid, the atmosphere and intensity is ratcheted up, and the storyline is more cinematic than most multiplex offerings. Add hundreds of crazed, blank-eyed townies who will stop at nothing to lay their grimy hands on you, and you have the best RE ever. And that's saying something.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nRE4 was originally to feature regular zombies as bad guys, but to avoid repeating formula, developers decided to make plagas-possessed humans (called \"Los Ganados\") the enemies.\n\n3. Gears of War\n\nReleased: 2006\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Epic Games for Microsoft\n\nPlatform(s): 360, PC\n\nIn this gory third-person shooter, grizzled Delta Squad soldiers on the planet Sera fight the Locust Horde, a nasty subterranean species that emerged to wipe out humanity. The importance of taking cover and moving strategically is awesome, but really it all boils down to two words: chainsaw bayonet!\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nMarcus Fenix, the game's protagonist, was voiced by John DiMaggio, who also lent his voice to Bender on Futurama.\n\n2. Halo: Combat Evolved\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Bungie Studios for Microsoft Game Studios\n\nPlatform(s): XBOX, PC\n\nBefore Halo, anything by Microsoft was pretty much a joke. After Halo...well, there's the Zune. OK, not really, but this now-legend FPS was Bill Gates' moment in the gaming sun, and was the title that finally made that gigantic controller make sense. It's actually a love/hate relationship, because we aren't really sure if we're gonna need those hundreds of hours of our lives back. Break out the bong. Discuss.\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nTwo friends from the University of Chicago started Halo's parent company, Bungie, in 1991. It had a series of \"eh\" moments until it was acquired by Microsoft in 2000 to make the game that would launch the Xbox.\n\n1. Grand Theft Auto III\n\nReleased: 2001\n\nDeveloper/Publisher: Rockstar North for Rockstar Games\n\nPlatform(s): PS2, XBOX, PC\n\nIt is the single most technically significant video game since Super Mario 64 successfully moved games into the 3D-era. GTA III will forever be remembered for being the first of its kind to give players a nigh unbreakable illusion of playing in a living, breathing, and utterly foul world—almost a decade and one next gen later, modern gaming is still the house that GTA built (and then threw a Molotov cocktail through).\n\nYOU AUGHTA KNOW:\n\nRockstar delayed GTA III's release by three weeks (to October 22, 2001) to edit out material it was concerned might be seen as insensitive of the 9/11 attacks."
