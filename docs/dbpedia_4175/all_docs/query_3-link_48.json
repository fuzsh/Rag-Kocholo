        "text": "Adam Green is an American screenwriter, director, producer, and actor known for his success within the horror genre with films like the \"Hatchet\" franchise, \"Frozen,\" and \"Digging Up The Marrow.\" He is also the creator, writer, director, star, and show runner of the television comedy series \"Holliston\" and the singer for the metal band \"Haddonfield.\"\n\nBorn and raised in the small town of Holliston, Massachusetts, Green grew up performing leading roles in school plays and hosting his own morning radio program \"Coffee & Donuts\" on the town's local radio station. He graduated from Holliston High School in 1993. Upon graduating from Hofstra University in New York with a Bachelor of Science in film and television production in 1997, Green landed a job producing and directing local and regional cable television commercials at Time Warner Cable Advertising back in his hometown of Boston. While working at Time Warner he met cinematographer Will Barratt and in 1998 the two formed their own production company ArieScope Pictures and began making short films together under the ArieScope banner. During this time period Green was also the lead singer for the hard rock/metal band \"Haddonfield\" which amassed a large and loyal following as they headlined weekly club shows in Salam, MA and other large venues around Boston's north shore in the late 90's. In 1999 at the age of 24, Green wrote, directed, and starred in his first feature film \"Coffee & Donuts\" which was based on his own life and his experiences chasing his career dreams while trying to get over the break-up with his first girlfriend/childhood love. The autobiographical comedy was made for only $400 by \"borrowing\" Time Warner's commercial production equipment after hours and ultimately gained the attention of United Talent Agency (UTA) in Los Angeles when it won \"Best Picture\" in (what was then called) The Smoky Mountain Film Festival. Signed by UTA as an official client, Green moved to Los Angeles in February of 2000 with the intention of turning \"C&D\" into a sit-com.\n\nThough reactions were positive and interest in \"Coffee & Donuts\" was strong within the industry, Green's first three years in Los Angeles were a major struggle and he survived by doing any odd job that would pay or feed him. Though he was able to find occasional paid work as everything from an on-set production assistant, to performing as a stand-up comic, to working as a writer's/show runner's assistant, to performing as an extra/background, to writing, shooting, and editing local cable commercials, to ghost writing jokes for other stand-up comics, Green's main occupation from 2000 to 2003 was working as the DJ in the upstairs nightclub at the world famous Rainbow Bar and Grill where he survived off of the left-over food off of customer's plates or by eating out of the restaurant's trash at the end of each night. He performed stand-up comedy at various Hollywood night clubs including monthly comedy shows at the Rainbow with his regular troupe of comedians/friends that included comics Andy Sandberg, Chris Romano, and Eric Falconer whom had also all yet to be discovered at that time. In 2003 Green sold \"Coffee & Donuts\" as a sit-com to Touchstone/UPN with Tom Shadyac producing. However, the week after Green delivered the final draft of his pilot script for \"Coffee & Donuts\", UPN announced a merger with the WB (creating the CW network) and all of UPN's pilot development was scrapped, tying up the rights to Green's dream project and life story for a further 5 years. (\"C&D\" would wind up going through thirteen years of development and false starts due to random corporate mergers at various networks and studios before eventually coming to fruition as the television series \"Holliston\" in 2012.)\n\nGreen first gained worldwide recognition with his independent slasher comedy \"Hatchet\", a story and character (\"Victor Crowley\") that he had first come up with while at summer sleep away camp in 1983 when he was just 8 years old in an effort to scare the other children in his cabin. Written in 2003 while Green was spinning heavy metal records in the DJ booth at the Rainbow, \"Hatchet\" was filmed independently in May/June of 2005 and had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 27, 2006. Green spent the next 18 months traveling the world with his gruesome slasher/comedy as it played dozens of film festivals, winning a multitude of awards and accumulating incredibly positive reviews from critics and fans along the way. \"Hatchet\" received a US theatrical release through Anchor Bay on September 7, 2007 and introduced the world to the iconic villain \"Victor Crowley.\" A worldwide success, \"Hatchet\" has spawned three sequels to date. Green wrote and directed \"Hatchet 2\" which arrived in US theaters on October 1, 2010 and he also wrote and produced \"Hatchet 3\" (2013) which opened in US theaters on June 14, 2013.\n\nAfter the first \"Hatchet\" film was massively censored by the Motion Picture Association of America for its 2007 theatrical release, Green made international headlines in 2010 by standing up to the MPAA's archaic and secretive ratings system and refusing to accept the organization's arbitrary NC-17 rating for \"Hatchet 2\" which the filmmaker stated was completely unfair given the comedic tone of his film and in comparison to the serious torture porn style films of the time, many of which featured sequences of rape and mean spirited, realistic violence but which also happened to be distributed by major studios. After offering cuts and re-submitting \"Hatchet 2\" to the MPAA numerous times to no avail in an effort to try and find a compromise for an \"R\" rating, Green and distributor Dark Sky ultimately opted to release the \"Hatchet 2\" uncut through an arrangement with AMC cinemas, making it the first genre film in almost 30 years to be released in mainstream multiplexes without an MPAA rating. Though the unrated release of \"Hatchet 2\" was endorsed and conducted exclusively through AMC theaters, the chain immediately began pulling the film from all screens upon its midnight opening and within just 48 hours of its release the film had mysteriously disappeared from all AMC screens nationwide. Though journalists in the media pointed to outside pressure from the MPAA on AMC to pull the film, no explanation was ever given on official record by a proper representative of AMC and the MPAA refused to comment on the matter. With \"Hatchet 3\" being green-lit almost immediately after \"Hatchet 2\" arrived on home video, \"Victor Crowley\" still succeeded despite the AMC/MPAA debacle.\n\nThough \"Hatchet\" was always intended to be a trilogy, on August 22, 2017 Green took the entire genre world by surprise when he suddenly showed a 4th \"Hatchet\" film (titled \"Victor Crowley\") to a sold-out audience of fans that thought they had gathered at the Arclight Cinema in Hollywood, CA to watch a 10th anniversary screening of the original film. Written and directed by Green, \"Victor Crowley\" was made in complete secrecy over a two year period as the filmmaker's surprise to the fans (known as the \"Hatchet Army\") on the 10th anniversary of the original \"Hatchet.\" The stunt worked famously and \"Victor Crowley\" was trending #5 in the world on social media on the night of its surprise premiere in Hollywood, CA - two spots above Marvel's star-studded A-list celebrity attended \"Stan Lee Celebration\" that was taking place that same night. Green immediately began a worldwide tour with the film that started just three nights later in London, England and carried on through cities in Germany, Canada, and all across the United States (where the tour was dubbed the \"Dismember America Tour\") until the middle of November. By the end of the tour \"Victor Crowley\" had played nightly in 57 cities and 4 countries with Green personally appearing and speaking at most of the screenings. To date \"Victor Crowley\" is the best reviewed of the four \"Hatchet\" films and the most financially successful film in the franchise since the original. Three months after the theatrical release, the film was released on home video on February 6, 2018. In the weeks leading up to the home video release \"Victor Crowley\" was the #3 best seller on Amazon.com and among the top 10 most pre-ordered Blu-Rays worldwide ranking above wide release studio films like \"Justice League,\" \"Blade Runner,\" \"Jigsaw,\" and \"Get Out\" further solidifying the \"Hatchet\" franchise's villain \"Victor Crowley\" as a modern day horror icon.\n\n\"Hatchet\" also earned Green his place in the \"Splat Pack\", a term coined by esteemed UK film critic Alan Jones to describe a core group of new genre filmmakers who brought practical effects and extreme violence/gore back to the horror genre in the mid 2000's. Heralded by Jones as \"the next wave of genre filmmakers,\" his original article about the \"Splat Pack\" ran in Total Film magazine in April of 2006 and by October both Time Magazine and the New York Post had also published stories about the \"Splat Pack.\" Green appeared in the 2010 documentary \"The Splat Pack\" that also featured extensive interviews with his fellow \"Splat Pack\" members Eli Roth, Neil Marshall, Darren Bousman, Alex Aja, and Greg McLean. (Missing from the documentary were \"Splat Pack\" members James Wan and Rob Zombie.) Various merchandise based on \"Hatchet\" and its iconic villain \"Victor Crowley\" continues to sell more and more each year and in August of 2015 the first widely distributed \"Victor Crowley\" Halloween mask hit retail shelves across America, selling out of stock nationwide long before the Halloween holiday had arrived. In 2011 \"Victor Crowley\" first appeared in comic book form in \"Hatchet/Slash\", a crossover comic between Green's \"Hatchet\" films and Tim Seeley's long-running \"Hack/Slash\" comic series. In October of 2016 the first issue of the official \"Hatchet\" comic hit retail stores and the series has continued on strong with a new issue being released every 3-4 months. Green's first novel, the \"Hatchet\" tie-in \"I, Survivor\" will be released in May of 2018. \"I, Survivor\" first appeared in \"Victor Crowley\" as a fictitious autobiography written by the film's main character \"Andrew Yong,\" however Green and author Joe Knetter co-wrote the actual book so that fans could delve even further into the \"Hatchet\" universe and fill in the ten years that had passed in the storyline between \"Hatchet 3\" and \"Victor Crowley.\"\n\nAside from \"Hatchet\" (2007) and its three sequels (2010, 2013, 2017), Green continued and diversified his filmmaking legacy by directing the award winning Hitchcockian psycho-drama \"Spiral\" (2008), by producing the Sundance shocker and critically acclaimed \"Grace\" (2009), by writing and directing another Sundance darling and global success the very next year with his snowy suspense thriller \"Frozen\" (2010), by producing, writing, and directing the comedy \"The Diary of Anne Frankenstein\" which was included as part of the drive-in anthology film \"Chillerama\" (2011), and by writing, directing, and starring in the genre bending and highly praised successful pseudo-documentary \"Digging Up The Marrow\" (2015). In between his feature films Green also continued to write and direct various short films for his ArieScope website just for fun, several of which went on to become full blown viral hits with millions of views on-line including \"Jack Chop,\" \"Fairy Tale Police,\" and \"Saber.\" Written, directed, and edited by Green, \"Saber\" received two awards in Lucasfilm's annual Star Wars Fan Film Awards at San Diego Comic-Con in 2009 (\"Best Action\" and \"Audience Choice\") and also spawned two sequels that were released to huge success in 2012 and 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, after thirteen years of development and setbacks due to network mergers, in 2011 Green's ultimate passion project \"Coffee & Donuts\" was finally brought to fruition as the sit-com \"Holliston.\" In its new form, Green was not only \"Holliston's\" creator but also the series' show-runner, writer, director, and main star. Licensed for broadcast by the FEARnet cable network, \"Holliston\" had its world television premiere on April 3, 2012 and quickly found a loyal audience. A second season was announced the morning after only the second episode had aired. An hour-long \"Holliston Christmas Special\" premiered later that same year on December 18th and is still considered by most fans to be their favorite episode of the series with its unexpected amount of emotion including a tear-jerking final scene between \"Adam\" and \"Corri\" that was revealed on the Blu-ray commentary track to have been completely improvised by actors Adam Green and Corri English. Season 2 of \"Holliston\" premiered on June 4, 2013 and further solidified the series as a hit despite FEARnet's extremely limited broadcast accessibility. However, just as Green was beginning to write Season 3, \"Holliston\" suffered the tragic death of main ensemble cast member Dave Brockie who passed away in what was eventually reported to be a drug overdose. Brockie not only played \"Oderus Urungus\" on \"Holliston\" (Green's character's imaginary alien friend and ulterior conscience), he had also performed as the lead singer for the heavy metal band GWAR for 30 years and was one of Green's closest friends in real life. To make matters even worse, just three weeks after Brockie's death, the FEARnet television network was suddenly dissolved in yet another unforeseen corporate merger between Comcast and Time Warner. In August of 2014 Green delivered a eulogy for Brockie at a public memorial in Virginia attended by several thousand GWAR and \"Holliston\" fans. During his speech, Green's played back the final voice mail Brockie had left for him and concluded by asking the thousands of fans that were present to all hold their hands together in the air. \"This is your metal family,\" Green reminded the grieving fans. \"And your metal family will always be here for you.\" The memorial concluded with a traditional viking style burning of Brockie's \"Oderus Urungus\" costume in Richmond's Haddad Lake. Overcome with grief, Green stepped away from \"Holliston\" for several years without any word if he would ever return to his show again.\n\nDuring Green's indefinite hiatus from \"Holliston,\" he continued to do a weekly podcast with fellow director, co-star, and real-life best friend Joe Lynch called \"The Movie Crypt\" on the GeekNation digital network. Named after the fictitious cable access program that Green and Lynch's character's host on \"Holliston\", \"The Movie Crypt\" was originally designed to merely be a spin-off and companion piece to the sit-com and the two filmmakers only planned to do the podcast for the ten weeks that Season 2 was airing. However, their weekly program began pulling in extraordinarily high numbers and quickly became one of the most popular entertainment industry behind the scenes podcasts on the internet due to Green and Lynch's enjoyable on-air chemistry and the duos unfiltered honesty about their real-life experiences as working artists in the Hollywood system. Focusing on a different guest artist's entire career journey each week, \"The Movie Crypt\" showcases all sides of the industry from filmmakers to actors to costumers to agents to studio executives to musicians and beyond. Guests have included Chris Columbus, Slash, Joe Dante, Jordan Peele, James Gunn, Penelope Spheeris, Bobcat Goldthwait, and Rob Cohen. By January of 2015 \"The Movie Crypt\" was averaging over 500,000 worldwide listeners a week and the podcast was listed in Entertainment Weekly's January 9th issue as one of \"The Top 20 Podcasts You Should Be Listening To\" out of over 285,000 podcasts in existence. In addition to their candid and compelling weekly artist interviews, Green and Lynch have also produced special stand out episodes of \"The Movie Crypt\" such as the November 2015 \"Addiction\" episode that tackled substance abuse and addiction within the industry, the December 2014 \"Holliston Reunion\" episode where the cast performed a new original \"Holliston\" episode designed as a radio play, and their December 2015 \"Christmas Special\" which featured a sincere and moving 2-hour interview with Santa Claus that remains the podcast's most popular episode to date. Green and Lynch have never missed a single week since the podcast first launched on May 6, 2013. It was \"The Movie Crypt's\" unplanned and unexpected success that would ultimately set the stage for the return of \"Holliston.\"\n\nIn August of 2015 Entertainment Weekly made the announcement that Green and his cast had decided that they would indeed continue on with \"Holliston\" and do a 3rd season. In February of 2016 the \"Holliston\" cast appeared together on Facebook live where they answered questions from fans after completing their first ever read through of two of Green's new scripts for Season 3. During the Q&A with fans Green stated that \"Oderus\" would not be recast or replaced and that when \"Holliston\" returns he would acknowledge the loss of Brockie and then move on with the show, keeping his character's closet door permanently closed for as long as the series may continue. As of the time of this writing, Season 3 of \"Holliston\" is expected to begin shooting once the cast's individual production schedules can line-up together. With series stars Adam Green and Joe Lynch both consistently directing feature films and other television shows and with series co-star Dee Snider so busy with his various music projects and tours it is very difficult to get the entire cast together at the same time to shoot. The first official \"Holliston\" graphic novel (titled \"Friendship Is Tragic\") was announced and previewed on March 17, 2016 at Chicago's C2E2 comic book expo and pop culture convention. The comic book hit retail shelves in the Fall of 2016 and a sequel was green-lit just four days later. The second graphic novel (titled \"Carnival of Carnage\") hits shelves in May of 2018.\n\nIn 2015 Green turned ArieScope.com into an on-line network by offering weekly original programming. With over 100 free short films and original series' episodes to watch, Green's personal blog, and an on-line merchandise store, ArieScope.com has become a destination site for original content to millions of fans worldwide. Original series such as \"Adam Green's Scary Sleepover\" and \"Horrified\" proved to be extremely popular with fans and ArieScope.com also released the award winning series \"20 Seconds To Live\" which was helmed by filmmaker Ben Rock, an artist that Green personally believes in and wanted to expose his own audience to. Green's original on-line series and various short films are also carried on ArieScope's YouTube channel which has received over 4.6 million individual views to date.\n\nIn 2017 Green once again turned his attention back to his longtime band \"Haddonfield\" and the group released the album \"Ghosts of Salem\" on vinyl, CD, and digital through EMP Label Group and Green's own sub-label ArieScope Records. On October 14, 2017 \"Haddonfield\" celebrated the release of \"Ghosts of Salem\" with a live performance at the Palladium in Worcester, MA during the annual Rock And Shock horror and music festival. \"Ministry,\" \"Devil Driver,\" and \"Motionless In White\" also performed at the festival with \"Haddonfield\" in 2017.\n\nA celebrated leader and inspirational personality in the horror genre, Adam Green has amassed an enormous following worldwide through his down to earth and extraordinarily kind demeanor at personal appearances, by his accessibility to his fans on social networking, by performing improv comedy and original live \"Holliston\" episodes for fans on the convention circuit, by never charging his fans for his autograph or photo, by consistently putting out new entertainment for his audience on such a frequent schedule, and by inspiring and encouraging his own fans that they too can achieve their dreams so long as they don't let the world's negativity change or disenchant their spirit. Green has personally organized and lead many charity events over the years. In May of 2013 he raised over $15,000.00 to help the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing by putting on a three-night fundraiser in his home town of Boston where he held theatrical screenings of the \"Hatchet\" films, a preview screening of select Season 2 episodes of \"Holliston\", and a silent auction of celebrity donated genre memorabilia. In April of 2015 Green also helped raise $7,000.00 for \"Save A Yorkie Rescue\" at the Monstermania convention in New Jersey by auctioning himself off for a date with a fan and auctioning off a screen-used prop hatchet. While on stage during the auction event, Green stated that it was the companionship of his own Yorkie \"Arwen\" that got him through the various personal tragedies he underwent in 2014. \"You're not just saving the lives of these wonderful dogs, you're also very likely saving the lives of the people who will adopt them.\" Adam Green and Joe Lynch also put on an annual 48-hour live marathon of their Movie Crypt podcast to benefit \"Save A Yorkie Rescue.\" The two filmmakers and \"Holliston\" co-stars stay on the air live for an entire weekend with celebrity guests joining them around the clock providing live comedy, film commentaries, script readings, and interviews to raise money for the dog rescue through donations from their audience. The Movie Crypt marathon raised $14,000.00 in 2016 and $24,000.00 in 2017, saving hundreds of abused and abandoned dogs that were in dire need of medical care and foster homes.\n\nAt the time of this posting Adam Green is developing Season 3 of \"Holliston,\" working on a new TV series called \"Killer Pizza\" which is being produced by Chris Columbus, working on his next feature film project, and writing his next record with \"Haddonfield\" as well as working on many other projects. He lives in Los Angeles with his dog \"Arwen\" and his cat \"Tyler.\" An avid music fan he has been known to follow bands on tour such as \"Aerosmith,\" \"Metallica,\" and \"Guns N Roses.\" \"Twisted Sister\" is his favorite band of all time and 1982's \"E.T. The Extra Terrestrial\" remains his most favorite film. He is active on Twitter and Instagram at @Adam_Fn_Green and he also personally responds to his fans on his public Facebook page: Facebook.com/AdamFnGreen.\n\nBiography submitted to IMDB in May 2016. Updated in March 2018.\n\nStanley Kubrick was born in Manhattan, New York City, to Sadie Gertrude (Perveler) and Jacob Leonard Kubrick, a physician. His family were Jewish immigrants (from Austria, Romania, and Russia). Stanley was considered intelligent, despite poor grades at school. Hoping that a change of scenery would produce better academic performance, Kubrick's father sent him in 1940 to Pasadena, California, to stay with his uncle, Martin Perveler. Returning to the Bronx in 1941 for his last year of grammar school, there seemed to be little change in his attitude or his results. Hoping to find something to interest his son, Jack introduced Stanley to chess, with the desired result. Kubrick took to the game passionately, and quickly became a skilled player. Chess would become an important device for Kubrick in later years, often as a tool for dealing with recalcitrant actors, but also as an artistic motif in his films.\n\nJack Kubrick's decision to give his son a camera for his thirteenth birthday would be an even wiser move: Kubrick became an avid photographer, and would often make trips around New York taking photographs which he would develop in a friend's darkroom. After selling an unsolicited photograph to Look Magazine, Kubrick began to associate with their staff photographers, and at the age of seventeen was offered a job as an apprentice photographer.\n\nIn the next few years, Kubrick had regular assignments for \"Look\", and would become a voracious movie-goer. Together with friend Alexander Singer, Kubrick planned a move into film, and in 1950 sank his savings into making the documentary Day of the Fight (1951). This was followed by several short commissioned documentaries (Flying Padre (1951), and (The Seafarers (1953), but by attracting investors and hustling chess games in Central Park, Kubrick was able to make Furcht und Begierde (1952) in California.\n\nFilming this movie was not a happy experience; Kubrick's marriage to high school sweetheart Toba Metz did not survive the shooting. Despite mixed reviews for the film itself, Kubrick received good notices for his obvious directorial talents. Kubrick's next two films Der Tiger von New York (1955) and Die Rechnung ging nicht auf (1956) brought him to the attention of Hollywood, and in 1957 he directed Kirk Douglas in Wege zum Ruhm (1957). Douglas later called upon Kubrick to take over the production of Spartacus (1960), by some accounts hoping that Kubrick would be daunted by the scale of the project and would thus be accommodating. This was not the case, however: Kubrick took charge of the project, imposing his ideas and standards on the film. Many crew members were upset by his style: cinematographer Russell Metty complained to producers that Kubrick was taking over his job. Kubrick's response was to tell him to sit there and do nothing. Metty complied, and ironically was awarded the Academy Award for his cinematography.\n\nKubrick's next project was to direct Marlon Brando in Der Besessene (1961), but negotiations broke down and Brando himself ended up directing the film himself. Disenchanted with Hollywood and after another failed marriage, Kubrick moved permanently to England, from where he would make all of his subsequent films. Despite having obtained a pilot's license, Kubrick was rumored to be afraid of flying.\n\nKubrick's first UK film was Lolita (1962), which was carefully constructed and guided so as to not offend the censorship boards which at the time had the power to severely damage the commercial success of a film. Dr. Seltsam oder: Wie ich lernte, die Bombe zu lieben (1964) was a big risk for Kubrick; before this, \"nuclear\" was not considered a subject for comedy. Originally written as a drama, Kubrick decided that too many of the ideas he had written were just too funny to be taken seriously. The film's critical and commercial success allowed Kubrick the financial and artistic freedom to work on any project he desired. Around this time, Kubrick's focus diversified and he would always have several projects in various stages of development: \"Blue Moon\" (a story about Hollywood's first pornographic feature film), \"Napoleon\" (an epic historical biography, abandoned after studio losses on similar projects), \"Wartime Lies\" (based on the novel by Louis Begley), and \"Rhapsody\" (a psycho-sexual thriller).\n\nThe next film he completed was a collaboration with sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke. 2001 - Odyssee im Weltraum (1968) is hailed by many as the best ever made; an instant cult favorite, it has set the standard and tone for many science fiction films that followed. Kubrick followed this with Uhrwerk Orange (1971), which rivaled Lolita (1962) for the controversy it generated - this time not only for its portrayal of sex, but also of violence. Barry Lyndon (1975) would prove a turning point in both his professional and private lives. His unrelenting demands of commitment and perfection of cast and crew had by now become legendary. Actors would be required to perform dozens of takes with no breaks. Filming a story in Ireland involving military, Kubrick received reports that the IRA had declared him a possible target. Production was promptly moved out of the country, and Kubrick's desire for privacy and security resulted in him being considered a recluse ever since.\n\nHaving turned down directing a sequel to Der Exorzist (1973), Kubrick made his own horror film: Shining (1980). Again, rumors circulated of demands made upon actors and crew. Stephen King (whose novel the film was based upon) reportedly didn't like Kubrick's adaptation (indeed, he would later write his own screenplay which was filmed as The Shining (1997).)\n\nKubrick's subsequent work has been well spaced: it was seven years before Full Metal Jacket (1987) was released. By this time, Kubrick was married with children and had extensively remodeled his house. Seen by one critic as the dark side to the humanist story of Platoon (1986), Full Metal Jacket (1987) continued Kubrick's legacy of solid critical acclaim, and profit at the box office.\n\nIn the 1990s, Kubrick began an on-again/off-again collaboration with Brian Aldiss on a new science fiction film called \"Artificial Intelligence (AI)\", but progress was very slow, and was backgrounded until special effects technology was up to the standard the Kubrick wanted.\n\nKubrick returned to his in-development projects, but encountered a number of problems: \"Napoleon\" was completely dead, and \"Wartime Lies\" (now called \"The Aryan Papers\") was abandoned when Steven Spielberg announced he would direct Schindlers Liste (1993), which covered much of the same material.\n\nWhile pre-production work on \"AI\" crawled along, Kubrick combined \"Rhapsody\" and \"Blue Movie\" and officially announced his next project as Eyes Wide Shut (1999), starring the then-married Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. After two years of production under unprecedented security and privacy, the film was released to a typically polarized critical and public reception; Kubrick claimed it was his best film to date.\n\nSpecial effects technology had matured rapidly in the meantime, and Kubrick immediately began active work on A.I.: Künstliche Intelligenz (2001), but tragically suffered a fatal heart attack in his sleep on March 7th, 1999.\n\nAfter Kubrick's death, Spielberg revealed that the two of them were friends that frequently communicated discreetly about the art of filmmaking; both had a large degree of mutual respect for each other's work. \"AI\" was frequently discussed; Kubrick even suggested that Spielberg should direct it as it was more his type of project. Based on this relationship, Spielberg took over as the film's director and completed the last Kubrick project.\n\nHow much of Kubrick's vision remains in the finished project -- and what he would think of the film as eventually released -- will be the final great unanswerable mysteries in the life of this talented and private filmmaker.\n\nOne of the most influential personalities in the history of cinema, Steven Spielberg is Hollywood's best known director and one of the wealthiest filmmakers in the world. He has an extraordinary number of commercially successful and critically acclaimed credits to his name, either as a director, producer or writer since launching the summer blockbuster with Der weiße Hai (1975), and he has done more to define popular film-making since the mid-1970s than anyone else.\n\nSteven Allan Spielberg was born in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Leah Frances (Posner), a concert pianist and restaurateur, and Arnold Spielberg, an electrical engineer who worked in computer development. His parents were both born to Russian Jewish immigrant families. Steven spent his younger years in Haddon Township, New Jersey, Phoenix, Arizona, and later Saratoga, California. He went to California State University Long Beach, but dropped out to pursue his entertainment career. Among his early directing efforts were Battle Squad (1961), which combined World War II footage with footage of an airplane on the ground that he makes you believe is moving. He also directed Escape to Nowhere (1961), which featured children as World War Two soldiers, including his sister Anne Spielberg, and The Last Gun (1959), a western. All of these were short films. The next couple of years, Spielberg directed a couple of movies that would portend his future career in movies. In 1964, he directed Firelight (1964), a movie about aliens invading a small town. In 1967, he directed Slipstream (1967), which was unfinished. However, in 1968, he directed Amblin' (1968), which featured the desert prominently, and not the first of his movies in which the desert would feature. Amblin' also became the name of his production company, which turned out such classics as E.T. - Der Außerirdische (1982). Spielberg had a unique and classic early directing project, Duell (1971), with Dennis Weaver. In the early 1970s, Spielberg was working on TV, directing among others such series as Rod Serling's Wo alle Wege enden (1969), Dr. med. Marcus Welby (1969) and Tödliche Trennung (1971). All of his work in television and short films, as well as his directing projects, were just a hint of the wellspring of talent that would dazzle audiences all over the world.\n\nSpielberg's first major directorial effort was Sugarland Express (1974), with Goldie Hawn, a film that marked him as a rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an international superstar among directors: Der weiße Hai (1975). This classic shark attack tale started the tradition of the summer blockbuster or, at least, he was credited with starting the tradition. His next film was the classic Die unheimliche Begegnung der 3. Art (1977), a unique and original UFO story that remains a classic. In 1978, Spielberg produced his first film, the forgettable I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978), and followed that effort with Mit einem Bein im Kittchen (1980), a critically acclaimed, but mostly forgotten, Kurt Russell/Jack Warden comedy about devious used-car dealers. Spielberg hit gold yet one more time with Jäger des verlorenen Schatzes (1981), with Harrison Ford taking the part of Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced and directed two films in 1982. The first was Poltergeist (1982), but the highest-grossing movie of all time up to that point was the alien story E.T. - Der Außerirdische (1982). Spielberg also helped pioneer the practice of product placement. The concept, while not uncommon, was still relatively low-key when Spielberg raised the practice to almost an art form with his famous (or infamous) placement of Reese's Pieces in \"E.T.\" Spielberg was also one of the pioneers of the big-grossing special-effects movies, like \"E.T.\" and \"Close Encounters\", where a very strong emphasis on special effects was placed for the first time on such a huge scale. In 1984, Spielberg followed up \"Raiders\" with Indiana Jones und der Tempel des Todes (1984), which was a commercial success but did not receive the critical acclaim of its predecessor. As a producer, Spielberg took on many projects in the 1980s, such as Die Goonies (1985), and was the brains behind the little monsters in Gremlins - Kleine Monster (1984). He also produced the cartoon Feivel, der Mauswanderer (1986), a quaint little animated classic. His biggest effort as producer in 1985, however, was the blockbuster Zurück in die Zukunft (1985), which made Michael J. Fox an instant superstar. As director, Spielberg took on the book Die Farbe Lila (1985), with Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey, with great success. In the latter half of the 1980s, he also directed Das Reich der Sonne (1987), a mixed success for the occasionally erratic Spielberg. Success would not escape him for long, though.\n\nThe late 1980s found Spielberg's projects at the center of pop-culture yet again. In 1988, he produced the landmark animation/live-action film Falsches Spiel mit Roger Rabbit (1988). The next year proved to be another big one for Spielberg, as he produced and directed Always - Der Feuerengel von Montana (1989) as well as Indiana Jones und der letzte Kreuzzug (1989), and Zurück in die Zukunft II (1989). All three of the films were box-office and critical successes. Also, in 1989, he produced the little known comedy-drama Dad (1989), with Jack Lemmon and Ted Danson, which got mostly mixed results. Spielberg has also had an affinity for animation and has been a strong voice in animation in the 1990s. Aside from producing the landmark \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", he produced the animated series Tiny Toon Abenteuer (1990), Animaniacs (1993), Pinky und der Brain (1995), Freakazoid! (1995), Pinky, Elmyra & der Brain (1998), Hund mit Familie (1993) and Toonsylvania (1998). Spielberg also produced other cartoons such as In einem Land vor unserer Zeit (1988), Vier Dinos in New York (1993), Casper (1995) (the live action version) as well as the live-action version of Flintstones: Die Familie Feuerstein (1994), where he was credited as \"Steven Spielrock\". Spielberg also produced many Roger Rabbit short cartoons, and many Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs and Tiny Toons specials. Spielberg was very active in the early 1990s, as he directed Hook (1991) and produced such films as the cute fantasy Joe gegen den Vulkan (1990) and Feivel, der Mauswanderer im wilden Westen (1991). He also produced the unusual comedy thriller Arachnophobia (1990), Zurück in die Zukunft III (1990) and Gremlins 2 - Die Rückkehr der kleinen Monster (1990). While these movies were big successes in their own right, they did not quite bring in the kind of box office or critical acclaim as previous efforts. In 1993, Spielberg directed Jurassic Park (1993), which for a short time held the record as the highest grossing movie of all time, but did not have the universal appeal of his previous efforts. Big box-office spectacles were not his only concern, though. He produced and directed Schindlers Liste (1993), a stirring film about the Holocaust. He won best director at the Oscars, and also got Best Picture. In the mid-90s, he helped found the production company DreamWorks, which was responsible for many box-office successes.\n\nAs a producer, he was very active in the late 90s, responsible for such films as Die Maske des Zorro (1998), Men in Black (1997) and Deep Impact (1998). However, it was on the directing front that Spielberg was in top form. He directed and produced the epic Amistad - Das Sklavenschiff (1997), a spectacular film that was shorted at the Oscars and in release due to the fact that its release date was moved around so much in late 1997. The next year, however, produced what many believe was one of the best films of his career: Der Soldat James Ryan (1998), a film about World War Two that is spectacular in almost every respect. It was stiffed at the Oscars, losing best picture to Shakespeare in Love (1998).\n\nSpielberg produced a series of films, including Evolution (2001), Das Geisterschloss (1999) and Shrek - Der tollkühne Held (2001). he also produced two sequels to Jurassic Park (1993), which were financially but not particularly critical successes. In 2001, he produced a mini-series about World War Two that definitely *was* a financial and critical success: Band of Brothers: Wir waren wie Brüder (2001), a tale of an infantry company from its parachuting into France during the invasion to the Battle of the Bulge. Also in that year, Spielberg was back in the director's chair for A.I.: Künstliche Intelligenz (2001), a movie with a message and a huge budget. It did reasonably at the box office and garnered varied reviews from critics.\n\nSpielberg has been extremely active in films there are many other things he has done as well. He produced the short-lived TV series SeaQuest (1993), an anthology series entitled Unglaubliche Geschichten (1985), created the video-game series \"Medal of Honor\" set during World War Two, and was a starting producer of Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994). Spielberg, if you haven't noticed, has a great interest in World War Two. He and Tom Hanks collaborated on Shooting War: World War II Combat Cameramen (2000), a documentary about World War II combat photographers, and he produced a documentary about the Holocaust called A Holocaust szemei (2000). With all of this to Spielberg's credit, it's no wonder that he's looked at as one of the greatest ever figures in entertainment."
