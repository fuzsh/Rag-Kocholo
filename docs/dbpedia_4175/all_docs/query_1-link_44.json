Capcom has released Devil May Cry 5, but is it worth the wait? Victor Lucas has the answer in his review!\n\nsource: Easy Allies& The Electric Playground Network | EPN\n\nI do find V a bit of a pain to get used to and I think in general too much of the combos are locked behind orb pay walls. I think the reason why it takes a while to accumulate a decent amount is because the series has introduced micro-transactions to the system.\n\nThere's a pretty simple Red Orb farm trick. You can farm 500.000 Red Orbs in literal minutes. Get all the upgrades on the Faust hat, use the gunslinger style, then head to Mission 13, and repeat the section with the 4 Flesh Pods(?) that constantly spawn enemies. Every time all Pods are destroyed, just reload your old checkpoint. You get spawned right back at the entrance and keep all the Orbs you farmed.\n\nThe game needs more unlockable costumes imo. The ex colour skins are quite meh imo. Seeing the Megaman canon makes me think it would be fun to see some Megaman skins like Megaman, X, Zero etc for Dante, Nero and company.\n\nI'm pretty disappointed with the lack of unlockable costumes in this game. There are none, with the exception of palette swaps.\n\nI did hear they could be considering adding another certain character to the game at some point.\n\nI wouldn't mind seeing Trish and Lady in their own missions. Feels like they could fit right in and add their side of the story.\n\nYhe game needs more unlockable costumes imo. The ex colour skins are quite meh imo. Seeing the Megaman canon makes me think it would be fun to see some Megaman skins like Megaman, X, Zero etc for Dante, Nero and company.\n\nif they still have plan's to put this on the switch I'm hoping for samus's blaster as well .\n\nit seem's Nathan told you about the Faust hat thing which most people have been using and why cap com made that hat in the first place.\n\nthe other thing I'm looking forward to is the up coming Net flix Devil may cry anime . I'm not sure if it'll be post this event's in 5 or if it'll a retelling of this that was put together detailed of that happen prior to 5 with the voice actor that played Rukia kuski brother.\n\nI do want to know why sparda disappeared though?. may be they can do both. oh I do want to know about this speacial project that producer / director for Castlevana Netflix anime series was talking about with this two franchise crossing over. capcom & konomi. hmmmm.\n\nBellmonts & Supposedly Redgraves"
