While the author did help out during the famous escape, he didn't flee down the tunnel due to severe claustrophobia.\n\n#99. It Happened One Night (1934)\n\n- Director: Frank Capra\n\n- Stacker score: 88\n\n- Metascore: 87\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.1\n\n- Runtime: 105 minutes\n\nThis 1934 classic is based on Samuel Hopkins Adams' short story \"Night Bus,\" which was published the previous year.

Due to heightened Cold War tensions, the original screenwriters were accused of being communists and thereby robbed of credit. As a result, Boulle—who didn't even speak English—not only received credit for a script he didn't write, but went on to win an Academy Award.\n\n#97. Strangers on a Train (1951)\n\n- Director: Alfred Hitchcock\n\n- Stacker score: 88\n\n- Metascore: 88\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8\n\n- Runtime: 101 minutes\n\nAlfred Hitchcock frequently used novels as the basis for his films and \"Strangers on a Train\" was no exception.

Striving for authenticity, this film adaptation was shot in locations where the actual crimes once occurred. It was nominated for four Academy Awards.\n\n#94. Letters From Iwo Jima (2006)\n\n- Director: Clint Eastwood\n\n- Stacker score: 88\n\n- Metascore: 89\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.9\n\n- Runtime: 141 minutes\n\nScreenwriters drew upon the actual letters of Gen. Tadamichi Kuribayashi, portrayed by Ken Watanabe, for this war drama. A companion piece to \"Flags of Our Fathers,\" it depicts the World War II battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese perspective. The film was a commercial disappointment but a critical darling.\n\n#93.

The African Queen (1951)\n\n- Director: John Huston\n\n- Stacker score: 88\n\n- Metascore: 91\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.7\n\n- Runtime: 105 minutes\n\nScreen legends Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn hop aboard a riverboat in this World War I adventure. The film's screenwriters cleaned up some of the source material to appease censors, who still took issue with certain components. Tourists can visit the original African Queen riverboat to this day.\n\n#91. Tristana (1970)\n\n- Director: Luis Buñuel\n\n- Stacker score: 88\n\n- Metascore: 93\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.5\n\n- Runtime: 99 minutes\n\nAn 1892 novel laid the groundwork for this Spanish drama, in which the title character, played by Catherine Deneuve, struggles for independence. Both the source material and the film adaptation explore the oppressive expectations of a patriarchal society. Director Luis Buñuel spent nearly 20 years getting the project made and incorporated personal details into the final product.\n\nYou may also like: The most popular movies to stream right now\n\n#90. Inside Llewyn Davis (2013)\n\n- Directors: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen\n\n- Stacker score: 88\n\n- Metascore: 93\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.5\n\n- Runtime: 104 minutes\n\nThe Coen Brothers drew inspiration from folk singer Dave Van Ronk and his memoir when creating this low-key drama. It tells the story of musician Llewyn Davis, played by Oscar Isaac, who tries to make his way in New York's burgeoning folk scene. According to legend, the real-life Van Ronk wielded far more influence and presence than the fictional Davis.\n\n#89. Das Boot (1981)\n\n- Director: Wolfgang Petersen\n\n- Stacker score: 88\n\n- Metascore: 86\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.3\n\n- Runtime: 149 minutes\n\nWolfgang Peterson brings viewers into a World War II German U-boat to uncover equal amounts of angst and terror. The film is based on a bestselling novel of the same name by former war correspondent Lothar-Günther Buchheim. An \"original uncut version\" clocks in at 293 minutes, which might be the actual time it takes to read the book.\n\n#88. The Tale of The Princess Kaguya (2013)\n\n- Director: Isao Takahata\n\n- Stacker score: 88\n\n- Metascore: 89\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8\n\n- Runtime: 137 minutes\n\nStudio Ghibli co-founder Isao Takahata directed this watercolor-style anime about a tiny princess who's discovered living inside a bamboo stalk. It's based on a 10th-century Japanese story called \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter.\" When adapting the source material, Takahata's biggest challenge was understanding \"what was in the heart of Princess Kaguya.\"\n\n#87.

As far-fetched as the story may seem, most of its events are ripped straight out of history. Despite critical acclaim, the movie was a commercial disappointment during its theatrical release.\n\nYou may also like: Oscar Best Picture winners from worst to first\n\n#85. Frankenstein (1931)\n\n- Director: James Whale\n\n- Stacker score: 88\n\n- Metascore: 91\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.8\n\n- Runtime: 70 minutes\n\nFew horror stories are more iconic than Mary Shelley's tale of Dr. Frankenstein and his unruly creation. James Whale's 1931 feature adaptation is held in similarly high regard, with Boris Karloff playing the legendary monster. A number of sequels and spin-offs followed.\n\n#84. Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)\n\n- Director: Don Siegel\n\n- Stacker score: 88\n\n- Metascore: 92\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.7\n\n- Runtime: 80 minutes\n\nWriter Jack Finney first published \"The Body Snatchers\" as a serialized novel for Collier's magazine.

Every version deals with the same core premise of alien invasions and pod people.\n\n#83. The 39 Steps (1935)\n\n- Director: Alfred Hitchcock\n\n- Stacker score: 88\n\n- Metascore: 93\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.6\n\n- Runtime: 86 minutes\n\nThis influential film noir is loosely based on a 1915 novel of the same name.

Both versions follow two close friends out to California wine country where they come up against the very realities they're trying to escape. The movie won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\n#81.

It remains a high point in director Roman Polanski's latter-day career.\n\n#78. To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)\n\n- Director: Robert Mulligan\n\n- Stacker score: 89\n\n- Metascore: 88\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.2\n\n- Runtime: 129 minutes\n\nOne of the greatest novels of all time tells the story of Atticus Finch, a Depression-era lawyer who defends a falsely accused Black man.

Shortly after writing \"The Hustler\"—upon which this classic 1961 film is based—Tevis returned to his sci-fi roots by churning out \"The Man Who Fell to Earth.\" In 1984, the author switched gears again and wrote \"The Color of Money,\" a sequel to \"The Hustler\" that would end up being adapted by director Martin Scorsese.\n\nYou may also like: The best long movies to watch on Netflix\n\n#75.

Schaffner\n\n- Stacker score: 89\n\n- Metascore: 91\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.9\n\n- Runtime: 172 minutes\n\nScreenwriters Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H.

Little Women (2019)\n\n- Director: Greta Gerwig\n\n- Stacker score: 89\n\n- Metascore: 91\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.9\n\n- Runtime: 135 minutes\n\nLouisa May Alcott's seminal novel has been adapted numerous times and across a host of media. In the eyes of critics and audiences alike, Greta Gerwig's recent take might be the best one yet. Led by a talented cast, it takes place during and after the Civil War and tells the story of the four March sisters.\n\n#72. McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971)\n\n- Director: Robert Altman\n\n- Stacker score: 89\n\n- Metascore: 93\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.7\n\n- Runtime: 120 minutes\n\nIf the average Goodreads review is anything to go by, Robert Altman's \"anti-Western\" supersedes the novel upon which it's based. Warren Beatty plays John McCabe to Julie Christie's Constance Miller, two opportunistic business partners in the Old West. Genre conventions are purposefully undermined within a naturalistic setting.\n\n#71. The Magnificent Ambersons (1942)\n\n- Directors: Orson Welles, Fred Fleck (uncredited), Robert Wise (uncredited)\n\n- Stacker score: 89\n\n- Metascore: 93\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.7\n\n- Runtime: 88 minutes\n\nNot only was this period drama based on a novel, but it featured that very same novel in the original trailer.

Employing his ascetic style, French director Robert Bresson tells the story of a counterfeit note and those who use it. The movie earned Bresson a best director prize at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n#69. The Silence of the Lambs (1991)\n\n- Director: Jonathan Demme\n\n- Stacker score: 89\n\n- Metascore: 85\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.6\n\n- Runtime: 118 minutes\n\nDirector Jonathan Demme played it fairly close to the source material when making \"The Silence of the Lambs.\" The film is based on Thomas Harris' acclaimed novel, about a young FBI agent who enlists the help of a brilliant psychopath in order to catch her target. Some folks have wondered what real-life killers inspired Lecter's creation, but Harris insists that the character was inspired only by evil itself.\n\n#68. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)\n\n- Directors: Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman\n\n- Stacker score: 89\n\n- Metascore: 87\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.4\n\n- Runtime: 117 minutes\n\nThe first animated \"Spider-Man\" film straddles multiple dimensions as different characters take on the title role.

An upcoming sequel is reportedly in production and slated for a 2022 release.\n\n#67. Raging Bull (1980)\n\n- Director: Martin Scorsese\n\n- Stacker score: 89\n\n- Metascore: 89\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.2\n\n- Runtime: 129 minutes\n\nBased on boxer Jake LaMotta's own memoir, Martin Scorsese's \"Raging Bull\" offers a stunning glimpse into LaMotta's violent world.

Solaris (1972)\n\n- Director: Andrei Tarkovsky\n\n- Stacker score: 89\n\n- Metascore: 90\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.1\n\n- Runtime: 167 minutes\n\nStanisław Lem's 1961 novel remains a sci-fi classic for both its gripping premise and philosophical overtones. Director Andrei Tarkovsky brings both those elements to the foreground in this seminal adaptation. It was allegedly made as a humanistic counterpunch to Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"\n\n#65. Ben-Hur (1959)\n\n- Director: William Wyler\n\n- Stacker score: 89\n\n- Metascore: 90\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.1\n\n- Runtime: 212 minutes\n\nSword-and-sandal movies don't get much more iconic than \"Ben-Hur,\" which tells the story of a Jewish prince who is betrayed and then sold into slavery. The 1880 source novel by Lew Wallace is widely considered the most influential Christian book of the 19th century. William Wyler's adaptation won no less than 11 Academy Awards, setting a record at the time.\n\n#64. All Quiet on the Western Front (1930)\n\n- Director: Lewis Milestone\n\n- Stacker score: 89\n\n- Metascore: 91\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8\n\n- Runtime: 152 minutes\n\nGerman novelist Erich Maria Remarque detailed the horrors of World War I in \"All Quiet on the Western Front,\" which was turned into a similarly harrowing film. Both the book and film were subsequently banned by the Nazis after they ascended to power in the 1930s. To this day, each respective work is heralded for its uncompromising perspective.\n\n#63. Beauty and the Beast (1946)\n\n- Directors: Jean Cocteau, René Clément (uncredited)\n\n- Stacker score: 89\n\n- Metascore: 92\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.9\n\n- Runtime: 93 minutes\n\nOnce dubbed a tale as old as time, \"Beauty and the Beast\" has thematic origins going back centuries. This take from French director Jean Cocteau is hailed for its visual effects and soulful atmosphere. The original folktale has been adapted for multiple media in the time since, all the way up to a recent Disney live-action blockbuster.\n\n#62. The French Connection (1971)\n\n- Director: William Friedkin\n\n- Stacker score: 89\n\n- Metascore: 94\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.7\n\n- Runtime: 104 minutes\n\nWilliam Friedkin's classic crime drama is based on a nonfiction account of high stakes drug trafficking in New York City. Screenwriter Ernest Tidyman won an Oscar for his adaptation, though it's been said that a number of the best lines were improvised. The film's iconic—and fictionalized—car chase became a piece of history in its own right.\n\n#61.

Filmmaker Curtis Hanson and screenwriter Brian Helgeland tweaked the characters and put substantial twists on the book's ending. The story follows a trio of cops as they uncover multiple levels of corruption in 1950s Los Angeles.\n\n#59. No Country for Old Men (2007)\n\n- Directors: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen\n\n- Stacker score: 90\n\n- Metascore: 91\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.1\n\n- Runtime: 122 minutes\n\nAnyone who reads Cormac McCarthy knows that his brilliant prose can be hard to decipher, let alone put up on the big screen.

While minor differences abound, the award-winning film is for the most part a faithful adaptation.\n\n#58.
