        "text": "Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition is a remastered version of slasher called Devil May Cry 4 developed by Capcom.\n\nSetting\n\nThe game takes place in a city called Fortune which is ruled by the Order of the Sword that worships the Dark Knight Sparda, who protects the city from demons.\n\nDuring the morning prayer, the son of Sparda, Dante, rushes into the church, kills the head of the Order and most of its' knights. Nero manages to stop Dante in his killing spree. Demons start their assault on the city, and with the rest of the knights defending it, Nero follows Dante's trail.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game's levels are open-ended, as the players can both advance the plot further, or backtrack to previous locations. The main objectives of the player are to complete quests and kill demons.\n\nMost of the quests revolve around finding an item or solving a small puzzle. The game's combat is typical for the slasher genre. It features fast-paced gameplay with the addition of a combo system. The players have to chain their attacks both with their sword and firearms.\n\nIt is possible to level up your character. For completing a mission, the player is awarded Red Spheres and Proud Souls. Souls are used for unlocking new moves, while items are bought using Spheres.\n\nSpecial Edition features\n\nThere is not much difference from the base game. Apart from minor graphical updates, it became possible to complete the story as three new characters."
