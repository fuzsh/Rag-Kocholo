        "text": "\"Sonic 06\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog 4\" failed to reinvent Sonic after its groundbreaking outings on the Genesis and Sega CD. However, \"Sonic Mania\" was a rebirth: It remixed classic stages, threw in fun new levels, boasted a new soundtrack, shifted gameplay depending on the character, and added a new Drop Dash move allowing faster movement through the air.\n\n\"Devil May Cry 2\" was rushed right after the successful \"DMC 1\" came out, and it was an unfocused mess that disappointed fans. Luckily, “Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening” saved the franchise with a much more coherent story, an overhauled style ranking system, stronger character development, and improved combat and level design.\n\nYes, this supernatural action franchise was on death’s door again after the divisive \"DMC 4,” but thankfully, \"Devil May Cry 5\" perfected the formula of earlier entries. It focused on three diverse characters spread across twenty missions, and had the franchise’s best combat, with characters having unique fighting styles — plus, the graphics were impressive, and the soundtrack rocked.\n\n\"Resident Evil 6\" was seen as a creative failure, as it focused on big action and quick-time events rather than horror. Fortunately, \"Resident Evil 7: Biohazard\" returned the series to its survival horror aspects; its switch to first-person made the game's scares feel more immediate, and the terror was elevated when played in VR."
