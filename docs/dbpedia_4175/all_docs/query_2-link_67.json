        "text": "No E3…\n\nBut Still A Ton of Games to Share\n\nWhat was initially thought to be a joke became a swift and appalling nightmare when the news dropped that there will be no E3 in 2022. E3 (the Electronic Entertainment Expo), the pinnacle of all video game events and oasis for gamers worldwide, was officially announced by organizers ESA (Entertainment Software Association) that it will be officially cancelled this year.\n\nFor those that do not know what E3 is and/or are hearing about this for the first time, it is one of the most highly anticipated events of the year for video games. This marks the third year in a row since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that the event would not be hosting any presentations or showcases. And to top this off…No virtual event announced. This was a strange move on ESA’s end as surely big name distributors like Square Enix or Capcom would love to tag their upcoming games to the most influential marketing event of the gaming year and gamers would be just as enthusiastic to see what to expect.\n\nWorry not though as those same distributors hosted their own developer showcases and virtual events in place of E3. Here’s a rundown of the most notable as already mentioned previously.\n\nSquare Enix\n\n● Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth is part II of Final Fantasy VII: Remake and is a faithful retell to 1997 release FFVII, arguably the most popular installment to the acclaimed and long-running Final Fantasy series. After receiving widely positive reception, Square Enix dropped a trailer showing that this next installment immediately follows after the first game but with a story twist that deviates from the original storyline. In addition to deeper story content, players can also look forward to explore a wide open world that includes iconic locations of brilliant crystalline forests, war-torn barren wastelands (that’s probably home to giant snakes), and even impoverished but modest Steampunk themed towns such as Nibelheim (Cloud’s home), and many more. As of now, there is no confirmed release date for FF7 Rebirth, but it is speculated to arrive late 2023-early 2024 and is a PS5 exclusive.\n\n● Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion. For Final Fantasy VII fans, just the title Crisis Core (CC) is enough to jump off the seat. Since FFVII gets its own remake, the developers of Square Enix thought it would be a great idea to give its prequel Crisis Core one too. Just like the original game, CC follows the story and perspective of Zack Fair, a Soldier for Shinra, teased love interest of Aerith Gainsborough, and the one who gave the iconic buster sword to Cloud Strife who is the main character of FFVII. Here, players will assume control of Zack and learn the life of a warrior for a corrupt mega-corporation and how the events of FFVII came to be, even diving deeper into the origins of iconic villain Sephiroth (spoilers? They better not be).\n\nCapcom\n\n● Resident Evil 4 Remake. Zombie killing is the staple of Capcom RE installments and the studio has been killing the gaming scene with their remakes. With the success of RE2 and RE3 remakes, fans were wondering if RE4 would get some love as well. It definitely does. Just like the original release and like RE2, players are back in the shoes of fan-favorite Leon Kennedy who goes on a rescue mission to save the president’s daughter from not only zombies (wouldn’t be an RE game without them) but a malicious cult based in a village in Spain. RE4 was praised for its upgraded graphic design, cinematics, and combat mechanics so it comes as no surprise as well as a most welcoming one to see it remade with the next generation engines of video game designing. Resident Evil 4 Remake is due to launch on March 24, 2023.\n\n● Resident Evil Village: Winter’s expansion is an enhanced version of the 2021 release of the same name (minus the Winter part). The original was praised for the story, world-building, combat game play, and, of course, it’s characters (eyeing the beautiful 7 foot vampire lady with the nice hat). Since then, fans have been practically begging for more content of the game and developers Capcom delivered with the announcement of the Winter’s Expansion (WE). In addition to the original story-line, WE adds another story that follows right after the events of Village in which the players control a new protagonist, the spunky teen Rose Winters, daughter of the RE7 and RE8’s protagonist Ethan Winters. Here, Rose has to explore the consciousness of a super-colony known as the Mold and confront the monsters within in hopes to control her zombie powers, at least that’s what the trailer suggests. Aside from a new story to explore, the game adds some fun new features that’ll be as delightful to play with as the game is terrifying and action-packed. WE comes with a third-person perspective mode, something that fans have requested in the past and Capcom were happy to make happen. It also comes with a new game mode called Mercenaries, a fast-paced combat mode in which players must fight hordes and hordes of zombies similar to that of Call of Duty’s Zombies mode but with a cool twist gamers can play as popular characters Chris Redfield, who has been featured in the Resident Evil series since immemorial, and two more characters that received widespread praise: Heisenberg and Lady Dimitrescu who are two of the four lords of the titular village that serve the big bad Mother Miranda. Resident Evil Village: Winters’ Expansion is scheduled to be released October 28, 2022 so keep the baby close and a trusty pistol on-hand because ravenous zombies will be right around the corner.\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment\n\n● God of War Ragnarok is an upcoming Sony exclusive release that has been highly anticipated since God of War (2017) first came out. As soon as gamers finished the main story and went back for all of the collectibles, they were itching for more content. The developers purposefully leave teasers within the game itself of what to expect in future installments that not only include more regions to explore in the Norse setting but also other cultures worldwide that hint that battling the divine doesn’t just stop with Greek and Nordic mythology. God of War Ragnarok is marked for November 9, 2022 so save the date and get the Leviathan Axe ready (boy).\n\nOverall, even though there was no E3 this year, gaming news is always available to ramp up the hype. Keep an eye out for these games, more information will be available below. Until next time, remember to always stay KindaGeeky.\n\nSOURCES\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth\n\n● FFVII Rebirth Trailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_4CkyOmuuU&vl=en\n\n● https://www.laptopmag.com/news/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-everything-we-know-so-far\n\n● https://amp.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth\n\nCrisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion\n\n● Crisis Core: FF7 Reunion Trailer - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7fgQj72_uHo\n\n● https://amp.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii-reunion\n\n● https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/crisis-core-final-fantasy-7-reunion-release-date-trailers-gameplay-news/?amp\n\nResident Evil 4 Remake\n\n● RE4 Remake Trailer - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Ic2z3_xp0\n\n● https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/resident-evil-4-remake-everything-we-know-so-far-1652144/\n\n● https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-capcom-showcase-2022?amp=1\n\nResident Evil Village: Winters’ Expansion\n\n● RE Village: WE Trailer - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qb-k8C1EFq4\n\n● https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-village-winters-expansion-content-breakdown-dlc-third-person/\n\nGod of War Ragnarok\n\n● GOW Ragnarok Trailer - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EE-4GvjKcfs\n\n● https://blog.playstation.com/2022/07/06/god-of-war-ragnarok-launches-november-9-new-cg-trailer-revealed/\n\n● https://www.gamesradar.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-guide/\n\nGamerGeek Spring Picks\n\n2022 is proving itself to be a fantastic year for gaming so far! Only barely into spring and already there’s more than a handful of games that are acclaimed to be an absolute must-have to play. While not all of them can’t be delved deeply (not enough space for one article, sadness), here are some picks received positively well by the resident Gamer Geek.\n\nPokémon Legends: Arceus. After playing all generations of Pokémon, the beloved series, while noted to be one of the most iconic video game franchises of its genre, was notably becoming stale to veterans with previous releases. Not to say that recent installations like Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl were bad games, they were a refreshing and much needed remake that did an excellent job in reviving the love of the original game- however, this new game takes it up to a whole new level! It’s like training a flailing Magikarp for years, watching it do the same old splash moves until one day, trainers wake up to see a leviathan of a Gyarados in their room. Compared to previous Pokémon games, Legends Arceus is night-and-day, nostalgic of its predecessors yet at the same time stands in a league of its own.\n\nTo those who for some reason haven’t picked it up yet, they may ask what’s different this time around? For one thing, it embraces the open-world concept that has become the standard for most high rep video games, giving a shout out to another Nintendo staple- Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild which is still acclaimed as the best game by Nintendo since its release in 2017. Players are able to explore the vast and ever changing scapes of a feudal-era region and discover and capture Pokémon in the wild in greater depth than any other installment in the franchise. To go further, it’s not just mindless turn-based battles anymore. Legends Arceus creates a totally immersive gameplay that provides new and old players an incredibly engaging experience and storyline while retaining its identity as a Pokémon game with astounding finesse and style. It’s not enough just singing praises about it, it’s highly recommended to check it out personally (otherwise, it’ll take up the whole article). But as a final nod to Nintendo and this amazing game, a new Pokémon game has recently been announced for the switch that will take the concept and gameplay of Legends Arceus into a brand new region with (of course) new Pokémon to discover! More info can be found below.\n\nContinuing on the topic of epic open-world games, there’s a few more that need to have their spot in the light here.\n\nGod of War. Wait, the 2018 release? That’s not new, that’s not even open world! Well, boy, put down the Leviathan axe because it’s on this list of highly recommended picks for spring as it has been recently released to Steam for PC players. While not entirely open world, God of War was universally acclaimed as the best game of its year, winning multiple awards for its gameplay, art direction and story direction - thus deserves a special mention.\n\nIt was first released as a PlayStation exclusive, but because of how well it was received in the gaming community, Microsoft Windows finally gets a piece of the Greek-Norse action. It’s a wonderful epic for the ages equipped with beautifully designed maps to explore that is a mix between linear and just enough open-world that rewards players for exploring the depths of layers as well as engaging combat instances to keep them on their toes and begging for more action. For those that haven’t played it yet due to not owning a PlayStation 4 or 5 (how dare), there’s a chance to pick it up on Steam and just in before the next installation of the franchise releases later in 2022.\n\nFan of the Dark Souls series? How about Bloodborne? These action-adventure classics have set the bar for the Soul Series, receiving universal acclaim and criticism for their genre-defining difficulty. Usually set in a gothic or dark-toned medieval/feudal setting, players are thrown into a world where the narrative is decided by exploration and hard-earned difficulty against enemies (not just bosses) that can potentially kill player characters with less than a handful of landed strikes. They are extremely difficult games that can often frustrate players, but rewards strategic thinking and reflexes. Despite potentially scaring fans away with how hard they are, players still pick up the controller and offer praise for the deathly innovative gaming experience. The next installment - Elden Ring picks up the mantle of its predecessors in full swing.\n\nElden Ring releases early in 2022 as one of the most highly anticipated and recorded as the most pre-ordered game on Steam, setting its hype bar high up there. It sold 12 million copies worldwide and received high scores all across the board for its breathtaking open-world experience. It probably helped that one of the writers for Elden Ring is none other than George R. R. Martin, the author of A Song of Fire and Ice from which the globally popular HBO series Game of Thrones is based on, adding credibility to just how much thought was put into the creative and quality design of the game. It (of course) has been highly praised for its classic difficulty unique to Souls Games as well as enemies and characters that have already ascended to meme status in the gaming community (look up Pope Turtle on YouTube or Google and prepare to change religions).\n\nWhen the PlayStation 4 was first released, it was expected to be paired with a game that’ll match its hype and promises of what the next-gen games would look like at its time. Horizon Zero Dawn stepped up to the plate and delivered on those promises tenfold. While open-world concepts were not new back then, it became a widely popular genre thanks to this Sony exclusive gem. And the series continues with Horizon Forbidden West which succeeds its predecessor with expansive and ever-changing environments that’s not only a wonder to traverse but an absolute delight to explore when encountering enemies and puzzles. The game follows a badass female protagonist named Aloy who challenges a different twist into the concept of post-apocalyptic settings where instead of a dark, gloomy world, the state of the world she explores is a rich and colorful land upon which humanity has reverted to a primitive way of living similar to that of pre-historic times. Instead of fighting dinosaurs, however (sort of), the players find themselves up against machines (that still look like their design was ripped off a paleontology textbook) and other human enemies that gamers will be quick to ponder whether they’re allies or enemies, all while trying to assist Aloy with her lifelong identity crisis. Everything about the Horizon series is a lot to take in, but the story and gameplay is so captivating that playing it does not feel long-winded at all.\n\nAll of these titles will for certain tie any gamer over to satisfaction until more big titles hit the stores.

Amongst such shows is the popular Netflix series Arcane, a heart-grippingly epic adventure based on the characters and setting of gaming studio Riot’s world-renowned MOBA (multiplayer online battle area) game League of Legends.\n\nArcane dropped on Netflix on November 6th, streaming on both Riot’s official twitch stream as well as the streams of popular content creators all over the world. It has received overwhelmingly positive reviews, beating the ratings of popular Korean drama Squid Game and taking over as the streaming service’s number one spot as the most watched show. With a score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and 9.3/10 on IMDb, this comes as no surprise. The show received high praise for the art style which was a mix of 3D animation with hand drawn effects, characters and their development, the world-building, soundtrack, as well as the performances from the talented voice cast. Arcane’s first season went so well that Riot announced a second season almost immediately following the release of the show’s final act on November 20th. Suffice to say, the show is amazing and well worth the time to watch.\n\nIt is an enthralling tale that centers around a handful of wonderfully developed characters canon in the League of Legends universe and thus became an instant favorite amongst avid, loyal fans as well as curious newcomers unfamiliar with the game, emphasizing the work of Riot’s stellar creative team in hooking eager viewers. It is by far the best rated video game adaptation series to date, but those who have yet to watch it have to ask- what is Arcane? Fair warning, some spoilers ahead (but seriously, everyone should have seen it by now)!\n\nAs mentioned before, the show is based around the characters and world introduced in League of Legends. Set in the fictional world of Runeterra, the region of focus for the show is Piltover, divided actually in two cities- the City of Progress, home to the upper class, the wealthy and powerful; and the Undercity, home to the oppressed, the less fortunate and struggling, which would later become recognized as its own independent city called Zaun. League fans will recognize some characters instantly while watching the show, but for those that are not gamers, here’s a list of characters to note- fair warning, spoilers ahead.\n\nCaitlyn, a young aristocrat who took on the coat of arms in the side of law and justice; Jayce, the shining star of Piltover who aims to revolutionize progress in technology for both cities; Viktor, a genius who, although is stricken with an incurable illness at a young age, would herald progress in hextech with the goal to enhance life indefinitely; Singed, an unconventional resident chemist of the undercity whose methods go beyond humane; Heimerdinger, the founder of Piltover and an era-defining genius in his own right whose naivety would push his greatest students to bypass his ideals and beliefs; Ekko, a street kid with a penchant for time management who would grow to be a beacon of hope for the citizens of Zaun; and lastly, Warwick, the Hound of the Undercity who was once a former criminal trying to be a good man until tragedy strikes and turns him into a monster. That’s a lot of characters! How can anyone pack all of that depth in nine episodes?! Truthfully, one hardly sees these descriptions fulfilled to their fullest extent; instead, this season gives viewers a taste of every characters’ backstory and leaves them wondering with eager anticipation of what will happen next in their chaotic journey.\n\nWhile all of these characters have captivating subplots, the main story follows the two sisters Vi, a brash young woman who answers with her fists more than her words; and Powder, an adorably precocious youth who would grow to become the popular and feared marksman in the LoL game- Jinx, the Loose Cannon and chaos incarnate (woops, spoilers). Powder/Jinx and Vi- tragedy falls on the two heroines when they become separated by a series of unfortunate circumstances that not only kills off their family but forces them to go toe-to-toe with one another on opposite sides of the shadowy war between Piltover and Zaun. Vi would go to great lengths to reunite with her sister after years of separation due to imprisonment while Jinx would fall deeper into insanity due to the trauma of the terrible things she has done unintentionally in her youth. Meanwhile, deeper plots unfold behind the scenes that introduce the coming of a new age of technology and magic within the two cities which would be introduced to the world as Hextech. While originally innovated to save lives and make living on Piltover prosperous, hextech takes on a forebodingly far deadlier design when the dangers of such revolutionary technology come into play in the wrong hands. As this is happening, down below in the undercity, an ominously luminescent biochemical component Shimmer surfaces through trade from a shadowy group that aims to help the people of Zaun gain power over their Piltover oppressors, augmenting the mortal body beyond physical limits at the cost of sanity and free will. With hextech and shimmer sifting through the seams of the political struggle for power, they effectively destroy the already crumbling ties between the two cities and start a new civil war by the end of the season. It becomes a symbol of the inevitable wedge between two forces similar to a Vi and Jinx’s relationship.\n\nThat’s a lot to take in, right? Fear not. Riot and Fortiche did an excellent job in gracefully portraying each individual as well as intelligently depicting the world-building around them without over-explaining any of it. Which means it is very easy to follow and enchanting to watch from start to finish. This decision leaves room for fans to interpret and enjoy the ride of each scene with a realistic and open-minded approach.\n\nIn celebration of Arcane’s successful release, Riot has collaborated with several other groups with new content, merchandise, and events. To name some off these…the popular MOBA Fortnite released Jinx as a new playable character, complete with a new skin as well as skill set unique to the character to match her in the series; gourmet chocolate franchise Compartes released two new flavors named after the sisters- Jinx, a swirl of strawberry and matcha to match the color scheme of her chaotic and deadly use of explosives, and Vi, dark chocolate covered in 24 karat gold (edible, of course) that really packs a punch (pun intended); and most notably Secret Cinema, a live experience event that brings the world of Zaun to Los Angeles for a limited time where attendees can become a citizen of the undercity, join a gang and perform tasks, as well as interact with the iconic characters of the show!

As cases are on the rise again, just a friendly reminder for all geeks, gamers, and readers alike to abide by the COVID-19 health regulations- keep that distance 6 feet apart and wear masks always in a public setting. Even those vaccinated can still transmit the virus to others even if they show or feel no symptoms. Practice healthy habits, keep everyone safe. Now that that’s out of the way, let’s get into the GamerGeek’s 2021 Summer Hits.\n\nFirst on the list is Scarlet Nexus by Bandai Namco. Bandai is known for their anime-esque fantasy action-role playing adventures and Scarlet Nexus doesn’t disappoint as it super-soldier lands into the next generation consoles. The plot splits into two paths, both following a male and female protagonist respectively- players will need to play the game twice in order to understand the full story. While some may find that daunting, neither protagonists are the same and should be recognized as their own characters based on personality and game-play.\n\nThe story follows two young soldiers who once had a common goal in preserving the peace against aliens bent on wiping out all of humanity and eating their brains (Yep. That old plot). However, the twist in their diverging stories leads to both heroes finding themselves on opposite sides of the struggle, fighting each other tooth and nail to find the truth behind the mystery of the alien attacks and the sinister government plots playing in the shadows. While they could seriously just have talked over their issues over lunch, the badass combative plays when controlling these heroes are just too cool to pass up. Logic be damned!\n\nGetting into the gameplay, exploration is linear, setup like a dungeon-maze in which players can visit time and again to level-grind characters and materials for better gear. However, the grind really doesn’t feel all that repetitive as the combat system is what really sells the game. The protagonist and their companions (who insert themselves into the team as the story progresses) each have their own unique abilities that tailors to each dungeon's environment and unique enemies. One example and particularly devastating combo is being able to teleport while dishing out a flurry of fire attacks at melee range and throwing literally anything using telekinesis at a distance. On top of this, battles offer short and interactable cut-scenes when executing the right moves, making the button mashing oh-so-satisfying.\n\nIn addition to the combative game-play, players can also experience the story and forge bonds with the available companions in visual novel-esque style narratives, giving every cut-scene a quaint, refreshing take that differs from other story-driven anime-inspired rpgs. If simple yet stylish action adventures are on the list, Scarlet Nexus is the game to pick up. Available for on the PlayStation 4 & 5, Xbox One & Series X, and Microsoft Windows.\n\nNext up on the list is the favorite child from Square Enix’s staple- Final Fantasy VII Remake: Intergrade. The base game (FFVIIR) was originally released on the PS4 and received nothing but positive reviews for its nostalgic characters and storyline as well as bringing in new combat mechanics that were only shown in newer installments to the franchise such as the award-winning FFXV. Now, FFVIIR is available for the PS5 as a physical/digital copy as well as an upgrade for those with a PS4 copy looking to update their game with the new generation graphics. The update comes into the gaming scene with a brand new never been seen expansion that follows a certain iconic materia-stealing ninja- Yuffie Kisaragi.\n\nFrom the trailers, players can see that they not only control Yuffie but her new companion Sonan, a warrior from the same region. Both heroes infiltrate the dark and sinister underground labs of Shinra led scientist Prof. Hojo in the hopes to steal what they only know as the “Ultimate Materia”. The powerful bosses they encounter during their search may be some familiar faces to veterans of the series- supersoldiers subtly named after colors, Nero and Weiss, who were also boss enemies in the FFVII spin-off: Dirge of Cerberus.\n\nThe story is a fresh take, showing new sides to Yuffie that were never seen in the original game. So if anyone is looking for an action-packed modern fantasy role-playing adventure with a riveting story and characters as easy on the eyes as they are challenging to fight? Final Fantasy 7 Remake: Intergrade is the game to set sights and over-sized shurikens on. Available only on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.\n\nThis next one is a personal favorite, developed by Capcom is the latest installment to the popular Resident Evil series: Resident Evil: Village or otherwise known as RE8. Prior to the game’s release, the company built a lot of hype around the game’s lush and beautiful environments, suspense-inducing and engaging combat, and (most notably) their riveting and eye-catching characters. In return, they not only gathered a devoted fanbase, but received massively astounding positive reviews to match- critics praising both the story and action-driven gameplay to accompany their signature heart-racing scares.\n\nThe story takes place after the events of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard where players once again take control of Ethan Winters. After the horrifying events in the bayous of Louisiana, Ethan relocates to Eastern Europe with his wife Mia as well as their adorable baby girl named Rosemary. The happy family experiences tragedy when Mia is shot down by the very people that helped and relocated them- Chris Redfield being the one to pull the trigger. As he was being taken away, Ethan and his captors get attacked by an unknown force and the poor father finds himself fighting for his life in a remote village infested with bloody hungry zombies known as Lycans. He learns that his daughter was taken hostage within said village and takes up arms to find and rescue her all while learning about the deep, dark secrets that jump at him with bloody teeth bared.\n\nDue to the game’s impressive success and by popular demand, Capcom announced during E3 2021 that they are currently working on DLC content. At the moment, there is no information on what the DLC could pertain, but fans are already predicting (and hoping) that it will include more story content, maps, and characters. Fingers crossed that all of this comes true, especially anything that involves the Four Lords of RE8.\n\nResident Evil: Village is available for platforms PlayStation 4 & 5; Xbox One, Series X & S, and PC.\n\nThere are plenty of notable games available for Switch as well that deserve honorable mention but here are KindaGeeky’s top three picks: The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles (Capcom), Persona 5 Strikers (Atlus and Omega Force), Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (Nintendo).\n\nFor more info on any of these games, feel free to click on the links below and enjoy the rest of the summer filled with glorious gaming abandon.

What picks have made its way to the KindaGeeky scope this time? Well, games that are out now with the shiny newly released next-generation consoles- PS5 and the Xbox Series X.\n\nThis year, gamers unite over the new consoles that’ll make games so buttery smooth, Country Crock might just sue. Terrible jokes aside, both are hitting the holiday wish lists hard- completely sold out from all major retailers at the moment and are expected to restock for Black Friday and later following the few weeks into Christmas. This next generation console is the fastest, most powerful way to play yet with astonishing graphics and increased downloading and processing speeds for a more immersive gaming experience. On top of this, they’re backwards compatible! But let’s be real, it’s not about the statistics and performance- it’s the games. What games can the people play now on the PS5 and Xbox Series X and what can they expect in the near future?\n\nStarting off with the most highly anticipated PlayStation exclusive is Spider-Man: Miles Morales. The titular character has always been a fan-favorite for diehard comic fans, but that popularity cap flew off to the rooftops when Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse made its theatrical release. For those who have not seen the movie, it follows the teenage Miles Morales in his ascent to become the next friendly neighborhood hero and along the way, he comes across other Spidey companions from different universes in a show-stopping collaboration to defeat a league of baddies from, well, destroying the world. The movie was praised for its unique animation, amazing story-line, and top-notch action! It was a major success in the theaters, so naturally, the games that Sony releases in tribute to the Spidey franchises follow suit.\n\nComplete with high-flying action and bad guy bashing goodness, this video game’s take on the popular comic book franchise fulfills all the nerdy needs a gamer could possibly ask for. Since it’s release, Miles Morales has received nothing but positive reviews for its dynamic and explosive game play and story- the perfect kickoff to Sony’s new generation of gaming. The web-slinging action-adventure is out now with a deluxe edition that includes both the first PS4 Spider-Man entry in all of its re-mastered glory and the original title release bundled with unique skins to show off in the city of New York.\n\nNext up on the list is available now for both the PS5 and XBOX series X is Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla. From the old sands of Egypt to the breathtaking plains of Ancient Greece, AC fans have to wonder where Ubisoft will take them next. What they pleasantly didn’t expect was riding the cart back to...SKYRIM! Just kidding- Britain! AS A VIKING! The players control Eivor and just like in Odyssey, Eivor can be male or female depending on the character’s preference and it has little impact on the game’s story as well as their interaction with the massive open world. Much of the mechanics and game play from Origins and Odyssey makes its way to Valhalla with improved utilization of weapons and animal companions as well as improved strategic approaches when dealing with different enemies. As a Viking leader, the player can also lead their own raiding parties in the name of conquest against the Templar Order. It is noted to be the most innovative Assassin’s Creed yet and by the looks of it, Ubisoft took a step in the right direction.\n\nUp next: Godfall. Where to begin? As one reviewer described, if Warframe and Destiny had a super shiny baby- Godfall would be it. GamerGeek’s description? Same concept but if that baby was adopted by Kratos and the cast of Devil May Cry, that would be more accurate. The player controls Orin, some space war-leader that sounds an awful lot like Liam Neeson, who is bent on stopping his brother Macros from ascending to godhood and taking over the universe. It’s a Cain and Abel concept that has been used time and again in gaming, but on this level of literal beauty- it simply works. Similar to Destiny, the players can explore open maps and collect loot from monsters they beat into submission (because money coming out of aliens after backhanding them with a claymore is a concept that makes sense). The loot can be used to upgrade the armor set that players can unlock as they progress (like Warframe). Basically, the more players kill things and grind for loot, the better the stuff and the more doors or areas unlock. It’s a simple premise, but with the plethora of different enemies to hack different weapons into and the challenging boss fights with every map- it is bound to attract gamers that are itching for a fight and a way to test their mechanics and reaction time (the game relies on the five Ds- dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge)!\n\nThis one is a personal favorite. Devil May Cry V: Special Edition, an expanded and upgraded version of the fifth installation of the primary DMC series although it is the sixth released by Capcom for the franchise as a whole. The hack-and-slash epitome of the stylish genre makes its way to the PS5 in all of its graphically enhanced glory. Other than the obvious fact that it looks amazing, the optimization in game-play exploration and combat reaches hellish levels of sheer badassity that will make veterans and newcomers of the DMC franchise button mash without a break! What’s higher than that top? The overarching villain, Vergil takes the epicness over by becoming a playable character with his own devilish play style that’ll make the samurais from the Edo bow in respect. What’s the story of DMC5? Well, Vergil hires Vergil’s brother and Vergil’s son to kill Vergil. Confused? Don’t be, not only will the ride make sense, but it’ll be action-packed and full of epic style that’ll have players satisfied as they dish out smoking combos upon their demonic enemies! The game comes highly recommended and was received positively on the original DMCV’s release and this enhanced edition is expected to enrich the experience to returning and new players. It is available now digitally but a physical release is scheduled to release on December 1st.\n\nA special mention calls out to Cyberpunk 2077, the most highly anticipated game of the year...in all of its buggy glory. It’s available now for the PC and the next-gen consoles but at the moment, there are reports across the board of glitches and crashes that kind of made players understand why there were as many delays as there was. While still fun and action-packed with a great story and well-fleshed characters, for a more enriching experience, gamers would be more interested in picking up the game as soon as the patches drop from CD Projekt Red that aim to fix those bugs in the first quarter of 2021. As they say, patience is a virtue, Samurai.\n\nGod of War: Ragnarok (official title pending) which has yet to have an official release date and will only be available for the PS5 is also a top pick that is predicted to contend with Cyberpunk 2077 for game of the year! Until that time comes, check out these other different games that are available now! More info can be found below.

Not in the mood to turn on the television and that console? Don’t feel like turning on the monitor and clicking that mouse? Running out of things to look at on social media or the internet but don’t feel like putting down that phone…Well, don’t put down that phone! In light of recent events, most gamers are suddenly finding free time on their hands. For those looking for handheld games to enjoy the time passing, here are some that are definitely worth checking out.\n\nFirst on the list is a personal favorite: TeamFight Tactics Mobile, a game developed by Riot Games. Avid Egamers will know that Riot is behind one of the world’s top played and most famous MOBA games League of Legends (also a personal favorite) and the team has expanded their branches, giving strategy a fun, new direction in the form of auto chess. While TFT was first introduced in the League of Legends PC client as a separate game mode, Riot released this game as an independent app on mobile in March. The game starts off with a total of 8 players on their own board. On each round, players build economy (gold) and spend their earnings on units to play on their board with the hopes to build the unbeatable team. The cool thing about this autochess game is that the player can move all of their units in every round, changing the dynamic every time, which means that setting all of their characters on one side of the board will have them direct focus more on the units standing on the same side when faced against opponents or if they have a team that excels in spreading out, they can strategically sprinkle their units on different parts of the board and watch mayhem unfold. Honestly, watching a sword-wielding character slash at huge juggernaut units aimlessly like a washing machine and somehow winning is oddly satisfying. The player will have to think on their toes on the kind of team they want to build as well as the equipment they want to give them as they are picked up along the rounds. Want to make it to the top 4 in a game of TFT? Riot’s TeamFight Tactics Mobile is free-to-play and available for download now on the App Store and Google Play.\n\nThis is not the only game Riot has released for the LoL universe either. Legends of Runeterra, their brand new take on the card game-genre made its debut to the mobile world on April 30th. This is another form of strategy that provides more in-depth character dynamic and abilities through card effects and special interactions players would have otherwise only seen on Summoners’ Rift. Fans of League will surely appreciate the ability to intricately and intimately strategize around their favorite champions while dueling on the boards to be the best. The strategy is simple: each turn a sort of mana/economy system increases for both players allowing them to play cards according to their cost. The player with the best execution and is able to reduce their opponents nexus points (also known as HP) to zero first wins the game. Sounds easy, but the road to get to that endgame will be hard as the opponent will be reacting to everything the player dishes out, keeping both parties on their toes (or the edge of their seats). Personally, there is just something so gratifying about building a deck from the ground up and watching the combo animations for each card that lays down go off for a sweet play and claim the victory. Interested in playing? Legends of Runeterra is available to download on the AppStore and Googleplay for mobile Apple iPhone and Android IOS as well as PC. And while enjoying these games, keep an eye out for more League of Legends content, they will be looking to release the rift onto mobile with the upcoming staple Wild Rift (screams of excitement from beyond the LCD screen).\n\nWith all of the hype for Square Enix's Final Fantasy 7 Remake, gamers ask, “Where else is there a riveting storyline, compelling gameplay with rpg elements, and eyecandy character designs on top of it all?”. Well, if they’re looking for a challenging strategy game that is all about positioning, dealing out devastating spells and combos with characters both pleasing to the eye and with have great backstories, Final Fantasy Brave Exvius: War of the Visions is the way to go. Piggybacking off the success of the original mobile game, War of the Visions is the next installment of the next epic adventure where the players control several protagonists integral to the story. There are new faces, of course; however, the nostalgia that Square Enix has been famous for as of late brings back some popular and familiar characters throughout the Final Fantasy universe. For example, not too long after the launch, Y’shtola, the badass mage Miqo’te from Final Fantasy XIV makes an appearance as Mega card (nope, not epic, but better!!) where she is able to deal tons of powerful area of effect spells that can almost sweep an entire map when placed on the field.\n\nThe game itself plays a lot like Fire Emblem, especially Three Houses, where characters are placed on a map and movement is locked onto a grid system. When two enemies are in range for battle, they pose off a storm like an episode of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure until one person outflexes the other. It is exactly as memetastic as it sounds. The battle ends when one side clears the board of enemies and the victor claims the spoils in forms of currency that can be used to summon more characters to their ever-growing arsenal.\n\nSpeaking of memetic, this next game is an absolutely fan-favorite classic. The critically acclaimed platformer Castlevania makes its gothic way to mobile with installments Symphony of the Night and Rondo of Blood available in one bloody vampire-slaying, badass package. If anyone recognizes the Netflix series, this is one of the countless games in the series that kicked off the franchises’ popularity and serves as the inspiration behind seasons 1 and 2. The player has the option of controlling the popular anti-hero Alucard who goes on a quest to vanquish his genocidal father Dracula in a castle that for some reason is impossibly and deceptively larger on the inside than it appears out.\n\nThe traversal between areas are side-scrolling maps which means that movement is two-dimensional, offering that old-school gameplay that relies on reaction time and good prediction of pixel space when crossing against enemies or those hero-hating moving platforms (why they exist in the castle, no one knows except Dracula’s interior designer). While trying to survive the already difficult maps, the players will be pitted against hundreds of demon enemies with insane hit boxes that will almost always land know matter how far down Alucard crouches. But worry not, Alucard has his own tricks up his sleeve with his trusty saber, the ability to turn in various animals, super speed, and the ever important plot-armor. Reaching the end of the map makes the grueling and bloody journey worthwhile and the end-result satisfying. There are other characters that the players can control as well, and they must download the game to find out (mwahaha). Castlevania: SotN is available for download now on the App Store and Google Play for $2.99.\n\nFor more information on all of these games, check out the links below.

But with the video game industry riding nonstop to the top of nerdom, it appears that cosplay rides first class with no signs of stopping. The Gamer Geek never had any doubt (no, seriously)!\n\nCosplay has been around for years, starting first in the motherland of creative costuming: Japan. It began as a show of support for Japanese fashion in anime. The trend there began to pick up and spread across the rest of the world, most notably America where popular cosplay conventions like Anime Expo, San Diego Comic Con, and Blizzcon make home to the largest gatherings the geek scene has ever seen. Prior to cosplay becoming a coined term, America did have its own costuming events as well, although the fandom was significantly smaller at the time as “nerdy stuff” like Star Wars and Marvel/DC Comics weren’t considered “cool” in that present, but look at the nerds now! Once the appreciation for comic books and movies that were once classified as “nerdy” came to the spotlight of swagger, cosplay began to boom significantly. Then beyond the movies and comic books, video games took center stage in the cosplay world as many nerds evolved to gamer nerds (and it’s not even their final form).\n\nHot-rated MMO (massive multiplayer online) games of today like League of Legends (LoL), Overwatch (OW), and World of Warcraft (WoW) heavily inspires cosplayers to dress up (or in certain cases, armor up) as their favorite character, expressing both love and support for their fandom. Riot, the developing team behind the PC tycoon League of Legends has an incredible creative team who highly encourages fans to cosplay the characters they put so much depth and heart into. Delving into the LoL website, fans are even given access to the piece-by-piece character models of the characters and their aesthetics, further emphasizing that cosplay motivation (not kidding, some files even read cosplay). In 2019, LoL cosplays hit the all-time-high with the release of the late-2018 3D-animated K-POP music video appropriated named “POP/STARS” comprised of fictional characters from the League-universe: Kai’sa, Akali, Ahri, and Evelyn - forming the world-renowned K/DA. These four girls in-game are AP assassins that snowball hard with the right kill-death-assist (KDA) ratios (badum tss!) and when they were featured with their aesthetic new designs, danced through the video with awe-styling choreography (thanks to the choreo team down below), voices backed by real-life music artists, and tuned a beat that “topped the World Digital Charts” - it’s no wonder they became the most widely popular cosplay of 2019. Speaking from experience, it was a wonderful feeling to have other cosplayers and photographers recognize the characters and designs despite not playing the games themselves as it just means that the teams behind League are getting exposure for their jaw-dropping content and thus will continue to have eyes and support for their works. In the first quarter of 2020 Riot has invited cosplayers for a competition dedicated to the game, where it will be hosted in Europe but extended to all online. More information about it can be found in the credits at the end of this post.\n\nBlizzcon, one of the biggest gaming conventions in the USA, is hosted by none other than Blizzard Entertainment, the team behind the widely popular MMOs World of Warcraft and Overwatch. The con is host to one of the top cosplay gatherings in the world, offering a wide variety of larger than life costuming from giant life-sized Reinhardts (OW) to beautiful badass Sylvanas’. The weekend is teamed with master-tier cosplays that would make any attendees drop their jaw in awe. No joke, the craftsmanship is amazing; one can only imagine the amount of time and effort it takes to bring the intricate designs and intricate details of armor, fabric, makeup, special effects to life (some examples can be found below). And almost each and every cosplay is inspired and dedicated by video games.\n\nConsole games receive a lot of love from the cosplay community as well. For the past several years, they simmer within the anime and comic book convention scenes in obscurity yet everyone goes crazy when they recognize Leon Kennedy from the timeless Resident Evil series swaggering in the halls with a broody, signature side bangs and police vest on or spot Sora from Square Enix’s Kingdom Hearts flip onto the floor with his massive keyblade and obscenely large shoes. And now, there are conventions that are dominated by the cosplay scene- and they’re totally centered on video games! Even upcoming video games get some love from cosplayers. Aside from being one of the most popular actors of 2019 with the success of John Wick 3: Parabellum and Always Be My Maybe, Keanu Reeves enters the gaming scene by starring as the charismatic anarchist Johnny Silverhand (also a John, what a coincidence) of the highly anticipated, futuristic rpg game Cyberpunk 2077. Featured by Microsoft at E3 and developed by CD Projekt Red (same people behind the popular Witcher game series) John Wick 2077- err, Cyberpunk 2077 received a hype so massive that the minute Keanu Reeves appeared in the trailer and on the stage, people began to don a military vest, a shiny metal arm (probably borrowed from the Winter Soldier), and a pair of sweet shades to then proceed to yell at figurative samurais to wake up. After seeing dozens and dozens of these cosplayers’ take on the Silverhand- let’s just say they’re breathtaking.

In 2018, Capcom took the gaming world by storm with the release of the critically acclaimed MMO Monster Hunter World, the latest major console installation for the Monster Hunter series, the faithful remake of the horror classic Resident Evil 2, and the latest chapter of the origin of stylish action genre: Devil May Cry 5 (already mentioned in the previous article, mentioned again because the game is amazing!).\n\nMonster Hunter World (MHW) is...well, exactly as it sounds. Players control a budding hunter of their own customization and are thrown onto an island to “research” the traits of territorial (and often obscenely large) beasts. And by “research”, that really means invading the poor unsuspecting inhabitants of scaly and furry variety, beat them (and what looks like tiny and same-sized versions of the target which is probably their kids and close friends trying to prevent you from committing genocide) to death for the purpose of harvesting their skin and flesh for wear and sustenance. Yes, sustenance. The meat that the players gather from their kills are taken back to the hunter base to be prepped and cooked by sentient cat buddies (no joke) which are then eaten for stat bonuses for future hunts and the cycle starts over again. As dark and dismal as it sounds (for the monsters), the world of MHW is both vibrant and beautiful. The developers behind MHW really put in some deep thought to bring out the colors from the blades of grass to the light cast over the forests and rocky landscapes to the scales of the vicious behemoth dragons players will eventually have to face. The detail doesn’t simply stop at simply the environment and AI. No, the real hook that brings players to this world everyday (yes, even to this day) is the ability for players to control and customize nearly every aspect of their hunters that best fits their unique play style. Want a hunter that looks like an armored tank but runs like a ninja equipped with a bow that for some reason functions like a rocket launcher? The game offers ways to create different armor and skill sets that are dependent on what kills hunters bring back to base once they have braved the wilds. The stronger the monsters they take down, the better the gear. Found a monster that is just too difficult to handle alone? Easy, bring a friend; bring several or some really nice (and powerful) randoms on the innerwebs to raid against the beast together. That’s right, MHW allows players to fight alongside each other and it is glorious. The best thing about it is that there are no level requirements for players to queue up together, so if there is a mighty need to gather the best equipment as fast as possible, rally those powerful friends (or some super nice randoms) and dive headfirst towards gratifyingly difficult and fun times. Monster Hunter World is currently Capcom’s top=selling and most played game to boot in 2019 and there is no sign of slowing with the next expansion coming soon to freeze over every gamer’s summer: Monster Hunter World Iceborne.\n\nSpeaking of latest installations, this next masterpiece from Capcom takes zombie horror fans back to Raccoon City for a wonderfully frightening nostalgia trip: Resident Evil 2. This faithful remake of the 1998 title of the same name follows two heroes: Claire Redfield, a young woman searching for her brother, and Leon Kennedy, a police officer for the Raccoon Police Department. The story kicks off after the first Resident Evil (RE) that started it all where an airborne malady called the T-Virus decimates the majority of the entire population by killing them and reanimating the infected into mindless and ravenous zombies. The player can choose to play through the campaign of one of the two heroes, offering a different story for each perspective for a full-fleshed experience and grasp of everything that goes down. Everything about this game was built from the ground up to cater to fans who have been with the RE series from the beginning as well as invite new players to experience the classic survival horror first-hand with modern consoles. Now, to the gameplay…It plays similarly to the Evil Within series, players carefully traverse zombie-infested buildings armed with a flashlight and a gun. Developers have removed the fixed camera from the original game to allow players greater perspective when switching between combat and stealth as well as improved control in exploration. From there, much of the progression relies on collecting items that will help keep the player alive along with providing lore for the story. Reaching certain areas of the maps will trigger jump scares where one hopes they have nerves of steel and reflexes to fight or flight. More often than not, it will be flight, especially against a certain trench-coat wearing man who somehow manages to catch up to the protagonists by walking whilst they are sprinting for their lives. Fun fact, hiding will not work and fighting back will do nothing in the remake (no matter how much wishful thinking that it would otherwise). Like most Capcom games, RE2 Remake is relatively short, reported gameplay of both campaigns in one go being as short as an entire weekend (sleep and thumbs aren’t important, anyways). Given that, that does not mean that players simply drop the game and move onto the next. No, the fantastic thing about Capcom Games is that they encourage replayability over and over again with harder difficulties and additional story content: The 4th Survivor and The Tofu Survivor. The success of RE2 Remake has given the green light for developers to remake other horror classics (fingers crossed for Resident Evil 4). For those that simply cannot wait, the rest of the RE titles are available now for the PS4, XB1, and the Nintendo Switch.\n\nLast but not least, the smokin’ sexy stylish hit that solidified Capcom’s place at the top of Q1 2019 in gaming as well as more than likely skyrocketed pizza sales worldwide is Devil May Cry V. For those unfamiliar with the series, Devil May Cry (DMC) is the hack-and-slash title that sets the bar for stylish action and extreme combat gameplay, inspiring titles such as Bayonetta and God of War. DMC 5 is the fifth installation of the series, although it is the sixth title of its name (no one talks about the reboot) and takes place sometime after DMC 2. The story follows three devil hunters: the icon of the franchise, Dante of renowned demon-slaying fame with a love-and-hate relationship with motorcycles and pizza; rising devil hunter Nero from DMC 4 who cut his 90s boy band hair and loses his arm due to family issues (woops, spoilers?); and a new, mysterious character named V who has a tendency to read poetry while beating his enemies to a bloody pulp with a bird, a giant black cat, and a goop monster that springs forth from his tattoos (believe it or not, he’s even more extra as he gets stronger through customization). Each hero has his own unique play style which offers a fun variety for fans to enjoy as they progress through the story. Other than the arsenal of badass and improbable weapons and skills that make the game stand proudly, another feature that was unavailable in the previous games was the free camera system for improved exploration and traversal. Fans have always raged whenever the scene and views change completely once their hero steps a pixel over to the next environment and get especially frustrated when the scene shift happens in the middle of a boss fight (eyeing the infernal tarantula and the weird blob thing that shoots lasers from the first game). With Devil May Cry 5, there is no such issue, allowing smoother action sequences and a better appreciation for the world’s environment. The story itself, while also short, leaves the desire to want more content. While the developers have already disclosed that there are no plans for future DLC for DMC 5 (unless the higher ups can be convinced otherwise), the fun does not stop after the campaign. Once the story has been completed, players can put their skills to the test with unlocked difficulties (one of which sets the parameters to basically have the gamer play as if they’ve been thrown in the world of Dark Souls) as well as the return of the Bloody Palace mode where survival is key to come out on top. Beating the new game mode as well as the harder difficulties earns the player bragging rights for certain, but the game also rewards them with new aesthetics that have unique effects when used in combat. For example, beating all levels of the Bloody Palace with V will unlock the extra ex-provocation taunt that will change his cane to a literal lightsaber (Capcom has embraced the Kylo Ren meme and it is glorious). Devil May Cry 5 became the number one selling game in its launch and is available now for PS4, XB1, and PC.\n\nThe world has its eye on Capcom now and cannot wait to see what else they have in store for gamers everywhere.

This post is truly going for the stylish points this time around and the best games of all time score at the top. Let’s count them down!\n\nSeated at the top of the throne is a personal favorite. Whose? EVERYONE, BOY! Or girl or whatever starfish is reading this! God of War, the fourth installment to the critically acclaimed action-adventure game of the same name by Santa Monica Studios released on the PS4 (Sorry, Xbox). This series follows the story of the titular anti-hero Kratos who is comparably a Spartan Batman. He goes on an epic adventure with his son Atreus (not Atreyu from The Neverending Story, sorry) to find the tallest mountain peak in the universe (literally) and spread the ashes of his recently deceased wife (the poor man has a strange habit of being in these tragic circumstances). Like with any other God of War game, the player comes across epic monsters to fight along with gods to slay. While the story has a riveting narrative, what catches the players’ eyes are the enthralling and breathtaking graphics and seamless camera direction. There are no cutscenes that interrupt the gameplay which offers a smooth transition that really makes it hard to put the controller down as it literally is like an endless rollercoaster. Still not convinced? Well, this game was nominated GAME OF THE YEAR (2018) for a reason, it would be an injustice not to pick it up and try it yourself.\n\nNeed another epic odyssey adventure to add to the list? No, it is not Assassin’s Creed Odyssey although that game too comes highly recommended for its amazing open world, rpg elements, this blog is steering more towards the long, LONG awaited Kingdom Hearts III. This story is driven mainly from the perspective of the main hero (who is just as iconic as Kratos), Sora, a spirited Keyblade wielder who travels through the many universes of Disney, Pixar, and Final Fantasy / Square Enix, to restore the hearts of the world and defeat shadowy beings called Heartless and their heartless counterparts called Nobodies. Confused? Play through the series and try to make sense of it. Although not quite literally the third game of the ongoing Kingdom Hearts franchise (as there are more than a handful of other titles under the name other than 1 and 2), KH3 is the latest iteration of the series that ties up the main antagonist’s Xehanort’s story known as the Darkseeker Saga, an old (and sometimes young??) Keyblade master (everyone has one of these, Sora stopped being special after awhile) who is trying to take over Kingdom Hearts (still have no idea what it is). This means that the series is still going! So why do people come back for more?! Easy, the game offers a unique combat system that pretty much puts the series on its own level. Never mind the fact that the player smacks monsters around with a giant key, but the game offers special summons that pulls iconic characters from the Disney and Final Fantasy universe together for that fan-service fun along with some new mechanics that has Sora LITERALLY summon rides from the Disney parks to his aid. On top of this, he’s accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy. Who doesn’t want to see that? Hyuck! KH3 is available now for the PS4 and XB1 which means that everyone except for those who only play on the PC and Nintendo Switch can hop onto this magical ride of confusing fantasy that they most definitely won’t be able to get enough of.\n\nNext is an upcoming game that will be the latest of another popular series, and long awaited for the writer of this blog; and is going to earn stylish points across the board for all gamers. This is Devil May Cry V! In case it isn’t clear, V means the fifth installment of the series (no one talks about the reboot) that picks up after the story after Devil May Cry 2. It follows from the perspective of Nero, a young demon hunter who opened his own hunting business and has his prosthetic arm taken from him by an unknown enemy (not cool, dude). But don’t worry, he gets a new arm made by a southern girl that drives their truck that looks an awful lot like a mobile home. Along the way, he fights alongside the iconic Dante, the original protagonist of the Devil May Cry series, who also happens to run his own demon hunting shop and is Nero’s rambunctious uncle (it must run in the family) as well as a new mysterious character name V (his real name is Vitale, but this is how he is introduced as an ode to the title) who hires Dante to help defeat the ultimate evil (how the stories usually go). What makes these series so loved is their unique stylish action combat that offers breathtaking ways to take down epic monsters in a variety of fashions depending on how the player wants to fight them whether it be a mechanical arm that can be used as a surfboard (not kidding), a motorcycle that can split into two hacksaws (not kidding and cool as hell), or a fedora hat (still not kidding). To top it all off, the game is also set to offer a co-op experience which ideally means that players can play with their friends offline or online controlling either of these three dashing guys for some serious devil beat downs, more info on clearing up how this will work has yet to be revealed but Devil May Cry V will come crashing into local game business on March 8th of 2019 so mark those calendars and hold onto the pizza box for dear life (veteran fans will get this).\n\nAnd that about wraps it up for this article; still need to know more?

More like Devils Making Zer0PM Cry: Ultimate Edition (Behold! The terrible jokes are back) and every single second of this glorious, painful classic was worth all of the tears (and the more occurring spouts of rage). For those that have been living under a rock, 2018’s E3 and Gamescon has dropped the official gameplay trailers for Capcom’s next installment of the critically acclaimed stylish action series: Devil May Cry 5. And what better way to prepare for demon-slaying than to go back to its roots with the Devil May… Look, just read the title and move on to the important bits!\n\nThis HD Collection comes complete with the first three Devil May Cry games released. Before going to the pros, it is imperative to point out the cons to each of these games. Keep in mind, these games are not remakes, they are remasters and the thing about remasters is that they basically translate to enhanced graphics and gameplay of the original works with little to no tampering to the mechanics. What this means is that the games look better, the frame rate runs smoother, and has very few bugs (upside). However, as mentioned that the mechanics for the most part were left unchanged, they have those frustrating camera angles that gives the player free roam on a set view…they just can’t change that view ever even as the scene changes the further the player progresses in each map. This can be excruciatingly annoying, especially during boss battles as it can throw off the flow of anyone trying to beat down super hard monsters based on their fight patterns (and it doesn’t help that for nearly every boss fight, a single hit can be close to fatal – poor, paper-thin hero). To be honest, even with the “enhancements” there is much from these classic games that truly “brings you back” in both good and bad ways as it truly tests the reflex control of players as well as their patience (lots of it). The bad parts critiqued in the originals are not a discredit by any means to the creative and development team as this series will forever offer an exhilarating experience for old and new fans. Ahead is a refresher of what each of their stories entail…\n\nDevil May Cry is the first of the games released in 2001, the time when a game like this and Onimusha became the nightmare for little girls (totally not speaking from personal experience), and set the standards of what is now called “stylish” games. What defines a game as stylish? Well, how would one rate a white-haired, red trench coat-wearing badass shooting actual demons with handguns apparently hacked with enough ammo to put any military force out of commission dual with slashing with an improbably long and impossibly cool sword, which by the way stabbed the dude clean in the chest like a kebob, as said demons are sprouting out of the ceilings from their ominous portals of hell? Yes. At that point, the scale of awesomeness is broken. Moving forward with the plot, the player controls the gunslinging, sword-swinging, rambunctious hero Dante, a half-demon (cause why not?), half-human hybrid fighting against the forces of darkness after hired by the mysterious Trish who bares an uncanny resemblance to his dead mother. After struggling with what appears to be an Oedipus-complex, Dante agrees to this enigmatic woman’s request (right after she throws a motorcycle at him and wrecks his shop) and travels to an island in the middle of effin’ nowhere where he must explore an eerie castle (of course) in pursuit of destroying the ultimate evil – all within the time span of returning back to said decimated shop and finally give it an effin’ name before dinner gets cold (hint: he ends up calling it the game title). Playing through the game, the atmosphere of the castle Dante explores sets the tone: dark, creepy, and ready for some serious stuff to go down. The fights keep the players on their toes and that is not only due to the monsters they raise their sword too, but as mentioned before the camera angles that constantly change – a feature beyond manual control unfortunately. This game is certainly the hardest but it will forever hold a special place in the hearts of DMC veterans as the original stylish game.\n\nDevil May Cry 2 takes place years after the events of the first game which zeroes in on a plot that has basically nothing to do with its predecessor. Dante comes across an evil relic in a museum he breaks into to help out another chick that recruits him into fighting another mega boss threatening to drown the world in chaos. Nothing new but still badass. Judging by said the new female companion’s accent, the game takes place in France, traversing between some abandoned village on the mountainside which immediately gets bombed down by demons not long after Dante’s arrival to an equally abandoned sky scraping city which also gets reduced to smithereens once the hero beats down the boss before the eldritch abomination decides to invite him over to its hellish pad for one final standoff. Capcom might as well rename this one Europe May Cry because whatever is left of it will certainly shed some tears in the form of rubble as soon as the hero places a steel-toed boot on its asphalt. This one received the least favorable reviews out of the three for its poor story direction that held almost no correlation to the other storylines and incredibly short gameplay. Hopefully with the release of the fifth installation, it will somewhat make sense but until then the only thing worth praising is the fluid combat style and character design of the iconic hero.\n\nDevil May Cry 3 is not a sequel but a prequel to the first game taking place during the time Dante’s twin brother was alive and lucid and not some sort of mind-slave to some jerkoff demon in which the said demon serves as a final boss (it should be noted that Bayonetta’s final boss bears an eerie resemblance in appearance and combat – nice nod, Capcom). Apparently both brothers are on opposite sides of the forces of good and evil as Virgil, the blue trench coat-wearing, katana-wielding twin (that’s what he’ll be referred as from now on) summons a giant tower out of nowhere which apparently to Dante was an invitation to climb said incredibly evil-looking, demon-infested structure (to the top) for a family reunion that pits them to a duel, presumably to the death, for a necklace that served as a memento to their deceased mother as it holds the key to unlocking a dastardly ploy to submerge the world in total darkness (bear in mind, it was night when the setting took place so that seems rather redundant in the literal sense). In this one, Dante’s female companion rides a decked out motorcycle with enough firearms to give the hero a run for his money and a personality that screams “daddy issues”. Out of the three games, this one was certainly the easiest and offered a cleaner combat style especially when traversing through each of the maps. This and the assortment of unique weapons Dante collects throughout the game which he obtains after defeating some fairly entertaining bosses (cause defeat equals friendship), the combat offers a variety of different fighting styles to change it up for the player to upkeep and improve their level of badassity without losing its luster lacking in the first two games.\n\nEach game has their charms but the common factor is their ability to reel players in with their cool and slick combat system that makes anyone want to just sit in front of their television for hours sending demons back to the pits of hell in style. Additional treats the players may find throughout each of the series is the questionably and conveniently placed motorcycles that seem to make an appearance in some form or another in the stylish slash-and-shoot series. And now with the latest DMC gameplay trailer released during Gamescon, the player can now use a god damn motorcycle as a weapon!! A WEAPON!!! How cool is that?! So if that gets anyone hyped, pre-order Devil May Cry 5 today and prepare yourselves with the HD Collection until its launch in March 2019. Until then, devil-slayers, remember to stay… Kinda Geeky.\n\nInstead of featuring one game this in article, THREE games will be given special mention in this nerdy post! To kick off the spooky month, these games will not only make players run for the hills…to their nearest game shop, but give a bone-chilling experience like no other. Be warned there are spoilers again so for those faint of heart, TURN BACK NOW.\n\n…..Still here? Great, moving on!\n\nThe legendary creator Shinji Mikami who directed and produced the hit horror survival series Resident Evil births a new terrifying adventure of unprecedented proportions where it will mess with gamers' minds (literally) - high-pitched screams go out to The Evil Within 2. What does one think when they hear Resident Evil? The most common answers would be zombies and eldritch abominations, guns, and an evil organization bent on world domination of the human race using a science experiment/project that goes completely awry. Sounds about right? Well, this game and its prequel follow the same premise only without fighting across hordes throughout a doomed city, the player is running through the nightmarish world….OF SOMEONE ELSE’S MIND! Whoa, that’s a serious mindblow there (APPLAUSE)! Taking place right after the first game where the protagonist ace detective Sebastian Castellanos is forced into the horrified cesspool of a mind of a dangerously intelligent and vindictive scientist named Ruvik; bent on killing everyone in his dream world to spite the possibly just as evil ruthless organization MOBIUS. The device used to link Sebastian's mind and everyone else that went with him to Ruvik's mind is called STEM. This is a machine designed to create a world within the world of a person's mind that can be explored by others. It was a project meant to explore the memories and experiences of the main mind and all linked to it – clearly that theme park never sailed towards the sunset. After defeating Ruvik (or- err…his mind? That ending was left ambiguous), Sebastian returns to drinking and bad habits to deal with the traumas he has faced in the STEM world, which leads to him losing his job at the department (ouch). 3 years later, a STEM machine resurfaces under a new name UNION with the core at this new Inception world being Lily Castellanos. Same last name? That’s right, the core to the next breed of nightmares is Sebastian's daughter. One could only imagine how creative a world made by a cutthroat organization that kidnapped a little girl who was most likely terrified out of her wits would look. In this new world, it is collapsing and with Lily slowly dying inside her own mind setting the foundation for Sebastian's next wonderful adventure to save her. Developed by Tango Gameworks and released by Bethesda, the Evil Within 2 will test the boundaries of how much one’s stomach and heart can take as well as define the meaning of true survival horror.\n\nNext on the list is released exclusively for the PlayStation VR (and Steam) – a murder mystery full of mystery and more questions than answers that test not only one’s investigative skills but their bravery: The Invisible Hours. The premise of the game finds seven people invited to a party by a wealthy and powerful figure Nikola Tesla (anyone open a history book lately?…How about a Wikipedia page?) a world famous electrical engineer and inventor of the early 1900s. The developers Tequila Works delve deeper into US History by giving Tesla a complex and eerie personality by making him blackmail his own guests, all who apparently hold secrets one would find disinclined to disclose to the public (Oh, one of these guests also happen to be Thomas Edison, that very same one that everyone SHOULD know from the history books). Safe to say, there’s no love for the “gracious” host (even used fingers to further accentuate the emphasis of the quoted adjective). Due to this, the party takes a surprising twist when the host is found murdered in his own house! Queue in the dramatic music and lightning strike sound effects (the setting takes place during an actual storm too. With no immediate evidence of who would commit such a crime and their motives behind it, everyone turns up to be a suspect (Yes, INCLUDING THE PLAYER)! From there the player has complete access throughout the beautifully detailed mansion to find the clues that not only prove innocence and guilt (probably a mixture of both in the process), but to uncover the mystery behind the sudden and gruesome death of Tesla. The story doesn’t just follow the actions of the player either. As time progresses and clues are found, even whilst passing through the halls of such a grand mansion (where apparently the only resident after the incident is a blind assistant – ahem ahem, suspicious…..), events amongst the other suspects will trigger as well so the player can not only learn more about the characters shut in together in the house but experience the drama in first-person perspective in what the developers call “immersive theatre”. Who is the killer? Why kill Tesla (other than for the blackmail, obviously)? Why did Tesla invite these people? What do they have in common (Bet money says they don’t)? Who’s next? DUN DUN DUUUUUUN!\n\nLast but not least and the GamerGeek’s personal favorite, major shout out to all Lord of the Rings fans, it is here and out for release – Middle-Earth: Shadow of War. This highly anticipated game developed by Monolith Productions and produced by Warner Bros. is a direct sequel to the positively acclaimed game Shadow of Mordor. It follows the story of the ranger Talion of Gondor risen and possessed from the depths of death’s pit by his spectral companion elven lord Celebrimbor – both undead, vengeful men who simply walk into the orc-infested black plains of Mordor to show the Dark Lord Sauron a thing or two about the hellish art of raising armies into battle. This epic adventure is a must have for all J.R.R. Tolkien fans and those familiar with the Batman: Arkham series as it meshes together the mysticism of the medieval - fantasy genre and the one-of-a-kind stealth combat system that requires more than just smashing the same buttons over and over for the same attack combo as well as a unique recruiting system which allows the players to basically mind-control enemies to bend to their every whim. Not nearly as scary as the previously mentioned games, the amount of difficulty set in the game as well as the sheer fact that orcs will practically chase you down until the ends of the earth for so much as looking at them funny does get the heart pumping like no other.\n\nThese hit games are released now so boot up that console or computer, dim down the lights and pray the monsters don’t instakill on the first try; because all of these games are worth the adrenaline rush. More info and gameplay videos will be provided below. As always, thanks for reading and remember to stay…KindaGeeky!\n\nNo, the title is not a typo. It was completely intentional because name-dropping is what the GamerGeek does best. Moving on! Welcome, Guardians, to Zer0PM’s tips and tricks guide to the newly released critically acclaimed online-multiplayer FPS (first-person shooter) video game: Destiny 2. Developed by Bungie and published by Activision, some people may recognize Bungie as the creator of the popular FPS game Halo (dropping some familiar characters like Master Chief and Cortana to jog the memory) which was first released by Microsoft for the Xbox systems in 2001. Now they’ve moved on to greater projects with the Destiny series which is now released on all platforms. It follows the same genre of military science-fiction where the player controls the hero assigned with the daunting task of saving not only their own world but the entire universe from malevolent space creatures (since alien sounded too bland) that threaten to either dominate it or destroy it.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the Destiny series or what the plot entails, let’s start with the first game. The player awakens in a dystopian automobile graveyard where they are apparently brought back to life by a chatty floating robotic fairy light called a Ghost that wastes no time in informing them that they are chosen by a giant ball in the sky to combat the evil forces that now terrorize the Earth. The giant ball in the sky is called The Traveler which not even civilization can pinpoint its origins (just know that it’s super big and super old), but apparently it travels (get it?) from planet to planet to bestow the inhabitants with a special superpower called the Light (doesn’t take a wild guess on what the antagonist forces that combat this are called……..Darkness, if that wasn’t clear). These powers of Light are divided into three: Void (darkness, ironic), Solar (fire, duh), and Arc (lightning, not so obvious). Knowing just that tidbit, the same premise follows for Destiny 2: waking up in a ravaged setting gone to hell and being forced to shoot the way to survival. It should be noted that one does not need to play the first Destiny to play the second, though it is highly recommended for easter eggs (lore). What’s the character controlled by the player like? Following the theme of three, the person behind the controller can also choose one of the three classes while creating their character which will be broken down into RPG terms indicated by parenthesis (because “air quotes” just quite don’t cut it as far as setting the tone goes)...\n\nHUNTER. The Hunters are the rogues in regards to gameplayWhile most certainly the squishiest (most susceptible to dying), they are easily the most mobile of the three classes with both speed and skillsets that focus on swift, acrobatic combat complete with a handy-dandy military knife. Remember the three elements mentioned before? The rogue class is immediately expanded into three respective sub-classes for greater diversity in both PVP (player-versus-player) and PVE (player-versus-environment). The Solar element awakens the Gunslinger subclass in the Hunter where Overwatch fans can compare to their favorite cowboy McCree* as a master of the heavy-duty revolver (it’s High Noon* somewhere), giving three blazing shots that does massive area-of-effect explosive damage upon impact. The Void elements awakens the Nightstalker (badass name), the Legolas* of the Hunter subclasses as it lets the guardian shoot using a purple bow and arrows of pure dark energy. Oh, did that Hunter miss their mark? No, as wherever the bolt lands, it creates an anchor that tethers to nearby enemies to not only slow them, but weaken them significantly and leaving the poor souls open to massive damage. And last but not least, the Arc element heralds the Arcstrider. In the first game, the lightning thief wielded only a tiny knife that electrocutes people on contact and makes them superfast on their feet. The updated subclass in Destiny 2 is not so different, only they now wield a thunder staff and become parkour masters! The Hunter class is the most picked class so far and the best for new players to the Destiny world for their balanced kits. Plus, they wear badass capes.\n\nWARLOCK. The Warlocks are the mages (who could’ve guessed). They command the elements at the tip of their fingers but without the mantra and crazy hand gestures. They are the least mobile of the three classes, but damn it can they fly like no one’s business! This class is focused on self-sustaining, healing, and area-of-effect damage as opposed to the Hunter’s one-on-one combat or the Titan’s one-man barricade mechanics. The Arc subclass grants the Warlock the ability to call upon the storm, guess that’s why the class is called Stormcaller. This allows the guardian to literally float around the area and electrocute nearby enemies to death like a messiah ready to smite some poor souls to the depths of black space. The Void class has the Voidwalker in which the Warlock can (and this is not even exaggerated) Kamehameha* an aimed area that explodes on impact and kill everything around the impact. Just like the Hunter with their Arcstrider class, the Warlock’s Solar subclass receives a slight makeover as well. In the first Destiny, the Warlock commanding the power of fire can self-resurrect themselves upon death to continue the current fight (because Guardians do not quit!), the new game removes this perk and gives the mage a flaming sword thus appropriately calling the class the Dawnblade! Referring back to Lord of the Rings, Gandalf the Grey became Gandalf the White.\n\nTITAN. Literally a walking tank as far as appearance and gameplay goes. They are slightly more versatile when it comes to moving around the map than a Warlock, though does not get anywhere as easily as a Hunter. But don’t let their hulking appearances fool…..seriously, don’t as Titans have the capabilities of carrying their fireteam* to victory in the “glory of battle” as Shax* would say. This class is the heaviest and most-picked for PVP for their bruiser capabilities of not only taking a hit, but packing a punch themselves. Speaking of punches, a Titan’s Arc subclass dishes one out literally in the super move called the Fist of Havoc where they can literally come in from the air and make a Superman* landing or more appropriately a Thor* landing to those that have seen the most recent MCU trailer like a giant thunderbolt of hate. This ability will literally electrocute everything nearby into dust. Another nod to Thor shouts out to the Solar subclass the Sunbreaker, where the Guardian also wields a hammer that’s perfect for not only bashing enemies heads in, but hurling fiery projectiles of inferno badassery. Think that’s cool with all of these Marvel references? Not done yet. The first Destiny grants Titans the ability to call upon the power of Void Light and project a spherical shield that protects everything inside and provide extra health. This is removed in Destiny 2, of sorts. Changing the name Defender to Sentinel, these tanky Guardians are given a purple shield and basically become Captain America*. That’s right, with the throw of their mighty shield, all enemies of darkness will yield! It’s a good thing said enemies don’t really know how to duck.\n\nStill haven’t decided? Don’t want to be locked into one role? Don’t worry. The good thing about the Destiny games is that each account can create up to three characters. Three characters, three classes, go forth and save the world as one of each! Below are videos and a bit of gameplay of how each class plays as well as the significance of the three elements in the environment. Hopefully this quick breakdown rallies more potential players to join the fight against evil invaders, but rest assured that more covering the massive lore and gameplay will be coming soon. Thanks for reading, Guardians and remember to stay… KindaGeeky!\n\nWith the upcoming expansion of the positively acclaimed action, role-playing game, it’s about time Kinda Geeky sheds some insight on, as the title suggests, Horizon: Zero Dawn. It was released in 2017 by Sony Interactive Entertainment and has received the award for “Best Original Game” for three years in a row during its development. Gamer Geek has never played this game up until now (blasphemy!)…It’s true. From what can be told simply from the introduction of the game, it’s going to be epic and beautiful. The graphics are stunning to the eye, the open environment almost too real to the touch – it’s like walking into Skyrim but instead of dragons, the world is run by robot dinosaurs and mechanic Bambis (yes, the small deer). It undoubtedly takes place many centuries after the modern world of today, and it seems that there was some sort of collapse in the Advanced Technological-Industrial Age which led the world to its current state of said visual futuristic and paradisal Stone Age. The result of this collapse allowed both genres of mysticism and sci-fi to blend together to create a new universe that is simply waiting to be explored!\n\nThe game offers a strong, female protagonist by the name of Aloy whom is raised on the outskirts of a region her tribe the Noras call Mother's Embrace, a sort of wild Arcadia where man and machine thrive in peace and harmony. Unlucky for Ms. Aloy, her people labelled her an outcast from birth due to the fact that she was discovered without any presence of a biological mother to claim her as her own. Following the game’s lore, since Noras go crazy over the whole mother theme as decreed by a couple of preaching old lady-priests with impractical hats and robes, called Matriarchs to give a nod to the mother theme, that is where the fantastic racism* kicks in. It appears that those without tattoos, those who commit any sort of “crime” (term used loosely as the people are highly sensitive of what goes on within their jurisdiction), those who wander outside the borders, or in Aloy's case, those who are brought up without a mother are immediately and harshly met with neglectful, stern, and harsh treatment.\n\nBecause she got fed up of the said harsh treatment that she had been dealt with all her life (rightly so) and developed a powerful desire to learn of her true origins (also rightly so), Aloy began to train to hunt both animal and machine for most of her adolescent years to become the able-bodied warrior she is in the game's present time. Much of the credit goes to the tutelage of her adoptive father-figure, Rost. Like all heroes who get thrusted into the call of adventure, she (spoiler alert ahead!) loses her guardian daddy Rost in the midst of even more clashing discrimination between her tribe and a rival tribe who share a complex history of war and slavery. Desperate to avenge her guardian, Aloy leaves the comfort of her home as the newly appointed and respected Seeker, which is basically a government mercenary, allowing her to freely roam the open machine-ravaged world with her trusty spear and bows (she can carry three at once for some reason). It seemed like her people were as equally desperate to get rid of her as to have her despite her singlehandedly saving them against invaders. All jokes aside, the more deeds she carries out, the more respect she deserves, and the more friends she makes.\n\nBack to the feel of the game, it splendidly includes all of the elements that create great RPGs – dialogue choices, crafting, customization, and overall free control over the player character. Its unique combat system allows Aloy to fend off enemies toggling between her bows (remember, there are three) that fire arrows, traps, AND bombs (dang, girl!) However, the most important tool in her arsenal is her spear that can hack into machines and override them to her will (she can make robot slaves). Using these two tools it should be added that Aloy is adept at stealth, crouching silently across the plains in the tall grass that for some reason matches her red hair for effective camouflage as she stalks her prey(s), making her a force to be reckoned with. Like all adventure games, interactive is a must to not only add substance to a good story, but drives it as well. One of the key items in the game that fits the bill is an earpiece that Aloy stumbles upon as a kid known as a Focus which is a piece of technology from the ruined advanced world before her time that allows her to better understand the unknown parts of her current world as well as the machines that roam it (in lame man’s terms, the thing is a tiny x-ray that apparently knows all and sees through all. Everything). This makes the player see the world in more than one perspective that adds more than twice as many possibilities to uncover. With that much to uncover and learn, it would be a very difficult feat to put the controller down.\n\nSince its release, Sony has decided to give fans more to the already massive new Earth for Aloy to explore calling the new expansions “The Frozen Wilds”. It goes without saying on what kind of the place the protagonist will venture into next, but just "
