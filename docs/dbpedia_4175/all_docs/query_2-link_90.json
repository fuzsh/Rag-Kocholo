        "text": "\"Stop! You violated the... I AM ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL!\"\n\nSurely someone out there knows why so many video game-born memes exist. We think it's all Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty's fault. Probably.\n\nThe following games have their own pages:\n\nBemani (Konami's rhythm games)\n\nCastlevania\n\nBlaz Blue\n\nCapcom vs. Whatever\n\nFinal Fantasy\n\nFire Emblem\n\nKatawa Shoujo\n\nLeague of Legends\n\nThe Legend of Zelda\n\nMetal Gear\n\nNasuverse (Fate/stay night and Tsukihime)\n\nPok√©mon\n\nPortal\n\nResident Evil\n\nStreet Fighter\n\nSuper Mario Bros\n\nSuper Smash Bros\n\nTeam Fortress 2\n\nTouhou\n\nUmineko no Naku Koro Ni\n\nWorld of Warcraft\n\nX-COM\n\nAs well as the following studios:\n\nValve Software\n\nBio Ware\n\nZero Wing's Blind Idiot Translation opening is one colossal meme by itself, spawning edits, remixes and variations by the thousands, along with creating a host of lesser memes, though it long ago became a Discredited Meme. Even on this very wiki it is the Trope Namer or redirect for five tropes (War Was Beginning, Somebody Set Up Us the Bomb, All Your Base Are Belong to Us, You Have No Chance to Survive [which also has You Are On the Way To Destruction as a redirect], For Great Justice).\n\nMetal Slug: RAWKIT LAWNCHAIR! HEAVY MASHEEN GUN! SHAWTGUHN! [1]\n\nAltered Beast: WISE FWOM YO GWAVE! [2]\n\nPOWER UP.\n\nNEVER GIVE UP.[3]\n\nWELCOME TO YOUR DOOM! [4]\n\nEpic Mickey: KILL THE MOUSE TAKE HIS HOUSE KILL THE MOUSE TAKE HIS HOUSE [5]\n\nLimbo: BEAR TRAP! [6]\n\nThis whole video of Amnesia the Dark Descent [7]\n\nWhat even is that thing? [8]\n\nOh GOD, I have to go into this next room.[9]\n\nOh shit, I have a bag of Milky Ways! :D\n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!! [10]\n\nThe floor is made of terrible!\n\nGo to (pick any level), NOPE.[11]\n\nEtrian Odyssey:, F.O.E.! [12]\n\nThe popularity of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney in the United States led to a host of spoofs on Newgrounds (entitled Phoenix Wrong), putting the antics of the eponymous attorney and other characters to soundtracks of songs and famous movies, in the style of an Animutation.\n\nDamon Gant, the jovial Chief of Police, who any internet Phoenix fan can tell you, will 'Raep' you.\n\nALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOGANT.\n\nNearly every line in the 'official' English translation of Phoenix Drive, a doujin hentai game based off the Phoenix Wright series. Translated by the developers themselves, the English translation is chock full of Engrish, with some of the most popular lines being \"I will beat a rod till... a tank empties\" and \"Oh snap! I do not hear such a truth!?\"\n\n\"OBJECTION!\" [13]\n\nZak Gramarye is a jerk.[14]\n\nHobo Phoenix. (Or in Japanese, Naruhobo).[15]\n\nAre you a hobosexual?\n\nBlatantly.\n\nThe miracle never happen.[16]\n\nThe comedy skit Boot to the Head done with Phoenix Wright characters, which rebooted interest in the Dr. Demento show.\n\nYou foolish fools have foolishly forgotten to foolishly mention the foolish fool that is Franziska von Karma, who likes to let you know that you are all foolishly FOOLISH FOOLS OF TOMFOOLERY, and you foolish fools should not be foolishly wasting your fool time foolishly reading... you FOOL! [17]\n\nGodot can't see Redd White.\n\nYOUR FATHER DIED LIKE A DOG AND SO WILL YOU [18]\n\nWe'll just have to take care of it tomorrow... IN COURT.\n\nwhy tho\n\nYou're lying, dammit, and I can prove it!\n\nI YELL OBJECTION IN THE COURT SOMETIMES\n\nQuercus Alba is evolving! [19]\n\nGodot is Cyclops. BEHOLD! OPTIC BLAST!! [20]\n\n\"A POOL OF WATER!\" from RC de GO, a very underrated racing game for the Playstation.\n\nReal Time Strategy (more than one game): \"Im in your base killing your d00ds!\" [21]\n\nScribblenauts:\n\nI FUCKING TRAVELLED THROUGH TIME AND JUMPED ON A DINOSAUR AND USED IT TO KILL MOTHERFUCKING ROBOT ZOMBIES. [22]\n\nSteak can be attached to a baby to attract lions.[23]\n\nIS THIS Battletoads??\n\nNO IT'S COMBAT AMPHIBIANS.\n\nYou sure? It looks like Conflict Frogs to me. Passible War Tadpoles. Though it could be Internecine Anurans. You know, the sequel to Pugna Bufonidae? Also, to this day people still call up Gamestop Locations and asking for info on the upcoming Battletoads game. There is no upcoming Battletoads game. Go to youtube, and you'll find videos of manager's reactions over the phone.\n\nYOU SEE THOSE TOADS BUSTING OUT OF THAT WALL LIKE THEY DON'T GIVE A FUCK? IT'S LIKE THEY WERE BATTLING OR SOMETHING! [24]\n\nNo, it's Doom 3.\n\nDantini!\n\nDynasty Warriors - \"YOU FLAMING IDIOTS!!!\" [25]\n\n\"Don't pursue Lu Bu!\" [26]\n\n\"In death, my soul will be my brethren!\" [sic] [27]\n\n\"BENEVOLENCE!\" [28]\n\nGuilty Gear: DAMEDAMEDAMEDAMEDAMEDAMEDAMEDAMEDAMEDAMEDAMEDAME!!!!!\n\nUMEHARA GA KIMETAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!\n\nBridget will make you gay.\n\nHEAVEN OR HELL! DUEL 1! LET'S ROCK!\n\nPretty much every cutscene and line in Hotel Mario and The Legend of Zelda CDI Games.\n\nAll toasters toast toast! [29]\n\n\"Toast doesn't go in a toaster. Bread does.\"\n\n\"Toast\" does not necessarily mean \"put in a toaster\". When you \"bake a cake\", you're not putting a fully cooked cake back in the oven, usually you put in batter and the cake comes out. Toasting is the action that makes toast. Therefore one can \"toast toast\" just as one can knit a scarf or build a house.\n\n\"If you need instructions on how to get through the hotels, check out the enclosed instruction book.\"\n\n\"Gee, it sure is boring around here.\"\n\n\"MAH BOI, THIS PEACE IS WHAT ALL TRUE WARRIORS STRIVE FOR.\"\n\n\"Or else you will DIE!\"\n\n\"You dare bring light to my lair?! YOU MUST DIE!!\" *zap, zap*\n\n\"Did you bring a light?\" / \"NO...\"\n\n\"I wonder what's for dinner?\"\n\nOh, boy! I'm so hungry I could eat an Octorok!\n\n\"I can't wait to bomb some dodongos!\"\n\n\"Nice of the princess to invite us over for a picnic, GAY LUIGI?\n\n\"I HOPE SHE MADE LOTSA SPAGHETTI!\n\nSony's E3 2006 press conference brought forth three instant memes:\n\n\"It's Ridge Racer! RIIIIIDGE RACERRRRR!!!\"\n\nThe Giant Enemy Crab in Genji 2, a game \"based on Japanese history,\" which you flip over so you can Attack Its Weak Point For Massive Damage!\n\nGenji 2 also features \"real time... weapon change.\"\n\nPlayStation 3 will retail for 599 USD. Five hundred and ninety-nine U.S. dollars. FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY-NINE U.S. DOLLARS.\n\nSpeaking of the PS Triple, \"Sup, bitchez! It's Chad Warden here.\"\n\nPlay Station 3 has no games.\n\nIt only does [reference to Sony's latest gaffe].[30]\n\nNintendo of America's Reggie has uttered \"My body is ready.\" It won't resurface until three years later, where it would become a huge fad.\n\nAnd then there's \"What's wrong with you?\"\n\nAt E3 2012, He mentioned it. He was talking about the opportunity for fitness with the Wii-U, and said that \"People laughed, my body was ready\" to a chorus of cheers.\n\nAt E3 2008, a Nintendo employee named Cammie left a pretty bad taste in all the gamers' mouths due to her overenthusiastic personality about casual games. She even told a personal story on how she broke her wrist when she tried to snowboard. Literally, within seconds, her and and the word wrist became memes on several forums.\n\nStar FOX 64 brings us Peppy Hare's various over-eager \"hints\": \"Do a barrel roll!\", \"Use the brake!\", \"Try a somersault!\"\n\nDo a Google Roll!\n\nYou forgot Falco's \"Hey Einstein, I'm on your side!\"\n\nThanks to Super Smash Bros.. Brawl, Wolf O'Donnell's \"Can't let you do that, Star Fox!\" has expanded so that Wolf can't let anybody do anything.\n\n\"Can't let you brew that, Starbucks!\"\n\n\"Can't let you chew that, Starburst!\"\n\n\"Can't let you view that, Firefox!\"\n\nTHIS!!!\n\n\"Fox, get this guy off me!\" Shut up, Slippy.\n\nMostly for furries only, but Krystal can't enjoy her sandwich.\n\n\"This baby can take temperatures up to 9000 degrees!\"\n\nSuper Robot Wars: If it's evil, you can pretty much guarantee that Sanger...Sanger Zonvolt! WILL CLEAVE IT!!!.[31]\n\nRegardless of alignment, Elzam von Branstein (or Ratsel Feinschmecker) and his Trombe can override pretty much anything.[32]\n\nAs You Know, Real Men Ride Each Other.[33]\n\nOr pilot Goth Loli-bots\n\nCHESUTOOOOOOOO!!!! [34]\n\nIbis is Love.[35]\n\nWhat the hell is Mist Rex doing in that new SRW!? [36]\n\nDid they blow the budget on the Nu Gundam? [37]\n\nPerfect World: Asoteric Runewolf is casting a powerful attack! Keep your distance!\n\nAsoteric Runewolf: SUPER... POWERFUL... MIGHTY... WHIRLING... SLASH!\n\nXenogears: Chu-Chu died for your sins.[38]\n\n\"Master, sir, did you just see my MAD SKILLZ?\"\n\nI am! A MAN! OF THE SEA! *boom* [39]\n\nXenosaga: What do you think, Ma belle peche?\n\nAh yes! Feed me your hostility! Pierce me with your hatred!\n\nThe King of Fighters: Mai Shiranui originally shouted \"Nippon Ichi!\" (\"Japan's No. 1!\") when she won a battle. But it's been notoriously misheard by English speakers as \"Me bouncy!\". And yes, she is!\n\nThis troper would like to point out that the Mondegreen doesn't have a sound that sounds like \"ow\"; therefore, he heard it as \"Me boingy!\", which makes more sense if you think about it.\n\nFor more Mondegreen fun, there's Blue Mary's [40]\n\nAnything that Terry Bogard says. Anything. The same goes for Geese.[41]\n\nPREDICTABO! [42]\n\nThe Rugalspin. Thanks, Rugal! Thanks, MUGEN! [43]\n\nKOKO DESU KA? KOKO DESU KA? KOKO DESU KA? KOKO DESU KA? KOKO DESU KA? [44]\n\nFear the Almighty Stance! [45]\n\nGALATICA PHANTOMEH!! A real man's punch.[46]\n\nAku wa yurusan! (OBJECTION!-fingerpoint) HA! [47]\n\nColgate EX Kim! Brush your teeth with JUSTICE! [48]\n\nJUSTICE!! [49]\n\nShion... is a trap! And the poster boy for bulimia.[50]\n\nHm hm hm hm... ha ha ha ha... HAAAH HA HA HA HA HA!!! [51]\n\nNO MAI = NO BUY! [52]\n\nDeJap's Fan Translation for Tales of Phantasia featured, most prominently, adult humor that was never in the game to begin with. The most well-known line comes from this line of dialogue delivered by Klarth as the party is traveling on a boat to the next continent, as Klarth is asking the hero, Cless, which one of the girls he's going for, \"Mint has that quiet elegance about her, but I bet Arche fucks like a tiger.\" Any Phantasia fan will tell you that Klarth is probably right.\n\nWhat about the infamous \"KUUUUUUUURRREEAAAA!!!\" from Tales of Rebirth?\n\n...or the equally infamous \"INDIGNAYSHUN!\" from the Game Boy Advance port of Phantasia.\n\nWHAT THE HECK IS THAT?!\n\nTales of Vesperia: BLAH BLAH BLAH! TIDAL WAVE! [53]\n\n\"Prepare to die, eggbear!\" [54]\n\nTales of Legendia: STELLLLAAAAA!!!!!! [55]\n\nTales of the Abyss: REPPPLIIIIIIICCCCCCCAAAAAAAAA! [56]\n\nDreck.[57]\n\nSonic Thrust [58]\n\nReturn to Daath! [59]\n\nTales of Destiny: NO! ITEMS! EVVVAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! [60]\n\nBURUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA?\n\nTales of Graces: Tomodachi nanda! TOMODACHIIIIIIII! HUAAAAAAAAARGH\n\nMAMORUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU.\n\n\"Let's search for the butt. It's the only way.\" [[labelnote:Explanation:A rather memorable quote by Sophie. The party was eaten by a rock monster and tries to escape. Sophie explains to Cheria that leaving through the butt would be safest.</ref>\n\nTales of Symphonia: \"What is this ominous light that threatens to engulf us?\" [61]\n\nHere, TV Tropes, have some hot coffee.\n\nI lied, it's actually Iced Coffee.\n\nI lied, it's hot. [62]\n\nTales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World: Courage is the magic that turns dreams into reality. Courage is the magic that turns dreams into reality. Courage is the magic that turns dreams into reality... [63]\n\nTales of Destiny: Ore-sama wa Champion da! [64]\n\nStarCraft: Mayday, mayday! Mah trope has taken terrible, terrible damage!\n\n\"You must CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS!\" and \"WE REQUIRE MORE VESPENE GAS!\" [65]\n\nWARNING! Additional pylons under construction!\n\n\"SPAWN MORE OVERLORDS!\"\n\nBite me!\n\n\"Zerg Rush kekeke\" [66]\n\n\"LURK MOAR\"\n\nNuclear Launch Detected.\n\n\"My Life For Pylo!\"\n\n\"FLOSS THE ZERG!!!\"\n\nYou guys are so zetta slow when it comes to adding Sho Minamimoto from The World Ends With You! Used in a similar manner as Slowpoke to mock someone for posting about an old topic.\n\nHe's also used similarly to Ultros to tell some Incredibly Lame Pun, but math related.\n\nJoshua and his Super Jesus Beam. Joshua is a form of the name Jesus, after all.(Yoshua and Yeshua have the same root name.)\n\nCome get some Hot Stuff. [67]\n\nShiki's \"Pants. Off. Now.\" and Beat's \"IM DIGGIN' IT!\" are popular among fans.\n\nTin Pin. SLAM ON!\n\nFor Tin-Pin is a Manly Game.\n\nMust... resist... emo urges! [68]\n\nThere's a party in my mouth!\n\nShut up and walk, dear. <3 [69]\n\nThe plot screen from Bad Dudes: The President has been kidnapped by ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue the president?\n\nOr \"President Ronnie\" depending on which version you're playing (the latter appears in the arcade version; the former in the NES version because of Nintendo's censorship policies).\n\nThe President has been rescued by dudes. Are you a bad enough ninja to kidnap the President?\n\nThe Ninja has been kidnapped by presidents, are you a good enough dude to rescue him?\n\nThe kid has napped by a ninja President has been. You are a bad President. This is not enough dudes.\n\nThe Prime Minister has been kidnapped by ruffians. Are you a righteous enough chap to rescue the Prime Minister?\n\nPac-Man: Waka Waka Waka [70]\n\nWe think Halo is a pretty cool guy. eh kills aleins and doesn't afraid of anything.[71]\n\nVery good, TVTROPES! BUT YOU NEED... MORE... EXAMPLES! [72]\n\nBRB, reinstalling Deus Ex.[73]\n\nWhat a shame.\n\nWhat a rotten way to die.\n\nMy vision is augmented.[75]\n\nMy pimphand is augmented.[76]\n\nThe Recut single-handedly spawned a few memes, including unforgettable phrases like \"I might as well start using coke.\" and \"Old Men are the future.\"\n\n\"The industry, as a whole, has grown up.\"\n\nICARUS HAS FOUND YOU!!! ICARUS HAS FOUND YOU!!! ICARUS HAS FOUND YOU!!!\n\nI never asked for this. [77]\n\nI'll never stop looking.[78]\n\nAAADAAAAM, I TOLD YOU TO STOP READING THIS IN MY VOICE!\n\nYume Nikki: UBOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [79]\n\nShout \"Ubwaa!!\" in any populated area of Phantasy Star Universe. Watch what happens. You all have Kireek to thank for that, by the way.\n\nA simple complaint about a bad pick-up group experience on the City of Heroes message board turned \"Go. Hunt. Kill Skuls\" into the game's official meme. The boards went wild when then-head developer Statesman used it on the message boards. Then it morphed into a badge earned by defeating 200 members of the Skulls gang. It was incorporated into the official site's backstory for the gang. Finally, after loading screen messages were added to the game, a random message of \"Go. Hunt. Kill Skuls\" will occasionally appear.\n\nNaturally, it's all a Nemesis plot.\n\nIt is NOT all a Nemesis plot.\n\nFREEEEEEEEM!\n\nFutanari Catgirl looking for ERP in Pocket D on Virtue.\n\nthis is how it start's jerk hacking (dupin)\n\nWhy does \"FPS Doug\" like shooters so much? Two words: \"BOOM! HEADSHOT!\"\n\nLimbo of the Lost developed a photoshop following from other gamers who, amused by its brazenness in overusing literal Copy and Paste Environments, started coming up with ways to paste the hero in other games.\n\nAlso the Narmworthy \"King of Limboooo!\"\n\nAn originally low-key meme from Gauntlet (1985 video game) that slowly crept back into consciousness with the rise in popularity of the Internet: \"Wizard Needs Food Badly!\"\n\nThe Tails Doll from Sonic R is a Demonic Dummy that will eat your soul. Can you feel the sunshine?\n\nShadow the Hedgehog: \"FIND THE COMPUTER ROOM!\" [80]\n\nShadow the Hedgehog: \"Where's that DAMN fourth Chaos Emerald?\" [81]\n\nI told Knuckles that Eggman was good, Sonic was evil, and The Other Wiki was as authoritative as a peer-reviewed scientific journal. He believed all of it.[82]\n\nShadow the Hedgehog: \"You know what they say, the more the merrier!\" [83]\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 2006: \"Yes, but that alone...\" (dramatic finger point) \"... is insufficient.\" [84]\n\nHOW 'BOUT THIS? IT'S NO USE! TAKE THIS! [85]\n\nSonic Heroes: LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE EGGMAN'S ROBOTS![86]\n\nSonic Adventure: \"Get a load of this!\"[87]\n\nShadow the Hedgehog: \"THIS is who I am!\"\n\n\"CHECK OUT THE CONSLES! WOOOAAAAHH!\"[88]\n\nSonic Generations: THAT LOOKS LIKE A HOMING SHOT! [89]\n\nRooftree! [90]\n\nX? Is that really you, or are you just an impostor? I must find out by THROWING Y AT YOU![91]\n\nSonic Spinball: WORM BAGGED.[92]\n\nCLUCK ALERT![93]\n\nSonic the Hedgehog: Mr. Needlemouse [94]\n\nDumb Running Sonic. [95]\n\nHUEHEUHUEHEUHUEHUE [96]\n\nSonic4: The music is dying cats [97]\n\nPikachu in a sombrero\n\nKingdom Hearts: There are at least half a dozen videos on youtube for Axel's little catchphrase.\n\n\"GOT IT MEMORIZED\" [98]\n\nBEHOLD! BEHOLD! BEHOLD! BEHOLD! [99]\n\n\"AS IF!\" [100]\n\n\"That was undeniable proof that we TOTALLY owned you lamers!\" [101]\n\nVen's goldfish.[102]\n\nTerra's pants.[103]\n\nAqua's boobs.[104]\n\nVanitas's creepy-ass laugh.[105]\n\nDARKNESS!!! [106]\n\nI'll have a CHICKEN MCDARKNESS!!!!! [107]\n\nSora, Donald, Goofy! [108]\n\nGET UP ON THE HYDRA'S BACK!!! [109]\n\nThe Meme That Never Was [110]\n\nRAGE AWAKENED. [111]\n\n\"Roxas, that's a stick.\" [112]\n\nThere are many videos on Youtube called \"Roxas hates (X music)\". They use the clip when Roxas smashes the lab's computer.\n\nSilent Hill: Pyramid Head is going to rape you. But it's not rape if you let him. And you know you will. [113]\n\nGOOD HEAVENS, JUST LOOK AT THE TIME.[114]\n\nHave you seen a little girl? [115]\n\nMy name is Harry Mason. I'm in town, on vacation.\n\nProbably a doghouse, though I'm not sure since there's no dog around.[116]\n\nThere was a HOLE here. It's gone now. [117]\n\nSHIT GETS RUSTY, ALL THE DOORS ARE LOCKED.[118]\n\nSilent Hill: Shattered Memories: It's a boat. It's like a car, but runs on water.\n\nMy mother was a bitch.\n\nCheryl? Cheryl? Cheryl! CHERYYYYYL!! Sweetie?\n\nI love my daddy. I love my daddy. I love my daddy. I LOVE MY DADDY. I LOVE MY DADDY.\n\nStar Control 2: \"Hold! What you are doing is wrong! Why do you do this thing?\" [119]\n\nThe *fat words* Orz *spits* are most *squishy* and make *campers* *enjoy the sauce*! [120]\n\nCaptain, I don't think you meant to ask about my powers. -<DIDN'T YOU MEAN TO ASK ABOUT FLOWERS?>- [121]\n\nThe Eroge Nursery Rhyme (which hasn't been animated) is best known for its opening theme, \"True My Heart\", and certainly not for any originality‚Äîin fact, it's because the song is a generic eroge opening theme. This made it the perfect song for Fan Vids depicting random Anime that might have an Fundamentally Female Cast or a large portion of schoolgirls as Harem Series and removing their plots. The meme is commonly called \"Kishimen\", a Mondegreen of a line in the song that's actually \"KISS de\". This one from Code Geass may have started it off.\n\nThe Cheetahmen, the protagonists of one of the games featured in the compilation Action 52, have quite the Ear Worm of a theme song. Oddly, despite the fact that Action 52 was an American production, this has become a bigger meme in Japan.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls has spawned several.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion:\n\nSTOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM! NO-ONE BREAKS THE LAW ON MY WATCH!\n\nBY THE NINE DIVINES! THERE'S BEEN A MURDER! (Often said directly after you kill someone and take about two steps away from the corpse.)\n\nSimilarly: \"The body is still warm.\" (another line guards say upon finding a dead body, which they will often say just after they kill someone themself.)\n\nBY AZURA! BY AZURA! BY AZURA!! IT'S THE GRAND CHAMPION!\n\nAlso killing the Adoring Fan in unusal ways.\n\nI heard the Fighters' Guild is recruiting again.\n\nI saw a mud crab the other day.\n\nLoathsome things, I hate them.\n\nDid you steer well clear of it?\n\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim:\n\n\"...then, I took an arrow in the knee.\" [122]\n\nPeople are getting tired of it.\n\nFUS RO DAH! [123]\n\nKA.....ME.....HA....ME......HA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [124]\n\nLet me guess, someone stole your sweetroll?
