Rather than just physical attacking your way through random encounters that are designed to chip away at your HP/MP over a long period of time, XIII replenishes your HP/MP after every battle and instead chooses to make every random battle something you have to pay at least a little bit of attention to. There are very few battles where you don't paradigm shift at all, and if you get lazy you wont get you 5 star rating which gives you additional rewards after battles.\n\nThe paradigm shifts gives the player a fast paced battle where you have to stay on your toes, it's true that you aren't directly in control of every single action that your character takes, but the excellent A.I. does what you want almost every time, i mean if your character is low on HP and you paradigm shift to a medic, its going to heal that character 999/1000 times, how is that any different from manually going into the magic list, selecting cure, and casting it on the character? That's just a slower way of doing it.\n\nThe stagger gauge is also an excellent layer of depth, you can choose to focus on ravagers to fill it up and stagger the enmy as quickly as possible, or you can just get the stagger bar up high (which lowers its defense) and keep it there rather than staggering and making the bar reset again, it gives the player something else to think about.\n\nThe game also gives players a good variety of choices with its gear, you can turn lightning into a ravager that can raise the stagger bar quickly, or you can bulk up her HP or strength and make her a better commando/medic/sentinal. Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses and exclusive spells/abilities.\n\nIronically enough, the biggest complaint of the game is it's ultra linear level design, but as i replayed the game this generation, i actually found the pacing refreshing. After every game going open world, it's nice to be able to just get from point A to point B with 5-10 minutes of travel.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the game is extremely polished, i've put 150+ hours into the game, got the platinum trophy, and i can't even think of a bug that i ran into.\n\nAside from the obvious production values that are among the best of its generation, look at how damn good the art style is\n\nNow imagine those production values and art direction, and add one of the best OSTs of the entire series\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39Cg92jbc88\n\nAnd last but certainly not least, my favorite combat system of the series.\n\nXIII makes the obvious (but correct) decision to ditch random encounters in favor of on field monsters, this has several benefits\n\n-You can pick and choose which fights you want\n\n-Attacking a monster from behind gives you an advantage in battle\n\n-You can avoid battles entirely\n\nThe core combat systems take the traditional menu based ATB formula that the series had become known for and mixed it up in a way that made it fresh and even more satisfying.

I should replay it sometime and play the other two since I bought 13-2 but never put that many hours in to it.\n\nAside from the obvious production values that are among the best of its generation, look at how damn good the art style is\n\nNow imagine those production values and art direction, and add one of the best OSTs of the entire series\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39Cg92jbc88\n\nAnd last but certainly not least, my favorite combat system of the series.\n\nXIII makes the obvious (but correct) decision to ditch random encounters in favor of on field monsters, this has several benefits\n\n-You can pick and choose which fights you want\n\n-Attacking a monster from behind gives you an advantage in battle\n\n-You can avoid battles entirely\n\nThe core combat systems take the traditional menu based ATB formula that the series had become known for and mixed it up in a way that made it fresh and even more satisfying. Rather than just physical attacking your way through random encounters that are designed to chip away at your HP/MP over a long period of time, XIII replenishes your HP/MP after every battle and instead chooses to make every random battle something you have to pay at least a little bit of attention to. There are very few battles where you don't paradigm shift at all, and if you get lazy you wont get you 5 star rating which gives you additional rewards after battles.\n\nThe paradigm shifts gives the player a fast paced battle where you have to stay on your toes, it's true that you aren't directly in control of every single action that your character takes, but the excellent A.I. does what you want almost every time, i mean if your character is low on HP and you paradigm shift to a medic, its going to heal that character 999/1000 times, how is that any different from manually going into the magic list, selecting cure, and casting it on the character? That's just a slower way of doing it.\n\nThe stagger gauge is also an excellent layer of depth, you can choose to focus on ravagers to fill it up and stagger the enmy as quickly as possible, or you can just get the stagger bar up high (which lowers its defense) and keep it there rather than staggering and making the bar reset again, it gives the player something else to think about.\n\nThe game also gives players a good variety of choices with its gear, you can turn lightning into a ravager that can raise the stagger bar quickly, or you can bulk up her HP or strength and make her a better commando/medic/sentinal. Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses and exclusive spells/abilities.\n\nIronically enough, the biggest complaint of the game is it's ultra linear level design, but as i replayed the game this generation, i actually found the pacing refreshing. After every game going open world, it's nice to be able to just get from point A to point B with 5-10 minutes of travel.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the game is extremely polished, i've put 150+ hours into the game, got the platinum trophy, and i can't even think of a bug that i ran into.\n\n100% with you! My favorite FF game besides 14.\n\nAside from the obvious production values that are among the best of its generation, look at how damn good the art style is\n\nNow imagine those production values and art direction, and add one of the best OSTs of the entire series\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39Cg92jbc88\n\nAnd last but certainly not least, my favorite combat system of the series.\n\nXIII makes the obvious (but correct) decision to ditch random encounters in favor of on field monsters, this has several benefits\n\n-You can pick and choose which fights you want\n\n-Attacking a monster from behind gives you an advantage in battle\n\n-You can avoid battles entirely\n\nThe core combat systems take the traditional menu based ATB formula that the series had become known for and mixed it up in a way that made it fresh and even more satisfying.
