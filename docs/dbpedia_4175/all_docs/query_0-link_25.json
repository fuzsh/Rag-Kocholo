        "text": "Devil May Cry 5 is a 3D hack & slash action game. It is the fifth main installment and overall sixth installment in Capcom's Devil May Cry series. The game was formally announced at E3 2018 during Microsoft's press conference.[1]\n\nThe game, set years after the events of Devil May Cry 4,[2][3] follows Nero, Dante and newcomer V as they fight off a widespread demon invasion led by the mysterious demon Urizen.\n\nDevil May Cry 5 was released worldwide in March 8, 2019[4][5] for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The game received positive reviews from critics; many lauded it as a return to form for the franchise, praising the variety of techniques the three characters bring while also liking the handling of the narrative. The game won multiple game awards in both 2019 and 2020, sold over two million copies less than two weeks after its release, surpassed three million in a year and five million by April 2022, becoming the top-selling game in the franchise. Hideaki Itsuno served as the director, Matthew Walker as the producer and character designs were done by Tatsuya Yoshikawa and Daigo Ikeno.\n\nGameplay[]\n\nThe game features three playable characters;[3] Nero, Dante and newcomer V.[6][7] Like previous Devil May Cry titles, the gameplay focus on fast-paced \"stylish action\"; the player fights off hoards of demons with a variety of attacks and weapons and receives a style-rating in combat based on a number of factors, such as move variety, the length of a combo and dodging attacks. The music in the game will change based on the player's performance in combat.[8][9] According to Itsuno, the game can take roughly fifteen to sixteen hours to complete,[10] though it should be noted that he did not specify whether the estimated playtime accounts for potential side content and the like.\n\nPlaystyle[]\n\nNero is equipped with his Red Queen sword and his Blue Rose double-barreled revolver. To replace his stolen \"Devil Bringer\" arm, Nero wields a cybernetic prosthetic arm for the \"Devil Breaker\",[11] which features many of the same moves as its predecessor but also several additional abilities such as grabbing enemies from a distance or stopping time to freeze an enemy in place.\n\nAlongside his signature blade Rebellion and his guns, Dante now fights using several new weapons such as two new Devil Arms; a pair of chainsaw-like weapons that can combine into a motorcycle, named 'Cavalier', and a weapon made of Hellfire called 'Balrog' which forms gauntles and greaves. The latter weapon has two modes, one focusing on kicks, and the other focusing on hard punches. Dante will be keeping his Style Switch mechanic[12] and additionally, players are able to choose what weapons they wish to bring into a mission similar to Devil May Cry 3, or they can simply bring them all at once.[13] He also has acquired a version of Lady's Kalina Ann made by Nico that allows him to use all the moves Lady could with her own rocket launcher.\n\nV fights using his cane and book.[14] He is noticeably slower in walking speed but is also capable of using three demons based on enemies from the first game to fight which includes Griffon, an eagle that uses ranged lightning based attacks, Shadow, a panther that forms blades, spikes and portals out of its body, and Nightmare, a large golem which V enters a Devil Trigger-like state, which turns his hair white,[15] to summon, which uses a combination of melee attacks and laser beams. Once the enemy turns light purple, V uses his cane to finish the battle.\n\nModes and options[]\n\nThe game features the return of the Bloody Palace mode.[15][16] Also included are a Photo Mode and a Gallery Mode with detailed information on, among other details, the different types of Devil Breaker arms. The game also features \"The Void\", a type of Training Mode, similar to the one present in DmC: Devil May Cry.\n\nIt also features a voice setting on switching between English and Japanese like in Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition.[12] One of the new features on the single player gameplay is the \"Cameo System\"; while connected to the Internet, players will make guest cameo appearances in each other’s games in real time, or through ghost data gameplay recordings. Depending on the mission, a player can see another player in the background, but in other cases, they will be fighting together against enemies.[15] As the player conclude each mission with a cameo appearance, he or she is given the option to rate the other player's performance in combat and vice-versa, which if good enough can provide useful rewards.[15] Some missions, however, are strictly single player, especially as characters split up to explore different areas, so if the story doesn’t have any characters crossing paths, the gameplay experience will reflect that. If the player only play \"offline\" they will see ghost data gameplay recordings of the development team instead of other players'.[15]\n\nWithin the game, players can encounter Divinity Statues, which act as an in-game shop. Orbs can be traded in and players can spend real-world money to purchase orbs.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nPlayable[]\n\nNero\n\nDante\n\nV\n\nVergil (Special Edition on PS5 and Xbox Series, and DLC on PS4, Xbox One and PC)\n\nNon-playable/support characters[]\n\nNico\n\nTrish\n\nLady\n\nEnemies[]\n\nHell Caina\n\nHell Judecca\n\nProto Angelo\n\nScudo Angelo\n\nBosses[]\n\nGoliath\n\nCavaliere Angelo\n\nUrizen\n\nVergil\n\nDante\n\nOthers[]\n\nJ.D. Morrison\n\nKyrie (heard in-game)\n\nEva\n\nPatty Lowell (heard in-game)\n\nStory[]\n\nFive years after the events of Devil May Cry 4, Nero has set up his own demon hunting agency based out of a van adorned with a neon \"Devil May Cry\" sign Dante gave him[3] with support from his girlfriend, Kyrie and his engineer, Nico. One day, Nero encounters a cloaked dying individual who rips off his Devil Bringer arm and uses the sword Yamato to open a portal to escape in.\n\nA few days later, a man known as \"V\" comes to the Devil May Cry office to hire Dante, Lady, and Trish to kill a certain returning demon. The group arrive in Red Grave City some days later, crossing paths with Nero as they share the same target: a demon named Urizen who has planted a demonic tree called Qliphoth in the city, which is killing people for their blood.\n\nThe assembled group attempt to attack Urizen together, but the demon overpowers them all; Dante is ultimately defeated and ejected from the Qliphoth with his sword Rebellion shattered, Lady and Trish are captured and turned into cores for the demons Artemis and Cavaliere Angelo respectively, and V and Nero escape to safety.\n\nA month later, Nero returns to Red Grave after being outfitted with the \"Devil Breaker\" prosthetic arm Nico made for him.[11][1] Nero meets up with V after besting the demon Goliath, who is seeking Qliphoth for its fruit - born of condensed human blood - which makes whomever consumes it the king of the Underworld.\n\nAs the pair destroy the Qliphoth's roots while searching for Dante, Nero defeats Artemis to rescue Lady while V slays the demon-parasite Nidhogg, later aiding Nero against the root construct Gilgamesh. V rejoins Nero after learning another demon, Malphas, is also after the Qliphoth's fruit while seeking the Devil Sword Sparda in fear of its namesake's descendants acquiring it. V splits off to find the Sparda first and discovers it along with a hibernating Dante, whose presence was being hidden by the sword. V awakens Dante by threatening to stab him with the Sparda.\n\nAfter learning what occurred during his month-long coma, Dante fights his way to Urizen and frees Trish from Cavaliere Angelo along the way. V then reveals to Trish that Urizen is actually the demon-side of Dante's twin brother Vergil; after being freed from Mundus' control, Vergil used Yamato's power to separate his demon and human halves - the latter of which manifested as V himself, whose body is reaching its limit.\n\nDante, having heard the full story when first meeting V, deduces Rebellion's power is the opposite - the ability to unify something - as he travels to the remnant of his childhood home. Realizing why his father gave him Rebellion, Dante stabs himself with the broken sword's hilt to absorb the Sparda into himself, acquiring his Sin Devil Trigger form along with his own Devil Sword Dante.\n\nNero attempts to confront Urizen again but is overpowered once more, and Dante arrives just in time to save him. Dante gains the upper hand with his new powers, but Urizen takes his leave once the Qliphoth begins to bear fruit. While Dante is conflicted on having Nero join them, an ailing V insists on it and the three split up to find their own way to Urizen. Dante arrives first and defeats King Cerberus before facing Urizen, having now eaten Qliphoth's fruit. Meanwhile, after saving V from Malphas, Nero learns of Dante's history with Vergil. He and V reach Dante just as he defeats Urizen, but a dying V intervenes and merges with Urizen before Dante can finish him, reviving Vergil once more.\n\nDante attacks the newly-revived Vergil, who overpowers him quickly before opening a portal to the top of the Qliphoth tree, telling Dante to recover to his full strength before they battle again. Nero, recognizing Vergil as the one who took his arm, insists on going after Vergil himself, seeking answers and revenge. Dante, having known that he was the young demon hunter's uncle since they first met on Fortuna, finally reveals to Nero that he is Vergil's son and sends him away to keep his hands clean from killing his own father. Nero, Nico, Lady, and Trish escape the slowly-expanding Qliphoth but, despite the group urging him not to confront his father, an angry and confused Nero goes back to chase after Vergil.\n\nDante fights his way through V's now-independent familiars - revealed to be embodiments of Vergil's memories from his time as Nelo Angelo - and they elect to die by Dante's hand as a way of lessening Vergil's trauma.\n\nDante soon reaches Vergil and the sons of Sparda engage in yet another duel with each other, where Dante tells Vergil that Nero is his son. Following a call with Kyrie, Nero expresses his conflicted emotions at having found his family and not having the strength to save Kyrie's brother Credo years ago. Kyrie convinces Nero to stick to his instincts, and the young demon hunter resolves to save both his father and uncle from killing each other, not only finally regaining his Devil Bringer powers but also regenerating his right arm which is now in human form.\n\nNero arrives just in time to stop Dante and Vergil as their fight reaches its climax, fully awakening his Devil Trigger. Vergil mocks his son's resolve of a peaceful solution as he decides to fight him instead, but finds himself pushed back until he begrudgingly concedes. Giving Nero V's book to remember him by, Vergil joins Dante in a one-way trip to the Underworld to cut the Qliphoth down and seal the portal before it rips Red Grave City apart.\n\nAs the Qliphoth falls, Nero leaves Red Grave City alongside Nico while taking out any straggling demons along the way. Weeks later, Trish and Lady are hired for a new job by Morrison, who Dante left in charge of his office before the events at Red Grave City. In the Underworld, Dante and Vergil duel each other on more friendly terms while at the same time dealing with the constant interference from demons out to kill them. The game ends as Dante and Vergil fight against a demon horde with Dante saying his catchphrase \"Jackpot!\", much to Vergil's annoyance.\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nDevil May Cry 5 was developed by \"Capcom Dev Studio 1\" and consists of many staff members who worked on entries in the series as well as Dragon's Dogma.[17] Hideaki Itsuno, who has been a veteran on the Devil May Cry development team since the second installment, serves as the director,[18] Matthew Walker and Michiteru Okabe are two of the producers.\n\nOn October 2013, Itsuno expressed interest in continuing the original series by developing a fifth installment.[19] It was originally thought, due to a statement by Itsuno, that the series could go on hiatus or end for good if Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition was not a commercial success.[20] However, Itsuno confirmed in an later interview that the series' future did not rest on Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition's sales and he also alleviated fears that DmC: Devil May Cry's sales killed the series, confirming that Capcom was satisfied with them.[21] Devil May Cry 5 entered development presumably in year 2014,[22] one year before Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition had been released. Hideaki Itsuno had been working on the game since after DMC4:SE was finished, and the full development team was formed in 2015.[23] In mid-January 2016, Itsuno stated on Twitter that he’s begun work on a new project which couldn't be announced just yet[24] and later in March, Reuben Langdon and Johnny Yong Bosch (who does voice acting and motion capture for Dante and Nero respectively) took pictures of themselves in motion capture gear,[25] leading to speculation that a new Devil May Cry game was in development.[26] When asked by a fan on Twitter regarding any truth about the speculation, Capcom Vancouver gave a vague respone, stating that \"It's not a game that [they] announced that [they are] working on at [their] studio\".[27] On May 17th 2018, the domain name \"DevilMayCry5.com\" was registered by an unknown entity under Capcom's Onamae domain registrar.[28]\n\nDevil May Cry 5 was officialy confirmed on June 10th, 2018, via Microsoft's E3 2018 press conference. The game was originally planned to be announced in 2017. However, ideas to announce it alongside the Resident Evil 2 remake led to to its change.[17] Capcom confirmed a release date of March 2019[29] and a demo was playable in August 2018 at Gamescom.[30] It was later made available on PlayStation Store and Xbox Live. The team was aiming to make Devil May Cry 5 the best action game from the Heisei period.[9] A secret message was left in the first trailer for fans of the series.[17] In July 5, 2018, a issue of Famitsu magazine that covered the development of Devil May Cry 5 stated that the game was 75% finished.[31]\n\nEngine and objectives[]\n\nDevil May Cry 5 was created by a studio from Osaka, Japan[32] and it runs on Capcom's RE Engine, first developed for Resident Evil 7.[3] Most of the team had originally worked on Resident Evil 7 and were experienced with the engine. Itsuno was also influenced by his work in Monster Hunter World to provide content that would appeal new gamers. However, because of the need to have a good balance in the gameplay, Itsuno felt making it challenging would also appeal to long-time fans.[33] Other members of the staff previously worked in the reboot game DmC: Devil May Cry, but the Osaka team was more willing to make a sequel to the fourth installment of the main series. The team listened to the fans' opinions of previous games to ensure the game appealed to them. An example is giving the players an \"auto\" mode that provides easier ways to produce combos.[32]\n\nAccording to Itsuno, the original Devil May Cry 4 was unsuitable for consoles of its generation which resulted in certain issues with its design. As a result, he aimed to make this sequel far more enjoyable with a budget that would allow more content and thus appeal to a larger audience, including Devil May Cry 4 players. However, because the game's narrative was focused on Dante, Nero and V, Lady and Trish could not appear as playable characters again.[34] The game difficulty of \"Sons of Sparda\" was retouched from a previous game to provide players with new challenges like the way characters have to parry enemy attacks and then be able to defeat them in one counterattack while also enhancing the boss fights such as Goliath's fight scene.[35] Another of Itsuno's objectives was making more responsive controls to generate better productions while making the characters move like humans.[36] A big influence on Itsuno and the game was a movie where three robots combined into one giant bot and overcame their foe, moving him to tears. He wanted to create similar moments.[37] Itsuno also wanted to give players the style of a Hollywood movie, most notably Marvel's Avengers series.[38]\n\nDante and Nero's respective actors, Reuben Langdon and Johnny Yong Bosch, have expressed pleasure with the game.[39][40] It features an online multiplayer for up to three players.[41] In April 2019, Matt Walker claimed Vergil would not be a playable character in the game, leaving \"a bitter taste\" in fans mouths.[42] However, after a large amount of requests, Vergil would later be playable in the game's \"Special Edition\" version.\n\nScenario and cast[]\n\nThe story main's theme is \"love\" which is something Capcom aimed to introduce into Devil May Cry since the first installment.[38] Itsuno explained the development team aimed for a \"photo-realistic\" graphics style.[11][13] The game targets 60 frames per second on each release platform.[43][44] While the game is primarily a single player experience, Itsuno and the team wanted to tell an epic story with three distinct perspectives and play-styles, where the main protagonists run into each other and collaborate from time to time, which led to the creation of the \"Cameo System\". The team also ensures the experience would always be as smooth as possible with no downtime.[15] The developers scanned various models to give the characters a realistic look, and actual clothes were created in London and scanned in Serbia.[45] Using the \"RE engine\", the Capcom staff aimed for a more realistic story than previous games in the franchise rather than making it look like low-budget plot. The game's main location, the fictional Red Grave City, was modeled after London.[13] The team made multiple research trips to generate better stages. Locations include Midhurst in West Sussex, Rochester, Kent, Canterbury and Leeds Castle in Kent.[46]\n\nNero's gameplay is designed to emphasize his anger over the way Dante treats him in the beginning. The game's climactic event, where Nero awakens his demonic powers and stops the struggle between Dante and Vergil, is meant to give the story a deeper form. The idea behind making Nero's new powers available near the game's ending is not only to give the title replay value, but to emphasize the power Nero needs to use to face Vergil. This contrasts with the beginning of the game when he can not defeat his alter-ego Urizen.[47] His redesign for Devil May Cry 5 is intended to contrast with Dante's older look.[48] Capcom used an older incarnation of Nero, so he would be \"at the top of his game in body and mind\".[49] Because the game's graphics are meant to be as realistic as possible, each character is modeled after an actor.[50] The staff wanted to generate a major emotional scene when Vergil reappears in the climax confronting his brother. As a result, Nero stops the brothers' feud and awakens his demonic powers to face his father.[51]\n\nAccording to the company, Dante \"hasn't gone wild for no reason\".[52] In terms of his moves, Itsuno said he would be more like his Devil May Cry 3 persona. Nevertheless, he stated Dante has a more mature personality and still wishes to protect humanity and honor the legacy of his father, Sparda.[53] The new antagonist, Urizen, was meant to remind players of the original Demon King Mundus from the first Devil May Cry game.[54]\n\nNewcomer V was created to be the exact opposite of Nero and Dante. He does not wield weapons, giving him a sense of mystery.[55] Itsuno was pleased he was well-received as a character by fans, despite his traits which he felt would make him divisive.[56] Nico was created to be a contrasting heroine to Nero's girlfriend, Kyrie; Nico is more used to fighting. In developing Nero's Devil Breaker abilities, Itsuno pointed out that Punch Line, which involves Nero shooting his mechanical arm, was made to attract teenagers.[57]\n\nMusic[]\n\nKota Suzuki, Yoshiya Terayama, Hiromitsu Maeba, Steven McNair, John R. Graham, Casey Edwards, Cody Matthew Johnson and Jeff Rona composed the game's soundtrack.[58] Johnson and Rona had worked together on multiple projects before Devil May Cry 5 including the fighting game Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite where both worked on a remix of Dante's theme \"Devils Never Cry\". The success of their work led to the duo to being chosen to work on Devil May Cry 5. While not a composer, Johnson played the games so knew the series. Edwards was a fan of the series since the original 2001 game. He took a liking to Nero's theme from Devil May Cry 4 which attracted him mostly because of the lyric \"I'll endure the exile\". According to Johnson, the general idea for the music was \"grittier, heavier, and more experimental\". The fact the game uses three characters allowed them to use different types of music.[59] Sony Japan released the game's original soundtrack in Japan on 12 April 2019. on five disks.[60]\n\nNero's battle themes are \"Devil Trigger\" and its final boss remix \"Silver Bullet\", both performed by Ali Edwards. \"Devil Trigger\" was released on 11 June 2018, as a soundtrack single to promote the game.[58] Edwards was given multiple images of Nero facing his enemies to give him an idea of how his theme song should sound. Edwards met Bosch who gave him have a better understanding of the character. This included his young and reckless traits despite being older when he is introduced.[59] The massive positive response to \"Devil Trigger\" surprised Edwards. On Spotify the song has 7.2 million streams. At one point on YouTube, it had over 30 million views.[61] \"Devil Trigger\" was also the first song revealed to the audience because older members of the staff enjoyed the composers' work on that track.[59]\n\nIn September 2018, Dante's battle theme \"Subhuman\", composed by Johnson and performed by Suicide Silence, was released. Originally sung by the band's lead vocalist Eddie Hermida. Following sexual misconduct allegations against him he was replaced by former Volumes' vocalist Michael Barr.[62] The idea for this theme was to explore the dark and goofy sides of Dante's personality through the instruments being played. The staff was careful the song accurately reflected the character.[59]\n\nIn December 2018, V's original battle theme \"Crimson Cloud\", composed by Rona was released. Because V's real identity was not revealed until later in the story, the composers avoided giving him themes related to his origins.[59] The final trailer presented the game's ending theme \"Legacy\", composed by Kota Suzuki and sung by Ali Edwards. Edwards worked as both vocalist and lyricist. A theme of this song is \"family\" as well as the idea of people supporting each other.[59] The Japanese version of the game includes the song \"Mad Qualia\" by Hyde.[63]\n\nVergil's battle theme, named \"Bury the Light\", was composed by Casey Edwards and performed by Victor Borba. The song was meant to be a reflection of \"Devil Trigger\", just as Nero is a reflection of Vergil. As Nero \"chose to embrace the darkness\" and embrace the demon inside of him\", Vergil has \"always tried to bury the human side of himself, as he sees it as a great source of personal pain and memory of weakness\".[64]\n\nMicrotransactions controversy[]\n\nSome concern arose in the gaming community regarding the decision to include optional in-game purchases where the player can purchase red orbs used to upgrade their character. Capcom confirmed this in no way alters the game's designed progression system, and it is similar to that of Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition, which also allowed for similar in-game purchases.[65][66][67]\n\nPost-launch DLC[]\n\nThe game features the return of the \"Bloody Palace\" mode, where players fight multiple enemies at the same time. It was released for free as downloadable content. Despite Itsuno's earlier statement on possible post-launch DLC, Walker denied there were any such plans aside from the Bloody Palace mode.[54][68][69] However, dataminers found possibly hints on Vergil appearing as a playable character in the future.[70] He later became playable in the Special Edition version and as paid DLC in the current consoles.\n\nCensorship changes[]\n\nAt launch, the PlayStation 4 version of the game released in western countries included the use of a lens flare which reduced the visibility of a brief moment of nudity. Several gaming journalists referred to it as an act of censorship and reported that the change, speculated to be related to Sony's recent censorship policies, came about as part of a patch for the game. IGN also noted that similar censorship were across all western versions regardless of platform.[71][72] In April 2019, it was reported that the censorship had been removed in the game's North America release, yet remained censored in Europe.[73]\n\nSpecial Edition[]\n\nDuring the PlayStation 5 Showcase event on September 16, 2020, the Special Edition of the game was announced. The new version features Vergil as a playable character, Turbo Mode and the Legendary Dark Knight difficulty, all of the DLC contents within the Devil May Cry Deluxe Upgrade as well as all EX costumes.[74] The Special Edition was released on November 10, 2020 for the Xbox Series X/S and November 12, 2020 for the PlayStation 5. The international physical edition will be available at 1st December 2020 while the PlayStation 5 one in Japan will appear in 12 November.\n\nThe game has also been upgraded in terms of performance, players have the choice to turn on ray tracing (though the Xbox Series S version does not support it) and prioritize resolution (targeting 4K @ 30fps), or frame rate (targeting 1080p @ 60fps). A \"High Framerate Mode\" is also present which allows the game to run at up to 120fps.[75] The game cost $39.99 in US dollars.\n\nVergil became available to PS4, Xbox One and PC players as paid DLC in December 15th.[76][77]\n\nMerchandise[]\n\nPlayers who purchased the \"Deluxe Edition\" of the game had access to several pieces of additional content. These included the Cavaliere R weapon for Dante, new cutscenes and announcer options, battle music from the first four Devil May Cry titles, and four Devil Breaker weapons for Nero, including a Mega Buster based on Mega Man 11.[78] They were available as Downloadable content (DLC) within weeks of the game's release. In Japan, there were limited releases of the game that included a jacket based on Dante's and Nero's. A \"Classic Work Shirt\" bundle was also released.[79]\n\nPlayers who pre-ordered Devil May Cry 5, regardless of version, would get alternate \"EX\" colors for Nero, Dante, Trish, Lady and Nico.[7]\n\nIn October 22, 2018, the e-Capcom site was updated with a new edition of Devil May Cry 5 called the \"Ultra Limited Edition\", three versions are available, one that comes with a replica of Nero's coat, one with V's coat and the last with Dante's coat.\n\nA novel titled Devil May Cry 5: Before the Nightmare was released on March 1st, 2019. Written by Bingo Morihashi and illustrated by Tsuyomaru, it is a prequel novel set before the events of Devil May Cry 5.[80] The novel makes many references to previous games and novels, as well shedding more background on certain scenes that are seen in Devil May Cry 5. The story is told from multiple characters' perspective: Nero, Dante, Nico, V, Lady, Trish, Lucia and J.D. Morrison.\n\nA spin-off manga centered around V was also released.[81] Titled Devil May Cry 5: Visions of V, it was written by Tomio Ogata and serialized on Line Manga from 7 March 2019 to 19 March 2022. Its 50 chapters were collected into five physical tankōbon volumes, with the first volume released on 15 November 2019, and the final volume released on 15 July 2022.\n\nAn official Japanese artbook, Devil May Cry 5 Official Art Works, was published by KADOKAWA on April 26th, 2019. No English version has been released as of yet.\n\nRelease[]\n\nDevil May Cry 5 was released on March 8, 2019.[5] A demo exclusive on Xbox One was made available as of December 7th, 2018.[15]\n\nReception[]\n\nFollowing 2018's Tokyo Game Show, Devil May Cry 5 won the Future Division award from the Japan Game Awards.[82] Devil May Cry 5 received \"generally favorable reviews\" on all platforms, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[83][84][85] The gameplay and characters were praised.[86][87][88] PC Gamer UK referred to it as \"one of the best games about hitting demons ever made\". The reviewer enjoyed the characters' fightstyles and how performing different techniques rewards the player for their originality in combat.[87] USgamer found it one of the series' strongest installments. They noted that while the reboot by Ninja Theory was enjoyable, Devil May Cry 5 remained true to the series' core when it came to gameplay mechanics and the handling of the characters.[89] VideoGamer.com praised its gameplay and world building style—particularly its handling of the setting based on London.[90] Similarly, The Guardian gave it a perfect score. The reviewer liked how newcomers can easily learn how to score the stylish system in a short time, noting they must also understand the enemies' tactics to beat them and the bosses. Metro agreed with this assessment.[91][92] GameSpot appreciated the depth Capcom offered players, most notably the change in Nero's gameplay to allow different styles of Devil Breaker techniques.[86] Metro noted that despite the belief that characters move slower than in cutscenes, the gameplay provides the player with the possibility to imitate the cutscenes while performing combos to the point they reach the level of possibility presented by the critically acclaimed action game Bayonetta.[92] Destructoid enjoyed the multiple types of enemies and boss fights and noted Capcom had responded to criticism of Devil May Cry 4 by providing the player with more stages.[93]\n\nSeveral critics focused on the increased number of moves available to the three protagonists. While giving it a perfect score, The Daily Telegraph praised the characters' mechanics, most notably V's for how differently he plays in contrast to Nero and Dante while still remaining entertaining.[88] GamesRadar enjoyed the great variety each of the three playable characters possess in combat while retaining their own style—this, despite Dante playing similarly to his Devil May Cry 4 persona.[94] Metro noted that while Nero is a character for rookies, Dante's gameplay is far more complex. The reviewer enjoyed the unique gameplay provided by V.[92] GameSpot agreed with Metro on how engaging Nero is to newcomers thanks to his gameplay. They also felt the techniques V presents and how differently he plays from Dante and Nero is impressive.[86] IGN liked Nero's new techniques provided by his mechanical arms—most notably the one he shoots to attack enemies. While IGN felt Dante was similar to his presentation in previous games, they noted the new weapons he presents were much more enjoyable. V was also well-received for his interactions with the demons he commands to fight enemies.[95] Due to some difficulties in handling Nero's Devil Breakers mechanics, Destructoid felt that Dante and Nero were the most polished characters to play.[93] Despite enjoying the gameplay, the swapping between characters who need to earn new powers was criticized by Game Informer.[96]\n\nThe game's narrative and concept was also the subject of praise by IGN for its characters and elements of the story, despite the reviewer not finding it very entertaining overall.[95][90][94] IGN's Mitchell Saltzman said \"its mysterious story keeps things interesting along the way.\"[95] GameSpot praised the storyline for concluding the crisis the protagonists have across the game, praising their character arcs even though they are not deep.[86] The Guardian liked the plot despite finding it simple and noted it took elements from the reboot that were also well-received. Dante's characterization as older than in previous games while retaining his juvenile personality was also praised by The Guardian.[91] PCGamer enjoyed the story for the portrayal of its characters. The reviewer felt let down by some cutscenes and was critical of Nico.[87] While liking how integral the narrative became in the gameplay mechanics, GamesRadar felt newcomers might not understand the game's full plot and that the ending was rushed.[94] VideoGamer.com was more critical of the plot, believing the narrative, and villain were \"dull\" despite some interesting interactions in the storyline (they also noted it still takes the appeal Devil May Cry 3 introduced).[90] While describing it as cheesy and over the top because of on Nero's personality, Metro found it difficult to know how the story should be taken. They appreciated how Devil May Cry 5 offers the option to show the plot of previous games, making it more accessible in the process.[92]\n\nSales[]\n\nIn Japan, approximately 116,202 physical units, or 75.75% of its initial shipment for the PS4, were sold during its launch week making it the number one selling game of any format,[97][98] While selling fewer units than the debut of Devil May Cry 4, it still surpassed the reboot DmC.[99] In the United Kingdom, Devil May Cry 5 debuted atop the all-format sales chart selling 20,872 physical copies, becoming Capcom's second number-one in the country in 2019 following the Resident Evil 2 remake.[100] At the 2019 Game Developers Conference, Itsuno revealed the game had sold more than two million copies, reaching the figure within two weeks of its release.[101] In September 2019, the game had sold over 2.7 million copies worldwide[102] and in September 2021, sales figures have risen to 3.9 million copies sold.[103] In June 30, 2021, the game had sold at 4.5 million units, making it the best selling title in the series.[104] As of October 2022, the game has sold over six million units.[105]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nDevil May Cry 5 is notable for these distinctions within the series.\n\nIt is the first time Eva is shown in-game (not counting her DmC counterpart).\n\nThe first time Dante and Vergil's childhood home is seen.\n\nThe first time since Devil May Cry 2 where Dante can choose multiple swords.\n\nCoincidentally, it is also the first time since the original game where Dante wields the Sparda sword.\n\nThe first time material outside of the games is either mentioned or fully integrated into the lore, from Dante's alias first mentioned in novels to characters like Morrison and Patty from the anime.\n\nThe first instance of an official timeline being used for the story.\n\nThe first time more than two playable characters share a unified campaign.\n\nThe first instance of multiplayer elements.\n\nThe first instance since Devil May Cry 2 to implement the Trigger Heart.\n\nThe first time in canon where Dante and related characters talk during Devil Trigger.\n\nThe first time since Devil May Cry 2 where Dante has access to a second, more powerful variation of his Devil Trigger.\n\nThe first time where the final boss role is reprized as well as the first time since the original Devil May Cry where the final boss is fought multiple times in a row.\n\nIn addition, this is the second time (third if one counts DmC: Devil May Cry) where Vergil is the final boss.\n\nThe game takes many cues from DmC: Devil May Cry.\n\nDante's EX color is patterned after his counterpart.\n\nVergil's Doppleganger as well as his overall fighting style takes some cues from his alternate version, not only holding the Yamato face up but even using a Helm Breaker-like technique along with Yamato's ability to cut open portals to travel between areas.\n\nEnemies having a stylized intro displaying their name.\n\nNero's new appearance as well as his tendency to use more vulgar swear words also harkens back to Dante's DmC counterpart.\n\nV's default black hair color changing to white when in Devil Trigger.\n\nAn announcer calling out Stylish Ranks.\n\nGallery[]\n\nPromotional art[]\n\nMerchandise[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
