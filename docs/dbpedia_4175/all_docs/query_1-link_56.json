        "text": "The best year for gaming was 2003 according to a study by online gaming site Spades Challenge, who analysed the top 2,000 video game titles on Metacritic based on user scores to see which year has produced the most fan favourites.\n\nThe study found that 2003 was the best year for gaming, with 199, or 9.95 per cent of the 2,000 titles studied being released in 2003. The highest-rated games included Fire Emblem, Gothic II, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (pictured), andDay of Defeat. The yearâ€™s most dominant consoles were the PS2, Xbox and GameCube, and the year also saw Valve officially launch the Steam service.\n\nNext in the study comes 2003, with 168, or 8.4 per cent of the total titles studied being released that year. The year saw the release of games like Half-Life 2, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, and Burnout 3: Takedown. Handheld consoles like the Nintendo DS and PSP were also released in the same year."
