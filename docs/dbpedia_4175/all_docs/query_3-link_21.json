        "text": "DmC: Devil May Cry is a 3D hack & slash action game developed by Ninja Theory and published by Capcom for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. First announced in late 2010, DmC: Devil May Cry is a reimagining game, officialy labeled as a reboot, in the Devil May Cry series. It is set in an alternate setting of the Devil May Cry universe and it is also the first title that is not developed by Capcom, though its still generally considered the fifth installment in the overall series.\n\nThe story focus on the player character Dante, a teenage vigilante able to use supernatural powers, who finds himself under attack by a sentient town known as Limbo City populated by demons.\n\nDmC: Devil May Cry was released in January 2013. Art for the game was handled by Alessandro Taini, visual art director at Ninja Theory. A remastered edition titled DmC: Definitive Edition, running at 1080p/60fps and including bonus content, was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on March 10, 2015.\n\nGameplay[]\n\nDmC: Devil May Cry is an action game where the player character Dante uses multiple attacks to defeat enemies. Dante has access to several weapons such as swords and guns which he can exchange in the middle of a fight to perform a combo.\n\nWhile the gameplay remains similar to its predecessors, DmC: Devil May Cry has several changes that set it apart. Dante is a Nephilim (half-demon/half-angel), instead of being a half-human, half-demon hybrid. Because of this change in lineage, game mechanics were also changed to reflect this, utilizing the trigger buttons to access angelic or demonic aligned weapons. Although Dante is primarily in human form, the player has access to his angel and demon powers that add a large variety of attacks. This is represented by the fact that Dante's black hair changes to white during a sequence of combos.\n\nDante's sword Rebellion can now transform into an axe, a scythe, and a grappling hook (that works much like Nero's Snatch ability), and a few other weapons. This allows for Dante to have access to all of his weaponry, similar to Devil May Cry 4, which the player can cycle through the D-Pad.\n\nThe game also has a much heavier emphasis on the environment, where the city itself is one of Dante's greatest adversaries. The city's structure changes several times across the game, giving the player puzzles in order to advance. With roads giving way to nothingness, and alleyways closing off, Dante must fight not only the demons that appear, but also Limbo itself. This creates hectic obstacle course sequences that involve jumping, air dashing, and grappling through areas, along with some battlefields containing hazards that Dante must avoid, but can also exploit.\n\nCombat[]\n\nCombat differs slightly from previous games. There are no \"Styles\", but new attack patterns can be initiated by holding down the left or right trigger buttons. The game still uses a time-based input mechanic for combos in line with previous Devil May Cry games. The game also no longer uses a \"hard lock\" system for Dante's attacks. As such, the game utilizes a proprietary \"Launch\" button for \"Lock-On + Back\" attacks like \"High Time\" and included \"Forward + Forward\" motions for \"Lock-On Forward\" attacks such as \"Stinger\". High-level-play abilities like \"Jump Cancel\" even make a return, as well as just charges. With the use of a soft lock, Dante will often attack whatever is closest in front of him, but the lock-on the game uses is easily overridden by tilting the left stick towards a desired target, while also being able to use a target switch key for long-range targeting. Another new inclusion to the combat is the use of input buffering, which makes it marginally easier to perform continuous attacks.\n\nOrbs are once again rewarded for dispatching enemies. Red Orbs reprise their role as the currency used to pruchase items, while White Orbs are now accumulated and used to upgrade Dante's abilities and weapons. The Style meter also saw an improvement, now listing a score along with the moves incorporated into the combos, giving the player more feedback. The music itself will even begin as a slight background beat, becoming more and more prominent, bringing in guitar riffs and even vocals as the player's performance reaches a higher Style grade, just as the older system would reach from D up to A and even SSS.\n\nSimilarly to the third and fourth installments in the main series, the Style meter in DmC retains the currently highest full rank the player has reached until the battle is over or if they are struck by an attack. When the player reaches S Rank and higher, they also receive a boost to their speed, further pushing players to do their best to gain the upper-hand in battle.\n\nThe style ranks are also different, titled after the more aggressive tone the game sets:\n\nDirty!\n\nCruel!\n\nBrutal!\n\nAnarchic!\n\nSavage!\n\nSSadistic!!\n\nSSSensational!!!\n\nEnemies come in a variety of shapes, sizes and weights, and while many incarnations will broadcast their attacks well before they strike, their AI is slightly different, based in part on how the player is fighting. Most enemies seek to surround and flank Dante, with some grounded enemies standing at the edge of Rebellion's basic reach. The demons also often attack when Dante is in middle of a combo, aiming more to interrupt his attacks and reduce the player's Style grade. Enemies also become more aggressive the higher the Style grade is, with A rank and above seeing them attack more frequently.\n\nSome enemies can also only be harmed by specific types of weapons, based on their color, e.g. a Hell Knight can only be damaged by Demon weapons, while a Ghost Rage can only be affected by Angel Weapons. This restricts players to using only those specific weapons, along with the applicable version of Ophion, but also pushes them to generate typified \"color combos\" that still yield high Style, and thus greater rewards.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nDante\n\nVergil\n\nMundus\n\nSparda\n\nEva\n\nKat - A spirit medium and an important member of The Order, Kat serves as Dante's guide for much of the game. Kat has a sweet, innocent nature, and is willing to risk her life in pursuit of The Order's goals. Kat also help Dante connect with emotions deeper than his initial rush of vengeance and bitterness, learning humility and compassion much in the same way the classic Dante did from his human side. Kat has the ability to see and hear Limbo, able to interact with Dante wherever he may be. She uses her spraycans and stencils to create magical glyphs in the area, which serve several purposes, principal among them marking points from which Dante can escape from Limbo. She also does not appear as a reflective shade as the others do when seen from within Limbo, and instead appears as an incorporeal version of herself. Kat also has a small hexagonal spheroid device that allows her to manipulate the immediate environment in various ways.\n\nPhineas - A elderly demon as well as a scholar, inventor and prophet. Despite being a demon, he was imprisoned for not supporting Mundus, and longs to see the demon king overthrown. Phineas is quite wise and averse to violence, although he supports Dante's own urge to avenge his family and gives him advice on how to hurt the demon lord. When Dante finds the prophet, Phineas has lost his right eye to the harpies that are attacking him. He asks Dante for his help in getting his eye back from the harpies. The prophet calls for the harpies and keeps them distracted while Dante infiltrates their nest and find the eye. When he returns, he gives Phineas his eye. Placing his eye in its place, the prophet's eyesight is returned.\n\nStory[]\n\nThe game is set in a parallel universe in the Devil May Cry series and and is not part of the main games' storyline. The story tells of teenager Dante and his journey through the fictitious Limbo City, a dreary city that appears calm at first, but transforms into a twisted parody of itself with demons and other monstrosities who frequently attempt to kill him whenever he is caught in the sight of one of the city's demonic security cameras. The story also depicts Dante's growth into a figure similar to his classic counterpart.\n\nThe game's events are set into motion when Dante is taking two women from Devil's Dalliance back to his trailer home at the Bellevue Pier. After a raucous night of booze-fueled promiscuity, Dante wakes up to a young woman warning him that he's in danger. As Dante opens the door, the girl explains that he left a trail for a Hunter Demon to follow, and Dante is subsequently dragged into Limbo. After acrobatically getting dressed, Dante is guided through the Bellevue Pier's carnival by the girl, who introduces herself as Kat, a psychic medium who can see him in Limbo. Upon defeating his demon pursuer, it referred to him as \"Son of Sparda,\" to Dante's confusion, and taunted the young man that he had been found. After returning to the human dimension, Dante is asked by Kat to come with her and meet her boss. Reluctantly, Dante accepts the proposal to repay the assistance Kat gave him at the pier.\n\nAlong the way, Kat explains that she is part of The Order, a rogue group led by who Dante calls \"that masked freak on the 'net,\" hell-bent on exposing the demons to the world and releasing Limbo City from their clutches. The leader of The Order introduces himself as Vergil, and asks Dante about his past, which he remembers very little of thanks to a bout of meningitis when he was younger. Vergil explains that he too had lost his memory, but the instances that cause their amnesia was something only humans suffered from. Vergil explains that Dante is exceedingly important, and with his help The Order can bring down the demons. Dante scoffs at the idea, but Vergil pleads with Dante to at least let him show Dante their shared past.\n\nVergil, Kat, and Dante arrive at Paradise, a dilapidated mansion outside of the city that seemingly holds the key to Dante's past. There, he discovers a portrait of a man named Sparda, which he deduces to be his father. Along the way, Dante's sees apparitions of his youth, playing games with another boy named Vergil, coming to the realization that he and the white-haired man are brothers. Further investigating the mansion, Dante finds a portrait of a red-haired woman named Eva, whom he fondly remembers as his loving mother. Coming to terms with all he's learned, Dante sees more apparitions, this time of Eva screaming that \"they found us\" and running from armed assailants. As Limbo starts to tear apart the simulacrum of Paradise, Dante can do little but escape back to the gateway Kat made for him. Once back in the human dimension, Dante requests more information from his brother, Vergil.\n\nVergil obliges, taking Dante to an old playground within the city limits. Dante remembers the area as a place that Eva used to take the brothers. Looking over graffiti-slathered walls, Vergil explains how a war between angels and demons has been raging for generations, and during that time, their father Sparda had fallen in love with an angel, Eva. Eva soon gave birth to the twin boys, which infuriated the king of the demonic realm and Sparda's blood brother, Mundus. Having created a Nephilim, Sparda and Eva created the only race of beings that could slay Mundus, so he attacked and killed Eva, tearing out her heart. Dante watches as his mother gave her life to protect her family, but Vergil was nowhere to be seen, so Mundus only knew of one Nephilim. As Sparda escaped with Vergil and Dante, he wiped their memories and split them up so they could attempt to live normal lives. Vergil was adopted by a wealthy family that provided for him, but Dante was unfortunately taken to a demon-run orphanage, St Lamia, where he was abused for much of his early life. Sparda returned to Mundus to prevent him from following after the children, and was sentenced to eternal torture and captivity.\n\nRecapping their destiny, Dante asks how they can end Mundus' reign, and avenge their fallen family, but before Vergil can explain more, a Spotter finds the brothers and pulls Dante into Limbo. After fighting his way to a gate Kat made, Vergil explains to Dante the more insidious side of Mundus' actions, and outlines the plans to take out the Raptor News Network for its demonic propaganda, and the Virility Plant that brews the spiked energy drink of the same name. During Kat and Dante's journey to the Virility factory, Dante is once again pulled into the demonic dimension. As he fights his way through the twisted streets, he learns a bit more about Kat, who was taught much of her psychic abilities with Vergil's help. Once they arrive at the Virility Plant, Kat guides Dante from the mixing room and to a rift where she can spray paint a glyph to bring Dante into Limbo. From Limbo, Dante makes his way back to the mixing room, where he finds grotesque tubes feeding into the mixing tanks that people sampled cups of Virility from.\n\nKat helps Dante descend to the bottom of the mixing room's center air duct, where he soon confronts the \"secret ingredient,\" a disgusting, monstrous slug-like Succubus demon hooked up to the same cords and tubes that lined the walls of the factory. During his battle with the Succubus, Dante systematically removes the demon's intubation until she falls into a river of what could only be years of her own vomit, where Dante then forces her into an industrial fan at the back of her chamber, which promptly tears her apart.\n\nSome time later, Dante, Kat, and Vergil stand on an overpass with a clear view of the Raptor News Tower, Dante's next target. Using one of Kat's glyphs on the bridge, Dante plunges into the water below, coming out in an upside-down realm, walking along the underside of the structure. On his way to the tower, Dante is obstructed from his straight path, making his way through a penitentiary that confines human souls, and ends up coming across a helpless demon, Phineas, who lost his one good cybernetic eye to harpies. In return for retrieving Phineas' eye, the blind demon offers to help Dante. Dante follows the harpies through the subway system to their nest, where he snatches up Phineas' eye, kills the demons there, and returns to the blind prophet.\n\nWhile walking with Phineas, Dante learns that Phineas was imprisoned by Mundus over a century ago, and that other Nephilim have come before the Sons of Sparda. One in particular, Assiel, did much for the world before her demise. Guiding Dante, Phineas helps the young Nephilim unleash a hidden power within him, the Devil Trigger, and then questions his purpose of targeting Barbas and Raptor News. Dante divulges his intentions of killing the demon king, and Phineas in turn divulges to Dante that Lilith, Mundus' concubine, is pregnant with an heir. Dante is unsure of what to make of Phineas' commands of killing the child, but he thanks Phineas for his help, and continues on to confront Bob Barbas in the Raptor News Tower. Dante is left pondering Phineas' parting words, \"When Mundus is defeated, who will take his place?\"\n\nWithin the Raptor News Tower, Dante and Barbas face off, with the demon badmouthing the young Nephilim and riling him up, even breaking up the fight to show Dante a newscast that local enforcement agencies found Kat and the ringleader of The Order, and were mobilizing on their headquarters. An angry Dante subdues Barbas with bullets from his twin pistols, and then quickly hurries back to The Order.\n\nDante gets pulled into Limbo upon his arrival at The Order's headquarters, just as SWAT teams are entering the compound. Dante watches in horror as the armed forces mercilessly kill any members of the Order they come across, while specifically searching for Kat. When Dante finally reaches Kat's location, she guides him down to the server room where Vergil is holed up. In the server room, Vergil helps Kat to expunge terabytes of data and back it up to a secure location, while Dante fights off incoming waves of demons. When all is done, Kat sets up the headquarters to self-destruct, and Vergil intends to leave her behind while he and Dante escape from Limbo. Dante stays behind to comfort Kat, instructing her on how to endure being taken into custody just as SWAT teams swarm through the server room, shooting Kat in the arm, and then beating her into unconsciousness as Dante watches helplessly from Limbo. With Kat dragged away, Dante meets up with Vergil.\n\nSome time later, Vergil receives a video message of Mundus requesting to trade Kat for the Nephilim, Dante. Vergil is surprised to know that Mundus still doesn't know of his existence as a Nephilim as well, but nonetheless denies Dante the opportunity of saving Kat's life. Dante then offers up the information about Lilith and her unborn demon child, and the two brothers come to an agreement of kidnapping Lilith in exchange for bringing Mundus away from Silversacks Towers and possibly saving Kat. Dante returns to Devil's Dalliance and attempts to engage Lilith when she drags him into Limbo, and forces him to run through a Reality TV-like gauntlet in order to reach her. As Dante meets with Lilith face to face, she mutters of her intentions of bringing Dante's corpse to Mundus to earn favor, and even brings out their demon spawn to help battle the Nephilim.\n\nEven as a gargantuan demon, the newborn and its mother are no match for Dante, and she agrees to go along quietly as long as they don't hurt the child, as Lilith says she's nothing without it. Near the shipping docks, Dante and Vergil set up their trade with SWAT for Lilith in exchange for Kat. However, during the trade, Vergil sets his scope on Lilith and blows a hole in her abdomen, killing the demon spawn, and then shooting Lilith herself in the head. In the ensuing chaos, Vergil and Dante subdue the SWAT team and save Kat. Unfortunately, Mundus watched the exchange take place, and became enraged knowing his child was killed. In response, Mundus drew power from the Hell Gate in his office, and unleashed a powerful wave of Malice that destroys most of Limbo's shipping district where the exchange took place. Dante, pulled into Limbo, runs through the crumbling streets saving Vergil and Kat in their escaping car from debris that falls into their path.\n\nBack at the safehouse, Kat informs the twins on what she learned while being held captive in the Silver Sacks Tower, where she used her astral projection to snoop around the grounds in Limbo. With this information, the remnants of The Order make one final attempt to reach Mundus, with Dante storming in through the front doors while Vergil sneaks in from the back, helping Dante reach higher up in the tower by taking down security protocols. Near the apex of the tower, Dante finally squares off against Drekavac a final time, routing the demon before moving on. Meeting up with Vergil, the two make their way through the Furnace of Souls, a desolate space of fiery captive souls and crag. At the top, Dante helps Vergil reactivate the generators that power the vault to Mundus' office, and once open, the two being the final phase of their plan.\n\nDante, tasked with drawing Mundus away from the Hell Gate, infuriates the demon king with snide comments about demon-kind and particularly Mundus' child. Mundus blasts Dante out of the office, and then rushes into him, the two of them flying out of Silversacks and onto a nearby roof. With his chance upon him, Vergil uses the Yamato to close the Hell Gate, cutting off Mundus from his immortality, and capturing his demonic soul in the human vessel Kyle Ryder. However, Mundus is still a formidable opponent, and attempts to tear out Dante's heart until he is stabbed in the back by Vergil. Mundus falls off the roof and onto a car, but instead of perishing, energy swarms around his body, and debris gathers together, forming a colossal entity of Malice, concrete, and iron. Together, the Nephilim work to take down Mundus, and expose the soul-locked body of Kyle Ryder at its core. With Mundus defeated and the Hell Gate closed, there's is nothing left to sustain Limbo, and the demonic dimension deteriorates, and demons are left in plain sight for the entire world to see.\n\nWith social media and news organizations buzzing with recent events, Dante, Kat, and Vergil look out over the city from what's left of the playground the brothers frequented as children. Vergil thanks Dante for all his help, and begins to outline his plan for ruling over humankind, which both Dante and Kat disagree with, having thought they were fighting for their freedom. Dante deduces that Vergil was only after freedom for the Nephilim, so they could live without fear of reprisal from a demon king, and Vergil claims that humans are frail, like children, and that humanity needs protection from itself. The only way to ensure that is for the Nephilim brothers to rule over the lesser race. Vergil, astounded at Dante's reaction, claims that it was them, the two Nephilim that save the humans. Angry, Dante emphasizes that without a human - Kat - they wouldn't have been able to free mankind, and would have failed miserably. Vergil states that if Dante wants no part in ruling the humans, then he should stand aside and let his brother rule alone. Dante lashes out, yelling that he didn't help his brother defeat Mundus so he could take his place, where suddenly Phineas' parting words made all too much sense.\n\nDante can't allow his own flesh and blood to rule over the people he had just freed, and Vergil can't let his brother obstruct his bid for domination. With the two brother's at odds, they cross swords. As the two Nephilim battled, Dante continually pleaded with his brother to reconsider, to no avail. In the end, Dante had no choice but to unleash the devil inside him and run Vergil through the heart with Rebellion. Unsure of what to do, Dante forced Vergil to the ground, impaling him with his sword until Kat begged him to let him live. Sheathing his sword, Dante helps Vergil to his feet, and declares that the world is under his protection. Vergil responds that his brother has chosen the wrong side, and that he'll never be human. Opening a dimensional rift with Yamato, Vergil mutters \"I loved you, brother\" before disappearing through the portal.\n\nDante is left questioning who he really is, and Kat succinctly replies that he is Dante—\"nothing more and nothing less.\" With the world under his protection, Dante has many trials ahead, eradicating the scourge of demons that now exist among humankind, and coming to grips with what it means to be a Nephilim, and a Son of Sparda. The final scene shows a quick close-up of Dante's eyes, which flash with demonic power.\n\nVergil's Downfall[]\n\nAn extra epilogue chapter, titled Vergil's Downfall, available as downloadable content.\n\nFatally wounded from his battle with Dante, Vergil makes it back to Paradise but staggers to his mother's grave. As he rails against his failure, he succumbs to his injuries and collapses, falling into Hell. He soon becomes aware that his pendant is missing, and also hears a message from his departed mother that he can still find salvation despite his death. Although he attempts to follow her directions, he is cut down by the demons guarding the exit and falls further into Hell, where meets an apparition of himself named Hollow Vergil; Hollow Vergil is wearing Vergil's missing pendant, although Vergil does not appear to notice. The apparition chastises Vergil for his weakness and reveals a large disembodied heart which he claims is Vergil's; he charges Vergil with \"correcting\" the three holes in that heart.\n\nAs Vergil goes back to the rest of Hell, he finds what appears to be Kat and saves her from the Imprisoner who was chasing her. However, she reveals herself as nothing but a demonic apparition of his former friend, and taunts him by playing upon his anger at Kat choosing Dante over him; overcome by wrath, he slays the girl, \"correcting\" the first hole. Vergil then comes across an apparition of his brother, who immediately begins taunting him for being weaker and for trusting Dante. Seemingly unaware that this is not the real Dante, Vergil chases him down with the intent of slaying him as well, and eventually corners him at a replica of Assiel, where he slays the demon and takes his pendant. Frustrated when the pendant does not allow him to use his Devil Trigger, he is convinced by his doppelganger to resolve the last hole in his heart by hunting down his mother, Eva, and taking revenge on her for allegedly favoring Dante. Vergil finds his mother, this time the real article, being chased by another Imprisoner that he eventually tracks down and slays. Just as Eva expresses relief at being saved, he presents \"Dante\"'s pendant and claims to have killed his brother, filling her with grief. Although she explains that she always loved both her sons equally, Vergil coldly ignores her and returns to Hollow Vergil, having now completely discarded his heart and become dedicated to achieving more power.\n\nFinally realizing that Hollow Vergil is in possession of his pendant, Vergil attacks his doppelganger and manages to defeat him, taking back the pendant and subjugating the apparition as part of his own soul. With his powers restored and his compassion gone, Vergil is returned back to where he entered Hell; he tries once again to exit Hell and this time succeeds, coming to where he originally collapsed on his mother's grave. He is approached by a horde of demons, but when they recognize his acceptance of his demonic nature, they quickly bow down to their new demonic lord.\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nAlthough their previous game, Devil May Cry 4, was a commercial success, Capcom thought about rebooting the Devil May Cry series taking into account how other game series had better sales.[1] They chose Ninja Theory, impressed with their work on their action-adventure hack and slash game Heavenly Sword which Capcom thought would work with a Devil May Cry game.\n\nThe game was officially announced by Capcom at their press conference during the 2010 Tokyo Game Show in September, confirming an earlier rumor in the May 2010 issue of gaming magazine Game Informer which said that the fifth Devil May Cry game would be developed by the independent video game UK company Ninja Theory. The Japanese Capcom staff told the Western staff to make a game with a different direction.\n\nNinja Theory's creative director Tameem Antoniades stated that DmC's combat system would contain mechanics that would set him apart from previous Platinum Games' titles with former Capcom member Hideki Kamiya being the original creator of Devil May Cry. Lead producer Alex Jones stated they still wanted to compete with Platinum in terms of gameplay and storytelling. The idea of a town being alive that wishes to kill the player was added a new element never seen before in the Devil May Cry series.[2] The actions of Limbo Town are inspired by previous Devil May Cry games, where the environments would close whenever Dante was surrounded by enemies. Combat designer Rahni Tucker commented on how newcomers to the series have difficulties understanding how advance players from the classic Devil May Cry games could perform several combos that combined multiple skills and weapons. As a result, she designed the combat to be appeal to newcomers so that they could easily perform elaborated combos, while still offering gameplay that advance players would enjoy.[3]\n\nMost of the game was finished as of April 2012 with Capcom aiding Ninja Theory in tweaking few aspects for the final product. Capcom became heavily involved in the combat system to ensure the character's responsive moves and add new air combos never seen before in the franchise.[4] The development team included over ninety members with nearly ten of them being from Capcom. While Capcom's Hideaki Itsuno oversaw the project, Jones and Motohide Eshiro acted as producers. They wanted to aid the Ninja Theory developers in making DmC play more like the previous Devil May Cry games.[5] The release of the PC version was delayed for a faster release of the console iterations. However, Ninja Theory was planning to start launching of the PC version shortly afterwards the console version, aiming for the shortest gap possible. This depended on the time that the PC version finishes development. As a result of speculation regarding Vergil being a playable character, Jones stated that Dante would be the only one controlled by the player (although after the game's release, Vergil would later become playable in DLC content). The game uses the Unreal Engine.[6]\n\nDmC is the first Ninja Theory game written by Tameem Antoniades. Dante's original design was originally meant to be similar to his classic counterpart, but Capcom (who believed that Dante's old look was \"no longer considered cool anymore\") told Ninja Theory that it had to be completely different in order to appeal to a younger demographic, even though the former expected this to create a negative response.[7] While the original Dante was designed from a Japanese perspective, the new one was made from a Western perspective. The final model was inspired by Christopher Nolan's film The Dark Knight as Tameem Antoniades from Ninja Theory commented they wished to make the character realistic. In an interview published by Official Xbox Magazine, Jones explained that he received numerous death threats in the form of comic books and a metal song due to the controversial decision to reboot the series.[8] Antoniades responded to criticism stating they would not change the design as the character is supposed to fit within the game's setting.[9] Nevertheless, Antoniades stated that the gameplay would be similar to previous Devil May Cry games. In November 2011, an extended trailer and new concept art was released.[10][11] The music for the game was composed by electronic groups Noisia and Combichrist. A playable demo was released on 20 November 2012.[12]\n\nIn December 2014, Capcom announced that DmC: Definitive Edition, a remastered edition of the game, would be released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game contain numerous new improvements and features such as the 1080p resolution and 60 fps frame rate, rebalanced gameplay, all downloadable content available to the previous generation versions,[13] a minor extra ending scene, a new Bloody Palace mode for Vergil,[14] a Turbo Mode which gives a 20 percent boost to game speed, Hardcore mode which increases the game's difficulty, Gods Must Die difficulty level wherein enemies have Devil Trigger and deal 2.5 times the normal damage,[15] Must Style mode wherein enemies can only be damaged when the style rank is S and above, new costumes unavailable to the previous versions, updated trophies and achievements, and new leaderboards for Hardcore mode.[16] The edition was released on March 10, 2015.\n\nDownloadable content[]\n\nA few days after the release of the game on PC, the first \"Costume Pack\" downloadable content (DLC) was released for all consoles. The packs contains several outfits for Dante to use in the main game, which includes a Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening outfit, a \"Dark Dante\" outfit and a \"Neo Dante\" outfit.[17]\n\nOn 20 February 2013, the second DLC for the game, called Bloody Palace, was released.[18] The free DLC is a survival mode, pitting players against 101 waves of enemies and bosses.[19] Along with Bloody Palace, there is also a \"Weapons Bundle\" DLC, which includes three sets of skins (Bone, Gold and Samurai) for three in-game weapons (Arbiter, Osiris and Revenant). The bundle also unlocks two in-game perks, Orb Harvester and Item Finder, plus gives the player three upgrade points. The skin packs were previously available as store-exclusive pre-order DLCs for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions.[20]\n\nOn 6 March 2013, the fourth DLC, Vergil's Downfall, was released.[21] The DLC adds a new section in the main game, giving players a new single-player campaign featuring Vergil as the main character.[22] The DLC has its own leaderboard, stats and set of trophies. This DLC is available for free for those who have pre-ordered the game on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.[23]\n\nMerchandise[]\n\nA two part comic series, The Chronicles of Vergil was released as a tie-in and prequel to the DmC game. The story revolves around the initial relationship between Kat and Vergil.\n\nReception[]\n\nEarly reaction to the game was widely negative, generally as a result of Dante's visual redesign; nevertheless, DMC received positive reviews from critics and players upon release. Critics praised the gameplay, artstyle and story of the game, as well as the redesigned Dante. The game initially failed to meet Capcom's sales expectation, but Capcom later revealed that the company was satisfied with the sales of the game.\n\nBefore the game was released, early reception to the new design of Dante and change in direction of the series was negative. The series' original creator, Hideki Kamiya, was negative about the game's direction and stated he was \"missing\" Dante although in later tweets he expected people to try the game.[24][25] Despite the critisim from various video game sites, other sites also listed it as one of the most anticipated games of 2012 stating that, despite the controversy the game caused, it looked promising, owing to the presentation and the fact the gameplay had yet to be tested. On September 2012, Capcom US producer Alex Jones claimed that some of the negative response had turned positive.[26] Dante's voice actor from Devil May Cry 3 and 4, Reuben Langdon, while expressing disappointment with Dante's characterization, had positive impressions about the game and urged fans to try it.[27] In a July 2018 interview, Matt Walker, the producer of Devil May Cry 5, stated that director Hideaki Itsuno was \"proud\" of DmC, finding it to be just as important as the other titles in the series.[28]\n\nDmC: Devil May Cry received positive reviews from critics. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively gave the Xbox 360 version 86.33% and 86/100, the PlayStation 3 version 85.75% and 85/100 and the PC version 85.10% and 85/100. DmC: Definitive Edition also received positive reviews from critics, the aforementioned review websites respectively gave the PlayStation 4 version 85.00% and 85/100 and the Xbox One version 85.31% and 86/100.\n\nSales[]\n\nCapcom initially hoped to ship 2 million copies by the end of its financial year; later, it revised its predictions to 1.2 million copies shipped. As of June 2014, 1.6 million copies have been sold. Capcom noted that the game did not catch Eastern gamers' attention and made less than its previous iteration, Devil May Cry 4. Capcom also mentioned other reasons for their poor sales in 2013 including a \"delayed response to the expanding digital contents market,\" \"insufficient coordination between the marketing and the game development divisions in overseas markets,\" and a \"decline in quality due to excessive outsourcing\", though whether or not any of the comments were applicable to DmC: Devil May Cry or Capcom itself was left ambiguous. It was later confirmed that Capcom was satisfied with the game's sales.[29]\n\nLegacy[]\n\nIn both Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition and Devil May Cry 5, Dante has a costume named \"EX Dante\" that is meant to be an homage to his DmC counterpart.[30] Additionally, the promotional DMC4SE render of the costume has the classic Dante in the same pose seen in the cover of DmC: Devil May Cry.\n\nIn an interview with ReseroNetwork in 2019, Hideaki Itsuno stated that the team fully intended to make a sequel to DmC, but for \"various reasons\" it never got off the ground.[citation needed]\n\nFor Devil May Cry 5, Itsuno has stated that he took what he learned from working on DmC: Devil May Cry and applied that to the game,[31] this can be seen from new features such as the addition of \"The Void\" (meant to mirror the \"Training\" mode), camera zooms added for fanfare during a finishing blow, voice announcers for earned Stylish Ranks, and dynamic BGM's that change depending on player performance and the final boss of the game resembling the one in the reboot, gameplay-wise.\n\nIn 2019, Reuben Langdon spoke in an interview that Hideaki Itsuno wanted to leave Capcom after DmC: Devil May Cry, stating that he was not happy. However, he didn't make it clear whether Itsuno was unhappy about DmC: Devil May Cry itself, which caused some misinformation being spread that Itsuno did not like the reboot.[32] Devil May Cry 5 producer Matthew Walker later stated on Twitter that Itsuno was proud of DmC, and that the reboot had \"nothing to do with this conversation\".[33]\n\nIn the book The Art of Devil May Cry 5, one of the concept arts of the Devil May Cry van has the words \"D.M.C. Devil May Cry\". In Devil May Cry 5 itself, the Mission 05 Clear Bonus Art shows V drinking a can of Virility.\n\nAside from Devil May Cry games, the DmC Dante is present in both Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale and Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite; in the former he is included as a playable character, meant to portray the Devil May Cry series. In the latter he is one of the costumes available to the classic Dante.\n\nIn TEPPEN, the DmC Dante has a minor appearance in the form of a skin for the classic Dante which is titled \"Black Hair\", this skin is based on the EX Dante costumes mentioned above.[34] This same recolor appears in the mobile game A.I.M.$ as a costume for Dante.\n\nGallery[]\n\nBox Art[]\n\nMerchandise[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nOfficial website (Japanese)\n\nOfficial Facebook page\n\nWikipedia article"
