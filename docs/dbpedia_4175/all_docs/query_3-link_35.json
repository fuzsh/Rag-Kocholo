        "text": "This article is about the 2013 video game. For the first game in the series, see Devil May Cry (video game).\n\nDmC: Devil May Cry is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Ninja Theory and published by Capcom. Released in January for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows, it is a reboot of the Devil May Cry series and set in a parallel universe to the mainline series.\n\nThe game's story focuses on the player character Dante, a young drifter who secretly hunts demons, who live among and rule over humans. Dante is a Nephilim, the child of an angel and a demon. He is reunited with Vergil, his twin brother, who enlists his help slaying powerful demons, culminating in a fight against Mundus, the demon king who murdered Dante's mother and condemned his father to eternal banishment and suffering. Players can use Dante's iconic sword, Rebellion, and signature handguns, Ebony and Ivory, as well as a variety of other melee weapons and firearms to defeat enemies. The game also introduces \"Angel Mode\" and \"Demon Mode\", which are modifiers to Dante's moveset.\n\nThe re-imagination of the Devil May Cry series was requested by Capcom, resulting in a total reboot. Capcom chose Ninja Theory to develop the game, assisting them to ensure that gameplay was reminiscent, but distinct, compared to previous titles. Early reaction to the game was widely negative, generally as a result of Dante's visual redesign and the drastic change in the tone of his character; nevertheless, DmC received positive reviews from critics upon release, but less favorable reception among fans. Critics praised the gameplay, art style and story, but criticized Dante's redesign."
