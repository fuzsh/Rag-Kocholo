Based in the UK, we bring daily updates, worldwide coverage and discussion.\n\nCubed3 attracts over 250,000 unique visitors per month. Our focus is on daily news, comprehensive reviews, in-depth features and our growing forum of likeminded Nintendo enthusiasts.\n\nFind out more...\n\nContact Cubed3\n\nAdvertising Opportunities\n\nJobs at Cubed3\n\nContent Feeds\n\nCubed3 on Facebook\n\nCubed3 on Twitter\n\nCubed3 on YouTube\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMeet the Cubed3 team\n\nJorge Ba-oh - Managing Director & Founder\n\nJorge is Cubed3's creator and designer, founding the site in 2003 with a huge passion for Nintendo games! Jorge manages Cubed3's technical side, working alongside the Cubed3 team to continue to update the site. He provides news updates and the occasional article or two. He lives and works in Brighton, and enjoys design, arts, music and the occasional visit to the outside world!Â\n\nAdam Riley - Operations Director, Senior Editor\n\nAdam joined up with Cubed3 back when it was merely a fledgling website, providing snippets of news to eager gaming fans. It was not long before he made a strong impression, bombarding Jorge with constant news submissions. Having been a creative talent from a young age, it was only a short time before he squeezed his way into the small team and took control of the retro review side of C3. Once his confidence built up, which certainly did not take a long time, he dipped his toe further into the writing scene with a slew of in-depth articles and even took on the role of Editor for others' work.\n\nMoving away from causing waves throughout the Industry with his rapid-fire news updates, numerous exclusive interviews, and visits to press events, now in the role of Operations Director he focuses more on strong relations with game developers and PR teams, finding new opportunities for the website's growth, as well as producing radio shows.\n\nCubed3 just wouldn't be the same without him!\n\nAz Elias - Senior Editor\n\nAz started playing video games with the SNES, and has owned a variety of systems over the years. Although his gaming interests may have changed with age, Az is generally broad minded and open to most types of games. His favouriteÂ series include The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy and Metroid, and his DOAÂ KasumiÂ statue collection now stands at four.\n\nAn avid supporter of an independent Wales, his other passions include tennis, football, cats, and slowly but surely trying to learn Welsh. Iechyd da!\n\nAthanasios\n\nOfisilÂ (Athanasios Aravositas) has contemplated on the meaning of life the universe and everything at least 42 times. He carries around a wooden sword, wears a +5 INT -15 CHA cloak, andÂ plays life in Nightmare Mode.\n\nLilly Kirchner\n\nSandy Kirchner-Wilson\n\nSandy has been playing and enjoying video games ever since receiving a Game Boy Color at the age of seven. As an avid follower of Nintendo and Sony, he has had many great (and not so great!) gaming experiences with every genre. If he had to pick one genre to play above all others it would be horror action, as exemplified by his favourite series Resident Evil.\n\nLuke Hemming\n\nNayu\n\nNayu is one of Cubed3's newest recruits - a breath of fresh air in the team. She is an avid gamer, in-depth book reviewer, exceptional writer, queen crocheter, as well as being a champion craft & life blogger.\n\nExpect great things to come!\n\nJustin Prinsloo\n\nCatherine Li - Web Development Assistant / Reviewer\n\nCatherine is one of those special stars that can brighten up even the darkest nights. Her talents run from being a software developer (building web applications using JavaScript,Â React, HTML5, CSS, and more),Â to singing like an angel, gaming like a pro, modelling like a superstar, and just being one of the most outrageously funny and charming people you'll ever have the pleasure of meeting.\n\nAlbert Lichi - Reviews and Feature Writer\n\nEric Ace\n\nEric is a Cubed3 reviewer for the PS3, PS4, 3DS, VITA and PC systems, with a long history of RPG and strategy game backgrounds. He began gaming with the NES and quickly gravitated to RPGs and platform games.\n\nRenan Fontes\n\nAn avid-lover of all things Metal Gear Solid, Devil May Cry, and pretentious French lit, Ren has beaten DMC3 on Dante Must Die at least five times, and is deathly terrified of what series Capcom and Konami are going to target next.Â\n\nHolly Terrington\n\nNikola Suprak\n\nNikola has been writing reviews for games so long that his fifth grade book report of The Giver was actually a review of Conker's Bad Fur day. He failed the assignment but kindled a lifetime passion of telling everyone he saw about which games he liked and didn't liked. He continues to review games as a public service to prevent games like Final Fantasy: All The Bravest from falling into the hands of unsuspecting, innocent people.\n\nHe is a longtime fan of RPGs, FPSs, and other acronym based gaming genres. Some of his favorite games include Lunar: Silver Star Story, Suikoden II, Super Mario Galaxy, and Paper Mario. Outside of gaming, Nikola enjoys writing, basketball, and trying to find a prosecutor willing to charge the developer of The Letter with a crime against humanity. It is harder than you may think.\n\nThom Compton\n\nThom is an avid gamer and has been since playinbg Looney Toon Adventures on some Nintendo system. After spending years playing on the original Playstation, he inexplicably stopped playing games for a long while, eventually picking it back up sometime in 2006. Since then, it's been a constant reminder that he has so finacial control, and someday you may find him with an old Wii controller plugged into a park bench, desperately trying to get the birds and squirrels to bend to his digital prowess.Â\n\nIan Soltes\n\nIan started off as a person who simply loved games and hunting down many of the lesser-known titles to play them. Fascinated with many of the unique aspects of games he became entralled with the many new ideas and concepts he found and outright enjoyed finding unique games. Not to say that he dislikes the mainstream games as he very much enjoys them and can often be found spending time playing Civ V on his free time.\n\nIan wrote several reviews before he started to focus heavily on becoming a constant reviewer as he was more than happy to simply stand by and simply enjoy the games he loved, from 'Dark Cloud 2' to 'Lost Kingdoms II'. The game that changed all this was a small, visual novel, game on Steam called 'Long Live the Queen!'. Having outright enjoyed the game he looked around only to notice that no one had even submitted a review for the game. He decided to change all that and write a review. It didn't take long before he was actively hunting down games in his vast collection, many of which he enjoyed, trying to find those games, be they good or bad, that he felt needed more attention.\n\nAs of Â now Ian is a fan of the JRPG genre and enjoys being able to simply sit down and lose himself in a game. Though a bit of a perfectionist who tries to hunt down every secret if possible, he never lets that get in the way of his enjoyment. However, he has developed a guilty pleasure for intentionally playing BAD games simply for the chance to rip into them in a review.\n\nGareth F - Review & Feature Writer\n\nFiDRoC is a long time gamer old enough to remember the days when the ZX Spectrum was considered to be cutting edge technology and has subsequently held Hungry Horace responsible for his eating disorder.\n\nIn a past life FiDRoCÂ tore it up regularly on the wheels of steel and has toured all over the UK, played at a number of major music festivals and generally made a total racket as the tour DJ for a relatively successful chart bothering band. Besides holding down numerous long running residencies in both Manchester and London he's also had a stint on a pirate radio station (long before internet radio was a thing).\n\nChris Leebody - Review & Feature Writer\n\nChris is a 26 year old English Literature graduate (currently studying masters degree in journalism) from Belfast, United Kingdom. He is a full time training journalist who has been playing video games since he was a small child and has spent the best part of half a life times earnings so far on buying games. He is a particular fan of PC gaming as well as the Playstation and Nintendo platforms and loves playing any Role Playing or RTS game.\n\nLuna Eriksson\n\nAndrew - Reviews and Feature Writer\n\nA Cubed3 member since the ancient days of the GameCube, CheesingÂ It Up has been a Nintendo gamer for many Moons now.Â He's a bit of a nerd (aren't we all?), specialising in astrophysics, and is always ready to answer any questions on the subject. When not stargazing he can often be found watching anime or playing guitar. There's always time for video games though!\n\nDrew Hurley\n\nMatteo Carlarino - Reviews and Feature Writer\n\nJamie Mercer\n\nJamie was first introduced to games through his grandfatherâs love of point-and-click adventure games, and grew up playing the likes of Kyrandia, Flight of the Amazon Queen, Day of the Tentacle, and Monkey Island. A Sega Mega Drive soon followed, and a PlayStation after that. A love of JRPGs developed after first playing Final Fantasy VII. Now he mostly plays indie games on his PC, when time allows.\n\nA qualified broadcast journalist, documentary filmmaker, and voice actor, Jamie tends to not have too much free time these days. When he does, he likes reading, writing, playing pool and snooker, watching documentaries, quiz shows, and awfully made films with sharks in them. He has been told he has the worstÂ taste in music, and is cursed with supporting Newcastle United.\n\nMarcus Myers\n\nIsabella Martinez\n\nSteven Mattern\n\nTom Level\n\nMiss Multi-Console\n\nCubed3 Autobot - C3's Autobot Butler\n\nI am Cubed3 AutoBot. I live to serve the human members of Cubed3 by automating the little things that you can see on this website. When I am not working I enjoy a pint of oil and playing magnets with the lady robots. Bzzzzzzt! LOL\n\nNeil Flynn\n\nLina Elias\n\nAndrew Bond\n\nAvid gamer who grew up in the realms of Sierra and LucasArts. When heÂ realisedÂ heÂ couldn't be a pirate likeÂ GuybrushÂ Threepwood,Â he decided to be aÂ Shatanagger,Â like Gabriel Knight.\n\nExpanding his gaming across Nintendo, Sega, Xbox and PlayStation, he has a love for anything RPG and Point and Click He likes nothing more than games that can immerse you in a different worlds with wicked dialogue and provoking storylines.\n\nHe recently lost several weeks revisiting pixelated classics from the '90s and can be seen in his daily life wandering aimlessly, muttering to himself that he could have been a contender but nobody knows of what!\n\nRudy Lavaux - Review and Feature Writer\n\nHaving some previous experience writing absurdly long reviews for some French website, Rudy gladly joined the ranks of C3 to share his love for video games... which equals his love for writing about them. Despite first experiencing video games on a SEGA arcade machine, and developing his skills at home on his parents' Commodore 64 and Atari 2600, he fell in love with Nintendo after trying Metroid for the NES back in the day. He's always bought Nintendo's consoles first since the days of the Game Boy and Super Nintendo, only occasionally buying another brand to taste the great exclusives that the competition offered (rumour has it that he first cheated on Nintendo with a PC-Engine in his early gaming days). He's such a manic collector that he can't beat his games as fast as he buys them. He can't stand missing a single game in his favourite series. He's also a bit of a MacGyver, always coming up with the most improbable ways to fix up his broken stuff... and managing to do so. As a Belgian, he also enjoys good beer, chocolate, mussels, chips and making fun of politics. Oh, and reporting C3 bugs to Jorge!\n\nShane Jury - Reviews and Feature Writer\n\nShane happened upon this fair community of Cubed3 whilst browsing the newly-opened portal of the World Wide Web, and has stuck around ever since. Kicking things off with a Master System, Shane soon went for the best of both worlds with a Mega Drive and a Super Nintendo. Every generation since he's been on the Nintendo bandwagon, together with an occasional hop on the Sony and Microsoft wagons, with a broad perspective and a willingness to try anything. A fan of many titles and franchises, including Pokemon, Mario, Final Fantasy, The Legend of Zelda, Viewtiful Joe and, most of all, Sonic, you'll see Shane in any thread with one of these franchises in the title, when he isn't slapping up news posts or tapping away at another review.\n\nWes Maulsby\n\nDavid Lovato - Reviews and Feature Writer\n\nBorn in California, David spent his youth moving around the country, but never lost his love of writing and video games. A lifelong Nintendo fan, David believes a great game can come from anywhere, and is always on the hunt for the next one.\n\nMichael McCann\n\nJoshua Goldie\n\nLex Firth - Reviews and Feature Writer\n\nBrandon (Michael) Howard\n\nJosh Di Falco\n\nWilliam Lowery\n\nCamilo ArÃ¡nguiz GonzÃ¡lez\n\nGreg Giddens\n\nGreg has a strong passion for technology and prides himself on his knowledge and understanding of old, current and emerging gadgetry.Â Having spent several years trying to find the perfect fit for where he wanted to build a career, he became a videogames journalist, writing about and critiquing games for various places.\n\nTJ\n\nIan Goldberg\n\nBonny Ramsay\n\nPaul McEnery\n\nKevin Tsai\n\nDaniel Rivas\n\nScott Casey\n\nBen Clarke\n\nKatie Livingston\n\nMikey Entwistle\n\nJuan Minoprio\n\nJenny Geist\n\nJenny is a long time gamer and writer who is putting these skills together for her Cubed3 reviews. She follows the whole industry but has a special place in her heart for the works of Nintendo and Square Enix, with her favorite game of all time being NieR: Automata. Video games can create stories that no other medium can fully replicate, making games something truly special to explore and write about.\n\nJess Thomas\n\nSam Rogers\n\nUrsus\n\nLeslie C\n\nJames Grech\n\nHarley\n\nCharles Britton\n\nContributors Past & Present\n\nMike Mason, James Temperton, Ross Marrs, Peter Willington, Sam Turner, Mark Heery, Keza Macdonald, Ben Southam, John Boyle, Lee Sanders, Joe Brukner, Joel Burton, Reece Warrender, Barry Lewis, Phil Beveridge, Rob, Craig Shipton, Fraser Wilson, Nick Cheesman, Rory Renehan, John Michael Baker, Reece Warrender, Joe Clifton, Jack Hubbert, Dave Beasley, Rob Forster, Joshua Terry, Scott James, Alexi Messeramo, Jonathan Davis, William Scothern, Charles Leake\n\nBusiness/Contact Address"
