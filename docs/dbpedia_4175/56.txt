Devil May Cry 4 is an action-adventure hack-and-slash video game developed by Capcom and released in 2008 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows platforms. The fourth installment of the Devil May Cry series, it is set several years after the events of Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening. Players control both Nero, a new character, and Dante as they fight enemies in close combat using firearms, swords, and other weapons.

Devil May Cry 4 features a combination of mission-based gameplay similar to that found in earlier installments with some open-world exploration elements. It also introduces "Style Points" which are earned from completing certain actions during battle such as chaining attacks together or using multiple weapons simultaneously. When enough points are accumulated the player can enter "Devil Trigger", a state where their attack power increases significantly while health regeneration kicks in at a faster rate than normal.

The story follows Dante’s journey to confront his brother Vergil who has taken over Fortuna Castle with his demon army called “The Order”; meanwhile, Nero must protect Kyrie from being sacrificed by The Order’s leader Sanctus Diabolica—an antagonist revealed, later on, to be manipulating events behind the scene.
