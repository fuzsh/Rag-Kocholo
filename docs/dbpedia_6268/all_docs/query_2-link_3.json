        "text": "You said no serious researcher would say Cruyff was better than Di Stefano, and Cruyff is not in your list of seriously researched players though mate.\n\nIt just seemed like you were trying to say \"many casuals might think Cruyff was better, but the real historians know that it is a fact that Di Stefano was and not even up for debate\" which seems a bit off to me. I don't want to make it seems like I can make the call on what's a valid comment or not though, and maybe sometimes it's just easy to end up commenting on too many things (and I get annoyed at myself for randomly involving myself in arguments sometimes to be honest!). But the comment just didn't sit right with me, or to be honest seem reasonable or balanced (at the least I didn't understand the rationale behind it - not to insist there was no rationale, as opposed to just 'bias', in your mind though).\n\nI'm not sure if this guy who made this (an early Youtube best ever players compilation) would qualify as a historian as such, but I seem to recall he might be a Real Madrid fan, and he's at least a football history enthusiast (maybe that's what I'd call myself now if anything too for example, not truly a 'football historian') and also (like Matthews) placed Cruyff above everybody:\n\nThis guy does put Di Stefano ahead, but he talks about Cruyff like he feels he also belongs in a top 5 players of all-time (at first, some people might say wrongly, I was feeling like I disagreed a bit about the idea the more recent is always better in literal terms - I feel like myself that comparing intrinsic football qualities is more like comparing the level and speed of Formula 1 drivers, as opposed to the quality and efficiency of Formula 1 cars which tends to evolve forwards over the years of course...while it's impossible to 'prove' but I feel pretty sure that a prime Ayrton Senna would be driving faster/better than a Lance Stroll or Logan Sargeant in the same car right now, maybe even better/faster than a Max Verstappen or a Lewis Hamilton from a few years ago, which allows for any possible age-related decline he has had....but it's true that especially comparing to Verstappen and Hamilton it becomes much more guesswork I suppose as like Senna they'd be in the category of close to maximising car potential with their driving - anyway when Julio Maldonado i.e 'Maldini' mentions near the end of the video \"because physically....and with everything modern players have Cruyff would immediately be able to be a top 3 player right now\" (not these exact words but in effect that's what he is saying) then it seems like there is less disagreement or different perspective than I might have thought originally between me and him)\n\nI just find it hard to believe any football historian can be so certain that Di Stefano was better than Cruyff (if you feel that on a 'career basis' he really should be considered so, as opposed to prime form, then I guess Di Stefano's early career where he seemed to take while to develop into a complete player, is also relevant, so whichever it's looked at it seems a viable comparison at the least to me, but it seemed like you were framing it as if it was a no-brainer that of course Di Stefano was better/greater and if anyone did enough 'true research' even though with limited footage then they would come to the same conclusion...so hey you should all in effect \"take my word for it\" - that's how the end of your post read to me).\n\ni think so JOhan Cruyff and Alfredo Di Stefano\n\nthey are tied in the History of Football.. I saw several entire games both of them really have a lot of similarities !\n\n....................\n\nBut if we all had access... to Di Stefano's games in Millionarios from Colombia, Di Stefano would certainly be an even more artistic and genius player than Johan Cruyff...\n\nYou are downright malicious when you think it was by 1972 the 25th best league in the world. You have exposed yourself badly.\n\nAs such, I cannot take the rest of your (also inane) posts seriously. I know you are a Hungarian fanboy. It is not worth my time to dissect that very very long post of yours.\n\nThat is even not nearly the case today. Also today it is not nearly the 25th best league in the world (with now of course USA etc. entering the mix). 6th in the coefficients with 70+% of the playing minutes for Dutch players (add Belgians as Lukebakio and it becomes even nicer). In 1974 and 1978 they were almost all playing in Netherlands itself.\n\nToday:\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5422007/2024/04/20/europe-top-five-leagues-best/\n\nLet alone in 1972 and in 1980 (despite a forced downgrade in 1973, back to levels of Greece and Sweden - of course the masses and rival fans provide cover, to which you also belong). Then when he returned to the Eredivisie it was 3rd in the coefficients, 4th in 1981, and AZ Alkmaar had just reached the UEFA Cup final (Maradona fans insist this is the strongest competition).\n\n3rd in 1982:\n\nhttps://kassiesa.net/uefa/data/method1/crank1982.html\n\nIn 1964, then yes, it was not close to great but that it became great was for a part because of Cruijff and the leap to professionalism; look at his record against the strong teams (incl. club friendlies) until 1970; in 1969 reaching the EC final with 6 goals and 6 assists (penalty won against the mean AC Milan defense) as only recognized quality player; the results before and after him, or without him, speak for itself. Where was Ajax just before Michels and Cruijff? Close to the relegation zone. With various 5th and 6th places the years before.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough what idiocy it is to think it was the 25th best league in 1972. If that is the case, those Eredivisie players don't reach a World Cup final in 1978, with about 10-20 of the best players not going.\n\nOnce again, it is a legit view to think the 12th or 15th best team couldn't compare to the First Division. But what I also said: only Van Basten could score six goals (not Ronaldo, not Romario, not Suarez, not Ibrahimovic etc.). And it is \"silly\", which I also said, to judge Mbappe or Cruijff by rilling four past Bastia or RKC Waalwijk. That is not how a I look at players. In no way.\n\nI'm not really getting what the argument is about though.\n\nSurely not that Cruyff couldn't play very well and/or have end product against high-rated teams?\n\nSomone on X: \"Cruyff vs Liverpool EC 66/67-both legs 3 goals(1st,5th,6th goals) 1 assist(3rd goal) 1 rebond assist(2nd goal) 1 free kick won led to a goal(4th goal) Involved in 6 goals out of 7 goals vs one of the top 5 best teams in the world according to ELO rating, in counter attack system https://t.co/DsIot8QAmz\" / X\n\nIf it's about the goals/assist tallies then Trachta's work does allow for the level of opposition (and if anything it'd less likely players get high contribution rates in high scoring teams as discussed), and although Cruyff is not among the players with the highest %s neither is Di Stefano (if the stats used are correct) is he? Via that top video for Cruyff vs Poland is a quote by Lato of Poland:\n\n\"Grzegorz Lato: Right, Johan was better for me than Pele and Beckenbauer - says the former star of the Polish national team and former PZPN president Grzegorz Lato (66), who at the same World Cup as Cruyff won third place with Poland and became the top scorer (7 goals). \"Super Express\": - Cruyff was said to be ahead of its time. What was its uniqueness? Grzegorz Lato: - He was a genius. He had some sixth or seventh sense. On the pitch, he usually chose the best and most unexpected solutions. Left, right leg, shot. He not only played the game, but also worked in defense if necessary. For me, he is the best footballer of the 60s and 70s. Not Pele. The Brazilian was a typical goalscorer. He got the ball, he scored it. But Cruyff was the heart and brain of the Netherlands.\"\n\nMaybe harsh on Pele (let's not forget who won the France Football Player of the Century vote among Ballon d'Or winners too....it was Pele), but huge praise for Cruyff.\n\nPaul van Himst did put Pele on top, and Di Stefano ahead of Cruyff, but basically with them all in a top 3 in his view (in effect in a similar bracket I suppose) and if you took his word on Di Stefano>Cruyff as gospel then you'd also have to take his word on Cruyff>Maradona of course (before even getting to Messi....)\n\nhttps://www.bigsoccer.com/threads/f...o-voted-for-who.1597402/page-10#post-38727300\n\nI just don't feel like it's clear that Di Stefano should be regarded as better than Cruyff as a 'historical fact', but maybe I'm wrong. On what I saw I'd put Cruyff ahead I think, although maybe I seem to contradict myself if I estimated (and estimated is right really - it's hard to compare top performances and definitively say one is better I think) a rating for Di Stefano's 1960 European Cup Final performance above the estimated rating I gave for any Cruyff performance I saw (not even being sure it was Di Stefano's best European Cup Final performance due to not being able to see others in full of course). With another Formula 1 analogy though lol - this time the concept of a qualifying lap and different sectors where a driver can be quickest on all 3 sectors on different laps but not quickest with his quickest overall single lap, maybe I'd see it more like if Cruyff put everything together in one match (all the best playing qualities he displayed at various times, some of his highest quality goals/assists etc) I'd potentially think of him as having a higher performance level (not saying it's wrong to think otherwise necessarily though by any means).\n\nYeah. I don't think putting ADS right there is a wrong opinion - as said I was once tempted for #1 - but I also think a) both had similar levels of success (qualifying with the NT for a World Cup indeed counts for something, in particular if you are playing with Argentina or Spain, alongside Gento, Kubala etc as someone already mentioned), with the EC of the 1950s not the same as of the 1970s (I die on that hill). b) Cruijff was by far, and very obviously, the more influential of the two for the team results. It is really very clear for me. I don't see how this is not obvious, just looking at the facts and statistics.\n\nUltimately, it is hard to compare. Footballers in the 1970s had twice the distance covered as in the late 1950s. They ran twice as more. Part of ADS supremacy is that he ran a bit more than the others; with Real Madrid and ADS ahead of their time, the Real Madrid facility was way better than the rest (with money as backing). Puskas I believe entered the club as an immobile, non-Spanish or poor-Spanish speaker, with the club already bent to the Spanish-Argentine section. When reading newspaper reports, in an unfree country, one has to keep that in mind. The beat reporters have also their relations with the club and certain players.\n\nThe 1970s was very arguably the most violent decade. See the other thread (with facts on the most severe fouls! The category 4 fouls.).\n\nhttps://www.bigsoccer.com/threads/w...layer-ever-at-his-peak.2130241/#post-42297615\n\nI think ADS was as much Gerrard as Cruijff. By that I mean Cruijff truly played different positions while ADS was more all action. Maybe like Gullit in 1987-88, in that particular Milan team, indeed. Gullit was in the top 3 for distance covered IIRC.\n\nNice Lato quote! I would not agree with the conclusion but the reasoning is pretty sound.\n\nBeckenbauer in 2004: Pelé number one, Johan number two. \"Johan is the best gift that has ever been given to Europe\" - \"I'd say he was the more important one [than me]\".\n\nYeah, I suppose Gerrard's midfield positions did vary (from anchor midfielder like vs Germany in 2001 to outright attacking midfielder by 2007/08) but I understand what you're meaning. I think the extent to which Di Stefano at Real Madrid dropped deep as opposed to playing more akin to an outright attacker may have varied a bit if I understand correctly (Puskas also advised him to play more akin to a Hidegkuti, and drop back less i.e become less all action, I think I read too), but in essence he was a free roaming 'centre forward' most of the time I suppose.\n\nI don't want to fall out with Trachta anyway (hopefully I contributed something to this thread a little re: Platini at one point, Laudrup later for example, and if Trachta didn't do a full original-method Laudrup season by season table for me/everyone to see in return, for Spanish team seasons, I guess it can just be to do with enthusiasm level and/or he'd already change his presentation method, so I'll try not to hold that against him too!). But I already explained I felt \"hang on no legitimate historian can rate Cruyff over Di Stefano, where is that coming from?\" in effect....\n\nI guess the word I was looking for re: some of Carlito's posts was provocative (he maybe enjoys being provocative, attacking various players with worst moments, worst perspectives etc....except Cristinao Ronaldo of course so no presentation of the l'Equipe CL Final grades for example...and if for some of those it could be suggested he wasn't fully fit I would also say to him and CristianoPuskas etc that Cruyff might well not have been fully fit in some of the performances they looked at and found less impressive...as he was known to have some physical issues I know). And maybe I saw that statement by Trachta as provocative too - but maybe rather than coming from even undeliberate/automatic pro-Argentina bias it can be just that it was a bit hasty and presented a bit too definitively almost like 'obvious historical fact' the way it read to me (like I already tried to explain earlier too lol).\n\nJust to add, when Pelé died he voiced the same sort of thing. Like Matthews I think he has been pretty consistent in his assessment and views.\n\nhttps://www.bigsoccer.com/threads/f...r-best-players-g-o-a-t.2124069/#post-41091675\n\nThat page you link to has also some other nice stuff I see and remember now. Including Maradona on Rijkaard in 1993; Romario full of praise for the football/players in Holland etc. (saying on Brazil TV a few years ago that the shown all-time XI is wrong and Van Basten needs to be in). Cruijff in 1984 about a number of great players, including Pelé, Platini.\n\nI think Wiliam is a bit harsh on Ronaldo Fenomeno (and also Ronaldinho I'd say but I'd agree he is sometimes overrated a bit, especially his effectiveness and importance for Barcelona - you can think Brazil born Deco was just as important or more crucial for that team) but I guess everyone has its favorites and I'd agree Garrincha cannot be a top 20 player but is more like top 50 or top 100. Think it is hard to see someone like Figo, Hazard or Robben as categorically worse than him, a tier lower. If Garrincha was Dutch, I'd put him in the tier with Gullit etc. Ronaldo Fenomeno I do rate highly yes. edit: Ronaldo is tier 2 in my estimation. Gullit, Garrincha, Rijkaard, Hazard etc. tier 3 (imho)\n\nHere another Romario one of 1993 (not in that link but there is something else):\n\nAround the 20:00 mark he says. \"I find Holland fantastic when it comes to education for children. I would wish Brazil has 20% of the things you have here.\"\n\nOn 34:00 the interviewer says: \"In tennis you have a world ranking right? If football was tennis, on which place do you put yourself?\" Romario: \"The whole world? I think I am around 9th or 10th.\" Interviewer: \"Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Who are they?\"\n\nRomario: \"Van Basten one. Rijkaard two. Bebeto three. Four... Baggio. Five Bergkamp. Six Matthäus. And seventh.... pffff... I think you can place me seventh.\"\n\nNot bad for a crap league, huh? 25th best in the world. Are you kidding me?\n\nYes, I guess the Romario assessment can also indicate team-mate bias if we call it that (probably there's a better way to put it, as it's more to do with exposure to performances I suppose), given he didn't mention Michael Laudrup at all, then played in the same team and had him tied 4th in a later quote (all-time), with Zidane (I think he named Pele, Maradona and himself above at that point too didn't he IIRC from seeing the quote elsewhere before...which showed he raised his own self-evaluation quite a bit too of course, after putting himself behind Van Basten, Rijkaard, Brazil team-mate Bebeto etc etc at that stage - not that he can't have really felt he improved as a player or had more to show career-wise at that later point which I guess is late 90s at least or later, since he mentions Zidane):\n\nQuotes on: Michael Laudrup – Wet grass, white posts, bulging nets, and ignited passions (wordpress.com)\n\nAlthough he was a team-mate of Ronaldo Nazario to great effect, and not Zidane, so it's not the be all and end all for these things.\n\nAbout Ronaldinho Gaucho, I'm not talking about him. His goal average speaks for itself. Average assists..from him ( Ronaldinho Gaucho). is that he is speaking for himself, his performances in decisive and final games ( behaviour). Again I'm not making anything up.\n\nin total, Ronaldinho Gaucho has 796 complete matches for the senior teams (299 goals) and a further + 10 matches in the 2000 and 2010 Olympics final stage under-23 competition.. plus + 3 professional players or over 24 years of age.. will be able to to be included in the final phase of the Olympics, then there will be another 10 complete games at the Olympics with 3 goals 2000 and 2008.\n\nso.. Ronaldinho Gaucho\n\n806 matches... 302 goals... goal average of 0. 37,05%\n\nI'm not making up the numbers you can verify this ...\n\nat Transfers Markt as I said before for you ... they also put penalties suffered as assists and pre-assists as assists for him strangely... indirect assists too okay in this part;. and direct assists of course...it is normal to count this .\n\n806 matches... 232 assists... in quotes... adding up... or having an average of assists. 0. 28%.... We know there is some penalties suffered involved in this counting at TransferMarkt.\n\n.............\n\nListen ...\n\nagain and again\n\nRonaldinho.... 27 matches in Finals ..... 6 goals .... 5 assists and 1 pre-assist ( 1*)\n\naverage of participation in finals... 0 . 44 % if Including one more ( 1* ) .. 0. 48 %\n\nthe real performances from him in finals ... in average was this .. for me low numbers ....\n\nthat's for sure . !\n\nI created one new Thread of Super Ballon D'Or ... if you wish to participate this ... you can do this to talk to me always about this topic ...\n\nwould like to propose to all of you guys the creation of the Super Ballon D'or of all time Popular .\n\nMain voting criterias to choose the Top 5 of all time, we will need to comply with some extremely necessary rules .\n\nMain Rules :\n\nin the Top 5 we will need to include at least one defender, 2 midfielders and 2 attackers .

But if you remove those nations Netherlands is still far behind the likes of Germany, England, Italy etc... Again I used 3 different sources which each of them indicates Eredivisie wasn't a top 10 league during Cruyff's absolute peak.\n\nToday's ranking is the same case as before, it's only the top teams that are shown, you can for example check today's elos (http://clubelo.com/NED) and you can see how PSV, Feyenoord Twente and Ajax are the only teams with high elo. The rest downgrades heavily. It's a big fallacy to judge the level of the league by the performances of the top 4-5 teams only. Either way the fact Netherlands reached few World Cup finals doesn't matter because in those World Cups most players were either playing abroad or in the 'big 4' of Netherlands. In 1974, none of the players selected were playing in Netherlands outside PSV, Ajax, Twente and Feyenoord, literally none. Even Brazil in the 1950s with the supremacy of the likes of Santos had players from other Paulista teams. In 1978, the number of players outside the top 4 was of 4, and only one of them was in the XI for the final. You're acting like Netherlands had a golden generation during Cruyff's peak when in fact, they didn't even qualify for the 1970 World Cup, 3 years after Cruyff's peak. During Cruyff's peak, in 1967, Netherlands was ranked 32nd on elo rankings (https://www.eloratings.net/1967), according to your own logic that essentially means the league was especially bad.\n\nWe don't care at all about Netherlands' ranking in the 1980s because that's long after Cruyff's peak, in fact that would prove that Cruyff was indeed a statpadder or atleast relied on the level of the league as his stats went downhill after leaving Ajax:\n\nAgain by using UEFA rankings you legitimately validate that Cruyff didn't play in a top 10 leagues in Europe during his peak, which just proves you wrong on the whole argument. His record in European competitions especially in goalscoring was literally much worse than in the league so what's your point? I'm not saying Cruyff was a bad player, he's obviously an all-time great and top 10 players of all time but saying he played in a strong league during his peak is just false. Ajax was the only team to have good records in Europe, along Feyenoord (who had a really easy run), and every dutch teams before 1968 were literally banters in Europe. In 1966, the 3 teams lost in the first round (7-0 to Celtic ), in 1967 Ajax lost in the QF to a Czech team, DWS lost in the first round 8-2 to Leeds, Rotterdam and DOS lost in the second rounds to Servette and West Brom. In 1968, they all lost in the first round except for NAC who lost in the second round to Cardiff after facing a Maltese team in the first team. Mind that these teams were part of the best teams in Netherlands, in what does do those teams constitute a good league? In 1968/69 apart from Ajax, 2 teams lost in the first round (against mid table team of EPL and an Irish team, another lost in the 2nd round 4-0 against Köln and Twente lost in the 3rd round vs a team that was fighting for maintain in Ligue 1. You're just trying to keep a standard here, Ajax was far from fighting from relegation, the only season they did so was in 1964/65 (when Cruyff started ), otherway they were a major team in the Netherlands :\n\nYou can also check their results after Cruyff left, they were still a major team:\n\nAnd after Cruyff retired :\n\nYou're saying they got better in 1965 because of Cruyff, when Ajax also signed Henk Groot and Gert Bals for example.\n\nStop being downright arrogant when this is not even a personal ranking, it's a sourced ranking who I myself nuanced. Just because one ranking seems dodgy doesn't mean the other ones are unvalidate, you still ignore the clubelo rating that's much more precise and who placed Eredivisie as the 20th league in Europe right before Cruyff played his first professional game. And again this argument is fallacious as you're only looking at the quality of the top 4 teams, since most players in the national team come from those teams.\n\nYou can blame them because that's your own words, you yourself said the 12th teams and downwards are \"doubtful\" and Cruyff literally scored half of his league goals against them during his prime. He scored half of his goals against the doubtful teams of a mediocre league.\n\nYou completely ignored everything mandem, that's just embarrassing. The only times Dutch teams apart from Ajax did good in Europe, they faced really easy opponents. Imagine a team going to the final of the Europa league after facing a Gibraltarian team, PAOK Thelassoniki, Zalgiris Vilnius, Sparta Praha, CSKA Sofia and Chelsea in the final. And you also ignore the fact that the best goalscorers in Eredivisie at that time had their stats being almost halved in other European leagues.\n\nCruyff scored 6 goals vs AZ'67 in 1970/71, who finished 17th, so what's your point?"
