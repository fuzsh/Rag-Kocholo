        "text": "\"Justice Matthews\" redirects here. For other uses, see Justice Matthews (disambiguation).\n\nThomas Stanley Matthews (July 21, 1824 – March 22, 1889), known as Stanley Matthews in adulthood,[1] was an American attorney, soldier, judge and Republican senator from Ohio who became an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, serving from May 1881 to his death in 1889. Matthews was the Court's 46th justice, appointed by President James A. Garfield.\n\nEarly life and education[]\n\nMatthews was born July 21, 1824, in Cincinnati, Ohio.[lower-alpha 1] He was the oldest of 11 children born to Thomas J. Matthews and Isabella Brown Matthews (his second wife).[1]\n\nHe graduated from Kenyon College in 1840. While there he met future-president of the United States Rutherford B. Hayes. Then, after briefly studying law in Cincinnati, he moved to Columbia, Tennessee, where he practiced law and edited the local newspaper. Matthews returned to Cincinnati in 1844, and was admitted to the bar the following year.[1]\n\nEarly legal career[]\n\nMatthews was selected to serve as the clerk of the Ohio House of Representatives in 1848, and afterward served as a county judge in Hamilton County, Ohio. He was then elected to the Ohio State Senate for the 1st district, where he served from 1856 to 1858. He was then appointed as United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, serving from 1858 to 1861.\n\nUnion officer[]\n\nMatthews resigned as U.S. Attorney as the Civil War began, accepting a commission as lieutenant colonel with the 23rd Ohio Infantry regiment of the Union Army. His superior officer was Rutherford B. Hayes; future President William McKinley also served in the regiment. With the 23rd Ohio Regiment, Matthews fought at the battle of Carnifex Ferry. On October 26, 1861 he was appointed colonel of the 51st Ohio Infantry Regiment. and on April 11, 1862 he was nominated as brigadier general of U.S. Volunteers. However, the nomination was tabled and never confirmed. Nevertheless, Colonel Matthews commanded a brigade in the Army of the Ohio and later the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nState judge, lawyer and politician[]\n\nIn 1863, after being elected a judge of Superior Court of Cincinnati, Matthews resigned from the Union Army. Two years later, he returned to private practice. During the post-war reconstruction era, Matthews represented the railroad industry. His clients included Jay Gould.[3]\n\nHe ran for the United States House of Representatives in 1876, but was defeated. Then, in early 1877, he represented Rutherford B. Hayes before the electoral commission that Congress created to resolve the disputed 1876 presidential election.[3] That same year Matthews won a special election to the Senate to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of John Sherman. He did not seek reelection.\n\nAssociate justice[]\n\nPresident Hayes first nominated Matthews as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court on January 26, 1881,[4] in the last weeks of Hayes's presidency. The nomination ran into opposition in the U.S. Senate because of Matthews's close ties to railroad interests and due to his close long-term friendship with Hayes. Consequently, the Judiciary Committee took no action on the nomination during the remainder of the 46th Congress.[5][6] Upon succeeding Hayes, President James A. Garfield swiftly re-nominated Matthews to the Court – March 14, 1881, just 10 days after taking office.[4] Though a new nomination from a new president, earlier concerns about Matthews's suitability for the Court persisted, and Garfield was widely criticized for re-submitting Matthews's name.[5] In spite of the opposition, and, although the Judiciary Committee made a recommendation to the Senate that it reject the nomination,[7] on May 12, the Senate voted 24–23 to confirm Matthews. The vote was the closest for any successful Supreme Court nominee in U.S. Senate history;[lower-alpha 2] no other justice has been confirmed by a single vote.[4][6][8]\n\nMatthews's tenure as a member of the Supreme Court on May began 17, 1881, when he took the judicial oath, and ended March 22, 1889, upon his death.[9][3] He was regarded as one of the more progressive justices on the Court at the time.[8]\n\nYick Wo v. Hopkins[]\n\nIn 1880, the elected officials of city of San Francisco, California thought they had a clever way to deal with the Chinese in the city. They passed an ordinance that persons could not operate a laundry in a wooden building without a permit from the Board of Supervisors. The ordinance conferred upon the Board of Supervisors the discretion to grant or withhold the permits. At the time, about 95% of the city's 320 laundries were operated in wooden buildings. Approximately two-thirds of those laundries were owned by Chinese persons. Although most of the city's wooden building laundry owners applied for a permit, none were granted to any Chinese owner, while virtually all non-Chinese applicants were granted a permit. Yick Wo (益和, Pinyin: Yì Hé, Americanization: Lee Yick), who had lived in California and had operated a laundry in the same wooden building for many years and held a valid license to operate his laundry issued by the Board of Fire-Wardens, continued to operate his laundry and was convicted and fined $10.00 for violating the ordinance. He sued for a writ of habeas corpus after he was imprisoned in default for having refused to pay the fine.\n\nThe Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Matthews, found that the administration of the statute in question was discriminatory and that there was therefore no need to even consider whether the ordinance itself was lawful. Even though the Chinese laundry owners were usually not American citizens, the court ruled they were still entitled to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Matthews also noted that the court had previously ruled that it was acceptable to hold administrators of the law liable when they abused their authority. He denounced the law as a blatant attempt to exclude Chinese from the laundry trade in San Francisco, and the court struck down the law, ordering dismissal of all charges against other laundry owners who had been jailed.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nIn 1843, Matthews married Mary Ann \"Minnie\" Black. They had 10 children, four of whom died during an outbreak of scarlet fever in 1859.[1] One surviving son, Paul Clement, was bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey from 1915 to 1937. His son, Justice Matthews's grandson, Thomas Stanley, was editor of Time magazine from 1949 to 1953.[10][11] His devout daughter Eva Lee Matthews became a schoolteacher and monastic, founding the Community of the Transfiguration, which engaged in charity work in Ohio, Hawaii and in China, leading to her liturgical commemoration in the Episcopal Church.[12]\n\nDeath and legacy[]\n\nMatthews' health declined precipitously during 1888; he died in Washington D.C. on March 22, 1889.[13][14] He is interred at Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio.[15][16]\n\nA collection of Justice Matthews's correspondence and other papers are located at the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center library in Fremont, Ohio and open for research.
