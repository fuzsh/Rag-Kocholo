        "text": "Stanley Matthews, who has died aged 85, was the first ever European Footballer of the Year, and arguably the outstanding British player of his generation. He was nicknamed the Wizard of Dribble in Britain, and known abroad as Der Zauberer - the magician.\n\nHis remarkable career stretched from well before the second world war to the 1960s; he was still playing League football at 50. At 41, at Wembley, he was capable of demolishing as famous a left back as Brazil's Milton Santos. Afterwards, in the England dressing room, in a rare moment of spleen, he said that when he read that he was too old he was sometimes tempted to tear the paper across.\n\nBut the truth is that throughout his magical career, Matthews was constantly being accused of being too this, that or the other. Too unpredictable. Too individualistic. Too slow to release the ball. In one wartime Wembley international at Wembley there was a small scandal when it was alleged that he had deliberately been starved of the ball. At the end of the war, when football officially restarted, he was excluded from the England team for most of the 1946/7 season in favour of Tom Finney, an outside right with almost as remarkable a body swerve. Only to return in triumph in Lisbon, Matthews on the right, Finney on he left, Portugal routed, 10-0.\n\nAs early as November, 1934, when England won the bruising Battle of Highbury against an Italian team which ran amok when its Argentine captain, Luisito Monti, limped early off the field with a broken foot, Matthews was damned in the Daily Mail. Geoffrey Simpson, its sports columnist, wrote: \"I saw Matthews play just as moderately in the recent inter-League match, exhibiting the same slowness and hesitation. Perhaps he lacks the big match temperament.\"\n\nMatthews was born at Hanley in the Potteries, the son of a formidable boxer Jack Matthews, a formidable boxer known as \"the Fighting Barber of Hanley\". Jack encouraged Matthews and his other children to keep physically fit, doing deep breathing exercises in front of an open window even on the coldest mornings. In later years, Matthews would devise his own regimes based on long runs across the Blackpool beaches. It used to be said that if you passed his house at 9pm, the lights of his bedroom would be out.\n\nHis swerve was something which defied analysis; just as it defied attempts to counter it. He would take the ball up to the opposing left back who, even if he were mentally prepared for it, would still \"buy\" the dummy when Matthews swayed slightly to the left, putting the opponent off balance, only to wriggle round to the right, flick the ball up the touchline with the outside of his right foot, and sprint away. Catch him if you could. Over those vital first ten yards or so, he was beyond pursuit. \"Don't ask me how I do it,\" he once said of the swerve. \"It just comes out of me under pressure.\"\n\nHaving sped past his left back and reached the goal line, Matthews would then pull the ball back into the goalmouth; the most effective pass in the game. He seldom scored himself, but he could do so when necessary. Not least when playing at Tottenham for England against Czechoslovakia in 1937. Injury reduced England to 10 fit men, and their unbeaten home record against foreign teams seemed in jeopardy. But Matthews, moving to inside-right, scored three times, and England won, 5-4.\n\nMuch later, in the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, when England were struggling in their opening game against Belgium, Matthews moved to inside-forward, galvanised the team, and helped it to gain a 4-4 draw. Over the years he would time and again fall foul of the England selectors, troubled by so maverick a talent. It is true that he began badly, a 19-year-old, in his first two internationals against Wales and Italy but it wasn't long before the \"big match temperament\" was asserting itself.\n\nIn May 1939, in the Berlin Olympic Stadium, he had one of his finest games for England just when they needed it most. Forced to give the Nazi salute before they played the German international side, England proceeded to cut them to ribbons, with Matthews rampant, irresistible against a full back who had played him out of the game when last the teams met. Muenzenberg could do nothing with him that day and England won, 6-3.\n\nAn outstanding schoolboy footballer, he once scored a dozen goals in a game from centre-half. He played for England schoolboys, joined his local club Stoke City straight from school, worked in the office, and made his league debut for them soon after he had turned 17. But even before the war, his relations with the club degenerated with the appointment as manager of Bob McGrory, a former Stoke defender. It has been suggested that McGrory was displeased by the fact that Matthews had replaced his friend, Bobby Liddle, on the right wing. Relations didn't improve when Matthews returned to Stoke after the second world war.\n\nDuring the war, he had played as a guest for Blackpool, a town where he and his wife, Jean, had opened a small hotel. Things came to a climax early in the 1946/7 season when Matthews was kept out of the Stoke team by the young winger, George Mountford. Eventually Stoke agreed to transfer him to Blackpool, for the sum of Â£11,500. Matthews would stay there happily, forming famous wing partnerships with Stan Mortensen and Jackie Mudie, until his romantic and belated return to Stoke, in 1961.\n\nThe war ate up much of his \"official\" career, but he found an ideal partner in the England team in Sunderland's Raich Carter, even though Carter once complained that when he gave Matthews the ball, he never got it back. Tactfully, his captain, Stanley Cullis, responded that having passed he should move into the middle. The England attack, which included Tommy Lawton and Denis Compton, was an outstanding one, with an 8-0 win over Scotland at Maine Road, Manchester, to its credit.\n\nLosing then regaining his place in the England team in the first official post war season, 1946/7, Matthews excelled in Lisbon against Portugal and, a year later, in Turin, reduced poor, blond Eliani - standing in as Italy's left back for Maroso - to tatters. England won 4-0.\n\nBut when it came to Cup Finals, a winner's medal persistently eluded Matthews. In the 1948 Final, Blackpool lost 4-2 to Manchester United, despite taking the lead through a penalty kick by Eddie Shimwell. In 1951, two spectacular goals by Jackie Milburn enabled Newcastle United to win, 2-0. 1953 would almost surely be the last chance. Blackpool were to meet Bolton, and this time, luck favoured them when Bell, left-half - and thus a direct opponent for Matthews - was hurt and had to limp along the left wing.\n\nEven then, Blackpool made very heavy weather of it. They conceded an absurd early goal when their Scottish international keeper, George Farm, pitifully misjudged a shot by Nat Lofthouse after a mere 75 seconds. Lofthouse hit the post, Bell tore a muscle and Bolton were already down to ten active men. Stan Mortensen would later say that Bolton lost the game when they decided to move their English international left winger Bobby Langton inside, rather than let him contest space with Matthews, on the wing. Blackpool's equaliser, 10 minutes from the break, was a fluke, the ball going in off their emergency left-half, Harold Hassall. But Bolton gallantly hit back with two goals, one by Moir, with Farm at fault again, the second a brave header by Bell himself. There were only 20 minutes left.\n\nIt was now that Matthews, strangely obscure till then, at last came into the game. Tommy Banks, Bolton's left back, was exhausted by his efforts to halt Matthews, contracting cramp in his shins, and four times leaving the field for treatment in the final quarter hour. One more Matthews run, a cross which would have gone out of play had Hanson, Bolton's keeper, not flapped at it, reached Mortensen on the far post and went in. 3-2. Mortensen equalised breathlessly from a free kick.\n\nThen clasically, Matthews got away again on the right, beat Banks, took the ball up to the centre half, Barrass, and pulled back an exquisite cross not to Mortensen but to the South African left winger Perry free on the far post. A right-footed shot and the Matthews Final had been won by Blackpool. Would England have prevailed in the most humiliating match of their history, that defeat by the USA at Belo Horizonte in the 1950 World Cup, had Matthews played? Perhaps; but he didn't. Indeed it was only at the last moment that he was grudgingly recalled from an FA XI tour of North America to play in Brazil at all. He did play the last England game, lost against Spain in Rio 1-0, but the die was cast by then.\n\nMatthews's long marriage to Betty ended in 1968. Matthews remarried, this time a, Czech linguist, Mila Winter, cultural assistant at the US embassy and wife of a well known Czech painter.\n\nHe and Betty had two children, Jean and Stanley junior. The latter became three times British Junior tennis champion, and won the Wimbledon Junior Invitation title. He never quite fulfilled his early promise, and eventually turned to coaching in the United States.\n\nKnighted in 1965, a month before his 50th birthday, Matthews altogether made 698 appearances in the Football League for 71 goals, and played 54 full internationals for Englands for 11 goals. In 1963, he had the great satisfaction of helping Stoke City regain the 1st Division.\n\nA period as manager of Port Vale, after Stoke had rather sullenly parted company with him, reducing his wages and refusing him complimentary tickets, was ill-starred. The club fell foul of regulations concerning the signing of young players and Matthews was unfairly found culpable.\n\nHe went on to live in Malta, where he played for the Hibernians team at 55, and to coach widely abroad, especially in South Africa, where he had first worked in 1954, and in Canada. He was known in Soweto as \"the white man with a black man's face\"."
