        "text": "Sir Stanley Matthews (born February 1, 1915, Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, England—died February 23, 2000, Newcastle-under-Lyme) was a football (soccer) player, an outside right forward considered by many to be one of the greatest dribblers in the history of the sport. In 1965 he became the first British footballer to be knighted.\n\nThe son of a professional boxer, Matthews began his professional career with the Stoke City team in 1932. With his accurate passing, ball control, and balance, he became known as “the Wizard of Dribble.” By 1938 he was representing England in international matches, and he eventually appeared in 54 full international contests. Named the first European Footballer of the Year (1941), Matthews was transferred (traded) to Blackpool in 1946. With that team he competed in the 1953 Football Association Cup Final, considered to be his most famous game. Matthews set up Blackpool’s last three goals to help defeat the Bolton Wanderers in what became known as “the Matthews final.” In 1961 he rejoined the Stoke City team, but four years later, at the age of 50, he retired from professional play. In addition to his athletic skills, Matthews was also noted for his sportsmanship, which earned him the nickname “First Gentleman of Soccer.” An autobiography, The Stanley Matthews Story, appeared in 1960."
