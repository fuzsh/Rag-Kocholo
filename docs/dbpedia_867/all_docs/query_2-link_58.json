They have our heartfelt thanks.\n\n“I am seeking further information on what has occurred and will be following details closely.”\n\nScottish Greens transport spokesperson Mark Ruskell MSP said: “It is too early to know what has caused this incident, but clearly a full investigation will have to take place.\n\n“From reports it appears this has been on the heritage track, the Strathspey Railway line, involving the Flying Scotsman and that nearby services on the main line have been temporarily impacted to allow emergency efforts to continue.\n\n“We are thinking of all those involved at this challenging time and thanks all those who have taken part in the emergency response.”"
