I briefly met Professor Fred Gamst of the University of Massachusetts at the Durham (UK) Early Railways conference, and corresponded with him subsequently; chapters 11 to 13 depend greatly on his edition of von Gerstner. For mechanical matters and for locomotive traction in particular I am indebted to the work of, and discussion with, Dr Michael Bailey. Otherwise, I am also extremely grateful to Graham Boyes, Anthony Coulls, Mike Chrimes, Helen Gomersall, Andy Guy, Dr John van Laun, Michael Messenger, Jim Rees, Dr Barrie Trinder and all the other contributors to the conference series. Thanks are also due to Anthony Leslie Dawson for his research and publications, and for advancing the cause on social media. For encouragement to undertake this study in the first place, together with comments on drafts and a certain amount of goading, I am indebted to Sir Neil Cossons and to Julia Elton. Laura xiii\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS McCullagh has read chapters as a non-specialist and has pointed out to me many instances where I blithely and wrongly assumed general knowledge of some technical term or other. Dr Marian Gwyn has been, as ever, an unfailing source of encouragement and advice.\n\nxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nT\n\nhis is a history of the early iron railway: an account of how a means of transport running on iron rails and using mechanical traction came into being in the second half of the eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth, how it evolved from the earlier forms of railway which were operating in Britain, how it then went through a particularly rapid period of transformation between 1786 and 1830, and how over the next 20 years it became a widely accepted means of moving people and goods over much of Europe and North America. This is not an inquiry into the origins of the railway. Rather, I set out to explore a crucial period of its history, to see how it met the needs of the Industrial Revolution, that profound change in human circumstances which involved not only new methods of manufacture but also more effective means of distribution. The fundamental concept of the railway, a prepared way that both guides and supports wheeled vehicles, dates from prehistory. By the eighteenth century, railways were already a well-established technology.1 Practically all were mineral-handling systems. They could be found as far east as Kazakhstan, and as far west as France and Ireland. They were constructed almost entirely of wood, and relied on the power of 1\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY humans, horses or oxen for propulsion. Most operated in darkness underground, though some might extend from the mouth of a mine level for a short distance to a dump or a crushing plant. Only in some British coalfields were there any railways longer than a few hundred yards. In the north-east of England it was agreed that one of these wooden ‘waggonways’ could be cost-effective up to 10 miles in length, from the pit-head to staithes on the Tyne or Wear rivers.2 An increase in the demand for coal made it clear that this was a technology with great potential for adaptation and development which could benefit many other industries and economies. As a result, railways came to carry not only minerals but also foodstuffs and goods such as cotton, a staple of the emerging global financial system, as well as offering passenger services. Most notable in this respect was the Liverpool and Manchester, opened in 1830, which was the first to connect two great trading cities. Railways also came to be built in places where they had never existed before, and on a vastly greater scale. In 1832 the first railway connecting two great continental rivers was finally completed, between Budweis and Linz in the Austrian Empire. The following year the first railway over 100 miles in length was put into service, the Charleston and Hamburg in South Carolina. These changes were made possible by a culture of experimentation and of constant adaptation, and by a growing understanding of new materials, specifically the progressive substitution of iron for wooden elements.The inclined plane was patented in Britain in 1750. Significant use of iron began in 1767, when cast-iron straps on wooden rails are first recorded. In 1786–7 the first all-iron rails were introduced. Within a few years, there was the additional option of using mechanical traction powered by fossil fuel in the form of fixed high-pressure steam engines which wound haulage ropes, or even self-propelling ‘locomotive engines’. These became a possibility in the context of the coal and metallurgical industries of England and Wales, but soon spread to other countries, revolutionised in 1829–30 by Robert Stephenson’s 2\n\nIntroduction Rocket/Northumbrian/‘Planet’/‘Samson’ design. It soon became clear that a locomotive and its train running along iron rails could accomplish what the carrier’s cart, the stagecoach and the canal barge could not. Historians have often referred to the years from 1825 to 1830 as the dawn of a ‘railway age’, but the evolution of railways over the previous 80 years or so remains much less known, despite many excellent specialist histories. There is little collective understanding of their own very considerable economic impact. A French visitor to Newcastle in 1765 could see that the phenomenal growth of the coalfield was due to its wooden waggonways to the Tyne. A short hand-propelled system, running on cast-iron rails a few yards from a canal wharf to an adjacent limekiln, or moving manure in a farmyard, also reduced transport costs significantly. These systems are as much part of the story as the steam networks which evolved from them, but history books have little to say about the changes which led from one to the other, and how the achievements of celebrated engineers such as the Stephensons were based on experience gained earlier. Technical changes take place as components within an engineered system appear, mature, become obsolete and are replaced. In the course of the nineteenth century, wooden vessels moved by wind gave way to iron steamships; rural watermills were superseded by factories where cereal crops were crushed by mechanically driven rollers. Similarly, the railway underwent an evolutionary change common in the Industrial Revolution, by progressively replacing organic elements activated by natural forces with mechanical technologies made of iron and powered by fossil fuels. Technical changes also relied on improved capacity and on a better understanding of physical phenomena, whether established by rational enquiry or by trial and error. In this respect, the early iron railway could be compared with the electric telegraph, which developed within almost exactly the same time frame.3 It differs from powered flight, where the theoretical principles were understood well over 50 years before the internal combustion engine made it a possibility.4 3\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY As these examples remind us, technical changes are also social processes. They depend not only on human knowledge and skill but also on changes in demand for particular goods and services and on the profits that they generate – as well as on a broader cultural context, such as political support and popular acceptance. The period from 1750 to 1850 saw not only remarkable economic development and technical experimentation, but also great political upheaval and social reordering, as pointed out by contemporaries.5 To understand how the ‘iron road’ evolved, not only do we have to examine how a particular technical transformation took place, but also why particular social and economic forces made it necessary and possible. Precisely because of the transformational nature of the technology at this time, it is important to avoid some historical pitfalls. We learn little from a list of ‘firsts’, which often prove to be erroneous, and which all too easily feed into a narrative of heroic engineer-inventors and of national exceptionalism.6 Without a doubt, this hundred-year phase in the evolution of the railway owed a great deal to individual talent, British ingenuity and British capital. But these factors must be contextualised. Great Britain and Ireland, and the successor United Kingdom established in 1800–1, underwent remarkable changes in this period in which military and naval victories both consolidated a sea-based empire and encouraged early industrialisation, underpinned by an effective banking system. These in themselves put the early iron railway in perspective, as the consequence not of innate individual or national genius but of particular historical circumstances within the broader rise and fall of states and jurisdictions. Until 1815, its development was largely a British story. Thereafter, its use spread, but, while other countries certainly considered very carefully what had been accomplished in Britain, they did not as a rule adopt it without significant change. Another related challenge is to avoid a ‘Whig view of history’, to use Professor Butterfield’s memorable phrase, whereby the past is made to tell a story of essentially non-reversible progress, whether in 4\n\nIntroduction the public sphere or in technology.7 The waggonway which preceded the Stephenson railway in the north-east of England was not in any sense a crude system which only required iron rails and steam locomotives to make it effective. It has rightly been described as ‘a complex series of lines, continually fine tuned to take advantage of new pit sinkings and more advantageous wayleaves . . . in the terms of the time, a mature and sensitive rail system to which the Coalfield, without the distraction of any competing canals, was utterly committed’.8 It was a system entirely appropriate to its circumstances. Wooden rails remained for many years a perfectly rational choice in some contexts. Furthermore, though we distinguish for convenience’s sake between a ‘wooden railway’ and an ‘iron railway’, wood remained a vitally important structural material throughout this period and well beyond, particularly in the USA and Russia, where it was increasingly used rather than coal as a locomotive fuel. Even now, wooden sleepers are widely used on railway systems across the world; trains still cross rivers on timber bridges, or stop at stations with wooden shelters. An ‘iron road’ is one where iron components are common or where mechanical traction is employed – not one from which organic elements are excluded. Avoiding a ‘Whig view of history’ also means taking seriously those who, at a time of rapid experimentation, were cautious about new technologies, before labelling these people as dull-witted or obscurantist. Some opposed railways in principle. Governing classes, all too well aware of the direction in which Parisian sans-culottes had taken the French Revolution, feared the mobile, landless working class which they knew the railways would help create.9 Conservatives such as Metternich and Tsar Nicholas I also believed that allowing foreign investment in countries with minimal capital of their own would weaken hard-won social and political cohesion.10 Others expressed technical or environmental fears which now seem laughable, but in the 1820s there was no body of learned opinion to challenge the assertion that steam locomotives would affect the milk yield of cows in nearby fields, or the concern that the human frame could not cope with speed. 5\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY Then there was the challenge of identifying the technologies worth investment: what would work in the long term and what was already appropriate to particular circumstances. Bankers are more cautious than engineers, and need to know whether a proffered innovation has substance, how much further development it is going to require before producing a return, how long this is likely to take – or whether a completely different but better idea is in prospect. By the same token, apparently crude or dead-end technologies remained rational options in some circumstances, or they might re-emerge in different form. The survival of the wooden rail is a case in point. North American railways used them extensively with, and sometimes even without, a thin iron strap on the running surface. Even Brunel’s London to Bristol railway, opened in 1841 and soon to become the Great Western Railway, laid wrought-iron bridge-section rails on longitudinal baulks, still in essence largely a wooden railway. Wooden railways continued to be built for safety reasons, such as in explosives works, or where timber was easily available and iron was not, such as logging systems. The ‘pole road’, much used in timber-harvesting in the south-eastern USA, must rank as the most rudimentary form of railway ever devised, yet well into the twentieth century, steam and petrol locomotives hauled bogies along rails made of unmarketable logs laid directly on the ground.11 Wooden railways lingered on in the Australian outback and in coal-pits in the Forest of Dean until very recent times indeed, though they have now effectively vanished.12 The steam locomotive itself became one of these time-expired technologies. Its immediate demise was much heralded in the 1920s, though it is only now that it is finally reaching the end of its commercial life.13 It could be replaced by other forms of locomotive, diesel or electric, without having to make a fundamental change to the system, which is why other railway technologies from this early period have proved even more durable. These include the concept of an integrated network, of public control, a standard gauge, articulated rolling stock, even the idea of a train of vehicles and of dedicated passenger 6\n\nIntroduction facilities. The railway, even now, is to a great extent founded on the technology that evolved from 1750 to 1850 which then led to the first regional and national networks. The iron railway truly made the modern world. It would redefine warfare, sustain empires and deepen commitment to a fossil economy. Its effect on national economies, industrial development and globalisation is beyond calculation.14 It changed employment practice and would also profoundly affect less obvious matters such as diet and health, as well as ethnic and gender relationships.15 Total route mileage has declined since the twentieth century, but there are still about 1,000,000 km of railway in the world, carrying 10,000 billion freight tonne-km and 3,000 billion passenger-km annually.16 Freight services now connect Zhejiang in China with Madrid in Spain. Sleek bulletshaped trains powered by electricity running on rails of steel can reach speeds of over 400 km an hour. However, if we are to understand how the railway has shaped the world we inhabit, we need to return to its transformation from wooden waggonway to ‘iron road’.\n\n7\n\n1\n\nTrade, transport and coal 1767–1815\n\nFor coals on rails preceded, in Britain, all else on rails.1\n\nI\n\nn January 1768 Joseph Banks (1743–1820), making his way slowly back to London from a visit to his friend Thomas Pennant of Downing Hall in north-east Wales, came across a railway in Shropshire. It connected the Quaker iron-furnaces at Ketley with those at Horsehay and at Coalbrookdale by the River Severn, making it about four miles long. Banks described it in detail, as he did all the many other industrial developments he saw on his travels, noting that it was ‘the most extensive one I believe in this Part of the Kingdom’. It used a double wooden rail, with sacrificial strips, which could be replaced more frequently, along the top made of the finest heart of oak, but they soon wore out, ‘so much so that they have begun at the dale to make the upper barrs of cast Iron & have thoughts of continuing it all their ways’.2 These conferred a further advantage, which he did not mention, in that they also enabled heavier loads to be carried than on a wooden railway, still more than in a cart on a made-up road.3 An area that had already seen many innovations in metallurgy had now created the iron railway. 8\n\nTrade, transport and coal 1767–1815 Banks, only 24 years old yet already a fellow of the Royal Society, had made his name as a natural philosopher and botanist with an expedition to Newfoundland and Labrador. The year after his journey from Wales to London he would accompany Captain Cook on the Endeavour to observe the transit of Venus, thereby calculating the earth’s distance from the sun, and to map the Australian coast. Banks embodied Enlightenment rationalism and restless scientific enquiry, and introduced eighteenth-century Britain to the wonders of the wider world. It seems appropriate that he should also have been the first to describe an ‘iron road’. His journey home from Wales lay along Watling Street, a route that had been in use since prehistory, and the manner in which he travelled would have been familiar to its Roman wayfarers – slowly, on horseback, staying overnight at inns. In truth, there was little that would have surprised a visitor from the ancient world in the way that goods and people moved about England, or any other country, in the middle of the eighteenth century. Wooden ships and boats plied great continental rivers and inland seas, and were moved by muscle, currents or wind. Dutch, Italian and French engineers were once again building artificial canals, as the Romans had done and as the Chinese had continued to do for two thousand years. Human beings – merchants, trappers, the enslaved – and livestock made their own way along trackways and trails. In sub-Saharan Africa, goods were carried by head porterage. Animal-drawn carts running on made-up roads had been long used over much of the Eurasian land mass, and could now be found in European colonies in North America and South Africa. In pre-Columbian America the absence of large domesticated animals limited the use of wheels to children’s toys; goods were moved by rafts and by pack llamas, until the conquistadors arrived with their cavalry and their baggage trains. In Europe, both economic growth and warfare were leading to better techniques in horse breeding, as well as in agricultural productivity to feed both people and draught animals. New vehicle components such 9\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY as steel springs accompanied road-surfacing techniques associated with the engineer Pierre-Marie-Jérôme Trésaguet which were later to be developed by Thomas Telford and John Loudon McAdam into what in English was called a ‘metalled road’ and in French (and in German and Russian) a chaussée.4 The Seven Years War (1756–63) had left France with debts it could not afford, but gave victorious Britain an enlarged sea-based empire which brought it to industrial ‘take off ’, the point where technical innovation and economic growth become mutually self-supporting. Very shortly after hostilities were brought to a close by the Treaty of Paris, the spinning jenny made its appearance; James Watt conceived the idea of the separate condenser for the Newcomen steam engine; and the Scottish philosopher and economist Adam Smith began work on what became The Wealth of Nations, making the case for low-tariff trade between nations and with their colonies. Britannia had now come to rule the waves, its sea-based empire providing the raw materials for the industries which were transforming the global economy. Cart roads connected the cotton growers of Gujarat with weaving villages along the Indian coast, and the sugar planters and enslaved workers of Jamaica with wharves on the island’s inland rivers. Another such industry lay in Britain itself: mining for coal, which had its own unique transport needs. Britain produced more coal than any other country in the world, and by the mid-eighteenth century was rapidly developing into an ‘energy economy’.5 By far the biggest suppliers were the pits of the north-east of England, but there were also productive areas from Ayr to Fife in Scotland, in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cumberland, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Shropshire and in north-east and southeast Wales, as well as a small coalfield in County Tyrone in Ireland. Between the mid-seventeenth century and 1800, production rose sixtyfold. London’s need for fuel was voracious and growing; from being home to about 50,000 people in the 1520s, by 1700 England’s metropolis rivalled Paris for the distinction of being the most populous city in Europe, with half a million inhabitants, a figure which doubled in the 10\n\nTrade, transport and coal 1767–1815 course of the eighteenth century to make it one of the largest in the world, on a par with Beijing and Edo (Tokyo). London’s new townhouses were designed around the burning of coal for warmth and cooking.6 Coal was also increasingly being used in industries as varied as metallurgy, lime burning, glassmaking, brewing, brickmaking and salt boiling.7 British collieries were not only the largest but also the most heavily mechanised in the world.8 They were themselves becoming consumers of their own output, as steam pumping and winding engines became more common.9 Coal has a low value-to-weight ratio and incurs high movement costs, but because it provided a very effective form of energy, it could generate a high return on investment for those who could mine it – if it could be transported in sufficient quantity. Overland transport of this heavy but compact and valuable fossil from pithead to navigable water or to a point of use therefore became a matter of the utmost significance, to the extent that central government – the Westminster Parliament and the Privy Council, as well as the Irish Parliament until its abolition in 1800 – took an active interest in the trade and were prepared to intervene when problems arose.10 Coal owners had several options, depending on topography, on output and on the level of capital at their disposal. In some impoverished and out-of-the-way places, packhorses were still used, carrying two or three hundredweight at a time. Cart roads had a greater capacity, and artificial waterways could carry more still. Collieries at Worsley in Lancashire were badly served by their tidal rivers, leading their owner, the Duke of Bridgewater, to construct a canal system directly from the coalface to their principal markets in Manchester. Collieries in south-west Wales and in County Tyrone also came to be served by canals. However, the railway not only ultimately prevailed over all the other systems but also gave the industrial age its definitive transport technology. It is not entirely true to say that ‘coals on rails preceded, in Britain, all else on rails’, since railways did not first appear in the coal 11\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY industry.11 Nor were they invented in the British Isles. In the 1560s experienced miners from the free imperial city of Augsburg had installed at a copper mine in Caldbeck in Cumberland a system which used a small hand-propelled vehicle known as a hund, running on plain wheels, with a vertical guide-pin fitting into the very narrow gap between plank-like wooden rails, such as had been commonly used in the mining fields of central Europe since at least the late medieval period.12 So far as is known, this was the first railway in Britain, but it was not long before the coal industry also saw the value of this continental European invention.13 The first wooden colliery railway may have been at work in the Severn Gorge in Shropshire before the end of the sixteenth century. Though this area’s output was far smaller than the north-eastern coalfield, it was the scene of many significant technological innovations and an important element of the economy of western England, benefitting from access to markets by means of the river and of Watling Street.14 By 1604 a railway had been laid in the Nottinghamshire coalfield by the entrepreneur Huntingdon Beaumont (c. 1560–1624), who also introduced them to the north-east of England – one on the coast at Bedlington, which was laid around 1608, and at Cowpen and Bebside, probably at much the same time.15 In 1621 the first recorded railway to the River Tyne was built, from pits in Whickham parish. After the Restoration of 1660 they became common. At some very early stage, their basic technology underwent a significant change, anticipating the modern railway in that guidance was no longer provided by a pin between the rails but by a flange on the wheels – a projecting rim which interfaces with the side of the rail, just as the wheel’s rim is supported by the rail’s surface. On overland wooden railways serving English collieries, this enabled a broader gauge and horse traction, and hence higher capacity, whereas the hund was only effective for hand-propulsion over short distances underground.16 Some important variations also became evident early on, with two distinct types of wooden railway evolving within the coalfields of 12\n\nTrade, transport and coal 1767–1815\n\n1. An inclined plane to the River Severn, sketched by a Swedish visitor in 1754.\n\nBritain and Ireland. The Shropshire type was adopted in north-east Wales and in parts of south-east Wales and Lancashire. The other came from the north-east of England and spread to Cumberland, Yorkshire, County Tyrone, parts of lowland Scotland and Wales around Swansea and Wrexham. Both were to have a lasting impact on the way that the successor technology of the iron railway developed, with consequences that are clear to this day. The typical Shropshire system was a compact one. The gauge (the distance between the rails, normally measured from the inside faces) was narrow, not more than 3’ 9” (1140 mm), reflecting the fact that many were initially devised to run directly from the coalface along a 13\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY level tunnel into the open air, then down to the River Severn.17 Some involved inclined planes down the valley sides; these worked on the ‘self-acting’ principle, whereby the downward traffic enabled the empty waggons to be hauled upwards. The Swedish metallurgist Reinhold Rücker Angerstein (1718–60) sketched one during his visit to Coalbrookdale in the Severn Gorge in October 1754, showing a single track with a passing loop to a small jetty.18 Waggons were generally small in capacity, between 14 cwt (711 kg) and 60 cwt (3048 kg). These systems were often not heavily engineered and might have very short lives, ‘of the mushroom breed, only the produce of one night’.19 Others were more substantial and lasted longer. In 1729 iron wheels were used at Coalbrookdale; their use soon spread.20 The establishment of new coke-fired furnaces in the 1750s and the expansion of mining brought longer systems into being, including the one Banks saw from Ketley (near Watling Street) to Coalbrookdale Wharf on the Severn. A few years later, the Quaker minister and industrialist Abiah Darby stated that the Company had 20 miles of cast-iron ‘road’.21 They were sometimes called ‘waggonways’, or ‘insets’ or ‘footrails’, but also ‘railed ways’ or (as Joseph Banks called them) ‘railways’.22 In the great coalfield around Newcastle-on-Tyne, the wooden ‘waggonways’, or sometimes simply ‘ways’, were long, high-capacity overland systems requiring significant investment. The main coalfield was compact – barely more than 15 miles east to west and 12 north to south – but coal was increasingly having to be dug further inland and deeper, in higher ground rising up to 1,000 feet away from the coast, up the steep-sided Tyne and Wear valleys – impossible terrain for a canal, and a long haul by road, but within the reach of wooden railways running from the pitheads to the rivers. The Tyne was navigable 10 miles upstream from Newcastle, the Wear as far inland as Lambton Castle. Coal was transferred from waggonways either into river keelboats or directly into the sea-going collier ships themselves by means of ‘staithes’, substantial timber structures whose scale was dictated by the larger waggons, by the size 14\n\nTrade, transport and coal 1767–1815 of the vessels they were loading and by the fact that they had to accommodate a tidal range.23 Waggonways also carried timber for pit props which was landed from Scandinavia. The Chopwell way and the Tanfield way carried lead from the north Pennines, the East Winlaton way and its successor the Western way carried billets of Swedish steel inland to Cowley Ironworks.24 These waggonways were all built and operated by colliery owners, either as individuals or as partnerships, and were routed to their advantage, avoiding as much as possible land held by others and the consequent need to pay for way leaves and royalties. The ‘lords of coal’ clashed repeatedly with each other, and also tended to be at odds with the Newcastle merchants. The Tyne and the Wear trades were bitter rivals, and powerful regional dynasties who had never accepted the Reformation had little common ground with the Whig descendants of Puritan families. Not for nothing were coal exports described as ‘A fighting trade run in a shallow tempestuous stream’, and as we shall see, this has some bearing on the ways both in which the wooden waggonway did not need to change its form significantly for many years and in how it ultimately began to do so at the very end of the eighteenth century.25 Central to their evolution were the colliery ‘viewers’, a formidable caste of individuals who were responsible as engineers for the working of the pits themselves and for the building and operation of waggonways and staithes, but who also took on other roles, as negotiators and political enforcers. They often worked as independent consultants, and so were much in demand in other coalfields, a state of affairs which explains the often rapid spread of particular technologies. Viewers might be the younger sons of gentlemen or they might be pitmen who had shown particular aptitude. They had to win the confidence of workmen and to combine respectful deference to their employers with frankness, and they needed to show good judgement in commercial and technical matters.26 15\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY The waggonways they constructed were extremely well adapted for the Newcastle trade. They were built to a broader gauge than their Shropshire counterparts, invariably between 3’ 10” and 5’ (1168– 1524 mm), a reflection of the optimal axle length on a single vehicle pulled by a single horse, from which the current UK, continental European and USA standard gauge of 4’ 8½” (1435 mm) derives. Typical practice was for the wooden rails to be fixed to wooden sleepers, and the space between and around them filled with stone ballast. Outside the rails, ballast was laid nearly to the top of the rail to form a path for the waggonmen to follow. The sleepers were 4 to 8 inches (101.6–203.2 mm) square and longer than the gauge of the way. The rails were 4 to 5 inches wide and high, with the width usually slightly exceeding the height. They might be 6 foot (1828 mm) long, pegged to the sleepers every 18 inches with treenails of young oak 6 to 7 inches (152–177 mm) long. Rail joints were made above a sleeper, with adjoining rails merely butting up to each other. If a rail became damaged it could be turned over. From the mideighteenth century the practice evolved of laying a ‘double way’, whereby a second rail was fixed to the top of the first. This allowed more ballast to be laid above the sleepers, thereby protecting them from the horses’ hooves, and had the advantage that the joints between the running surface did not have to be above a sleeper, which made for a more durable system.27 The waggons used on these systems had a much greater carrying capacity than the Shropshire types, typically between 37 cwt (1880 kg) and 50 cwt (2540 kg), and were known as ‘chaldron waggons’ after an archaic term for a measure of coal (53 cwt in the north-east of England from 1694).28 James Fittler’s 1783 engraving shows a typical operation, the single waggon making its way down to the Tyne at Newcastle by gravity, with the horse acting as a brake, under the control of one man. The volume of traffic was such that some Tyneside systems had been built, or rebuilt, to double- or even triple-track, on which loaded 16\n\nTrade, transport and coal 1767–1815\n\n2. A ‘run’ to the Tyne on the Parkmore waggonway, depicted by James Fittler in 1783.\n\nwaggons made their way down a ‘main way’, laid wherever possible on a regular falling alignment, and horses pulled the empties back along a ‘bye way’, which might not necessarily run parallel to it but wandered around to find an easier route.29 In practice, the maximum gradient was 1 in 10, which was neither too steep for a horse hauling an empty chaldron waggon up a ‘pull’, nor for keeping a loaded one in check on a ‘run’. By accepting these ferocious gradients, and some civil engineering on a massive scale, waggonway wrights could choose a route which placed the coal owner at an advantage over the way leave owner.30 The coalfield had long been a place of wonder and curiosity to visitors. The pioneering French metallurgist Gabriel Jars (1732–69), who came to Newcastle in 1765, stated that the waggonways were costly to build but soon paid for themselves by the ease of moving coal at all times of the year. He explained how the formation was prepared on as constant a gradient as possible towards the river, and earthworks constructed as necessary, with wooden bridges across small side valleys. Wooden sleepers were then laid down and wooden rails dowelled into them to a gauge generally of about four ‘pieds’. The waggons varied in size but all followed the same basic pattern, 17\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY hopper-shaped, with an opening floor, running on four flanged wheels, of which the two at the river end were made of cast iron and were larger in diameter than the wooden discs at the rear in order to keep the floor level. Axles were made of iron and fixed to the wheels. A brake lever operated on one of these wheels. A single horse pulled a single such waggon or acted as a brake on downhill sections, where derailments were not unknown. Sharp changes in alignment were carried out by a turntable. Routes varied in length. Some collieries were very near the Tyne, but others lay 7 or 8 miles away (‘three French leagues’).31 Jars remarks: The longest way [chemin] belongs to a very rich company, in which Milord Bute, a former minister, is one of the principal parties. This company is not only the owner of the Royalty of several collieries, but it also leases very many such all along the road. It works coal on a very extensive scale, as the road is almost always covered with waggons. This company does not spare any expense in developing its operations, and the market for its output.32\n\nCoal from Bute’s collieries was carried on several ‘ways’, though Jars is probably referring here to the Tanfield, from South Moor to the Tyne at Redheugh. This included a single 120 foot-span (36.6 m) stone arch carrying the double-track way over the Causey Burn, hailed by a local newspaper on its completion in 1727 as ‘the greatest Piece of Work that has been done in England since the Time of the Romans’.33 In 1726 some of the most powerful coal-owning families – the Bowes, Liddells, Ords and Montagues – formed a cartel which came to be known as ‘The Grand Allies’, creating a regional monopoly by not only working coal on their own manors but also by buying up land and royalties, and managing way leaves to ensure their own rights of way to navigable water and to deny them to others. Jars’s visit came at the end of 40 years of rising prices and steady output, the golden 18\n\nTrade, transport and coal 1767–1815 age of these coal owners and of the wooden Newcastle waggonways. The level of profits they generated may have discouraged innovation, or restricted it to the collieries themselves, and the rationing of the London market may have delayed the exhaustion of some coal seams. Ultimately, the Grand Allies’ monopoly and profits were eroded by their rivals in the Tyne basin and along the River Wear, and the price of coal fell in 1767. A negotiated agreement, the ‘Limitations of the Vend’ in 1771, restored some stability to the trade at a time of renewed expansion of its markets. The Lambton waggonway, which ran to staithes on the Wear, was built in 1770 and was the last entirely wooden way serving a large area and running to the highest point which could be served by river keels. The need to transport ever greater tonnages of coal made it clear that the days of the wooden waggonway were numbered. The coming of the iron railway Iron components had been used to build and operate railways before 1767. Thin wrought-iron strips beaten out by a blacksmith on an anvil had been laid on the top of wooden rails on some systems since perhaps the early eighteenth century, and iron axles, wheel treads and entire wheels began to be used not long after.34 There was no one moment when the iron railway made its appearance, but a process of gradual evolution took place. Between 1786 and 1815 a growing understanding of beam theory and of the properties of cast iron made it possible to produce brittle but serviceable rails in this medium, rather than simply an iron element to be laid on wood such as Banks had observed at Coalbrookdale. These took two very different basic forms. Some were ‘edge rails’ for flanged wheels, which were initially no more than untutored attempts to reproduce the form of a squared timber but which grew in sophistication over this period. Others were L-section plate rails for flangeless wheels, an iron version of the existing wooden flanged barrow-ways which were used underground 19\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY in some collieries. These two types were completely incompatible with each other, which mattered little for as long as railways were short-haul unconnected handling systems, just as differences in gauge were still of little account but became problematic in later years.35 In some places, these technologies converged with another, mechanical traction in the form of both fixed and ‘locomotive’ (self-propelling) steam engines. Fixed engines, for winding waggons by rope, were used with some success, but locomotives proved more challenging, as they had to be sufficiently heavy to gain traction but not so much so as to break the rails or plates on which they ran. Not until 1815 did the steam locomotive become an entirely practical and useful technology, after about 12 years of experiment. These changes are generally ascribed to the growing demand for coal, a fall in the price of iron and a rise in the price of wood as a consequence of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars (1793– 1815). Warfare also increased the cost of horses and of fodder, which not only meant that animal traction had to be used more effectively but also prompted the search for mechanical alternatives. Remarkably, none of these innovations took place in the northeast of England coalfield. The first all-iron rails were laid in collieries near Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales and at Sheffield in Yorkshire in 1786–7, and though they were known on Tyneside a few years later, their use spread in the context of the iron industry, as well as of the collieries that served it, and above all the growing network of canals. Many hundreds of miles of canal feeder railway came to be built, even into the 1830s. Earlier ones were typically a wooden waggonway, later ones an iron road. The form the rails and other track components took is described in the following chapter, and the railways themselves in chapter 3. The first use of steam to haul railway vehicles was in Shropshire in 1793, in the form of fixed engines on railed inclined planes functioning in place of locks on canals. Experimental use of railway locomotives began in South Wales in 20\n\nTrade, transport and coal 1767–1815 1804, to the design of the Cornishman Richard Trevithick and with the capital and encouragement of the ironmaster Samuel Homfray. Though further trials took place in the north-east of England shortly afterwards, regular use of locomotives only began in Leeds in 1812, operating on the rack system patented by the viewer John Blenkinsop, to haul coal from Middleton Colliery. The use of these rack locomotives spread to the Lancashire coalfield in January 1813, to the northeast in September of that year and to South Wales by 1814. They are described in chapter 4. The rapid spread of all these technologies is itself remarkable. The movement of experts between different coalfields ensured that new developments soon became common knowledge, but a more general ‘spirit of association’ was also abroad, often rational and utilitarian in its ambitions and sometimes, but not always, associated with radical politics and freethinking. Experiment and enquiry depended on sharing and discussing results: a polymath of the Enlightenment like Joseph Banks could benefit from membership of the Royal Society (founded 1660) and of the Society of Arts (1754), or of the similar institutions which flourished in Edinburgh and Dublin as well as in and around Birmingham and Shropshire, Sheffield and Newcastle. Some of these were formal organisations with meeting rooms and membership rolls; others, like the Birmingham Lunar Society, were informal associations of like-minded individuals.36 This went with a belief in ‘improvement’, a word which meant many different things to different people but which conveyed gradual and cumulative betterment through more productive farming and manufacture. Since this was a time when warfare had driven up the price of many basic commodities and made the use of horses very costly, it also encompassed more effective transport, whether by road, canal or railway. For many, ‘improvement’ was also supposed to reconcile the working poor to the ways things were, once the French Revolution had shown the ruling classes of Britain and Ireland how inefficient farming and poor transport threatened the food supply on which the 21\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY social order depended. Sympathy for radical change and for free thought gave way to cautious reform: if the poor had to be taught their responsibilities as dutiful subjects, servants and Christians, they also deserved to be properly fed. The Board of Agriculture and Internal Improvement, founded in 1793, was a voluntary association, but it had government backing. Its pioneering president, Sir John Sinclair (1754–1835), introduced the word ‘statistics’ to the English language, sought to measure the ‘quantum of happiness’ of the population and studied the possibilities that railways had to offer.37 It might seem remarkable that technical developments were least evident in Newcastle and the north-east coalfield, a region that lacked neither capital nor expertise, but it had invested very heavily in its wooden waggonways, and at this stage mostly chose to adapt rather than replace. There were as yet few foundries in the region, and cast-iron components had to be brought from elsewhere. So changes to the waggonways were gradual. In 1793, instead of the time-honoured system of running one waggon with one horse, the Western way began to couple two waggons together, preventing them from running away by a ‘long brake’.38 Running a train in the Shropshire manner might have seemed an obvious way of increasing capacity, but for the fact that this would have required an unfeasibly large number of horses to haul waggons up the steep ‘pulls’ or to control them on a downward ‘run’. Where demand was high and changes had to be made, it sometimes became more cost-effective either to realign an existing system or to build a completely new one, but in both cases to lay iron rails. In 1798, for the first time, a colliery railway in the north-east of England was laid with cast-iron edge rails, on stone sleepers. It was only 700 yards long and connected the Walker pits east of Newcastle with an existing wooden waggonway and hence to staithes on the Tyne. It was the work of Thomas Barnes (1765–1801), one of the ablest of the region’s viewers, and may have been based on recent practice on a canal tributary railway in Leicestershire.39 Outside the 22\n\nTrade, transport and coal 1767–1815 region, but on what was effectively a Yorkshire colony of the northeast, iron rails were laid alongside the wooden way on the main route of the Middleton Railway at Leeds between 1799 and 1808 to form a double track, the heavier loaded waggons running on the iron, the lighter empties returning on the wood.40 Using rails that were compatible with the existing networks, and with their waggons, gave coal owners and viewers the option of making a costly change slowly. In 1807 it was recorded that these same Walker pits were ‘gradually giving up their wood Roads and introducing Iron, and they make them piece by piece, keeping up the old Waggons, and running them partly on wood and partly Iron’.41 Iron rails and iron–wood hybrids were also being laid on new systems. One of the earliest was laid in 1805 from Isabella pit to Heworth Colliery staithes on the Tyne as part of the Washington waggonway. A circuitous waggonway from Sheriff Hill which also led to Heworth, only built in the 1790s, was replaced in 1806.42 In 1808–09, pits at Coxlodge and Kenton could export from deepwater staithes on the Tyne at Wallsend by a new railway using iron straps on wooden rails which connected with an older unconverted waggonway down to the river.43 It was the work of the colliery tenant, the accomplished civil and mechanical engineer William Chapman (1749–1832). Chapman was unusual among his peers in that his background was not confined to mining – he had been a mariner and a canal and drainage engineer, and had worked in Ireland and in Yorkshire. He had recently taken out a patent for a ‘drop’ whereby loaded waggons could be lowered vertically from the end of the staithe into a ship’s hold, avoiding breakage of the coal and reducing handling costs. Improved rope-making techniques, another of Chapman’s areas of expertise, was crucial to the operation not only of his ‘drop’ but also of inclined planes, colliery winding and of shipping. This system was applied at Benwell staithes on the north bank of the Tyne, four miles upstream from Newcastle, where Barnes had formerly held sway.44 23\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY\n\n3. ‘Drops’ reduced handling costs and avoided breaking the coal.\n\nOther systems followed. A new iron railway was laid in 1810 to replace the Felling waggonway, running parallel to it.45 The same year, it could be proudly announced that one horse had pulled eight waggons of coal on the inaugural journey of an iron railway constructed by Simon Temple’s Harton Coal Company to the Tyne at South Shields, where an inclined plane led them directly to the collier’s deck.46 A waggonway wright of the old generation might now think of himself as a ‘mechanic’, working additionally in iron and no longer exclusively in wood.47 Steep sections were problematic. Iron rails made it easier for horses on a ‘pull’ but more difficult on a ‘run’, where the load was now in greater danger of running away. The solution lay in building a new formation, as near level as possible, where horses could pull trains of several waggons coupled together, but with much steeper gradients in between, where rope haulage could be used. This particular technology – the inclined plane – was another Shropshire practice, which duly made its appearance in the north-east of England. An Edinburgh 24\n\nTrade, transport and coal 1767–1815 advocate familiar with the Newcastle trade was awarded a patent for them in 1750, but they do not seem to have come into use.48 The first was built in 1797, at Benwell staithes, and was also the work of Thomas Barnes.49 Barnes’s incline was self-acting, as most later ones were, since the topography of the coalfield generally favoured the flow of traffic towards the two rivers, but loads sometimes had to be hauled up the brow of a hill, either by uncoupling a train into separate waggons and hauling them up one by one by horse, or by using a fixed steam engine to wind them up in batches. The inauguration of one such engine on Birtley Fell (Black Fell) on the morning of 17 May 1809 drew a crowd allegedly 10,000 strong, who watched four waggons from Bewicke Main pit being wound up the two inclined planes. In the evening, six men pushed the waggons as far as the staithes on the Tyne ‘in order to prove the excellence of the level railway’.50 In 1812 the landowner and lawyer John Douthwaite Nesham built an iron railway and an inclined plane to connect his pits at Newbottle with a deep-water staithe at the mouth of the River Wear, superseding earlier wooden waggonways which had reached the river miles inland at Penshaw. A detailed watercolour plan and elevation which he commissioned five years later, measuring 10 foot by nearly 3 foot (305 x 91 cm), now preserved in the Sunderland Museum, shows that it was little different from its predecessor systems in many respects, with branches from the various pitheads all converging on a ‘main way’, and horses each leading a single waggon, yet it ran on iron rails – perhaps aptly, it is described as a ‘waggon rail way’. The document includes a pen-and-ink drawing of the Wearmouth iron bridge of 1796, implicitly contrasted with a cartouche of the untamed upper river.51 Well might Nesham present his iron road as another symbol of regional ‘improvement’, since it served seagoing colliers, cutting out the need for the river keelboats which had previously carried his output from Penshaw down the River Wear.52 25\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY This might have proved the railway’s undoing since in March 1815 keelmen fearful of losing income pulled down the wooden bridge carrying the railway across Galley’s Gill and set fire to the Wearmouth staithes, including its inclined plane.53 This was only the start of a series of misfortunes: an explosion in one of the pits claimed the lives of 57 men on 2 June the same year, and on 31 July 1815 an experiment with a locomotive to the design of William Brunton which pushed itself along on legs came to an explosive end, claiming over a dozen lives.54 Thereafter Nesham made further changes involving both self-acting and powered inclined planes until in 1822 his collieries and railway were acquired by the Lambton interests.55 Nesham’s locomotive was not the first to earn its keep in the region, a distinction which belongs to a machine purchased for Coxlodge Colliery, similar to those already operating near Leeds and in Lancashire.56 The section of line destined to receive it, already recently relaid with iron rails, now had to be prepared for the rack system with its projecting teeth on one side of the track. At around 1pm on 2 September 1813 ‘the new invention’ set off from the Jubilee pit at Coxlodge Colliery with 16 waggons, ‘in the presence of a vast concourse of spectators’, after which the gentlemen repaired to the nearby race-track for lunch, ‘when the afternoon was spent in the most agreeable and convivial manner’.57 The Coxlodge locomotive and its two later companions fell victim not to mechanical disaster like Nesham’s, but to an intense man­­ agerial disagreement, when changes in personnel led to accusations of incompetence and wrongful dismissal. The steep section had to be adapted for cable haulage, other realignments were put in place and a new, more powerful locomotive purchased.58 Matters did not end there, but the Kenton and Coxlodge nevertheless had a long working life, carrying coal until 1884.59 More successful in the immediate term was the rebuilding of the isolated Wylam waggonway with plate rails, in 1808. This was carried out with steam traction in mind, though it was several years before it 26\n\nTrade, transport and coal 1767–1815\n\n4. Coxlodge Colliery ran locomotive-hauled trains to deep-water staithes on the Tyne from 1813.\n\nactually saw a locomotive – perhaps in March 1813 – and even then it was not until the summer of the following year that it went into regular use. Experiments here established the relationship between locomotive weight and the ability of a smooth wheel to pull a load on a smooth rail.60 These events are set out in greater detail in chapter 4. However, even more significant in the long term was the construction of the locomotive Blücher for the Killingworth Colliery railway in 1814, to a basic design which had its weaknesses but which proved capable of improvement. It was the work of the engine-wright George Stephenson (1781–1848), one of the outstanding figures of the Industrial Revolution and often hailed as the ‘father of railways’. A collier’s son, still barely literate but charismatic, skilled and persuasive, he was already on an annual salary of £100 from the Grand Allies, with the use of a horse to carry out consultancy work at other pits and on behalf of other coal owners. He and his son Robert (1803–59) between them, more than any other engineers and technicians, created the iron railway, above all by identifying and fostering 27\n\n2\n\n26\n\n10\n\n4\n\n21\n\nNewcastle 7\n\nne Ty\n\n14\n\n24\n\n6\n\nJarrow\n\n22 15\n\n5 17\n\n18\n\nNorth Sea\n\n9\n\n1 20\n\n25\n\n11 23\n\nSunderland\n\n1\n\n20\n\n12\n\n13 8 16\n\n18\n\nDurham Stanhope r ea W\n\nBishop Auckland\n\n3\n\n19\n\n3\n\nStockton 0 0\n\n10 miles\n\nTees\n\nDarlington\n\n10 km\n\n1 Bewicke Main waggonways to Tyne (Ouston waggonway) and Wear 2 Brunton & Shields Railway 3 Clarence Railway 4 Fawdon to Scotswood staithe waggonway 5 Felling waggonway 6 Harton Coal Company's waggonway to the Tyne 7 Heaton waggonway 8 Hetton Colliery railroad 9 Isabella pit to Heworth (Washington waggonway) 10 Kenton & Coxlodge railroad 11 Killingworth waggonway 12 Lambton waggonway 13 Newbottle waggonway\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\n19\n\n14 Parkmore waggonway 15 Springwell Colliery railroad/Pontop & Jarrow Railway 16 Rainton & Seaham railway (‘Benny’s bank’) 17 Sheriff Hill to Heworth waggonway 18 Stanhope & Tyne Railway 19 Stockton & Darlington Railway 20 Tanfield waggonway 21 Walbottle waggonway 22 Walker waggonway 23 Wallsend waggonway 24 Western way 25 Willington waggonway 26 Wylam waggonway\n\nMap 1. The north-east of England coalfield and its railways (mentioned in the text). 28\n\nTrade, transport and coal 1767–1815 a system in which all the components – track, motive power and rolling stock – were able to operate harmoniously. That they were ultimately able to do this was because at this stage the north-eastern coalfield chose not to invest heavily in completely new systems, even to the point of sticking with wooden rails in many cases, and otherwise remained faithful both to the edge rail system and to a gauge of between 4 and 5 foot (1219–1524 mm). The Wylam plateway was the only significant departure from type in the region. When new technologies became available after 1815 – improved forms of iron edge rail and more effective locomotive traction – the tried and tested elements which had served the region well since the seventeenth century could be combined with them to create an effective new system, triumphantly vindicated with the opening of the Stephensons’ Stockton and Darlington Railway in the southern part of the coalfield in 1825, and soon widely adopted not only in the United Kingdom but also in France and the USA.61 In the meantime, very many new railways were being built in Britain to connect with the growing network of canals. Some served collieries, others served different industries entirely and very many of them were built as newfangled plateways, using the L-section flanged rails, an aberration in railway history but which formed the dominant technology for a generation. Their development was to a great extent independent of practice in the north-east of England. The next chapter turns to these canal railways and to other systems using the same technology.\n\n29\n\n2\n\n‘Rails best adapted to the road’\n\nCast-iron rails and their alternatives in Britain 1767–1832\n\nIt is also an important matter to determine the description or form of rails best adapted to the road.1\n\nT\n\nhe single most fundamental development in railway history was the change from wooden to iron rails. This chapter charts the engineering of the first stage in that process, the adoption of track components made from cast iron and the forms they took, from when they first appeared in the form of straps in 1767, through the all-iron rails introduced in 1787 up to their last significant installation in 1832, as well as the contemporary use of wooden and stone elements. These made it possible not only to improve existing systems, such as the coal carriers of the north-east of England, but also to build new ones serving other industries and economies, often in association with canals and turnpike roads, and so coming under some measure of public control. They also made mechanical traction a possibility. They reflect the emergence of cast iron as the dominant material for any high-performance construction during the ‘iron revolution’ of the period 1750 to 1850, which was in many ways the motor of the Industrial Revolution. 30\n\n‘ Rails best adap ted to the road’ This chapter concentrates on the track system itself, leaving the development and fortunes of these systems, and their emulation in continental Europe and the USA, to be discussed subsequently. The second stage, the successor technology of wrought (‘malleable’ or ‘bar’) iron rails from 1808 onwards, is set out in chapter 6. These could carry heavier loads, could be bent into curves and could be produced in longer lengths. They ultimately offered speed, and made the mainline passenger railway possible. Rails and sleepers undoubtedly lack the stirring emotional appeal of the steam locomotive, but they are the most fundamental aspect of railway engineering. Whatever they are made of, whether wood, stone, cast or wrought iron and more latterly steel, or any combination of these, they are the elements that support the vehicle, and it is the rails’ interface with the wheels which provides the guidance, by means of a flange – a protecting rim – either on the wheel itself or on the rail. As chapter 1 described, a remarkable development of this cast-iron era was that many railways were laid with flat plate rails with a tall vertical flange, a fundamental if short-lived departure from mainstream edge-railway practice.2 The choice between plate and edge rails seems to have depended on professional and personal connections, individual preference and good salesmanship as much as on any perceived technical superi­ ority. Some regional peculiarities are evident: north-west Wales, for instance, was mainly edge-rail territory, and it was a family connection with this part of the world that led to the construction of one of the few edge railways built in Cheshire, where otherwise plateways predominated.3 Practice in Ireland and Scotland was mixed.4 The English Midlands, where the influence of the engineer Benjamin Outram was strong, were mainly plateway territory, as was South Wales, to the extent that a number of its early railroads were relaid as plateways very shortly after they were constructed, at Outram’s urging. A detailed description would be very long, but there were in addition many design variations within the two basic types.5 Because 31\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY rails were such an important item of expenditure, promoters were anxious to ensure that they were spending their money wisely and that they were indeed investing in designs ‘best adapted to the road’. The Plymouth and Dartmoor, for instance, a 20-mile plateway completed in 1823, received tenders from four local foundries, three in South Wales, one in the West Midlands and two London merchants. One of the Welsh applicants enclosed a letter recommending that it be built as an edge railway.6 Many market towns now had foundries which might be entrusted with smaller contracts, even if making castings for the whole of the track might be beyond them. Timber and stone components could often be resourced locally. Rails require additional components which transfer the load to the ‘ballast’, a layer generally made up of broken stone which also facilitates drainage, and to the earthwork formation below, and which keep them the right distance apart. On the railways described here, these were often wooden sleepers extending from rail to rail, also called ‘ties’ or ‘crossties’ in the United States, just as they had been in the waggonway era and were to be again on modern railways, but they could also be made of cut stone, either a single embedded block laid under each rail or, less commonly, extending under both sets. Fastenings that we now refer to as ‘chairs’, secured to the sleepers or blocks by pins set into wooden plugs, supported the rails, though a variant type known as a ‘sill’ extending from one rail to another was also used in this period. Rails could simply slot into the chairs or sills, or could be tightened with an iron or wooden wedge. All of these together constitute the ‘track’ of a railway, also called the ‘permanent way’. The track needs to function effectively in conjunction with the vehicles that run on it, according to their weight, their wheels and how frequently they operate. If these vehicles are hauled by horses or by cables, the motive power has no impact on the track, but a steam locomotive pulling its load by means of friction (‘adhesion’) between its wheels and the rails will inflict additional stresses on it. Cast-iron rails could be made strong enough 32\n\n‘ Rails best adap ted to the road’ to bear the weight of a locomotive, but they were a poor fit for each other. Also crucial to the effective operation of a railway of any type was, and is, the question of gauge. In the period under discussion, this was not necessarily measured between the inside faces of the rails but occasionally from the centres, and, in the case of plateways (where the rail flange was nearly always on the inside), from the angles formed by two sections, thus ┘└. The gauge of a railway affected its construction costs and its carrying capacity – the narrower the gauge, the smaller the earthworks on which it ran, and hence the cheaper it was to build, but the less it could carry. Particular types of load required different gauges. A compact mineral which required careful packing, such as North Wales slate, suited small waggons and a narrower gauge, whereas coal or limestone, both of which had to be shovelled into waggons, did better on a broader gauge. With no need for systems to interconnect, gauges and rail types could be of any kind.7 Another important factor is the gradient on which the track is laid. Unlike wooden waggonways where a single horse could pull an empty chaldron waggon uphill from the staithes to the pithead, castiron railways with their trains of waggons required level or near-level formations wherever possible. Cast-iron components Production of cast iron was limited until the successful use of coke for smelting, first achieved in 1709 but not exploited to the full for another 60 years until costs began to fall, at a time when both timber and horses were becoming more expensive. A blast furnace needs 12 tons of coal, ironstone and limestone to produce 1 ton of cast iron, with the result that British output was dominated by the English West Midlands and by south-east Wales, where these raw materials were found together. 33\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY It is a brittle material but because it is cast by pouring it into a mould of sand in a foundry, it can be produced in a variety of complicated shapes. A rail can incorporate the means by which it is attached to other track elements and also by which it is connected end to end with other rails. Cast-iron components are strong in compression but weak in tension and cannot be bent, which meant that, on anything other than an absolutely straight alignment, the alternatives were either to invest in a complex set of castings of different size and shape or to accept a rough-and-ready system involving ‘threepenny bit’ curves. Cast-iron rails were rarely longer than 7 foot (2.1 m), which meant that wheels were constantly passing over joints. Cast-iron straps The railway which Joseph Banks saw at Coalbrookdale in 1768 involved cast-iron straps laid on wooden rails and held in place by nails through projecting lugs – a revolutionary step indeed, though they were crudely made.8 Effective rather than sophisticated, they were adopted in 1776 by John Morris, of Landore near Swansea, ‘for wheeling Coal on in my Collieries’ as he put it, and in 1793 at Mancot in north-east Wales.9 A late and large-scale use of this technology was on the Budweis–Linz railway in Bohemia and Austria, laid between 1827 and 1832, where, in the absence of any rolling mills in the empire, they were favoured above wrought-iron straps (chapter 10). Cast-iron plate rails God bliss the man wi’ peace and plenty That furst invented metal plates! Draw out his years to five times twenty, Then slide him through the heevenly gates.10 34\n\n‘ Rails best adap ted to the road’ The cast-iron L-section plate rail for flangeless wheels came to be the dominant form of railway technology from the 1790s to the mid-1820s – an aberration in railway history perhaps, but an effective system wherever speeds did not need to be high. Hundreds of miles of these ‘plateways’ were laid in many parts of the United Kingdom, most notably in Wales and the border country, above and below ground, and on both internal and cross-country systems. Only the north-east of England remained immune, other than an isolated system connecting Wylam Colliery with the Tyne, which was built in anticipation of locomotive operation. They first date from 1787, when John Curr (c. 1756–1823), viewer of the Duke of Norfolk’s Sheffield collieries, devised and brought into use L-section cast plates for flangeless wheels for use underground, an iron version of existing wooden flanged barrow-ways.11 They proved to be a considerably more cost-effective way of moving coal from the face to the foot of a shaft, requiring no horses and fewer men, which is why a Tyneside collier hoped that he would live to be a hundred and then enter heaven. In 1788 two such plateways were built by Joseph Butler, one from iron mines and collieries to his furnace at Wingerworth in Derbyshire, the other to carry coke from the nearby Lings Colliery to the furnaces and ironworks.12 Another was an inclined plane which carried tub boats on the Ketley Canal in Shropshire (see chapters 3 and 4), also opened in 1788.13 However, it was in collieries that they were most widely adopted. The viewer John Buddle Senior (d. 1809) reported favourably on them, and they were adopted at the Middleton Colliery in Leeds (1790), South Wales (by 1792), in the Shropshire coalfield (1793) and then in Cumberland, Scotland and the north-east of England.14 In 1797 Curr selfpublished The Coal Viewer, and Engine Builder’s Practical Companion after it had been in draft for several years; it describes these plate rails as well as giving a detailed account of rope haulage, of improvements in rope-making and of the potential of the fixed steam engine for pumping and winding – all of them technologies which would 35\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY become increasing important in railway building. It was dedicated to his noble patron.15 Curr claimed that ‘no work of the like kind has hitherto been published’.16 In its detailed and specific suggestions for constructing new types of railway and associated new technologies, this was certainly true. It differed from the more general observations offered by visitors like Angerstein and Jars, discussed in chapter 1, and was the first of a variety of ‘how to’ books which touched on the subject. Curr’s plates were used underground or on internal systems, and most were built to very narrow gauges – between 1’ 8” and 2’ (508– 610 mm).17 In South Wales, plates to Curr’s pattern were soon being cast with the ends convex and concave, lapping them so that only a single nail held both, and incorporating a downward-projecting sleeve or cone around the nail hole to attach it more firmly to the sleeper. Larger plates were soon being used on the new overland systems which were being laid as tributaries to the growing network of canals, as well as others in which the influence of canal engineers is also apparent. Their spread owed much to the advocacy of Benjamin Outram (1764–1805), who had trained as a surveyor but was now turning himself into a civil engineer and an ironmaster. In 1789 he had begun building the Cromford Canal in Derbyshire, and in 1790 he established the partnership ultimately known as the Butterley Company.18 Outram developed a type of plate rail which was markedly heavier than Curr’s, for a broader gauge and for use on overland railways of some length, characterised by raised feet, rounded lugs on the inner side for stability and a notch at each end for spiking down. He guaranteed those that he cast and laid himself.19 His first systems, from Crich limestone quarries to the Cromford Canal and the Little Eaton gangway to the Derby Canal, were 3’ 6” (1067 mm) gauge. The rails he designed for the Peak Forest Railway between 1794 and 1796 became the Outram standard, 42 lb (19 kg) rails to 4’ 2” (1270 mm) gauge laid on stone blocks rather than wooden sleepers, which 36\n\n‘ Rails best adap ted to the road’ thereafter became the preferred option for heavy-duty rails. His approach to construction was extremely thorough.20 As Dr Michael Lewis observes: Outram, more than any other man, determined the shape of industrial railways for a full thirty years. He was responsible, by direct advice, or by example, for countless plateways throughout the Midlands. When he was consulted about the Monmouthshire Canal railways in 1799, he recommended a wholesale changeover from edge to plate rail, and practically every other railwayowner in South Wales followed his advice. Even after his death in 1805, his disciples carried on the work, building new railways by the score and adapting old ones, until by the 1820s, south of County Durham, the edge rail was very much the exception, the plate rail the rule.21\n\nThese systems served the iron and coal industries of South Wales for many years to come. The Merthyr plateway on which Trevithick’s locomotive performed in 1804 was one such; so was the very extensive system in Monmouthshire leading down the canal at Crumlin and to the Severn Estuary at Newport.22 They could work effectively with locomotives as long as speeds were low and the driving wheels were sprung.23 Though this was a time when other industrialising countries were looking to the United Kingdom for technical inspiration, plateways seem to have found little favour elsewhere, though they could be found on a Shropshire-inspired canal lift in Silesia built in 1806, at Alexandrovsk cannon-works between St Petersburg and the White Sea, underground at collieries in Liège in 1810 and in New South Wales in 1832, on temporary and construction railways in Sweden and at collieries and iron mines in Alleghany County in Maryland.24 Their weakness lay in the fact that the plate rails are effectively flat brittle beams, supporting transverse loads, with the result that 37\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY they frequently failed in tension at mid-point on the lower side when waggons, or more particularly locomotives, ran along them. This problem could be minimised by casting them in shapes which increased the amount of iron here, either a rib on the underside or a hogged-profile flange, and by making sure that they were laid on a solid and well-built formation. Damaged plates could in any case easily be taken out and replaced. A further inherent weakness in the design was the friction of the tall flange on the wheels when trains ran round curves; this increased resistance, which could be lessened by ‘dishing’ the wheels inwards so they ran in the angle rather than against the flange.25 It did not matter particularly that traffic could at most proceed at a walking pace, but their efficiency was drastically reduced by misalignment or by dirt or debris on the surface.26 Cast-iron edge rails The introduction of cast-iron edge rails, as distinct from cast-iron straps for wooden rails, was a significant advance in railway technology, even though many early attempts were no more than un­­­ tutored efforts to reproduce in metal what had already been done in wood.27 On present evidence, it seems highly likely that they were first used in Wales, with England following shortly after, and it is probable that they preceded the L-section plates for flangeless wheels described above. Such ‘railroads’ first appeared either in the lower Swansea valley or in one of the ironworks between Merthyr Tydfil and Blaenavon in the 1780s – the exact dates are unrecorded. By 1791, all-iron rails were being cast at Dowlais Ironworks near Merthyr to a design by Thomas Dadford senior, the Glamorganshire Canal contractor, with a male–female joint at each end, for fixing to transverse wooden sleepers. Modified versions were adopted by Dadford’s son, Thomas junior, for railroads built for the Monmouthshire Canal Company (from 1792) and for the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal (from 38\n\n‘ Rails best adap ted to the road’ 1793), with bulbous lugs to accommodate the spikes. It became the most common form of rail in the heads of the South Wales valleys until 1796, when plateways came to be adopted. Similar section rails were used on the Cwm Clydach railroad near Swansea, engineered by John Dadford, as well as on the Somerset Coal Canal in 1795, at Walker Colliery in the north-east of England in 1798 and on the Lake Lock railroad near Wakefield in 1798–9.28 Some of these were cast with integral feet to attach them to the sleepers, others were used in conjunction with separate chairs. As with plate rails, tendencies to break under load could be obviated by the design of the casting, either by widening the rail below the running surface or by deepening it to form a ‘fish-belly’. An oval section, probably designed by Thomas Dadford, for use with double-flanged wheels, was used on the Penrhyn slate quarry railroad in North Wales in 1800–1, which was emulated elsewhere in the region and on a colliery system at Congleton in Cheshire where there were family links with Wales.29 Other forms of cast-iron rails of varying degrees of sophistication came to be used, such as an inverted T-section which was to be found on railways serving the Montgomeryshire Canal and at the Mostyn Colliery at Point of Ayr in Flintshire, north-east Wales.30 Both cast-iron straps and rails were more widely adopted in continental Europe than plate rails, just as purely wooden railways on the English model were also to be found. In 1786 either cast- or wroughtiron straps and wooden rails were laid to connect a colliery to the Ruhr, becoming the model for a number of other coal carriers in the area. Cast-iron straps were added to an existing Shropshire-inspired waggonway carrying silver ore at Clausthal in the Harz mountains around 1806, and spread elsewhere in the Harz, which was at that time part of the kingdom of Hanover, and so under the same crown as Britain. Wooden railways had been installed in Silesian collieries before the end of the eighteenth century, and cast-iron straps and rails made their appearance there soon after. The French ordnance 39\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY factory at l’Indret at the mouth of the Loire began in 1778 or 1779 with wooden rails to which cast-iron straps were soon added, as did the Le Creusot Foundry at Saône-et-Loire a few years later. The Stephenson and Losh rail As the demand for coal grew, and with locomotives under development, there was still every need to devise more effective forms of cast-iron track for the edge railways of the north-east of England. In 1815 William Losh (1770–1861), a manufacturer of chemicals, invited George Stephenson to devote two days a week to the Newcastle ironworks in which he was a senior partner, for which he was to receive £100 a year. The following year the two men were jointly granted a patent which encompassed three separate inventions – a steam locomotive spring, described as being ‘kinder’ to the track; an improved wheel using malleable iron instead of cast iron; and, more importantly, an improved type of cast-iron rail involving half-lapped jointing through which a horizontal pin was passed transversely to join the rails together and also to fasten them to a more sophisticated cast-iron chair, the lap resting on the apex of the curve forming the bottom of the chair.31 These were more stable than the butt joints used up until then. Each of these three inventions was designed to make the best use of iron components and reflects Stephenson’s grasp of the allimportant relationship between the rolling stock, locomotive and rail. Losh rails were laid on new or improved systems in the northeast of England, where his influence was evident. They replaced wooden rails on the Killingworth waggonway by the end of 1818 and were used on the Wallsend waggonway by 1821.32 The first all-steam railway, serving Hetton Colliery, was built with them in 1821–2.33 Though most of the route of the Stockton and Darlington Railway was laid with the new wrought-iron rails in 1825 (chapter 6), a considerable part used Losh rails.34 The Wylam plateway was 40\n\n5a&b. Cast-iron plate rails came in many shapes and sizes but all had in common that the flange is on the rail, not the wheel. The Losh– Stephenson patent represented a considerable improvement on earlier cast-iron edge rails.\n\n41\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY probably relaid with them in 1828–30.35 The first public railway in France, from collieries at Saint-Étienne to Andrézieux on the River Loire, made use of them, and the cast-iron edge rails sent out to Newcastle Colliery in New South Wales in 1830, the first iron railway in Oceania, were a variation on this design.36 Their last significant use was on the Cromford and High Peak Railway, completed in 1832, where they were installed by the Butterley Ironworks and by Josias Jessop (1781–1826), son of the engineer William Jessop (1745–1814).37 Chairs and sills ‘Chairs’, also sometimes known in this period as ‘saddles’ or ‘pedestals’, the means by which cast-iron rails were fixed to wooden or stone sleepers and blocks, were themselves castings, as were sills, the combined sleeper-chairs used in some locations to bed the track in the ballast and to keep the rails to gauge. Chairs for Losh rails had to be cast to incorporate the holes for the horizontal pins. Sills were first adopted in 1794 and were also used on plateways by 1805–6, particularly in Shropshire and the north-east Wales coalfield. In some cases the crossbar had a downward curve to bury it in the ballast and to avoid getting in the way of horses’ hooves.38 Wooden components The all-wooden waggonways in the north-east of England described in the previous chapter were on the verge of becoming design-expired by the 1790s, but were still being built. The Lambton, built in 1770, was the last major wooden ‘way’, but a branch put in to the D pit between 1789 and 1791 was laid with wooden rails.39 Others continued to operate unchanged for many years to come, even in some cases into the 1840s.40 Where traffic was light or the cost of replacement prohibitive, wooden rails remained a rational choice. As 42\n\n‘ Rails best adap ted to the road’ a short-term solution, George Stephenson was prepared to run locomotives on wooden rails, where their main problems were friction on curves and adhesion on any sort of gradient in wet weather.41 The very earliest systems built in North America, from 1795 onwards, were entirely wooden.42 So was the first railway in Australia, laid in a colliery at Newcastle in the Colony of New South Wales sometime between 1824 and 1829.43 As noted in the Introduction, purely wooden rails lasted long and late in some circumstances. By adding a cast-iron strap along the running surface, such as Joseph Banks observed at Coalbrookdale, rolling resistance could be significantly reduced, and later wrought iron, even steel, could be used in this way.44 Wooden sleepers had been universal on the old generation of waggonways, and were also often to be found in conjunction with cast-iron rails and with hybrids, though stone blocks and sleepers and cast-iron sills were also widely used (see below). The illustrations to Curr’s book for instance show plates slotting into wooden dovetailed sleepers, or attached to sleepers by spikes driven through holes in projecting lugs.45 Stone components Stone components have been used in British railway building since records began. Broken stone had been used as ballast in conjunction with wooden rails, though other materials might also suffice, such as furnace slag, clinker or cinders.46 An innovation of the cast-iron period was the use of shaped stone blocks to support rails instead of wooden sleepers, first noted in South Wales in 1792 and used on a plateway from Crich limestone quarries in Derbyshire to the Cromford Canal a year or two later.47 This was also the work of Benjamin Outram, who recommended that they be ‘not less than 8, nor more than 12 inches in thickness . . . their shape not material, so as they have a flat bottom to rest upon, and a small portion of their upper surface level’.48 It is no surprise that stone blocks became near 43\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY universal on railways for many years to come, even after cast iron had given way to wrought iron in the 1830s. In some circumstances, stone sleepers extending under both sets of rail were to be found. Slate slabs lent themselves to this use. Iron railways and roads developed in close association, and the modern distinction between the two would not necessarily have been drawn at the time. A number of railways from the cast-iron era were operated like a turnpike, sometimes to the extent of sharing a formation (chapter 3), and some canal acts permitted tributary railways or ‘stone roads’, alternative but related technologies. In 1793, for instance, the engineer William Jessop, then best known for his work on canals, considered whether the owner of Penrhyn slate quarry in North Wales should build a ‘stone road on a regular declivity . . . to be used with Carriages with Cast Iron Cylindrical Wheels’ to the harbour. Jessop preferred a 2’ 6” (762 mm) gauge plateway, on the grounds that, though a stone road would be cheaper, it would entail a cost in transhipping slate from whatever vehicles were used in the quarry itself.49 Other proposals were more in the nature of a technical hybrid. A fanciful scheme had been put to the Society of Arts by Richard Lovell Edgeworth (1744–1817) ‘about the year 1768’. Edgeworth, an AngloIrishman whose wealth and social standing insulated him from having to turn his ideas into practical reality, was acquainted with Joseph Banks from a series of weekly meetings of ‘men of real science and distinguished merit’ in London coffee houses and had surely listened to him discuss his visit to Coalbrookdale.50 Edgeworth proposed iron railways running along public roads for trains of four or five baggage waggons, which won him a gold medal from the Society for the Encouragement of Arts and Manufactures but no more, and thereafter he experimented with wooden or iron-strapped railways for carrying limestone and peat. Then in 1802 he came up with an idea for an experimental four-track railway to be laid on the main roads from London for a distance of 10 or 12 miles, the inner ones to carry waggons, the outer ones for wheeled platforms on which chaises, carriages and stagecoaches could be placed 44\n\n‘ Rails best adap ted to the road’ and either drawn by a single horse or by fixed steam engines. Where gradients were steep, new alignments would have to be constructed.51 Nothing came of any of these schemes, but attempts to combine the technical advantages of the railway with the easy practicality of the road are evident in a document which the House of Commons ordered to be printed in May 1808. Its Report from the Committee on the Highways of the Kingdom showed how thinking about roads and railways was beginning to overlap. What exercised the committee most was the optimal width of a road vehicle wheel, as narrow ones tended to damage the surface. Evidence was heard from a number of people, including William Jessop and Edgeworth. A ‘Country Gentleman’ observed that a ‘stone railway’ required a groove to accommodate the wheel, as a raised notch in the stone would be destroyed by the wheel rim. Mr Adam Walker, of Hayes in Middlesex, advocated a ‘single railway’, in which one set of wheels ran on flat cast-iron plates about a foot wide, and the other ran on the ordinary road surface, until money could be found to lay a second set of plates. This would serve carts, coaches, chaises and gigs, as waggons and pack horses would, he suggested, run on the road. A raised bank by the side would serve as a flange and stop vehicles from straying. Others raised the possibility of laying cast-iron or stone railways along the sides of main roads.52 In Scotland, cast-iron plates were laid on an ordinary road between Glasgow and Port Dundas in 1816.53 A number of stoneways were built in England with two sunken wheel tracks, and a path for draught animals between them. Some ran on dedicated routes. One such connected the West India Docks with London and ran along the Commercial Road. It was completed in 1830 and was 7 foot wide with a horse-path 4 foot wide in the middle, enabling it to support, and perhaps offer minimal guidance to, vehicles of very different sizes.54 Other proposals never came to fruition. In 1833–4 there was talk of introducing stoneways on the London to Holyhead Road, again perhaps with some minimal form of guidance, for steam road coaches, following a trial observed by Telford and other 45\n\nTHE COMING OF THE RAILWAY distinguished engineers. Proponents also urged the laying of ‘Granite Tramways, not off, but on Common Roads’.55 Investors did not bite.56 Remarkably, several railways were built in which stone was used for the rails themselves. Carved stone rut-ways may have been the earliest form of railway in antiquity; they made a brief reappearance in the 1820s, with and without iron elements.57 Three significant stone railways were built. One was in the United Kingdom, in effect a stone plateway which was built in 1820 to carry granite from quarries on Dartmoor to the Stover Canal, following the award of a contract to supply stone for the new London Bridge. It ran eight and a half miles from Haytor and Holwell quarries down to the Stover Canal, a descent of some 1,300 feet (396 m). The rails were cut from granite blocks, an upstand providing the guidance. At points, pivoted iron tongues guided the waggons.58 The other two were in the United States, and both used wroughtiron strips laid on the stones. The Granite Railway, so called, at Quincy, Massachusetts, connected a quarry with a river wharf from 1826, and is described in the following chapter, whereas the Baltimore and Ohio, which opened its first section in 1830, belongs with the other firstgeneration main lines discussed in chapter 11, though both bear witness to the way in which stone track components were regarded as a useful technology in a country where imported iron was very expensive. Monorails A number of monorail systems were constructed in this period, though with little success. They are more commonly associated with the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and are a muchvaunted technology which has rarely proved itself to be particularly effective. Their claimed advantages are that they can run on pillars or columns without expensive earthworks and that the use of just one rail will reduce friction. In practice, maintenance is costly and most systems rely on additional guide rails. At a time when railway 46\n\n‘ Rails best adap ted to the road’ technology was going through such a period of experimentation, it is not surprising that monorails should have been patented, nor even that the first English patentee should have been the Bavarian Joseph von Baader, a restless and enquiring individual who had studied at Göttingen and Edinburgh, and who in 1790 had spent six months as manager of an ironworks in Wigan. He secured the patent on a return visit to England in 1815 and published a depiction of his proposed system in 1822. The vehicles were to be supported above rail level, running on vertical wheels on a 24-inch (610 mm) wide cast plate supported on piles sunk into the ground, and guided by horizontal wheels on either side of a downward flange. He claimed it could be powered by a ‘nimble-footed dog’, by cranks or levers or even by sail.59 The other type of monorail is one in which the vehicles are suspended below, like panniers on a packhorse, and was first patented in 1821 by Henry Robinson Palmer, engineer to London Docks. A single rail of timber covered by a cast- or wrought-iron plate supported a double-flanged wheel and was itself carried on pillars, which Palmer recommended be of cast iron, at intervals of 9 or 10 foot. Like Baader, Palmer promised great things for his system, claiming that it would enable a horse to pull 20 tons (20321 kg) along it, rather than 11 on an edge railway and 6 on a plateway, on the basis of trials he had conducted for Thomas Telford. He may have thought that halving the number of rails and wheels would reduce rolling resistance accordingly. Two were bu"
