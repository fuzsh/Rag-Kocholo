        "text": "An effort to provide biographies of the \"nameless\" women who followed the armies of the War for American Independence. Names Project: Purpose, Methodology, and Contributions The aim of this project is to compile names and biographies of women attached to the military forces of the War for American Independence, 1775 to 1783; Whig (Continental), French, Spanish, British, German, and Loyalists. This includes females (and their offspring) who followed the troops on campaign, or served in a camp, garrison, or other settled military post (including artificers and other military support groups). Spouses and retainers of both enlisted men and officers are eligible. The project will begin with Continental army and Whig militia female followers. Eventually, my hope is to convince people with special knowledge of the other nations' armies involved to participate. Material may be sent to the editor at ju_rees@msn.com or via Facebook messaging (John U. Rees). Names must be accompanied by supporting source material and a transcription of the same. Please include available pension narratives and as much detail from other sources as is available. Contributors will be listed with their submissions. Appended is the recommended structure for entries (formulated by Eliza West, revised by John Rees):\n\nSpecial note pertaining to the BLOUIN family that is a part of the Martel family in these genealogies: About 2015 (my email correspondence from the account that I then used is no longer accessible), I had been in contact with Clermont Blouin of Québec. He was preparing (and has since completed) a privately printed and distributed genealogy of the Blouins from 1600 to today. I contributed a very small amount of information, and photos, from my Blouin ancestor (Arthur Blouin, my maternal grandfather). The cover reads \"Blouin; Loyal et constant\", displaying a coat of arms. The volume is undated and there is no separate title-page. This is a marvelously detailed genealogy, unpaginated but more than 200 pp., well illustrated. Having appeared after the completion of my own genealogical work, the information in Clermont Blouin's genealogy does not appear in the genealogies I prepared. Earle Spamer"
