        "text": "Reese's Peanut Butter Cups have always been an S-Tier treat. The combination of chocolate and peanut butter in a convenient bite-size form is something exactly what you need when looking for a quick snack fix.\n\nOver the years, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups have gotten creative making them bigger or smaller, replacing the chocolate exterior with peanut butter flavoring and the slightly newer concept of putting stuff inside the peanut butter. I've seen things raging from Reese's Pieces, potato chips, peanut brittle and so much more. Their most recent variety is one I swear they made just for me. They had the notion to put Reese's Puffs cereal inside of a peanut butter cup.\n\nNot sure who thought of this, but thank you! But these are excellent.\n\nSince they use the 'big cup' which gives them a thicker amount of peanut butter it also gives it more room to add more stuff. Since the cereal pieces are too big for the standard, more flat, size of peanut butter cup it works out pretty well.\n\nSince Reese's Puffs are already chocolate peanut butter flavored the cereal taste is only kinda there but it's all texture and you get a familiar crunch when you bite into it. It's a fun idea and I'm glad they did this, even if only for a limited time.\n\nNot sure what other flavors they can do in the future. Maybe a variety of jelly for a pb&j style? Only time will tell.\n\nI found these at Walgreens but you'll see them pop up in most stores, I'd imagine.\n\nMORE: See 30 toys that every '90s kid wanted\n\nKEEP READING: Check out these totally awesome '80s toys\n\nCHECK THEM OUT: 100 years of Christmas toys, gifts and fads\n\nLOOK: 25 fascinating vintage photos of the first Winter Olympic Games\n\nThe first-ever Winter Olympics were held in Chamonix, France, showcasing a variety of sports and athletes.
