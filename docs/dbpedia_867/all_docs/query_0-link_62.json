How long was the railroad?\n\nThe 1,776 mile long first transcontinental railroad, originally called the \"Pacific Railroad\" and later the \"Overland Route,\" (690 miles built by the Central Pacific Railroad and 1,086 miles built by the Union Pacific Railroad) that started construction in 1863 and was completed with the joining of the rails at Promontory Summit, Utah on May 10, 1869 went from Omaha, Nebraska (UPRR) to Sacramento, California (CPRR), thereby connecting with other railroads from the east (for example, from Boston and New York via Chicago, Illinois or St. Louis, Missouri) to span the continent by rail from the east coast to the west coast for the first time. (Also see more about rail travel routes from NY to Chicago, and from Chicago to Omaha.) After the junction of the UPRR with the CPRR was changed to Ogden, Utah, 52 1/2 miles east of Promontory Summit, the CPRR was 742 miles long, extending from Sacramento to Ogden, and the UPRR was 1,032 miles long, extending from Ogden to Omaha. Soon thereafter, the route was extended from Council Bluffs, Iowa (on the eastern shore, just across the Missouri River from Omaha, Nebraska) to San Francisco, California, as the Western Pacific Railroad west from Sacramento (merging with the CPRR of California on June 22, 1870 or in August, 1870) became part of the Central Pacific along with ferry service carrying whole trains on the world's largest ferries replaced the boat trip from Sacramento on Sacramento River Steamboats.\n\nWhen first opened in 1869, Central Pacific trains reached the San Francisco Bay area via a 140 mile line which had been built by the original Western Pacific Railroad by way of Stockton, over Altamont Pass, and on through Niles Canyon to the CPRR's two mile long pier at Alameda on the east side of the Bay from which San Francisco was then accessed by ferry. In 1876, however, the CPRR acquired a line built by the California Pacific Railroad from Sacramento to Vallejo and in 1879 completed an extension of that road 17 miles across the Suisun Marsh to Benecia where it established a railroad ferry to carry its trains a little more than a mile across the Carquinez Strait to Port Costa from which they ran down the southern shoreline of the Strait and San Pablo Bay, and the eastern side of the San Francisco Bay to Oakland and Alameda thereby cutting approximately fifty miles off the journey from Sacramento.\n\nCharles Nordhoff wrote in the May, 1872 issue of Harper's New Monthly Magazine:\n\nThe regular route runs from New York [via Ferry to Jersey City], by way of Philadelphia and Pittsburg, to Chicago — this is called the [Pennsylvania Railroad's] Pittsburg and Fort Wayne road — thence to Omaha, either by the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy, the Chicago and Northwestern, or the Chicago and Rock Island. At Omaha you take the Union Pacific road to Ogden, and thence the Central Pacific to San Francisco. If you wish to see Colorado on your way out, you may go also from Chicago to Denver, over the Chicago, Burlington, and Missouri and the Kansas Pacific roads ....\n\nCPRR–UPRR Timetable Map, showing railroad land grants, Rand McNally, 1881 (verso, detail).

Navigation is assisted by a navigation bar (tan, see above) showing the most important links, with a search feature, and a pull down menu outlining the site.\n\nChronological organization is provided as timelines, a construction chronology, the ordering of articles about building the railroad, within the webpages of the introduction, as well as by the on-line Southern Pacific Bulletin magazine's chronological account of the railroad and in Galloway's book, Regrettably, the historic photographs were not dated, so a precisely chronological exhibit of them is not possible, although Hart's stereoview numbering may provide a rough approximation. We also have a reorganized catalog of Hart's views arranged by location or organized by Stanford Album Geographic Sequence Number. The next FAQ has much additional information about how to search and navigate the CPRR Museum.\n\nWe've tried to tell the story of the Pacific Railroad in human terms with lots of exhibits and first person accounts that visitors can relate to. It is true that the railroad was finished in 1869, long before the 1876 deadline set in the Pacific Railroad Act which Congress passed in 1862, but nobody thought it was going to be easy. Most \"experts\" in fact thought it was impossible. It was only by dint of the hard work of people like L.M. Clement and the determination of the men who risked all to finance it that it got done. It was a truly \"American\" story of accomplishment by a can do, free people in charge of their own destiny.\n\n\"I generally avoid temptation unless I can't resist it.\" —Mae West\n\n\"one day, materials that aren't searchable online simply won't get read\" —attributed to James Hilton, librarian at the University of Michigan\n\n\"You could look it up.\" —Casey Stengel\n\nIs there an index to the CPRR Museum? What navigation aids are available?\n\nYes, there are several:\n\nThere is a Freefind Search box where you can type in keywords to search this Museum website:\n\nThe FreeFind search engine re-indexes this website every two weeks. [There is also a another search engine that you can use to find various other Central Pacific Railroad websites, clusted by subtopic.]\n\nWhen searching, type just a very few specific words into the search box that will match what you are seeking. Don't type in a question — the computer will not understand. Be specific because searching this website using general terms such as \"transcontinental railroad\" will not produce a useful result — every page on this website is about the transcontinental railroad.\n\nThe Google Search box in the tan navigation bar at the top of this page uses another search engine, Google, in case that search engine is more current or works better for a particular search:\n\nCPRR Museum Web\n\n7/1/2015 UPDATE: Google search has been intermittantly returning error messages instead of search results, so we switched to using DuckDuckGo (which also has a better privacy policy) for the top of the page search boxes.\n\nTo find a discussion about a particular topic in the CPRR Discussion Group, also include the word \"discussion\" in the search query.\n\nGoogle re-indexes this website frequently. You can also ask Google to instead search the entire World Wide Web. You can also search just this website from the Google home page, by adding the search term \"site:CPRR.org OR site:discussion.cprr.net\" to your Google search.\n\nA pulldown menu that outlines this website (requires Javascript) is also included on the navigation bar (tan, see above):\n\nThere is a \"Sitemap\" page.\n\nThe \"Frequently Asked Question\" just above gives an overview of how the CPRR Museum website is organized.\n\nThe \"Exhibits Index\" page shows all the exhibits.\n\nThe \"History\" link takes you to an outline of available on-line readings.\n\nThe links included in the additional questions and answers below and on the second FAQ's page provide a narrative index to many of the resources available at the CPRR Museum.

However, all of the captions as published in the 19th century are available in our image catalogs which are arranged by photographer/publisher listed in order by the view numbers. On our welcome, home, and exhibits index pages, image titles should pop-up if you point to each image with the cursor and then hold it still (see above image showing a pop-up caption on the image).\n\n\"Nobody on his deathbed ever said,'I wish I'd spent more time at the office.'\" —Paul Tsongas\n\nHow can I help?\n\nWe are volunteer retired educators, and the CPRR Museum depends entirely on private funding.

This is a virtual museum in cyberspace. [Please note that CPRR.org is not located in Moorville, Kansas; and, fortunately, we don't suffer from a common museum malady, the \"edifice complex.\"] So the museum address is http://CPRR.org and the hours of operation are open 24 hours/day, 7 days/week for the past quarter century. We are deeply honored to have the author of what the Wall Street Journal called the \"definitive\" history of the building of the US transcontinental railroad describe the Central Pacific Railroad Photographic History Museum as \"the best RR website on the planet.\" The photographs, maps, documents, readings and other items displayed on this website are physically scattered in various locations around the United States, in more than 250 collections. Many are too delicate to handle. The photographs are also small (most measure 3 1/2\") and light sensitive. The restored and enlarged digital images presented here are often much easier to see than the original! (Due to the ravages of age and technical factors, each image has typically required extensive restoration and modification using digital tools to eliminate defects and achieve what we believe is the most esthetic and historically accurate rendition of each picture. Skillfully performing such magical transformations by digital image restoration requires considerable subjective judgment, artistry, originality, and creativity, as well as technology. (Arthur C. Clarke, the famous science fiction writer once remarked that \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\") We are most grateful to contributors who may have lavished hours of ingenuity on a single image to create apparent perfection from a seriously flawed original. For example, it is often feasible to improve color and contrast, modify brightness, remove stains, and recreate missing or damaged portions. We want you to be aware that the images on this website consequently are not the \"exact\" copies which many image archives prefer, and consequently caution researchers to compare original images when appropriate.) The CPRR Photographic History Museum is a family website that has been expanded with the help of people with similar interests who have submitted scans of railroad images and copies of 19th century articles and maps from their collections. Your contributions are welcome.\n\n\"... the most magnificent project ever conceived.\" —Theodore D. Judah, 1857\n\nWhat did the Chinese do when they finished working on the Transcontinental Railroad?\n\n\"With the completion of the Central Pacific, many Chinese workers moved to other railroad construction jobs, including some for the Central Pacific. Others returned with their savings to their families in Canton. Others still sent to China for wives and settled in various western communities as laundrymen and restaurateurs. The majority who remained, however, returned to the Pacific Coast.\" Some continued building railroads, for example, the line from northern to southern California via the San Joaquin Valley. Others became miners or worked in a variety of service trades. Many Chinese were employed by the CPRR at Rocklin’s roundhouse, and approximately 1,000 built water courses and stone fences at the Whitney Ranch near Rocklin. \"In December 1869, the Central Pacific launched the construction of a line down the San Joaquin Valley. By 1872 the railhead had reached Goshen. Subsequently, construction of the section from Goshen on south to Los Angeles was turned over to the Southern Pacific which had been acquired by the Central Pacific in 1870.\" \"The 1870 federal census listed about 400 Chinese in Truckee and Boca Post Office.\" The Sacramento Yee Fow Museum proposal states about the Chinese CPRR workers that \"most of them later settled in Sacramento's China Slough.\"\n\n\"Trestles & Snowsheds: the Sierras ... February, 1867, I went on the Central Pacific Railroad to build bridges on the Truckee River. I was still in debt. ... I worked all Summer at a good salary and sometime in November when I was raising a bridge at the Cascades above Cisco and had it nearly completed I accidentally made a misstep and fell from the top, a distance of fifty feet, breaking six ribs and injuring my shoulder and spine. I was unconscious until the next day and was not able to walk for nearly two months. ... The next Spring I went back to Cisco on the Central Pacific and got up plans for a machine to frame timber for the snow-sheds. In March went down the Truckee to the State line and had a gang of men getting out ties for the railroad. In May moved the gang to Cold Stream, above Truckee, and made ties until the first of June. I then got orders to go to Sacramento and have my machine built at the Company's shops. I had my machine finished by the 20th of June and shipped it up to Summit Valley. Put in a side track, where the snow was still four feet deep and soon got the machine in good working order. With six handy men it would do the work of fifty carpenters. In July I commenced putting up snow sheds and by the middle of December had completed six miles of snow shed at the summit of Sierra Nevada Mountains. At one time I had a very narrow escape. In going down to Truckee with my construction train we had a collision with a freight train coming up just opposite Donner Lake. I was on the engine, sitting on the firemans side. The trains got so close before any alarm could be given that they could not slacken speed until they collided. I was thrown headlong against the door of the fire box and all the wood from the tender on top of me. I soon crawled out and found the Engineer and Fireman both bleeding, the Locomotives smashed up, steam flying all around, the cars off the track, several men badly hurt and everything in confusion. The only injury I sustained was a slightly sprained wrist and some scratches on my head from the wood piling on me. One man who jumped off the train on some wood fractured his scull so that it caused his death. About the middle of December 1868, having completed my section of sheds, the Company wanted me to move to an uncovered section opposite the lower end of Donner Lake and put up two miles more of snowshed, which I declined, as the ground was now covered with snow and it was getting quite cold and disagreeable and would be no better before the next May. ...\"\n\n—James Abram Kleiser (1818 – 1906), autobiography ... hand-written in 1885.

If it’s not one thing, it’s another!\" —Roseanne Roseannadanna\n\nIn his 1873 book, California for Health, Pleasure, And Residence: A Book for Travellers and Settlers, Charles Nordhoff described these obstacles:\n\n\" ... these five Sacramento merchants, who undertook to build a railroad through eight hundred miles of an almost uninhabited country, over mountains and across an alkali desert, were totally unknown to the great money world; that their project was pronounced impracticable by engineers of reputation testifying before legislative committees; that it was opposed and ridiculed at every step by the moneyed men of San Francisco; that even in their own neighborhood they were thought sure to fail; and the 'Dutch Flat Swindle,' as their project was called, was caricatured, written down in pamphlets, abused in newspapers, spoken against by politicians, denounced by capitalists, and for a long time held in such ill repute that it was more than a banker's character for prudence was worth to connect himself with it, even by subscribing for its stock. Nor was this all. Not only had credit to be created for the enterprise against all these difficulties, but when money was raised, the material for the road — the iron, the spikes, the tools to dig, the powder to blast, the locomotives, the cars, the machinery, every thing — had to be shipped from New York around Cape Horn, to make an expensive and hazardous eight months' voyage, before it could be landed in San Francisco, and had then to be reshipped one hundred and twenty miles to Sacramento by water. Not a foot of iron was laid on the road on all the eight hundred miles to Ogden, not a spike was driven, not a dirt-car was moved, nor a powder-blast set off, that was not first brought around Cape Horn; and at every step of its progress the work depended upon the promptness with which all this material was shipped for a sea-voyage of thousands of miles around Cape Horn. Men, too, as well as material had to be obtained from a great distance. California, thinly populated, with wages very high at that time, could not supply the force needed. Laborers were obtained from New York, from the lower country, and finally ten thousand Chinese were brought over the Pacific Ocean, and their patient toil completed the work.\"\n\n\" ... the plural of 'anecdote' is not 'data.' \" —Jon \"Hannibal\" Stokes\n\n\"Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of truth and knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.\" —Albert Einstein\n\n\"Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.\" —Aldous Huxley\n\n\"For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.\" —Nobel laureate Richard Feynman\n\n\"Alice laughed.

Morgan\n\nIt is a common yet deadly myth that while trespassing on train tracks you can hear the train coming before it kills you.\n\nWhat are some common incorrect rumors, errors, or myths about the Central Pacific Railroad?\n\nThe rails were joined on May 10, 1869 (not May 8th as engraved on the golden spike) at Promontory Summit, Utah, north of the Great Salt Lake, NOT at Promontory Point, but correcting this may be a lost cause as Promontory Summit was often called Promontory or Promontory Point in 1869. (Promontory Point at the southern rocky tip of a peninsula jutting southward into the lake from its northern shore, 30 miles farther south [ ... and the confusion gets worse! – with the Lucin cutoff, the railroad was moved South decades later to go through Promontory Point and across the Great Salt Lake on a causeway, not North around the Lake through Promontory Summit as it originally did – and early maps show yet a third abandoned route South around the Lake as originally planned, but not as built]). There were several gold and silver ceremonial spikes that would have been squashed if hit with a sledgehammer (and matching laurel wood last tie with predrilled holes for these spikes), but the actual last spike was iron, and it is disputed whether Stanford and Durant really did swing and miss, but there is a first hand account that confirms this tale. \"It was the tappng of an ordinary iron hammer in the hands of Governor Leland Stanford on an ordinary iron spike that formed the electric contact which flashed the telegraphic message over the country, May 10, 1869, that the last link had been made in the rail lines of the first transcontinental railroad.\" The golden last spike wasn't stolen in the 19th century, it was donated to the Stanford University Museum, but the spike there now apparently does not match photographs of the original gold spike donated by David Hewes. There are a number of other often repeated stories and factual details about the CPRR that are probably untrue. For example, claims of \"thousands killed\" in construction accidents appear likely to be greatly exaggerated (for example, there were no more than two fatalities in building the summit tunnel – nitroglycerine made on site was used there with surprising safety), and the Chinese workers who came to California (they called San Francisco \"Old Gold Mountain\") were lured by the gold rush and recruited by advertisements, experienced considerable anti-Chinese sentiment and discrimination, but no Chinese CPRR workers were ever slaughtered following completion of the CPRR to avoid paying them (perhaps a rumor resulting from confusion with the 1871 Los Angeles riot, the expulsion of Chinese lumbermen from Truckee, 1878-86 [with the railroad interests apparently resisting and eventually switching to coal to boycott the whites] or the 1885 Rock Springs, Wyoming Massacre of Chinese miners), and they were not \"slave laborers\" like many of the \"coolies\" sent to South America and the Caribbean in earlier generations, and did most of the labor in building the CPRR, for which they were paid in gold coin; it is not true that no photograph taken at Promontory on May 10, 1869 showed Chinese workers; nor that the Chinese workers were excluded from the celebrations at Promontory – in fact the San Francisco Newsletter, reported on May 15th, 1869 that \"J.H. Strobridge, when the work was all over, invited the Chinese who had been brought over from Victory for that purpose, to dine at his boarding car. When they entered, all the guests and officers present cheered them as the chosen representatives of the race which have greatly helped to build the road ... a tribute they well deserved and which evidently gave them much pleasure.\", the Central Pacific Railroad never went into bankruptcy as often claimed and repaid its bonds in full by 1909; Bloomer Cut was not named after the bloomer costume (19th century ladies' trousers); the \"Big Four\" were actually five in number (brother E.B. Crocker who had a stroke just after the completion of the railroad is often forgotten) and got very rich only after taking on enormous personal financial risk and years of herculean labors — various government authorized bonds (which had to be repaid) were issued only after demonstrated construction accomplishment, but the government did not subsidize the construction, except by providing land grants which consisted in the west mostly of almost worthless and unsaleable arid land (any later value to the CPRR of a small portion of these granted lands was largely the result of the successful railroad construction and similarly benefited the U.S. government which retained ownership of the half of the checkerboard land parcels that were not granted to the railroad); there were no wicker baskets on the ends of the ropes used to lower the Chinese workers down the (non-vertical) slope at Cape Horn to blast a ledge (the origin of this wicker basket fable has been meticulously documented); the UPRR Irish and CPRR Chinese workers who never even worked near one another in Utah (where Mormon contractors were used by both railroads) didn't try to blow up one another, the crew that laid ten miles of track in one day near Promontory Summit, Utah, was not entirely Chinese (the names of the 8 Irish tracklayers are known); and, CPRR Chief Engineer Theodore Judah who became ill on board ship from Panama to New York City probably died of typhoid fever, not yellow fever. Jules Verne includes a journey on the CPRR in his novel \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" (Chapter 26) but in describing Phileas Fogg's passage across the Sierra Nevada mountains includes the misinformation that \"There were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route.\" [ ... and don't get us started on the brontosaurus.] So don't believe everything that you read in the newspaper or urban legends on the internet. It would be a bad pun to consider 1776 miles of track as the ultimate irony.

The very definition of 'news' is 'something that hardly ever happens.' \" —Bruce Schneier\n\nWhere can I locate the \"Huntington Papers\" with the correspondence among the big five about the construction of the CPRR?\n\nSalvador A. Ramirez responds that between 1891 and 1894 four volumes of correspondence between Huntington and his associates were produced for private use. The generally accepted force behind their publication was Collis Huntington's adopted son, Archer. His motivation, however, is unclear. They are generally cited as follows:\n\nCollection of letters from Collis P. Huntington to Mark Hopkins, Leland Stanford, Charles Crocker, and David D. Colton, August 20, 1867 to March 31, 1876, III (New York: Privately Printed, 1892-1894).\n\nCollection of letters from Mark Hopkins, Leland Stanford, Charles Crocker, and David D. Colton to Collis P. Huntington, August 27, 1869 to December 30, 1879 (New York: John C. Rankin, 1891).\n\nOne set of these books can be found in the Huntington Library, in San Marino, California; another at the Mariners Museum, Newport News, Virginia; and a third set at Syracuse University. They can also be found in Series IV, Reel 3, of the 115 reel Collis P. Huntington Papers available on microfilm. ... These are the only printed sources, and are reproduced in a manner similar to my book [of later correspondence, \"The Octopus Speaks: The Colton Letters.\" Tentacled Press, 1982.]. The problem, as you will have quickly noted, is that the time period for what you seek is short in the above cited sources, and the correspondence one-sided. What is missing, in printed form, are the letters that are extant, between 1865 and 1869, of which the most valuable for your purposes are the ten to fifteen page letters from Edwin Crocker to Collis Huntington, writing three times a week, detailing the problems, progress, and personalities involved in the construction. These are on microfilm in Series I, Reels 1-4, of the Huntington Papers. Permit me to quote from my biography of Mark Hopkins to underscore the importance of Edwin Crocker's correspondence:\n\n\"With Huntington in the East, Charles Crocker making extended trips to direct construction, Stanford spending increasingly more time in San Francisco, Hopkins and Edwin Crocker holding down the fort in Sacramento, communications, always a crucial factor in their association, became even more critical. Whenever possible, the four continued their frequent strategy sessions, while advising Huntington of their deliberations. Edwin Crocker was designated the primary letter writer. It was not that Hopkins did not write to Huntington, but Crocker's letters were in such detail, frequently twelve or more handwritten pages, three or more times a week, he felt it was unnecessary to duplicate the effort. When he did write, his letters, in his tight distinctive penmanship, were clear, concise, to the point, and usually on one small piece of paper. During the period of construction, Charles Crocker virtually gave up letter writing, relying on his brother to be his communicator; and Stanford wrote only when he could not avoid it.\"\n\n[Note: The Collis P.

Fewer than 30 full-size steam locomotives built prior to 1880 exist in the United States, and the resulting CSRM collection of 19 steam locomotives dating from 1862 to 1944 includes five of them. They have model trains too. The exhibits include a railroad surveying exhibit with a mannequin of Lewis Metzler Clement greeting visitors near the CSRM entrance, Chinese railroad workers, the original Gov. Stanford locomotive as well as the C. P. Huntington locomotive built for the Central Pacific Railroad by Danforth, Cooke & Company of Patterson, New Jersey in 1863 and shipped around Cape Horn to arrive in San Francisco on March 19, 1864: Also in Sacramento is the Leland Stanford Mansion and the Crocker Art Museum.\n\nCourtesy California State Parks - California State Railroad Museum, Sacramento\n\n\"Southern Pacific Railroad Steam Locomotive No. 1, C.

This train operates daily in each direction and for much of the time follows the tracks of the country's first transcontinental route. More details can be found on John Pitt's \"USA by Rail\" website and there is a full route guide in his USA by Rail guidebook. When traveling during summer it's a good idea to make reservations well in advance if possible, especially if you require sleeping accommodation (highly recommended). Don't miss visiting the Golden Spike National Historic Site in Utah and the superb California State Railroad Museum which you can easily walk to from the Sacramento railroad station. [Note that this Amtrak route over Donner Pass (constructed by the Central Pacific RR) is not the Western Pacific Railroad route of the original train called the California Zephyr which instead used the scenic Feather River Canyon and also that the current Amtrak route does not follow the route of the UPRR portion of the first transcontinental railroad, the Amtrak train going through Denver and Salt Lake City to Elko, Nevada instead of through Wyoming to Ogden, Utah. (Confusingly, the Feather River Western Pacific Railroad route that is no longer used by the Calfornia Zephyr is not the historic Western Pacific Railroad of the same name that merged with the CPRR c.1870.)] Additionally, there have been track realignments of the original CPRR route, for example in Nevada, and the Lucin cutoff that goes across Utah's Great Salt Lake, instead of north of the lake via Promontory Summit. The section from Sacramento to Reno, which is also suitable for a day trip (you can fly home from Reno), includes the spectacular Sierra Nevada mountains part of the transcontinental railroad that was built by the Central Pacific.\n\nCourtesy John Pitt.\n\nOrder a copy of the Amtrak System Timetable and see a map of Amtrak stations, nationwide.\n\nNote: 5/3/2004 UP Detour: \"Amtrak No's 5 and 6 [are] being rerouted via Cheyenne and Ogden during this summer's Moffat Tunnel closure.\" [From R&LHS Newsgroup]\n\nAmerican Orient Express also offers a rail tour of the Rockies and Sierras.\n\n\"I consider what I have just now done to be among the most important acts of my life, second only to my signing the Declaration of Independence, if indeed, it be even second to that.\"\n\n—Charles Carroll, last surviving signer at age 91, speaking when the first cornerstone was laid for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, ceremony July 4, 1828.\n\nAre tours of the route available?\n\nFrom time to time, we at the CPRR Museum receive a question regarding tours of the old Central Pacific grade.

You can see original construction tunnels still in use, (#3 and #4), the abandoned Summit Tunnel (#6), the snow sheds, Lookout Mountain, Bloomer Cut, NewCastle Cut, and Cape Horn, as well as the Dutch Flat and Donner Lake Toll Road, built by the Big Four. Because the old CPRR grade parallels the early emigrant roads, from time to time you will be able to see the wagon ruts left by the early pioneers. The old grade through Nevada and Utah is dirty, rough, and has few civilized conveniences. Caution is recommended— at least TWO spare tires, floor jack and lug wrench are usually necessary due to road conditions. ... (One fellow had 5 flat tires in one day, East of Wells.) ...

Take a least three spare tires, lots of water and snacks, snake bite kit, mechanical tools for the breakdowns that will occur, fresh air filters to replace the dusty ones, know where the doctors and hospitals can be found in emergency, and, in the words of Patty Donner 'hurry right along, and don't take no cut-offs'! ... \"\n\n\"There is some real nice old (1867) grade in the 40 miles or so east of Reno.

All of that route is now abandoned, and the train goes through a tunnel under Mt. Judah. Tunnels 2 and 3 are still in use, 113 years later — those are at Cisco. Lookout Peak is still accessible, used by the fire watcher from 1874 until 1935. Donner Trail is easily followed from Dog Valley to Truckee, and then in places over the Summit.

Donner Pass route of SP - now UP provides some spectacular locations for pictures and is paralleled throughout by the [Interstate 80 Highway]. It takes a little bit of exploration to find the back roads that go across from I-80 to the RR, but its worth the effort. The best area is from Auburn to Donner Lake. Exit I-80 at Alta and follow a small blacktop road to the east; after many winds it crosses the tracks, cuts through the woods and comes out at a point where the road and RR are 1000 ft or more above the American River. The town of Colfax is an interesting spot. Exit above Emigrant Gap (the exit for Cal Rte 20), and there is a local road alongside the RR just east of Tunnel 35, where the City of San Francisco was snowbound in the 50's. Traffic on this line is erratic, but you should be able to catch a train somewhere. If you stay in the area long enough to find the picture spots, you can wait at an outlook on Eastbound I-80 above Donner Lake until you see a train up on the mountainside on the other side of the lake, and chase it down the line. Because of the all the curves and the grade, trains can't go over 35 anywhere, and it's hard to go less than 75 on I-80, so you can catch the same train at a couple of places. Railroad Hobbies, a model RR shop on the main street in Roseville always has a scanner going, and may be a source of information. Looking at Roseville Yard is sort of like looking at the Pacific Ocean - its much too large to be seen from the edges; but the replica passenger station and the engine house are close to local streets on the west/north side of the tracks. Rotaries are parked there and sometimes at Truckee, where they are more accessible.

Was the Golden Spike made of gold or was it painted?\n\nThe golden spike was pure gold (not painted), a gift of David Hewes of San Francisco to CPRR President and Director, California Governor Leland Stanford who drove the last spike. Actually, there were several last spikes because pure gold is too soft to be struck by a hammer, so it was dropped into a predrilled hole in the last laurel tie (there were also several last ties). Supposedly Stanford & Durant both swung and missed the \"last\" spike. The spike was wired up to the telegraph line so striking the hammer signaled the nation that the railroad was done. The engraved Golden Spike is on display behind glass in a safe at the Stanford University Museum in Palo Alto, California and never actually was missing. The soft pure gold spike was slightly damaged by being hit by army officers while in transit after the ceremony. As for the rest of the \"last spikes,\" see \"Where are the Spikes?\" Tom Allen of Old Dominion University summarizes: \"... there were actually four precious metal spikes that were \"driven\" into pre-drilled holes in a tie made of polished laurel wood from California. Today, at the last spike site, there is a replica of the original laurel tie, complete with a silver plaque engraved with the names of several of the Central Pacific's officers. A silver plated spike maul was also used in that now famous ceremony. The fate of the original spikes, maul, and tie are as follows: The golden spike is on display at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California along with the silver spike from Nevada and the silver plated spike maul. The silver and gold plated spike from then Arizona Territory is in the Museum of the City of New York. A second, smaller San Francisco Newsletter golden spike's fate is unknown. Finally, the laurel wood tie that was highly polished and adorned with a silver plaque, was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. ...\"\n\n\"rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others.

Today, even with competition from cars, trucks, airlines and pipelines, U.S. railroads carry more than 23 million passengers a year and move nearly 1.8 billion tons of freight.\" The railroad connected east and west so that people could safely travel across the country in a week for $100, instead of at great risk for $1,000 taking six months by wagon, perilous ship voyage around the tip South America, or by taking a shortcut across Panama with a good chance of dying from tropical disease. Railroads were America's first \"big businesses.\" (The Central Pacific Railroad was included in Charles Dow's second version of his stock \"average\" – a list of twelve railroads and two industrials – of February 16, 1885 in the Dow Jones & Co.'s Customer's Afternoon Letter, a daily two-page financial newsletter which became the Wall Street Journal in 1889.) This newly available easy, safe, inexpensive travel made it practical for the west to be part of the United States, resulted in tremendous westward migration to California and similarly allowed much less expensive shipping of goods by rail instead of by wagon causing a great increase in economic activity with a rapidly rising standard of living. California's \"rapid development into the sixth largest economy in the world was made possible, to a great extent, by the railroad.\" Leland Stanford became fabulously wealthy as an entrepreneur by betting his life savings on the possibility of his sucess in building the CPRR, and later when Stanford's son died, put that wealth into founding Leland Stanford Junior University which a century later gave rise to Silicon Valley. The ability to ship bulk commodities by rail resulted in California becoming the nation's number one agricultural producer. \"Railroading was America’s great industrial occupation for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, employing millions of people ...\" \"Chinese immigration to New York didn't begin until 1869, when the transcontinental railroad was completed.\" However, the anticipated trade between Europe and Asia via the transcontinental railroad was lost to the Suez Canal which opened the same year. Wendell Huffman observes that the railroad truly made America because the term \"Manifest Destiny\" did not first appear in print until six months after Asa Whitney first submitted his plan for a Pacific railroad in January 1845. See Impact of the Transcontinental Railroad, Changes that the Railroad Brought, and the historical readings such as the 1853 Putnam's Monthly article arguing for the importance of such a project, articles in travel guides, Beyond the Mississippi, What the Railroad Will Bring Us, or the 1883 Harper's Monthly article that looks back to explain the significance of the transcontinental railroad. Also see the California Historical Society website about the impact of the transcontinental railroad, which was not immediately realized. See \"Railroad Communication with the Pacific: Central Pacific Railroad.\" The Galaxy. 4(8), 1867. Also see the section of the National Park Service Golden Spike Historical Handbook on the Significance of the Pacific Railroad, and Horace Greeley's comments from his book \"Overland Journey from New York to San Francisco in the Summer of 1859.\" California's direct democracy which lead to the recall election of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was the outcome of Gov. Hiram Johnson's 1910 efforts to remove the immense political power of the Southern Pacific Railroad. But, \"often the Southern Pacific's corporate interests were consistent with the public welfare, promoted economic development and encouraged enlightened resource practices. 'As a result the company was a major force shaping agricultural, industrial, commercial, and urban growth and modernization.' \" The transcontinental railroads were predecessors of America's interstate highway system that was begun in the 1930's. A dispute with the railroad led the U.S. Supreme court in 1886 to elevate corporations to the status of persons entitled to equal protection of the law under the 14th Amendment to the constitution, prepared the way for the rise of powerful multinational corporations, thereby changing the course of history.** The origin of America's wealth is our unique late 18th century innovation of people owning the surveyed land, and the purpose of the railroad land grants was to transform the western wilderness into privately held property as real estate made valuable by the access provided by the transcontinental railroad and which could be sold, bought, borrowed against, and developed. (Poverty today in the third world results primarily from their failure to get this right, but fortunately, once understood, this is easy to fix and the systems of property rights and common rule-of-law which allowed the successful American westward expansion and economic prosperity is only now being understood and consequently is spreading around the world.)\n\n**[George Draffan notes: 1886 \"The court does not wish to hear argument on the question of whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids a state to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does.\" With that, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down local taxes on railroad property – and declared that corporations were persons; Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad, 118 U.S. 394, 396 (1886)). Sixty years later, Justice William O. Douglas stated that \"there was no history, logic or reason given to support that view\" (Grossman and Adams, Taking Care of Business, p. 20, citing Douglas in Wheeling Steel Corporation v. Glander, 337 U.S. 562, 1949). There were, however, the facts that U.S. Ninth Circuit Court Judge Lorenzo Sawyer was a shareholder in the Central Pacific Railroad, and that he and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen J. Field were close friends of Leland Stanford and other parties involved. \"Sawyer was uniquely placed to expand the rights and prerogatives of corporations,\" that \"what is extraordinary is the extent to which Sawyer used unorthodox techniques of statutory interpretation and judicial review in granting the corporation additional powers... [Sawyer's decisions] \"served as an avenue for the expansion of a corporate construction of economic life, the judicial approval of vast aggregations of wealth and power, and the subordination of the public trust under public utilities\" (David J.

What gave the Big Four and Washington D.C. the idea for the transcontinental railroad? Why did they think it was important? Why did they decided to build a railroad? How was the Transcontinental Railroad a Turning Point in History? Why was the Transcontinental Railroad built?\n\nThe Big Four were merchants in Sacramento and knew about 19th century travel — how slow, difficult, and dangerous it was to cross the continent on the overland trails, hardships of life along the trail, to cross Nevada and reach California. They wanted to connect the east and west coasts and to make it easier to trade with the east coast and open up transcontinental trade with Asia. The discovery of gold in 1849 (150 million ounces of gold came from California in the 19th century) also started the gold rush and lead to the building of the transcontinental railroad, which also used hydraulic gold mining construction methods. Like the present day Silicon Valley visionaries, they were the great entrepreneurs of their day and used both business savvy and engineering genius — It was the greatest engineering project of the 19th century, permitting transcontinental travel in 6 days instead of 6 months and allowed the United States to expand across the entire continent and to become a world power. They wanted to get very rich while building a railroad, and succeeded at both while helping to build a great nation and an enormously successful California economy.\n\n\"Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. ...\n\nError of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it ...\n\nThat government is best which governs least. ...\n\nAll eyes are opened or opening to the rights of man. ... \"\n\n— Thomas Jefferson, in a letter, 1814\n\nWhat did the Pacific Railroad Act do for the Transcontinental Railroad?\n\nThe first Pacific Railroad Act was signed by former railroad lawyer, President Abraham Lincoln in 1862. The Pacific Railroad Acts formed the Union Pacific Railroad, authorized the route to be constructed by the Central Pacific Railroad and the Union Pacific Railroad, and provided funding for the transcontinental railroad in the form of government bonds (which had to be repaid with interest) and land grants (half the land for the railroads and half for the government in a checkerboard pattern so both would benefit financially when the initially almost worthless land would become valuable [in places where water was available] after the railroad was constructed). Williams' Pacific Tourist, 1877, has advertisements regarding lands for sale from $1 - $10 per acre according to location (see pages 282, 283, and 284). Also see the Land Office Reports of 1861 & 1862.\n\nLand Grant Checkerboard Maps\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\n\"85% of statistics are invented\" —Unknown\n\n... and the other half are wrong —John P. A. Ioannidis\n\nThe $64,000 question: How much did it cost; in dollars and land grants, to build the first transcontinental railroad? ... Total price of the railroad?\n\nIt was not in the railroads' interests to retain all the financial information relating to profitability (although many records are available), and the market value of railroad bonds and lands varied greatly, so accurate answers are not possible:\n\n\"For years after the completion of the transcontinental, the cost of financing new construction and of maintaining and operating the system continued to be a problem. The associates were slow in realizing any substantial profits from the road itself. The first real money they made came from their various construction companies, the earliest of which was the Crocker organization. But the profits from this firm were insignificant compared to the fortunes piled up under its successor, the Contract and Finance Company. This company built over 550 miles of road, for which it received in excess of $47,000,000, half in gold and half in stock, amounting to $86,000 per mile.\n\n[California] Governor-[Frederick Ferdinand] Low later told historian [Hubert Howe] Bancroft that the real story of the Contract and Finance Company could never be told, because of what he termed 'inside workings.' No one on the outside could get to the inside, and those on the inside who knew the truth would never tell. Low was right: no accurate account of the cost of building the Central Pacific Railroad can now be made, since the fifteen volumes of the Crocker Company and Contract and Finance Company books were destroyed. Who destroyed them and what was the exact reason may never be known. Daniel Yost, Stanford's private secretary, said that the last time he saw the books Mark Hopkins was packing them for the company's move from Sacramento to San Francisco. Charles Crocker said that Hopkins had probably destroyed the books, thinking them not worth keeping. Hopkins, of course, was now dead and could not deny or explain the actions attributed to him.\n\nThe 1887 Pacific Railway Commissioners were convinced that the construction of the road cost far less than the amount paid to the companies working on it. After investigating the Central Pacific's finances, they concluded:\n\nPutting all these facts together the existence of a strong motive on the part of Stanford, Huntington, Hopkins and Crocker to suppress the books; the impossibility of accounting for their disappearance, except in pursuance of the act or direction of one of these four persons; the evidence of Yost that he saw Hopkins engaged in packing the books in boxes; the evidence of John Miller of their sudden disappearance, and the statement of Mr. Crocker connecting their disappearance with Mark Hopkins it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the suppression of these books has been intentional and willful.\n\nThe total cost of the Central Pacific Railroad from Sacramento to Promontory, about 737 miles, could not have exceeded $36,000,000. For this the railroad received in par terms approximately $38,500,000 in land grants and government bonds, all of which were worth far less than their face value. But even Stanford conceded that the $54,000,000 in Central Pacific stock received by the Contract and Finance Company was in time clear profit. Stanford, Huntington, Hopkins, and the Crocker brothers were equal co-owners of this company, and each received $13,000,000 in Central Pacific stock from it when it was later dissolved. With these kinds of profits described in the company books, it is not surprising that they were 'lost.'\"\n\n[Tutorow, N.E., “Leland Stanford: Man of Many Careers” (Pacific Coast Publishers, 1971). pp. 108-109. Courtesy Bruce C. Cooper Collection.]\n\n[However, unlike modern intrusive government, in the 19th century, American courts protected civil liberties, so there was a strong legal basis for the Big Four keeping their financial affairs private as a personal freedom: Mr. Justice Field while holding the circuit court, in Re Pacific Railway Commission, 32 Fed. 251 held that the Pacific Railway Commission could not compel Leland Stanford to disclose his private papers, stating \"It is the forcible intrusion into, and compulsory exposure of, one's private affairs and papers, without judicial process, or in the course of judicial proceedings, which is contrary to the principles of a free government, and is abhorrent to the instincts of Englishmen and Americans ... of all the rights of the citizen, few are of greater importance or more essential to his peace and happiness than the right of personal security, and that involves, not merely the protection of his person from assault, but exemption of his private affairs, books and papers from the inspection and scrutiny of others. Without the enjoyment of this right, all other rights would lose half their value.\" The U.S. Supreme court similarly respected such privacy protections: \" ... any compulsory discovery by ... compelling the production of his private books and papers ... is contrary to the principles of a free government. It is abhorrent to the instincts ... It may suit the purposes of despotic power, but it cannot abide the pure atmosphere of political liberty and personal freedom.\" Boyd v. U S (1886).]\n\nIn 1888, the Senate Select Committee estimated the cost of the Central Pacific Railroad at about $36 million, but this was disputed and, as just explained, the account books were never located; the cost based on testimony by CPRR Secretary Edward, H. Miller, Jr. and then Senator Leland Stanford (valuing bonds at 75% of par) was $46,989,320 (about $64,000 per mile). Similarly, the UPRR construction cost was calculated to be $77,559,370.61 (valuing bonds at 30% of par in 1873). [See Galloway, The First Transcontinental Railroad.] The UPRR land grants were mostly valuable land that could be farmed, but the western CPRR lands were largely (approximately 84%) worthless, arid, barren, and/or mountainous, and ultimately unsaleable.

The bonds were sold at par in New York, then transferred to San Francisco where they were converted to cash/gold.
