        "text": "Phillipsburg Area Transportation Chronology\n\nPlease send corrections and additions to Bill McKelvey at mckelvey@lhry.org.\n\nPosted on LHRy website on 21 March 2018\n\nThis work was begun early in 1996 when it became apparent to Friends of the New Jersey Transportation Heritage Center members and the United Railroad Historical Society that Phillipsburg was a far superior location for the state museum than any of the several other locations under consideration at the time by the New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Museum Commission. The research was performed by the editor to demonstrate the phenomenal transportation history of the area - generally within a 15 mile radius. The first installment was published in Vol. 5, No. 5, December, 1996 of New Jersey Transport Heritage, the bulletin/newsletter of the Friends organization. It became a regularly appearing serial in Transport Heritage until Vol. 14, No. 6, December 2005, when it became apparent that the Heritage Center was not going to happen in the Phillipsburg area.\n\nThe editor has attempted to keep the items under each year in chronological order, but this has not been possible in all cases. Also, we have attempted to resolve conflicting dates of some events, but it is possible that errors may be present. Updated to June 9, 2016.\n\nca. 10,000 BC The estimated date of arrival of Paleo-Indians in the Lehigh Valley area. Their seasonal hunting grounds began to be connected by a series of trails, 12 to 18\" wide. One of these, the Minisink Trail, afforded a route for the Minisink Indians to travel from their PA hunting grounds to the Jersey seashore. This trail started at Minisink Island in the Delaware River below Port Jervis, went north of Morristown, west of Springfield, six miles west of Elizabeth, four miles west of Amboy, through Shrewsbury, then to the sea. ♦\n\nca. 1,000 BC The appearance of polished stone tools and weapons suggests that the Indians of the area were in contact with the highly developed civilizations of Central America, which excelled in the creation of polished stone implements. ♦ Recent discoveries at the Vera Cruz, PA jasper mines seem to indicate that Indians traveled from all over the east coast to obtain fine quality stone for tool making. ♦\n\nca. 1000 AD The Leni Lenape or Delaware Indians were inhabiting the land we now know as eastern Pennsylvania. They had broken distinctly with their hunting and gathering past and were evolving relatively stable patterns of life - they began to plant, harvest and store food crops. ♦\n\n1609 Henry Hudson sailed his ship Half-Moon into what he called the \"South River,\" declaring it \"one of the finest, best and pleasantest rivers in the world.\" It was later given the name of a governor of Virginia's Jamestown colony - Baron De la Warr - who probably never saw the waterway. ♦\n\n1616 Another Dutch sea captain, Cornelis Hendricksen, explored the Delaware in his yacht Restless and reported his discovery to Holland merchants. ♦ The Dutch began establishing forts and trading posts on the Delaware River. The early Indian trails and paths began to be used by those arriving from Europe in the Colonial Period and were gradually widened to roads. ♦\n\n1650 About this time the Dutch, the first European settlers in Warren County, came to mine copper in Pahaquarry Township. They constructed a road from there to Kingston, NY over which to transport the proceeds of their mining ventures. This road, the first commercial highway built in the United States, is known as \"Old Mine Road.\"\n\n1654 An Indian settlement called Chinktewunk located at what is now Phillipsburg was first referred to on a map made by a Dutch engineer. The existence of an Indian village in this area has been corroborated by the numerous flint arrow heads, hatchets, and corn-pounders which have been found in local fields. ♦\n\n1664 The Duke of York deeded the land, which is now our state, to Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret and decreed that the region be called \"New Jersey\" in honor of Carteret's earlier defense of the Crown at the Isle of Jersey. ♦\n\n1673 The General Assembly of the Province of East Jersey passed their Public Roads Act, the first movement toward formalizing roads. ♦\n\n1682 William Penn bought land from the Delaware Indians and established his province of Pennsylvania with permanent settlements. Traditional Lenape life had been largely destroyed by the influence of the \"white man.\" ♦ The General Assembly passed an act for \"making and settling of highways, passages, landings, bridges and ferries... fit and apt for traveling\" and named specific men in each county to lay out and build roads - the expense to be met by county taxes. Under this act roads were opened in all directions. ♦\n\n1683 William Penn negotiated a treaty with the Delaware Indians, which set the basis for the later \"Walking Purchase.\" ♦\n\n1685 Thomas Budd wrote: \"From the Falls of the Delaware (Trenton) the Indians go in Cannows up the said River, to an Indian Town called Minisincks, which is accounted from the Falls about eighty miles; but this they perform by great Labour in setting up against the Stream; but they can come down with ease and speed... There are also in the Spring great quantities of a sort of Fish-like Herrings; with plenty of the Fish called Shads.\" ♦\n\n1714 Hunterdon County was founded. ♦\n\n1720's The first European families settled in the Lehigh Valley. ♦\n\n1722 Samuel Coates operated a ferry from Lambertville, NJ across the Delaware River in conjunction with John Wells on the New Hope, PA side.\n\n1726 The Durham Iron Co. was organized to erect a blast furnace for the manufacture of charcoal pig iron and casting of various items.\n\n1727 Commercial navigation on the Delaware and Lehigh Rivers began. ♦ James Logan was the leading partner in an iron works which commenced operating at Durham Furnace, a few miles south of the forks of the Delaware. The other key owner was William Allen, founder of Allentown. The Durham Furnace produced shot and shells for British and colonial forces fighting in the French and Indian War, and during the American Revolution it produced both cannon and ammunition for th Continental Army. During both of these conflicts Durham furnace was managed by George Taylor, who became a signer of the Declaration of Independence and a prominent patriot leader. ♦\n\n1730's Much of the land of the Lehigh Valley had been granted by the younger Penns to an assortment of friends, relatives and creditors. ♦\n\n1732 Emanuel Coryell arrived at Lambertville, bought the ferry and was granted a patent to operate on Jan. 7th of the next year by King George II. The ferry became known as Coryell's and the towns on either side of the river were also named Coryell's Ferry.\n\n1737 The \"Walking Purchase\" settled ownership of the Lehigh Valley, but it cheated the Indians and marked the end of their friendly and trusting relations with the English. James Logan was the chief negotiator with the Lenape Indians. ♦\n\n1738 The Township of Greenwich was incorporated. Their major village is Stewartsville.\n\n1739 David Martin, a ferry operator from Trenton, obtained the first grant for ferrying (\"horses, cows, sheep, mules, etc.\" between Phillipsburg and Easton) at the forks of the Delaware. ♦\n\n1740 Bethlehem of Pennsylvania was founded on Christmas Eve by members of Unitas Fratrum, more widely known as Moravians. This industrious socialistic group built the first waterworks in the country. ♦\n\n1742 The Taylor Iron Co. was founded near High Bridge, NJ. ♦\n\n1743 The Durham boat was developed by Robert Durham nine miles south of Easton at his Durham Furnace. They had a capacity of up to 20 tons and were used as far north as Port Jervis on the Delaware. They also came to be used on other eastern rivers as well. ♦ A fleet of Durham boats were used by Washington to cross the Delaware River in 1776. Four replica Durham boats are used in the annual reenactment of the Christmas day crossing at Washington's Crossing. ♦ The first girls boarding school in the US was established in Bethlehem. ♦\n\n1749 Phillipsburg first appeared on a map of the area. The name is thought to have originated with the Indian chief Phillip. ♦\n\n1752 The City of Easton was founded by William Parsons. It became the shire town of the new County of Northampton. ♦ House lots were laid out and 12 families inhabited the Easton area. ♦\n\n1755 The first ferry across the Lehigh at Easton was established. ♦ The Shawnee Indians from the north fought the Lenni-Lenape on the New Jersey highlands at Holland. The \"Grasshopper War\" resulted in a large loss of life. ♦\n\n1775 55 ????(confirm with the Furnace) The Delaware Indians proclaimed war against the English in retaliation for many years of suffering injustices. The river Delaware ran red. French allies.....♦\n\nBen Franklin visited Easton just before Christmas. ♦\n\n1756 The Northampton County militia was soundly defeated by the Indians. Benjamin Franklin, agent of PA Governor Morris was sent to the Lehigh Valley to investigate its defense from the Indians. Forts were constructed. Governor Morris declared war on the Lenape and many were killed. Negotiations with the Indians were begun. ♦\n\n1760 Lime burning was first documented in Warren County. ♦\n\n1762 The last Easton conference left the status of the Lenape Indians unresolved. ♦\n\n1763 The long struggle of the Lenape with the white man ended with the near eradication of the Indians by the Europeans. ♦ Easton had 63 houses, including 8 taverns, and 250 inhabitants. ♦ The first stage line in Bethlehem began operating to Philadelphia. George Klein operated one trip a week. ♦\n\n1764 Daniel \"Admiral\" Skinner was the first to navigate a timber raft down the Delaware River to Philadelphia. ♦\n\n1769 A survey of the Delaware River from the \"great Falls\" to the forks, near Easton was made to identify obstructions and plan to improve navigation. Following this, men were employed to execute the work. The primary work was in making the Falls safe for rafts, coal arks and for Durham boats which transported flour and whiskey from the upper part of the river. ♦\n\n1771 The provinces of New Jersey and Pennsylvania declared the Delaware River a \"common highway.\" The compact provided that it would be freely navigated and used by both states and their citizens. It remains the law of both states today. ♦\n\n1776 The Declaration of Independence was read in Easton, Trenton & Boston four days after it was read in Philadelphia. ♦ The first stars & stripes of the united colonies was unfurled at Easton. ♦ A portion of the American Army under General John Sullivan passed through Phillipsburg on their way to Bucks County to join Washington. ♦ In December a hospital was established in what was Colonial Hall, Easton, for Americans wounded in the Revolution, brought from Morristown, NJ. ♦ On the night of Dec. 25th, General George Washington secured a fleet of mostly Durham boats and transported his troops across the Delaware for their march on Trenton and victory over the Hessians. The location was known as \"McKonkey's Ferry, but thereafter became known as \"Washington's Crossing.\" ♦\n\n1777 Due to the threat of British occupation, the Liberty Bell was transported by wagon from Philadelphia to Allentown for safekeeping. The route was via the old Bethlehem Pike to Bethlehem and then on to Allentown where it was hidden in the basement of Zion's Reformed Church. ♦ General George Washington ordered the evacuation of the ammunition dump in Trenton. Much of the material of war was taken to the Easton-Bethlehem area. ♦\n\n1778 Washington and the Continental Army retook possession of Philadelphia and the Liberty Bell was returned. ♦\n\n1779 General George Washington visited Easton, and passed through Phillipsburg with Martha during an encampment of Colonial troops. The troops paused near what is now Memorial Parkway and Bates Street on a march to Oxford Furnace. It was believed that the British planned to capture the furnace to stop its production of cannon balls and ordinance for the Continental Army. ♦ Martha Washington ferried across the Delaware at Phillipsburg after visiting her husband. ♦ Wagons were requisitioned to carry grain and meat from Belvidere to Morristown for the Revolutionary Army wintering there. ♦\n\n1785 Bixlers, America's oldest jewelers and silversmiths was established in Easton. ♦ About this year the Roseberry House was built in Phillipsburg by John Roseberry. ♦\n\n1787 John Fitch produced a steamboat which successfully navigated the tidewater of the Delaware River from Philadelphia to Bordentown. ♦ New Jersey was the third state admitted to the Union on Dec. 18th. ♦\n\n1788 Jonathan Dickerson predicted that within one century there should be a canal formed from the Delaware River to the Passaic supplied with water from Lake Hopatcong. ♦\n\n1789 The original Durham furnace ceased operations. ♦\n\n1790 During the summer John Fitch put his steamboat in regular service on the Delaware River between Philadelphia and Trenton. This was the first regular steamboat service to be established in the US. However, the boat lost money and was discontinued after only thirty trips. ♦\n\n1791 Anthracite coal was discovered in the upper Lehigh Valley, nine miles west of Mauch Chunk by Philip Ginter, a miller. ♦ An attempt was made to blast a safe passage through Foul Rift in the Delaware River, one mile below Belvidere. At about the same time a passage through Wells Falls at New Hope was cleared, cutting travel time by Durham boat to Philadelphia in half. ♦\n\n1792 Anthracite coal was first moved down the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers. It was moved on rafts which were used only during spring floods. ♦\n\n1793 Easton's first post office was inaugurated. It also served Phillipsburg until 1853. Frederick Nicholas operated a stage line from Easton to Philadelphia for passengers and mail. It ran on a regular schedule with fixed fares. ♦\n\n1795 The Delaware Bridge Company was incorporated to build a bridge across the Delaware between Phillipsburg and Easton. ♦\n\n1796 The first bridge was erected across the Lehigh River by local boat builder, Abraham Horn, but it soon collapsed. ♦ The first regular stagecoach route was established between Easton and Philadelphia. ♦\n\n1797 The first fire company was established at Easton.\n\nca. 1800 A bridge was erected across Delaware between Easton and Phillipsburg, but was washed away shortly thereafter. ♦\n\n1800 (Nov. 28) The Wayne County Stage commenced running between Milford and Easton. ♦\n\n1801 The Legislature granted a charter to the Morris Turnpike Company, the first in NJ. This was from Elizabeth through Springfield, Morristown, Succasunna, Stanhope, Newton and Culver Gap to the Delaware River opposite Milford, PA. Nearly all the early turnpikes were funded privately, not by the state. Between this date and 1828, 54 turnpike companies were chartered in NJ, but only about 30 were actually built. ♦\n\n1803 An attempt was made to float six arks, loaded with coal for Philadelphia, down the Lehigh at high water. Two of the boats managed to achieve their destination but, with no interested buyers to be found, further mining efforts were discouraged. ♦\n\n1805 The Easton Delaware Bridge Co. raised enough money by lottery to build a two span, wood arch bridge between Phillipsburg and Easton. It was designed and built by Timothy Palmer, the developer of the covered bridge, and was the third covered bridge to be constructed in America. It lasted nearly a century.\n\n1806.The Morris Turnpike was incorporated (as the Washington Turnpike) and was authorized to be constructed between Union Square, Phillipsburg and Morristown. ♦ The Easton Delaware bridge was opened. ♦ David Martin's ferry across the Delaware ceased operation after Palmer's famous wooden bridge opened. ♦ The first New Jersey Turnpike, also chartered in this year, ran from New Brunswick to Bound Brook, Somerville, Potterstown and Bloomsbury to Phillipsburg. It was later extended through Metuchen to Perth Amboy ♦\n\n1807 Horn's second bridge over the Lehigh at Easton was swept away in a flood. ♦ Jesse Hawley of Canandaigua, NY suggested that Easton (Phillipsburg), on the Delaware, would be a good place to begin a canal running eastward to the Passaic River. ♦\n\n1810 Anthracite coal was being supplied to Phillipsburg. ♦\n\n1811 Phillipsburg contained 11 homes. ♦\n\n1812 A Finlay chain suspension bridge across the Lehigh River was completed at Easton. There were more chain suspension bridges across the Lehigh than any other place in America. ♦\n\n1813 Jacob Cist, John Robinson, and Charles Miner obtained a coal lease from the Lehigh Coal Mine Co. and attempted to market Lehigh anthracite in Philadelphia. ♦\n\n1814 Cist, Robinson, & Miner sent their first coal ark down the Lehigh & Delaware rivers, but found it difficult to sell in Philadelphia. ♦ Easton's first library was built. It is now known as Archive Library Hall, located at 32 N. Second St. ♦\n\n1815 America's first Christmas tree was decorated in Easton. ♦\n\n1816 Josiah White and Erskine Hazard purchased a shipment of anthracite coal and discovered that it was a superior industrial fuel. ♦\n\n1817 White and Hazard turned their attention toward the Lehigh and obtained a lease of the Lehigh Coal Mine Co. properties. ♦ An Easton man won $20,000 in the Grand State Lottery for the improvement of internal navigation. ♦\n\n1818 White and Hazard began operations to mine anthracite coal in the Lehigh Valley and sell it profitably in the tidewater market of Philadelphia. They formed the Lehigh Navigation Co. ♦ The PA Legislature authorized development of navigation on the Lehigh River from Easton to Stoddartsville. Development was undertaken first for descending navigation only from Mauch Chunk to Easton by constructing \"V\" shaped dams and \"Bear Trap Locks.\" The operation of these locks created artificial freshets upon which the arks were floated down the shallow portions of the river. At the completion of their journey the arks were disassembled and sold for lumber. ♦\n\n1820 The first trial run of the \"Bear Trap Locks\" was completed and the first coal arks negotiated the Lehigh and Delaware rivers and arrived in Philadelphia. ♦ A total of 365 tons of anthracite coal was sent to market from the Lehigh region. ♦\n\n1821 White and Hazard formed the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Co. (LC&N) by merging their Lehigh Coal Co. with their Lehigh Navigation Co. ♦ The Seitz Brewing Co. was established at Easton, PA. ♦\n\n1822 The Lehigh Navigation and Coal Co. was incorporated as the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Co. on 2.13. The LC&N became America's first fully integrated company, owning the mines, the coal processing facilities, the transportation system and coal boats, and marketing outlets in Philadelphia. ♦ George P. Macculloch, while fishing at Lake Hopatcong, got the idea of using the lake as a water supply for a canal across northern New Jersey from New York Bay to Phillipsburg. He vigorously promoted the idea of the canal and was the first to suggest the use of inclined planes for it. ♦ An act was passed to investigate the feasibility of the Morris Canal. ♦ \"Reflections upon the perils & difficulties of the winter navigation of the Delaware & means by which these may be meliorated,\" by William Jones was published by the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce. ♦ During this year 2,240 tons of coal were shipped from the Lehigh Valley to Philadelphia. ♦\n\n1823 Ephraim Beach surveyed the route of the Morris Canal. ♦ Ark loads of coal were regularly being dispatched to Philadelphia via the Lehigh and Delaware rivers. ♦ The Delaware & Passaic Canal Commission was appointed by the Legislature of the State of NJ for the purpose of exploring a route of a canal to unite the Delaware, near Easton, with the Passaic, near Newark, produced a report and map of the route which was to become the Morris Canal. ♦\n\n1824 The Morris Canal & Banking Co. was chartered in NJ. ♦ Warren County, named for a Revolutionary War hero who fell in the battle of Bunker Hill, was separated from Sussex County. ♦ In this year, 9,541 tons of coal were shipped from the Lehigh Valley. ♦\n\n1825 The Warren Advocate, the earliest known newspaper in Phillipsburg began to be published. ♦ Construction of the Morris Canal began. ♦ A concentrated campaign by Josiah White's Lehigh Coal Co. to advertise the advantages of hard coal to the public increased its popularity. ♦ Warren county, NJ was established. ♦ In this era over 500 covered wagons passed through Phillipsburg - Easton carrying over 3,000 immigrants westward each month. ♦ During this year, 28, 393 tons of coal went to market on the Lehigh Navigation. ♦\n\n1826 The Warren County Courthouse was built on Second Street in Belvidere. It was the location of early sensational trials and public hangings. The building was restored in 1959-60. ♦\n\n1827 Construction of the Delaware Division Canal and Lehigh Navigation system began. ♦ The Switchback Gravity RR opened between Mauch Chunk and Summit Hill, PA. It was the second working RR in America. ♦\n\n1828 Philadelphia burned 77,395 tons of anthracite coal. ♦ Hazards Register of PA reported that 1,000 rafts containing 50,000,000 feet of lumber descended the Delaware River during the rafting season. ♦ Screws produced by the Phillipsburg Wood Screw Co. were purchased by the Delaware & Hudson Canal Company, under construction at this time. ♦\n\n1829 Reduced traveling rates (of $2) between NYC and Easton/Phillipsburg were advertised by the NY & Easton Line of Mail Coaches in combination with the \"New and Elegant\" steamboat Bellona between Elizabethtown and NYC. The coach left Easton at 4 AM and the boat arrived at NYC at 6 PM. ♦ The Lehigh Navigation Canal was completed from Mauch Chunk to Easton by the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Co. and opened. ♦ One of the first vessels to navigate the new Lehigh canal was the packet boat Swan which had been brought up the Delaware River from Philadelphia to carry passengers to and from Mauch Chunk. ♦ An iron boat built by the LC&N Co. made a voyage from Mauch Chunk to Trenton and back up to Easton in the Delaware River. ♦\n\n1830 The packet boat Independence advertised an overnight excursion on the Lehigh Canal from Easton to the Concert at Bethlehem with a fare of 25¢ each way. ♦ John Lequear is credited with introducing lime as a soil enricher in Kingwood, Hunterdon County, NJ. ♦ The Beaver Meadow Railroad & Coal Co., the first steam railroad in the Lehigh Valley, was organized to develop the Beaver Meadow coal mines and to construct a railroad from the mines to the Lehigh River. ♦ The Trenton-Belvidere Stage Line began operating on an 11 hour schedule thrice weekly between the two points at a fare of $2.75. ♦\n\n1831 The first trip on the Morris Canal was made from Newark to Phillipsburg. ♦ A ferry shuttle connection between the Lehigh and Morris Canals across the Delaware River from Easton to Phillipsburg was established. ♦ The first Morris Canal boats which were loaded with Lehigh coal at Mauch Chunk arrived in NJ. ♦ Josiah White was appointed engineer of the Delaware Canal at a salary of $4 per day. ♦ South Easton was laid out as a town by the LC&N. ♦\n\n1832 A cable ferry was established across the Delaware between the Morris and Lehigh canals. ♦ A Morris Canal boat was swept over the Phillipsburg Falls. ♦ Lehigh Canal boats were permitted to deliver coal to Morris Canal points. ♦ The LC&N Co. advertised for \"proposals for boating coal from Mauch Chunk to Newark.\" ♦ The first Lehigh anthracite coal transited the Morris Canal. ♦ The Morris Canal began to look for a suitable place to deposit coal at South Easton, Phillipsburg or elsewhere instead of using the Lehigh Canal facilities at South Easton. ♦ John Lequear built his own kiln on the banks of the Delaware. He ferried bushels of his lime down the river in Durham boats. He sold the lime for 15¢ a bushel. ♦ Lafayette College, Easton was established. ♦ The first full boating season on the Morris Canal was completed. ♦\n\n1833 Asa Packer began building canalboats for the Lehigh Canal and soon thereafter began operating boats on the canal, hauling coal to Philadelphia. In partnership with his brother he expanded operations over the Morris Canal to encompass the lucrative New York City coal trade. He later bought a general store and established a canal boat yard in Mauch Chunk.. ♦♦ It was proposed to extend the Elizabeth & Somerville RR to Belvidere, NJ, and from there to the Water Gap. It could then link up with the proposed Susquehanna & Delaware RR which would provide a connection through coal country at Carbondale C.F. Martin & Co. a/k/a The Martin Guitar Co. was established at Nazareth, PA. It is one of the longest surviving family owned and operated manufacturers of top quality acoustic guitars in the world. ♦ A large new canalboat, JOSIAH WHITE of Easton, was built and owned by Peter S. Michler of that place. The 16.5' wide boat was built to ply between Mauch Chunk and Easton. ♦\n\n1834 The Morris Canal & Banking Co. ordered 32 new boats for delivery on or before May 1st. Twelve of them were built in Easton, PA and others were built in Lehigh Gap, Weissport and Mauch Chunk, PA. ♦ The Delaware Division Canal (PA) was finally opened for through navigation after shoddy initial construction was repaired. ♦ The weigh lock at Easton was completed by John Cole and placed in operation. It was built upon the plan of those on the Schuylkill Canal and had a capacity sufficient to weigh 100 tons. ♦ The Delaware & Raritan canal opened. ♦\n\n1835 The Morris Canal toll collectors office was moved to Plane 11 west, Port Delaware from the Easton side of the river. ♦ The boat builders of Easton and vicinity announced a meeting to celebrate the anniversary of the declaration of American independence. ♦ Oxford Furnace became the first successful US smelting operation to use the \"hot blast\" process. ♦ John Stewart, son of Judge Thomas Stewart of Stewartsville, NJ and Charles Rodenbough, of Phillipsburg, founded Rodenbough, Stewart & Co., an ironworks to make nails in S. Easton, along the Lehigh Canal. They evolved to become one of America's major wire manufacturers, employing 200. As Stewart & Co. the plant flourished, with buildings eventually stretching 1,100 feet along the canal. ♦ Swift & Breck established the area's first cotton mill at South Easton. They purchased water power from the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Co. for $1,050 per year. ♦\n\n1836 The Belvidere Delaware Rail Road Co. (Bel-Del) was incorporated on Mar. 2nd to build a line up the east bank of the Delaware River from Trenton through Phillipsburg to Belvidere, a distance of 64 miles. ♦ The Beaver Meadow RR & Coal Co. received their first two locomotives, designed by Joseph Harrison and built by Garrett & Eastwick of Philadelphia. They were loaded into canalboats and brought up the Delaware & Lehigh Canals to Parryville, the terminus of the Beaver Meadow RR. These locomotives were America's first 4-4-0's and were the first to combine flexible beams (sprung axles) with turnable pony trucks. They were the prototype for locomotives for the next 75 years. ♦ Red Line Transportation Co. of Easton, an independant operator of canalboats, was organized with Capt. Jacob Able, president. The Red Line boats carried general merchandise between White Haven and Philadelphia and later operated over the Delaware & Raritan Canal to Jersey City. ♦ The Belvidere Water Co. built the Belvidere Canal on the east side of the Delaware River at Rifton, just below Belvidere. It was about one mile in length and supposedly had a dual purpose: to supply water power to Rifton Mill and to give boats a safer way around the Foul Rift. It's usefulness died with the construction of the Bel Del railroad up to Belvidere in 1855, which was built over much of the canal, and the mill burned down for the last time in 1856. ♦\n\n1837 As a construction contractor, Asa Packer completed the large locks of the upper portion of the Lehigh Canal at considerable personal profit. ♦ The Morristown and Easton Railroad was chartered to run a line from Morristown via Mendham, Chester, Schooley's Mountain and Asbury to the Delaware River opposite Easton. ♦\n\n1838 Congress passed a bill making every railroad a postal route. ♦ Allentown, PA was named in honor of William Allen who started a hunting and fishing lodge in the area in the 1750's. ♦\n\n1839 Ajax, the first locomotive of the Sugar Loaf Railroad, near Hazleton, was built by Garrett & Eastwick in Philadelphia and was delivered by canalboat up the Delaware & Lehigh canals. ♦\n\n1840 Lehigh Canal Chief Engineer, Edwin A. Douglas was appointed chief engineer of the Morris Canal to supervise it's enlargement. He was assisted by Robert Sayre, son of a Lehigh Coal & Navigation official. The first section of the Morris enlargement was the west end due to the iron traffic. ♦ The Lehigh-Crane Iron Company at Catasauqua entered production. Designed by David Thomas, it became the first successful anthracite fueled iron furnace in America. This development made the Lehigh Valley the most important iron producer in America from 1850 to 1880. ♦ The Lehigh River rose to a record high flood stage. There was considerable damage at the mouth of the river where a new dam was being constructed. ♦\n\n1841 The enlargement of the Morris Canal was reportedly assisted by 3,000 men paid for by the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Co. ♦ A great flood (the Bridges Freshet) occurred in the Delaware and Lehigh River valleys with water 35 feet above normal at Easton. It swept away nine bridges spanning the Delaware and damaged or destroyed much of the Lehigh Canal. ♦ The LC&N requested aid from the Morris Canal to repair flood damage. ♦ After several years of shadowy financial dealings, the Morris Canal went bankrupt. ♦ As many as 40 boats from the Morris Canal used the Delaware & Raritan (D&R) Canal in the fall of 1841. Because the Morris Canal was closed for enlargement work their boats navigated to the Lehigh Canal via the D&R (crossing the Delaware River from Bordentown to Morrisville) and Delaware Canals to get coal to alleviate the shortage at NYC. ♦\n\n1842 The first 125 ton experimental boat was built on the Delaware & Hudson Canal at Honesdale, PA, but that canal enlargement had not progressed enough to move it by canal. The boat was therefore floated down the Lackawaxen and Delaware Rivers to Bulls Island where it entered the D&R Canal and was delivered to NY. ♦ William Firmstone, George Maddock, Harry Griffith and Joseph Waltman began construction of an iron furnace and company houses at Glendon, PA with financing from Charles Jackson, Jr. Land was purchased and water power was rented from the LC&N. ♦\n\n1843 A breach in the Morris Canal at Port Delaware broke through the embankment and emptied itself into the Delaware (ca. 7.18). ♦ The Glendon Iron Co. was founded by Charles Jackson, a prominent merchant from Boston. Its furnaces were constructed and operated by William Firmstone, a noted English ironmaster. ♦ Boatmen on the Lehigh Canal tied up several hundred boats between Easton and Freemansburg and went on strike. ♦\n\n1844 Glendon furnace, which later became known as Glendon Iron Co., was \"blown in.\" The excellent quality of their iron was attributed to their use of magnetite ore from the Hibernia Mine in Morris County. Up to 500 tons per day was shipped to Glendon via the Morris and Lehigh canals. ♦ The Morris Canal Co. was reorganized and \"Banking\" was dropped from their name. ♦ The Swift & Breck cotton mill at South Easton was bought by Quinn & McKeen.

The Cavanaugh brothers of Phillipsburg took their boats from Port Delaware, in Phillipsburg, to Jersey City in four days. ♦ Asa Packer was one of the original incorporators of the Delaware, Lehigh, Schuylkill and Susquehanna RR (DLS&S RR) in this year. It later became the Lehigh Valley RR (LV RR). ♦\n\n1847 A cave-in at Woodring's Mine above South Easton resulted in the death of one workman. ♦ James M. Porter, a prominent Easton lawyer, was elected the first president of the DLS&S RR. ♦ The Somerville & Easton RR was incorporated to build a railroad from Somerville to the Delaware River opposite Easton, PA.

The branch was never built. ♦\n\n1848 Outlet locks and a cable ferry were completed between New Hope, PA and Lambertville, NJ to allow Delaware Canal boats to take advantage of a short cut to Trenton and New York Harbor via the Delaware & Raritan Canal. ♦ The first modernized Morris Canal inclined plane was completed at Port Colden. A Scotch turbine replaced the original overshot water wheel and wire rope replaced the earlier chains as the hauling device. ♦ Cooper, Hewitt & Co. (Cooper's Furnace) was built along the Morris Canal in Phillipsburg. The anthracite coal for the furnace came from the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Co. by canalboat. The iron was brought via the Morris Canal from their mines near Andover. The pig iron produced was moved to their Trenton Iron Works rolling mills by canalboat, for a few years, until 1854, when the Belvidere-Delaware RR was extended to Phillipsburg. The furnace output traveled a very short distance on the Morris Canal, the boats then crossed the Delaware River on a cable ferry, and entered the Delaware Division Canal. They were then hauled down to the outlet lock at New Hope, PA where they recrossed the Delaware on another cable ferry to enter the D&R Feeder Canal, and completed the trip to Trenton on the latter waterway. The Trenton Iron Works was one of the earliest US producers of RR rails and one of their buildings survives in Trenton. ♦ Central RR of New Jersey 4-4-0 steam locomotive #3, the Easton, was built. ♦ The former Durham Furnace property was acquired by Joseph Whittaker & Co. who built two new anthracite furnaces at the mouth of Durham Creek to take advantage of coal which could be supplied by the Delaware Canal. ♦ The J.R. Templin Iron & Brass Foundry was established in Phillipsburg. ♦ Robert M. Jones of Wales came to Bangor, PA as an immigrant and began the slate quarrying industry. The region became a major world center for slate. From this area came slate for roofs and old time school slate boards. ♦ A new campaign was started to complete the Bel Del RR to Phillipsburg. It was backed in large part by the Trenton Iron Works, which had blast furnaces in the neighborhood of Phillipsburg. The Camden & Amboy RR was given legislative permission to subscribe to $500,000 of Bel Del stock, and work was begun on the line. The Camden & Amboy finally wound up as owner of practically all the stock. The Bel Del also issued over $2,000,000 in bonds, which were guaranteed by the Camden & Amboy.\n\n1849 Ashbel Welsh released his Report of the Location of the Belvidere Delaware Railroad, with the Estimate. ♦ The Morris Canal Company considered and was authorized to build an aqueduct or bridge over the Delaware River to access Easton and the LC&N. One month later both NJ and PA gave the Delaware, Lehigh, Schuylkill and Susquehanna RR the power to build a bridge for railroad purposes only, at or near Easton, crossing the Delaware. The Morris Canal instead deepened the cable ferry channel to 5 feet. ♦ Trenton & Lehigh Transportation Co. was incorporated to transport goods, wares, and merchandise from White Haven to Philadelphia and New York via the Lehigh, Delaware and D&R Canals. ♦ A boatmen's strike against the Lehigh & Delaware Canals occurred at Easton. ♦ From a travelers description: \"We passed through the long single street of the ancient village of Phillipsburg, which tradition says was laid out long before Easton was thought of, and which now contains some 30 or 40 homes, scattered in straggling order over a distance of a half a mile.\" ♦ The Lehigh mining companies sent 801,246 tons of coal to market - 580,934 tons via the Delaware Division Canal and 105,000 tons via the Delaware & Raritan Canal Feeder. ♦ The Stiles-Thomas store was built to cater to the grain trade on the canal. The building remains at #96 So. Main St., Phillipsburg. ♦\n\n1850 A flood brought the level of the Delaware River 35 feet above normal water level at Easton. ♦ The Easton Gas Co. was incorporated. ♦ Construction of the Bel-Del RR was begun under the direction of Ashbel Welch, a civil engineer of considerable ability. Welch had been in charge of the construction of the D&R Feeder Canal and became the superintendent and chief engineer of the Bel-Del. He went on to become the chief engineer of the D&R Canal and the Camden & Amboy RR. ♦ The Cooper Hewitt furnace at Phillipsburg yielded 235 tons of iron in one week, a US record. ♦ The Somerville & Easton RR (CNJ) extension from Whitehouse to Phillipsburg was begun under James Laurie, Chief Engineer, a founder and first president of the American Society of Civil Engineers. ♦ Josiah White, nationally known canal builder, contractor of the Lehigh Canal, and mentor of Ashbel Welch, died. ♦ Morris Canal inclined planes were rebuilt and the capacity of the waterway was enlarged. One of the makers of the plane house machinery was Templin & Connover of Easton. The old or scrap rail and machinery parts were shipped back to the Cooper-Hewitt furnace at Phillipsburg for re-smelting. The furnace purchased coal directly from the LC&N Co. ♦\n\n1851 Phillipsburg was first organized as a township. ♦ The Warren RR was incorporated on Feb. 12. ♦ Asa Packer purchased a majority of outstanding stock of the DLS&S RR giving him the controlling interest in the company. ♦ The stage line which formerly ran between Easton and Trenton now ran between Easton and Lambertville, connecting with the Bel-Del train for Trenton. ♦ A raft loaded at Belvidere with 200 barrels of whiskey was wrecked on the covered bridge pier at Phillipsburg. ♦ The first illumination by gas occurred in Easton on 11.29. ♦\n\n1852 Central RR of NJ (CNJ) was completed to Phillipsburg.

Barnett commenced regular trips on the Delaware River between Lambertville and Easton ♦ The Philadelphia, Easton & Water Gap RR (which later became the North Pennsylvania RR) was chartered. ♦ Asa Packer was elected secretary and treasurer of the DLS&S RR. ♦ Robert Sayre was appointed chief engineer of the DLS&S (he later became vice president of the LV RR). ♦ The DLS&S RR began excavation of the great rock cut at Mt. Ida in South Easton. ♦ Within three miles of Easton there were 18 merchant and grist mills, 6 saw mills, 3 oil mills, 3 tanneries, 5 foundries, 7 distilleries, 1 planing mill, 1 rolling mill and wire factory, 3 blast furnaces, 2 cotton factories, and several other smaller factories. ♦\n\n1853 The LDS&S RR began to be known as the Lehigh Valley RR (LV RR). ♦ The Phillipsburg Land Co. laid out lots on the lower flood plain section of town and began selling property on a large scale. ♦ Rail for the Bel-Del extension from Milford to Phillipsburg was manufactured at Phoenixville, PA, delivered to Trenton via canalboat and picked up there by the Bel-Del Railroad. ♦ Transport of whiskey on the Lehigh & Delaware Canals peaked at 15,100 standard barrels annually. ♦ The LV RR began to build a bridge over the Delaware River to the Morris Canal Co. lands at Phillipsburg. ♦ The Northampton County Fairgrounds opened. ♦ The Morris Canal received 222,582 tons of Lehigh coal at Port Delaware. ♦ A Post Office was established at Phillipsburg.\n\n1854 The first post office was established at Phillipsburg on 1.31. ♦ The Bel-Del RR was completed from Trenton to Phillipsburg. Access to Easton for the Bel-Del was provided on the lower level of the Lehigh Valley's double deck bridge. This connection required a tunnel under Mt. Ida. ♦ The first train over the Bel-Del, a 15 car special from Philadelphia and Trenton, arrived in Phillipsburg. ♦ The Easton Gas Co. was authorized to extend its pipes to Phillipsburg and So. Easton. ♦ A 90 ton steam powered tunneling machine for the Warren RR (DL&W) was brought to Phillipsburg on the CNJ and hauled in pieces by wagons over primitive roads to the Oxford tunnel construction site. ♦ Freight service between Phillipsburg and Philadelphia was established on the Bel-Del. ♦ The State of NJ prohibited transportation of freight on Sunday, by road, railroad, or canal. ♦ Rail postal service was begun on the Bel Del. ♦ Thomas N. McCarter became a director and council of the Morris Canal Co. ♦\n\n1855 The Warren RR was given permission to construct the Oxford or Van Ness Gap tunnel. ♦ Miss Lucrita Bradley began a balloon ascension from downtown Easton.

Blair and the officers of the Warren RR Co. published a letter to the NJ Assembly and Senate seeking permission to construct a temporary rail line over the top of Van Nest Gap due to their having a difficult time driving the tunnel through. ♦ The LV RR commenced the first passenger service on their new line between South Easton and Allentown using locomotives and cars hired from the CNJ. ♦ An excursion was run over the LV RR from S. Easton to the Thomas Iron Co. at Hokendauqua. ♦ The CNJ was extended from Phillipsburg over the newly completed LV RR bridge across the Delaware River. LV passengers were transferred to and from the Jersey Central at So. Easton. ♦ Train service on the Bel-Del between Phillipsburg and Belvidere was inaugurated. ♦ The false work and chords of the 183' span of the bridge connecting the LV RR wooden bridge with the Bel-Del on the Jersey shore were carried away by high water (July). ♦ A Morris Canal boat struck the trestle work of the LV RR double-deck bridge at Phillipsburg. The entire woodwork of the span that connected the bridge with the Bel-Del tracks gave way and, along with all the workmen's tools, bolts, etc., fell into the water. Fortunately, since the accident occurred at noon there was no one on the bridge, there were no injuries. The men on the boat escaped injury by jumping into the cabin (August). ♦ A Daily State Gazette (Trenton) reporter gave this description of Phillipsburg: \"living is cheap, rents low, taxes in New Jersey minimal, and communication with New York and Philadelphia quick and easy by railroad and canal. The place is in a high degree picturesque and beautiful, and remarkably healthy, with a population of about 10,000.\" ♦ The upper tier of the LV RR bridge across the Delaware River was opened for traffic. It was first crossed by the CNJ locomotive Lehigh with J.W. Murphy, builder of the bridge, and Robert H. Sayre, chief engineer of the LV RR aboard. At this time LV RR locomotives were both housed and repaired by the Jersey Central RR at Phillipsburg. ♦ The Bel-Del connecting track on the lower level of the LV bridge rose to the LV grade in South Easton about a mile up the Lehigh River. ♦ The 26 acre Farmers & Mechanics Institute/Easton Fairgrounds opened. ♦ Lehigh anthracite coal traffic began moving from the mines to Phillipsburg and via the Bel-Del to Trenton and South Amboy. The Bel-Del was used by the LV RR because the Stevens family/Camden & Amboy RR loaned the LV RR $100,000 to complete their line to Easton. For this the C&A RR got two seats on the LV RR board. ♦ The Express-Times newspaper was founded in Easton. It has been serving NJ & PA ever since. ♦ The Bel-Del opened the Lehigh Junction Station in Phillipsburg, below the CNJ and LV RR bridges. ♦ The Bel Del advertised two trains each way, daily, between Phillipsburg and Philadelphia. A through car was on the rear of the train. Travel time was 4.5 hours and the fare was $1.50. ♦ The LV RR was only interested in the staple coal traffic - general freight shipments were handled by Howard & Co. of Philadelphia which paid the railroad a toll of three cents per ton mile. Howard furnished their own cars and train crews and called the service the Easton Express. ♦ The Templin Iron & Brass Foundry at Phillipsburg was destroyed by fire. ♦ This was the peak year for the Lehigh Canal with 1,276,000 long tons of anthracite transported and over a thousand boats in service. ♦\n\n1856 Cooper-Hewitt & Company became the major supplier of rails and the \"chairs\" that secured the rails in position on the Morris Canal planes. ♦ The demand for limestone for the Glendon Iron Works could not be met by the Firmstone Quarry on the opposite side of the Lehigh River. The Lehigh Bridge Co. was chartered to build a covered wood bridge to replace the inadequate river ferry. The bridge was completed during the summer at a cost of $12,000.

Sayre, Chief Engineer and General Superintendant of the LV RR guided the destiny of this firm which became Bethlehem Steel for the next four decades. ♦\n\n1860 The Saucona Iron Co. became the Bethlehem Rolling Mill and Iron Co. ♦ The Easton & Nazareth RR was organized and surveyed, but not built. Years later the Easton & Northern RR utilized much of their planned route. ♦ It became necessary to extend the canal dock at Washington for transferring greater quantities of coal from the DL&W RR to the Morris Canal. The DL&W supplied the timber and the canal company performed the construction. ♦ One of the last recorded commercial Durham boat trips on the Delaware River occurred, with Isaac Van Norman commanding. Four replica Durham boats are used in the annual reenactment of the Christmas day crossing at Washington's Crossing. ♦ On its maiden run north on the Delaware River, the boiler of the steamboat Alfred Thomas exploded near the site of the present Rt. 22 toll bridge and many of the passengers and crew were killed or severely injured. ♦ The boiler of the locomotive Excelsior exploded at So. Easton in March. ♦ The LV RR car manufacturing facility began operation at S.

Sumpter was fired upon NJ State militia units volunteered to help defend Washington, DC. The Garibaldi Guards from Phillipsburg traveled to Trenton on the Bel-Del where they were assembled into larger units. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Regiments of the NJ Militia were put aboard a fleet of fourteen steam propeller canalboats on the Delaware & Raritan Canal at Trenton. Col. Jonathan Fish was appointed Commodore of the fleet. They traveled to Bordentown on the canal then followed the Delaware River, Chesapeake & Delaware Canal and Chesapeake Bay to Annapolis. There the troops boarded trains for Washington. ♦ Due to the pressure of war demands, a supplemental route from NY to Baltimore was opened. On May 6th through trains began operating via the Central RR of New Jersey to Easton and other railroads through Allentown, Reading and Harrisburg to Baltimore. In this year over 26,000 troops plus a large amount of freight was carried south over this route. ♦ Wm. Dade, a RR employee, purchased land from the Bel Del and built a home which overlooked the turntable. The original home is gone, but the property is now #112 So.
