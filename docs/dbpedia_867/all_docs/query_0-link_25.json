Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook.\n\nWhen will my nomination be reviewed?\n\nThis page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below).\n\nWhere is my hook?\n\nIf you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas, promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page.\n\nIf the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances.\n\nAny editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For a more detailed discussion of the DYK rules and review process see the supplementary guidelines and the WP:Did you know/Reviewing guide.\n\nTo post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below:\n\nLook through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on.\n\nClick the \"Review or comment\" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage.\n\nThe top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria.\n\nTo indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following:\n\nArticle length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened.\n\nIf you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING :* --> showing you where you should put the comment.\n\nSave the page.\n\nAfter the nomination is approved, a bot will automatically list the nomination page on Template talk:Did you know/Approved.\n\nIf there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page.\n\nHandy copy sources:\n\nOpen the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to remove. (It's best to wait several days after a reviewer has rejected the hook, just in case someone contests or the article undergoes a large change.)\n\nIn the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes.\n\nEdit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it.\n\nGo to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section).\n\nView the edit history for that page\n\nGo back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again.\n\nAdd a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue.\n\nAdd a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page.\n\nIf you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so.\n\nDon't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page.\n\nDavid B.

Nominator has less than 5 past nominations.\n\nAneirinn (talk) .\n\n: Article is new enough, and long enough, and predominantly soured with public domain content so no apparent copyright issues. However, I find none of the hooks interesting to a wide audience (an increasingly common issue with DYK). And despite the article title, no reliable sources seem to use the middle initial \"B.\": where does this come from? And spot checking sources, Battle 1890 does not seem to have a page 170, nor mention David Gillespie anywhere. --Animalparty! (talk)\n\nI originally used the wrong book as the source. The source I was using had combined the two books in one pdf and I had missed that. Also, concerning his middle name, I suppose you are saying that \"Death at Red Springs\". The Weekly Star. Vol. XXIX. Wilmington, North Carolina: North Carolina Newspapers, Digital North Carolina. June 10, 1898. p. 1. is not a reliable source for this? If so, could you please clarify if that is correct? Aneirinn (talk)\n\nIf that newspaper obit (including its earlier printing on June 5, 1898) is the only source using \"B\", and no scholar has used it since, then it's most likely a one-off error (typos, misspellings, and incorrect info is common in short obits from the time): note there was a Dr. David B(ryson) Gillespie of Bladen County who died in 1905 mentioned in NC newspapers, and may have caused conflation. Find a Grave uses the middle B, but it's an unreliable user-generated source and the tombstone image does not corroborate it. Since David Gillespie (politician) already exists, David Gillespie (surveyor) or David Gillespie (American politician) may be more appropriate titles in line with predominant form of name. --Animalparty! (talk)\n\nDr. David B. Gillespie (February 24, 1815–January 2, 1905), who attended the Medical College of South Carolina, [Source:Catalogue of the Students Attending Lectures in the Medical College of the State of South Carolina, Session 1837–'38. Charleston: James S. Burges, 85 East-Bay. 1838. p. 6 – via Medical University of South Carolina, Waring Historical Library.] was a son of Major David B. Gillespie. [Source:\"Descendants of David Gillespie\" (PDF). NCGenWeb.] I think it is likely that the writer of the twice-published obituary wrote 'Major' David B. Gillespie for a reason, and that Dr. David B Gillespie is named after his father, which would have them both with middle names that start with the letter 'B'. This point of contention is not really an issue; however, I find it hard to believe that people would find the initial proposal or ALT1 dull or uninteresting. It is significant and interesting that, according to Kemp P. Battle, David B. Gillespie was the first person granted a document in the form of a diploma from the University of North Carolina, the oldest public university to confer degrees in the United States. This would also make David B. Gillespie the first person in the United States to receive a document in the form of a diploma from a public university. If more alternative hooks are necessary, I'm willing to provide additional options.

I had not realized that only prose characters are counted for the 5x expansion requirement. To answer your question, it seems as if the primordial reviewer has abandoned this nomination. I should also note that an additional source for the initial of the subject's middle name has been added to the article. Aneirinn (talk)\n\nWhatever source you were using for his middle name, you weren't citing it, so I've taken it out. I am happy to take over this review, except I don't find any of the hooks interesting either (ALTs 3 and 4 are bloated versions of ALTs 0 and 1 and ALT2 is just confusing).--Launchballer\n\nYou are currently citing his middle name to Weeks (1887). I don't see where his initial appears in that source.--Launchballer\n\nCitations for this in the lead are unnecessary per MOS:LEAD. Two sources cited in the body of the article mention the initial of his middle name. One even has it written in its title. Saying it \"fails verification\" is a bit outside of the box here, so I have returned it. I changed one word on ALT2, hopefully it is an improvement at the very least. Aneirinn (talk)\n\nHis initial isn't in the body anywhere.--Launchballer\n\nWhy must it be? Aneirinn (talk)\n\nWP:V. The lead is only allowed to be unreferenced if all its content is backed up in the body. As written, it would deserve {{not verified in body}}, which would disqualify it here.--Launchballer\n\nI am entirely at odds with the previous sentence. MOS:NAME says \"The most complete name should appear at the beginning of the article to provide maximum information. Inclusion of middle names or initials... can be a useful form of disambiguation if there is more than one person known by that name.\" Which is the case here. MOS:LEAD supports the status quo. Would you please quote how WP:V supports that? It also mentions, \"A source 'directly supports' a given piece of material if the information is present explicitly in the source, so that using this source to support the material is not a violation of WP:NOR. The location of any citation—including whether one is present in the article at all—is unrelated to whether a source directly supports the material.\" Aneirinn (talk)\n\n@Aneirinn: Launchballer is correct that the material needs to be either cited in the lead or mentioned and cited in the body. The paragraph of WP:V says only that there might exist a source that directly supports the material, which isn't relevant here. For DYK purpose, the material does need to be verifiable to its source in the article. theleekycauldron (talk • she/her)\n\nThank you theleekycauldron, I have updated the article. Aneirinn (talk)\n\n@Aneirinn: Apologies for dropping this. This needs a new hook; ALT2 is still confusing, and they will have your guts for garters at WT:DYK with any open-ended first hook.--Launchballer\n\nMotibai Kapadia\n\n... that Motibai Kapadia is credited as the first Indian female physician in Western medicine to have trained alongside men in India?\n\nALT1: ... that the Indian female physician Motibai Kapadia was in charge of the Victoria Jubilee Hospital in Ahmedabad for 36 years from 1889?

I think ALT0 is more interesting than ALT1. — Vigilant Cosmic Penguin 🐧 (talk | contribs)\n\nI asked for insight on the DYK talk page because of the recent incorrect \"first\" hooks that have run. SL93 (talk)\n\nThe problem with \"the first Indian female physician in Western medicine to have trained alongside men in India\" is that's an open-ended set. Nowhere do we have an authoritative list of every physician who ever trained in India. I'd be less concerned about something based on \"Grant Medical College's first female graduate\" because at least there, somebody could enumerate every person who has graduated from that school and look at each one. I assume that's what Kavitha Rao did, or at least she based her statement on somebody who did. RoySmith (talk)\n\nWhispyhistory A new hook is needed. SL93 (talk)\n\nALT2: ... that in 1884 Motibai Kapadia's father allowed her to study alongside men in India? \"father allowed her to study medicine along with other male students\" [4]\n\nThank you all above. I took Rao's claim out as I found other women graduated from Grant before Kapadia and Rao doesn't state Indian. Kapadia may have been the only Indian female doctor in the whole of Gujarat for many years, but I can't find a reliable source. Other suggestions welcome.

The original version of the article included a lot of content about scientists proving life after death, which has since been removed. There are still some lines that are taking life after death as a settled thing like, \"The practice of tukdam involves the practitioner's consciousness remaining in a meditative state known as the \"Clear Light Stage\" after death\" The National Geographic source cited does not present it as settled, \"“If I had just casually walked into the room, I would have thought he was sitting in deep meditation,” Davidson says, his voice on the phone still a little awestruck. “His skin looked totally fresh and viable, no decomposition whatsoever.” The sense of the dead man’s presence, even at close range, helped inspire Davidson to study thukdam scientifically. He has assembled some basic medical equipment, such as EEGs and stethoscopes, at two field stations in India and has trained an on-site team of 12 Tibetan physicians to test these monks—preferably beginning while they’re still alive—to see whether any brain activity continues after their death.\"[5] Good luck, Rjjiii (talk)\n\nwhile i wasn't looking, a huge chunk of the article was removed. this also means the hook is no longer mentioned in the article. any alts?\n\nalso, the \"cultural and religious significance\" is still written horribly, and there's a citation needed tag. ltbdl☃ (talk)\n\nI yeeted a chunk of this article to assuage concerns by @Chipmunkdavis: at WT:DYK. @Викидим and Skyerise:, please address the above.--Launchballer\n\nI'd restored the material removed without good reason.

Masada Myth: Collective Memory and Mythmaking in Israel. University of Wisconsin Press. ISBN 978-0-299-14833-1, p. xxi: \"The bones of twenty-seven humans found on Masada are brought to burial in an official state ceremony.\"; pages 241-243: \"The affair began in October 1963… Immediately, there were newspaper reports to the effect that the remains were probably of the fighters of Masada, and a state burial ceremony was called for. This issue was raised in March 1967, once again, by the same Shlomo Lorentz of the ultra-Orthodox party Agudat Israel. In a blazing speech in the Knesset he demanded that the remains of the skeletons found on Masada should be given a Jewish burial. Mr. Aharon Yadlin, then the minister of culture and education, pointed out that the Jewish identity of the skeletons had not been established and suggested passing the whole issue on to one of the Knesset’s committees. His suggestion was accepted. In fact, the Knesset’s Committee on Culture and Education held a discussion with Yadin on this particular issue in February and March of 1968… On March 12, 1969, Yigael Yadin told Haaretz that he was opposed to a public burial ceremony. He stated that the evidence of the identity of the skeletons was not conclusive enough. He also stated that he believed that the bones were those of the people of Masada but that he lacked definitive proof. In response to this, the spokesman for the Ministry of Religious Affairs stated the next day, also in Haaretz, that “the heroes of Masada came there from Jerusalem and fought the war of the holy city; therefore, it is only natural that their bones would find their final resting place on the Mount of Olives, which was a Jewish cemetery during the days of the Second Temple…. on July 7, 1969, the skeletons that had been uncovered by Yadin’s excavations about five years earlier were brought to burial in a full and formal military ceremony near Masada, at a place called “the hill of the defenders… An impressive array of dignitaries (including Menachem Begin, Yigael Yadin, and Rabbi Shlomo Goren) were present at the burial ceremonies.\"\n\nReviewed: Template:Did you know nominations/The Chinese in America\n\nCreated by Onceinawhile (talk).

Re the IP's comments, the citation quote gives all the info about the funeral, and the rest of his book is about the myth. I guess the IP is referring to the latter question. I can bring some more quotes if helpful.\n\nFor context, all the sources in the article say essentially the same thing – there is only one known original source for this event, Josephus. The Israeli national myth version differs from that story in a number of significant ways. We can add some nuance to the words \"is now known to be a myth\" if that is helpful, but the underlying point is beyond doubt.\n\nOnceinawhile (talk)\n\nIt's not a question of \"nuance.\" There is no consensus - as incorrectly and blatantly stated - in RS refs that it \"is now known to be a myth.\" That's simply fake news. 2603:7000:2101:AA00:A91E:FA5D:EAB2:D6B0 (talk)\n\nThe wording that it \"is now known to be a myth\" is simply not supported by the source provided. Perhaps \"believed by some to be a myth\" or even better \"described by one scholar as a myth\" could be supported by the citation, but \"is now known to be a myth\" embellishes the source far beyond any justifiable limit. Alansohn (talk)\n\nWhat is the “it” you are referring to?

It includes a list of the notable scholars which published on this topic between 1975 and Nachman Ben-Yehuda's book in 1996, as given by Ben-Yehuda.\n\nI have read widely on this topic, including the most recent work by Jodi Magness, and can firmly confirm that there is no scholarly debate as to whether this specific narrative is a myth. Not a single dissenting voice. Onceinawhile (talk)\n\nOnce -- the statement is simply not supported by any of the refs. It's really that simple. Actually, this brings the entire article into question now that I consider it. Plus, it doesn't seem to warrant a standalone article at all. 2603:7000:2101:AA00:6043:6D87:AEA7:B5C8 (talk)\n\nBelatedly noting that the article is at a (particularly bad-tempered) AfD, and this should go on hold until this is kept.--Launchballer\n\nClosed as no consensus.

The tag was added without explanation, and the editor who added it was asked to share their concerns on the talk page 10 days ago. I have pinged them again at Talk:Masada_myth#Ensuring_balance, so hopefully we should have clarity soon. Onceinawhile (talk)\n\n@Launchballer: it looks like there was no objection to removing the tag, as the pinged editors declined to comment. My sense is that enough people have now read the article and sources, and have come to understand the topic and its context.

I have responded on the talk page with proposed solutions. Onceinawhile (talk)\n\nWhat is the status of this nomination @Onceinawhile:?--Launchballer\n\nHi @Launchballer: it would be great to have a new reviewer look at this now. There was an initial aversion to the article by some editors - hence the AfD and subsequent talk page discussions. But these challenges have petered out as concerned editors found the time to read the underlying sourcing in detail, and it seems now to be clear to all that this is a well-covered subject with many decades of academic work underpinning it. The article has benefited from the additional scrutiny, which has made it even stronger. There is more work to do to continue to improve the article, but nothing that should impede us proceeding with the DYK review. Onceinawhile (talk)\n\nYou have my sympathy, I had similar snorts when I brought Matty Healy here. (They even nixed my P05 article.) I'm looking at this now for the first time; it's certainly strongly worded but all its claims are backed up, so this should be fine. However, you do need an end-of-sentence citation for the hook.--Launchballer\n\n@Onceinawhile: Should probably ping.--Launchballer\n\nThank you @Launchballer: I enjoyed reading those articles you linked to. I am genuinely amazed that an article that has had almost 5 million views since you recreated it last year had all those delete votes.\n\nI have done some more work to the article,[8] including adding a further source which works neatly as an end-of-sentence citation for the hook (Sheldon 1998, p. 448: \"The belief system he refers to is a myth created around the story of Masada and the Jewish fighters who committed suicide there at the end of the Great Jewish War against Rome in A.D. 73. The story, as Josephus tells it, is not one of heroism. The sicarii on Masada were simply an extremist group of terrorists who had never participated in the Jewish Revolt to begin with and had spent more time killing other Jews than fighting the Romans. Modern twentieth-century Zionists, however, took the original story, eliminated the more embarrassing parts (like the massacre of Jews at Ein Gedi by the sicarii), then used the remaining core to construct a \"mythical narrative\" of heroism, sacrifice, and national pride for modern Israelis.\" Every one of the 38 citations in the article contains a version of this statement, but this is a particularly direct one.

RoySmith (talk)\n\nFrom the discussion above: I definitely do think that the recent news does impact ALT1, though ALT0 doesn't seem to be impacted by this, other than the mention of Yong. The reviewer, Bsoyka, did prefer ALT0, and I almost don't see a problem with it being accepted, other than given the recent news on Yong's financial problems, which does make me re-think that for a bit. ~ Tails Wx\n\nWP:DYKBLP suggests avoiding undue attention on contentious information, but negative developments do not disqualify a subject from being on DYK as long as BLP and other guidelines/policies are followed. As long as the article is updated, and given how Yong is not primarily known for the recent incident, I can't see how the latest incident should prevent this from being promoted with ALT0. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\nMy only concern is ALT1. I am ambivalent about the rest. – robertsky (talk)\n\nI don't find ALT0 interesting either @Tails Wx:.

I also think 12% copyvio is alright because its only like 1-2 paragraphs out of, like 30. JuniperChill (talk)\n\n@JuniperChill: It needs its own inline citation. 1-2 paragraphs of copyvio is still too much and the information should be summarised and synthesized in the article.

Also, to clarify my previous statement, I had not fully evaluated everything and thus hadn't used any official symbols (which would imply a full review). I agree that the hook needs to be workshopped a fair bit to make it less promotional, I do think however, that the hook is cited given that the article in general talks about Splitwise in the context of handling money related conversations. -- Sohom (talk)\n\nLooking at the article, the article tone may be a more significant issue than the hook. The \"Functionality\" section vaguely reads like an advertisement, which is probably not the intention but it could still benefit from a rewrite. The \"History\" section might not meet WP:Proseline and so probably needs revision. The issues aren't insurmountable, but they do need to be addressed for the nomination to pass.

The article is both new enough (having been created just a few days ago) and long enough; more than 5.000 characters.\n\nThe sources all are reliable and from mostly high-quality periodicals.\n\nA video is used within the hook, but it is in the public domain, having been created by the White House of America.\n\nBoth hooks are properly cited, with sources that correspond to their location in the article.\n\nNow to my \"issues\".\n\nFrom what I see, QPQ still needs to be done.\n\nFor the hooks themselves, both of them could work. Admittedly, both are somewhat on the humorous side, but I guess that's the point. To hook the reader onto the article. The main hook especially is quite funny (subjective view) and takes advantage of the \"Did you know that [XX]\" portion of the DYK nominations. However, the second hook also brings up the word \"coconut\", which has become a meme of its own. Regarding this I'm curious, @Spaghettifier:, I don't suppose you have another hook in mind that uses the word \"coconut tree\" in it? Maybe \"that Kamala Harris' mother asked her if she \"just fell out of a coconut tree\"?\" or akin to that? PanagiotisZois (talk)\n\nHi @PanagiotisZois: thank you for the review! The QPQ is complete here. With regard to the hook, I'd prefer to make ALT0 work if possible — it's lighthearted but pretty widely recognizable at this point, and an iconic part of the article. If we need to go with something more straightforward/coconut-centric, another idea might be using this LA Times quote from the reception section:\n\nALT2: ... that Kamala Harris is \"fully coconut\"?\n\nCheers — Spaghettifier (talk)\n\nAlternatively, ALT3: ... whether you just fell out of a coconut tree?\n\nSpaghettifier (talk)\n\n@Spaghettifier: I'm crying. XD ALT #3 is great. Honestly, I do think both this one and the main hook are about equally good, so I'll leave the final decision up to you. With the GPQ done, this is all that remains.PanagiotisZois (talk)\n\nAlthough one suggestion I do have is that for ALT3, it might be best to just omit the word \"whether\" altogether. PanagiotisZois (talk)\n\nMaybe save this for an April Fool's hook? Bremps...\n\nI will say I think this is gonna get more pageviews if it goes up before the election. I'm still gonna vote ALT0 or ALT3, up to whoever promotes. Spaghettifier (talk)\n\nI agree. Waiting until next year is overkill. I will go with ALT3. It's catchy, and also includes much of the article's pagename within it. My only question is @Spaghettifier: if you wish to have it remain as is or remove \"whether\" from it; so that it will read as \"Did you know... you just fell out of a coconut tree?\".PanagiotisZois (talk)\n\nI like the 'whether' because it a) messes with the form a little bit and b) doesn't automatically accuse the reader of having fallen out a coconut tree. Spaghettifier (talk)\n\nAll right then. ALT3 is approved as is .--PanagiotisZois (talk)\n\nALT3 was pulled from Queue by BD2412 per a discussion at WT:DYK, so this will need a new hook. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\nJust noting that I have struck ALT2. \"Coconut\" is a slur meaning \"brown on the outside, white on the inside\", and without the specialist knowledge that it is a quote (which should be attributed anyway), some will interpret it as racist. See also List of ethnic slurs and Banana, coconut, and Twinkie.--Launchballer\n\nThat's super fair. Did anyone have any objections to the original ALT1? Still works for me. Spaghettifier (talk)\n\nSpeaking as a Brit, I think it speaks to people who know what the KHive is. I have no objection personally to ALT0, so long as quote marks are added. (There's an argument that says hooks should avoid addressing the reader as \"you\", which is more than a bit silly given that all hooks begin \"did you know\"!)--Launchballer\n\nI definitely think this is different than the typical poorly-defined second person sentence, but quotation marks are fine with me.

If the IP user above me is correct, the picture will probably need to be dropped or changed as well. PCN02WPS (talk | contribs)\n\nAlso, looking again at the source, it seems as though this need for 4,000 shapes per minute is a result of this particular user's save file and is not necessarily an unavoidable requirement within the game.

For instance, the subject of the hook is Center squeeze, but the article is more about Burlington's second election. Unless you want to make it a double hook, I'm not sure if the current hook as written is appropriate or at least meets WP:DYKHOOKSTYLE regarding hooks being primarily about the subject. My suggestion would be to write a hook that's specifically about Center squeeze itself (perhaps something about its spoiler effect?), as opposed to a specific example.

I began slowly expanding V1400 Centauri on 8 July 2024, but I did not add much to the J1407b section until 24 July 2024.

I just took a look at your previous DYK entries, and this one is slightly different. Per WP:DYKHOOK, \"The hook should include a definite fact that is unlikely to change, and citations in the article that are used to support the hook fact must verify the hook and be reliable.\" Do we know for a fact that J1407b might be a free-floating planet or a brown dwarf? It doesn't seem so. Your current version says it is not a brown dwarf. This hook also gives the impression of WP:CRYSTAL. What do you think? Can you come up with other hooks or do you personally believe this follows the rules? Viriditas (talk)\n\n@Nrco0e: my guess is you are busy with school, but pinging you just in case that helps draw your attention by the weekend. Viriditas (talk)\n\n@ජපස: I could use your guidance. Could you review my comments up above? Thanks. Viriditas (talk)\n\nI am actually okay with the hook. Brown dwarf seems to not be ruled out and the crucial word \"might\" makes it facilely correct whether or not it is actually this way or that! There is even a small chance that this thing is just an extremely eccentric orbit, though the chances of this are slim to none. :) jps (talk)\n\n@ජපස: I'm with you. The problem is that the lead of the article currently says \"Mamajek's team initially hypothesized that J1407b is an exoplanet or brown dwarf orbiting the star, but that has since been disfavored by later studies\", so if we run this hook it will sound incorrect. Could you maybe take a look at the article when you have some time and make any necessary adjustments or propose a new hook? There's also the slight problem that DYK tends to favor hooks that consist of facts that don't change. Thanks, and there's no hurry on any of this. Viriditas (talk)\n\nOh, you mean because someone might think get confused and think the brown dwarf was not free-floating? It is the orbit that is disfavored as opposed to the identification of the object's planet vs. brown dwarf status. jps (talk)\n\nRight. Any way to clarify that? Viriditas (talk)\n\n... that when J1407b (which is either an exoplanet or brown dwarf) was discovered, it was thought likely to be orbiting the star V1400 Centauri, but current evidence implies it is more likely free-floating? jps (talk)\n\n@ජපස and Viriditas: Hi, yes, I've been really busy with school and other personal matters, so I apologize for the delay. jps, I think your hook is good, but I think it needs to mention that J1407b has a disk/ring system, since that is what J1407b is most known for. In that case, perhaps you can say this below?\n\n... that when J1407b (a ringed exoplanet or brown dwarf) was discovered, it was thought to be orbiting the star V1400 Centauri, but current evidence implies it is more likely free-floating?\n\nI feel like that the parenthetical part of this hook can be eliminated to make it more concise (i.e. say \"when the ringed exoplanet or brown dwarf J1407b was discovered\"), but I'm not sure if it flows any better, so I'd like to hear what you two think. Nrco0e (talk • contribs)\n\nNo worries, this is what we call the \"riffing\" stage. Parentheticals aren’t really allowed in hooks. Viriditas (talk)\n\nI think we should stick with one or the other. Personally, if I had to choose, I would not say anything about the rings/disk. The lack of a repeated transit is more interesting. But, alternatively, you could say something like \"... that J1407b is either a brown dwarf with a protoplanetary disk or a ringed exoplanet.\" jps (talk)\n\nAdding below. Please change or add as necessary. Viriditas (talk)\n\nNote, the proposed caption for the image is likely too long and needs to be trimmed. Viriditas (talk)\n\n@Viriditas: I'm leaning towards ALT1. The lede of the J1407b article states it is a substellar object (an umbrella term including exoplanets and brown dwarfs), so I think ALT2 would be confusing to the layman. I did change the wording of ALT2 for clarity since the original sounded like J1407b had either a disk or ringed exoplanet, although it still doesn't resolve this aforementioned issue. Nrco0e (talk • contribs)\n\nOk. Can you please trim the lead image caption? I don't think they will allow a long caption like that. Viriditas (talk)\n\n@Viriditas: How short does the caption have to be? Would \"Illustration of a brown dwarf surrounded by a protoplanetary disk\" be enough or does that caption sound too unrelated to the subject? If the latter is an issue, would it work to include \"like J1407b\" somewhere in the caption? Nrco0e (talk • contribs)\n\nNot sure, but \"Illustration of a brown dwarf surrounded by a protoplanetary disk\" sounds perfect to me, and if there's a problem, others will deal with it. Even better would be \"Illus. of a brown dwarf surrounded by a protoplanetary disk\" but I don't know if that's gospel. Viriditas (talk)\n\nGot it, I've changed the caption. Nrco0e (talk • contribs)\n\n@Nrco0e and ජපස: Earwig doesn't like this: Mark J. Pecaut, a then-graduate student under the supervision of Eric E. Mamajek at the University of Rochester discovered... Can you paraphrase and reword? Thanks. Viriditas (talk)\n\nSeems like excessive detail to me. The names of discoverers are also a bit of a throwback. Unless there was much mention in the media or something about attributing the discovery, it devalues the team nature of how science is actually done. jps (talk)\n\nGood point. I will look during my second read through. Do you think the lead section is too dense for the general reader? I know the body is, but it's not too difficult to get through. My only issue is that some of it was kind of boring and I thought the prose could be a touch more exciting particularly in terms of summarizing each section in the first sentence, so the reader knows what's coming and is prepared for the details. I would like to close this soon so I'm going to try and expedite this review. Has everyone chosen the best hook? Viriditas (talk)\n\nLead: It was first detected by telescopes of the Super Wide Angle Search for Planets (SuperWASP) and All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) projects in April–June 2007.

What I found interesting is how different sites treat the subject. For example, at es, the authors write \"J1407b is probably a brown dwarf that is not gravitationally attracted by a star\", whereas we take a more ambiguous POV. Just wondering what you think of this. Another thing I've noticed is that the other sites are also very easy to read and understand, whereas this article has somewhat unnecessarily complex and confusing language that talks around the subject rather than just directly stating the knowns and unknowns.

Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\nI cannot grasp the importance of the red chalk from either the hook or the article. From the article, red chalk was used to mark changes, by one or more people. What makes this so unusual that it is worth mentioning in the hook? Did texts not often get changes, or is there something unusual about the material? CMD (talk)\n\n@User:Chipmunkdavis - Ancient manuscripts aren't usually written on or marked up by anyone these days: the idea that someone would mark or deface an artefact fills most modern people with dread; that a written manuscript of the NT was, to quote Scrivener, \"barbarously scored with red chalk\" is quite telling of this even from the 19th century. The MS and how it was used is also very important in the history of printed books, as this was the manuscript used for the first ever published printed Greek NT.

Although it is usually not be possible to give all context in a dyk, one should at least attempt not to be one-sided. Part of the problem is that the article never really covers the central reason for the protests. It does cover disputes about the status of LGBT Palestinians but not the overall war/genocide that is generating the protest to begin with. (t · c) buidhe\n\nAlright. I put in an excerpt template to the war protest article and used that to populate a background. There might be a better way to include the context of what folks are protesting. Much of the news coverage for queers for palestine remains focused on the spectacle instead of actual purpose and intent, unfortunately, which makes it hard to include motives without going to broader protests.

However, some tweaking can be done, removing a couple of unnecessary information. Do we need to specify the title of the song, or the platform where the dance went viral? Wrt the article itself, I have some concerns - what makes neonmusic.com, Resident Advisor, and Whynow RS? Furthermore, the article uses two student newspapers. Once these are addressed, I will be glad to look at the hook again. Elias / PSA 🏕️🪐 [please make some noise]\n\nNeonmusic has a proper editorial structure in place, so I'm inclined to trust it. The rest are all attributed opinion. (Whynow and Resident Advisor don't put theirs on their website, however google tells me they both have editors.) Student media \"can sometimes be considered reliable on other topics\". ALT0a: ... that a viral dance in which performers mimic driving a car was performed by Amish content creators?--Launchballer\n\n@Launchballer, RSSM also says that \"professional sources are typically preferred when available.\" Surely given the big cultural moment Brat is going through, there are more reliable, professional reviews you can use to replace those student publications. Wrt hook, I would highlight that it was a viral dance from the Internet: perhaps ALT0b: ...that some of the many participants of a recent Internet dance challenge were Amish people? Elias / PSA 🏕️🪐 [please make some noise]\n\nI don't agree that existence of other coverage has any bearing on whether the student publications should be included. For what they're being used for, i.e. attributed opinion, they're fine. You're right that there is lots of extra coverage of Brat, however Apple wasn't released as a single until very recently and all of the critical reception predates the song going viral, so there's much less of it than you'd think. Surprisingly few critics mentioned it as a highlight. (Much of the coverage went on some of the tracks that actually were singles; most of the hits for \"\"charli xcx\" brat review apple\" include phrases like \"Apple Music\" and \"Fiona Apple\".) I've added one more WP:EXPERTSPS which I missed when I looked the first time. (You'd need a second reviewer for ALT0b as neither of my hooks mention when the track was released, and I'm tempted to ask them about this as well.)--Launchballer\n\nI see @Ss112: has removed the student reviews.

The review indicated that a QPQ was necessary, and I sent a ping two days ago; the editor has been editing on other pages but has not supplied the QPQ. Per WP:QPQ, I am marking this nomination for closure. Z1720 (talk)\n\nI'll make sure to get it done later today. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\n@2603:7000:2101:AA00:EDD1:6EEC:9F54:77B2: Apologies for the delay. QPQ added. It seems someone else did the age part. BeanieFan11 (talk)\n\nReview needs to be completed now that QPQ is submitted. Thanks.

Number of QPQs required: 1. Nominator has 12 past nominations.\n\n🍗TheNuggeteer🍗 .\n\nI will do a full review of this later, but for now my main concern is the hook. The claim of it being the cleanest lake in Asia is an exceptional claim, so per WP:DYKHOOK and WP:EXCEPTIONAL would require exceptional sourcing. Right now the article uses The Straits Times as the source for the fact: it is yellow on WP:RSP, which generally means it is to be used with caution on Wikipedia, and its suitability is a case-by-case thing. In this case, it may not be completely safe for it to be what supports the source. Either more independent or stronger sourcing should be found, or a different hook be proposed. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\nOkay, propose this one: ALT1:... that a tribe performed rituals in a lake to let outsiders use it? Source:TST this hook uses the Straits times, let me know if it's okay or not. 🍗TheNuggeteer🍗\n\nALT1 should be okay as the article isn't about the Singaporean government and there's no reason to doubt that the ST is unreliable in this case. The main issue right now is that part of the article appears to be a close paraphrase of the Straits Times article, so that needs urgent attention. The sourcing in the article isn't the best since it seems to rely on tourist guide websites, but for the purpose of the article it probably isn't disqualifying since they aren't used to support contentious information. As for the rest of the DYK checks, the article is new enough and long enough and a QPQ has been provided. In addition for the need to resolve the close paraphrasing, the article could also use a copyedit. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\nOne final suggestion: as the claim of it being the cleanest lake in Asia is an exceptional claim, and I do not believe that the sources provided are exceptional sources, my suggestion would be to make the statement in the article less definitive. Something like \"The Straits Times stated that the lake is reputed...\" or wording to that effect. Maybe Launchballer can help out here with the wording and copyediting? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\nA possible alternate wording of ALT1, if for whatever reason it does not pass scrutiny, could be something like:\n\nALT3 ... that prior to allowing outsiders to visit Kayangan Lake, the Tagbanwa tribe performed a ritual to seek permission from nature spirits?\n\nIt's much longer than ALT2 and I think ALT2 is still suitable, this is just a backup option. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\nI will take a look at this when I'm done with Talk:Megan Barton-Hanson/GA1, and I'll get to that when I'm feeling a little more clear-headed. (There's clearly something big there I'm not seeing.)--Launchballer\n\nI am really not liking some of the sources used in this article - Journey Era, Philippinetravels.ph, and Richandsunnytravels.ph are all WP:SPS blogs and Guidetothephilippines.ph is a travel agency. What makes them reliable?--Launchballer\n\nThey're travel websites that give information about the subject. They aren't ideal, but it's often the case that coverage about less well-known Philippine destinations are lacking. As long as they aren't being used to support contentious information, as in what they're saying is uncontroversial and unlikely to be made up, I don't necessarily see them as a problem for DYK purposes. This isn't aiming for FA or even GA. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\nHaving said that, the claim of it being the cleanest lake in Asia is an exceptional claim, and I'm not comfortable with how it is currently presented as a fact in the article. As stated above, my suggestion would be for it to be attributed to the Straits Times, while also making the presentation less definite. If this isn't addressed, I can't see this article running on DYK since that statement will likely be challenged at WT:DYK and/or WP:ERRORS. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions)\n\n@TheNuggeteer: Please address the concerns raised above; the nomination may be marked for closure if they are not resolved.

I'll leave it to you to decide whether he constitutes an WP:EXPERTSPS or not.--Launchballer\n\nAh yes, I never thought about reading that article. It's very useful for readers. I have heard of roads.org.uk but never thought about them publishing a ZEZ article. JuniperChill (talk)\n\nYou might want to do something about the unsourced content in this.
