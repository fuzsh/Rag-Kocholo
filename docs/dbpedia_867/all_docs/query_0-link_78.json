Baptists emphasize a @@believer's baptism by full immersion@@, which is performed after a profession of faith in Jesus </wiki/Jesus> as Lord and Savior. A @@congregational governance system gives autonomy to individual local Baptist churches,@@ which are sometimes associated in organizations such as the Southern Baptist Convention </wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention>. In the late 1990s, there were about 43 million Baptists worldwide with about 33 million in the United States </wiki/United_States>.\\nBeliefs\\nBaptist churches do not have a central governing authority, resulting in a wide range of beliefs from one Baptist church to another. Baptist distinctives are beliefs that are common among Baptist churches, some of which are also shared with many other post-reformational </wiki/Protestant_Reformation> denominations.\\n\\n@@Baptist distinctives acrostic@@\\nThis backronym </wiki/Backronym> is used by some Baptist churches as a summary of the distinctives or distinguishing beliefs of Baptists.\\nBiblical authority \\nAutonomy of the local church \\nPriesthood of all believers \\nTwo ordinances (baptism and communion) \\nIndividual soul liberty \\nSeparation of Church and State \\nTwo offices of the church (pastor and deacon) \\n\\nBiblical authority\\nAuthority of the Scriptures or sola scriptura </wiki/Sola_scriptura> states that the Bible is the only authoritative source of God's truth in contrast to the role of Apostolic tradition in the Roman Catholic Church. Any view that cannot be directly tied to a scriptural reference is generally considered to be based on human traditions rather than God's leading. @@Each person is responsible before God for his or her own understanding of the Bible and is encouraged to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling@@. Baptists generally consider historic Christian creeds </wiki/Creed> to be on lower footing in comparison to Scripture even though they may in essence agree with them. However, a group or local church may have a general \"Statement of Faith\" such as the Baptist Faith and Message </wiki/Baptist_Faith_and_Message> of the Southern Baptist Convention </wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention>).\\nBiblical inerrancy </wiki/Biblical_inerrancy> is also a common position held by fundamentalist Baptists in addition to literal interpretations of the Bible and other fundamentalist theologies. However, because of the variety allowed under congregational governance, many Baptist churches are neither literalist nor fundamentalist, although most do believe in biblical authority. Most moderate or non-fundamentalist Baptists prefer the term inspired or \"God breathed\" rather than inerrant to describe scripture, referring to the term Paul uses in 2 Timothy 3:16.\\nEven though it is only the Bible that is authoritative, Baptists also cite other works as illustrative of doctrine. @@One work which is commonly read by Baptists is the allegory Pilgrim's Progress by John Bunyan@@ </wiki/John_Bunyan>.\\n\\nAutonomy of the Local Church (Congregationalism)\\nCongregationalist church governance </wiki/Congregationalist_church_governance> gives autonomy </wiki/Autonomy> to individual local churches in areas of policy </wiki/Policy>, polity </wiki/Polity> and doctrine </wiki/Doctrine>. Baptist churches are not under the direct administrative control of any other body, such as a national council, or a leader such as a bishop or pope. @@Administration, leadership and doctrine are usually decided democratically by the lay members of each individual church,@@ which accounts for the variation of beliefs from one Baptist church to another.\\nExceptions are some Reformed Baptists </wiki/Reformed_Baptist>, who are organized in a Presbyterian </wiki/Presbyterian> system, the Congolese </wiki/Congolese> Episcopal Baptists </w/index.php?title=Episcopal_Baptist&action=edit> that has an Episcopal </wiki/Episcopal> system, and some Baptist megachurches </wiki/Megachurch> who lean towards a strong clergy-led style, in some instances abandoning congregational governance altogether.\\nIn a manner typical of other congregationalists, many cooperative associations or conventions of Baptists have arisen. These associations were formed for missionary and other charitable work and have no authority over the operations of individual local churches. Local churches decide at what level they will participate in these associations. The largest association in the United States is the Southern Baptist Convention </wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention>. The second largest is the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. </wiki/National_Baptist_Convention%2C_USA%2C_Inc.>, which is also America's second largest predominantly African-American denomination. There are hundreds of Baptist conventions and many Independent Baptist </wiki/Independent_Baptist> churches do not fall into any of them, believing such associations to be unscriptural. In addition, there are sometimes very strong disputes within conventions which are often divided between Christian fundamentalists </wiki/Christian_fundamentalist> and moderates.\\n[edit </w/index.php?title=Baptist&action=edit&section=5>] \\n\\nPriesthood of all believers\\n@@Priesthood of all believers states that every Christian has direct access to God and the truths found in the Bible without the help of an aristocracy or hierachy of priests.@@ This doctrine is based on the passage found in 1 Peter 2:9 <http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9;&version=31;50;9;> and was popularized by Martin Luther </wiki/Martin_Luther> during the Protestant Reformation </wiki/Protestant_Reformation> and John Wycliff </wiki/John_Wycliff>'s Lollards </wiki/Lollards> before Luther. Baptists are encouraged to discuss issues with their minister when appropriate. The Baptist position of the priesthood of believers is one column that upholds their belief in religious liberty.\\n[edit </w/index.php?title=Baptist&action=edit&section=6>] \\n\\nTwo Ordinances @@(Baptism and Communion)@@\\nGenerally, Baptist churches recognize only two Biblical ordinances that are to be performed on a regular basis by churches: baptism and communion. @@Some churches, including some Free Will Baptists, also practice foot washing as a third ordinance.@@\\n[edit </w/index.php?title=Baptist&action=edit&section=7>] \\n\\nBeliever's baptism\\n@@Baptism@@, commonly referred to as Believer's baptism </wiki/Believer%27s_baptism>, is an ordinance that, according to Baptist doctrine, @@plays no role in salvation@@, and is performed after a person professes Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. It is an @@outward expression that is symbolic of the inward cleansing or remission of their sins that has already taken place.@@ It is also a public identification of that person with Christianity and with that particular local church. Most Baptist churches use baptism by full immersion, subsequent to salvation, as a criterion for membership.\\nThrough Anabaptist </wiki/Anabaptist> influence, Baptists reject the practice of pedobaptism </wiki/Pedobaptism> (infant baptism) because they believe @@parents cannot make a decision of salvation for an infant@@. Related to this doctrine is the disputed concept of an @@\"age of accountability\" when God determines that a mentally capable person is accountable for their sins and eligible for baptism. This is not necessarily a specific age@@, but is @@based on whether or not the person is mentally capable of knowing right from wrong.@@ Thus, a person with severe mental retardation may never reach this age, and therefore would not be held accountable for sins.\\nBaptists emphasize baptism </wiki/Baptism> by@@ full immersion,@@__ the mode presumed to have been used by John the Baptist. __This consists of lowering the candidate in water backwards while the baptizer (a pastor or any baptised believer) invokes the Trinitarian formula of Matthew 28:19 or other words concerning a profession of faith. This mode is also preferred for its parallel imagery to the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus </wiki/Jesus>.\\nRecognition of baptisms by other modes and Christian groups vary. Many Baptist churches only recognize baptism by full immersion as being valid, while a few will baptise by sprinkling as a practical alternative for the disabled or elderly or in times of drought. Some Baptist churches will recognize adult baptisms performed in other orthodox Christian churches, while others only recognize baptisms performed in Baptist churches. In rare instances, a church may recognize only its own baptisms as valid.\\n[edit </w/index.php?title=Baptist&action=edit&section=8>] \\n\\n@@Communion@@\\nCommunion, which is often called \"The Lord's Supper\", is an ordinance patterned after the Last Supper </wiki/Last_Supper> recorded in the Gospels </wiki/Gospels> which Jesus says to \"do this in remembrance of Me\" (Luke 22:19). Participants communally eat the bread and drink the cup that are representative of the body and blood of Jesus. @@Baptists emphasize that the remembrance is symbolic of Christ's body and reject literal views@@ of communion such as transubstantiation </wiki/Transubstantiation> and consubstantiation </wiki/Consubstantiation> held by other Christian groups based on their interpretation of John 6. 1 Corinthians 11:23-34 is also commonly cited as instructional for the practice of Communion. Many Baptists refuse to refer to this ordinance as Communion due to its prominent use by the Roman Catholic Church </wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church>.\\nThe bread used in the service may be cubes of unleavened bread, wafers or small crackers, generally of an unleavened variety which is thought to be the type used at the Last Supper. The @@general Baptist embracing of the Temperance movement @@</wiki/Temperance_movement>, prohibition </wiki/Prohibition>, and teetotalism </wiki/Teetotalism> in the U.S. led to the practice of using non-alcoholic @@grape juice @@for the cup, but some Baptists do use wine. The grape juice is typically served in small individual glasses, though some churches use one large cup for the entire congregation. Many church buildings are equipped with round receptacles on the rear of the pews for depositing the empty glasses after the service. Both \"elements\" of the bread and the cup are usually served by the pastor to the deacons, and by the deacons to the congregation. The general practice is for the elements to be taken by the congregation as a whole as a symbol of unity, first the bread and then the cup separately, although sometimes both elements are taken together.\\nCommunion services may be held weekly, monthly, quarterly, or even annually. It usually takes place at the end of a normal service, but may take place at any time during the service. Participation may be either \"closed\" (only members of that church can participate), \"cracked\" (members of other Baptist churches may participate, but not of other denominations), or \"open\" (anyone professing to be a Christian may participate).\\n[edit </w/index.php?title=Baptist&action=edit&section=9>] \\n\\nIndividual Soul Liberty\\nThe basic concept of individual soul liberty is that,@@ in matters of religion, each person has the liberty to choose what his/her conscience or soul dictates is right, and is responsible to no one but God for the decision that is made.@@ A person may then choose to be a Baptist, a member of another Christian denomination, an adherent to another world religion, or to choose no religious belief system, and neither the church, nor the government, nor family or friends may either make the decision or compel the person to choose otherwise. And, a person may change his/her mind over time.\\n[edit </w/index.php?title=Baptist&action=edit&section=10>] \\n\\nSeparation of Church and State\\nMain article: Baptists in the history of separation of church and state </wiki/Baptists_in_the_history_of_separation_of_church_and_state>\\nBaptists who were imprisoned or died for their beliefs have played an important role in the historical struggle for freedom of religion </wiki/Freedom_of_religion> and separation of church and state </wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state> in England </wiki/England>, the United States </wiki/United_States>, and other countries. In 1612 </wiki/1612> John Smyth </wiki/John_Smyth_%281570-1612%29> wrote, \"the magistrate is not by virtue of his office to meddle with religion, or matters of conscience\". That same year, Thomas Helwys </wiki/Thomas_Helwys> wrote that the King of England could \"command what of man he will, and we are to obey it,\" but concerning the church -- \"with this Kingdom, our lord the King hath nothing to do.\" In 1614 </wiki/1614>, Leonard Busher </w/index.php?title=Leonard_Busher&action=edit> wrote what is believed to be the earliest Baptist treatise dealing exclusively with the subject of religious liberty. Baptists were influential in the formation of the first civil government based on the separation of church and state in what is now Rhode Island. Anabaptists </wiki/Anabaptists> and Quakers </wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends> also share a strong history in the development of separation of church and state.\\nThe original objection was opposition of the monarchy or government setting religious agenda for churches or a \"National Church\" and did not imply a retreat by Christians from the political realm or involvement in the political process. Modern debates about church and state separation involve disagreements about the extent to which Christian groups are able to, or should, set the legal and moral agenda for the government.\\nCurrently in the United States, Baptist involvement in politics often involves controversies concerning gambling </wiki/Gambling>, alcohol </wiki/Alcohol>, abortion </wiki/Abortion>, same-sex marriage </wiki/Same-sex_marriage>, the teaching of evolution </wiki/Evolution> and state-sanctioned public prayer in public high schools </wiki/High_school>. In parts of the Southern United States </wiki/Southern_United_States>, Baptists form a majority of the population and have successfully banned alcohol sales </wiki/Dry_county> and prevented the legalization of certain kinds of gambling.\\n[edit </w/index.php?title=Baptist&action=edit&section=11>] \\n\\nTwo Offices @@(Pastor and Deacon)@@\\nGenerally Baptists only recognize two Scriptural offices, those of pastor </wiki/Pastor> and deacon </wiki/Deacon>. The __office of elder, common in some churches, is usually considered by Baptists to be the same as that of pastor, and not a separate office.__\\nThe prevalent view among Baptists is that these offices are limited to men only, following the model of Christ </wiki/Christ> and His apostles </wiki/Apostles>.\\n[edit </w/index.php?title=Baptist&action=edit&section=12>] \\n\\nPastor\\nIn the Baptist church, the primary role of pastor is to deliver the weekly sermon.\\nIn smaller churches, the pastor will often visit homes and hospitals to call on ill members, as well as homes of prospective members (especially those who have not made salvation decisions). The pastor will also perform weddings and funerals for members, and at business meetings serve as the moderator. The pastor may also be required to find outside work to supplement his income.\\nLarger churches will usually have one or more \"associate\" pastors, each with a specific area of responsibility, whereby the overall pastor is considered the \"senior\" pastor. Some examples are:\\nmusic (the most common) \\nyouth (in smaller churches, often combined with music) \\nchildren \\nadministration (in the larger churches) \\nIn the majority of instances, the pastor will be married with children (associate pastors may or may not be married, but if not married will find it difficult to be considered for a senior pastor position by other churches).\\n[edit </w/index.php?title=Baptist&action=edit&section=13>] \\n\\nDeacon\\nThe main role of the deacon is to assist the pastor with members' needs. Deacons also assist during communion.\\nA common practice is for each family to be assigned a specific deacon, to be the primary point of contact whenever a need arises.\\nSome larger megachurches, especially those using cell groups, use the cell group leader(s) to function in the role of deacon(s).\\nDeacons are usually chosen from members who have demonstrated exceptional Christian piety, and serve without pay.\\n[edit </w/index.php?title=Baptist&action=edit&section=14>] \\n\\nJustification by faith\\nJustification by faith or sola fide </wiki/Sola_fide> states that it is by faith alone that we receive salvation and not through any works of our own. Baptists have a strong emphasis on the concept of salvation </wiki/Salvation>. Baptist theology teaches that humans have been contaminated by the sin of Adam and Eve's rebellion against God and that for this sin we are condemned to damnation. The theology holds that Christ </wiki/Christ> died on the cross to give humans the promise of everlasting life, but that this requires that each individual willfully accepts Christ into his life and repents of sin. Nevertheless, the Baptist view of soteriology </wiki/Soteriology> runs the gamut from Calvinism </wiki/Calvinism> to Arminianism </wiki/Arminianism>.\\n[edit </w/index.php?title=Baptist&action=edit&section=15>] \\n\\nBeliefs that vary among Baptists\\nBecause of the congregational style of church governance on doctrine, doctrine on the following issues often varies greatly between one Baptist church and another.\\ndoctrine of separation </wiki/Doctrine_of_separation> \\nCalvinism </wiki/Calvinism>/Arminianism </wiki/Arminianism> \\nthe nature of Law and Gospel </wiki/Gospel> \\nthe ordination of women \\nhomosexuality </wiki/Homosexuality_and_Christianity> \\nthe extent to which Church and State should be separate from each other \\nthe extent to which non-members may participate in communion </wiki/Communion> services \\nEschatology </wiki/Eschatology> \\nBaptists generally believe in the literal Second Coming </wiki/Second_Coming> of Christ at which time God will sit in judgment and divide humanity between the saved and the lost (the Great White Throne judgment Book of Revelation </wiki/Book_of_Revelation> 20:11) and Christ will sit in judgment of the believers (the Judgment Seat of Christ Second Epistle to the Corinthians </wiki/Second_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians> 5:10), rewarding them for things done while alive. Amillennialism </wiki/Amillennialism>, dispensationalism </wiki/Dispensationalism>, and historic premillennialism </wiki/Premillennialism> stand as the main eschatological views of Baptists, with views such as postmillennialism </wiki/Postmillennialism> and preterism </wiki/Preterism> receiving only scant support.\\n[edit </w/index.php?title=Baptist&action=edit&section=16>] \\n\\nComparisons with other denominations\\nBaptists share certain emphases with other groups such as evangelism </wiki/Evangelism> and missions </wiki/Mission_%28Christian%29>. While the general flavor of any denomination changes from city to city, this aspect of Baptist churches is much more prominent than in most Anglican </wiki/Anglican>, Methodist </wiki/Methodist>, Lutheran </wiki/Lutheran> and Presbyterian </wiki/Presbyterian> churches.\\nThe Pacifism </wiki/Pacifism> of the Anabaptists </wiki/Anabaptists> and the Quakers is not an ideal held by most Baptists. The Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America </wiki/Baptist_Peace_Fellowship_of_North_America> was organized in 1984 </wiki/1984> to promote peace, justice, and non-violence, but it does not speak for all Baptists that accept the ideal of pacifism. Moreover, Baptists are strongest in the southern United States, an area known for strong support of the military and thus not supportive of pacifist views.\\nIn Australia </wiki/Australia>, the Baptist Union is very close to the Campbell-Stone </w/index.php?title=Campbell-Stone&action=edit> Church of Christ </wiki/Church_of_Christ>. The two groups share similar theology, even sharing a bible college.\\n[edit </w/index.php?title=Baptist&action=edit&section=17>] \\n\\nWorship Style\\n@@The focus of Baptist church services is the sermon.@@ This can be seen in traditional Baptist church architecture. @@The pulpit@@__, which is symbolic of proclamation of the Word of God, is the largest piece of furniture and centered on the platform. While the communion table placed below it in a symbolically \"subservient\" position__. Sermons often range in time from 30-60 minutes. They range in style from expository </wiki/Expository_preaching> sermons that focus on one biblical passage and interpret its meaning, to topical sermons which address an issue of concern and investigate several biblical passages related to that topic.\\nThe sermon is often surrounded by periods of musical worship lead by a song leader, choir or band. Musical style varies between hymns </wiki/Hymns> and Contemporary Christian music </wiki/Contemporary_Christian_music> with many churches choosing a blend of the two. The choice in music style is sometimes correlated to the age of the members with older congregations preferring hymns while younger congregations prefer contemporary music. Some fundamentalist Baptists will only sing hymns </wiki/Hymns> which usually includes songs in their hymnals written between the 1700s and the 1950s and are often played with a piano and/or organ. They also oppose the use of drums and/or electric guitar in their services because they associate those instruments with rock music </wiki/Rock_music>.\\nOther common features in a Baptist church service include the collection of offering, an altar call, a period of announcements and Communion.\\nMost Baptist congregations are small in number with membership under 200 people. Some megachurches </wiki/Megachurch> are Baptist but they often do not emphasize their ties to a Baptist body, even going so far as to not include \"Baptist\" in their church name. Saddleback Church </wiki/Saddleback_Church> is such an example, being affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention </wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention>.\\n\n\nPossible Christian Names\\nErskine, Willy, Clarence, Louis, Carl, Eugene, Raymond, Fred, Roy, Samuel, Elmer, Herman, Russel, Clifford, Melvin, Milton, Claude, Vernon, Johnnie, Wilbur, Gilbert, Everett, Harvey, Wayne, Leon, Glenn, Wyatt\\n\\nHattie, Viola, Mattie, Ella, Irene, Mabel, Minnie, Sadie, Inez, Lula, Opal, Cora, Leona, Alma, Lena, Willie, Bernice, Bessie, Norma, Pearl, Vivian, \\n\\nClemons Family\\nCarl Lee Clemons-- Father\\nWyatt -- Carl Lee's oldest son who carries a deal of restlessness with him\\nOpal -- Carl Lee's wife (Wyatt's mother); heroine of the story\\n\\nTindall Family\\nHelped the Clemons put up a split rail fence when the Clemons first came; Clemons felt obliged to return the favor.

Checkbox states can be preserved in the document by either automatically modifying the tiddler content or setting/removing tags on specified tiddlers, or they may be saved as local cookies by assigning an optional 'chkID' to the checkbox. Add custom javascript for programmatic initialization and onClick handling for any checkbox. Also provides access to checkbox DOM element data and tracks the checkbox state in TiddlyWiki's config.options[] internal data.\\n\\n!!!!!Usage\\n<<<\\nThe checkbox syntax, including all optional parameters, is contained inside a matched set of [ and ] brackets.\\n{{{ [x=id(title:tag){init_script}{onclick_script}] }}}\\n\\nAn alternative syntax lets you place the optional parameters ''outside'' the [ and ] brackets, and is provided for backward-compatibility with existing content that may include checkbox definitions based on earlier releases of this plugin:\\n{{{ [x]=id(title:tag){init_script}{onclick_script} }}}\\n\\n//{{{\\n[ ]or[_] and [x]or[X]\\n//}}}\\nSimple checkboxes. The current unchecked/checked state is indicated by the character between the {{{[}}} and {{{]}}} brackets (\"_\" means unchecked, \"X\" means checked). When you click on a checkbox, the current state is retained by directly modifying the tiddler content to place the corresponding \"_\" or \"X\" character in between the brackets\\n//{{{\\n[x=id]\\n//}}}\\nAssign an optional ID to the checkbox so you can use {{{document.getElementByID(\"id\")}}} to manipulate the checkbox DOM element, as well as tracking the current checkbox state in {{{config.options[\"id\"]}}}. If the ID starts with \"chk\" the checkbox state will also be saved in a cookie, so it can be automatically restored whenever the checkbox is re-rendered (overrides any default {{{[x]}}} or {{{[_]}}} value). If a cookie value is kept, the \"_\" or \"X\" character in the tiddler content remains unchanged, and is only applied as the default when a cookie-based value is not currently defined.\\n//{{{\\n[x(title:tag)]\\n//}}}\\nInitializes and tracks the current checkbox state by setting or removing (\"TogglyTagging\") a particular tag value from a specified tiddler. If you omit the tiddler title (and the \":\" separator), the specified tag is assigned to the current tiddler. If you omit the tag value, as in {{{(title:)}}}, the default tag, {{{checked}}}, is assumed. Omitting both the title and tag, {{{()}}}, tracks the checkbox state by setting the \"checked\" tag on the current tiddler. When tag tracking is used, the \"_\" or \"X\" character in the tiddler content remains unchanged, and is not used to set or track the checkbox state. If a tiddler title named in the tag does not exist, the checkbox state defaults to //unselected//. When the checkbox is subsequently changed to //selected//, it will automatically (and silently) create the missing tiddler and then add the tag to it.\\n//{{{\\n[x{javascript}{javascript}]\\n//}}}\\nYou can define optional javascript code segments to add custom initialization and/or 'onClick' handling to a checkbox. The current checkbox state (and it's other DOM attributes) can be set or read from within these code segments by reference to the default context-object, 'this'.\\n\\nThe first code segment will be executed when the checkbox is initially displayed, so that you can programmatically determine it's starting checked/unchecked state. The second code segment (if present) is executed whenever the checkbox is clicked, so that you can perform programmed responses or intercept and override the checkbox state based on complex logic using the TW core API or custom functions defined in plugins (e.g. testing a particular tiddler title to see if certain tags are set or setting some tags when the checkbox is clicked).\\n\\nNote: if you want to use the default checkbox initialization processing with a custom onclick function, use this syntax: {{{ [x=id{}{javascript}] }}} \\n<<<\\n!!!!!Examples\\n<<<\\n//{{{\\n[X] label\\n[_] label\\n//}}}\\nchecked and unchecked static default values\\n[X] label\\n[_] label\\n\\n//{{{\\n[_=demo] label\\n//}}}\\ndocument-based value (id='demo', no cookie)\\n[_=demo] label\\n\\n//{{{\\n[_=chkDemo] label\\n//}}}\\ncookie-based value (id='chkDemo')\\n[_=chkDemo] label\\n\\n//{{{\\n[_(CheckboxPlugin:demotag)] toggle 'demotag'\\n//}}}\\ntag-based value (TogglyTagging)\\n[_(CheckboxPlugin:demotag)] toggle 'demotag'\\ncurrent tags: <script>return store.getTiddler(story.findContainingTiddler(place).id.substr(7)).tags.toString();</script>\\n\\n//{{{\\n[X{this.checked=true}{alert(this.checked?\"on\":\"off\")}] message box with checkbox state\\n//}}}\\ncustom init and onClick functions\\n[X{this.checked=true}{alert(this.checked?\"on\":\"off\")}] message box with checkbox state\\n\\nRetrieving option values:\\nconfig.options['demo']=<script>return config.options['demo']?\"true\":\"false\";</script>\\nconfig.options['chkDemo']=<script>return config.options['chkDemo']?\"true\":\"false\";</script>\\n\\n!!!!!Installation\\nimport (or copy/paste) the following tiddlers into your document:\\n''CheckboxPlugin'' (tagged with <<tag systemConfig>>)\\n<<<\\n!!!!!Revision History\\n<<<\\n2006.02.23 - 2.0.4\\nwhen toggling tags, force refresh of the tiddler containing the checkbox.\\n\\n2006.02.23 - 2.0.3\\nwhen toggling tags, force refresh of the 'tagged tiddler' so that tag-related tiddler content (such as \"to-do\" lists) can be re-rendered.\\n\\n2006.02.23 - 2.0.2\\nwhen using tag-based storage, allow use [[ and ]] to quote tiddler or tag names that contain spaces:\\n\"\"\"[x([[Tiddler with spaces]]:[[tag with spaces]])]\"\"\"\\n\\n2006.01.10 - 2.0.1\\nwhen toggling tags, force refresh of the 'tagging tiddler'.

William Penn saw a striking @@likeness between the Jews of London and the American Indians@@. Some claim that the stories of the Old Testament are legends in some Indian tribes. In the Jewish Encyclopedia it is said that the __Hebrews, after the captivity, separated themselves from the heathen__ in order to observe their peculiar laws; and Manasseh Ben Israel claims that America had the Israelites__, and this explains why, in the blessing of Jacob upon his sons__, Judah is surnamed a lion, Dan a serpent, Benjamin a wolf, and Joseph a bough. ' There are also resemblances in their language to the Latin and Greek tongues, Chickamauga meaning the field of death, and Aquone the sound of water. \\n\\nTHE CHEROKEES A SUPERIOR TRIBE .2 They have been known as one of the largest and most noteworthy of the aboriginal tribes, and formed an important factor in both English and Spanish pioneering. __Those who dwelt in the mountains__ were known as the @@Otari or Overhill Cherokees@@, while those dwelling in the lowlands were called the@@ Erati@@ 3 or Lowland Cherokees. They had their own national government, and numbered from 20,000 to 25,000 persons. They are \"well advanced along the white man's road.\" What is now known as the Eastern band, in the heart of the Carolina mountains, outnumbers today such well-known Western tribes as the Omaha, Pawnee, Comanche and Kiowas, and it is among these, \"the old conservative Kituhwa element, that the ancient things have been preserved.\" In the forests of Nantahala and Oconaluftee, \"the Cherokee priest still treasures the legends and repeats the mystic rituals\" of his ancestors. The original boundary embraced about 40,000 square miles, from the head streams of the Kanawha to Atlanta, and from the Blue Ridge to the Cumberland range, with Itsati, or Echota, on the south bank of the Little Tennessee river, a few miles above the mouth of Tellico creek, in Tennessee, as its capital. This was called the \"City of Refuge.\" They call themselves the Yunwiga, or real people, and on ceremonial occasions speak of themselves as Ani-Kituhwagi, or people of @@Kituhwa@@__, an ancient settlement on the Tuckaseegee river__, and apparently the original nucleus of the tribe. The name by which they are now knownCherokee-has no meaning in their language, and the form among them is Tsalagi or Tsargi. It first appears as Chalaque in the Portugese narrative of DeSoto's expedition, while Cheraqui appears in a French document in 1699. It got its present form in 1708, thus having an authentic history at this time (1913) of 275 years. They admit that they built the mounds on Grave creek in Ohio, and the mounds near Charlottesville, Va. They had also lived at the Peaks of Otter, Va. But they disclaim all knowledge of the mounds and petroglyphs in North Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia. \\n\\nTRADITIONS of WHITE AND LILLIPUTIAN RACES. There is a dim but persistent __tradition of a white race having preceded the Cherokees__ ; and of a tribe of @@Lilliputians@@ or very small people, who once lived on the site of the ancient mound on the northern side of Hiwassee river, at the mouth of Peachtree creek, and afterwards went west. This was long before the normal sized whites came. bliss Murphrey has preserved this tradition in her \"In the Stranger Peoples' Country.\" \\n\\nINTRODUCTION of SMALL ARMS AND SMALLPOX. About 1700 the @@first guns@@ were introduced among the Cherokees, and in 1738 or 1739 @@smallpox@@ nearly exterminated the tribe within a single year. It had been brought to Charleston, S. C., on a slave ship. \\n\\nOTHER EARLY INCIDENTS. About 1740 a trading path from Augusta to the Cherokee towns at the head of the Savannah, and thence to the west was marked out by this tribe, and in that year the Cherokees took part under their war chief, \"The Raven,\" in Oglethorpe's expedition against the Spaniards at 8t. Augustine. In 1736 Christian Priber, a Jesuit, acting in French interest, became influential among them. He was a most worthy member of that illustrious order whose scholarship, devotion and courage have been exemplified from the days of Jogues and Marquette down to Desmet and Mengarini. In 1756 Fort Prince George was built at the head of the Savannah, and Fort London near the junction of Tellico creek and the Little Tennessee river, beyond the mountains. Disagreements between the Cherokees and the South Carolina colonists finally resulted in the seizure of Oconostota, a young war chief, and his retention at Fort Prince George as a hostage. This led to war, and the Cherokees besieged Fort London. In June, 1760, Col. Montgomery, with 1,600 men, crossed the Indian frontier and drove the Cherokees from about Fort Prince George, and then destroyed every one of the Lower Cherokee towns, killing more than a hundred Indians and driving the whole population into the mountains. He then crossed the mountains without opposition till he came near Echoe, a few miles above the sacred town of Kikwasi, now Franklin, N. C., where he met their full force, which compelled Montgomery to retire in a battle fought June 27, 1760. He retreated to Fort Prince George after losing 100 men in killed and wounded. \\n\\nMASSACRE AT FORT LOUDON. This retreat sealed the fate of the garrison at Fort London, which had been reduced to the necessity of eating horses and dogs, though Indian women, who had found sweethearts among the soldiers, brought them what food they could. On August 8, Capt. Demere surrendered his garrison of about 200 to Oconostota upon promise that they should be allowed to retire with sufficient arms and ammunition for the march. The garrison made a day's march up Tellico creek and camped, while the Cherokees plundered the fort. It was then that they discovered ten bags of powder and a large quantity of ball that the garrison had secretly buried in the fort before surrendering. Cannon and small arms also had been thrown into the river, which was a breach of the terms of the capitulation. Enraged at this duplicity the Indians attacked the retiring garrison at sunrise the next morning, killing Demere and 25 others at the first fire, and taking the rest prisoners, to be ransomed some time later on. Capt. Stuart, second in command, was claimed by Ata-kullakulla, a Cherokee chief, who managed to conduct him, after nine days' march, to his friends in Virginia. A treaty was concluded at Augusta, November 10, 1763, by which the Cherokees lost all north of the present Tennessee line and east of the Blue Ridge and Savannah. A royal proclamation was issued this year barring the whites from occupying Indian lands west of the Blue Ridge; while in 1768 a treaty fixed the northern limit as downward along the New and Kanawha rivers from the North Carolina line. This treaty was made at Hard Labor, S. C.; while on March 17, 1775, a treaty cut off the Cherokees from the Ohio and their rich Kentucky hunting grounds. \\n\\nTHREE STATES COMBINE AGAINST THE CHEROKEES. But the constant encroachments of the whites upon the Indian territory resulted, in 1776, in an agreement between Virginia, North and South Carolina by which each sent a punitive expedition into the Cherokee country, and laid it waste for miles, killing men and even women, and driving many into the mountains for refuge. In August Gen. Griffith Rutherford, with 2,400 men, crossed Swannanoa gap, and after following the present line of railroad to the French Broad, out Hominy creek and following up the Richland, struck the first Indian town at Stecoee, the present site of Whittier, on the Tuckaseegee. This he burned, and then destroyed all towns on Oconaluftee, Tuckaseegee and the upper part of Little Tennessee; also those on the Hiwassee below the junction of Valley river, making 36 towns in all. He also destroyed all crops. The chaplain of this expedition was Rev. James Hall, D. D., a Presbyterian. At Sugartown (Kuletsiyi), east of the present Franklin, a detachment sent to destroy it was surprised by the Cherokees and escaped only through the aid of another force sent to its rescue. Rutherford himself encountered a force in Wayah gap of the Nantallalas, between Franklin and Aquone, where he lost forty killed and wounded, but finally repulsing the Indians.' An Indian killed in this fight proved to have been a woman dressed as a man. An account of the route followed by Rutherford, with many other facts, can be found in the North Carolina Booklet, Vol. IV, No. 8, for December, 1904; from which it appears that Williamson of South Carolina was to have joined Rutherford at Cowee, but as he did not appear, Rutherford, without a proper guide, crossed the Nantahalas at an unusual place, thus missing the W ayah gap, where 500 braves had assembled to oppose him and that two days later Williamson, hurrying up Cartoogachaye creek, crossed at the usual place, and fell into the ambush which had been prepared for Rutherford; and that Rutherford lost but three men in the entire expedition. This latter account is probably the true one. Williamson joined Rutherford on the Hiwassee. It was considered unnecessary to await the arrival of Col. Christian from Virginia, who was coming via the Holston river, as all the Cherokee towns had been destroyed. Col. Andrew Williamson's force of South Carolinians was 1,860 strong, including a number of Catawbas, and came through Rabun gap of the Blue Ridge.5 It was near Murphy that Rutherford and Williamson's forces joined September 26, 1776. Among Christian's men was a regiment from Surry county, N. C., under Colonels Joseph Williams and Love, and Major Winston. They had assembled on the Holston and pressed cautiously along the great warpath to the crossing of the French Broad in Tennessee, and thence advanced without opposition to the Little Tennessee, where, early in November, Christian was proceeding to destroy their towns, when the Indians sought peace. Col. Christian, hoping to draw trade from the South Carolina Indians, accepted the promise of the Cherokees to \"surrender all their prisoners and to cede all the disputed territory . . in the Tennessee settlements,\" suspended hostilities and withdrew, but not till he had burned the town of Tuckaseegee because its inhabitants had been concerned in the burning of a white boy, named Moore, who had been captured with a Mrs. Bean: but he spared the peace town of Echota. But Col. William of Surry was not pleased with Christian's leniency, and on the 22d of November, 1776, wrote to the North Carolina Congress from Surry, enclosing documents which he claimed proved conclusively \"that some of the Virginia gentlemen are desirious of having the Cherokees under their protection,\" which Williams did not think right as most of the territory was within North Carolina and should be under her protection. In this warfare every Indian was scalped and even women were shot down and afterwards \"helped to their end.\" Prisoners were \"taken and put up at auction as slaves, when not killed on the spot.\" \\n\\nHOLSTON AND HOPEWELL TREATIES. At Long Island of the Holston a treaty was concluded July 20, 1777, by which the Middle and upper Cherokees ceded everything east of the Blue Ridge, and all disputed territory on the Watauga, Nollechucky, upper Holston and New rivers. This ended the treaties with the separate States. The first treaty made with the United States was at Hopewell, S. C., November 28, 1785, by which the whole country east of the Blue Ridge, with the Watauga and Cumberland settlements, was given to the whites, but leaving the whole of western North Carolina to the Cherokees. \\n\\nTREATIES of WHITE'S FORT AND TELLICO. In the summer of 1791 the Cherokees made a treaty at White's Fort, now Knoxville, by which they ceded a \"triangular section of Tennessee and North Carolina extending from the Clinch river almost to the Blue Ridge, and including nearly the whole of the French Broad and lower Holston and the sites of the present Knoxville, and Greeneville, Tenn., and Asheville, N. C., most of which territory was already occupied by the whites. Permission was also given for a road from the eastern settlements to those of the Cumberland, with free navigation of the Tennessee river.\" This treaty was signed by 41 principal chiefs and was concluded July 2, 1791, and probably gave legal title to the whites to as far west of the Blue Ridge as the Pigeon river in Haywood county. There were four treaties of Tellico, the first having been signed October 2, 1798, by 39 chiefs, by which were ceded a tract between the Clinch river and the Cumberland ridge, another along the northern bank of the Little Tennessee, extending up to the Chilhowie mountains, and a third in North Carolina on the head of the French Broad and Pigeon rivers, and including what are now Waynesville and Hendersonville; thus making the Balsam mountains the western boundary. In 180 and 1800, three additional treaties were concluded at Tellico by Return J. Meigs, by which the Cherokees were shorn of 8,000 square miles, not affecting the limits of North Carolina; but it was then that Meigs originated what he termed a \"silent consideration,\" by which a smaller amount was named in the public treaty, to-wit: $2,000-while he had agreed that \"one thousand dollars and some rifles\" in addition should be given to some of the chiefs who signed it. This treaty however was concluded at Washington, D. C., January 7, 1806. In 1813 the Cherokees agreed that a company should lay off and build a free public road from the Tennessee river to the head of navigation of the Tuggaloo branch of the Savannah; and this road was completed within the next three years, and became the great highway from the coast to the Tennessee settlements. The road began where Toccoa creek enters the Savannah, and passed through Clarksville and Hiwassee in Georgia, and Hayesville and Murphy, N. C., though those towns had not been established by the whites at that time. From Murphy it passed over the Unaka or White mountains into Tennessee to Echota, the capital town of the Cherokees. It was officially styled the Unicoi Turnpike, but was commonly known in North Carolina as the Wachese or Watsisa trail, because it passed near the home of a noted Indian who lived near the place at which it crossed Beaverdam creek-his name having been Watsisa-and because this portion of the road followed the old trail which already bore that name. \\n\\nNANAKATAHKE AND JUNALUSKA. The former was a sister of Yonaguska, and the mother-in-law of Gid. F. Morris, a South Carolinian who came to Cherokee county about the same time that Betty Bly or Blythe, came there, according to the statement of the late Col. A. T. Davidson, who said that Nanakatahke told him that she was the mother of Wachesa, or Grasshopper. Junaluska, spelled Tsunulahunski in Cherokee, is the best remembered of the Cherokee chief:, of whom a full account will be found in Chapter XII, pp. 292-293. \\n\\nTHE REMOVAL TREATIES. On the 8th of July, 1817, at the Cherokee agency (now Calhoun, Tenn.), a treaty was made by which, in return for land in Georgia and Tennessee, the Cherokees were to receive a tract within the present limits of Arkansas, and payment for any- substantial improvements they had made on the ceded lands they would abandon by going to Arkansas. Each warrior who left no improvements behind was to be given for his abandoned field and but a rifle, ammunition, a blanket, a kettle or a beaver trap. Boats and provisions for the journey were also to be furnished the Indians who might go. It was also provided that those who chose to remain might do so and become citizens, the amount of land occupied by such to be deducted from the total cession. But the majority of the Cherokees opposed removal bitterly, and only 31 of the principal men of the eastern band and 15 of the western signed for the tribe. A protest signed by 67 chiefs and headsmen was presented to the commissioners for the government; but it was ignored and the treaty ratified. In fact, the authorities for the United States did not even wait for the ratification, but at once took steps for the removal of all who desired to go west, and before 1819, six thousand had been removed, according to the estimate. This, however, did not effect North Carolina territory; but on February 27, 1819, a treaty was made at `'Washington by which the Indians ceded to the United States, among other tracts in Alabama, Tennessee and Georgia, \"nearly everything remaining to them\" in North Carolina east of the Nantahala mountains; though individual reservations one mile square within the ceded area were allowed a number of families, who preferred to remain and become citizens. In order to conform to the laws of civilization, those who were to remain adopted a regular republican form of government modeled after that of the United States, with New Echota, a few miles above the present Calhoun, Ga., as the capital. John Ross was the first Cherokee president. They passed laws for the collection of taxes, and debts, for repairs of roads, for the support of schools and for the regulation of the liquor traffic; to punish horse stealing and theft, and to compel all marriages between white men and Indian women to be celebrated according to regular legal or church form, and to discourage polygamy. By a special decree the right of Blood Revenge, or capital punishment, was taken from the seven clans and vested in the authorities of the Indian nation. Death was the punishment to individual Indians who might sell lands to the whites without the consent of the Indian authorities. White men were not allowed to vote or hold office in the nation. \\n\\nYONAGUSKA, THE BLOOD AVENGER. The late Col. Allen T. Davidson told the writer that John Welch, a half-breed Frenchman, killed Leech, a fullblooded Cherokee, near old Valleytown in Cherokee county, and as Y onaguska was Leech's next of kin, he `vas therefore his blood avenger, and not only entitled to kill Welch, but the custom of the tribe made it his duty- to do so. He, therefore, followed Welch first to the Smoky mountains, and then to Paint Rock: thence to the New Found range west of Asheville, and to Pickens, S. C., where Welch stopped and rested. Here it was, though, that Welch became infatuated with a white girl named Betty Bly, and told Betty that he feared that Yonaguska, whom he had seen loitering near, was seeking a chance to kill him. She then sought out Yonaguska and persuaded him to let Welch off. \\n\\nTHE BAPTISTS ESTABLISH THE FIRST CHEROKEE MISSION. In 1820 the Baptists founded five principal missions, one of which was in Cherokee county, on the site of the old N achez town on the north side of Hiwassee river, just above the mouth of Peachtree creek. It was established at the instance of Currahee Dick, a prominent mixed-blood chief, and was placed in charge of the Rev. Evan Jones, known as the translator of the New Testament into the Cherokee language, with James D. Wafford, a mixed-blood pupil, who compiled a spelling book in the same language, as his assistant. The late Rev. Humphrey Posey afterwards became principal of this mission, and did a wonderful amount of work for the improvement and education of the Cherokees. The place is still known as \"The Mission Farm,\" and is one of the most productive and desirable in the mountains. Worcester and Boudinot's translation of Matthew, first published at -New Echota, Ga., in 1829, was introduced to the Kituwas Cherokees, and in the absence of missionaries, was read from house to house, after which Rev. Ulrich Keener, a Methodist, began to preach at irregular intervals, and was soon followed by Baptists. \\n\\n@@SEQUOYA AND HIS SYLLABARY@@. About this time (1821) Sikwayi (Sequoya) a half or quarter breed Cherokee, known among the whites as George Gist or Guest or Guess, invented the Cherokee __syllabary or alphabet__, which was \"soon recognized as an invaluable invention for the elevation of the tribe, and __within a few months thousands of hitherto illiterate Cherokees were able to read and write__ their own language, teaching each other in the cabins and along the roadside.... It had an immediate and wonderful effect on Cherokee development, and on account of the remarkable adaptation of the syllabary to the language, it was __only necessary to learn the characters to be able to read at once__....In the fall of 1824 @@Atsi or John Arch@@, a young native convert, made a manuscript @@translation of a portion of St. John's gospel@@, in the syllabary, this being the __first Bible translation ever given to the Cherokee__.\" On the 21st of February, 1828, \"the first number of the newspaper Taslagi Tsulehisanun, the Cherokee Phoenix, `printed' in English and Cherokee, was published at New Echota from type cast for that purpose in Boston under the supervision of the noted missionary, Worcester. Sequoya was born, probably about 1760 at Luck-a-Seegee town in Tennessee, just outside of old Fort Loudon, near where old Choto had stood.\" Here his mind dwelt also on the old tradition of a lost band of Cherokee living somewhere toward the western mountains. In 1841 and 1842, with a few Cherokee companions and with his provisions and papers loaded in an ox cart, he made several journeys into the west, and was received everywherewith kindness by even the wildest tribes. Disappointed in his philologic results, he started out in 1843 in quest of the lost Cherokees, who were believed to be some where in northern Mexico, but, being now an old man and worn out by hardship, he sank under the effort and died alone and unattended, it is said, near the village of San Fernando, Mexico, in August of that year. The Cherokees had voted him a pension of three hundred dollars which was continued to his widow, \"the only literary pension in the United States.\" The great trees of California (Sequoia gigantea) were named in his honor and preserve his memory. \\n\\nOUTRAGES FOLLOW DAHLONEGA GOLD DISCOVERY. The @@discovery of gold in the Dahlonega@@ district __caused the Georgia legislature on the 20th of December, 1828, to annex that part of the Cherokee country__ to Georgia and to annul all Cherokee laws and customs therein. This act was to take effect June 1, 1830, the land was __mapped into counties and divided into \"land lots\" of 160 acres__ and __\"gold lots\" of 40 acres__, which were to be __distributed amongst the white citizens__. Provision was made for the settlement of contested lottery claims among the white citizens, but no Indian could bring a suit or testify in court. \"About the same time the Cherokees were __forbidden to hold councils, or to assemble for any public purpose or to dig for gold upon their own lands__.\" The outrages which followed are disgraceful to the white men of that section and time. \\n\\n@@TREATY OF REMOVAL of 1835@@. On the 29th of December, 1835, by the treaty of New Echota, \"the __Cherokee nation ceded to the United States its whole remaining territory east of the Mississippi for the sum of $5,000,000 and a common joint interest in the territory already occupied by the western Cherokees in what is now the Indian Territory__, with an additional smaller tract on the northeast in what is now Kansas. Improvements were to be paid for, and the Indians were to be removed at the expense of the United States, and subsisted for one year after their arrival in the new country. The removal was to take place within two years . . . . \" It was also distinctly agreed that a limited number of Cherokees might remain behind and become citizens after they had been adjudged \"qualified or calculated to become useful citizens,\" together with a few who held individual reservations under former treaties. But this provision was struck out by President Jackson, who insisted that the \"whole Cherokee people should remove together.\" The treaty was ratified by the senate May 23, 1836, the official census of 1835 having fixed the number of Cherokees in North Carolina at 3,644. \\n\\nTHE PATHETIC STORY OF THE REMOVAL. This story exceeds in weight of grief and pathos any in American history-; for notwithstanding that nearly 16,000 out of a total of 16,542 Indians in North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama, had signed a protest against the treaty, Gen. Wool was sent to carry the treaty into effect; but so fixed was the determination of the Cherokees to remain that Gen. Winfield Scott was sent to remove them by force. He took command, his forces amounting to 7,000 men-regulars, militia and volunteers, with New Echota as his headquarters, May 10, 1838, only 2,000 Cherokees having gone voluntarily. Old people tell of the harrowing scenes which accompanied the hunting down and removal of these brave people who clung to their homes with all the passion of the Swiss. \\n\\nREMOVAL FORTS. The following forts or stockades were built for the collection of the unwilling Cherokees : Fort Lindsay, on the south side of the Little Tennessee at the junction of the Nantahala; Fort Scott, at Aquone, twenty miles further up the Nantahala; Fort Montgomery, at what is now Robbinsville; Fort Hembrie, at what is now Hayesville; Fort Delaney, at Old Valleytown, and Fort Butler, at Murphy. \\n\\n@@WHY SOME WERE ALLOWED TO REMAIN@@. Old man Tsali, or Charley, with his Wife, his brother and his three sons and their families, was seized and taken to a stockade near the junction of the Tuckaseegee and the Little Tennessee rivers, where they spent the night, during which their squaws concealed knives and tomahawks about their clothing. When this band, escorted by soldiers, reached the mouth of what is now called Paine's branch, opposite Tuskeegee creek, in the Little Tennessee, the squaws passed the knives and hatchets to the men, and they fell upon the soldiers and killed two of them upon the spot, and so mortally wounded a third, Geddings by name, that he died at Calhoun, Tenn. Still another soldier was struck on the back of his head with a tomahawk, and so hurt that. although he retained his seat upon his horse, he died three miles below at what is now called Fairfax, on the right bank of the Little Tennessee. Two stones still mark his grave, while the two who were killed at Paine's branch were buried there. If the skirts of the coat of the lieutenant in charge had not torn away when he was seized on each side by an Indian, it is likely that he would have been dragged from his horse and killed, too. But he escaped, and the Indians went immediately to the Great Smoky mountains scarcely ten miles away, and their recapture by the heavy dragoons sent after them within a short time was impossible. These soldiers camped just below where Burton Welch used to live, one and a half miles below Bushnel, and a mountain peak nearby on which they stationed sentinels, is still called Watch Mountain. In fact, these escaping Indians had spent the night at the house of Burton Welch's father when their squaws hid the weapons in their skirts. It is said that the late Col. W. H. Thomas had accompanied this party as far as the mouth of Noland's creek, Where he left them for the purpose of getting another small party to join them the next day; and that if he had continued with Old Charley's party it is probable that no attempt would have been made to escape, such was his influence over them. The names of the male Indians who escaped were Charley, Alonzo, Jake, George and a boy named Washington, but pronounced 15 the Cherokees Wasituna. Old Charley's squaw was named Nancy. \\n\\nTERMS OF COMPROMISE. Mr. James Mooney's account in the Nineteenth Ethnological report states that after Con. Scott became convinced that his soldiers could not recapture Charley and his band, he made an agreement with Col. Thomas to the effect that if he would cause the arrest of Old Charley and his adult sons he would use his influence at Washington to get permission that all who had not yet been removed should remain. Also, that Col. Thomas vent to the leader of those who had not been captured, Utsala or \"Lichen,\" by name, who had made his headquarters at the head of Oconaluftee, and told him that if he assisted in bringing in Charley and his band, Utsali and his followers, 1,000 in number, would be allowed to remain. Utsali consented and Thomas returned and reported to Gen. Scott, who offered to furnish an escort for Thomas on a proposed visit to Charley, who was hiding in a cave of the Great Smoky mountains. But Thomas declined the escort and went alone to the cave an(! got Charley to consent to surrender voluntarily, which he did shortly afterwards, thus making a vicarious sacrifice for the rest of his people. \\n\\n//Bottom line: some Indians hid weapons, went on warpath in refusal to be shipped out, killed a few whites, ran and hid. A deal was made that if Old Charley turned himself in, the others could stay behind.//\\n\\nAN EYE WITNESSES' ACCOUNT. But Mr. and Mrs. Burton Welch used to tell an altogether different story. They were living there at the time, and presumably knew much more than those who got their information at second hand sixty years later. Their account is that @@Utsali and his followers ran Old Charley and his sons down and brought them to Gen. Scott's soldiers; but insisted on killing them themselves@@ instead of having them shot by the soldiers. But they had not been captured together, Alonzo, Jake and George having been caught first at the head of Forney's creek, and shot at a point on the right bank of the Little Tennessee nearly opposite the mouth of Panther creek, and just below Burton Welch's home, where Jake gave a soldier ten cents to give to his squaw, that being all he had on earth to leave her. The three trees to which they were tied are now dead, but Burton Welch, who when a boy witnessed the execution, used to declare that these trees never grew any larger after having been made to serve as stakes for the shedding of human blood. These three Indians are buried in one grave near by, but there is now nothing to mark the spot. \\n\\nOLD CHARLEY IS KILLED AND HIS SQUAW MOURNS. It was some time afterwards that @@Old Charley was caught in the Smokier, brought to within a short distance below what is now Bryson City and shot by Indians@@. Mrs. Welch, Who was a first cousin of Captain James P. Sawyer of Asheville, saw Old Charley killed. This was before her marriage to Burton Welch, and she remembers that Charley had a white cloth tied around his forehead, and that she saw it stain red before she heard the report of the guns of the firing squad. The fugitive squaws were never punished. But Charley's squaw came to Mrs. Welch's father's house, where she was shown Old Charley's grave. She sat down beside it and piled up the sand with her hands until she made a mound, and then rocked herself to and fro and cried. Mrs. Welch went shortly afterwards to Old Charley's former home, one mile from the mouth of the Nantahala river. She spoke of the deserted look of the place, the little cabin with its open door, and old Nancy's spinning-wheel, her loom and warping bars, while outside, in the chimney corner, was Old Charley's plough-stock and harness, the traces of which had been made of hickory hark. \\n\\nDID THE GOVERNMENT WINK AT THIS COMPROMISE? As it seemed exceedingly improbable that the government would deliberately violate the terms of a treaty- that had been solemnly made with the Cherokees without the approval of the Senate, and allow a thousand Cherokees to remain behind, especially after General Jackson had emphatically refused to allow any of them to remain on any term, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs was asked for any official information that might be on file in his office concerning this matter, with this result: \"It is true that by supplemental articles of agreement pre-emption rights and reservations provided for the Cherokee, who remained east of the Mississippi were relinquished and declared void. (See 7 Stat. L, 488) However, many of the Indians did remain east of the Mississippi and the Act of Jul,-,,' 29, 1`38, (!3 Stat. L., 264) provided for the setting aside of a fund for these Indiana, the interest of which was to be paid them annually until their removal west of the Mississippi, when the principal was to be paid them.\" This letter is dated January 29, 1913, and was supplemental to another of January 21, 1913, in which this language is used: \"You are advised that nothing has been found in the files of this office regarding the alleged agreement of General Scott to allow part of the Cherokees to remain in North Carolina on condition that they surrender Old Charlie and his sons. \" Again, on February 27, 1913, he wrote: \"I have of course no objection to your quoting all or any part of office letters to you on this subject. As to your following these letters with the quotation given in your letter, I would rather not. express an opinion, since I had a search of the records made and found nothing about the alleged agreement to allow certain of the Cherokees to remain east of the Mississippi. I would not be warranted in saying that such an agreement was not made, since there were many things happening in the Indian country about that period of which this office has no record.\" \\n\\nRECOGNITION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE EASTERN BAND. On August 6, 1846, a treaty was concluded at Washington by which the rights of the Eastern Cherokees to a participation in the benefits of the New Echota treaty of 1835 were distinctly recognized, and provision made for the final adjustment of all unpaid and pending claims due under that treaty; the government having insisted before that time that those rights were conditional upon their removal to the West. Col. W. H. Thomas then took charge of the Eastern Band. 6 \\n\\nWILLIAM HOLLAND THOMAS. He was born in 1805 in Haywood county. His father was of a Welch family, fought at Rings Mountain under Col. Campbell, and was related to Zachary Taylor. His mother was descended from a Maryland family of Revolutionary stock. He was an only and posthumous child, his father having been accidentally drowned a short time before he was born. When twelve years old he was engaged to tend an Indian trading store on Soco creek by Felix Walker, son of the congressman who made a national reputation by \"talking for Buncombe. \" Here he studied law, and was duly admitted to practice. He was adopted by Yonaguska, the Cherokee chief, and was called Will-Usdi, or \"Little Will.\" He learned the spoken and written language, acquiring the Sequoya syllabary shortly after its invention. Soon after the removal of the Cherokees Thomas bought a fine farm near Whittier, and built a home which he called Stekoa, after the Indian town on the same site which had been destroyed by Rutherford in 1776. At the time of theremoval he owned five trading stores, viz: at Quallatown, at Murphy, at Charleston, Tenn., at Robbinsville and at Webster. As agent for the Cherokees he bought @@the five towns for them at Bird-town, Paint-town, Wolf-town, Yellow-hill, and Big Cove@@. He drew up a simple form of government for them, which was executed by Yonaguska till his death and afterwards by Thomas. In 1848 he entered the State Senate, and inaugurated a system of road improvement and was the father of the Western North Carolina railroad. He voted for secession in 1861, and in 1862 organized the Thomas Legion, composed of Cherokees and white citizens. After the war his health failed. His conduct of Cherokee affairs was settled by arbitrators, and it was found that the Indians had lost nothing, and had gained largely under his leadership. @@Col. Thomas, with 300 Indians and Col. James R. Love with 300 white soldiers, confronted Col. Bartlett of New York in April, 1865, near Waynesville@@__. At sight of the Indians and after hearing their yells Bartlett agreed to surrender__, and Col. Thomas paroled his men, allowing them to retain their side arms.' __Col. Thomas died May 12, 1893.__\\n\\nTHE LATE CAPTAIN JAMES W. TERRELL. \"In 1852 (Capt.) James W. Terrell was engaged by (Col. W. H.) Thomas, then in the State Senate, to take charge of his store at Qualla, and remained associated with him and in close contact with the Indians from then until after the close of the war, assisting, as special United States Agent, in the disbursement of the interest payments, and afterward as a Confederate officer in the organization of the Indian companies, holding a commission as captain of Company A, Sixty-ninth North Carolina Confederate infantry. Being of an investigating bent, Captain Terrell was led to give attention to the customs and mythology of the Cherokee, and to accumulate a fund of information on the subject seldom possessed by a white man.\" \\n\\nNORTH CAROLINA GIVES PERMISSION. \"In 1855 Congress directed the per capita payment to the East Cherokees of the removal fund established for them in 1818, provided that North Carolina should first give assurance that they would be allowed to remain permanently in that State. This assurance, however, was not given until 1866, and the money was therefore not distributed, but remained in the treasury until 1875, when it was made applicable to the purchase of lands and the quieting of titles for the benefit of the Indians.\" \\n\\nLANMAN, DANIEL WEBSTER'S SECRETARY. In the spring of 1818 the author, Lanman, visited the East Cherokees and has left an interesting account of their condition at the tune, together with a description of their ball-plays, dances, and customs generally, having been the guest of @@Colonel Thomas, of whom he speaks as the guide, counselor, and friend of the Indians, as well as their business agent and chief,@@ so that the connection was like that existing between a father and his children. He puts the number of Indians at about 800 Cherokee and 100 Catawba on the \"Quallatown\" reservation the name being in use thus early with 200 more Indians residing in the more westerly portion of the State. Of their general condition he says: \\n\\n@@CONDITION of INDIANS IN 1848@@. \"About three-fourths of the entire population can read in their own language, and, though the majority of them __understand English, a very few can speak the language__. They practice, to a considerable extent, the __science of agriculture__, and have acquired such a knowledge of the mechanic arts as answers them for all ordinary purposes, for they __manufacture their own clothing, their own ploughs, and other farming utensils, their own fixes, and even their own guns__. Their women are no longer treated as slaves, but as equals; the men labor in the fields and their wives are devoted entirely to household employments. They keep the wine domestic animals that are kept by their white neighbors, and cultivate all the common grains of the country. They are probably __as temperate as any other class of people__ on the face of the earth, __honest in their business intercourse, moral in their thought__,, words, and deeds, and distinguished for their faithfulness in performing the duties of religion. __They are chiefly Methodists and Baptists__, and have regularly ordained ministers, who preach to them on every Sabbath, and they have also abandoned many of their more senseless superstition. They have their own court and try their criminals by a regular jury. Their judges and lawyers are chosen from among themselves. They keep in order the public roads leading through their settlement. By a law of the State they have a right to vote, but seldom exercise that right, as they do not like the idea of heing identified with any of the political parties. Excepting on festive days, they __dress after the manner of the white man,__ but far more picturesquely. They __live in small log houses of their own construction__, and have everything they need or desire in the way of food. They are, in fact, __the happiest community that I have yet met__ with in this southern country.\" \\n\\nSALALI. Among the other notables Lanman speaks thus of Salili, \"Squirrel,\" a born mechanic of the band, who died only a few years since: \\n\"He is quite a young man and has a remarkably thoughtful face He is the blacksmith of his nation, and with some assistance supplies the whole of Qualla town with all their axes and plows; but what is more, he has manufactured a number of very superior rifles and pistols, including stock, barrel, and lock, and he is also the builder of grist mills, which grind all the corn which his people eat. A specimen of his workmanship in the way of a rifle may be seen at the Patent Office in Washington, where it was deposited by Mr. Thomas; and I believe Salali is the first Indian who ever manufactured an entire gun. But when it is remembered that he never received a particle of education in any of the mechanic arts, but is entirely self-taught, his attainments must be considered truly remarkable.\" \\n\\nCOLONEL THOMAS THWARTS GENERAL KIRBY SMITH. \"From 1855 until after the Civil War we find no official notice of the East Cherokees, and our information must be obtained from other sources. It was, however, a most. momentous period in their history. At the outbreak of the war Thomas was serving his seventh consecutive term in the State Senate. Being an ardent Confederate sympathizer, he was elected a delegate to the convention which passed the secession ordinance, and immediately after voting in favor of that measure resigned from the Senate in order to work for the Southern cause. As he was already well advanced in years it is doubtful if his effort would have gone beyond the raising of funds and other supplies but for the fact that at this juncture an effort was made by the Confederate General Kirby Smith to enlist the East Cherokees for active service. \\n\\nKIRBY SMITH's EMISSARY. \"The agent sent for this purpose was Washington Morgan, known to the Indians as Aganstata, son of that Colonel Gideon Morgan who had commanded the Cherokee at the Horseshoe Bend. By virtue of his Indian blood and historic ancestry he was deemed the most fitting emissary for the purpose. Early in 1862 he arrived among the Cherokee, and by appealing to old time memories so aroused the war spirit among them that a large number declared themselves ready to follow wherever he led. Conceiving the question at issue in the war to be one that (lid not concern the Indians, Thomas had discouraged their participation in it and advised them to remain at home in quiet neutrality. Now, however, knowing 'Morgan's reputation for reckless daring, he became alarmed at the possible result to them of such leadership. Forced either to see them go from his own protection or to lead them himself, he chose the latter alternative and proposed to them to enlist in the Confederate legion which he was about to organize. His object, as he himself has stated, was to keep them out of danger so far as possible by utilizing them as scouts and home guards through the mountains, away from the path of the large armies. Nothing of this was said to the Indains, who might not have been satisfied -,vith such an arrangement. Morgan went back alone and the Cherokee enrolled under the command of their white chief. \\n\\nFORMATION of THOMAS'S LEGION. \"The `Thomas Legion,' recruited in 1862 by William H. Thomas for the Confederate service and commanded by him as colonel, consisted originally of one infantry regiment of ten companies (@@Sixty-ninth North Carolina Infantry@@), one infantry battalion of six companies, one cavalry battalion of eight companies (@@First North Carolina Cavalry Battalion@@), one field battery (Light Battery) of 103 officers and men, and one company of engineers; in all about 2,800 men. The infantry battalion was recruited toward the close of the war to a full regiment of ten companies and two other companies of the __infantry regiment recruited later were composed almost entirely of East Cherokee Indians, most of the commissioned officers being white men.__ The @@whole number of Cherokee thus enlisted was nearly four hundred, or about every able-bodied man in the tribe@@.\" \\n\\nONE SECRET OF COL. THOMAS'S SUCCESS. Many have wondered how Col. Thomas could so soon have obtained complete control of all the affairs of the Eastern Band of Cherokees, and how he could have obtained from the Confederate government its consent for the organization of these Indians into an independent legion, subject almost entirely to his control, and @@required to operate only in the restricted territory immediately surrounding their reservation at Quallytown@@. But when it is remembered that his mother was Temperance Calvert, and that he himself was closely related to Zachary Taylor, President of the United States, whose daughter became the wife of .Jefferson Davis, President of the Southern Confederacy, much that was incomprehensible becomes plain. Indeed, all the so called Colvards of Ashe, Graham and Haywood counties claim that their real name was originally Calvert; that they are descendants of the Calverts of Maryland; and the late Captain James W. Terrell always insisted that Temperance Calvert was a grand-niece of Lord Baltimore himself. Col. Thomas was also first cousin to John Strother, whose family was one of influence and standing in Virginia in former days. (See N. C. University Magazine for May, 1899, pp. 291 to 295.) \\n\\nCHEROKEE SCOUTS AND HOME GUARDS. \"__In accordance with Thomas's plan the Indians were employed__@@ chiefly as scouts and home guards in the mountain region@@ along the Tennessee- Carolina border, where, according to the testimony of Colonel Stringfield, they did good work and service for the South. The most important engagement in which they were concerned occurred at Baptist gap, Tennessee, September 15, 1862, where Lieutenant Astugataga, a splendid specimen of Indian manhood, was killed in a charge. The Indians were furious at his death, and before they could be restrained they scalped one or two of the Federal dead. For this action ample apologies were afterwards given by their superior officers. __The war, in fact, brought out all the latent Indian in their nature. Before starting to the front every man@@ consulted an oracle stone @@to learn whether or not he might hope to return in safety__. The start was celebrated with a grand old-time war-dance at the townhouse on Soco, . . . the Indians being @@painted and feathered in good old style,@@ Thomas himself frequently assisting as master of ceremonies. The@@ ball-play@@, too, was not forgotten, and on one occasion a detachment of Cherokees, left to guard a bridge, became so engrossed in the excitement of the game as to narrowly escape capture by a sudden dash of the Federals. Owing to Thomas's care for their welfare, they suffered but slightly in actual battle, although a number died of hardship and disease. When the Confederates evacuated eastern Tennessee, in the winter of 1863-64, some of the white troops of the legion, with one or two of the Cherokee companies, were shifted to western Virginia, and by assignment to other regiments a few of the Cherokee were present at the final siege and surrender of Richmond. The main body of the Indians, with the rest of the Thomas Legion, crossed over into North Carolina and did service protecting the western border until the close of the war, when @@they surrendered on parole at Waynesville@@__, North Carolina, in May 1865, all those of the command being allowed to keep their gun,.__ It is claimed by their officers that @@they were the last of the Confederate forces to surrender@@. About fifty of the Cherokee veterans still survive (in 1899), nearly half of whom, under conduct of Colonel Stringfield, attended the Confederate reunion at Louisville, Kentucky, in 1900, where they attracted much attention. \\n\\nCONFEDERATE CONGRESS PROVIDES FUNDS. \"In 1863, by resolution of February 12, the Confederate House of Representatives called for information as to the number and condition of the East Cherokee, and their pending relations with the Federal government at the beginning of the war, with a view to continuing these relations under Confederate auspices. In response to this inquiry a report was submitted by the Confederate Commissioner of Indian Affairs, S. S. Scott, based on information furnished by Colonel Thomas and Captain James W. Terrell, their former disbursing agent, showing that interest upon the `removal and subsistence fund' established in 1848 had been paid annually up to and including the year 1859, at the rate of 53.20 per capita, or an aggregate, exclusive of disbursing agent's commission, of 84,838.40 annually, based upon the original Mullay enumeration of 1,517. \\n\"Upon receipt of this report it was enacted 1>y the Confederate Congress that the sum of $19,302.36 he paid the East Cherokee to cover the interest period of four years from May 23, 1860 to May 23, 1864. \\n\\nCAPTURED CHEROKEES DESERT CONFEDERACY. \"In a skirmish near Bryson City (then Charleston), Swain county, North Carolina, about a year after enlistment, a small party of Cherokees-perhaps a dozen in number-were captured by a detachment of Union troops and carried to Knoxville, where, having become dissatisfied with their experience in the Confederate service, they were easily- persuaded to go over to the Union side. Through the influence of their principal man, Diganeski, several others mere induced to desert to the Union army, making about thirty in all. As a part of the Third North Carolina Mounted Volunteer Infantry, they- served with the Union forces in the same region until the close of the war, when they returned to their homes to find their tribesmen so bitterly incensed against them that for some time their lives were in clanger. Eight of these were still alive in 1900. \\n\\nAFTER CIVIL WAR. \"Shortly after this event Colonel Thomas was compelled by physical and mental infirmity to retire from further active participation in the affairs of the East Cherokee, after more than half a century spent in intimate connection with them, during the greater portion of which time he had been their most trusted friend and adviser. Their affairs at once became the prey of confusion and factional strife, which continued until the United States stepped in as arbiter. \\n\\nCHEROKEES ADOPT NEW GOVERNMENT, 1870. \"On December 9, 1868, a general council of the East Cherokee assembled at Cheowa, in Graham county, North Carolina, took preliminary steps toward the adoption of a regular form of tribal government under a constitution. N. J. Smith, afterward principal chief, was clerk of the council. The new government was formally inaugurated on December 1, 1870. \\nSTATUS OF INDIAN LANDS. \"The status of the lands held by the Indians had now become a matter of serious concern. As has been stated, the deeds had been made out by Thomas in his own name, as the State laws at that time forbade Indian ownership of real estate. In consequence of his losses during the war and his subsequent disability, the Thomas properties, of which the Cherokee lands were technically a part, had become involved, so that the entire estate had passed into the hands of creditors, the most important of whom, William Johnston, had obtained sheriff's deeds in 1869 for all of these Indian lands under three several judgments against Thomas, aggregating $33,887.11.To adjust the matter so as to secure title and possession to the Indians, Congress in 1870 authorized suit to be brought in their name for the recovery of their interest. This suit was begun in 'May, 1873, in the United States Circuit Court for western North Carolina. A year later the matters in dispute were submitted by agreement to a board of arbitrators, whose award was confirmed by the court in November, 187-1. \\n\\nLAND STATUS SETTLED BY ARBITRATION. \"The award finds that Thomas had purchased with Indian funds a tract estimated to contain 50,000 acres on Oconaluftee river and Soco creek, and known as the Qualla boundary, together with a number of individual tracts outside the boundary; that the Indians were still indebted to Thomas toward the purchase of the Qualla boundary lands for the sum of $18,250, from which should be deducted 86,500 paid by them to Johnston to release titles, with interest to date of award, making an aggregate of 88,486, together with a further sum of 82,478, which had been intrusted to Terrell, the business clerk and assistant of Thomas, and by him turned over to Thomas, as creditor of the Indians, under power of attorney, this latter sum, with interest to date of award, aggregating 82,697.89; thus leaving a balance due from the Indians to Thomas or his legal creditor, Johnston, of $7,066.11. The award declares that Johnston should be allowed to hold the lands bought by him only as security for the balance due him until paid, and that on the payment of the said balance of 87,066.11, -,vith interest at six per cent from the date of the award, the Indians should be entitled to a clear conveyance from him of the legal title to all the lands embraced within the Qualla boundary. \\n\\nPART OF SUBSISTENCE FUND USED TO CLEAR TITLE. \"To enable the Indians to clear off this lien on their lands and for other purposes, Congress in 1875 directed that as much as remained of the `removal and subsistence fund' set apart for their benefit in 1848 should be used `in perfecting the titles to the lands awarded to them, and to pay the costs, expenses, and liabilities attending their recent. litigations, also to purchase and extinguish the titles of any- white persons to lands within the general boundaries alotted to them by the court, and for the education, improvement, and civilization of their people.' In accordance with this authority- the unpaid balance and interest clue Johnston, amounting to $7,242.76, was paid him in the same year, and shortly afterward there was purchased on behalf of the Indians some fifteen thousand acres additional, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs being constituted trustee for the Indians. For the better protection of the Indians the lands were made inalienable except by assent of the council and upon approval of the President of the United States. \\n\\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS ASSUMES CONTROL. \"The titles and boundaries having been adjusted, the Indian Office assumed regular supervision of East Cherokee affairs, and in June, 1875, the first agent since the retirement of Thomas was sent out in the person of W. C. McCarthy He found the Indians, according to his report, destitute and discouraged, almost without stock or farming tools. There were no schools, and very few full-bloods could speak English, although to their credit nearly all could read and write their own language, the parents teaching the children. Under his authority a distribution was made of stock animals, seed wheat, and farming tools, and several schools were started. In the next year, however, the agency was discontinued and the educational interests of the band turned over to the State School Superintendent. \\n\\nTHE OLD INDIAN FRIENDS, THE QUAKERS. \"The neglected condition of the East Cherokee having been brought to the attention of those old time friends of the Indian, the @@Quakers@@, through an appeal made in their behalf by members of that society residing in North Carolina, the Western Yearly Meeting, of Indiana, volunteered to undertake the work of civilization and education. On May 31, 1881, representatives of the Friends entered into a contract with the Indians, subject to approval by the Government, to establish and continue among them for ten years @@an industrial school and other common schools@@, to be supported in part from the annual interest of the trust fund held by the Government to the credit of the East Cherokee and in part by funds furnished by the Friends themselves. Through the efforts of Barnabas C. Hobbs, of the Western Yearly Meeting, a yearly contract to the same effect was entered into with the Commissioner of Indian Affairs later in the same year, and was renewed by successive commissioners to cover the period of ten years ending June 30, 1892, when the contract system was terminated and the Government assumed direct control. Under the joint arrangement, with some aid at the outset from the North Carolina Meeting, work was begun in 1881 by Thomas Brown with several teachers sent out by the Indiana Friends, who established a small training school at the agency headquarters at Cherokee, and several day schools in the outlying settlements. He was succeeded three years later by H. Spray, an experienced educator, who, with a corps of efficient assistants and greatly enlarged facilities, continued to do good work for the elevation of the Indians until the close of the contract system eight years later. After an interregnum, (luring which the schools suffered from frequent changes, he was reappointed as government agent and superintendent in 1898, a position which he still holds in 1901. To the work conducted under his auspices the East Cherokee owe much of what they have today of civilization and enlightenment. \\n\\nEASTERN BAND SUES IN COURT OF CLAIMS. \"The East Cherokee had never ceased to contend for a participation in the rights and privileges accruing to the western nation under treaties with the government. In 1882 a special agent had been appointed to investigate their claims and in the following year, under authority of Congress, the eastern band of Cherokee brought suit in the Court of Claims against the United States and the Cherokee Indians. The case was decided adversely to the eastern band, first by the Court of Claims in 1885, and finally, on appeal, by the Supreme Court on March 1, 1886, that court holding in its decision that the Cherokee in North Carolina had dissolved their connection with the Cherokee nation and ceased to be a part of it when they refused to accompany the main body at the Removal, and that if Indians in North Carolina or in any state east of the Mississippi wished to enjoy the benefits of the common property of the Cherokee Nation in any form whatever they must be readmitted to citizenship in the Cherokee Nation and comply with its constitution and laws. \\n\\nEASTERN BAND INCORPORATED. \"In order to acquire a more definite legal status, the Cherokee residing in North Carolina-being practically all those of the eastern band having genuine Indian interests-became a corporate body under the laws of the state in 1889.In 1894 the long-standing litigation between the East Cherokee and a number of creditors and claimants to Indian lands within and adjoining the Qualla boundary was finally settled by a compromise by which the several white tenants and claimants within the boundary agreed to execute a quitclaim and vacate on payment to them by the Indians of sums aggregating $24,552, while for another disputed adjoining tract of 33,000 acres the United States agreed to pay, for the Indians, at the rate of $1.25 per acre. The necessary government approval having been obtained, Congress appropriated a sufficient amount for carrying into effect the agreement, thus at last completing a perfect and unencumbered title to all the lands claimed by the Indians, with the exception of a few outlying tracts of comparative unimportance. \\n\\nEXACT LEGAL STATUS STILL IN DISPUTE. \"The exact legal status of the East Cherokee is still a matter of dispute, they being at once wards of the government, citizens of the United States, and (in North Carolina) a corporate body under state laws. They pay real estate taxes and road service, exercise the voting privilege and are amenable to local courts, but do not pay poll tax or receive any pauper assistance from the counties; neither can they make free contracts or alienate their lands. Under their tribal constitution they are governed by a principal and an assistant chief, elected for a term of four years, with an executive council appointed by the chief, and sixteen councilors elected by the various settlements for a term of two years. The annual council is held in October at Cherokee, on the reservation, the proceedings being in the Cherokee language and recorded by their clerk in the Cherokee alphabet, as well as in English. \\n\\nPRESENT MATERIAL CONDITIONS. \"The majority are fairly comfortable, far above the condition of most Indian tribes, and but little, if any, behind their white neighbors. In literary ability they may even be said to surpass them, as in addition to the result of nearly twenty years of school work among the younger people, nearly- all the men and some of the women can read and write their own language. All wear civilized costumes, though an @@occasional pair of moccasins is seen,@@ while the women find means to gratify the racial @@love of color in the wearing of red bandanna kerchiefs@@ in place of bonnets. The @@older people still cling to their ancient rites@@__ and sacred traditions, but the dance and the ballplay wither and the Indian day is nearly spent. \" __\\n\\n@@EASTERN BAND TRY TO SELL TIMBER@@. Since Mr. Moody's concluding words were written the courts have managed still more to confuse the legal status of the Cherokees, for in September, 1893, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, acting as a corporation of the State of North Carolina, by virtue of Chapter 211, Private Laws of 1889, __sold and conveyed to David L. Boyd certain timber on the Cathcart tract of the Qualla boundary__, containing about 30,000 acres. In January, 1894, David L. Boyd sold said trees to H. M. Dickson and William T. Mason, who afterwards conveyed them to the Dickson-Mason Lumber Company. Before beginning to cut these trees the Dickson-Mason Company was apprised of the fact that the @@Department of the Interior of the United States had not sanctioned the sale of this timber@@, and refused to ratify the contract. This company, on the other hand, had been advised that the band of Indians were citizens of North Carolina and not tribal Indians, and, therefore, had the right to convey the trees; and desiring to have the question tested by the courts, put a few men to work cutting the timber, at the same time notifying the agents of the Government and the United States District Attorney of the fact. The government instituted a suit in which it asked a perpetual injunction against the Dickson-'Mason Company; but at the next term of the United States Court at Asheville, in November, 1894, the government voluntarily took a nonsuit in the cause, the Attorney General holding that \"the legal status of the Indians in question is that of citizens of 1 orth Carolina; that they have been in all respects citizens since the date of or soon after the treaty with the Cherokees of 1885 [1835'], and this with the consent of the United States expressed in that treaty, by the election of the Indians and the consent of --North Carolina. They have voted at all elections for half a century, and are citizens of the United State. It seems clear that Congress could not, by the Act of July 27, 1868, or otherwise (if such was the intention) make of them an Indian tribe or place them under the control of the United States as Indians, any more effectually than if they- had been white citizens of Massachusetts or Georgia (Eastern Band Cherokee Indians t,. the United Males and Cherokee Nation, 117 U. S. 228). Neither could such citizens of North Carolina make themselves a tribe of Indians within that State.\" \\n\\n@@INTERIOR DEPARTMENT INTERVENES@@. Accordingly, the Dickson-Mason Company began malting large and expensive preparations for cutting the timber on the Cathcart boundary. But, it turned out later, that the Interior Department was not satisfied with this disposition of the matter and commenced another action based on the same facts, but alleging fraud in obtaining the Boyd contract from the Indians. Judge C. H. Simonton (in U. S. r. Boyd, 68 Fed. Rep., 587) held that the Eastern Band of Cherokees were not tribal Indians, but wards of the Government which, like any other guardian, had the right to see that any contract made by them was for their benefit and not to their detriment. In an opinion filed by him he held that \"the case of the Cherokee trust fund (117 U. S., 288) does not conflict with these views. That case decides that this Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is not a part of the nation of Cherokees with which this Government treats, and that they have no recognized separate political existence. But, at the same time, their distinct unity is recognized, and the fostering care of the Government over them as such distinct unit. This being so, the United States have the right in their own Courts to bring such suits as may be necessary to protect these Indians. \" \\n\\nGOVERNMENT APPEALS FROM DECISION. The case was then referred to Hon. R. H. Douglas, Standing 'Master, who, in November, 1895, found that the price paid for the timber (815,000) was fair and that there was no fraud in making the contract. This report was confirmed, but the Government appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals from so much of the decree as hel"
