        "text": "This week we have another 30 newspaper titles up on DigitalNC! In the September 3, 1891 issue of Boone’s Watauga Democrat we have an article describing the terrible train wreck of Bostian’s Bridge in Statesville. This fatal accident sparked a legendary North Carolina ghost story, but perhaps even scarier are the boogeymen railroad companies would often create to avoid accountability: train wreckers.\n\nBy 1891 the railroad system in America had exploded, allowing for easier cross-country travel and bringing with it fresh new paranoia about disasters and scary strangers coming to your town. Blaming a wreck on some shady character was a lot easier than paying a fortune on settlements due to negligence. Almost immediately after the August 27, 1891 accident, the Richmond & Danville Railroad Company put out ads offering a $10,000 reward for the apprehension of the perpetrator, leading to many being accused and arrested (conveniently with the help of a railroad detective).\n\nThe editor at Statesville’s Landmark provides us with an incredibly detailed account of the accident and the recovery effort, complete with interviews from survivors and witnesses where they describe rotten cross-ties and rail workers throwing this evidence into the creek below the bridge. Many of those interviewed make a point to mention that there were no signs of robbery after the crash, which doesn’t exactly support the idea of this being some dastardly deed by a bandit.\n\nOver the next year, we’ll be adding millions of newspaper images to DigitalNC. These images were originally digitized a number of years ago in a partnership with Newspapers.com. That project focused on scanning microfilmed papers published before 1923 held by the North Carolina Collection in Wilson Special Collections Library. While you can currently search all of those pre-1923 issues on Newspapers.com, over the next year we will also make them available in our newspaper database as well. This will allow you to search that content alongside the 2 million pages already on our site – all completely open access and free to use.\n\nThis week’s additions include:\n\nAsheville\n\nWestern North Carolina Baptist (Asheville, N.C.) – 1886\n\nThe Epworth News (Asheville, N.C.) – 1891\n\nBoone\n\nWatauga Democrat (Boone, N.C.) – 1888-1914\n\nBurlington\n\nThe Burlington Falcon (Burlington, N.C.) – 1925\n\nChapel Hill\n\nThe Chapel Hill News (Chapel Hill, N.C.) – 1893-1894\n\nThe News (Chapel Hill, N.C.) – 1898-1917\n\nDurham\n\nThe Trinity League Record (Durham, N.C.) – 1894-1895\n\nThe Christian Educator (Durham, N.C.) – 1896\n\nFayetteville\n\nFayetteville Observer [1816-1865] (Fayetteville, N.C.) – 1834-1865\n\nThe Fayetteville Advertiser and Gazette (Fayetteville, N.C.) – 1871\n\nFayetteville Observer [1880-1919] (Fayetteville, N.C.) – 1883-1885\n\nFayetteville Observer [1880-1919] (Fayetteville, N.C.) – 1887-1900\n\nThe Home-Florist (Fayetteville, N.C.) – 1890\n\nFairfield\n\nHyde County Messenger (Fairfield, N.C.) – 1934-1941\n\nGastonia\n\nThe Gastonia Gazette (Gastonia, N.C.) – 1886-1892\n\nHolly Springs\n\nThe Cape Fear Enterprise (Holly Springs, N.C.) – 1899-1901\n\nJackson\n\nThe Northampton Reporter–Supplement (Jackson, N.C.) – 1879\n\nKinston\n\nKinston Journal (Kinston, N.C.) – 1878-1882\n\nLexington\n\nThe Normal Echo (Lexington, N.C.) – 1886\n\nLincolnton\n\nThe Literary South (Lincolnton, N.C.) – 1937\n\nPittsboro\n\nThe Semi-Monthly Record of the Pittsboro’ Scientific Academy (Pittsboro, N.C.) – 1866\n\nRaleigh\n\nRaleigh Register, and North-Carolina Gazette (Raleigh, N.C.) – 1836\n\nThe Daily Standard (Raleigh, N.C.) – 1865\n\nThe Gazette (Raleigh, N.C.) – 1871\n\nMonthly Bulletin, North Carolina Department of Agriculture (Raleigh, N.C.) – 1883-1884\n\nThe Belles-Lettres (Raleigh, N.C.) – 1885\n\nSalisbury\n\nThe Farmer’s Journal (Salisbury, N.C.) – 1846-1847\n\nTarboro\n\nThe Edgecombe Farm-Journal (Tarboro, N.C.) – 1860\n\nWinston\n\nThe Independent Supplement (Winston, N.C.) – 1885\n\nThe Broad Street Worker (Winston, N.C.) – 1894"
