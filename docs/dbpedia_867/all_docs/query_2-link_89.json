        "text": "Railway\n\nThis is the sign which was in use when Winslow station closed on 30 Dec 1967.\n\nArthur Clear: A Thousand Years of Winslow Life (1888), p.20\n\nIn conclusion we can only briefly refer to the events of recent years. In 1841, the Boys' School was built. In 1843, the Town was first lighted with Gas. On the 25th March, 1850, an experimental trip was made on the newly-formed Buckinghamshire Railway, Mr. Brassey, the Contractor, provided a Dinner for the directors and friends, to the number of 150, at Winslow, when Sir Harry Verney spoke, and on the first of May following, the line was opened to Winslow, there being four trains each way daily.\n\nAccording to Lipscomb, Winslow in the 1840s was a depressed place which had been reduced \"to the condition of a mere village\", so the arrival of the railway was especially significant.\n\nSee Railway proposals 1845 for 3 alternative schemes which would have put Winslow on different routes, but were all abandoned by 1846 when the Oxford and Bletchley Junction Railway was established by act of Parliament, becoming the Buckinghamshire Railway in 1847. The exact route was in some doubt, leading to the following petition with about 300 signatures.\n\nTNA, RAIL 555/3: petition dated 2 July 1846\n\nTo The Directors of the intended Railway from Oxford to Bletchley\n\nWe the undersigned Inhabitants of the Town of Winslow and the neighbouring parishes beg leave most respectfully to draw your attention to the proximity of the Town of Winslow a market and post Town having annually Eleven important cattle and other fairs to the line of your intended Railway and to express to you our anxious wish that a first class station should be erected as near as conveniently may be to the junction of the Turnpike and Great Horwood roads at the end of the Town towards Buckingham a situation which would not only be beneficial to the Town by saving the heavy expence of carriage of coals and merchandise from and to a more distant station, but would also in our opinion be most convenient for the inhabitants of a number of considerable villages in the immediate vicinity, and at the same time the best calculated to increase the traffic on the Line\n\nDated this 2nd day of July 1846.\n\n[The signatures are arranged in five columns]\n\n[Col.1] W.

B. Dudley, Esq., of Winslow on the part of various proprietors of land, through which the Oxford and Bletchley is about to be constructed, were engaged at the Bell Inn, in determining the claims and adjusting the compensation to be paid to the several owners. Every thing pertaining to the concern was most agreeably conducted, and the greatest satisfaction to the parties, for whom they were the representatives, was the result of their negotiations.\n\nThe foreman of the bricklayers working on the railway was Samuel Bates who revived the Baptist cause in Winslow.\n\nBucks Herald, 13 May 1848: death of a worker\n\nWINSLOW. FUNERAL OF A RAILWAY NAVVY.- Lately, at Winslow, the body of John Noyes, late time-keeper to Mr. E. Arblaster, a contractor on the Winslow Line of Railway, was interred in the churchyard. He was followed by 60 of the railway men, and by nearly 300 of the inhabitants of Winslow, who showed a great respect for deceased, as he bore an excellent character in the situation he filled. He was in the 30th year of his age.\n\nThe surname is given as Nourse in the Civil Registration Index, and can't be traced in the GRO Online Index.\n\nNorthampton Mercury, 26 Aug 1848: a setback\n\nSINKING OF A BRIDGE ON THE BUCKINGHAMSHIRE RAILWAY. – The centre pier of a four-arch bridge on the Buckinghamshire Railway at Addington Planks, about two and a half miles from Winslow, sank about two feet on the 17th inst., and it was only by “shoaling up” and propping that it was saved from falling. It was built on a boggy foundation. The bridge must come down and be re-built.\n\nBucks Herald, 30 June 1849: policing\n\nSWEARING SPECIAL CONSTABLES.- Messrs. Tierney and Wilmot were again sworn in as special constables for the Winslow and Buckingham railway lines, and C. Hodgson was sworn in for the Mursley line.\n\nBucks Herald, 25 Aug 1849: bridge begun\n\nRAILWAY STATION. – Considerable progress has been made in erecting the station-house and other buildings on the railway here. The bridge also over the railway, on the Buckingham road, is begun; and we understand that the whole line will be completed by the 1st of March next.\n\nBucks Herald, 22 Sep & 20 Oct 1849: accidents\n\nW I N S L O W. ACCIDENT. – An accident of a serious nature happened at the railway station here last week to two carpenters at work there, a very large door falling down by some means on them, and although much crushed and hurt fortunately no bones were broken.\n\nAn accident happened to a labourer, named David Watts, while working on the railway line on Tuesday last, when a large quantity of earth fell on him and broke the poor man’s thigh. Messrs. Cowley, surgeons, were sent for, and were soon on the spot, and in three-quarters of an hour the bone was set, and the sufferer is going on favourably. It is a singular fact that this is the only case of broken bones that has happened on the Winslow line since the commencement.\n\nBucks Herald, 30 March 1850: the railway opens\n\nBUCKINGHAM RAILWAY\n\nThis line being now so far advanced that it can be travelled upon, the contractors, Messrs. Brassey and Co., and other gentlemen connected with this undertaking, went over it on Tuesday, last, from Bletchley to Banbury, in a train, consisting of several carriages and on their return stopped at the Winslow station to a dinner, given by the contractors, and which was on the most liberal scale. The whole of the building was very neatly and appropriately decorated for the occasion with flags and laurels. &c. Amongst the former we noticed the following:- Success to the Supporters of the Railway;\" \"Success to the Bucks Railway;\" \"Health, Wealth, and Long Life to Thomas Brassey;\" and \"Success to the Winslow Station.\"\n\nThe dinner was laid out in a handsome tent in the Good's shed, and which consisted of every delicacy of the season; indeed no expense appeared to have been spared on the occasion, and all was arranged under the good management of Mr. Neal. landlord of the Bell Inn, in such an excellent manner as to entitle him to much credit. Shortly after three o'clock, the company, consisting of about 120 gentlemen, sat down to dinner, T. Brassey, Esq., in the chair. Amomg the company, we noticed - Cobb, Esq., Major Dewes, H. Humphreys, Esq., and other Directors, the Rev. W. Fremantle, R. Chandler, Esq., Mayor of Buckingham. - Gough, Esq.. Mayor of Banbury, W. Stone, T. Bartlett. G. Nelson, H. Smith, G.H. Haslop, P. Box and Thomas Swain, Esqrs., of Buckingham; several gentlemen from Brackley; G. Cowley and B. Dudley, Esqrs., and other gentlemen of Winslow and its neighbourhood. After the usual loyal toasts and other appropriate ones had been drank, and some spirited and suitable speeches had been delivered, the chief portion of the company soon after, six o'clock left to return by the train, no doubt highly delighted with their excursion\n\nOn Wednesday, a substantial dinner was provided in the same tent, to the sub-contractors, clerks, time-keepers. and all the navvies employed on the line, and they as well as all partook of the contractor's liberality, seemed to be highly delighted. About 600 more of the same class of men employed on this line were likewise entertained at Brackley, on Thursday, with a good substantial repast, and a good allowance of ale.\n\nWinslow's disused station in 1989, before demolition\n\nBucks Herald, 11 May 1850: new business\n\nJOSEPH HOWARD RESPECTFULLY informs the Inhabitants of WINSLOW and the Neighbourhood, that he has made arrangements for a SUPPLY OF COALS, AT WINSLOW STATION WHARF, on the OPENING of the BUCKINGHAMSHIRE RAILWAY, on WEDNESDAY NEXT, the 15th instant, which for Quality and Price he trusts will give general satisfaction, and requests the favour of their Patronage and Support.\n\nJ. H. returns his sincere thanks for the very liberal support he has received at AYLESBURY, which concern he will continue as usual.\n\nAylesbury, May 8, 1850.\n\nBucks Herald, 31 Aug 1850: another fatality\n\nFATAL ACCIDENT. – On Thursday week, the 22nd instant, a most distressing accident occurred to a poor labourer employed at the Winslow Station of the North Western Railway. It was the duty of the deceased to attend to the greasing of the wheels of the ballast waggon; and it appears that he was in the act of doing so, and had examined one side of the train, and, instead of going round it, he passed between two of the waggons, when the train was suddenly put In motion, and the poor fellow was completely crushed. He was removed, but life was quite extinct. An inquest was held on the body by Mr. D. P King, coroner, of Buckingham, and a verdict of “Accidental Death” was returned.\n\nBucks Chronicle, 5 Oct 1850: a boost to trade\n\nWINSLOW CATTLE MARKET.\n\nPERIODICAL SALE OF LIVE AND DEAD FARMING STOCK, &c., &c.\n\nMr. James King\n\nRESPECTFULLY announces that, at the solicitation of several gentlemen of the Neighbourhood, he has determined on Commencing a Periodical Sale of Farming Stock.\n\nTo be held on the WINSLOW CATTLE-MARKET-DAY, the SECOND and FOURTH THURSDAY in EVERY MOKNTH.\n\nT H E F I R S T S A L E WILL TAKE PLACE, I N T H E M A R K E T,\n\nOn Thursday, the 10th day of October, 1850, AT ELEVEN O’CLOCK.\n\nFrom the situation of Winslow in the centre of a great Stock District, and the facility and cheapness of transit afforded by the Buckinghamshire Railway, it is anticipated that the advantages offered by the establishment of a Periodical Sale are such as to ensure its permanency.\n\nIt is requested that gentlemen having Stock to dispose of at these Sales will send particulars thereof, one week prior to the Sale, to the office of the Auctioneer, Market-square, Winslow.\n\nThe terms will be very moderate; and everything Sold will be paid for at Three o’Clock the same day.\n\nWinslow, 25th September, 1850.\n\nBucks Advertiser and Aylesbury News, 21 Dec 1850\n\nThe difficulty of working a line with a single road of rails is now apparent, and notwithstanding the advantage of the electric telegraph for communication between the various stations, punctuality is not to be found. A train wrong makes others the same, and some days not one is at the station at the time pointed out on the tables. As they can only pass at the stations, it is necessary, in order to avoid collisions, to keep, in case another train should be due, passengers waiting at the station till the line is clear. Thus, as on Thursday last, a train due at Banbury might be seen at the Buckingham station waiting for the up train for Bletchley, due at Buckingham. The traffic is now great, and we shall be disappointed if we do not ere long see the whole line with double rails.\n\nBucks Herald, 16 Nov 1850: the first fare dodger\n\nA GENTLEMAN WITHOUT HIS TICKET! – On Tuesday last, Master Eastern was summoned by the Railway Station Master, Stainson, for riding from Winslow to Buckingham, he not having paid his fare. – Fine and costs, £1:10 inflicted. – The defendant paid the money.\n\nBanbury Guardian, 20 Feb 1851: Station Inn opens\n\nTHE STATION.- Travellers to and from the Winslow Station have now the advantage of a house of public entertainment, where provisions are attainable. The Station Inn is now open, and is found both useful and convenient.\n\nRAILWAY LOADING.- The station-yard presents the appearance of a timber depot. The large fall from the estate of W. S. Lowndes, Esq., at Whaddon, is now in course of transit to London and Sunderland, for Government purposes.\n\nThe original Buckinghamshire Railway line ran from Bletchley to Banbury, but the line through to Oxford was opened on 1 July 1851, and it became part of the Oxford to Cambridge route. Winslow was the place for changing trains between the Oxford and Banbury lines until Verney Junction station opened in 1868. The first stationmaster was William Hazelgrove from London, b.1815 or 1816.\n\nA burglary in Winslow in February 1851 was blamed on people being able to come to the town easily from London, so the effects weren't all seen as positive.\n\nThe Oxford Journal recorded an \"excursion train\" on 12 July 1851 from Banbury via Brackley and Buckingham to London which \"had about 700 passengers when it left the Winslow station.\" Here is the advert (Banbury Guardian, 10 July 1851):\n\nLondon and North Western Railway.\n\nCHEAP EXCURSION TRAIN TO THE\n\nG R E A T E X H I B I T I O N.\n\nFrom Banbury to London and Back.\n\nAn Excursion Train will leave BANBURY for LONDON, on the Afternoon of SATURDAY, the 12th JULY, at Half-past Three o’Clock.\n\nLeave Banbury, 3.30 pm, Brackley, 3.45, Leave Buckingham, 4.0 pm, Winslow, 4.15\n\nThe Return Train will leave the Euston Square Station on the Evening of the following Tuesday, the 15th July, at 7 o’clock.\n\nFares from all the above Stations for the Double Journey,\n\nFirst Class. 7s. Second Class. 4s. 6d.\n\nBy Order, MARK HUISH.\n\nNOTE FOR PASSENGERS TO THE CITY – The East and West India Dock Railway is now open, and Passengers may alight at Camden Town and proceed by Rail to Fenchurch Street. Fares from Camden Town to Fenchurch Street: - First Class, 6d; Second Class 4d.\n\nBucks Chronicle, 18 Oct 1851: alleged theft\n\nThis case from the Bucks Quarter Sessions gives an impression of what the station was like in its early days. Jesse Cowley was originally from Castlethorpe, and lived in Buckingham Road in the 1851 Census. Despite the verdict, this incident probably ended his railway career as in 1861 he was a shoemaker in Newport Pagnell.\n\nJesse Cowley, 35, charged with having, on the 20th day of August last, at Winslow, feloniously stonlen six knives, of the value of two shillings, and six forks, of the value of one shilling, the property of the London and North-Western Railway Company.\n\nMr. Power prosecuted. He stated that the prisoner was a porter at the Winslow railway station, and that he had stolen the goods in their transit.\n\nMr. Browne defended the prisoner.\n\nCharles Gwynne – Am a constable in the railway police; in consequence of information, I was watching at the station at Winslow for a fortnight; at six o’clock on the morning of the 26th of August the prisoner was unloading some trucks into a waggon, and it went away; I was then in concealment; I afterwards saw the prisoner go from the goods-shed to the station-house with some papers; he afterwards crossed the road leading to Winslow, and then turned back to the goods-shed which he had left about five minutes; he then got upon the stage and looked about him; I then saw him crawl upon his hands and knees under the stage and bring out half-a-dozen black handled knives and forks; he rolled them up in a piece of brown paper, and put them under his jacket, which he buttoned up; watched him, and he went to his house, about a quarter of a mile off; when he came back to his work I went to him, and charged him with stealing half-a-dozen knives and forks; he said “Do you, sir;” I then took him into custody; left him in charge of a person named King and went to his house, where I saw his wife, and on searching found half-a-dozen black-handled knives and forks under the sofa cushion; they resembled those I had seen him take; as I was taking the prisoner to the lock-up, he told me that he was over head and ears in debt, and that was the reason he took the knives and forks. [The knives and forks were here produced, as also were some others the policeman had received from George Freeman of Oxford, on the same day the robbery was committed].\n\nCross examined – The knives and forks were such as those commonly used by men in the same station as the prisoner and myself, and probably in gentlemen’s kitchen; while watching, I was concealed under some tarpauling with some fowls; this was in a corner near the goods’ stage; some parties might have known that I was there; I went to “roost” about nine o’clock in the evening, and left my place of concealment about eight in the morning; I was under the tarpauling when I saw the prisoner steal the knives.\n\nBy the Court – The knives and forks I found in the prisoner’s houses were quite new, and did not appear to have been used.\n\nMr. Hazlegrove, the station master at Winslow – I was aware that Gwynne watched the premises under the tarpauling; he did so under my direction; the prisoner came to me and wanted me to go to the good-shed and look at a parcel; I did so and a parcel containing knives and forks apparently burst open; he said the parcel arrived in that state; told him to make a note on the parcel and also in his book as to the condition in which it arrived; the parcel was directed to Mr. Freeman, of Oxford, and was forwarded to him the same day.\n\nCross-examined – The prisoner has been in the employ of the company about 12 months, and had previously borne a good character; others might have seen the policeman go in and out of the station; but I do not think he was known to be a “detective.”\n\nThomas Wood – Am agent to Messrs. Pickford at Oxford; remember a parcel directed to Mr. Freeman coming to the office on the 21st of August; it was wrapped up with half-a-dozen knives and forks under the string; it had evidently been burst; Mr. Freeman came and examined the parcel and there was half-a-dozen short.\n\nGeorge Freeman – On the 21st of August last I was at Oxford; I had previously purchased some knives and forks of Mr. Twigg, of Sheffield; on that day, I went to Messrs. Pickford’s office, and found that half-a-dozen black handled knives and forks were missing from the parcel.\n\nWilliam Twigg – Am a manufacturer at Sheffield; remember receiving an order from George Freeman, for some black handled knives and forks; sent them, but had not sent any others of that class along that line of railway about that time; the knives produced are some of those I sent\n\nCross-examined – I make many thousand knives and forks of the class produced.\n\nMr. Brown then addressed the jury in behalf of the prisoner, contending that they were not justified in finding the prisoner guilty on the unsupported evidence of the policeman.\n\nNot Guilty.\n\nOxford Chronicle, 3 Jan 1852: another accident\n\nACCIDENT.- On Wednesday morning last there was a crash at the Winslow station, caused by the down coal train to Banbury stopping at the station to shunt some trucks to be left. While the men were so doing the goods train for Oxford came down the same line and went against that portion of the previous train that was standing on it. On observing that a collision was inevitable, the stoker and fireman jumped from the engine and escaped. The engine was thrown on its side across the line, the guard’s break was smashed, as were also several of the trucks, and the coal thrown about in all directions. The line was impassable during the day, traffic being carried on by shifting the luggage and passengers across the wreck. It appears the signal lights were burning at the end of the train when the approaching one ran into it; hence we should say there was great carelessness on the part of those having charge of one, if not of both the trains.\n\nBucks Advertiser and Aylesbury News, 24 April 1852: dismissals of staff\n\nThe London and North Western Railway Company have given two of the porters, the policeman, and the night watchman, at the Winslow station, notice that at the expiration of 14 days their services will not be longer required. No reason is assigned for this wholesale dismissal. It is understood that the vacancies caused by the notices will be forthwith filled up.\n\nThe station was some distance from the town centre, which was lamented in this poem:\n\nOxford Chronicle, 3 Nov 1855\n\nTHAT Winslow's a railway and station 'tis true,\n\nYet there's one thing makes travellers frown.\n\nWhen for \"Bussy\" they cry, it is found all my eye,\n\nTo take them to that quiet town.\n\nThen through rain, wind, and dirt, though they'd fain give their shirt\n\nFor a ride, as all well can tell,\n\nThey must trudge half a mile, with blue devils and bile,\n\nTo their quarters, the old-fashioned \"Bell.\"\n\nA barrow and boy, are all they employ,\n\nYour luggage to take from the station,\n\nWhile woman or man, do the best they can,\n\nAt this place, - the last place in the nation.\n\nThe position of the station led to Winslow's expansion northwards. The railway enabled local farmers to send milk and butter to London on a daily basis. Some of the most enthusiastic users of the railway were members of the Whaddon Chase Hunt. There were many \"hunting boxes\" in and around Winslow, houses where wealthy people, usually from London, could make overnight stays and keep their horses.\n\nAnthony Trollope, Can You Forgive Her? (1864/5), ch.17\n\nThe scene is a meet of the Roebury Hunt at the fictional village of Edgehill, Oxon.\n\n\"By George,\" said the literary gentleman, \"just down from London by the 8.30 from Euston Square, and got over here from Winslow in a trap, with two fellows I never saw in my life before. We came tandem in a fly, and did the nineteen miles in an hour.\"\n\nOxford Chronicle, 13 Sep 1856: Telegraph service\n\nELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.- The British and Submarine Electric Telegraph Company are about to establish an office in this place for the transmission of messages to and from London and Liverpool and the various other towns in England and on the Continent. The work is in progress, and it is expected will be in readiness for transacting business in the course of the present week.\n\nThe Electric Telegraph Company mainly built its lines along railways. It isn't clear how you sent a telegram from Winslow at this stage.

Lowndes, Esq.,(in the chair), Captain Fremantle, and Fleetwood Lowndes, Esq.\n\nOFFICE ROBBERY AT WINSLOW.- Levi Hamp, a boy of Winslow, was brought up in custody on remand from the previous Friday, charged with stealing a bag, value 2d, and 1s 6d in money, the property of Mr. Thomas Henry Marks, coal merchant, Winslow, on October 18. - SAMUEL WHITE said he resided at Winslow, and was foreman to Mr. Marks. On the 18th of October he left his office at the station about 5.30 all safe. There was money in a desk in the cash box in the office, and in a bag. About a quarter past six he returned to the office. When he went in he found the cash box moved from its proper place, and placed close to a window. On examination he found a window unfastened and partly open, and a bag containing about 1s worth of coppers and a few 3d pieces gone. He let things remain quiet till the morning and communicated with the police. A window was broken when he returned to the office, which was whole when he left. – EDMUND BUCKINGHAM, foreman to Mr. Clarke at the station brickyard, Winslow, sent his little boy for some beer while he waited at the coal wharf gates on the evening of the 18th, and whilst there noticed somebody moving in Mr. Marks’s office, who he thought was the foreman. Just after then some one ran past him. His little boy met the person and said “Holloa, Mike,” and the person replied “Holloa, Jack.” The witness would not swear that the prisoner was the person who passed him, but he was sure the one that passed him was the same as spoke to his boy.- JOHN BUCKINGHAM identified the prisoner as being the person who spoke to him on the evening of October 18, when he was returning with the beer to his father. – SERGT. CLARE [=Clear] apprehended the prisoner about three o’clock on the Saturday after the robbery and told him the charge. After he had been in the lock-up about two hours Hamp knocked at the door. On the witness going to him he said “Please will you let me see Mr. Marks, I want to beg his pardon, and ask him if he will forgive me, if I will pay for the window, and give him the money back. I only had 10d.” On the 21st he took him before Mr. Lowndes for the purpose of getting a remand. He (witness) stated the charge. The prisoner cried and said “I did do it.” – The prisoner now pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.- A time ago the prisoner was implicated with two others in breaking into a hen house, on which occasion he was admitted as Queen’s evidence, and the persons whom he gave evidence about were committed to gaol.\n\nYou can see a photo of Levi Hamp (aged 16) at Aylesbury Gaol in the Bucks Archives' Victorian Prisoners database.\n\nBucks Advertiser and Aylesbury News, 14 Dec 1872: Station Brickyard\n\nWINSLOW STATION BRICKYARD.\n\nTHE WHOLE OF THE STOCK-IN-TRADE,\n\nCONSISTING of 100 THOUSAND DRAIN PIPES, 100 THOUSAND BRICKS, a large quantity of Staffordshire Glazed Pipes, and other Materials; a capital BRICK and PIPE MACHINE, by Page; Pug Mill, 100 Dozen of Matting Bags for covering, and the necessary Machinery and Implements for carrying on a large business,\n\nWILL BE SOLD BY AUCTION, BY Mr. James King,\n\nOn TUESDAY, the 17th of DECEMBER, 1872, AT 11 O’CLOCK,\n\nBy direction of Mr. W.

He was proceeding in company with George Whichello, letter carrier, in the six foot way by the side of a passing goods train, when an engine and tender proceeding from Bletchley to Oxford at an express pace, came suddenly down upon them. Whichello at once lay flat down on the ground and escaped without injury, but Colton was caught by the engine and thrown with great violence against the goods train on the other line, his head being severely cut and receiving several severe bruises, but we are glad to learn that he is progressing favourably.\n\nBucks Herald, 11 Sep 1880: Emmanuel Carter's fatal accident\n\nFATAL ACCIDENT AT THE RAILWAY STATION.-\n\nOn August 28th last, an accident, which has unfortunately terminated fatally, happened to a porter named Emmanuel Carter, who for many years has been employed at Winslow Station. While engaged in connection with the shunting of some coal trucks, Carter was struck by one of them while in motion, and knocked down. Mr. Charles Clare, coal merchant, was standing close by, and at once snatched him off the rails, or he would otherwise have been run over. He was taken home, and although much bruised, it was at first hoped that his injuries were not of a very serious character. On medical aid being called in, however, it was found that his spine had received severe injury, and it was thought desirable to remove him to Oxford Infirmary, where, despite all that could be done for him, he expired on Friday, September 3rd. Deceased’s remains were brought home to Winslow, and were interred in the Parish Churchyard on the following Tuesday, being followed by the Rev. F. J. Feltham, pastor of the Baptist Tabernacle, at which place of worship deceased had been a prominent member ever since its erection, and also by several of his fellow employes on the railway.\n\nBuckingham Advertiser, 18 Sep 1880\n\nINQUEST.- On Saturday, September 4th, E. L. Hussey, Esq., held an inquest at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on the body of Emmanuel Carter, aged 60, a porter in the service of the London and North Western Railway, at Winslow.- The son, Emmanuel George Carter, a single man at Winslow, said the deceased had been in the service of the Company 30 years. On that day week he observed that he was in pain, and he had heard that he had met with an accident. He had no power in his legs, but he could move his arms, and he was brought to the Infirmary.- Charles Clare, coal merchant, of Winslow, said he was on the coal Wharf on Saturday close to the Station. The deceased was trying to couple two empty coal wagons together which had just been shunted on to the main line out of the coal siding, and before he had time to get out from between them he was knocked down, but the wheel of the wagon did not pass over him. Witness pulled him out from across the metal. He said “Oh dear,” and asked witness not to move his head, on which he could see two small wounds. Witness thought he was struck by the handle of the break, and did not think that he succeeded in coupling the wagons, as he had not time. The deceased went very quickly to the wagons, and witness thought he ought not to have gone in.- George Viccars, porter at the station, said he was engaged shunting the wagons on to the main line. Some of them were unhooked and he called the engine-driver back, and somebody, he did not know who, shouted “stop”. The driver reversed his engine and stopped instantly, and on looking round he (witness) saw Clare pull the deceased our from between the tucks. The deceased was used to the work of coupling.- John Angel, of Banbury, engine-driver, said he was shunting and the last witness called him back. The deceased was seven wagons from the engine, but he did not see him until he saw Clare pulling him out.- Mr. E. S. Vachell, the House Surgeon, said the deceased was admitted on Wednesday and he died on Friday. He had a fracture of the spine high up in the neck; he had some imperfect power in his arms, no more in his legs. He said it was a pure accident and no one could help it. He had a badly bruised and lacerated arm, one of the bones of the neck, and the spinal cord was torn, and death ensued from the injuries.- The jury returned a verdict of “Accidental death.”\n\nBuckingham Express, 21 Jan 1882\n\nFATAL ACCIDENT.- On Saturday morning, January 14th, a youth named Thomas James Neal, son of Mr. J. Neal, shoemaker, was unfortunately run over by a train, at Winslow station, where he was engaged folding and distributing newspapers [on behalf of his employer E.J. French], among others he had a parcel to send to Padbury, by the 8.45 Banbury train, and the train being on the move, he ran to put the parcel into the guard van, and in so doing came into collision with a man standing on the platform and stumbled, falling on to a milk tin and rolling on to the metals, when the wheels of the last carriage passed over both of his legs, he was at once picked up, and carried into the ‘Railway Inn,’ [i.e. Station Inn] and medical assistance was procured, but it was thought best to convey him to Oxford Infirmary, which was done by the next train. Very little hope was entertained of his recovery from the first, and he died on the following Tuesday, in the Infirmary. Deceased was extremely quiet and respectful lad, and much sorrow is felt in Winslow for his untimely end.\n\nBicester Herald, 27 Aug 1886\n\nWINSLOW TO LIVERPOOL.- 28 persons patronised the L. and N. W. Ry. excursion trip to Liverpool, on August 23. Arriving there at eleven in the morning, leaving at about 9.30 p.m., and reaching Winslow at about 3 a.m.\n\nBuckingham Advertiser, 27 Sep 1890\n\nWINSLOW. THE RAILWAY STATION.- A welcome improvement is being made at the L.& N.W.R. Station. There are at present only waiting rooms on the down platform, and as passengers from the Oxford line on to the Banbury line, or vice versa, as well as passengers to Bletchley, have often to wait on the up platform for some considerable time, waiting rooms there are much needed., and Mr. Brooks, the station master, has been trying for something like two years to get them. A ladies’ room and general waiting room are now being erected right and left of the platform, with doors and windows opening straight on to it, and will soon be completed.\n\nBuckingham Advertiser, 17 Jan 1891\n\nFurther alterations are being made at the Winslow passenger station, one of the chief of which is the transfer of the booking office to the opposite ticket office, and vice versa. By this new arrangement, the booking office will be greatly improved, both for light and accommodation, whilst the ticket office will be amply sufficient.\n\nBuckingham Express, 20 June 1891\n\nA FEW evenings back (writes our local correspondent) a spectacle occurred at Winslow Railway Station which, for the moment, filled every spectator with horror. A very large milk traffic is carried on from this station. Just as the 8.30 train to Banbury was coming in, a man named Walker, in the employ of Mr. Edwards, of The Creamery, was pushing a trolley loaded with milk across the line, when he was caught by the buffer of the engine, thrown between the metals, and the engine and about half the train passed over him. The driver, seeing what had happened, pulled up as quickly as possible and jumped off his engine, expecting to find the man a mangled corpse; but strange to say, Walker emerged comparatively unhurt, having been knocked down in a hollow place between the sleepers. It is stated that had the affair happened on any other evening he would certainly have lost his life, as the engine which usually runs the train, having been temporarily disabled, was replaced on this evening by one with a fire-box higher from the ground.\n\nBuckingham Advertiser, 1 Oct 1892\n\nThe New Railway to the North.\n\nThis refers to what became the Grand Central Railway, now forming part of the route for HS2.\n\nA town meeting was held at Winslow on Wednesday evening last, in the Infant School, in order to promote a petition to the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway Company that their new line to Leicester, Nottingham and the North, instead of branching off at Quainton Road, and thence by Hillesden and Finmere to Brackley, might keep to the present route of the Metropolitan Railway past Grandborough Road, Winslow Road, and Verney Junction to Buckingham and Brackley. There was a good representative attendance, including - Mr. Geo. R. Greaves (who occupied the chair), Mr. T. P. Willis, Mr. F. Brazier (Grandborough), Mr. W. H. Hinton (East Claydon), Rev. P. H. Eliot, Mr. T. F. Vaisey, Messrs. Varney, Pass, Illing, Dunkley, Clear, G. King, F. Dancer, Whichello, East, Corkett, Elley, Saunders, Ash, Stonell, Fregard, Hawley, Neal, Warne, G. T. King, Lorkin, Russell, Clare, Burdon, Kennings, &c.\n\nThe chairman, in opening the meeting [outlined their proposal] … Another line would be certain to lower the rates that existed, and if not much better for passengers it would certainly be so for goods traffic, so that it would be worth their while to try and get the Companies to alter their present scheme, and this would save cutting up the ground afresh by railways in their locality, which would be something to hunting-men like himself. He then referred to the meeting at Buckingham for the same object, and said that Buckingham people were anxious for them to join in the matter …\n\nMr. H. Brazier commented upon the enormous rates now being paid. He said a load of cows to London cost 5/- a head, and a packed carcase cost 26/- or 27/-. Carcasses came all the way from America quite as cheap or even cheaper …\n\nThe Chairman then proposed that Winslow should co-operate with Buckingham in the matter.\n\nThis was carried unanimously, and the following gentlemen were chosen as a Committee to carry it out.- Mr. H. R. Lambton, Mr. G. R. Greaves, Mr. H. J. Chinnery, Mr. T. P. Willis, Mr. Geo. D. E. Wigley, Mr. H. Brazier, Mr. H. Fregard, Mr. W. S. Neal, Mr. J. Hawley, Mr. J. East, Mr. A. Monk, Mr. W. H. Hinton.\n\nThe meeting concluded with a vote of thanks to the Chairman - Proposed by Mr. Fregard, and seconded by Mr. Brazier.\n\nBuckingham Advertiser, 28 Jan 1893\n\nThe Railway Rates and Charges. MEETING AT WINSLOW.\n\nA large meeting of Winslow townsmen was held on Friday evening, at the Bell Room to protest against the imposition of increased rates for the carriage of goods by the London and North-Western Railway Company. Mr. T. P. Willis presided, supported by Mr. J. C. Hawley, Mr. W. S. Neal, Mr. E. A. Illing, Mr. H. Bullock, Mr. H. Freegard, Mr. E. Parrett, and Mr. A. G. Stevens, and among others present were- Messrs. Wise, J. Walker, R. Walker, Langley, E. Egleton, Fulks, &c., &c.\n\nThe Chairman in an earnest speech, impressed upon those present the gravity of the situation, not only in Winslow, but all through the country, for the Companies, at a time like this, to increase their rates beyond all reason and all bounds, how it was that Sir Courtney Boyle and the other gentlemen could not see it was a minimum rate, and not a maximum that was required, he could not make out. As Englishmen he urged them to start up and protest against it, and if that failed, to combine and get their goods by some other way- by the Metropolitan line, or by travelling from Aylesbury.\n\n[Mr. W.S. Neal (wine merchant etc.), Mr. E. A. Illing (grocer), who cited Mr. Hurlstone (ironmonger), Mr. A. G. Stevens (draper), Mr. Wise (stone mason), and Mr. J. Walker (fruiterer, etc.), all described personal experiences, with examples, of how the effect the increase of carriage rates had affected them.]…\n\nThe following resolution, drafted by the Chairman, was proposed by Mr. J. C. Hawley, and seconded by Mr. Warne:-\n\n“That this meeting most strongly protests against the imposition of increased rates of railway carriage by this Company, as being entirely opposed to what was generally understood to be the intention of recent legislation, and the enquiry held in consequence by the Board of Trade, and that, in the opinion of this meeting, such increase is calculated to intensify the existing depression in trade throughout the country. This meeting is also of opinion that Winslow should be treated as the 50 mile rate, being within that radius at Winslow Road Station on the Metropolitan Railway.”\n\nThis resolution was thoroughly discussed, a most earnest spirit prevailing the meeting; it was felt very keenly that Winslow being, by the London and North-Western Railway reckoning, four miles over the 50 miles from London, was charged on the 100 mile scale, while adjoining towns like Fenny Stratford, Leighton and Aylesbury were just within the 50 miles, and had the advantage of water carriage, this, as well as the fact that Winslow Road Station (Metropolitan ) was within the 50 miles, was most earnestly insisted upon by several of the speakers, it being apparent that if the Metropolitan company would only make the necessary arrangements at Winslow, some enterprising individuals would soon see about the requisite conveyances to and from that station, which is only 11/2 miles distant. Indeed one speaker went so far as to talk about fetching goods from Aylesbury, 10 miles distant. Whilst the Chairman threw out a very significant suggestion that the company might find their assessment increased from £350 to £550 per mile if they persisted in the line they had taken up…\n\nThe meeting did not stop here either, for while recognising the fact that the officials of the L.& N.W. Company at Winslow station did their best, it was pointed out that the siding accommodation was so badly arranged that often hours were spent waiting for non-delivered articles, such as feeding stuffs and other heavy goods, because they were tucked away in some sidings, and could not be got at till the passenger trains were out of the way; and a speaker said that while the traffic must be three times what it used to be, the Company were new, and had been for some years, employing less hands to deal with it; and as the Chairman noted, not only was there the waste of time with men while waiting for goods, but also those who had valuable shire horses- as many of the agriculturalists in the neighbourhood had- did not care for them to be standing amongst the puffing and blowing off of the engines any longer than could be helped.\n\nA resolution, proposed by Mr. Hillyer, and seconded by Mr. W. S. Neal, was then discussed, and adopted as follows:-\n\n“This meeting is also of the opinion that better accommodation should be given to the consignees of goods, especially the non-carted traffic at Winslow station, than at the present time, so that consignees should not be kept waiting when they send for their goods as at present.”\n\nA vote of thanks to the Chairman concluded the meeting.\n\nWinslow Station and sidings, 1907.

The old bridge looked as if it might stand another fifty years, but then appearances are deceitful.\n\nBucks Herald, Saturday 1 Aug 1896\n\nThe Verney Arms at Verney Junction Opens\n\nBusiness was commenced at the new hotel at Verney Junction on Monday. It is notorious that for many years the accommodation at this junction has been totally inadequate to the demands which has been placed on it by the increasing number of trains and traffic … It was generally felt that accommodation of other kinds, especially for horses and traps, was also urgently needed, and it is with a view to meet this demand that Messrs. Frank Higgens and Co. of Buckingham have erected the new hotel, which undoubtedly will prove of great convenience to the public. It is situate about twenty-five yards from the new station gates, and is on the angle of the Winslow and Claydon road, south of the station. It faces the latter, and in front stands a fine ash tree surrounded with an oval of grass round which runs the carriage drive. It has two bays, is built of Hartwell red bricks with stone sills, and slated with chimneys of blue brick ornamental heads. … The work has been satisfactorily executed by Messrs. Matthew Bros. of Winslow, in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by Mr Philip Inns of Stowe, who has personally superintended the work.\n\nBucks Herald, 30 Sep 1899: Complaints from Winslow RDC\n\nTHE RAILWAY ACCOMMODATION AT WINSLOW STATION.- The following memorial to the London and North-Western Railway Company was unanimously adopted:- “The Winslow Rural District Council desires especially to represent to the London and North-Western Railway Company the great necessity for some accommodation for the safer and more convenient loading and unloading of goods at the Company’s Station at Winslow. The present arrangements are very unsatisfactory, the men and horses having to cross and stand upon some part of the line while loading or unloading, which is difficult and unsafe, especially with young horses. As it is, often men cannot proceed with their work because of the shunting of engines and trucks upon the same line of metals from which they have to unload; this causes great inconvenience and hindrance, sometimes to the extent of two hours. The Council would respectfully suggest that if the Company could see its way to make some improvement it might easily and a very moderate outlay be done by making a side line on the left as you enter the gate by the goods shed connected with the line, from the corner of the embankment below (as shown upon the accompanying sketch). This would greatly facilitate the work of and be a convenience to those of the district who do business with the Company, and the Council think it would well repay the Company for the comparatively small expense it would entail…”\n\nAnother trade which was made possible by the railway was in blackberries.\n\nBuckingham Advertiser, 20 Dec 1884\n\nBLACKBERRYING.- It will surprise many of our readers to learn the quantity of this fruit from the hedge-rows in and around Winslow, sent from this station from September 18 to October 28, by Mr. B. Walker, and Mr. J. Walker. The latter sent from Winslow station 7 tons 3 cwt., 2 qrs., and 8 lbs., and paid carriage to the amount of £6 16s 9d. – Mr. B. Walker sent 3 tons 19 cwt. 3 qrs. and 20 lbs., and paid carriage amounting to £1 19 4d. The total weight sent by the two was 11 tons 3 cwt. 2 qrs., and the carriage £11 16s 1d. A good price was paid to the gatherers who must have benefitted thereby.\n\nBucks Herald, 7 Oct 1900\n\nAn interesting scene may be witnessed at Winslow passenger station almost daily again this year, in the shape of the dispatch of heaps of small baskets containing blackberries. One day this week I counted 300 baskets containing 61 lbs, 50 baskets of 10 lbs, and 200 baskets of 12 lbs. No less than 2,000 baskets were sent away this week to all parts of England. They are gathered from the wild brambles in the hedgerows by the women of the villages and taken to Mr John Walker, fruiterer, Winslow, who gives about 1d per lb, depending on the ripeness of the fruit. It is somewhat singular that the Transvaal crisis [i.e. the Boer War] should affect a little trade like this, but I understand it is a fact. Mr Walker having annually sent some hundreds of baskets to Johannesburg, till this year. The greater part of the fruit is now despatched to the North via Bletchley.\n\nBucks Advertiser and Aylesbury News, 27 Oct 1906\n\nThis year being a good blackberry one, numbers of people about Winslow have scoured the country round for miles gathering them. Dealers have also gone round and bought up the fruit and sent it wholesale to London, where we learn it is used for dying purposes. At the Railway Station at Winslow of late quantities of empty baskets were to be seen tied together, and within the station precincts, the blackberry stain was a feature to be seen. The sum of 1s. 4d. a peck is said to have been the price given to the collectors of berries.\n\nThe blackberry trade flourished for several decades until the First World War.\n\nIn 1903 Mr Walker sent 5-6 tons per week from the station, and other dealers were involved too (Northampton Mercury, 30 Oct).\n\nIn 1913 32½ tons were sent from Winslow Road Station in addition to what went by the LNWR (Luton Times, 28 Nov).\n\nThe Station seen from the air, 1931\n\nSource: www.britainfromabove.org.uk/image/epw036312\n\nBuckingham Advertiser, 1 Nov 1902: another fatal accident\n\nOn Friday an inquest was held at the Bugle Inn Great Horwood by Mr. T. F. Vaisey, on the body of James Mallett, aged 31, who died from the effects of injuries received at Winslow Station on the 22nd inst. Mr. Joseph Hanson was foreman of the jury. The following evidence was taken:-\n\nWilliam Foskett, porter at the London and North-Western Station, Winslow, said on the 29th September the deceased was loading [oil] cake at the station and witness was helping him. The shafts broke and the fore part of the cart dropped forward. Deceased got up and shifted the cake to the back of the cart to unload it, when the cake tilted up and wedged him between the cake and the wagon. Witness lifted the deceased out and pulled the cake off him. Deceased complained of his back and legs very much. Deceased left the cart and fetched another and tied the broken cart on behind and went home with it. Deceased had complained several times since of pain in his back, and said it was caused by the accident entirely. Deceased was not in the cart when the accident first happened. They were 2cwt. bags of oil cake and two or three of these bags fell on deceased’s stomach.\n\nIn 1947 there were 9 trains a day from Winslow to Bletchley, and you could get to Euston in 90 minutes if you travelled at the right time:\n\nWinslow signal box, photographed in 1959\n\nOxford to Winslow return for 5s 6d (1956), from British Railways\n\nIn 1958, cheap Saturday trips to Bedford were on offer\n\nSimilar deals were available in 1965\n\nSome of the tickets issued on the last day of passenger services\n\nThe last passenger train ran on 30 Dec 1967: it was the 23:45 to Bletchley. You can hear some extracts from a recording made that day.\n\nThe first part of the recording is the last minutes of the signal box: signals are pulled off for a fast train to Oxford, then a train for Bletchley comes through, bells clang and the needles are switched off. The second part is the last train, the 23:45 for Bletchley, stopping at the station, with some detonators going off behind it.\n\nThe line was used for goods trains and occasional passenger specials until the early 1990s.\n\nA Milton Keynes Shopper train stops at Winslow, c.1987\n\nAn Amey Roadstone train on the now single-track line passes under the Iron Bridge between Furze Lane and Buckingham Road, c.1988\n\nSee also:\n\nStation Road\n\nWinslow Station on the Disused Stations website\n\nWinslow railway station on Wikipedia\n\nTimetable World (old railway timetables)\n\nWinslow Road Station\n\nWinslow's second station, Winslow Road, between Winslow and East Claydon, was opened in 1868 on the Aylesbury & Buckingham Railway (part of the Metropolitan Railway from 1891). The proposed line was first discussed in 1853:\n\n1853, Bucks Chronicle, 26 Nov\n\nTHE PROJECTED RAILWAY\n\nOur readers are aware that a direct line, on the narrow gauge, from Oxford to London, through Wycombe, with a branch by Risborough to Aylesbury, and powers for one to Amersham, will be promoted this Session by the London and North Western, the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton Companies, and most of the influential Landowners, who last year formed part of the Board of the Mid-Western scheme. The cordial alliance with the North Western Company, has thus secured to this line the use of the Euston-square terminus, with its enormous contingent advantages. Though not included in the scheme of this session, it is evident that the line must eventually be extended from Aylesbury to Winslow.\n\n1868, Oxford Chronicle, 3 Oct\n\nNEW ROUTE TO AYLESBURY.- The new line of railway branching off from Winslow and running through the Vale of Aylesbury, was opened for traffic on Thursday last. The line is about 8 miles in length. Three trains in connection with the Buckinghamshire railway, run each way daily.\n\nA horse-drawn vehicle called the Fly Coach provided a connection from The Bell. There was a through service to London (Baker Street) from 1892. The line was a commercial failure and closed to passengers in 1936. Winslow Road Station had a footbridge, unlike Winslow Station where you had to walk across the tracks at a \"barrow crossing\". The first photo (looking north) shows the station before it was upgraded in the 1890s, and the second (looking south) is later.\n\n1895: Bucks Herald, 5 Oct\n\nTravellers by the Metropolitan Railway to Verney Junction will soon see a great change. At Winslow Road a commodious station, which will be quite equal to that on the L. and N. Western at Winslow, is in course of erection. At the junction itself I cannot hear of anything being as yet done to the Station, but the old Condensed Milk Factory is coming down, and is, I hear, to be replaced by a block of cottages. If this is correct, Verney Junction, with its hotel as well, will be quite a different spot.\n\nFor more information and photos, see the Disused Stations website.\n\nSome of the information on this page comes from C.G. Maggs, The Branch Lines of Buckinghamshire (Chalford: Amberley, 2010)."
