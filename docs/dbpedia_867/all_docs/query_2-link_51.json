Did you report the spitting incident to BTP? They could well end up in court on an assault charge.\n\nYou mean like those stations on the NLL or GOBLIN that have no ticket barriers? There is no guarantee if TfL take over barriers will be put in.\n\nNo guarantee at every station, but since TfL have taken over various lines they've installed barriers and staffing at the vast majority. Including many with far less passengers per annum than most stations on SE metro routes.\n\nThose stations on LO that havn't are either lightly used or are impractical, but with most stations covered there's a high chance that even if someone gets on without passing barriers, they can't get off. Not so with 90% un-barriered on SE. If they deemed 600k users not enough at Slade Green (and that is an underestimate with avoidance so easy) then most others would very likely be covered with more than 1m per year.\n\nAnti social behavior is not uncommon in that area, I'm surprised they were compliant with ticket inspectors. Did you report the spitting incident to BTP? They could well end up in court on an assault charge.\n\nUnfortunately the friendly local youths were outside the station property at the time, I didn't actually realise they intended on travelling - so I didn't report anything. and often that's exactly what they want you to do is provoke them which is why I just ignored their stupidity and got on the train.\n\nI thought I would post this rather amusing story that happened this evening...\n\nThat made my day\n\nBlakey\n\nOf course no-one should have to put up with such behaviour; but may I congratulate you on the way you have dealt with it.\n\n......TfL have recently taken over........ If (hopefully when) they take over SE metro then I would expect the same to apply.\n\nDo you really think that South Eastern suburban network needs the added burden of carrying Elderly etc. passengers, for free, in the peaks? If they could be accommodated without consequences that might be all fine and dandy, but I can only see more standing passengers being the result. There is little or no scope for more trains to be run.\n\nNo guarantee at every station, but since TfL have taken over various lines they've installed barriers and staffing at the vast majority.

It was originally conceived as a mostly-segregated tramway. When automatic trains became the favoured option (cheaper than drivers) the northern branch was rerouted from terminating on-street at Mile End to run fully segregated to Stratford.\n\nAs for yobs, much of the area the DLR serves has undergone massive gentrification, but even those areas that haven't tend not to see too many yobs on the train. I can only assume this is due to the member of staff on board who can devote their attention to removing them if necessary.\n\n--- old post above --- --- new post below ---\n\nDo you really think that South Eastern suburban network needs the added burden of carrying Elderly etc. passengers, for free, in the peaks? If they could be accommodated without consequences that might be all fine and dandy, but I can only see more standing passengers being the result. There is little or no scope for more trains to be run.\n\nEven if the free travel in the peaks is extended to the SE metro, I doubt that a significant number of people will make use of it simply because the trains are so full already. The biggest benefits of TfL will be fare harmonisation (it shouldn't cost more to travel from Woolwich to Greenwich direct than via Poplar and Canary Wharf for example), an operator who actually cares about providing a metro service and some actual effort at minor stations. Southeastern projects a distinct \"couldn't give a damn\" atmosphere onto their metro routes.\n\nThey should never have been able to get on a train in the first place, where they were probably hassling more people.

And it isn't confined to just SE metro lines - it occurs all over the country.\n\nIAs for yobs, much of the area the DLR serves has undergone massive gentrification, but even those areas that haven't tend not to see too many yobs on the train. I can only assume this is due to the member of staff on board who can devote their attention to removing them if necessary.\n\nNot wholly true - it is still a massive issue especially on the southern and eastern to WOA routes.\n\nI wonder then how TfL manages to operate the DLR with no station staff, no barriers, and in my experience a pretty complete freedom from yobs.\n\nA member of staff walking through each train, and FAR more regular patrols of RPIs.\n\n--- old post above --- --- new post below ---\n\nIt isn't a fact. Southeastern are required to staff 40 gatelines and according to Wiki call at 179 stations. That would make at least 22% of stations gated on SE. A further 2 stations are required to be gated during the Direct Award period.\n\nLike Abbey Wood, mentioned in the first post, that is technically gated but has a side entrance open and unmanned all day, every day?\n\nThere's very few that are manned all day - London terminals mainly and stations like Lewisham and Dartford, though even then often only until 8pm.\n\n--- old post above --- --- new post below ---\n\nReally ? Wow that is an interesting fact. Can you back that up with evidence ?\n\nDaily use for 20 years, with work taking me to various stations 5 days a week? Plus, staff I know back it up regarding evasion levels. Maybe some on here could comment?\n\nIf we take the line mentioned - from Cannon Street to Dartford you would have only 2 stations manned all day - those being Cannon Street and London Bridge. The other 13 wouldn't. Woolwich Arsenal & Dartford until 8pm perhaps but not all day. If talking of the route to Medway it'd be around another 6+ that are open part, or all day.\n\n--- old post above --- --- new post below ---\n\nI see this line line is blocked right now due to disruptive passengers at Charlton. Emergency services en route.\n\nThere are push-bar exit gates which can only be opened from the platform side. Although they are supposed to be for emergency use only, I regularly saw people use them as a normal exit and no-one took any notice of the alarm.\n\nThen folk will wait by these for someone to come out and sneak in, as they seem to do happily and without enforcement all the time on the Paris Metro - even on the main Gare du Nord concourse. Annulling the whole point.\n\nI would strongly favour manning any closed barrier system full time, given how often I have seen and experienced problems at these requiring manual intervention.\n\nIf one reported every act of anti-social behaviour to the police then one would be spending an awful amount of one's week so doing. This applies probably in most urban environments now, not just in my old stamping ground of S.E. London. Two days ago in my adopted home town of Penzance I was issued with a threat of death from a choice individual in combat jacket with an alsatian by his side as he deliberately barged into me in the street. I chose not to attempt to take it any further, being about thirty years older than him and knowing it would not end satisfactorily from my point of view. Yes, I am frustrated, even angry, at this state of affairs but it is the reality of where we are as a society.\n\nWhy can't people just be honest and buy a ticket.\n\na) they think the service is rubbish, so why bother paying for a ticket\n\nb) they cannot afford a ticket but still want to travel\n\nc) they want to buy a ticket but cannot\n\nd) they have seen that they can get away with it so have stopped\n\ne) their friends/colleagues/school classmates do it too so they will do it too\n\n...this could go all the way to z) I think!"
