The social life of the period is recorded principally in the few private letters which have survived a century. To this scanty fund of information it is to be hoped that the diary of Mrs. John Graves Simcoe, the wife of the first Governor, will make an interesting addition. This record is the simple recital of her daily life in the pioneer days when Niagara was the centre of military, civil and social life in the new province, and York, the future capital, could scarcely count a score of habitable dwellings outside the primitive barracks that the Governor had erected within the few acres of ground where still stands the Fort — the Old Fort — as it is familiarly called in these modern days. Yes, when Navy Hall, on the banks of the Niagara River, was the first Government house of the province and an attractive home, full of welcome for visitors, official and unofficial. The original manuscript of the diary, of which this volume embodies the only copy, has been carefully transcribed by the kind permission of Mrs. Simcoe, of Wolford, the Simcoe estate, near the old town of Honiton in Devon, so well known to womankind for its manufacture of exquisite lace. Mrs. Simcoe is the present lady of the manor, and widow of the late Captain John Kennaway Simcoe, R.N., Justice of the Peace for the County of Devon. He was the only son of the late Rev. Henry Addington Simcoe (1800-1868) of Penheale in Cornwall, who was the third son of General Simcoe. Captain Simcoe died at Wblford in March, 1891. As a general rule entries were made in this record day by day and the writings mailed every week to Mrs. Hunt, a lady who had undertaken the charge of Mrs. Simcoe's four daughters, Eliza, Charlotte, Henrietta, and Caroline, all under seven years of age, who remained at Wolford. Sophia, born in 1789, and Francis Gwillim, born in 1791, accompanied the Governor and his wife to Canada. The diary was commenced on the 17th September, 1791, nine days prior to Mrs. Simcoe's departure from Weymouth for Quebec, on the \"Triton,\" man-of-war. The last entries are on the 16th October, 1796, when Governor Simcoe and his wife again arrived in London. My annotations, instead of being arranged and placed in the .conventional form as footnotes, are incorporated with the text of the diary following the entries to which they belong. The notes are so voluminous that, if given at the foot of each page, they would be pages in advance of the text. The reader will, therefore, have PREFACE the advantage of reading first the text and then the note which accompanies it. The few brief notes that appear in parenthesis throughout the actual text are principally from memoranda made by Mrs. Simcoe in connection with the small maps that form part of the diary. The illustrations, except where otherwise stated, are reproductions of water-colors, pen sketches and pencil drawings made by Mrs. Simcoe on her outward-bound voyage, and during her residence in Canada and after her return in 1796 to her old home in Devon. The originals of these drawings are nearly all at Wolford. But thirty-two, in sepia, are in a portfolio in the Royal Library in the British Museum. This library was given by George II. to the Museum, and with the gift the Royal privilege of receiving gratui- tously a copy of every book copyrighted in the British dominions passed to the Museum. After his return to England, Governor Simcoe presented these drawings to His Majesty King George III. Some of them are copies of sketches made by Lieutenant Robert Pilldngton (afterwards Major-General ), one of the staff, while on various excur- sions with the Governor. The inscription on the title page of the portfolio which contains these pictures reads: \"Thirty-two views in Upper Canada by Mrs. Simcoe, presented to His Majesty by Governor Simcoe, with a sketch of Upper Canada, drawn on bark.\" These have been carefully reproduced. Other water-colors of the collection which have so faded that they could not be satisfactorily reproduced have been redrawn, while the original pen-and-ink sketches and pencil drawings are in facsimile. Notwithstanding its excellence, the value of the art work of Mrs. Simcoe lies not so much in its merit as an exemplification of good color and pencil work, but in the fact that it gives to present readers of Canadian history faithful pictures of places and scenes in Upper and Lower Canada from 1791-6, which we would have lost absolutely had it not been for the gifted hand of the wife of the first Governor. \"Were it not for her work, we would not have views of Toronto Harbor at the end of the eighteenth century. We would not be able to contrast the quiet of the harbor and its surroundings in 1793, when it was the home of the aborigine and the haunt of the wild fowl, with the commercial activities of to-day. We would not have a picture of the Mohawk Village on the Grand River near Brantford, which, with the exception of the Mohawk Church, has passed away ; nor of the early days of the Niagara and Kingston settlements that were then and are now important places in the history of the Province of Upper Canada. Her sketches of places on the route from Quebec to York, in and about Niagara, and her copies of Lieutenant Pilkington's sketches in the Georgian Bay district, must also add much to the interest of the reader. One of Mrs. Simcoe's best efforts is a large water-color of the Falls of Niagara, made during her many visits to this favored spot. It adorns the walls of Wolford. x PKEFACE To the diary I have appended the journal of John Bailey, who for over thirty-seven years was in the service of the Simcoe family at Wolford. He entered the Simcoe household in the autumn of 1802, when a lad twelve years of age, and after the death of General Simcoe in 1806 he continued in the service of Mrs. Simcoe for about two years. He then went to sea for a short time, but once more wore the Simcoe livery from 1818 to 1850, when his mistress died. In her travels in different parts of England and Wales never once did she neglect to have Bailey look after all arrangements for her comfort, and act when desired as her coachman. His opinions, his reverence for Mrs. Simcoe, his devotion to the family, mark him as a man of more than ordinary intelligence. It is most refreshing to read his narrative. The writing of the biography of Mrs. Simcoe entailed much research. Every facility was courteously afforded me by Mrs. John Kennaway Simcoe. I can never sufficiently thank her for her unwearying efforts to help me in my quest concerning not only the life of Mrs. Simcoe, but also that of General Simcoe, whose biography will appear in another volume. Nothing has ever been published concerning the esteemed and talented wife of the first Governor of Upper Canada. In presenting this record of her life my hope is that it not only may be read with pleasure, but also find a place on the bookshelf of all who take in- terest in the pioneer days of the province that started its pace in the making of history one hundred and twenty years ago.

The personal character of Mrs. John Graves Simcoe, the wife of the first Governor of Upper Canada, may be written in a few brief sentences. The records that have been handed down to us from her own pen and from the pen of others who were contem- porary with her, all testify to her worth as woman, wife and mother. Mrs. Simcoe had not all the advantages that in natural course come to a daughter in girlhood days. She never saw her father, and in \"OLD COURT/' NEAR Ross, HEREFORDSHIRE. (From a Dramng in the J. Rogg Robertson collection.) the first twenty-four hours of her life she lost her mother. Bereft of those she would have loved, it fell to other than the gentle hands of father and mother to care for her as she grew to girlhood. Elizabeth Posthuma Gwillim was born in 1766 at Whitchurch, in Herefordshire, at the mansion known as \"Old Court\" near the town of Ross, the home of her mother, Elizabeth Spinckes, widow of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Gwillim. Her father died seven months 1 1 DIARY OF MBS. SIMCOE before she was born, while her mother died a few hours after giving birth to this daughter — her only child. She was named Elizabeth after her mother and Posthuma to commemorate the circumstances of her birth. Her father was an officer in the army, attaining the rank of colonel a few years before his death. He served in Canada and was one of the three Majors of Brigade of General Wolfe at Quebec in 1759, and died in 1766 while his regiment was stationed at Gibraltar. The marble bust of General Wolfe, now in the saloon at Wolford, was presented to Colonel Gwillim by the General, and a plaster bust of Colonel Gwillim from which the picture is taken is in the drawing-room of the old mansion. On the death of her mother and father the infant Elizabeth inherited \" Old Court\" and all that it contained. Mrs. Simcoe's mother was a daughter and co-heir of Elmes Spinckes, Esq., of Aldwinkle in North North- amptonshire, who died there in 1762. She suc- ceeded to the fortune left by her mother and grandmother, both of whom were heiresses in their own right. \"The old Church of Whitchurch on the Wye\" was erected some hundreds of years ago, and was COLONEL GWILLIM. the church which the Gwillim family attended from the time of its erection. The registers show baptisms in connection with the family as early as 1754 and burials from 1766. The family tomb of the Gwillims is in the churchyard. In alter years Mrs. Simcoe often visited Whitchurch and made sketches of spots so well known to her mother. Amongst them was the old church. The Gwillims came of noble lineage. Among the Archives at Wolford is an elaborate pedigree of the family, which is a very ancient one, the genealogy being traceable in a straight line from the early kings of North and South Wales. To this family belonged the celebrated Herald Gwillim, Rouge Croix Pursuivant-at-arms, 1618. Several pedigrees of the family have been drawn from time to time at the different visitations or investigations by a high heraldic officer whose duty is to examine into the pedigrees and inter-marriages of a family or the families of a district, with the view of ascertaining whether the arms borne by any person or persons living in that district are incorrect or unwarrantably assumed. Of the later ones entered at the College of Arms, one was drawn in 1569, another in 1683, and another was drawn for the subject of this biography by Francis Townsend, Windsor Herald, in 1806. It is a most elaborate document, being eighteen feet in length and forty-eight inches wide, and contains about four hundred quarterings of arms in colors, the work of a skilled artist, and forty-four feet of illuminated border. The penwork in which the names are written gives the document rank as an example of the best in heraldic art, and is said to have cost £300. 2 THE FAMILY OF GWILLIM The Gwillims on the paternal side were originally from Brecon- shire, having been Lords of Brecon before the Conquest. At a somewhat later date their ancestral home was at Brayne Court, Herefordshire, where they were domiciled before the fifteenth cen- tury and again early in the sixteenth century at Fawley Court, Langstone Court and Whitchurch Court, and later at the Hunt House, Clodock, all in the county of Hereford. They married into many notable families and possessed at different periods vast landed estates, principally in the counties of Brecon, Hereford and Mon- mouth. THE OLD CHURCH OF WHITCHURCH, 1792. (From a Drawing by Mrs. Simeoe in the J. Ross Robertson collection.) During the troublous times of the Conquest, and for some centuries after, the Gwillims were actively engaged in warfare, some- times holding their commissions from the Welsh princes and some- times from the English kings. At the Wigga, Rowleston, Hereford- shire, there are papers relating to farms that had been given to Gwillims more than eight hundred years ago for their services in the army. The history of the family entwines with the well-known and historical Herbert family, of which the Gwillims are a branch, both paternally and maternally. William, eldest son of Howel-ap- Thomas, Lord of Perthhir, was the first of the family to adopt a 3 DIARY OF MRS. SIMCOE surname, in conformity with the English law, and the first pat- ronymic of Ap-Howel became corrupted with Powell. Gwillim Dhu (William Herbert), Earl of Pembroke (beheaded at Banbury in 1469), was commanded by the King, Edward IV., to take the surname of \"Herbert\" in memory of his illustrious ancestor Henry Fitz Herbert, Chamberlain to King Henry I. The Gwillims seem to have adopted \"Gwillim\" as a surname about the same timo, one Robert tjrwillim, son of Gwillim ap Thomas and Margaret, daughter and heir -of Sir James Abrahall, Knt. of Ingestone, 'County Hereford, being according to Francis Townsend, Windsor Herald in 1806, the first to do so. Prior to the edict of Edward IV. it had always been \"the Welsh custom to change the surname at every descent.\" Hence the Welsh were always most careful to preserve authentic evidence of their family records. The writings on this interesting document have been summarized from its beginning. It will be noted that the name of Gwillim first appears about the time of Edward IV. This summary shows an unbroken line back to Wil- liam I., of England, commonly called the Conqueror, and also to the ancient kings of Xorth and South Wales. The arms granted to the Gwillim family are here given: — Argent a lion rampant Ermines, collared Or. Crest — A dexter arm embowed in armour proper grasping a broken sword argent. The introductory paragraph or preamble as written by the Windsor Herald reads : — GWILLIM. \"The Genealogy of the ancient family of Gwillim deduced to Mrs. Elizabeth P. Simcoe, wife of Lieut.-General John Graves Simcoe. Tracing her descent paternally from the ancient British Lords of Brecon — from Henry Fitz Herbert, who was Chamberlain to King Henry the First and from King William the Conqueror; and paternally and maternally through Sir Giles de Brewes — or De Braisosa, Lord of Buckingham in the time of King- Edward the First, from William de Braisosa, one of the Conqueror's companions — whose posterity were Lords of Brembre, Brecon, and Gower and from the ancient Earls of Clare, Gloucester, Pembroke, Hereford and Derby and other of the most noble and illustrious families of England and Wales, compiled from public records and other authentic evidences by me, Francis ; Town- send, Windsor Herald, MDCCCVI.\" Then follows the line of descent : — Gundreda, daughter of William the Conqueror, married William, Earl of Warren and Surrey. She died in 1085 and was followed 4 ABMS OF GWILLIM. THE FAMILY OF GWILLIM in 1088 by her husband, who, the records show, was buried in Lewis Priory. The line is continued through Maynarch, Lord of Brecon, through whom also is traced the descent from the Welsh kings, he being the fourteenth in descent from Kariadoe Vrachfras and the daughter and heir of Pelinor, King of North Wales. Maynarch married Ellen, daughter of Eynon ap Selif, Lord of Cwminwd, and their second son was Blethyn ap Maynarch, Lord of Brecon, who married Elinor, daughter of Twdwr Mawr, King of South Wales, 1077 to 1091, and sister of Prince Rhys. In 1090 A.D., Blethyn was slain by Bernard Newmarch, who became Lord of Brecon. Blethyn's second son, Gwrgan ap Blethyn, appears in the records as Lord of Llangorse. Gwrgan ap Blethyn married Gwenllian, daughter and sole heir of Philip Gwy?, Lord of Wilton. Their second son, Traharne ap Gwrgan, was the next Lord of Llangorse and married Joan, daughter of Sir Aaron ap Bledry, Kn't. Howel ap Traharne succeeded his father and married Gwenllian, (laughter and heir of Griffith ap Eynon of Senighenith in County Glamorgan. During his lifetime he waged prolonged but unsuc- cessful wars against the Lord of Brecon in an attempt to win back the ancient seat of his family. At his death, Howell was succeeded by his son, Rees ap Howell, also known as Henry II L, of Aberllfni, who married Katherine, daughter of Griffith Gwyre. The line then comes through a cadet branch of the family, descended from Eynon Says ap Rees ap Howell, third son of Rees ap Howell, who succeeded to the family estate of Lywell, County of Brecon. The family burying-place was at Crych-Einon. The family arms are given as \"Argent, 3 cocks gules.\" Eynon Says ap Rees ap Howell married Joan, daughter and heir of Howell ap Meredith ap Cradock ap Justin, her mother being Ann, daughter of Gwilliin of Llewellyn-Lagar ap Ivor ap Einon. Their son was named Howell ap Eynon. Howell ap Eynon married Llelles Lettice, daughter and sole heir of Cadwallader ap Gruff ap Sitsile, Lord of Gwent, and had for heir Howell Vychan ap Howell, who took for his arms \"a fees between two arming swords.\" Howell Vychan married Ellen, daughter and heir of Llewellyn ap Howell-hen. Their third son, Llewellyn ap Howell Vychan, married Malltion, daughter and co-heir of Jevau ap Rees ap Jevan. The family arms were \"A lion rampant, sable armed, or.\" Thomas ap Lin ap Howell, eighth son of Llewellyn and Malltion, succeeded to the family arms, which are given during his generation as \"Argent, a lion rampant, sable armed, or.\" He married Mar- garet, daughter and co-heir of Philip ap Adam of Llanvair, Gelgedyn. 5 DIARY OF MRS. SIMCOE The name Gvvillim, which afterwards became the family name, first appears as the given name of the son of Thomas ap Lin and Margaret — Gwillim ap Thomas, who is the next in line and who married Margaret, daughter and heir of Sir John Ahrahall, Knight of Ingestone, Co. Hereford. ' Robert, son of Gwillim ap Thomas and Margaret, took his father's name as a surname and was known as Robert Gwillim of Treken- THE GWILLIM TOMB AT WHITCHURCH. (From a Drawing in the J.

All the information given as to his wife is that she was the \"Daughter of Egerton.\" Thomas Gvvillim succeeded his father Robert and is known in the records as Thomas Gvvillim of Llangonoke. His wife was the \"Daughter of Milbourne,\" and their sons were: (1) John Gwillim of Trerise, who died unmarried in 1600, and (2) William Gwillim, of Trekenkeved. SIMCOE-GWILLIM CONNECTION William Gwillim married Margery, daughter of Thomas Vaughan of Trevervyn, and the line to Mrs. Simcoe is continued through his third son, Thomas Gwillim, of Whitchurch. Thomas Gwillim married Barbara, daughter and co-heir of Walter Powell of Whitchurch, who was descended in a direct line from Robert Corbet, to whom King Henry I. gave the town of Alcester (\"In Com. Warn.\"). Corbet's daughter, Lucy, married Henry Fitz Herbert, the famous Chamberlain of King Henry I., and it was from this marriage that the family sprang of which Barbara Powell was a descendant. - Thomas Gwillim was succeeded in 1634 by his son Rudhall Gwillim, of AVhitchurch, who married Jane, daughter of Edmund Fox, of Leighton Court (\"aforesaid\"). They had two sons: (1) Thomas, who died unmarried, and (2) Eichard Gwillim. Richard Gwillim of Whitchurch, who succeeded to the estate in 1683 at the age of 54, married Margaret, daughter of Charles Price, of Llanfoist in the County of Monmouth. Then their son, Thomas Gwillim of Whitchurch Court, married Sophia, daughter of Selwyn of Matson, County of Gloucester. Thomas and Sophia had two sons, Selwyu who died unmarried, and Thomas Gwillim who succeeded his father and married Elizabeth, daughter and co-heir of Elmes Stuart of Cotterstock, High Sheriff of the County of Northampton. The children of Thomas Gwillim and Elizabeth Stuart were Jasper and Elmes, who died without issue, Henrietta Maria and Sophia, two daughters who died unmarried and were buried at Whitchurch, and Thomas Gwillim who succeeded to the estate. This Thomas Gwillim of Whitchurch Court was a lieutenant- colonel in the Army and died in 1766 and was buried in Gibraltar. His wife was Elizabeth, daughter and co-heir of Elmes Spinckes, who died at Aldwinkle, Sept. 22nd, 1762, and is buried there. Thomas and Elizabeth were cousins on the maternal side. Mrs. Gwillim died in 1766. The only child of this marriage was Elizabeth Posthuma, so culled because she was born subsequent to the death of her father. She married John Graves Simcoe of Wol- ford on December 30th, 1782, and died at Wolford, January 17th, 1850. The Simcoes were related to the Creed family of Northampton- shire, through the Gwillims. The connection is shown as follows: — Sir Edward Montague, Knt., created Earl of Sandwich, July 12th, 1661, and from present Earl, 1806. Nicholas Stuart of Pattishull, aforesaid, J. P. for County, living 1682, aged 57, married Susanna, daughter of Anthony Elmes and at length co-heir, living 1681. Sir Thomas Elmes, Knt. (bro. of Susanna) of Lilford, High Sheriff of said County, 1670, died without issue. 7 DIARY OF MRS. SIMCOE Sir Sydney Montague, Knt. Master of the Requests (living 1G18) married Paulina, daughter of John Pepys of Cottenham, Co. of Cambridge. Elizabeth,, daughter of Sir Sydney Montague, Knt., married Sir Gilbert Pickering of Tichmarsh, County of Northampton, Bart, of Nova Scotia. John Creed of Oundle, County Northampton, Gent., married Eliza- beth, daughter of Sir Gilbert Pickering, Bart, of Nova Scotia. Elizabeth, daughter of John Creed, Esquire, born 1672, married 1692, died 1742, buried at Whitchurch — married Elmes Stuart of Cotterstock, County Northampton, High Sheriff of said County, Ano. 12, Wm. III., aged 26 years, 1682, living 1710. Anne, daughter and co-heir, died unmarried and was buried at Whitclmrch. Jemima, daughter and co-heir of Elmes Stuart of Cotterstock, aforesaid, Esq., died at Aldwinkle, 26th May, 1763; married Elmes Spinckes, Esq., Lord of the Manor of Warrington, County Northamp- ton, died at Kidwarke. The issue of the marriage was a daughter who married Thomas Gwillim, the father of Mrs. John Graves Simcoe. This closes the summary. Thomas Gwillim, as before stated, died at Gibraltar in 1766, seven months before the birth of his daughter, and his widow died a few hours after the birth. The child thus born was named Elizabeth Posthuma. She married Lieutenant-Colonel John Graves Simcoe, who was born in 1752 at Cotter- stock in Northamptonshire, the ceremony being performed in SS. Mary and Giles, the Church of Buckerall parish in Devon in 1782. Colonel Simcoe, afterwards a general and the first Lieu- tenant-Governor of Upper Canada, died in 1806 in Exeter. Mrs. Simcoe, his widow, died in 1850. Both husband and wife are buried in the COLONEL GWILLIM. east end of the private chapel erected by the General on the estate of Wolf ord. General Simcoe was the only surviving son of Captain John Simcoe, R.N., of Cotter- stock, who married Catherine Stamford on 8th August, 1747. The marriage took place in Bath Abbey. At the time Captain Simcoe was in command of the \"Prince Edward.\" Afterwards he was pro- moted to H.M.S. \"Pembroke\" and died of pneumonia while his ship was off the island of Anticosti in the St. Lawrence River, on 15th May, 1759, four months before the capitulation of Quebec. The following is an extract from the Registers of the Abbey Church of SS. Peter and Paul, Bath, regarding the marriage of Cap- tain Simcoe: — \"1747, August 8th, — John Simcoe, Esqr., commander of His Majesties ship Prince Edward and Catherine Stamford, spinster, of Walcott, were married by License.\" EARLY HOME OF ELIZABETH GWILLIM Part of the city of Bath is now in the parish of Walcott, and although search has been made in the registers of the parish church, which date from 1694, no trace can be found of the name of Stamford. After the death of Mrs. Gwillim, the daughter was most tenderly cared for by her aunt, Mrs. Graves, a sister of her mother and wife of Samuel Graves of Hembury Fort, three miles from Wolford in Devon, who was Admiral of the White in 1717. There is a monu- ment in Buckerall parish church to the memory of Admiral Graves. To the west of Honiton one looks over a space of comparatively flat country, to the northwest overshadowed by St. Gyres Hill, and further north is the bold height of Dumpdon. On the top of this hill are the remains of an oval camp, and a few miles away the better known camp called Hembury Fort. The Fort stands very high and looks south to the sea beyond the vale of the river Otter, THE RESIDENCE KNOWN AS HEMBURY FORT. (From a Drat the J. Ross Robertson collection.) and west to Haldon and the fringes of Dartmoor over Exeter. Three ramparts surround the fort, which covers a large space of ground. It is oval in shape, divided into two parts by an earthwork and enclosed by a triple \"vallum\" or line of palisades. Several Roman coins and an iron \"lar\" in the form of a small female figure three inches high, representing a goddess who presided over the fortunes of the home, have been found there. Past Honiton ran the great Roman road of the Fosseway to Totnes, and according to some authori- ties, on into Cornwall. It is thought that the Romans, in making these famous roads, usually followed the line of the oldest British ways. Of Elizabeth Gwillim's very early youth little is known. Her aunt was most affectionate in disposition, a tender, kind and lovable woman, who in a thoroughly Christian spirit accepted the responsibilities 9 DIARY OF MES. SIMCOE of watching over her sister's child. This much may be gathered from the Graves' correspondence. The years were not slow in passing with Miss Gwillim. As a child she evinced a natural ability that surprised her governesses. She gathered knowledge as eagerly as she gathered the wild flowers by the roadside, of which she was so passionately fond. MRS. SIMCOE IN WELSH DRESS. (From, a Miniature at Wolford.) She loved to ramble through the woods, where she could repro- duce bits of landscapes that are still so charming all around Hem- bury Fort. Her delight as a girl was to be skilled in pencil, pen, and water-color work; and be it said that some of her water-colors that hang to-day on the walls at Wolford bear excellent evidence of 10 GIRLHOOD DAYS her artistic skill. It was readily admitted by all who met her at Hem- bury Fort that Mrs. Graves had in her niece Elizabeth an accom- plished relative. As a linguist Miss Gwillim was an apt pupil. She spoke German and French fluently and ventured occasionally to converse in Spanish when opportunity offered. To a letter from Miss Burgess, a friend at Tracey, near Honiton, Devonshire, she replied with one in Spanish. She was fond of gaiety and outdoor life. To rahirl in the dance, to cross country with the hounds, seemed second nature to her, while to tramp through the woods and along the rural roads with her young friends was one of the ordinary enjoyments of her life. Though she had an ex- cellent ear for music, she never sang or played on any instru- ment. She was below the average height, about five feet, not more, and this is indicated by a satin skirt, thirty-seven inches in length, which she wore in her married life when she was twenty- five years of age, just before leaving for Upper Canada. The waist is missing, but the skirt has been preserved at Wolford. The garment was known as Mrs. Simcoe's \"presentation dress/' 'and was worn by her at the opening of the first Legislature of Upper Canada at Niagara on the 17th September, 1792. It was in the spring of 1782 that Colonel Simcoe first met Miss Gwillim; and as the story of her life is so interwoven with that of her husband, it is fitting that the reader should have some knowledge of the family of Simcoe; for the first Governor of Upper Canada was a man of marked ability, whose name is to-day a household word in the great province, the government of which he inaugurated under many difficulties. BROCADE SKIRT WORN BY MBS. SIMCOE. (From the Original at Wolford.) 1 1 CHAPTER II. ANCESTORS OF JOHN GRAVES SIMCOE. It was only in the summer of nineteen hundred and six that the writer finally after years of research determined that the Simcoe family was of Cheshire origin. There are no records in the papers at Wolford in Devon which give any trace of the birthplace or even the names of the ancestors of the first Governor of Upper Canada. Indeed, it was only after a continuous personal quest in- volving a careful examination of a score of parish and other records in villages, towns and cities of Northumberland, Yorkshire, Nor- thamptonshire, Devonshire, Cheshire, and even north to the border- land of Berwickshire, that the writer was able to place his hand or/ documents that proved beyond doubt that the ancestors of John Graves Simcoe were born and bred in Bunbury, a village and large parish in West Cheshire about three miles from Tarporley and a mile and a half southeast of Beeston Castle. This old stronghold occupies a romantic and impregnable site on the summit of a huge and lofty isolated rock. It was built in 1220 by the fourth Earl of Chester and dismantled after surrender to the Parliamentary forces in the year 1646. The parish records date from the year 1559. Mrs. Simcoe visited the old ruin on one occasion but no date is given in the memoranda. It was probably about 1800-1. The first trace of the name of Simcoe was found by the writer in the \"Cantabrigiensis Graduati\" of the University of Cambridge, published in the year 1800. At page 381 of this work under the letter \"S\" is the record \"Simcoe, Gail., Christ, A. B., 1675\" and \"Simcoe, John, Christ, A. B. 1716.\" The late Dr. John Peile, the master of Christ's College, 1887-1910, informed me that \"this Wil- liam Simcoe of 1675 was the son of a William Simcoe, born at a place not given, in Cheshire, was at school in Bunbury, and was admitted a sizar under Mr. Lovett at Christ's College, 5th April, 1672, aged 19.\" The parish records show that he was born in the parish of Bunbury. At Cambridge University and Trinity College, Dublin, a sizar was an undergraduate of limited means, and was allowed free commons and some other gratuities. Formerly menial duties were imposed upon a sizar. A memorandum on a half sheet of note paper in the papers at Wolford states that Captain John Simcoe, K.N., father of General Simcoe, was born at Leamside farmhouse, some miles from the city of Durham; but other than this memorandum, though a close exam- ination has been made of the property registers of Durham Uni- versity, at one time owners of the farm, there is no entry to be 12 CAPTAIN JOHN SIMCOE, RN. found containing the name of Simcoe. It should be stated that the University records in this regard are not extant before 1752. There are some hundreds of entries of births, marriages, and deaths of persons named Simcoe in the parish books of Bunbury and the adjacent parish of Acton, the earliest dating back to 1759, but there are so many entries with Christian names alike that it is impossible to fix upon the ancestor of William Simcoe who entered Christ's College, in 1675. The opinion prevails at Bunbury that \"William Simcoe/' a churchwarden who died in 1664, was his father. GATE OF BEESTON CASTLE — CHESHIRE. (From an old Drawing in the J. Ross Robertson collection.) The same difficulty arises in determining the parentage of Captain John Simcoe, R.N., born in 1714 and father of John Graves Simcoe. Hodgson in his history of the parish of Long Horsley in Northum- berland states that Captain John Simcoe was a son of the Rev. William Simcoe, vicar of that parish, who died in June, 1714. If this statement be true the vicar died in the year his son was born. There are no letters or documents in the papers at Wolford too help in a verification of Hodgson's statement. Suffice it to say that Captain Simcoe was a distinguished naval officer. Of his early life nothing is known. His after life shows that he was a man of exemplary habits and character, highly educated, and had made a 13 DIARY OF MRS. SIMCOE special study of seamanship and naval tactics. He was thoroughly earnest in his work, eager in the obtaining of knowledge and with a mind most retentive, made the best use of leisure hours in per- fecting himself so as to eventually reach the top round of the ladder in the profession he had chosen. He had an extensive knowledge of the classics and in mathematics he excelled. He was a voracious reader and his cabin was the home of a small library consisting not only of works on military and naval tactics but of the best authors in general literature. Through the influence of his father he entered the Royal Navy as a midshipman in 1730. The name of the ship is not on record. In 1737 he was promoted to a lieutenancy and in 1743 at twenty- nine years of age he obtained a captain's commission. In 1747 he was in command of H.M. Ship \"Prince Edward.\" His ability was recognized in many ways by the Admiralty, and his advice was often sought in considering questions of grave import. He was one of the members of the court-martial on the trial of Admiral Byng (1756-7). About four years before the capitulation of Quebec he drew up/ a plan, and wrote an able paper suggesting the manner in which not only the ancient city could be captured, but how Canada could be possessed by the British Crown. He addressed this document to Lord Barrington, who was Secretary of War 1755-61 ; and the latter after giving the paper a careful reading complimented Captain Simcoe on its excellence, and said that when the time came to act, his sug- gestions would have due consideration. Another paper entitled \"Maxims of Conduct,\" or, as it is also called, \"Rules for Your Conduct,\" was written in 1752 by Capt. Simcoe for the guidance of young officers in the naval and military service, and for the edification of his sons. It is an admirable paper, unexcelled in stvle and diction, as worthy of perusal in these modern days as when it was penned a hundred and fifty-nine years ago. After his marriage with Catherine Stamford Captain John Simcoe decided that he would make his home in Cotterstock, a village about a mile from the old town of Oundle in Northamp- tonshire: Four children, all sons, were issue of this marriage, Paulet William, John, John Graves, and Percy William. The first and second sons died in infancy, and the fourth was drowned in 1764 at Sandy Point above the head of the river Exe near Exeter. On August 22nd, 1747, Captain John Simcoe was granted by the Garter and Clarenceux Kings of Arms, the arms and crest here given, namely: — Azure, a fesse wavy ermine, between two stars of twelve points in chief and a cannon barwise in base or, and for his crest, out of a naval cross or a demi sea lion proper holding in his fore fin a mariner's cross staff erect or and on his shoulder a rose gules seeded proper. In October, 1747, application was made by Captain Simcoe for an alteration in his arms. The extract from the official document, 14 DEATH OF CAPTAIN SIMCOE dated 4th November, 1747, regarding the granting of this alteration, reads: — \"The crest depicted on the other side granted to John Simcoe of Chelsea, in the County of Middlesex, Esq., and his descendants is hereby altered from out of a naval crown or a demi sea lion proper holding in his fore fin a mariner's cross staff erect or and on his shoulder a rose gules seeded proper, to out of a naval crown or a demi sea lion proper, holding in his fore fin a dagger erect argent, the pomel and hilt gold and on his shoulder a rose gules barbed and seeded proper as the same is in the margin hereof more plainly depicted/' Captain Simcoe joined H. M. Ship \"Pembroke,\" 60 guns, in 1757, as com- mander, with Mr. James Cook as master, and in 1759 sailed for Canada with the fleet under Admiral Saunders. Mr. Cook was afterwards the celebrated navigator who in 1768 circumnavigated the globe in the \"Endeavor\"; and in later years he declared that he was under many obliga- tions to Captain Simcoe, for from him he had received a great part of his training in \"navigation and seamanship.\" Captain Simcoe, however, was never to reap the reward of his years of study in naval work, for on Tuesday, May 15th, 1759, while the \"Pembroke\" was near- ing the island of Anticosti he died of pneumonia and was buried at sea at six o'clock on the evening of the 17th. Mrs. Simcoe, on receiving the sad news of the death of her husband on the \"Pembroke,\" decided to leave Cotterstock, where she had spent many happy years, and remove to Exeter. She had friends in Devon, several of whom resided in Exeter, and she felt that the advantages for the education of her children would be much greater in a city, possessing better schools than Oundle/ She accordingly rented a dwelling in the Cathedral City and determined that her life's aim should be the care and education of her boys. But her cup of sorrow was not yet full. The CAPT.

DIAEY OF MES. SIMCOE son and to a certain extent outlived the last great sorrow that fell to her lot. The future Governor of Upper Canada was an apt pupil. He received his primary education at the Free Grammar School in Exeter and in 1766, in his fourteenth year, he was sent to Eton. On 4th February, 1769, while in his sixteenth year, he entered Merton College, Oxford, and matriculated. There is no record of his graduation. It is said that owing to ill-health he was compelled to withdraw from college at the end of his first year. He accord- ingly returned to his mother's home in Exeter and with the assist- ance of a tutor he devoted the years 1770-1 to the acquiring of general knowledge and especially to the subject of military tactics, for he had the promise of an ensign's commission from friends of his mother in the War Office. In 1771 at the age of nineteen he entered the army as an ensign in the 35th Regiment of Foot. He sailed on the outbreak of the war of the American Eevolution for New England and joined his regiment in June at Boston a few days after the historic battle of Bunker Hill, or rather Breed's Hill; for that is where tb£ battle took place on the 17th of June, 1775. His anxiety to be of service to the Crown was shown by his offer to raise a corps of negroes for service in New England; but not- withstanding the strong influence of Admiral Graves, his godfather, who was in command of the fleet, his offer was declined by General Gage, who was in command of the forces. While his regiment was stationed in Boston he acted as adjutant, but there is no record of his appointment. At the evacuation of Boston in March, 1776, he embarked with General Howe's army for Halifax. During his stay in Halifax he purchased a captaincy in the grenadier company of the 40th Eegiment, and when New York was threatened with attack he sailed with the forces early in June for Staten Island and disembarked with the army on 3rd July, 1776. He took an active part in the military operations in Long Island and the Jerseys during the summer and won commendation for his services. While at winter quarters at Brunswick in 1776 he went to New York to see Sir William Howe and ask for the command of the Queen's Eangers, which was then vacant. But driven by stress of weather out of its course, the boat in -which he sailed was delayed and he arrived at headquarters QTT, WTTT * some hours too late, for the position had been o!

In the summer of 1777, still bent on an independent command, he wrote to General Grant, under whom he had served, requesting his influence in the securing of a \"command similar to that of the Queen's Eangers; but there were no vacancies, and once more he was disappointed. The Queen's Eangers were at 16 JOHN GRAVES SIMCOE that time commanded by Major Weymess. Shortly afterwards, on the llth September, was fought the battle of the Brandywine. Simcoe led his company of the 40th Regiment and received a wound, from which he never fully recovered, although he was able to resume his duties. At last his ambitions were realized, for on the 15th of October, 1777, Captain Simcoe was nominated major commander of the cele- brated Provincial regiment known as the Queen's Rangers, which became under him one of the most efficient and gallant corps .that took part in the War of the Revolution. It was at this time encamped with the army in the vicinity of Germantown, near Philadelphia. In June, 1778, he received from Sir Henry Clinton the local rank of lieutenant-colonel of the Rangers. In an action in 1779 he had a narrow escape for his life and was taken prisoner. He obtained his release on the 31st of December, 1779, and returned to his regiment. His Majesty on the 19th of December, 1781, was pleased to confer upon him the rank of a lieutenant-colonel in the army, the duties of which he had fulfilled from the year 1778. His regiment was amongst the troops which were included in the • sur- render by General Cornwallis at Gloucester Point on the 19th of October, 1781. The story of his part in the campaign as colonel of the Queen's Rangers, as told in his journal, will be found in another volume. His journal is one of the most interesting books of its kind. It was published in Exeter at the close of the war, and was .received most favorably by the press and highly commended by the leading military writers of England. Simcoe returned to England in December, 1781, at the close of the war, married Miss Gwillim in 1782, and from 1783-7 he resided in the Cathedral City. In 1784, the estate of Wolford, four miles from Honiton, in the parish of Dunkeswell, Devon, was purchased by Mrs. Simcoe. Although there was an old farmhouse on the property, a new resi- dence was built; the estate was considerably improved during the years 1786-7, and in 1788 Colonel Simcoe and his family left Exeter and took up their residence at Wolford. He held the rank of colonel in the army from the 18th of November, 1790, and in the same year he was elected to Parliament for the borough of St. Maw's in Cornwall. His political career, however, was of short duration, for in. 1791 he received his commission as Lieutenant-Governor of the new province of Upper Canada and sailed from Weymouth for Quebec on the 26th of September in the ship \" Triton,\" 21 guns, accompanied by his wife and two of his children and Lieutenant Talbot. In a despatch to the Secretary of State, Lord Dorchester had .previously recommended Sir John Johnson as first Lieutenant- Governor of Upper Canada. Sir John Johnson had rendered valuable services, and in the matter of claim was entitled to consideration. On the other hand, his appointment was undesirable, not only on .account of his large property holdings in the new province, and 2 17 DIARY OF MBS. SIMCOE consequent local interests, but also from the fact that the policy of the British Government did not allow the appointment of residents of colonies in the government of the same. The \"Triton\" arrived in Quebec on the llth of November. Lord Dorchester, the Governor-General, was on leave of absence in Eng- land and Major-General Alured Clarke, who by the way was a Devonian, was acting as administrator. Simcoe had been entrusted with the commission of and instructions to the Governor- General which were to be issued on the division of the province into Upper and Lower Canada, together with the commission of Sir John Johnson, Bart., as Superintendent-General of Indian affairs, and the commission of Major-General Alured Clarke as Lieutenant-Governor of the new Province of Lower Canada. All these documents were duly delivered on the day following his arrival. Simcoe presented also a personal letter from the King to H.R.H. Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, the father of Queen Victoria, in which His Majesty commended the newly appointed Governor io his son, who was in command of the 7th Fusiliers, stationed at Quebec. It should be stated that Governor Simcoe was offered by the War Office before his departure for Canada the rank of Brigadier-General ; but he declined the promotion because he foresaw that unless His Royal Highness should be promoted at the same time, his acceptance would place him above the King's son. Moreover, Governor Simcoe understood that such promotion was not desired by Prince Edward, and from general belief it was also not his Majesty's intention to confer it. Governor Simcoe had always a dislike to nominal rank. His local Provincial rank in America was senior to that of Major-General Alured Clarke, for early in 1778 Simcoe had been gazetted a lieutenant-colonel, though of course ranking as the youngest of the service. The Governor in a letter to Mr. Dundas on the 6th September, 1791, said: \"I by no means wish to command or to wound the feelings of a senior officer, much less to interfere with the just pre- tensions of the son of my Sovereign.\" The official proclamation and the text of the Act dividing the old province of Canada into two provinces was issued on 18th No- vember, 1791, a week after the Governor's arrival in Quebec, and was published in the Quebec Gazette of December 1st, 1791. The natal day of the new provinces was fixed for the 26th of December. General Alured Clarke was duly sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Lower Canada, but being administrator in the absence of the Governor- General he occupied a different position from that of Governor Simcoe. When the proclamation was issued for the division of the province, Lieutenant-Governor Clarke had full powers as regards his own government, but he had no authority to deal in any way with the affairs of the civil government of the Prov- ince of Upper Canada. But, at the same time, acting as administrator, 18 APPOINTMENT AS LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR he could exercise all the prerogatives and powers of the Governor-in- Chief in either province. The Act of 1791 making further provision for the government of the province of Quebec is familiarly known as the Act for dividing the province of Quebec into the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada. But Mr. Avern Pardoe in his excellent paper on \"The First Chapter of Upper Canada History\" (Ontario Historical Society Transactions, Vol. VII.) points out, the creation of the new provinces was an Act of the King under his royal prerogative. The Crown divided Quebec by proclamation and Parliament's duty and privilege in the matter was to provide a constitution for them. The statute quoted enacts that these provinces which the King has created shall have a Legislative Council and Assembly and that these shall be assembled by the Governor or Lieutenant- Governor. But there is nothing in the Act authorizing the appointment of a Gov- ernor or Lieutenant-Governor. That is another prerogative of the Crown — in these days exercised on advice but hardly so in the days of George III. Nor does the Act contain any information as to the extent of the powers conferred upon the Governor or the Lieutenant- Governor of the Province. That is yet another prerogative of the Crown. The powers of the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor are those conferred upon them by their commissions and instructions. Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe seems to have been from the first at a loss to know his exact relations to the Governor-General, Lord Dor- chester. The commission of and instructions to Lord Dorchester as Governor-in-Chief and Captain-General over the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada issued on the division of the province, were brought out by Simcoe as before said, and Simcoe's own instruc- tions directed him to read Dorchester's instructions and conduct himself accordingly. The power of the Governor-General was almost unlimited. The whole duty of the Lieutenant-Governor was to follow out the instruc- tions of the Governor-in-Chief. There were no instructions issued to Governor Simcoe other than his commission and the injunction to regard Dorchester's instructions, neither is there record of any in- structions having been addressed to Simcoe. His commission, which was simply a few hundred words appointing him as Lieutenant- Governor, contained nothing that would throw light on the extent of the powers the Lieutenant-Governor should exercise. Simcoe felt that in accepting office he should in the main have been free to administer the affairs of the province as one endowed with authority, and that he should not be hampered with edicts and instructions from Quebec, but should have the right to com- municate direct with the home authorities. As a matter of fact he did so communicate. In the Simcoe correspondence there is a letter from Sir George Yonge in connection with the military force, giving an \"extract from the instructions given to the civil Governor.\" 19 DJAKY OF MKS. S1MCOE These instructions show that, where no specific orders have been given by the Commander-in-Chief or by the General commanding the district, the civil Governor-in-Council may give orders for the inarching of troops and other military services; but such order must be repeated to the Commander-in-Chief, and that the Civil Governor must not interfere with the detail of the military regimental duty. The complexity of the situation and the delay in getting his government formed was galling to Simcoe. He foresaw that he would be virtually cribbed, cabined, and confined in Quebec for the winter, and that he was absolutely powerless to make any immediate move in the direction of occupying his seat of government. Meanwhile he occupied his time with various matters that con- cerned the new province. Many months before his departure from England, indeed before the Canada Act of May, 1791, was passed, he had considered the policy he would pursue in conducting his new government; for, of course, he knew at that time his appointment was assured. One of Simcoe's first suggestions was the raising of a military force for service within the limits of the province. This suggestion Avas assented to in August of 1791, the corps being known as the Queen's Eangers. Another was that he should be permitted to visit Philadelphia, where the United States Congress was sitting, to discuss and mediate on the Indian question. But this suggestion was not acted upon. Even in regard to the administration of justice in Upper Canada the Governor's hands were tied ; for, as there was no majority of his Council in Canada, the oaths could not be administered. He, there- fore, had no power to issue a proclamation. This was after the division of the provinces was proclaimed. Major-General Alured Clarke could act for Lower Canada, but Governor Simcoe, until he had taken the oath, had no legal power. This difficulty might have affected the organization of courts in Upper Canada, but when Judge Powell was appointed to hold court in Kingston in December, the difficulty was overcome by him, as, on the advice of Chief Justice Smith, he did not raise the question of authority to hold court in the new province. Simcoe now occupied a singular position. By virtue of his com- mission he was the Governor of the new province of Upper Canada, but, notwithstanding, had no military command ; and as regards his own military rank, he could not avail himself of his colonelcy until the corps — the Queen's Eangers, of which he was Commander — or part of it, was actually on service under him. This restriction was specifically set forth to Governor Simcoe in a letter from Sir George Yonge, the Secretary of State, on September 21st, 1791. Simcoe knew that the Rangers would not arrive until the summer of 1792 and keenly resented the inevitable delay in the recognition of his rank. 20 TAKES OATHS OF OFFICE Furthermore, his civil powers' as Lieutenant-Governor were not operative until a meeting of the Executive Council had been convened and the oaths of office administered. Four members of this body had been nominated by the authorities in London, namely, William Osgoode, William Robertson, Alexander Grant and Peter Russell. Mr. Grant was the only member who had arrived in Canada. Thus,, in the absence of a majority of his Council, the Governor had practically to mark time and await their arrival. Simcoe saw clearly the situation and at once applied to England for permission to nominate James Baby, of Detroit, as one of the three Councillors required and asked permission to appoint two more so that the seven members required by the act would meet and initiate the business of organizing the government of the new province. In June, however, Osgcode and Russell arrived, and with Baby made a quorum. The appointment followed of John Munro, of Matilda, in January, 1792, and later of Richard Cartwright, jr., of Kingston, Robert Hamilton, of Niagara and Richard Duncan, of Rapid du Plat. The Council was now complete. William H JAMES BABY Robertson, however, never came to Canada but resigned, his place being filled in June, 1793. by the appointment of Aeneas Shaw. All this delay was vexatious to Simcoe. True, he and his wife were the recipients of unbounded hospitality from the military, civil, and social leaders of the old capital, but the Governor was a man of active habit and eager to journey to his new province. At the end of May and in the second week of June two divisions of the Queen's Rangers arrived at Quebec, and some weeks later reached the new province. Governor Simcoe had paid a short visit to Montreal in December/ 1791, but did not go further west. On the 8th June, 1792, with his. family and Lieutenants Grey and Talbot he left Quebec for Kingston in bateaux, arriving in Montreal on the 17th, leaving there on the 27th and reaching Kingston on the 1st of July. On the 8th of July the Governor repaired to the Protestant church, and there the oaths were administered by Chief Justice Osgoode. The Honorable James Baby and the Honorable Peter Russell, together with the magistrates and principal inhabitants of the town, were present ; and the ceremon- ial must have been, so far as the primitive environment permitted, of a very impressive character. A note containing the minutes of the Executive Council in connection with this event is given in its proper place in Mrs. Simcoe's diary for July, 1792. From Kingston, Governor Simcoe, with his family and suite, sailed on the Government schooner \"Onondaga\" for Niagara, where they arrived on the 26th July, 1792. Navy Hall was undergoing, alteration?. These were not completed, so by the Governor's orders 21 DIARY OF MKS. SIMCOE three marquees were pitched on the hill above the Hall. In these the Governor's family and suite were housed pending the completion of the alterations. Navy Hall had been originally built by Governor Haldimand for the use of the naval officers on the lakes. During Simcoe's time some additions were made. One of these was a council chamber, and it was used as a ball-room where Mrs. Simcoe enter- tained. Simcoe's work in the way of organizing the Provincial Government and carrying on the affairs of the Province, will be told in another volume. Simcoe was energetic in his administration and was inspired by a determination to do his best for the people he was called upon to govern. The first Legislature was called on 17th September, 1792, at Navy Hall, Niagara, and was prorogued on the 15th of October. There has always been some doubt as to the building and the place where the first Legislature met. Some assert that the meeting was held in a tent pitched on the common above Fort George. This ground was marked 'by an old oak tree known as the \"Parliament Oak.\" A picture of this tree in decay is in the Museum, Niagara-on- the-Lake. Another writer asserts that the Legislature met in Free- masons' Hall, Niagara. The records of the Upper Canada Gazette, however, dispose of all doubts, for in the issue of that paper of 18th April, 1793, the words \"Government House, Navy Hall\" are used, and on 3rd July, 1794, the same words are used, while on the 10th of August, 1794, Governor Simcoe calls the members to appear at \"our Government House, Navy Hall.\" On the 14th of August, 1794, the latter expression is again used. During Simcoe's term from 1792-6 five sessions of the Legislature were held at Niagara, in one of the four buildings known as Navy Hall, for there was no accommodation for the Legislature at York. The buildings at York were not ready for occupation till 1797, the year following Simcoe's departure. Rochefoucauld in his \"Tour Through Upper Canada,\" 1795, writes that \"during our residence at Navy Hall the session of the Legislature of Upper Canada was opened.\" He does not indicate any building other than \"Navy Hall\" and says the Governor \"dressed in silk entered the hall with his hat on his head, attended by his adjutant and two secretaries.\" Eight acts were considered and passed. The ancient laws of the Province of Quebec were abolished, the laws of England were to prevail, and all forms of law and equity were to be in conformity with the British rules of evidence. Trial by jury was established and provision made for the recovery of small debts. Jails and court houses were to be erected in the four Districts, the Eastern, the Middle, the Home and the Western.
