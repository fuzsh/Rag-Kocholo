Page 69: the Watt micrometer is in the Science Museum and has been carefully checked for accuracy with surprisingly good results. Page 176: the work of the American Watch Company at Waltham, Massachusetts, deserves more attention; in fact, a monograph on their early anticipa- tion of highly specialized, precision automated machine tools is sadly needed. Page 241: Rolt has been more than generous in crediting American developments, but one would like to see some mention of the development of metal-sawing as a production process by the Wilkies, as well as a phrase crediting the original tape control of ma- chine tools to M.I.T. Pages 93 and following: while Clement’s constant- speed facing lathe of 1827 is of interest to the specialist, and Rolt de- serves great credit for adding a full account and an excellent drawing of this device to the literature, this lathe is really a tour de force which had little industrial importance; it is perhaps only significant as marking the final demise of the tradition of the ornamental turning lathe. This excellent piece of work was commissioned by the distinguished Birmingham firm of machine tool builders, Charles Churchill and Com- pany, Ltd., whose Deputy Chairman, Mr. Ralph Gabriel, is to be congratulated for the wisdom and vision of sponsoring a work of this sort and for allowing the author such freedom of action that one is rather surprised that the very real contributions of this firm to machine tools receive such limited mention. The book was published simultaneously in London by B. T. Batsford Ltd., under the title Tools for the fob. Such co-operative publication seems quite fitting when one remembers that the Churchill firm was founded by an American who brought the new American tool inno- vations to England. Robert S. Woodbury '■arly Engineering Reminiscences ( 1815-40 ) of George Escol Sellers. Ldited by Eugene S. Ferguson. (“U.S. National Museum Bulletin” 238.) Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, 1965. Pp. xx-f-203. Illustrations, maps, diagrams. $2.50. Before long Eugene Ferguson will have demonstrated, by his ex- ample, what the “complcat” historian of technology must be and do. Having already placed us substantially in his debt by his series of Contributions to Bibliography in the History of Technology” which have been appearing in this journal, Dr. Ferguson now proceeds to show us in a immature gem of editing how the materials described in Ins Contributions” are to be handled. The basic “document” of this study is itself of interest, and its dis- covery and re-publication is a valuable contribution to the history of technology. George Escol Sellers (1808-99) was one of a distinguished SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM BULLETIN 238 WASHINGTON, D.C. 1963 Publications of the United States National hAuseum The scholarly and scientific publications of the United States National Museum include two series, Proceedings of the United States National Museum and United States National Museum Bulletin. In these series the Museum publishes original articles and monographs dealing with the collections and work of its constituent Museums — the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of History and Technology — setting forth newly acquired facts in the fields of Anthropology, Biology, History, Geology, and Technology. Copies of each publication are distributed to libraries, to cultural and technical organizations, and to specialists and others interested in the different subjects. The Proceedings, begun in 1878, are intended for the publication, in separate form, of shorter papers from the Museum of Natural History. These are gathered in volumes, octavo in size, with the publication date of each paper recorded in the table of contents of the volume. In the Bulletin series, the first of which was issued in 1875, appeal' longer, sepa- rate publications consisting of monographs (occasionally in several parts) and vol- umes in which are collected works on related subjects. Bulletins are either octavo or quarto in size, depending on the needs of the presentation. Since 1902 papers relating to the botanical collections of the Museum of Natural History have been published in the Bulletin series under the sub-series Contributions from the United States .\\atinnal Herbarium. Since 1959, in Bulletins titled “Contributions from the Museum of History and Technology,” have been gathered shorter papers relating to the collections and research of that Museum. This work, brought to completion while the author was curator of engineering in the Museum oi History and Technology, forms number 298 of the Bulletin series. Frank A.

It illuminates a facet of our technological heritage that is little known despite its essential importance to our understanding of the emergence of the United States as an industrial nation. Here the reader will meet many of the craftsmen and engineers who devised and developed the machines and techniques that made possible the growth of an indus- trial complex. He will find many fresh details of surprisingly sophisticated tools and skills that existed during an age that he has been taught was mechanically uncouth. Before one can understand why progress occurred as it did, it is necessary to know what actually happened, who did what, and why. This is the kind of infor- mation that is presented in the pages that follow. Written with rare precision, per- ception, detachment, and good humor, these reminiscences have freshness and vigor that commend them to every interested reader. The author, born in 1808 in Philadelphia, a block and a half from Independence Hall, was from early boyhood a constant visitor in and an alert observer of the many mechanical shops that were scattered about that part of the city. He knew, and tells us about, many of the leading mechanicians of the generation that spanned the administrations of Jefferson and Jackson. In these pages, the names of Phila- delphians and sojourners in the shops of Philadelphia, as well as the names of other Americans whose paths crossed that of the author, take on qualities of flesh and blood. Ranging farther afield as he grew older, the author made a visit to England in 1832 that enabled him to hold a mirror to the state of the mechanic arts in America, as he observed with a critical but kindly eye some of the great mechanicians of the Old World. Most of the narrative included here appeared in a series of articles in the American Machinist between 1884 and 1893, which until now has been effectively buried in the stacks of the relatively few libraries that have preserved early volumes of this magazine. It was tracked down through an offhand reference that Sellers made in 1895 to his “valedictory,” written “several years ago.” A few additional episodes have been culled from two unpublished volumes in the Peale-Sellers Col. lection of the American Philosophical Society Library. It is quite remarkable that the reminiscences of an old man — Sellers was 75 when he wrote the first article — of events that occurred more than 50 years earlier should stand up so well under careful testing of his factual statements against those contemporary with the events described. The reader will quickly note that Sellers xi had an uncommonly good memory; but occasional comments by the author show that he had also bales and boxes of papers, drawings, and artifacts of an active life- time to refer to. Limited only by his failing eyesight, he used his reference mate- rials with skill and candor. Even when his details can be disputed, which is seldom, his broader strokes paint a likeness that lets us see a real person where there would be otherwise only a name. The reader can hardly fail to find new insights, previously unrecognized relationships amongst people and events, and occasionally— as when ebullient Jacob Perkins or sagacious Bryan Donkin step out of the page to confront the reader — sheer delight. I have selected for publication those parts of the story that are pertinent to the history of technology, believing that they will be useful as source materials in the many studies that ought to be made of the technical history of this period. The articles describe events that the author had direct knowledge of. Second-hand narrative or historical summary are retained only when they contain information not otherwise available, or when editorial interpolation would do violence to the author’s narrative. Family history, of which a great deal exists in the unpublished volumes mentioned above, has been left for biographers of the several prominent members of the Sellers and Peale families. These reminiscences were written over a period of nearly 15 years, and for all their essential charm and freshness they were sometimes rambling and repetitious; no detectable plan or order was followed in their preparation. Therefore, the arti- cles, and occasionally passages within an article, have been rearranged to give very roughly a chronological sequence. Editing within each article has been held to a minimum, and changes and omissions have been noted in the text. Marks of elision have not been used generally to open and close passages from the typescript volumes in the American Philosophical So- ciety Library because the typescript is made up of a series of letters that really has neither beginning nor ending. Because the work is presented as source material, 1 have tried to preserve its meaning by not tampering with the author’s style. I have spelled out abbreviations, corrected the spellings of names, and increased the number of paragraphs greatly, because the author paid little attention to such things. Grammatical changes, which have been made only when necessary, have been bracketed. Footnotes that appear more bibliographic than interpretive are intended to sug- gest further studies. I have assumed the risk of annoying some readers by tedious annotation in the hope that others will make use of the information and will help to fill in some of the larger gaps in our knowledge of this field and this period. I have been helped in every stage of the work by many individuals who have generously supplied encouragement, information, or pictorial materials, as the occasion demanded. My first thanks are to Jo, my wife, who has submitted with patience and under- standing to the tyranny of a work-in-progress in our home. Two former colleagues have been particularly helpful: Robert I\\ Multhauf encouraged me to undertake this work; John II. White put his extensive detailed knowledge and records of early railroads at my disposal, and he gave freely of his time in reading the manuscript, in discussing points not clear to me, and in locating materials for my use. Xll Charles Coleman Sellers, biographer of Charles Willson Peale and author of the monumental, definitive Portraits and Miniatures of Charles Willson Peale, lias answered my many questions and has graciously opened doors whose existence I was unaware of. It was Charles Coleman Sellers' father, Horace Wells Sellers (1857-1933), who encouraged his uncle George Escol Sellers to expand his reminis- censes, and he assiduously collected, arranged, and transcribed the numerous papers that his uncle wrote. John H. Powell, catalyst extraordinary of historical studies, furnished a summary of his work on Patrick Lyon that greatly expanded my knowledge of this colorful, competent mechanician. The kind assistance of Mrs. Gertrude D. Hess and Murphy D. Smith made my several visits to the American Philosophical Society Library both profitable and pleasant. Norman B. Wilkinson, John W. Maxson, Jr., and James L. Anderson have all responded with helpful answers to my unbidden queries. My special thanks go to George Giguere, who drew the frontispiece portrait of the author. Mrs. Catherine Scott’s patient work of typing, retyping, collating, and comparing the manuscript has helped to insure a faithful rendering of the author’s narrative. While I thank all of those who have lent aid and encouragement, I take sole responsibility for opinions, conclusions, and mistakes. Ames, Iowa September 28, ig6p Eugene S. Ferguson Figure i. — Coleman Sellers (1781-1834), father of George Escol Sellers. Portrait by Charles Willson Peale, 1811. Photo courtesy of Charles Coleman Sellers and Frick Art Reference Library. George Escol Sellers George Escol Sellers was born in Philadelphia on November 26, 1808, the second son of Coleman Sellers (1781-1834) and Sophonisba Angusciola Peale Sellers ( 1 786-1859). One of his grandfathers was Nathan Sellers, widely known in the United States and in England as a fine craftsman in the exacting art of making wire paper molds. Paper molds and machinery and, later, the actual making of paper were to engage much of George Escol’s energy throughout his life. Coleman, his father, became involved in the building of fire engines, and this, with the general machine works that grew out of his various enterprises, provided training for George Escol over the whole spectrum of the mechanic arts. His other grandfather was the renowned Philadelphia portrait painter and museum builder Charles Willson Peale. The boy's mother, like her brothers Rem- brandt and Rubens and Titian, was named for an .artist in her case a female Italian portrait painter of the 16th century. George Escol was at home in the museum, as he was in the workshop. When lectures were held in the Peale Museum, the bo\\ often assisted in preparing and cleaning up the apparatus used for demon- strations. Ilf was, in fact, at home wherever there was something interesting to be xiv Figure 2. — Sophonisba Angusciola Peale Sellers (1786-1859), mother of George Escol Sellers.

He was accurately characterized by Jacob Perkins as “the boy who asked questions and would have an explanation of everything.”1 His formal schooling started with his attendance at the “ABC” school of Mrs. Saul, who held forth in a second-story room on Chestnut Street at Seventh, about two blocks from his home. He recalled this “giantess with a terrific turban on her head” as having “not a particle of kindness within her skin and her greatest delight seemed to be in torturing the kids entrusted to her care.”2 Until he was 1 5 or 16 years old, he had various schoolmasters, remembering with particular gratitude and affection his term with Joseph Roberts, who taught in the Friends’ School on Fifth Street and whose fourth-day afternoon lectures were open to all whom his students cared to invite. In Roberts’s classroom, George Escol sat at the same table with Solomon and William Milnor Roberts, both to become civil engineers associated with the Penn- sylvania Portage Railway, and with John Dahlgren, of naval ordnance fame. It was in the fourth-day lectures that Sellers met John C. Trautwine, whose civil engineering handbook was one of the earliest and most durable works of its kind.3 Sellers attended a private class in mechanical drawing held by William Mason, machinist and instru- ment maker; and he drew with John Haviland, architect.4 His practical training 1 Peale-Scllers Papers, George E.

Although he was bound to no particular master as an apprentice, he became certainly a competent machinist, profiting from associa- tion as a boy with such Fine craftsmen as Isaiah Lukens, William Mason, his uncle franklin Peale, and the itinerant German aristocrat known only as Henri Mogcme. Like most other engineers of his generation, the only advanced training that Sellers obtained was in the field or from such books as he was able to command. George Escol Sellers was born less than a decade after the great federal period of Philadelphia's history, when President Washington lived across Market Street from Nathan Sellers’s store and paper mold manufactory between Fifth and Sixth Streets, when Secretary of State Timothy Pickering lived next door, and when such lumi- naries as David Rittenhouse were of “the set that congregated about the stove ol winter nights in the Market Street store.” ’ lb- could recall personally the merchant * Memoirs, book 1, p. 78; book 7, p. fi. xvi banker Stephen Girard, however, and he told of Girard’s hurrying into his grand- father’s store one morning to volunteer financial help for Nathan Sellers, without endorsers, when an erroneous report of his failure got abroad.6 Nathan Sellers moved about 1817 to a new home in Upper Darby Township, which he called Millbank; and Coleman’s family, including George Escol, moved into the Market Street store. In 1828, an association by Coleman with John Brandt, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania — who had devised a particularly good machine for form- ing and setting the teeth in textile cards and card clothing — led to the building of shops that were named Cardington, near Millbank on the Marshall Road. The Cardington shops grew rapidly. In addition to cards and carding machinery, Coleman Sellers and his sons George Escol and Charles (two years older than George) built a line of papermaking machinery. In 1832, when he was nearly 24, George Escol spent several months in England to observe and learn whatever he could of papermaking machinery. Shortly after returning from England, Sellers was married, in 1833, to Rachel B. Parrish. A house at Cardington was enlarged for their use, and during the several years that they spent in Cardington two daughters and two sons were born into their household. After the death of Coleman, in 1834, the sons engaged in general machine work, building, among other things, two locomotives for the state railroad of Pennsylvania and steam engines and other machinery for the branch mints then being established in North Carolina and Georgia. In the depression that followed the panic of 1837, the enterprise failed and the Philadelphia chapters of George Escol Sellers’s life were effectively closed. With his elder brother Charles, George Escol then established in Cincinnati a plant to make lead pipe in continuous lengths from fluid lead. While he remained in Cincinnati, George Escol sold his interest in the lead pipe plant, organized the Globe Rolling Mills and Wire Works, and designed and promoted a grade climbing locomotive 7 that he preferred not to enlarge upon in his recollections. In 1849, while they were in Cincinnati, George Escol and Rachel adopted Louisa Stockton Peale, the orphaned daughter of Edmond Peale, one of George Escol’s many cousins. A last daughter, born to Rachel in 1852, survived only two months. During the ensuing eight years their second son and both daughters died, all three of them around 20 years of age. In the fall of i860 Rachel died, leaving her husband with but one surviving son and an adopted daughter. During and after the Civil War, Sellers spent several years in southern Illinois on the banks of the Ohio River, engaged in an abortive scheme to use the pithy swamp canes as paper stock, and pursuing as an avocation the study of Indian mounds in the vicinity of his home. The results of his speculations and experiments 6 Memoirs, book 1, p. 42. 7 Obituary in American Machinist (March 30, 1899), vol. 22, pp. 250-251.

John H. White, curator of land transportation, Smithsonian Institution, will have a chapter on the Sellers grade-climbing locomotive in his forthcoming work on Cincinnati locomotive builders. XVII upon the flaking of stone for arrowheads and other instruments were summarized in a publication of the Smithsonian Institution.8 Upon his retirement from business, George Escol Sellers, his sister Anna, and his adopted daughter Lui took a house on Missionary Ridge in Chattanooga. There he wrote the series for American Machinist; kept up a correspondence with brothers, nephews, and cousins in order to straighten out obscure points and to reinforce his own memory; and wrote hundreds of unpublished pages of reminiscences con- cerning the very numerous Sellers and Peale clans. Fascinated by his own memory, George Escol frequently speculated upon the mechanics of a brain’s ability to store seemingly unlimited quantities of information. His prodigious memory was a source of wonder even within his own family. To one of his relatives he wrote: 9 I remember many little things when I was not over 2 years old. Once at Millbank Aunt Nancy was questioning me and telling me of little things when Mother asked, “What is the earliest thing you do remember?” “I can’t go back of the great snowstorm of Nov. 26th, 1808.” Mother sat a moment thinking when she exclaimed, “Why Escol that was your birthday.” “Yes Mother I did not think it safe to go back of that.” Sister Anna, writing in 1893 to onc °f the Peales, called attention to brother Escol’s article on the early U.S. Mint. “It reads like a story,” she wrote. “My brother is an old man to write such long articles,” she continued, “but he does it to bring in some money — this time to pay for painting his house outside — or to help towards it ... . Escol is in his 85 year he does much carpenter work, and garden- ing yet is very lame in both knees — and gets very tired.” 10 There was more to Escol’s writing than the money it brought in. It was his way of communing with the past and with posterity, leaving narratives and notes, in ink and in pencil, “from which some facts may lie picked out after I have joined the majority.”* 11 In 1898 he was keeping a diary, noting daily occurrences, visitors, weather, and the like. He missed not a day throughout the fall, and half way through December. Each allotted space was filled with his easy scrawl up to his entry for Sunday, December 18. He died two weeks later, on January 1, 1899.

XIX Part I Early Philadelphia Mechanics Philadelphia’s role in the formation of the United States during and for a number of years after the Revolutionary War is generally well known. The Continental Congresses, sitting in 1775 and 1776, rallied the Colonies to a common cause, which was eloquently stated in the Declaration of Independence. After the war, the Constitutional Convention successfully wrought the document that gave the new nation direction and unity. Philadelphia was capital of the United States from 1790 to 1800, while the new federal city of Washington was being readied as the seat of government. From the beginning of the Revolution until the final physical transfer of the national government to Washington in 1800, the great and near-great Americans of the age went about their business in that part of Philadelphia where George Escol Sellers was to grow up. The life in the city was carefully, often vividly, docu- mented because these statesmen and political architects were there. The picture of Philadelphia after 1800 is much less distinct, however. The city’s part in the rapid development of the tools and skills that enabled the United States, within less than a generation, to end its dependence upon England for intricate or heavy machine work has been generally overlooked. Only the merest handful of observers were sufficiently aware of the importance of or had enough interest in technological pursuits to make a record of the mechanicians and their haunts; and those who wrote of the burgeoning industrial complex were generally so occupied with production machines, such as looms, and end products, such as steam engines, that little of their attention could be spared for the machine tools and techniques upon which depended the ability to produce the end products. It is to the task of capturing a record of this most elusive aspect of the city’s culture that George Escol Sellers has so successfully addressed himself. 12 12 The student of any aspect of early Philadelphia history should know of “Historic Philadelphia from the Founding until the Early Nineteenth Century,” Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1953), vol. 43, pt. 1, which contains 27 original papers and a carefully constructed map by Grant M. Simon showing historic buildings and sites. Each paper is detailed and specific. The collection provides a good survey, although it slights technological developments. 1 1. Fire Engines and Leather Hose In the 1 8-volume American edition of Brewster’s Edinburgh Encyclopaedia , published in 1832 in Philadelphia, three plates were added to the 400-odd engraved plates of the original work. One of these added plates exhibited the “Hydraul- ion,” as the Sellers and Pennock fire engine was called, and the riveted leather hose whose de- velopment is described in this chapter. The plate is reproduced here as figure 8. Volunteer fire companies, divided by their function into “engine” companies and “hose” companies, were exceedingly numerous when George Escol Sellers was a boy. Rivalry amongst the various companies, always keen, became at times so intense that the business of extinguishing a fire was subordinated to the business of prevent- ing another engine company from getting the first stream on the fire. Patrick Lyon (1769- 1829), 13 a very able mecha- nician who is known today mainly because of artist John Neagle’s vivid life-size painting of Pat at his forge, had been building fire engines and hose carriages since 1794, 14 many years before the Sellers family became involved in their manufacture. Upon returning in 1818 from a sojourn abroad, Pat stated flatly and character- istically, in an advertisement, that his engines (built for cash only) were “far superior to any imported or made here.” 13 Riveted “hose, or leather tubes” and riveted leather mail bags were patented by Abraham L. Pennock and James Sellers on July 6, 1818. 16 The firm of Sellers and Pennock, probably formed about the time of the patents, included George Escol’s father Coleman, Coleman’s cousins James and Samuel, and Abraham Pennock. 17 The author’s later adventures in the Sellers and Pennock shops are recounted in chapter 7. 13 Coming to Philadelphia in 170;!. after serving an appren- ticeship in London, Pat Lyon was at 24 an honest, blunt- spoken man wlio prospered almost immediately as a skillful craftsman. Before his misfortunes of 1798 he employed four or five journeymen mechanics. In 1708 he was imprisoned and < 1 nelly persecuted for a bank robbery that he was innocent of. Suspected because he had made the doors of the bank’s cash vault, lie was thrown into the Walnut Street jail in Sep- tember, where he remained for nearly three months, even after the actual thief had been caught, the money had been returned, and the culprit hail disclaimed Pat Lyon as an accomplice. Seven years later, in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, he won his suit for false arrest and malicious defamation of char- u< ter against the mayor of Philadelphia and the bank officers. 1 he verdict brought forth spontaneous cheers from a crowded courtroom.

At the time of these inventions fof riveted leather hose and riveted leather mail bags] I was a boy of about nine years of age, but like most boys of that period of life, I took great delight in running after “the machine” on every alarm of fire, and not un- frequently, at fires, dropping into line to pass the leather fire buckets, of course on the return line of empty ones. To the present generation, who have become ac- customed to our city fire departments with their steam fire engines drawn by horse power to the fires, accompanied by throughly trained and organized men that scientifically attack and conquer conflagra- tions, it may be interesting to take a retrospective glance at the organization and the performance of private volunteer associations, supported by the public spirit and zeal of their members, with but trifling pecuniary assistance from the public crib. For it is to these organizations with their great emulation and rivalry, and to the intelligent and ingenious men belonging to them, that the invention and introduction of riveted leather hose is due. It is the most important improvement of the times in the mode of extinguishing fires. At the time I am writing of, Philadelphia had taken the lead of all other cities in America, and I might safely say of Europe, in improved fire apparatus. The old fashioned English Newsham side lever engines were still in use in New York. In Philadelphia they had given place to the more powerful end lever engines on which the men could more directly and effectively apply their force. The general plan of two single acting cylinders, with a center air vessel on the Newsham plan, had not been changed, except by increase in size, the end lever arrangements with their folding arms admitting of an increased number of men to man the engine. This change in construction was mainly due to Patrick Lyon, a workman of extraordinary skill for Figure 4. — Patrick Lyon, craftsman, at age 24 in 1799. This portrait is the frontispiece in Lyon’s The Narrative of Patrick Lyon, who suffered three months’ severe imprisonment in Philadelphia Gaol; on merely a vague suspicion of being concerned in the robbery of the Bank of Pennsylvania with his remarks thereon (Philadelphia, 1799). Library of Congress photograph. the time. . . . The general plan of the long end lever, with the folding arms or handles, was originally sug- gested by Mr. Adam Eckfeldt, a sound, practical mechanic, and almost a life long .chief coiner of the U.S. Mint. At that time he was a member of one of the volunteer fire companies — I think of the Diligent, but of that I am not certain — but it was for that com- pany that Lyon built his first engine of that class.18 It was substantially the same type of engine as after- wards built by Merrick & Agnew, until the time they were superseded by the steam fire engine. 18 Eckfeldt was president of the Good Will Fire Company. The 1820 engine — which probably was not the first that Lyon built for the Diligent Fire Company, south side of Market, near 8th Street — is credited as Lyon’s “masterpiece.” (Scharf and Westcott, cited in note 14 above, vol. 3, pp. 1894, 1907, 1 9 1 1 -) 3 Pat Lyon had at his shop a little cubby-hole of an office, warmed by an old wood burning ten plate stove, around which he and his men would congregate of evenings to crack jokes, smoke their pipes and drink their grog. On a shelf in this office was a working model of folding levers with the long, wooden hand handles hinged to studs on crossbars between the side levers, that in an instant could be thrown open, grasped and firmly retained in clasps. They had additional out-riggers that on emergency could be attached, increasing the physical force by some twenty or twenty-four men. Pat never tired of work- ing and exhibiting this model and expatiating on the great value of the arrangement, always attributing it to his friend Adam Eckfeldt. The fire engine and hose companies were generally separate companies, but worked together. That is, hose companies, although professing to furnish water to the first engine on the ground, managed that their favorite one should be so considered. This often led to severe and sometimes bloody contests. Among these volunteer companies there were distinctive social grades. For instance, the Philadelphia Engine and the Philadelphia Hose Companies, having their houses next to each other, were worthy of the Quaker element. They were rich companies, and indulged in the finest kind of apparatus regardless of cost. Their great oilcloth coats and capes, and broad- brimmed japanned hats, were a peculiar and dis- tinctive uniform. The Resolution Hose Company, a near neighbor, was mostly of the French element — sons, junior partners, and clerks of the large French importing firms.19 All their equipments were the pink of perfection. The Phoenix Hose was another of the aristocratic companies, and had many of the younger generation of Quakers in its organization. The Diligent, the Assistant and others of the city proper companies were composed of solid men of the city. The position of foreman of the companies was highly prized, as was also that of pipe men to the engine companies. Two of them on the gallery of the engine would direct the pipe to throw the stream of water onto the roof or through doors and windows of burning buildings — much of it to be dissipated in vapor without reaching the burning mass, and doing but little effectively towards extinguishing the fire. I he companies in the Liberties, or outside of the city, as then incorporated, had not the wealth to lavish on fine apparatus and show but what they 18 ( :<)ii(irmrfl in SctlARF and Wf.sTCOTT, vol. 3, p. 1 Rf)H. lacked in wealth they made up with vim and zeal rarely equalled and never excelled. This produced a rivalry that frequently led to rather serious results. Franklin Peale, at that time the manager of the Philadelphia Museum, 20 that had its home in the old State House or Independence Hall, arranged a system of bell signals to indicate the direction of a fire from the State House — one stroke on the great bell, repeated at intervals, for north; two strokes with regular intervals, for the south; and so on for the cardinal points and intermediates.21 On an alarm of fire being carried to the State House, the great bell would call out the entire fire organizations. Then came the great rush, the madding races, the ringing of the bells on the engine and hose carriages, the bellowing “Fire” through speaking trumpets that every fireman was armed with; it was pandemonium broken loose. The heavy fire engines or hose carriages, with their 1,000 or 1,200 feet of hose, were like a feather’s weight to the string of men and boys who manned their long- drag ropes. It was the fouling of the engines or carriages in these furious races — contests for possession of the nearest fire-plug or hydrant — that led to the most disastrous conflicts, in which costly apparatus was damaged, hose spanners and speaking trumpets playing a conspicuous part, as many a scalp wound could testify. Philip Garrett, a prominent watchmaker and jeweler,22 a member of the Society of Friends, was the foreman of the Philadelphia Fire Engine Com- pany. He was in his element when fighting fires. I well remember that he was admitted by every one to be the par excellence of city firemen. Often as a boy have I listened with great interest to conversations between him and my father as to the most effective mode of extinguishing fires. One point they were certainly agreed on; that was that by water the fuel or combustible matter and not the 20 Franklin Pcalc was employed in the museum from 1822 to 1833 (Chari. es Coleman Sellers, Charles Willson I'eale, 2 vols., Philadelphia, American Philosophical Society, 1947, vol. 2, PP- 345> 38a). 21 The bell signals for fire are given in “Regulations of the State House Bell in case of Fire,” Desilver's Philadelphia Direc- tory . . . for itisg. 22 Later, but at least as early as 1832, builder of steam engines, small lathes, etc., and from 1833 to his retirement in 1840 part- ner of Garrett, Eastwick, and Harrison, locomotive builders (Sciiarf and Wkstcott, cited in note 14 above, vol. 3, p. 2238; Joseph Harrison, Jr., I he Iron Worker and King Solomon, with a Memoir and an Appendix , 2d ed., Philadelphia, 1869, p. 119). 4 Figure 5. — “Pat Lyon at the Forge,” by John Neagle, 1829.

My father was never an active member of any fire company, though his name stood on the rolls of several as an honorary member. I think these were companies he had built engines for. Simple as the question is, as it now appears to us, of applying the water through a hose directly to the burning fuel, it was at that time the great stumbling- block. Hose companies suffered so much from the ripping of seams, or bursting of hose as it was called, when subjected to the force and pressure of the fire engine pumps that they refused to allow it to be used in that way. This led to the invention of what for many years was known as the “Hydraulion,” a com- bination fire engine and hose carriage in one, and was designed by my father,23 the Philadelphia Hose Company being the first to adopt it, and the “Phoenix” the next to follow. A large number of a smaller class of these were built for country towns and smaller cities, Richmond, Va., Washington, D.C., and Providence, R.I., taking the largest class. The water supply of Philadelphia, in case of fires, was very deficient, the main supply being from the small reservoir 24 in the dome of the pump house in Centre Square (the present site of the new public buildings of Philadelphia). It was conducted through bored wooden logs of such small capacity that in case of fire citizens having hydrants were requested not to use them. Every block where the system extended was provided with a fire plug or hydrant, so poorly constructed that notwithstanding straw wrapping and wooden curbs they were apt to be frozen, and useless in cold spells; besides these fire plugs each square had a small wooden cistern sunk under the pavement, with a wooden hand pump for public use. These cisterns were kept full by a hollow 23 According to Sciiarf and Westcott (vol. 3, p. 1896), the Hydraulion was built in 1814 by James Sellers, '['lie Journal of I hr Franklin l ml i lute (May 1827), vol. 3, pp. 286-287, credits William I’. Morris, member of Philadelphia Hose, for the idea and James Sellers for the design of the Hydraulion. 2* According to I.atrobe, 7,500 gallons, which in 1803 supplied normal city demand for only 25 minutes, but which could be refilled in 6 minutes (“Manuscript Communications to A.P.S., Mechanics, Machinery, etc., no. 25, B.

Many of the old public wells had not been closed; their pumps were always of service. The hook and ladder companies ran with them a fire-bucket carriage; some of the engine companies also had their bucket carriage. All public buildings and halls, as well as many entries of private residences, had their suspended rows of fire buckets. These were made of leather, stitched as hose was, stiffened by “jacking,” or saturated with a mixture of resin and wax over a charcoal fire. They were fancifully painted with the names of the institutions or parties they belonged to, and they played an active part in supplying water to the fire engines. It was not an uncommon occurrence to see lines of bucket-passers of men and boys, and often women, slinging from hand to hand buckets of water from pumps as much as two blocks from the fire engine. To understand the difficulties attending the use of sewed leather hose under heavy pressure, we must look at the manner of its construction. There were two plans. One was simply lapping one edge of the leather over the other, as is now done in the case of riveted hose, and sewing two lines of stitches from inside to out. The objection to this was serious. In dragging the hose when in use over the cobble stones of the street the outside stitches would soon wear off and the hose would rip. The plan generally adopted by the Philadelphia hose companies was to double or fold the leather so it would lay flat together, insert a strip of soft leather between, like a shoe welt, trim the edges straight, sew two rows of stitches through the leather and welt strip, exactly as harness traces are sewed. When the hose was opened this would present a ridge or rib from end to end, with the stitches protected from wear when dragging. The strain of head pressure was brought lengthways of the stitches as they passed through the leather. The soft leather strip was left to project slightly inside the hose, which, when wet and opened, was beat into the seam, tending to make it tight. New hose when first made would stand the required pressure, but the hemp stitches would soon lose their strength. The dubbing of train or ncatsfoot oil and tallow, which used to render the leather impervious to water and keep it soft and pliable, had the effect of destroying bv a kind of rot the hemp stitching, so that its lifetime was very, short. The stitches would give way while the leather remained in good condi- tion. A stronger union than hemp stitches was not onlv desirable but was an imperative necessity, and 6 Figure 6. — Philadelphia-type fire engines of about 1800, displayed in Independence Hall group.

About this time there occurred a great fire in the heart of the city that spread with fearful rapidity and mastered all efforts of the firemen. I was standing with my father on the curb looking at the fire, when Philip Garrett rushed up in a great state of excitement, seized my father by his arm, and said: “Coleman, if thee can dam the stairways and hatchways of the upper floors of those two ware- houses (pointing), and I can get a foot of water on the floors, we can stop the fire at that fire wall, but if we let it work down the walls will fall, and the whole block will go, and there is no knowing how much more.” My father turned me over to some one to see me safe home, and left with Mr. Garrett. I learned afterward that my father, with board parti- tions that he tore down, succeeded with them and gunny bags in damming both stair and hatchways, making small crevices tight by having large quanti- ties of bran thrown on the floors. The roofs were on fire and would soon fall in. Lines were formed for carrying up water by the bucketfull. 7 Instead of going home as directed, I for hours had my place in the empty bucket line. While this was going on Garrett was having section after section of hose attached to both the Philadelphia and the Diligent engines, only to burst before the water reached the upper floors. Fortunately the Resolu- tion Company had a number of new sections of hose which were pressed into the service, and were at- tached next the engines where the pressure would be greatest. The floors were flooded, the attics and roofs fell into the water, and spreading fire was stayed. The success of this expedient was so com- plete that it turned the attention of all firemen in the direction of securing more reliable hose. . . .[i] 25 At the time I am writing of the old firm of N. & D. Sellers, that dated back to the Revolutionary War, was carried on under the same name by my father, son of Nathan, and his two cousins Samuel and James, sons of David. James was an active member of the Philadelphia Hose Company, and was much inter- ested in experimenting to find a substitute for the hemp or flax thread for sewing hose, not subject to their decay, and that would not be injured by the dubbing and have a lifetime at least equal to that of the leather. He made a short section of hose sewed with an- nealed copper wire with a double row of stitching. To have the wire sufficiently pliable to draw the leather close and make a tight seam he was obliged to use a wire considerably thinner than the hemp or flax thread, and owing to the difficulty in inserting the wire in the punctured holes they were made larger, and the leather did not close tightly on the wire, which lacked the swelling property of the thread stitches which had aided greatly in closing the holes. This section was tried fully up to the required pres- sure, but not without considerable steeping through the stitch holes; at an increased pressure the thin wire cut the leather and the leakage increased. Yet the experiment was considered so far a success that the hose company agreed to bear the expense of further experiments, and Mr. J. Morris and Abraham I,. Pennock were appointed a committee with James Sellers to assist him in prosecuting the experiments. Many were tried to render the wire-sewed seams 2* Bracketed numbers refer to sources of text material for the preceding section. I.ist of sources is i^ivrn on p. it)'). more pliable and to stop the cutting and steepage, but unsuccessfully. The next experiment was by nailing; this at first promised well. A workman, named Andrew Link- felter, was in the employ of the firm [N. & D. Sellers], whose business for many years had been driving tacks in putting together hoops or rims of meal and grain sieves, and who prided himself on being able to so drive a large headed wrought tack, then called a “clout nail,” so as to insure a certain and perfect clinch always in the same direction. To him was given the job of putting together the first sections of nailed hose. This was done by lapping one edge of the leather over the other as it is now done with the riveted hose, and driving two rows of clout tacks, clinching them on an iron mandrel. Several sections of 50 feet each of hose were so made, and subjected to very severe tests, showing no signs of yielding, but in after tests the clinches began to give way, and finally the seams ripped. This was mainly owing to the swelling of the leather when wet and shrinkage on drying tending to strain and loosen the clinch. The next experiment was driving one row of tacks near the outer edge of the leather as it lapped over, clinching them on the iron mandrel as in the previous case; then a row of holes was pierced near the edge of the inner lap and the tack inserted from the inside with its head resting on the mandrel. The leather was then driven down around the tack by a hollow punch; a row of about a foot in length of these tacks being so arranged with their points exposed, they were turned by a pair of round-nose pliers, clinched and driven home by light hand hammer. This stood the tests well, but it was a tedious and costly process. My recollection is that during all these experiments James Sellers devoted his whole time and attention to them. Mr. Pennock was almost daily at the shop for a short time, and Mr. Morris only occasionally. I recollect one day when all were present. My father asked if it would not be possible and better to put another head on the tack instead of clinching it. The next move that I remember was seeing my cousin James casting a hard pewter composed of tin, lead and copper into a single rivet or washer at a time in molds similar to the single mold used for casting rifle bullets. In this way the rivets and washers were made for the first section of riveted hose. The next advance was in making long brass molds in which 1 5 or 20 rivets or washers in a row were cast at a single pouring. They were afterwards cut from 8 ' Tixr, rrym'iJ TliUj JfflYSXLTJj ixntititkii .irLY M7»i . iwmhihimtki) apkii. uam .

Smith Museum of the Home Insurance Company, New York. the gates with common hand nippers. A long series of experiments were tried to get a fusible metal hard enough to stand the wear of dragging the hose over the stone pavements, and yet not too hard and brittle to rivet well. The first cast rivets were very badly proportioned, the heads being 9/16 inch diameter and 1 / 1 6 inch thick; the shanks of the rivets a di- ameter equal to No. 6 Birmingham wire gauge [less than 1 / 4 inch], the washers the same diameter and thickness as the rivet heads. As to the length of time that these cast rivets, and washers were used I am uncertain. My elder brother and myself of evenings and holidays cast and clipped from the gates many hundred-weight of them. Next in order came copper rivets and washers. These rivets were headed by hand. No. 8 copper wire was cut into lengths by a machine turned by hand crank, then headed in half dies closed by a lever pressing together spring jaws that carried the dies. This lever was operated by a foot treadle (the old English wrought nail header) and the head was struck by two regulated blows of a four-pound flat-faced hand hammer. The sheet copper for washers was cut into strips of a width that would admit of four or six washers being cut from them; this was fed by hand under two punches, a small one to punch the center rivet hole, the large one that followed to punch out the 9 PLATE creel.

When for economy tinned iron rivets and washers came into use the same manner of cutting the wire and heading by hand was continued for years before a cutting and heading machine was in- vented and adopted, but for punching out the wash- ers and using full size sheets of copper or iron my father invented and constructed a machine that left the sheets, from which the washers were cut, in a useful form for screens, or for covering cellar windows instead of woven wire, and for various other uses. This machine, without any alteration as to plan, continues in use to the present time. It is also used for perforating sheet iron or steel for coal screens and for floors of malt kilns. A wooden straight-edge; a shoemaker’s leather knife; a rocker or templet, with points to mark the places where holes for the rivets were to be punched by a hollow leather punch; a hollow set punch to drive the washer home and to bring the leather in close contact were used. This set punch was made like a hammer, with an iron handle with a broad, flat- tened end; the face of the hammer portion, drilled out to go over the rivet, was faced with steel; the end on which the blow was struck, soft iron. When this set punch was grasped by the handle in the left hand, a turn of the wrist, after the washer was driven home, would bring the edge of the flat end of the handle on to the washer, and hold it down while the riveting blows were being struck. A set punch, to round and finish the riveting; a riveting hammer, an iron mandrel to rivet on, were the entire outfit of tools when the first riveted hose was made. But soon labor-saving machinery had to be invented. First in this order came a ratchet ar- rangement to feed the strips of copper under the washer punches, instead of the hand feed. This soon led to the machine that I have above alluded to, in which whole sheets of planished copper, 30 by 60 inches, the size then imported, and iron sheets of much greater length, utilized what before was waste. Before the machine was invented for cutting the wire into lengths, and by a plunger driven by cam and toggle, upsetting the head forming the rivet (the germ of all rivet and blank headers for wood screws of the present day), samples of hand-made copper rivets and washers were usually sent to England, and a large invoice imported from Birmingham. The washers were well enough, but the rivets were so rough and irregular in size as to be useless for riveting either hose or mail pouches, and they found their way to the brass founder’s crucible. Screw stretching frames to take the wind out of the sides of sole leather, after they were skirted, and before the hose strips were cut, that the hose in use would keep straight; machines for cutting and trimming, beveling and tapering the ends where the strips of leather were to be spliced together, and simultane- ously punching the double row of holes for the spliced rivets; a machine through which the spliced strips of leather were fed, the rivet holes automatically laid out and punched; all these inventions were but the natural sequence of the invention of riveted hose, or leather water tubes, as it was called by our English progenitors .... [2] 11 2. Jacob Perkins in Philadelphia Even a casual inspection of a list of his patents — 21 in the United States, 19 in England, with only a few common to both countries — will convince a reader that Jacob Perkins’s head fairly rattled with ideas.26 Many of the ideas were good ones, but because he was forever developing new ideas and improvements on old ones, he never quite got around to demonstrating, in his impecunious lifetime, that some of them were economically sound. When he came to Philadelphia to live, in 1815, Jacob Perkins was already in his 50th year. His inventions at this time ranged from nail cutting and heading machines to plunger pumps for freeing ships of water, and included a series on the engraving of banknotes so as to prevent forgery. There were two inventions for fire engines. Still in the future lay his abortive high pressure steam boilers, his fearsome steam gun, and his entirely sound vapor-compression re- frigeration cycle; and still in the future lay his passage to London and his development there of the lively mechanical sideshows of his Adelaide Gallery. As Sellers relates in this chapter, Perkins took as first partner in his fire engine venture Coleman Sellers, George Escol’s father. The partnership was dissolved before the end of June 1818 when Perkins and Jones 27 commenced advertising their fire engines at prices ranging from $250 to Si, 000. 28 This partnership was dissolved in turn within eight months, being succeeded by the firm of Perkins and Bacon. Bacon was a son-in-law of Perkins.29 Commodore Alexander Murray (1754-1821), Perkins’s particular foil in the episodes that follow, was commandant of the Philadelphia Navy Yard from 1813 to 1 82 1. 30 26 The standard work on Perkins is by Greville Bathe and Dorothy Bathe, Jacob Perkins (Philadelphia: Historical So- ciety of Pennsylvania, 1943), which is a compilation of pertinent data and many illustrations. The Sellers reminiscenses ap- parently were unknown even to the Bathes, whose searches were most diligent and far-ranging. 17 Thomas P.

Alexander Murray was commandant in 1813-1821; James Barron was commandant in 1824-1825 and again in 1831- 1837. Barron was not in the United States during most of Perkins’s time of residence in Philadelphia, which was from December 1815 to May 31, 1819, and he was not on active duty until 1824. See Paul Barron Watson, The Tragic Career of Commodore James Ilarron, U.S. Navy ( r 769- / <9^ / ) (New York: Coward-McCann, 1942), pp. 81, 84; “A Brief History of the Philadelphia Navy Yard,” unpublished typescript in Naval Records Section of the National Archives; and Bathe and Bathe (cited in note 26 above), pp. 59, 76. I have changed the text to read “Murray” throughout, being con- vinced that he was the man involved. Barron also was some- thing of an inventor. A floating drydoc.k of his is illustrated in Journal of the Franklin Institute (1827), vol. 3, p. 87^. 12 My earliest recollection of Jacob Perkins was as associated with Murray, Fairman, Draper, Under- wood, etc., as bank-note engravers. I think my father’s acquaintance dated back of that, as I have heard him relate having been summoned as an expert in a suit for infringement of Perkins’ tack machine for cutting and heading tacks in one operation, the ground of the defense being so imperfect a specification that no one could construct a machine from it. After my father had answered that he had neither seen the machine nor read the specification, the latter was handed to him. After he had carefully read it, he was asked if he could construct a machine from it. His answer was, “Yes.” He was then asked to explain how he would proceed to do so. The deficiency in the specification was the want of describing the mode of transferring the cut tack to the heading tool. When my father came to that part, he went on describing how he should construct it, and its operation. When asked if he found that portion in the specification, his answer was, “No; but it would naturally suggest itself to any mechanic as the simplest mode; in fact there were only two ways of accomplishing it.” He then described the other mode that would answer the purpose, but it was not so simple and effective. Two machines then in the court were uncovered in which both plans had been adopted — the first described in the original Perkins’ machine, the other in the infringing one. This testimony decided the sufficiency of the specification, and the Perkins company gained their suit. I think this was previous to Perkins coming to Philadelphia, and that an intimacy was at that time established. Perkins had perfected the most important work or invention of his life — the annealing of cast steel, so as Figure 9. — Jacob Perkins (1766-1849). From Appleton’s Dictionary of Machines, Mechanics, Engine-work and Engineering, 2 vols. (New York, 1867). to substitute it for copperplate engraving, and re- hardening the plates, transferring to soft steel rollers or dies, from which, after hardening, plates could be multiplied. This manipulation, together with the beautiful scroll-work of Spencer’s ingenious geo- metrical lathe or rose engine, became, and still continues, one of the most important features of our American banknotes. [3] Perkins prepared the plates and the firm of Murray, Draper, Fairman & Co. did the engraving, with Spencer doing the lathe work.31 31 Bathe and Bathe (cited in note 26 above), p. 73n, give a very brief sketch of Asa Spencer (d. 1847). The Spencer geometric lathe is described and illustrated in British patent 4400, October 11, 1819, taken out under the name of Jacob Perkins. Lathe drawings are on sheets 1 and 2 of 6. A description of the machine and an example of the work pro- duced by Spencer’s lathe are in Journal of the Franklin Institute (1826), vol. 2, pp. 106-108 and plate. Short notices of George Murray and Gideon Fairman are in Scharf and Westcott (cited in note 14 above), vol. 2, pp. 1057-1058. 13 Figure io. — Asa Spencer’s “engine lathe for engraving oval or geometrical figures upon metal or other surfaces.” “Fig. i,” elevation of swinging head- stock, pivoted at c, c, with “oval chuck formed as usual” at right end; “Fig. 2,” end view, with oval chuck removed (the adjustable cam S' and follower — attached to arm t — are shown only in this view) ; “Fig. 3,” rear end view.

The steel plates were annealed in contact with oxide of iron in close retorts until soft enough to be engraved with the ease of copper plates, then they were recarbonized and hardened. I was too young at the time to fully understand the philosophy of the operation, but not too young to watch with great interest Mr. Perkins’ manipulation. The care he took to have the water rapidly pass over his plates to carry off the heat forcibly impressed me. He had small steel cylinders that he used in trans- ferring the engravings. His mode of handling these in hardening them was very interesting to me. He heated them in what he called mufflers closely packed in with carbon which was made of wood charcoal, and about an equal portion of a coal made of leather scraps that he burned in crucibles. I have a clear recollection of what he called his muffler furnace and also of the mufflers themselves as I have carried them to him from Miller’s pottery on Filbert Street to our shop. I hey were tubes flattened on one side O made of fire brick clay and about % inch thick. I hey were long enough to reach from side to side of his furnace over a charcoal fire made on a grate. charcoal being added from time to time so that the fire surrounded the mufflers. It was a long heating process and to my boyish question of why he did not heat them in the open fire, his reply was that they would be ruined by scale, if the air was not entirely excluded, and to the question as to why he was so long about it and so careful in watching the fire, he said it was necessary as a part of the hardening process. I do not think the wood and leather coal dust were all he used in packing his cylinders in the mufflers, but I collected the leather scraps for him and when burned pounded them together with the wood coal in a great iron mortar. When Perkins was satisfied his cylinders were in condition for their cold bath, if from any cause they refused to be pushed from the muffler he never hesitated to break the muffle, seize the cylinder with heated tongs and plunge it into a gushing stream from a hydrant. The hardening of steel by a quick running stream of water or by jets was a frequent subject of discussion between Father, Perkins, and visitors to the shops, to which I have listened with great interest and atten- tion. Among the most frequent visitors that I 14 remember taking an interest in the subject were Isaiah Lukens, Rufus Tyler and his partner Mason, Matthias Baldwin, Dr. Thomas P. Jones, Dr. Mease, but most frequently old Prof. Robert Patterson who at that time was director of the U.S. Mint and Adam Eckfeldt the chief coiner, who were almost daily visitors.32 .... It was the result of these early demonstra- tions 33 that so fixed on my mind the importance of quickly moving water or strong jets to rapidly carry off the heat that all of my after practice was based on it in some form or other. It was a common prac- tice with Lukens and Mason and Tyler. I have a distinct recollection of seeing Lukens harden a pair of small steel rolls he had made for Charles Willson Peale to roll the gold plates for the artificial teeth he was then making. These rolls were less than 3 inches in diameter and about 4 inches on the face. He heated them with a charcoal fire in a muffle furnace, he placed them in V bearings under a hydrant jet and with one hand he regulated the jet and the other rotated the roll. [4] While Perkins was engaged in the banknote en- graving business in Philadelphia, he exhibited to my father drawings of his single-chamber fire-engine, with combined plunger and piston, the plunger filling just one-half the area or space of the chamber.34 32 Baldwin, Jones, Mease, and Patterson (father and son) are noticed in Dictionary of American Biography. William Mason, engraver in brass, etc. (1820) and philosophical instrument maker and engineer (1825), formed a partnership with Matthias Baldwin in 1825; they made book binder’s tools and calico printing cylinders (Scharf and Westcott, cited in note 14 above, vol. 3, p. 2255). Rufus Tyler, machinist (1825), was partner of Mason through April 1827. Mason and Tyler were die sinkers and makers of “machines in general, par- ticularly where great accuracy and excellence of workmanship are required; such as Rose-engines; Sliding-rests; fine Turning- lathes; Lever, Screw, and Drop-presses; calico engraving machines; machines for engraving and stamping Bank note dies, &c, &c.” ( Journal of the Franklin Institute, 1827, vol. 3, adver- tisement by firm of Mason and Tyler on back cover of each issue through April 1827; starting in May 1827, the advertise- ments appear under the name of Tyler only.) Lukens and Eckfeldt appear again in later chapters. 33 The omitted passage (1500 words) just preceding this note described Perkins’s demonstration of the varying effects of water in small and large quantities upon a very hot surface — say 12000 F. This was by way of preparation for a demon- stration of Blind Hawkins’s high pressure steam generator, mentioned in the next chapter. As the piston rises, the water, flowing in, fills the entire space of the chamber below it. On being depressed, the lower valve closing, all the water passes through valves in the piston, and, as the plunger fills just half the space, one-half the water is ejected from the nozzle, equal amounts being ejected on both rising and descending strokes. In its simplicity of construction, as arranged by Mr. Perkins, lay all its merits. He estimated that it could be constructed at a cost of fully 25 percent less than the common double-chamber engine. The plunger, the chamber, the surrounding cylinder that carried the water from its escape holes in the top of the chamber to the bottom of the surrounding air vessel, and the air vessel itself, were all to be made of drawn copper tubes or cylinders, and clamped between brass bottom and headplates by outside bolts, the same elongated bolts securing it to the bottom of the wooden engine-box or tub; he also showed the plan of a machine he had devised, and fully tested, for drawing, or rather forcing, these copper tubes or cylinders through dies. At that time, owing to the smallness of the mains — in fact, all the street pipes were disproportionate to the number of hydrants — the city was very inade- quately supplied with water. Good housewives, at night, when the hydrants would run, filled their tubs and buckets for the next day’s supply. Almost every square had its street cistern and pump, around which, of evenings, hosts of men, women, and children would collect, waiting their turn to fill their buckets or garden watering-pots (Philadelphia was always a city of grass plats and small gardens); and Mr. Per- kins argued that a cheap garden engine, that could be run to these cistern pumps like a wheel barrow, would have rapid sale. He planned an oval upright tub on two wheels, with wheelbarrow handles and legs, with one of his small single-chamber pumps in it. To build these and small village fire engines, my father joined him under the firm name of Perkins & Sellers. They located their works at the head of St. James’, a little court or street that ran east from Seventh above Market Street. This was the germ 34 No records exist in the National Archives of Perkins’s fire engine patents of August 6, 1812, and March 23, 1813, listed in U.S. Patent Office, List of Patents . . . 1790-1847, pp. 221, 224. However, a description and cut are in John Nicholson, The Operative Mechanic and British Machinist, 2d American ed. from 3d London ed. (Philadelphia: 1831), vol. 1, p. 284. 15 from which sprang more important works. I will, en passant, state that on my father’s retirement his place was taken by Dr. Thomas P. Jones, who after- ward became Commissioner of Patents, if I recollect right, succeeding Col. Thornton. [5] The gateway from the Mulberry Court yard into the vard of the fire engine shops was still free to us boys and we made use of it nearly as often as when Father was there. As a boy I was on most intimate terms with Dr. Jones for about that time he frequently took the place of my Uncle Rubens Peale in the popu- lar experimental lectures he was delivering in Peale’s Museum in the State House. On these occasions I was always called on as Dr. Jones’s assistant. I turned the crank handle of the electrical machine, handed him magic lantern slides, washed chemical glasses, bottles, and such like. [6] The business for a short time was conducted under the name of Perkins & Jones, when Perkins decided on going to England. Samuel V. Merrick, at that time a dry goods merchant, bought his interest, as well as that of Dr. Jones, and associated with him a Mr. Agnew, under the firm name of Merrick & Agnew, so long and well known as successful fire engine builders.35 It was in these shops, during Mr. Perkins’s connec- tion with them, that I learned the peculiar traits of this remarkable man, and which I can no better exemplify than by relating some incidents that therein occurred .... Perkins’s original idea, as carried out, was to build a large number of these garden engines before offering them for sale. For this purpose, shops for carpenters, wheelwrights, blacksmiths, finishing, and setting up were started, and as the engines were finished they were stored away, and when first offered the novelty as playthings for the boys caused a rapid sale for a short time; but it was a case where “ The best laid schemes o’ mice an’ men Gang aft a-gley.” For, while these engines were building, the city authorities were relaying their water mains and pipes 35 As noted in Bathe and Bathe (cited in note 26 above), PP- 69, 75, the partnership passed from Perkins and Jones to Perkins and Bacon. This is the only reference I have found to this version of the origin of the Merrick and Agnew firm. However, the notice of Samuel V. Merrick in Dictionary oj American Biography gives the date of his partnership with Agnew as 1820. with cast iron of full capacity, and a screw nozzle to the hydrant and a garden hose became the successful rival of the Perkins’ garden engine, and a large por- tion of the stock on hand had to find a slow sale in suburban villages or country seats. The Perkins machine for drawing the copper tubes was simple, crude and ingenious. For the small engines their length did not exceed 12 inches, the diameter varying 2 inches to 10 inches. The sheet copper was shaped and brazed in the usual way; it was then slid on a mandrel, which, for the small sizes was solid, for the large hollow, with one end closed for the plunger to press against. The enlarged collar for the tube to be pushed by was less in diameter than the die, so that it could pass through it. The press was a simple toggle joint. The leaf of the toggle next to the plunger or push end was elongated beyond the center joint as a hand lever. By this lever one man could raise the center joint and work the toggle sufficiently to give a thrust that would force the tubes of 3 inches or less in diameter through the die about 1 inch at each rise and fall of his pump handle lever; but on larger sizes the toggle required to be worked at a less acute angle, and it took two men to force the 10-inch tubes through the die from % to % inches at each stroke. As the handle was raised and the plunger drawn back, a suspended wedge would by its own gravity fall and fill the space, ready for the next thrust. These wedges were of a size that when they had fallen their length they would occupy a space of about 5 inches. They were then raised and blocks dropped in, and so on until the pipe was passed through the die, and came out beautifully smooth and planished. There was a frequent visitor to the shops who would stand for hours watching this operation, often repeat- ing aloud, “The power of the toggle is amazing; if we could only apply it to the ship’s capstan it would be grand.” This man was Commodore Murray, then in charge of the Philadelphia Navy Yard. He was fond of mechanics, though not grounded in first principles; would be and fancied himself an inventor. Before relating what grew out of his watching the operation of the toggle, I cannot better show Perkins’ quickness and some of his peculiarities than by re- lating what I witnessed with Murray’s latest inven- tion, his ship pump. He talked a great deal very mysteriously of it, never explaining, but always prom- ising to bring one he was then having made at the Navy Yard, as soon as perfected, and exhibit its great effectiveness. 16 Figure i i . Engraving produced from siderographically prepared plate. The scroll work was done on a Spencer lathe. The original designs and medallions were first transferred to soft steel rolls. These rolls, after hardening, were used to impress the final plate, also of steel, which was then hardened for final use. The ability of the siderographic roll to impress the same design several times in the final plate is here demonstrated. From London Journal of Arts and Sciences (1820), ser. 1, vol. 1. 17 The day at last came that the Commodore with his pump on a dray made his appearance. It proved to be a flapper piston, working in about a )i section of a cylinder; he called it his wing piston. This had a valve on it with one below, as in the common lifting pump. This flapper or piston, was worked by a handle on the end of its axis, that came out of the chamber through a stuffing-box; in fact, it was a single acting section of the old Rowntree fire-engine. The misfortune of the Commodore was the lack of published records accessible to him, and no doubt the invention was original with him. He could not have known that he had been anticipated. The pump was put in the cistern, and the Com- modore himself worked it, expatiating largely on the volume of water delivered, the flapper being large in proportion to the suction and ejection pipes, and the lift of water not over four feet, consequently the pump worked lightly. Perkins bustled around in his quick way, often taking hold of the handle and working it, repeating, “It works well, Commodore; it is a capital thing.” Had he stopped there the Commodore would have gone away delighted, but Perkins, like some other great men, always had a story ready for illustration on every occasion, and was often his own hero. This time he could not keep it in; he began: “Plank, good plank, a side or two of leather, plenty of spikes, nails and rivets, and you always have at command pumps, safety pumps. Why, once I was going from — - — to — — on a heavily laden schooner, in a storm. She sprung a leak; the water gained on the pumps; it was evident she could not float over an hour. Water-logged as we were it would take several hours to make the nearest port with favorable winds. I took the matter in hand. All I had to work with was a couple of planks i% inches thick, 9 or 10 inches wide, and one plank 12 inches wide, all over 9 or 10 feet long. I set the carpenter to ripping the 12-inch plank into two. While he was doing this and spiking them together into a 6-inch square spout and squaring them to a length, I was making a bottom board to nail on the lower end. I made a hole through its center 3 inches square, put on it a leather flapper, hinged wooden valve weighted with a bent bar of lead nailed on it. I cut the blade off a sculling oar, and to the lower end of its handle I nailed a conical leather bucket, made out of a couple of boot tops. The bucket was square, to keep it from crushing down with the weight of the water. I had straps from its top nailed to the oar handle through its upper end. I bored holes at right angles, drove through them a couple of deck broom-handles so that four men at a time could take hold. I cut a square hole in the deck, sounded the depth of the hole, nailed a strip on the side of my ex tempore pump to rest on the bottom, secured the top with nails to the deck, and caulked around it with oakum. There was over 5 feet of water in my pump, so the bucket was deep in it. Four men seized the handles and lifted each lift about 2 feet; they averaged fully 50 lifts per minute, each lift spewing on the deck a col- umn of water 6 inches square by 2 feet, which ran off through the scupper holes. We rapidly gained on the leak, and made port, saving the vessel and cargo.” While Perkins was telling this in his quick, enthusi- astic manner, he became more and more excited, and concluded by turning to Murray and saying: “I will bet you an oyster supper for a dozen that I can my- self make in less than half an hour a pump that will with one man throw more water than that pump of yours does.” The Commodore very good humoredly said he would take the bet, and insisted on an immediate trial. Perkins went into the office, and in a few minutes returned, coat off, and an old boot in his hand, and said he was ready. (I presume he had been looking up materials and placing them handy.) The company of lookers on, who by that time had increased to a dozen or more, adjourned to the shop, many with watch in hand. Perkins gave the signal when ready to start. His first operation was with his pocket knife, to cut a section of about 6 inches off the top of the boot leg, then another of about 3 inches. These he threw into a bucket of water, while his eye wandered as if hunting materials; then rapidly turning over some strips of inch boards standing in the corner, he selected four of them, two of them 3 inches wide, no two of the same length. He was but a few minutes nailing them into a 3-inch square spout, and sawing off its ends square, closing the lower end with a block, through which he bored a 2-inch hole. He doubled the strip of leather for valve fan and hinge (wooden valve), weighted it by boring a hole through it and putting in a inch bolt that lay on the carpenter’s bench. Then to a sweeping-brush handle he crimped in and wired his boot-leg section, roughly squaring its upper end with hammer, tacked with copper tacks, clinching their sustaining straps from the handle. While this was doing the cock was open and the cistern was filling with water. The pump was put 18 Merrirl • .

It was just twenty-four minutes after Perkins stuck his knife into the old boot-leg that he had the water pouring over his legs and feet from his extemporized pump. The Commodore declined going into test of quantity pumped, acknowledged himself beaten, said the supper should be at Rubican’s; that Perkins should name the time and invite the guests. Out of little things do great ones grow is true, and it is always interesting to trace their course. Among the lookers on at this trial were two of father’s friends, who happened in, Josiah White and Erskine Hazard, who at that time were engaged in their effort to float anthracite coal down the Lehigh and Delaware in small barges. Mr. White was so well pleased with the plan of these box pumps with leather buckets, that he adopted them for their barges, from which they found their way to the flat boats of the Susque- hanna, and finally to the Ohio river, and the Missis- sippi and its tributaries, and now there is not a coal barge or shell that descends the Ohio with its millions of tons of coal, or a flat boat carrying millions worth of produce from all the tributaries of the mighty “Father of Waters” that has not two or more of these simple box pumps, worked by spring poles and man power, and on which the safety of its cargo depends, and the leather buckets, or suckers as they are tech- nically called in the West, are to be found ready made for sale in all the supply stores on the rivers. It is just that Perkins should have the full credit of the invention, for small as it appeared at first, it has proved of great utility and vast importance.38 Up to this point the Commodore had taken his defeat good humoredly, remarking “that the United States can have any number of my safety pumps on all their vessels, but they cannot find a Jacob Perkins for every man of war.” This was the kind of flattery that Perkins liked and never forgot, and he referred to this when I saw him in London in 1832. As the Commodore was having his pump placed on a dray to return it to the Navy Yard, a couple of men came up the court; one remarked to the other, 36 This pump, patented on March 23, 1813, two years before Perkins came to Philadelphia, was adopted by several U.S. naval vessels before and during 1816. The plan was also submitted to the Royal Society of Arts in London on January 10, 1820. (Bathe and Bathe, cited in note 26 above, pp. 49-50, 189-190.) “That is the biggest beer pump I ever saw; it is a whopper.” The Commodore hearing this asked the man what he meant; if he thought it would answer to pump beer from one vat into another. The man, who was foreman of a brewery near by, replied that he meant just what he had said, and if the gentleman would wait a few minutes he would show him. He left and soon returned, carrying an English wing beer pump, such as had been used in England time out of mind for pumping beer from the barrel into the glasses or mugs. This was too much for the Commodore; to think that his great pump that he had spent so much thought and labor on, should have been in common use for probably more than a century for such an ignoble purpose, and that he should not have known it. Father tried to satisfy him that his credit for the in- vention was as great as if he had not been antici- pated, as he did not know of it; that the invention had so long stood the test of use should encourage him; that with him invention was not a necessity but a pleasure, and that he should persevere, but advised him when any new idea occurred to him to use every endeavor to learn what had been done in the same direction. [7] I do not know anything of the oyster supper, as I was too young to be of the party, but I do know that it was a long time before the Commodore again came to the shops. One morning I found him sitting in the office, both Mr. Perkins and father being absent. He was play- ing with a two-foot rule. He held one end on the table, the middle joint being up. He was sliding the other end back and forth, watching the rise and fall of the toggle. I told him father and Mr. Perkins would soon be in; he said he would wait. He then asked me to observe that, at the angle he held the rule, that when he moved the end he held in his right hand one inch, the middle joint would rise over two inches, but when he lowered the middle joint a push of % inch would raise it the two inches, but it took a much greater force. He said he had by trial found the angle to place it at, to raise it the distance re- quired with the greatest ease. I could not under- stand what he was driving at. When Mr. Perkins came in he told him that he had perfected the application of the toggle joint to the capstan, and that it worked to perfection; that he had a carriage waiting to take Mr. Perkins and my father 20 to the navy yard to show them the operation of what he considered his greatest achievement; that this time he was certain he had not been anticipated. I was taken along with them. In the second story of a frame carpenter shop was an old horizontal capstan; on each end a strong ratchet wheel; the capstan rested on a couple of long beams, into which its journals were let about half their diameter. These beams formed the foundation for his contrivance, which consisted of two long- leaved toggles, from the center joint of which hung hooked pawls to operate on the ratchet wheels. One end of the toggles was securely hinged to the beams, the other to a movable guided plunger; these were connected by pitmans to crank arms of a rockshaft that extended from one beam to the other. This shaft was provided with sockets to receive handspikes, one of the crank arms being above, the other below the shaft. There was an arrangement to extend this shaft entirely across the deck of the vessel and give an increased number of sockets and handspikes, by which this shaft was rocked, and as it rocked by its crank arms and pitmans alternately pressed against the ends of the toggles, which, by the rising and falling of their center joints by the hooked pawls, continuously rotated the capstan. As soon as Mr. Perkins’ eye took in the arrangement he said: '‘Commodore, you are taking hold of the wrong end of the lever.” “No,” replied the Commodore; “you see what immense leverage I have with my handspikes and the short arms of my rockshaft; I work at short stroke to the best possible advantage of my men, and that wonderful multiplier of power, the toggle joint, gives me so long a lift.” “But,” said Mr. Perkins, “you are taking hold of it in the wrong place. You had better throw it away and attach your pawls directly to your rockshaft arms.” “What!” asked Murray, “give up all the advantage of the toggle that I have seen prove its great power in forcing your copper tubes through the dies?” Father took the Commodore aside, and kindly, with rule and pencil, endeavored to make him understand the principles of the toggle joint leverage, and so let him down as gently as possible. While this was doing, Perkins was busy attaching a rope to the raised center of the capstan, it being what is called a double one, the center being larger in diameter than the end ratchets. This rope he passed through an opening in the floor under the capstan into the carpenter shop below. He gave this to two men, with directions to hold it steady, and not allow the capstan to turn if only the power of one man was applied above. He arranged signals as to when they were to throw their entire weight on. Murray seemed to understand father’s explanations, and he looked very much crestfallen, but, turning to the capstan and taking hold of a handspike, he said: “You see how easily I turn it.” But it would not turn. He threw more and more weight on the lever, finally resting his chest on it. When Perkins gave his signal the Commodore was lifted from his feet, struggled for an instant, lost his balance and fell, sitting on the floor as the lever flew up, as completely hors de combat as ever was a naval officer. It was a pitiful sight that I have always thought of as a cruel trick; but it has served me many a good turn by relating it to would-be inventors that have come to me with marvelous works, to impress on them the necessity of making themselves acquainted with first principles. I will give an instance showing the quick working of Perkins’ active brain. There was a certain Professor, full of mechanical notions, who was in the habit of coming to the shop to be helped out when in difficulty. One day father saw him coming, and said to Per- kins, “Here comes Doctor, brim full; I will leave him to you.” The Doctor explained his difficulty. Perkins said, “Pooh! pooh! that is nothing; do it so,” and he rapidly sketched a plan. “That is the very thing. I wo"
