        "text": "Before I get to my story, know that I have a dad joke and/or pun for almost every situation. Sometimes dealing with every day items or objects I see so I can spring something on one of my kids in a heartbeat or even pertaining to certain artists and/or songs. All are, admittedly, not very funny, but comedy is all about timing.\n\nThis was one of those times. A pun pertaining to a certain artist and how it backfired on me hard. Twice.\n\nSo we're all driving to Spokane listening to the radio along the way. It was on a '90s channel and some familiar chords came on. Black Velvet by Alannah Myles. A song I like, it's one I haven't heard in a while but, as always, I have a pun ready to go.\n\nMe: How many miles?\n\nMy wife: ...what?\n\nMe: How many miles?\n\nMy wife: How many miles until what?\n\nMe: ...Alannah Myles.\n\nMy wife: What are you talking about?\n\nMe: This song. Black Velvet by Alannah Myles.\n\nMy wife: ...this is Melissa Ethridge.\n\nAs it turns out, she was right. The radio was playing I'm the Only One by Melissa Ethridge. Both have a jazzy kinda feel to them, sung by women. All I heard was the first few notes and I totally got the song wrong.\n\nA cardinal sin if you're a radio DJ.\n\nI was teased for a the next little bit. My wife saying things like \"How many miles? Melissa Ethridge!\" as we all had a great laugh.\n\nThe kicker came back later that day. I stopped by a gas station and hopped back in the car. When I turned it on I was so preoccupied to make sure I had everything I needed and made sure I could exit safely that I wasn't even paying attention to the radio. That's when my wife noticed what was playing.\n\nMy wife: \"How many miles? Alannah Myles!\"\n\nYep, when we got back in the car the radio was playing Black Velvet. She stole my joke from me\n\nI was defeated. I was fuming I didn't have a chance to deliver the joke at the right time. I was too late this time. But I'll be ready for next time.\n\nMORE TO READ:\n\nMan Arrested After Scary Incident at Yakima Walmart\n\nYakama Nation Granted Derogatory Feature Name Change\n\nState Trooper Vehicle Struck Near Sunnyside, WA, Taken to Hospital\n\nDo You Know How to Pronounce These Awesome West Coast City Names?\n\nHighway Robbery: License Tabs Cost Way Too Much in Oregon.
