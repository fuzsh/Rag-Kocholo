        "text": "It’s baseball season and I was desperately searching for the end of what I thought was a quote commonly heard for years starting with: “Hear the crack of the bat and the smell of the __________________!” I could not exactly fill in the blank, thinking it was possibly grass, but doubting my own thought process.\n\nI did a Google search thinking I would find an exact quote and author for this “baseball-themed invitation” by plugging in the front end of the quote in the popular internet search engine. Soon, a myriad of word options filled my page, thus allowing me to complete the phrase—all courtesy of previously published articles and other content copy. These “olfactory offerings” ranged from grass, leather, pine tar, peanuts and crackerjacks, dirt, grilled hot dogs, and I even found “a freshly-poured beer.”\n\nHere in Frederick, our local team, the Keys, did not take the field in 2020 at neighboring Harry Grove Stadium at Nymeo Field due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It’s been a long, strange year for everything, but it was extremely odd to have more noise coming from the cemetery, on evenings last spring and summer, than hearing upcoming batter announcements, walk up music and the roar of the crowd after a hit or good play from our next-door neighbor.\n\nI am being a bit sarcastic as baseball returned to the location in the form of youth baseball late last summer and fall. Among these players, were two teenage kids of my own. I had the opportunity to see my sons Eddie and Vinnie play at Grove Stadium, and more regularly on their home diamond of Loats Field, as part of a team belonging to the Frederick City Babe Ruth Baseball league. This baseball field, along with a smaller little league field, are beyond Grove Stadium’s left field wall, and all three baseball venues are part of the City’s Parks & Rec Department Loat's complex located off Stadium Drive. They sit on the footprint of an old farm estate that once belonged to a gentleman named John Loats, buried here in Mount Olivet’s Area E. This former farmer-businessman's gravesite offers a commanding view of his former property.\n\nFrederick City Babe Ruth (13-15) hosting Taneytown at Grove Stadium (Sept 20, 2020)\n\nThe author's sons: Vinnie McGuinness C/OF (left) and Eddie Haugh P/INF (right)\n\nAnother fitting family plot within eye and ear shot of these fields is that of James Henry “Harry” Grove. The stadium’s namesake helped originally bring professional baseball to town a century ago, and his son later donated money towards the building of the Key’s stadium which opened in 1990. Mr. Grove is among those family members buried in a lot on the southeast corner of Area LL/Lot 210, and was the focus of one of these “Stories in Stone” back in 2018.\n\nWhen it comes to baseball history of our Frederick professional and semi—pro teams, I truly revere the work of longtime FNP sports editor/reporter Stan Goldberg, statistics and local athlete guru Sheldon Shealer, historian-author Bob Savitt of Middletown (who wrote The Blue Ridge League), and Mark Ziegler, a diligent student of baseball history and former Keys employee at the time our former Carolina League, Single A affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles came to town over three decades ago in the spring of 1989. All these guys have researched, written and spoken on Frederick’s baseball history dating back to the 19th century. Ziegler even created a website BlueRidgeLeague.org that I invite you to check out.\n\nInterestingly, Mark would go on to later work in the marketing department with the Great Frederick Fair. The fairgrounds located off East Patrick Street on the outskirts of town, was the site of Frederick’s first reputable baseball stadium, fittingly known as Agricultural Field—so-named due to its connection to the agricultural fair of course. Here is where the Frederick Hustlers played many a fabled game going back to their semi-professional days with the Sunset League and culminating with their introduction into the Blue Ridge League back in 1915.\n\nMark Ziegler found that the long-gone Agricultural Park field and grandstands would have been located here on the southwest corner of the fairground property.\n\nIn reference to baseball and this unique site, Mark found that the planning for the first organized baseball field here started in 1903, and by 1908, a wood stadium with a grandstand was built at the site for the semi-pro Sunset League. Trees were planted along East Patrick Street, in front of the Fairground property, and to the rear corner, surrounding the back of the grandstand area. There were organized leagues that played here with the Sunset League from 1908 to 1911, the semi-pro Tri-City League in 1914, and the Class D, Blue Ridge League from 1915 to 1923.\n\nWe’ve had three professional/semi-professional teams in our history: the Keys (1989-present), the Warriors (1929-30) and the HustIers (1915-1928). One field, and one field alone, hosted games featuring all three of these teams—and the ballpark’s namesake as laid to rest here in Mount Olivet like the early mentioned Mr. Grove. Of course, I’m talking about McCurdy Field located on the southwest side of town, at the intersection of Jefferson Street and the newly named Scottys Bus Lane. (AUTHOR’S NOTE: And for those that experienced Raymond Scott and his magical, brown, culinary bus, this was certainly a place where one could \"Hear the crack of the bat, and the smell of Scotty Dogs,” with the latter lingering in the air whether there was a game going on at the stadium or not!) ​\n\nIn early 1924, a fund-raising committee was formed with the mission to build a modern baseball park in Frederick as a significant upgrade from the existing Agricultural Field. The ”modern and up-to-date” facility, known then as Frederick County Athletic Field, opened just months later after a cost of $15,000. It boasted 1,300 grandstand seats and 1,200 bleacher seats, along with a ten-foot high fence running around a massive playing field. This spectacle of the time would eventually take the name of McCurdy Field.\n\nIn 1937, the NFL's Washington Redskins (just having relocated from Boston) needed a place to play their first exhibition, and played here. The Hustlers and Warriors professional team came and went, leaving a semi-professional version of the Frederick Hustlers.\n\n1941 Frederick Hustlers team in front of the McCurdy grandstand\n\n​In 1943 and 1944, the American League’s Philadelphia Athletics, under the immortal Connie Mack, held spring training here (due to the limits on travel during World War II).\n\nA rare surviving image from the March 25th, 1944 game between the Athletics and the Curtis Bay Coast Guard team played at McCurdy Field. Here, Philadelphia 1st baseman Dick Siebert slides safely into third in the bottom of the second inning. The A's won the game 8-3. The third baseman, #24, for the Coast Guard team was Gar Del Savio who briefly played for the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1943 season.\n\nFrederick News (April 6, 1944)\n\nLights were installed in 1947, and in 1968, the old wooden grandstand was condemned and torn down in 1971, leaving just the field, and a sub-par home for Frederick youth and amateur baseball. Deciding that this was now a poor site for baseball, local businessman Bob Marendt headed a campaign to renovate this park. He raised $50,000 in donations, and federal and state government kicked in the rest. A renovated concrete and steel park opened in 1974 with metal bleachers that sat 1,500 and clubhouse facilities. The park was the home of Frederick City Babe Ruth Baseball and was even reputable enough to host the Babe Ruth national organization’s World Series tournaments back in the early-mid1980s. Some of the best young baseball talent in the country came to Frederick in August, 1982 and played at McCurdy Field as part of the 13-year-old Babe Ruth World Series, hosted by the Frederick Babe Ruth League.\n\nThere were nine teams in the tournament including Frederick, which as the host city got an automatic bid. Teams came from as far away as California, Idaho and Arkansas. The tournament began on August 14th and ended a week later with Nashville, Tennessee, beating Brooklyn, NY, 6-1 for the national title. The tournament was a big success with a total of 42,290 fans attending the games.\n\nThis was one of three Babe Ruth World Series held here as the 13-15 championship tournament took place the following year with the host Frederick team reaching the semifinals. In 1984, the 16-18 tier World Series was played here at McCurdy Field.\n\nLess than five years later, the stage had been set for McCurdy to host an electric night in April, 1989 in which the Frederick Keys would play their very first home game here in Frederick. Fittingly it was against a minor league affiliate of the Cleveland Indians, from Kinston, North Carolina. The City of Frederick had successfully lured the Orioles Class A affiliate, the Hagerstown Suns, with the promise of a new stadium, but they would have to play one season here while Harry Grove Stadium was under construction.\n\n​\n\nIn studying the McCurdy Field of 1924, and the same of 1989, the place was in desperate need of “doctoring” or medical attention, so to speak. In ’24, this “doctoring” came in the literal form of a well-respected physician who headed up the drive for the stadium. His tenacity and ultimate success brought him the distinct honor of having his surname grace the stadium to this day, nearly a century later. As for the figurative meaning (of doctoring) in respect to McCurdy Field, Mark Ziegler and others can attest to the fact that it was a poor facility for minor league baseball nearly 70 years later (in 1989). There had to be a trailer brought in for the teams to dress, and folding chairs doubled for box seats. Regardless, the Keys drew well in their inaugural season, and that opening night was sold out. Currently this facility is used for American Legion and assorted other youth baseball.\n\nSo just who was this Dr. McCurdy, namesake of the stadium that has seen nearly a century of baseball here in Frederick? His name was Dr. Ira Jay McCurdy, born on New Years Day, 1869.\n\nDr. Ira Jay McCurdy\n\nFrederick News (Aug 3, 1942)\n\nI will submit one of the obituaries that ran in local papers at the time of this man’s death in 1942, seven months before the Philadelphia Athletics would train/play here in March, 1943. This obit comes from the Frederick Post’s August 4th, 1942 edition:\n\nOn Saturday night death claimed Dr. IRA J. McCURDY, one of Frederick's leading physicians, who has practiced here for about half a century. He was a skilled general practitioner and an excellent diagnostician. Hundreds of patients can testify to his ability and recall the valuable professional services he rendered throughout the years. His distinguished figure and serious manner inspired confidence in the sickroom. And he had a remarkable insight into human ailments and realized the scope of his medical aids and treatment. He was quick to recognize when specialized service, beyond his field, was necessary. This community can ill afford to lose a family doctor of his experience and ability, especially at a time when physicians due to war requirements are so greatly in demand.\n\nDr. McCurdy was a most useful citizen, beyond the realm of his medical practice. He was a man of strong convictions and great determination. Through his leadership, Frederick secured a modern milk ordinance, requiring pasteurization and supervision of this important product. He stood firmly for other important health measures for the city, and his strong influence was always for the protection of the health of the community.\n\nHe took an interest in other civic affairs and was prominent in the movement to place the city police force on high standards. He was the first liquor license commissioner for Frederick County and fearlessly blazed the path for rigid supervision of the sale of intoxicants.\n\nFor his diversion, Dr. McCurdy found pleasure and relaxation in sports. He was an ardent supporter of baseball for many years, and it is an appropriate tribute to his memory that the city's athletic park, in which he was so greatly interested, bears his name.\n\nThere you have it, the simple story of how a stadium and Frederick landmark got its name. But let’s find out a little more about this well-revered citizen whose gravesite is adorned with a tall obelisk and located in Area E only yards from that of John Loats (mentioned earlier). It, too, also affords a press-box level view of “the new stadium” that would supplant McCurdy Field as Frederick City’s top baseball venue.\n\nI submit to you a biography of our subject, published in 1910 as part of T.J.C. Williams’ History of Frederick County (Volume II).\n\nIra Jay McCurdy, M.D., one of the well-known and leading practitioners of Frederick City, is a native of York, Pa. He is a son of James Crawford and Jennie (Eyler) McCurdy. The McCurdy family is one of the oldest in Western Pennsylvania. The first of the name in this country were three brothers, James, John and Charles McCurdy, who were Scotch Covenanters.\n\nGeorge McCurdy, the grandfather of Dr. Ira J. McCurdy, was a native of Westmoreland County, Pa., in 1837, and died there in 1871. He was a farmer and was also engaged in the coal mining business. He was principal of a high school at Ligonier, in Westmoreland County, Pa. He served for the cause of the Union during the Civil war and made a very credible record. He was Captain of Company E, of the Eleventh Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, and was in active service for three years and three months. He was in the various campaigns in Virginia and participated in the many hard-fought battles. He took part in the battle of Fredericksburg, Va., where he was stricken with rheumatism, and was soon afterwards mustered out of service. After the expiration of his duties as a soldier, Captain McCurdy engaged in commercial pursuits, which he followed until his death. He was married to Jennie Eyler. They were the parents of one son, Ira J.\n\nIra J. McCurdy, son of Captain James Crawford and Jennie (Eyler) McCurdy, spent his childhood with his mother at Woodsboro, Md. He later entered New Windsor College, of Carroll County, Md., from which he graduated in 1889. He then went to New York, where he became a student in the Bellevue Hospital Medical College, from which institution he was graduated in the spring of 1892. Dr. McCurdy next took a special course in the New York Eye and Ear Hospital.\n\nFrederick News (Dec 5, 1892)\n\nIn the fall of 1892, he located in Frederick City, where he has since remained in active practice of his profession. Dr. McCurdy is well known and has acquired a large clientele. He has been very successful in the exacting field to which he was devoted himself. He is well liked by all who have come into contact with him.\n\nDr. McCurdy is surgeon for the Pennsylvania Railroad; for the Frederick Railroad, and the United Fire Engine Company of Frederick. In 1907, he was appointed city health officer of Frederick for a term of three years and reappointed in 1910. He was commissioned by Governor Crothers in July, 1910, as First Lieutenant Medical Corps, M.N.G., and was assigned to First Regiment Infantry, M.N.G.\n\nDr. McCurdy is a member of the Frederick County Medical Society, of which he is the First Vice-President; was Secretary for ten years; a member and on the Legislative Committee of the American Medical Association; and a member of the Medico Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland. Fraternally, Dr. McCurdy is a well-known Mason, being a member of Columbia Lodge, No. 58, A. F. and A. M., Enoch Royal Arch Chapter, No. 23, and Jacques de Molay Commandery, No. 4, Knights Templar, of Frederick, and holds position as Generalissimo. He also holds membership in the Buomi Temple of the Ancient Order of Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, of Baltimore City; in Frederick Lodge, No. 684, B.P.O.E., and Mountain City Lodge, No. 29, Knights of Pythias. Dr. McCurdy is also connected with the Frederick City Country Club and “Camp Le-Mid” Association, of Ontario, Can., a camping and fishing association. Politically, he is a Democrat. Dr. McCurdy has never married.\n\nUnidentified photograph in the Eisenauer collection of Heritage Frederick that may be a young Ira J. McCurdy\n\nAnother Heritage Frederick photo that may be Dr. McCurdy\n\n1880 US Census showing Ira living in Woodsboro with his mother and step-father George Devilbiss\n\nAs I stated, this biography dates to 1910. A little more information can be gleaned from an obituary found in the Carroll County Times (May 10th, 1946) of Dr. McCurdy’s mother, Jennie (Eyler) McCurdy Devilbiss who would remarry after the death of her first husband, James.\n\n​Mrs. Jennie McCurdy Devilbiss, widow of George Devilbiss, died at her home in Woodsboro on Sunday, May 5th, 1946. She was 97 years of age and had been stricken with paralysis. She was the daughter of the late Peter and Mary Engle Eyler of Frederick County and is survived by nieces and nephews, one of whom, Melvin J. Anders, made his home with her. Dr. Ira J. McCurdy, her son by her first marriage to Captain James McCurdy, predeceased his mother by four years.\n\n​\n\nDr. McCurdy was a popular student and athlete at New Windsor College class 1889. He enjoyed a busy and successful life in Frederick as a physician. Mrs. Devilbiss had been a life-long member of the Woodsboro Lutheran church and was also active in the Missionary Society of that church. The funeral was held from the late home in Woodsboro on Wednesday at 1:30 p. m. Rev. Herbert H. Schmidt officiated, assisted by Rev. R. S. Poffenberger. Interment was in Mt. Olivet Cemetery, Frederick. Powell and Martzler, funeral directors.\n\nAfter reading this, I immediately wondered if Dr. McCurdy was an accomplished ballplayer, himself—hence explaining a lifelong love of baseball? He played in his youth and made a fine showing in his New Windsor days as the school’s first baseman.\n\nWestminster Daily Advocate (May 4, 1889)\n\nI also found an article stating that Ira McCurdy stayed near the game in the capacity of umpiring.\n\nFrederick News (Nov 29, 1895)\n\nFrederick News (July 11, 1901)\n\nI also searched local newspapers of the late 1800s and first decade of the 1900s to learn a little more of the education and early career of Doc McCurdy.\n\nWestminster Democratic Advocate (March 1, 1884)\n\nFrederick News (May 4, 1887)\n\nWestminster Democratic Advocate (June 8, 1889)\n\nFrederick News (March 14, 1893)\n\nFrederick News (July 1, 1902)\n\n​I found Ira J. McCurdy living in a hotel on Frederick’s West Patrick Street in the 1910 US Census. I strongly feel that this was the Park Hotel, which formerly went by the name of the Carlin House, and Dill House earlier yet in the early 19th century. It should come as no surprise that a bachelor professional of the period would keep permanent residence in a hotel as large apartment complexes and luxury condos were not even dreamed about at that time.\n\n1910 US Census\n\n​Dr. McCurdy was a member of the Maryland National Guard. Countless newspaper mentions at the time speak to the respect his community had for him. One of the most insightful articles I read was a 1914 piece in which he gave tips to the citizenry on how to stay cool in summer.\n\nFrederick News (May 27, 1911)\n\nFrederick News (May 27, 1914)\n\nFrederick Citizen (Aug 21, 1914)\n\nFrederick Hustlers (1917)\n\nDr. McCurdy joined with associates Guy Motter and Frank Schmidt in starting the Frederick Baseball Association which gave Frederick its first professional team, the Hustlers in 1915. As mentioned earlier, they played at Agricultural Field against other clubs from Hagerstown, Martinsburg, Gettysburg, Chambersburg and Hanover.\n\nWell, the good doctor wouldn’t stay a bachelor into the next decade, marrying a Frederick native living in Baltimore at the time, but engaged in the medical profession, nonetheless. This occurred in the fall of 1918.\n\nThe Ligonier Echo (Nov 6, 1918)\n\nI marvel at the timing of this wedding, as the date was October 26th, 1918. For the previous year, Dr. McCurdy was a member of the local draft board evaluating local men for service in a World War. As for the wedding date of October 26th, it is quite significant as being in the middle of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive (Sept 28-Nov 11), the major, and final, part of the Allied offensive of World War I. But that isn’t what really surprised me. This date was at the height of the Spanish Flu pandemic that ravaged the country and county that particular fall. Dr. McCurdy’s profession as a physician was put to the test, now seeing something in a deadly flu virus that our doctors had never seen before. More than that, McCurdy held the pivotal role as Frederick City’s Health Inspector at the time—our local Dr. Fauci if you will.\n\nCatoctin Clarion (Oct 10, 1918)\n\nFrederick News (Oct 15, 1918)\n\nWell throughout this war-time period, you can imagine the impact on professional baseball and its players. Life eventually returned to normal the following year as the war was over, and the flu was gone. Sadly, many Frederick County lives were lost but McCurdy did his best to comfort loved ones of both war casualties and flu victims.\n\n1920 US Census showing Dr. and Mrs. McCurdy living in the first block of W. Patrick St\n\n​In the 1920 census, the McCurdys can be found living on West Church Street. They would have no children, Dr. McCurdy was 51 at this juncture and put energy into civic affairs and his professional endeavors instead of child rearing. Perhaps his fix was watching youth play baseball? Whatever the case, he was a leading force in elevating Frederick's first professional team in the Hustlers.\n\n1921 Hustlers team\n\nFrederick Post (Jan 24, 1924)\n\nFrederick News (May 14, 1924)\n\nWith the success of the stadium effort, many wanted to honor the local physician in some way. The local newspaper helped lead the way in promoting that the new baseball park should take Dr. McCurdy's name. This would become a reality for the 1925 season.\n\nFrederick News (May 20, 1925)\n\nDr. McCurdy was also a key player in forging a relationship with the Cleveland Indians of the Major League of baseball. Earlier in 1929, the Cleveland Indians purchased the Frederick Hustlers, and the new “farm” team changed its name to the Warriors to connect more with its parent team. On July 24th, 1929, a special exhibition game was played at McCurdy Field featuring the Warriors versus the Indians. The Indians won 11-5, but it marked a great day in which a big-time team came to town—one on which a local boy named Ray Gardner played. Imagine that happening today?\n\nFrederick News (April 30, 1929)\n\nFrederick News (Aug 29, 1929)\n\nDr. Ira McCurdy continued practicing medicine here, and stayed very active in both social and civic affairs. He took a special interest in the local police force based on some of the articles I read. He was still practicing at age 60 with an office at 32 North Court Street in town. This would place his office in the vicinity of the parking lot next to the present day M&T Bank location. However, back then this would have been a perfect location for a physician as it was the site of Frederick's original YMCA of which Dr. McCurdy was an avid supporter and proponent. He and Lucy lived a few blocks away at 5 S. Market. This was an apartment over the old F&M Bank (today's Colonial Jewelers on the Square Corner).\n\n#5 S. Market St on left served as a one-time home for the McCurdys\n\n1930 US Census showing the McCurdys\n\n​Our subject would continue on practicing through the Great Depression Era, and would live long enough to see the beginning of the Second World War, but not its conclusion. Sadly, his physical demise occurred as a result of complications a month after breaking his leg during a freak accident while walking down West Church Street. Ira J. McCurdy spent his final weeks in Frederick City Hospital, somewhat fitting for a man with such a rich medical background.\n\nFrederick News (July 3, 1942)\n\n​Dr. Ira Jay McCurdy never fully recovered from this accident. He died on August 2nd (1942) and was laid to rest on Area E/Lot 52. His funeral on August 4th was well attended as one would imagine. His faithful mother would join him here in 1946, and wife Lucy as well in 1958. The fine monument certainly marks the final resting place of one of Frederick’s men of mark.\n\nIn a quieter Frederick, at the time of his death and for a few decades after, I bet you could hear “the crack of the bat, and the pop of the ball” in the distance coming from his namesake field. It still may be possible today, but there are more competing sounds. Regardless, it’s not even a question that these sounds are once again heard now as the “boys of spring and summer” have again taken up residence on the fields to the immediate east of Mount Olivet.\n\nAerial view of Nymeo Field at harry Grove Stadium, Loats Field\n\nAs for McCurdy Field, it’s \"still in play\" and under the City of Frederick’s purview. I experienced a historical rush when our kids’ Frederick City Babe Ruth team played here last August against a Frederick Legion squad. That particular evening, I saw my boys hit, field and pitch on the same diamond used by former members of the Hustlers, Warriors and Keys, including visiting legends of the Blue Ridge League who went on to the big leagues like local product Ray Gardner and Hall of Famers Lefty Grove (Martinsburg), Hack Wilson (Martinsburg), and Eddie Plank (Gettysburg). Others such as Walter Johnson played in exhibition games here, while the immortal Connie Mack coached and managed here. Half a decade later, the Baltimore Orioles top draft pick in 1989, pitcher Ben MacDonald, made his professional debut here with the Keys. Mix in the fact that high schools, colleges and travel teams have played here too.\n\nFrederick City Babe Ruth vs American Legion 14-U game at McCurdy (Aug 15, 2020)\n\n​​That's just McCurdy's baseball legacy, as there’s been plenty of football played here too. I said earlier that the Washington Redskins played their first exhibition game here. This was followed by a myriad of games ranging from youth football to high school, and who can forget this venue as the home to the semi-pro Frederick Falcons?\n\nWe can thank old Doc McCurdy for \"prescribing\" the perfect medicine in the form of this athletic park for Frederick players and sport enthusiasts to enjoy over the last century. McCurdy Field is more than simply a \"Field of Dreams,\" it's a place of rich memories and Frederick history.\n\nHappy Easter 2021! It’s so amazing how fast time passes as it just seems like yesterday that I was acknowledging 2020’s Easter weekend. We were a few weeks into the initial Covid-19 virus quarantine, and under the impression that we would be attempting to help “flatten the curve” for two weeks. Oh my, if we only knew then what we know now. As the mandated quarantines were extended in most places, there still existed a hope that we would be able to attend Easter Sunday services in person. Now, most churches can’t congregate for the holiday serve a full year later!\n\nI kid you not when I say that I have had the Rolling Stones song “Time Waits for No One” in my head for the last few weeks, a song recorded 47 years ago in April of 1974—the same month my family moved to Frederick from Delaware. I’m not a big Stones fan, but this song has captivated me for a variety of reasons of late. A key one comes with reflecting back on the past year and all that should have been experienced, but wasn’t because of Covid-19—be them in-person church services, school graduation ceremonies, sporting events, weddings, concerts, annual events and in some cases, vacation trips and even family holiday get-togethers.\n\nAnother attraction to this song came as a result of me finding myself killing off quarantine time for half of March, 2021 after being diagnosed positive for the coronavirus. Luckily, my symptoms were mild, but the time warp was very strange as I had to stay in the basement away from the rest of my family. Fourteen days went slow as a whole as I was disappointed about missing things in the outside world. Oddly, the days seemed like the movie “Groundhog Day”—monotonous, but seemingly fast moving. It was one of the strangest, paradoxical situations I’ve ever experienced. All in all, I was blessed to make it through unscathed and fully recovered, as compared to many others who have not had as easy a road over the last year, including an old friend of mine from high school (Mike Hernick) who passed a few nights ago as a complete and utter surprise.\n\nYou could say that we had a year of lent, sacrificing and giving up things much more critical than the candy and soda I recall bypassing for 40 days in my youth. This current culmination of the Lenten season has been a time to reflect on loss and resurrection, not only as it pertains to Christian religion and Biblical history, but on the time of Covid-19, and hopefully soon, a time without.\n\nWhen leaving the cemetery on Good Friday last year, I distinctly took notice of a monument I passed every workday, but had never investigated and taken in fully. This same monument is the one you see above as the header of this week’s “Story in Stone.” On that evening of April 10th (2020), I was compelled to stop and take a picture with my I-phone, one that would fittingly, featuring a cross-bearer. As I took my shot while looking in a westerly direction, the clouds had parted in the distance, showing a burst of sunshine. This was around dusk.\n\n​I was suddenly reminded of the beautiful oil painting of Calvary behind the alter in St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church here in Frederick—the congregation of my youth. Calvary is the hill outside Jerusalem which is traditionally held to be the location of the crucifixion of Jesus. ​\n\nFrederick's St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church features a painting of the Crucifixion by Pietro Gagliardi, which was added in 1843. The church's high altar is constructed of Egyptian and Italian marble.\n\nSo who was the recipient of this wondefully scenic, and Bible-friendly, final monument you may ask?\n\nDe Witt C. Keller\n\nWe are compelled to believe that the owner of this outstanding monument in Area G/Lot 31 was a person of faith. I found him to be Dr. De Witt C. Keller, a druggist by trade, who once ran what we would call pharmacies in southwestern Indiana in the mid nineteenth-century.\n\n​\n\nDe Witt Clinton Keller was born April 28th, 1828 in Frederick. He was the son of Frederick Keller (1790-1832) and Catherine Hughes (1799-1835), and named for De Witt Clinton (1769-1828), an American politician and naturalist who served as a United States Senator, Mayor of New York City, and as the sixth Governor of New York. Our “Frederick County De Witt Clinton” grew up near the old Jug Bridge over the Monocacy. His father (Frederick Keller) built the house that we referred to as the Bremerman/Waters house in our former story on Civil War general (and inspiration for the movie Glory) Robert Gould Shaw. Shaw actually spent time in this exact house, at one time located on the eastern approach to Jug Bridge. This was in winter of 1862 as the Union soldier from Massachusetts had drawn the assignment of guard duty here at the very strategic water crossing.\n\nhttp://www.mountolivethistory.com/stories-in-stone-blog/fredericks-glory-part-i\n\n1858 Bond Map showing property of F. W. Bremerman (later to be the house visited by Robert Gould Shaw in December, 1861)\n\nDeWitt’s mother, Catherine, apparently operated a tavern, either here or across the river on her father’s property, after her husband’s death in 1832. Frederick Keller also owned a larger piece of property on the west side of Linganore Road, midway between Linganore Creek and Gas House Pike, one that likely belonged to his parents originally. DeWitt grew up in a time that would see transportation explode as the National Pike passed by his front door, and the railroad and canal would reach Frederick County in the early 1830s.\n\nSadly, De Witt’s mother passed away on Sept. 25th, 1835. She died intestate and Chancery court proceedings followed in which her land would be sold off. At that time, the four children of Mrs. Keller were still minors, and Mathias Bartgis of Frederick was appointed their guardian. De Witt was just seven years old at the time and I assume he attended local schools. I found that he lived in the vicinity of Court House Square with the Bartgis family, so I assume he attended the Frederick Academy. He would work as a tobacconist and later a druggist, but I'm not sure when or where he received his training.\n\nThe first newspaper reference to Mr. Keller comes in the form of a newspaper article from 1848 in the Baltimore Sun recounting a recent parade held in Frederick by representatives of the Whig political party. De Witt C. Keller, only 20 years-old at the time, was mentioned as an assistant marshal in this event that celebrated the recent presidential victory run of Zachary Taylor and his vice presidential running mate, Millard Fillmore.\n\nBaltimore Sun (Nov 25, 1948)\n\n1850 US Census showing De Witt C. Keller living with the Bartgis family who raised him after his mother's death. Note that his stepbrother was former Frederick mayor, James Bartgis. Also of interest is Keller's occupation as a tobacconist.\n\nFrederick diarist Jacob Engelbrecht mentioned DeWitt C. Keller a number of times in his fabled work, however the journal entry of most interest to me occurred on May 2nd, 1850:\n\n“Mssrs. Doctor Charles Boyd, Doctor Fairfax Schley & John R. Baltzell, Esquire leave our town this forenoon in the western cars, the former to locate in Texas and the 2 latter to seek a location in one of the western states. Dewitt Clinton Keller left town yesterday and will join them at Cumberland & proceed with them for Iowa or Minnesota. Success attend them.”\n\nIn early 1851, De Witt C. Keller is found partnering with a gentleman named Farnsley and operating a wholesale drugstore which also sold an array of items that CVS and Walgreen stores are not known for today.\n\nDaily Evansville (Indiana) Journal (April 19, 1851)\n\n​Mr. Keller was becoming active in Evansville’s civic and business affairs as well.\n\nDaily Evansville Journal (Aug 7, 1852)\n\n​​Keller’s sojourn west paid off personally as much as it did professionally. De Witt married Marcia Ellen Carpenter, a native of Indiana on December 10th, 1857.\n\nMarcia Ellen (Carpenter) Keller\n\nMs. Carpenter’s father was a highly successful man in Evansville, (Vanderburgh County). Willard Carpenter was one of Evansville's leading citizens and greatest entrepreneurs. He made his fortune in real estate, was a member of the city council, and built one of the town's first railroads. And speaking of railroads, Mr. Carpenter was an abolitionist and participant on the Underground Railroad by using his home to harbor slaves escaping to their freedom. He would build Willard Library which is still in operation today. The Carpenter family home also still exists and is used by WNIN, the local PBS station.\n\nInterior of Willard Library\n\nCarpenter family home at 405 Carpenter Street\n\nThe Willard Library\n\n​As you can see, De Witt married into money. Based on census records and some other news clippings, it seems that the couple lived between Frederick and Evansville for the majority of their marriage, one in which they would raise the following children: Elizabeth Carpenter Keller (1858-1915), Willard Clinton Keller (1861-1903) and Mary Louise Keller (1863-1944).\n\n1860 US Census showing Keller family living in Evansville, Indiana\n\nI found a couple references on Ancestry.com that said that Mr. Keller served in the American Civil War. I don’t believe this to be true as there was another gentleman here in town by the name of Clinton Keller who served in Company E of the 7th Regiment of Maryland Volunteers under Col. Edwin H. Webster. This group of soldiers was mustered into service on August 26th, 1862. Now I’m not ruling this out completely as here is a bit about that military outfit.\n\nA history of the 7th Maryland reports the following of the regiment’s activity:\n\nAfter serving guard duty in the defenses of Washington, the regiment was sent to the Shenandoah Valley for operations. Their first combat came on March 13, 1863, when they repulsed a charge by the 5th Virginia Infantry regiment. They were sent to V Corps, Army of the Potomac. At the Battle of Gettysburg, they were forced to withdraw from the Peach Orchard early on the second day. They were among the units who repelled Pickett's charge. The unit was stationed for garrison duty in southern Pennsylvania and was involved in skirmishes against some of Jubal Early's infantry units. Because of heavy losses at the Battle of Cold Harbor, they were sent as replacements to IV corps, Army of the Potomac. They suffered heavy casualties during the Siege of Petersburg, having to repel six charges by counterattacking units of the 15th Georgia Volunteer Infantry. They marched in the Grand review and were mustered out of service on June 3, 1865.\n\nThis unit suffered the loss of 389 men, who were 23 officers and 366 enlisted men, and 65 of those men died of disease. 13 men were captured at Gettysburg, 5 of which perished at Libby Prison. Unit was noted by President Lincoln for being \"very effective in combat and showing utmost loyalty to the cause of the great republic.\"\n\nFrederick, MD at the time of the Civil war by military artist Charles Johnson\n\nOne of the reasons why I dispute this theory is the fact that De Witt seemed to be quite busy in Evansville, having had a change of partners from Mr. Farnsley a decade earlier. It also would make sense to get his family out of Frederick, a place whose residents certainly saw more than their share of rival armies traveling and battling through the county, not to mention viewing the carnage of war as we became a hospital center.\n\n​\n\nPost war, more articles are found within Indiana newspapers of Mr. Keller’s land and real estate transactions.\n\nDaily Evanston Journal(June 12, 1863)\n\nDaily Evansville Journal (Aug 14, 1867)\n\nEvansville Daily Journal (May 18, 1869)\n\nEvansville's wharf and riverfront area\n\nEvansville's wharf and riverfront area\n\nDe Witt Keller and family in the 1870 US Census living in Evansville\n\nA city directory for Evansville from 1876 states that Dr. Keller’s residence was outside Frederick, MD, however he was continuing to partner in business with Isaac T. White in the firm located in Evansville and called Keller & White. The directory lists this operation as “Wholesale Druggists and dealers in Paints, Varnishes, Dye Stuffs, &c.” It was located on Main Street. I began wondering what the real reason behind the move back to Maryland was after I found an article involving a lawsuit between Dr. Keller and his father-in-law from fall of 1872.\n\nEvansville Daily Journal (Oct 19, 1872)\n\n​According to later obituaries, Dr. Keller apparently relocated back to Frederick primarily due to poor health. Marcia Keller, however, predeceased him, dying in 1879 and was buried here in Mount Olivet. He had apparently made his fortune, of course aided by his wife’s father and an inheritance to boot, in Indiana, as his estate was reportedly worth $200,000.\n\n1880 US Census showing Keller and two children living in Frederick\n\n​Interestingly, the widowed pharmacist can be found as head of household living in Frederick in a rented home, as he would not buy property on his return to Frederick. Based on the 1880 census and who his neighbors were, he is believed to have lived on that block of West Patrick Street where the courthouse stands now. My assistant Marilyn Veek found that Mr. Keller’s daughter, Mary Louise (1863-1944), apparently married the “boy next door,” a gentleman named Francis/Frank Markell (1863-1944). Mary’s older sister, Lizzie, would marry local lawyer William W. Wilcoxon.\n\n​Marcia would be buried in Mount Olivet in a family plot that Dr. Keller had purchased six years earlier in 1873 as he would arrange to have his parents buried here. His father, Frederick, died in 1832 and was buried in the town’s Baptist graveyard which no longer exists today. It was located on West All Saints Street, on the north side of the thoroughfare, and adjacent Carroll Creek. Frederick’s wife, Catherine died in 1835 and was buried in the All Saints Graveyard, located a few blocks to the east on East All Saints Street. As a side note, the former Ms. Hughes was a daughter of Levi Hughes of whom Hughes Ford was named who once owned considerable real estate west of the Monocacy River stretching from the airport to MD route 144 as I-70 bisects it.\n\n​\n\nWhile De Witt was engaged in moving his parents, he would have his paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Stallings Keller (1772-1831) and later, grandfather Conrad Keller (1765-1821) also brought from the ancient Baptist burying ground. The 4 transplanted bodies are buried in a row with a fine ledger/tablet style stone laid atop their final resting places.\n\nDr. Keller had cheated death a few years before his wife. Marilyn Veek found that in the category of \"all these Frederick “Stories in Stone” seemed at times to be linked somehow\" comes the fact that Dr. Keller was on the train involved in the terrible Point of Rocks crash in 1877, which took the lives of five local residents. You can read this one later, but here is a link to my earlier story written in June, 2018.\n\nhttp://www.mountolivethistory.com/stories-in-stone-blog/the-accident-at-point-of-rocks\n\nThe following newspaper account features a statement from our subject.\n\nBaltimore Sun (June 18, 1877)\n\n​De Witt would eventually meet his maker on October 24th, 1882.\n\nWestminster Democrat (Oct 28, 1882)\n\nI don’t know exactly the date of this fine marker but it was either erected by Dr. Keller or son Willard who is also buried here with his wife, Nettie Gambrill and a two year-old son, Willard, Jr. (1895-1897). Willard had made a career out of building things, and had his own cement paving business.\n\n​\n\nWillard Keller was one of the partners in the South Park Villa Company, which developed Clarke Place located a block from our front gate. It was also Willard who purchased the Loats Female Asylum property for the development. He was the secretary and general manager of the company, while Dr. Joseph Williamson was president and Harry Bowers was VP/treasurer.\n\nMarilyn learned that although the property was outside the Frederick city limits at the time, the company signed an agreement with the mayor and Alderman in which they would be exempt from city/municipal taxes for 10 years if the property was annexed (an annexation would benefit the city in terms of revenue and taxes) and that the city would pay for/buy the private street the company planned to build (which became Clarke Place). This agreement was later sanctioned by the state legislature. Willard's home was at what is now 16 Clarke Place. He did not own property in Frederick prior to that.\n\n16 Clarke place, home of Willard C. Keller\n\nNettie Keller was the daughter of miller James H. Gambrill, (builder of the Delaplaine Center) and brother of park namesake James H. Gambrill, Jr. She grew up in her parent's mansion home within the confines of today's Monocacy Battlefield property on the east side of the namesake river.\n\nIt appears that Nettie was somehow incapacitated late in life, as when Willard sold the house in 1903 she was identified as \"temporarily in Baltimore\", and in an equity case in 1905, when certain of the lots were sold by the company to Harry Bowers to settle Willard's estate, the grantors were a \"committee\" consisting of Mary Markell trustee for the benefit of Nettie G. Keller, Mary and Francis Markell, and James Gambrill. In the 1910 census, Nettie was enumerated at Relay Sanitarium/St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore county.\n\nBaltimore Sun (Aug 29, 1903)\n\nDe Witt C. Keller’s two daughters married and lived out their lives here in Frederick and both are buried here at Mount Olivet. Elizabeth Carpenter (Keller) Wilcoxon passed in 1915 and is buried nearby her parents in Area G. Mary Louise (Keller) Markell lived up through 1944 and her gravesite can be found in Area R.\n\n​I found a few newspaper articles which say that Mrs. Markell sent portraits of her parents and maternal grandparents to the Willard Library back in Evanston in 1944.\n\nThese portraits are attributed to artist James Thomas Poindexter. The subjects include library founder Willard Carpenter and wife Lucina B. Carpenter to the left, and Marcia E. Carpenter Keller and De Witt C. Keller on the right.\n\n​One final soul rests here in Area G/Lot 31. This is Margaret Doyle, who we found to be a domestic servant of the family. She hailed from Ireland and lived with the family in Indiana, before coming to Frederick.\n\nWillard Carpenter\n\nLucina B. Carpenter\n\nBetter known as Maggie, her grave monument fits perfectly with our Easter theme. With all the research performed for this story, I never did find the exact religious denomination of Dr. De Witt Clinton Keller.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Hood College intern Katelyn Klukosky who did a great job gathering resources for me to put this story together in short order. Also thanks to Stan Schmidt and Greg Hager of the Willard Library in Evansville, Indiana for sharing images of the Keller and Carpenter families from portraits belonging to the library collection.\n\nAs some of our readers of this blog know, I’ve been known to switch gears abruptly with these historical forays into those buried here in Mount Olivet. In this “Story in Stone,” I’m prepared to connect the dots between one of our country’s first presidents, a handful of his descendants and a very unique, first-generation immigrant laid to rest here in our fair “garden cemetery.” On this latter point, I can attest that we have immigrants galore buried here, but this particular individual really made an impression on me as I just “discovered” her here this past week after receiving a lead from my friend Theresa “Treta” Mathias Michel.\n\nMany are able to rattle off the names of our first three presidents in Washington, Adams and Jefferson—two having known relatives and/or “in-laws” here, and in one case, the other has a potential (and extremely interesting descendant) buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery. I haven’t made a direct connection to fourth president James Madison quite yet, but have documented a handful of descendants of James Monroe, our fifth president and veteran of the Revolutionary War.\n\nAs for Mr. Monroe, many confuse him with James Madison because of the same first name and a last name starting with “M.” There’s also, of course, that Virginia connection. In fact, Monroe served as President Madison’s Secretary of War during the War of 1812, the conflict that helped Francis Scott Key’s resume exponentially.\n\n​\n\nJames Monroe left college in 1776 to participate in the American Revolution. In late December, 1776, Monroe crossed the Delaware River with Gen. George Washington and took part in a surprise attack on a Hessian encampment at the Battle of Trenton (New Jersey). Though the attack was successful, Monroe suffered a severed artery in the battle and nearly died. In the aftermath, Washington cited Monroe for his bravery, and promoted him to captain.\n\nAn 18 year-old James Monroe is pictured holding the flag behind Washington in Emanuel Leutze's immortal \"Washington Crossing the Delaware\" painted in 1851.\n\nOn February 16th, 1786, Monroe married a woman he had first met while serving in the Continental Congress, Elizabeth Kortright (1768–1830) of New York City. They moved to Virginia, eventually settling in Charlottesville in 1789, after buying an estate known as Ash Lawn–Highland. The Monroes had three children, the first of whom was Eliza Monroe Hay (1786-1840). In 1808, she married George Hay, a prominent Virginia attorney who had served as prosecutor in the trial of Aaron Burr and later as a US District judge.\n\nThe second Monroe child, James Spence Monroe, was born in 1799 and died sixteen months later in 1800. The third product of this union was Maria Hester Monroe (1804–1850) and she is of particular interest to our story. Maria married her first-cousin, Samuel Laurence Gouverneur, on March 8th, 1820, in the East Room of the White House, the first president's child to marry here.\n\nMaria Hester Monroe\n\nSamuel L. Gouverneur, Sr\n\nGouverneur served as a member of the New York State Legislature and also as a private secretary to his uncle/father-in-law President James Monroe who would serve two consecutive terms as president from March 4th, 1817 until March 4th, 1825. The Gouverneurs eventually moved from Washington, DC back to New York, specifically Manhattan. Together, Samuel and Maria were the parents of three children: James Monroe Gouverneur (1822–1885), a deaf-mute who died at the Spring Grove Asylum in Baltimore, Maryland; Elizabeth Kortright Gouverneur (1824–1868), who married three times (Dr. Henry Lee Heishell, James M. Bibby, and Colonel G. D. Sparrier); and Samuel Laurence Gouverneur, Jr. (1826–1880)—more on him in a moment.\n\nOak Hill Plantation\n\nPresident Monroe’s wife (Elizabeth) died in 1830 at Monroe’s plantation called Oak Hill, located roughly nine miles south of Leesburg, VA near present-day Aldie. James Monroe would then head to New York and live with the Gouverneurs until his own death in 1831 a year later.\n\nNew York Post obituary (July 5, 1831)\n\nJames Monroe's gravesite in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond (VA)\n\nBoth Samuel L. Gouverneur, Sr. and Samuel, Jr. would move to Frederick County, where they lived out their lives and are buried here. On June 20th, 1850, Monroe’s daughter Maria Gouverneur died at the same Oak Hill estate where her mother had passed two decades earlier. In September, 1851, widower Samuel Gouverneur, Sr. married Mary Digges Lee (1810–1898), a granddaughter of former Maryland governor Thomas Sim Lee (1745–1819). They retired to the Lee estate called \"Needwood Forrest\", located just south of Burkittsville. Mr. Gouverneur died in 1865 and is buried in Petersville's St. Mark's Episcopal Cemetery\n\nNeedwood, one-time home of S. L. Gouverneur, Sr\n\nSt. Mark's, Petersville (MD)\n\nPresident Monroe’s grandson, Samuel Jr., would eventually move to Frederick where he lived in a recognizable former estate west of town in the early 1860s. The property has operated as a modern-day apartment complex for nearly 40 years now. As for Mr. Gouverneur, Jr., he is buried here in Mount Olivet in Area G/Lot 118.\n\nSamuel Gouverneur, Jr. was born in New York City and eventually served as a Lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery Regiment during the Mexican War and was present at the capture of Mexico City and the National Palace. In 1847, he was promoted to 1st Lieutenant for his bravery at the battles of Contreras and Churubusco.\n\nMarian (Campbell) Gouverneur\n\nAfter the war, Gouverneur married Miss Marian Campbell of New York in 1855, and fathered three daughters. His first two children, Maud (b. 1857) and Ruth (b. 1858), were born in Washington, DC. Mr. Gouverneur soon became the first United States consul in Fuzhou (pronounced and once spelled as Foo Chow), China, during the administration of President Franklin Buchanan.\n\nChinese port at Fuzhou (ca. 1860)\n\nUS Consulate in Fuzhou (late 1880s)\n\nFuzhou, China\n\nWhile abroad, a third daughter, named Rose de Chine Gouverneur, was born in 1860. Her name would forever bear witness to her foreign birthplace. The family would be here until 1863, at which point Mr. Gouverneur requested a return to the US because the semi-tropical climate of Fuzhou did not agree with his health. He supposedly was in a weakened state as a result of time spent during the Mexican War. Mrs. Gouverneur and her daughters returned to the United States first, and Samuel came a few months later. Special care had to be taken because the American Civil War was in full tilt, and the family had to return on ships sailing under British flags so as not to be harassed by Confederate ships.\n\nThe family would reside back in Washington, DC, but the story goes that the couple became particularly impressed with Frederick County while visiting Phillip F. Thomas, a friend of Mr. Gouverneur who lived about two miles west of Frederick City. This was late 1863, and the family soon took up residence at a plantation named Waverley, featuring a spacious Georgian manor house that had been constructed in 1776. Of course, you may know this structure now as the community center and namesake of the development known as “The Residences at the Manor,” located at the intersection of today’s Key Parkway and Willowdale Drive. The former outlying grounds to the west of the house comprise Waverley Gardens, developed in the 1970s.\n\nThe former home of the Gouverneur family west of Frederick (courtesy of \"The Residences at the Manor\" website)\n\nMarian Gouverneur published a book in 1911, and wrote of her time at “the Manor,” especially interesting during the Civil War. I found a clipping in the Frederick Post written by social column author Elsie Haines White (also a Mount Olivet resident) from February 7th, 1964 which adds a bit of color to the habitation of the Gouverneurs here at that time.\n\nFrederick Post (Feb 7, 1964)\n\nI found Mrs. Gouverneur’s chapter on China very interesting as well in which she talks about the Chinese culture and, in addition, the opium and slave trades, religious missionary work and typhoons including one that destroyed a portion of the consulate. Here is a link to Marian Gouverneur’s book (entitled As I Remember) found on the Library of Congress’s website: https://www.loc.gov/resource/lhbcb.24385/?sp=1\n\nAs I said, of particular interest are chapters on the family’s time in China (pg. 314-338) and in Frederick (pg. 339-362).\n\nThe Gouverneurs perhaps may have wished at times that they had stayed in China a little longer as Frederick was not the best place to be in 1864. That summer, Gen. Jubal Early and his rebels would ransom Frederick for $200,000, and the Battle of Monocacy would be fought just south of town and within earshot of the Gouverneur’s farm. Closer to home for the family and their Po-ne-sang plantation at this time (July, 1864), the Union Army camped nearby and made visits before retreating as the larger Confederate Army passed right by the Gouverneur’s place, with various visits from officers. The concern over looting and absconding with either farm servants or horses or both was a chief threat, and a documented skirmish was fought a short distance away near Linden Hills. The family made a hasty retreat to their basement after hiding said servants and horses in advance of the Confederate Army’s arrival in early July, leaving the plantation dependent upon the services of one, lone, Chinese maid.\n\nA page from Marian Gouverneur's memoirs \"As I Remember\"\n\nI had heard a bit about this family servant, but had no name. Mrs. Treta Michel said that there was an interesting story pertaining to this young woman brought back to the United States by the Gouverneur family. Mrs. Michel went on to tell me that she recalled someone telling her that this Chinese domestic was buried in Mount Olivet. This truly piqued my interest, but I had no name. I checked the Gouverneur family lot in Area G within our computer records, but she wasn’t there.\n\nTo my amazement, luck was soon on my side, as I truly found this proverbial “needle in the haystack” while on a walk in the cemetery last week. In Area T, my eye miraculously caught a prominent gravestone with the name Sara Leleng on its face. The verbiage carved along with a death date of October 18th, 1917 said that the decedent was a native of Amoy, China. Once back in the office, I found census records with Miss Leleng living with the family.\n\n1870 US Census showing Gouverneur family living in Frederick with their domestic \"Lelenge\"\n\nMore on Sarah Leleng in a moment as I want to wrap up the Gouverneur family here in Frederick. After the war, a decision was made to simply use \"Po-ne-sang” as a summer residence to escape the oppressive heat of Washington, DC. This lasted one year before the family decided to move into Frederick City because in Mrs. Gouverneur’s words: “He (her husband) knew nothing of farming, and I knew nothing of cooking.” She proclaimed her desire to live in a more civil and social setting for her talents, and was glad to have the assistance of her Chinese maid to assist with cooking and caring for her daughters. The society life better fit the Gouverneurs, and believe it or not, Frederick had a definitive social scene at that time.\n\nGouverneur sisters (L-R Maud, Rose and Ruth)\n\nApparently, the Gouverneur children attended the Frederick Female Seminary, site of Winchester Hall, today’s seat of county government. In 1870, Samuel Gouverneur, Jr. decided to publish his own newspaper, having been inspired by the presidential campaign of Horace Greeley, who would visit him here in town in October of 1871. Mr. Greeley had been invited to give the agricultural address at the annual Frederick Fair that year. The Maryland Herald newspaper had been started as an independent offering with the catchphrase: ”Independent in all things-neutral in nothing.” Gouverneur’s paper endorsed the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 and supported Mr. Greeley in his bid for the presidency. After Greeley’s defeat to incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, Mr. Gouverneur ceased publishing his paper.\n\nThe following year, the family returned to Washington, DC permanently, taking up residence on Corcoran Street near 14th Street.\n\n1414 Corcoran St, home to the Gouverneur family in NW Washington, DC\n\nMr. Gouverneur does not appear in the 1880 census as he died on April 5th, 1880 in Washington. His body would be brought to his former adopted home of Frederick, and laid to rest in Mount Olivet not far from soldiers lost during the late war.\n\n1880 US Census showing Marian Gouverneur and family living in Washington, DC\n\n​Mrs. Gouverneur played a role in Washington Society with her daughters. She also lived with Maud and Rose up through her death.\n\nNew York Times (March 14, 1914)\n\nThe New York native and author would die on March 12th, 1914 and was brought back to Frederick to be buried next to her husband in Area G.\n\n​\n\nRose Gouverneur Hoes is worthy of a separate article which I have planned to write. She died on May 26th, 1933 and is buried here with her parents and her son, Roswell Randall Hoes, Jr. (1891-1901), who died in childhood.\n\nMaud Campbell Gouverneur never married and lived to the ripe old age of 90, passing on March 29th, 1947.\n\nFrederick News (April 1, 1947)\n\nThe final daughter of Samuel and Marian Gouverneur, Ruth Monroe, married a local Frederick gentleman with deep roots here, Dr. Thomas Crawford Johnson (1856-1943). Dr. Johnson served as a physician to the School for the Deaf, the Home for the Aged and the All Saints’ Orphanage. The family lived at 111 Record Street, the former home of Dr. William Tyler. Ruth was a founding member of the Frederick Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution in September, 1892. She died here in this house on February 28th, 1949.\n\nFrederick Post (Feb 28, 1949)\n\nThe graves of Dr. and Ruth G. Crawford in Area E/Lot 64\n\nOf all these individuals, I am uniquely interested in the earlier mentioned Sarah Leleng, I told you about. Sarah was a domestic servant brought back to the United States by the Gouverneurs. Her name is somewhat of a mystery as she is referred to as Le Leng in the 1880 census and Sarah Gouverneur a decade earlier. I could not find her in the 1900 and 1910 census records, but I did find a laundress named Lee Leng in 1900 in Washington, however the record says this is a male. I wonder about this as the profession of laundress denotes a female and the date of birth seems reasonable at 1849? Regardless, I wish I had been able to find Sarah in the 1910 census, but she appears not to be living with any Gouverneur family members.\n\n​\n\nAs I said earlier, I found Sarah’s gravesite and date of death of October 18th, 1917. She is buried here in Area T/Lot 44. Our records confirmed that she was unmarried and passed at age 73, making her birthday around 1844 showing that some of the census records have her age incorrect, a common mistake of the time.\n\n​Sarah Leleng died of carcinoma and our records show that she was working as a domestic at the time of death. Her gravesite was purchased by her estate at the time of death. Most interesting are the obituaries that appeared in the Washington and Frederick papers. Of special note, she is proclaimed as being the first Chinese woman to come to the US. Secondly, she had amassed a good fortune over her lifetime.\n\nWashington Evening Herald (Oct 20, 1917)\n\nFrederick Post (Oct 22, 1917)\n\nWashington Herald (Oct 20, 1917)\n\n​In her will, Sarah had made provisions to send most of her fortune back to her hometown in China in order to construct a mission chapel under the auspices of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Of greater connection to Frederick is the fact that Sarah wanted this to be done to honor former Frederick native James Addison Ingle.\n\nRev. Ingle was a friend of the family, the son of the beloved Osborn Ingle (1837-1909), longtime minister of Frederick’s All Saints’ Protestant Episcopal Church. I wrote a piece a few years back chronicling the tragedy the reverend suffered as he would lose his wife and seven children between 1881-1883. His residence at the time was the All Saints Rectory located at 113 Record Street and next door to Dr. William Crawford Johnson and wife Ruth Gouverneur Johnson. The reverend would live here for more than four decades.\n\n111 and 113 Record Street in Frederick\n\nBishop Ingle (center)\n\n​Sadly, Rev. Ingle died less than a year later on December 7th, 1903, and was buried in the Old International Cemetery in Hankow. This was the original foreign cemetery used by the cities of Hankow (west bank of Yangtze north of Hanshui River), Wuchang (east bank), and Hanyang (south of Hanshui River). The three cities were later merged and renamed Wuhan. The cemetery was removed in the early 20th century but the whereabouts of Rev. Ingle's remains are unknown.\n\nRt. Rev. Logan Herbert Roots succeeded Ingle as bishop of Hankow. A memorial service was held in his honor at Emmanuel Church, Baltimore, during which Rev. Arthur M. Sherman mentioned Rev. Ingles' dedication to building a native church, and his efforts after the Boxer Rebellion. His Frederick, Maryland parish donated funds to establish a scholarship at the Boone Divinity School in China in his memory, which was mentioned at the All Saints’ Day services in both his parishes.\n\nLast will and testament of Sarah Leleng\n\nWashington Post (May 8, 1918)\n\nDid Miss Sarah Leleng’s gift make possible a new chapel which stands today? Or did it go towards something at Boone College as did the contribution from All Saints' Church here in Frederick? I have searched quite a bit but can't find anything definitive. However, an Episcopal mission church was erected in Wuhan in 1918 and named St. Michael's. Could Miss Leleng's money gone toward this project?\n\nI found this reference online within a volume of reports pertaining to the Board of Missions.\n\nThe Spirit of Missions (Vol. 85 Jan 1920) by the Board of Missions\n\nWhatever the case, I have another interesting piece of Mount Olivet trivia in the fact that we are the final resting place of the first Chinese woman to be admitted to the United States. I am also very confident in theorizing that she is also the first Asian-American buried in Frederick, definitively Mount Olivet. Who would have known— thanks for the tip Ms. Michel.\n\nWell, it’s just one of those stories that you have to try figuring out by working backwards in time. The decedent is one, Frank Brunner Rhodes, buried in Mount Olivet’s Area H/Lot 217 on October 10th, 1941.\n\n​I quickly learned that the funeral occurred nearly seven weeks after Mr. Rhodes death on August 22nd. At the time he was 75 years old, and living in Providence, Rhode Island, his home for a number of years. I still don’t understand the cause of delay for his burial here in Frederick months later, as I saw stated that funeral services were held in Rhode Island a few days after his death. Regardless, there was no sense of urgency to bury the body as I found Mr. Rhodes to be an early example of a cremains burial here at Mount Olivet.\n\nFrank’s obituary appeared in the local Frederick paper that August, and sheds light on a man who had quite a theatrical life as a successful star of vaudeville.\n\nFrederick News (Aug 22, 1941)\n\nBecause I like to go the extra yard for educational purposes with this blog, namingly educating myself just as much as the reader, I wanted to understand better the calling that characterized Frank B. Rhodes’ life—that of vaudeville.\n\nVaudeville is a theatrical genre of variety entertainment born in France at the end of the 19th century. A “vaudeville” was originally a comedy without psychological or moral intentions, based on a comical situation: a dramatic composition or light poetry, interspersed with songs or ballets. It became popular in the United States and Canada from the early 1880s until the early 1930s, but the idea of vaudeville's theatre changed radically from its French antecedent.\n\nIn some ways analogous to music hall from Victorian Britain, a typical American vaudeville performance was made up of a series of separate, unrelated acts grouped together on a common bill. Types of acts have included popular and classical musicians, singers, dancers, comedians, trained animals, magicians, ventriloquists, strongmen, female and male impersonators, acrobats, clowns, illustrated songs, jugglers, one-act plays or scenes from plays, athletes, lecturing celebrities, minstrels, and movies. Called \"the heart of American show business\", vaudeville was one of the most popular types of entertainment in North America for several decades.\n\n​Frank Brunner Rhodes was born January 17th, 1867, the son of Francis Thomas Rhodes (1835-1906) and Eliza Jane Mantz (1835-1913). Our subject is buried under a family monument that also marks the final resting place of his parents and sister Ada (1859-1938).\n\n1870 US Census showing Rhodes Family living in Frederick\n\n​ I figured I’d include the obituaries of Frank’s parents as they shed some important light on his upbringing.\n\n​So this is going to be one of those biographies which I am making from scratch, having found nothing substantial online or in history books. It’s funny, as it seems that Frank B. Rhodes’ life was extraordinary and we should know more considering the reality stars of today are heralded as “larger than life” by today’s media outlets. Mr. Rhodes frequently made the Frederick newspapers, so the following is a chronological compilation of his life doings in an effort to piece him together after 1880.\n\n1880 US Census\n\n​Frank Brunner Rhodes\n\nThanks to a few articles found in local newspapers, I gleaned a bit about our subject at the time of his 21st year. Frank and his father (referred to as “the Governor”) were noted musicians with the highly-acclaimed Frederick Cornet Band, and made a good showing in Martinsburg, WV in 1884. Frank also worked for his father at the family-run soda fountain and confectionary. Apparently, he had to come to the rescue of his brother who experienced an unfortunate accident in 1885.\n\nFrederick News (Sept 18, 1911)\n\nFrederick Examiner (March 1, 1871)\n\nFrederick News (Jan 26, 1885)\n\n​Frank was more than a gifted musician, apparently he possessed special talent as an actor. In 1886, he would leave home to work with a noted theatrical group based in the Philadelphia area. Frank B. Rhodes would travel with this group over the next few years, and I’ve enclosed a letter written home and printed in the local paper in which he describes (in great detail) a visit to a coal mine in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania. A year and a half earlier in December, 1885, 26 men perished as a flood occurred in this mine and all were killed by a deadly flow of quicksand.\n\nFrederick News (Oct 30, 1886)\n\nActress Kittie Rhodes\n\nNanticoke, PA\n\nFrederick News (May 17, 1887)\n\nMine entrance (Nanticoke)\n\nFrederick News (June 9, 1887)\n\nIn 1890, a local newspaper referred to Frank B. Rhodes as “Frederick’s rising young comedian.” His involvement with the Frederick Cornet Band continued, as he served in capacity of Drum Major. The group, under his leadership, was heralded for their participation in the 1890 unveiling of a large memorial to Robert E. Lee in Richmond, the former capital of the Confederacy during the American Civil War.\n\n​Rhodes would excel with a caricature of himself as “the lightning drum major of the world.” I found a picture on eBay through my research and this was a photograph of an award presented to Rhodes stating the fact that he was seen as the world’s top drum major. Just another example of how you can find almost anything on eBay I guess.\n\nWhile conducting random Google searches online, I also stumbled across an unidentified photo of a vaudeville performer of this era, and wonder if it could possibly be our subject?\n\n​Frank was hired to participate in vaudeville and minstrel shows that traveled the country, most notably W. S. Cleveland’s Consolidated Minstrels, and Joseph Gorton’s Minstrels. He would spend 1891 and 1892 on the road with a stage production called “Uncle Hiram,” in which audiences delighted in seeing him perform his drum major shtick.\n\nCincinnati Enquirer (Jan 25, 1891)\n\nFrederick News (Aug 4, 1890)\n\nWheeling (WV) Register (Feb 22, 1891)\n\nLogansport (IN) Reporter (March 30, 1891)\n\nFrederick News (Dec 2, 1891)\n\nFrederick News (June 4, 1891)\n\nFrederick News (July 15, 1891)\n\nFrederick News (Aug 6, 1891)\n\nWatertown (NY) Daily News (Aug 27, 1892)\n\nFrank B. Rhodes came back to his hometown as an entertainment star. It seemed that celebrity hadn’t changed him that much as he could be found doing his own stunts as evidenced by his killing of a rattlesnake on a local excursion to nearby White Rock, north of town.\n\nFrank was still being recruited for work by theatrical groups around the country, however he seems to have settled into life in his hometown. He married a local girl and actress, Ida Wilmoth Adams, in 1893. She was the granddaughter of former Frederick mayor Lewis Brunner who served from 1890-1892. This fact may have played a hand in Frank gaining local employment at the Frederick Opera House.\n\nFrederick News (June 20, 1893)\n\nFrederick News (July 21, 1893)\n\n​His knowledge of show business likely landed him the job of theater manager of the City Opera House. Known today as Brewers Alley Restaurant, the Opera House shared its commodious quarters with Frederick’s Market House and Town Hall, both located on the first floor. The current edifice was built in 1873 and was quite impressive as a premiere show venue.\n\nCity Opera House\n\nStage of City Opera House\n\n​The second floor included a large auditorium that would one day accommodate 1,100 seats. In 1900, under the leadership of Mr. Rhodes, the building was renovated to include an auditorium on its first floor with balconies. Its stage presented shows by touring companies and local theater groups, symphonies and dances, and lectures and special services. Mr. Rhodes deserves a great deal of this credit and was responsible for bringing top national acts and performers to Frederick throughout the next two decades.\n\nFrederick News (Sept 22, 1893)\n\nFrederick News (Aug 22, 1893)\n\nFrederick News (Sept 14, 1893)\n\nIn 1895, Frank helped create Frederick’s Orchestra, managed a large Flower Show, brought a premiere touring show of Romeo and Juliet, and helped establish local, home-grown theater. As a matter of fact, in that same year, he helped stage a local production of “Princess Phosa” that would raise money for the Francis Scott Key Monument Association attempting to garner funds for a memorial to be placed at Mount Olivet Cemetery.\n\nFrederick Citizen (June 14, 1894)\n\nA photograph in the collection of Heritage Frederick showing Frank B. Rhodes\n\nA local theater group was another creation of Mr. Rhodes and given the name, “The Merrymakers.”\n\nNew York Clipper (July 17, 1897)\n\nFrederick News (Aug 27, 1897)\n\nFrederick News (Nov 1, 1897)\n\nFrederick News (Dec 6, 1897)\n\n1900 US Census\n\n​In the 1900 census, Frank Rhodes is listed as a renter in the Market Space, which made for a very short commute to the Opera House located next door. He and Ida were parents to two children, Frank Jr. (b. 1894) and Winifred (b. 1898). Frank seems to have done a lot of work “behind the scenes” when it came to the theater world. This is as much a figurative statement as it is literal, because Frank B. Rhodes had a strong reputation for being one of the country’s best scenery creators. Many articles herald his work which was in demand by theater companies and venues throughout the country. Articles regularly announced his sojourns to other cities to consult and install stage backdrops.\n\n​​In 1903-1904, Frank took a show on the road, entitled “Uncle Hez.” He actually purchased a custom train car in which to transport his production staff to cities around the country. He also was given the job to create a top-notch entertainment venue at the Frederick Agricultural Fairgrounds.\n\nFrederick News (Sept 12, 1902)\n\nFrederick News (Sept 4, 1902)\n\nFrederick News (May 2, 1902)\n\nFrederick News (March 2, 1904). Note that the reporter refers to Frank Adams as our subject assumed his wife's maiden name for this venture\n\nFrederick Post (April 14, 1941) An article found in the local newspaper telling the story of the Uncle Hez Touring Company forty years later\n\n​Once back home in Frederick, he devoted more time to serving as lessee of the Frederick Opera House, while also running his own restaurant on West 2nd Street called the Wedgewood Café. This eatery was opened in early 1907 and heralded as “the little restaurant that sets the pace,” and was located at the former site of his father’s soda fountain. In a few years’ time, Frank would convert the café into the larger Wedgewood Inn, a hotel. Unfortunately, the venture, although very popular with the citizenry, would close in early 1909 and became home to a green grocer under Mr. C. M. Dixon.\n\nFrederick News (April 16, 1908)\n\n5 West Second Street (tan building on left)\n\n​Frank and Ida Rhodes continued with Vaudeville engagements. They are found living at #3 West Second Street in the 1910 census, however their time in Frederick was coming to an end. They would move to New York shortly thereafter.\n\nFrederick News (Aug 9, 1905)\n\nCumberland Evening Times (July 12, 1909)\n\n1910 US Census\n\nFrederick News (March 17th, 1911)\n\nFrederick News (Nov 3, 1911)\n\n​Frank’s heralded return to Frederick was highly anticipated as he would not come in person, but instead by way of a film reel. Frederick’s vaudevillian would appear in a movie entitled “Oh the Relations” which played at the Marvel Theater in summer 1912.\n\nFrederick Post (Jan 31, 1912)\n\nMade by Solax Studios of New Jersey, I found a synopsis online of this film:\n\n“The son of a poor widow leaves his mother, and goes out into the \"world\" to \"make his mark.\" The boy succeeds rapidly. Before long he marries into a family of wealth. The boy in the meanwhile forgets all about the narrow straits in which he has left his mother. He also forgets that she needs money regularly with which to live. Only periodically does he send her a measly $5. To his new friends and his wife he poses as an orphan without friends or relations. His mother suffers keenly her son's neglect. At last, when her son had neglected to send her a remittance for a good many months, the mother decides to go to the city and look him up. Worn out with privation and hunger this poor widow reaches the city. Having no place to go, she wends her way to a house of God. Here she sinks into a faint, while the services are in progress. A wealthy woman and her little daughter have compassion on the poor woman. Answering the pleadings of her little girl and her own humane instincts, she orders that the widow be taken to her home. The wealthy woman's husband turns out to be the widow's son. Fate brought together mother and son. The son, seeing his mother's condition, soon realizes how snobbish, how undutiable and how mean he has been. And while with bowed head and shamed face he asks her forgiveness, his wife and child clasp their new-found relation to their hearts. The mother forgives her erring son and takes him to her heaving breast.”\n\nAlice Guy Blache (1873-1968)\n\nThe more fascinating aspect of this experience for Frank B. Rhodes is that he actually worked for the first woman to direct films. Solax Studios was an American motion picture studio founded in 1910 by executives from the Gaumont Film Company of France. Alice Guy-Blaché, her husband Herbert, and a third partner, George A. Magie established the Solax Company. Alice Guy-Blaché was artistic director and the director for many of its films, while her husband Herbert Blaché managed production for the new company. They built the first studio in Flushing, New York but, as Solax prospered they invested more than $100,000 in a modern production plant in 1912 in Fort Lee, New Jersey, a place that was quickly becoming the film capital of America and home to many major film studios.\n\nAlthough Frank B. Rhodes’ movie career was not stellar, he was proactive in entering the new entertainment medium that was slowly killing vaudeville and stage productions. More vaudeville performers were pulled into cinema, and the line between live and recorded performance became blurred in the eyes of the masses.\n\nBy 1914, Frank and family were living in Huntington, WV. Apparently they were making ends meet as a traveling team calling themselves “the Four Palettes.”\n\nFrederick News (Oct 12, 1914)\n\nThe Rhodes appear back in New York, living in the city and what is today known as the Chelsea neighborhood. An article in the Frederick newspaper in 1916, claims that the family were recent victims of a robbery.\n\nFrederick News (Jan 6, 1916)\n\n​Frank B. Rhodes and family would soon be out of the city, and living in East Greenwich, Rhode Island.\n\n1920 US Census showing the Rhodes family living in Rhode Island\n\n​A local newspaper article claims the Rhodes moved to Kentucky in 1923, but they would be back in Rhode Island by 1925. It seems that Frank Rhodes would settle into retirement in the vicinity of Cranston, a suburb of Providence, Rhode Island. Information from here on out on Frank is scarce.\n\nThe Rhodes can be found living with their daughter and family in the 1940 US Census. Frank, Jr. lived in the area and was a lieutenant colonel and commander of Fort Wetherill, a coast artillery fortress, at this time.\n\n1940 US Census showing Frank and Ida living in Cranston, Rhode Island\n\nLast residence of Frank B. Rhodes at 58 Wheeler Ave, Cranston, Rhode Island\n\nFrank B. Rhodes took his final curtain call in August of 1941. A few months later, the country would be at war with Japan. Frank Jr. died in 1950 and Winifred in 1959. Ida Rhodes lived out her life in Duval, Florida, dying in 1965.\n\nWhat a storied career for Frank T. Rhodes. Much like Robert Downing, another theatrical legend found buried roughly 100 yards away, we’d never know about these past lives lived if we didn’t look into them deeper.\n\n​\n\nCemeteries are special places and incredible theaters unto themselves, keepers of actors of all sorts whose “Stories in Stone\" just need a stage to bring back their memory.\n\nI was recently walking around the cemetery with trusted research assistant Marilyn Veek. We were chatting about various “Stories in Stone” offerings past, present and upcoming, along with other research endeavors taken on as part of our Friends of Mount Olivet (FOMO)membership group and the cemetery’s Preservation and Enhancement program begun in late 2017. We eventually came upon Area NN, a truly unique part of our historic grounds which hold the oldest collection of graves in the cemetery.\n\nThe section here includes the mortal remains of folks formerly buried in three of downtown Frederick’s original burying grounds, specifically decedents associated with the Lutheran, Methodist and Presbyterian congregations. These churches, along with four others, were part of the genesis of Mount Olivet back in the early 1850s. A new, non-denominational communal cemetery on the outskirts of town would remedy the problem of existing churchyards having become filled to capacity, while in several cases, adjoining ground was needed to expand worship facilities for an ever-growing population.\n\nHere in Area NN, we are currently aided by the opportunity to read stones like never before in our lifetime because of the work our Friends group undertook last summer in cleaning these monuments. This came under the supervision of our FOMO monument cleaning committee under Nanette and Rob Markey. Most of these gravestones date to the early 1800s, and a few are from the 1700s. Many are beautiful examples of early stone mason craftsmanship, with some even carved in German, a language commonly spoken in town as English up through the early decades of the 19th century.\n\nOne such downtown burying ground, long gone, was that of the Old Presbyterian Churchyard. This sacred plot was once located around the congregation's first meeting house on the southwest corner of North Bentz and West Fourth streets, at the point where today’s Dill Avenue begins.\n\nThe original Presbyterian Meeting House can be seen on Charles Varle's 1808 map of Frederick in the upper left corner with its location on the southwest corner of N. Bentz and W. Fourth streets\n\nSouthwest corner of N. Bentz Stand Dill Ave, former site of Frederick's original Presbyterian Church and graveyard\n\n​Frederick's original English Presbyterian Church was constructed in 1780 and built of brick and boasted \"high backed pews, a lofty pulpit, and a brick floor.\" A new house of worship was completed in 1825 on West Second Street, but the original graveyard remained active until 1885, at which time the trustees decided to discontinue use. The old structure was utilized afterwards as part of an old factory until being sold, along with the cemetery ground, to the Salvation Army for $400 in 1887.\n\n​ A telling letter to the editor appeared in the Frederick Post on October 6th, 1936. This was written by one of our former “Stories in Stone” subjects, Edward Ralston Goldsborough, and paints a little clearer picture of the ancient burying ground. It exposes the problem encountered with wholesale cemetery removals in which not all bodies are sometimes accounted for.\n\nFrederick Post (Oct 5, 1936)\n\nMost of the bodies here were removed on May 10th, 1887 and transferred to Mount Olivet. They were originally placed in Area Q, but later moved to Area NN on December 12th, 1907. Among these was a gentleman by the name of Abraham Haff, who is said to rest in Lot 130/Grave 11. A monument on this site is the most substantial of all the Presbyterian gravestones, however, it only tells half, or should I say “haff” of the story.\n\nLet me explain, the monument proudly displays the name of Abraham Haff on its face, born September 22nd, 1805 and died on January 29th, 1864. Thanks to our thorough cemetery records, I would soon find that although the monument calls out Abraham Haff, it’s not the same Abraham Haff buried a few feet below this brown, sandstone memorial. To make things more confusing, the decedent resting in Lot 130/Grave 11 holds the same name of Abraham Haff, but is the father of the guy whose name is carved in the stone above. He has a birth date of May 5th, 1769 and death date of December 30th, 1813, and it will be safe to label this latter gentleman with a suffix—Abraham Haff, Jr.\n\nAbraham Haff, Jr. was born in Frederick in 1769, the son of a Revolutionary War veteran named Major Abraham Haff, Sr. (1734-1812) of Readington Township (Hunterdon County), New Jersey. His mother was Jane Beatty (1736-1812), a granddaughter of the famed Colonial pioneer (to Frederick) named Susanna Ashfordby Beatty, originally from the Kingston, New York area. Jane is connected to her grandmother’s property purchased in the 1730s, site of the aptly named Beatty-Cramer house, found just east of Ceresville, along Israel's Creek and clearly visible on the north side of Liberty Road/MD route 26. On October 10th, 1781, Major Haff obtained 149 acres from his mother-in-law’s estate of Spring Garden about the location of Glade Valley Farms on the approach to Mount Pleasant.\n\nProperty of Abraham Haff, Jr is shown as #13 on this map of Dulany's Lot from Grace Tracey's \"Pioneers of Old Monocacy\"\n\nAbraham Haff, Jr. in the 1800 US Census\n\nAbraham Haff, Jr. estate sale advertisement in the Republican Gazette and General Advertiser (Sept 5, 1821)\n\nMajor Abraham Haff, Sr. served as an early church elder and donated the land the original Presbyterian Church and burying ground would be built upon. I gleaned a bit about the Abraham Haff, Jr. from a genealogy book written by Frank Allaben and found online: The Ancestry of Leander Howard Crall: Monographs on the Crall, Haff, Beatty …Families published in 1908 by Grafton Press of New York City.\n\nThe following is the section on Abraham Haff, Jr.:\n\nAbraham Haff, Jr. was married twice. His first wife was Frances Dern (b. 1778), whom he married in 1795. The Haffs had eight children, of which we are most interested here in the 5th born and only son. They included: Catherine (Haff) Biggs (1797-1852), Martha (Haff) Gilson (1799-1873), Mary (Haff) Crall (1801-1881), Frances Jane (Haff) Delaplaine (1803-1869), Abraham Haff III (b. 1805), Amy (Haff) Troxell (1808-1888), and Priscilla (Haff) Biggs (b. 1810). Frances died in 1811 and Abraham, Jr. married again in July, 1812 to Priscilla Hauer. An eighth child would be born to Haff, Eleanor Mary (Haff) Stevenson (b. May, 1813), but he would die before the end of the year.\n\nAs far as I could tell, none of these children are buried in Mount Olivet, save for son Abraham. Frances Haff was likely buried in the Presbyterian Graveyard, but didn’t make the trip to Mount Olivet with her husband’s remains—at least we have no record of her here.\n\nSo, I told you that there is not a separate stone marker for Abraham Haff, Jr. Perhaps there was one which originally stood in the old Presbyterian churchyard, but who knows? It likely disappeared along the way as well, not uncommon as broken or worn stones were seen as unsightly elements here in Frederick’s “garden cemetery” back in the day, and basically not allowed to be placed. I would look to 1887 as the time a decision was made in refusing his old stone, or perhaps there wasn’t anything to consider in the first place. Instead, the large monument for Abraham Haff III would be placed here over Abraham, Jr.\n\nSo is Abraham III nearby? Before we answer that question, let’s look at the life of Abraham Haff III, one in which we see a continued devotion to Frederick’s Presbyterian congregation. On the flip-side, I did not find Abraham Haff III to be a real fun-loving guy—more of a” glass half-empty” kind of individual but he always had faith.\n\nAbraham III had a childhood filled with loss as he would lose his patriotic grandfather (Abraham, Sr.), and biological parents before he turned eight. Now, as a step-parent myself, I don’t want to falsely speculate on the ‘tween and teen years of our subject, but God only knows the experience Abraham III had being raised by his stepmother and her (third) husband. In addition, keep in mind he was the only boy, having seven sisters to contend with. Whatever the case, he never married, or had children of his own. A lone mention in Jacob Engelbrecht’s diary raises another interesting mystery along the subject of potential “family bliss” for Abraham.\n\n​\n\n“Married on Sunday last 30 ultimo at Gettysburg Pennsylvania by Justice Wilson of Waynesboro, Doctor Abraham Haff of this city to Miss Jane Brooks of Chester County Pennsylvania.”\n\nThis was written by the author on December 2nd, 1828, however Jacob later writes the notation that this was a “false report.”\n\nMr. Haff was a staunch supporter of temperance, and led an exhilarating career as a druggist under the firm name of Haff & Davidson, begun around 1827. The apothecary’s location was near the Square Corner intersection of Market and Patrick streets (a few doors north of the northeast corner). I found, however, that Haff’s business partner, George Davidson, died in January, 1831 of Scarlet Fever. He is buried in Mount Olivet’s Area NN, but doesn’t have a gravestone either.\n\nReservoir and Public Reflector (Oct 16, 1827)\n\n​The partnership was dissolved, but Mr. Haff took over the whole of the operation. As he strived to make people of Frederick better, he surely prescribed the notion that death comes to all eventually, regardless of medicine. This would be telling in his own case.\n\nHaff's young business associate was the son of the town’s former Presbyterian minister Rev. Patrick Davidson (1775-1824). Rev. Davidson was also a former principal of the Frederick Academy and has a large and impressive ledger-style monument found to the immediate right of Abraham Haff III’s monument.\n\nFrederick-Town Herald (Feb 19, 1831)\n\nFrederick-Town Herald (June 4, 1831)\n\n​Sadly, death would come to Haff’s business venture as he had to put it up for sale one year later. It appears that he may have been bankrupt in 1832 as he defaulted on a mortgage and had to sell off all the stock/wares from the shop as well as a farm in Creagerstown that he had bought in 1827. At the time, his sister and brother-in-law were living on the premises.\n\nFrederick-Town Herald (March 3, 1832)\n\nFrederick-Town Herald (July 28, 1832)\n\nMr. Haff never bought another property but continued working as a druggist at least through 1863, based on newspaper ads I saw. It appears that Abraham Haff III’s career in medicine continued as he worked in conjunction with two other leading physicians of town in his latter years—Dr. George Fischer (1809-1866) and Dr. Fairfax Schley (1823-1903). He can be found living in the same household with each of these gentlemen, respectively, in the 1850 and 1860 US Census records. ​\n\n1850 US Census showing Abraham Haff III living with George Fischer and family\n\nFrederick Examiner (Sept 7, 1859)\n\nFrederick Examiner (Nov 4, 1863)\n\n1860 US Census showing Abraham Haff III with Fairfax Schley as head of household. The spacious mansion home of Dr. Schley was located at 18 W. Patrick St. The stately home is gone, and a bank sits on the location today.\n\nThis is a photo taken around 1904 from Court Street looking east on West Patrick Street. Fairfax Schley lived at #18 which is the large three-story house on right (behind the telephone pole)\n\nHaff’s lasting achievement seems to have been his unwavering service as superintendent of the Presbyterian Church Sunday School. He certainly followed in his grandfather’s shoes with this congregation. As a matter of fact, this post indirectly led to his untimely death at the age of 58. On the bright side, however, his Sunday school endeavor caused a fine memorial to be erected in the Presbyterian Churchyard at the time of his death. In turn, it is this memorial that led me to write this story, as it’s the same monument that sits on top of his father’s grave in Area NN.\n\nThe Crall family genealogy, referenced earlier, was written from the context of Abraham III’s brother-in-law, Joseph, wife of Abraham’s sister, Mary. Here is what the book has to say about Abraham III, including a recounting of his death in early, 1864:\n\nAs one could imagine, the Frederick community was stunned in hearing the news of Mr. Haff's death at the age of 58, but none more than his fellow parishioners of Frederick's Presbyterian Church. The following lengthy obituary would appear in the local newspapers.\n\nBaltimore Sun (Jan 30, 1864)\n\nFrederick Examiner (Feb 3, 1864)\n\nMaryland Union (Feb 4, 1864)\n\nAbraham Haff, III was buried in Mount Olivet on January 31st, 1864. His plot was paid for the day before by Fairfax Schley. This burial plot, however, is nowhere near Area NN or Area Q for that matter. Instead, it is in Area B/Lot 35.\n\nEntries found in Mount Olivet's Lot Book (above) and Interment Book (below)\n\nI ventured to look at this gravesite, especially curious to see his gravestone. When I arrived, I was perplexed seeing no grave marker whatsoever. In subsequent years, members of the William and Eve Stoner family were laid to rest here. I question why an impressive monument would be placed in the Presbyterian Cemetery in memory of this man, but nothing over his final resting spot here in Mount Olivet? With no heirs of his own, I guess the charity of Fairfax Schley and the Presbyterian Church had been exhausted.\n\nArea B/Lot 35, the unmarked final resting place of Abraham Haff, III\n\nMore puzzling was the fact that Haff III’s large memorial monument was placed in Areas Q (1887) and NN (1907) respectively at the time of the Presbyterian Cemetery removal, and lot transfer within the cemetery. At this time, however, the Stoners had been buried in some of the spots in Area B/Lot 35. Looking at our cemetery lot card for this plot, it appears that 44 year-old William Stoner would be buried directly over top Abraham in the same exact grave space (labeled #2). Mr. Stoner died in 1863, but was re-interred elsewhere and later reburied here in 1891, shortly after the burials of his wife Eva in 1890 and daughters Mary and Edna (who died in 1887 and 1889 respectively).\n\n​As the article above stated, Abraham III died of a heart attack in a street car in Baltimore, Maryland, while returning from a Sunday School Convention held in Boston and/or purchasing business supplies and goods in New York. The large monument was placed shortly thereafter within the Presbyterian Graveyard honoring him as Superintendent of Sunday School. When all inhabitants of the burying ground were re-interred in May of 1887, Haff’s fine tribute marker was brought to Mount Olivet as well, and later placed in NN-130-11A over his father's assigned grave regardless of the fact that he, Abraham Haff III, was actually buried in Area B/Lot 35 thirteen years prior on January 31st, 1864.\n\n​I find it so ironic that Abraham and William Stoner would each share “half” of a grave lot at this location. Meanwhile, over in Area NN, Abraham III’s monument is sharing half a gravesite with his father.\n\nFrederick Examiner (Feb 10, 1864)\n\nFrederick Examiner (Feb 10, 1864)\n\nHopefully I’ve piqued interest with the unorthodox title above. Living here in Frederick, Maryland, most residents are familiar with the initials “T.J.” and who they belong to. Yes, the man who unknowingly lent his name to not only a local high school (my alma mater) and middle school, but also a thoroughfare through an estimated 85% of our town’s physician offices and related medical services. I’m talking, of course, about Thomas Johnson. Mr. Johnson was one of Maryland’s top heroes of the American Revolution period, and became the state’s first elected governor. His resume is quite impressive, and the above named legacies are fitting because they are located on land Johnson had purchased in 1778.\n\n​\n\nI wrote a piece on Gov. Thomas Johnson, Jr. back in October 2019, marking the 200th anniversary of his death. My focus this week is not on Thomas, but I wanted to make special mention of one of his eight children, Ann Jennings (Johnson) Grahame, born in Annapolis in 1759. In addition to being his oldest daughter, biographer Edward S. Delaplaine claimed that she was her father’s favorite. Thomas Johnson had five of eight children reach adulthood, one being the fore-mentioned Ann.\n\n​As for Ann Jennings (Johnson) Grahame, many may have a familiarity with this woman, but likely more because of her home, rather than a particular deed or accomplishment achieved during her lifetime. Ann, and husband Major John Colin Grahame, are responsible for building the mansion known as Rose Hill Manor in the mid-1790s. The story goes that Anne’s father gave the newly married couple an amazing wedding gift in 1789—the 225-acre parcel formerly known as Rose Garden. Thomas Johnson also “bankrolled” the construction of the magnificent manor house. In return, Thomas, who had recently lost his wife, came to live at Rose Hill for his final 25 years. (He had previously lived just up the road at a plantation named Richfield.)\n\nMajor Grahame died in 1833, and Ann would live another four years until spring, 1837. Frederick diarist Jacob Engelbrecht made the following entry in his diary on May 5th, 1837:\n\n“Died on Wednesday last 3rd instant in the 69 years of her age, Mrs. Ann J. Grahame widow of the late Major John Grahame and daughter of the late Governor Thomas Johnson. Buried on the Protestant-Episcopal graveyard.”\n\n​\n\nThis locale was also known as All Saint’s Burying Ground, between Carroll Creek and East All Saints Street. Sometime between 1854 and 1913, Ann’s remains would be reinterred here in Mount Olivet in Area A/Lot 2. A fine monument memorializes her, although the death date carved in stone reads 1835 instead of 1837. Our cemetery files agree with Engelbrecht’s death date, however his math was off by ten as Mrs. Graham was 79 years of age, not 69.\n\n​Well that takes care of explaining a fraction of my puzzling story title. Since we’ve now established who one T.J. is, now it’s time for the “other,” as these two men personally knew each other during time spent together serving in the Continental Congress and fight for Independence back in the 1770s. Proof of their relationship in later decades exists in the form of a letter received by Thomas Johnson in March 1792 from the other T. J. The contents spoke to Mr. Johnson’s work as one of the commissioners chosen to oversee the laying out of the country’s new capital, the District of Columbia.\n\n​\n\n​Of course I’m talking about the immortal Thomas Jefferson, who at this time was serving as Secretary of State under first president George Washington, a known close friend of Thomas Johnson. Interestingly, I learned that our (Frederick) T.J. was originally given consideration by Washington to serve as his Secretary of State in 1793. Johnson would be offered this position by Washington, himself, two years later, after the resignation of Edmond Randolph. Johnson had stepped down from a position as an associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court late 1793 and would respectfully decline the position due to his own concerns with declining health.\n\nThomas Jefferson\n\nMartha (Wayles) Jefferson\n\n​Wives and Daughters\n\nBoth T.J.s were widowed early, Thomas Johnson in 1794 after the death of wife Ann Jennings, and Thomas Jefferson in 1782 when wife Martha Wayles Skelton (b. 1748) passed, likely due to complications tied to the birth of her final child, Lucy, who would eventually die at age two. Two other children of Thomas and Martha Jefferson also died in infancy (Jane in 1775 and Peter in 1777). The couple did have two daughters who lived into adulthood: Martha “Patsy” Randolph (1772-1846) and Mary “Polly” Eppes (1778-1804).\n\nMartha \"Patsy\" Randolph\n\nMary \"Polly\" Eppes\n\nSo I recently received an interesting phone call from my longtime barber, Lawrence Jesse, and wife Susan Reeder Jesse. Apparently a family friend of theirs dabbles in genealogy, and offered to do some family tree work for them.\n\n​\n\nWell, while researching back through Susan’s lineage, the researcher stumbled upon a very curious and interesting find in regard to Susan’s mother’s family, the Kehnes. It appears that Susan’s GG Grandfather, George Dallas Kehne (1850-1931), had a brother named Lewis Augustus Kehne (1840-1920). Both Kehne brothers emigrated "
