        "text": "This letter was written by John Saunders Slater (1826-1880), the son of John (“Jack”) Slater (1795-1864) and Fluvanna P. Saunders (1803-1877). Though John was trained in medicine, the 1850 Census indicates that he was employed as a merchant in New Kent County, and that he was employed as a bookkeeper in Richmond at the time of the 1880 Census just before his death. He was married to Virginia Whiting Dandridge (1815-1883) and he served the Confederate States of America as a member of the New Kent Cavalry during the Civil War. John’s brother, Dr. Leonard A. Slater also served as a Confederate Surgeon during the war.\n\nIn this letter to his father, John advises his father to abstain from alcohol and to give up his apparent addiction to Brandreth’s Pills as a means of achieving regularity in his bowel movements. He also adds a short letter to his sister Martha A. Slater (b. 1831) who has apparently been keeping him up to date with the local gossip while he has been studying medicine in Cincinnati.\n\nTRANSCRIPTION\n\nAddressed to Mr. John Slater, Slatersville, New Kent Court House, Virginia\n\nCincinnati, Ohio\n\n6 o’clock, Tuesday Evening, January 26th 1847\n\nMy dear father,\n\nYour very kind and obliging letter of the 20th instant came to hand today about one o’clock, and now lies before me, and at your request, I answer it “immediately” with feelings of pain and pleasure.\n\nI was some grieved to learn that your health was so very feeble and delicate, and I am forcibly and sorrowfully brought to the conclusion that the vital principle which animates and sustains your physical organization will soon be overwhelmed and extinguished, unless you discard from your use, in toto, Brandreth’s Pills — a “medicine” (?) alias, a “prison,” which, though you may think relieves you at first, yet I do know (not conjecture) — slowly but as surely undermine the constitution as the deadly “Bohm Upa’s;” and I know if you had seen their modus operandi as clearly and as forcibly demonstrated as I have, you would renounce — yes renounce — them forever! Now, I do beg of you to leave them off. I tell you, they drain the system of the very vitality itself. Better take no medicine at all, but confide in the recuperative natural, when you are sick, than make use of “Brandreth’s Pills” or of any other like materials.\n\nNow, when you are sick, if you won’t make use of inactive means, use the “composition” tea, sage, balm, catnip, or pennyroyal, or what is better than any, a strong tea of Boneset — all which are calculated to aid nature in her attempts to remove disease, & not to depress her. And moreover, you must be temperate and prudent in your diet & general habits. Your diet should be mostly vegetables and not too much of it. But I hope I have said enough on this subject. Follow my advice, and the result will be a restoration to a tolerable degree of health.\n\nWith regard to my staying here, I’m permitted to do so by your last letter — as I am to act as judge, I shall remain, knowing that I will possess advantages, which, it is doubtful I will ever have again. And altho’ I should be much pleased to be with you & all this spring and summer, yet I must be deprived of that pleasure for a season. As to borrowing the required sum from my friend, I must decline doing it (altho’ I presume he would lend it me willingly) as he is entirely dependent upon himself and his means are quite limited having expended most of his funds in his education. I will not actually need the money until the 22nd of February, at which time our session comes to a close.\n\nYou will please answer this letter as soon as you can and remit me the required sum, as shown in my letter of the 9th January, and with unbounded feelings of gratitude for your parental care and affection, I am ever your son, — John Slater\n\nDear Sister Martha,\n\nYour letter was indeed no small treat to me. It roused my drooping spirits and drew away my sad feelings for a time. And although it pushed me to read a part of it, yet I was so pleased with it that I read it over and over again, and I was quite put to it, to study out who you meant when you spoke of the death of poor “Pete.” But I at last found out that the was Peter Turkey. And is poor peter dead? Well, I’m truly sorry. I expect you all played sad havoc upon his poor, fat carcass. I should like to have been the partaker of the rich banquet — notwithstanding I cut off “peter” turkeys pretty often in this section.\n\nWith regard to toast drinking, as stated indoor letter, I would st___ that they were of the “pure stuff” so you need not be uneasy. The old doctor is a thorough going teetotaler and reformed in every respect. Next is order is, “Len is going to school to Mr. Lester’ — tell him, he must not be so wild & bad, but must learn fast, learn to write well in every respect — must write to me &c. I’m little surprised to learn that Mr. Sale has married a wealthy lady. I think she must have borne the same appearance that he does, and she must have thought that her chance of marrying was rather ‘scanty.’ Mr. Jones seems much disturbed about Miss A. E. Chandler’s being married. I’ve advised him to write to her immediately and “fix matters.” I’m obliged to the ladies for their love sent me & in return send mine to all with whom I’m acquainted. In reply to your question, I reply I wrote to Nannie B. a few days ago. — J. Slater\n\nYou must write to me soon after you go to Richmond. Give me every bit of the news. you can get. Remember me affectionately to Miss Bettie A___th. I have not quite come up to your request but as near as I can. My best love to you and all. Good night. Messrs. James & J___ send their respects to the family.\n\nP. S. When you spoke of Emily, I had almost forgotten who it was, or rather forgotten that she was named Em. Tell ma to take good care of her, and not let her grow too smart.\n\nThis letter was written by 19 year-old Thomas Russell (1826-1887), the son of Massachusetts State Treasurer Thomas Russell (1788-18xx) and Mary Ann Goodwin (1792-1872) of Plymouth, Massachusetts. After graduating from Harvard in the Class of 1825, he studied law and entered the office of Whiting & Russell in Boston, the junior partner being William G. Russell, his brother. He was admitted to the bar in 1850 and served for a time as the judge of the Boston Police Court until his appointment to the superior court by Gov. Banks. He also served as the Collector of the Port of Boston, the U.S. Minister to Venezuela, and as the Chairman of the State Board of Railroad Commissioners.\n\nIn the years before the Civil War, Thomas was a free soil advocate and the associate of Senator Charles Sumner and William Lloyd Garrison. He had a reputation as a “pleasing speaker, and excelled as a clear, accurate, and forceful writer.”\n\nThomas wrote the letter to his Harvard classmate, Charles Henry Glover (1825-1885) of Rhode Island who was studying law in the office of [William C] Russel & [James H.] Storrs in New York City. He was the son of Charles Glover (1795-1846) and Elisa Gardner (1797-1885). He was married twice. First to Mary Otheman (1824-1850), and second to a woman named Eva (b. 1832). The Glovers made their home in Brooklyn.\n\nTRANSCRIPTION\n\nAddressed to Mr. Charles H. Glover, Care of Russel & Storrs, 29 Wall Street, New York\n\nCambridge [Massachusetts]\n\nDecember 11, 1845, 12¼ o’clock\n\nDear Glover,\n\nI suppose by your letting me go so long that my abominable prosiness has quite frightened you out of the idea of writing me again. But I assure you, we shall not let you go so easily. “We shall carry the war into Africa.”\n\nI told you in my last that I should write you again soon and answer the rest of your letter. The truth is, in this matter you have rather the advantage of me. You have the happy faculty of writing so much and asking so many questions in a single letter that one of your heavy, good old-fashioned slow coaches can hardly get through it all in three or four well-filled replies. I can assure you, first, on proper authority, that your assept [?] has been duly received. As for the rusted key, if I was an AΔφ. Ellis probably inherited it.\n\nAnd now, I mean to give you some account of the fellows. What they are doing &c. &c. I don’t know how much of what I know you may have heard already from other quarters, but shall trust to your mercy to forgive me if any or all of it be old news.\n\nHow many do you think, then, of “the great sixty-one” are at the present moment either actually studying one day the three noble callings — Divinity, Law & Phys. [Medicine]. According to the latest authorities, I believe about thirty. Our “All hail the world” contrasts rather laughably just now with the actual state of things. Imagine, for instance, our friend Sam [Samuel Franklin Coues] changing his comfortable room in Massachusetts for a room over an Apothecary Shop in Charles Street (It is near the church. You may perhaps recollect the shiny blue and green bottles as you used to see them in walking out at night.) [William Otis] Johnson & [Paul Louis] Nichols enjoying a comfortable prospect, rainy — or rather stormy, across Howard Street and Harrison Avenue respectively, and so of a good many others. Your own melancholy situation will perhaps supply you some appropriate imagery for the filling out of the picture. [William Henry] Thorndyke is another medical student, and I believe [William Henry] Davison, who is teaching a school in Watertown ($500.00) at present, means by and by to join them. These make up the Medical list. They all seem to be in fine spirits and very much pleased with the profession.\n\nFor Divinity students, we have [Francis] Parker at Princeton, whose letters represent him to be in a sort of terrestrial paradise. [Rolla Oscar] Page, who has the High School in the Port (Broadway) at $800.00 and is a candidate for orders in the Episcopal Church, and some there or four or five others who may possibly study. Out of the whole number, we may get in the end, say some four or five clergymen.\n\nAnd now for the glorious law — the foolish fond old man and his foolish friend. I make them out about twenty, of all shades, from the laborious Harry, Gray, and Willard, through Dunlap, the student of French, &c. &c. and various other gradations of down to ____ and ____. You must supply the vacancies. To save trouble, I shall give you a good old-fashioned list. Here they are then.\n\n[Timothy] Bigelow\n\n[Charles Marshall Spring] Churchill\n\n[Charles Pelham] Curtis\n\n[Thomas Joseph] Davidson\n\n[Edward] Dexter\n\n[Samuel Fales] Dunlap\n\n[Manning Ferguson] Force\n\n[Charles Henry] Glover\n\n[Frank Boott] Goodrich\n\nGray, G[eorge].\n\n[Francis William] Greenwood\n\n[John] Haslett\n\n[John Alexander] Hawes\n\n[Augustus Felix] Hinchman\n\n[John Scribner] Jenness\n\n[William] Plumer\n\n[Edward J.] Pringle\n\n[Harrison] Ritchie\n\n[Thomas] Russell\n\n[Thomas Andrew] Watson\n\n[Paul] Willard\n\n[Timothy] Bigelow is wandering about town at present. The impression is quite general that he does not know himself what he is going to do, but told me some time ago that he thought he should study somewhere in Worchester County a year and then come to the Law School.\n\n[Charles M. S.] Churchill is going, as I understand him, a voyage to the Mediterranean in a few weeks. Poor [Charles P.] Curtis is just now in a good deal of trouble and, the few times that I have seen him, appears quite an altered man. You have probably heard of his mother’s death. He and [Samuel F.] Dunlap live in Boston and come out to the lectures.\n\n[Thomas J.] Davidson is here and also [Paul] Willard, [George] Gray, and [Harry] Ritchie. Harry, in addition to his hard reading in the law, has I am told finished the Odyssey this term and is now at work on the Iliad, to say nothing of various other studies. Willard and Gray are both, I believe, hard at work — very hard — at least I can vouch for Gray.\n\nManning [Ferguson Force] is, I suppose, profiting by the debates at Washington. He has been heard from several times by Norton, so H. S. E. says. [Frank B.] Goodrich will study by and by, so also [Frank W.] Greenwood. [John N.] Jenness is supposed to be in New Hampshire where Webster began to study. [William] Plumer is here. [Edward J.] Pringle will, I believe, study in Charleston. [Thomas A.] Watson is teaching at present in Plymouth ($600.00) I think) and will study by and by. He supposes that Ritchie reads the Odyssey as ancient lore.\n\nWe have eight teaching. [Gorham] Bartlett is fitting fellows for college in Springfield. His ‘chum’ you know is at the Framingham High School. [Nicholas Emery] Soule is a private tutor in Josiah Quincy, Jr.’s family for one year. He is preparing his eldest boy for college. [James] Waldock has a fine school in Medford ($600.00, I think I was told), and there, with [Timothy Dutton] Chamberlain, [Rolla Oscar] Page, [William H.] Davison, and [Thomas A.] Watson, make up the list. There may be others, but I have not heard of them.\n\nH[orace] Gray has been heard from at Cologne. A very rainy day — could see this, couldn’t see that. Wrote a few letters in despair — not very pleasant. Quite tired of traveling with a man “who thinks just differently from you on everything.” He is supposed to be a growing gray.\n\nPeter [Porter] is probably writing sonnets to Niagara, and wasting the night in watching the moon or out watching the Bear. I believe he has found no time to write letters yet. At least if he has, I am pretty sure not more than one or two.\n\n[Edward Bromfield] Phillips is trying the water cure at Brattleboro, Vermont. If I am not mistaken, drinks thirty-six tumblers before breakfast. In connection with this, it is a curious fact that the institution has just got a charter as the Brattleboro Infirmary with a capital of $50,000. He came of age the 5th of October last and, now and then, has to come across the country here and stay a few days to take possession of his property. Some time ago, he had received five hundred thousand and at his last visit received a large additional amount. He is to sport a $125 sleigh this winter, and if my father be correct, wears an immense mustache.\n\nApropos of [Horace] Gray, his father’s great iron works near the Mill Dam that used to blaze so at night, are burned down. Apropos of the Law, John [Alexander] Hawes was tempted to study it by a very fine offer that he had of going into a good business. Wheaton, of Berlin, and Choate, for the new professorship of Common Law, are now talked of here. Apropos of this letter, there is so much nonsense in it, that I am afraid I shall not dare trust myself to read it again, and I have so much more to tell you that I shall commit the solecism of writing another to accompany it.\n\nYours truly, — T. P. R.\n\nThis letter was written by Richard Strout (1819-Aft1898), the son of Joseph Strout (1794-Aft1870) and Susan Drought (1793-1860) of Allen County, Indiana. Richard was married first to a woman named Sarah (b. 1823) and second to Jennie S. Harlow (b. 1836). He was enumerated in Defiance, Ohio in 1850. At the time that Richard wrote this letter in 1851, he was in Terre Haute, Indiana and employed as a civil engineer. In 1853, he was employed as the deputy surveyor general under General Washburn performing civil engineering reports for the government in Minneapolis, Minnesota. While there, Strout attempted to strike it rich by speculating in land but the financial panic of 1857 wiped out his dreams. [See: Richard Strout — founding father or founding failure?] He was still in Minnesota when the Civil War broke out and as a reward for raising a company of volunteers, he was commissioned as the Captain of Co. B, 9th Minnesota Infantry. He led the forces on 25 August 1862 where a large group of Dakota Indians under the command of White Spider at the Battle of Acton but his service was clouded by controversy. After the war, in 1868, Robert returned to Terre Haute where he was the City Engineer for ten years. Following that, he relocated to Atlantic, Iowa and then to Emporia, Kansas, where — as city engineer — Stout proclaimed the city’s public works to be “the best sanitary sewerage in the state of Kansas.”\n\nRichard wrote the letter to Paulding County, Ohio attorney Alexander Sankey Latty (1815-1895), the son of Robert Latty and Anne Alexander. Alexander was born in Leitrim County, Ireland. In 1833, at the age of eighteen, he immigrated to Montreal, Canada. There he took part in the Mackenzie Rebellion, 1837, (an ill-fated adventure in land and political reform; crushed with a British military intervention) and was forced to flee to the United States. He first went to New York and then to the Maumee River basin in 1837, where he oversaw the construction of section 30 of the Miami and Wabash Canal. During this time he resided around the Napoleon, Henry County, Ohio area. There in 1840 he was admitted to the Ohio Bar, one of his examiners was Morrison R. Waite, (later Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court) and later that same year Alexander moved to New Rochester, Paulding County, Ohio, at that time the county seat.\n\nThe county seat was moved to Charloe in 1841 and Alexander and his wife Eliza Melia, daughter of Anne Melia, made the move with the county government. Alexander and Eliza were the parents of four children, two of whom died in infancy, Alexander Sankey Latty and Robert Emmet Latty. Daughter Anna Maria Latty (1844-1871) went on to marry Joseph Ice (1835-1888) and son Emmet Sankey Latty (1845-1871) married Eugenia McCormick, but he died shortly after their marriage in 1871. Eliza Melia Latty, wife of Alexander, died on March 15, 1853, after long suffering the ill effects of consumption.\n\nPaulding Center (later Paulding) became the county seat in 1850 and Alexander and family once again made the move. In 1851 Paulding Township was organized and “A.S. Latty” cast one of the seventeen ballots at the first election, held in the schoolhouse at Paulding. In March 1844 Alexander became the third auditor of Paulding County and retained that position until 1856. Paulding County’s first newspaper, The Age of Progress, established by P.W. Hardesty in 1853, was purchased by Latty and renamed The Democrat. A couple of years later Alexander sold the paper to J.D. Baker who changed the name to The Republican and removed it to Defiance, Ohio.\n\nAfter the death of his first wife Alexander remarried to Rebecca Stratton (1833-1919), from Columbiana County, Ohio, on September 13, 1856. This union produced three children, Florence Alexandria Latty (1859-1906), Clara Emily Latty (1863-1943), and Edwin Alexander Latty (1865-1937). Florence married Livingston Babcock Peaslee (1851-1914) on December 5, 1877 and had one child Alexander Sankey Latty Peaslee (1878-1974).\n\nIn October 1856 Alexander was elected on the Whig ticket as Common Pleas Judge of the second subdivision of the third district, comprising at that time of Defiance, Fulton, Henry, Paulding, Putnam, Van Wert, Williams and Wood Counties; beating Democratic candidate Francis C. LeBlond by around 100 votes. He was re-elected to that office in 1861, 1866 and 1871, later becoming a Republican candidate, and holding the office for twenty years before retiring from the bench in February 1877.\n\nIn 1861 the Judge and his family moved from Paulding to Defiance where they had constructed a large pretentious home at 718 Perry Street.\n\nJudge Latty served as secretary of the Paulding and Cecil Railroad Company from 1881 until 1884, when the company was sold to the Cincinnati, Van Wert and Michigan Railway (later the New York Central Railroad). He also served as president of the Defiance Gas Works during the early 1880s. During this time he owned and operated a law firm in Defiance with several associates; one of whom was his son-in-law Livingston B. Peaslee. In 1882 the village of Latty was laid out at the junction of the Mackinaw and Nickle Plate Railroads on land owned by Alexander and named for him. Governor Joseph Foraker appointed him one of the three canal commissioners in 1883. Latty Township in Paulding County was named after him and Camp Latty, the rendezvous point for the 68th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, in Napoleon, Ohio, during the Civil War was named in his honor.\n\nJudge Alexander Sankey Latty died at noon on Thursday, May 30, 1895, at his home in Defiance, Ohio. He was laid to rest in Riverside Cemetery in Defiance. The Defiance Democrat eulogized “he was a good man and the entire community deeply regret his death.”\n\nTRANSCRIPTION\n\nAddressed to A. S. Latty, Esqr., Paulding, Paulding County, Ohio\n\nTerre Haute [Indiana]\n\nNovember 12, 1851\n\nFriend Latty\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received yours a few days after writing to you. So it is yet unanswered about the water but I think we could not be expected to build when the part or season of the year which we would mostly depend on having water would be employed in building locks and of course no water could be used. But Esqr., I am able to realize without experiment that something should be done or that part of our interest will not be profitable. I am also more sanguine in a do opinion of the piece south of [Section] 23 but if a town could build upon 23 or a mill at the lock, either would be a fair investment. I am, however, much bothered to answer your letter. I would like to have you interested on Sect. 23 in future as at the present for I think if the right effort was made, that 23 would beat any place in Paulding County in 10 years & cannot the county seat be brought there?\n\nIf you think than an effort of that kind would be of any use in some future day, I should like yourself to still hold on with me & should want you to have half of the interest in the Plat & I am sure if you think such an understanding worth while, you will feel like availing the opportunity with me. Also if you wish to abandon the Marsh excitement, I will swap my interest at the lock for yours in 23 & in the 40 acres south of 23.\n\nIf I recollect, the expense of the two interests were alike. In one view, this is better than to have so many small and individual interests — that is, in case if either of us should die, the other might be better off without so much undivided interest. Or I might say to you as you did to me, that I have no choice as to what course be taken as to the whole matter.\n\nPerhaps it would be best for you to have a deed from me for the undivided ½ on or at the lock in lieu of your ¼ in 23 & in the 40 south. If this accords with your view, we will pass the papers. Or if any other be your choice, make it known and I think I can confer with you cheerfully.\n\nOur folks are all well. Wife sends her respects to Mrs. Latty to who I would be remembered by & with yourself.\n\nRespectfully, — R. Strout\n\nThis letter was written by former Dubuque Mayor, John Thompson (1821-1901), to Capt. William Badger in Dakota in response to a proposal by Badger that would create a partnership between the two for the operation of trading post on the Dakota frontier. John Thompson’ place of birth is inconsistently reported. A biography claims he was born in Ireland but came with his parents to Erie County, Pennsylvania in 1840. Census Records indicate his birth was in Pennsylvania (1860) and New York (1870, 1880), however.] He moved to Chautauqua, New York and worked there as a harness-maker. He later (1854) moved to Galena, Illinois, and then to Dubuque, Iowa in 1857 where he went into business with Leroy D. Randall in 1861. Their partnership grew to become the largest wholesale leather and saddlery hardware business west of the Mississippi River. Thompson served Dubuque as its mayor for three terms, being unanimously re-elected by both parties without opposition for his second term. As mayor of Dubuque during the Civil War, Thompson took an active role in raising volunteers for the Union Army and enjoyed the admiration of General U.S. Grant who often dined at Thompson’s elegant Locust Street mansion. In December, 1879, General Grant was invited here as the guest of Mr. Thompson. A large procession escorted him to the residence where Governor and Mrs. Gear were present along with 700 guests.\n\nWilliam Badger (1826-1897) was born to (Governor) William and Hannah Pearson (Cogswell) Badger in Gilmanton, New Hampshire. He was an 1848 graduate of Dartmouth College and was married to Harriet A Cilley in Gilmanton on June 4, 1856. He was engaged in manufacturing before the Civil War and later served his country as Captain and Colonel of the 4th New Hampshire Volunteers from May 9, 1861-65 and the 6th U.S. Inf. until his death. He enlisted on 7/25/1861 as a Captain. On 9/20/1861 he was commissioned into “D” Co. NH 4th Infantry. He was cashiered on 6/4/1864. On 6/20/1865 he was commissioned into VV 9th Infantry. He was mustered out on 4/20/1866. During the post war period, Badger was commissioned (1866) as a Lieutenant in the 6th US Infantry and was the quartermaster at Standing Rock and Fort Rice in Dakota Territory. His son, William C. Badger, moved to North Dakota where he started a meat packing and ice business and was the proprietor of Long Lake Creek Stock Ranch. He was quartermaster at Fort Lincoln when Custer’s 7th Cavalry was stationed there at the height of the Indian Wars. He retired from the 6th Infantry in 1889.\n\n[Note: Badger has written a note on the outside of the letter indicating that it was received and answered. He has written that it it was received from “Col. John Thompson” of Dubuque. I believe the “Col” to be a salutary appellation only. To my knowledge there were no colonels (or former colonels) by that name residing in Dubuque in 1880. There was a John H. Thompson residing in Dubuque in 1880 but he was a bookseller and does not appear to have the capital resources at his disposal for such an enterprise as belonged to the former mayor. I believe John Thompson’s connections to the War Department were gained during his years as the major of Dubuque during the Civil War and his strong support for the Lincoln Administration.]\n\nTRANSCRIPTION\n\nDubuque, Iowa\n\nNovember 23, 1880\n\nCapt. Wm. Badger\n\nMy Dear Sir,\n\nYours of 14th inst. is just received and carefully read and noted. I am of the opinion if you could get your son appointed Post Trader there that it would be a good thing, and a place where considerable money could be made, if properly managed. I feel thankful to you for thinking of me in the enterprise and I can’t see any reason why I should not look favorable in it. In order to secure all the advantages arising from such an enterprise, it would be necessary to see that all goods were got from first houses — that is, to buy all goods where they could be bought for the least money and not think of buying goods in Omaha but in the Eastern Market except such goods as are raised in the West. In this case, it would take a good deal of cash capital to carry on this business. If you can succeed in getting the license or vote of the Council of Administration, I know I can get it approved in Washington if Gen’l [George] Crook is in command of your Department. I am very confident I could get his influence. Besides, I have some very warm friends in the War Department in Washington.\n\nIf you can get the vote — that is, if the Post is to be at least a six company post and a permanent one, I should like to have an interest in it and will furnish the capital that is necessary to carry it on. If we can make satisfactory arrangements with each other and if you try for it, I will prefer to have it issued jointly. Viz: William Badger & Co. or Badger & Thompson as you might elect. As I could expect to furnish the capital, of course I would expect to be in secure and sure foundation which I have no doubt you would be willing that I should.\n\nI do not have any idea of the country around you and if there is any Indiana Trader or any other trader there or around there. Settlers of course help the trader’s store and the less stores there is, the better. Also, it it anything of a mining country around there where settlers would be likely to come in?\n\nI still retain my interest with Parker in the cattle business. I had made up my mind to get out but lately I decided at Parker’s request to hold my interest with him. I think you are right to hold on to your claim in Dakota as that country is going to settle up very fast now and land all around Old Fort Rice and Standing Rock will soon become quite valuable. Please let me hear from you in receipt of this and give me your views candidly in this enterprise and if I can be carried through, I would want some little time to prepare myself to enter into it and would likely wish to take a trip out there to look the ground over and know just what goods would be necessary to get and how much &c.\n\nPlease remember me kindly to Mrs. Badger and believe me to remain yours very truly, — John Thompson\n\nThis letter was written by William Campbell, the son of emigrants Arthur Campbell (1786-1819) and Eleanor Cain (1790-18xx), who settled first in Washington County, Pennsylvania, and then in Ashland County, Ohio. The family came in two wagons by the way of Steubenville, Canton, and Wooster, and followed Beall’s trail. The Campbells built a small cabin in 1814 on Section 23, just southeast of what is now the village of Rowsburgh. William’s father was killed on 19 August 1819 by the falling of a tree.\n\nCampbell wrote the letter to his cousin, John Cain Andrews (1817-1896) of Argyle, Lafayette County, Wisconsin. John was the son of Thomas Brown Andrews of Baltimore, Maryland, and Mary (Cain) where she immigrated from Ireland in 1805. John married 1 December 1851 in Argyle, Wisconsin, to Sarah Wright, the daughter of William and Grace (Hallows) Wright. John was born at Norwalk, Ohio and died at Erwin, South Dakota.\n\nIn the letter we learn that William Campbell was married to a woman named Susan who suffered from bouts of anxiety. He tells his cousin that he was “damned fool” to have married her and that he plans to leave her in Ohio and join a party of gold seekers leaving for California in the spring of 1852. A party did leave Ashland County, Ohio, on 18 March 1852 but whether W. Campbell was among the number is not yet known. Campbell is under the impression that the party intended to fit out for their journey across the plains from St. Joseph, Missouri, and that may indeed have been the original plan. A diary written by one of the party, however, informs us that they chose instead to set out on the California Road from Westport, Missouri. This route struck the Oregon Trail from St. Joe in present day Nebraska.\n\nTRANSCRIPTION\n\nAddressed to John Andrews, Esq., Argyle, Lafayette County, Wisconsin\n\nRowsburg, Ohio\n\nJanuary the 23rd 1852\n\nJohn C. Andrews\n\nDear Cousin,\n\nYours of the 8th of January came to hand and with great pleasure I devoured its contents. And now hasten to answer it for I did not want you to never write to me for I should rather be forsaken by any of my brothers. I was glad to hear that you were all well and I was pleased to hear from my old friend Moser.\n\nNow friend John, I am a going to tell a few things. You know that I am very fickle minded and change very often. I wrote you that I was a coming to see you in May but now I think different. I have determined on going to California in the Spring. I am a going by the plains with horses and wagons. There are a good many a going from here. We will start by the 10th of March and go by the river to St. Joe which place we will leave by the 10th of April carrying feed with us to [till] the grass grows. There has several come home and they have done well and some of them are returning with their families.\n\nGarret Dorland ¹ is going back but not taking his family. G. Ship ² is a going with his family. Now John, if you ever thought of going to California, just meet me at St. Joe and go along. I should rather meet you there than any man on earth. I believe that we could do well for a man that will work can not help it.\n\nSusan’s health is good and she is better in her mind. I think that she will get well ultimately but it will be some time yet. She works some but she is very easy made anxious. She keeps house by herself. Byron is well and is now a living with his mother at home. Mother is well. Her health has been very good this winter. O’s friends are well and Arthur’s are a getting pretty well. Even is living away from home and a going to school.\n\nNow John, don’t think any good of her for she is rotten-hearted as an canker and they are meaner than the “devil” wants them. John, I should like to see you and have a good time with you and if I had time I would come and see you before I go to California. But I will come and see you when I return and if I have luck, that will be in a few short months. Then I expect to have money enough to take one darned big time and then I shall treat whither the landlord is out or not. Oh! John, if I could just but spend one day with you, I should be as happy as a young convert.\n\nI received a letter from Dan. ³ He is in Texas. He moved there about 18 months ago. He is in Fannin County upon Red River. Old Tom Lortans and near all the connection are there. And from what he wrote to me, he must be very much afraid of hell for nearly all his letters was passages from the scriptures. He gave me one hell of a lecture. I wrote to him to send me a damned old testament so that I could read for myself. Now John, just let me tell you that Dan has got to be a complete damned old Domanician Monk and I would go five miles to see him for he has got to be a perfect damned fool and is not sensible of his misery. I wish to God that he would move to Florida clear down on the point so as he could het heaven by water and that would be an easier way than getting there with groans for he is one dang hypocrite, sure. If I did not despise him, I would hate him.\n\nJohn: Love with all but wed with none, for I never saw one days pleasure since I made a damned fool of myself.\n\nNow John, if you can meet at St. Joe. Give my love to all my friends and tell them I should like to see them and take them by the hand. And I am may every, yours truly — W. Campbell\n\nP.S. Write soon. I shall write to you from St. Joe. I will go by the Salt Lake if I can for I want to see the Dr. very much and the women &c. &c. Bill unchanged.\n\n¹ Garret Dorland (1804-Aft1860) was married to Elizabeth S. __ (18xx-1859). He was one of 101 Ashland and Wayne County men who departed for California from the Dorland home in March 1852. The story of the journey can be found in the diary of George W. King (see below). I believe the 40 or so men from Ashland County formed themselves into the “Mohican Gold Company” and were led by Joseph Smith.\n\n² This was George Shipp (1815-1897) of Perry, Ashland County, Ohio. He was married to Virlinda Hoy (1826-1853) and had two young children in 1850. In the spring of 1852, in company with a hundred men, he started overland for California, taking with him two hundred head of cattle and a number of horses. They were five months on the road. After his arrival in California he engaged in stock raising, and remained two years, when he returned to Ohio and lived until 1856, when he came to Hamilton County, Iowa. Virlinda died in Marysville, Yuba County, California, in 1853.\n\n³ Could this be Dan Campbell and possibly a brother? There is a Dan Campbell (1809-Aft1870) residing in Perry Township, Ashland County, Ohio in the 1870 Census who is enumerated in the household of 49 year-old Julia Campbell. He is recorded as Deaf & Dumb. [Note: Curiously the Fannin County, Texas Marriage Records show a William Campbell, Jr. marrying a Susannah Voiles on 23 September 1850. It isn’t clear from this letter that William ever lived in Texas, however.]\n\nDiary of George W. King\n\n[Note: George W. King traveled with the party to Salt Lake City but was left behind there to recover from his illness. He had to finish his journey to California in the Spring on 1853. After leaving King in Salt Lake City, the party continued to California and arrived there in mid-September 1852. Another member of that party, Burtis Bayless, kept a journal during this overland journey and he makes no mention of Campbell in his journey either. See Trip to California in 1852]\n\nMarch 17, 1852. Left home in company with cousin Fredrick F. King bound for California. My feelings were such only as can be realized by those who have left their home and friends, and started from a distant country perhaps never to return. Four o’clock P.M. arrived at Rowsburg. (My cousin lost his purse and all his money and consequently I lost his company to the land of gold.)\n\nMarch 18, 1852. Joined the company and started on our journey. Arrived at Wooster feeling rather down in the mouth. I met two of my former acquaintances, John Spencer and Ervin Cathrite. I considered myself a great way from home and was glad to see them.\n\nMarch 19, 1852. Parted with my friends and resumed our journey. Arrived at Massillon in the evening. While at this place after some reflection I came to the conclusion that the train of sober thoughts, that I had indulged myself in about home friends and girls that I left behind, would never do for me, but that I must hold up my head and be more cheerful or I should surely get homesick before I got out of the State of Ohio.\n\nMarch 20, 1852. Took the cars for Rochester on the Ohio river; arrived at 6 o’clock in the evening. Had a pleasant ride.\n\nMarch 21, 1852. Went to church. Wrote to Henry Brent and climbed some of the highest hills and looked towards home.\n\nMarch 22, 1852. Spent today reading and strolling about the city.\n\nMarch 23, 1852. Still in Rochester waiting for a boat; reading a little and practicing a little with my gun in order to be a dead shot at an Ingine [sic] when I get onto the plains.\n\nMarch 24, 1852. Left Rochester on the Steamer Statesman.\n\nMarch 25, 1852. Arrived at Wheeling at 2 o’clock P.M. and I went on shore. Arrived at Marietta about noon. Marietta is situated at the Muskingum River. At 3 P.M. I went on shore at Parkersburg, Virginia, at the mouth of the little Kenahwa River.\n\nMarch 26, 1852. Arrived at Portsmouth on the Scioto; it is a beautiful little place. At 3 P.M. arrived at Cincinnati. There met with George Houser on his way to California. Passed the tomb of Harrison in the evening.\n\nMarch 28, 1852. Stopped at Evansville about two hours.\n\nMarch 29, 1852. At noon we are now passing out of the Ohio into the Mississippi. Here the waters of the Great Mississippi and the little muddy Fork meet. Great meeting place this. Apple trees are in full bloom. Cairo is situated on the right bank of the Ohio River at its mouth in the state of Illinois. 6 o’clock P.M. we are now 80 miles from Cairo up the Mississippi. The river 1 ½ miles wide here. I have now been in eight different states of the Union since I left home, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, Tennessee, Missouri. I now weigh five pounds less than when I left home.\n\nMarch 30, 1852. (days & dates sometimes confused). Rainy this morning. We are not fifty miles from St. Louis.\n\nMarch 31, 1852. Arrived at St. Louis at three o’clock A.M. Stopped at the Gen. Taylor House. Went to the theater in the evening.\n\nApril 1, 1852. In St. Louis yet. We are to leave for St. Joseph this evening. Read an advertisement in the morning paper of “Slaves for Sale, Martha and her five children.”\n\nApril 2, 1852. In St. Louis yet. There are a great many Californians here.\n\nApril 3, 1852. Still in St. Louis. Went to the Court House to see five human beings sold the highest bidder. The best abolition lecture I have ever heard. This evening at 6 o’clock the steamer Glencoe collapsed, a fire killing 25 or 30 people besides many who were mortally wounded. The boat floated down the levy in flames with wretched beings on board, crying for help. They were nearly all lost. At a distance of half a mile from where the explosion took place the boat burned to the waters edge and sank. Some ten or fifteen wood and wharf boats took fire from her as she passed along down and were burned. I saw one man who was thrown to the distance of several rods. He was literally torn to pieces, while the limbs of others were strewn around in all directions.\n\nApril 4, 1852. Visited the scene of the explosion the evening before, the decks of two or three boats on either side of where the Glencoe lay were literally strewn with the limbs and blood of… hospital and saw some of those who were killed, it was a horrid sight. There they lay hushed in the silence of death; while the living were trying to recognize, by some ornament or dress, their friends among the bodies, heads and limbs, which in some cases were not to be found. It was heart rending to see the grief of those who discovered the remains of friends in the group. I saw one poor woman who found the lifeless bodies of her husband and son. Her grief overcame her and she sat down on the floor beside them, buried her face in her hands and wept—most bitterly. Poor woman.\n\nLeft St. Louis at 9 o’clock for Independence, on the steamer St. Arge.\n\nApril 5, 1852. We are now [on the Missouri River] one hundred miles from St. Louis.\n\nApril 6, 1852. Stopped at Jefferson City, the capital of the state of Missouri. The state house is a beautiful building situated on an eminence on the bank of the river and commands a view of the river and town. The State’s prison is ¾ mile below on another rise of ground. We went ¾ of a mile out of town and had a good time shooting wild turkeys. Laid in Jefferson until morning, the river being full of floating logs and chunks of ice.\n\nApril 7, 1852. Left Jefferson early this A.M. Passed a boat too while her passengers were burying the corpse of a Californian. Poor fellow, he found a resting place far from his home and a long way from his intended destination.\n\nApril 8, 1852. Broke down and laid in Roachport all day. I went hunting in company with my friend, James Cronemiller; had a fine time.\n\nApril 9, 1852. Was called upon to watch with one of our company, Mr. Cleland of New Haven. He was consigned to a lonely grave far from home and in a strange land. He left a wife and two children. Left Roachport at 9 o’clock run into Boonville; heard that the steamer Saluda was blown up at Lexington. From 75 to 100 lives lost. This afternoon saw trunks floating down from the wreck.\n\nApril 10, 1852. Heard from the Saluda this morning. All the officers and most of the passengers lost. The passengers were mostly Mormons.\n\nApril 11, 1852. Stopped at Lexington at 10 o’clock. Visited for half hour, the wreck of the Saluda. It was indeed a heart-rending sight. Twenty-three had been buried, a still larger number were missing, forty or fifty were in a house close by, some mortally wounded, some slightly. But five escaped unhurt. A large pile of coffins made of coarse boards were lying by the door for those who should die of their wounds.\n\nApril 12, 1852. Landed at Wayne City, four miles from Independence. We went two miles into the country and pitched our tents. This was my first experience in pitching tents and camping out. I volunteered to stand guard the first night and armed and equipped I went forth to watch for Ingines while others slept.\n\nApril 13, 1852. Sent to Independence. It is a town of about three thousand inhabitants, situated four miles from the river in a beautiful country. Returned to camp at noon. Wrote to R. J. King in the afternoon and went hunting.\n\nTuesday 14. Wrote letters and hunted.\n\nWednesday 15. Hunted and wrote letters.\n\nThursday 16. A letter to Miss S.\n\nFriday 17. Thought of home two hours, stood it well.\n\nSunday 18. Attended meeting in the grove.\n\nMonday 19. Went to Wayne City. Hunted in the afternoon.\n\nTuesday 20. Moved 15 miles south of Independence and encamped at dark.\n\nWednesday 21. Went hunting.\n\nThursday 22. Wrote letters and hunted.\n\nFriday 23. Wrote to Elizann and Mary Jane.\n\nSaturday 24. Hunted and fished, one of our men got homesick, backed off the course and went home. Some man that.\n\nSunday 25. Attended church and read.\n\nMonday 26. Wrote letters and hunted. Killed lots of game.\n\nTuesday 27. Herded cattle in the forenoon and was sick in the afternoon.\n\nApril 28, 1852. Had a regular built deer. Saw twenty and never killed one. Returned to the camp at night, tired and hungry.\n\nApril 29, 1852. Joined a mess consisting of George Houser, Mark Slonacker, James Benton, Allen Graves, Lewis Graves, Rolland Lewis, David Johnson, and myself.\n\nApril 30, 1852. Staid in the tent and read novels.\n\nMay 1, 1852. Went hunting with others, killed one deer and went home.\n\nMay 2, 1852. Worked all day making preparations for crossing the plains.\n\nMay 3, 1852. Still preparing to start. I am anxious to be on the way. A great many emigrants passing daily for Oregon and California. Some pretty girls. They remind me of the girls I left behind me when I look at them.\n\nMay 4, 1852. Making preparations for starting in the morning. Feel first rate.\n\nMay 5, 1852. Lost cattle and did not get off today. Wrote letters to friends.\n\nMay 6, 1852. Played ball, shot at mark, and strolled round the camp today. Our officers were elected at evening.\n\nMay 7, 1852. Yet in camp, rigging our traps for a start in the morning.\n\nMay 8, 1852. Left our old campground [twelve miles west of Fort Independence with 27 wagons, 125 yolk of oxen, 50 cows, 25 horses, & 104 men & 5 women] and started for the plains. All well. Forded the Big Blue River at 3 o’clock [near Kansas City]. Camped [two miles beyond] on the line of the Indian territory after dark. Saw two graves today. Read the inscription. The names were Isaac and Alexander Paxton, died May 6th and 7th, 1847. I did not learn their history but suppose they were Cal. Emigrants, which supposition naturally made me reflect that I too might find a resting place on the lonely plains. Stood guard for the first time out of the U. States. Had a cold wet time.\n\nMay 9, 1852. Laid by today. Lots of Indians about our camp. Can see Californians in all directions on the prairie.\n\nMay 10, 1852. Took an affectionate farewell of the States, and traveled on busy with my thoughts. Passed a grave at noon, with E. Ives inscribed on the rough stone at the head, leaving the traveler to conjecture the history of him who lies there. Soon after passed three conical piles of stone about 20 ft high. At 3 o’clock passed a newly made grave without a stone to mark the place. Traveled 15 miles today and pitched our tents in the rain. It rained until after dark.\n\nMay 11, 1852. Rolled out early this morning and through a beautiful country and encamped at night on Coon Creek [Bull Creek]. I was very unwell all day. I feel better this evening. Rained nearly all day. Hard time this.\n\nMay 12, 1852. Rolled out this morning early. At 7 o’clock one of my mess mates, Allen Graves got entangled with his team and was thrown down. Two of the wheels of the wagon passed over his body, breaking one or more of his ribs, besides other injuries. We drove eight miles and encamped on the east side of the Wakaroosha [Wakarusa] river [southeast of present day Lawrence], it being too high to ford. There are one thousand emigrants laying here.\n\nMay 13, 1852. Making preparations for crossing the river. Fishing, hunting and other amusements.\n\nMay 14, 1852. Started at daylight, forded the river, got across by noon, all safe and sound. I stood in the water three hours. Traveled eight miles and encamped. Saw a boy today, eighteen years of age on his way to Cal. with no other companion than a black cow. Courageous boy that. He is from Hillsdale, Michigan. (I saw a man the other day who saw him almost in Cal. with the same old black cow. This Oct. 7, 1852.)\n\nMay 15, 1852. Started early this morning made a good days drive through a beautiful country. Passed a grave today at noon. H. Dutton was written on the stone at the head. He was from Ohio. It had been but a few days since he was buried. His clothes were lying by the grave. Met some men on their return home. Their teams had been stolen, and they obliged to go back. Bad luck that. I went out to herd this evening in a severe thunder storm. Soon after dark our cattle got frightened and broke and ran in all directions. Myself and others went in search of them. Found more wolves than cattle. Found some of our cattle but could not find our camp again. We fired guns and was answered by the company, so that we found our way back at 11 o’clock, tired and sleepy. Great times these.\n\nMay 16, 1852. Found the rest of our cattle this morning. Reached the Kaw or Kansas river at three o’clock, and camped [could not cross on account of the trains ahead]. I am out herding this evening, am riding on a little knowl by an Indian trail and as I am writing there is a company of Indians riding their ponies along one after the other with their blankets on. Curious specimen of humanity they. We passed some high hills today. I climbed the highest and took a view, wrote my name on a stone by others written in 1849, 1850, 1851, and 1852. Then ran down on the opposite side to that. I climbed at break-neck speed, but while I was there the wind blew my hat off and started the buttons on my coat. Went to meeting at a missionary station. Saw some pretty Indian girls, there, that’s so. The text was in John 3, Chap. 36 verse.\n\nMay 17, 1852. Started for the river at sunrise and began to ferry at ten o’clock. One of the boats sank. It was scratching times for the passengers to get out of the river. One boy was nearly drowned. We were all across at sunset, all tired and hungry. We encamped one mile from the river. We are now among the Kaw Indians. We have passed the Canuck nation.\n\nMay 18, 1852. Rolled out this morning early, traveled through the Patawatomie nation today. They are at war with the Pawnees. They had a battle a few days since. We saw some of their wounded and prisoners. We hoisted our flag yesterday before crossing the river. The Indians told us that we would have to take it down before we got among the Pawnees for they would not allow the American flag to pass through their territory. Some of the company were for taking it down, but the majority said “keep it up.” So we did. Several of our men are sick today. [Traveled 20 miles along the Kansas River bottoms & encamped on Prospect Hill overlooking the river.]\n\nMay 19, 1852. Rolled out this morning in good time, made a good days drive. Crossed the Vermillion river at noon. Encamped for night in the Pawnee territory. I stood guard. Passed another grave today.\n\nMay 20, 1852. Made a good days drive today. Passed a grave this afternoon. Encamped about four o’clock. Rained all night.\n\nMay 21, 1852. Still raining this morning. Laid by till noon on account of the rain. Met a man today on his return to the States. He is from Illinois. He has been 300 miles out from St. Joseph. He says that the emigrants are dying by hundreds.\n\nMay 22, 1852. Started out this morning feeling pretty well considering the rainy night we had. We all got a decent wetting. We are now within seven miles of the Big Blue river. We crossed the Big Vermillion yesterday in the afternoon. Crossed the [Big Blue] river this afternoon. Traveled six miles farther and encamped. We passed a grave today. We have traveled in sight of trains on the St. Joseph road this afternoon.\n\nMay 23, 1852. Rolled out at 8 o’clock this morning. Reached the junctions of Independence and St. Joe roads about ten o’clock. Traveled 12 miles and encamped. We have not been out of sight of emigrants trains wither in front or behind today. I was told by a man from St. Joseph that there are more than one hundred newly made graves between here and that place.\n\nMay 24, 1852. Laid by today, having a man too sick to travel.\n\nMay 25, 1852. We were stampeded this morning at 3 o’clock by the Indians. Our cattle broke through the corral breaking every spoke but one in five wagon wheels. We repaired our wagons and found our cattle, and were ready for a start by four o’clock P.M., leaving one wagon behind. I went out with four others this forenoon, hunting Indians. We saw their tracks, but no Indians. We started at 5 o’clock, fell in with company today, about as large as ours. They had lost 18 of their men since they left St. Joseph. We encamped at ten o’clock.\n\nMay 26, 1852. Rolled out early this morning, traveled ten miles in the forenoon. Saw ten graves. Saw two graves this afternoon. Encamped at four o’clock. I stood guard and watched Indians while others slept.\n\nMay 27, 1852. Rolled out early this morning. Saw three graves this forenoon and three more at noon in one place and two in another and passed three more at night. Crossed the Big Sandy today and encamped at dark two miles from the Little Blue. I am quite unwell this evening.\n\nMay 28, 1852. Rolled out at 7 o’clock this morning. Traveled up the little Blue river all day. Took a swim at noon. Passed six graves today. Met part of a train consisting of four wagons on their return to Kentucky. They lost two men with the cholera this morning, got homesick and turned their faces towards home, sweet home. The Little Blue is four rods wide. The Big Blue eight rods wide. We are encamped at four o’clock in a beautiful place on the river bank. I saw an Indian since dark lurking about our camp. He ran like wolf when he saw me. Retired this evening tired and sleepy.\n\nMay 29, 1852. Now comes the hardest part of my journal, as yet. This morning at three o’clock I was called up to attend to one of our mess who was taken with the cholera an hour before. He grew worse until eleven o’clock, when he died. I attended to him until he died, an unpleasant task. At 9 o’clock his brother was taken with the cholera. He went to the cot where his dying brother lay and told him to keep up good courage, that he would soon be with him, for he was now going to lay down to die. He did lay down and never got up again. He died at 9 o’clock P.M. We buried him by moon light, beside his brother. It was indeed a solemn scene. Their names were Allen D. and Lewis D. Graves, from Lorain Co., Ridgeville, Ohio. Their ages were 26 and 23. One of them was engaged to be married on his return to Ohio. Allen was just recovering from the injuries received from the wagon running over him. We buried them about 20 miles from the point where we struck the Little Blue in a large bend in the river on a rise of ground, about twenty rods from the river. A beautiful but lonely place to be buried. An elm tree stands at the head of the graves. We listened to some appropriate remarks on each occasion by the Rev. R. W. Wolcott, and appropriate hymns were sung. When we consider the several relations of this company, away from parents, away from wives, away from children, away from brothers and sisters, away from friends and away from home surrounded by wild beast and still wilder Indians, a burial by moonlight in this lonely place is the most awfully solemn scene that I have ever witnessed. Several of the company are sick. I am unwell myself.\n\nMay 30, 1852. Rolled out this morning leaving out two unfortunate boys consigned to their last lonely resting place. Drove about 15 miles. Found a grave today where a man was buried who was found shot and stabbed with a knife. Listened to a sermon this evening by the [Methodist preacher] Rev. A. Price.\n\nMay 31, 1852. Traveled 18 miles today. Saw antelope and other game in the distance. I have been very unwell today. Rode in a wagon all day, a hard place indeed for a sick man. Saw several graves today. I think that were all the graves close by the road, we might have counted as many as we have traveled miles for the last two weeks. It seems like traveling through a grave yard.\n\nJune 1, 1852. Reached the Platte [River] and encamped on that beautiful stream. It is one mile wide at this place. Wrote a letter to R. J. King this evening.\n\nJune 2, 1852. Reached Ft. Kearney; stopped about two hours; found a letter there, C. L. King, the first that I have received from any of my relatives since leaving home. I valued it more than all the letters I ever received before. We encamped two miles from the fort.\n\nJune 3, 1852. Rode back to the fort this morning to deposit in the Post Office the money received for the effects of the Graves boys, which I had sold at public sale according to their request and the money sent to their friends. One of our company — Nathan Blue — was taken to the fort, not being able to go ahead. M. Hall and Wm. Switzer stayed with him. I learned that a man died with the cholera at the fort last night. I overtook the train at noon. The property of the Graves boys was sold last evening at auction. Guns that were $14 and $18 were sold for $3.50 and $6.25 and other property at proportion. The property fetched $62.80.\n\nJune 4, 1852. Traveled up the river 20 miles today and encamped for the night.\n\nJune 5, 1852. Traveled twenty miles today. Switzer and Hall came up with the train this evening\n\n– they left Blue worse; poor fellow, he will probably die.\n\nJune 6, 1852. Traveled ten miles and laid by. We are to have preaching this evening. There were two men buried close by us today; died with cholera. Five o’clock; wonder what the folks are doing in Jackson. Saw a pretty girl trudging along today toward California barefoot; was glad that it was none of the Ohio girls of my acquaintance. I have now been sick one week; feel quite well today.\n\nJune 7, 1852. Started early this morning. I took a tramp today away from the train; got very tired before I overtook it again. Met a train of three wagons returning home on account of sickness; poor spunk that. Traveled twenty miles today.\n\nJune 8, 1852. Laid by today, expecting one of our men — Thomas Pauling — would die; and to rest the sick men. Some ten or fifteen of us took a hunt today. Killed an antelope.\n\nJune 9, 1852. Thomas Pauling still living. We rolled out and left him with his mess of eight men. Poor fellow. We shall probably never see him again. Met three men on their return to the States. They were all that were left of a train of nine, six having died with the cholera. They were sober looking men. Drove ten miles and stopped to bait and take dinner. Just as we were starting out after dinner we found a man lying on the ground; he had been taken sick and his company had deserted him; and left him to die. We took him up and got him into a wagon and took him along. At two o’clock, we left two more of our wagons, one of the mess having taken the cholera. Saw four this morning. They are the first that I have seen. Our cholera man came up this evening. He is no better.\n\nJune 10, 1852. I have stood guard since twelve o’clock. When I came in I found that Mr. Chamberlain had died. He was fifty-five years old. We buried him and started out at eight o’clock A.M. Drove two miles and forded the South Platt. The river is one mile wide here. While we were crossing, the boys that we left with Pauling came up. Pauling died yesterday at two o’clock P.M. I sat up with one of my mess, Mark Slonacher. There are two of our mess mates are sick, Slonacker [sic] and Benton. Hard time these.\n\nJune 11, 1852. Drove twenty miles today. Three of the boys are very sick.\n\nJune 12, 1852. Laid by until two o’clock to rest our sick boys. We think two of them will die.\n\nJune 13, 1852. Drove till two o’clock P.M. and laid by. We passed through Ash Hollow. Saw ten graves, five in one place; four new ones.\n\nJune 14, 1852. Our sick boys getting worse. Drove ten miles this forenoon. Charles Burdett died at one o’clock P. M. Poor fellow. We buried him on the lonely plains and started on.\n\nJune 15, 1852. Laid in the wagon all day, very sick.\n\nJune 16, 1852. I felt some better today. We are now in sight of Scott’s Court House or Scott’s Rock [Court House Rock]; it looks very much like the state house in Jefferson City. The Chimney Rock can be seen in the distance; it is said to be forty files from here. Started out after dinner and drove one mile; when Miss Eldridge was taken with the cholera. Eight of the company besides myself stopped with her. Now one o’clock P.M. Don’t think Esther will live till morning. She cramps very badly.\n\nJune 17, 1852. Our sick woman is better this morning; don’t cramp anymore. Drove from 3 o’clock till 12 at night and camped opposite the Chimney Rock. Our patient still gaining.\n\nJune 18, 1852. Mr. Hall and myself walked 3 miles to the Chimney [Rock] before breakfast, and ascended it 250 feet, and registered our names as high as we could get. The summit was yet 200 feet above our heads. We drove 20 miles to Scotts Bluff which are 800 feet above the river. After passing the Bluffs we were in sight of our train again 8 miles ahead. We overtook them at sunset. We encamped close by an Indian battlefield.\n\nJune 19, 1852. Drove 20 miles today. Our sick man getting worse.\n\nJune 20, 1852. Drove within 4 miles of Ft. Laramie and encamped for the night. I went to the Ft. and found no letters. I felt disappointed. I watched with our sick man, and wrote letters to H. Bunt. Went to bed at 12 o’clock and dreamed of sweet home, and sweeter girls.\n\nJune 22, 1852. Drove 20 miles over the Black Hills. A cold day.\n\nJune 23, 1852. Drove half a day and laid by. Took a tramp in the afternoon among the hills. Climbed one five hundred feet high and looked down on the Platt, where it was winding its way through the hills and rocks which were five hundred feet high on either side; nearly perpendicu- lar.\n\nJune 24, 1852. Drove 22 miles today. Saw quantity of game – deer, antelope, elk, wolves, and bear. Small pox ahead.\n\nJune 25, 1852. Drove through among the bluffs today. Stopped at an Indian town. Saw a squaw roasting a dog for eating. Delicate entertainment that. Saw a notice warning emigrants to be on their guard against the Indians for they were killing men and stealing cattle ahead. Drove thirty miles and camped after dark.\n\nJune 26, 1852. Saw three buffalos today. Our boys killed one of them. We crossed the Platt today for the last time. We all got across safe. I was taken sick this afternoon with the Mountain Fever.\n\nHere will be almost a blank in my journal although the most important part of my life. It has now been two months since I was taken sick. I was hauled over four hundred miles in a wagon to Salt Lake City, where we arrived the 26 of July; one month after I was taken sick. Here the company left me but just alive; not expecting that I could live many days at most, and those who took care of me in the City; for many days were looking for each hour to be my last. But thank God, I am living yet. Four weeks after I was left I was able to sit up and get about a little. In four weeks more I thought myself able to work a little. Consequently, I engaged to tend mason for what wages I could earn. Several of our boys died while I was sick. We passed two graves at the South Pass, where two men were buried — one had been murdered, and the murderer had been hung. They were buried close together.\n\nAugust 30, 1852. Wrote a few lines at a time until I had got a short letter written to R. I. King. From August 30 to the 15 of September – nothing worthy of note happened in my life or circumstances except that I was here among 40,000 Mormons gaining my health and strength rapidly. Wrote to my brother 30 of August.\n\nSeptember 16, 1852. Commenced work.\n\nSeptember 17, 1852. Tended mason.\n\nSeptember 18, 1852. Tended mason today. It goes rather hard.\n\nSeptember 19, 1852. Spent today in reading. Quite unwell today.\n\nSeptember 26, 1852. Worked four and ½ days last week. Feel very unwell today, to be better soon. Spent yesterday and today writing to Miss S. and Miss M. and R. I. King and Henry Bunt.\n\nSeptember 27 and 28, 1852. Wrote to Miss M. and brother Ira King.\n\nOctober 3, 1852. Read Mormonism and news. Worked two and ½ days last week. Spent the remainder in studying philosophy and grammar.\n\nOctober 6, 1852. Attended church today and heard the Mormon preach. Since I have been here I have witnessed several excitations of speaking in unknown tongues. Well now, I think they are unknown tongues, for I do not think the Devil himself could interpret them. Notwithstanding, I believe him to be the author of them. The speaker generally pretends to interpret the tongue he speaks. They mostly predict the downfall of the U. States and the upbuilding of Mormonism.\n\nOctober 10, 1852. Worked four days this week. Gaining strength fast.\n\nOctober 11, 1852. Attended church.\n\nOctober 17, 1852. Copied journal today, attend meeting in the evening, more speaking in “Tongues and healing the sick” and worked other miracles. Great times among these “Latter day Saints” in “these latter days.”\n\nOctober 18, 1852. Commenced work on Cottonwood Canal.\n\nOctober 24, 1852. Wrote to Cousin Wm. King; copied journal; took a ramble on the mountains; rolled down rocks, had lots of fun.\n\nOctober 31, 1852. Climbed the mountains with two other men. We ascended above the clouds and stood in two feet of snow ten thousand feet above the ocean. Had 20 Englishmen to look after last week. Get along finely with the Canal and Englishmen too. Yesterday wrote letters to R. J. & C. S. King.\n\nNovember 7, 1852. Snowing and raining all day. Canal progressing finely. British all feel lively and work well. I am going to meeting this evening, and I intend to see some pretty Mormon girl home or get the mitten, that so. Ten o’clock in the evening. Got the mitten by thunder. Ten thousand wolves about our camp howling as though H—l had broken loose. My Mormon friend R. W. Wolcott was married to Miss —- two weeks ago today. I have not heard from home yet. Dreamt of home, and of a regular time, a perfect heaven of a time, with my two cousins Eliza Ann and Mary Jane, but I awoke this morning to myself one thousand miles from anywhere and several thousand miles from those two kind friends. Ah well.\n\nNovember 16, 1852. One week has passed since I have written any in this little book. I am one week nearer Eternity, and no nearer California than when I wrote before. I oftener think of the latter than the former place. I am quite unwell, and don’t know but I may start for heaven sooner than for California. If I do, shan’t pack nor drive an ox team, that’s so. It is raining today and I have nothing else to do but think of the girls in Ohio, (heaven bless them) and after thinking awhile I think that I think all the world of them but when I compare them with a little Angel who lives here and think how clever she is to me, I find I don’t like the Ohio girls at all. Such is human nature. I don’t know what may happen. I wish I did. I have known men to marry three or four women all at once here. Query, would it be right for me to marry one?\n\nNovember 24, 1852. Climbed the mountain, wrote letters, and attended meeting in the evening.\n\nNovember 28, 1852. Wrote to C.S. and Ira King. I have received no letters yet.\n\nDecember 5, 1852. Had a heavenly time with the girls last night, feel first rate today. Storming.\n\nDecember 12, 1852. Attended church.\n\nDecember 16, 1852. Two men killed by an avalanche, more unknown.\n\nDecember 19, 1852. Attended church today. Stayed with Mr. Pierce.\n\nDecember 22, 1852. Company dispersed from canal today.\n\nDecember 23, 1852. Laid in camp, the snow 18 inches.\n\nDecember 25, 1852. Took a sleigh ride. A merry Christmas this, good sleighing.\n\nDecember 26, 1852. Attended church. Heard Governor Young speak.\n\nJanuary 1, 1853. Worked all day. Rainy. Rather gloomy for a new years holiday.\n\nJanuary 2, 1853. Spent today in reading and writing and thinking of the girls at home. Don’t see why they don’t write to me. They said they would. I wonder if my friends in Ohio had a merry Christmas and a happy commencement of a new year. I hope they did. Again I wonder what they would think if they knew that I had camped out from September until Christmas in a hut as far north as Ashland County, Ohio. Part of the time the snow from 18 to 20 inches deep.\n\nJanuary 9, 1853. Spent the day reading.\n\nJanuary 16, 1853. Spent today copying journal and reading, studying philosophy D. C. Nothing from home yet. It is useless for me to think of home and friends so much. They don’t think of me. I don’t expect any letters.\n\nJanuary 26, 1853. Left Great Salt Lake City for Toole Valley. Spent one month there and returned to the City.\n\nMarch 1, 1853. Took a bath in Great Salt Lake. Water very cold. Found myself a Joe Smith. I could walk on the water too. I soon found my heels out and head under and my eyes full of salt.\n\nMarch 14, 1853 – Wrote letter to C. L. King.\n\nMarch 15, 1853 – Wrote letter to R. J. King.\n\nMarch 16, 1853 – Wrote letter to Miss M— and Sophronia.\n\nMarch 22, 1853 – Pd. My tithing one tenth of all I had.\n\nMarch 27, 1853 – Took a hunt on the mountain had a good time.\n\nMarch 30, 1853 – Again set my face towards California. Drove 10 miles to G. S. L. City.\n\nMarch 31, 1853 – Left G. S. L. City. Traveled ten miles and encamped for the night.\n\nApril 1, 1853 – Drove 15 miles and crossed the Weber river at the ford.\n\nApril 2, 1853 – Names of the members of the company in which I left G. S. L. city: Wm. Roger, G. Greeley, G. W. King, Lewis Taylor, James Wilson, Oscar Greeley.\n\nApril 3, 1853 – Drove to Augden [Ogden] River and encamped at noon.\n\nApril 4, 1853 – Drove ten miles and encamped. The snow on the mountain cools our ardor for traveling fast.\n\nApril 5, 1853 – Was overtaken today by a man who accused my friend Taylor and myself of driving off cattle. He staid with us over night and returned the next day to the city, satisfied that we knew nothing of his cattle.\n\nApril 6, 1853 – Crossed the Box Elder River and encamped by two graves which makes it look like the Plains again. One was an Indean [sic] grave, the other a young man’ s who was killed, Charles Philleps, with a club. We are now 65 miles from G.S.L. city encamped in the last Mormon settlement, 20 miles from Bear River.\n\nApril 7, 1853 – Rolled out and drove ten miles and encamped for the night.\n\nApril 8, 1853 – Rolled on to the river and crossed all safe and sound at dark.\n\nApril 9, 1853 – Drove to the Molad [sic] river three miles from Bear river and ferried it. All across at dark.\n\nApril 10, 1853 – Drove 4 miles and laid by to explore the mountains to see what the prospect was for getting through the canyon, as we are the first train on the road, we expect to find lots of snow. We are the Pioneers of 1853 for California.\n\nApril 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, 1853 – Laid by playing ball and other amusements to pass the time, elected our Capt., etc.\n\nApril 16, 1853 – Rolled out and drove 18 miles and encamped at the Hot Springs.\n\nApril 17, 1853 – Rolled out and drove 15 miles. Came within sight of Salt Lake twice today. Stormy this evening.\n\nApril 18, 1853 – Rolled out and drove 14 miles to deep creek.\n\nApril 19, 1853 – Drove to a spring on the mountain side. Indians can be seen lurking around us in all directions and as I am officer of the Indian Guard, I have doubled the guard for the night. We don’t mean to be taken by surprise.\n\nApril 20, 1853 – Drove 15 miles to Stony Creek. We have our last view of Salt Lake from this place. The Lake from this place looks beautiful and grand.\n\nApril 21, 1853 – Laid by today in consequence of the snow falling, which is now 6 or 8 in. deep. Hard times these on the Gentiles.\n\nApril 22, 1853 – Still in camp, the snow is disappearing fast.\n\nApril 23, 1853 – Drove to Decasure Creek and encamped for the night.\n\nApril 24, 1853 – Rolled out and drove to the ford, had a hard time crossing, encamped at the foot of the Goose creek Mountain.\n\nApril 25, 1853 – Drove over the mountain today, stormy all day, snow six inches deep at night. These are decidedly hard times, but if one has the right kind of sand in his gizzard it don’t make him home sick, though one may think of home often.\n\n[missing page]\n\nMay 3, 1853 – …. the head waters of the Humbolt or St. Marys river. The captain and one of the men have got in a row and the Capt. threatens to leave him but the majority of the company says that he can’t be left. There are now 35 Indians in camp, pretty well armed with bows and arrows, and several rifles that they get off the emigrants. There is but 22 of us and we apprehend some trouble from them tonight. They will not take us by surprise for we are a wide-awake set of fellows. There is not probably 3 white men within 200 miles of us.\n\nMay 4, 1853 – Rolled out and drove 8 miles and crossed the south branch of the river and encamped. Indians in all directions. Scally [sic] times these.\n\nMay 5, 1853 – Rolled out and drove to the middle fork and encamped. Indians, antelope, and wolves are the principal game. There is a trading post and ferry kept here by a Mormon Mountaineer.\n\nMay 6, 1853 – Ferried the river this morning, all across safe at 12 and all drunk but myself, and wholly unfit for defense if attacked by Indians. We are now among the Diger or Gosawich Indians, the most hostile between Mo. and Cal. Drove 8 miles and encamped, the men getting sobered down but all very courageous and for fighting Indians, and not one in sight. I have just been out three miles from camp to kill an antelope and got chased in by Indians. We are now close by where two men were killed in a scourge with the Indians. Ten of the Indians were killed. We have two men in our company who were engaged in the fight. I stood guard last night.\n\nMay 7, 1853 – Rolled out this morning and drove to the north fork of Marys river and forded it. The water ran into our wagons over the top of the horses. Deep fording this. At ten o’clock A.M., I read on a board at the head of a grave the following short but sad inscription: Samuel Oliver, Shot while on guard, Sept. 15, 1852, Just at daylight, by an Indian, From Wis., Aged 29 years.\n\nMay 8, 1853 – Drove 18 miles. I had an antelope chase, but killed none. One of our men shot an Indian. I guess in a brawl. One year ago today I bid good bye to civilization and started across the plains, expecting to see California in a few months but I have been disappointed in both, and like the Christian Pilgrim, am still looking forward to my journey’s end where the Mormons dare not molest, and snow storms are not so common as in the Desert God forsaken part of the world.\n\nMay 9, 1853 – Drove ten miles and then left the river and struck off across the plains and after driving ten miles farther struck the river again and encamped for the night. We saw some\n\nIndians today and persuaded them into camp. They were nearly naked and appeared as wild as\n\nyoung partridges. One of them had a recommend from a mail carrier, stating that he was a friendly Indian. Another one of them asked me to give him one for he was “good Indian too.” I wrote on a piece of paper the following and gave it to him: May 9, 1853. If this Indian hands you this paper, just tie him up and thrash him like thunder. For he looks to me like a suspicious character. N. B. Give him particular hell. G. W. K. He was well pleased with it and said that I was way no Marican, and he was way no Ingin; Good American, Good Indian.\n\nMay 10, 1853 – Crossed a stream today and laid by. We are several days travel ahead of anything on the road. We have two Indians with us who have traveled with us several days. They say they are going to Cal. with us, but we suspect that they are trying to play smart on us.\n\nMay 11, 1853 – Drove 15 miles and encamped in a little valley among the mountains. I have just been reading an inscription on a board that was placed at the head of a grave close by. The bones of him who was lain there are now scattered about the ground like thousands of others, he has been dug up by the wolves and his bones left to bleach on the plains. Poor fellow, his friends know not his fate. Perhaps it is well they do not. They may have heard what the inscription tells the emigrant that he was killed by the Indians while on guard. I am on guard tonight.\n\nMay 12, 1853 – Laid by till noon, it being rainy. Drove 15 miles this afternoon and encamped in the rain.\n\nMay 13, 1853 – Rolled out and drove 18 miles over a very bad road. The bottom road next to the river had become entirely impassable, and we are about to start for the bluffs.\n\nMay 14, 1853 – Mr. Loveless and myself started out to find a new road, and did not return to camp until noon after riding 18 or 20 miles through the rain. We hitched up and retraced 11 miles of our road that we traveled yesterday and then struck off for the bluffs. We here were overtaken by the train that my friend Taylor and Wilson and myself left on Goose creek 200 miles back for we considered it decidedly a slow train and we were in a hurry to go along. We encamped at dark ahead of everything on the road after having traveled 18 miles through the rain. This is awful.\n\nMay 15, 1853 – Rolled out early this morning and drove 18 miles through the rain, snow and mud, and here met with our usual luck, we got stuck in the mud. It took ten yoke of cattle to haul one wagon out of the mud unloading the traps.\n\nThe train in our wake is in sight and in the mud fast for the night. Good. They crowed over us when they overtook us. They will not over take us again. Today we passed where two men had been shot by Indians. Their bodies had been dug up by Indians or wolves. They were killed in 1852. There are two men in our train who were in the same train in which the two men were killed.\n\nMay 16, 1853 – Rolled out and drove 18 miles before sun set, and then baited our team and hitched up again and drove until midnight. After setting the guard for the night I laid down on the ground tired and sleepy and soon fell asleep and awoke in the morning much refreshed.\n\nMay 17, 1853 – Found ourselves lost this morning and laid by all day to look out the road.\n\nMay 18, 1853 – Rolled out this morning and lost our way. We wandered around till noon when we found our road again and laid by for the remainder of the day.\n\nMay 19, 1853 – Drove 30 miles and encamped on Sand Hill Creek. I am on guard tonight.\n\nMay 20, 1853 – This morning we had a row in camp. A Herington struck Capt. Holley with his gun and knocked him down and repeated the blows to the number of six before we took him off for we thought that he deserved it. Our Capt. is now troubled with Big-head.\n\nMay 21, 1853 – Capt. Holley is worse this morning. We left the river this morning and took to the mountains and traveled 18 miles to where we struck the river again where we encamped for the night. At 10 o’clock, the first train in our rear drove up and encamped a little back. We are the Pioneer Company yet.\n\nMay 22, 1853 – This morning I took a tramp ahead of the train. Wild geese and ducks are the common game of the country and Indians and herbs that grows spontaneous but I have me “faithful Betsy” with me in pursuit of the birds and don’t fear the Indians.\n\nMay 23, 1853 – Rolled out and drove 25 miles. Passed hundreds of dead cattle, the wreck of former years. Met Californians on their return to their home and friends. We are now but 30 miles from the sink of the river.\n\nMay 24, 1853 – Found the skull of some poor fellow on the mountains. Wrote my friend Taylor’s and my own name on it the day we passed and hung it on a stick by the road and traveled on. En- camped but five miles from the sink of the river.\n\nMay 25, 1853 – Drove three miles beyond the sink to the edge of the great desert and laid by to prepare for crossing the desert which is 40 miles without water or feed. The Great Bone Yard for worn out cattle, where the poor creatures lie down and die almost within sight of their journeys end. We have now traveled 450 miles down this river which we could have traveled it in 310 miles at a time of low water. We now leave the river at the sink and start onto the desert. Three o’clock P.M. we are now rolling out for the Carson River.\n\nMay 26, 1853 – At sunrise we have halted 12 miles from Carson river having traveled 29 miles since three o’clock yesterday, 11 o’clock and 20 minutes. We are now on Carson River, and have made the Riffle and crossed the great desert and are all alive which is better than many others have done, for we found some forty graves at this edge of those who had died, beside a great many on the desert, poor fellows. They have died within 60 miles of where gold has been dug. There are log cable chains enough on this desert to reach from Columbus to Cleveland via the Railroad, and dead cattle, horses, and mules, old wagons and irons of every description to build a turn pike the same distance. I saw whole teams of three and four yoke of cattle yoked and [illegible word] chained together that had struggled on for two thousand miles and here had lain down to rest and appeared to have fallen asleep, and had not awoke till the sand had drifted on their legs in such large piles that they could not wake to raise and had lain there ever since and dried up. I swung my ox whip over them and hallowed to them but all to no effect and indeed I don’t think anything will ever induce them to make an effort to get up til Gabril shall stand one foot on the little lake at the sink of the Humbolt and one foot on the desert and blows his horn to rise out of their sandy beds. My friend Taylor found the grave of a cousin on the desert. Taylor and myself with two others left the train at 3 o’clock and traveled on foot. We traveled 15 miles and halted at sunset, built a little fire on the river bank and got ourselves some supper. After supper we extinguished our fire and traveled three miles farther for safety from the Indians, and then laid down to sleep with nothing but our blankets and the heavens over us and all slept soundly all night through we did not consider it safe on account of the Indians being troublesome in this part of the country, but we had not slept in thirty hours and had walked all that time. My Ohio friends would think these hard times. “Well Jordan am a hard road to Travel”.\n\nMay 27, 1853 – Awoke early this morning much rested, and unmolested by the Indians. We walked 30 miles today, 26 of which was a desert. We laid ourselves down as usual on the ground and slept soundly.\n\nMay 28, 1853 – After walking 5 miles this morning we reached the summit of a high hill and looked down on a hundred miners who were digging gold in Gold Canyon Carson Valley. We raised a shout and was answered by the miners below. We are the first who have reached this place this season across the plains. We are yet 150 miles from the mines in Cal. on the other side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. It is now 14 months and 11 days since I left home and today for the first time I have seen gold dug from the earth. My friend Taylor and I are as well pleased as though we had just got home with our fortunes. We have bought ourselves a Long-Tom, expect soon to t— some thing or get t—-ed the darndest. We can’t cross the mountains for a week on account of the snow. We intend to go on as soon as we can.\n\nMay 29, 1853 – Resting a little today which we very much need, after so long and tedious a trip.\n\nMay 30, 1853 – Took ourselves a claim and commenced mining on our own hook. G. King.\n\nMay 31, 1853 – Mining again today, had very little success yesterday and a poor prospect today.\n\nJune 1, 1853 – Mining as usual.\n\nJune 2, 1853 – Working in our claim today.\n\nJune 3, 1853 – Made $4 to the hand, or man. Sold our Tom to some green horns (we call ourselves miners) and got $12 more than we gave for it and tomorrow we resume our journey for the other side of the mountains.\n\nJune 4, 1853 – Started this morning early traveled thirty miles and encamped for the night.\n\nJune 5, 1853 – Crossed the first summit of the Sierra Nevada mountains and encamped on the shore of Lake Bigler — a beautiful lake situated between the two summits of the mountains and is ten miles long and 3 miles wide.\n\nJune 6, 1853 – Crossed the second summit early this morning. Snow several feet deep and hard enough to bear a male. We are now in Cal. and descending the western slope towards the Pacific Ocean. Saw any amount of grisly bear tracks in the snow during the day. Traveled 20 miles and Taylor and I got lost and had to lay out and neither of us knew the other was lost till next morning.\n\nJune 7, 1853 – Started early this morning and traveled 25 miles and encamped within 4 miles of Hang Town — the first mining town on the emigrant road.\n\nJune 8, 1853 – Moved on into town, and had the good fortune to hire in a sawmill at $75 per month and commenced at noon the same day. Worked 5 days, and left thinking I could do better and went to mining. Made $10.50 the first day.\n\n* The G.W. King journal ends here. Published in The Pastfinder, Newsletter of the Ashland County Chapter Ohio Historical Society\n\nThis letter was written by Mary Adeline (Richards) Welton (1814-1873), the wife of Hobart Victory Welton (1811-1895) of Waterbury, Connecticut. Mary wrote the letter from her parents farm in Westminster, Wyndham County, Vermont, where we learn she had traveled by stage with her seventeen month-old son, Edwin Davis Welton (born 4 April 1836). Mary’s parents were Luther Abijah Richards (1785-1840) and Mary Page (1796-1840).\n\nWhile art was his passion, Hobart Victory Welton was a successful farmer and was “equally accomplished as an engineer. He served as superintendent of the city roads for 25 years, oversaw the construction of a system of reservoirs on the Mad River to power brass factories, engineered Waterbury’s first stone bridge with an arch in 1848, and engineered Connecticut’s first iron bridge in 1863, built over the Naugatuck River at West Main Street. Welton served in the State Legislature in 1852 and 1853. He died in 1895, but his art continues to influence us today.” [See Waterbury Thoughts]\n\nTRANSCRIPTION\n\nAddressed to Mr. Hobart V. Welton, Waterbury, Connecticut\n\nWestminster [Vermont]\n\nSeptember 1837\n\nMonday afternoon\n\nBeloved Husband,\n\nI thought when I left you I should send a before before I wrote, but thinking you will be anxious to know about my journey, as well as how I found my friends, I have concluded to alter my arrangement.\n\nI found my journey not as fatiguing as I expected, for I thought it would make me down sick. I rode with those four gentlemen until we reached Springfield (one was, however, a drunkard and can hardly bear the appellation of gentleman). At Springfield, a lady took the stage and rode to Bernardston within ten miles of Brattleborough. The rest of the way was with gentlemen who were very kind and offered to assist me in carrying Edwin; one gentleman carried him perhaps two hours which was the only relief I had. He was sick the last day and would go to no one but me. I do not know whether it was stage sickness or being irregular about his food and eating a pear to quench his thirst. He has not yet got to be quite himself yet. Does not play about as much as when at home and likes to be nearer mother than usual and nearer than I like most of the time. But I think he will get over it when he gets better acquainted with the children. They all call him a father boy.\n\nI have felt about half way sick even since I have been here a violent headache and sore throat accompanied with laziness has been my chief complaint. I found our family well except Father. He appears workout with hard work and is now so busy he can hardly find time I would almost say to breathe. He has a Rye beard in one of his eyes which has been in three weeks and is very troublesome. This is now the season for pigeon’s in which Father is much engaged.\n\nHe has nearly completed his barn and I wish I could give you a description of the buildings as they are now arranged more convenient than any I have before seen. First he has a large shed to grind scythes and the like with a room joining for carriages. Next is a shed to drive under to unharness connected with his horse barn which is divided into five tables for horses which occupies one half onf the barn. The other half is divided into a granary and harness room, and a wool room, a chamber above for hay, a hog pen joining. These are all on the opposite side of the yard from the house. I wish you could visit Westminster before you finish your barn.\n\nI suppose you are this week at work at Mr. Platt, and I fear you will make yourself sick by working in the water. I look for Mrs. Platt every day.\n\nFather says you could purchase sawed chestnut shingles for about two dollars and a quarter. Pine, he thinks, at between 3 and 4 dollars. He says he shall be going to Bellow’s Falls before many days and can ascertain for what they may be bought, and also what it cost to send them by water.\n\nThere were three or four passengers in the stage who were going north to buy cattle. I heard them remark that purchasers were very plenty. I judged by their conversation more so than they wished they told me for what they could buy cattle but I was sick with the headache with a sick child and paid but little regard to their conversation. But Father says have is very scarce and people will be obliged to sell.\n\nSarah and Russell are to be married sometime this fall. The day and hour is not yet set. I am quite anxious it should be that you may make your arrangements to be here at the time. R. has invited me to attend church at Bellow’s Falls with S. I hope you have no objections. If so, you will have time to send me word before we go. I have not seen Campbell yet. Aunt Richards has last week had a slight shock of Numb Palsy. Many think she will never recover to be as well as former. She is able to sit up and walk with assistance. It seems to have impaired her mind more than her body.\n\nTuesday morn. Last night we had rain which is the first they have had in a long time. I found it very dusty although not as bad riding in the night as in the day time.\n\nYours with true affection.\n\nThis letter was written by 19 year-old Jacob Howell (1827-1891), the son of Israel and Elizabeth (Rowland) Howell. Israel Howell was born in Philadelphia in 1786 where he was educated in the common schools and learned the tanner’s trade from his father. In 1828 he moved to Edgmont, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, where he purchased a farm of 200 acres and raised cattle. He founded the village of Howellville (now Gradyville). In 1848, after the sale of his property in Edgemont, he returned to Philadelphia where he worked in the custom house. He then moved his family to a farm of 60 acres in East Bradford. Besides Jacob, the other Howell children included Arthur, Mary Mott, Rowland (“Roll”), Israel, John Rowland, Sallie Rowland, Elizabeth or “Lizzy” (1834-1876), and Joshua Rowland.\n\nJacob (with a little help from Lizzy) wrote this letter to their older brother, Joshua Rowland Howell (1825-18xx). Joshua attended the Quaker boarding school at Westttown and then worked in a Monroe County tannery for six years. He then moved to Philadelphia were he worked in the leather business for fourteen years. In 1865, he left the business due to ill health and removed to East Bradford where he resided with his brother Jacob. He eventually purchased his own farm and raised cattle.\n\nTRANSCRIPTION\n\nAddressed to Joshua R. Howell, Fannersville P.O., Monroe County, Pennsylvania\n\nFirst day [Sunday] afternoon, 26 of 7th Month [1846]\n\nI expect thee, my dear brother, has or will be looking for a letter so I thought I would commence by saying Father arrived safely and thy letter was very acceptable. We have had company ever since Father’s return. The day before he came, Stanton Dorsey and Lizzy, also Lizzy Johnson and William Howell came out in the stage. William & Stanton started off on second day morn, washed on 2nd day, and just as we were done dinner the Westtown stage stopped and Mary Dickinson and child got out. She was an old acquaintance of Mothers.\n\nNext day Father & Mother took her up to Westtown to see her daughter and just before they got home Elisabeth Pitfield (who was visiting meetings) Elisabeth Pierson, Charles Williams, & N. Sharpless drove up to stay all night so thee will see we have just been on the run the whole time.\n\nRoley & Eben Levich came out yesterday week and last eve William H. came out. Roley seemed in pretty good spirits and I guess about wants another change. I do want to come up to see thee. E. L. says maybe Annie can come up with me and we will have a lovely time. Jacob is a going to write so I will say farewell. Thy affectionate sister. [– Lizzy]\n\n[different hand writing]\n\nPerhaps our Brother Joshua will think his friends at home have entirely forgotten him but can assure him that is not the case — far from it. But the cares on business of this vain world burden and crowd on us poor creatures and time passes so rapidly that a much longer time than was ever intended or thought of has passed since any have written to thee. Hope it will not happen so again. Well so much for a beginning. May says we are still staying here with no signs of escape — even if we wanted to go.\n\nSuppose thee has heard of the sad catastrophe that has happened the Mill at Stafford. Roll was up last first day [and] seemed well satisfied with the prospect of getting out of the business — suppose he had been there long enough to get tired of it and a change will just suit him. Would thee like to have him up there for company?\n\nWe have got pretty much through with our harvesting and have had some pretty unfavorable weather for it. Suppose you have had your share of the same kind.\n\nIs thee ever coming down to see us again for it seems a long time since I saw thee and think it would do me some good to see thy face and hear some good advice from thee and have some talk together — for I am almost out of conceit of everything in this world, may I say, for we seem only stay here now for we have no help — neither in the house not out of doors — except Grace — and what hiring we have to do and we do just what we have to and that is nearly all which keeps us busy. Now don’t thee think such getting along as that where there is so much to be done is only staying.\n\nI long to see the time when we shall have all things finished hereabouts but am almost out of heart. We go on so slowly. I begin to think before we get finished out at one end the other will need repairing — and it is hardly likely I shall ever get away from home to learn how the world does as we talked of and recommended being so good for young people — must stay here all my days, I suppose, and come out a dunce at last. Well so much for myself. Suppose Lizzy has told all the news.\n\nWe are all pretty well now though last week Mother and myself were both under the weather. With love from us all. I remain affectionately thy brother, — Jacob\n\nW. P. & S. C. Bangs have returned — came on 7th day. Expect they will be at meeting tomorrow, our Monthly meeting. They are all pretty well up there when we heard last. Poor Isaac Yarnall’s case is before the meeting. Will hear what is to be done with his poor soul. He comes to meeting regularly on 1st days now.\n\nThis letter was written by 21 year-old Harriet Richardson (1822-1854), the daughter of William Richardson (1787-1876) and Mary Pierson (1790-1875) of Stafford, Genesee County, New York. She wrote the letter to her older sister, Martha (Richardson) Conklin (1816-18xx), the wife of Elisha Conklin (1813-Aft1880) of Moravia, Cayuga County, New York. The Conklin’s later moved to Sempronius in Cayuga County.\n\nIn her letter, Harriet give all the local news and mentions the execution of Benjamin D. White (see footnotes) who was found guilty of murdering his father. The murder — a shooting– took place on 16 March 1842 at Batavia, New York. “A more deliberate, unnatural and wicked murder…can scarcely be found in the annals of crime,” wrote one correspondent covering the trial. It took the jurors less than 5 hours to return the verdict.\n\nTRANSCRIPTION\n\nAddressed to Mr. Elisha Conklin, Moravia, Cayuga County, New York\n\nStafford [Genesee County, New York]\n\nApril 27, 1843\n\nDear Brother and Sister,\n\nWhat a long time since I have written one word to you — more than a year, would you think it? And yet, how short the time appears.\n\nI have long thought of making you an epistolary visit, but have waited for something interesting to communicate. I am confident if I wait for that I shall never have the pleasure of writing. We have not heard from you in some weeks. How is your health now. Martha? We suppose you are well again else you would have written. What are you all about this Spring? And what do you think we are doing? I do not think you can guess so I will tell you. Father and the boys are building a stout board fence around the orchard and garden. James has ploughed and sowed peas. He says they are up. Mr. Havens transplanted a number of ____ trees. Got from Mrs. Burden’s garden a snow-ball, snowberry, cinnamon rose from Mr. Van Allen’s a very large sweet brier. We intend to have the garden west of the house for flowers together with vegetables. Miss Sally Gilbert gave me a number of house plants, four kinds of geranium, dew plant, german, and monthly rose (Mary’s plants all died but one). Do you not think we shall have enough to do to attend to all these things?\n\nBut you ask what are all you girls doing? We are at present engaged with your quilt. Put it on last week. Have quilted I will not say how much. I fear we should all blush if I told. I think we shall have work enough for this week and next. Mary is afraid it will not look as nice as hers. It quilts very hard — the lining is so thick. She got hers and told us just what blocks you quilted and said we must so yours as nice as those were. Mary says she shall take it to the fair in the fall and get prize enough to take her to Moravia. What do you think of that? I imagine she makes large calculations.\n\nMary and Kate will probably stay at home this summer. I expect to teach in the stone house east. Shall commence as soon as the walking is good. I suppose Martha you can imagine how I will look there. Just step in with Elisha and see me. I shall have some of the same scholars that you had. Have twelve shillings a week for six months if I please. The district generally and I like the school, walking good &c.\n\nI must bid you good night as it is quite late. The family are all in bed and I ought to be there. I have lots of news to tell you tomorrow. Benjamin White ¹ was executed yesterday at four. About fifty were admitted into the yard to see him — some of our neighbors. Many paid a shilling for the privilege of standing on the top of a barn where they could see him. He spoke very lengthy. His last words were he wished the people to remember that he had never believed there was any God and died as he lived — a deist. Some thought he appeared agitated; others said he did not in the least, and appeared rather lively. Good night and sweet be your sleep. {eleven o’clock}\n\nFriday Evening half past 6\n\nMartha, I need not quilt anymore today, need I? You say no. Well then I will talk to you. I imagine you will ask a great many questions. We heard from Brother Ham about two weeks ago. He was at Flint and had been for some time settling up about his land. He said he owned more than a thousand acres and wished Pa to sell it. If he could, he was going to start the next week for Milwaukie. Said we would hear from him again soon after his arrival there.\n\nIra D. Wright was married when H. was here to Miss Margaret Ingersoll. R. F. Page spent most of the winter and spring at Stafford. My pen is very poor. Would you laugh a little if I told you old Mrs. Wright was married? You will do no more than other folks did if you do. She was married a week last Sunday to a Deacon Brainard. The old gentleman came to Stafford last winter and told a friend of his that he wanted a wife. The lady recommended old Mrs. Wright. He went to Deacon Hickox and asked him to go with him next time. The next time he returned it was all settled. She went around to ask cons"
