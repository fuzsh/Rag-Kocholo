The extent of the casualties in this accident called into question the practice of mixing passenger and freight wagons in fast trains.

One of the girders carrying train had cracked in the middle and gave way, with most of the train ending up in the river below. The engine and tender managed to reach the other side of the bridge. The accident is important because the bridge was engineered by Robert Stephenson, and his reputation was questioned. The Dee bridge disaster led to a re-evaluation of the use of cast-iron in railway bridges, and many new bridges had to be demolished or reinforced.\n\n1850s\n\n1851\n\n* April 30 1851 – Sutton Tunnel, Cheshire, England: Two trains returning from the Chester Cup horse race lost adhesion in the tunnel and a third train crashed into the rear of the second train, killing nine people and injuring 30–40.\n\n1853\n\n* January 6, 1853 &ndash; Andover, Massachusetts, United States: The Boston & Maine noon express, traveling from Boston to Lawrence, Massachusetts, derails at forty miles an hour when an axle breaks at Andover, and the only coach goes down an embankment and breaks in two.

Fortunately, there are no fatalities.\n\n* April 25, 1853 &ndash; Chicago, Illinois, United States: An eastbound Michigan Central Railroad express bound for Toledo, Ohio, rams a Michigan Southern Railroad emigrant train at level Grand Crossing on the city's South Side at night. Twenty-one German emigrants are killed. The Michigan Southern engineer, who was running without a headlight, could have avoided the accident by either observing a stop signal or by accelerating his train, but did neither. Grand Crossing will be grade-separated after this accident.\n\n* May 6, 1853 &ndash; Norwalk, Connecticut, United States: First major U.S. railroad bridge disaster occurs when a New Haven Railroad engineer neglects to check for open drawbridge signal.

Wright of Pawtucket forming the basis for an engraving a fortnight later in the \"New York Illustrated News\".\n\n* 5 October 1853 &ndash;Straffan, Ireland; 16 killed after a rear-end collision when a train breaks down and the crew were accused of neglecting to place any warning signals to the rear.\n\n* December 1853 &ndash; Secaucus, New Jersey, United States: The same two trains that crashed on May 9, 1853, a Paterson & Hudson River Railroad emigrant train and an Erie Railroad express, collide again, within one mile (1.6 km) of last spring's wreck site near Secaucus.

Seventy-five lives are lost (estimate-60 victims' names are known of whom about 46 remains were recovered). The subsequent investigation concludes that \"the bridge was badly designed, badly constructed and badly maintained\" and lays the major blame on the designer, Sir Thomas Bouch. William Topaz McGonagall produces his epic poem \"The Tay Bridge Disaster\" to commemorate the event. It is the worst ever train disaster to date, and shocks engineers into creating an improved crossing both on the Tay, as well as the famous Forth bridge.\n\n1880s\n\n1881\n\n* July 6, 1881 &ndash; Boone, Iowa, United States: A Chicago and North Western Railway locomotive runs tender-first, westbound over the line out of Boone to check the tracks during a heavy summer rainstorm in the Des Moines River Valley and plunges into Honey Creek as the weakened bridge collapses. Spunky, Irish-born, seventeen-year-old Kate Shelley, who lives close by the accident site, realizes that the late night eastbound express coming from Moingona, a mile to the west, has to be flagged down, lest it pile into gap at Honey Creek. To reach the station, she must cross the long bridge over the Des Moines River in the storm. Arriving at the depot, she relates what she has seen, and the express train is halted. She then accompanies the rescue train to the failed bridge and helps locate the surviving engine crew, two of whom had survived the 25 foot plunge into the flood and who have found refuge above the waters on tree limbs. For her part in keeping a small accident from becoming much worse, Kate Shelley becomes a national folk heroine. The new bridge over the Des Moines River is named in her honor as the 'Kate Shelley High Bridge'. As of mid-2007, the bridge is due to be replaced by a new structure capable of higher capacity and speed by the Union Pacific which absorbed the Chicago & Northwestern. The old alignment may become a road bridge.\n\n1882\n\n* January 13, 1882 &ndash; Spuyten Duyvil, New York, United States: Hudson River Railroad's \"Tarrytown Special\" collides with rear of the halted \"Atlantic Express\" near Spuyten Duyvil at night, telescoping the last two coaches which also catch fire. \"Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper\" publishes full front-page engraving on January 21, 1882 showing trainmen, passengers, and local farmers rolling giant snowballs in an attempt to extinguish the blaze. State Senator and sleeping car magnate Webster Wagner was among the dead.\n\n* September 3 1882; Hugstetten, Germany: After heavy weather the rail became washed out and the train most probably was running too fast.

The cars in the front half telescope into one another and some 84 are killed with injuries estimated at 279. This accident inspires morbid ballad \"The Chatsworth Wreck\" that includes the verse, \"the dead and dying mingled with the broken beams and bars; an awful human carnage, a dreadful wreck of cars.\"\n\n* August 17, 1887 &ndash; Washington, D.C., United States: Baltimore & Ohio \"Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Express\" enters the city from Maryland, out of control. At sixty miles an hour it derails on curve at Terracotta, demolishing several buildings as well as the train set.

The engineer is killed and many passengers injured.\n\n1888\n\n* March 17, 1888 &ndash; Blackshear, Georgia, United States: Most of the \"West India Fast Mail Train\" from New York to Jacksonville is wrecked when two-thirds of a 300 foot long, 25 foot high trestle collapses. The accident is caused by a broken rail under the lead baggage car, which gets off the track. The train safely crosses the bridge over the Hurricane River, but at about 9:30 a.m. the baggage car suddenly whirls over and strikes the subsequent trestle, which gives way. All but the detached engine tumbles below -- a combination car, 3 baggage cars, a smoking car, a coach, 2 Pullman sleepers, and the private car of the Lehigh Valley Railroad. Killed are 20, with 35 injured. Among the latter is Elisha P. Wilbur, president of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, who together with members of his family and friends was traveling in the private car.

At about 8 p.m., the sixth train with 500 on board stops near Mud Run along the banks of the Lehigh River and shortly thereafter the following section plows into it, telescoping the last car of the stopped train halfway through the coach ahead, killing 64 of the 200 in these two wooden cars outright. Another 100 are injured. Newspaper accounts suggest that temperance pledges were forgotten by some of the victims after they returned to the train.\n\n* October 17, 1888 &ndash; Borki, Kharkov province, Russian Empire: In 1888, the Imperial train crashed near Borki in Kharkov Province. The popular story says that tsar held up the mangled roof of the carriage, so that his family could escape from the wreckage. The story could easly be truthfull because Alexander Romanov was a very big and strong russian man. In doing so, he damaged his kidneys. The imperial train was de-railed due to high speed. Alexander sustained a massive impact trauma to his back but was apparently not affected in any other way. In the accident were not any victims, but Alexander III ordered to build two new trains — one for travels abroad and one for travels within Russia.\n\n1889\n\n* May 12, 1889 &ndash; Seattle, Washington, a street car descending Denny Hill suffers a cable malfunction and crashed after hitting a sharp curve.

Ten people killed, eleven seriously injured.\n\n1891\n\n* April 19, 1891 &ndash; Kipton, Ohio, United States: A passenger train and a freight train collide just east of the Kipton depot, 8 dead. This accident was attributed to one of the engineers' watches having stopped and being four minutes behind. Webster C. Ball, watch dealer and inspector of Cleveland, Ohio is later appointed as Watch Inspector for the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad.\n\n* June 14, 1891 &ndash; Munchenstein, Basle, Switzerland: An iron girder bridge collapses as a crowded passenger train passes over it, 71 dead, 171 injured. Switzerland's worst ever railway accident.\n\n* December 4, 1891 &ndash; East Thompson, Connecticut, United States: Four trains collide on the New York and New England Railroad. Two freight trains collide due to sloppy dispatching, jack-knifing several cars. The \"Long Island & Eastern States Express\" passenger train then hits the wreckage, killing the engineer and fireman.
