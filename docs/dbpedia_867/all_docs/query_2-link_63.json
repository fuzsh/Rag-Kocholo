        "text": "A 64-year-old Milford Township woman was killed Wednesday morning after a train collided with her vehicle at a railroad crossing in the Village of Milford.\n\nA news release issued by Milford Police Chief Tom Lindberg states that the crash happened at around 11:30 a.m. at the railroad crossing on Old Plank Road, which is just inside the village limits.\n\nAs stated in the news release, a preliminary investigation indicates the vehicle was traveling northbound on Old Plank Road and failed to stop for the train, which was heading southeast. Personnel from the Milford Fire Department responded to the scene and attempted lifesaving measures before the woman was transported to Ascension Providence Hospital in Novi where she was pronounced dead.\n\nThere is no indication that the crossing signals malfunctioned or weren’t working properly, the news release states.\n\nThere were no other occupants in the car.\n\nThe accident is under investigation by Milford police and the Michigan State Police accident reconstruction unit.\n\n“We ask travelers of the Milford community to have patience as this train is currently blocking all crossings throughout our community,” Lindberg stated in the news release. “Temporary detours are in place and all businesses will remain open and accessible to residents and guests.”\n\nThe Milford Police Department reminds drivers to use extreme caution at all railroad crossings.\n\nAnyone that may have been in the area or witnessed the accident is asked to call the Milford Police Department at (248) 684-1815."
