(Retired), Officer in Charge,\n\nHistorical Section, Navy Department.\n\n--v--\n\nTHE UNITED STATES RAILWAY BATTERIES IN FRANCE.\n\nPart I.\n\nTHE STORY OF THE BATTERIES.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nDuring the period from September 6, 1918, until the signing of the armistice five United States naval batteries, each composed of one 14-inch 50-caliber gun carried on a special railway mount attached to ammunition and auxiliary cars, bombarded German bases and positions behind the lines in France with remarkable efficiency and important results.\n\nThese guns were more powerful than any others in use at the front, and played a prominent part in destroying railway and supply bases and generally in hampering concentration behind the German lines, besides lowering the enemy’s morale. They thus contributed materially to the victory of the allied forces.\n\nTHE GENERAL IDEA NOT NEW.\n\nThe use of big-caliber guns by naval landing parties is not new.\n\nIn the Mexican War three 64-pounders and three long 32-pounders were used by Gen. Scott at Vera Cruz from the land side. During the Boer War one of the British cruisers was practically stripped of her guns, which were used at Ladysmith, Colenso, and Spionkop. Naval guns were used on land in the Chinese Boxer rebellion.\n\nIn the late war guns of smaller caliber were mounted by the Italians on railway trucks and run up and down the Adriatic, chiefly to prevent the shelling of the coast by Austrian submarines. On the defenses of Kiau-Chau the Germans mounted naval guns of calibers up to 11 inches.\n\nORIGIN OF THE UNITED STATES NAVAL RAILWAY BATTERIES.\n\nThe great importance of long-range artillery was particularly impressed upon the Allies by the threatening measure of success obtained by the German guns which bombarded Dunkirk intermittently from the neighborhood of Clerken and Moere in Belgium (the so-called Leugenboom guns), a distance of about 39 kilometers (over 24 miles), from April 28, 1915, until the retreat of the German forces\n\n--1--\n\nin 1918. Although the allied artillery fire against these positions was well directed, it failed to silence the guns, and it was feared that unless serious steps were taken their number and efficiency might grow to such an extent that, as soon as the German armies threatened, the channel ports might have to be abandoned, which would be nothing less than a catastrophe for the allied cause.\n\nDuring the summer of 1917 Rear Admiral Ralph Earle, Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, became convinced that a way must be found by means of very powerful long-range naval guns not only to reply to the Leugenboom batteries but also to bombard the German supply and concentration positions behind the front, and thus effectively hinder the enemy’s preparations for attack.1 Conferences with Maj. Gen. John Headlam, Royal Artillery, and Capt. Andre Tardieu, French commissioner, confirmed him in this view. Gen. Headlam had been commander in chief of all the British artillery on the western front until disabled by wounds.\n\nTo fulfill the mission and be absolutely effective it was evident that the batteries must be, in the first place, completely mobile, and, secondly, entirely independent logistically, not only of any artillery base but of any and all other organizations. Not only the guns themselves but the rolling repair shops, the cars for the machine shops, ammunition, cranes, and wireless outfits, as well as the barracks for the personnel, must form an absolutely self-sustaining unit, capable of going anywhere and operating at highest effectiveness without the help of any other organization, either American or allied, excepting as regarded the French railways. To provide such a unit was the problem.\n\nOn November 12, 1917, Rear Admiral Earle addressed the following letter to the Chief of Naval Operations:\n\nNovember 12, 1917.\n\nFrom: Chief of Bureau of Ordnance.\n\nTo: Chief of Naval Operations.\n\nSubject: Long-range bombardments.\n\n1. From reports of activities, dated September 29, 1917, along the Flemish dunes, the bureau notes:\n\n____________\n\n1 Navy Department, Bureau of Ordnance,\n\nWashington D.C., June 27, 1919.\n\nTo: Office of Naval Intelligence (Capt. C. C. Marsh, United States Navy, Retired, Historical Section).\n\nSubject: Naval Railway Batteries in France.\n\nReference: (a) O. N. I. let. CCM/LMACC June 11, 1919.\n\n(b) Bu. Ord. 1st 34752/SSO\n\n(E3)—OBM of June 23, 1919.\n\n1. In answer to paragraph 2 of reference (a) you are advised the present chief of bureau originated the idea of building and operating a battery of 14-inch 50-caliber naval railway mounts, and supplied the requirements and limitations of such a mount to the bureau’s drafting room at the gun factory for their study and design. The requirements were based upon limitations of railway tunnels and bridges in France and on the mobility of the gun itself.\n\nC. C. Bloch,\n\nCaptain, United States Navy, Acting Chief of Bureau.\n\n--2--\n\nGun in Proving-Ground Girder.\n\nGun - showing counterrecoil arrangements.\n\n\"On the Dune sector the British naval guns were unfortunately considerably outranged by the German guns. There are no British guns larger than 12-inch mounted on shore here. The big German gun which fires into Dunkirk is generally referred to as a 17-inch. * * * Its range has been measured as 50,300 yards.\"\n\n2. The above suggests the possibility of our mounting several naval 14-inch guns along the coast, fitted with high angles of fire, and with specially formed shell, fitted with delayed action fuses, in order to outrange these German guns. Manned by our seamen, a battery of four of these guns might not be a bad answer to the long-range German bombardment of Dunkirk. Of course, in order to develop this range the bureau must have its auxiliary proving ground granted and operating.\n\n3. Even were the guns mounted on vessels off the Belgian coast and there given a range of over 30,000 yards, considerable damage may be done to German positions. Such a vessel fitted, as it would be, with our new smoke-producing apparatus, might materially assist Admiral Bacon’s monitors in their operations.\n\nRalph Earle.\n\nIt will be noted that the original idea was to use these railway mounts behind the British lines in France, but changing military conditions prevented the British authorities definitely stating at which port the debarkation of the batteries was to be made, and they were therefore offered to Gen. Pershing, who accepted them, the acceptance being definitely approved by the War Department in a letter dated February 12, 1918.\n\nThe gun referred to was the 14-inch 50-caliber Mark IV Navy rifle. Fortunately ammunition for this arm was on hand in quantity, and there was also an adequate supply of the guns themselves, as our dreadnaughts Nos. 44 to 50, Idaho, New Mexico, etc., were armed with it, and it was to be used to equip the new battle cruisers, the construction of which was postponed in order to concentrate our efforts upon destroyers and other light craft. As a matter of fact, the guns actually mounted and used on the French front were taken from the spares for the commissioned fleet.\n\nThe Navy’s new 16-inch rifles would, of course, have been a better arm for the purpose, but they were at the time not available in sufficient numbers.\n\nThe shipment of the 14-inch gun abroad was known to be feasible, as during the summer of 1917 shipments of 14-inch 45-caliber guns had been made to the British Admiralty.\n\nIt appeared from all investigations made in the bureau, that, if a suitable shore mounting could be developed, the Navy could have in operation in Prance a number of 14-inch guns within a period of six months from the time of approval of such a project. 2\n\n_____________\n\n2 Lieut. Commander L. B. Bye, United States Naval Institute Proceedings, June, 1919.\n\n--3--\n\nDESIGNING AND CONSTRUCTION.\n\nThe drafting-room force at the Naval Gun Factory, under the supervision of Lieut. Commander Harvey Delano, was given the task of developing such a mount, and on December 10 made the following report to Rear Admiral Earle, which he sent without change to the Chief of Naval Operations:\n\nBureau of Ordnance,\n\nDecember 10, 1917.\n\nSubject: Shore mounting for heavy guns.\n\nEnclosure: Description of above mounting for 14-inch 50-caliber gun, Mark IV.\n\n1. There is forwarded herewith a description and accompanying plates of the proposed railroad mounting for the 14-inch 50-caliber gun, also a description of the train carrying the personnel and equipment necessary for the operation of such a gun in the field.\n\n2. It is the intention to use the 14-inch 50-caliber gun, Mark IV, mounted in slide Mark IV. In order to mount this gun and slide on the proposed railroad car, it will be necessary to make a new deck lug and jacking mechanism for raising the gun from the stowed position necessary for transportation to its firing position. A new elevating gear of the arc-and-pinion type will be required, as the screw type now used will require raising the gun too high from the tracks for stability in transporting.\n\n3. The railroad mounting and equipment for a gun of this size will be of great value in assisting to overcome the fire from large German guns now being used against the lines of the Allies “on the Dune sector” in Belgium. In addition to this advantage, such a railroad mounting would be of considerable value in this country as a mobile battery to act in conjunction with the Army in case of invasion.\n\n4. It is estimated that four gun cars and their accompanying trains can be constructed by contract within 90 days after the receipt of drawings, provided the work can be given Government priority both in securing the material and the manufacturing work involved. It is estimated that by giving this work precedence in the drafting room and with the hearty cooperation of all concerned, the drawings and necessary specifications can be completed by the 1st of February.\n\n5. It is recommended that four gun cars and their trains be manufactured, making four complete batteries of the type described in the accompanying description, and that the six remaining 14-inch 50-caliber guns, with the slides, be held as spares to replace any of the guns in the battery when worn out or injured.\n\nA. L. Willard.\n\nOn November 26, 1917, the Navy Department approved the construction of five 14-inch railway mounts, with a complete train equipment for each gun, and a sixth train to accommodate the staff for communication between the five batteries when in action at various positions along the lines.\n\nThe Bureau of Ordnance was instructed to go ahead. Battleship turret-mount designers, together with other men at the Naval Gun Factory experienced in bridge and locomotive work, were called into action to develop the detailed plans along the lines of their preliminary investigations.3 * * * The work moved forward in spite of all discouragements. Holidays and Sundays were sacrificed, and every effort was made successfully to meet on the drawing board\n\n____________\n\n3 See Pt. II, “Personnel of Bureau.”\n\n--4--\n\nall problems connected with this project. Many problems which had not been anticipated were encountered, and it was necessary to refer to all data on French railways and French railway practice that was available in the United States, and also to communicate with the commander of the United States naval forces operating in European waters for confirmation of data, for it was found that in many cases reports were conflicting.4\n\nBy January 25, 1918, 136 standard drawings and 11 sketches were ready for submission to bidders.\n\nEach 14-inch naval railway battery was a complete self-sustaining unit, designed to operate individually or in conjunction with the several similar batteries. When two or more batteries were cooperating in the same sector their activities were directed by a single commanding officer, with headquarters on the naval railway batteries staff train. Fundamentally each battery consisted of a 14-inch 50-caliber naval rifle carried on a special railway mount, together with ammunition cars and auxiliary cars.5\n\nAfter some unsatisfactory bids had been received new bids were opened on February 13, 1918, and on the same afternoon the contract for the construction of the gun cars and locomotives was awarded the Baldwin Locomotive Works, who promised to deliver them about June 15. The contract for the rest of the cars and other equipment was awarded the Standard Steel Car Co., the promise of delivery being between 100 and 120 days.6\n\nThe complete equipment called for in these two contracts was as follows:\n\n6 consolidation locomotives and tenders (tractive power, 35,600 pounds). 1 staff radio and spares car. 1 commissary car (staff). 6 construction cars. 10 ammunition cars. 5 construction ears with cranes. 5 battery kitchen cars. 5 sand and log cars. 5 battery headquarters cars. 1 executive officer’s car. 15 berthing cars. 1 staff office car. 5 fuel cars. 1 staff workshop car. 5 workshop cars. 1 set of equipment for staff workshop car. 1 staff quarters car. 1 staff kitchen and dispensary car.\n\nRear Admiral, then Captain, C. P. Plunkett, United States Navy, was detailed at his own request as commanding officer of the United States naval railway batteries, and he began the assembly and instruction of the personnel on February 20. in accordance with the carrying out of the following order:\n\nFebruary 19, 1918.\n\nFrom: The Chief of Naval Operations.\n\nTo: The Chief of Bureau of Navigation.\n\nSubject: Personnel for naval batteries for operation abroad.\n\n1.

Capt. Plunkett, United States Navy, has been directed to confer with the Bureau of Navigation and Ordnance with regard to the assembling of the personnel and material for purposes of training previous to departure from this country. He will confer with the bureau as to the time and places where this personnel will be needed.\n\nW. S. Benson.\n\nIt was impossible under the circumstances to keep these preparations secret, and as the news of this interesting and important service at the battle front spread, no fewer than 20,000 officers and men requested to be allowed to join the expedition.\n\nFor instruction the men were divided among the naval proving ground, Indianhead, Md.; the Naval Gun Factory at Washington, D. C.; and the Sandy Hook proving ground, Sandy Hook, N. J., where they were given intensive training. They were required to put guns in place, load and fire them, disassemble them after proof, and become so accustomed to gunfire that they lost all nervousness. The handling of heavy weights or the firing of big guns became to them only a routine matter. They were required to operate trains, operate locomotives, to build railroad track, and perform any sort of task which was likely to give them experience that would be valuable while operating against the enemy. A number of men were assigned to the Baldwin Locomotive Works and to the shops of the Standard Steel Car Co. to assist in the inspection of the material while building. In this way many men became familiar with the smallest details of each and every part. The expedition demanded experienced men to run the locomotives and operate the trains on the railways of France. About 100 skilled mechanics were furnished from the United States naval training station, Great Lakes, and several engineers, firemen, and others to make up train crews volunteered for enrollment upon being informed of the country’s need for them.7\n\nThe first 14-inch naval railway mount was completed in 72 days from the award of the contract and 120 days from the beginning of the first designs. The first mount was completed on April 25, 1918.8\n\n_____________\n\n7 Lieut. Commander. L. B. Bye, United States Naval Institute Proceedings, June, 1919.\n\n8 See Pt. 11, “Completion of the mounts.”\n\n--6--\n\nFULL BATTERY AND TRAIN.\n\nASSEMBLING BATTERY LOCOMOTIVE.\n\nTEST OF FIRST MOUNT AT SANDY HOOK PROVING GROUNDS.\n\nAs the naval proving ground at Indianhead had a maximum range of only about 15,000 yards, permission was asked and granted to conduct the proof of the first mount at the Army proving ground, Sandy Hook, N. J. This most critical test, that of firing the gun from the first mount, was conducted in the presence of Rear Admiral Earle and his chief officers, as well as many officers of our Army and of the naval and army services of our allies, and was successful. The first shots were fired from its gun-pit foundation at an elevation of 25°. Other shots were fired at an angle of 45°. The mount was then removed from its pit and fired from the rails at elevations of 10° and 15°. At every test the railway mount functioned as designed and was pronounced a complete success. Rear Admiral Earle was universally congratulated.9\n\nDuring the construction period of all this equipment the contractors and all persons having to do with its building were spurred in their efforts by the repeated accounts of the German long-range guns firing into Paris, and the reports of the telling effect of the German long-range guns all along the front. The “German Berthas” were doing considerable damage to material and were having a serious influence on the morale of the French people. The Navy’s foresight in preparing the expedition for foreign service was appreciated during May, for it was at this time that the Germans were making rapid advances and the channel ports were threatened. Through the Office of Naval Intelligence information was received that 380-millimeter guns originally intended for the Hindenburg had been mounted by the Germans—one near Lille to fire upon Dunkirk, one at St. Hilaire le Grand to fire upon Chalons sur Marne, the third near Pont a Mousson to fire on Nancy, and four more had been mounted two months before in a wood 4 kilometers above Crepy, Laon. It was definitely established that 16 heavy naval guns had left Kiel toward the end of May for Belgium. They were believed to be 305-millimeter guns, manned by naval personnel, and were probably attached to the Marine Sonder Kommando.10\n\nSHIPMENT TO FRANCE.\n\nThough it had been planned to ship the guns to the British transportation centers, conditions in France had so changed, owing to the threatening of the channel ports by the Germans, that this plan seemed too risky, and Gen. Pershing was therefore consulted as to cooperation of the batteries with the Army. Gen. Pershing replied on May 23, requesting shipment of the guns, railway mounts, and rolling stock to France without delay. The sole reservation made by the Army was that Army tonnage should not be required for ocean transportation. St. Nazaire was assigned as the port of debarkation, and the necessary shipping was arranged for through the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts.11\n\n_____________\n\n9 See Pt. II, “Congratulations on success of test.”\n\n10 Lieut. Commander L. B. Bye. United States Naval Institute Proceedings, June, 1919.\n\n11 See Pt. 11, “Arrangements for transportation.”\n\n--7--\n\nThe personnel chosen for the expedition was ordered to assemble at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and the first draft, 250 men and 8 officers commanded by Lieut. Commander G. L. Schuyler, United States Navy, sailed on May 26, 1918, and arrived at St. Nazaire on June 10. The second draft, 207 men and 6 officers with Lieut. Commander J. W. Bunkley, United States Navy, in charge, sailed on June 15, and arrived at St. Nazaire on June 29. Lieut. Commander Schuyler commanded the naval detachment in France until the arrival of Capt. C. P. Plunkett on July 16.12\n\nThe first shipment of material was begun on June 20, when the U. S. S. Newport News from Philadelphia, and other shipments followed by the steamers Bath and Pensacola on July 4, and later the Malang and Rappahannock. The Newport News arrived at St. Nazaire on July 8, the Bath on July 21, the Pensacola on July 27, the Malang on August 11, and the Rappahannock on August 15.\n\nLieut. Commander D. C. Buell, United States Naval Reserve Force, who had superintended the construction of the railway batteries material for the Bureau of Ordnance, arrived at St. Nazaire on June 30. by which time most of the preliminary arrangements for the expeditions in France had been completed by Lieut. Commander Schuyler. Barracks were being built, arrangements had been made for mounting the guns in a French shop and for their storage, and conferences had been held in regard to moving the batteries over the French railways, the result of which was that no doubts were entertained concerning the possibility of moving the guns anywhere in France.\n\nUpon the arrival of the Newport News on July 8, the naval battery was ready to proceed with the assembly work.\n\nThe Army’s experience had demonstrated that in all cases it was advisable not to start actual erection until all material necessary for a complete unit was actually on hand and in the yard. This proved to be the best practice with the Navy material as well, for in making hasty shipments from the United States it was impossible to separate the enormous number of parts into those pertaining to individual trains; and, consequently, at St. Nazaire, when the first ship arrived, it was found that necessary component parts were missing and nothing was to be gained by commencing the erection of material before all had reached port and been unloaded.\n\nThe locomotive and car erection began on July 20. The assembly of the first gun was begun on July 26, and the first train was completed and ready to leave St. Nazaire on August 11.\n\nIn all the assembly work the men were seriously handicapped, for, in some unexplainable manner, all blue prints were missing. The resourcefulness of the American bluejacket was here again made evident, for those who had been detailed to assist in the inspection work at the Baldwin Locomotive Works and the Standard Steel Car Co. had kept individual notebooks. They had taken them to France, and with the sketches that these notebooks contained\n\n______________\n\n12 See Pt. 11, “Dangers of voyage.”\n\n--8--\n\nINTERIOR OF AMMUNITION CAR.\n\nDETAILS OF FORWARD END OF GUN CAR.\n\nmany an unknown step in the putting together of the gun ears and the various other parts was accomplished.\n\nIt is needless to state that the work at St. Nazaire was done under high pressure. Rear Admiral Plunkett was continually receiving urgent requests to expedite the work and get his guns to the front.13\n\nIt was especially urged that some of the guns get into action immediately in order to search out and destroy the German long-range guns that were bombarding Paris. Two were not ready with the least possible delay. The first train left St. Nazaire on August 18, after having been inspected by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the second train on August 19. the destination of both being Helles-Mouchy. passing over the lines of the Orleans, the Etat. and the Ford systems. The speed was set for 6 miles an hour, as it was thought best not to attempt a greater speed until the railway beds and the French rolling stock had been thoroughly tested.14\n\nThough the bombardment of Paris had ceased before the naval batteries were ready for action, tests were begun at once, both to try out the condition of the guns and to demonstrate their efficiency to the foreign officers. Battery No. 1 was moved from Helles-Mouchy to the French proving ground at Nuisemont on August 28, and Battery No. 2 Avas moved to Rethondes in the forest of Compiegne to bombard a railway center at Tergnier.15\n\nThese tests were highly successful.16\n\nIt was apparent from the beginning that the American naval guns were wanted all along the front, and they were constantly moved from point to point until the armistice was signed. Battery No. 1 was moved from the French proving ground to Soissons. where, on September 11, action position was taken near the cemetery of St. Christophe. Battery No. 2 proceeded to Fontenoy-Ambleny; meanwhile the remaining three batteries were completed at St. Nazaire, and left there for Haussimont (Marne) the latter part of September. No. 4 arrived at Haussimont on September 23, No. 3 on September 24, and No. 5 on September 26.\n\nTHE MILITARY SITUATION IN FRANCE.\n\nThe situation on the west front at this time Avas propitious for a • demonstration to the desperate enemy of a new engine of unprecedented power. The Teuton armies were now at bay. In spite of repeated denials by the German Government, both the German high command and the German people were forced to acknowledge that\n\n_____________\n\n13 See Pt.

II, \"The first tests.\"\n\n--9--\n\nthe picked youth of America had arrived in great and ever-increasing numbers and that the beginning of the end was in sight. The promise of a definite victory of the U boats within a short time spurred the German troops on to hold their ground, or to yield it as slowly as possible.\n\nThe discovery of the presence of these formidable engines of war, far more powerful than any that had yet appeared in the campaign, must have been extremely disconcerting to the German leaders; and the military effect, as great as it was, must have been even surpassed by. the blow to their morale. Austro-Hungary was weakening, and her note reached President Wilson during the very week in which our last naval guns left St. Nazaire for the front.\n\nTHE NAVAL GUNS IN ACTION.17\n\nThe naval batteries operated in France as five separate and independent units under the command of Rear Admiral C. P. Plunkett. His chief assistants were Lieut. Commanders G. L. Schuyler and J. B. Bunkley. The batteries were commanded as follows:\n\nNo. 1 by Lieut. J. A.

Throughout all these thousands of miles of travel the equipment of the batteries stood up well, and the guns operated continuously from the date the first one arrived at the front until the moment when their fire was ceased by terms of the armistice.19\n\nIn general, Batteries Nos. 1 and 2 operated with the French armies, while Batteries Nos. 3, 4, and 5 operated with the American Army at Verdun. During the Meuse-Argonne offensive No. 2 Battery was recalled from the French front and with Nos. 3, 4, and 5 kept the main\n\n____________\n\n18 See page 19 for firing positions of each battery.\n\n19 See Pt. II. Log of the naval railway batteries.\n\n-- 11--\n\narteries of communication back of the German lines under constant fire clay and night. After completing its mission No. 2 was returned to the French.\n\nPrior to the assignment of targets for these guns on the French front the French proved Battery No. 1 at their proving ground at Nuisemont. They gave this giant gun a target located about 18 miles distant. Four shots were fired and all landed almost within a stone’s throw of each other. The French general was so pleased with the result of the firing that he immediately went to Rear Admiral Plunkett and, after congratulating him, said: “Waste no more ammunition, but go and fire it against the Germans.” After the proof firing of Battery No. 1 it was ordered to Soissons to commence a bombardment of the railroad yards at Laon. Here for the next 30 days, despite enemy counterfire and the bombs of aviators falling constantly around the gun car, the bombardment of the railroad yards was kept up.\n\nTo Naval Railway Battery No. 2, commanded by Lieut. (J. G.) E. D. Duckett, United States Navy, goes the proud distinction of having fired the first American shell from an American gun manned by American gunners at the Germans on the western front in the World War.20 On September 6 from a point in the forest of Compiegne Battery No. 2 fired a shot at Tergnier, an important German railroad center, which was being hard pressed by the Allies. After the first shot the Germans began to evacuate the city, and no more shots were fired.\n\nFrom this position the gun went to Fontenoy-Ambleny and began the shelling of an enormous ammunition dump located by the Germans in Besny-et-Loisy. Thirty-two rounds sufficed to wipe out this ammunition dump. From this point the gun left for Flavy-le-Martel and commenced firing on Mortiers, another important railroad center. Thirty-eight rounds were placed in this town, and on October 16 the Germans withdrew. After the withdrawal of the Germans from Mortiers the American Expeditionary Forces sent an urgent request for gun No. 2 and assigned it a position at Charny, near Verdun. The gun was rushed to this point and installed, and, on the day of\n\n_____________\n\n20 Our entry into the war found us with few of the auxiliaries necessary for its conduct in the modern sense. The task of the Ordnance Department in supplying artillery was especially difficult. In order to meet our requirements as rapidly as possible, we accepted the offer of the French Government to supply us with the artillery equipment of 75’s, 155-mm. howitzers, and 155 G. P. F. guns from their own factories for 30 divisions. The wisdom of this course was fully demonstrated by the fact that, although we soon began the manufacture of these classes of guns at home, there were no guns of American manufacture of the calibers mentioned on our front at the date of the armistice. The only guns of these types produced at home which reached France before the cessation of hostilities were one hundred and nine 75-mm. guns. In addition twenty-four 8-inch howitzers from the United States reached our front and were in use when the armistice was signed. Eight 14-inch naval guns of American manufacture were set up on railroad mounts, and most of these were successfully employed on the Meuse-Argonne front under the efficient direction of Admiral Plunkett, of the Navy. (Gen. Pershing’s special report to the Secretary of War, December, 1919.)\n\n--12--\n\nCROSSING WOODEN TRESTLE IN FRANCE.\n\nFIRST GUN ASSEMBLED MOVING TO TRACKS FOR COMPLETION.\n\nits arrival, commenced a bombardment of the town and railroad center of Montmédy. Cessation of firing, due to the signing of the armistice, found this gun at Lunéville ready to begin operations against Metz.\n\nBatteries Nos. 3, 4, and 5, left St. Nazaire on the 12th, 13th, and 14th of September, respectively, and after a considerable stay at the American reserve artillery base, were given orders to depart for positions near Verdun, from which they were to open fire on the German main line of communications, running from Metz to Sedan.\n\nThe account of the Bureau of Ordnance contains the following comment:\n\nA glance at the map will show the importance of this target. At that time the battle front around Verdun ran in almost a straight line due northwest. A railroad connecting the cities of Metz and Sedan also ran in almost a straight line, paralleling the front and rendering it very easy for the Germans to shift troops from one point to another all along the lines between these two cities. The Germans had held this battle line for so long that they had brought this railroad to a high state of efficiency. The only alternative line for the transportation of troops from Metz to Sedan was a small and poorly built railroad running almost due north from Metz to Luxemburg City and from Luxemburg City almost due west to Sedan. These railroads formed a right-angled triangle.21 Should the Americans be successful in cutting the straight line of communication from Metz to Sedan, it would force the enemy to transport troops by the 50 per cent longer route through Luxemburg and over the poorly improved tracks, etc., of the longer railroad. From this it may be readily appreciated why a captured German document referred to the Sedan-Metz railroad line as “the most important artery of the army of the west.”\n\nThe city of Longuyon was a detraining point on this Metz-Sedan line, containing a main railroad yard with 15 long sidings and numerous storehouses. Montmédy had a large railroad yard, which frequently contained 400 cars, was the headquarters of the Seventh German Army, and had large troop barracks and an aviation field. Conflans was also an important railroad and detraining center, having 20 long sidings in the railroad yard and, in addition, a goodsized roundhouse and repair shop. The destruction of these centers could not fail to have an enormous effect on the facilities with which German operations on the western front could be conducted.\n\nNaval Railway Batteries Nos. 3, 4, and 5 arrived at Verdun early in October, were quickly set in position, and commenced firing. The commencement of bombardment by the naval batteries was the signal for an intense effort on the part of the enemy to put them out of action. Shell bursts occurred regularly within 30 feet of the berthing cars and within short distances of the guns themselves. Numer-\n\n____________\n\n21 One of the most prominent of the enemy commanders, Ludendorff, writing of the trench warfare on the western front states his point of view that large numbers of heavy flat trajectory guns such as these Navy 14-inch 50-caliber guns are essential. “as fire falling well into the back areas had been found very effective, rendering supply and relief to the front lines more difficult, and during actual operations hindering the distribution of orders and the employment of reserves.”\n\n--13--\n\nous times the armor plate covering the gun car and ammunition car alone prevented them from sustaining serious damage. In addition, airplanes were frequently flying overhead and dropping bombs.\n\nUp to the arrival of the naval railway batteries, these important troop and railroad centers on the Metz-Sedan line held by the Germans had been immune from artillery fire, for they were several thousand yards beyond the range of the biggest of the allied guns. The arrival of the naval railway batteries at the front greatly helped to turn the tide in the Allies’ favor and contributed largely to the consternation created in the German forces by the vigorous tactics of the Americans.\n\nDespite German counterattacks, a constant bombardment of the targets of Longuyon and Montmédy was maintained by the naval railway batteries. Battery No. 3 selected as its particular target the Longuyon aviation hangars and field; Battery No. 4, the railroad tunnel at Montmédy and the Montmédy yards; and Battery No. 5, the railroad yards at South Longuyon. On November 3, Battery No. 3 was moved to Charny and took for its target the freight yards at Montmédy. On November 4 an airplane observer reported the entire lower Montmédy freight yards on fire. Two days later, it was determined officially and so credited that the shells from Battery No. 3 had accomplished this work.\n\nThere was no let-up in the steady fire of the naval batteries at their respective targets until the last moment before the armistice went into effect. Battery No. 4 fired its last shot at 10.57.30 a. m. on the morning of November 11. This permitted the shot to land a few seconds before 11 o’clock.\n\nSUMMARY OF FIRINGS.\n\nThe five naval batteries fired a total of 782 rounds against the enemy, as follows:\n\nReport of firing.\n\nBATTERIES NOS. 1 AND 2.\n\nDate.

There was no such thing as lightly and heavily engaged, and the guns did not engage the enemy. They were used for strategical purposes entirely and fired at ranges between 30,000 and 40,000 yards. Other artillery, of which there was a great quantity, could accomplish with less expenditure of ammunition and expense all the results that were desired at the shorter ranges. The number of rounds fired at any one time or on one day was governed by the results which they desired to obtain.\n\nThe ammunition supply for guns to be used in the field of active operations should be measured entirely by the life of the gun. It was not believed that the accuracy of the 14-inch guns would be more than 300 rounds and the Navy’s provision for 300 rounds for each gun proved entirely adequate.”\n\nMETHOD OF FIRING.\n\nAll naval railway batteries were permanently assigned to the Railway Artillery Reserve of the First American Army, with advance base at Haussimont (Marne). From here they were “farmed out” to either a French or American sector as the strategic situation warranted. The following briefly describes the procedure in the case of a gun temporarily assigned to a French sector:23\n\nUpon receiving the new assignment the battery commander first ascertained whether the new target could be reached from the posi-\n\n____________\n\n22 Lieut. Commander L. B. Bye, “United States Naval Institute Proceedings, June, 1919.”\n\n23 See Pt. II, “General firing orders of the French general staff.”\n\n-- 15--\n\ntion where the gun was already emplaced. If not the gun remained temporarily in the old position and the commander chose the new position from a study of the latest corrected railway map furnished by the Regulateur Général d’Artillerie. The new position was then fixed, sometimes on a railway track already in existence, but often on a curved spur or siding built for the purpose. The gun having been placed in exact position in absolutely correct line of fire by technical means not necessary to describe here, and placed over its new pit, all necessary cars and material were placed in a safe position from a quarter of a mile to a mile behind the firing position and everything carefully covered and camouflaged so as to escape the notice of the enemy aviators, who took photographs of the whole line at least once a month during the war.\n\nAiming points (prominent marks such as steeples or artificially placed objects) were then fixed near by for calculating purposes and telephonic communication established with the nearest artillery post and the nearest meteorological observation station (sondage station), which sent out broadcast every half hour in radio code an exact statement of its height above sea level, the velocity and direction of the wind at different altitudes, and the latest barometrical readings. All these data were collected and kept by an officer, who, if conditions prevented their regular distribution, could make fairly accurate calculations from the reports already received and tabulated.\n\nThe more important calculations, such as firing angles, were made by the battery commander himself. Shortly after the arrival of orders to be ready to fire at the new target an airplane arrived and reported to the commander for services as air spotters. This plane contained a pilot and an artillery expert, who were instructed in regard to two matters. The first was the particular part or section of the target (often an area a mile long) which his corrections of the fall of the shells should refer to in signaling back to the battery commander. The second was the position of the so-called signal panels (panneaux), which were used to signal back to the planes, since these could send but not receive radio messages. These panels were four in number and consisted of white sheets, a large one 9 by 9 meters in area and three others 9 by 3 meters, which were laid at some distance from the gun upon a flat, exposed piece of ground, to windward of the gun, so as not to be obscured by smoke, gas, etc. The officer in charge of the panels was in telephonic communication with the battery commander. When firing was to begin the airplane proceeded across the enemy lines to ascertain whether the target was visible enough for observation purposes. If so, it returned far enough toward the naval gun to see the panel station. The big sheet’s presence meant that all was ready. The pilot then radioed\n\n--16--\n\nthe battery, “Are you ready to fire? ” The answer “Yes” was expressed (on command by phone from the battery) by one of the smaller sheets being spread at an agreed angle next to the larger sheet.24 The airplane then returned to a position above the target to be bombarded and, within a few minutes, sent the signal to fire. The gun then fired three shots in quick succession, the fall of each projectile being observed and noted by the artillerist observer, who then made an estimate for correction of aim for all three shots together, not individually, the message being so and so many meters to right or left, or over or short, as the case might be.\n\nThe battery commander then applied the correction to his “spotting map,”25 found out what it equaled in yards (all American measurements being in yards, not meters), worked out the correction, and changed the aim of the gun. While the plane was returning after the first three shots, this correction was made and the gun loaded for the second series of shots.26\n\nUnfortunately it was impossible, for many reasons, to secure satisfactory airplane observation, only a small proportion of the 782 rounds being fired under such advantageous conditions. The system of spotting by airplane was an excellent one, but atmospheric conditions generally proved unfavorable. The plane had to attain a height of 5,000 or 6,000 yards, which meant that any clouds lying lower prevented vision. Frequently, too, when the weather looked ideal from the ground, with clouds flying high or no clouds at all and plenty of sun, there would be a low-lying mist that prevented spotting from a plane, though unnoticeable from the earth. Thus the signal “observation impossible” from the airplane often seemed incomprehensible to the battery commander.\n\nThe air was also full of all kinds of radio interference, and our planes were of course always actively opposed by the enemy guns and aircraft. All this accounts for the facts that, except for about 10 per cent of the shots fired, the artillerist had to get along without aircraft observation, and had to rely on calculations made from the known distance of the target and the ballistic capabilities of the gun. It was generally taken for granted that, when the gun had been aimed in accordance with these calculations, the projectile would fall not farther than 400 yards over or short of the center of the target, or more than 200 yards to one side. The problem was then to distribute the fire so that a large proportion of the shots would land on the region aimed at. The two great drawbacks to accurate firing of large guns at extreme ranges are the error in calculations (in fire control)\n\n______________\n\n24 See Pt. II, “Signals between airplanes and batteries.\"\n\n25 A chart divided into metric unit squares, the reported point of fall of each shot, or group ol shots, being noted upon it.\n\n26 At the extreme range, say about 41,000 yards, or from 24 to 25 miles, the time of flight of a projectile was about a minute and a half.\n\n-- 17--\n\nand the dispersion of the gun itself, by which is meant the dispersion of the shots on the target, even when fired when the gun is in the very same aiming position.\n\nIt is apparent, even to the layman, that getting results with this kind of firing “in the dark” is a most difficult thing, which makes still more worthy of admiration the extraordinary accuracy of the fire of our naval batteries in France, as afterwards shown by examination of the targets bombarded.\n\nFor example, no observation was obtained at any time while operating in the Verdun sector, and the only way of obtaining any idea of the results of the firings was through the intelligence service. On November 5 the southern part of Montmédy was reported on fire; on November 11 a German prisoner reported that the firing on Montmédy had caused a great deal of damage, one shell landing in the yards and killing all the Germans in two coaches.\n\nEFFECTS OF THE FIRING.\n\nIn regard to the actual, concrete effects of the bombardments by the naval batteries, it is evident that, on account of the unusually long ranges and the fact that the great majority of shots were fired without adequate observation, reports are of necessity somewhat unsatisfactory; but after examining all the evidence, direct and indirect, the conclusion is compelling, that the effects were very substantial in reality and still more so in their threat for the future.27\n\nIt is pointed out by Lieut. Commander G. L. Schuyler and others that Artillery preparation before attacks at the front was done by guns not of the largest caliber. The real function of the naval batteries was a peculiar and a deliberate one. It was principally to fire at freight yards and railway centers far behind the lines. The fire was usually withheld until several hours after an Infantry attack, which was usually about daybreak. If the guns had fired at the beginning of the offensive they would have shown the enemy the lines of communication covered, and he would have routed his trains another way round. It was therefore obviously wiser to wait\n\n_____________\n\n27 Rear Admiral Plunkett, in a personal letter written early in November, 1918, says: “You have no idea what the extra few thousand yards mean in this game, both tactically and strategically. The difference opens up areas for destruction which are clearly beyond anything in existence here. It brings about situations for the enemy which are very difficult for him to handle, and which have a direct effect upon his tactics and strategy. Four years of this war have been laregly [sic] devoted to meeting the so-called German offensive, and, now that the Allies have taken the offensive, it is necessary that we keep him guessing all the time, and the great element of surprise that is involved in the additional range that these guns give has a very strong effect upon the enemy in everything he is doing or plans to do; and, with rapid movements from place to place, he never knows when he will have to pull his freight or leave it for the Allies to grab.”\n\n28 See Pt. II, “Nature of gunnery work done by the United States naval railway battery in France.” [Footnote tag missing in original text.]\n\n-- 18--\n\nuntil his reserves and ammunition cars were being rushed up to support his troops, and then bombard the railway centers at a moment when they were most crowded. Thus heavy, long-range batteries do not work in a haphazard or continuous way, but at the proper tactical moment. Firing between times, \"for good measure,\" is not simply wasteful, but it is calculated to help the enemy, and may at times prove disastrous. It had therefore to be prohibited. Naturally it was difficult at first for the personnel to appreciate the higher wisdom of this. The fact that it took a couple of days to dig the pit and make our 14-inch railway guns ready for firing, was not at all the handicap which it was expected at first it might be. All particulars of the target were in general known perhaps a week in advance. Everything could be worked out ahead of time in utmost detail and arranged in the most convenient form, so that during actual firing there was nothing to deal with except spotting corrections.\n\nAs a matter of fact, we attained results quickly because experience was gained at a rapid rate. There were no guns in action that approached ours in range except four 340-mm. French naval guns. A French gun was seen that had fired 280 rounds during the war, or about 70 rounds per year, while on more than one occasion our naval batteries fired 50 rounds or more in a single day.\n\nConcerning the effects that could be accurately studied later, Lieut. Commander Bye says in his \"Naval institute proceedings\" article:\n\nThe German retreat from Laon left the former targets of the naval railway batteries in the hands of the Allies. Rear Admiral Plunkett on October 14 visited this sector, going over the ground carefully. It was not difficult to recognize the shell craters formed by the explosion of the 14-inch naval projectiles. They were easily identified by their uniform size and great extent, and some contained a few fragments of the shells themselves, from which identification was made positive. The fragmentation of the shells was most excellent. No \"duds\" were found. All fuses functioned, and the nose of one shell was found 5 kilometers from the target. General Mangin and the French artillery command were delighted with the work of the guns, for when working with the map only and without aeroplane observation the shots in nearly all cases were effective hits, and where aeroplane spotting had been possible and the corrections applied on subsequent shots they had been perfectly placed.\n\nThe effect on the railroads leading out of Laon was all that could be desired. One hit from the 14-inch naval guns was sufficient to wreck a railroad line of three tracks for a distance of at least 100 feet, tearing the rails up, shattering the ties, and blowing an enormous crater in the roadbed. Although the Germans would repair at night the damage done by the guns and thus maintain some communication, the interruption must have caused them serious concern, both when holding their ground before Laon and also during their retreat.\n\nIn the way of concrete evidence regarding the punishment inflicted upon the Germans, Admiral Plunkett learned that one projectile had struck a German moving picture theater during a performance, killing 40 outright and severely\n\n-- 19--\n\nmangling at least 60 others. Two other shells struck this same moving picture theater and it was completely demolished, together with several surrounding buildings. One freight train on a siding had been struck and one car was completely lifted from the track and thrown a distance of about 30 feet.\n\nIt is easy to appreciate the effect on the morale of the enemy by an occurrence of this kind, when a whole audience, enjoying in apparently complete security a harmless picture show, is suddenly wiped out by a new and hitherto unsuspected engine of destruction.29\n\nAfter the signing of the armistice on November 11, Montmédy, Longuyon, Mangiennes, Louppy, and Remoiville were visited, and some of the results of the firing were obtained from observation and from questioning the civilian population that remained. The guns apparently were- firing a few hundred yards beyond the ranges, calculated from the range table, but the damage to both material and morale was considerable. The targets were struck frequently, and the traffic was stopped completely, not only during the actual firing but from 6 to 10 hours each day after the firing had ceased. As the railroad running through Longuyon and Montmédy was the only line by which troops could be brought to Sedan other than a railroad running far to the north through Luxemburg, the cutting of this line was a strategical victory of great importance. Gen. Pershing in his report states in his description of the last phase of the Meuse-Argonne offensive: \"Our large-caliber guns had advanced and were skillfully brought into position to fire upon the important lines at Montmédy, Longuyon, and Conflans—the strategical goal which was our highest hope was gained. We had cut the enemy’s main line of communications and nothing but surrender or an armistice could save his army from complete disaster.\"\n\nUnder date of November 7, 1918, Vice Admiral Sims reported to the Chief of Naval Operations as follows:\n\nThe 14-inch 50-caliber United States naval railway guns have done very excellent and valuable work, particularly in the recent pushes. Three of these guns have been in the sector opposite Mezières, and have had the railways to and from that place under effective gunfire for some time.\n\nThe accuracy of these guns have proved greater than was expected. With a gun that had fired 150 rounds 24 observed rounds were fired at a range of 35,800 yards. The mean dispersion obtained was plus or minus 151 yards in range, and plus or minus 51 yards in deflection. The ballistic correction in this case was about 2,800 yards. The shots were fired about 5 minutes apart.\n\nConsidering the relation of the total pattern size to mean dispersion in a salvo, it is estimated that these results would work out, in the case of a 12-gun salvo, to a pattern of about 650 yards in range and about 220 yards in deflection at 35,800, the guns being all considered as having fired about 150 times since proof. A careful analysis of the results obtained under existing conditions appears to indicate that a gup may shoot accurately while both muzzle erosion and considerable coppering exists.\n\nHad the war not ended when it did the vicinity of Metz would have been the scene of an offensive such as even this great war had not seen. A tremendous force of soldiery, aided by an accumulation of mobile and heavy artillery of unprecedented strength and number,\n\n______________\n\n28 See Pt.

At one time three American engineers, not members of the naval personnel, were killed during one of these artillery attacks, and five soldiers were killed at Charny; while one shell that killed two and injured several others fell within 50 feet of the battery telephone control station. On another occasion the headquarters cars and a berthing car were derailed.

This shot was fired at 10.59 a. m., into Longuyon by James A. Kaffka, S.F., first class, United States Navy, who energized the firing key and caused the primer to function. This primer is now in the possession of Rear Admiral Earle, Chief of Bureau of Ordnance.\n\nOn November 23, 1918, the commanding officer of the naval railway batteries in France, Rear Admiral C. P. Plunkett, made an informal address to the assembled personnel, which he ended with the following words:\n\nI want to add here that there never will come again in my mind any question in regard to the American manhood meeting any situation. When we started out on this thing, the Navy Department told us that we could not have any of the Regular Navy people. They said: If you are going to put this tiling through, you are to make it with people that you make yourself and that you can find somewhere, and I must admit that I had some misgiving at one time;\n\n_____________\n\n30 See Pt. II, \"The order that ended the war.\"\n\n--21--\n\nbut after we had finished the “Battle of St. Nazaire”31 I was satisfied that this outfit would go to Berlin and there was nothing that could stop them. But there lias been something to stop them—the Boche has given in, and now we are going to return home, and I feel with you and know that you feel that every minute and every hour which you have given to the naval railway batteries has been given in the best possible way for the defense of your country, and, with that in your minds, you can go back and face any community at any time and they can only take off their hats to you.\n\nIn all our joys and gayeties, in connection with this performance here (meaning in the cinema, Haussimont), we must not forget those men of this force who started out just as full of this as we did, but who, in the performance of their duties, have fallen by the wayside. It is not practicable nor possible for a bunch of people to tackle all the things that we have tackled without somebody getting hurt. But I am happy to say that all three of these men were hurt directly in the line of duty. The men I refer to are:\n\nC. J. Bussell, whom we lost in Philadelphia.\n\nThos. E. Price, who died over here at Mailly (Aube) from walking typhoid. (This boy was from Centerville, Md.)\n\nA. P. Sharpe, who was killed at Thierville by the explosion of a German shell.\n\nI ask you all to rise and sing with me that famous old hymn. “Abide with Me.”\n\nAll of the naval railway batteries were ordered back to the R. A. R. base at Haussimont a few days after the armistice took effect, arriving there on November 22. On November 28 the staff train left Haussimont for St. Nazaire, via Paris, and the other trains followed, one per day, on the succeeding days. By December 11 all batteries had arrived at St. Nazaire. On the same day a draft of 150 men and six officers left for the United States through Brest. On December 13 and 17 the remainder of the personnel left St. Nazaire for the United States, via Brest, with the exception of one officer and 20 men, who were detailed to remain with the guns with orders to disassemble and ship them home at the earliest opportunity. Rear Admiral C. P. Plunkett, United States Navy; Lieut. Commander J. W. Bunkley, United States Navy, his executive officer while commanding the United States naval railway batteries, and a majority of the personnel of the railway batteries arrived in New York on Christmas Eve, 1918, and the entire expedition would have been home before New Year’s except that two or three officers and a number of men were so unfortunate as to be delayed when the Northern Pacific, on which they took passage, ran aground on Fire Island.\n\n______________\n\n31 The whimsical designation of a series of annoying difficulties overcome by the naval batteries personnel during the disembarkation and setting up at St. Nazaire.\n\n-- 22--\n\nPart II.\n\nNOTES AND ADDENDA.\n\nPERSONNEL OF THE BUREAU OF ORDNANCE.\n\nThe following personnel, under the Bureau of Ordnance, had most to do with the design and construction of the 14-inch naval railway batteries used on the battle front in France:\n\nDesign and construction: Rear Admiral Ralph Earle, United States Navy, chief of bureau.

B. Bye's article in “United States Naval Institute Proceedings” for June, 1919.]\n\nFundamentally each battery consisted of a 14-inch 50-caliber naval rifle carried on a special railway mount, together with ammunition cars and auxiliary cars. The gun, with a muzzle velocity of 2,800 foot-seconds, had a maximum range of 42,000 yards. Firing could be effected between angles of zero to 43° elevation. At angles of elevation ranging from zero to 15° the gun could be fired with no support other than the trucks. For firing at any angle within the range of 15° to 43° elevation, it was necessary to place the gun car over\n\n--23--\n\na suitable pit foundation to allow clearance for the 44-inch recoil of the gun. When on this foundation the mount was fixed, and its position remained the same for successive shots, while, when firing at the lower angles upon the track, the energy of recoil was absorbed by the car, which traveled backward on the rails against the resistance of tightened brakes.\n\nThe railway battery was designed to provide utmost freedom from difficulties associated with auxiliary power-driven accessories and from dependence upon a supply base. With exception of a small, combined air compressor and winch, driven by a single gas engine, the mechanical functions of the battery were performed solely by hand power. Compressed air was used in operating the breech mechanism and in the counterrecoil cylinders. Each battery train was provided with ample supplies and spare parts, augmented by stores and equipment carried on the staff train. The cars of the battery train provided facilities for foundation erection, repairs and quarters for the officers and crew. The scope of the battery is indicated by the following list of cars which made up a single battery train:\n\n1 locomotive. 1 battery kitchen car. 1 gun car. 2 ammunition cars. 1 construction car. 3 berthing cars. 1 construction car with crane. 1 battery headquarters car. 1 sand and log car. 1 battery headquarters kitchen car. 1 fuel car. 1 workshop car.\n\nThe locomotives and all the cars were designed to conform to the regulations of the French state railways. Exclusive of the gun car, the various cars were standard flat cars, gondolas, and box cars similar to those supplied to the American Expeditionary Forces in France, and they could be used in conjunction with the French railway equipment. The fittings of the battery headquarters, berthing, and commissary cars, such as bunks, stoves, and other appurtenances, were, for the most part, standard naval fittings which could be replenished at any naval base.\n\nWhile in France the guns were never fired from the rails at low angles of elevation. In all cases the firings were conducted from the pit foundation and at ranges near the maximum. There was never any criticism due to the necessity for installation of the pit foundation. Ample material was provided for the construction of as many as 12 pits, and there was always sufficient time to prepare a firing position in advance of the time set for moving up the gun. In the preparation of a site for firing the construction cars were brought to the point selected and were used to handle the timbers and steel framework employed in the foundation. The gun car was pushed over the completed foundation, the truck wheels were locked by brakes, and the weight of the car was transferred to the founda-\n\n-- 24--\n\ntion by means of jacks and lifting screws. In this position a traversing gear provided for 2 1/2° train on either side of the center line of the foundation. During action an ammunition car was brought to the rear of the gun car. Ammunition was conveyed to the breech of the gun by a monorail crane in the ammunition car and a shell tray mounted on a track in the gun car. The personnel of each battery was sufficient to insure satisfactory individual operation. In addition to the officers and crew necessary for the operation of the staff train, its complement included medical and engineer officers and a crew detailed to transportation work among the various batteries as circumstances required. The staff train was made up of the following cars:\n\n1 locomotive. 1 staff construction car. 1 staff quarters car. 1 staff workshop car. 1 staff kitchen and dispensary car. 1 staff commissary car. 1 spare parts car. 1 staff berthing car.\n\nFor information concerning the details of the gun car the following brief description is given:\n\nThe gun car consists essentially of two longitudinal girders, fabricated of steel plates and structural shapes, and provided with suitable transverse stiffeners. The car is run on two front and two rear six-wheel trucks. A housing in the form of an inverted U is provided at each end of the girders for the forward and rear jacking beams used for raising the gun car off from the trucks and placing the car upon the pit foundation. Beneath the jacking beam a center pin casting serves as a socket for the center pin of the car truck. A little forward of the center of the car is a transom casting, against which the transom bed plate bears when the car is jacked up on the pit foundation. Cast integrally with the transom is the pin which engages the transom bed plate of the foundation and the lugs that support the oscillating bearing of the elevating mechanism. The transom is rigidly fixed to the gun girders and is designed to transmit stresses incident to firing to the foundation through the transom bed plate, secured to the inboard side of the girders immediately above the transom by the two deck lugs that support the gun.\n\nEach truck has three axles turning in 9 by 12 inch brass journals; the wheels are 36 inches in diameter. The incorporation of the 14-inch gun into the gun car was done in such a way that navy standard fittings could be used as much as possible and the gun, gun slide, breech mechanism, and deck lugs were of standard navy design, except that slight modifications were necessary in order to provide for elevations up to 43°. The entire arrangement may be likened to a navy turret installation for a single gun of the Mississippi class, mounted on a railway car in such a manner that it may be transported over railways, and when placed on its foundation, fired re-\n\n-- 25--\n\npeatedly at elevations from 15° to 43° and with a maximum angle of train of 2 1/2° on either side of the center line of the foundation.\n\nThe counterrecoil mechanism as used in these railway mounts is of interest; for, as originally designed, it was not intended that it would function at angles greater than 30°. In order to provide the increased energy necessary to return the gun to battery at the higher angles of elevation, the counterrecoil spring cylinders were modified so that the action of the springs could be augmented by a pneumatic system designed to act with the springs in returning the guns to battery. Air was furnished by the air compressor for this system of counterrecoil as well as for the gas ejector system, and it proved highly efficient even during continuous firing when charged to an initial pressure of about 125 pounds.\n\nThe gun was laid in elevation, for firing, by means of a gunner’s quadrant .and for azimuth by a surveyor’s transit mounted on a sight support, which extended out from the trunnion and projected through the side of the car. Except in a very few cases, all firings in France were conducted without observation, and the accuracy with which the guns could be laid in azimuth and in elevation for map firing and indirect firing proved to be as precise as necessary.\n\nThe total weight of the gun car complete is in the neighborhood of 535,000 pounds, distributed as follows:\n\nPounds. Gun, breech mechanism and yoke 192,500 Slide, complete 50,700 Elevating gear (screw) 650 Elevating gear (nut) 2,930 Elevating gear details 1,860 Deck lugs (2) 10,200 Transom casting 10,000 Cab 12,400 Shell-loading device 1,290 Girders, including the braces (2) 135,830 Trucks (4) 80,000 Truck beams (2) 33,000 Compressor, winch and engine 1,800\n\nThe pit excavation and gun-car foundation were designed to meet every contingency that might arise in the field. At the same time it was realized that numerous problems of construction and operation impossible to forecast would have to be solved in practice by the personnel. Approximately 103 cubic yards of earth had to be removed for installing the foundation. The pit had to be dug, and then by means of a crane car the timberwork and structural steel girders were put in place. The transom bedplate casting by which the firing reactions were transmitted to the foundations was required to be approximately level, and the pit had to be installed so that the axis of this casting or the center line of the foundation was in the approximate line of fire.\n\n-- 26--\n\nIt was at first thought that the necessity for this pit arrangement might be a severe handicap for the operation of the guns in France, for it was known that considerable time would be necessary for its installation. It proved, however, that this means of taking up the reactions of the gun while firing was decidedly superior to other methods in use, where the gun car recoiled for some distance along the track after each shot. The installation of the pit required from 30 to 36 hours, while the gun could be placed over it in from one hour to one hour and a half. When the gun car was once locked on its foundation, the entire mechanism was stable and properly lined up for continuous and rapid shooting.1\n\n______________\n\n1Navy Ordnance Activities, World War, p. 183, says: To enable the gun to lire at angles of elevation greater than 15°, arrangements for a pit and foundation, as mentioned above, were provided. Immediately below the elevating gear, and securely fastened to the girder webs and flanges, is a heavy steel casting called the transom bedplate casting. A similar casting is provided in the foundation. The entire foundation is prepared In advance, it usually taking about 20 hours to get it ready. It is, of course, prepared in advance of the arrival of the gun car at any point at which the gun is to operate. The pit is dug, and, by means of the crane car provided, the timber work backing and the structural steel girders are put in place. The foundation bedplate casting is then put into position, and the girders, designed to carry the rails and the weight of the gun car when it is rolled into position over the foundation, are placed.\n\nTo prepare the gun for firing from the pit foundation is then a matter of but a few minutes. The car is run over the foundation until the transom bedplate casting of the gun car is directly over the bedplate casting of the foundation. One hundred ton ball bearing jacks are then placed under the corners of the H beams at each end of the gun girder, and the entire gun car is lifted from the trucks a distance of about 4 inches. By means of screw jacks, provided in the bedplate casting of the foundation, it is brought up until it engages with the transom bedplate casting of the gun car and the load of the car rests upon it. The girders, carrying the railroad track, are then moved to either side of the center line of the track, leaving a clear space in which the gun may recoil. Screw jacks are placed under the heels of the girder to prevent side sway and the 100-ton jacks are removed from the forward jacking beams, allowing the entire weight of the gun car to rest on the foundation and rear jacks. The gun is now ready to fire.\n\nAccurate aim, when firing from the rails, is obtained by firing from a curved track, a change in position of the gun car along the track causing a corresponding change in the azimuth of the gun. When firing from the pit, however, this is not possible. Accurate aim of the gun on the foundation is secured through a traversing gear, which permits the entire gun girder to be swung about the forward transom bedplate pivot through a horizontal angle of 5°, 2 1/2° on each side of the center line of the tracks. As this angle of traverse represents a deflection on either side of the center line of 500 yards at a range of 23,000 yards, corresponding to an elevation of 15°, and correspondingly greater deflections at greater elevations, it is evident that this angle of traverse is ample for all purposes.\n\nThe traversing gear is simply a worm shaft turning in a bearing, cast integral with the rear H jacking beam, and operating against the girder. It is operated by ratchet wrenches, and it has worked with entire satisfaction.\n\nThe loading of the gun is accomplished with an ingenious device consisting of a rollerbearing trolley car mounted on an inclined I beam, the lower end of which is placed level with the breech of the gun when the gun is in loading position, level. The 1,400-pound projectile Is brought from the ammunition car on a monorail hoist and placed on this trolley. The loading crew then grasp handles at the sides of the trolley and run the length of the car with it. The car is brought to rest against hydraulic buffers at the end of the I beam, while the momentum of the shell is sufficient to carry it the length of the powder chamber and into the bore of the gun, where it is brought to rest by the forcing of the copper rotating band into the rifling of the gun.\n\nThe entire gun ear is sheathed in one-quarter-inch armor plate. A small combination gas-engine driven air compressor and winch is placed on the forward truck of the gun car.\n\n--27--\n\nAWARD OF THE CONTRACTS.\n\nThe leading men of concerns in the United States for building railway cars, steam locomotives, and constructing bridges were called together in Washington. The importance of the project was explained to them to make them realize the necessity for breaking all previous records of war production if they should undertake the work and complete their part in time to enable the guns to participate in the great offensives that were to take place in France during the summer of 1918. To obtain satisfactory bids for this vast amount of work it was necessary in placing the contracts to avoid interference with other important war supplies for the United States Army, the United States Navy, and the Allied Governments.\n\nIt appeared at first as though the bureau was demanding the fulfillment of impossible conditions. The engineers representing these large manufacturing concerns were thrilled with its extent and appreciated its possibilities; but the task appeared to them impossible, until, during the second conference, Mr. Samuel M. Vauclain, chairman of the Munitions Committee of the War Industries Board, assured the Bureau of Ordnance that the Baldwin Locomotive Works would build the gun cars with the assistance of the American Bridge Co. in from 100 to 120 days. The president of the Standard Steel Car Co., Mr. J. M. Hansen, was so stirred by Mr. Vauclain’s enthusiasm and patriotism that he also came forward and promised to deliver the entire number of auxiliary cars in the same time. The first step in the actual building of the mounts, therefore, was to award to the Baldwin Locomotive Works the building of the six necessary locomotives and the five gun cars, and to the Standard Steel Car Co. the construction of the 12 auxiliary cars.\n\nCOMPLETION OF THE MOUNTS.\n\nFrom the moment that the bids were accepted and contracts awarded the fabrication of the material moved rapidly forward. The construction of the girders by the American Bridge Co. progressed so rapidly that they were delivered to the Eddystone shops of the Baldwin Locomotive Works in less time than had been thought possible. When they were delivered, the shop superintendent was fully prepared to assemble. The trucks, air compressors, winches, castings, and other fittings had been obtained in some manner and assembled at Eddystone, so that when the girders came in, no time was lost in attaching the deck lugs, fitting the elevating mechanisms, placing the girder on its trucks, adjusting the gun slide and putting the gun in place. The Naval Gun Factory furnished for each mount all of the strictly ordnance parts; i. e., the gun, slide, deck lugs, elevating gear,\n\n-- 28--\n\nbreech mechanism, loading device, etc. And in performing this vast amount of work they were always a few days ahead of time. The first mount was scheduled for delivery on May 15, 1918. Mr. S. M. Vauclain, senior vice president of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, made the schedule out himself only to have it broken, for the first mount was completed at the Eddystone plant of the Baldwin Locomotive Works on the morning of April 25, 1918. The last mount was scheduled for June 15, but was completed on May 25.\n\nThere were no changes in the design to delay construction. Plates for the girders were rolled at Pittsburgh and rushed in special cars to the American Bridge Co.’s fabricating plant at Pencoyd, Pa. The material furnished by the Washington Naval Gun Factory was sent to Eddystone by motor trucks, and, in fact, every conceivable method of transportation was used in seeing that the material reached the Baldwin Locomotive Works shops on time. Notwithstanding bad traffic conditions and some of the coldest weather and heaviest snowfalls that the' Eastern States had experienced in many years, the material reached there, and on time.\n\nWhile one end of the Baldwin Locomotive Works shop was engaged in erecting the gun cars, the other end was erecting the locomotives for the expedition. At the plants of the Standard Steel Car Co. located in various parts of the country, the building of the auxiliary cars was pushed so that they too were finished in advance of the delivery schedule. In spite of a serious fire and a severe storm which destroyed a considerable portion of the Hammond, Ind., shops the auxiliary cars were completed by June 1.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS ON THE SUCCESS OF THE TESTS.\n\nAmbassade de France, Attaché Naval,\n\nWashington, May 2, 1918.\n\nMy Dear Admiral Earle: The two French artillery officers sent to Sandy Hook to witness the trials of the 14-inch guns on rails, at which I was unhappily unable to assist on account of Admiral Crasset’s presence in Washington, have reported to me the complete success with which they have met. They consider that the Bureau of Ordnance has accomplished a marvelous feat in the rapid construction of these trucks and that the trials have been entirely satisfactory ; there is no doubt that they mark a considerable progress and will prove to be a most remarkable weapon for long-range bombardments.\n\nWill you accept my best thanks for having allowed us to be present at these interesting experiments and also for the courtesies extended to the French officers?\n\nBelieve me, my dear Admiral Earle,\n\nYours, very sincerely,\n\nB. A. Blaupré\n\n_____________\n\nBritish War Mission, Munsey Building,\n\nWashington, D. C., May 1, 1918.\n\nDear Earle: I wonder If you have got a spare copy of the particulars (two blue prints) of the 14-inch mounting, which you showed me yesterday, that you could let me have?\n\n--29--\n\nI am sure my people in England would be immensely interested, and I should like to send them as much information as I could with ray reports of the trials yesterday. If you have drawings showing the general arrangements of the elevating, traversing, and recoil arrangements separately, they would also be much appreciated.\n\nI must again congratulate you and your department most warmly not only on the complete success of the trials, but on the extraordinary quick time in which you have got these mountings out—not to mention the excellence of your arrangements for the comfort of the spectators.\n\nYours, very sincerely,\n\nJohn Headlam.\n\nRear Admiral Earle,\n\nChief of Naval Ordnance,\n\nState, War, and Navy Building, Washington, D. C.\n\n_____________\n\nThe Baldwin Locomotive Works, Philadelphia, Pa.,\n\nWashington, May 13, 1918.\n\nRear Admiral Ralph Earle,\n\nUnited States Navy. Chief, Bureau of Ordnance,\n\nNavy Department, Washington, D. C.\n\nMy Dear Admiral Earle: I spent yesterday (Sunday) morning in the Baldwin Locomotive Works at Eddystone, Pa., and am glad to advise you that the five large gun mounts will be finished complete in every respect ready for shipment Saturday, May 18, or about two weeks ahead of time originally contemplated.\n\nOur people at the works are most enthusiastic over the standard of workmanship on the parts furnished by the Washington Navy Yard to go on these mounts. The last piece arrived 'at 6.40 Saturday evening last.\n\nThis has been a most delightful task. The designs were thoroughly worked out beforehand. Your department knew exactly what it wanted. The parts furnished by the navy yard came through on time and in the best possible shape. Not a single difficulty was experienced and I trust that the service rendered by the Baldwin Locomotive Works may prove satisfactory.\n\nWork has been begun on the three additional mounts and a schedule of delivery will be sent you at an early date.\n\nVery truly, yours,\n\nS. M. Vauclain,\n\nSenior Vice President, Baldwin Locomotive Works.\n\nARRANGEMENTS FOR TRANSPORTATION.\n\nREPORT OF REAR ADMIRAL PLUNKETT.\n\nMay 23, 1918.\n\nTo: The Bureau of Ordnance.\n\n1. In accordance with cablegram, War Department, copy of which has been handed Lieut. Commander Bye this date, instructions have been issued by the Navy to ship material for the 14-inch naval railway battery by the first available naval transport.\n\n2. It is expected that part of this material will be loaded on the U. S. S. Bath, sailing for St. Nazaire direct; also other shipments on the U. S. S. Newport News, and on the U. S. S. Texel, sailing direct.\n\n-- 30--\n\nTop: Lieut. Commander Garrett L. Schuyler, U. S. N. Left: Lieut. Commander, J. W. Bunkley, U. S. N. Right: Lieut. Commander Frank Baldwin, S. C., U. S. N.\n\nLieut. Commander C. S. Stephenson, M. C.\n\nLeft to right: Ensign C. Davis, U. S. N. R. F.; Ensign C. S. Warner, U. S. N. R. F.; Ensign Geo. Cheffey, U. S. N. R. F.; Ensign A. L. Cook, U. S. N. R. F.; Lieut. W. G Smith, U. S. N.; Lieut. Commander J. W. Bunkley, U. S. N.; Lieut. J. L. Rodgers, U. S. N.; Lieut. J. R. Hayden, U. S. N. R. F.; Ensign P. L. Davis, U. S. N. R. F.; Lieut. R. S. Savin, U. S. N.\n\n3. It is requested that the bureau issue any instructions which they may consider necessary to safeguard the handling and shipment of this material to the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts, with a request that they immediately inform their representatives at Philadelphia to exercise proper precautions in the loading of these vessels.\n\n4. It is also requested that the allowance of ammunition be divided among the above-named vessels and shipped at the same time as the material.\n\n5. A large part of the personnel will precede the material with instructions to make all necessary arrangements for the proper reception and erection of the bureau’s material on the other side and for such temporary or permanent storage of the ammunition allowance and reserve as may be determined from time to time.\n\n6 Any suggestions which the bureau may have to make in regard to the handling of this whole situation are earnestly requested, in order that no stone may be left unturned to insure the safety of this material from the time of departure until active operations begin, and as far as possible thereafter.\n\nC. P. Plunkett.\n\nDANGERS OF VOYAGE.\n\nBesides the usual difficulties connected with the shipment of such heavy material the journey to France at this particular time was extremely dangerous. It was during this same interval that German seagoing submarines were operating off our coast, laying mines, and sinking numerous vessels by gunfire. Everyone will recall how persistent these pirates of the sea were in their activities; how they appeared one morning so close inshore off Cape Cod that, while sinking a number of innocent barges by gunfire, the shells actually fell on the beach. The San Diego was sunk by a mine from one of these submarines, and even the U. S. S. Texel, which had been designated to carry a cargo of material for the naval railway batteries, was sunk on June 2 while nearing port, so that another vessel had to be substituted.\n\nDIFFICULTIES OF ASSEMBLY WORK.\n\nThe manner in which Bear Admiral Plunkett and his men overcame all the difficulties of the complex assembly work did credit to the best Navy traditions. \"Seamen all, they worked till they dropped exhausted, and their night and long day hours of labor were continuous until the guns left for the front.\"\n\nExtract from Lieut. Commander Buell's letter to Capt. Kearney, dated August 28, 1918:\n\nWe have had no construction difficulties of any kind other than lack of material when we needed it. The ships were all loaded upside down, and we were not able to get started on the construction job until the last of the stuff on the second ship was unloaded and on the ground in the yard. From that time on we have made good speed * * *.\n\nIn the selection of men I was very fortunate. There has been only one thing in the whole project that we were not able to find a competent man to\n\n-- 31--\n\nhandle, and that was the job of putting the lagging on locomotive boilers. We borrowed a man from the Army and made out all right. I thought I was out of luck for a man to do lettering and stenciling of cars, but on combing the outfit I found three experienced lettering and sign painting men and had no further trouble on that score.\n\nSTART OF THE FIRST GUNS.\n\nExtract from Rear Admiral Plunkett’s letter to commander United States naval forces operating in European waters, dated August 27, 1918:\n\nBoth guns arrived at Helles-Mouchy ready for action, but upon arrival a change in the original plan for the guns was made by the chief of French reserve artillery, and I was requested to take one of the guns to Haussimont, the A. E. F. reserve artillery base (and the base to which the remaining guns will be sent in accordance with request from commanding general A. E. F.). The situation, then, is that we have one gun at Helles-Mouchy which can be used for operation in the original sector as contemplated by the French, and the other gun at Haussimont, which will conduct some trial firing at Mailly and then be available for service as may be requested by reserve artillery command. I shall proceed to St. Nazaire at the end of the week ending August 31 for the purpose of conducting the movement of the remaining guns, together with the supplies and material, to Haussimont.\n\nIt has been a matter of great satisfaction that we have fully demonstrated to the French authorities that these guns and mounts can be moved over the standard railway tracks and bridges at speeds which are safe and without damage to the right of way. I was always of the opinion that would be the case, but in some unaccountable manner, before my arrival in France, this question of the safe transportation of the guns, as mounted, over the French railroads had become a matter of official correspondence between our Army and the French military and railway authorities. As soon as I could locate all the threads of the matter I personally took the matter up with the French authorities, and, as a result, have succeeded in carrying out movement of two guns to a designated position 350 miles from St. Nazaire and have further transported one gun immediately from behind the allied line from Creil to Chateau-Thierry and along the Marne to Epernay and thence to reserve artillery base, A. E. F., Haussimont. It has been a most valuable experience for our personnel and has given us an opportunity to breath the atmosphere surrounding that part of the front where our own naval forces made their famous stand, and also to move over lines which were once destroyed and since rebuilt. In fact, as I write this report the movement of the train is held up pending the ceasing of enemy operations, either by gunfire or bombing, in the immediate vicinity of the train. All of this is of the greatest value in preparing young material for active work, and I shall endeavor to take the remaining guns over the same route as the first gun in order to give them the same opportunity of observation and experience.\n\nTHE GUNS WELCOMED BY THE PEOPLE.\n\nThis first trip in France was a memorable occasion, for many French cities, including Paris, were passed through, and the French people, on seeing that large American engines of war were actually\n\n--32--\n\nin France, were happy and encouraged. When passing many troop trains loaded with American soldiers cheer after cheer was given. On all occasions as soon as the gun was seen crowds gathered and went wild with excitement. Word of its coming was flashed ahead of the train, so that at many stations people had gathered in curiosity and many had come .with flowers and wreaths to decorate the big weapon. Many were surprised and agreeably startled when they found that the wreaths were too small for this gun and would not pass over the muzzle. Information concerning the guns spread over France, and undoubtedly reached the Germans, for when Battery No. 1 arrived at Helles-Mouchy at 8.30 p. m., August 23, and Battery No. 2 on Aug"
