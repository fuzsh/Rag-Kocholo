The first will be to seek unanimous consent for the motion to be presented and then to be adopted.\n\nIs there unanimous consent for the motion as presented by the government House leader?\n\nSome hon. members: Agreed.\n\nThe Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland): Is there unanimous consent to adopt the motion as presented by the government House leader?\n\nSome hon. members: Agreed.\n\nAn hon. member: No.\n\n* * *\n\nFISHERS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\nThe House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-302, an act to establish the rights of fishers including the right to be involved in the process of fisheries stock assessment, fish conservation, setting of fishing quotas, fishing licensing and the public right to fish and establish the right of fishers to be informed of decisions affecting fishing as a livelihood in advance and the right to compensation if other rights are abrogated unfairly, be now read a second time and referred to a committee.\n\nMr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.): Mr. Speaker, it really is a pleasure to rise and speak to Bill C-302. I commend the member for New Brunswick Southwest for bringing forth this bill. He is absolutely right in the fact that fishermen need more rights in this country. We only have to look at what government has done in the last 10 years on fisheries.\n\n1150\n\nWe have spent $4 billion on fishers. What has that got us? It has got us an east coast fishery that does not work, loads of unemployment and nothing positive in the future that we can see right now. What has it done on the west coast? It closed down coho salmon fishing last year.\n\nMoney does not solve the problem but consultation in the fishing industry would solve the problem. With this minister and ministers before him we have not had consultation with the fishermen, whether that has had to do with commercial fisheries or sports fisheries.\n\nMembers of the committee travelled all across Canada. If members of this House would read the report, east coast and west coast, they would see that the government has not consulted the fishermen in any part of the country. That is why a bill like this one is a very good bill. I would implore the backbenchers on the other side who have been speaking against this bill to read the reports written by members of the House, including the Liberal side, to see what the recommendations are. Those recommendations are in this bill. More consultation. Not just more money thrown at a problem. That will not solve the problem.\n\nThere are two examples of lack of consultation. The first is on the west coast in my own constituency. The minister wiped out coho fishing this year in British Columbia. This put a lot of people out of work. There was a great deal of sadness because we had a great run of coho but nobody was allowed to fish it.\n\nA hatchery in my constituency a couple of years ago put some coho in Porpoise Bay. The minister had to lift the embargo of fishing coho and allow people to fish in Porpoise Bay because there were so many coho. The coho were going to spawn and if there are too many of them they lay eggs one on top of the other and a disease starts which could cause a real problem. There was fishing in Porpoise Bay for coho. That was not good planning by the government. The fishermen told the government the year before that it could not put a ban in that area.\n\nFishermen were also told that they could not seed the open ocean because, and these are the words of DFO, there are already too many coho out there. DFO said not to put any out there. Then what did DFO do? It banned the fishing because it said that there were not enough. That is the department of fisheries without consultation with the fishermen. This bill gives fishermen rights to consultation.\n\nAnother story concerns herring roe on kelp. This was not a native fishery. This was a fishery started by a man and his family who live in Lund, British Columbia. They built it into a fishery where they were getting $40 a pound for herring roe on kelp in Japan. Over the years some of his employees left and started up their own herring roe on kelp business because they had learned the business and wanted their own business. Over the years it dropped down to about $30 a pound, but it was still a very lucrative business. Four companies were doing it and making good money at it.\n\nThis government came along and gave one of those four people $2 million to buy the licence back. What did the government do with that $2 million licence? It gave it to an aboriginal group in British Columbia. The government said, “It is not a natural fishery for an aboriginal group but it is a good business so let's get you into it”. Since then the government has given away in excess of a dozen more licences in this area of herring roe on kelp to aboriginal fishermen around the province.\n\nWhat has happened to the market in Japan? It went from $30 down to $20 down to $10 as the government kept on giving licences away for free.\n\nThe other three licence holders wanted to be bought out too. They said, “If you can buy out this other guy for $2 million, why won't you buy us out. There is not going to be any industry if you keep on passing out these licences for free to the different native bands around the province”. But the government said it did not have any money to buy them out.\n\nThe sad thing is this lack of planning, lack of consultation. The herring roe fishery is zero because the native bands are shipping it to Japan on consignment and the other people are going out of business. That is the lack of planning in this industry.\n\nIf we wonder why people get angry when DFO does not consult, how would any member of this House like to be one of those fishermen with the herring roe on kelp who are now having to compete against people who got their licence for free and can ship it to Japan on consignment? It is not right. It is not proper. We all should be voting for a bill like this one to allow the freedom and the consultation.\n\nAs I said, I commend the member for New Brunswick Southwest. His bill says that it endeavours to establish the rights of fishermen so that they are involved in the process of fishery stock assessment, fish conservation, the setting of fishing quotas, fishing licensing and the public right to fish. As well the bill would establish the rights of fishermen to be informed of the decisions affecting fishing as a livelihood in advance.\n\nThe example I just gave on the herring roe on kelp is a great example of why people should be advised in advance. These are people who put good money into their industry. They are not being advised.\n\n1155\n\nIt does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that fishermen have a problem in this country. What does the government do? It just throws money, $4 billion over the last 10 years. This has not solved one problem.\n\nWe need to move DFO out of Ottawa. Put a head office on the east coast for the east coast, and on the west coast for the west coast. We need to get these 1,200 bureaucrats out of the business. There is no fishing in the Rideau Canal. The fishing is on the east and west coasts. There are too many bureaucrats making too much money who have made wrong decisions. This is out of a report written unanimously by all sides of this House. It is being ignored by the minister of fisheries and it is being ignored at the peril of this country's fishermen. It is time for a change. We ask all members of the House to vote for this bill tomorrow.\n\nThe Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland): It being 11.55 a.m., the time provided for debate has expired. Pursuant to order made earlier this day, the question on the motion is deemed to have been put and a recorded division deemed demanded and deferred until Tuesday, February 2, 1999, at 5.15 p.m.\n\n* * *\n\nBUSINESS OF THE HOUSE\n\nHon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.): Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There have been further consultations. Hopefully without re-reading the motion into the record, perhaps you could ask the House if it would now agree to adopt the motion read into the record a few minutes ago.\n\nThe Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland): Is it the pleasure of the House to allow the government House leader to present the motion?\n\nSome hon. members: Agreed.\n\nThe Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland): Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion as put by the government House leader?\n\nSome hon. members: Agreed.\n\n(Motion agreed to)\n\nGOVERNMENT ORDERS\n\n[English]\n\nFINANCE\n\nHon. Jane Stewart (for the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons) moved:\n\nThat this House take note of the 11th report of the Standing Committee on Finance presented on Friday, December 4, 1998.\n\nMr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan—King—Aurora, Lib.): Mr. Speaker, for all of us in the House of Commons, politics and government are about one thing: people. They are about helping them build better lives for themselves and their families, about helping them make their dreams work, the dreams they have for themselves and for their children: a better quality of life, a higher standard of living, a fair shot at a good job that pays well, and a society that gives them the support they need when they need it.\n\nMaking these dreams a reality has been our overriding objective since the government first took office in 1993. That is how we won the confidence of Canadians. The progress the government made in its first mandate earned it a renewed majority mandate in 1997. It is that focus on what matters most to Canadians that is how this government aims to keep the confidence and trust in the future.\n\nA strong economy is the key to building a more secure society. For proof, all we need to do is remember the Canada of five years ago. The government faced a $42 billion deficit, the largest in Canadian history and it was growing. Unemployment was at 11.4%. High inflation and high interest rates were dragging down the economy in a big way. The debt to GDP ratio had been rising steadily for almost two decades. Taxes seemed to know only one direction: up.\n\n1200\n\nSerious questions were being raised about our ability as a nation to maintain our cherished social safety net. Worst of all, we had lost our characteristic confidence in ourselves as a people and in our future.\n\nIn the past five years the government has shown what happens when we roll up our sleeves and get down to work. When we listen to Canadians as we did during our prebudget consultation hearings and when we work side by side with them, when we trust their courage and their willingness to make sacrifices, and when we reflect on values and priorities, what happens? Positive change occurs.\n\nFive years ago the Wall Street Journal compared Canada's economy to that of a third world economy. Recently the Financial Times of London referred to Canada as the top dog of the G-7. The $42 billion deficit is now a $3.5 billion surplus. The debt to GDP ratio is on a firm and permanent downward track. In fact the Government of Canada has not borrowed new money on the markets for more than two and a half years.\n\nPersonal taxes in the last two budgets have been cut. They were cut by $7 billion in the last budget alone. Our inflation rate is at its lowest level since the 1960s. Our interest rates are also at the lowest levels in three decades.\n\nCanada has enjoyed the strongest economic growth of the G-7. Even with the recent global turmoil, the International Monetary Fund recently forecasted that Canada would be among the G-7 leaders for economic growth in 1999.\n\nUnemployment in Canada has fallen by almost 3.5 percentage points since we took office to its lowest level in nearly a decade. Last year our job growth was number one in the G-7.\n\nBest of all, there has been a resurgence of optimism among Canadians and a renewal of confidence among Canadians that government can in fact make a practical difference for the better in their lives. This was evident during the prebudget consultation hearings held across the country.\n\nA secure society is one in which people can count on their fellow citizens for help and support when they need it. If they lose their job, if they need income support in retirement, to give their kids the good start they need in life or when they are sick, compassion and sharing are deeply held Canadian values. They are reflected in some of our proudest national achievements: insurance for the unemployed, the Canada pension plan, supporting children in need and our universal medicare system.\n\nSafeguarding these pillars of our society was a primary motivating factor behind the fight against the deficit and impressive work has been done to protect and modernize them.\n\nTo meet the needs of our new labour market, the government redesigned and refocused assistance to the unemployed, creating an employment insurance system aimed at helping people get back to work as soon as possible.\n\n1205\n\nIn co-operation with the provinces the federal government established a new child benefit to help low income families with children. By July 1, 2000 the federal government will be investing $1.7 billion in this initiative.\n\nWorking with the provinces, it also achieved an historic package of reforms that will guarantee the Canada pension plan remains on sound financial footing, even in the face of an aging population, increasing longevity and retiring baby boomers. The CPP will be there for future retirees. They can count of it. Securing our public pension system is something no other industrialized country has been able to do. Moreover, the success in saving the CPP combined with a balanced budget and a stronger economy have allowed the government to reaffirm its commitment to old age security and guaranteed income supplement programs.\n\nCanadians have told us that access to quality health care is among their most urgent concerns. The government has listened. Since it was first elected in 1993 protecting our universal medicare system has been a top priority. As soon as the fight against the deficit gave the government financial room it followed the recommendations of the National Forum on Health. It increased the cash floor of the Canada health and social transfer from $11 billion to $12.5 billion. That means close to $7 billion beyond previously budgeted levels, over six years, will go to the provinces to fund health care, post-secondary education and social assistance.\n\nAdditional funding will permit the enforcement of the five principles of the Canada Health Act: universality, accessibility, comprehensiveness, portability and public administration.\n\nThe government has shown its openness to modernizing the health care system. In its first mandate the Prime Minister chaired the National Forum on Health which brought together Canada's wealth of talent and knowledge in the health care field to assess how the system could best respond to emerging health care issues.\n\nThe 1997 budget allocated over three years to implement key recommendations of the national forum: $150 million for the health transition fund to help provinces launch pilot projects to investigate new and better approaches to health care, including home care; $50 million to establish a new Canada health information system to give health care providers timely access to quality health information; and $100 million to boost funding for the community action program for children and the Canada prenatal nutrition program.\n\nDuring our prebudget consultations Canadians from coast to coast stressed the importance of health care in their lives. They said that the government should continue with its strong commitment to health care. We believe that health care is a priority. In the upcoming budget we will strongly endorse measures to strengthen the health care system in Canada.\n\nMaintaining a strong economy and a secure society in the new global, knowledge based economy requires that we invest within our means and in carefully targeted ways so that Canadians have the knowledge, the skills and the opportunities they need to prosper.\n\nOne of the key reasons the government fought so hard against the deficit was to regain our ability as a nation to make such strategic investments in our people. For example, the millennium scholarship fund will generate over 100,000 scholarships each year for low and middle income post-secondary students over the next decade.\n\n1210\n\nThe Canada education savings plan is another example. Our government is topping up new contributions to registered education savings plans, which are an enormous hit with parents saving for their children's future education.\n\nAnother example is the Canada foundation for innovation, whose $800 million endowment is being used to fund cutting edge research facilities in our universities and teaching hospitals.\n\nThere is the connecting Canadians strategy, the goal of which is to make Canada the most connected country in the world by the year 2000, with our own fast lane on the information highway. A key part of that strategy has been SchoolNet, which will mean that every one of our more than 16,000 public schools and libraries will be connected to the Internet by the end of the fiscal year. We will be the first major nation in the world to do this: ahead of the Americans, ahead of the British, ahead of the French.\n\nThen there is the youth employment strategy which consolidated approximately $2 billion in new and existing funding for the programs and services that young people need to acquire skills and work experience, find jobs and build careers.\n\nThe measures that we are taking are important because we compete in a global marketplace. I am quite happy to see that as a nation we are getting ready for the challenges ahead. However, let us be clear: we are building on a solid foundation.\n\nCanada is number one of the G-7 in home computer, cable and telephone penetration. We have the lowest telephone rates of the G-7, the lowest Internet access cost of the G-7, the lowest cost of doing information technology business of the G-7, the lowest software production cost in North America and we are ranked number one in producing knowledgeable workers.\n\nInvesting in R and D and the skills of our people, expanding educational opportunities, cutting taxes, investing in health care and reducing the public debt make perfect sense if we want to improve the standard of living of Canadians.\n\nThere is no question in my mind that Canadians want their political and business leaders to focus on improving their standard of living. They are quite tired of the turf wars that exist between levels of government. They are quite tired of the politics of finger pointing. They are not interested in that any more. They want results from their elected officials. They want results from their corporate leaders. They want a brighter future for their children. That is the focus which was quite clear when we travelled across the country listening to students and listening to people involved in R and D. We listened to our educators. In every city people told us that the standard of living is the issue on which we, as a society, must be focused.\n\nLet us put an end to the era of confrontation. Let us build an era of co-operation, one in which people's standard of living and quality of life are key issues. This is not simply a debate that needs to be had in the halls of the House of Commons. It has to happen in the communities and in corporate board rooms because we all have a responsibility to improve the standard of living for Canadians.\n\n1215\n\nOne thing that is certain is that although in the past two years Canada has seen an improvement in its productivity, it has, like every other G-7 country, seen a decline in productivity. We need to improve that because productivity essentially means a better standard of living for Canadians. What can we as a government do? What is our role to enhance productivity?\n\nI want to make sure people understand that it is in the context of increasing the standard of living for Canadians that the recommendations were made in the finance committee. Before we talk about the recommendations we made as a committee let us look at what the government has done to increase productivity in Canada. What kind of measures or channels has it used to make sure the productivity gains seen in the past two years continue?\n\nWhen looking at the government policies that promote a higher standard of living, they can be broken down into fiscal and monetary policy, tax policy, support for education and skill development, support for R and D, social and labour market policies, trade policies and policy that understands there is a role for the marketplace.\n\nWhen looking at fiscal and monetary policy and clearly understand that a stable macro economic environment with low inflation and lower interest rates can boost confidence in the economy, enhance productivity growth and boost employment, what has the government been able to achieve? There are a number of accomplishments we should take note of.\n\nThe federal deficit has been eliminated. The debt to GDP ratio is in a clear downward path. There has been substantial fiscal progress at both federal and provincial government levels, and we have the low inflation records of the 1990s. That is pretty clear, low interest rates, reducing the debt, reducing the burden on Canadians. What happens when we do that? We increase productivity and increase employment opportunities for Canadians and that is essentially what we heard throughout the country.\n\nWhat did the finance committee have to say about that? We found a great deal of satisfaction on the part of Canadians when it came to these issues. When it comes to fiscal and monetary policy the finance committee recommended that the Government of Canada continue to use prudent economic assumption in the formulation of budgets, that assumptions about short term and long term interests continue to be set at 50 to 100 basis points higher than the private sector average, and that the minister alter the prudence factor as circumstances warrant.\n\nThe committee recommended that the federal government continue to employ a contingency reserve which has set aside $3 billion per year. At present the contingency reserve should not be used on increased program spending or tax cuts. The committee also recommended that the government continue to use two year planning horizons for the conduct of fiscal policy.\n\n1220\n\nWe recommended that the federal government establish a long term target for a sustainable debt to GDP ratio. We said that an interim debt to GDP target range of 50% to 60% should be achieved in this mandate.\n\nFiscal and monetary policy is one issue but what are the other contributors in achieving a higher standard of living? If we look at tax policy, taxes can affect the allocation of resources and alter the incentives to work, to save and to invest.\n\nWhat has this government done, what are its accomplishments? We have seen the beginning of general tax relief, the national child benefit system to support working parents and the HST to reduce compliance costs. These are three of the measures.\n\nWhile the world, in particular the group of seven countries, is spending a lot of time devising strategies for productivity, in a measured way this government is putting in place the types of policies that speak to the worldwide debate on productivity. In the past three years we have seen an increase in productivity, which I hope is a trend.\n\nDoes the finance committee feel the federal government should continue to cut taxes? Absolutely. We have made a number of recommendations in relation to taxes. Last year we called for the elimination of the 3% surtax. This year we call again for the elimination of the 3% surtax for all Canadians. We call for the announcement of a timetable for the elimination of the 5% surtax. We do that because these taxes were introduced as deficit fighting mechanisms. Now that the deficit is gone it is time for the minister to announce a timetable for further tax reduction.\n\nAs we did last year, we recommend that the 1998 budget measures to increase the basic personal amount and spousal amount by $500 for lower income taxpayers be increased by a further $200. That would bring to $700 the amount of additional income that can be earned tax free. The committee further recommends that this $700 increase in the basic personal and spousal amounts be available to all Canadian taxpayers.\n\nI will discuss what the government has done to enhance productivity. We must make sure the people who work in our companies have the proper skill sets and education to do things better and quicker, that they can produce more, enhance and generate wealth for our companies and in aggregate for the country. Support for education and skills development gets more people into the workforce by boosting the employment rate. It helps people get higher wage jobs and achieve greater productivity.\n\n1225\n\nIs this not essentially the type of society we want to build? Is the reason an industrially advanced country like Canada entered free trade agreements not because we wanted to compete and generate high paying jobs that require highly skilled workers? That is where our competitive advantage is.\n\nLooking at education and skills development, what has this government done? There are the Canadian opportunity strategy, Canadian millennium scholarships, Canada study grants and tax relief on interest on student loans, the Canada education savings grant, the increased education and tuition tax credits, SchoolNet to give young students Internet access, increased funding for youth at risk who lack basic education and job skills.\n\nThis is what it takes to build a country. We need to invest in people. We need to create the economic environment where we as a nation and as a people can generate wealth.\n\nAnother key component of a productivity strategy must be researched and developed because it provides the innovation needed to improve production processes, thereby boosting productivity.\n\nThe government has moved on several fronts with the Canada foundation for innovation, technology partnership Canada, tax support for R and D, and networks of centres of excellence.\n\nWe need labour market policies that work so Canadians can work. They influence work incentives and facilitate workforce participation by removing barriers.\n\nI remember this debate quite clearly when I was parliamentary secretary to the minister of human resources. I remember how we needed to modernize and restructure Canada's social security system so that it would serve our people well.\n\nAs a 1990s car cannot be fixed with a 1960s repair manual, the same thing is true of our social security system. We need to modernize it. I think EI reform did that.\n\nProductivity is also impacted by our trade policy. What does trade policy do? It increases competition and allows countries to specialize in products they are good at making. There again the end result is a boost in productivity and competitiveness.\n\nWhat has this government done in the area of trade policy? We have NAFTA. We are a leading player in the WTO. There are ongoing efforts to ensure the free flow of goods and services within Canada. These are characteristics of a government and a nation that are forward looking, that understand that the route to a higher standard of living is higher productivity.\n\nAnother very important component of productivity strategy is letting the market work. Regulation and subsidies can dampen market signals and distort the allocation of resources, inhibiting growth and inhibiting essentially productivity growth. Privatization can enhance and boost productivity.\n\n1230\n\nThere is a difference between individuals who talk about these things and governments that do. When we look at the government's record on the important component of increasing the standard of living for Canadians, we see that the government reduced business and transportation subsidies. We have had partial or full privatization of Air Canada, Petro-Canada, Canadair, De Havilland Canada and CN.\n\nIt is clear to me that the agenda of the government is working quite well. I heard this throughout the country. It is an agenda that looks to the future with a great deal of optimism. We have eliminated the deficit. We have lowered taxes. We have made key investments in education, research and development.\n\nI am proud to be a Canadian. I am proud to be a member of the House of Commons. It is due to the recommendations of members of parliament that we have been able to build a society and an economy that work. Our next frontier is to work toward a higher standard of living, to secure that our children and our children's children will live in a better country than we live in.\n\nMr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.): Madam Speaker, it gives me pleasure to enter into the debate on the report of the Standing Committee on Finance. My purpose will be twofold. I would like to make some comments on the report of the committee and then I would like to serve the broader purpose of offering some advice from the official opposition to the finance minister and the government prior to the finalization of the federal budget.\n\nThe official opposition has also consulted with Canadians with respect to their expectations in terms of federal finances. While we appreciate the consultations that have been conducted by the committee, we think that from our own consultations Canadians are much more specific on the expectations they have in mind.\n\nIn particular, Canadians are telling us and anyone who will listen that it is what the federal government is doing to our taxes and our health care that concerns us most. They expect the budgetary policy of the government in the next number of months to focus specifically on addressing their concerns in that area.\n\nIt is our view that the report of the committee and the statements to date by the government are not sufficiently focused on these priorities. Therefore, my colleague, the member of parliament for Medicine Hat, the official opposition finance critic, and a number of his colleagues have produced their own prebudget submission entitled “Taxes and Health Care: It's Critical”. That is being released today. I thank all those responsible for its development and commend it to the committee, to the House, to the finance minister and to the government.\n\nThe report has three emphases. First, it proposes a real, substantial tax relief package. For example, under that package a single income family of four earning $30,000 would receive an annual pay hike of over $4,000, not the pathetic $143 offered by the government.\n\nSecond, on the health side it not only proposes an additional $2 billion per year of reinvestment in health care but complementary measures to start putting the patient first in the rebuilding of the crumbling health care system.\n\nThird, on the debt side it proposes a comprehensive debt repayment schedule designed to reduce the national debt by $19 billion over the next three years.\n\n1235\n\nI turn to the report of the Standing Committee on Finance entitled Challenges and Choices. I do not want to begin by slamming the report or by dismissing its recommendations or analyses out of hand. Like many of us I think there is too much of that in the House.\n\nIt is not our intention to slam every effort or proposal that comes from the government simply because it comes from the government. I think the government tends to do that a bit: if it comes from the official opposition, particularly if it comes from Reform, it is automatically banned. Those attitudes on either side of the House cannot encourage debate. They do not earn the respect of the public and they are not very productive. We do not want to fall into the same trap.\n\nWith respect to the report we commend the committee for its extensive consultations. I commend the committee on the first chapter of the report which provides a summary of where we are financially and in relation to the economy and the performance of the government financially.\n\nI commend the committee for devoting at least two of its eight chapters to the priority areas of health care and taxes. I also commend the committee for adopting some of the proposals of the official opposition, in particular the proposals for eliminating the 3% surtax, eventually the 5% surtax, and reductions in personal income tax.\n\nWhen we think that three years ago the subject of tax relief was not in the government's vocabulary, we have to take some satisfaction in the House that the government is at least talking about it. We are encouraged by these signs of progress.\n\nHaving said that, I would like to point out two major deficiencies in the report. The first is that the report devotes an entire chapter to a prudent budget making process, chapter 3, and then omits the most important step in prudent budgeting.\n\nPrudent budgeting begins with accurate, transparent, principled accounting and reporting of the government's financial position. Concrete measures are required to prevent the finance minister from playing a shell game with public finances and giving the appearance, rightly or wrongly, of cooking the books.\n\nThe shell game on taxes, for example, is that the government is taking $40 billion more per year in taxes than it was in 1995. It gives $2 billion to $3 billion per year back to the taxpayers and calls this token tax reduction tax relief and hopes the public does not notice the difference between what was given and what was taken. This type of rhetoric, this type of approach to presenting tax reduction fools no one. It increases public skepticism about anything said regarding tax reduction at the federal level.\n\nThe government also plays a shell game on spending, something that even the auditor general has commented on and gone further than commenting on: he will not sign off on the financial statements because of this shell game.\n\nIn the old days when the federal government was running a deficit it practised what is called back end loading. It tried to push costs, if there was any accounting way of justifying it, on to the next year to make the deficit look smaller.\n\nNow that we are into the era of surpluses the government is practising front end loading. It is trying to pull as many costs as it can into the current fiscal year to make the surplus look smaller so that it is under less pressure to reduce taxes.\n\nI pointed out on numerous occasions that if this was done in the private sector and the finance minister was the vice-president of finance of an oil company, he would end up making licence plates in some provincial penitentiary for practising that game.\n\nThe shell game is also played particularly with respect to the surplus. Everything is done now to try to make the surplus look smaller so as to reduce the pressure for tax relief. This includes spin doctoring of the projected surplus.\n\nWe find the initial projection of the surplus by the government was $10 billion to $13 billion. A series of press releases came out, particularly over the last couple of weeks, indicating why those initial projections were out of line and that probably it would be less and less and less. The purpose is to make this surplus appear smaller and, I am certain, to minimize public pressure for tax relief.\n\nThe official opposition therefore recommends that if the government wants to practise prudent budgeting Canada should follow the example of New Zealand and pass a financial responsibility act that creates a legal requirement for the government to produce financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, specifies what those principles are in the legislation, and holds officials legally liable for violating those rules.\n\n1240\n\nThere is a second deficiency in the report which should be emphasized. It centres around the report's recommendation that the federal government enter into a productivity covenant with Canadians.\n\nThe word covenant is a religious term. I do not know whether the intention was to deify the government or to imply that the Minister of Finance would go up the mountain and return with two tablets of stone prior to the budget. If he does that, I hope the tablets will have something in bold print about thou shalt not steal and thou shalt not bear false witness. However that is not my main point.\n\nThe definition and elaboration of productivity in the report strikes me as curious. I spent 20 years in the private sector as a management consultant working with companies for whom productivity was a real term which was measured. They even developed computer models in the company to try to measure the development of productivity.\n\nIn this report the vague definition is used that productivity simply means getting better results with the same effort. It looks like it was written by a Liberal spin doctor, not by somebody responsible for productivity.\n\nThe definition of productivity that is used in the real world, in business, in unions and in the marketplace where people have to produce, where this means something and where they will be measured against it, is a ratio. Productivity is a ratio of the value of production over the cost of doing business. The cost of doing business is the denominator in that fraction. It includes taxes imposed by the government. Anything that increases the cost of doing business without increasing the value of production decreases productivity. It hurts productivity.\n\nIf the government wants to talk seriously about productivity and the productivity covenant with Canadians who are not stupid—there are thousands of people in my constituency who can define productivity better than in this report—it needs a clear definition of productivity that makes crystal clear the negative impacts of Liberal overtaxation on the competitiveness and the profitability of Canadian business and employment. I urge the committee to address that point. It fits in with public understanding of what the government is doing to our taxes.\n\nI now turn to a bigger and broader framework than is contained in this report for analysing the government's financial position of what should be in the budget. When Reformers came to Ottawa in 1993 we had a four point list for fixing federal finances that is as relevant today as it was when we first came here: control and prioritise the spending, balance the budget, reduce the taxes and reduce the debt. It is pretty simple.\n\nFive and a half years later under this administration only one of those matters has been dealt with. The budget is now balanced, but that was done not by controlled spending but mainly through revenue increases and offloading to the provinces. There still remains much to be done on the simplest fiscal agenda that is possible to get Canada's fiscal house in order. That is the thrust of our prebudget submission and our advice.\n\nLet me take these categories one by one. With respect to controlling the spending, the federal government is still not doing it. In the 1997 budget plan the finance minister projected that government program spending last year would come in at $105.8 billion. He called his assumptions prudent, taking into account normal demographic and inflation changes. The problem is that when the final numbers came in, program spending for 1997-98 was $108.8 billion or a $3 billion spending hike. All the talk about spending control, all the talk about balancing the budget through cost reduction, and the first year into a surplus position spending escalated $3 billion over the estimate.\n\nThis year it is déjà vu all over again. In the same 1997 budget plan the finance minister projected program spending for this year at $103.5 billion. By the time his 1998 budget came out he had upped those spending predictions to $104.5 billion. Now, according to the most recent financial information, program spending is slated to rise even further, by 3.1% so far this year.\n\n1245\n\nThis means that if the finance minister follows last year's pattern and continues this year's already documented schedule of overspending, his spending is going to come in around $107.5 billion or another $3 billion over what he told this House it was going to be. That is spending control. What it reflects is a Liberal predisposition to spend and the need for even stronger spending controls.\n\nWhat the official opposition recommends is really three things. First, to freeze program spending for three years at $104.5 billion to generate the surpluses necessary for real tax relief and debt reduction. That is not an unreasonable figure. It is the figure that the finance minister himself said was adequate for last year.\n\nThis does not mean that we cannot increase spending in priority areas. But during the three year freeze it means that can only be done by reducing spending in other areas. In other words, it forces the government to do what every household in the country has to do when there is not quite enough money and that is to prioritize. Why should we not do what millions and millions of Canadians in households and businesses are forced to do every year and every month?\n\nThe official opposition therefore recommends increases in both health and defence spending, but primarily from reductions in handouts to business, interest groups and government to government foreign aid. We propose increases in spending, but we would get the money by reducing spending somewhere else rather than adding to the deficit or adding to taxes.\n\nOther members and the government may disagree with our spending controls and our spending priorities. That is fine. That is what we are here to debate. But if they disagree, then it is incumbent upon the government to set out its own spending controls and priorities which will still have the effect of generating the surpluses we need for tax reduction, debt reduction and health care reinvestment.\n\nLet me turn to debt reduction. Again the federal government just is not doing it. We have a $580 billion federal debt. All we see is token debt reduction. Under this government Canada continues to spend almost 30 cents out of every revenue dollar on interest on the debt. That is a burden on the capacity to finance social services. We bleed ourselves white paying out over $40 billion a year and then we wonder why there is not enough money for transfers to the provinces.\n\nIt is a drag on productivity. The government says it is concerned about productivity. The greatest thing it could do about productivity is to get the debt burden down. If we work out its own calculation on its productivity, that $43 billion a year on debt service knocks the ratio out the window.\n\nLincoln once said that excessive debts were like rats gnawing at the vital organs and sinews of the state. I cannot for the life of me understand how the finance minister can sleep at night with $580 billion rats gnawing at the vitals of the Government of Canada. I use rats of course in a general sense, you understand, Mr. Speaker; not attributing it to any personality.\n\nWhat the official opposition recommends is not rocket science. The problem here is not figuring out what to do; the problem here is to get doing it. We recommend, first, that a debt retirement sinking fund be established; second, that a law be passed to direct a portion of the debt to be retired each year; and third, that a schedule be established to reduce the debt. We recommend that the debt be reduced by $19 billion over the next three years and by $240 billion over the next 20 years. Let us get serious about debt reduction and the mortgaging of the future of the next generation.\n\n1250\n\nI want to talk about real tax relief, and I will draw a distinction between token tax relief and real tax relief. I will draw a distinction between the shell game, where the finance minister pushes a shell that says a $2 billion reduction, a $3 billion reduction and tries to pull to the back of the table the fact that the government is taking $38 billion to $40 billion a year more than when it came here in 1993. I am not talking about the shell game. I am talking about real, genuine tax reduction that can be felt in the pockets of consumers and can be seen on the financial statements of businesses.\n\nLet us consider the taxation record under the government.\n\nPersonal income taxes are up almost 38% and now account for 8.2% of GDP, up from 7% in 1993, for a 17% increase. Is it any wonder Canadians are struggling to get by? I have asked public audiences all over this country “Government income has gone up 35% to 40% since 1993. How many of you can say that your personal income or your family income has gone up 38% during that same period?” Not very many hands go up. There is a rumble through that audience that the government ought to take into account.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada taxes paid by the average Canadian household were 15% higher in 1996 than in 1992. Canadians pay 46 cents on every dollar earned toward taxes, while Americans, our greatest single competitor and the American labour market being the great drawing card to many of our young people right now, pay only 33 cents. In other words, as a percentage Canadian taxation represents 140% of the U.S. tax rate.\n\nGovernment members cannot get out of this argument by saying “Oh, but we spend so much on health care”. The Americans spend much more than we do on defence. They wash each other out. It is not that simple. Our rates are simply higher, consistently higher, than those of our principal trading partner.\n\nTo put it another way, our personal income tax burden has gone up 136% in the past three decades compared with only 31% in the United States.\n\nThe federal government collects $11.2 billion from 7.7 million Canadians who earn $30,000 a year or less. We hear these great protestations of social concern from the government and the finance minister. He wrings his hands in public about child poverty and he wrings $11 billion a year out of families, with children, which make $30,000 a year or less. He sits in the House devising all kinds of programs to try to deliver some help to those families when the best help he could give them from a poverty standpoint would be to simply leave more dollars in their pockets.\n\nBracket creep is another area where the shell game is played. The minister stood in the House and told us how many people he would take off the tax rolls. That is the shell that is pushed to the front. What government members do not show us is the other shell which they pull to the back, the people who are being pulled onto the tax rolls through bracket creep. They outnumber by far the ones who have been taken off. More than a million low wage workers have been pulled onto the income tax net since the government took office. More than 1.9 million taxpayers were pushed from the bottom to the middle tax bracket and 600,000 taxpayers were pushed from the middle to the top bracket. That is the government's record on taxation. There is no tax relief. There is a consistent record of increased government revenues connected to increasing taxation.\n\nIn place of this token tax relief proposed by the government the official opposition proposes real, substantial, broad based tax relief. The proposals contained in the paper “Taxes and Health Care” include a reduction of $26 billion in federal taxes over the next three years, starting with a $7 billion reduction in employment insurance taxes, payroll taxes that kill jobs, and a $19 billion reduction in personal income taxes and capital gains taxes. If members work out the impact of these numbers on the take-home pay of a single income family of four making $30,000 a year, the family gets an annual pay hike of $4,628 under these tax relief reforms.\n\nIn case this is too complex for some of our colleagues, it is the intention of the official opposition to go across this country showing people what their take-home pay is under the Liberal tax regime, including the token tax relief measures contained in the budget, and what their take-home pay would be under these tax reforms. I do not think there is going to be much doubt as to which paycheque the public would prefer.\n\n1255\n\nThe finance minister plays the shell game and tells the government caucus that if it gives substantial, broad based tax relief the country will be back in a deficit position. Some hon. members actually believe that argument. That is simply not the case if one puts in place the other measures required to maintain the balance, such as the spending controls and the spending priorities referred to, the debt reduction measure that would reduce the interest on the debt, and tax relief that is substantial enough to stimulate economic growth.\n\nIf the government truly wants to enter into a productivity covenant with the Canadian people, let it be based on this proposition: that at Canada's levels of debt and Canada's levels of taxation, a dollar left in the pocket of a Canadian taxpayer, consumer or employer is more productive than that dollar in the hands of a federal politician or bureaucrat. That is a statement on productivity. It lies within the power of this parliament to increase the take-home pay of millions of individuals and families this year simply by substantially reducing the demands of the federal taxman. It lies within the power of this parliament to free up billions of dollars for future investment in health care and essential services by paying down federal debt now.\n\nI therefore conclude by asking, by imploring, the Prime Minister, the finance minister and the 156 members opposite not to stand in the way of such noble objectives.\n\n[Translation]\n\nMr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ): Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on the report of the Liberal majority on the Standing Committee on Finance, which was tabled last December and suggests certain approaches with respect to the next budget.\n\nThe Liberal majority's report is a blatant piece of propaganda. It could have been—and was, I believe—written by the office of the Minister of Finance, so completely is it at odds with the comments we heard from individuals and from business and anti-poverty organizations in our travels across Canada.\n\nWhat is more, the report touts the marvellous achievements of the Liberal government. This is a change from the reports produced by the Standing Committee on Finance over the last five years. They were mildly propagandist but this one is nothing but.\n\nThe report glosses over the nasty tricks and lack of consensus on such issues as the millennium scholarships. Nor does it make any mention of the fact that Quebec's opposition to this new Liberal government policy, this new intrusion into the education sector, is unanimous.\n\nThe report also refers to issues that never came up during this consultation, such as the famous productivity covenant. I do not know where this came from. Again, the likeliest source is the office of the Minister of Finance, who has the chair of the Standing Committee on Finance to do his bidding. This is the first time the committee chair has been nothing more than a puppet controlled by the Minister of Finance.\n\nI was also appalled at the arrogance of this report on such issues as employment insurance.\n\n1300\n\nI will quote the report of the Liberal majority, at page 55. Members are aware of the many problems with employment insurance, the increasingly limited access to it and the fact that fewer than 40% of the people contributing to it can now draw benefits. These benefits have shrunk in the past two years, since the employment insurance reform.\n\nSo what do we find on page 55 of the Liberal majority report? This is what we find, and I quote “The committee thinks that the phenomenon is misunderstood. The unemployed receive nothing because the system was not designed for them”.\n\nNever have I seen or read such arrogant remarks in a Liberal majority report. So, even though statistics come out every week telling us what a total fiasco the employment insurance plan is, how it does not serve the interests of the unemployed in Quebec and Canada, the Liberals say the Quebeckers and Canadians who appeared before the Standing Committee on Finance do not understand the plan when it is the plan that makes no sense at all.\n\nAnother arrogant remark in the Liberal majority's report is when they say that the Canadians consulted want the Minister of Finance to continue his very prudent management of public funds.\n\nThe comments gathered across Canada are not self evident. On the subject of prudence, they do ask the Minister of Finance to be prudent too, but next above all, what Canadians across the country asked the Minister of Finance to do was to stop making up all sorts of stories, to stop saying things that do not make sense.\n\nFor example, as regards the surpluses, the minister was told to stop viewing Quebeckers and Canadians as gullible and to stop being off the mark by close to 100% in his forecasts. This cannot go on.\n\nDuring that consultation, Canadians and Quebeckers asked the Minister of Finance to show greater transparency and honesty. Such comments were made by organizations from various sectors across the country. Honesty yes, but also accuracy, which is the very foundation of democracy and the basis of effective processes, such as the prebudget consultation process.\n\nIf the prebudget consultation is conducted while relying on falsehoods and lies, how can we expect the citizens of this country to have a clear mind and to propose sensible ideas based on the real figures?\n\nHow can we be expected, as lawmakers, to have a solid and credible basis to urge the government to make decisions, if the Minister of Finance is always fibbing about the state of public finances? He stated recently that the surplus—based on his own document, that is the last budget—would be somewhere between zero and three billion dollars, when in fact it will be in excess of six billion dollars.\n\nThe content of the Liberal majority report confirmed that we were right, last year, to have decided to conduct our own prebudget consultation. During the months of August and September, the Bloc Quebecois—led by its leader, the hon. member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie and myself as its finance critic—toured Quebec to hear the comments, ideas and suggestions of the people of Quebec regarding the content of the upcoming budget and the use that should be made of the huge surpluses collected by the Minister of Finance, primarily to score political points. We did our job.\n\nWhat we heard is very different from what is found in the report of the Liberal majority. We look at the real issues. The people whom we consulted told us about the real issues. They said they had had enough of being told just any old thing by this government, of being told to continue to behave, to continue to make sacrifices, when the result of the sacrifices—far from seeing the benefits of these sacrifices, if we can believe the recent remarks by the Minister of Finance, they are not likely to see the benefits in the upcoming budget either—these people see the money saved on the backs of the most disadvantaged and the middle income earners reallocated to the most favoured classes. This is not normal.\n\nQuebeckers and Canadians told us three things during these consultations. First, they said their first priority for federal transfers was to fund higher education, social assistance and most importantly health care.\n\n1305\n\nThey discussed the Saskatoon agreement. Remember that the agreement signed by all the premiers in Saskatoon provided two things, essentially: that the federal government stop cutting some $6 billion year in and year out in transfers to the provinces, and Quebec in particular, for health care, post-secondary education and social assistance, as it had set out in its 1995 budget.\n\nThey also called for the right to opt out with full compensation in areas of provincial jurisdiction. They asked that, if the federal government wanted another initiative there, provinces wanting to withdraw from a federal program in a provincial jurisdiction be able to do so with full compensation.\n\nI think it is in the public interest to know what the Minister of Finance decreed in his 1995 budget. He decreed it once, but nobody mentions it anymore and nobody will mention it until 2003. We are making a point of putting it back on the table.\n\nIn 1995, the Minister of Finance decided that announcements of cuts to social programs, health care and education year after year were really unpopular. So, he said, “I will do it once, and it will be valid until 2003”. That is the plan for systematic cuts the Minister of Finance, the pretender to the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada, set in motion in 1995.\n\nUnder that plan, every year, without any warning, provincial governments have to put up with an average shortfall of $6 billion in the areas of health, higher education and social assistance.\n\nBased on the federal decision announced in the 1995 budget of the Minister of Finance, it was initially anticipated that, by the year 2003, federal transfers to the provinces for health, higher education and social assistance would be subject to cumulative cuts totalling $48 billion. During the 1997 election campaign, that position became so untenable—and the Bloc Quebecois contributed to this by constantly attacking the Liberal Party on this issue—that the Prime Minister of Canada announced with great fanfare that he would put back six billion dollars into social programs.\n\nWhat he really meant was that, of the $48 billion that he had originally planned to cut between 1995 and 2003, $6 billion would not be cut. This meant that there would still be cuts totalling $42 billion, with annual cuts of $6 billion in transfers for health, for instance. These cuts have not been eliminated.\n\nThe premiers made it clear when they met in Saskatoon, that these are the cuts they want the federal government to eliminate. The government talks about giving back $6.3 billion to the provinces to finance their social and health programs, but what the provinces want is for the federal government to cancel the cuts mentioned in the 1995 budget until the year 2003. In their wisdom, the provinces told the federal government they were prepared to accept an arrangement, whereby the $6.3 billion they are requesting to offset the cuts in health, higher education and social assistance could be paid over two years.\n\nThe discussions were not about $1 billion but rather $6.3 billion. Since then, however, the federal government has gone to great lengths to allege that this $1 billion is a big deal, that it was the amount discussed in the negotiations, and that the government has a role to play in exclusive provincial jurisdictions like health. The Minister of Finance himself, in establishing the Canada health and social transfer, which combines all three federal transfers into one, stated its purpose was to give the provinces greater freedom to use their funds as they see fit.\n\nThe outcome of the negotiations concerning the social transfer and the provinces' demands on the basis of Saskatoon tell a completely different story. The federal government is intent on having a say in every decision on how funds are allocated, in spite of the fact that these funds belong to the provinces and that it could choose to give them back to the provinces for health, higher education and social assistance.\n\nI think that, with respect to this budget, the Minister of Finance should immediately initiate a process leading to full compensation for all cuts made since 1995, thereby cancelling the cuts in health, higher education and social assistance.\n\nPeople must understand that the problems currently experienced in emergency rooms must not be blamed on their provincial government, on the Quebec government, but on the federal government, which has left the provinces broke with funding cuts averaging $7.3 billion a year.\n\n1310\n\nNor are we interested in their bleating about the misfortune of the disadvantaged and the ill, as the Minister of Human Resources Development has done, when it is the Liberals that are behind the cuts and that will be maintaining them until 2003.\n\nThe people of Quebec told us about another priority they had, a real priority, as opposed to the crass propaganda in the Liberal majority's report.\n\nWhen we consulted people throughout Quebec, which we did with the assistance of all Bloc Quebecois members, they told us that their other priority was a substantial cut in personal income taxes. Not in the taxes of the rich, of millionaires, or ministers, but of low-and middle-income taxpayers. These are the folks who helped put the fiscal house in order. These are the folks who, since 1995, have been footing the bill in one way or another, either through increased taxes—over the last four years they have been paying $20 billion more in taxes than they did in 1993—or through various cuts that affect them directly.\n\nIt is low and middle income taxpayers who are responsible for the improved public finances. They are the ones who should be reaping the benefits of the lowered deficit. They should be the first to enjoy tax breaks and relief in general.\n\nThey should be the first because middle-income taxpayers—who are defined as those earning between $45,000 and $70,000—face the highest taxes of all Canadians. They are the ones facing one of the highest tax rates compared with American taxpayers. If there is going to be tax relief, it should not be for millionaires or friends of the Minister of Finance. Nor should it take the form of a tax reform that would benefit international shipping companies such as Canada Steamship Lines, which is owned by the Minister of Finance. Nor will the taxpayer be helped by giving preferential treatment to the very rich, for example by allowing them to transfer millions, if not billions, all over the world in the form of family trusts.\n\nThis will be done by enacting a general lightening of the tax burden on two groups, the low and middle income groups. This can be done by fully indexing the tax tables. It can also be done by raising the minimum threshold, or in other words allowing people to earn more before they have to start paying income tax. This would help those with low and middle incomes.\n\nIn this consultation, we were clearly given a third priority—I am talking here of the true consultation, not the one that led to a Liberal majority propaganda report, but the consultations carried out throughout Quebec by the Bloc Quebecois—and that priority was improved employment insurance.\n\nThere was unanimity on this in Quebec. If I recall, during the prebudget consultations across Canada, people were also saying “It no longer makes any sense at all to have reformed the unemployment insurance program, changing its name to employment insurance, and to have severely cut back on benefits, so much so that fewer than 40% of people paying into the fund—everyone pays now—can draw employment insurance benefits”.\n\nThere are three ways of ending up with stupendous surpluses in the employment insurance fund, as we have seen over the past three years. The first is by maintaining employers' and employees' contributions to the fund at an artificially high level. The second is to successfully reduce access to the program. The third is to reduce benefits.\n\nThese are the three objectives of the employment insurance reform, which it achieves so successfully that every year we end up with a $6 billion surplus. These surpluses are generated off the backs of the contributors, that is, employers and employees, and the unemployed.\n\nIn recent weeks, they have gone so far as to exert pressure. This has happened in a number of regions in Quebec. I have seen it in Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot as well. The officials at the employment centres are putting pressure on the unemployed, on those appealing decisions on overpayments. Pressure is put on them to subtly take away their right to appeal. This action is deliberate. The unemployed are being called and told not to appeal, there is no point. There is a limit to the harassment of these people.\n\n1315\n\nDo you know why they are being harassed? Because the more they harass them, the bigger the surplus there will be to swell the popularity of the future leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, the Minister of Finance. That is awful. My colleagues and I discussed this at the latest caucus meeting. We are going to wage all-out war against these claims by a little mafia gang trying to intimidate the unemployed and take away their right to be treated fairly.\n\nWhile things go awry with the employment insurance system, as things are a total fiasco, while everybody is criticizing the Minister of Human Resources Development, this gentleman is writing a book on his deep thoughts.\n\nIn response to our questions in the House, he answered all sorts of things making it clear to us that he was not on top of his responsibilities and that he did not know what was going on, but we did not know why. We thought it was a matter of intelligence. But now we know that he was writing his book, dashing off his deep thoughts.\n\nHe even had the nerve to talk about the disadvantaged in his book, when he actually had a hand in creating this situation where the unemployed, who no longer qualify for employment insurance thanks to him, find themselves marginalized. Do you know who this minister reminds me of? He reminds me of Lucius Domitius Tiberius Claudius Nero, commonly known as Emperor Nero. Nero set Rome ablaze and declaimed his sorrow as the city burned. I find it despicable.\n\nWhat the unemployed see is a human resources development minister, who is supposed to be taking care of business and fixing a system that does not make sense anymore, out promoting the sale of his book and using his own intellectual resources, and probably departmental resources as well, to boost his popularity.\n\nUnder other circumstances, had he not had other responsibilities, one might have said he was provoking thought, but for a minister who has been doing a poor job since taking over his department, has been sharply criticized and is putting everyone in the street, to put his deep thoughts in a book as he did, is an absolute disgrace.\n\nTo conclude, we hope that Minister of Finance will show common sense in his budget and put any surplus to use in the interest of the public at large and not a select few.\n\nWe hope he will show respect for the unemployed and those who pay into the EI fund and show more respect than his Prime Minister did for the provinces that have had it with all this being done on their backs and having various conditions imposed on them as well.\n\n[English]\n\nHon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.): Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot.\n\n[Translation]\n\nLet me suggest that what is shameful and scandalous is the manner in which he has criticized two ministers, as he has just done here in the House, because he does not have the backbone to do so outside.\n\nMr. Yvan Loubier: I will. I have done so before.\n\nHon. Sheila Finestone: Go ahead and do it outside the House, and you will see what reaction you get.\n\n[English]\n\nI would like to ask the member who has been so busy being negative in making his comments in this House, why Quebec and he representing the Bloc Quebecois, never calculate the amount of dollars saved by the Quebec government and the Quebec people by the reduction of interest rates to benefit them and to use their priorities in the allocation of funds both as a result of the reduction in tax rates and the fact that they have had not only lower interest rates, but have had an increase and a transfer in tax points worth many millions of dollars?\n\nWith the tax points and the lower interest rates, Quebec has had a savings of hundreds of millions of dollars which the Bloc members do not care to announce, do not care to acknowledge but just care to criticize and be untruthful in their approach to the things that are going on in Quebec. They are certainly not interested in health care, certainly not interested in the citizens and certainly not interested in the education of their youth with the highest school dropout rate in the whole of Canada. The member should be ashamed of his remarks.\n\n[Translation]\n\nMr. Yvan Loubier: Mr. Speaker, if the member had read the paper this morning, she would know that I have already commented on this to a journalist, from the Gazette furthermore. As far as I know, she can read English.\n\n1320\n\nI made exactly the same comments about the Minister of Human Resources Development as those I made in the House, so it is not a question of having the backbone. If she thinks the government is so wonderful with its tax points, she is mistaken. In any event, she has been mistaken as long as we have known her. As a member of Parliament, she is often mistaken. But this time, she shows her ignorance by constantly harping on the tax points ceded to Quebec in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThese tax points were ceded at a 1964 meeting between Mr. Pearson, a very sensible Canadian, and Mr. Lesage.\n\nI would like to put a question to the member. If there had been no cuts, if things had been left as they were in 1994 where federal transfers to the provinces were concerned, what would the level of tax points transferred to the provinces have been? Exactly the same as they are today. This is undeniable proof that the changes in tax points are completely independent of federal government decisions. This is a given.\n\nIs someone going to go after the person who sold him a house 50 years ago because the roof is now leaking? It is the same thing. As futile as debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.\n\nAs for her reference to the good things the federal government has done, my colleagues and I have tried to find some.\n\nAn hon. member: We are looking.\n\nMr. Yvan Loubier: We are still looking, and maybe one day will find some. But if one reads between the lines of the prepared words that come out of the PMO or the office of the Minister of Finance, one can see there has been nothing positive.\n\nHow could there be when, since 1995, it has been decreed that there will be cuts year after year until 2003 in the health field? How could there be, when they have the nerve to want to use the contributions of employers and employees to the employment insurance fund to finance tax cuts for the rich?\n\nWhere are these positive actions? How are the interests of the people of the people of Quebec and of Canada being served? We are still looking, and maybe one day we will manage to find some.\n\nMs. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP): Mr. Speaker, I thank the Bloc Quebecois member for his comments.\n\nHe is very familiar with the employment insurance issue, and he is aware that it is a very important issue in New Brunswick. Our province has suffered losses of $927 million in revenues.\n\nWhenever we put a question to him, the Minister of Human Resources Development tells us that he is giving back $5 million here and $2 million there, through various programs. My riding of Beauséjour—Petitcodiac is losing $35.8 million every year. People in Albert County only collected employment insurance benefits for 18 weeks, even though they live in rural areas. Also, fewer and fewer women qualify for the program.\n\nWe have a surplus that keeps increasing and that will exceed $20 million. We know that poverty is on the rise in every region where unemployment is high.\n\nCould the hon. member tell us what he thinks the government will do, more specifically the Minister of Human Resources Development, who is always trying to make us believe that 72 per cent of workers qualify for unemployment insurance benefits and that his government is putting money back into the regions? Is the Minister of Human Resources Development telling us what his government is really doing?\n\nMr. Yvan Loubier: Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker. What the Minister of Human Resources Development tells us is the total opposite of the truth. He twists the figures. He twists them in a scandalous way. Fewer than 40% of people can draw employment insurance benefits.\n\nFrom December 2 last until March 31, employer and employee contributions to the employment insurance fund have been and will be used solely to increase the employment insurance fund surplus.\n\nEven with the 15 cent decrease in contributions set by the Minister of Finance last November, the surplus in the fund is still going to end up over $6 billion. This is going to be used for something other than helping the unemployed in New Brunswick or anywhere else in Canada.\n\nAs I have said, the situation is so serious that not only has access been reduced, thus adding to the surplus, but the unemployed are, as well, now being harassed into not challenging claims for supposed overpayments before the Commission. This is serious. It means that the rights of the unemployed are being denied, while the members opposite are pretending everything is just great, because there are not many appeals.\n\nOne day, the self-same Minister of Human Resources Development will be getting up to say “Judging by the number of complaints there have been in the past six months, things are going well. The number of complaints is dropping.”\n\n1325\n\nI understand, throughout Quebec and Canada people are being discouraged from appealing overpayments, and that will be reflected in the statistics the minister likes so much to refer to, although he does it all wrong. This man has not served, and does not, serve the interests of the unemployed.\n\nAs I have said, I find it rather distasteful that he speaks in his report of the most disadvantaged and of his priorities, when in fact he is the one responsible for increasing collective poverty\n\nMs. Angela Vautour: Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his answer.\n\nI wonder if he is aware of the situation in which the Department of Human Resources Development could accuse an individual applying for benefits of fraud and force them to repay money, even though they have never received a cent from the government.\n\nThis situation has occurred in the Atlantic provinces. There are people there who apply and then go on to find a job. They report it on their card, but if the amount is not exactly what they earned, even if the department has not paid them a cent, officials can come after them a year later and ask them to repay the difference between the amount they reported and the amount they actually earned working.\n\nBut neither the Department of Human Resources Development nor any other department paid the individual applying for benefits a single cent. The individual never got a cent, but can be asked to repay the difference. Is the hon. member aware of this situation?\n\nMr. Yvan Loubier: Mr. Speaker, I must say this is the first time I hear about such a situation. However, there have been a number of other cases where small overpayments were claimed. People's initial reaction was “I will settle this and pay the amount”, even though they knew they had not received that money. Since they could not prove their case, they paid the amount that was claimed.\n\nBut what they did not know—and these people are not told about their rights in human resources development centres—is that once they recognized that an overpayment had been made to them and once they paid the amount, they became, in the eyes of the minister and his henchmen, guilty parties. They now have a black mark on their employment insurance file, and the next time they have the misfortune of being unemployed and make a claim under the employment insurance program, the department will take a look at their file. Because they spontaneously paid the money back, these people will be penalized in terms of the number of weeks required to get their first benefits. People must be made aware of that situation and it is our duty to do so.\n\n[English]\n\nMs. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP): Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity this afternoon to participate in this prebudget debate.\n\nI know that traditionally this debate focuses on the report of the finance committee's fall hearings, but today I want to take the opportunity to report on prebudget consultations that I and my NDP colleagues have been holding around the country. We have returned to parliament having consulted with a lot of Canadians on their vision for a renewed Canada and on the budget priorities needed to translate that vision into reality.\n\nPeople we have met in every corner of Canada are concerned about the crisis in health care, the escalation of child poverty, the gutting of unemployment insurance and the national emergency in homelessness. These are the devastating deficits created by this government's reckless disregard for the health of families, the health of communities and the health of our national economy.\n\nIn a series of community based economic round tables over the past two months bringing together people from all walks of life and all segments of the community to share their ideas on job creation, we heard very different views and priorities from those advocated by the Liberal majority on the finance committee telegraphing no doubt what the finance minister will say on budget day. Those Liberals think it is enough to cut the surtax for those in the highest income bracket and to throw a few token dollars back into health care.\n\n1330\n\nNow that they have made the sacrifices to balance the budget, Canadians want the federal government to reinvest in the social programs that bring security to their lives and stability to their communities. They want some leadership from the government in tackling the challenges of the new economy.\n\nWhen it comes to health care the Liberal government refuses to listen to Canadians. Emergency rooms are overcrowded. Waiting lists are getting longer. Hospitals are discharging patients earlier and earlier without publicly provided home care being there for them. That is why only 30% of Canadians give our health care system a favourable rating today compared to 60% in 1991. It is why there are growing fears that our health care system, a uniquely Canadian combination of innovation and social responsibility, is going to surrender to a foreign American style two tier health care system.\n\nThis government is busy advertising the upcoming budget as the so-called health budget, and yet having taken $2.5 billion out of transfers in each of the past three years, all finds would suggest it may restore less than one-quarter of what it has ripped out of the health care system. Having reduced the federal share of health spending from the original 50% to 11% today, the Liberals have the gall to lecture the provincial governments about their responsibilities for health care. An immediate injection of $2.5 billion into health transfers to the provinces this year is the minimum required to get our health care system off the critical list.\n\nSecond, any health accord between the federal and provincial governments must generate secure long term federal funding to enable the provinces to deliver home care and pharma care programs at a standard adequate to meet the needs of Canadians regardless of where they live.\n\nA decade has passed since parliamentarians in the House unanimously endorsed Ed Broadbent's motion, my predecessor, to end child poverty in Canada by 2000. It will be the shameful legacy, the most lasting and damning legacy of this finance minister that on his watch child poverty was proclaimed a national tragedy and homelessness a national emergency in communities right across the country.\n\nCanadians are disheartened by the federal government's abandonment of all responsibility for social housing. They are humiliated at the UN's condemnation of federal Liberal policies that have dramatically increased poverty and homelessness during a period of economic growth, fuelling deeper and deeper divisions in Canadian society, and deteriorating conditions most drastically of all among our aboriginal peoples.\n\nMillions of Canadians do not need experts to tell them about poverty and homelessness because they experience it every day in their lives. Others who may not experience directly the punishing effects of this abandonment nevertheless share the sense of loss. Canadians want a recommitment of a significant, not token, federal role in social housing and leadership in the reduction of poverty in our midst. If this government's betrayal of the poor and homeless has resulted from heartless neglect, erosion of our employment insurance system has been an act of wilful sabotage.\n\nThe government set out to destroy deliberately what little security was offered by employment insurance, and it succeeded in spades. Over 70% of unemployed Canadians received insurance benefits in 1989. Less than 40% do so today. In my riding of Halifax it is down to 29%.\n\n1335\n\nTragically and predictably, this has imposed great hardship on many families. It has driven many more into the ranks of poverty. It has also sucked tens of millions of dollars from local economies in communities right across the land.\n\nThe federal government must stop funding its general programs with resources collected from employers and workers for the benefit of the unemployed.\n\nThe upcoming budget must recommit employment insurance funds for their intended use, for adequate income replacement for unemployed workers and for investment in training and other active transition measures.\n\nThe government has acted with the same lack of social responsibility with regard to post-secondary education. The Liberals have simply transferred a portion of the federal debt on to to the personal debtloads of Canada's young people. In some parts of Canada we have a university system today that is public in name only. Tuition fees have skyrocketed beyond the reach of most working families. Our so-called public universities are being transformed into institutions for the privileged elites.\n\nThis government has betrayed a whole generation of young Canadians in much the same way that it has betrayed its own women employees in its refusal to negotiate in good faith on outstanding pay equity claims upheld by Canadian courts.\n\nThe first call on the budget surplus therefore is for government to begin repairing the damage that its policies have inflicted on our social fabric, on our communities, on our hospitals, on our schools and on the programs which extend support to the unemployed and our most vulnerable citizens who for whatever reasons are not able to fend for themselves. Canadians insist that their government fulfil these social responsibilities in a fiscally responsible manner.\n\nFor decades we have watched Liberal and Conservative governments adopt policies that led to annual deficits, a ballooning debt and rising personal taxes. This happened not because the government was providing more and better social programs. It is quite the opposite. The mounting debt and higher personal taxes resulted from the artificially high interest rates forced on this country by the Bank of Canada. In an act of supreme irresponsibility, the Bank of Canada knowingly deepened the last two recessions leaving lasting scars on both the public finances and on the lives of millions of ordinary Canadians.\n\nAs a result of that colossal blunder, Canadians are now paying higher taxes for fewer public services, paying more on interest payments on the debt than on any single social program. It is a bit like a family paying ever higher and higher mortgage payments on a house that is getting shabbier and more run down every year.\n\nWe must reverse this situation and we must begin with badly needed renovations on our house while also reducing the burden of our mortgage payments.\n\nCanadians therefore want and deserve a fairer tax system. They want the debt problem addressed. It is not a question of whether these things should be done but a question of how.\n\nOn taxes the Liberal majority on the finance committee apparently thinks that the first priority should be to remove the surtax on those in the highest income bracket. We in the New Democratic Party think there is a fairer and more effective way to grant tax relief. The first priority must be the tax reduction that will benefit the most people, a reduction in the GST.\n\nLet me remind the House that a 1% reduction in the GST will give the biggest boost to the economy and create the most numbers of jobs while giving desperately needed tax relief to ordinary families.\n\nOn the debt, indications are that the finance minister wants to spend most of the surplus on direct repayment of the fiscal debt. This would be as imprudent and irresponsible as incurring another round of deficits.\n\n1340\n\nWith the uncertainties in the global economy Canadians could face a recession in coming months. We have already seen the terrible impact that the collapse in commodity prices has had on farm incomes. The federal government has been desperately slow to respond to this crisis in our farming communities and must do so now, adequately and decisively in the upcoming budget.\n\nBecause of the threat of a severe economic downturn resulting from the crisis in international markets it would be irresponsible to add to these risks. Overly aggressive debt repayment would put an additional drag on economic growth. Ironically such an ill advised course of action could slow down the economy to the point of forcing us into a deficit situation next year. That is something we must avoid. We need an approach that balances the need to lessen the burden of interest charges on the debt with the obligation to avoid risks with the economy.\n\nRecommitment to social responsibility and a responsible balanced approach to spending, tax relief and debt reduction are the things Canadians want in the upcoming budget. These questions have been on the agenda for more than two decades. Canadians are looking for some leadership, some vision and some imagination in dealing with the challenges of rapid technological change in a world of global economic uncertainty. That leadership is needed to tackle the continuing high rate of unemployment and severe under employment that plagues too many Canadians.\n\nThe most recent disastrous decision that shows the government's insensitivity and unwillingness to respond to those continuing high levels of unemployment is its decision last week to pull the plug on Devco, an important engine of economic activity and growth in the Nova Scotia economy, a community suffering from an official unemployment level of over 20% and unofficially estimated to be above 40%.\n\nLeadership is also needed to reduce the insecurity and stresses on families struggling to deal with deteriorating health care, escalating education costs and the erosion of vitally important public services. In the past 15 years the two parties holding government in this country has pursued virtually the same course, reduce inflation, cut the deficit, slash social programs, weaken worker ability to bargain selectively and somehow we will all be in economic clover. This government calls it getting the economic fundamentals right. It has not worked. It is not going to work to improve the living standards of ordinary people. It has not worked to lift families out of poverty. It has not worked for the homeless. The earnings of low and middle income Canadians have fallen rather than risen in the past decade. Ordinary Canadians are working harder and harder for less and less.\n\nThe government's formula has not worked in its own terms. Getting the economic fundamentals right, as it loves to say, has not got the economic fundamentals right. The Canadian dollar has declined to a level that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. Economic analysts are unanimous in condemning the Canadian economy for one of the worst records in productivity growth among the major world economies. Despite generous tax measures in place, corporations in Canada, especially foreign multinationals, rate very poorly in research and development, one of the keys to future economic prosperity.\n\nTo ensure the vibrant economy that we need, to create the badly needed jobs and to sustain the social programs that Canadians cherish we must get beyond the complacent and lazy notion that getting the economic fundamentals right is enough. Canadians need government to encourage the kind of economic practices that will lead to a genuine widely shared prosperity that enables ordinary Canadians to make a rewarding life for themselves.\n\n1345\n\nThe first challenge is to reinvest in our social programs. This will benefit the economy in general and it will generate decent, rewarding jobs in health, education and other vital public services like environmental protection and clean-up, benefiting those who fill the new jobs but also the community where those jobs are created.\n\nThe second challenge is to ensure that the savings of ordinary Canadians are channelled into the long term responsible investments that will lead to improvements in productivity. Our current tax system treats short term speculation in exactly the same way as long term investments that create productivity improvements and sustainable jobs. This has to change. Our productivity challenge is to find practical ways of encouraging pension funds and other pools of savings into the kinds of investments that will improve productivity and assist community economic development.\n\nWe must make sure that everyone, not just computer wizards, gets the training they need to keep up with the dizzying pace of technological change. Canadians need ready access to educational opportunity and we must find ways to get employers to do a better job of investing in on the job training.\n\nWhen profitable companies like Bell Canada sell off one of their divisions to avoid paying their pay equity obligations and to drastically reduce the pay and benefits of long service employees, there is something seriously wrong with our economic culture. An economy without expectations of corporate responsibility, where decision makers put shareholder value above all other values to the exclusion of their commitments to long serving employees and above their community obligations is one that is surely failing. As long as employees have no reason to trust in the good faith of their employers, no sense that their loyalty and service will be respected and rewarded, our economy will not be as productive as it needs to be.\n\nIn the case of Bell Canada the CRTC must review whether Bell Canada's actions violate federal regulations, but in general Canadians expect their government to start building the framework for an economic citizenship where economic decision makers are bound not just by the short term bottom line but to their responsibilities to communities where they do business, to the environment and to their employees.\n\nThe performance of our economy is not only a question of the quality of our technology. It depends on the social capital of trust between employer and employee in a democratic workplace and on the good citizenship of economic decision makers. To build such an economic citizenship in the context of globalization is a huge challenge and one that cries for federal leadership.\n\nAnother economic challenge requiring imagination is the situation facing Canadian families who are increasingly stressed out trying to juggle work and family responsibilities of children, of frail family members and of elderly parents. There is a shortage of affordable quality day care and no financial support for parents who care for their young children or elderly parents at home. Inflexible work arrangements make it difficult for parents to be at home when kids are forced to stay home sick or when kids return after school.\n\nNeither the government nor the private sector has begun to meet the challenge of creating arrangements that reconcile a thriving economy with a thriving community that meets the needs of families. Canadians need their government to make this a priority. They need solid progress toward this important objective.\n\nIn conclusion, to make progress in these areas will take imaginative visionary leadership. Canadians are not getting that currently from the government or their Prime Minister. How typical of the Prime Minister's arrogance and petty mindedness when before Christmas he said to Canadians that some mornings he wakes up and he feels like giving the provinces some more money for health, and other mornings he wakes up and he does not feel like giving Canadians more money for health. He might as well have said let them eat cake.\n\nCanadians deserve better, and on their behalf we demand better in the upcoming federal budget.\n\n1350\n\nMr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.): Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the leader of the New Democratic Party. I am reminded of listening to Tommy Douglas in the 1960s and 1970s. The speeches do not seem very different to me.\n\nThe issue I hear coming across loud and strong is that we should spend more money. Canada is the second highest spender on health care in the western world. We have to recognize that we are spending exceedingly great amounts of money on health care.\n\nI do not deny that the member's argument contains a lot of concern about the delivery of the system. However I wish the member would have taken more time to say how we could deliver health care more effectively to the citizens of Canada within the parameters of our current spending envelope rather than simply writing more cheques.\n\nMy constituents are telling me that they do not want governments to spend more money in spite of the consultative process they claim to have gone through. The people of Durham are saying that they do not want governments to spend more money. In fact they want governments to have accountability for the money they are spending. They want more service for the money being spent. The answer is not simply to spend more money.\n\nThe member went on to talk about labour productivity. I am very concerned about the issue because labour is hiding behind a deflated and imaginary value of the Canadian dollar. The day the Canadian dollar starts trading anywhere close to 85 cents there will be massive unemployment in the country. The the association between labour productivity and the unemployment insurance system is inescapable.\n\nDoes the member have any commitment at all to balanced budgets in the future?\n\nMs. Alexa McDonough: Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear that not only the Prime Minister is not listening to Canadians. It is not just the finance minister who is not listening to Canadians. Backbenchers in the Liberal caucus are clearly not listening to Canadians. This backbencher certainly did not listen to what I was saying.\n\nThere is no rule in the House that requires him to do so. I acknowledge that. However, if he rises to ask questions one would hope that he would have listened to my making a point that I will make again very clearly for him to hear one more time. Canadians are looking for accountability in how their governments deal with health care. That is why they are offended by his government ripping billions and billions of dollars, massive amounts of dollars, out of the health system unilaterally and refusing to be accountable for what it has done in that regard.\n\nAccountability is needed but Canadians are sick and tired of the hypocrisy of the Liberals saying to the provinces that they should be accountable for health care dollars. The provinces should be accountable for health care but so too should the federal government be accountable for health care.\n\nMr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC): Mr. Speaker, I heard a lot of fluff in the speech from the leader of the New Democratic Party.\n\nIf she became leader of the country what would she do differently than when her cousin, Bob Rae, took over the Ontario government? In his tenure he lost close to 500,000 jobs for Ontario. He virtually took a balanced budget and Ontario into roughly a $14 billion deficit in a short period of four or five years. Meanwhile Mike Harris, since he has been in office, has created 500,000 jobs.\n\nWhat would the leader of the NDP do differently than her cousin Bob Rae did in his tenure as leader of the Ontario NDP?\n\n1355\n\nMs. Alexa McDonough: Mr. Speaker, it is extremely disappointing to think that opposition members in that distant corner are so disinterested in holding the federal Liberal government to account that they want to divert attention, to divert pressure and to talk about a provincial government of a different political stripe in a bygone era of almost a decade ago. I do not think that is doing what constituents elected federal members of parliament to come to Ottawa to do.\n\nThe government needs opposition members who are seriously interested in demanding accountability, in focusing on the challenges we face today and tomorrow in delivering an adequate government and quality social programs, in balancing the budget and in seizing the important economic challenges we are facing in an increasingly complicated global economy.\n\nMr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.): Mr. Speaker, does the leader of the newly business friendly New Democratic Party want to see a combination of cutbacks and higher spending, or has it entered her mind that perhaps some tax cuts might be useful?\n\nMs. Alexa McDonough: Mr. Speaker, we have just seen a demonstration of one more way in which government members and official opposition members behave in the exact same manner. Members from neither party listen to a single word said in the House by anybody but their own apologists in their own caucuses. Members from neither party seem to understand the notion of walking and chewing gum at the same time.\n\nIt is absolutely clear that Canadians do not want either/or. They do not want better and more accountable spending but recklessness with respect to dealing with the budget. They want both/and. If the government cannot deliver both, it is darn clear the official opposition cannot deliver either. That is why we are prepared to present a real alternative.\n\nSTATEMENTS BY MEMBERS\n\n[Translation]\n\nKANGIQSUALUJJUAQ TRAGEDY\n\nMr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.): Mr. Speaker, January 1, 1999, will always be a sad day for the people of Kangiqsualujjuaq, in the Nunavik. We are not about to forget that, on that day, an avalanche destroyed the school's gymnasium, injuring many people and killing nine Inuit.\n\nSeconds after this tragedy occurred, without hesitation, dozens of members of this Inuit community rushed out to get the search and rescue operation under way in the middle of the night to prevent further loss of life.\n\nI wish to draw the attention of all Canadians to the magnitude of the work done since this tragic event and the difficult conditions in which it was performed following the avalanche.\n\nThe constant co-operation of experts from various Inuit organizations and from provincial and federal departments throughout t"
