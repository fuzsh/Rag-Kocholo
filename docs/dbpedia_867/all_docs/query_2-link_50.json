        "text": "The long coastline of Ulster has consigned many ships, sailors and passengers to a watery grave.\n\nMany of the graveyards that lie within reach of the coast offer a sad reminder of the treacherous nature of the sea and the cold comfort it often offered those who laboured and travelled upon it. Graves with anchors or ships carved into the headstone are a commonplace sight; inscriptions detailing souls consigned to the depths a not infrequent occurrence.\n\nThe most famous of all maritime disasters, the sinking of the Titanic, had its origins in Belfast, but\n\nlocally, the worst single loss of life occurred when the Princess Victoria ferry capsized and foundered off Belfast Lough, with the loss of 133 passengers, in January 1953.\n\nOne of the dark ironies of the Princess Victoria catastrophe was the fact that all 44 survivors were male; the women and children who had sought safety in a lifeboat all perished when the waves flung their boat against the upturned hull of the ship. One of the female victims of the disaster lies in Connor graveyard and is remembered by the following inscription: In loving memory of Ann V E Jackson MBE, eldest daughter of Hugh and Jane Jackson, who lost her life as a result of the sinking of M V Princess Victoria, on 31st January 1953, and whose body was found at Whithorn Bay, Wigtownshire and interred in this family grave on 10th March 1953\n\nThe Belfast News Letter of July 16, 1912 attempted to resolve what it described as “The Belfast Lough Mystery”, concerning the disappearance of three friends who set sail in a small boat from Carrickfergus bound for Islandmagee. Their waterlogged boat was found abandoned at the entrance to the Lough, between Blackhead and Ballycormick Point. The newspaper speculated that the boat may have capsized in a squall or filled with water from the wash of a cross channel steamer. Two of the men could swim but the third was “not acquainted with the natatory art”, as the reporter somewhat pretentiously termed it. The men were Joseph Parks, a joiner aged 23; William Keyes, an ornamental plasterer aged 19; and the original object of the historical search, James McCracken, a joiner aged 30, from Landscape Terrace, Crumlin Road.\n\nOn July 17 1868 the Belfast News Letter covered another “Fatal Boat Accident In The Lough” which resulted in “A most melancholy accident…, resulting in the death of three men, and in consequences of a dangerous character to two others.” The dead included William Grant, a 35-year-old baker, who left behind a widow and three children. The inscription on William Grant’s tombstone in Clifton Street cemetery, Belfast, reads:\n\nErected by Agnes GRANT in memory of her father William Skillen, died Sept 17, 1845 aged 59 years Her mother Agnes Skillen died April 30, 1857 aged 62 years Her brother William died Aug 24, 1865 aged 40 years Her husband William Grant who was accidentally drowned in Belfast Lough, July 15, 1868 aged 37 years Her daughters: Elizabeth died Aug 3, 1864 aged 2 years Mary died Aug 11, 1864 in infancy, Wilhelmina Skillen, Nov 6, 1868 aged 7 months, and Agnes, June 6, 1886 aged 26 years The above named Agnes Grant died Feb 1, 1903 aged 73 years\n\nThe newspaper account of his death continued:\n\n“This lamentable occurrence, at any time of a character to bring gloom with it, was doubly depressing, owing to the unhappy contrast in which it appeared with the animated sports of the preceding part of the evening. The approaching darkness and the strength of the breeze were the only causes that could account for the accident. We may mention that the occupants of the boat were perfectly sober.”\n\nThe newspapers of the time seemed fixated upon the alcoholic intake of drowning victims. When Roger Dewhurst, a “respectable and extensive Corn Merchant”, was drowned in the Newry Canal, the Belfast News Letter stated: “We conclude that the ill-fated gentleman (who was perfectly sober) had intended to cross the bridge; but that instead of diverging a little to the right as he ought, he had inadvertently walked forward, in a straight line, towards the canal, (the bank of which is unprovided with the slightest security to the unwary passenger) and thus fallen in.”\n\nRoger Dewhurst is buried in St Patrick’s churchyard, Newry and his inscription reads:\n\nSacred to the memory of Roger Dewhurst, formerly of Preston but late of Newry, Corn Merchant, who was unfortunately [sic] drowned in the Newry canal on the night of the 29th November 1829 This stone is erected as a small tribute to his many virtues.\n\nThe Belfast News Letter of December 28, 1859 revealed the sad details behind the following inscription: in Armoy Presbyterian cemetery:\n\nHere lieth the body of Alexander Neill, Surgeon Royal Navy Coleraine who died 22nd June 1857 aged 58 years, also the body of his son Hugh who was drowned at Coleraine 26th December 1859 aged 22 years, Alexander Neill 22nd June 1857 Hugh Neill 26th December 1859.\n\nMelancholy Incident. – A telegram was received in Derry on Saturday, stating that a young gentleman named Neill, a solicitor’s apprentice in the town of Coleraine, was drowned when skating on the Brook Dam, in consequence of the breaking of the ice. After the above was in type, we received a communication from a correspondent in Coleraine, to the effect that Mr Neill lost his life in a praiseworthy attempt to save the lives of two young lads, named Russell and Clarke, who went down through the ice near to where he was standing at the time; and though Doctors Sharpe and Carson were prompt in their attendance, after they were taken out of the water, the three perished, all efforts to restore animation proving ineffectual. The sad occurrence has cast a gloom over the town of Coleraine.\n\nWilliam Bathurst, whose remains lie in Clifton Street cemetery in Belfast, fell victim to a similar fate. The inscription on his family headstone reads:\n\nErected by William Bathurst jun, in memory of his father Wm Bathurst, who departed this life at Consbrook, Co Down, 23rd November 1867 aged 68 years Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord Also two of his grandchildren who died in infancy.\n\nHis death was reported in the Belfast News Letter on Christmas Eve 1867 as follows:\n\nAbout half-past three o’ clock yesterday afternoon a melancholy ice accident occurred at Kilroot, about two miles from Carrickfergus. It appears that two young gentlemen named Wm. Bathurst, aged about twenty-one years, son of the late William Bathurst, coachbuilder, Belfast, and William Taggart, son of the late Dr Taggart, of Carrickfergus, who were students under the Rev J. H. Bennett, Rector of Templecurran and Kilroot, and boarded in his house, went out to skate on a mill pond connected with what was formerly the Kilroot bleach green. When some distance from the bank the ice suddenly gave way and both were immersed. Some children observed the occurrence and raised an alarm, and a man named Dougal Percy, in the employment of Mr Bennett, proceeded to the place with ropes and succeeded in rescuing Taggart, who was in an exhausted condition, but poor Bathurst had disappeared. Head-Constable McDermott of Carrickfergus, having been made aware of the accident, proceeded to the pond with a number of his men, and a boat having been procured the body was grappled for and recovered, after being two hours in the water. The accident has cast quite a gloom over the neighbourhood.\n\nOn January 16 1884 detailed coverage was given to the inquest into the death of 18 year old Samuel Giffin, who was bayoneted by a policeman during disturbances following an Orange Order parade in Dromore on New Year’s Day. He died on January 9 and his funeral was expected to be “the largest ever seen in the North of Ireland.”\n\nHe lies in Seagoe cemetery and his inscription reads: Sacred to the memory of Samuel James Giffin of Portadown, when while testifying his loyalty to his Queen and country at the Dromore Meeting, County Tyrone on 1st January 1884, received a bayonet wound from a policeman and of which he died on 8th January 1884 aged 18 years This tablet is erected by a few Tyrone loyalists Also his mother Ruth Giffin, who died 8th Nov 1894, aged 48 years Also his father James Giffin, who died 23rd April 1906 aged 70 years.\n\nThe account of the inquest offers a fascinating insight into the legal procedures of the time as well as the enduring nature of sectarian enmity and the conflicting views of controversial events. A witness, Robert Thompson, a farmer from Trillick, described, under questioning, the wounding of Giffin: “Did you see anything occur when the police were going across the ridge? The parties were going back towards the town, and the police were following slowly. Did you see any change of speed? One policeman went a few ridges further forward than the rest. Did you see anything taking place? I saw that policeman take his gun with a bayonet on it – they all had bayonets on – take his gun and strike or punch at a boy or man in the field. I did not know which at the time. What was the effect of that stroke? The boy fell into the furze then. Did he rise again? He made some struggles to get up, but he was not fit to get to this feet. I saw one man strive to lift him but he was not able to do so.\n\n“The man who inflicted the wound must have used his full strength, for the weapon went through him, but that it did not come out at the other side. There is another matter – I don’t know whether I ought to mention it or not, that struck me as exceedingly strange, that there were two army medical men there, furnished with every appliance, they were never ordered to attend this unfortunate man. We had the greatest difficulty in getting him a glass of whisky. I know this much of the duties of army medical men, that when engaged in actual warfare, and that they are on the side of the victors after the battle has ended, it is their duty to attend to the enemy’s as well as their own wounded. That is the usual custom.”\n\nAmidst the parochial slaughter, a killing with an international flavour is bound to stand out. A brutal stabbing in 1810, which led to a Portuguese sailor being hanged near Carrickfergus, became a sensation of the time. His name was Antonio de Silva, a sailor on board an American ship in Belfast harbour. He allegedly stabbed to death a ship’s carpenter called Robert Morrison, and was subsequently tried and convicted of the crime. The place of execution was a mile outside Carrickfergus, and the apparatus used for the execution consisted of three tall columns, with a cross-beam, to which the rope was attached. They were familiarly known as the Three Sisters, and stood directly on the seashore.\n\nPublic hangings were as much a spectator sport as a demonstration of justice in action, and such a large crowd attended De Silva’s execution, that it took an hour to make the short journey to the place of dispatch.\n\nRobert Morrison is buried in Carrickfergus North cemetery and his headstone bears the following inscription: Erected by the shipwrights of --- in memory of Robert Morrison, shipwright, who was assassinated by a Portuguese sailor, 22nd of April 1810 aged 23 years Array'd in hope that fatal morn arose He knew no guilt and therefore felt no dread He little dream't that ere the evening's close He should be numbered with the silent dead Ye mourning friends suppress your cries Who like the early blessed flower he fell, If Truth and Virtue shall to Heaven arise There with his God, the youth is going to dwell.\n\nThe Belfast News Letter covered the inquest into the death of Robert Morrison, and offered, quite literally, a blow-by-blow account of his death. It was clear from the reporting that guilt had already been attributed to the Portuguese sailor.\n\n“It appeared in evidence, that the Portuguese had a dispute with some person or persons unknown, and retiring to the ship, which lies at the Quay, had armed himself with a dagger, with which he sallied out to be revenged upon the person with whom he had previously quarrelled: with this weapon he first attacked a man of the name of Campbell, but finding this was not the man he wanted, he relinquished him, and afterwards met with the deceased in company with two other persons, at the door of a public house; one or two other Portuguese were in company, and an assault was commenced by them upon the deceased and his companions, one of whom received two or three stabs with the same weapon, and also a severe blow on the head with a stick. Just at this moment the deceased received the fatal blow, which entered a little below his left breast, and almost instantly expired. The other two Portuguese are also in custody, and were with the principal culprit, committed to Carrickfergus Jail. They have both given evidence before the Coroner against Silva who, it appears certain, was the actual murderer. It is not positively ascertained whether the deceased or any of his companions were any of the persons with whom the Portuguese had previously quarrelled, nor what was the occasion of the dispute. The verdict of the Jury was, “That the deceased came by his death in consequence of a stab he received in the left breast in a scuffle with Joseph Mores, Anthony Silva and Joaquin Ferrenadare”.\n\nIf, on occasion, foreigners visited these shores with minds set on murder, sometimes locals travelled to far flung shores to keep their appointment with their maker. A gravestone in Whitechurch graveyard, Ballywalter, was the starting point for an investigation that led to a murder of a local man in Morocco, at the hands of what the Belfast News Letter termed, “A Fanatical Mussulman.”\n\nGone to be with Jesus Erected by Alexander Cooper, Belfast, in loving memory of his son Alexander Cooper who died 19th January 1897 aged 17 years Also the above-named Alexander Cooper who died 11th December 1899 aged 44 years Also his son John H Cooper who died 9th Jan 1901 aged 12 years Also his son David J Cooper, missionary, who was shot in North America 17th Oct 1902 aged 29 years Also Margaret, widow of above Alexander Cooper, died 1st June 1923 Also Elizabeth, wife of Walter H Cooper, died 7th March 1961 aged 75 years Also the above Walter H Cooper, JP died 13th October 1964 aged 79 years.\n\nThe report of October 23 1902 read:\n\nOur issue of yesterday contained the brief announcement that Mr Cooper, a Protestant missionary of British nationality had been assassinated at Fez, the capital of Morocco, by a fanatical Mussulman, who fired at him with fatal effect. It now transpires that the victim of the crime, which took place on the 17th inst., was Mr David J Cooper, of Belfast, a young and zealous missionary, who was highly esteemed by a large circle of friends in the city, and whose untimely end will be sincerely regretted by all who knew him. The deceased was a member of the Albertbridge Congregational Church, of which the Rev. James Cregan is the pastor, and for some time he was employed in connection with the city YMCA as assistant secretary to Mr D A Black. He discharged the duties of this position with tact and skill, and was exceedingly popular with all who came into contact with him…He early showed an inclination for evangelistic work, and when he decided to enter the foreign missionary field, it was confidently anticipated by those best able to judge that he would prove a faithful and devoted labourer. Mr Cooper’s offer of service was accepted by the North Africa Mission…he was appointed to the charge of the mission station at Fez, and here he resided with his wife and two children…After the crime, the murderer sought refuge in a mosque, but he was followed and arrested, and subsequently shot by the order of the Sultan.\n\nThe dangers facing the working man were not confined to the mill or factory. Even the recreational environment offered pitfalls to trap the unwary. In Trory Cemetery, Co Fermanagh, an inscription can be found relating to a young man who died aged 17 while playing football:\n\nErected by W C Davies of Enniskillen, In Loving Memory of His Sons William Charles Died 25th Feb 1908 Aged 4 years Albert Elliott Died 14th Jan 1911 Aged 1 year Geoffrey Austin, Killed at football l9th July 1929 Aged 17 years \"Of Such is the Kingdom of God\" MARK X 14.\n\nThe story of his death is told in The Belfast Telegraph of Saturday July 20 1929:\n\nA very regrettable football fatality occurred in Enniskillen, on Friday evening, about 9.45, the victim being Geoffrey Davies, aged 17, of Gaol Square, Enniskillen, death occurring in a few minutes of his having collided with an opposing player.\n\nDeceased was playing for the Caxtonians against the Builders in the local Trades Football Competition, when he, a goalkeeper, in trying to save the imposition of a corner kick, ran from the posts and came violently into contact with Jack Armstrong, one of the Builders’ forwards.\n\nIt was at once seen his injuries were of a serious nature and medical aid was summoned, three doctors responding within a short space of time. The youth, however, was beyond all human aid, death occurring within ten or fifteen minutes of the accident.\n\nWhen the collision occurred there was only a few minutes play to go, and the score was then one goal each.\n\nDeceased, who was an apprentice in the office of the “Fermanagh Times”, was a youth of outstanding ability, of fine athletic build, and was exceedingly popular with all who knew him.\n\nHowever, all classes were susceptible to the fickle finger of fate, as the demise of a scion of one of Ulster’s most noteworthy families demonstrates. The vault of the noted Huguenot family, the Delacherois, commemorates lives of service and achievement:\n\nThis vault was enlarged by Daniel Delacherois, Esqr JP, of the Manor House, Donaghadee, AD 1868 Within rest the remains of Mary CROMMELIN, born -------died ----- unm aged 80 Daniel Delacherois Esq, JP, born 23 June 1735, died 15March 1790 Marcy Delacherois, his wife, born ------- 17--, born -------, died 9 Nov 1844 aged --- Daniel Delacherois, MA TCD, DL, JP, born 10th July 1825, died 8th April 1905 Daniel Delacherois, Esq, JP, DL, born 1 Dec 1783, died 1 Oct 1850, unmd Mary Delacherois, his sister, born 11 April 1790, died 10 March 1854, unmd Ellen, daughter of Geo LESLIE, Esq & wife of Daniel Delacherois, Esq, AM, DL, JP, born 7th Oct 1827, she died 4th Dec 1891 Edmund Bourjonval Delacherois, Esq MD, TCD, of Brighton, second son of Daniel Delacherois, Esq, MA, TCD, DL, JP, born 20th January 1861, married 7th January 1893 and died sp 1st June 1901 at Sandford near Bristol, from a carriage accident, aged 40 [The blank spaces were never filled in] In memory of the members of the family of Daniel Delacherois, Esq, DL, JP, who lie buried in the Manor House Vault under the west aisle of this church Daniel Louis De La Cherois, Col 3 Bat RI Rifles, formerly Lieut 4 Q0 Hussars, eldest son of D De La Cherois DL, born 7 June 1855, died 26 Nov 1909 Elizabeth Mary Angelica De La Cherois, eldest daughter of D De La Cherois, DL, born 3 Feb 1857, died 29 March 1910 Helen Vaughan HAMILTON, wife of Edwin, MA, daughter of Daniel De La Cherois, DL, born 2 Dec 1859, died Nov 6 1911 Catherine Charlotte De Lacherois, daughter of J McCance BLIZARD and dearly loved wife of Geo L De Lacherois, born 4 Aug 1888, died 17 May 1922 Charles Hutcheson De Lacherois, 4th son of Daniel De Lacherois DL, born 18th Dec 1867, died 28th Sept 1933, George Leslie De Lacherois, DL, JP, 3rd son of Daniel De Lacherois, DL, born 31st Oct 1865, died 12th May 1948 In memory of the members of the family of Daniel Delacherois, Esq, DL, JP, who lie buried in the Manor House vault under the west aisle of this church Edmund Normal LESLIE dearly loved husband of Mary De Lacherois, born 7th August 1859, died 16th July 1930 Mary Louise, third daughter of Daniel De Lacherois born 13th Feb 1863, devoted wife of E N Leslie, died 16th June 1949.\n\nEdmund Bourjanval Delacherois’ death is reported as follows in the Belfast News Letter of Monday, June 3, 1901:\n\nMuch regret is felt in Donaghadee and neighbourhood at the sad intelligence of the lamented death of young Dr Delacherois, second son of Mr Daniel Delacherois, D.L., County Down, who died on the 1st inst., from injuries received from being thrown from a trap while driving with his brother, whom he was visiting, at Sandford, Somerset, England.
