Live coding is a 21st-century creative process for making music with computer technology. The first well-documented literature on live coding was published around 2003; however, its techniques and principles – mapping numerical values to sound – are far older than the 21st century, even reaching back into the Classical music era and the composer W. A. Mozart, whose technology was the die, not a digital computer.

Live coding involves an analytical mindset, asking the composer/performer to problem solve by arranging numerical values (integers, floats) and text variables (symbols) following the rules of syntax of a computer programming language. Numerous languages exist. Integra Contemporary & Electroacoustics predominantly uses the language TidalCycles.

First and foremost, the composer/performer learns musical techniques and principles specifically pertaining to rhythm and sound colour (timbre); melody and harmony are equally important, but beginning to live code usually entails leaning about the power of rhythm, firstly.

Live coding is a transferrable skill in that the problem solving inherent in writing code, which makes music, is applicable to coding for other non-musical, non-artistic, disciplines (e.g., coding in computer science and for software development).

Normally, live coding is a mixed-media experience with video. Artists may display computer code or perform to a unique visual/video art piece. ICE Ensemble also uses live video gameplay in the silent film tradition of improvising to a cinematic work.

Coding, or scripting, or hacking…these are all part of the 21st-century musician’s – often free – toolkit.
