What To Look For When Hiring C++ Developers

Like all types of roles, there are certain skill sets you need to be on the lookout for to ensure you find the best candidate for the C++ application development project you have. In this part, letâs talk about what those skills are and some ideal developer experience.

C++ Developer Standard Skills To Require

While C++ developers have different skill levels, each candidate you consider hiring should at least have these basic skills:

Mastery of the C++ algorithms, libraries, and containers

Good knowledge of C++ quality and performance metrics

Good knowledge of dynamic polymorphism, memory management, as well as other C++ templates

Excellent understanding of real-time environments, C++ standards, library functions, and low-level primitives

After considering the skills, letâs now move over to your choices when it comes to the employment choices of the C++ developers youâre going to hire.

C++ Developers Hiring Options And Employment Types

Knowing your options when in these areas will also help you get a good idea of how much you need to spend and how you can maximize the value of your money. Some projects need to be worked from scratch while others need further development.

Some software projects would require close physical monitoring while others can be done remotely given that constant progress reports are provided. So now letâs look at your choices.

C++ Developer Hiring Options

A. Local Talent

Without an elaborate introduction, this hiring option is quite self-explanatory. With this hiring model, you tap into the local tech talent pools. You use local job boards to find qualified candidates located in the same place as you are.

In addition, you can also explore headhunting companies or ask for assistance from your HR department to find local tech talents. For this hiring model, you can also consider checking out hackathons or local tech conferences. This is the best if you want to hire a C++ developer to work on-premise.

B. Nearshore And Offshore C++ Programmers

If you feel that scouting for local talents is limiting your chances of finding the best-fit C++ developer candidates to choose from, you can also find talents nearshore and offshore. Nearshore hiring is when you look for potential C++ developers to work within a farther area but on the same continent or in a similar time zone.

Nearshore C++ developers are best when you want to limit geographical barriers. By working with someone on the same continent, theyâll likely have the same language and culture. Additionally finding C++ talents in a similar time zone will allow for easier and faster turnaround of information and project updates.

Another option you have are offshore C++ developers. This allows you to take advantage of the expertise of C++ developers in other continents, especially if theyâre well-known to be experts in certain areas of C++ software development.

Now letâs move over to employment types.

C++ Developers Employment Types

For employment types, you have 4 options to choose from in-house development, freelancing, staff augmentation, and outsourcing.

1. In-house Development

In-house development is an employment model similar to every 9-5 job. With this employment type, you create a permanent employment contract for your hired C++ developer, in most cases, working as a full-time employee for your company.

If the C++ developer youâre going to hire will be part of your core development team and you need them to work in the office, this is the best solution to go for. This can be on the expensive end though. Youâll have to pay a monthly developer salary and provide statutory benefits as well as office space and equipment theyâll need to get the job done on-premise.

However, if the software development is an ongoing project, there wonât be as big of a concern especially since you can monitor the software engineer and the project closer.

2. Freelancing

Hiring a C++ developer in a freelancing term is best if the job is on a per-project basis, in other words, short-term or temporary. This is a good option if the role of the hired C++ developer will be to handle minor features, fix bugs, or work on some application or web development upgrades.

The main benefit of this type of employment type is that youâll only pay the C++ developer when the project or task is finished, making it more cost-effective. The downside is that itâs not the safest employment model. Itâs prone to delays and project cancellations that will mean additional costs for you if it happens. Hence, itâs best for quick projects or minor problem-solving jobs.

3. Staff Augmentation

Like the previous employment model, staff augmentation is best for short-term or temporary software development projects. In most cases, you wonât have to find the right developers yourself.

Youâll just have to tap a development company like us at Aloa and weâll present you with top-tier vetted developers to do the job while still giving you the free reign to make the final decision of who to hire after meeting with each recommended candidate for interviews.

This employment model is best if you just want an extra pair of hands for a specific period of working on a quick project.

4. Outsourcing

Almost similar to staff augmentation, outsourcing involves tapping development services like us at Aloa. However, with this, you hire a dedicated team and outsource the whole development project to this set of hired C++ developers.

In most cases with this employment type, youâll be hiring designers, front-end and back-end developers, as well as QA engineers, and an outsourcing manager. This employment type is best if you want the heavy load of software development off your shoulders especially if itâs not in line with your expertise.

By hiring a whole development team outsourcing, you wonât have to worry about project management and progress. At Aloa, we even provide you with a custom project management tool so youâll get updates along with other stakeholders on how the project is going.

How Much Does It Cost To Hire A C++ Developer?

The rates of C++ developers vary because of many factors like location, experience, expertise, and market condition. On average, a C++ developer in the United States will earn $108,820/year.

Hire an experienced C++ developer and the project will run and get done efficiently but at a more costly rate. For ballpark rates based on expertise, hereâs how much you can pay each C++ developer:

Beginner- $3/hour

Intermediate- $15/hour

Advanced- $150/hour

Of course, if your project is simple, you can hire a beginner. But for many complex software projects, youâll have to choose between Intermediate or Advanced C++ developers.

Additionally, here are ballpark rates of how much you can pay C++ developers in different locations:

North America: $7,400/month or $89,000/year

Latin America: $1,500/month or $19,000/year

Germany: $5,000/month or $60,000/year

United Kingdom: $4,800/month or $58,000/year

Bulgaria: $2,000/month or $24,000/year

Ukraine: $2,400/month or $29,000/year

India: $833/month or $10,000/year

Creating A C++ Developer Job Post

A job post will make it easier for potential C++ developers to gauge if theyâre the right fit or not. Only those who feel qualified will try to apply and thus minimizing your time filtering out candidates who donât fit the criteria.

In a job post, you will include:

Job post title: describe the role of the C++ developer

Brief job description: include the scope of work, project length, background, and budget

Brief company background (to explain what they will be about)

Job responsibilities: include what the main task is and what the day-to-day dynamics will be for the C++ developer

Requirements and qualifications: include required hard and soft skills and experiences

Hiring and employment model preferred

After getting a shortlist of qualified applicants, you can then schedule a call with them to discuss their background and skills better.
