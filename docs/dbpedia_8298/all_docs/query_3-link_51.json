In this part, letâs talk about what those skills are and some ideal developer experience.\n\nC++ Developer Standard Skills To Require\n\nWhile C++ developers have different skill levels, each candidate you consider hiring should at least have these basic skills:\n\nMastery of the C++ algorithms, libraries, and containers\n\nGood knowledge of C++ quality and performance metrics\n\nGood knowledge of dynamic polymorphism, memory management, as well as other C++ templates\n\nExcellent understanding of real-time environments, C++ standards, library functions, and low-level primitives\n\nC++ Developer Standard Experience To Require\n\nSkills need to be put into practice to scale expertise. When it comes to hiring C++ developers, here is what youâre candidates should have experience on:\n\nC tools\n\nPointer arithmetic\n\nOperating systems\n\nStatic code analysis tools\n\nThe Boost and Qt libraries\n\nObject-oriented programming\n\nWhat composes undefined behavior\n\nCommercial, enterprise, and open-source software projects\n\nDebugging tools like Valgrind and undefined behavior analyzer\n\nDatabase, programming environments, data structures, and compilers\n\nThe reality is, that each project has its complexity. Basic and straightforward projects can be done by Junior C++ developers while elaborate software projects need the expertise of Senior C++ developers. After identifying how sophisticated the project is, you can now decide whether to go for a junior or a senior C++ developer. Hereâs what you can list down as prerequisites for these software developers.\n\nJunior C++ Developer Skills Requirements\n\n0-3 years of experience\n\nA bachelorâs degree in computer science\n\nGood knowledge of writing C, C++, and Unix\n\nGood understanding of database administration\n\nComprehends modern software configuration management\n\nComprehends modern software design and development methodologies\n\nGood understanding of the SQL Server and Oracle (RDBMS databases)\n\nSenior C++ Developer Skill Requirements\n\n4-6 years of experience\n\nExceptional RDBMS expertise\n\nWell-versed in agile development\n\nA masterâs degree in computer science\n\nAdvanced and efficient debugging skills\n\nCan define security and quality standards\n\nHas all the skills of a junior C++ developer\n\nExceptional C, C++, and Unix code-writing skills\n\nExceptional knowledge of database administration\n\nImproved knowledge of modern SCM, methodologies, and testing tools\n\nExperience with Eclipse, Visual Studio, or other integrated application development environments\n\nCan work with C++ programming tools and keeps up to date with new C++ application tools to maintain code quality\n\nAfter considering the skills, letâs now move over to your choices when it comes to the employment choices of the C++ developers youâre going to hire.\n\nC++ Developers Hiring Options And Employment Types\n\nKnowing your options when in these areas will also help you get a good idea of how much you need to spend and how you can maximize the value of your money. Some projects need to be worked from scratch while others need further development.\n\nSome software projects would require close physical monitoring while others can be done remotely given that constant progress reports are provided. So now letâs look at your choices.\n\nC++ Developer Hiring Options\n\nA. Local Talent\n\nWithout an elaborate introduction, this hiring option is quite self-explanatory. With this hiring model, you tap into the local tech talent pools. You use local job boards to find qualified candidates located in the same place as you are.\n\nIn addition, you can also explore headhunting companies or ask for assistance from your HR department to find local tech talents. For this hiring model, you can also consider checking out hackathons or local tech conferences. This is the best if you want to hire a C++ developer to work on-premise.\n\nB. Nearshore And Offshore C++ Programmers\n\nIf you feel that scouting for local talents is limiting your chances of finding the best-fit C++ developer candidates to choose from, you can also find talents nearshore and offshore. Nearshore hiring is when you look for potential C++ developers to work within a farther area but on the same continent or in a similar time zone.\n\nNearshore C++ developers are best when you want to limit geographical barriers. By working with someone on the same continent, theyâll likely have the same language and culture. Additionally finding C++ talents in a similar time zone will allow for easier and faster turnaround of information and project updates.\n\nAnother option you have are offshore C++ developers. This allows you to take advantage of the expertise of C++ developers in other continents, especially if theyâre well-known to be experts in certain areas of C++ software development.\n\nNow letâs move over to employment types.\n\nC++ Developers Employment Types\n\nFor employment types, you have 4 options to choose from in-house development, freelancing, staff augmentation, and outsourcing.\n\n1. In-house Development\n\nIn-house development is an employment model similar to every 9-5 job. With this employment type, you create a permanent employment contract for your hired C++ developer, in most cases, working as a full-time employee for your company.\n\nIf the C++ developer youâre going to hire will be part of your core development team and you need them to work in the office, this is the best solution to go for. This can be on the expensive end though. Youâll have to pay a monthly developer salary and provide statutory benefits as well as office space and equipment theyâll need to get the job done on-premise.\n\nHowever, if the software development is an ongoing project, there wonât be as big of a concern especially since you can monitor the software engineer and the project closer.\n\n2. Freelancing\n\nHiring a C++ developer in a freelancing term is best if the job is on a per-project basis, in other words, short-term or temporary. This is a good option if the role of the hired C++ developer will be to handle minor features, fix bugs, or work on some application or web development upgrades.\n\nThe main benefit of this type of employment type is that youâll only pay the C++ developer when the project or task is finished, making it more cost-effective. The downside is that itâs not the safest employment model. Itâs prone to delays and project cancellations that will mean additional costs for you if it happens. Hence, itâs best for quick projects or minor problem-solving jobs.\n\n3. Staff Augmentation\n\nLike the previous employment model, staff augmentation is best for short-term or temporary software development projects. In most cases, you wonât have to find the right developers yourself.\n\nYouâll just have to tap a development company like us at Aloa and weâll present you with top-tier vetted developers to do the job while still giving you the free reign to make the final decision of who to hire after meeting with each recommended candidate for interviews.\n\nThis employment model is best if you just want an extra pair of hands for a specific period of working on a quick project.\n\n4. Outsourcing\n\nAlmost similar to staff augmentation, outsourcing involves tapping development services like us at Aloa. However, with this, you hire a dedicated team and outsource the whole development project to this set of hired C++ developers.\n\nIn most cases with this employment type, youâll be hiring designers, front-end and back-end developers, as well as QA engineers, and an outsourcing manager. This employment type is best if you want the heavy load of software development off your shoulders especially if itâs not in line with your expertise.\n\nBy hiring a whole development team outsourcing, you wonât have to worry about project management and progress. At Aloa, we even provide you with a custom project management tool so youâll get updates along with other stakeholders on how the project is going.\n\nHow Much Does It Cost To Hire A C++ Developer?\n\nThe rates of C++ developers vary because of many factors like location, experience, expertise, and market condition. On average, a C++ developer in the United States will earn $108,820/year.\n\nHire an experienced C++ developer and the project will run and get done efficiently but at a more costly rate. For ballpark rates based on expertise, hereâs how much you can pay each C++ developer:\n\nBeginner- $3/hour\n\nIntermediate- $15/hour\n\nAdvanced- $150/hour\n\nOf course, if your project is simple, you can hire a beginner. But for many complex software projects, youâll have to choose between Intermediate or Advanced C++ developers.\n\nAdditionally, here are ballpark rates of how much you can pay C++ developers in different locations:\n\nNorth America: $7,400/month or $89,000/year\n\nLatin America: $1,500/month or $19,000/year\n\nGermany: $5,000/month or $60,000/year\n\nUnited Kingdom: $4,800/month or $58,000/year\n\nBulgaria: $2,000/month or $24,000/year\n\nUkraine: $2,400/month or $29,000/year\n\nIndia: $833/month or $10,000/year\n\nCreating A C++ Developer Job Post\n\nA job post will make it easier for potential C++ developers to gauge if theyâre the right fit or not. Only those who feel qualified will try to apply and thus minimizing your time filtering out candidates who donât fit the criteria.\n\nIn a job post, you will include:\n\nJob post title: describe the role of the C++ developer\n\nBrief job description: include the scope of work, project length, background, and budget\n\nBrief company background (to explain what they will be about)\n\nJob responsibilities: include what the main task is and what the day-to-day dynamics will be for the C++ developer\n\nRequirements and qualifications: include required hard and soft skills and experiences\n\nHiring and employment model preferred\n\nAfter getting a shortlist of qualified applicants, you can then schedule a call with them to discuss their background and skills better.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe search for a C++ developer can be a challenging task, but it's a necessary one.
