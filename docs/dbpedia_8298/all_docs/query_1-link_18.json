        "text": "Cross-platform app development for embedded systems\n\nCross-platform toolkits allow developers to build software products for multiple platforms. The task of specialists is to adapt one application to different operating systems.\n\nCross-platform applications have some undeniable advantages in comparison to native ones:\n\nIt is a more affordable design.\n\nOne code for multiple platforms, but each assembly will result in separate executable files;\n\nincreased development speed.\n\nDifferent applications, such as native ones, look and behave differently on different operating systems.\n\nIt is a simpler realization.\n\nDevelopers use frameworks - special tools and libraries for quick application design. Frameworks may have compilers, code libraries, and APIs for creating software.\n\nThis article talks about solutions for embedded systems running on Linux/Unix, Windows, and Android.\n\nAbout Qt and C++\n\nToday we would like to talk about the Qt framework, which is great for creating cross-platform applications for embedded systems. Embedded software is mostly written in C/C++.\n\nC and C++ have very valuable functional and structural paradigms, and C++ extends these paradigms. It makes C++ powerful enough to build abstractions of any order.\n\nCreating a GUI in C++ offers a lot of benefits to the designer since C++ supports object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP makes the process of creating and testing an application faster, easier, and safer. The strength of C++ is not only in its support for object-oriented programming. C++ source code on compilation provides non-portable object code. So, C++ supports the WOCA (Write Once, Compile Anywhere) principle.\n\nQt is a C++ toolkit for graphical user interface (GUI) and application development. It is appropriate for embedded systems both with and without a UI. Qt supports various platforms, including mobile (Android, iOS), desktop (Windows, Linux, macOS), and embedded (Embedded Linux, Embedded Android, Windows Embedded, QNX, etc.) platforms. The Qt framework has also been successfully used for HMI development.\n\nQt was developed by Norwegian programmers in the early 1990s. It is now being developed by The Qt Company and The Qt Project as a union of companies and individuals working to promote Qt. The Qt Project follows the open-source governance philosophy, and all members can take part in the decision-making process aimed at improving the framework.\n\nLicense\n\nQt can be obtained under commercial and open-source licenses. You may need to get a commercial license when your project is big enough and you have to protect your interests. When you use a commercial license, you are allowed to distribute Qt libraries in binary form only with the application. Qt licensing costs depend on your business goals.\n\nIf your project involves an open-source distribution or no external distribution at all, then an open-source license will suit you. It could be an LGPL3, GPL2, or GPLv3 open-source license.\n\nQt instruments for embedded platforms\n\nUseful modules make this framework one of the most convenient for cross-platform application design. Qt with C++ provides the specialized instruments required to design, develop, and set up applications on embedded platforms. Let’s list a few tools.\n\nQt comes with an integrated development environment (IDE) called Qt Creator. This IDE simplifies GUI application operation or modification. Qt Creator is applied to building software in C++, QML, and JavaScript.\n\nBesides, you may use other IDEs as well.\n\nQt Designer is the original built-in GUI designer. However, it can be used as an independent tool.\n\nQt Design Studio is a pared-down version of Qt Creator. It offers a set of 2D/3D instruments for building user interfaces, user experiences, and human-machine interfaces. Qt Design Studio allows designers and developers to increase the level of communication by working in one framework with one common language.\n\nQML, which is Qt's declarative user interface language, enables developers to easily create user interfaces at great speed. UI elements written in QML can be integrated with logic written in C++. Also, QML provides a very convenient way to design UIs for touch screens.\n\nQt for Microcontrollers 2.0 provides developers with a complete graphical environment and all the necessary tools to successfully design, develop, and deploy GUIs on microcontrollers. The use of Qt products makes it possible to run applications both on real-time operating systems (RTOSs) and on bare metal.\n\nQt offers the Automotive Suite software modules and tools for building in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems. This set has a built-in development environment as well as tools for developing user interfaces, testing, and debugging applications. The Automotive Suite has got the Qt Application Manager, which provides an API for implementing the user interface and application logic independently. It also offers a high-level API to make UI system development easier. The Qt GENIVI Extras module is responsible for the compatibility of the resulting product with the GENIVI automotive platform architecture. Neptune 3 UI (the Reference UI version) aims to develop a user interface for Qt in automotive infotainment (IVI) systems. The Automotive Suite comes with tools such as Qt Design Studio, Qt 3D Studio, Qt Creator Deployment, and several others to help programmers create, install, maintain, and debug a system.\n\nMiddleware-related components such as APIs, backends, and services can be developed using the tools and APIs provided by the Qt Interface Framework module.\n\nThe Qt Safe Renderer module provides a UI rendering element that pulls apart crucial interpretations from other parts of the system. This approach ensures that safety-relevant user interface elements are displayed in the event of failures or abnormal situations.\n\nQt and C++ for Embedded Devices\n\nMost embedded systems are built in C/C++.\n\nWhy is C++ so well suited for embedded development?\n\nThis programming language sits between higher-level software and hardware. Developers can access and control hardware while retaining the benefits of a high-level language.\n\nThe high stability of C++ makes it efficient for hardware since programs written in C++ can run for a very long time. Leave well enough alone, as the saying goes.\n\nC++ is processor-independent.\n\nC++ enables developers to use abstractions with functional and cost-effectiveness.\n\nThe C++ data structure is built on algorithms, so it is well suited to the challenges that arise when developing embedded systems.\n\nThe Qt framework multiplies the benefits of C++ through its flexibility, cross-platform support, and the variety of libraries it offers.\n\nTo be fair, we should note some of the obstacles that arise when working in C++:\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles for non-C++ developers is the language's strictness, verbosity, and complexity. C++ is quite difficult to learn.\n\nThe second challenge stems from the first: maintaining the codebase can be rather hard.\n\nC++ may not be flexible enough for web technologies.\n\nQt developers create embedded systems with intuitive user interfaces, secure and scalable technology, Bluetooth, and Internet connectivity. It could be Qt software for touch screens of various sizes and resolutions, ATMs, in-flight and in-car entertainment, and thousands of other types of embedded systems. Qt is ideal for embedded device applications with or without a GUI. This framework is needed if you have to create a GUI application that can run on another platform. Besides, it lets you develop high-performance applications faster.\n\nThere's no need for the entire development team to be proficient in C++. Non-C++ programmers can also contribute to projects using QML, which improves performance.\n\nQt C++ embedded systems run on Linux, Windows, and RTOSs.\n\nSome of the simplest systems operate autonomously, but most devices are linked up with the cloud. They receive information from numerous sensors about what is happening outside. Complicated embedded systems execute sensor data estimation, image recognition, or speech recognition. Qt offers a large number of high-level APIs for embedded devices. For example, the Qt Location API and the Qt Sensors API help get information related to the device’s position and location.\n\nSystems with less powerful SoCs can delegate some tasks to cloud applications. The controllers check and adjust many parameters inside the device (for example, the water temperature in the washing machine or the monitor screen brightness) and transmit the data to the control center.\n\nReasons for Choosing Qt\n\nIntegra Sources has developed expertise in creating cross-platform applications using Qt.\n\nLet's list some of the qualities of Qt that influenced our decision to choose it.\n\nThe key advantage of Qt is the ability to apply the same code to different desktop environments, mobile devices, and embedded devices.\n\nBoth open licenses and commercial licenses are available. Integra Sources usually selects an open-source license for projects. Yet, the application design is also available under a Qt commercial license at the client’s request.\n\nDetailed API documentation, examples, training, technical support, and a large community make Qt very attractive.\n\nYou are free to create software in the language you prefer. There are many bindings to Qt for Python, Java, PHP, Go, etc.\n\nC++ is one of the most widely used embedded software languages.\n\nThe Qt Creator IDE, with its build system and rich plugin architecture, is fast and responsive.\n\nIntegra Sources has got a team of experts writing programs in C++, including for embedded systems. We find Qt to be very handy.\n\nProjects we did with Qt\n\nThe number of projects in which we use this framework is constantly growing. Let's talk about the latest tasks.\n\nOur responsibility for one of the projects was to develop an Android application for debugging and configuring the customer's device. The device was a reel with cylinder bottles equipped with a spray system. It was controlled by the customer’s protocol via BLE. The technology would be used in the marketing and entertainment industries.\n\nIntegra Sources’ developers had to create an application that could connect to one or more devices, send commands, and receive responses. Many commands had custom parameters, so the application required different input fields. Also, a video player had to be implemented. As soon as the player reached a certain timestamp, the application had to send a command to the device to spray a certain fragrance.\n\nFor the application implementation, we chose the C++/Qt/QML stack. In addition, Java code was used. Qt made it possible to create an Android application with all the necessary functions very quickly. The Qt Connectivity module has speeded up the development of the BLE part by providing ready-made Bluetooth solutions. Using the Qt Multimedia module, our specialists created a video player with a range of features.\n\nThe objective of another project was to create a device with sensors for measuring the distance to obstacles and to build a mobile application for interacting with the devices. The radar module was supposed to transmit a point cloud over BLE. The Orange Pi microcomputer had to transmit the image from the CSI camera using the RTSP (Real-time Streaming Protocol) via Wi-Fi to the Android tablet. We intended to use Qt for building Android applications.\n\nSignificant difficulties that arose during the implementation of the project required revision. Therefore, our developers decided to replace the Orange Pi with the Raspberry Pi for the correct interaction with the camera and Bluetooth. The new idea was to create a tablet Wi-Fi hotspot with a specific SSID and a password. When the sensor (the ATPS module) detects a Wi-Fi network with the selected SSID, it should automatically connect to the network. The mobile app should transmit its IP address to the device via BLE. The video stream from the camera had to be passed via RTSP. We decided to transmit sensor data as well as information messages via a TCP connection. While developing the client-side in Python, we faced the problem of low performance. The Qt framework helped solve this issue.\n\nOur Qt developers created an embedded application that could work with both BLE and TCP without delays in the data processing. Qt enabled us to use the Wiring Pi library to communicate with an external buzzer and an I2C LED module.\n\nThe lead time for the project was prolonged due to identified obstacles. Having chosen Qt for the client part of the project, our developers created a rather complex application in a short time. It allowed us to reduce the backlog. You can learn more about using the QT framework to develop BLE-enabled cross-platform applications by reading the article on our blog.\n\nOne of our projects using Qt was connected to agriculture. Our specialists had the task of developing a mobile application for iOS and Windows to interact with various microcontrollers and sensors.\n\nThus, microcontrollers with sensors were installed on agricultural machines to collect telemetric indicators. The application should process the collected data in real-time. Microcontrollers installed in the warehouse turned on the hot air supply and disinfectant gas spray, while also monitoring temperature and humidity. The microcontrollers should communicate with the application via Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAnother task of the application was to gather data from temperature sensors installed in the warehouse.\n\nOur developers created an application using Qt. It allowed them to shorten lead times and save the client money. The customer was satisfied with the work done. Integra Sources is eagerly looking forward to our further collaboration.\n\nWorking with Qt and C++, we encountered some drawbacks (fortunately, all of them turned out to be surmountable). Here they are:\n\nCreating applications in C++ is time-consuming.\n\nThe speed of the Qt GUI is slow.\n\nThe GUI internalization (I18N) is far from perfect.\n\nCross-compilation may require additional steps to be taken.\n\nIn general, our team has positive impressions of working with the framework. With Qt, developers save time, and customers save money by getting efficient cross-platform applications.\n\nOther multi-platform solutions as alternatives to Qt\n\nDebates among programmers about the best framework will never end. Each developer gives his/her arguments in favor of a particular platform, and everyone could be right. The choice of one structure or another depends on the project’s size and goal. It also depends on the developer’s experience, competence, and the customer’s wishes.\n\nWe'll take a look at Qt-like solutions and highlight what each of them is good for.\n\n1. .NET, or dotNet, is a development platform made by Microsoft. The platform's main characteristics are as follows:\n\nfree and open-source software\n\nMicrosoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X are all supported.\n\nC #, F #, and Visual Basic are all supported languages;\n\nVisual Studio Client\n\nIt has its own community.\n\n.Net is a modular and cross-platform solution based on the .Net Framework. Each of its modules can be upgraded individually. Various realizations of dotNet help run its code on different platforms.\n\nThis structure has a wide variety of compilers, libraries, and APIs for developing and compiling mobile and game applications with ease.\n\nThe DotNet platform is good for re-designing applications and making them suitable for the needs of the company.\n\n2. The .NET nanoFramework is a free and open-source structure based on .NET for small embedded devices. The .NET nanoFramework combines flexibility, high functionality, and high performance, blurring the line between the desktop developer and the embedded system developer.\n\n3. Xamarin is a popular tool for cross-platform mobile application development based on the concept of “Write once, Run anywhere” (WORA). According to Microsoft, “Xamarin extends the .NET developer platform with tools and libraries specifically for building apps for Android, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, macOS, and Windows.”\n\nKey elements of Xamarin:\n\nfree and open-source software;\n\nbased on the .Net;\n\nC# is used;\n\ntools that are natively compiled;\n\nThe Xamarin Universal Library and Planet Xamarin projects provide developers with important information and useful resources.\n\n4. Flutter is a framework for GUI application development released by Google in 2017. It supports the WORA principle.\n\nThe main features of the structure are\n\nPlatforms such as Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, and others are all supported.\n\nDart support;\n\nIt's compatible with IDEs like Eclipse, Android Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Intellij.\n\ndesign-specific widgets.\n\nFlutter allows developers to build applications faster and more efficiently. It interacts directly with machine code, exhibiting impressive performance.\n\n5. Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is a platform-independent and object-oriented programming (OOP) language. All Java frameworks support the WORA concept, meaning that compiled code is able to run on all Java platforms.\n\nThe platform provided by Java, in addition to the language itself, includes code libraries and frameworks, which are very popular among developers.\n\nYou can choose Java to develop scalable, handy, and downloadable embedded systems applications. This language is secure due to its support for encrypting sensitive information and is suitable for GUI projects with multiple screens.\n\nOn the other hand, Java is complex, and its efficiency is not very high in comparison to other languages.\n\n6. You can use GTK+ for creating GUI programs.\n\nThe main features of the widget toolkit are:\n\nopen-source (under the LGPL license);\n\nmulti-platform;\n\nC is the language used.\n\nThere are C++, dotNet, and Python bindings available.\n\nGood support for powerful themes;\n\ncompatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n\nGTK has so many obvious shortcomings, such as poor backward compatibility in main updates, a lack of cross-platform support, and an absence of community.\n\n7. A Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) is a cross-platform software development library. It provides a unified programming interface for graphics, audio, and input devices across a wide variety of platforms. Developed with the help of SDL, multimedia applications can run on Android, Linux, Windows, macOS, and iOS.\n\nThe main features of SDL are:\n\nopen-source (under the zlib license);\n\nWritten in C, C++, or Objective-C depending on the target platform;\n\nThere are language bindings for other languages available as well.\n\nSupport for multiple windows\n\n2D graphics that are hardware-accelerated\n\nIt is actively used for cross-platform multimedia programs (mainly games).\n\nGUI frameworks in C++\n\nThe list of C++ high-level widget toolkits seems to be impressive, but not all of them are cross-platform. Nevertheless, there are plenty of solutions similar to Qt technology. Let's compare them with Qt in usability and functionality.\n\nwxWidgets allows developers to create applications for Linux, Windows, and some other environments.\n\nAdvantages of wxWidgets:\n\nopen-source;\n\nmature, but rather speedy;\n\nuses native widgets (where possible) to ensure a natural look and feel.\n\nIt has a very convenient wxCrafter designer.\n\nDrawbacks to wxWidgets:\n\nIt is difficult to set up.\n\nFLTK (Fast Light Toolkit) is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX/Linux, Microsoft, and Windows. FLTK supports 3D graphics. The toolkit is available under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) with some exceptions.\n\nFLTK advantages\n\nlightweight and simple design, and only GUI features.\n\nonline support;\n\nrather fast.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nmakes use of non-native widgets.\n\nIt provides fewer widgets than other platforms.\n\nSupported by Windows, Linux, iOS, macOS, and Android, JUCE is on the list of cross-platform C++ frameworks. JUCE is licensed under the terms of the GPL and ISC licenses (depending on the module). JUCE is free for individuals, startups, and educational institutes.\n\nJUCE advantages\n\na large set of audio functionalities.\n\nlightweight;\n\nIt is less expensive than Qt (paid versions).\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nLack of clear information about the toolkit;\n\nThe free version has restraints.\n\nAnother useful C++ rapid application development platform is Ultimate ++ (U++, or Upp). It contains GUI, SQL, and other libraries and focuses on efficiency. It includes an IDE, called TheIDE, whose interesting features, like the BLITZ-build technology, allow you to boost the rebuilding of C++.\n\nPros of U++:\n\nLinux/Unix, Windows, and macOS support;\n\nIt is simple to apply and learn.\n\nvisual designers for U++ libraries;\n\nA C++ code analyzer\n\nhelpful tutorials, community, and documentation.\n\nU++ has the following drawbacks:\n\nclosed-source software;\n\nonly C++.\n\nThere are a lot of other C++ UI frameworks that may be employed for cross-platform application development. Each of them has loyal users who have accumulated experience in using a particular toolkit.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe IT industry offers us a lot of frameworks for cross-platform application development. It’s impossible to choose the best one. The same task can be solved in different ways based on the knowledge, experience, and capabilities of the developer.\n\nQt is a C++ multiplatform application and GUI framework. Once created with Qt, applications can be compiled on lots of other platforms. Qt is a widget toolkit since it allows us to build software with native-looking GUIs. C++ is one of the most popular languages for embedded devices, and Qt is one of the most popular frameworks among C++ GUI toolkits. It provides designers with all the instruments for software development. Integra Sources has a skilled staff of Qt developers."
