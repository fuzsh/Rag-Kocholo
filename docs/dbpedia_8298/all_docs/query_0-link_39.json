Otherwise, it returns 0 (False). â€¢ In C programming, logical operators are classified into three types such as the logical AND (&&) operator, the logical OR operator (||), and the logical NOT (!) operator.\n\n: ++Example of procedural programming in c #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main() { int i, fact = 1, num; cout << \"Enter any Number: \"; cin >> number; for (i = 1; i <= num; i++) { fact = fact * i; } cout << \"Factorial of \" << num << \" is: \" << fact << endl; return 0; }\n\nStruggling to understand c code output with x++ operations?

Now, why do we have this type of function declaration, int main(void)? We are telling C that, we want a function, that returns an integer, where 0 means the script was executed successfully, 1, if it failed, but we are not going to give you any argument/variable. And in this function, use puts to print a string.
