This course will introduce students to the detailed work of a director from casting through performance. We will examine the step-by-step process of casting, rehearsals, concept building, blocking, story structure and communicating concepts with the artistic team. We also will examine the collaborative relationship between the director and actor. Students will be introduced to set design by using the computer program SketchUp. Students should be prepared to reflect, participate in peer commentary and feedback, engage in discussions as well as be the actors for each other’s scenes. These scenes will only be performed in class. A final project will be to direct a scene from a scripted play on a set that students have imagined and built virtually via SketchUp.\n\nFall Term: 1 credit\n\nHave you ever wanted to write a play? What does it mean to write for the stage? In this course students will learn the art and craft of writing plays and developing new work. Students will participate in a collaborative workshop environment where they will read and analyze each other’s writing and published plays. This is an intensive writing course. Feedback from classmates provides an opportunity to learn how to give and receive constructive criticism for the revision process of developing work. Students will study topics including character, dialogue, narrative structure, audience, and plot as they collaborate with their peers and develop their voices as playwrights and storytellers. A goal of the course is for students to have developed a portfolio of various works. This course is a prerequisite for being a playwright for the Winter Term one-act play festival.\n\nWinter Term: 1 credit\n\nHave you ever wondered why Shakespeare is still performed today? Shakespeare is prevalent all over the world as literature, drama, pop culture, and cultural capital; how and why we perform Shakespeare is both artistic and political. This course will prepare students to analyze, interpret, and perform Shakespeare’s works as close readers, critical thinkers, and creative actors. We also will look at theatrical practices, such as casting and directing, and critically analyze what it means to perform and produce Shakespeare today. Throughout the term, students will read plays together as a class and learn multiple approaches to performing Shakespeare with monologues and scenes. Students should be prepared to perform and engage with discussion.\n\nSpring Term: 1 credit\n\nThis course is a continuation of Shakespeare in Performance I with new plays and new themes, but the Winter Term course is not a prerequisite for this class. Why do Shakespeare’s plays continue to be produced and reimagined for modern audiences? Every production of Shakespeare transforms the original play in some way. What is considered “traditional,” “nontraditional,” or “modern” about a Shakespeare production is a debate for all who perform and practice Shakespeare today. This course will continue to explore Shakespeare through close text analysis and performance. We will watch and critically analyze modern productions and reimaginings of Shakespeare. Students will learn how to analyze, interpret and perform Shakespeare’s works as close readers and imaginative actors using critical perspectives. Reading, presenting and discussions of the plays, scenes and monologues will be a major part of this course.\n\nFall Term: 1 credit\n\nPrerequisite: Two years previous acting training or permission of the Director of Theater\n\nAudition Technique is designed for the intermediate to advanced student.

An ideal class for those who like acting and other forms of art as well. You may take this course more than once.\n\nFull Year: 6 credits (2 credits per term)\n\nHumanities III introduces students to what will be a four-year experience that expects collaboration, student-centered learning and richly interactive discussions. A key aspect of this program is its focus on a very wide range of “texts,” which might include a novel, a movie, a poem, a map, an African mask, a vase from Ancient Greece, a historical ruler, a painting, a propaganda poster and so on. We teach students to “read” such texts and to become adept at making significant connections between them. We seek to inspire in students an appreciation for the way in which terms such as man, woman, nature, God and city differ in societies, and are not simple words at all. We also use the idea of “self as text” to encourage students’ personal understanding of their own complex cultures and an appreciative curiosity about the cultures of each other. We focus on the individual, exploring the archetype of the “hero’s journey.” We look at the societies that human beings create, and ask what happens when we live together. We explore questions of power, leadership and the place of the individual in the society. We examine how different societies and cultures have interacted and come into conflict (or, less frequently, into cooperation) across history and we pay attention to the experience of individuals in times of change and turmoil — what happens when humans are caught within a society in conflict?\n\nThroughout their studies, students continuously develop their critical and creative thinking skills through close reading, writing, discussion and presentations. Students work in a variety of other creative media throughout the year, including creating plays, movies and more.\n\nFull Year: 6 credits (2 credits per term)\n\nIn Humanities IV, students explore the complex relationship between individuals and their communities through a varied and integrated disciplinary approach. Building on the conception of the self considered in Humanities III and anticipating the examination of the forces and beliefs shaping our modern world studied in Humanities V, Humanities IV investigates why individuals choose to come together in community, how they cope with tension and change and how communities develop and evolve.\n\nConsidering specific periods in American history, students explore primary and secondary texts, such as historical documents, artwork and literature. Discussion and activity-driven classes encourage students to develop a curiosity about the United States, develop their own perspectives and value others’ viewpoints. Students practice writing as a critical means of self-expression with emphasis on analytical and creative writing. Varied assessments foster skill building that includes critical reading, research, visual image analysis and public speaking. A major research project examining some aspect of American history or culture is conducted in the Spring Term.\n\nFull Year: 6 credits (2 credits per term)\n\nIn Humanities V, students engage in a rich interdisciplinary study of the human experience in the modern world. Extending the studies of self and community explored in Humanities III and IV, Humanities V examines the forces and ideologies that have shaped the modern world, the conflicts that arise between differing ideologies and the challenges and responsibilities of living in the 21st century. Students explore connections across cultures, timelines, borders and canons in a quest to answer the question, “How, then, shall we live?” Through a close examination of diverse texts, students imaginatively and rigorously recreate the context both informing and informed by these works. Students refine the skill of close reading and develop critical vocabularies for various disciplines. Beyond the expository essay, students engage in a variety of other assessments to develop greater appreciation for and control of the nuances of language and self-expression. Focused on creating a culture of collaborative learning, the teacher models and facilitates the development of critical listening and effective speaking skills. The course culminates in a year-end capstone project of the student’s choice.\n\nFall Term: 1 credit\n\nThe objective of this course is to introduce students to the institutions, processes and actors that comprise the American political system at the national level and engage them in empirical and critical thinking regarding the nature and quality of American democracy. The course begins with an examination of the ways we can systematically examine American politics, and then turns to the structure of American government with an emphasis on the divisions of power between levels and branches of government. We’ll investigate the legislative and executive branches of government, looking specifically at the workings of the Congress, presidency and bureaucracy, and how these institutions engage in policymaking and policy execution. The role of American elections and the combination of forces that lead to policy change also will be examined. We will end the course by considering the American judicial system and its role in our system of government. Current events will be incorporated regularly and used as lenses into the issues we are studying.\n\nFall and Spring Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nThis course is designed to help young writers experiment in order to find an original voice. Students work over the term toward a final portfolio of pieces in several media, which they can revise right up to the end. Offering the opportunity to try out poetry, fiction, personal writing, creative nonfiction and script writing, the course enables students to find their own writing voice. In addition, for Sixth Formers, the course yields interesting material that might be useful for the process of developing college essays, but it will not specifically prepare students for that task. Students are taught how to read texts not in terms of literary analysis but in terms of their usefulness, regularly work-shopping their drafts with the rest of the group and studying new techniques and processes through a variety of assignments. The class also has the chance to work with visiting writers who come to St. Paul’s School as Schlesinger writers-in-residence or Conroy visitors.\n\nFall Term: 1 credit\n\nThe three-fold design of this non-mathematical introduction to economics provides students with an overview of the discipline that can serve as a background for courses in related subjects, a foundation for further study in economics, and a knowledge base for becoming an informed worker, consumer and citizen. While examining briefly the history of economics and some of its seminal thinkers, the course concentrates on understanding basic economic theory (macro and micro), developing a practical knowledge of the workings of principal economic institutions (e.g., the Federal Reserve system, the stock market, the banking sector, etc.), and appreciating the subtleties of national economic policy, especially in light of current economic challenges.\n\nFall Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nThis course is designed to help young writers refine their prose by experimenting with nonfiction essay writing. Students will work over the course of the term reading various models of essay writing by professional writers and exploring their own voices to create clear, concise, engaging prose. For Sixth Formers, the course may generate good material for college essays, although this is not the goal of the course. Some of the various prose models students will examine and write themselves include sharing a narrative, illustrating an idea, explaining a process, comparing and contrasting, using definition, arguing persuasively. Throughout the term students will learn ways to generate ideas, keep an active journal, help one another in regular in-class writing workshops and discover the value of the revision process.\n\nFall Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nMore than two millennia ago, the Greek philosopher Socrates argued that the unexamined life is not worth living. To better examine our lives, he urged us to do philosophy. This course is an introduction to the four major areas of philosophy — logic, epistemology, metaphysics and ethics. We will address questions such as: What is philosophy and how is it done? What is knowledge? Is reality subjective or objective? How does logic help us find truth? Is there such a thing as human nature, and is it good or bad? How should we interact with the natural world? We will read ancient and modern texts (and watch a few contemporary films) to discuss topics such as the nature of identity, the purpose of education and the scope and limit of human reason. The course will create a foundation for students wishing to take other courses in philosophy at SPS or in college.\n\nFall Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nFrom the first instance of censorship in 1690 to yesterday’s news, journalism has been the backbone of American politics and culture. This course explores the beginnings of journalism, the First Amendment and the role of freedom of the press in shaping American democracy. Additionally, the course examines the shifting forms of journalism in recent years and the role of technology and social media, including citizen journalism and fake news. Students will write both analyses of current news coverage and their own narrative journalism. Possible texts include Sacco’s “Journalism,” Daly’s “America: A Narrative History of a Nation’s Journalism,” Gladstone’s “The Influencing Machine” and more.\n\nFall term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nThe Holocaust is a moment in modern history that has been the subject of much historical inquiry as well as artistic creativity. As more time passes since the end of the Holocaust, the experience is not only told by Jewish survivors or their relatives, but also by artists, authors and filmmakers personally disconnected from the Jewish diaspora. What is it that makes the story of the Holocaust so enduring? Is it acceptable to deviate from the historical facts in creative works? In this course we will examine the causes of the Holocaust and the way the experience has been told through film, novels and other creative works across time.\n\nFall Term: 1 credit\n\nThis course offers an introduction to the study of sacred literature, with a focus on selections from the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud, and explores the ways that the authors and early readers of the Hebrew Bible, early rabbinic traditions, and modern readers use scripture to explore theological and ethical questions. In this course, students will learn different methods for reading sacred literature, including source criticism, historical criticism, literary criticism and midrash. Students will be invited to examine the ways that oral and written religious traditions develop and spread and use their own imaginations to wonder about the gaps in sacred narratives. During class discussions, students will practice using sacred literature to make theological and ethical arguments.\n\nFall Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nWilliam Shakespeare is widely acknowledged as a master of the English language and an astute observer of human nature and behavior. This course focuses on the tragic heroes of four great Shakespearean plays: “Hamlet,” “King Lear,” “Macbeth” and “Othello.” Using these plays as a lens, students will examine several important questions about the human condition: What is the nature of good and evil? Why do good people do evil things? Can good triumph over evil? What is the connection between conscience and action? What is the balance between reason and passion? In addition to reading the plays, students will watch both live and filmed productions and write about the content and form of these great masterpieces.\n\nFall Term: 1 credit\n\nThis course will provide students with the opportunity to examine in great detail one of the most important world events of the last 60 years: the conflict in Vietnam. Specific topics such as the life of the “grunt” and turmoil on the homefront will be explored, as will larger questions about the nature of war itself in the second half of the 20th century. In an effort to answer questions about the war as it really was, versus that seen in popular literature and film, the class will consider a broad selection of media, as well as a variety of historical texts and essays. Documentaries and motion pictures to be studied include: “Hearts and Minds,” “The Hanoi Hilton,” “The Green Berets,” “Apocalypse Now,” “Platoon,” “Full Metal Jacket,” “Born on the 4th of July,” “Casualties of War” and others. Works read will include, but are not limited to, excerpts from: Philip Caputo’s “A Rumor of War,” Truong Nhu Tang’s “A Vietcong Memoir,” Tim O’Brien’s “The Things They Carried,” Robert Mason’s “Chickenhawk,” Michael Herr’s “Dispatches,” Stanley Karnow’s “Vietnam: A History,” and a selection of essays from the anthology “Major Problems in the History of the Vietnam War.”\n\nFall or Spring Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course. Satisfies diploma requirement in religious studies.]\n\nThis course examines the interrelationships among religion, race and gender in history and culture. Students develop two specific forms of religious literacy: the ways that religions shape and are shaped by their social/historical contexts; and the ways in which religions are internally diverse. We will think and write critically about the ways that sacred texts, the body and material culture together shape our changing understandings of gender and race; examine the ways that understandings of gender and race influence who has authority within particular religious contexts; engage in literary analysis of sacred texts; and conduct a research project on a topic of students’ own choosing.\n\nWinter Term: 1 credit\n\nIn this course students will study current political issues and trends. We will analyze the partisan divide in the country and how this engenders political division in American government. We will discuss the dynamics, organization and decision-making processes of the American Congress and pay attention to the relationship between legislators and their constituents and legislators and the President. We also will examine the growth of presidential power, the cult of presidential personality and the issue of presidential accountability. Some crucial questions we might address include: What is the relationship between citizens and elected officials? How do the political parties function in terms of decisions made by members of Congress? How is power balanced among the three branches of government? At its heart, this course will be a current events course focusing on issues within the political system of the United States.\n\nWinter Term: 1 credit\n\nThis course focuses on two works by James Joyce, one of the most acclaimed authors of the early 20th century. “Dubliners” is a collection of short stories that combine to give a vivid and challenging portrait of life in Dublin as Joyce perceived and experienced it. “A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man” is Joyce’s fictional presentation of the autobiography of a young writer and is a powerful and artistically important work that helped define the literary movement known as Modernism. Close study of these two works opens up a world of literary imagination and powerful prose that invites students to read deeply, think creatively and write expressively.\n\nWinter Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nBoarding schools are consistently chosen as the setting for novels, short stories and poems. Something about this concentration of teenagers makes for an appealing backdrop to examine the human condition. In this course, students will read literature about boarding schools — such as “A Separate Peace,” by John Knowles, “The Fall of Rome,” by Martha Southgate, and “Black Ice,” by Lorene Cary ’74 — and try to articulate just what it is about the adolescent experience at boarding school that makes this literature so enthralling. Additionally, students will use their own experiences in conjunction with the texts to both broadly explore the utility of boarding schools in a constantly evolving societal landscape and to more narrowly examine St. Paul’s School, its community and its culture.\n\nWinter Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nThe 1960’s is marked as a period of great social and political unrest and change. A generation grew up during this decade questioning the status quo in the interest of collective societal progress. Political conversations evolved to include personal experiences of discrimination and oppression. This course will explore the forces that shaped the decade and examine what it represents to different demographics and for different institutions. St. Paul’s School will be one case study for which we will conduct exploratory research to practice historical research methodologies and further our understanding of how the 1960’s shaped the School and its students, and the legacy the decade left on St. Paul’s School.\n\nWinter Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nThis course surveys the trends and writers of the last 40 years in American fiction, considering, among other things, the ways in which contemporary fiction has emerged out of the traditions studied in Humanities IV and Humanities V. The course focuses on multiple genres, aspects of form in contemporary prose fiction and recurring themes involving individual identity in the conformist culture of contemporary America. Students will leave the course with a sense of some of the many directions taken in contemporary American fiction as well as a desire to read more works by writers whom they have briefly encountered. Authors introduced may include Joseph Heller, Jack Kerouac, Toni Morrison, Julie Otsuka, Kurt Vonnegut and Alice Walker.\n\nWinter Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nIn this course, we will study the craft of the short story. First, we will read a wide selection of works from authors of diverse backgrounds and time periods because, as Joyce Carol Oates says, “Reading is the springboard to writing.” We will explore the power of the story to highlight human emotion. We will take risks in the way we write, the subjects we tackle and the way in which we put ourselves out there to learn our craft and better understand our own voices. Through workshops and multiple drafts, we will develop the skills of constructive criticism to support the writing of peers, as well as the art of re-seeing our own writing through multiple revisions. The course will culminate in the submission of a final portfolio and presentation of the students’ work.\n\nWinter Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nHave you ever wondered why one speech is more successful than another? Is it the writing? Is it the delivery? Is it an “it” factor? In this course you will learn how to write a compelling speech through watching and analyzing famous speeches as well as extensive research, writing and various vocal and presentational techniques that will guide you in writing, creating and presenting a successful speech. Students will study various types of speeches: demonstration, passion, persuasive and informative, while learning how to use technology as tools to aid in their presentations. This is an extensive writing course where students will learn how to use hooks, bookends and various other aspects of speechwriting to aid in the composition, flow and audience attentiveness, understanding and persuasion. Students also will be introduced to techniques that aid in eliminating mannerisms, performance anxiety or other distractions that might weaken presentations.\n\nWinter Term: 1 credit\n\nThis course offers an introduction to the study of sacred literature, with a focus on selections from the New Testament and other non-canonical texts, and explores the ways that the authors of the New Testament, early Jesus followers and modern readers use scripture to explore theological and ethical questions. In this course, students will learn different methods for reading sacred literature and examine the ways that oral and written religious traditions develop and spread. Students will use their own imaginations to ponder the gaps in sacred narratives and practice using sacred literature to make theological and ethical arguments.\n\nWinter Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course. Satisfies the diploma requirement in religious studies.]\n\nScience and religion are arguably the two most influential human forces in the world today. In fact, most people ground their claims about truth and reality, and derive their reasons for action, in one or the other or varying proportions of both. Interestingly, many people take for granted that science and religion are locked in a state of conflict, and that sooner or later one will finish the other off. This course will investigate the historical, logical and philosophical relationships between science and religion. Questions to be addressed include: What makes science scientific, and what makes religion religious? Are science and religion really in conflict, and if so, why? Are they mutually supporting? Can one be both an adherent to modern science and a person of an ancient faith? To what extent is belief in God rational and justifiable, and to what extent does it need to be? What should we think when various religious traditions conflict? What should we think in the face of religious paradoxes such the Problem of Evil and the Problem of Free Will? We will give particular attention to some infamous interactions between science and religion (e.g., the Galileo affair, Darwin’s publishing of “Origin of Species,” the Scopes Monkey trial), trying to discern in each instance what the conflict was fundamentally about. Texts might include: “A Very Short Introduction to Science and Religion” (Dixon); “Dialogue on Good, Evil, and the Existence of God” (Perry); “Contact” (Sagan); and selections from Aquinas, Maimonides, Ibn Rushd, Stephen J. Gould, Richard Dawkins, Alister McGrath, Richard Swinburne, William James and many others.\n\nWinter Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nThis course examines the creative space where religion and science fiction literature meet. Students will conduct an in-depth study of the parables, myths and allegories that humans have told and re-told throughout history as we reflect on the big questions of our lives and consider what futures might be possible. From sacred stories to Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus” to the contemporary work of Ursula Le Guin, Octavia Butler and Ted Chiang, students will read an array of authors and topics to consider how speculative literature has helped, and is helping, project ancient wisdom into the undetermined future.\n\nWinter Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nThis course provides a historical overview of the Second World War so that students may effectively analyze literary works about specific aspects of the conflict. Beginning with an understanding of the Germans’ hatred of the Treaty of Versailles following their defeat in World War I, students will then take a look at the rise of Hitler in the 1930s as well as the growing isolationism in the United States prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. While this course does not review each WWII battle, significant military events (e.g., D-Day) will be studied alongside corollary elements of the war (e.g., Japanese internment; the Holocaust). Using film, oral histories and other primary sources, plus historical analysis written by leading historians, this course aims to spark students’ long-term interest in what Jackson J. Spielvogel asserts “was clearly Hitler’s war.”\n\nSpring Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nWhat is more important: combating climate change or jobs? Should a public policy maximize effectiveness or efficiency? How do we, as an American society, analyze and tackle the tough issues facing our generation? This course is intended as an introduction to how policymakers analyze and craft solutions to issues such as the environment, social justice, welfare policy and more. Over the course of the term, we will consider the fundamental question of why some conditions become problems for the government to solve while other issues are ignored. The goal of this course is for each student to better understand how ideas become policy in the United States and to feel comfortable that they personally have an important role in having their voice heard and shaping solutions to the problems facing the world today.\n\nSpring Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nThis course examines the causes, impact and aftermath of the U.S. Civil War, arguably the most important national event after the American Revolution. Beginning with a brief review of the major political, cultural and ideological differences that led the southern states to secede, the course will move to a historical review of the progress of the war itself, then transition to the examination of narrative fiction about the war. Finally, the course will examine the events of the Reconstruction Era and their impact on the nation. Texts will include historical surveys of the Civil War and Reconstruction, speeches by Abraham Lincoln as well as other government documents, and works of fiction by authors such as Michael Shaara, Shelby Foote, William Faulkner, Thomas Wolfe and others.\n\nSpring Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nCould a utopian society ever exist, and why does a search for the perfect world typically backfire? How do authors use dystopian literature as a form of social commentary on their own societies, and how effective is this form of criticism? How are decades-old social commentaries relevant to our society today? In this course, we will strive to answer these questions as we study the works of Orwell and Atwood, among others. In addition, we will look at the way this genre has evolved with the emergence of several contemporary YA dystopian literature series. Besides novels, short stories and films/TV series also may be used.\n\nSpring Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nMany people have their own story about how and why the Great Recession of the 21st century marks an era of financial and economic instability in America. Writers, economists and historians offer rich insight into the economic and historical uniqueness of this crisis, which still looms large in modern memory. Students will dissect these perspectives using macroeconomic data, historical/economic frameworks, scholarly analyses, documentaries and pop culture literature as we interpret this critical moment in American culture. To build context, we will comparatively analyze the Panic of 1907, the Great Depression and the Great Recession as we make sense of how history informs policy and the present. Guiding questions for this course ask, “How do historians, economists, and cultural commentators preserve the memory of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression?”; “So what?” and “How do these lenses refract what is happening in our own economy?”\n\nSpring Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nWhat and who is a feminist? Who benefits from the historical and contemporary feminist revolution? What is my own feminist philosophy? This course will look at the rise of feminist movements throughout history and across continents and the evolution of the movement to the contemporary landscape, analyze accompanying feminist literature both historical and contemporary, and culminate in an action-based project at the end of the term. By the end of the term, students will have crafted their own philosophy of feminism that will inspire their action- based term projects. In addition to reading the seminal works “The Second Sex,” by Simone de Beauvoir, and “Feminism Is for Everybody,” by bell hooks, students also will also venture into contemporary feminist theory and literature. Students will examine the works of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie with “Dear Ijeawele, Or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions” and “We Should All Be Feminists,” Roxane Gay’s essay collection “Bad Feminist,” and other relevant works.\n\nSpring Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nPolitical philosophy is the study of people in societies, focusing on the claims they have on each other in the form of rights and obligations and their demands for justice, equality and liberty. It is concerned with an analysis of the state and related institutions. This course studies questions about sovereignty (the power and authority assumed by the ruler) and political obligation (the duty and submission assumed by the ruled). Students will examine questions such as: Under which conditions can political obligation arise and what is its extent? Are freedom and equality compatible? What is justice — an idea, an ideal or simply a routine legal process? What connection is there between justice and law? What is a law? How are laws justified and are there aspects of human life that laws should not attempt to regulate? Should we always obey the law or are there conditions under which breaking the law is justifiable?\n\nSpring Term: 1 credit\n\nThis course offers an introduction to the study of sacred literature, with a focus on the Quran and Hadith, and examines the ways that early Muslims, medieval Muslim philosophers and poets and modern readers use scripture to explore theological and ethical questions. In this course, students will learn different methods for reading sacred literature, and they will be asked to examine the ways that oral and written religious traditions develop and spread. Students will be invited to use their own imaginations to examine the gaps in sacred narratives, and they will practice using sacred literature to make theological and ethical arguments.\n\nSpring Term: 1 credit\n\n[NCAA English core course]\n\nThis course examines the political, economic, and social developments from the year 2000 through 2023. The course will be guided by the following essential questions: How have the first two decades of the 21st century shaped current events? How is the United States different in 2023 from in the year 2000 and why? How can students learn from both the challenges and successes to help them become informed and engaged citizens as they enter adulthood? To that end, topics will include the 2000 election, the impact of 9/11 on both domestic and foreign affairs, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the emergence of cultural and political polarization, the Great Recession of 2008, the Obama, Trump and Biden presidencies, social justice movements, COVID-19, immigration, climate change, January 6th and the Supreme Court.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nThis is a fundamental course for true beginners of Chinese. Students learn to express themselves and understand others by focusing on topics closely related to their daily life. The four tones and proper pronunciation are introduced through rhythmic verses in order to help students develop a natural ear and tongue for the language. The pedagogy, known as TPRS (Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling), serves as a backbone for both oral comprehension and reading skills. Students also practice characters daily and in doing so build up a strong foundation for the Chinese writing system. In addition, students will engage in reading novice-level classic Chinese stories while also creating their own digital picture books.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPrerequisite: Chinese 1\n\nThis course is designed for students who have a solid mastery of the grammar and vocabulary covered in Chinese 1. Students will continue to build essential vocabulary in order to read and write level-appropriate passages, develop speaking skills and become acquainted with aspects of Chinese culture and society. In addition, the study of syntax is quite intense in this class and students are expected to express themselves with grammatical precision. Homework, essays and chapter tests are mostly handwritten. By the end of the course, students are well out of the beginner level.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPrerequisite: French 4 Honors\n\nThis course offers a survey of French literature. During the Fall and Winter Terms, students read French literary classics, beginning in the Middle Ages and focusing on one work per century. In spring they study novels from the contemporary Francophone world. The students also view French language films at home and draw connections with the readings. Class discussions focus primarily on close readings and assess the works within their historical and literary contexts. The writings and films additionally serve as springboards for thinking through social constructs and theoretical concepts such as race, gender, sexuality and intersectionality. The students improve their writing skills through frequent short writing assignments and in-class essays. Leading discussions and delivering presentations allows them to fine-tune their speaking abilities.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPrerequisite: German 1 and permission of the Department Head.\n\nThis course is a continuation of German 1 and is taught in the same manner. The basic study of grammar is completed and readings of increasing difficulty are introduced as the basis for expanded oral and written work. The course includes an introduction to German history, literature, film and cultural topics through the German language. By the end of the course, students are able to use workable basic German in normal situations they encounter and are able to enjoy works written in simple German.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPrerequisite: Spanish 3 Honors\n\nIn this class students expand their active knowledge of Spanish through the study of literature, film and other media. In the fall we discuss a series of plays; the winter is devoted to short stories; and in the spring, we read poetry and essays. Each term also includes a film. Assessments include expository and creative writing in Spanish, frequent quizzes on class materials and the performance of spoken exercises. No English is used in the classroom. While occasional grammar review is provided, students are expected to improve their Spanish by constant exposure to and use of the language. The class also includes occasional discussion of strategies for language learning.\n\nFall Term: 1 credit\n\nPrerequisite: Algebra II\n\nIn this course we will explore the intriguing history, ideas and applications of chaos theory. We will read from James Gleick’s “Chaos” and Ian Stewart’s “Does God Play Dice? The New Mathematics of Chaos” and learn about mathematicians John Conway, Edward Lorenz, Robert May, Benoit Mandelbrot and others. To help us to connect with the idea of “sensitive dependence on initial condition,” we will explore cellular automata, read a Dr. Seuss story, watch (Lorenzian) water wheels and observe iterative behavior in nonlinear systems. We will study the logistic map in order to visualize an orderly system turning chaotic and then look at strange attractors in order to find order in chaos. We will explore and analyze the hidden wonders of the Mandelbrot Set; this fractal icon will serve as an artistic masterpiece exemplifying chaotic behavior. Students will leave the course understanding the limitations of using mathematical laws to predict orderly behavior.\n\nWinter Term: 1 credit\n\nPrerequisite: Algebra II and Geometry\n\nHave you ever wondered how to solve the problems in “Good Will Hunting”? In this class, students will use graph theory to identify optimal solutions to network and design problems. How many bishops can be placed on a chessboard such that no two of them are attacking each other? How does an airline plan its routes? What is the winning strategy for the game Tic-Tac-Toe? This course will look for the answers to these questions and more by exploring the growing field of graph theory.\n\nSpring Term: 1 credit\n\nPrerequisite: Algebra II\n\nTo expand and explore new problem-solving skills, every class will be filled with a variety of group and solo activities to engage students. Much of the focus of the course will be on Japanese-style logic puzzles such as KenKen and Nurikabe. Students will learn to solve such puzzles as well as create their own. By the end of the course, students will have learned over 20: different types of logic puzzles, each of which will help them develop different aspects of their critical thinking skills. The course will culminate with a presentation, as each student will research a different type of logic puzzle that they will master and teach to the class.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPrerequisite: Geometry, Algebra II Honors and permission of the Department Head.\n\nThis is a rigorous course intended for students of demonstrated ability who have the desire and capability to learn and work independently and to think creatively. Students pursue a comprehensive study of the content of precalculus in greater depth.

This material provides a strong preparation for calculus. Mathematical dexterity is a focus, particularly in the writing of proofs and creative problem-solving. Applications are used throughout to illustrate concepts.\n\nFull Year: 1 credit\n\nPrerequisite: Precalculus or Foundations in Precalculus\n\nThis course provides students with an intuitive approach to the fundamentals of differential calculus. Students explore limits, leading to the definition of derivative. The concepts of average and instantaneous rate of change are investigated. We develop the rules of differentiation, including the chain rule and implicit differentiation, and apply them to problems in optimization, related rates and curve sketching. We will expand upon the differential calculus to introduce the concepts of finding area under a curve, the integral regarded as the antiderivative and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Students will learn multiple techniques for integration, including substitution. Definite and indefinite integrals are used to explore applications such as distance, area, and volumes of solids of revolution.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPrerequisite: Precalculus, Foundations in Precalculus or permission of the Department Head.\n\nStatistics is the science and art of learning from data to understand our uncertain world. We find statistics everywhere in daily life, from climate change and presidential polls to sports and the development of new medicines. In this yearlong course, students are exposed to four broad conceptual themes: Exploring Data (describing patterns and departures from patterns), Sampling and Experimentation (planning and conducting a study), Anticipating Patterns (exploring random phenomena using probability and simulation), and Statistical Inference (estimating population parameters and testing hypotheses). Students participate in several projects. Students also will use data analysis software to model statistical problems.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPrerequisite: Precalculus Honors or grade of High Honors in Precalculus.\n\nThis is a rigorous course for students of demonstrated ability who have the desire and capability to learn and work independently and to think creatively. The entire content of Statistics will be covered in greater depth. In this Honors course, students will learn about four broad conceptual themes: Exploring Data (describing patterns and departures from patterns), Sampling and Experimentation (planning and conducting a study), Anticipating Patterns (exploring random phenomena using probability and simulation), and Statistical Inference (estimating population parameters and testing hypotheses). Students will participate in several projects to analyze current issues. To develop effective statistical communication skills, students will be required to prepare frequent writ-ten and oral analyses of real data. Statistics Honors is the high school equivalent of an introductory college statistics course and students will be prepared to take the Advanced Placement exam in May. This course also prepares students for further study of statistics in science, economics, sociology, psychology, medicine, math, engineering, political science, geography, business, education and more.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPrerequisite: Precalculus Honors or Grade of High Honors in Precalculus.\n\nThis course is suitable for those students with demonstrated ability and interest in mathematics.

Students who successfully complete this course are prepared to take the BC level of the Advanced Placement examination in calculus in May.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPhysics First is designed for all entering Third Form students and forms the first of a three-year foundation series. Students are encouraged to ask questions and create projects to seek answers while learning to work together in small groups, allowing for the free flow of creative ideas. Students explore the beauty and simplicity of the fundamental laws that explain our universe. Since experimentation is key to all science, great emphasis is placed on laboratory work. Throughout the course of the year students will study motion, forces, energy, momentum, coding, charges and light as well as topics involving diversity, equity, inclusion and justice (DEIJ).\n\nIn the Fall Term, students focus on scientific measurement, experimental design, kinematics and an introduction to Newton’s Laws. In the Winter Term the course continues with Newton’s Laws and progresses to the study of mechanical energy and momentum. Spring Term finds students venturing into the study of electromagnetic fields, electrical circuits, light and optics. The end of term assessments in Physics First include a term exam, a DEIJ poster project and a lab practical.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPrerequisite: Co-enrollement in Algebra 2 or Higher.\n\n[This course is intended for students who matriculate to SPS after Third Form year and is not avail-able to those who have completed Physics First.]\n\nStudents investigate the physical world using both traditional and computer-based data acquisition and analysis. This course introduces students to the major topic areas of physics, focusing on conceptual understanding and analytical problem-solving techniques. Extensive laboratory explorations, performed in small groups, are used to introduce concepts that are then reinforced through discussion and problem work. Incorporating a more mathematical approach than Physics First, Physics begins with the study of mechanics, including uniform motion, Newton’s Laws, momentum, energy, circular motion and gravitation. This is followed by electrostatics, magnetism, DC circuits and magnetism. A working knowledge of algebra is assumed.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPrerequisite: Co-enrollment in Precalculus or higher.\n\n[This course is not available to students who have completed Physics First.]\n\nHonors Physics is designed for students with strong math backgrounds who are seeking a deeper understanding of their physical world. Students will complete an accelerated introduction to Newtonian mechanics. Topics include linear and projectile motion, Newton’s Laws, energy, momentum, uniform circular motion, rotational dynamics, simple harmonic motion, waves and light. Laboratory exercises and classroom demonstrations are used throughout the course to solidify conceptualization and instill respect for data. Concepts also are strengthened through work in group tutorials developed specifically for students at this level as well as student-driven projects at the conclusion of the term.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPrerequisite: Successful completion of a full year of physics and a full year of calculus.\n\nThis is a college-level course that relies heavily on the use of calculus and builds on the concepts developed in Physics First, Physics or Honors Physics, going into greater depth and detail. We will study Newtonian mechanics, electricity and magnetism, waves and oscillations and, if time permits, a few topics in modern physics. Laboratory exercises and classroom demonstrations are used throughout the course to solidify conceptualization, build theoretical modeling skills, develop explanations and instill respect for data. Computer programs (such as Excel and Python) are used for data analysis, mathematical modeling and numerical integration. Students develop writing skills to produce journal-quality lab reports. Students who successfully complete this course are prepared to take the AP Physics C: Mechanics and the AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism Advanced Placement examinations in May.\n\nFall or Spring Term: 1 credit\n\nThis is a one-term course designed to give students an introduction to observational astronomy. In the classroom, the basic principles of astronomy are taught, including the layout of the heavens, a study of the solar system, a history of astronomy and the basic principles of telescopes. At the Hawley Observatory, students work independently at least one clear night a week learning the constellations and the phases of the moon and how to use a telescope to find objects that are invisible to the naked eye. Upon completion of this course, students are encouraged to take Stellar Astronomy and Galactic Astronomy.\n\nWinter Term: 1 credit\n\nPrerequisite: Introduction to Astronomy\n\nThis course builds upon the Introduction to Astronomy course and is focused upon the nature of stars in our universe as we know it. Students will study the makeup and activity of our Sun; how astronomers use spectra to determine the properties and components of stars; the evolution of low- and high-mass stars; and the spectacular stellar deaths of supernovae and black holes. Students also are encouraged to take Galactic Astronomy, though Stellar Astronomy is not a prerequisite.\n\nSpring Term: 1 credit\n\nPrerequisite: Introduction to Astronomy\n\nThis course builds upon the Introduction to Astronomy course and is focused upon the nature of galaxies in our universe as we know it. Students will study the formation and structure of the Milky Way and other galaxies; how astronomers use observations across the electromagnetic spectrum to learn about galaxies; the evolution of large-scale structure, including as it relates to dark matter; and the birth and death of the universe, including the Big Bang and the effects of dark energy. Students also are encouraged to take Stellar Astronomy, though that is not a prerequisite for this course.\n\nFall Term: 1 credit\n\nPrerequisite: One year of chemistry. Not open to students who have taken Advanced Chemistry.\n\nThis term-long chemistry course is designed for students who would like to continue on in chemistry, but are not interested in taking the yearlong Advanced Chemistry course. In this laboratory-based course, students will study various methods of quantitative analysis, including titration, gravimetric analysis and spectrophotometry to gain a better understanding of analytical chemistry. These concepts apply to the real world in pharmaceutical, food, chemical and agriculture industries — businesses that use chemistry to measure product quality before releasing it to consumers.\n\nWinter Term: 1 credit\n\nPrerequisite: One year of chemistry.\n\nThis laboratory-based course introduces students to the core concepts and lab skills that are necessary to appreciate the field of organic chemistry. This course is designed to be a standalone introduction to the biologically relevant topics to give students a core understanding of the field, but it also prepares students for the rigors of a college organic chemistry curriculum. The course begins with a primer on bonding and structure, and then builds up to understanding the nuances of three-dimensional organic structures. This will then transition into understanding how functional groups behave and react with the goal of being able to understand how larger, more complicated organic molecules can be synthesized. Organic chemistry requires a puzzle-like focus on problem solving, the ability to develop three-dimensional visualization skills, and a good memory for the core information.\n\nSpring Term: 1 credit\n\nPrerequisite: One Year of Chemistry. Not open to students who have taken Advanced Chemistry.\n\nThis term-long chemistry course is designed for students who would like to continue on in chemistry, but are not interested in taking the yearlong Advanced Chemistry course. This course expands on the basic knowledge of reaction rates and equilibrium developed in first-year chemistry. Through experimentation, students will be introduced to rate laws and mechanisms as well as special applications of equilibrium including buffer solutions and solubility equilibria. These concepts apply to our bodies every day when biochemical reactions occur at just the correct rate and pH is delicately equilibrated in our blood in order to maintain homeostasis.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPrerequisite: Successful completion of a full year of Honors Chemistry with a grade of Honors or better or of a full year of Chemistry with a grade of High Honors and permission of the teacher or chair.\n\nIntended for those students who desire a more challenging study of chemistry, this advanced course parallels that of a college chemistry course and prepares students for the Advanced Placement examination in chemistry.

In this course, students will learn the basic terminology of embryology while also observing and studying the developmental process in several invertebrate and vertebrate models. Students also will be introduced to the concept of how evolutionary changes in genes can affect phenotype, in turn resulting in certain similarities and differences of the developmental characters of different embryos. In the integrated lab sections of this class, students will have hands-on opportunities to examine different stages of early embryonic development in both vertebrate (chick) and invertebrate (nematode) embryos. Students will compare and contrast the development of these embryos with human embryonic development and how each of these species are related evolutionarily. They also will learn about a few real-life teratogens that affect human embryonic development. Upon completion of this class, students will have the basic toolkit to appreciate and understand how the development of one species can shed light on how it has evolved relative to development of other species.\n\nSpring Term: 1 credit\n\nPrerequisite: One year of Biology and one year of Chemistry.\n\nEvolution is a fundamental component of our understanding of life, underlying all other concepts that we study in life science. Students will explore how evolution occurs, the evidence that supports our understanding of evolution and where we are witnessing evolution today. The course will examine the work of several scientists in the field and how that work fits together to inform our current understanding of evolution. Students will learn about both microevolution and macroevolution through historical and current examples. Students will apply these concepts to current examplesof evolution in today’s world.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPrerequisites: One year of Biology and one year of Chemistry.\n\nThis is an upper-level Biology course designed to build a strong foundation in biochemistry and molecular biology upon which students apply their knowledge to trending areas in the field. During the Fall Term, students study topics including biochemistry, the origins of life and evolution, the central dogma of biology, DNA error and repair, aging and cellular senescence. The Winter Term of Molecular Biology covers a variety of topics including epigenetics and cancer. In both Fall and Winter Terms, students investigate topics by mastering molecular laboratory techniques including aseptic technique, DNA purification, PCR, sequence analysis and tissue culture. In fall, students will examine the molecular changes resulting in adaptive radiation of a bacteria, P. fluorescence. In Winter Term, students also examine the genetics and treatment of cancer through cell culture experiments while developing and refining their molecular techniques. Throughout the school year, students will develop important skills, including reading and writing scientific journal articles, presenting in a formal scientific manner, breaking down molecular mechanisms and applying their content knowledge to novel situations. During the Spring Term, students identify a question they want to investigate and design a research plan based on the neurobiology knowledge they learned in class in combination with all the techniques they have mastered over the course of the year. The class reviews the proposals, and a few projects are selected and carried out based on merit, feasibility and interest. The project concludes with a finished manuscript that follows the guidelines of a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPrerequisite: One Year of Biology and one year of Chemistry.\n\n[Students taking our full-year Human Anatomy and Physiology course should not enroll in this course.]\n\nIn the Fall Term, students investigate the biochemistry, digestion and metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.

Laboratory investigations include anatomical dissections, biochemical analysis of foods, dietary assessments and evaluation of metabolic rate during rest and exercise.\n\nStudents begin the Winter Term by investigating normal cardiorespiratory function and health. This is followed by an exploration of the cardio-respiratory responses to acute exercise, as well as the physiological adaptations to chronic exercise (training) and selected stressors such as high-altitude training, aging and disease. Laboratory investigations include anatomical dissections, blood pressure, electrocardiogram and pulmonary analyses, and treadmill measurements of oxygen consumption (VO2) and anaerobic threshold.\n\nDuring Spring Term, students investigate how skeletal muscle develops and functions. This is followed by an exploration of the neuromuscular responses and physiological adaptations to chronic exercise (resistance training) and selected stressors, including use of muscle-building aids and supplements, as well changes in muscle physiology with aging and disease states. Laboratory investigations include anatomical dissections, muscle metabolism and fiber type assessment, and measurements of muscular strength, endurance and flexibility. Students will investigate, evaluate and compare reports of muscle physiology changes presented in the popular press with research published in scientific literature. During all terms, students will read original research, design experiments to address their own physiological questions and report findings in end-of-term presentations.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPrerequisite: One year of Biology and one year of Chemistry.\n\nStudents will be introduced to the basic concepts that inform issues in environmental science. In the Fall, we will deal with core concepts that include an introduction to geology and a review of basic biology and chemistry through the field of biogeochemistry. The term will end with an introduction to soil biology and environmental issues related to agriculture. During Winter Term, students will focus on human aspects of environmental science. The term will begin with a discussion of the ecological consequences of human overpopulation. From here, we will move toward aligning economic theory with sustainable development on a local, national and global scale. In the Spring Term, students will use their knowledge of sustainable development to discuss the social, technical and ecological aspects of energy development and us-age on a global scale. As the snow melts, we return to a local perspective and explore the land-use history at St. Paul’s School and the New England region. We will move from this historic perspective to a more modern look at forestry and land use practices throughout the region. We end the year looking at the major causes and consequences of climate change while students design and conduct independent research projects that integrate the major themes of the course.\n\nFull Year: 3 credits\n\nPrerequisite: One year of Biology and one year of Chemistry.\n\nThis year-long advanced science course investigates the fresh and saltwater ecology of the world’s watery biomes. During the Fall Term, using the natural resources of our campus, students will examine New Hampshire’s aquatic habitats by studying energy flow, nutrient cycling, pollution and ecosystem stability in our own lakes, ponds and streams. The Winter portion of this course examines the open ocean in all its vastness, depth and power. Creatures of the open ocean, including marine mammals and deep-sea inhabitants, will be at the heart of the term’s study. Mammalian diving physiology, sharks, skates and rays also will be an important part of our studies. During the Spring Term, our course examines the marine environments closer to shore, including coral reefs, mangroves, estuaries and rocky coastlines. Students will learn how to identify fish, study the interconnectedness of the sea and the land and investigate the complex relationships found in each of these biomes. Human influence and fisheries management will be major themes throughout the year. Students enrolled in Marine Biology will have the unique opportunity to participate in a multi-day field trip to MarineLab in Key Largo, Florida or The Island School in Eleuthera, Bahamas. Both trips include a hands-on study of coral reefs, mangroves and saltwater ecosystems along with an in-depth look at the sustainability of our natural aquatic resources.\n\nFall or Spring Term: 1 credit\n\nThis course introduces students to the foundations of programming and robotics using the Arduino-C language and embedded controllers.

The objective of this course is to engage students in a challenging problem that allows them to put deterministic-design techniques into practice. Near the start of the Winter Term, specifications for the international FIRST Robotics competition (https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) will be received and studied. In January, the students may travel to a kickoff event in Manchester to learn about the new challenge. The remainder of the Winter Term will be spent brainstorming, designing, manufacturing, and programming the team’s entry. At the end of the Winter Term, the team will compete with its robot “Big Red” in various regional competitions. Essential to the course will be the completion of periodic self-reflection journals that allow the students to reassess and refine their problem-solving and engineering-design techniques. This course can be taken multiple times to broaden a student’s experience in solving problems using an engineering-design process. Students taking the course a second time are expected to work on more advanced projects and serve as teachers/mentors to the new students.\n\nSpring Term: 1 credit\n\nPrerequisite: Engineering Design or USFIRST Robotics or by teacher approval.\n\nThe Spring Term course allows students to work on large-scale engineering projects to further their understanding of the engineering design process. Students are asked to identify a project that meets the criteria for ” Engineering a Better World.” Projects dealing with energy, the environment, and adaptive technology are encouraged, but students are open to considering other challenges. In this engineering research course, students may work in teams to design and develop an original solution to a valid open-ended technical problem by applying the engineering design process. Utilizing the activity- project- problem-based (APPB) teaching and learning pedagogy, students will perform research to choose, validate and justify a technical problem. After carefully defining the problem, individuals or teams of students will design, build and test their solution, ultimately presenting and defending their original solution to an outside panel. While progressing through the engineering design process, students will work closely with experts. They will continually hone their organizational, communication and interpersonal skills as well as their creative and problem-solving abilities and understanding of the design process.\n\nSpring Term: 1 credit\n\nThis course is the first in the Applied Science and Engineering Program.
