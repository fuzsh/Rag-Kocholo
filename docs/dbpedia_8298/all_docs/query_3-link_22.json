        "text": "Integra Contemporary & Electroacoustics (ICE) is a student ensemble that focuses on the integration of divergent practices and art forms: audio and visual; analogue and digital; instrumental and computer/algorithmic performance; hardware and software; music and performance art.\n\nIn ICE, we engage in experimental approaches that include composing and free improv, experimenting with live electronics, developing new digital instruments, sound design, creative sound production techniques, live coding, live gameplay, experimental video, and software synthesis (Logic Pro, Ableton Suite, Max, among others). We also code with TidalCycles, an open source, Haskell-based, software for patterning and performing music with code, for “algoraves” or composing in the studio.\n\nStudents can also integrate regular musical instruments (saxophones, pianos, didgeridoo, accordions, voices, percussion instruments, etc.), electronic instruments (guitars, microphones, MOOG Voyager, etc.) and digital instruments (turntables, DTX Drums, wii remotes, tablets, and more…) while practicing group performance, composition and free improv.\n\nWe develop new performance practices and explore a potential for increased musical expressivity through technology.\n\n“ICE” ensemble returns in September.

More here ulethelectro.wordpress.com\n\nSome technical and technological topics are taught as new learning is required in any university course. For those nervous about dealing with tech, also consider the learning as a transferable skill (e.g., Technology in the classroom for future educators).\n\nWe make an effort to form small bands/ensembles in which members learn from each other – we try to harness each member’s strengths. We bring together different ways of playing that utilise the strength of ensemble members.\n\nJoin and celebrate our return to live, in-person, public concerts\n\nINTEGRA CONTEMPORARY & ELECTROACOUSTICS ensemble\n\nPRESENTS\n\nRemote\n\nTuesday, April 13\n\n7:30 – 9:00pm\n\nUTC-6 (MDT)\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/ulethelectro\n\nhttps://hub.link/2eycTjz (Virtual Reality)\n\nPerformers:\n\nAldrin Azucena\n\nCameron Hughes\n\nJacqueline Kennelly\n\nLoryn Plante\n\nNathan Stewart\n\nDirector:\n\nD. Andrew Stewart\n\nProgramme:\n\nMake Sound! everyone\n\nAlienation Red ensemble\n\nSolo\n\nNieR:Exotica Orange ensemble\n\nRemote everyone\n\nProgram Notes:\n\nMake Sound!\n\nTesting…testing…testing\n\nAlienation\n\nOnce we thought that the 2020s would be characterised by flying cars and robots…\n\nWell, in a way, maybe that’s true! Only we are the robots, flying our cars around cyberspace, just trying to find meaningful connection.\n\nThe vast online world allows us to connect across space and time, except nothing compares to real-life, face-to-face interaction with other human beings?\n\nSolo\n\n.\n\nNieR:Exotica\n\nNier Exotica is in three sections and is based on the action RPG video game, NieR:Automata.\n\nSection one starts off with a sustained ambient tone as the main player-character arrives at the city ruins. We hear earthy rhythms and SFXs in a fragmented manner representing a dystopian environment. The guitar starts playing the melody giving a feeling of the main character’s solitude.\n\nA change of mode/scale from major to minor occurs in section two when the robots attack the main character. The earthy – nature feeling of the SFXs and the rhythm are replaced by a mechanical, robotic feel. Each time the tempo increases, the robots chant “this cannot continue” and “become as gods”. The sound world explodes once the fastest tempo is attained, followed by silence.\n\nSection three slowly recaps the first section, but switches to guitar harmonics and percussion. Section three stops and the guitar fades into silence.\n\nRemote\n\nReflecting upon themes of remoteness, the ensemble guides audiences on a sensory and immersive auditory journey.\n\nThe Code Ritual\n\nThursday, 10 December, 2020, 7:30PM UTC-7 (MST)\n\nOn Twitch twitch.tv/ulethelectro\n\nIn Hubs hub.link/2eycTjz\n\nMake Sound! everyone Rocket Man green ensemble Roulette collaborative code Creation blue ensemble The Code Ritual timed code\n\nRocket Man\n\nRocket man is a piece in 3 parts. The first part is the rocket readying for take-off and initiating count down. It is a sequential and rhythmic section based around an audio sound bite that starts off the piece. As the A section continues the complexity of the rhythm increases as the rocket takes off into space. The B section is lyrical, with the main melody based on a Hungarian minor scale. The rocket has reached orbit and is free falling constantly in space. Finally, the A section returns as before. However, as the end of the piece comes closer, the speed picks up and there is an increase in loudness. Slowly the rhythm devolves. The rocket is slowly failing and falling out of orbit. The piece ends suddenly, and the rhythm slows down until no sound is left, the rocket has failed and is now floating in the vacuum of space.\n\nRoulette\n\nIn this performance, the ensemble is split into two teams. Each performer adds their name to the queue on their teams coding box and when it’s their turn they have complete control of the sound! The goal is to create a collaborative coding experience where team mates play off of each other’s strengths while developing a composite musical voice.\n\nCreation\n\nCreation is a meditative piece based on the Cree Creation story, beginning with a heartbeat. The sound of the fire emerges, and the improvisation begins. There is a curious unrest midway with a faster tempo, more frantic melodic movement, and increased tension before the inevitable return to familiarity. The piece settles back to the heartbeat to conclude. Throughout the piece, the sound of rain accompanies the narration.\n\nThe Code Ritual\n\nThe Code Ritual requires ensemble members to work as a unit, creating a cohesive musical structure. While all members are coding at the same time, rarely is the entire ensemble simultaneously producing sound. Instead, The Code Ritual results in variations of quartets, trios, and duos. Through a system of visual signals created by Punctual (a programming language for generative music and visuals), members’ sounds are cued in during a period of 30 to 60 seconds – each person has 30 to 60 seconds to alter or add to the fluid musical texture. The trick here is to try to write code that can be interpreted and built upon by other members, who are standing by to take over the musical journey.\n\nThe band\n\nEvan Alexander\n\nAldrin Azucena\n\nChris Bernhardt\n\nCameron Hughes\n\nShay Hunter\n\nElliot Middleton\n\nLoryn Plante\n\nNathan Stewart\n\nPatrick Davis, Hubs support\n\nD. Andrew Stewart, director\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nIntegra Contemporary & Electroacoustics wants to acknowledge the invaluable support of the following people and entities, whose visual and musical networking ingenuity and expertise have found a home with the ICE ensemble.\n\nEstuary: David Ogborn and the Estuary development team at the Networked Imagination Laboratory (NIL) at McMaster University.\n\nTidal Cycles: Thank you to Alex McLean, and numerous active developers, for creating, building and maintaining this algorithmic composition environment.\n\nGraphic design by coder, sound artist and improviser Michał Seta.\n\nICEe is back. The final concert is on 10 December, 7:30PM UTC-7. Join us: Evan Alexander, Aldrin Azucena, Chris Bernhardt, Cameron Hughes, Shaylen Hunter, Elliot Middleton, Loryn Plante, Nathan Stewart, D. Andrew Stewart.\n\nIntegra Contemporary & Electroacoustics (ICEe) is an electroacoustic music ensemble formed by students in the digital audio arts, computer science, management, and music from the University of Lethbridge.\n\nWe code in the haskell-based language, Tidal Cycles, and an original audio-visual programming language known as Punctual.\n\nDuring the event, The Code Ritual, we present computer/algorithmic performances and live music and visual coding, streaming to Twitch and Mozilla’s open-source VR Hubs. Visit the concert venue now and every Monday (7:30 to 9:30PM UTC-7) – open in Firefox for stereo sound.\n\nGet a taste of collaborative coding roulette; performers contribute to a single musical voice while considering each other’s style and abilities, leaving openings for play and spontaneous improvisation.\n\nCome experience countdown coding; performers show off their technical dexterity and musical sharpness while coding within the constraints of time.\n\nThe Code Ritual also features a mixed composition that retells a Métis Origin Story through spoken work, live sound and live coding.\n\nSo, what is live coding?"
