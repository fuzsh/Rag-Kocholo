        "text": "You may perform integer operations with objects of the type char. For example you may decrease or increase a value stored in an object of the type char, or add or subtract a value.\n\nFor example if an object of the type char contains a symbol that represents a digit as for example\n\nchar c = '5';\n\nthen you can get the digit as a number the following way\n\nint digit = c - '0';\n\nThe variable digit will contain the number 5.\n\nPay attention to that the type char can behave either as the type signed char or unsigned char dependent on compiler options."
