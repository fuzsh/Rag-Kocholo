        "text": "HiCON-EXTIO [1]: Enables 24 additional I/O points on J7 and J8 socket, and also enables Mach4 Sync Outputs (M62/M63). This feature is included with the purchase of 7535 I/O Board. It can also be purchased individually without the 7535 hardware, but please note that working directly with the J7/J8 ports without optical isolation can damage the 3.3V pins. HiCON-ADC [1]: This software feature enables the use of the 2 analog inputs located on J6. ArcPRO Plasma [1]: M4ARCPRO software feature allows the use of ArcPro Plasma screen. 77ISO is required to read the plasma analog voltage. For packages and more information visit ARCPRO page. INTG-CLOOP [1]: This software feature allows Closed-Loop Stepper operation with or without PID control and enables Encoder channels 3-8 on J7/J8. Using the 7737 Board greatly simplifies wiring for Encoder Feedback and Step/Dir channels on J7 and J8 . 7737 Board : The pn7737 Differential Step/Direction and Encoder Board allows access to the Step/Direction and Encoder channels on J7 and J8 plugs, and allows a simple plug-and-play setup using standard RJ45/Ethernet cables. When used with Drive Interface Board (EPx-DIB) for Maxsine AC Servo Drives, this board provides almost plug and play installation. In order to use encoders for Axis Feedback purpose, \"Closed Loop Activation\" must be purchased. 7535 Board : The I/O Termination board (7535P or 7535N) provides 24 Volts optically isolated digital I/O. Each board has 16 input terminals and 8 output terminals. All I/O terminals are clearly marked for quick and easy installation. Upto two 7535 (N or P) boards can be plugged into HiCON Integra, providing additional 32 Inputs and 16 outputs (24Volts 1Amp). YSK-ABS [1]: This software feature allows the use of Yaskawa Absolute Encoder feature. Only compatible with Yaskawa Drives with absolute Encoder models. Ask sales for more information ."
