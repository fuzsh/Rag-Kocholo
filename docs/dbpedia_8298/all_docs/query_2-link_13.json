        "text": "This paper introduces an investigation into the emerging role of the interactive music producer (IMP). This role has arisen as interactive technologies offer artists and audiences' new tools and opportunities to completely reinvent forms of music. The definition of an IMP's role will be clarified, evaluated and explored throughout this research. The research identifies the necessary skills underpinning cutting edge contemporary music practice. Focused research towards artistic approaches of interactive music making are needed due to the complex nature of developing interactive products, which usually involves custom-built software and expert interdisciplinary skills. This creates a huge problem for musicians and the music industry wanting to embrace changes in technology and communication. This research aims to address this problem by providing a new role that merges interactive technologies with traditional music making. The paper will introduce preliminary findings resulting from three creative works, utilising gestures, VR and performance. The creative practice involved building on existing skills in software and coding, producing interfaces and patches to experiment with while composing, recording, arranging and producing works that are fluid, adaptive and dynamic with audience interaction. By taking a bricoleur approach the researcher / artist is able to directly access potential impacts interactive technologies may have on contemporary music making and practice.\n\nHuman-Computer Interaction with music systems has not yet presented a solution for non-musicians to create music. In this paper I present “Musikus”; an application meant to allow non-musicians to interact and play good-sounding music in an intuitive and simplistic manner. Three different user interfaces were created, each allowing the users to interact with the music in a different way. A thorough user study was conducted and the user feedback is presented and analyzed. Results show that the interface is indeed intuitive but the level of control that the user has over the music, is a fine line that needs to be further examined. This opens the discussion for further work in Human-Computer Interaction studies to find the point at which the users have enough control to express themselves and at the same time do not get overwhelmed with complicated control paradigms that can frustrate them.\n\nOne of the most intriguing fields of human-computer interaction (HCI) involves the communication aspects of computer music interfaces. Music is a rich communication medium, and computer music is the amalgam of interface science and musical praxis forming a dynamic subset of HCI. There are structural similarities between the job of a music composer and that of a user interface designer (although their objectives may be different). While sound has been used in general purpose interfaces as an object, its use has been deteriorated at a primary level, that of a signal-processing approach. However, music composition and performance are highly abstract human activities involving a semantic and a symbolic mechanism of human intellectual activity. This article analyzes the unique problems posed by the use of computers by composers and performers of music. It presents the HCI predicates involved in the chain of musical interaction with computer devices, commencing from the abstract part of symbolic composition, then coping with usability issues of the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) implemented for musical scripting, and concluding to a synthesis stage which produces digitized sounds that enhance or replace original analog audio signals. The evaluation of HCI elements for computer music under the prism of usability aims at the development of new graphical tools, new symbolic languages, and finally better user interfaces. The advance in technology on this area creates the demand for more qualitative user interfaces and more functional and flexible computer music devices. The peculiarities of computer music create new fields in HCI research concerning the design and the functionality of computer music systems.\n\nThis paper presents a discussion regarding organology classification and taxonomies for digital musical instruments (DMI), arising from the TIEM (Taxonomy of Interfaces for Electronic Music performance) survey (http://tiem.emf.org/), conducted as part of an Australian Research Council Linkage project titled “Performance Practice in New Interfaces for Realtime Electronic Music Performance”. This research is being carried out at the VIPRe Lab at, the University of Western Sydney in partnership with the Electronic Music Foundation (EMF), Infusion Systems and The Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory (IDMIL) at McGill University. The project seeks to develop a schema of new interfaces for realtime electronic music performance."
