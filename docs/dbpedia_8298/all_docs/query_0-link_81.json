        "text": "This paper explores live coding environments in the con- text of notational systems. The improvisational practice of live coding as combining both composition and per- formance is introduced and selected systems are dis- cussed. The author’s Threnoscope system is described, but this is a system that enables the performer to work with both descriptive and prescriptive scores that can be run and altered in an improvisational performance.\n\nThis paper describes the process involved when a live coder decides to learn a new musical programming language of another paradigm. The paper introduces the problems of running comparative experiments, or user studies, within the field of live coding. It suggests that an autoethnographic account of the process can be helpful for understanding the technological conditioning of contemporary musical tools. The author is conducting a larger research project on this theme: the part presented in this paper describes the adoption of a new musical programming environment, Impromptu, and how this affects the author’s musical practice.\n\nThe author discusses live coding as a new path in the evolution of the musical score. Live-coding practice accentuates the score, and whilst it is the perfect vehicle for the performance of algorithmic music it also transforms the compositional process itself into a live event. As a continuation of 20th century artistic developments of the musical score, live-coding systems often embrace graphical elements and language syntaxes foreign to standard programming languages. The author presents live coding as a highly technologized artistic practice, shedding light on how non-linearity, play and generativity will become prominent in future creative media productions.\n\nSeveral researchers are dealing with colour, as a basic expressive element of cinema style. Nevertheless, the difficulty in analyzing a large number of images and describing their nature and characteristics in non subjective terms are still among the problems faced in this area. This research presents a quantitative methodology that enables a systematic, objective and verifiable study of colour, by automatically obtaining accurate colour data from large amounts of images. The proposed scheme also allow us to find possible meanings when relating quantitative information obtained to the narrative content. In order to test its efficiency, the methodological tool is applied to Career Girls (Mike Leigh, 1997). As a result, hue is found to follow an expressive program evolving within the narrative content, as it is closely linked to the different periods present in the film.\n\nSolutions to the problem of disrupted visual communication in laptop ensembles are explored. Essential channels of visual interpersonal communication are found both between performers and audience and among the performers themselves. Because the use of a laptop computer is inherently visually oriented, it easily leads to visual fixation, possibly at the expense of audience or ensemble engagement. After examining impediments to visual communication, strategies are presented relating to laptop ensemble or orchestra (LEO) instrument design with respect to the different types of information that the performer may need to receive or access or monitor: user input feedback, non-immediate or timed computational results, and networked information. Although the primary focus of this examination is geared toward the designer of software “instruments” for the LEO, other strategies are acknowledged that may assist in restoring visual freedom.\n\nAfter an eventful decade of live-coding activities, this article seeks to explore the practice with the aim of situating it in the history of contemporary arts and music. The article introduces several key points of investigation in live-coding research and discusses some examples of how live-coding practitioners engage with these points in their system design and performances. In light of the extremely diverse manifestations of live-coding activities, the problem of defining the practice is discussed, and the question is raised whether live coding is actually necessary as an independent category."
