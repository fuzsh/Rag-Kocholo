        "text": "*Adam locked Stuart in the west wing of the Chandler mansion for years.\n\n*Stuart stood in for Adam so that he could illegally divorce Erica.\n\n*Stuart tried to kill Palmer when he was still in the West Wing\n\n*He helped Marian and Liza to keep Adam locked up in a safe room.\n\n*Stuart Signed Adam's name to multi-million dollar checks\n\n*Owns an art gallery\n\n*Is good friends with Krystal Carey Chandler\n\n*Was killed by a bullet meant for Adam.\n\n*Resurfaced when it was revealed David had been keeping him alive.\n\nStuart is the meek and mild twin brother of Adam Chandler and has often been the brunt of Adam's schemes. For years Adam had Stuart locked up in the west wing of the Chandler mansion. An artist, Stuart would spend his days painting. Stuart is uncannily aware of his twin's mood swings and can usually get Adam to talk about his problems. However, Adam rarely tells Stuart the whole truth.\n\nTo break up Stuart's relationship with Marian Colby, Adam paraded a string of Marian's past beaus in front of Stuart. The stunt didn't work and Stuart and Marian walked down the aisle. They are still happily married.\n\nIn 2009, nearly everyone in Pine Valley was after Adam because of a botched operation on Ian Slater, Kendall and Zach's son. Fearing for his life, Adam told Stuart that he loved him. Stuart later donned Adam's suit and was accidentally shot and killed by Adam himself.\n\nStuart resurfaced in 2011 when it was revealed David had been keeping him alive as part of his Orpheus project."
