        "text": "Once a diagnosis of autism is made, a myriad of questions arises. Why is this happening? What can I do? How will I cope? What will the future bring?\n\nA roadmap is needed, a handbook to refer to when all seems overwhelming. The priorities are to begin the process of learning how best to support your child and move forward. The way to ensure success is to begin with the end goals in mind. It is remarkable how things fall into place once a vision of the future is formulated – a productive, upstanding, and most important, happy adult!\n\nAutism Parent Handbook: Start with the End Goal in Mind walks you through the steps of early intervention by demonstrating how to achieve the most optimal outcomes for your child. We address the following:\n\nHappy adults have a positive outlook and feel valued when their passions are honored and when interest is shown in the things they love. We can help children foster those attitudes in early childhood.\n\nProductive adults regulate their emotions, manage their time, cope with change, make wise choices, and accept responsibility for their actions. We illustrate how to develop these skills from the outset.\n\nAdults perform skills independently and complete tasks necessary for work and home life. Children should be expected to do the same. We show you how to prepare your children for the future.\n\nWherever you are on your parenting journey, and whatever age your child is, now is the time to look forward and plant seeds for the future, beginning with the end in mind.\n\nOur shared goal is to honor the glory that is in all of us, and to enhance each child’s journey towards their fullest potential. If you are now confused and overwhelmed, you need a compassionate and optimistic guide for the early years and beyond.\n\nWhere to start?\n\nRight here."
