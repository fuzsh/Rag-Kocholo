        "text": "Before heading to the Love Island villa, Molly Marsh made headlines for her celeb connections, including her mum Janet Marsh who previously appeared in ITV soap Coronation Street.\n\nBut during her stay in the villa, viewers began to speculate that the actress was receiving special treatment as a result of her mother’s connections in the TV channel. Pointing out how Molly had been brought back for Casa Amor, after being eliminated. With fans online even claiming that her mother worked as a producer at ITV.\n\nHowever, Janet has addressed these rumours on her daughter’s behalf. Telling the Daily Mail: ‘They have made stuff up about me.”\n\n“It is made up. At one point I was an ITV producer and pulling strings when I was actually sitting at school teaching phonics to some year sevens!”\n\nThe reality star’s mum admitted the rumours and nasty comments were taking a toll on their family.\n\nSaying: “I had heard about trolling from past series because we have always watched Love Island but until your name is being brought up and your family’s names… I couldn’t believe it’s that bad and that real.”\n\n“We all know what Molly is like in real life and people presume… you read nasty comments and I think ‘that’s not my daughter, you haven’t got a clue.'”\n\n“We decided to stop reading all the rubbish because it’s not true and just somebody’s opinion. I’ve got to admit… once the episode finishes I try to go to bed but it’s really difficult to switch off. It is just haters but it’s very sad that people can be that nasty.”\n\nJanet also claimed that her past at ITV had little to do with Molly landing a coveted spot on the series.\n\n“I’ve had a couple of contracts doing small parts on Corrie and now I am friends with everybody? No… people don’t understand how these things work.”\n\n“She’s not a plant and she didn’t get in easily. She has worked hard and been through the same process as everybody else.” the mum-of-two explained.\n\nThe school teacher also denied that Molly’s time outside the villa after being eliminated gave her an advantage. Saying she wasn’t home for long, during her break from villa life: “I saw her for about six hours. I saw her in the morning, and she was getting a taxi back to the airport in the afternoon.”\n\n‘It always makes me giggle when people say that we saw each other because literally it was the fasted repacking, and she was off again.”\n\nContinuing: “Everyone said ‘she’s come out and she’s been able to watch it’… when? She didn’t have time to do anything like that. She had a little insight into it, but she didn’t sit down to watch any episodes.”\n\nJanet only appeared on the Manchester based soap three times in 2009.\n\nPrior to entering the Love Island villa, Molly had addressed her mum’s TV past.\n\nSpeaking with OK Magazine, the 21-year-old shared how her mum hadn’t given her any tips about being on screen.\n\nSaying: “She hasn’t given me any advice. She’s only done like small day player roles.”\n\nLove Island airs tonight at 9PM on Virgin Media Two and Virgin Media Player, proudly sponsored by Virgin Mobile\n\nLove Island content on Stellar.ie brought to you by Boots Ireland.\n\nBoots Ireland has recoupled with Love Island as the official Beauty Partner for the third season in a row and has stocked the villa with everything the Islanders need to Find The One."
