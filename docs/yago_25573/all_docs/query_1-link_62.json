        "text": "I had never heard of this late novel by Eudora Welty, though I love her short stories and enjoyed Delta Wedding and The Ponder Heart immensely. So I pounced on this thick brick of a Virago reprint with great anticipation.\n\nAfterwards, having finished the damn thing at a quarter to midnight after a week of hardly seeming to get any further into it than I had the night before, I’ve done a little reading around the subject. It seems that this is a great Southern novel from 1970, certainly part of the canon of modern Mississippi writing, with plenty of learned articles available that discuss its drafts, its themes, the representations of character and metaphor, and so on. So anything I say here is treading carefully around the US scholarship that already exists.\n\nI liked it a lot. It’s a gorgeous read, and utterly beguiling. It’s the story of two days of a family reunion in northeast Mississippi sometime in the 1930s. Welty’s descriptive writing, applied sparingly in this largely conversational novel, is absolutely beautiful. I was reading it in January and it felt, smelt and sounded like a sticky Delta summer.\n\nGranny Vaughn is 90 and her immense extended family are celebrating her birthday with her at her family farm. She lives there with her grand-daughter Miss Beulah Renfro, her husband Mr Ralph Renfro (partially disabled after messing about with dynamite on the farm), and their five children: three girls, Evie, Etoyle and Ella Fay, and two boys, Jack and Vaughn. Jack is the eldest son, nineteen years old, and is expected home today for the reunion, depsite the fact that he’s been in prison for an year and a half. His wife Gloria and his baby daughter Lady May also await him (he has not yet met his daughter). Trucks and cars full of happy chattering people arrive in clouds of dust (it is the first Sunday in August) bringing all the rest of the Vaughn family from all over the state, and one couple even come from Alabama. There will be well over fifty people there for the whole day and into the night, and Miss Beulah is prepared to feed them all.\n\nThis is a novel about belonging (to a family, to a county, to a district, to a school cohort) and resisting (assimilation, knowledge, dependence, instructions). It’s told mainly in conversation – raucous, bantering, tender, affectionate, spiky, malicious, teasing, joyful and pleading – between the twenty-eight speaking characters, and unwinds like a mass of unravelling wool, with loose ends being picked up and rewoven as new information is retrieved. The main secret to be revealed is who orphan Gloria’s parents are, and what that makes her, to her great distress: she wants to be unknown and independent, looking only to the future that she can build herself, only being part of her own family, without obligation or judgement. Other secrets to be unpicked are how Uncle Nathan lost his hand, what happened to Miss Beulah’s parents, the mystery of her dead youngest brother, Sam Dale, and why Miss Julia Mortimer has such a grip on the psyches of everyone in the county.\n\nThe scholarly writing about Losing Battles calls it a comedy and a comic classic: I really don’t think it’s that at all. It certainly has many moments of humour and is in no way a tragedy, but it’s got some pretty tough moments as well. Gloria is brought to the ground by a mass of the aunts who, laughing, cram her mouth with watermelon pieces in a grotesque initiation into the family, since they too have had to become Beechams and Vaughns and lose their own identities. The catty, sniping remarks of the massed school teachers at Miss Julia Mortimer’s funeral about the state of Jack and Gloria’s clothes reveal the prejudices and judgemental habits of the slightly better off and better educated about the people they are set in place to teach. The physical violence between Jack and his horrible friend and enemy Curly Stovell is entered into enthusiastically and thoughtlessly, like the clashing of two young bulls. Miss Lexie Renfro’s treatment of her patient Miss Julia, as the old retired teacher lapses into dementia, is plain cruel, only realised by the reader in retrospect as other facts are mentioned, like the doctor’s furious observation that Miss Julia died of starvation. And almost missed, in half a line of confession, is the false accusation and hanging of a black man for an old murder that he did not commit.\n\nSo what are the battles that were lost? Miss Julia Mortimer never managed to extend the minds and aspirations of her pupils. They all, mostly, just wanted to stay in Banner and Boone County and do what their families want them to do. Judge Moody failed to fulfill his academic promise and stayed in the county as a chief prosecutor, losing his battle with his old teacher. Gloria loses, for now, against the massed might of the Vaughn family, but as the new Renfro wife she has it in her to begin a new dynasty of her own. Granny is losing her battle with age, but she may have more secrets to reveal. And the battle against poverty and ignorance is a perpetual one.\n\nIt’s a tremendous read, though not, as I saw someone write on GoodReads, a novel for a long lazy summer’s day. I’d suggest instead a very long Bank Holiday weekend with no other commitments on your time. Losing Battles is excellent."
