        "text": "Obituary for Eddie Marsh, “Jack”\n\nDecember 14, 1930 — June 16, 2024\n\nDeacon, Eddie Marsh, “Jack,” was born into life on Dec. 14, 1930, to the late Augie and Idell (née Smith) Marsh. Jack departed into eternal life on June 16, 2024. Jack accepted Christ and never lost the love for Him in the 93 years he lived.\n\nOver 65 years ago, Idell Marsh moved her family to Racine. That is where Jack showed his love for cars. He worked at different car dealerships before landing his job at American Motors Co. from where he retired after working over 37 years.\n\nJack was the eldest of nine children and he played his role as big brother. Jack, along with his brother Frank, would always take their mother fishing – something he loved to do. Jack would make time for everyone. He and his wife, Ruby, took in a girl and raised her and later added two more. Yes, Jack did adore those girls even though he had three children of his own. He made sure that they were known.\n\nJack and Ruby did lots of things together. They loved the family reunions. For the most part, that held a very special place in his heart. He loved his wife ‘till death did them part. That took a toll on him from day one. All those around him noticed the change in him as his new life began.\n\nJack leaves to cherish his memories his son, Kenneth Posey of San Francisco, Calif.; daughters, Renee (LaVester) Williams and Mary D. Posey (Niecy) of Los Angeles, Calif.; brother; Frank (Phyliss) Marsh of Freeman Spur, Ill.; brother-in-law, Harvey Pittman; stepchildren, Willis and Gloria Kirby; Special Father Figure to Yolanda Lawson, Shanette (Pittman) Sanders and Lorretta Pittman; grandchildren, great-grandchildren, a host of nieces and nephews too numerous to mention by name, along with friends and church family.\n\nEddie Marsh was greeted in Heaven by his wife, Ruby Marsh; parents, Augie and Idell Marsh; brothers, Joseph, Bently and Lonnie Marsh; sisters, Ida Mae (Jacob) Lott, Mattie (Frank) Jones, Elsie (William) Roberson, Fareeda Dadzie; grandsons, Demetrius Posey, Alfonzo Spencer, Anthony W. First Jr. and Kentrall Brown.\n\nServices\n\nA Homegoing Service to celebrate Eddie’s life will be held at noon on June 27 at Greater Mount Eagle Baptist Church, 929 State St. Visitation will be from 11 a.m. until the time of service. Interment will follow at Graceland Cemetery.\n\nObituary and photo of Eddie Marsh courtesy of Draeger-Langendorf Funeral Home.\n\nLocal news\n\nThe Racine County Eye is your source for local news that serves our diverse communities.
