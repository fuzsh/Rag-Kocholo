        "text": "Author Q&A: Charles Marsh\n\nCharles Marsh grew up in a minister’s family in Alabama and Mississippi. He studied English literature and philosophy at Gordon College in Wenham, Mass., modern religious thought at Harvard Divinity School, and philosophical theology at the University of Virginia, where he received his doctorate. He is now the Commonwealth professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia. Before joining the UV faculty, Marsh was a member of the Theology Department at Loyola College in Maryland and served as the theologian-in-residence at the Episcopal Cathedral of the Incarnation in Baltimore.\n\nAmong his many books are “God’s Long Summer: Stories of Faith and Civil Rights,” which won the 1998 Grawemeyer Award in Religion, and “The Beloved Community: How Faith Shapes Social Justice from the Civil Rights Movement to Today.” He lives with his family in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nSigned copies of his newest work, “Strange Glory: A Life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer,” released last month by Knopf, are available at Lemuria Books in Jackson. The biography offers a fresh account of the life of one of the world’s most fascinating and admired theologians, courageously lived out in the backdrop of Nazi Germany during World War II.\n\nTell me about your ties to Mississippi.\n\nI lived in Laurel from 1967 to 1973, in the fourth through ninth grades. My father was the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Laurel. My parents are both from Jackson. My mom, the former Myra Toler, was Miss Central High 1953. Her father, my grandfather Kenneth Toler, was the Mississippi correspondent for the Memphis Commercial Appeal newspaper until his death in 1966. My parents have lived in Atlanta since 1978. He served for 15 years as senior pastor of the Second Ponce de Leon Baptist Church in Atlanta.\n\nIn my memoir, “The Last Days,” I recount stories of my childhood in Laurel amidst the whirlwind of enormous change in the first years of the 1970s. This coming-of-age story is set in the last days of the Jim Crow South as the son of a Southern Baptist minister in a town described by the FBI as the epicenter of Southern terrorism. In 1997, I completed the book, “God’s Long Summer: Stories of Faith and Civil Rights,” by Princeton University Press. During the civil right years, everywhere one turned, in every mass meeting, church service and Klan rally, God’s name was invoked and his power claimed. In “God’s Long Summer,” I tried to use my skills as a philosophical theologian to sort through these questions and paradoxes by telling the stories of five religious persons whose lives came into dramatic conflict during the civil rights movement.\n\nExplain the process in which you made the decision to write this biography.\n\nI began working on “Strange Glory” in the spring semester of 2007, when I served as the Dietrich Bonhoeffer Visiting Professor at Humboldt University in Berlin. At the Staatsbibliothek, the capacious city library, with the assistance of the director of special collections, I gained access to the Dietrich Bonhoeffer archives.\n\nThis collection, which had been recently obtained from the estate of Bonhoeffer’s biographer and dearest friend Eberhard Bethge, filled more than 25 cases and included lectures, letters, books, photographs, notebooks and journals. While many of the documents appeared in the 16-volume Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, the singularities of Bonhoeffer’s life, (such as) his registration papers for a new Audi convertible, a bank slip from the joint account he shared with Eberhard, numerous files of magazine articles and pamphlets on the American Negro and race relations in the U.S., inventories of his wardrobe and library, landscape photographs he took in North Africa, a postcard from Waco, Texas, a brief correspondence with Mahatma Gandhi — all of this illuminated an intriguingly different image than the one I had carried with me since writing a doctoral dissertation on his philosophical thought 25 years earlier.\n\nI wanted to tell the story afresh, as that of a deeply human figure and not merely just a saintly one, and to do so relying primarily on new archival discoveries, as well as interviews and primary documents.\n\nWhat would you like readers to take away from this book?\n\nI want the reader to be swept up into an engaging, and one would hope inspiring, narrative following the journey of this golden child of the Berlin Grunewald as he struggles under the impress of horrific historical events to see clearly, to act courageously and to live life to the fullest. I want the story to inspire and move, delight and surprise, but to appear finally as an artful telling of a beautiful life.\n\nExplain the meaning of the book’s title: “Strange Glory.”\n\n“It is a strange glory the glory of this God,” Bonhoeffer said in a posh London suburb. He meant by the word strange not weird but holy, transcendent. God’s transcendence dare not be domesticated, turned into an object or idea over which we can assume mastery or control. God’s righteousness cannot be reduced to our preferences and tastes.\n\nBonhoeffer remained critical of Christianity in America. Could you say a word about this?\n\nSuffice it to say, he was underwhelmed by what he experienced as the lack of intellectual seriousness among American Protestants. But despite his numerous grumblings over American Christianity, it is undeniable that Bonhoeffer was moved and inspired by the social theology of Reinhold Niebuhr and company, by theologians who . . . insisted that the enterprise of theology required maximum attention to race, politics, literature, social justice, citizenship and the complex realities of the day.\n\nHe would never again consider theology to be an activity confined to the academy, but part of the lived life in Christ.\n\nWhat role do you believe Bonhoeffer holds in the history of Christian theology?\n\nIn the decades since he was executed on Hitler’s orders for the crime of high treason in the concentration camp in Flossenburg on April 9, 1945, Bonhoeffer has become one of the most widely read and influential religious thinkers of our time.\n\nHis life and legacy have inspired campaigns for social justice, human and civil rights, and environmental activists.\n\nNo other Christian thinker crosses quite so many boundaries while yet remaining exuberantly — and, one should add — generously — Christian. His story brings together liberals and evangelicals, Catholics and Protestants, Christians and Jews, mystics, idealists, romanticists and activists in shared admiration of an indisputably authentic witness.\n\nHow did writing this book change you as a person of faith and scholar?\n\nEight years is a long time in anyone’s life ... but there’s no doubt that I have learned more fully what it means to borrow hope and to treasure the great gift that is, to cite a late poem by Bonhoeffer, the “quiet power of good,” the people who love you and care for you and help carry you along each day at a time.\n\n‘Strange Glory: A Life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer’ by Charles Marsh\n\nPublisher: New York: Knopf (2014)\n\nPages: 528"
