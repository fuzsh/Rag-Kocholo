        "text": "kids books about chores\n\nI picked the image above to head this post because it just made me laugh. The mom is doing her best to get the laundry on the line while the little girl is sitting there making a mess out of the clothes pins. I guess the reality of trying to clean up with kids in the house is timeless!\n\nIt wasn't until I was much older and well into my \"adult\" life that I learned how to clean. I certainly wasn't raised by my parents to know how, and I am not a naturally neat person. I read somewhere once that knowing how to properly clean our homes and do chores is one thing that is so important in our daily lives, and yet, very few of us we actually taught how to do it.\n\nI am trying to teach my kids how to clean up after themselves, and let me tell you, it is still a work in progress! I am choosing to believe that learning to pitch in with chores is a journey not a destination, and hopefully, my two kids are progressing on that journey. Some days I have my doubts.\n\nIf you are working with your littles to teach them how to clean up after themselves, here is the book list for you! I want to teach my kids not only so they can take care of themselves when they go out on their own, but also so they know that they are integral parts of our family who have the responsibility to help.\n\n*contains affiliated links\n\n1. How Do Dinosaurs Clean Their Room?\n\nWe love this series of hilarious \"how to\" books featuring parents and their sweet little dinosaurs! This one is all about how dinosaurs learn to clean up the house!\n\n2. Clean-Up Time\n\nThis board book is great for teaching toddlers how to pick up their toys and put them away with silly rhyming words that after a couple of reads, you will find yourself chanting every time it's clean-up time!\n\n3. Monster Mess!\n\nYou know your room is a mess when the monster that came to scare you at bedtime is grossed out by your messy room. That's bad, y'all. When this monster sneaks into a little boy's room, he doesn't like what he sees - toys everywhere, juice boxes on the floor, dirty clothes. He decides he has no other choice but to clean it all up while the boy sleeps.\n\n4. Time To Clean Up, Pick Up, and Recycle with The Berenstain Bears\n\nWhen the Bear family sees trash everywhere - at their local park, at home, and all around their city - they decide they have to do something about it. This book is about helping out and cleaning up but also about getting into the helping spirit to make the world better.\n\n5. Red Wagon\n\nWhen Lucy gets her very own red wagon, she wants to run off and play with it, but her mom wants her to use her wagon to help with chores like hauling groceries from the market. Lucy uses her imagination to make doing chores fun.\n\n6. Toby Counts His Marbles\n\nThis is part of an awesome series of books that follow Toby the Mouse. In this story, Toby wants to play with his marbles, but when he gets his marble box down from the shelf, it is empty! He didn't put his marbles away the last time that he played with them. Toby has to search for his marbles, counting them as he goes, and he learns that playtime goes more smoothly if you put your toys where they belong after playing.\n\n7. Whose Hands Are These? A Community Helper Guessing Book\n\nThis book is all about community helpers, be they police officers, firefighters, bakers, construction workers, doctors, or teachers. Community helpers make our towns better places to live. Learning to do chores to help your family when you're young may lead to a life spent helping others in you wider community.\n\n7 kids books about pumpkins!\n\nI love pumpkins! The plant nursery down the road from me sells all manner of seasonal squash from itty-bitty baby orange pumpkins to the whopper that I bought this year - a 40 pound giant white pumpkin. Every year when the nursery man starts stacking up corn stalks and hay bales, I know that it is almost pumpkin time!\n\nHave you carved your jack-o-lantern yet? It stays pretty warm and humid here in October, so we don't carve ours until the week of Halloween so that it doesn't get all moldy before the big night. Do you go all out with a carving kit and fancy designs or keep it simple? We usually keep it simple with the traditional triangle eyes and snaggle-tooth grin. Here are seven of our favorite pumpkin books.\n\nkids books about night time\n\nAre your kids afraid of the dark? Scared of going to sleep at bedtime? Night time doesn't need to be scary. There is so much about the night that is special - a silvery full moon, the distant sound of a hooting owl, looking up into the sky to name the different constellations visible on a clear night. Here is a list of books that will help little readers ease into appreciation of night time.\n\n*contains affiliate links\n\n12 kids books about ballet!\n\nThere is something about that perfect shade of ballet pink that makes me happy. It reminds me of the years I spent in dance class as a kid. I loved it! When I was searching for books to put in this list, it made me really happy to find a level of diversity that I might not have found five years ago. I'm especially excited about the picture book biography of ballet super-star, Misty Copeland. I'm so glad kids can read about the barriers she has busted down!\n\n10 kids books about mice!\n\nHi there! Welcome to Booktomato today! There are so many classic mousey book characters, so this is not even close to a conclusive list. However, here are a few of our favorite picture books and early chapter books about those cheese-loving, whisker-twitching, furry friends - mice!\n\nkids books about the desert\n\n**this post contains affiliate links which means I might get a small fee at no cost to you if you purchase something. It doesn't affect my book pick opinions. Thanks for supporting my blog!\n\nWe are currently driving our way through the Arizona desert on what can only be described as a Griswald family vacation. We live in Memphis, TN, so for us, that means twenty plus hours in the car! Guys, GUYS, that's a lot of togetherness. We are falling in love with the desert way of life here in Arizona. We have seen beautifuland towering red rock formations, cacti, the beating hot sun, and fascinating Native American culture.\n\nHere is the perfect reading list for learning all about the desert and the people and animals that call this place home!\n\n7 kids books about trucks!\n\nHi there! Happy Wednesday to you, and thanks for stopping by today. I think every little kid, especially every little boy, goes through a vehicle phase where every garbage truck, cement mixer, school bus, train, eighteen wheeler, and construction truck elicits a cheer from a kid. Here are seven great reads for the truck fan in your life!\n\n7 kids books about chess\n\nMy older son is a part of his chess team at school, and he has learned so much from participating in the tournaments - sportsmanship, challenging yourself, confidence, social skills. It has been a really valuable experience for him, and he can now officially whoop any family member any day of the week in a round of chess.\n\nIf you know a young reader interested in the game, this book list would be a great place to start!\n\n11 kids books about rainy days\n\nCall me crazy, but I just love a good dreary day, I crave cool weather, drizzling rain, good socks, good tea, good books. This time of year when winter transitions into spring tends to bring a good bit of rain, and just because the weather is wet doesn't mean that all the fun needs to happen indoors! A rainy day can be one of the best times to play outside as long as sturdy rain boots can be found.\n\nHere are eleven great picture books celebrating rainy day fun. Do you have any to add to the list?\n\nkids books about hot chocolate!\n\nDo you have a favorite hot chocolate recipe? There is no such thing as bad hot chocolate! From fancy French style with imported chocolate in fine bone china to a packet of Swiss Miss in a paper cup, I love it all. Nothing is better than coming in from the cold with rosy cheeks and a frozen nose, and stirring up a nice warm mug of hot chocolate.\n\nHere is our list for the best kid's books about hot chocolate!\n\nkids books about christmas trees!\n\n**This post contains affiliated links which means that when you purchase something here, Booktomato gets a small fee. However, the book talk here is only the opinion of us here on this blog. Thanks for supporting businesses that keep us going!\n\nHave you gotten your tree yet? What are your Christmas tree traditions? We have a \"fake\" tree that I put up each year, and I love it because it is so easy. I do miss that lovely pine smell though. Last year, I tried to get that aroma with a pine-scented candle, but it just wasn't the same. This year I decided to get two little real tree to put in my kids' bedroom and my bedroom. I get my tree smell, and my kids think I'm pretty cool for letting them have a tree in their room. (Getting your kids to think you are cool isn't something that happens every day. It's a Christmas miracle!)\n\nHere is our list of books about Christmas trees that we love. After putting up the decorations, we will read one by the twinkling lights of the tree.\n\nthe weekend roundup!\n\nWhat are you up to this weekend? My fourth grader has a chess tournament today, and honestly, I love that he gets the experience but I kind of dread them. They last for hours and hours and usually I have my four year old in tow. For some reason, watching people play chess in silence for six hours isn't his idea of a good time. BUT . . . Today I am not secretly dreading the chess tournament because it is being hosted by our city's annual India Festival! My fourth grader can play chess while we while away the hours shopping through the colorful wares and filling our bellies with awesome Indian food. Win/Win!\n\nThere were some interesting kid's book reviews around the web this week. Here is a selection for your perusal. Have a great weekend!\n\nKids Book Review shares a well-illustrated new edition of a classic tale - The Pied Pipper, and here is their review of a fabulous looking new book, A Most Magical Girl.\n\nA Kids Book A Day writes about a picture book for upper elementary school kids that deals with nature conservation called The Tragic Tale of the Great Auk by Jan Thornhill.\n\nEvery year, Pragmatic Mom partners with bloggers to bring us Multicultural Children's Book Day. This year, it will be on January 27, 2017. Here is the poster for this year.\n\n9 books about monsters!\n\nHi there and welcome to the first Monday in October! Woohoo! October is the best, and we are kicking off our favorite month with a book list with a spooky theme - monsters!\n\nHere are nine of the best books about there for ghouls, goblins, and creatures from the dark side. Enjoy!\n\n7 kids books about fall leaves!\n\nWhat is more iconic of the season than beautifully colored fall leaves? They fill the senses - the bright oranges and reds and golds delight our eyes, the crunch underfoot satisfy our ears. When I was growing up on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, I had never seen real fall leaves. My family didn't do much travelling to other areas, and we lived so far south that leaves stayed green all year. It was only when I went to college seven hours north that I saw what I had just seen in picture books. Fall leaves! It made me so happy!\n\nHere are seven wonderful picture books about beloved fall leaves. Please to enjoy!\n\n10 kids books about school buses!\n\nHappy Monday! My kids are at school. I'm doing the dishes and vacuuming the floor while listening to some of my favorite podcasts. Do you have a favorite podcast? I try to save some of my faves for when I clean the house to motivate my to clean the house because I don't exactly love to dust and scrub!\n\nI put together this list with back-to-school kids in mind, and I never realized how many classic books that we love revolve around school buses! When my younger son was just starting to talk, he went through a school bus phase and would scream \"bus! bus!\" from his car seat whenever one passed us on the road. School buses are nostalgic and cheerful with their sunny yellow paint job and wheels that go round and round. Is your favorite bus book missing from the list? Let me know!\n\n9 books my 9 year old loved this year\n\nMy third grader is an avid reader. What he likes: books that are not too scary, characters that are kind and funny, comics, Pokemon, stories about friendship.\n\n9. Adventures with Waffles\n\nWe both absolutely loved this one! The characters are nine as well, and he liked that. It's the story of a girl named Lena and a boy named Trille in a small town in Norway. They are best friends and constantly getting into mischief that sends the reader into belly laughs. Mixed with the fun are more serious issues like Lena really wanting a dad and the loss of Trille's grandmother.\n\nAdventures with Waffles\n\nBy Maria Parr\n\n8. Dear Mr. Henshaw\n\nWe have shared our love of this book on the blog before. He read this with his class, and it inspired him to start writing.\n\nDear Mr. Henshaw\n\nBy Beverly Cleary\n\n7. Anything by Roald Dahl!\n\nYou can't go wrong with any of his books - James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Witches, so many more good ones!\n\n6. Misty of Chincoteague\n\nThis classic story of a island of wild horses and the kids who are fascinated by them is great.\n\nMisty of Chincoteague\n\nBy Marguerite Henry\n\n5. Any Pokemon guide\n\nReading is reading is reading, and while Shakespeare this ain't, he really loves it. I get to hear about all things Pokemon, and I now know way more about ways a grass type Pokemon can defeat a water type Pokemon. On the other hand, this book right here has bought me many hours of entertaining him.\n\n4. The Frank Einstein series\n\nWe have all three of this series, and we both love the combination of humor and science.\n\n3. The Secret Garden\n\nWhen I heard that he was reading this one with his class, I was skeptical that he would enjoy it. It was written a long time ago, and the language can be somewhat outdated. But believe it or not, he came home every day with something new to say about the book. It really held his attention.\n\nThe Secret Garden\n\nBy Frances Hodgson Burnett\n\n2. The Penderwicks series\n\nThese tales of sisters who go on adventures, get into trouble, build strong friendships, and love each other very much is right up his alley because it is not too intense but remains exciting and engaging while being lighthearted at the same time.\n\n1. What we are reading now: Fortunately, The Milk\n\nThis is quirky, unusual, and fascinating with everything you would expect from Gaiman.\n\nFortunately, the Milk\n\nBy Neil Gaiman\n\nhappy monday!\n\nHi there!
