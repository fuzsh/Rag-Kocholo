        "text": "Jenny Ann (Marsh) Minich, 42, of La Porte, Indiana, went home to be with Jesus, her Lord and Savior, on June 14, 2024.\n\nJenny was born on November 16, 1981, in La Porte, Indiana, to John and Debra (Ferguson) Marsh.\n\nOn August 28, 2004, she married Andrew Minich who survives. Also surviving are her 2 children, Ella and Wesley Minich, both of La Porte; parents, John and Debra Marsh of Hamlet; 3 sisters, Mindy (Jason) Heidel of Valparaiso, Laurie (Derek) Frazier of Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Katie Marsh of La Porte; as well as several nieces and nephews, whom Jenny adored.\n\nJenny was loved by all who had the pleasure of knowing her. Her heart was full of love and compassion in everything she did. Kind, beautiful, and loving do not begin to describe the amazing person she was.\n\nHer greatest loves were her children, Ella and Wes; her family; her many friends; and her school children.\n\nJenny enjoyed growing flowers and creating beautiful bouquets through the U-Pick flower business she created, Minich Farms Flower Patch.\n\nShe loved caring for the baby goats that they raised on their farm. Jenny loved the time she spent with her children on their 4-H goat projects. Yearly, she looked forward to meeting new and old friends at the fair. She, Ella, and Wes were all 10-year 4-H members.\n\nOne of her greatest joys was hosting all of Ella and Wes' fun-loving friends frequently at their home. She took great joy in watching all the fun shenanigans they came up with.\n\nShe loved teaching students at South Central School, as their library/media and STEM Specialist, using the latest hands-on technology. She made learning fun. The students adored her.\n\nJenny also worked at the La Porte County Public Library in the mobile classroom, makerspace, and community outreach. Seeing kids learn and discover brought her so much joy.\n\nShe was very active in her community. Jenny was a member of the La Porte Co. Purdue Extension Board, Tri Kappa, Kingsbury Cemetery Board, and was a former Children's Director at Vineyard Church, to name a few.\n\nJenny was a ray of sunshine wherever she went. She had many friends whom she loved and supported. Jenny's crowning glory are the two amazing children she raised.\n\nA Celebration of Life Service will be held at 11 a.m. on Friday, June 21, 2024, at Cutler Funeral Home and Cremation Center with Pastor Jeff Hines officiating. Burial will follow at Kingsbury Cemetery.\n\nA time of visitation will be held from 4 - 8 p.m. on Thursday, June 20, 2024, and from 10 a.m. until the time of the service on Friday at the funeral home.\n\nMemorial donations may be made to South Central Schools, c/o Jenny Minich Memorial Fund, 9808 S. 600 West, Union Mills, IN, 46382 or donor's choice.\n\nCondolences may be shared with the family on www.cutlercares.com.\n\nTo order memorial trees or send flowers to the family in memory of Jenny Ann Minich, please visit our flower store."
