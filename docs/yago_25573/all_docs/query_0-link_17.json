In 1986, Adam hired a thug to shoot which person?\n\nAnswer: Palmer Cortlandt\n\nAdam and Palmer's legendary feud came to a boiling point in 1986 when Adam hired someone to take aim at his nemesis. Unfortunate for Adam, Palmer survived the hit he put out on him. However, this resulted in Palmer being temporarily paralyzed from the waist down.\n\n2. In 1986, Adam paid Natalie to spy on whom?\n\nAnswer: Palmer Cortlandt\n\nRight after Palmer was wheelchair bound due to injuries sustained from a gunshot wound, Natalie was hired to be his nurse. Adam and Natalie interacted at this time and he persuaded her to spy on him. However, this did not do much good for Adam since Palmer and Natalie fell in love and married shortly afterwards.\n\n3. In 1984, Adam faked his own death to test Erica Kane. While Adam was \"dead\", Erica became romantically linked to which man?\n\nAnswer: Mike Roy\n\nShortly after Adam walked down the aisle with Erica in 1984,he came up with a ruse to see if she proved herself worthy to him. He faked his own demise in order to see if Erica would move on with another man. Sure enough, Erica the temptress found solace in Mike Roy's arms but their romance was short lived when Adam returned from the dead.\n\n4. Adam also did another faking when he faked his kidnapping in 1994. This time, he did such to test whose loyalty?\n\nAnswer: Gloria Marsh\n\nAdam and Gloria married in 1993 but trouble would soon brew approximately one year later when Adam plotted another devious scheme. This time, he faked his own kidnapping to test Gloria. Gloria found out about this and humiliated Adam when she dumped him at the altar when they went to renew their vows. It was at this event that the first scripted tornado struck town.\n\n5. In early 1991, Adam stole a lot of money from whom?\n\nAnswer: Natalie Marlowe\n\nAdam and Natalie were married midway through 1990 but things hit the skids when Adam started plotting to swindle her out of her fortune.
