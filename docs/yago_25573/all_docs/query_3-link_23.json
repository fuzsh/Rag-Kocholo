Jack accepted Christ and never lost the love for Him in the 93 years he lived.\n\nOver 65 years ago, Idell Marsh moved her family to Racine, WI. That is where Jack showed his love for cars. He worked at different car dealerships before landing his job at American Motors Co. from where he retired after working over 37 years. Jack was the eldest of nine children and he played his role as big brother. Jack, along with his brother Frank, would always take their mother fishing – something he loved to do. Jack would make time for everyone. He and his wife, Ruby, took in a girl and raised her and later added two more. Yes, Jack did adore those girls even though he had three children of his own. He made sure that they were known.dJack and Ruby did lots of things together. They loved the family reunions. For the most part, that held a very special place in his heart. He loved his wife ‘till death did them part. That took a toll on him from day one. All those around him noticed the change in him as his new life began.\n\nJack leaves to cherish his memories, son, Kenneth Posey of San Francisco, CA; daughters, Renee (LaVester) Williams and Mary D. Posey (Niecy) of Los Angeles, CA; brother; Frank (Phyliss) Marsh of Freeman Spur, IL; brother-in-law, Harvey Pittman; stepchildren, Willis and Gloria Kirby; Special Father Figure to Yolanda Lawson, Shanette (Pittman) Sanders and Lorretta Pittman; grandchildren, great-grandchildren, a host of nieces and nephews too numerous to mention by name along with friends and church family.\n\nEddie (Jack) Marsh was greeted in Heaven by his wife, Ruby Marsh; parents, Augie and Idell Marsh; brothers, Joseph, Bently and Lonnie Marsh; sisters, Ida Mae (Jacob) Lott, Mattie (Frank) Jones, Elsie (William) Roberson, Fareeda Dadzie; grandsons, Demetrius Posey, Alfonzo Spencer, Anthony W.
