When Adam and Stuart came to town in 1983, it was established that they were identical twin brothers.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nAdam and Stuart arrived in Pine Valley sometime during 1983 after having departed West Virginia. It was revealed that the two had a unique relationship since they were twin brothers. David Canary portrayed both roles for his entire run on \"All My Children\".\n\n2. In their first few years in Pine Valley, Adam and Stuart often had many bonding moments with Stuart's wife. Who was Stuart's wife during this time?\n\nAnswer: Joanna Yeager\n\nStuart had initially been hiding in the west wing of Chandler Mansion but eventually came out from that hollow place. He had gotten married within the first few years he stayed in Pine Valley to a woman named Joanna Yeager. Adam and Stuart enjoyed many happy moments during this period but Joanna's craziness after a couple years influenced Stuart to divorce her.\n\n3. Adam initially disliked Stuart's relationship with Cindy Parker due to her having AIDS. However, he grew to accept Cindy, which pleased Stuart and strengthened their sibling bond.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nWhen Cindy Parker came to town after having contracted AIDS through her ex-husband, Adam expressed dismay at Stuart's closeness to her. It was after Stuart married Cindy where Adam changed his mind and bonded with his sister-in-law. Adam embraced Stuart immediately after Cindy passed away from AIDS complications. For their work in the AIDS storyline, David Canary (Adam/Stuart) and Ellen Wheeler (Cindy) earned Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Lead Actor and Outstanding Supporting Actress, respectively.\n\nMany fans consider the Cindy battling AIDS story one of the best socially relevant plots which \"All My Children\" ever told, both for the responsible writing and its being told during the AIDS epidemic scare sweeping across America at the time.\n\n4. Adam and Stuart had a tradition to go to Canada every year over what sport?\n\nAnswer: Fishing\n\nAdam and Stuart often throughout the years spoke about during the summer going to Canada for an annual fishing trip. Eventually, Stuart's son and therefore Adam's nephew, Scott, would accompany them. However, \"AMC\" did not ever show the two on their annual fishing trips despite the frequency with which this occurred.\n\n5. Adam was so proud of Stuart when he and Marian wed in 1999. At their wedding, Stuart and Marian dressed up as which of these?\n\nAnswer: King and Queen\n\nStuart and Marian delighted many \"AMC\" fans during the storyline featured during 1998 (to some fans, it was the only good part of an otherwise bad year) that their Valentine's Day wedding in 1999 provided much reason to celebrate. Despite a blizzard hitting town, Stuart and Marian were not ready to let Mother Nature disrupt their blessed day. Adam and Liza also planned on marrying at this event but complications prevented that from happening.\n\nHowever, Stuart and Marian dressed up as King and Queen to exchange vows.\n\n6. Adam and Stuart's memories were not always happy. During the spring of 2000, where did Stuart confess to Adam that they could not be brothers again due to Adam having hurt Marian?\n\nAnswer: Oakhaven\n\nStuart had heard that Adam arranged for Marian to be drugged by someone to make it look like she cheated on him. After Adam had been committed to Oakhaven, Stuart confronted him there and Adam confessed his role in the ruse. Stuart tearfully told him they could no longer be brothers.\n\nHowever, approximately six months later, Adam and Stuart made up after Stuart got Adam to awaken from his coma.\n\n7. In September of 2011, Adam was relieved to see that Stuart had been brought back from the dead. He watched as Stuart and Marian reunited at Pine Valley Hospital, as did who else?\n\nAnswer: Scott Chandler\n\nDavid had a major surprise when he revealed that one of his Project Orpheus patients was a very much alive Stuart. Adam raced over to watch his brother awaken and embraced him since he had not been the same ever since shooting Stuart. Scott also loved seeing Stuart back alive and raced to get Marian.\n\nIn the show's final episode, Stuart and Marian shared a tearjerking reunion where Scott and Adam happily looked at the happy couple back together again.\n\n8. Adam and Stuart had an unusual event happen to them: they both fought over the same woman throughout 1993. Which woman?\n\nAnswer: Gloria Marsh\n\nWhile Adam has had numerous wives over the years, Stuart has had a habit of not battling his brother for a woman's affections. The one exception to this was when the two brothers squared off over the beautiful Gloria Marsh. Gloria ended up choosing Adam but, despite a rough patch, remained on friendly terms with Stuart.\n\n9.

Both the men thought this was wrong and banded together to get Michael reinstated. They thought not only should his sexual orientation matter but appreciated how much Scott had learned in his course.\n\n10. One day in the spring of 2002, Adam and Stuart prayed that which person would come through a surgery okay?\n\nAnswer: Liza Colby\n\nLiza had been diagnosed with a brain tumor and her physician instructed her about getting rid of it with surgery. After the surgical operation was complete, Stuart found Adam in the hospital chapel since he feared that Liza might have some damaging side effects. Stuart asked Adam to pray with him that Liza would be just fine.\n\nThe two prayed inside the chapel until they awaited word from the doctor.\n\nSource: Author CAGuy0206\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor Gamemaster1967 before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
