The purpose of these investigations is to determine the cause and manner of death and also to consider ways that similar deaths may be prevented in the future.\n\nWestern Australian Courts and Tribunals Reconciliation Statement and Video\n\nThe Coroner’s responsibility\n\nIn Western Australia, special categories of death must be reported to the court. These are called ‘reportable deaths’.\n\nUnder the Coroners Act 1996, when a death is reported, a coroner investigating death must find, if possible:\n\nThe identity of the deceased;\n\nHow the death occurred;\n\nThe cause of death, and\n\nThe particulars needed to register the death under the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1998.\n\nIn some cases, following an inquest, a coroner may comment and make recommendations about public health or safety or the administration of justice aimed at preventing similar deaths from happening in the future.\n\nThe Coroner's Court of Western Australia understands the impact coronial investigations may have on family and friends. To assist people in this situation the court has Counselling Service which can help by providing information on the coronial process and making referrals to external counselling and support agencies who can assist with issues surrounding grief and loss.\n\nPublic Notices"
