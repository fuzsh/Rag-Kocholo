        "text": "Julius Caesar Studer, rancher, the son of Ben and Elsie Studer, was born on May 24, 1863, in Kastenholtz, Switzerland. In 1867 the family immigrated to America and settled in a Swiss colony near Tracy City, Tennessee. There Studer hired out as a farmhand at the age of ten, and at thirteen he apprenticed himself to a carriage maker in Grundy County. In 1885, shortly before his nineteenth birthday, he moved to Kiowa, Kansas, where he worked as a railroad machinist and blacksmith.\n\nJulius Caesar Born was born in Tennessee on May 24, 1879. He came to Canadian on March 6, 1897, not quite 18 years of age. He had worked in the mines of Tennessee for 60 cents a day, been buried alive during a mine cave-in and given up for dead. He was unconscious when dug out. Canadian must have seemed like a significant improvement.\n\nIn 1900, he was working for the Santa Fe Railroad as a section hand at the old coal chute when track work was slack. He came to Canadian in 1897; after a temporary move to Oklahoma, he returned to Canadian and opened a general store on March 5, 1905, at 215 Main, with exactly 75 cents operating capital. He borrowed $8 to start the business and had 6 bits left after paying the drayman for his load of merchandise. He operated this store for over 50 years and lived in the back.\n\nE.E. Polly came to the Panhandle in 1873 from Kansas. He had served in the cavalry during the Civil War and continued in a career with the Army after the war. He served as a hospital steward then druggist in Kansas. He learned about medicine which was more than useful when he came to the Panhandle and he became known to the Indians as a “medicine man”.\n\nJohnnie Chambers was born near Granville, Texas in 1860. After being orphaned young, he and his sister were raised by their grandparents. By the age of 14, he quit school and went to work as a cowboy in the wild Indian country that was then the Panhandle of Texas. He worked on cattle drives to Dodge, Kansas and ultimately was hired by Dave Hargrave in 1883 to work on the Springer Ranch near Canadian.\n\nCharlie, as he was called, came to Canadian in 1900. He was born in Virginia in 1868 and in his youth, attended the Cincinnati School of Embalming and had an Ohio license since 1888. On his way to Nevada, he stopped in Canadian to visit his brother, Harry who had come to Canadian for his health in 1898. Charlie liked the country and decided to stay and worked on his uncle, Vas Stickley’s ranch."
