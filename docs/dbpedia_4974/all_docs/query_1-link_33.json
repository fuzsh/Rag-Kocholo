        "text": "No more refugee camps\n\nHello praying friends, Warm greetings to you all from those of us here in Ashdod! As I look back on this past week, I find myself wondering how it is that time seems to pass so quickly here at Shevet. Our days are full and often very busy and this past week has been no… Read more »\n\nWhat we are waiting for\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. We were blessed this week by the arrival of our sister Christine from the USA, just when we were down to only five coworkers in Ashdod. Christine is short-term, here for a week, but she’s already been a great help to the community. Yesterday… Read more »\n\nA week of high emotion\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. Last week I wrote at length about Shevet’s constant reiterations. That message has immediately become relevant as our community has abruptly–though expectedly–halved in size, and so become new yet again. At the beginning of the week, I took brother Max to the airport at… Read more »\n\nUnjustifiable love\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. Those of you who’ve read my past letters know that I often reflect on the transience of Shevet Achim communities. The children change; the countries we work with change; the hospitals change; the volunteers change; our homes change. And every time one of those… Read more »\n\nSeeds scattered, seeds sown\n\nDear praying friends, Greetings from our scattered community in Ashdod and further afield! This week our four coworkers Beth, Bethany, Max and Zech left for England for coaching from our longtime friends at Split Rock, with a focus on attaining unity even with all our God-given differences. We pray this would be a transformative time both individually… Read more »\n\nWe will see her again\n\nHello friends, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. Heavy on our hearts this morning is the passing of Eva. Zechariah got news very early that Eva was deteriorating, and he and Beth quickly went to the hospital to be with Eva and her mother. Eva’s pressures had begun to drop and the doctors said… Read more »\n\nSmall moments lead to special moments\n\nDear friends, brothers, and sisters, Last week we saw both a beginning and an end, as one child returned to Kurdistan and two more joined us in her place. Both of these events are a joy to us, seeing God’s labor come to fruition as a child leaves healthier than when they arrived, and meeting… Read more »\n\nSigns of deliverance\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. At the front of our hearts and prayers this week is Eva, who continues to endure great hardship. We shared in the Sunday letter about Eva’s improving oxygen levels, and indeed, her stats continued getting better and better as the week progressed, although she… Read more »\n\nWaiting for transformation\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. After a month spent in the United States, I’ve finally returned to Israel. Being back with Shevet feels simultaneously foreign and familiar; but this is often what happens when you take time away from a place like this. The routines remain largely the same—despite… Read more »\n\nWho is my neighbor?\n\nHello friends and family, After many early mornings and late nights, friends reunited along with friends leaving, and tears shed together, God has brought us to the end of the week without even the taste of defeat or disappointment! We are spending more and more time in prayer each week, and as we reflect on… Read more »\n\nStrength will rise\n\nDear praying team, This week our community has been encouraged and challenged to persist in praying and to rejoice in answered prayers. We have been blessed by seeing God’s faithfulness in many ways, answering prayers both asked and unasked. We have begun a small board to spur us on in prayer and encourage us by… Read more »\n\nUniting us and changing our hearts\n\nHello brothers and sisters in the Messiah, Our Father continues to bless us as his children with the same spirit given around this time nearly two thousand years ago, and for this we are grateful and rejoice. What has sat on the heart of our community since word reached us in the middle of our… Read more »\n\nAll getting along together\n\nHello friends, We are thankful for the work of God’s Spirit, placing Gentile and Jewish believers together as living stones “being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.” We are also thankful for all of you laboring in prayer with us, and together we can rejoice in the fruit that God is bearing… Read more »\n\nFear and encouragement\n\nFriends, We have experienced a time of blessing in the past week and lift praise to Him with all who join us in prayer. We say with Elizabeth when she conceived John the Baptist: Look what the Lord has done! We had a few appointments at Sheba Medical Center this week and are gearing up for more in… Read more »\n\nDoing a good work\n\nHello friends and coworkers, Greetings from our community in Ashdod. We praise God for another week of walking in his way and partnering with him in the good work he is doing here. We are back to having just two children in our family house, Eva and Sohaib, and we all miss the loud and… Read more »\n\nThrow away the leaven\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. This is the week of Passover, and so alongside our neighbors we spent Monday in a frenzy of cleaning and preparing. We threw out all the leaven and leavened foods we had, arranging our home as a clean space ready for renewal. This can be… Read more »\n\nForward onto stormy waters\n\nFriends, We are coming to the conclusion of another week spent in faith and service to and through the Messiah, and we see the fruits of it, as well as the next challenges to come from it. We seek God daily in prayer, and looking back and looking forward we see a lot to lift up in… Read more »\n\nOur shared unworthiness\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. I write to you at the end of a week of transition. On Sunday we decided, after many weeks of deliberation, to go ahead with leaving our home in Jerusalem. The bulk of our work in these last few days was thus spent packing… Read more »\n\nThe most unexpected people\n\nFriends and coworkers, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. This last week has seen many changes in our community, many blessings from God and difficult goodbyes to some of our beloved families and coworkers. We were in the hospital only one time this week, which allowed for extended time on house projects and cleaning…. Read more »\n\nA piggyback ride\n\nDear friends and coworkers, Like last week, this week gave us few new actions and events, but we do not take this as a bad thing by any means. It allows us to spend more time building relationships with families, exploring and getting to know our local community, and becoming more attuned and connected to… Read more »\n\nTo see with softened eyes\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. I write to you at the end of the quietest week I’ve had here in my time at Shevet Achim. In the entire week we only went to the hospital twice. The rest of our time was spent cleaning, organizing, and dwelling; we spent… Read more »\n\nWe wait on the Lord\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. If there is anything the Father teaches us over and over again in our work here, it is humility; to not put too much stock in our own fragile plans, but rather to trust him to carry us through. Last week I wrote that… Read more »\n\nA time of transition\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. For all the busy weeks there is occasionally a quiet week, and such was this. We had little work and few appointments, allowing us greater leisure—though here at the tail end of it I’ve found myself rather sick, and so this prayer update will… Read more »\n\nThe path set before us\n\nDear friends, Each week so many challenges are unforeseen to us, from late-night ER trips to extended hospital stays to last-minute trips to Jerusalem. We can’t make a schedule for the week and expect it to stay the same, but we can sit at the end of the week and look back to see what… Read more »\n\nFrom a coffin to a cradle\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. Early Tuesday morning I was woken up by a phone call from the hospital telling me that Mohammed had died. At around 2:30 am his heart rate began to plummet, and he died about ten minutes later. Mohammed’s mother called me and wailed in… Read more »\n\nGrief and joy together\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. Despite our prayer and the best efforts of the doctors, Mohammed’s health deteriorated this week. His kidneys and liver are non-functional, and doctors fear they will not recover. Mohammed’s head has also begun to fill with water, leaving reduced room for blood flow, which… Read more »\n\nBlessings and burdens\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. It has been another long week full of blessings and burdens. I spent half of it sick and the other half weakened. We maneuvered crises and uncertainties and spent long hours in the hospitals. And now at last we come to the end of… Read more »\n\nEars to hear\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. There is little consistency to our work here from week to week. Some are busy, some are slow. This week was a slow week, and for most of it a quiet one; half of our days in the hospital, we had no appointments and… Read more »\n\nFueled with love\n\nDear friends, As a reed swayed by the wind, our work changes seemingly on a whim sometimes; this week we went from praise for blessings and resting in (relative) peace to handling emergency after emergency and hardships and surprises alike. I cannot find any prayer leaving my lips before a prayer for Mohammed, who in the… Read more »\n\nOur eyes upon heaven\n\nDear friends, Though the world is changing, we still find our work being accomplished and completed as it always has been. The tasks, procedures, and goals may slightly evolve, but they do not change: to show beautiful, unconditional love to those wonderful children made in God’s image. This week we have witnessed many blessings, chief… Read more »\n\nIf this is how it ends\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. It has been another long week here at Shevet, marked by early mornings and late night; it has also been marked by rain. Over the last few days Israel’s rainy season has picked up tempo, such tempo that we’re beginning to have some water… Read more »\n\nComing above ground again\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. We have mentioned several times in this letter that the Sheba ICU moved to an underground bunker; called “The Tank” by the staff, it has been a dreary and stifling place, difficult to both live in and to visit. But this week, after nearly three… Read more »\n\nThe gift of community\n\nSeason’s Greetings, Shevet friends and family. As we went through Christmas in Israel, we were continually reminded of the blessings of the season. Not only the greatest gift, a baby wrapped in cloths given to us on a silent starry night. But also the fruits of this gift: community and fellowship, life and relationship, support… Read more »\n\nThe weary world rejoices\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. When I last wrote, I mentioned that Beth and Max were setting up our Christmas tree. Here it is, adorned in all its splendor: The Christmas spirit has been slowly rising in our community here in Ashdod. Sunhwa and I, when playing our respective… Read more »\n\nOn our feet once again\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. Shevet Achim changes very often. Its framework remains constant thanks to the presence of my father; but the pieces—the people—that make up that framework are constantly being flipped, swapped, shuffled, replaced. Two weeks ago, we said goodbye to Donna and Grace, and this week… Read more »\n\nTaking a deep breath\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. After another long week of labors, we come again to the eve of the Shabbat. We sit; we settle; we breathe. Although our community technically takes both Friday and Saturday off from work, as do most of our Israeli neighbors, our tasks usually bleed… Read more »\n\nYou do not need to be afraid anymore\n\nFriends, As Shabbat is beginning we and the families ran to our safe rooms, as with the end of the cease-fire our section of Ashdod came under heavy rocket bombardment from Gaza; our coworker Matt carried Asmeen to safety while she was still sleeping: After a week-long break from hard times, it seems the chaos… Read more »\n\nThe result of giving\n\nDear friends, While last week was quite restful for everyone, this week truly tested us at certain points, as we were confronted with children in difficult recovery, staff leaving, extreme weather, and three Gaza families settling into their new Bethlehem home. Praise God, year-old Lya from Kurdistan made it safely to Israel Sunday morning, stable all the… Read more »\n\nLonging for his return\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. The past week has largely been a time of rest (though I was sick for most of it). Our days were quieter, and with a surplus of workers, we took some welcome deep breaths. Not all of us got to be so relaxed though;… Read more »\n\nAll I have left in the world\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. Those of you who read this letter probably also read my father’s Sunday letter; if so you are aware of the tragic death of Um Naim’s children in Gaza, killed in an airstrike last Sunday. Her loss shaped this week for us all. It has… Read more »\n\nDo we have strength for this?\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. About a month and a half ago, I mentioned to my father my frustration with the lack of “seasons” in Shevet. We always had different children and different challenges, but the general work of Shevet never changed. We—or at least I—never had a sense… Read more »\n\nAny hurtful way in me\n\nHello friends, As our world is flipped upside down, many people find themselves in new positions, something they never prepared for, and completely lost and left to simply wait and pray. All of our families from Gaza who were in Israel for treatment on October 7 are stuck here in light of the horrific attacks… Read more »\n\nJews and Muslims pray together over baby’s life\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. Since last week’s update, the “us” that makes up Shevet Ashdod has dwindled severely. Due to the war coworkers were called back to their home countries until only Max, Keyla, and myself remained—and the three of us continued in our work. And work there… Read more »\n\nGrace will lead us home\n\nFriends, It’s a strange thing how quickly the little worlds we build around us can go to pieces. The plans we make, the pillars of stability we take for granted, the things we depend on without even realizing it, can all turn to dust before our eyes before we even have time to register what… Read more »\n\nSee the light and follow it\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. Lately we’ve been studying through the Apostle Paul’s letters to Timothy and Titus. They are rich letters of focused instruction; in them, Paul teaches his “true sons in the faith” how to lead the community of believers. And the idea repeated in them over… Read more »\n\nRecoveries fast and slow\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. I am, regretfully, tremendously ill as I write this letter (please pray for me), and so it will be brief. This week we assembled our Sukkah, in preparation for the holy week of Sukkot, and we will spend the rest of the week eating… Read more »\n\nTime really together\n\nFriends, If you read Zack’s prayer letter last week, you’ll know that our community is in a season of change and growth as we adjust to new coworkers arriving and old coworkers getting ready to leave. It’s an exciting and hectic period, sometimes challenging, sometimes a little chaotic, and an important time for us to grow… Read more »\n\nA new kind of life\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. This was another week of introduction for our community. We welcomed Mark and Aishah and their two beautiful daughters Abigail and Hannah to our community this week; it has been a long and tumultuous road for them coming from Holland, with many unexpected setbacks,… Read more »\n\nWhat you do to my child\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. This was a busy week, with many early-morning departures. We weren’t able to have a single morning meeting with all our community members present; we sometimes have to send one or two out to pick up children or sit with family during surgeries, but… Read more »\n\nStand against the flood\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. It’s funny how much power our expectations have over our experiences. We started this week expecting it would be an easy and quiet time; each day had almost nothing in the schedule, and each night looking ahead I would say: Should be an easy day… Read more »\n\nNeither slumbers nor sleeps\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. We had a quieter time this week; there were a couple tight days, but generally we had welcome breathing room. We began by saying farewell to Omed and Ahmed, who were here with us for three and four months respectively. They have both safely… Read more »\n\nBravery of our mothers\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, I started this letter at 2 AM from the Assuta Hospital ER lobby, here in Ashdod. Our coworker Joanne was inside the ER with the mother of Revand; we rushed her there with terrifyingly high blood pressure, a condition she suffers from periodically. We stayed at the hospital for several hours,… Read more »\n\nAsk with boldness\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those of us in Ashdod. It’s been a busy few days. I wrote last week about all the Kurdish children who were finally in the hospital, and now almost all of them are back in the house with us, most of them just one successful echo examination away from… Read more »\n\nGathered together in unity\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from our communities in Ashdod and Jerusalem. It has been a week of transit and beginning of transformation, primarily signified by my many trips to Ben Gurion Airport at various and sundry hours of the day and night. Four young new volunteers joined us this week; Bjorn from the Netherlands,… Read more »\n\nFor the first time pink lips\n\nFriends, While writing this prayer letter, I’m sitting with Rizhna’s Kurdish mother in the waiting room in Sheba hospital. Rizhna went into surgery at 8 am for valve repair, widening of the pulmonary arteries and closing a hole between the heart chambers. It’s a complicated surgery and it might take a long time. The mother was softly… Read more »\n\nWhen the trumpet sounds\n\nFriends, Sunday afternoon, the doctors at Sheba took baby Yousif from Gaza into the operating room for an attempt to take him off ECMO heart-lung support. It’s a slow and painstaking process, and during the procedure, Yousif had complications and was not able to come off the machine. “He’s in extremely critical condition,” a doctor told us… Read more »\n\nIt is well with my soul\n\nFriends, A total of ten Kurdish children filled our houses in Ashdod and Jerusalem this week. In Jerusalem, we have sweet baby Mam, who is flying home today. Mam underwent a successful heart surgery. His recovery wasn’t easy, and he needed another emergency surgery to remove part of his colon. But now he is fully… Read more »\n\nIn the thicket of the Jordan\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from Ashdod. Last week I wrote about the death of Ahmed. Yesterday another baby boy from Gaza named Eslam, who has been with us for just shy of four months, also passed away at the Sheba Medical Center: This is a heavy blow for our community. We had all grown to love Eslam… Read more »\n\nSo we fight for them\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from those who remain in Ashdod. It’s been a tight couple of weeks. We’ve had a high flow of children coming in and out of our communities, with only a few people to look after them; and we volunteers have also been hit by sicknesses, meaning here in Ashdod we’ve… Read more »\n\nNo matter what we will trust you\n\nFriends, In the middle of an incredibly eventful week here at Shevet, we read the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in Daniel 3. These three young men, thought to be as young as their late teens, watch their homeland fall to an invader and are themselves carried off to captivity in Babylon. Yet their… Read more »\n\nYou all are my sisters\n\nFriends, This week marked the end of a long and beautiful period of time in our Shevet community. For the last ten months, our community has been stronger and richer for the presence of our beloved German coworkers, Doro, Luisa, Lena, and Elise. We’ve celebrated moments of immense joy and walked through valleys of deep… Read more »\n\nSomething beautiful\n\nFriends, At the beginning of the week we heard that Somaia was back in the ICU in Gaza and not doing well. And while Jonathan and Bria were working together with the doctors in Gaza and Israel to get her transferred to the Sheba Medical Center, we received on Monday afternoon the message from her… Read more »\n\nHe wasn’t alone\n\nFriends, Like most weeks at Shevet, we’ve had an eventful week. A week full of children coming and going in and out of Gaza, Kurdistan and the West Bank. The week started with a fun trip for my coworker Lena. The Sheba Medical Center ICU suggested we take Niyan from Kurdistan and Ahmed from Gaza… Read more »\n\nFrom where does my help come?\n\nFriends, Our coworker Willem is now flying back to his family in the Netherlands, after making a big impact on our community in the last two months. It is a great example for all of us to hear the way Messiah was able to turn Willem into a humble and hardworking man who only wants… Read more »\n\nFace shining like the sun\n\nFriends, Yesterday was finally the day for our beautiful Liya to go back to Gaza. Early in the morning, before even entering the ICU, I already saw all her mother’s bags piled up next to the elevator. She was all excited and ready to go, and told me she was up at six in the… Read more »\n\nDangerous for me here\n\nFriends, At noon yesterday we all gathered for a delicious Kurdish lunch in our family house here in Ashdod. For the first time in quite a while our big dining room was filled with laughter, chaos, joy and families from Gaza and Kurdistan. But just as we were finishing lunch we heard that rockets were… Read more »\n\nConsecrated chicken soup\n\nAnd Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “This day is holy to the Lord your God; do not mourn or weep.” For all the people wept as they heard the words of the Law. Then he said to… Read more »\n\nHow exactly did I end up here?\n\nHelp me to love with open arms, like You do A love that erases all the lies and sees the truth So that when they look in my eyes, they would see You Even in just a smile they would feel the Father’s love. Friends, We often find ourselves in situations here that leave us… Read more »\n\nWhat are we worrying about?\n\nBrothers and sisters, We have spoken a lot this week in our community about love. This morning we read Paul’s guidelines in Romans 14 for how to live together with others. The key verse: So then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding. In Shevet Achim we have been struggling for a… Read more »\n\nBread of sincerity and truth\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from Jerusalem. We spent this week, like our Jewish neighbors, celebrating Passover. The week was inaugurated by the clearing out of leaven from the house—all bread or rising products that we hadn’t already eaten were thrown away. Our carb consumption plummeted. Holidays and deprivation do not easily mesh in my… Read more »\n\nLove them anyway\n\nFriends, As the sun set Wednesday evening, households all over Israel lit their candles and began the Seder meal, an ancient tradition in memory and celebration of God’s deliverance of his people from slavery in Egypt. At our home in Ashdod, we all crowded around two tables set end-to-end, so full we could barely fit… Read more »\n\nOne day at a time\n\nFriends, When we looked at the calendar at the beginning of this week we were a little shocked – 30 appointments for Gaza kids in only one week. This is more children in a week than we ever had in my entire time here – possibly the most Gaza kids in a week in Shevet… Read more »\n\nTongues of fire\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, We at Shevet live in a believing community—that is to say, we try and make a space around us where God is worshiped, the Messiah is followed, and our neighbors are loved. I say “try” for two reasons: first, because we do these things intentionally and with effort to grow, and… Read more »\n\nA promise of reunion\n\nFriends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from the community in Ashdod. Over the last weeks, our community has been reading through the Acts of the Apostles. The book has served as both instruction and preparation for a long-planned study of the letter to the Romans, which we just began yesterday. Acts is a wonderful resource for… Read more »\n\nWhere he is there is hope\n\nFriends, This morning I received a discouraged text from seven-week-old Jud’s mother: Look at my daughter. Is there any solution for her? Tell me if there is a chance. It’s true that over the last few weeks we haven’t seen the improvement we hoped for in Jud’s condition. It’s been a month since the surgery to… Read more »\n\nOutdo one another in showing honor\n\nTo our friends, brothers, and sisters, Greetings from Ashdod. It has been a long, though not particularly difficult, week here at Shevet Achim. Our numbers dwindled somewhat due to sickness or vacation, but our community here was strong, and we gathered in mutual support and encouragement. There is a passage of scripture I think about… Read more »\n\nRejoice in the darkness\n\nFriends, This week we had an American woman named Carly, who works in Iraq, visiting our community. She escorted a new child coming for heart surgery, and flew back with two of our families to Kurdistan. While with our communities in Jerusalem and Ashdod she shared her testimony. She suffered almost her whole life from… Read more »\n\nKeep their doors open\n\nFriends, This week in Ashdod has been marked by joy and laughter—a surprising thing when you consider that our house is full of families who have been here for quite some time and are eager to return home to Kurdistan. All five of our Kurdish children have faced some unexpected delay or another, yet somehow… Read more »\n\nThey are not forgotten\n\nFriends, During what’s been a relatively quiet week here at Shevet, I spent quite a bit of time sorting through records of children from Gaza and the West Bank—countless medical records, surgical reports, and blog posts, each telling the story of a precious child who has passed through our doors over the years. As I… Read more »\n\nAir bubbles to the brain\n\nFriends, The second heart surgery of our beloved Liya from Gaza was abruptly abandoned at the Sheba Medical Center today, when doctors discovered that a hole in one of her arteries had allowed air bubbles to enter her circulatory system and travel to her brain. To prevent brain damage or death she was rushed to another hospital… Read more »\n\nAll I have is a hallelujah\n\nFriends, Tuesday evening my German coworkers and I came back from a short seminar, and the first thing we did was walk into our family house to say hello to our kids and moms. Not many were in the house when we left on Friday, but now we were greeted by a lot of noise… Read more »\n\nA long-awaited day\n\nFriends, Sunday was a long-awaited day for little Arya from Kurdistan and his mother. After over a month of nothing but waiting, it was finally time for his brain and spinal MRI, the last of a series of tests needed before his big surgery. First thing Sunday morning, we got an exciting message from the hospital—Bring Arya… Read more »\n\nLoved by so many\n\nFriends, If you’ve followed the stories of the children here for even a few months, you probably know Fayez, a two-year-old from the Gaza Strip with chubby cheeks and a big grin. Perhaps you’ve followed his story as his little heart began to fail in the past several months, and his doctors here and in Gaza… Read more »\n\nJust run to him\n\nFriends, I was in the train back home from my day off when I got a call from Daveen’s mother: Daveen is coughing a lot and has trouble breathing. She already had a little cough the days before, so I first thought it’s probably no big thing, but I called Joanne to go check on her. And… Read more »\n\nBorn to die\n\nFriends, After last week’s prayer update we got a call from the mother of newborn Mohammed from Gaza. Some 30 hours after his arrival in Israel, Mohammed died Friday morning despite all the best efforts of his doctors.
