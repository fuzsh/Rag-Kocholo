        "text": "Genesis 15:5\n\nHe took him outside and said, “Look up at the heavens and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”\n\nWant to hear something awesome?\n\nno. 1 it refers to “offspring” not many offsprings.\n\nThe traditional teaching is that Abraham will have many children like the stars or as many of the stars…\n\nit does not … it means “seed” one “seed”….\n\nGalatians 3:16 “The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,”[i] meaning one person, who is Christ.”\n\nNo. 2 in the Hebrew it does not say count the stars. It means “demand an accounting of the stars”. this means “ask the stars to tell you a story”.\n\nThe gospel is actually in the stars. They speak of a woman who will give birth to a man with 2 natures who will be a great warrior that would kill the snake (or a scorpion) who will die as a lamb. He will be a servant ox to many and will reign as the Lion of Judah. Satan took what was written in the stars and made it into horoscopes…\n\nWhy wouldn’t God write the story of redemption in a place the whole world could see? Wouldn’t He put that story everywhere in our lives, the way He put it into the everyday lives of the Israelites in the times of the nation? The Ark is a type of Christ, the sacrifice, the marriage rituals, the temple, even the names of the first ten patriarchs tell the story. And that’s a fascinating little study.\n\nDidn’t God have Paul tells us to look at the stars to see how the “wrath of God” is revealed in the heavens? Romans 1:18 Do you have another explanation that fits verse 23? What else can there be in the heavens that man could change from “the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things?” There isn’t anything up there to change but the pictures of the constellations. The Greeks changed the constellation of Coma from a seated woman with a child on her lap, to a swatch of hair, and called it Berinice. They obscured the picture that enhanced the main sign of Virgo. The woman holding the child fills out the “seed” concept offered by Virgo, with her stalk of wheat in one hand.\n\nAstrology is Satan’s counterfeit for “life guidance”. Satan’s counterfeits are always self-oriented. His message through astrology is that your internal “clock,” which began with the star alignment at your birth, governs your life. If you apply this information properly, “You can “do” life on your own, you don’t need God.” Not needing God to have all His Knowledge and Power has been Satan’s tactic since Eden. Satan is VERY accomplished at covering God’s tracks.\n\nThe following tables harmonize the names of the forty-eight constellations of the twelve Signs with their meanings in various languages and selected scriptures. Following each table I have included a summary of the complete Sign which can be found in E.W. Bullinger’s 1893 book, “The Witness of the Stars, from Kregel Publications.

However, as we shall see, they undoubtedly have a common source. The Lunar Zodiac can be found in India, Arabia and China. Unlike China and Arabia, the Indian astronomy assigned figures to each of the Mansions of the Moon. The Lunar Zodiac travels around the same ecliptic as the Solar, but is divided into twenty-eight parts. Each of these Mansions has it’s own particular name.\n\nJoseph A. Seiss has written a very complete account of the Zodiacs, including related subjects, like primeval man. I urge you to get this book called, “The Gospel in the Stars.” About the history of the Lunar Zodiac Seiss says, “Astronomers agree in regarding this LunarZodiac as containing the most ancient remains of the science of the stars. The Romans, Greeks, and Egyptians knew little or nothing about it, but it is a matter of record in China that it was known and understood in that country as early as the reign of Yao, about twenty-three hundred years before the Christian era, which was before the time of Abraham. In the Chinese astronomy it begins with Virgo, which would seem to indicate that the Chinese table came from the antediluvian times.”\n\nIf it was meant that the stars should carry a prophetic record of the Gospel, then we would find it also in the arrangement and naming of the Lunar Mansions. And, of course, it is.\n\nFor ease of comparison, I’ll table the Lunar Mansions as they occur in relation to the Solar Zodiac. And from E. Raymond Capt’s excellent introductory study of this subject, I’ll quote the summary for each of the four constellations that make up the twelve signs.\n\nVIRGO:\n\nSeed of the Woman, the Desire of nations, Man of double nature in humiliation, exalted Shepherd and Harvester.\n\nLIBRA:\n\nThe Price to be paid, the Cross to be endured, the Victim slain, the Crown purchased.\n\nSCORPIO:\n\nThe Conflict, the Serpent’s coils, the struggle with the Enemy, the toiling Vanquisher of evil.\n\nSAGITTARIUS:\n\nThe double-natured One triumphing as a Warrior, he gladdens the Heavens, he builds the fires of punishment, he casts down the Dragon.\n\nCAPRICORNUS:\n\nLife out of Death, the Arrow of God, Pierced and falling, Springing up again in abundant life.\n\nAQUARIUS:\n\nLife-waters from on high, Drinking the heavenly flood, Carrying and speeding the Good News, bearing aloft the Cross over all the earth.\n\nPISCES:\n\nMultiplication of the Redeemer’s People, upheld and governed by the Lamb, the intended Bride bound and exposed on earth, the Bridegroom exalted.\n\nARIES:\n\nThe Lamb found worthy, the Bride released and making ready, Satan bound, the Breaker triumphing.\n\nTAURUS:\n\nThe invincible Ruler come, the sublime Vanquisher, the River of Judgement, the all-ruling Shepherd.\n\nGEMINI:\n\nThe Marriage of the Lamb, the Enemy trodden down, the Prince coming in Glory, his princely following.\n\nCANCER:\n\nThe Possession secured, Lesser fold – the Church of the first born, Greater fold – Israel, the Bride, safe folding into the kingdom.\n\nLEO:\n\nThe King aroused for the rending, the Serpent fleeing, the Bowl of Wrath upon him, his Carcass devoured.\n\nSeiss finishes by saying, “The whole series of these names thus runs parallel with the signs of the Solar Zodiac, and ends up precisely in the same way, proving that they are of a piece with it.”\n\nA last reminder for those who may have lost track. The Chinese had these Mansions, with their names long before the other cultures of history. This Lunar Zodiac wasn’t the product of some group of star gazers corrupting an existing Solar Zodiac.\n\nAmazing, huh? But that’s God.\n\nInside this seed will be many many children. These children refers to us. See Galatians 3: 21 Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law. 22 But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.\n\n23 Before the coming of this faith,[j] we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed. 24 So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. 25 Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.\n\n26 So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, 27 for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\n\nThe promises in Genesis 15 does not refer to the Israelites but to believers under grace. We are also told that we are under the seed of Sarah. Believers who do not revert back to the law.\n\nGalatians 4\n\n21 Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says? 22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. 23 His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise.\n\n24 These things are being taken figuratively: The women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. 25 Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. 26 But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother. 27 For it is written:\n\n“Be glad, barren woman,\n\nyou who never bore a child;\n\nshout for joy and cry aloud,\n\nyou who were never in labor;\n\nbecause more are the children of the desolate woman\n\nthan of her who has a husband.”[e]\n\n28 Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise. 29 At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now. 30 But what does Scripture say? “Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s son.”[f] 31 Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.\n\nAs such the stars in the seed mentioned in Genesis 15:5 refers to you.\n\nBe blessed."
