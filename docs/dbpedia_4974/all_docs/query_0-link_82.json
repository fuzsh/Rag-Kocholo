This abandonment of Europe was a new phenomenon. Dutch and other European Jews had for 150 years migrated between the large Ashkenazic centers or within the Sephardic Diaspora in northwestern Europe, moving generally to England by way of Holland. Dan Michman, “Migration Versus ‘Species Hollandia Judaica’: The Role of Migration in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries in Preserving Ties Between Dutch and World Jewry,” Studia Rosenthaliana 23 (Fall 1989): 57–58. Because the first official census of the Netherlands was in 1830, there are no specific figures on the Jewish population or the extent of early overseas emigration. In any case, the outflow was not sufficient to reverse the gradual Jewish population growth. Amsterdam Jewry increased from an estimated 23,000 in 1795 to 30,000 in 1809, during which time the overall city population decreased from an estimated 210,000 to 180,000. The amount of internal migration of Jews to Amsterdam is unknown however, but this may explain the Jewish increase. See Bloemgarten, “Amsterdamse Joden,” 50.\n\n23.

In 1817, 21.9 percent of all Noord Holland inhabitants were on the dole, which was twice the rate in Zuid Holland. See H. J. Prakke, Drenthe in Michigan (Grand Rapids, 1983), 30–31. A socioeconomic analysis of the Amsterdam elite in 1813 finds the Jewish element almost entirely absent. Of the 245 highest taxed persons in 1813 in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague, only four Jews are listed, all in The Hague.

Although the “first” Jew anywhere is seldom the first, an anonymous clipping in the Boston Jewish Advocate, Tercentenary issue (Jan. 27, 1955), p. 7, states that a Moses Simonson “from the Jewish settlement of Amsterdam” arrived in Plymouth Colony in 1621 on the ship Fortune (cited in Morris A. Gutstein, To Bigotry No Sanction: A Jewish Shrine in America 1658–1958 [New York, 1958], 20, 161). Simonson’s daughter Rebecca married John Soule, whose father George sailed on the Mayflower. Rebecca’s son married Sarah Standish, daughter of Miles Standish and also of John Alden. Since Puritans were not known for their religious tolerance, this account of acceptance and even intermarriage is suspect. Either Moses Simonson was a Christian convert or he was not a Jew. The latter is the adamant contention of Jacob R. Marcus in The Colonial American Jew, 1492–1776, 3 vols. (Detroit, 1970), 3:1193, 1428. The first known Jew in the Bay Colony, according to Marcus, was Solomon Franco, a ship’s supercargo from Holland who arrived in Boston in the late 1840s and was left behind when the ship departed. The authorities sent him packing on the next vessel to Holland ten weeks later. Franco lived most of his life in London, first as a “rabbi” and after his conversion to Christianity in 1668 as a theological writer (ibid., 300–1).\n\n2. Isaac S. Emmanuel and Suzanne A.

Sussman, “Isaac Leeser and the Protestantization of American Judaism,” American Jewish Archives 38 (Apr. 1986): 8–10; “Preaching,” Encyclopaedia Judaica 13:1002–7. This extensive article does not mention Samuel Isaacs or Isaac Leeser. Only an occasional prayer had been recited in English before Isaacs’ sermon. On the fiftieth anniversary of the event in 1889, Rabbi De Sola Mendes of Shaaray Tefila recalled the fact in his sermon (the Jewish Messenger, Oct. 4, 1889).\n\n17. This sorry affair is fully documented in the Occident and American Jewish Advocate, including an exchange of letters containing charges and countercharges, Rabbi Isaacs’s statement, and the full text of the New York court’s decision. Despite the documentation of the power struggle for control of the congregation, there is no mention of underlying causes, which may have been a case of oldtimers against newcomers, natives versus immigrants, or even nationalistic rivalries (see the Occident, 3 (1845): 255–60, 300–5, 357, 408–15, 478–80). Sharfman describes the schism as an English versus German conflict (First Rabbi, 169–70). Goldstein (A Century of Judaism, 92–94) refers to “two opposing parties in the Congregation” before 1844, but does not explain the reason for the decision. On this point see Jonathan Sarna, “The Debate over Mixed Seating in the American Synagogue,” in Jack Wertheimer, ed., The American Synagogue: A Sanctuary Transformed (New York, 1987), 376.\n\n18. The Baltimore Congregation called Rabbi Isaacs within days of his stirring address in English at the consecration of their new Lloyd Street synagogue. Isaacs declined, said Isaac Leeser, who was also a participant in the dedication, because of “his attachment for his present flock.” See Leeser’s report in the Occident 3 (1845): 361–67, quote on 367; Sharfman, First Rabbi, 176.\n\n19.

The Jewish Messenger, Nov. 7, 1862; Sept. 18, 1863. The spirit of rivalry between the Greene Street and Wooster Street congregations is clearly evident in the very frank personal diary entries of 1863 by the young Myer S. Isaacs, eldest son of Rabbi Isaacs, who accuses the “Greene Street people” of “mischief,” “contemptible conduct,” and playing a “trick” in their plans to relocate to the same vicinity on Thirty-fourth Street where Shaaray Tefila planned to move, and for supposedly blocking attempts by Shaaray Tefila to purchase lots on that street. See “Myer S. Isaacs Diary, 1863 and 1868, New York, N.Y.,” 2 vols., typescript, AJA, Cincinnati, 1:59–61, 66, 68, 76. Nevertheless, the Dutch shared in Bnai Jeshurun’s Cypress Hills Cemetery on Long Island.\n\n27. The Forty-fourth Street synagogue occupied four building lots covering over 10,000 square feet, with an alley on each side. The architectural style was Byzantine, and the building had seating for 400 on the main floor and 320 in the galleries (the Occident 26 [1868]: 93).\n\n28. S. Cohen, Shaaray Tefila, 18–26. Rowland Davies was a trustee in 1861–1863 (the Jewish Messenger, Nov. 15, 1861). Isaac Bildersee’s obituary is in ibid., Feb. 2, 1872. In 1850 Samuel Myer Isaacs and his wife Jane lived with their four children at 669 Houston Street between De Paw Place (Thompson Street) and Laurens Street in Ward 15. By 1857 the family, then with five children, had moved their eight children into a bigger house at 649 Houston, and in 1865 they moved their eight children to the fashionable Uptown district, living at 145 West Forty-sixth Street near Broadway. In 1869 the Shaaray Tefila Congregation had moved Uptown also to their Forty-fourth Street synagogue at Sixth Avenue (Ward 22). In the 1870 census, Samuel reported the value of his home at $30,000.

For evidence that Rabbi Isaacs’s eldest son, Myer, shared his father’s fervent concern for Orthodoxy, see “Myer S. Isaacs Diary, 1863 and 1868,” esp. the 1868 volume.\n\n29. The Jewish Messenger began publication on Jan. 2, 1857, as a vehicle for young writers, but Rev. Isaacs always wrote the editorials from the journal’s office in his home. His son Abram S. joined the editorial team in July, 1857. Titles of editorials readily convey the tenor of the sheet: “Orthodoxy,” “The Synagogue,” “Religious Education,” “What is to be Done for our Poor?” “Judaism,” “The Sabbath,” “A Hebrew College,” “A Jewish Foster Home.” See also Grinstein, Jewish Community, 216–17, 366–67.\n\n30.

The minutes of Bnai Jeshurun refer to a “Rabbi Aaron” in Amsterdam who purchased scrolls and prayer books for the congregation. This was likely Aaron Mendes Chumaceiro, a member after 1838 of the rabbinic court of the Portuguese synagogue (Grinstein, Jewish Community, 414, 417, 270–71). Rabbi Aaron Chumaceiro became chief rabbi in Curaçao in 1860 (“Amsterdam,” Jewish Encyclopedia, 1:542). Isaacs was “intimately acquainted” with Dr. Nathan Adler, the chief rabbi of London (1845–1890); Adler pushed Jewish education, founded the Jews’ College in London, and defended “unflinching orthodoxy.” See Grinstein, Jewish Community, 498, 446; “Nathan Marcus Adler,” Jewish Encyclopedia 1:198–99; Goldstein, A Century of Judaism, 75.\n\n36.

Isaac Noot, congregational resolutions of sympathy, and an account of the funeral and address by Rev. S. Morais, see the Jewish Messenger, May 24, 31, June 6, 21, 1878. The key to Isaacs’s claim is the word Ashkenazic. Prior to Isaacs, Sephardic clerics in America preached in English: Gershom Mendes Seixas of Shearith Israel beginning in 1768, Jacob de la Motta in Charleston and Savannah from 1785, and Isaac Leeser of Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia beginning in 1830. Leeser was actually the first Jewish minister to preach regular Sabbath sermons in English. See Leon A. Jick, The Americanization of the Synagogue, 1820–1870 (Hanover, NH, 1976), 10–11, 60–61; Sharfman, First Rabbi, 169, 175–76; Sussman, “Isaac Leeser,” 8–10. Sharfman erroneously described Isaacs as “the Englishman” (169) and a “native of England” (170; cf. 622, 624, 654). He likely followed M. Davis, Emergence, who made the same error (78, 82, 101).\n\n49. Simon, “Samuel Myer Isaacs,” 1; M. Davis, Emergence, 2.

I am determined to enlarge my business, which might lead to a more better sale of your books.” This and several other Noot letters were disposed of by Dropsie College more than thirty years ago.

The account of the relocation and dedication service is in the Jewish Messenger, Aug. 3, 10, 1860; the Occident 18 (1860): 124. Officers of the congregation at the time were: Victor Freibourg (1793–1884), president; Johannes Lansburg, vice president and treasurer; S. de Jonge, secretary; and trustee Dr. Lyon Berhard, Myer S. Cohen, and H. Lazar. Isaac Goldsmith chaired the Dedication Committee. Besides the Germans Freibourg and Berhard, M. I. Friedlander served in 1861 as secretary and Isaac Wertheimer was active on the Sunday School committee (the Jewish Messenger, June 24, Oct. 28, Dec. 2, 1859; Nov. 30, 1860; Apr. 12, 1861; May 16, 1884).\n\n72.

[who] took a prominent part in benevolent and synagogue work when the workers were but few.”\n\n78. Noot advertised the auction in the New Orleans Morning Sun, June 14, 1848, as cited in Sharfman, First Rabbi, 498. Bnai Israel also appointed a committee to raise additional monies, composed of M. S. Cohen, M. R. de Leeuw, Isaac de Brave, Emanuel de Young, and Philip Levy (Grinstein, Jewish Community, 588–89 n. 31; the Occident 11 [1853]: 369).\n\n79.

Goedhart (Good-hart), Mark Isaacs, Solomon Rose, and Emanuel de Young.\n\n81. The Jewish Messenger, June 21, 1878, states that the Society was formed “thirty years ago.” Thus, it may have been the successor of congregation Bnai Israel’s burial and mutual aid society of 1848. In 1885 the Tree of Life Society had ninety members and capital of $3,000 (ibid., Jan. 30, 1885; Oct. 30, 1891; Sept. 1, 1895). The Netherland Israelitisch Sick Fund, a significant organization, was rediscovered only recently by Joël Cahen, “Een eigen ziekenfonds voor joden in New York,” Nieuw Israëlitisch Weekblad, Nov. 15, 1985, pp. 145–46 (Jubilee number). The issue includes a 1985 interview with Nathan Fish, secretary of the NISF, whose archives are located at the funeral enterprise of the NISF, Hirsch & Sons, 1225 Jerome Avenue, The Bronx, New York. A notarized “Certificate of Incorporation” of NISF, dated February 17, 1866, was filed with the city and county of New York on February 26, 1866. The brief document, containing original signatures of the seven trustees, is in the incorporation records of the New York County Division of Records, and is also available in photocopy form at American Jewish Historical Society, Waltham, MA.\n\n82. Simon Winkel (1826–1917) was one of the first three directors of the fund and for many years was secretary. A Son of David Winkel, a merchant in The Hague and’s Hertogenbosch, Simon emigrated to London in 1854 with his older brother, married there and then after the birth of his second child in 1857 emigrated to New York. He worked as a cigarmaker in Manhattan and later opened a cigar store in The Bronx. The family lived at 738 Kelly Street. Simon died in New York City in 1917 after a long career of service to the Dutch Jewish community.

The Jewish Messenger of Sept. 2, 1887, states: “the Rev. I. C. Noot will continue to give conscientious care to the old-time Dutch congregation, Bnai Israel.” In 1891 or 1892 Noot left Bnai Israel to become principal of the Sunday school at the uptown Temple Rodeph Shalom (the Jewish Messenger, Sept. 19, 1890; Sept. 9, Dec. 9, 1892). Bnai Israel moved to 229 East Seventy-ninth Street (ibid., Oct. 15, 1897).\n\n89. The American Hebrew 60 (Dec. 31, 1896): 258; the Jewish Messenger, Mar. 30, 1866; Jan. 13, 1880; Oct. 5, 1894. Van Praag (1806–1880) of Leiden emigrated in 1826 to New York City after completing his training in dentistry at the University. He practiced until retiring in 1873. He was a founder of Congregation Bnai Jeshurun and vice president of its Green Street School, and an officer in the Adelphi Lodge. He led the protest movement against the Mortara kidnapping. As the perennial president of the Gemileth Chesed Society, in 1866 he received a medal at a testimonial dinner in his honor after twenty-five years of leadership. His funeral at the Thirty-fourth Street Synagogue was a large affair.\n\n90. See Isaac Leeser’s comments in the Occident 3 (1845): 462; cf. Bernard H.

Peixotto’s oldest daughter Judith S., wife of David Hays, was the first Jewish public school principal in New York (Ward School for Girls No. 10 on James Street), as reported in the New York Sun, April 18, 1851. One of her great-grandsons, Arthur Hays Sulzberger (1891–1968), became publisher (1935–1961) of the New York Times. Peixotto’s son Moses L. M.

The Jewish Messenger, Aug. 31, 1860, is the only source that identifies Goldsmith as “rabbi” of the Bnai Israel Congregation. Goldsmith emigrated to New York around 1842, having followed his children who preceeded him (see his obituary in ibid., Nov. 22, 1872).\n\nThe original of Goldsmith’s letter is in the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam. Cahen published the letter in Dutch, “Een eigen ziekenfonds,” in the Nieuw Israëlitisch Weekblad, November, 15, 1985. Dr. Adriaan de Wit (Professor of Romance Languages, Kent State University) translated the letter, and two authorities on Judaism, Dr. Herbert Hochhauser (Professor of Germanic Languages, Kent State University) and Rabbi Abraham Liebtag of Akron’s Temple Israel, explained the meaning of the numerous religious phrases.\n\n102.Dutch Households, 2:484–85; the Jewish Messenger, May 2, 1862. In 1866 Emanuel Goldsmith and his wife sponsored a lavish celebration to mark the silver wedding anniversary of Moses Cohen and his daughter Betje. Y. P. de Young made a presentation of a silver pitcher and goblet on behalf of Congregation Bnai Israel and the Reverend S. M. Isaacs again spoke, as did the Reverend M. R. de Leeuw (the Jewish Messenger, May 11, 1862).\n\n103.Jewish Community, 41. Emanuel Goldsmith’s membership in Bnai Jeshurun is inferred from his letter, which states: “There are 11 synagogues here: large as no other is the English synagogue to which we belong. Then follows the Portuguese synagogue [Shearith Israel]. The remainder are German and Polish ones and two temples.” Bnai Jeshurun was the largest synagogue in terms of membership, reaching nearly 150 in 1850.

Since Judaism lacked rabbinical authority in the early years, synagogues facing difficult questions had to appeal to higher authorities in Europe, usually in London or Amsterdam. When Mikveh Israel needed a legal interpretation (Din Torah) concerning a member who had blatantly disregarded the judgment of the synagogue, they sent a question (she’ elah) for an interpretation to Rabbi Saul (Löwenstamm) of the Ashkenazic community of Amsterdam. It is noteworthy that Mikveh Israel was Sephardic and yet appealed to an Ashkenazic rabbi because of his Orthodoxy and rabbinical knowledge. Similarly, in 1823 the German congregation of Philadelphia requested the advice of Ashkenazic rabbis in London and Amsterdam regarding a religious problem.\n\n7.

The family was living in the Jodenkerkstraat (Nieuwe Kerkstraat) on May 20, 1812, when Eliazer assumed the family name Noot, according to the Amsterdam Name-Taking Register (vol. E, p. 43). Siblings were Philip, born in 1811, and Katje, born in 1808. Noot married on November 14, 1832, at Amsterdam to Susanna Snoek of Amsterdam, the twenty-three-year old daughter of Marcus Abraham Snoek, a tailor, and Judie Isaac de Leeuw (Amsterdam Civil Marriage Registers 1832, vol. 4, p. 81). I am indebted for this information to Odette Vlessing, archivist, Gemeentearchief Amsterdam.\n\n43. The Occident 1 (1843): 60, 357; 2 (1844): 107; 12 (1854): 469; 14 (1856): 309, 453.\n\n44.

The officers of Bnai Israel in 1856–1857 were Abraham Solomons, president; Henry de Boer, treasurer; and trustees Solomon Blitz, Isaac Goldsmit, Isaac Cohen, L. A. de Haan, and B. Munchweiler. The building committee was composed of Cohen, De Boer, Munchweiler, and Matthew Kaas; the fund-raising committee was made up of Cohen, De Boer, Goldsmit, and Kaas plus Simon Alexander, Moses Simons, and Isaac van Gelder. All were Dutch but Munchweiler. Some of these persons are identified in the federal censuses. Solomon Blitz was a clothier, De Boer a dealer in old clothes, De Haan and Simons dealers, Alexander and Van Gelder clothes dealers, and Kaas a pawnbroker. The most property that any of these persons owned was $1,000. Alexander, Van Gelder, and Kaas were younger than thirty years of age in 1857. Solomon Blitz emigrated at age twenty-two from his birthplace of Amsterdam in 1857; he was the middle son of Solomon Blitz, a clothes buyer, according to the Amsterdam Population Registers (Bevolkingsregisters).\n\n46. The Occident 18 (1861): 280; 20 (1862): 328–29, 381–82; the Jewish Messenger, May 30, Sept. 19, 1862.\n\n47. Ibid., 19 (1861): 140–42. The 1860 federal census lists the Noot family as living in Ward 4, the Western Division, and it included Simon age fifty-one, listed incorrectly as a “Methodist minister” with personal property valued at $500, wife Suzanna (earlier records give his wife’s name as Jane) age fifty-two, daughter Elizabeth twenty-eight, and six sons: Lewis twenty-one, no occupation; Isaac twenty, teacher; Philip eighteen, cigarmaker; Abraham fourteen, no occupation; Myer thirteen and Joseph eleven attending school. Abraham, Myer, and Joseph were born in New York and all the others were born in Holland. Swierenga, Dutch Households, 2:733. Isaac Noot became a noted New York City rabbi and in 1887 was a delegate and read the Scripture at the regular spring meeting of the Jewish Ministers’ Association of America, meeting in Philadelphia. Jewish Exponent, Apr. 29, 1887.\n\n48. The Occident 18 (1861): 280; 25 (1867): 523. G. M. Goldsmit was appointed the new sexton. He was likely a son of Levi M. Goldsmit, who operated a fancy goods store in the 1820s.\n\n49. Auditors of the treasurer’s books were Joseph Davis, a son of John; Simon Alexander; Moses Symons (Simons), and Jacob Segar (Segaar), both dealers; and Simon Alexander, who later became treasurer (the Occident 18 [1861]: 280; 20 [1862]: 382). Abraham Solomons, who may be a son of Dutch pioneer Benedict Solomons, was a trustee in 1860. The non-Dutch trustees appear to be German or Polish. Eleazer Gerrit Boutelje was born in Amsterdam in 1834, son of Gerrit Eleazer Boutelje, a venter or peddler, and immigrated on July 25, 1852, at eighteen years of age, then a cigarmaker. Eleazer’s father and mother emigrated a year later (July 20, 1853), and his younger brother followed the next year (October 3, 1854). It was a typical chain migration that brought the entire family to America (see Amsterdam Population Registers).\n\n50. The Occident 15 (1857): 240.\n\n51. Ibid., 18 (1861): 293–294; 23 (1865): 40–43. Bnai Israel in 1865 contributed $25, compared to $100 for Rodeph Shalom and Beth Israel and $200 for Mikveh Israel.\n\n52. In the ceremony of Halizah, a widow whose husband died and left her childless, took off the shoe of her brother-in-law and thereby released him from the Levitical obligation to marry her and give her a child (see Jewish Encyclopedia, 6:170–74).\n\n53.

Officers of the choir, elected for one year, were Myer de Bear [De Boer], president; I. Hays, vice president; W. Wolters, treasurer; Abraham Pereira, a twenty-year-old cigarmaker, musical director; Simon Boutelje, a forty-year-old dealer in secondhand clothes, treasurer and director Augustus Levy, a forty-six-year-old ivory turner; J. Levy; E. Wolters; and Rudolph Boutelje, a thirty-year-old dealer. Ages and occupations are derived from Swierenga, Dutch Households.\n\n57. In Fellerman’s obituary in the Jewish Exponent (Apr. 22, 1887), he is described as a “well-known Jewish citizen . . . especially popular in the southern section of the city, having resided there for a lengthy period.” He died at age sixty. George Goldsmit died in 1897 at age sixty-three (ibid., Dec. 31, 1897). I. M. Goldsmit in 1887 reported glowingly in the Jewish Exponent (May 27, 1887) on the sevenieth birthday visit of King Willem III of the Netherlands to the Jewish Quarter in Amsterdam. Moses Simon(s) in 1892 resigned from the vice presidency of United Hebrew Charities because of failing health (ibid., Apr. 8, 1892).\n\n58.

Roseman, “Jewish Population of America,” table 14 “Real Estate Ownership.” Roseman only compiled data from the 1850 and 1860 censuses.\n\n77. Ibid., table 15 “Personal Estate Ownership.” In 1860, 973 Jewish households owned personalty, 27 of whom were Dutch. There were 6,579 Jewish households in the city, excluding 257 Jews in institutions.\n\n78. Morais, Jews of Philadelphia, 411. Sanson was born in Amsterdam in 1825 and emigrated to Philadelphia in 1839.\n\n79. Hano emigrated from Holland at age thirteen (c. 1836) to Baltimore where he apprenticed as a watchmaker. He then moved to Philadelphia and practiced his trade at a small store on Front Street in the 1840s and 1850s. Shortly before the Civil War he switched into the clothing business. By the 1890s he was president of a Boston book manufacturing firm, the Samuel Hano Co. Twice married, Hano at his death in 1897 left fifteen children and twenty-nine grandchildren. The family belonged to the Mikveh Israel Congregation (obituary in Jewish Exponent, Nov. 19, 1897).\n\n80. Isaacs’s parents emigrated about 1844 from Leiden to New York. He married Anna Hano (perhaps Louis Hano’s sister) and left four daughters and three sons at his death in 1889. He belonged to several Masonic lodges (Ibid. Sept. 1889).\n\n81.

Morais, Jews of Philadelphia, 255–59; “Moses Aaron Dropsie” Jewish Encyclopedia, 5:3; “Moses Aaron Dropsie,” Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, 3:602. The name Dropsie appears only once in the Amsterdam Name-Taking Registers, that is on December 9, 1811 (vol. B, p. 37) when Gimpert Mozes (probably Aaron’s brother), residing at Prinsengraght 43 opposite the workhouse, having no children or grandchildren, adopted the family name of Dropsie according to genealogist John Verdonk of Hoogland, The Netherlands, and archivist Odette Vlessing. Maxwell Whiteman of Elkins Park, PA, kindly provided the author with copies from his private collection of the military inscription document of Aron Mozes Dropsie into the Netherlands National Infantry battalion, Tenth Section, dated January 19, 1816, and also the inscription document of Gompet (Gompert) Moses Dropsie on January 30, 1825, both of Amsterdam.\n\n84. “Moses Polock,” Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, 8:584.\n\n85.
