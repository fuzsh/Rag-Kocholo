        "text": "This man was born in 1809. In 1816, at age 7, he was forced to work because his family was expelled. In 1818, at the age of 9, he lost his mother. In 1828, at the age of 19 he lost his sister. In 1831, at 22 he opened his first business and went bankrupt. In 1832, at 23 he stood in the legislative elections and lost. In 1833, at 24 he borrowed money to open another business and went bankrupt again. In 1835, at 26 he met a wonderful woman. He falls in love with her, they get engaged, and she dies. In 1836, at 27 he entered a dark period of his life: deep depression. He remains bedridden for 6 consecutive months. But he gets up. In 1836, at 27 he runs in the legislative elections and loses again. In 1840 at 31 he presented himself as an elector; he loses. In 1842, at 33 he met the woman he would fall in love, get engaged, get married and she gives him 4 children and they lose 3 of them. In 1843, at 34 he appeared at the congresses and lost. In 1845, at 36 he appeared again at the congresses and lost again. In 1850, at 41 his son died. In 1854, at 45 he ran for the Senate and lost. In 1856, at 47 he ran for Vice President, he didn't even have 100 votes. In 1858, at 49 he ran again for the Senate and lost again. And in 1860 at 51 ABRAHAM LINCOLN was elected President of the United States of America. He was elected for two terms. In 1865 at 56 he was assassinated in beginning of the second term. He was one of the most respected and impactful Presidents in the history of the United States. It's important to have context and to know and understand his story of perseverance. We can all see the hero, but few see the many afflictions he overcame. Like him we need to overcome our afflictions, no matter how difficult we can overcome them all!"
