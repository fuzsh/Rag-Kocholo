        "text": "A WORD TO TEACHERS\n\nLast saturday, I visited my dear friends Prashanth & Meera’s home. We were to go out as families to celebrate our birthdays. (Prashanth and I share birthdays on successive dates). While at his home office, watching the cricket match between India and Australia, I happened to notice a framed reprint of a letter written by Abraham Lincoln to the headmaster of his son’s school. I read it a few times. I truly treasure it. I might have reflected on it all thru that evening and the following day. I decided, I have to post the contents of that letter on my blog – lest some of my dear friends don’t get to read it OR not make its reading an accident, but rather, a necessity that will define a purpose – a rather good one!\n\n“He will have to learn, I know, that all men are not just and are not true. But teach him if you can, the wonder of books.. but also give him quiet time to ponder the eternal mystery of birds in the sky, bees in the sun and flowers on a green hillside.\n\nIn school, teach him it is far more honorable to fall than to cheat…..\n\nTeach to have faith in his own ideas, even if everyone tells him he is wrong.\n\nTeach him to be gentle with gentle people and tough with the tough.\n\nTry to give my son the strength not to follow the crowd when everyone getting on the bandwagon…\n\nTeach him to listen to all men; but teach him also to filter all he hears on a screen of truth, and take only the good that comes through.\n\nTeach him, if you can, how to laugh when he is sad… Teach him there is no shame in tears.\n\nTeach him to scoff at cynics and to be beware of too much sweetness.. Teach him to sell his brawn and brain to highest bidders, but never to put a price on his heart and soul. Teach him to close his ears to a howling mob.. and stand and fight if thinks he is right.\n\nTreat him gently, but do not cuddle him, because only the test of fire makes fine steel. Let him have the courage to be impatient.. Let him have the patience to be brave. Teach him always to have sublime faith in himself, because then he will have faith in humankind."
