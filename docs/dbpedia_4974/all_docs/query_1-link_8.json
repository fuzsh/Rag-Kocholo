        "text": "With her sweet, captivating voice, quirky yet insightful songwriting and bubbly, upbeat, free-spirited hippie persona, pop and folk singer/songwriter Melanie totally epitomized the whole \"flower power\" counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nShe was born Melanie Anne Safka on February 3, 1947, in Queens, New York, and grew up in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens. She made her first public appearance at age four, singing \"Gimme a Little Kiss\" on the radio show \"Live Like A Millionaire.\" She began singing in Greenwich Village folk clubs while attending New York's American Academy of Dramatic Arts and initially signed to Columbia Records in 1967. Her debut single, \"Beautiful People\", was a flop in America but a hit in the Netherlands. Melanie subsequently left Columbia Records and signed with Buddah Records. Her song \"Bobo's Party\" was a #1 hit in France in 1969. Melanie also sang \"Birthday of the Sun\" at the Woodstock music festival in 1969.\n\nIn 1970 she had a Top 10 hit with \"Lay Down (Candles in the Rain).\" A powerful cover of The Rolling Stones' \"Ruby Tuesday\", and \"Peace Will Come (According to Plan)\" likewise did well. In 1971 she scored her greatest smash success with the cute, catchy and funny \"Brand New Key\"; the song peaked at #1 on the Billboard charts for three weeks, sold over three million copies, was featured on the soundtrack of the film Boogie Nights (1997) and has been covered by such artists as Deana Carter, Cher, Rasputina and The Dollyrots (the British comedy folk group The Wurzels had a 1976 #1 UK hit with a parody version of \"Brand New Key\" called \"Combine Harvester\".) The follow-up songs \"Ring the Living Bell\" and \"The Nickel Song\" were also successful. Melanie was awarded Billboard's #1 Top Female Vocalist in 1972. She had her last Top 40 hit with \"Bitter Bad\" in 1973. She won a Primetime Emmy Award in 1989 for writing the lyrics to the song \"The First Time I Loved Forever\" for the TV series Die Sch√∂ne und das Biest (1987). Her children Leilah, Jeordie and Beau-Jarred are all musicians. Almost all of her albums have been produced by her husband, Peter Schekeryk. She lives in Nashville, Tennessee, and continues to record the occasional album and perform live all over the world.\n\nAdrian grew up in Tampa, Florida and started acting in the 8th grade. Although Adrian started acting at age 14, he didn't take it seriously until his senior year when he landed his first full length theatrical production of the high school musical Fame. He grew up playing many sports such as baseball, football, and basketball but dancing was his life. Adrian was mostly known for his dancing ability and participated in countless hip-hop and break dancing competitions where he was extremely successful. His high school was looking for the lead dancer in the musical Fame, so Adrian auditioned and the rest is history.\n\nUltimately, dancing is what launched Adrian into acting, where he received a scholarship to the theatre program at the University of Central Florida, Orlando.

During his training at the University of Central Florida, he worked on Nickelodeon's Gamelab, Slimetime Live, the prestigious Orlando Shakespeare Festival and many main stage theatre productions at UCF.

In 1999, Adrian decided with the training, knowledge and experience he obtained through hard work, it was time to move to Hollywood and live out his dream in television and film.\n\nAfter arriving in Hollywood, Adrian struggled but found himself determined to propel forward... and that he did by landing a co-starring role on the TV show Profiler. From here, Adrian met casting director Anthony Barneo who became the reason Adrian is where he is today. Adrian joined Anthony Barneo's acting company Blue Sphere Alliance and had the opportunity to play multiple characters in the play \"A Piece of My Heart.\" Having no representation, it was this opportunity that landed Adrian an agent, manager, recurring guest star (Battery Park), and a lead in a feature film (Artie). Through the success of his Ovation nominated performance in \"A Piece of My Heart\", Adrian has not stopped working and continues to enjoy countless television and film roles.\n\nSome of Adrian's favorite guest starring and recurring roles include: Magnum P.I., NCIS: Los Angeles, Hawaii Five-0, CSI: Crime Scene Investagation, 24, CSI: NY, JAG, Alias, Frasier and Summerland. Some of his favorite film roles include Chicken Girls: The Movie, S1m0ne (with Al Pacino), Graduation Night (with Abigail Spencer and Kevin Alejandro), Twice The Dream, Even In Dreams, All Or Nothing (jury award-winning film at the Hollywood Film Festival), Straight Jacket, and Artie (with Kevin Farley).\n\nAdrian's most visible character to date and by far, his most recognizable has been the role of Esteban Julio Ricardo Montoya Dela Rosa Ramirez from the mega hit Disney Channel show \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.\"\n\nAlisa Reyes is a born and raised New Yorker who is Irish, Italian and Dominican and now resides in California.

He was the first of three children. His father, J. H. Aalto, was a government surveyor. His mother, Selma Hackestedt, was of Swedish ancestry, she died in 1903. His father remarried and moved the family to the town of Jyvaskyla. There young Aalto attended the Normal School and the Classical Gymnasium, graduating in 1916. During the summer months, young Aalto accompanied his father on surveying trips. From 1916-1921 he studied at the Helsinki University of technology, graduating with a degree in architecture. While a student, Aalto worked for Carolus Lindberg on the design of the \"Tivoli\" area for the 1920 National Fair. At that time Aalto was a prot√©g√© of Armas Lingren, partner of E. Saarinen during the formative period of Finnish National architecture of Romanticism. Aalto served in the Finnish National Militia during the Civil War that followed after the Russian Revolution, when the nation of Finland gained independence from Russia.\n\nIn 1922-1923 Aalto worked for a project in Sweden, he collaborated with A. Bjerke on the design of the Congress Hall for the 1923 World Fair in Goteborg. He also designed several buildings for the 1922 Industrial fair in Tampere. In 1923 Aalto opened his first architectural office in Juvaskyla. In 1924 he married architect Aino Marsio, they had two children, Johanna (born 1925), and Hamilkar (born 1928). Aalto and his wife had their honeymoon in Italy. The Mediterranean culture made a profound influence on Aalto's creativity, it blended with his Nordic intellect and remained important to his visionary works for the rest of his life. The simple massing and ornamentation of the \"architettura mirwire\" of Northern Italy translated into Aalto's style with its balanced proportions, harmonious volumes rendered in stucco or wood, and sparse decoration with selective use of classical elements. In 1927 the Aaltos moved to the city of Turku. There Alvar Aalto designed the Paimio Sanatorium, a building that elevated him to the status of master of heroic functionalism. He soon moved forward in his pursuit of artistic harmony through organic integration of people and buildings with the environment. Such was his design for the Villa Mairea (1938) in Noormarkku, one of the most admired private residences in contemporary architecture.\n\nIn 1933 Aalto moved to Helsinki. There he founded his architecture firm \"Artek\" where he executed his major international commissions, such as Finnish Pavilions for the 1936 Paris World Fair and the 1939-1940 New York's World Fair, libraries in Oregon, USA, and Finland, Opera House in Essen, Germany. His other significant buildings included Baker House at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass., USA, Central University Hospital in Zagreb, Croatia, Helsinki Institute of Technology, North Utland Art Museum in Denmark, Nordic House in Reykjavic, Iceland, Public Library in Vyborg, (now Russia), and many other buildings. His later masterpieces include the municipal building in Sayanasalo (1952), the Vuoksenniska Church (1959) and the Finlandia Hall in Helsinki. His works exhibit a range of innovative ideas presented with comforting clarity and carefully crafted balance of intricate and complex forms, spaces, and elements, that are integrated in a simple and well-proportioned way. Aalto's design for the Finnish Pavilion at the 1939 New York's World Fair was described as \"work of genius\" by Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nFunctionalism and synthetic attitude were important in Aalto's evolution from Nordic Classicism towards Modernism. He created his own way of converging forms, materials, and purpose of his buildings on the rationale of their functionality, aesthetics, and comfortable use. Aalto's architecture, furniture, glassware and jewelery evokes multiple allusions to images of unspoiled nature, thus making an ennobling influence on public behavior. He designed 70 buildings for the town of Jyvaskyla, 37 of which were realized, such as the Institute of Pedagogy (1953-1957) and other public buildings. Aalto's ecological awareness was epitomized in his design of the Sunila Cellulose Industry and the residential village for employees (1936 - 1939) and its second stage (1951 - 1954). Aalto's creativity was deeply rooted in his own organic way of life, traditional for the people in Scandinavian countries. \"The very essence of architecture consists of a variety and development reminiscent of natural organic life. This is the only true style in architecture\" said Alvar Aalto.\n\nAlvo Aalto was Chairman of the Arcitects Union and President of the Finnish Academy. His latest building for the Art Museum in Jyvaskyla was named after him. His awards included the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects (1957) and the Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects (1963). Alvar Aalto was featured on the last series of the 50 Finnish mark bill, before the Euro. He died of natural causes on May 11, 1976, in Helsinki and was laid to rest in Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nBelinda Owino was born in Houston Texas, with a great passion for the performing arts. Belinda's earlier training began at the historic Houston HITS Theatre, The Texas Renaissance Festival, and other local facilities along with starring in many play productions.

An optimistic vibe and holding on to an ambition has been the driving force behind Belinda's strive to succeed.\n\nDetermination and motivation led to Belinda's major opportunity when she worked with Quentin Tarantino and his dream team of a cast and crew in \"Django Unchained\" as a house servant in Candyland Plantation and as a stunt performer in the major fight scene in 2012. Belinda also graduated from The University of Texas Austin in the Fall of 2015 with a degree in film from the Department of radio, television, and film.
