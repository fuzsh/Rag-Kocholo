        "text": "Sunday, Feb. 19, 2023\n\nPastor Troy Brewer, OpenDoor Church, Burleson, TX\n\nThe tabernacle of the heavens:\n\nPSALMS 19:1-4\n\nThe heavens declare the glory of God;\n\nAnd the firmament shows His handiwork.\n\n2 Day unto day utters speech,\n\nAnd night unto night reveals knowledge.\n\n3 There is no speech nor language\n\nWhere their voice is not heard.\n\n4 Their line has gone out through all the earth,\n\nAnd their words to the end of the world.\n\nIn them He has set a tabernacle for the sun,\n\nTHE LINE AND THE TABERNACLE\n\nTHE LINE IS CALLED THE ECLIPTIC\n\nThe ecliptic or ecliptic plane is the orbital plane of Earth around the Sun. From the perspective of an observer on Earth, the Sun’s movement around the celestial sphere over the course of a year traces out a path along the ecliptic against the background of stars. The ecliptic is an important reference plane and is the basis of the ecliptic coordinate system.\n\nTHE TABERNACLE OF THE HEAVENS\n\n“According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle…even so shall ye make it” (Exodus 25:9).\n\nAn intriguing illustration of this principle is found in the Book of Numbers, Chapter 2, where the encampment of the Israelites in the desert is described in detail. During the 40 years of wandering between Egypt and the land of Canaan, the Israelites were commanded to pitch their camp in the same configuration every time.\n\nNumbers 2:2 NLT\n\n“The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying: ‘The Israelites shall camp each with his standard, (ensign, or sign as a standard) under the banners of their ancestral house; they shall camp around the tent of meeting at a distance.’”\n\nTHIS IS WHAT THE CONSTELLATIONS OF THE MAZZAROTH LOOK LIKE LINED UP ION THEIR SEASONS AND WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT TRIBE IS SYMBOLED BY WHAT CONSTELLATION THEY LINE UP\n\nThe appearance of the word in the Book of Job appears in the context of various astronomical phenomena:\n\nJob 38:32\n\n“Canst thou bind the chains of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? Or canst thou guide the Bear with her sons?”\n\nPsalms 147:4 (KJV)\n\nHe telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.\n\n9. Each star or cluster has a name given by God.\n\nGenesis 1:16 (NLT)\n\nGod made two great lights, the sun and the moon—the larger one to govern the day, and the smaller one to govern the night. He also made the stars.\n\n10. God made stars…why?\n\nGenesis 1:14 (KJV)\n\nAnd God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:\n\nWhat is the Mazzaroth?\n\nMazzaroth – Hb – mazzārôt – some noted constellation (only in the plural), collectively the zodiac\n\nMazzaroth refers:\n\na. to the twelve signs of the zodiac\n\nb. mentioned only here in Scripture\n\nMAZZAROTH AND NAZARETH COME FROM THE SAME ROOT WORD. THE PLACE WHERE JESUS IS FROM.\n\nThe name Nazareth means ‘a watch tower’ (now en-Nasrah), “A PLACE UP HIGH YOU WATCH FROM OR A PLACE UP HIGH YOU LOOK TO” but is connected in the New Testament with Netzer, ‘a branch’\n\nTHE MAZZAROTH IS THE PROPHETIC HISTORY OF GOD’S PLAN OF REDEMPTION PLACED IN THE HEAVENS BEFORE IT EVER HAPPENED\n\nTHE 12 SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC\n\nGOD’S PLAN OF REDEMPTION MADE KNOWN\n\nSIGN #1\n\nVIRGO THE VIRGIN\n\nTHE PROPHETIC PROMISE OF THE VIRGIN BIRTH OF THE MESSIAH, THE LORD JESUS CHRIST\n\n“Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,” which is translated, “God with us.”\n\nThe story in the heavens starts out the same as the story in the Bible. This is because both have the same Author. Remember, the story is the prophecy of the Messiah’s redemption and the first time we see the very beginning of that story in the bible starts out in a prophecy God spoke to the devil in\n\nGenesis 3:15\n\n“And I will put enmity\n\nBetween you and the woman,\n\nAnd between your seed and her Seed;\n\nHe shall bruise your head,\n\nAnd you shall bruise His heel.”\n\nThe answer to the problem would come from a woman. In a progressive prophetic Revelation we would learn that this child would be a divine child and this seed that He comes from would not be of human origin.\n\nThis child would be born of a woman, and she would be a virgin woman\n\nIsaiah 7:13-14\n\nThen he said, “Hear now, O house of David! Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also? 14 Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel\n\nThe first SIGN given of the messiah would be that a human would be born of a virgin. It makes since then, that the first SIGN in order of the heavens would be VIRGO the virgin.\n\nVIRGO is represented as a woman with a branch in her right hand, and some ears of corn in her left hand. She is a virgin with “seed” and it is impossible for a virgin woman to have seed because women don’t carry seed. Men carry seed and women carry eggs. She’s fertile, she’s a virgin, she carries seed and she is about to produce a harvest. This glorious sign doesn’t just speak of the virgin but the miraculous birth of the bringer of redemption\n\nLOOKING UP\n\nThe brightest star in Virgo the virgin is known to us as Spica. the Greeks, didn’t have any respect for its original name and from Latin means something like “the virgin’s ear of wheat or more likely corn”. Even this name speaks of the harvest that her child would bring and again it’s all about the seed of the corn. Jesus is the LORD of the harvest and before that was ever in the bible it was prophesied in the heavens\n\n2 Corinthians 9:10\n\nNow He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness;\n\nThe ancient name that is in all the old star-maps, connected to the Hebrew word Tsemech. It is called in Arabic Al Zimach, which means the branch. This star is in the ear of corn which she holds in her left hand. this is prophetic name of the seed of the virgin woman. The Branch.\n\nNow this prophetic name BRANCH is seen all over the heavens and consequently in at least 4 biblical prophecies about the coming of the messiah. In a lot of pictures of Virgo she is actually seen holding a branch. The branch that Mary held was a child and He was a divine seed that was foretold through the constellation Virgo.\n\nZechariah 3:8\n\n“Behold I will bring forth my SERVANT the BRANCH.”\n\nBefore that verse was written in the bible it was written in the heavens\n\nThe next brightest is called Zavijaveh, which means the gloriously beautiful.\n\nLook at what Isaiah 4:2 declares\n\nIn that day the Branch of the Lord shall be beautiful and glorious;\n\nAnd the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and appealing\n\nFor those of Israel who have escaped.\n\nSign #2\n\nLIBRA THE SCALES\n\nTHE PROPHETIC PROMISE THAT THE MESSIAH WOULD PAY THE TERRIBLE PRICE REQUIRED FOR OUR REDEMPTION. HE IS NOT ONLY MESSIAH BUT OUR REDEEMER BRINGING REDEMPTION.\n\nPsalms 49:8\n\nFor the redemption of their souls is costly\n\nAs we move into the 2nd part of this progressive revelation, we remember that we are still in the early stages of the dramatic story. There are certain precepts that must be known before we continue. So we come to Libra the scales and are confronted with the debt that must be paid.\n\nThese are heavenly scales and they tell the truth.\n\nProverbs 11:1\n\nDishonest scales are an abomination to the Lord…\n\nProverbs 20:23\n\nDiverse weights are an abomination to the Lord,\n\nAnd dishonest scales are not good.\n\nRedemption is a payment for a legal debt. A price must be paid for the redemption of man kind.\n\nDaniel 5:27\n\nTEKEL: You have been weighed in the balances, and found wanting;\n\nThis is the picture we have in the 2nd sign. Not only is our debt really bad news but it is impossible for us to pay the price for our bail. We are doomed forever in an eternal prison without a messiah/redeemer.\n\nPsalm 49:7\n\nNone of them can by any means redeem his brother,\n\nNor give to God a ransom for him—\n\nBit the hero of the story is the central figure in every sign. The good news is that this is the story of how we are redeemed by the only person who ever could redeem us. This story is the first prophetic revelation of Jesus Christ.\n\n1 Timothy 2:6\n\n…who gave Himself a ransom for all\n\nLOOKING UP\n\nHave you ever looked at the price tag of something you really wanted and knew there was no way you could afford it? This is the effect of seeing the sign of Libra. How long can you stand outside at night, look up at Libra and contemplate how we have missed the mark? How any centuries have the Jews contemplated the law and the sacrifice of atonement? To stand and stare at a scale, a devise that measures the weightless of justice can be a scary thing if there is no way to pay the debt.\n\nSo who will be the the one who will pay this price? We have already been introduced to him last month in the first sign. The seed of the woman. The one born of a virgin. The coming Branch.\n\nThe 3 minor constellations that go with the 2nd sign can be no greater pointer to who He is and how He would accomplish paying the price. Crux the cross, (He would die on a cross) Lupus or Victima the Victim, (He will remain dead 3 days) and Corona the crown, (He will rise again and overcome everything, being victorious over death).\n\nThe 2nd sign given of the Messiah won be that he was coming to pay the price, personally.\n\nLIBRA is represented as two giant scales in the heavens and is a constellation with 51 stars traditionally represented in it. It’s not a bright constellation but it has several bright stars in it that form a triangle.\n\nLibra is the Law.\n\nLibra is the wages of sin.\n\nLibra is bill that Jesus proclaimed was paid in full at the cross when He said\n\nJohn 19:30\n\n“IT IS FINISHED!”\n\nThe ancient Hebrew name for this constellation is Mozanaim and it means weighed in the balance or the weighing scales. In Arabic it is called Al Zubena, which actually means redemption.\n\nThe brightest is named Zuben al Genubi, which means the purchase, or price which is deficient. It kind of rhymes with Obi-wan-kenobi.\n\nThe other bight star also sounds like the Jedi master. Zubinalchemali. It means The Price which covers. This is the testimony of Jesus as described in Revelation\n\nAnd they sang a new song, saying: “You are worthy to take the scroll,\n\nAnd to open its seals: For You were slain, And have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,\n\nRevelation 5:9\n\nNow the Greeks thought Libra to be the same as the constellation Scorpio and the said that the two bright stars of libra were the claws of the scorpion. No. They are not the same but they the scales and the scorpion do go together.\n\nRomans 6:23\n\nThe wages of Sin (Libra) death (Scorpio)\n\nFor the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nBefore that was written in the Bible it was written in the heavens with these two constellations together because the author is the same.\n\nSTAR PARTY\n\nLibra is a fairly small and dim constellation with no very bright stars.\n\nIn the Northern hemisphere Libra can be seen from April to July.\n\nZubeneschamali and remember it sounds like Obi-wan-ken-obi, is a blue dwarf with a magnitude of 2.7 and is the constellation’s brightest star. It is 160 light-years away. It is the only star to appear green to the naked eye.\n\nLibra is home to the star Gliese 581, which has a planetary system consisting of at least 6 planets. It was the first extrasolar planet ever discovered and was a game changer for astronomists The Earth-like planet, orbiting inside a habital zone of the star was found in 2007. Another planet orbiting the same star, Gliese 581 e is the smallest mass extrasolar planet discovered orbiting a normal star.\n\nSince that first discovery there are more than 1,000 confirmed exoplanets discovered by the Kepler space telescope alone! Its has been hunting habitable planets for a while now.\n\nTHE HEAVENS DECLARE THE GLORY OF GOD\n\nSIGN #3\n\nSCORPIO THE SCORPION\n\nTHE PROPHETIC PROMISE THAT OUR MESIAH /REDEEMER WILL WAR AGAINST DEATH UPON OUR BEHALF\n\nRomans 5:8\n\nBut God commended his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\n\nThere is going to be a war!\n\nIn scene 3 of our 12-part drama in the heavens, we come to the beautiful but deadly Scorpio. Like the proverbial woman in the red dress, She can’t be ignored and our attraction to her could be deadly. Strung across the southern, summertime, night sky it is by far the largest and southernmost of all our southern constellations.\n\nThis is the enemy that must be defeated. The giant that must be slain. This is the sign that is associated with Christ’ warfare against death. The scorpion represents death itself. This is the enemy and the promise that Christ will come to destroy the works of the devil and bring life instead of death.\n\n1 Corinthians 15:55\n\nO death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?\n\nIn the first sign we learn that the Messiah will be the seed of a virgin woman, fully God and fully human.\n\nIn the 2nd sign we learn that the Messiah will the ransom for many and will pay the price that only a divine redeemer can.\n\nIn this, the 3rd sign we find out that the Messiah will be a mighty warrior who will confront and slap death in the face for all of us!\n\nHe will defeat the dragon by going into the jaws of the dragon itself. Jesus will win the war over death by dying!\n\nScorpio is seen as a giant scorpion with a bright red heart and a powerful stinger. Its claws are almost touching the scales of Libra and directly over the stinger is the foot of the man in the constellation Ophiucus, the man who is also battling the serpent. The constellation and the surrounding constellations are all about warfare and the intent of King Jesus to utterly defeat death, hell and the grave.\n\nLOOKING UP\n\nThe brightest star in Scorpio is one of the brightest in all the heavens. Anterez the heart of the scorpion and it dramatically shines blood red. The name of the star means wounding. This is prophetic of the messiah being wounded.\n\nBut He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed\n\nIsaiah 53:5\n\nThe first thing you notice about Antares is the amazing color. As already mentioned it is red. Since antares is a red super giant it’s color tells us that it is cooling down and it’s time is almost over. The different colors of the stars tell us where they are in a time line like in any kind of flame. At one time it was white hot and now it’s color is announcing that it’s days are numbered and the number is short.\n\nJesus is going to die but He will not stay dead.\n\nWhat is soon approaching is pronounced in\n\n1 Corinthians 15:53\n\nFor this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”\n\n“O Death, where is your sting?\n\nO Grave, where is your victory?”\n\nAntares is the 16th brightest star in the sky and 16 is the biblical number that represents the love of God. the heart of the King is greater than the heart of death and it is the love of God that will soundly defeat and bring an end to death for all of us\n\nGreater love has no man than this, that he should lay down Hs life for His friends.\n\nSIXTEEN AND THE LOVE OF GOD\n\nThere are 16 “baptisms” throughout the word\n\nThere are 16 commands given to the nation of Israel\n\nActs 15:25 the sixteenth time Paul’s name is mention he is called “Beloved.”\n\nSo as you grow in the Love of God you grow in your understanding of the Sixteen faces of His Jehovah Titles.\n\n16 Jehovah Titles\n\nJehovah Elohim The Lord Eternal or creator\n\nJehovah Adonai The Lord our Master\n\nJehovah Jireh The Lord our Provider\n\nJehovah Nissi The Lord our Banner\n\nJehovah Rapha The Lord our healer\n\nJehovah Shalom The Lord our Peace\n\nJehovah Tsidkeenu The Lord our righteousness\n\nJehovah Mekaddishkem The Lord our sanctifier\n\nJehovah Saboath The Lord of Hosts\n\nJehovah Shammah The Lord is present\n\nJehovah Elyon The Lord most High\n\nJehovah Rohi The Lord my shepherd\n\nJehovah Hoseenu The Lord our maker\n\nJehovah Eloheenu The lord our God\n\nJehovah Eloheka The lord your God\n\nJehovah Elohay The lord my God\n\nSo Scorpio is the sign that promises death will be overcome through a war that is won by the love of Almighty God.\n\nSIGN #4\n\nSAGITTARIUS THE ARCHER\n\nTHE PROPHETIC PROMISE THAT OUR OUR REDEEMER WILL WIN THE ULTIMATE WAR UPON OUR BEHALF\n\n1 Corinthians 15:54-57\n\nWhen the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.” “O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?” The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ\n\nHere the messiah is prophesied that He will be an archer, A man of great warfare who is not afraid to deal with the enormous problem of the scorpion (death). He is seen as a man of war on a horse and His arrow is pointed directly at the heart of the scorpion.\n\nHe is strong, full of grace and dual natured. This is the king of Kings as seen in revelation coming to conquer death.\n\nRevelation 6:2\n\nAnd I looked, and behold, a white horse. He who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.\n\nBEHOLD THE ARCHER OF HEAVEN!\n\nA Strong Bow represents covenant and in part 4 of our dramatic promise of redemption, we see He is one who will keep his promises.\n\nI set My (rain)bow in the cloud, and it shall be for the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth.\n\nGenesis 9:13\n\nRevelation 4:3\n\nAnd He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald.\n\nA bow and arrow prophetically represents deliverance\n\n2 Kings 13:17\n\nAnd he said, “Open the east window”; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, “Shoot”; and he shot. And he said, “The arrow of the Lord’s deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria;\n\nDUAL NATURED AND ON A HORSE OF WAR\n\nHe is portrayed by the greeks to be a centaur which is half man and half horse. They almost have the picture but not quite. He is actually a warrior riding on a warhorse who mysteriously has two distinct natures. He is both God and human being. Jesus Christ is the God-man.\n\nFully God\n\nIsa. 9:6; Matt. 11:27; 16:16; Mark 2:5-7; Luke 5:20-22; 9:20; John 1:1; 1:14; 2:19, 21; 3:13, 31; 5:18; 6:38; 8:58; 9: 38; 10:17; 10:30; 13:3; 14:9; 14:23; 16:15; 16:28; 17:8; 17:21-23; 20:28; Romans 9:5; 1 Cor. 10:3-4; 15:47; 18:4-6; 2 Cor. 8:9; Phil. 2:5-11; Colossians 1:15-17, 19; 2:9; 1 Tim. 1:17; 2:5; Titus 2:13; Heb. 1:2-3, 8-11; 2:7, 9, 14, 16; 13:8; 1 John 5:20; Rev. 1:8, 17; 2:8; 3:14.\n\nFully human\n\nMatt. 1:1, 18-25; 4:2; 26:38; Luke 1:26-38; 9:58; 22:44; John 1:14; 11:33-35; 19:28, 34; Romans 9:5; 1 Cor. 15:3; Gal. 4:4; Phil. 2:5-11; 1 Tim. 2:5; 3:16; Heb. 2:14-15, 17-18; 4:15; 10:5; 1 Peter 2:24; 1 John 4:2; 2 John 7.\n\nThe names of the brightest stars:\n\nAl Naim, the gracious one;\n\nRomans 16:20\n\nAnd the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.\n\nAl Shaula, the dart;\n\nExodus 9:23\n\nAnd Moses stretched out his rod toward heaven; and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and fire darted to the ground. And the Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt.\n\nAl Warida, who comes forth;\n\nRevelation 6:2\n\nAnd I looked, and behold, a white horse. He who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.\n\nRuchba or rami, the riding of the bowman.\n\nRevelation 19:11\n\nNow I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.\n\nRevelation 19:14\n\nAnd the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses.\n\nNun-ki, which means Prince of the Earth.\n\nProverbs 8:16\n\nBy me princes rule, and nobles, All the judges of the earth.\n\nPsalm 64:7-10\n\nBut God shall shoot at them with an arrow; Suddenly they shall be wounded.\n\n8 So He will make them stumble over their own tongue; All who see them shall flee away.\n\n9 All men shall fear, And shall declare the work of God; For they shall wisely consider His doing.\n\n10 The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and trust in Him. And all the upright in heart shall glory.\n\nSIGN #5\n\nCAPRICORN THE SEA GOAT\n\nTHE PROPHETIC PROMISE THAT THOSE REDEEMED WOULD BECOME ONE BODY WITH THE MESSIAH.\n\nHE IS LAYING DOWN HIS BODY TO REVEAL A NEW BODY. (THE BODY OF CHRIST)\n\nMark 10:45\n\n“For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.”\n\nThere is no such thing as sea goat just like there is no such thing as a centaur. In the last sign we were presented with the mystery of the dual nature of Jesus as both God and man at the same time. Now in this prophetic sign of the heavens we are presented with the mystery of the redeemer and the redeemed as one body.\n\nIn this picture in the heavens, The Goat is pictured as bowing its head as though he is dying and its right leg is folded underneath the body, as if He is laying down his life. The tail of the fish is not like that but alive and splashing around. When you understand that the goat is before and the fish is after, then you understand what the prophetic picture is all about.\n\nTHE GOAT IS THE SACRIFICE\n\n(Leviticus 10:16,17; 16:22)\n\nTHE FISH ARE THOSE WHO THE SACRIFICE WAS PAID FOR\n\n(Matthew 4:19 Jeremiah 16:16 )\n\nTHE SEA GOAT ARE THE TWO BECOMING ONE BODY. BOTH FULLY RESURRECTED AND REDEEMED.\n\nThis sign is fulfilled in the scriptures in\n\nJohn 17:20-23\n\n“I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word; 21 that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me. 22 And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one: 23 I in them, and You in Me; that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me\n\nSo out of His death (the goat) we would come to life (the fish) and be joined to him as one (the sea goat)\n\nCapricorn is the 2nd dimmest of all the constellations only behind cancer. This prophetically speaks of mystery and the necessity of searching out the matter in order to understand what is being said here.\n\nProverbs 25:2\n\nIt is the glory of God to conceal a matter, But the glory of kings is to search out a matter.\n\nTraditionally, there are 51 stars in the sign. Five are what Bullinger calls remarkable stars.\n\nThe brightest star a is named,\n\nDeneb Al Gedi, the sacrifice is coming. This is the promise of the messiah/reddemer\n\nOther star-names of other stars in Capricorn are\n\nDabih, the sacrifice\n\nAl Dabik and Al Dehabeh mean the same thing as Dibiah\n\nNishira: The bringer of good tidings (Luke 4:18)\n\nMa’asad, the one being slain\n\nSa’ad al Naschira, the testimony of the seperatted. (2 for 6:17)\n\nSTAR PARTY\n\nTo find the arrowhead-shaped Capricorn in the sky, look for the Summer Triangle and make a line from Vega through Altair to the lower southern sky\n\nRemember it is faint, but you know you have found it when you spot the triangle shape.\n\nIn the Northern hemisphere Capricorn can be seen from July to November.\n\nThe area of the night sky in which Capricorn is located is known as the ‘Sea’.\n\nThe ‘Sea’ is mostly inhabited by other ‘watery’ constellations such as Pisces and Aquarius.\n\nAlso known as Delta Capricorni, Deneb Algedi is a binary star system around 40 light years from Earth, the primary star in the system is a white giant with a mass and radius around twice that of the sun. Deneb Algedi is the brightest star in the constellation\n\nNashira (The faint star just next to the brightest star)\n\nAlso known as Gamma Capricorni, Nashira is a white giant star around 140 light years from Earth.\n\nSIGN #6\n\nAQUARIUS THE WATER BEARER\n\nTHE PROPHETIC PROMISE THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT WOULD BE POURED OUT UPON ALL THOSE REDEEMED\n\nActs 2:17\n\n‘And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God,\n\nThat I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh;\n\nYour sons and your daughters shall prophesy,\n\nYour young men shall see visions,\n\nYour old men shall dream dreams.\n\nNow that we have seen that a redeemed people come from the sacrifice, a new picture in the heavens rises up proclaiming that God will pour out His spirit upon them.\n\nThis is Aquarius, the water bearer\n\nLOOKING UP\n\nThis is a picture of a man pouring water out upon little fish. In some of the oldest pictures He is seen as pouring out water with fish in the water but all of the pictures agree as to what this representing. This is the picture of God’s goodness. This is How God blesses his people by pouring out His Holy Spirit and resurrection power upon those who are His.\n\nIsaiah 44:1-3\n\n“Yet hear now, O Jacob My servant, And Israel whom I have chosen.\n\n2 Thus says the Lord who made you And formed you from the womb, who will help you, ‘Fear not, O Jacob My servant; And you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.\n\n3 For I will pour water on him who is thirsty, And floods on the dry ground;\n\nI will pour My Spirit on your descendants, And My blessing on your offspring\n\nBefore that written in the bible it was written in the heavens because the author is the same.\n\nAquarius is pouring out His blessing. He is pouring out something he couldn’t until He had dealt with the enemy, death, at Sagittarius. He is giving out resurrection power and life!\n\nTHIS IS EXACTLY WHAT JESUS CHRIST WOULD DO FOR US, AFTER HIS RESURRECTION.\n\nRomans 8:15\n\nFor you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, “Abba! Father!”\n\nRomans 8:11\n\nBut if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.\n\n2 Corinthians 6:16\n\nOr what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said, “I WILL DWELL IN THEM AND WALK AMONG THEM; AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.\n\nTraditionally there are 108 stars in this sign.\n\nSIGN # 7\n\nPISCES THE FISH\n\nTHE PROPHETIC PROMISE THAT THE MESSIAH\n\nWOULD HAVE A BLESSED PEOPLE AND\n\nTHEY WOULD BE GREATLY MULTIPLIED.\n\nGenesis 22:17\n\nBlessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies.\n\nPisces represents the seed of Abraham. Those in covenant with Him, and there are two different kinds, natural and supernatural.\n\nThe Sign of Pisces in located in the part of the sky known as the sea. This part of the rotating drama represents the work of Jesus in the world (The sea) between His 1st and 2nd coming.\n\nIt is a symbol of 2 fishes tied together by a band to each tail. One of them is pointed vertical towards the North star and the other is represented as horizontal and is swimming in the flow of the ecliptic or the path of the sun.\n\nThe point is that one of these fish represents God’s natural nation (Israel) and the other God’s supernatural nation (Christianity). The was the promise God gave to Abraham that his offspring would be as the sands of the sea (Natural) and as the stars of heaven (Supernatural). Those who are born Jews and those who are born again as inwardly Jews.\n\nRomans 2:29\n\nbut he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men but from God.\n\nFISHING ON THE HIGH SIDE OF THE BOAT\n\nThese two fish look like a cross, one vertical and one horizontal. This is Sign that says heaven will invade earth through His people.\n\nThere they are, fully redeemed by the redeemer himself on that ancient roman instrument of death and shame. God’s people are seen as righteous, blessed and greatly multiplied.\n\nPsalm 33:12\n\nBlessed is the nation whose God is the Lord,\n\nThe people He has chosen as His own inheritance.\n\nThis is the sign that represents the abundant life Jesus is giving to His people\n\nJohn 10:10\n\n…I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.\n\nGenesis 48:26\n\n“Let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.”\n\nJohn 12:12\n\nThe next day a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,\n\nActs 14:1\n\nNow it happened in Iconium that they went together to the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of the Jews and of the Greeks believed.\n\nActs 17:4\n\nAnd some of them were persuaded; and a great multitude of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the leading women, joined Paul and Silas.\n\nRevelation 7:9\n\n[ A Multitude from the Great Tribulation ] After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands,\n\nRevelation 19:1\n\nAfter these things I heard a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, “Alleluia! Salvation and glory and honor and power belong to the Lord our God!\n\nSo Pisces represents the people of God both natural and supernatural. It represents the multiplied blessing of residents of heaven living in the earth who wait upon the return of Jesus Christ. It represents the Gosple of Jesus Christ and the presence of the Lord being carried to the entire reaches of the planet earth through His blessed people.\n\nThe brightest star is Pisces is called Kullat Nunu, Its means The chord of the fish. It is a bright giant star that is 294 light-years from Earth and has a luminosity that is 316 times that of the sun. Remember Pieces represents saved people with a message of hoop for the rest of the world. Guess what John 3:16 says?\n\nJohn 3:16\n\nFor God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.\n\nThis is the message of the multiplied fish in the earth and the brightest star in Pisces is discovered to be 316 light years away.\n\nSIGHN #8\n\nARIES THE RAM\n\nTHE PROPHETIC PROMISE THAT THE ONE WHO WAS SLAIN FOR OUR ATONEMENT WOULD BE GIVEN ALL POWER AND AUTHORITY TO MAKE ALL THINGS NEW\n\nMatthew 28:18\n\nAnd Jesus came and spake unto them, saying,\n\nAll power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.\n\nNEW BEGINNINGS\n\nThe constellation ARIES is all about the power of atonement and that Jesus makes all things brand new. Idolators throughout the centuries have seen something like this but couldn’t quite figure it out. Bulling writes that according to Herodotus, a Greek historian who lived at the same time as Socrates, the ancient Egyptians would have a new year party at the entrance of the sun into ARIES. They would slay a Ram and place branches over the doors of their homes.\n\nIt wasn’t much of a leap for God to tell His people that they were to slay a lamb at the same exact time and place the blood on the doorposts of their homes for the very first Passover. This was the emancipation of slavery for God’s people, and it starts with the blood of the lamb. (Exodus 11)\n\nYears later, the sun entered ARIES on the 14th of the Jewish month Nisan, and Jesus Christ, The lamb who takes away the sins of the world, was slain on Passover day in Jerusalem. This was the emancipation of slavery for all who would believe.\n\nIt was the beginning of something brand new and that’s what Aries is about. The POWER of Redemption. Newness of Life.\n\nRevelation 21:5\n\nThen He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me,\n\n“Write, for these words are true and faithful.”\n\nAries is pictured as a ram, or lamb, strong and full of life. he looks a lot different than the picture of the capricorn in that he is falling down and dying. Aries is all about this lamb ruling and regaining. It is the sign that represents the Kingdom Of God coming into the the earth and His people overcoming victoriously\n\nRevelation 12:11\n\nAnd they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony,…\n\nMatthew 6:10\n\nYour kingdom come. Your will be done\n\nOn earth as it is in heaven.\n\nJohn 1:29 “Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the sin of the world.”\n\nThere are 66 stars in this sign and were are 66 books in the bible. The bible and this constellation of the lamb who laid down His life as a sacrifice so that we should be righteous, and now has the power to make all things New, they both testify of Jesus Christ\n\nJohn 5:39\n\nYou search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me.\n\nRevelation 5:12\n\nsaying with a loud voice: “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain To receive power and riches and wisdom, And strength and honor and glory and blessing!”\n\nIf that doesn’t blow your mind, then let’s add this The brightest star is Alpha Arietis, which was first known as El Nath is an orange giant that is exactly 66 light-years from Earth! 66 books on the bible, 66 stars in the constellation and the brightest star is 66 light years away!! 66 is a number associated with the witness and the testimony of Jesus Christ to all flesh! That same bright star is also called Hamal, which is the Arabic word for “lamb” or “head of the ram.”\n\nTHE ISAIAH PROPHECY\n\nIt’s brightest star, is named El Nath, or El Natik, which means wounded, slain. The next brightest star, b is called Al Sheratan, the bruised, the wounded. The next brightest is called Mesarim (Hebrew), the bound.\n\nDoesn’t that remind you of another biblical prophecy?\n\nIsaiah 53:5\n\nBut He was wounded for our transgressions, (El Natik) He was bruised for our iniquities; (Al Sheratan) The chastisement for our peace was upon Him,( Mesarim) And by His stripes we are healed.\n\nBefore that prophecy was in the bible it was in the heavens, in the constellation Aries, or the crowned King was as a lamb once sacrificed, because the author of the bible and the heavens is the same.\n\nTHE #9 SIGN\n\nTAURUS (THE BULL)\n\nTHE PROPHETIC PROMISE THAT THE MESSIAH WILL COME BACK WITH HIS PEOPLE TO JUDGE AND TO RULE AND TO REIGN.\n\nJohn 14: 1-3\n\n“Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. 2 In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also\n\nEverything changes again at this constellation. We are now leaving the part of the heavens called “The sea” and now something very different is portrayed. The story of redemption as seen in the heavens is divided into three different parts or acts or stages as stated in the chapter on How it all works. This is stage three and the grand finally.\n\nTAURUS the bull tells us that Jesus is coming back and nothing can stop Him!\n\nHe is a Bull rushing forward in progression with an unstoppable momentum. he is seen as having fierce wrath and his horns are set so against as to enemies.\n\nThe Egyptian’s said this was mighty Isis. A demonic spirit that has now attached itself to Muslims throughout the world, but Isis is a word that means saves or delivers, and this is actually Jesus coming back to save Israel! I bet the Muslims of Isis today would choke on that revelation!\n\nThe more common Hebrew name for Taurus was Shur, which is from a root which means both coming and ruling and that is exactly what our Messiah Redeemer is coming back to do, take the horn to His enemies and rule and reign.\n\nThe stars in Taurus are very different than the other constellations because within the constellation of stars are 2-star clusters. Let’s look at this.\n\nThe brightest star, a (in the bull’s eye), is a star called Al Debaran, and means the leader or governor. Here Jesus is leading His church back to earth in a victorious battle.\n\nJoel 2:11\n\nThe LORD thunders at the head of his army; his forces are beyond number, and mighty is the army that obeys his command. The day of the LORD is great; it is dreadful. Who can endure it?\n\nRevelation 19:14\n\nAnd the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses,\n\nclothed in fine linen, white and clean.\n\nSIGN #10\n\nGEMINI THE TWINS\n\nTHE PROPHETIC PROMISE THAT THOSE REDEEMED WILL BE RIGHTEOUS AS THE ONE WHO REDEEMED THEM\n\n1 Corinthians 13:12\n\nFor now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.\n\nNow we come to the twins. These twins have been the stars that pagans would pray to for the purpose of navigation. Castor and Pollux was the name of the boat that sank in acts chapter 28 and Paul mentions it because the pagan gods couldn’t keep it afloat. It was also the sign that Romans and greeks swore by. “By Gemini” was something that people swore on in Roman culture and was probably what Jesus was talking about when He said\n\nMatthew 5:34\n\nBut I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne;\n\nThere was some kind of a hope presented in this constellation and the ancients who didn’t know God tried to imagine what that could be. This influence through the ages must of been what the Disney writers were referring back to when they had Jiminy or Gemini Cricket sing “When you wish upon a star”. Gemini has always had influences on cultures with a theme of HOPE\n\nAnd just like pinochio turning into a real boy, Those redeemed would be born again into the likeness of their creator, God Himself. This is what GEMINI is all about.\n\nThe Twins in the heavens are seen as having not been born at the same time but united in covenant. Just alike, in peace and in harmony. There is no scene of war here but perfect brotherhood.\n\nThe name in the Denderah Zodiac is Claustrum Hor, which means the place of Him who comes. When Jesus comes, we have an amazing place with Him. In Hebrew this is called Thaumim, which means united. We first saw a glimpse of this in Capricorn where the body of the fish (the church )is united with the body of the Goat (Jesus slain ) but they are 2 different body.\n\nJohn 17:11\n\nNow I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to You. Holy Father, keep through Your name those whom You have given Me, that they may be one as We are.\n\nJohn 17:22\n\nAnd the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one:\n\nIn Gemini they are different, they are twins and you can not tell the difference between the two. This is the progression of the revelation of our redemption!\n\nRomans 3:22\n\nThis righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference\n\nbetween Jew and Gentile\n\n1 John 3:2\n\n2 Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.\n\nOne of the twins bears in his right hand a palm branch. Some pictures show a club; but both the club or bow are in not in action. These united ones are are at rest and in peace after winning the victory. One is called Propus (Hebrew), the branch, spreading; another is called Al Giauza (Arabic), the palm branch; another is named Al Dira (Arabic), the seed, or branch.\n\nNAMES OF STARS\n\nThe brightest star and its name is Pollux. Pollux means “Very Sweet”\n\nPsalms 55:14\n\nWe took sweet counsel together,\n\nAnd walked to the house of God in the throng.\n\nThe next brightest star is Castor and it means to “to excel, to shine”. This is the hope of the saints!\n\nPsalms 60:1\n\nArise, shine; For your light has come! And the glory of the Lord is risen upon you.\n\nThe third brightest star is called Al Hena and it means God’s ring or God’s token of covenant.\n\nLuke 15:22\n\n“But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.\n\nSIGN #11\n\nCANCER THE CRAB\n\nTHE PROPHETIC PROMISE THAT ONCE GOD HAS REDEEMED HIS PEOPLE, HE WILL NEVER LET GO OF THEM FROM HIS POSSESSION\n\nJohn 10:28\n\nAnd I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand.\n\nJust before we come to the climax of our prophetic story of redemption, God tells us that He is not going to lose what He has worked so hard to gain. Our salvation is never in question once we are eternally secured and our souls will never be on the line again.\n\nCancer is the sign of the heavens that speaks of eternal security. It didn’t start off as a crab, the greeks perverted it as did the Babylonians and the Egyptians. The devil hates the idea of our eternal security in Christ. the Jews see Crabs as unclean, so the original sign was not a crab but the claws, or the idea of God holding on and never letting go is still in the heavens for us to behold!\n\nEven the word Cancer is offensive to us today. This is also a satanic plot to pervert the idea of eternal security. The disease was first called cancer by “The father of Medicine” Greek physician Hippocrates (460-370 BC). Where we get the medical term of the Hippocratic oath. The description was names after the crab because the finger-like spreading projections from a cancer called to mind the shape of a crab.\n\nLater a Roman physician, Galen (130-200 AD), who used the term oncos (Greek for swelling) to describe tumors. Oncos is the root word for oncology or study of cancers to this day.\n\nLOOKING UP\n\nThe Arabic name for this sign is is Al Sartan, which means who holds or binds, and in Hebrew it means to bind together (Gen 49:11). The Syriac name, Sartano, means the same thing.\n\nThe Greek name is Karkinos, which means holding or encircling, as does the Latin, Cancer, and hence is applied to the crab.\n\nThe idea is that Not only has gone redeemed His people, but He is going to KEEP His people. That’s what Jesus was talking about when He prayed in the garden.\n\nJohn 17:12\n\nWhile I was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name. Those whom You gave Me I have kept…\n\nThat’s exactly what the bible says in 1 Peter Chapter one.\n\n1 Peter 1:3-5\n\nBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time\n\nOur Salvation is incorruptible, it doesn’t fade away and it is kept by His power. This is cancer the Crab.\n\nThe sign contains 83 stars, one of which is of the 3rd magnitude, and seven are of the 4th magnitude, and the remainder of inferior magnitudes.\n\nThe brightest star, z (in the tail), is called Tegmine, holding.\n\nThe star in the lower large claw, is called Acubene, which in Hebrew and Arabic, means the sheltering or hiding-place.\n\nAnother is named Ma’alaph (Arabic), assembled thousands\n\nWe are safe in Jesus.\n\nSIGHN #12\n\nLEO THE LION\n\nTHE PROPHETIC PROMISE THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH WILL UTTERLY DESTROY THE ENEMY\n\nAND ULTIMATELY RULE OVER ALL\n\nHosea 11:10\n\nThey shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion\n\nSo we finally go to the end of the story. Leo is the book of revelation written in the heavens! The great Climax of this redemption story is the most dramatic of all signs in the heavens. Supported by the 3 minor constellations Hydra, the Serpent being destroyed, Crater, the Cup of God’s wrath poured out on the enemy and Corvus, the Bird of prey devouring at the valley of Armageddon we see what Leo is all about.\n\nThe Hebrew name of the sign is Arieh, which means the Lion. It’s not a tame lion but the word used for devouring its prey. It is pictured with His feet over the head of Hydra, the great Serpent, about to destroy it.\n\nThe brightest star marks the heart of the Lion. Its ancient name is Regulus, which means treading under foot.\n\nThe next star brightest star is in the tip of the tail, and this speaks of Jesus being there First and the last. This is the picture of the end of revelation and at the end of revelation Jesus says\n\nI am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.\n\nRevelation 22:13\n\nThis star is named Denebola, the Judge or The Lord who comes forward.\n\nThe star in the mane is called Al Giebha which means the exalted One.\n\nAnother star has the name of Minchir al Asad The Lion is punishing\n\nAnother is Deneb Aleced, the coming judge who seizes.\n\nAnd another is Al Dafera (Arabic), the enemy is put down.\n\nAnother star is named Sarcam (Hebrew), which means the joining; and Bullinger thinks that this intimating the point where the two ends of the Zodiacal circle have their joining.\n\nYou understand how the story ends. The good guy wins and he wins big.\n\nJesus the Messiah will put down and shamefully destroy all works of darkness.\n\nPaul put it this way\n\n1 Corinthians 15 24-27\n\nThen comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power. For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet. The last enemy that will be destroyed is death. For “He has put all things under His feet.” But when He says “all things are put under Him,” it is evident that He who put all things under Him is excepted.\n\nLeo is the Book of Revelation written in the heavens and revelation is a book about the MAJESTY of Jesus. He doesn’t come the 2nd time, the way he came the first time. He doesn’t show up as a 6 pound jewish baby boy. There is nothing vulnerable about Him in this picture. He is invincible and undefeatable. God’s people have nothing to fear because he is victorious!\n\nRevelation 5:5\n\nAnd one of the elders said to me,\n\n“Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah,\n\nthe Root of David, has conquered…\n\nEven so come quickly Lord Jesus. Come quickly.\n\nLeo is a highly recognizable constellation, as it is one of the few constellations that resemble its namesake. It is fairly easy to find because the “pointer stars” of the Big Dipper point to Leo.\n\nLeo lies between Cancer to the west and Virgo to the east.\n\nLeo is best seen in April at 9 p.m\n\nThe brightest star in the constellation is Regulus, which has surface temperatures more than twice that of the sun\n\nRegulus is 77 light years distant.\n\n77 is the number for the church and this is who there of the king beats for. The redeemed. His bride!\n\nThere are 77 generations of Adam to the Christ according to the evangelist Luke. (Lk 3,23-38)\n\nThe word church is found in the bible 77 times\n\nThe term house of God is found in the bible 77 times\n\nThe word GARDEN 77 times\n\nthe word REFUGE 77 times\n\nThe number 50 is used 77 times in the Bible. (those set free)\n\nThe verb to forgives also in the bible 77 times\n\nThe verb “to feed” is used 77 times in the NRSC.\n\nThe celestial wonder Haley’s comet comes back into view of the earth every 77 years and is a sign in the heavens that represents a word for the church\n\nThis blue-white beauty of a star is the only 1st-magnitude star to sit squarely on the ecliptic – Earth’s orbital plane projected onto the constellations of the Zodiac. The only one.\n\nThe heavens declare the Glory of God and the firmament shows His handiwork\n\nTHE STORY IN THE HEAVENS IN A NUTSHELL!\n\nVirgo – God is going to become a human being (Messiah)\n\nLibra – He will be a redeemer and pay the Price\n\nScorpio – The price he will pay is with His life and He will die\n\nSagittarius – He will resurrect from the dead and slap death in the face for all of us\n\nCAPRICORN – Out of His sacrifice will come a multitude of living and they will become one body\n\nAQUARIUS – He will pour out the Holy Spirit upon all His people\n\nPISCES – the nation of Israel and the body of Christ will come into holy covenant together\n\nARIES – They will have dominion through the blood of the Lamb\n\nTAURUS – Jesus will come back with the church in unstoppable moment of faithfulness\n\nGEMINI – When we see Him, we will be like Him\n\nCANCER – We will forever be the Holy possession of the Lord in full eternal security\n\nLEO – The Lion of the tribe of Judah will rule and reign forever and ever and where He is we will also be"
