Read, in White-Fryars, 1736 -English 0048 Table of Contents Chapter-01: To prove that the Bible has been falsely translated in those Places which speak of Witchcraft Chapter-02: That the Opinion of Witches has had its Foundation in Heathen Fables Chapter-03: That it hath been improved by the Papal Inquisitors, seeking their own private Gain, as also to establish the Usurped Dominion of their Founder Chapter-04: That there is no such Thing as a Witch in the Scriptures, and that there is no such Thing as a Witch at all Chapter-05: An Answer to their Arguments who endeavour to prove there are Witches Chapter-06: How the Opinion of Witches came at first into the World Chapter-07: The Conclusion\n\nReview: This book contains many contradictions when compared with Scriptures. New Testament clearly has mention of Witchcraft which in contrast to the claim made by this book. The book starts with mention of Act made in the Reign of King James-I concerning Witchcraft.\n\nQuote: \"I argue from the miserable Poverty of our vulgar reputed Witches, that they are wrongfully accused: For I am not willing to believe, that they have such a Power with the Devil, as to make him do wonderful things at their command, when they never command him to fetch them Money, and to fetch them Bread.\"\n\nReview:\n\nSalem Possessed: The Social Origins of Witchcraft by Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum\n\nReview: A book written in old English which where trials is written as tryals. Overall a good compilation of cases on witchcraft.\n\nReview:\n\nWitches of the Atlantic Wolrd - edited by Elaine G. Breslaw\n\nReview: To proof that Bible has any divine value, one need to first proove that Paul existed.\n\nReview:There are many more chapters, almost all commentary on Bible. Page-14- At the death of Noah, which occurred only two years before the birth of Abram, the unadulterated worship of the God of the Bible appears to have become almost extinct, for even the family of Abram, and, in all probability in his earlier years, Abram himself, were idolaters. Of this important fact in his history, we are informed in the book of Joshua, \"Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood (the river Euphrates) in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served OTHER GODS.\"\n\nTrial by Fire and Battle in Medieval German Literature by Vickie L. Ziegler\n\nThis book analyzes literary texts that provide some of the most vivid and detailed accounts of the medieval ordeal: the dramatic treason trials in late medieval Charlemagne epics. The two epics chosen -- Stricker's Karl der Große and the Karlmeinet -- treat trial by battle as the living legal reality it was in those times, yet display very different attitudes toward feud and punishment in their respective (13th- and 14th-century) societies. Gottfried's Tristan contains an ordeal by battle, of which the author approves, and an ordeal by fire, of which he does not, reflecting a common position of the intelligentsia of the time.\n\nTrial by Fire and Water: The Medieval Judicial Ordeal by Robert Bartlett. The Settlement of Disputes in Early Medieval Europe Edited by Wenvy Davies and PAUL Fouracnre\n\nIn trial by ordeal the accused was subjected to some harsh test - holding hot iron, being cast into a pool of water - with guilt or innocence decided according to the outcome. Although a strange and alien custom, trial by ordeal has been an important legal procedure in many regions and periods. Robert Bartlett here examines the workings of trial by ordeal from the time it first appeared in the barbarian law codes, tracing its use by Christian societies to its last days as a test of withcraft in Europe and America. He discusses recent theories about the operation and decline of the practice, shedding new light on both the ordeal as a working institution and the pressure for its abolition. The ordeal had a very wide range of applications: it was used more for serfs than for freemen; it was particularly applicable to alleged sexual and marital offences, and so was often applied to women; and above all, as a trial of faith, it was deemed by the twelfth century to be specially appropriate for cases involving oaths, lese-majesty, heresy and by extension witchcraft, where it had the added advantage not only of providing a public spectacle, but also of the very convenient argument that apparent innocence was itself evidence of the use of witchcraft. Whilst it was invoked under both canon and secular law, its religious character was attested by its Old Testament precedents.\n\nTable of Contents: Introduction, Early History, The Workings of the Ordeal in its Heyday -Types of Ordeal -Ordeal, Testimony, and Oath, The End of the Ordeal and Social Change -The Functionalist Case -The Persistence of the Ordeal -Exemptions -The Case of England, The End of the Ordeal: Explanations in Terms of Belief -Critics of the Ordeal -Clerical Interests, Trial by Battle -Trial by Battle: A Sketch -Battle and Ordeal, Aftermath -Disappearance -Replacement -Recrudescence, Further Reflections\n\nExcerpt:\n\nO God, the just judge, who are the author of peace and give fair judgement, we humbly pray you to deign to bless and sanctify this fiery iron, which is used in the just examination of doubtful issues. If this man is innocent of the charge from which he seeks to clear himself, he will take this fiery iron in his hand and appear unharmed; if he is guilty, let your most just power declare that truth in him, so that wickedness may not conquer justice but falsehood always be overcome by the truth. Through Christ.\n\nWith these words medieval priests initiated one common form of trial by ordeal. A man accused of a crime, or a man seeking to claim or defend his rights, would, after a solemn three-day fast, pick up a hot iron, walk three paces, and put the iron down. His hand would be bandaged and sealed, then, after three days, inspected. If it was ‘clean’ -that is, healing without suppuration or discoloration — he was innocent or vindicated; if the wound was unclean, he was guilty.\n\nSOURCE BOOK OF MEDIAVAL HISTORY: DOCUMENTS ILLUSTRATIVE OF EUROPEAN LIFE AND INSTITUTIONS FROM THE GERMAN INVASIONS TO THE RENAISSANCE --- EDITED BY FREDERIC AUSTIN OGG, A.M. ASSISTANT IN HISTORY IN HARVARD UNIVERSITY AND INSTRUCTOR SIMMONS COLLEGE\n\nPg-196: Chapter title - Tests by Hot Water, Cold Water, and Fire: \"The ordeal, having its origin far back in the times when the Germans were pagans and before their settlements in the Roman Empire, was retained in common usage after the Christianizing and civilizing of the barbarian tribes. The administering of it simply passed from the old pagan priests to the Christian clergy, and the appeals were directed to the Christian’s God instead of to Woden and Thor. Under Christian influence, the wager of battle (or personal combat to settle judicial questions), which had been exceedingly common, was discouraged as much as possible, and certain new modes of appeal to divine authority were introduced. Throughout the earlier Middle Ages the chief forms of the ordeal were: (1) the ordeal by walking through fire; (2) the ordeal by hot iron, in which the accused either carried a piece of hot iron a certain distance in his hands or walked barefoot over pieces of the same material; (3) the ordeal by hot water, in which the accused was required to plunge his bared arm into boiling water and bring forth a stone or other object from the bottom; (4) the ordeal by cold water, in which the accused was thrown, bound hand and foot, into a pond or stream, to sink if he were innocent, to float if he were guilty; (5) the ordeal of the cross, in which the accuser and accused stood with arms outstretched in the form of a cross until one of them could endure the strain of the unnatural attitude no longer; (6) the ordeal of the sacrament, in which the accused partook of the sacrament, the idea being that divine vengeance would certainly fall upon him in so doing if he were guilty; (7) the ordeal of the bread and cheese, in which the accused, made to swallow morsels of bread and cheese, was expected to choke if he were guilty; and (8) the judicial combat, which was generally reserved for freemen, and which, despite the opposition of the Church, did not die out until the end of the medieval period.\"\n\nReview:\n\nReview:\n\nChristian worship : its origin and evolution : a study of the latin liturgy up to the time of Charlemagne by Duchesne, L.

Even the year is uncertain. The latter, however, was determined at an early date from a consideration of two texts, Luke iii. 1, and Luke iii. 23, which imply a synchronism between the thirtieth year of Jesus. and the fifteenth year of the rule of Tiberius (28-29). As for the month and the day, Clement of Alexandria speaks of calculations which result in fixing these as the 18th or 19th of April, or even as the 29th of May. But these were private calculations upon which no festival observance could be made to depend. The book called De Pascha Computus, put forth in 243, either in Africa or in Italy, states that our Lord was born on the 28th of March.\"\n\nReview: Pg-258 \"Christmas was originally a festival peculiar to the Latin Church. St. John Chrysostom states, in a homily delivered in 386, that it had not been introduced into Antioch until about ten years before, that is, about 375. there was no observance of this feast either at Jerusalem, or at Alexandria. It was adopted at the latter place about 430. The Armenians did not observe it either.\n\nReview:\n\nReview: The title of the book also has following description: A History of Romanism for Nineteen Hundred Years; Its Opposition to Our Public School System and Effect Upon Our People and Government. INCLUDING AN ACCOUNT OF PRIESTLY MISRULE IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS AS MADE PUBLIC BY THE U. S. GOVERNMENT.\n\nReview: Quote from chapter [section] II: WHAT IS TRINITARIANISM? The Scriptures are silent. They never present God under any aspect but that of unity. Of a plurality of persons in the Godhead they know nothing. The doctrine of the Trinity then, informs us that the Godhead - consists of “three persons, Of one substance, power, and eternity”. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.”\n\nReview:\n\nKeywords: Canon Law, Human Law, Ecclesiastical Law\n\nReview: The subject-matter of Canon Law naturally falls into the following three divisions: (1) the first dealing with Canons generally and Canon Law; (2) the second dealing with the general Government of the Church and Jurisdiction; (3) the third treating of certain Essentials for the Church's holiness and maintenance upon earth; to which may be added (4) a fourth, treating of certain extensions of Church organisation in medieeval and modern times. Pg-6: The term Canon, from the Greek word kavwv, a carpenter's rule is ordinarily used to express a rule of conduct sanctioned by the Church at large, whether by enactment or by custom. Pg-7: In the New Testament a rule of doctrine or article of faith is also called a Canon, and in this sense the term is used by the Tridentine Council, and in more recent times by the Council of the Vatican. Pg-9: The Church is a divinely instituted, voluntary Society of persons gathered out of the world and placed in the way of salvation by being admitted within its fold.\n\nPg-12: The Church is One, seeing that there is \"One Lord, One faith, One baptism\", and that Christ prayed that His disciples all might be One. Hence expressions like the Eastern Church, the Western Church, the Church of Jerusalem, or Antioch, are inaccurate and misleading so far as they seem to imply a plurality of Churches. For no such plurality can exist, the Body of Christ being One, of which they all are parts. Pg-13: The Church is Catholic, which means (1) that it embraces men of all nations, herein differing from the older society of the Jewish covenant which was limited to one nation only, that of the Jews and (2) that it consists of the main body of the Christian society, steadfastly cleaving to the Apostles' doctrine and fellowship.\n\nBYZANTIUM AND THE ARABS IN THE SIXTH CENTURY by IRFAN SHAHID - Volume I - Part 1: Political and Military History\n\nINTRODUCTION: The Sources, The Sixth Century: A Synoptic View - PART ONE: POLITICAL AND MILITARY HISTORY I.

M.A. C.I.E. BARRISTER-AT-LAW A JUDGE OF THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE IN BENGAL, W. H. ALLEN & CO. LTD, 13 WATERLOO PLACE, PUBLISHERS TO THE INDIA OFFICE 1891\n\nReview: this book does not contain any section on Bibliography though there are inline references. The book on page-9 mentions \"Polyandry was universal and its earliest indication to be found in the Rig-Veda itself\". The statement \"Polyandry was universal\" itself tells about the intellectual capacity and scholarship of the author. The author has also given reference to Book of Manu but did not metion the chapter or paragraph of either Rig Veda or Book of Manu. In the last few pages of the book, there is a timeline of The Rashidin Caliphs, The Ommeyyade Sovereigns of Damascus, The Abbasid Caliphs of Bagdad and The Fatimide Caliphs of Egypt.\n\nOverall, this books is written by a kaphirophobe who ridiculed and demonized pagans while expressing supremacy of Islamic (rather Muhammandan) teachings. \"ANNALS OF THE EARLY THE CALIPHATE FROM ORIGINAL SOURCES\" by SIR WILLIAM MUIR, K.C.S.I., LL.D., D.C.I. \"BAGHDAD DURING ABBASID THE CALIPHATE - from - CONTEMPORARY PERSIAN and ARABIC SOURCES\" by G.

Levenson: The near-sacrifice and miraculous restoration of a beloved son is a central but largely overlooked theme in both Judaism and Christianity, celebrated in biblical texts on Isaac, Ishmael, Jacob, Joseph, and Jesus. In this highly original book, Jon D. Levenson explores how this notion of child sacrifice constitutes an overlooked bond between the two religions. Levenson argues that although the practice of child sacrifice was eradicated during the late seventh and sixth centuries B.C.E, the idea of sacrificing the first-born son (or the late-born son whose preferential treatment promotes him to that exalted rank) remained potent in religious literature. Analyzing texts from the ancient Near East, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and rabbinic literature, Levenson shows how tales of the son handed over to death by his loving father in the Hebrew Bible influenced the Church's identification of Jesus as sacrificial victim. According to Levenson, the transformation of the idea of child sacrifice was central to the accounts given by the people Israel and the early Church of their respective origins, and it also underlay the theologies of chosenness embraced, in their differing ways, by the two religions. Furthermore, the longstanding claim of the Church that it supersedes the Jews, says Levenson, both continues and transforms elements of the old narrative pattern in which a late-born son dislodges his first-born brothers. Levenson's book, which offers novel interpretations of several areas crucial to biblical studies, will be essential reading for scholars in the field.\n\nExodus 1-18 by William H.C. Propp --- \"Exodus is the heart of the Hebrew Bible, the defining moment in Israel’s birth as a people, the dramatic triumph of their God. Yahweh, Pharaoh, Moses, Aaron, the Hebrew slaves, the plagues, the parting of the Red Sea—these larger-than-life characters and epoch-making events capture the imagination of everyone from biblical scholars to moviemakers. However, the meaning and significance, the beauty and nuance, of this captivating biblical book are lost unless we have a world-class Scripture scholar to open our eyes to its riches. In Exodus 1–18, William H. C. Propp translates the original text in all its grandeur, then provides a masterful exploration and analysis of the book’s first eighteen chapters. Here the fate of the Hebrew slaves hangs in the balance of the dramatic conflict between the God of Israel and the Pharaoh of Egypt. From the discovery of Moses in a basket made of bulrushes to the story of the Burning Bush, from the ten plagues visited upon Egypt by God to water from the rock and quail and manna from the skies, Exodus is filled with the miraculous and the dramatic.\"\n\nProject Guttenberg Collection\n\nBetween Winds and Clouds: The Making of Yunnan (Second Century BCE-Twentieth Century CE) by Bin Yang --- Yang distinguishes himself with a global perspective on a Chinese frontier with a long term approach. The book examines the transformation of Yunnan, an ethnic and frontier province sandwiched by Tibet, mainland Southeast Asia, and southwest China, from a non Chinese culture into part of China during a period of over 2,000 years. Unlike existing scholarship which only emphasizes Chinese imperial efforts, the book has fit Yunnan in a broad world that was participated in by Southeast Asia, Tibet, the Indian Ocean, the modern European World-system, and East Asia, and demonstrated that both local, Chinese, and international forces interplayed in this long-term transformation.\n\nSocieties, Religion, and History: Central East Tanzanians and the World They Created, c. 200 BCE to 1800 CE by Rhonda M. Gonzales --- Gonzales uses historical linguistics to build the framework upon which she interweaves the findings of cutting edge-archaeologists as well as documented ethnographic sources taken since the late 19th century among such people as the Kaguru, Zaramo, and Gogo. Because the Swahili Coast is such a well-known region, this book is important in its own right, but it also is a part of an emerging body of new perspectives on the history of a large region of Africa that has been of worldwide significance since the early first millennium CE.\n\nConnecting Histories in Afghanistan: Market Relations and State Formation on a Colonial Frontier by Shah Mahmoud Hanifi: Hanifi focuses on trade, literacy, and state building in locating para-colonial Afghanistan in the contexts of imperial and capitalist histories. Connecting Histories is the first monograph-length treatment of the economy and society of nineteenth-century Afghanistan and the first sustained consideration of British Indian colonialism's formative impact on the country. The monograph engages a number of issues of comparative appeal, including the power of printed texts and the expansion of the bureaucratic infrastructure in Afghanistan, state-sponsored industrialization and commodity monopolization, and the important roles of minority and indigenous nomadic communities in a multi-ethnic state. In detailing the political economy of this trans-national frontier zone, Hanifi draws on an impressive blend of archival, narrative, and oral historical sources.\n\nBelongings: Property, Family, and Identity in Colonial South Africa by Laura J. Mitchell: Based on a decade of research, Belongings describes the contours of conflict among Dutch East India Company officials, settlers, indigenous Khoisan, and Indian-Ocean slaves. It intricately details the ways in which settlers themselves-rather than Company policy or an imperial army-brought a distant frontier first into a colonial orbit, then gradually under colonial control.\n\nSensual Encounters: Monastic Women and Spirituality in Medieval Germany by Erika Lauren Lindgren: Lindgren compares \"Sister-Books,\" the literature written in the female Dominican monasteries, with the material culture of the women's surroundings. She examines the ways in which spirituality becomes culturally constructed and the roles of physicality in religious behavior. She develops a holistic view of the intersection between materiality and spirituality in female monasteries.\n\nPursuit of an 'Unparalleled Opportunity': The American YMCA and Prisoner of War Diplomacy among the Central Power Nations during World War I, 1914-1923 by Kenneth Steuer: Comprehensively researched, this analysis sheds fresh light on both the general subject of WWI prisoners of war, and the role of one of the world's first NGOs, the YMCA. The author is particularly successful in demonstrating the Y's role in the increasingly chaotic conditions of East Europe, and merits credit as well for his insight into the synergy of Christian witness and secular tough-mindedness that informed the best of the Y's people.\n\nArms and the Woman: Just Warriors and Greek Feminist Identity by Margaret Poulos: Poulos explores the intersections of militarism, nationalism, and feminism, during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. She argues that the essentially ambiguous nationalist imagery of a woman warrior has not been entirely efficient in the women's emancipation agenda. The result is \"an ambitious, interesting, and successful dissertation.\"\n\nFrom Heads of Household to Heads of State: The Preaccession Households of Mary and Elizabeth Tudor, 1516–1558 by J. L. McIntosh: This study seeks to answer the question: if Tudor England was a patriarchal society, then how did two women—Mary and Elizabeth Tudor—consecutively succeed to the throne? In From Heads of Household to Heads of State: The Preaccession Households of Mary and Elizabeth Tudor, 1516–1558, J. L. McIntosh argues that Mary and Elizabeth established themselves as credible authority figures before their accessions by heading their own independent households.\n\nMiss Yourlovin: GIs, Gender, and Domesticity during World War II by Ann Elizabeth Pfau: What do shared beliefs about and behavior toward women tell us about the generation of men who served in the U.S. Army during World War II? This question drives Ann Pfau’s study of wartime gender roles. Focusing on five categories of real and imaginary women, Pfau uncovers conflicts of obligation and desire. These conflicts, although seldom directly articulated, were never far from the surface of soldiers' thoughts and beliefs about women, family, and home. By looking beneath the surface, we gain a deeper understanding of the nature of wartime military service and of the domestic yearning that sparked the postwar marriage and baby booms.\n\n\"Trivial Complaints:\" The Role of Privacy in Domestic Violence Law and Activism in the U.S. by Kirsten S. Rambo: In \"Trivial Complaints:\" The Role of Privacy in Domestic Violence Law and Activism in the U.S., Kirsten S. Rambo examines the history of domestic violence law and activism in the U.S., particularly as this history has been affected by privacy. Legal and cultural concepts of privacy have historically influenced the ways in which this society has understood domestic violence. Rambo explores the relationship between privacy and domestic violence through an analysis of domestic violence litigation that is historically situated.\n\nArchitecture and Memory: The Renaissance Studioli of Federico da Montefeltro by Robert Kirkbride: The studioli of the ducal palaces at Urbino and Gubbio, Italy, demonstrate architecture's capacity to transact between the mental and physical realms of human experience. In Architecture and Memory: The Renaissance Studioli of Federico da Montefeltro, Robert Kirkbride investigates the position of the studioli in the Western tradition of the memory arts, an approach not previously considered. Drawing on the densely layered imagery in the studioli and text sources readily available to the Urbino court, he examines how architecture equipped the late quattrocento mind with a bridge between the mathematical arts, which lend themselves to mechanical pursuits, and the art of rhetoric, a discipline central to memory and eloquence.\n\nCaught in the Crossfire: Adrian Scott and the Politics of Americanism in 1940s Hollywood by Jennifer E. Langdon --- In the summer of 1947, Crossfire, a controversial thriller exposing American anti-Semitism, became a critical and box-office hit, and RKO producer Adrian Scott was at the pinnacle of his career. Within several months, however, he was infamous as a member of the Hollywood Ten, blacklisted for his refusal to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee. In Caught in the Crossfire: Adrian Scott and the Politics of Americanism in 1940s Hollywood, Jennifer E. Langdon reconstructs the production and reception of Scott's major films to explore the political and creative challenges faced by Hollywood radicals in the studio system and to reassess the relationship between film noir, antifascism and anticommunism, and the politics of Americanism.\n\nPestilence and Headcolds: Encountering Illness in Colonial Mexico by Sherry Fields --- In Pestilence and Headcolds: Encountering Illness in Colonial Mexico, Sherry Fields explores the cultures of health and illness in colonial Mexico as illuminated by popular beliefs and practices following the encounter of indigenous and European medical traditions. Her use of ex-votos as sources is especially interesting.\n\nTrafficking Materials and Gendered Experimental Practices: Radium Research in Early 20th Century Vienna --- by Maria Rentetzi Trafficking Materials and Gendered Experimental Practices: Radium Research in Early 20th Century Vienna is \"a complex, creative, and fascinating study\" of women in Vienna working as independent researchers. She includes documentary research, material culture and built environment analysis, and oral histories to examine the culture of women in the unique positions of radioactivity researchers during the early twentieth century.\n\n\"Make It Yourself\": Home Sewing, Gender, and Culture, 1890–1930 by Sarah A. Gordon --- In \"Make It Yourself\": Home Sewing, Gender, and Culture, 1890–1930, Sarah A. Gordon uses home sewing to examine domestic labor, marketing practices, changing standards of femininity, and understandings of class, gender and race. As industrialization made ready-made garments increasingly available, many women, out of necessity or choice, continued to make their own clothing. In doing so, women used a customary female skill both as a means of supporting traditional ideas and as a tool of personal agency. The shifting meanings of sewing became a contested space where businesses promoted sewing machines as tools for maintaining domestic harmony; women interpreted patterns to suit—or flout—definitions of appropriate appearances; and girls were taught to sew in ways that reflected beliefs about class, race, and region. Gordon uses established as well as more unusual source materials, including dresses, sewing workbooks and paper dolls, to argue that home sewing is a unique vehicle for understanding larger changes in American culture.\n\nManhood in the Age of Aquarius: Masculinity in Two Countercultural Communities, 1965-83 by Timothy Hodgdon --- This is a study \"full of rich interpretation\" that explores the diverse forms of masculinity found in counter cultural radicalism. Hodgdon argues that conceptions of masculinity developed along two main lines: anarchism and mysticism. These are explored by examining the communities of the Diggers of San Francisco, and The Farm in Tennessee.\n\nHow Taiwan Became Chinese: Dutch, Spanish, and Han Colonization in the Seventeenth Century by Tonio Andrade --- The incorporation of Taiwan into the early modern European colonial trading networks, and its subsequent incorporation into the Chinese empire, are topics almost completely unexplored in Western language scholarship. This superb monograph not only opens them up but does so in an exciting way by exploring the complex interactions between the European trade diasporas and existing patterns of Asian migration and trade. The author is well acquainted with recent and current debates on the critical transformation taking place in the global economy during the late 16th and 17th centuries, and imaginatively covers a broad range of issues. He argues convincingly, and in wonderfully rich detail, that it was Dutch protection that made possible the slow Chinese colonization of Taiwan-and ultimately its incorporation into China. Andrade brilliantly reminds us of how important the brief episode of European occupation was to the future development of Taiwan, including the birth of its sugar industry.\n\nAdvocating The Man: Masculinity, Organized Labor and the Market Revolution in New York, 1800-1840 by Joshua R. Greenberg --- In his \"thorough, and imaginative exploration\" of the relationship between masculinity and the young labor movement in the Jacksonian era, Greenberg examines diverse sources, such as plays, debates about birth control and comic valentines. He argues that domestic issues and concerns guided workplace and political reactions to the new industrial economy.\n\nThe Creation of Color in Eighteenth-Century Europe by Sarah Lowengard --- Seldom does any monograph attempt to be comparative, in this case to cross the Channel and to say new and interesting things about the scientific culture found in both England and France. By using color, as a practice as well as a branch of optical theory, the author manages to weave material culture along with abstract science—again an integration seldom found in a first work.\n\nBuddhist Texts and Books\n\n\"The Wheel of the Law\" --- Buddhism, illustrated from Siamese sources by the Modern Buddhist, a Life of Buddha, and an account of the Phrabat (SIAMESE FOOTPRINT OF BUDDHA) by Alabaster, Henry - 1884. \"Life of Buddha\" translated \"from a popular Siamese work, Pathomma somphothiyan\": Preface - \"All Buddhists, throughout the wide range of countries where the doctrines of Buddha prevail, call their religion the doctrine of “The Wheel of the Law.\", Pg-xxix: \"We do not find an Athanasian Creed; for so far as this book enlightens us, we find that the Buddhist speaks of heaven rather than of hell, and never thinks of such uncharity as to damn everlastingly those who differ with him.\", \"We find Brahminical superstitions, a continual reference to Brahmin soothsayers and the Vedas, and an adherence to Brahminical rites in all matters pertaining to royal ceremonials. Those who know that by the Brahmins the Buddhists were extirpated from Central India, the birthplace of their religion, must wonder to see Brahmins and Buddhists pictured side by side in harmony.\"\n\nPg-16: After the religion of Buddha had spread abroad, a certain king, desiring to know the truth as to cosmogony, inquired of the monks, and they, knowing the omnisctence of Buddha, and yet fearing that if they said Buddha never taught this, people would say ‘your Lord is ignorant, and admired without reason, took the ancient Vedas, and various expressions in the Sutras and parables, and fables, and proverbs, and connecting them together into a book, the ‘Traiphoom, produced it as the teaching of Buddha. The people of those days were uneducated and foolish, and believed that Buddha had really taught it; and if any doubted, they kept their doubts to themselves, because they could not prove anything.\n\nPg-216: Wipassana, a Pali word, I suppose to be derived from the Sanscrit Pragna, (prachh, “to ask”), “a question.” Pg-251: Fah Hian mentions two footprints in Ceylon. \"Buddha, by his spiritual power, planted one foot to the north of the royal city, and one on the top of a mountain; the distance between the two being fifteen yojanas (say a hundred miles).”\n\nThe Life Or Legend Of Gaudama: the Buddha of the Burmese by Bigandet, Paul Ambrose, d. 1894\n\nCatalogue of Sanskrit and Pali Books in the British Museum. Trubner and Co. London. by Haas, Ernst (1876)\n\nA CATENA OF BUDDHIST SCRIPTURES from the Chinese by Samuel Beal: Excerpts --- \"It is well known that in many of the larger monasteries of that country there are to be found not only complete editions of the Buddhist Scriptures in the vernacular, but also Sanscrit originals, from which the Chinese version was made.\", Pg-1: \"Buddhist books began to be translated into Chinese so early as the middle portion of the first century A.D.\", \"...a careful study of the Chinese version of the Buddhist Scriptures may render to the cause of literature generally, but especially towards a critical acquaintance with the original Sanscrit text of the Tripitaka.\", \"the Avatamsaka Sutra, written, as it is said, by Nagardjuna, and which, under the name of the \"Fa yan King\" is one of the commonest and most widely circulated Sutras in China.\", \"The ideas found in the Inferno of Dante are many of them purely Buddhist. The conceit of the early painters who surrounded their saints with a glory of light is borrowed from the East.\"\n\npg-22: In reference to Sanscrit letters. These letters are like the old seal characters amongst us. They have remained the same from the creation of the world, unchanged through successive myriads of years. In this respect they differ from any letters we possess, for both the seal and the square characters with us have undergone numerous changes. The Sanscrit letters were originally imparted to men by Brahma (Fan tien), hence the books are called Brahma Books. For this reason all the Buddhas in delivering the Law have used Sanscrit words. The sound Om pronounced during worship is an acceptable offering to all the Buddhas.\n\nPg-40: “King Frasenajit asked Buddha if every Brahman, Tchatriya, Yaisya, and Sudra on returning to life would be born in his own caste.” To which Buddha replied; “It is possible it may be so, but the matter stands thus — there are four distinct classifications of men... According to the Agama Sutras, Buddha declared that there were eight causes and occasions of earthquakes.\n\nPg-372: It will be remembered that the earliest idea of the Universe, which seems to have prevailed (if we may judge from the architecture of the Stupas), down to about the period of Kanishka, was, that it consisted of a central mountain, Meru, around which were the seas and continents and girdles of rocks, and above, the abode of Indra and the thirty-three gods (symbolising, as it seems, the year, the four quarters, and the twenty-eight days of the month).\n\nChinese Buddhism by REV. JOSEPH EDKINS, D.D. --- Like most of the book written by Christian pastors, this book has used subtle means to demean idolatry and project Christian superiority. E.g. in the preface itself - page viii: 'Yet Buddhism is powerful in China by its doctrines. It has made the Chinese idolaters, and besides this it has taught them the wind and water superstition which has proved to be an effective barrier against civilised improvements and a most thorough hindrance to true enlightenment.\" On page xi: \"Science and philosophy on arriving in India originated science and philosophy in that country under new forms. Buddhism forsook the Veda religion so far as to omit all mention of the gods Varuna, Agni, and the Maruts. Buddha did not cite the Vedas as authorities.\" Another very typical example of how Chisrist colonizer tries to demean Hindus, pg-xiii: \"Hindu sculpture is based on that of Greece. Hindoo arithmetic is Babylonian in origin. Babylonian thought was adopted by the Hindoos, because it was more refined and profound than their own.\" They Christian cannot rely on the language of OT and need to show Greek better as it is language of NT. However, one good thing is that we can use this book to still show the arguments to be more assertive in favour of hinduism as an enemy will never try to write good thing about its opponent.\n\nThe book is more to interject Western Christist thought than actually describe the topic of the book. E.g. on page --- \"When the Buddhists began to teach races to whom the subtle Hindoo metaphysics were a riddle beyond their comprehension, they taught, for the Nirvana, a Western Heaven ruled by a newly-invented Buddha, and additional to the paradises of the Devas.\" Another geom coming from the cult who prosecuted astronomers for heliocentrix model of universe, page xxiii: \"Christianity fosters mental growth, and the science of the West is eminently stimulating to thought. The descendants of the men whose mariners sailed with the compass seven hundred years ago...\" From the reference nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/compass --- \"Chinese scientists may have developed navigational compasses as early as the 11th or 12th century. Western Europeans soon followed at the end of the 12th century.\"\n\nPage-2: \"The numerous Indian priests who came to China early in the Christian era were indefatigable translators, as is shown by what they have bequeathed to their disciples. These monuments of the highly civilised race that spoke the Sanscrit language, give to the inquiry a special literary interest.\" Page-12: \"The date of Shakya’s birth is very variously given. The Siamese, Peguans, and Singhalese, all using the Pali versions of the Buddhist classics, differ among themselves. The numbers as stated by them are b.c. 744, 638, and 624. The Chinese historian, Ma Twan-lin, mentions two dates as assigned by various authorities to this event, viz. 1027 and 668. The former is what is commonly given in Chinese books. What was the original language of Buddhism is another point not yet fully determined. .. to Buddha’s identity. If Sanscrit was the language in which he taught his disciples, it must have been just dying out at the time, for the old Buddhist inscriptions, in the countries watered by the Ganges, are in a dialect derived from the Sanscrit and differing little from Pali\".\n\nBooks on Women Rights and Witchraft\n\nPrimary Sources\n\nAbbot, George, The reasons vvhich Doctour Hill hath brought, for the vpholding of papistry, which is falselie termed the Catholike religion: vnmasked and shewed to be very weake, and vpon examination most insufficient for that purpose ...
