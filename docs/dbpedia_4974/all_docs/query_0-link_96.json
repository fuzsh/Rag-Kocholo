        "text": "Chasing Little Syria's A.J. Macksoud and his Phonograph Record Company\n\nA.J. Macksoud Phonograph Company Trade Mark.\n\nYou’ve seen his most common label before – a male lion rests on the ground, head up, looking off into the distance. A magnificently brilliant, rising sun with one eye visible, peeks from behind this king of beasts. The symbol of the lion and the sun are as old as ancient Egypt itself, but in this case the adapted iconography represents the Christian Saint Mark, the evangelist and apostle, believed to have established the Orthodox Coptic Church at Alexandria. Color variations of the label include: a black, pink, gold, white combination; a red, white, gold, pink; a pink, grey, white, and a red and gold. Some label variations include the same lion and sun (much smaller in size) set inside a symmetric, mosaic archway supported by four pillars (two) on each side. Most are printed with the address 77 Washington Street, New York, but a much rarer variant displays a man on a camel riding toward two pyramids, with two palm trees in the distance, the sun, and the address 89 Washington Street, New York at the label’s top. All were produced for A.J. Macksoud Phonograph Record Company in the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s.\n\nThe First A.J. Macksoud Phonograph Co. label featured mostly dubs of Baidaphon 78 discs. Notice the 89 Washington St. address.\n\nVariations of the A.J. Macksoud Phonograph Company lion label. All had the 77 Washington Street address. This was the business address from 1923-1929.\n\nAll from Richard M. Breaux collection.\n\nArchway mosaic supported by four pillars label came in brown & gold, light blue & dark blue, and green & gold variations. Notice the smaller lion with the rising sun trademark and the 77 Washington Street address.\n\nFrom Richard M. Breaux collection.\n\nWe've had much to write about Alexander Maloof and his Maloof Phonograph Records label. Maloof the music teacher, record label founder, song writer, and former resident of New York’s Little Syria community on Rector Street in the 1920s eventually became Macksoud's neighbor in 1930- Maloof was at 92 Washington and Macksoud at 88 Washington. We know much less about Maloof's Washington Street neighbor and fellow record label owner and businessman, A.J. Macksoud.\n\nAbraham Joseph Macksoud (1878-1938) was born, according to the only government document that identifies his birthdate with any certainty, 29 August 1878 to Suzanne (Susie) Macksoud and Joseph in Greater Syria.[1] He reportedly immigrated to the United States around 1898 or 1900 (according to the 1920 and 1930 US Census), became a naturalized citizen, the same year his father died, in 1904, and through 1925 mostly lived with his mother and his older brother, Gabriel in Brooklyn. He married a Syrian woman named Fander Macksoud in 1926 (who only shows up in the 1930 United States Census). In total, Susie Macksoud had six children. She had one daughter named Jebdey and five sons or the so-called Macksoud Brothers – Gabriel, Elias, Abraham, Joseph, and Albert who ran a host of businesses in lower Manhattan including a camera shop, printing business, and their most lucrative venture – kimono manufacturing and sales. The brother’s first cousins, and later their children, also helped run the family businesses. Some of the cousins and children had the same first and last names, but different middle names. In 1906, the Brooklyn Eagle declared Elias and Joseph Macksoud “kimono kings” and “the wealthiest Syrians in America.” If not the wealthiest Syrians in America, the Macksoud Brothers were definitely some of the wealthiest business men in New York’s Washington Street-centered Little Syria. All of the Macksoud businesses operated under the moniker “Macksoud Brothers and Company” and in 1917 most, including Abraham J. Macksoud listed their residence at 162 or 164 Congress Street in Brooklyn.\n\nWorld War I Draft Registration Card for Abraham J. Macksoud, dated 12 September 1918. He's self-employed at his phonograph shop at 52 Broadway and lives ar 162 Congress in Brooklyn with his mother, Susan Macksoud. Courtesy of Ancestry.com\n\nOn the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge was another Arab immigrant community similar to that on Washington Street that would, by 1940, overtake Little Syria in lower Manhattan in population. As noted earlier, from 1904-1917, A.J. Macksoud lived at 162 Congress along with the other Macksouds who also listed 162 or 164 Congress in Brooklyn as their residence. From 1920 to 1927, Abraham and his mother moved to 199 Clinton Street in Brooklyn and in 1930 the Census noted he lived at 141 Joralemon Street in Brooklyn. This was his last known address in 1933. It’s likely that Macksoud took the Brooklyn Bridge to and from Manhattan, although the subway from Brooklyn to Manhattan became an option by 1915.\n\nA.J. Macksoud’s earliest documented business address was 80 Greenwich Street in Manhattan. As early as 1907, A.J. Macksoud dealt in Arabic language photograph records from host of labels which came to include Columbia, Victor, Baida (later Baidaphon), Odeon, and later Maloof and his own Macksoud. Advertisements for Macksoud’s phonograph store appeared in several Syrian American business directories published by Salloum A. Mokarzel, publisher and founder of Al-Hoda newspaper and Dr. Nagib Abdou’s more comprehensive and Syrian diaspora focused directory, Dr. Abdou’s Travels in America. Macksoud seems to have remained at the 80 Greenwich address until 1912 when he possibly opened two locations - one at 89 Washington Street and another at 52 Broadway. According to music historian and record re-issue producer Ian Nagoski, A.J. Macksoud paid for advertising in “every 1915 issue of Najeeb M. Diab’s Meerat-ul-Gharb (Daily Mirror or Mirror of the West).” These ads listed the 89 Washington Street address. Macksoud’s 1918 World War I Draft registration card lists him as “self-employed” at a “Phonograph store” living at 162 Congress in Brooklyn and working at 52 Broadway.\n\nAdvertisement for A.J. Macksoud Phonograph Co. at 80 Greenwich Street, New York in 1907. From Dr. Abdou’s Travels in America and Commercial Directory of the Arabic Speaking People of the World (1907).

Mokarzel & H.F. Otash, Syrian Business Directory (1908-1909). Courtesy of the Moise A. Khayrallah Center for Lebanese Diaspora Studies at North Carolina State University. https://lebanesestudies.omeka.chass.ncsu.edu/items/show/11374#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0\n\nBefore he recorded singers on his own label, Macksoud created a custom label that consisted of dubs of Arabic music back home. Early recordings of Zaki Mourad on Macksoud exemplify this and sported a label printed with the 89 Washington Street address. Many of the musicians who recorded on the Macksoud label in the 1920s recorded elsewhere, however some were exclusively recorded by Macksoud. Louis Wardiny, Salim Doumani, AssadDakroub, Naim Karacand all appeared on the label as did Andrew Mekanna, and Wadeeh Bagdady.\n\nMacksoud conducted steady business, but things didn’t always run smoothly for A.J. Macksoud. In 1922, he filed a protest with the United States Treasury Department’s Customs Service when he paid duty on “243 phonograph records examined at the appraiser’s store and found broken.” The tariff rate per the 1913 Revenue Act required “phonographs, gramophones, graphophones, and similar articles, or parts thereof” be taxed “25 per centum ad valorem.” Customs official cited the same law’s procedures on abandonment of perishable goods in Section II paragraph “X” to decide against Macksoud. As written, the law allowed importers ten days after receipt to liquidate and abandon “shortage or nonimportation caused by decay, destruction, or injury to fruit or perishable articles imported to the United States whereby their commercial value is destroyed….” While officials agreed that 78 rpm were non-perishable, they argued “no effort was made to abandon” the merchandise to the Government according to the law’s procedural practices. As the importer, Macksoud had to bear the burden of the loss. Sending fragile 78s by post and parcel plagued sellers and customers then as it does now.\n\nIn 1922, Macksoud was forced to a tariff on broken 78s because he did not \"abandon [them] to the Government.\" A.W. Mellon, United States Department of Treasury Decisions Under the Customs and Other Laws, Volume 41 (January-June 1922), 568.\n\nEven sorting out where Macksoud’s shop or business operated becomes difficult to confirm. Macksoud seems to have been at 80 Greenwich from 1907-1910. Then he spent one or two years at 19 Rector Street. By 1912, he opened a space at 89 Washington Street, but moved to 52 Broadway in 1917. While every variation of his label except one read “77 Washington Street” as does Macksoud’s advertisement in the 1923 Talking Machine World, his often-spotted decorative gold and black dealer’s sticker always had 88 Washington Street embossed on it. This was his business address from 1930 to 1933. A short article in the Talking Machine World combined with a few listings in the New York City directories may shed some light on why occasionally Gabriel, Alex, and Albert Macksoud appear in connection with A.J. Macksoud Phonograph Company and the business had two addresses from 1917 to 1922 .\n\nThe first of these appeared in 1918 New York City directory. “Macksoud Abr J phonographs 52 Bway h162 Congress Bkn” tells us the obvious about Macksoud’s business and home address, but the last entry under the Macksoud surname reads “Macksoud & Co (Gabriel & Alex Macsoud) phonograph 89 Washn.” Alex G. Macksoud had the same business address and occupation in the 1920 and 1922 directories, but Gabriel appeared as a diamond broker also working at 89 Washington. Abraham was not listed at all in the 1920 directory, but in the U.S. Census for the same year, he showed up as an independent and self-employed Victor Talking Machine dealer.\n\nNotice in 1918 the city directory lists Abraham Macksoud in the phonograph business at 52 Broadway, while Gabriel and Alex did the same at 89 Washington Street (a well-known Macksoud address). Gabriel, Alex, and Abraham have the same residential address. New York City Directory, 1918. Courtesy of Ancestry.com\n\nFinally, two articles in the1923 Talking Machine World mentioned Macksoud. One maintains, “Mr. Macksoud making prompt deliveries to the dealers” and the other notes that the Euclid Music Co. “secured wholesale representation for the foreign records imported by Macksoud, of New York.” Taken together, it seems that although Abraham Macksoud served as the primary owner of the record company, his family worked as dealers at different locations. Furthermore, Abraham had to establish relationships with other businesses to sell records to Arab American communities outside of New York’s Little Syria.\n\nAd for A.J. Macksoud Records including on his own label. Notice the 77 Washington Street Address in 1923.\n\nAdvertisement and short article from Talking Machine World Magazine, 15 October 1923, p. 168 and 51. Courtesy of https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Talking-Machine/20s/Talking-Machine-1923-10.pdf\n\nSusie Macksoud died in July 1934. Abraham J.

One has to attribute the overall confusion and difficulty with tracking these individuals to the fact that neither most immigration officials, nor most Census takers would have spoken Arabic.\n\nMap of A.J.

Maloof (1884-1956) This photograph of Alexander Maloof appeared in his 1924 Oriental Piano Music by Alexander Maloof: Syrian Popular Folk Songs From Richard M. Breaux collection. One of the most prolific and versatile composers, producers, orchestra leaders, and business owners in the first five decades of the twentieth century was Alexander R. Maloof. Collectors of 78 rpm records have written quite a bit about Maloof. His 78 rpm records are still highly sought after. Much of what has been published about Maloof’s personal and professional life is filled with contradictions about birthdate, death date, and place of death, but it’s our hope to shed some light on the complex life of this father of Arab American music. Depending on what sources one consults, Alexander Maloof was either born in 23 January 1884 or 1885, the second of six children to Abraham and Hanna Maloof in Zahlé, Greater Syria (now Lebanon). The Maloofs immigrated to the Unite\n\nAlbert Rashid: Rashid Sales Company, Al-Chark /the Orient and the Largest Selection of Arabic Records in the United States\n\nAlbert Rashid A young Albert Rashid. Southeastern High School, The Aryan Yearbook, 1930, p.61. Courtesy of Ancestry.com Depending on whether you’re an old timer who purchased your 78 RPM Arabic music discs via mail order in the 1930s from Detroit or you visited one of the brick and mortar locations of Rashid Sales Company on E. 28 th Street in Manhattan or the 191 Atlantic Avenue site in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, or 155 Court Street store in the 1990s and 2000s, Albert Rashid became known for one of three things – Arabic-language film and soundtrack distribution, his Al-Chark or Orient Record label, or his world famous record and music store Rashid Sales Company. By World War II’s end, in Brooklyn, New York, Rashid’s Al-Chark label and Fred Alam’s Alamphon engaged in a friendly but heated competition that rivaled that of Alexander Maloof’ s Washington Street-based Maloof Records and Albert J. Macksoud’s records in the 1920s.

Naif Agby, El Debke; author's collection. The 78-RPM era overlapped with the first two waves of Arab immigrants to the United States. The first was roughly 1880 to 1944 and the second spanned approximately from 1944 to 1966. While we can situate a few of the musicians on Arab and Arab American 78 rpm records to the first wave, most first wave musicians enjoyed careers that encompassed both eras. Still others, like Sana and Amer Khadaj , Odette Kaddo , Hanaan , and Naif Agby and Kahraman, who recorded on Alamphon, Orient Records, Sun Records, and Alkawakeb, clearly make up the second wave. It is remarkable, although not surprising, that most of these musicians not only knew each other, but performed together live and on record. Nayeh Ejbeh or Naif Agby was born in Ehden, Greater Syria (now Lebanon) to Wadah Yamin and Joseph Ejbeh on either 22 June or 27 December 1920.

Louis Nassour Wardiny (sometimes Ilyas Wardini) was born 5 March 1894 in Beirut, Greater Syria (today Lebanon) to Nassour and Clemence Wardini . Some documents suggest he immigrated to the United States around 1904 with his family and, for part of his life, lived in Little Syria in Lower Manhattan. Other documents mark his arrival in April 1913, coming to the US from Beirut to La Harve and then New York City. Immigration documents note the change of name from Elias to Louis and give his occupation as both bookkeeper and singer at various points. In 1917, when the Victor Talking Machine Company still expressed interest in Arab recording artists, Wardiny debuted with 12 sides on six records. While Arab immigrant market clambered to hear more from Wardiny, Victor executives soon shifted direction away from its Arabic and Greek immigrant\n\nMohamed Said ZainEldeen: Fragments in the Life of an Early Columbia Records' Tenor\n\nMohamed Said ZainEldeen: Fragments in the Life of an Early Columbia Records' Tenor Mohamed Said ZainEldeen.

There are several early-period Arab American musicians for whom we have so little information we can hardly compose a narrative that provides anything other than the most basic biographical information. Walim Kamel and Zakia Agob are among them. For others, we have slightly more, but still incomplete information. The tenor M. ZainEldeen stands out as one. We've long had one M. ZainEldeen 78 RPM record and most recently, after we undertook piecing together scraps of his biographical information, we acquired another. As usual, we scoured over immigration documents, U.S. Census data, city directories, and three-quarters of the way through, we located and corresponded with surviving relatives - here's what we found. Mohamed ZainEldeen was born 1 November 1892 in Homs, Syria. Originally, his name was Zain E\n\nHanan: “Don’t Miss Her Wherever She Will Be!!!”\n\nHanan/ Hanaan (Jeanette Hayek Harouni) Hanan/Hanaan, Caravan 12 January 1956. Courtesy of Newspapers.com Only a handful of Arab or Arab American singers were known and are remembered by a single name. There was Asmahan, Karawan, Kahraman , and, of course – Hanan or Hanaan ! Hanaan or Hanan was born Jeanette Nehme Hayek on 8 November 1929 in Beirut, Lebanon. She was one of five children born to Jacob Hayek and Wadiha Atik Hayek. Ironically, the same year Jeanette’s birth the first Lebanese film, The Adventures of Mabrouk , was released. Jeanette displayed the talents of an actor and singer early on and received classical Arabic music training. Jeanette first traveled to Brazil in 1947 and again in 1948 to perform in concert with Wadih Saffi. Jeanette's mother accompanied her on the trip. Compare and contrast two of Hanan's four identity documents for Brazil.

Fordson Yearbook (1954), 144. Courtesy of Ancestry.com Since we launched Midwest Mahjar, rare has been the opportunity to speak to any of the artists who performed during the 78 RPM era. Most are no longer with us. We've communicated with the children of some musicians. Family members we've managed to track down include the grandchildren or great-grandchildren of 78-era Arab American musicians. \"Fadwa Obeid\" is on a Wiki-list of living Lebanese women singers, but with no birthdate or link to additional information. An Arabic-language Wikipedia entry offers information about the height of her career in the 1970s and makes vague reference to her retirement, but says nothing of her early life, early career, or life in retirement. Imagine our surprise when researching Arab American singer Fadwa Abeid, we located contact information for her.

Courtesy of Frank J. Dalton. Back in November 2020, we received a generous donation of about ninety 78-rpm Arabic records from retired dentist Joe Corey, who grew up in West Virginia. Mr. Corey contacted us because his friend, fellow church member, and labor lawyer, David Khorey, came across some of our Arab American musician profiles featured on the Arab America news website. Over dinner, and pleasant discussion about Arab American history, David asked me, “Do you know how people got their records?” I replied, “Some people ordered records from a catalogue and had them shipped from New York. Also, dealers likely sold records as vendors at regional SOYO meetings, mahrajan, hafla, and regional Syrian-Lebanese club conventions.” He then recalled a well-known vendor from his youth in western Pennsylvania who dressed in t\n\nOdette Kaddo: Arab music, it gives me Life!\n\nOdette Kaddo Odette Kaddo, 1956. From 23 May 1957, The Caravan. One of the major differences between first wave and second wave Arab immigrant musicians to the United States is the enormous amount of press coverage Arab expressive culture received in the Arab American press during and after World War II. This is the case for both Arab-language and English-language newspapers targeted at readers of Arab descent. Careful study of Al-Hoda newspaper in the 1910s and 1920s and The Syrian World in the 1920s and 1930s turned up very little information about Arab or Arab American record labels and musicians during this era. Similar examination of the Arab American press during and after World War II yielded exponentially more about the haflas, mahrajans, phonograph record labels, and musicians popularly known in Arab American communities across the United States. The growth and technological developments in recorded sound after WWII meant that second-wave Ar"
