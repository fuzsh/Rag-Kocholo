        "text": "The Texas State Historical Association is a group of independent and professional historians who are interested in promoting and preserving the history of Texas and its many peoples. The founding mission of the TSHA since 1897 is “to foster the appreciation, understanding, and teaching of the rich and unique history of Texas and, by example and through programs and activities, encourage and promote research, preservation, and publication of historical material affecting the state of Texas.”\n\nWe pursue this mission through educational events, programs, and publications. For over a century, TSHA has been the leading authority on Texas state history, and we hope to continue to serve the people of Texas well into the future.\n\nAt this time, the Texas State Historical Association is not collecting materials. We suggest that you reach out to your local historical society, or to a historical society focused on your particular topic. Here are some useful resources to get started:\n\nAustin History Center: https://library.austintexas.gov/ahc/about-us\n\nHouston History Archives: https://libraries.uh.edu/locations/special-collections/houston-history/\n\nPortal to Texas History: https://texashistory.unt.edu/\n\nBriscoe Center for American History: https://briscoecenter.org/\n\nTexas State Library and Archives (TSLAC): https://www.tsl.texas.gov/\n\nYou may want to search online for a more local home for your items. Many counties have their own historical societies that may be able to help you. Your local public library may also have staff to help you find a home for your documents. These organizations are too numerous to list here, but a simple online search should yield more specific results.\n\nFor questions regarding membership, please contact [email protected].\n\nFor questions about educational programs, please contact [email protected].\n\nFor questions related to website administration or Legacy of Texas online store, please contact [email protected].\n\nFor questions related to the Southwestern Historical Quarterly (including how to submit articles), TSHA Press book publications, or publishing a book manuscript with TSHA, please contact: [email protected].\n\nFor questions related to the Handbook of Texas, authoring or revising a Handbook entry, and Texas Day by Day, please contact: [email protected].\n\nFor questions related to the Texas Almanac, please contact: [email protected].\n\nThere are a couple things you will want to find out in this search. First, it may be tricky to track down biographical information about the people who are buried there, especially if they were born before the formal registration of birth certificates (1903 in Texas). If there is no state vital data on these individuals, you may have more luck finding birth, marriage, and death information from their church, if you happen to know what church or denomination these individuals attended and if the records still exist. Failing that, search all churches in the area for their vital statistics.\n\nIf you want to survey the graves yourself, you will want to familiarize yourself with some of the laws applicable to private cemeteries. The Texas Historical Commission has put together a comprehensive guide on how to locate and handle unregistered graves: https://www.thc.texas.gov/preserve/projects-and-programs/cemetery-preservation/maintenance-conservation-and-repair/locating. If you choose to investigate the grave, you will likely need to hire a qualified archaeologist to properly conduct the excavation. A full list of qualified archeologists working in Texas is maintained by the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) on their website: http://counciloftexasarcheologists.org/?page_id=5.\n\nIf you have questions about your possible connections to a specific Texas Indigenous group, we suggest reaching out directly to them. Some contact information is below:\n\nFederally recognized Texas tribes:\n\nAlabama-Coushatta tribe: https://www.alabama-coushatta.com/\n\nKickapoo tribe: https://kickapootexas.org/\n\nYsleta del Sur Pueblo (Tigua) tribe: https://www.ysletadelsurpueblo.org/\n\nState recognized Texas tribes:\n\nMount Tabor Indian Community: http://mounttaborcommunity.org/\n\nLipan Apache tribe: https://www.lipanapache.org/\n\nYaqui tribe: https://www.tbyi.gov/about-us\n\nTribes with historic populations in Texas:\n\nComanche Nation: https://comanchenation.com/\n\nCaddo Nation: https://mycaddonation.com/\n\nCherokee Nation: https://www.cherokee.org/\n\nFor general information about Texas Indigenous groups and their land, please see: https://native-land.ca/\n\nBefore undertaking such a line of research, you may find some use in the following article written by an Indigenous DNA researcher: https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129554-400-there-is-no-dna-test-to-prove-youre-native-american/\n\nInformation on specific pieces of property can be tricky to find. One approach is to search the address in a database of newspapers, such as Newspapers.com or LexisNexis.com. Another approach is to search in the digital or physical records of the local county tax assessor, who will have a complete record of the property’s ownership and likely usage history. Best of luck with your search!\n\nThis is a very interesting question. First you would need to define what precisely you mean by ranches and South Texas (what size? what boundaries?), and then you would want to narrow by time period. Questions such as this may seem very simple to answer, but they involve interpretation of a range of different kinds of sources. The Handbook of Texas is a useful resource in undertaking a historical inquiry of this nature. Best of luck with your search!"
