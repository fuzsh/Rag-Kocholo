        "text": "Even though The Bible claims that God alone created the stars, and gave each one a name of their own, anyone who even suggests The Zodiac is anything more than Satan’s exclusive domain is instantly branded a fool or heretic. Instead of seeing the stars of Heaven as divine instruments of creation, Christians insist they’re vile tools of Hell to be avoided at all cost. However, a thorough examination of Scripture clearly reveals that not only were the individual stars named by God but the constellations were also designated by Him: Arcturus, Orion, the Pleiades, and the like. What’s more, these stars and constellations weren’t created just to be mere ornaments beautifying the night sky but are, says Scripture, intended to convey signs and wonders to humanity, which expressly declare the glory of God.\n\nAs already shown, Virgo and her decans represent many Bible families such as Adam, Eve, Abel, and Seth; Abraham, Sarah, Ishmael, and Isaac; Isaac, Rebecca, Esau, and Jacob; Jacob, Rachel, and Joseph; and Joseph, Miriam, and Yahshua. Doubtless, there are still other connections between Virgo and various Bible characters that aren’t apparent to me now, but will be upon further study. In fact, this is likely true for many of the constellations in the Star Gospel. One of these is Orion, a decan of Taurus, the Bull. Let me show you how complex this constellation’s meaning can become when the Bible is used to decipher it.\n\nThe fixed stars were an inevitable source of cosmic meaning to Noah's family. Because the same patterns of stars are observable throughout the world, their imagery transcends the shifting panorama of_earthly experience and suggests the eternal. The constellations have always been a source of monogenetic speculation because remote tribes and nations sometimes interpret the same arbitrarily defined sets of stars with the sane arbitrary motifs, The constellations offer a field of symbolic images comparable to the interior of the Gundestrup panels. Twelve of these constellations lie along the plane of the solar system and constitute the twelve signs of the Zodiac, foundation of the ancient cult of astrology, these regions of stars acting as the pathway for the brighter bodies of the solar system: sun, moon, and planets. But most of the brightest stars lie in constellations either above or below the zodiacal line of the ecliptic. A Noahic interpretation of the Zodiac must also include the non-zodiacal constellations such as Orion, Auriga, Ursa Major, and Cygnus. A major interpretive problem is how many such non-Zodiacal constellations were part of the original Noahic scheme. 2/33-Because the zodiacal number twelve has universal theocratic significance, we would expect the complementary set of non-zodiacal constellations to total a multiple of twelve. Aside from the recently invented south circumpolar constellations, the handbooks on astronomy suggest totals of thirty-six or fortyeight, including the zodiacal twelve. Thirty-six is generally too low and forty-eight, a little too high without using a few recently invented patches of stars such as Lynx or Camelopardalis in the winter circumpolar region, treating these as ancient stellar regions without name. The figure of forty-eight is just twice the total of twenty-four, the foundation to the urban cults of Sumer. Positive evidence exists for a one-to»one correspondence between Sumerian cities and constellations, for example, between Sippar, cult city of the Sun God, and the faint zodiacal constellation of Cancer. The same logic applies to twenty-four imperial regions of the Near East. Gutium, for example, appears in an inscription as \"scorpion of the mountain,\" as though it were the designated region of the zodiacal constellation of Scorpius.\n\nThe gospel in the stars is a popular topic with many recent creationists. In an earlier paper, I examined some problems with this thesis. Since that earlier publication, the primary source on the subject has become available, allowing this much more detailed examination. In this current study, I identify many problems with the assumptions, methodologies, and conclusions made with the gospel in the stars thesis. The etymologies of terms and names are questionable at best and most likely are simply wrong. The biblical arguments are poor, and some conclusions are contrary to biblical principles. While well intended, the gospel in the stars is fraught with problems, and Christians are discouraged from using it.\n\nA considerable amount of the research into the 'Star of Bethlehem' has assumed that it was a unique celestial event. Such an approach, however, has overlooked the possible celestial information contained in the other features of both nativities of the gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke. This paper considers these other attributes. It adopts an archaeoastronomical and astrological approach to both narratives using the sky for the period of 07-06 B.C.E. as a primary document, as well as the Mesopotamian and Hellenistic astrological literature of the time. In the case of the Matthean pericope - the stories in Matthew's gospel - this approach suggests that the Star of Bethlehem is the title of a story rather than a single bright apparition. In the case of Luke's pericope it reveals that the attributes of the shepherds, angel, and the notion of a manger or a place for animals can be viewed as a Mesopotamian-influenced sky-watching discourse."
