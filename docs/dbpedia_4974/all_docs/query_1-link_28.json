As to their declared founders, orthodox Medicine often claims Hippocrates, Nursing claims Florence Nightingale, and Osteopathy claims Andrew Taylor Still.1, 2, 3 Chiropractic's founder is Daniel David Palmer. This profession is unique in that it claims not only to have the specific date, but also the name of one of the earliest, if not the first, patient. The purpose of this paper is to review the historical background and origins of Chiropractic Day, which is celebrated annually on September 18 as the birth of the chiropractic profession.\n\nDiscussion\n\nChiropractic in the Early Years\n\nWhen reviewing these events, it is important to interpret these circumstances considering the era in which people practiced and within the context of the social and cultural norms of those times. We also need to recall that medical interventions that we take for granted today, had not yet been established in the late 1800s when chiropractic began. For example, aspirin was not available until 1899.4 Though penicillin was discovered in 1928, its first clinical trial was not until 1941.5,6 And, the first randomized controlled trial in orthodox medicine did not occur until 1948.7\n\nIn the 1880s, the American Medical Association, which represented organized, regular medicine, was beginning to establish its cultural dominance within American healthcare.8 The Iowa Medical Society was strongly influencing state legislature and gaining more control over what types of healers were allowed to practice healthcare. In 1886, a law developed by Iowan regular medical doctors was passed that made it illegal to practice healthcare for any healer that was not a regular physician in their state. Thus, it was a challenging time for anyone who wished to practice healthcare outside of the regular medical profession.\n\nChiropractic originated in Davenport, Iowa, in the mind and at the hands of Daniel David Palmer. Many years before he declared the founding of chiropractic, he practiced as a magnetic healer without machines, gadgets, drugs, or surgery. Palmer practiced using natural methods, when regular medical doctors were still using heroic methods (ie, purging and puking), which had substantial morbidity and mortality risks for patients.9,10 Although some might try to demonize the magnetic practices of D.D. Palmer, his healing methods seem far safer compared to the heroic procedures offered by regular medicine at that time. So in following the Hippocratic oath, which was to first do no harm to patients (ie, primum non nocere),11 D.D. Palmer was both an advocate and practitioner. Thus, one could say that chiropractic was a reasonable choice for Americans who were searching for safe treatments for their ills.\n\nHe was an avid reader and continued to learn throughout his lifetime.12, 13, 14 This may have been because he was a schoolteacher earlier in his career and was trained to question and encourage others to be lifelong learners.15 He continued to develop ideas and propose new hypotheses even after he founded chiropractic.16,17 Thus, due to his inquisitive and creative nature, it is not surprising that his healing methods evolved starting when he began practicing as a magnetic healer and throughout his discovery and development of chiropractic.\n\nDuring the first 10 years, Palmer's magnetic practice thrived. Patients wrote letters describing their results from Palmer's treatments.18 ( ) However, there was a turning point in which his approach changed. Harvey Lillard was a patient that stood out in his mind. It seems that the association between Lillard's complaint and the treatment that Palmer delivered resulted in Palmer's revelation. He described the event in the 1904 volume 1 number 1 edition of The Chiropractor.19\n\n\"For nine years previous to the naming of Chiropractic, Dr. D.D. Palmer was practicing the healing art under the head of magnetic, but not as others, who slapped and rubbed. He aimed to locate in the patient THE CAUSE of each disease. … On September 18, 1895, Harvey Lillard called upon Dr. Palmer. The doctor asked him how long he had been deaf. He answered \"Seventeen years.\" He was so deaf that he could not hear the rumbling of a wagon on the street. Mr. Lillard informed the doctor that at the time he became deaf he was in a cramped position and felt something give in his neck. Upon examination there was found a displaced vertebra, a spine that was not in line. Dr. Palmer informed Mr. Lillard that he thought he could be cured of his deafness by fixing his back. He consented to have it fixed; we now say adjusted. Two adjustments were given Harvey Lillard in the dorsal vertebra, which replaced a displaced vertebra, freeing nerves that had been paralyzed by pressure... Mr. Lillard can hear today as well as other men. He resides at 1031 Scott Street, Davenport, Iowa.\"19\n\nDuring this period of discovery and development, Palmer began using the spinous process as a lever to adjust the vertebral column “back into alignment.”20 He continued to improve his techniques and questioned the fundamentals of health as to why some people became sick and others were well under the same conditions. In his own words from his 1910 text, D.D. Palmer recounted the events leading up to the first chiropractic adjustment.\n\n“One question was always uppermost in my mind in my search for the cause of disease. I desired to know why one person was ailing and his associate, eating at the same table working in the same shop, at the same bench, was not. Why? What difference was there in the two persons that caused one to have pneumonia, catarrh, typhoid or rheumatism, while his partner, similarly situated, escaped? Why? This question had worried thousands for centuries and was answered in September, 1895.\n\nHarvey Lillard, a janitor, in the Ryan Block, where I had my office, had been so deaf for 17 years that he could not hear the racket of a wagon on the street or the ticking of a watch. I made inquiry as to the cause of his deafness and was informed that when he was exerting himself in a cramped, stooping position, he felt something give way in his back and immediately became deaf. An examination showed a vertebra racked from its normal position. I reasoned that if that vertebra was replaced, the man's hearing should be restored. With this object in view, a half-hour's talk persuaded Mr. Lillard to allow me to replace it. I racked it into position by using the spinous process as a lever and soon the man could hear as before.”20\n\nSeveral years later, when pressed to report a day for the first chiropractic adjustment, D.D. Palmer said that Harvey Lillard's first treatment was on September 18. Although, the record shows that the exact date has been questioned and Lillard's treatment may have been on a different day or even the following year, September 18 has been the day traditionally celebrated.21,22 ( )\n\nThe Birth of Chiropractic Celebrated\n\nBy 1897, Palmer's school was just starting; thus, it was unlikely the birthday of the profession was celebrated that year. There were only 3 chiropractors at that time.23 Over the next several decades, the fledgling chiropractic profession would be fighting to survive when restrictive medical licensing laws deemed that its practice was considered illegal.24 Early doctors of chiropractic focused on establishing legislation and fighting battles in the courtroom.25\n\nIn 1905, the founder spoke at the Palmer School and Infirmary of Chiropractic (now known as the Palmer College of Chiropractic) June commencement ceremonies. 26 He reminisced about recent events and marveled at how the profession had grown. \"Little did I think nine and a half years ago, \" said the doctor, \"that I would see chiropractic reach such remarkable dimensions in so short a time. I never dreamed that within this short period our school would have 200 graduates and a class of 18 in one year.\"26\n\nIn 1913, D.D. Palmer died unexpectedly of typhoid fever, leaving others to carry on the tradition of telling the tale of the first chiropractic adjustment.27 In the same year, chiropractic gained ground in professional recognition. Kansas was the first state to pass a chiropractic licensing act, although it would not be until 1974 that the last state (Louisiana) in the US would legally recognize chiropractic. 28,29\n\nThe early years were challenging and the date of chiropractic's founding seemed to help fortify solidarity within the newly founded chiropractic profession. Early announcements about the birth of the profession were included in chiropractic advertisements. Since the profession was still emerging, these public announcements may have been produced to set professional precedence and to try to legitimize chiropractic practice in the eyes of the public. Some of these materials mentioned Harvey Lillard's tale about the cure of his deafness after several chiropractic adjustments to his spine and further described chiropractic in order to familiarize readers with this new profession.30 An example of an advertisement from 1915 includes a description of the birth of chiropractic.30 ( )\n\nEight years after his death, the dedication ceremony for D.D. Palmer's memorial bust was held at the Palmer campus in Davenport, Iowa in 1921. In addition to discussing the life of D.D. Palmer, people who knew him recounted stories about the first chiropractic adjustment and the speakers hailed September 18 as the founding date. ( )\n\nAs time passed, some chiropractors desired to have a more formal recognition of the birth of chiropractic. In 1928, Wray Hughes Hopkins, DC, reported that he conceived of a plan to celebrate chiropractic and presented his idea to Dr. Bartlett Joshua Palmer, President of the Palmer School of Chiropractic in Davenport.31 The aim of the celebration was to have chiropractors from around the world observe the annual event and “to identify themselves with the world's greatest natural healing science.” 32 He envisioned that there would be lectures, radio broadcasts, newspaper or magazine articles, and advertisements in local newspapers. B.J. Palmer supported the idea and Hopkins stated that the first global Chiropractic Day event was commemorated on September 18, 1928.32\n\nAs the years continued, so did the celebrations. On September 18, 1945, chiropractic's 50th golden anniversary was commemorated. An announcement in a Texas newspaper read \"Today marks the beginning of the celebration of Chiropractic's Fiftieth (Golden) Anniversary year. And over the nation Chiropractors and their patients are giving thanks for the founding of the profession which has done so much in so short a time to alleviate the illnesses and suffering of mankind.\"33\n\nBy the 1950s, it was estimated that there were approximately 23,000 chiropractors in North America and chiropractic claimed to be “the second largest profession of healing” in the United States.34 At that time, it was suggested that 33,000,000 patients received chiropractic care each year in North America. 34 The United States Congressional Record of 1952 declared Chiropractic Day as a day “to mark observance of the historical date on which Dr. Daniel David Palmer rediscovered the principles of chiropractic and gave a new science of healing to the world. Endorsed and sponsored by the National Chiropractic Association and other professional organizations, Chiropractic Day is internationally observed each September 18 by chiropractors.”34 ( )\n\nSamuel K. McConnell, Jr., Member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania's 16th congressional district, read aloud the presentation written by Hopkins. This 1952 announcement is assumed to be the first known official US congressional recognition of Chiropractic Day. The statement reminisced about the story of the treatment attributed to be the first chiropractic adjustment.34\n\n“All chiropractors know the story of Dr. Palmer's first adjustment of Harvey Lillard, and of how Lillard, who had suffered from an approximate 90-percent loss of hearing acuity for 20 years, was found by careful and impartial examination at the hands of his own medical physician, Dr. A. B. Hender, to have recovered his full auditory capacity after treatment by Dr. Palmer.\n\nThe basic principle of chiropractic is the premise that the nerve system controls all other systems and physiological functions of the human body, and that interference with the nerve control of these systems impairs their proper functioning and induces disease by rendering the body less resistant to infection or other existing causes.\n\nThe chiropractor is a physician—a special kind of physician, and as such is engaged in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of disease and in the promotion of public health and welfare.”34\n\nAs the years continued, so did the celebrations on September 18.35, 36, 37, 38 Likely because the day belongs to the chiropractic profession as a whole and to no particular organization or association, September 18 has been called many different names over the past 125 years. These include Chiropractic Rally Day, Chiropractic Anniversary, Chiropractic Founder's Day, Chiropractic Discovery Day, Chiropractic Celebration and Chiropractic Day. Celebrations have continued at various chiropractic schools, universities, associations, and practices as an annual event to celebrate the birth of the profession.\n\nChiropractic is a Profession Worth Celebrating\n\nChiropractic continues to grow throughout the world. In 2017, there were approximately 103,000 chiropractors practicing throughout the world, a majority (74.4%) were located in the US. 24,39 Chiropractors are active in various aspects of health care and have been integrated in a variety of health care settings.24,40, 41, 42 And, chiropractors have been part of interdisciplinary teams that have contributed to global efforts to improve spine care.43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50\n\nChiropractors are best known for helping people with neuromusculoskeletal complaints, especially of the spine. They have a variety of practice styles and use a range of techniques and modalities to care for patients.51 In the United States, doctors of chiropractic are distinct from other medical providers in that they have separate licensure and most do not use drugs or surgery in practice. Although there is a variety of chiropractic viewpoints and opinions about scope of practice, overall the public tends to associate chiropractic with care of the spine and a holistic style of healthcare.52\n\nMore and more people are seeking out chiropractic care. In the US, approximately 14% of the population has consulted a chiropractor annually and the number of people seeking chiropractic care continues to grow. 53, 54, 55, 56 A majority of US adults believe that chiropractic care is effective for back and neck pain and a majority believe that chiropractors are trustworthy. As well, patients report high satisfaction ratings for care provided by doctors of chiropractic.52,57, 58, 59\n\nChiropractors have developed and contributed to science-based guidelines and a majority in the US report practicing with evidence-based methods.24 For example, best practice evidence for chiropractic care includes: adults with headache,60 adults with neck pain,61 chronic spine-related conditions, 62 fibromyalgia syndrome, 63 health promotion, disease prevention, and wellness, 64 imaging practice guidelines, 65, 66, 67, 68 low back pain,69 lower extremity conditions, 70 myofascial trigger points and myofascial pain syndrome, 71 neck pain-associated disorders and whiplash-associated disorders, 72 and upper extremity disorders.73\n\nBased on its origins, it is not surprising that the procedure most associated with this profession is chiropractic spinal manipulation (ie, spinal adjustments).52,74 Chiropractic has been shown to be cost effective for many musculoskeletal conditions75 and to reduce pain and functional disability for patients with chronic low back pain. 76 It has been suggested that integration of chiropractic services results in decreased cost and improved health outcomes for some conditions compared with conventional medical approaches.77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86 Many medical guidelines for back pain include spinal manipulation, which is a mainstay in chiropractic treatment methods. 87, 88, 89, 90 Thus, this profession has much to contribute to helping people with various health concerns.\n\nCelebrating Chiropractic Day\n\nChiropractic has come a long way since 1895 and our origins are worth celebrating. Chiropractors should pause to remember what our predecessors did in the past that have enabled us to practice and serve the public in the present. The following are some suggestions to consider when celebrating Chiropractic Day. These activities could be implemented for a day or an entire month, are low cost or free, and can be very rewarding.\n\nCelebrate by educating\n\nChiropractic began with the earliest diplomas commanding graduates to go forth and to “teach and practice” chiropractic. 91 We should teach others about what chiropractic currently is and where it comes from. Since the first program was established, chiropractic education has continued to grow and improve. 23,92, 93, 94, 95 To celebrate Chiropractic Day, consider educating others about chiropractic.\n\n1.\n\nGive a lecture about chiropractic and health at your local community center or other organization.\n\n2.\n\nHelp our next generation of chiropractors by mentoring a chiropractic student.\n\n3.\n\nWrite an article about chiropractic for your local news media.\n\n4.\n\nDisplay a poster or flier in your practice or in your community to remind people about Chiropractic Day. In the online supplemental material, full versions of these fliers/posters are available to you for free to download and use. ( )\n\nCelebrate by learning\n\nLearn more about past and current events. As D.D. Palmer had continued to learn throughout his lifetime, chiropractors value ongoing improvement and lifelong learning. To celebrate Chiropractic Day, consider investing in your knowledge.\n\n1.\n\nLearn more about new research being published by chiropractors and others relating to chiropractic practice. If you are not already a subscriber of our chiropractic scientific journals, consider subscribing. There are many evidence-based articles relevant to practice. By subscribing you get to stay up to date on current science and knowledge within chiropractic.\n\n2.\n\nMarvel at the body's amazing capacity to heal. Learn more about the body's capabilities, such as homeostatic mechanisms or relationships between structure and function.\n\n3.\n\nLearn new information about the nervous and musculoskeletal systems and all of their capabilities.\n\n4.\n\nLearn more about the intricate relationships within the biopsychosocial model of care and how these factors relate to chiropractic.\n\n5.\n\nDiscover information about the history of chiropractic. Read journal articles about chiropractic, such as those found in the journal published by the Association for the History of Chiropractic (www.historyofchiropractic.org) or the Journal of Chiropractic Humanities.96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101\n\n6.\n\nRead historical chiropractic books that provide insight into chiropractic history and how those events relate to today.20,23,25,102, 103, 104, 105, 106\n\n7.\n\nHost a learning event, such as a book club or a lunch-and-learn, to discuss interesting chiropractic topics.\n\nCelebrate by honoring\n\nHonor those who have supported and developed chiropractic. Take time to reflect on the contributions and efforts of the people who have worked for over a century to help bring chiropractic to the world so that you may practice today. Honor our forebearers and appreciate the work and sacrifices that early chiropractors made so that chiropractic care is now legal and accessible. Remember that in some countries, the struggle to recognize chiropractic is still ongoing. To celebrate Chiropractic Day, consider honoring those who have come before you.\n\n1.\n\nReach out to those who mentored you during your development as a chiropractor. Thank people who supported you, including those who might not be chiropractors. Send them a note, an email, or reach out to them by phone, thanking them for guiding you on your career path.\n\n2.\n\nReach out to teachers who taught you during your chiropractic program. Let your favorite faculty member know how much he or she meant to you as you were developing as a student or young doctor.\n\n3.\n\nReach out to those chiropractors who are in your local region. Find members in your chiropractic association who have been practicing the longest. Send them a note thanking them for their service to the profession. Consider organizing an annual celebration for those who have served the longest in your association.\n\n4.\n\nDedicate a memorial donation to someone in the profession who has contributed but who may have passed. Consider donating in their honor to your favorite charity or to a non-profit chiropractic organization that supports research and education, such as to the NCMIC Foundation (www.ncmicfoundation.org).\n\nCelebrate by volunteering\n\nThe chiropractic profession has helped people since the profession began and continues to look for ways to do additional outreach. Since the beginning of the profession, chiropractors have focused on helping people, providing what is best for patients and communities.107,108 To celebrate Chiropractic Day consider volunteering.\n\n1.\n\nVolunteer for a local charity that you are interested in, such as one that helps to feed the homeless, help foster children, or assist those experiencing domestic violence. Pick a charity that is meaningful to you.\n\n2.\n\nVolunteer for your chiropractic association, such as being on a committee or workgroup.\n\n3.\n\nVolunteer to help with teaching children, such as a local literacy program or other educational support.\n\n4.\n\nIdentify your area of interest and match it with a charity. For example, if one of your family members has Alzheimer's disease or breast cancer, consider finding a relevant charity to which you can donate your time or service.\n\nCelebrate by engaging\n\nChiropractic would not be where it is today if it were not for individual chiropractors engaging in constructive and helpful work that advanced the profession. To celebrate Chiropractic Day, consider engaging by finding your strengths and applying them. Identify an interest or a strength that you have, then find a chiropractic association that matches. Chiropractic organizations need your participation to help make chiropractic even stronger. Many associations have both tangible (eg, discounts, newsletters) and intangible (eg, networking opportunities) benefits. Often the cost of membership is far less than what we gain by joining and participating. To celebrate Chiropractic Day, if you are not already a member of an association, consider joining one or more in areas of your interest. Here are some suggestions.\n\n1.\n\nIf you are good at debating or convincing others of your viewpoints, consider joining your regional or national chiropractic association.\n\n2.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about history, consider joining the Association for the History of Chiropractic (www.historyofchiropractic.org).\n\n3.\n\nIf you are interested in public health, consider joining the Chiropractic Health Care section of the American Public Health Association (www.apha.org).\n\n4.\n\nIf you are interested in one of the chiropractic specialties (eg, pediatrics, sports, nutrition, diagnostic imaging, orthopedics, and others), consider joining that chiropractic specialty group.\n\nCelebration of Chiropractic Day should be easy and fun. The day gives us time to remember our roots, to appreciate the present, and to look forward to the future. Regardless how you choose to celebrate Chiropractic Day, make it your own. It is certainly a day worth celebrating.\n\nLimitations\n\nThis is a narrative, descriptive report and only provides a singular viewpoint of historic events.
