Arrested in 2000 and prosecuted in a closed trial, she continued to campaign for human rights after being banned from practicing law for five years.\n\n\"We warmly congratulate Iranian rights activist Shirin Ebadi, who this week was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The prize also represents a moral boost for Iran's reformists, who have been the subject of a relentless campaign of intimidation. It is a clear indication to the country's conservative establishment that there is international solidarity for those who are struggling inside Iran to bring about democratic change and respect for human rights.\"\n\nClick below to listen to audio clips from an interview with Daniel Brumberg:\n\nAudio • Who is Shirin Ebadi?
