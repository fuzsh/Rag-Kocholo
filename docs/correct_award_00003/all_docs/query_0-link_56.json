        "text": "The Nobel Peace Prize for 2003\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2003 to Shirin Ebadi for her efforts for democracy and human rights. She has focused especially on the struggle for the rights of women and children.\n\nAs a lawyer, judge, lecturer, writer and activist, she has spoken out clearly and strongly in her country, Iran, and far beyond its borders. She has stood up as a sound professional, a courageous person, and has never heeded the threats to her own safety.\n\nHer principal arena is the struggle for basic human rights, and no society deserves to be labelled civilized unless the rights of women and children are respected. In an era of violence, she has consistently supported non-violence. It is fundamental to her view that the supreme political power in a community must be built on democratic elections. She favours enlightenment and dialogue as the best path to changing attitudes and resolving conflict.\n\nEbadi is a conscious Moslem. She sees no conflict between Islam and fundamental human rights. It is important to her that the dialogue between the different cultures and religions of the world should take as its point of departure their shared values. It is a pleasure for the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Peace Prize to a woman who is part of the Moslem world, and of whom that world can be proud - along with all who fight for human rights wherever they live.\n\nDuring recent decades, democracy and human rights have advanced in various parts of the world. By its awards of the Nobel Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has attempted to speed up this process.\n\nWe hope that the people of Iran will feel joyous that for the first time in history one of their citizens has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and we hope the Prize will be an inspiration for all those who struggle for human rights and democracy in her country, in the Moslem world, and in all countries where the fight for human rights needs inspiration and support.\n\nRelated BBC-links to be opened in new window:\n\nIran Nobel winner gets hero's welcome (14 Oct 03)\n\nMixed reaction, controversial success (14 Oct 03)\n\nNobel win sparks Iran controversy (14 Oct 03)\n\nIranian media split on Nobel (11 Oct 03)\n\nPeace award divides Iran (11 Oct 03)\n\nNobel winner's plea to Iran (10 Oct 03)\n\nProfile: Shirin Ebadi (10 Oct 03)\n\nShirin Ebadi's peace prize citation (10 Oct 03)\n\nOslo, 10 October 2003\n\nNorwegian Nobel Institute\n\nDrammensveien 19, N-0255 Oslo, Norway\n\nWebsite: www.nobel.no\n\nLinks will be opened in new window.\n\nBiography of Shirin Ebadi,\n\n2003's Laureate\n\nBOES.ORG\n\nMultilingual Human Rights\n\nInternational Campaign\n\nto Ban Landmines (ICBL)\n\nICBL NGO-links\n\nLaureates\n\n2004: Wangari Maathai.
