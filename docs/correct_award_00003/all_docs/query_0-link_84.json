Two days ago (April 21) she received Germany’s Roland Berger Human Dignity Award.\n\nEbadi is a lawyer, human rights activist, and the first Iranian and Muslim woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize. On Thursday, April 23, she will deliver the Kroc Institute’s 15th annual Hesburgh Lecture in Ethics and Public Policy to more than 700 people who have reserved tickets at Notre Dame’s DeBartolo Performing Arts Center. Her topic is “Human Rights in the Islamic World.”\n\nIn addition to her lecture, Ebadi will meet with students and Kroc faculty whose research focuses on religion and conflict. She is a Muslim who advocates for an interpretation of Islam that is compatible with democracy and human rights."
