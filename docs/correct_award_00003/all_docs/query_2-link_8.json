        "text": "Dr. Shirin Ebadi is an author, lawyer, and was the first female judge in Iran, living in exile in London since 2009. In 2003, she received the Nobel Peace Prize. Ebadi was a judge in Iran until 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution, after which she was no longer allowed to work. In 1994, she co-founded the Society for Protecting the Rights of the Child. In 2002, she co-founded the Defenders of Human Rights Centre (DHRC) with other lawyers to assist those working towards promoting democracy. After her Nobel Prize in 2003, she co-founded the Nobel Womenâ€™s Initiative in 2006, and used some of her prize money to support DHRC. In 2008, the Iranian government closed down DHRC by raiding her office."
