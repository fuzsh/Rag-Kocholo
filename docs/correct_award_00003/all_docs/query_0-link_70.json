        "text": "Article / Letter to editor\n\nThe 2003 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the Iranian human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, signifying the first Muslim woman to receive a Nobel Prize. The international recognition bestowed on Ebadi has re-invigorated the fight for human rights and democracy in Iran and elsewhere. It has also provided a much welcome change in the international image o f 'Muslim woman' as victim of tradition to active agent of social and political change.\n\nAll authors\n\nShahrokni, N.\n\nJournal\n\nISIM Newsletter\n\nVolume\n\n13\n\nIssue\n\n1\n\nPages\n\n6 - 7\n\nPublisher\n\nISIM, Leiden"
