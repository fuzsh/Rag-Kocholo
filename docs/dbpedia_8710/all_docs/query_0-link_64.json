Ghosh will soon start shooting for the next schedule of the film.\n\nFull filmi\n\nGhosh says, “Anees sir looked after me so well during the making of the film. Bobby also is so much fun to work with. I never found him intimidating at all. Sonam is a complete rockstar and a real darling. I’m looking forward to resuming work on the sets very soon, because for me, working on this film was like working and playing together. It’s the best combination of things that an actor can ask for professionally.”"
