        "text": "</>\n\nHow did you enter the TV world?\n\nI started my career as a Channel [V] VJ. I also was one of the 10 finalists of Indian Idol. This gave me a bigger platform where I was noticed. Thus, I made my foray into TV serials, my first one being Ekta Kapoor's Kaisa Yeh Pyar Hai.\n\nWhat are your current projects on television?\n\nI'm currently working in Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi on Star Plus. Here, I play the role of Manthan, Karan and Tanya Virani's son.\n\nWhat character do you play?\n\nMy character is typically of a bade baap ki bigdi hui aulad! Manthan is over confident and proud since his father's a billionaire. He misuses his power. Basically, his is a very selfish character.\n\nHow far do you relate to this character?\n\nI am diametrically opposite to the billionaire's son that I portray. We have nothing in common.\n\nCan you tell us something about your hobbies?\n\nI like singing, watching movies, listening to music and playing squash.\n\nWhich has been the happiest moment in your life?\n\nThe happiest moment of my life was when I signed my first television serial.\n\nWhat kind of roles do you like to play?\n\nI like to play characters which have lots of emotion and many shades. But more than positive characters, I like to play the negative ones as they call for more creativity and effort."
