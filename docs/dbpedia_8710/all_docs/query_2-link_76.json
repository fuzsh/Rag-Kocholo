        "text": "Good Morning\n\nPink seems to be the colour of the season going by the number of celebritiesâfrom Daniel Craig to Amitabh Bachchanâwho have reached for pink suits in the past month. At Indiaâs fashion week too, the mood seemed to be all about shades of pink, white and keeping it light. And thatâs our mood for this weekend too. Have a good one.\n\nThe return to the runway\n\nThe FDCI x LakmÃ© Fashion Week concludes in Mumbai tomorrow after a week of celebrating a return to the runway. The poker-faced models and air-kissing socialites were back as were the usual last-minute crises and tantrums. The difference this time though, writes Pooja Singh, was that vaccine certificates and face masks, not ID and social capital, guaranteed entrance. Designers showcased lighter clothing in bright, happy colours, seeming to wash away the pain and dreariness of the pandemic months. Do physical fashion shows matter in the pandemic era? That may be the subject of unending debate. For now, take a look at some of the showcases.\n\nHow the teaspoon got its shine\n\nTheyâre tiny and shiny, and woe is you if you lose one of a set, but if you if you donât like wet and wrung tea bags, youâd be a person who appreciates a delicate teaspoon. Itâs also often used as a measure in recipes but how did it get its name? Was it created for tea, asks Aravinda Anantharaman, and sets off to find out. She discovers that much like tea, the teaspoon also has links to colonialism and imperialism. Along the way, she also discovers the origins of the teacupâs handle.

Just when business hit a sweet spot, though, the pandemic struck and they had to prune the list of 215 outlets, closing down 28. Dalmia tells Rashmi Menon what it took to build up the brand, how theyâre changing strategy and what his favourite milkshake flavours are. Read more.\n\nDigging up the past\n\nWhat did early Indians eat? Did the ancients use passports? How did Harappans communicate? Indiaâs archaeologists have been quietly digging up pieces of history, and making little discoveries that answer the big questions. Theyâre analysing pottery shards for traces of fossilised food, peering at oddly-shaped seals to find out whether they were used as passports, and examining tools and jewellery to find out what kind of jobs people did. Theyâre finding out what we ate, how we lived and trying to understand how we evolved not just as a species but also as a society. Avantika Bhuyan picks five of the biggest finds of the past decade Read more.\n\nWhy Amitav Ghosh believes green growth is an illusion\n\nThroughout history, trade for pure profit, as author Amitav Ghosh tells Lounge, has been a cause of disastrous governance, exploitation, erasure of history, and inevitably, the climate crisis. He uses the example of nutmeg, which Europeans developed an appetite for, in his new book The Nutmegâs Curse: Parables For A Planet In Crisis to explain how colonial pursuits ended up destroying entire culturesâa story that continues to play out across the world. Thereâs no such thing as green growth, he tells Bibek Bhattacharya. Read the interview.\n\nThe big divorce of Indian tennis\n\nBreak Point, a new, seven-episode series by Nitesh Tiwari (Dangal) and Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari (Panga), uses Leander Paesâ and Mahesh Bhupathiâs often-differing recollectionsâand those of their parents, friends, coaches and opponentsâto tell the story of their rapid rise and equally rapid implosion of Indian tennisâ most successful doubles partnership. It has the feel of couples therapy: a long list of slights recalled and grievances aired, but also wistful memories of a time when the love was strong, writes Uday Bhatia. That their partnership disintegrated just when they looked set to dominate menâs doubles for a long time is one of the great tragedies of Indian sport. Read more.\n\nWeekend getaway: Visit the Red Taj\n\nAgra is known for the white marble beauty of the Taj Mahal but the city is home to many other marvels often missed out in the chase to see the monument to love. Among its hidden treasures are the cemeteries, the Civil Lines and the cantonment, which tell the story of this old cityâs links not just to the Mughals and the British but also to Armenian traders, French sailors, German mercenaries and more. And donât miss the âRed Tajâ, a monument of red sandstone with slender turrets and a dome built by a loving wife for her dead husband, writes Kalpana Sunder. Read more."
