        "text": "Search the Internet\n\nTips\n\nSites: Actresses, Actors\n\n'They say I look like Bipasha'\n\nNewcomer Reshmi Ghosh on life in front of the camera\n\nThe norm is, Miss India contestant practises her smiles, speaks about wanting to be Mother Teresa, sometimes wins an international crown and then make a lunge for the movies.\n\nIn\n\nReshmi Ghosh's book of dos, the order is a little skewered. The Femina Miss India Earth 2002 has already finished a 25-day shoot for Rajat Rawail's Saazish. While shooting for the film, she was juggling her dietary requirements, workouts and brushing up on her general knowledge to prepare for her Miss Earth Contest in Philippines, in October.\n\nThe Bengali beauty hates living alone in Mumbai, \"I was never strong and independent. This city has made me capable of living on my own. I miss home and there are times when I cry like a baby,\" she admits.\n\nShe speaks to\n\nArti R about beauty contests, life and films:\n\nOn Miss India: It was a dream. I didn't win any subcontests, so I was not sure whether I would win any of the big ones. I was probably the only one backstage who wasn't worried or scared. I gave it my best shot. If I deserved to win, I would.\n\nOn Saazish: I didn't want to wait to act because it has been a passion since my childhood. Also, I have been receiving a lot of film offers.\n\nRajat saw one of my pictures in the Times Of India and was keen that I do this film. When I met him, he didn't even ask for a screen test. He said, \"Reshmi, you are perfect for the role. You are just what I need in this film.\"\n\nHe promised me they would wrap the film in 30 days and I couldn't say no.\n\nRecent Features The Baba phenomenon\n\nSigns topples XXX\n\nDeepti Naval's comeback\n\nMy sister, Rani\n\nShekhar Sum on CMS\n\nAB's role in Agni Varsha\n\nPrashant on Chhal\n\nNew Hitchcock?\n\nBlue Crush in at US BO\n\nThere is no Rajni in Baba\n\nTo Rajni with love\n\nDevdas: The making\n\nMORE FEATURES...\n\nI had a blast shooting for the movie. I worked out, read up and prepared for my contest in the spare time. They (the unit) didn't hassle me at all. My costars --- Riya Sen, Milind Soman and Aryan Vaid --- and I were like a mini family. We were so much into our characters that we would actually call each other by the names of our characters.\n\nThe film is not a love story. It is a murder mystery and all actors have equal roles. I have two song sequences left to shoot in Mumbai. How I love song and dance.\n\nOn her character: What I like about my character in Saazish is that she is a very strong woman who loves herself and loves money. She is completely at odds with the person I am --- I'm very emotional, cry easily and love helping others.\n\nWhen I read the script, my role reminded me a lot of Bipasha Basu in her debut film Ajnabee. Ever since I had seen Bipasha in Ajnabee, I had wanted to do a similar role. I am told that we have a similar screen presence. We look alike because of our dusky skin and large eyes.\n\nOn acting: I have done many cameos in Bengali films. They prefer their leading ladies fair and fragile.\n\nLast year, I acted in two National Films Development Corporation films, but I wanted to be part of Bollywood. And I am not hyper about my first film --- I have worked hard."
