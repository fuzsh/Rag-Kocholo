        "text": "Thank you, Howie Xu, for the engaging discussion on Stanford's latest üìà \"The AI Index Report.\" This report visualizes the evolution of the AI landscape with solid data over the past decade, showcasing significant increases in AI-related publications, GitHub projects, and the cost of AI training, among other metrics. Sharing some charts in the comment. One interesting piece of data caught my eye ü§ì was that the data showing that the GPT-4 model currently outperforms non-expert human validators by 25%‚Äîa figure that was a lot lower than I had thought. Despite this progress, there remains a considerable gap to close before it can rival expert human validators. This underscores the critical importance of using verticalized data and collaborating with industry experts to enhance training models. On a different note, I have a different view than Hongkun Leng regarding the cost projections for training AI models. While üí∞ costs have indeed surged exponentially over the past year, advancements in GPU efficiency, breakthroughs in energy technologies, and the application of AI to optimize energy allocation and discover new energy sources are poised to slow down these expenses. I believe these innovations will significantly slow down the rising costs of AI model training. #GenerativeAI #AILandscape #Innovations\n\nüåü Speaker Highlight for AJCAI 2023 üåü Get ready for an enlightening session with Dr. Manik Varma, a Distinguished Scientist and Vice President at Microsoft Research India, at the upcoming AJCAI 2023!

Here are the four questions that caught my attention : Q1: Where Should Countries Around the World Start Their AI Journey? üåê A: Building AI Infrastructure is the most fundamental need, and it's not expensive. Then, countries must own their data and develop their national intelligence using AI. Q2: What's the Role of AI in Education? üìö A: The goal is to make AI tools so user-friendly that programming knowledge isn't necessary for everyone. AI should be accessible to all, allowing every individual to be a technologist in their domain. Q3: What's AI's Role in Society? üåç A: AI has the potential to address major challenges in society, like disease and resource limitations, heralding an era of discovery and innovation. Q4: Future of AI and Where Should It Focus More? üî¨ A: Biology is seen as a complex but impactful field. With AI, biology could shift from being a science of discovery to a field of engineering, leading to significant advancements in healthcare and sustainability. notes:https://lnkd.in/eA3TESdP ü§ñ Join the conversation: How do you envision the integration of AI in these areas? Share your thoughts! #AIJourney #AIinEducation #AISociety #FutureofAI #TechTalks\n\nAI Predictions for 2024: Stanford University HAI faculty and fellows share their forecasts for the next year in #artificialintelligence intelligence, covering topics such as #multimodal models, video generation, #deepfakes, AI regulation, #GPU shortage, and more. Erik Brynjolfsson: The director of Stanford Digital Economy Lab expects mass adoption of AI by companies that will affect #knowledgeworkers and enhance their #productivity and creativity. James Landay: The vice-director and faculty director of research at Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) anticipates big new multimodal models, especially in video generation, and more challenges and legislation around disinformation and deepfakes. Russ Altman: The Stanford HAI senior fellow and professor of bioengineering, genetics, medicine, and biomedical data science warns of a global shortage of GPU processors and the need for low-power alternatives to democratize access to AI technologies. Peter Norvig: The distinguished education fellow at Stanford HAI predicts the rise of agents that can connect to other services and do things for users, as well as the steps towards multimedia understanding with video data. Fei-Fei Li: The co-director of Stanford HAI and professor of computer science highlights the progress and importance of AI policy in the U.S. and the need for #Congress to act and invest in the public sector. Ge Wang: The Stanford HAI senior fellow and associate professor in the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA Stanford University) hopes for more critical questions and guidelines about what we want from AI in our lives, communities, and society4. https://lnkd.in/gd6DH9vx Well it sure is going to be a #happynewyear2024\n\nWorking at MSFT gives us the priviledged opportunity to listen to the greatest scientific minds sharing their vision about how technology will impact the society. Chris Bishop (Microsoft Technical Fellow, Director of Microsoft Research AI4Science, Honorary Professor of Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh) shared today a glimpse of how AI & Deep Learning are transforming the world of the scientific discovery. We can only learn from data in the presence of assumptions, or prior knowledge, an inductive bias in the context of Machine Learning. And there is a trade-off between data and inductive bias. On one side, LLM leverages huge amount of data meaning lightweight inductive bias (assumptions encoded into the learning model), while on the other side, many scientific AI models have powerful inductive biases arising from 100 years of scientific discovery (physical laws) but not a lot of data. So, recent approaches emerge that use strong inductive biases in combination with AI techniques to speed up the discovery of new interesting molecules... eg for replacing the scarce lithium ion based batteries with widely available sodium based batteries ! Think of it as function emulators, which accelerate the screening and discovery of good candidates by 3 orders of magnitude. From years down to hours of computation ! And on top of the funnel of the scientific discovery process, other AI techniques to generate new candidates molecules with specific desired properties... AI is revolutionizing the world we live in at an accelerated pace ! #AI #deeplearning #science\n\nIn an interview with Dartmouth Engineering, OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati provided insights into the capabilities of the upcoming #GPT-5 model. She described the progression from GPT-4 to GPT-5 as akin to advancing from high school to university-level intelligence. Murati explained that GPT-3 had the intelligence of a toddler, while GPT-4 is comparable to a smart high school student. GPT-5, expected to be released in about a year and a half (late #2025 or early #2026), is anticipated to reach Ph.D.-level intelligence in specific tasks. This timeline clarification came after initial rumors suggested GPT-5 might be released in late 2023 or the summer of 2024. The recent release of GPT-4o, although impressive, did not represent the significant leap in intelligence that GPT-5 promises. Microsoft's CTO Kevin Scott has also claimed that next-gen AI systems will be capable of passing Ph.D. exams due to improved memory and reasoning capabilities. However, Murati noted that this \"Ph.D.-level\" intelligence will only apply to certain tasks, acknowledging that while these systems are already at human-level intelligence for specific tasks, they still fall short in many other areas.

He outlined his vision for GPT-5 and artificial general intelligence. He also noted that GPT-4 is the worst model we will ever use, as each subsequent version will be smarter. üåç Microsoft signed the largest corporate renewable energy purchase deal in history to power its AI technologies. üìä New research from Scale AI revealed a significant level of overfitting in some LLMs using the new GSM1k dataset. This raises questions about the accuracy of existing leaderboards and model evaluation methodologies. üé• An OpenAI employee demonstrated the new capabilities of Sora. This model can replicate the overall style of a video and change key elements, including characters. üíä Researchers from Eli Lilly believe that artificial intelligence will soon be able to independently develop new drugs, and model \"hallucinations\" may play a key role in this process. üéµ Thanks to AI, country singer Randy Travis is regaining his voice. After suffering a stroke in 2013, Randy had difficulties singing and speaking, but he recently released a new song as part of Warner AI's music experiment.
