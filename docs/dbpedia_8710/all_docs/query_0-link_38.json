        "text": "With each passing weekday, the arched browed and acerbic tongued Bhoomi of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi clan is enjoying more and more popularity. And basking in it's glory is TV actor Resshmi Ghosh.\n\nPrashant Golecha meets up with this ex-Miss India who made a noteworthy place for herself in this already cluttered industry of talented young blood.\n\n\"Eight months back Ekta told me, 'there's no character like Bhoomi on TV'\"\n\nOf all the tyros in television, you have quite some experience in the craft of acting?\n\nYes, I am in this field since last eight years. I have done theatre, Bengali films (Amar Mayer Shapat) and have worked with seasoned people like Aparna Sen and Rituparna Ghosh. After bagging the prestigious title of Miss India in 2002, for took up seven to eight films but unfortunately none of them made way to the theaters. Meanwhile I tried my hands with ramp shows and commercials. Offers from television did pour in but I was under the impression that the scenario would be hectic and that their scripts are given only on the sets. But when I finally decided to venture on the small screen, Balaji was the only production house that came to my mind.\n\nSo was Kyunki... the first project you were penciled in for?\n\nNo actually I was first selected for Karam Apnaa Apnaa. But then at the same time the leap in Kyunki was being finalized and that how I was weaved in that show.\n\nWere you then aware of Kyunki's popularity?\n\nAs I was clued about shows on TV since I was aware. In fact, I was in school when Kyunki... was launched. My first reaction when I bagged the role in this soap was that I would be lost in the crowd. Ekta had designed Bhoomi and I remember she telling me eight months back, 'there's no character like Bhoomi on TV'. It seemed like a challenge and I knew I have to give my best.\n\n\"My fans tell me that I am well pitched against Tulsi and in some scenes I even stand out!\"\n\nYou debuted on TV with a negative act. Didn't you fear this gamble of being typecast?\n\nI was little apprehensive in the beginning as for theatre and films, I've essayed only leading positive roles. But once I started shooting for Kyunki...., I fell in love with my character. Bhoomi is very human and has shades of grey. But there's a logic behind all her vicious moves. She is very emotional and humane but can be stupid too at times. I am quite happy with the way my character has shaped and with the kind of response I have got. I am thankful to Ekta for such a wonderful character and I am not saying this just because I am working for a Balaji show.\n\nWhat's the kind of feedback you have received?\n\nI get a lot of fan calls and everyone adores my character. When people spot me at a public place they approach me and tell me that I look very different off-screen. Amusingly, I smile a lot in real life and that surprises people as Bhoomi doesn't. Also a lot of my fans have told me I am well pitched against Tulsi and in some scenes I even stand out!\n\nHow is it working with Smriti Irani?\n\nSmriti is a very good actress. She knows her job very well. I am obliged to work with her. It is easy for me to match her excellent acting skills because I am an experienced actress and have worked with veterans like Om Puri and Amrish Puri.\n\nAnd what about the atmosphere on the sets?\n\nWe work in unity. In fact if there's no shooting I miss it. Kyunki..is like my second family.\n\n\"I got engaged to actor Amit Gupta three years ago\""
