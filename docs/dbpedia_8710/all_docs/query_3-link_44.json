        "text": "Tannishtha Chatterjee, the highly acclaimed Indian actress has become a household name today courtesy her frank speak against Colors Comedy Nights Bachao Tazaa. The lady went on the show to promote her film, Parched but walked out mid-way after being subjected to offensive jokes on her skin tone. The lady apparently bore the the first half of the tirade continuously but could not control herself when the jokes were never-ending. The actress said that she was never so humiliated anywhere in the world. This incident draws focus on a number of topics. Right from the racist attitude of Indian society to where comedians need to draw the line.\n\nBollywoodLife spoke to Reshmi Ghosh, who is one of the well known dusky beauties of TV town. She opined, \"Well, skin tone is a huge issue in the country. Fair people are put on a pedestal. When someone says a girl is fair, she is automatically assumed to be beautiful. Growing up, I too considered myself as a ugly duckling because of my dusky skin tone. In fact, I realised that the preoccupation with my skin colour was maximum in our own country. In abroad, I never felt differentiated against.\"\n\nWhen we asked her if the entertainment industry was racist in India, she said, \"See, if I was rejected for my skin tone no one ever told that to me on my face. However, I have been working here since 18 years and have never felt humiliated. I personally know the people behind Comedy Nights Bachao Tazaa and they do not have such an outlook in real life. Yes, I feel people do need to be a little circumspect about such things. The creative team of comedy shows should take responsibility. It is high time we stopped finding humour in such things. It is not only an issue of creative aesthetics but also of the fact that somewhere it makes life difficult for dusky girls across India.\"\n\nReshmi also says that the glamour industry is more receptive of dusky women. \"I have done a lot of modelling and no one ever told me that my skin tone was a hindrance. They say jewellery stands out much better in a dusky woman. I believe in having good healthy skin but colour has never been of importance to me. One day, I heard how girls spoke of getting injections to look fairer. It is ridiculous.\"\n\nTalking about Tannishtha, she says it is extremely unfortunate what happened. \"However, one has to agree that 90 per cent of India pokes fun at a dark-skinned girls. It is sad but true. This incident is a reminder that thoughts are changing in modern India and we need to outgrow certain things.\"\n\nStay tuned to BollywoodLife for the latest scoops and updates from Bollywood, Hollywood, South, TV and Web-Series."
