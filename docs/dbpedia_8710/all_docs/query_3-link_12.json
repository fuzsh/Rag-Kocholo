The actress who is lucky to be working with Entertainment Hub’s production team who adjust to give her enough time for her movie schedule, will be seen in a Bengali and a Hindi movie by the end of this year. Here she talks about her movie experience. “My Bengali movie Aborto is up for release post Durga Puja sometime in September or October this year. However before that, my film From Sydney With Love releases on 3 August. I have a small role in the film,” says Reshmi. Talking about her role in the film, she avers, “I simply took up this movie as I wanted a break from shows. Apart from that, I was getting to go to Sydney. Hence, though it’s a very small role of just the lead’s sister, I still took it up. The movie was more like a vacation time for me.” Furthermore, she gives complete credit of this role to the lead of the movie, “Bidita Bag, who plays the lead on this, has been a big fan of me. Hence, when she was offered this movie, she impressed upon the production house to rope me,” she relates. Indeed the actress is glad that she took up this role as she continues, “The production team was so professional that I didn’t have to waste a single minute. In fact, I got enough time to shop and party. If you look at me in the movie, you will see that I have put on weight as I was busy eating. I tasted almost everything there except for Octopus meat.” This is not all that the actress did in Sydney. “I also met some old school friends there with whom I partied a lot. So on the whole, it was a fun-filled vacation for me in Australia,” she concludes.\n\nLike\n\n0\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nHaha\n\n0\n\nYay\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nSubscribe Here"
