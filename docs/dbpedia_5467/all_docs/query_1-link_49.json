        "text": "Not all smartphone cameras are created equal - a very good article on cameras offerrd in mobiles\n\nNEW DELHI: A good camera in a smartphone is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, draw for most of the consumers. Smartphones companies have realized this and have started talking about the cameras in their phones to woo buyers.\n\nBut in the race to produce the perfect smartphone camera, different companies are taking a different approach. This means for consumers it is not possible to compare cameras in various phones on the basis of their specifications. The pixels that Lumia 1020 captures are different from those captured by Galaxy S4. Similarly, the pixels that iPhone 5S captures are different from those captured by HTC One.\n\nCommon factors\n\nOther than working on different image sensor technologies, smartphone makers are also improving the design of lens in their cameras. Nokia, for example, started trend of optical image stabilization with Lumia 920 camera. Now the optical image stabilization can also be found in HTC One, Lumia 925, Lumia 1020 and LG G2. In theory, optical image stabilization should result in sharper images and videos. Similarly, companies are introducing lenses with wider openings. For example, the HTC One and Xperia Z1 lenses have an aperture of F2.0. The iPhone 5S camera has an aperture of F2.2. Theoretically lower aperture means better images in low-light conditions.\n\nWhat is best for you\n\nAs we noted earlier, all approaches are theoretically good. But what matters is how well they have been implemented. For now, there is no clear winner, though PureView technology with oversampling offers best results, mostly due to the way Nokia has implemented it. But that said, camera in iPhone 5S, Galaxy S4 and Xperia Z1 are also very good and not too behind the camera in Lumia 1020 when it comes to producing quality pictures and videos.\n\nread full here -\n\nNot all smartphone cameras are created equal - Times Of India\n\nHTC One remains Number One in Techradar's Buyer Guide ahead of the Xperia Z1, LG G2 and iPhone 5s\n\nTechradar: 20 best mobile phones in the world today (October 2nd)\n\nHTC One\n\nDon't fear HTC fans - your darling is still number one. As our only five star phone, its combination of impressive UI and stunning aluminium build means it was always safe in the number one\n\nIt's nothing to do with the quality of the S4 or the LG G2 – outstanding phones in anyone's book – but more the fact HTC has managed to bring out a smartphone that's worthy of any user's consideration.\n\nThe supreme aluminium chassis, the Full HD screen and the simplified version of Sense 5.0 sitting on top of Android Jelly Bean means it's a pleasure to use and recommend this handset.\n\nThe new innovations are also pleasingly more than just marketing gimmicks; Zoe functionality allows the creation of delightful video highlight reels, and the Ultrapixel camera means you've got a much wider range of shots available thanks to being stunning in low light.\n\nSamsung launches smartphone with curved display screen\n\nSamsung Electronics, the world's best-selling smartphone maker, has launched a handset with a curved display screen.\n\nCalled the Galaxy Round, the smartphone will feature a 5.7in (14.5cm) display.\n\nThe launch comes just days after rival LG said it would begin production of curved-screen phones next year.\n\nDigital display technology has been progressing towards curved screens. Both Samsung and LG already offer curved organic light-emitting diode (OLED) television sets.\n\nSamsung said the curved screen display would help consumers use some of the features on the phone, including those that enable users to check information such as date, time and missed calls when home screen is off, with more ease.\n\nThese phones may not be a game-changer today, but they are definitely an indication of things to come”Manoj Menon, Frost & Sullivan.\n\nAt the same time, users can also change music tracks on their phone, even while its display is off.\n\nThe Galaxy Round will initially be launched only in South Korea. The firm gave no indication of its plans for a global launch.\n\n'Internet of Things'\n\nThe global smartphone market has been growing rapidly.\n\nAccording to research firm CCS Insight, worldwide smartphone sales will hit nearly one billion in 2013 - accounting for more than half the total of 1.7 billion mobile phones sold.\n\nAs as result, smartphone manufacturers have been keen to offer new products to win consumers.\n\nWith display technology moving towards flexible and bendy screens, it is one area that companies have been looking at.\n\nSome analysts said that while the initial offering of curved-screen phones may not see huge sales, the segment of flexible displays was one to keep an eye on.\n\n\"These phones may not be a game-changer today, but they are definitely an indication of things to come,\" Manoj Menon, managing director of consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, told the BBC.\n\n\"Flexible displays have a huge role to play as the market place for 'internet of things' grows.\"\n\nThis refers to the idea that many things in homes or offices - not just typical computers - will soon be connected to the internet.\n\nThe sector is tipped by many to be a major industry in the near future.\n\nMr Menon said that as flexible screens became more advanced and cost-effective to make, it was likely to speed up growth in the sector.\n\nBBC News - Samsung launches smartphone with curved display screen\n\nLenovo looking to acquire HTC, talks have been going on since August\n\nLenovo might be negotiating a huge acquisition, that of HTC. Struggling Taiwanese phone maker HTC has posted its first quarterly loss as it loses grip on the market, and frankly there couldn’t be a better time for such a deal. Keep in mind that this is only a rumor, based on alleged meetings between top level Lenovo and HTC executives that have taken place in Taiwan in August. There is no final decision yet, and it could take a few months until the deal passes (if it does) in the first half of 2014.\n\nLenovo is allegedly discussing taking over the HTC brand, much like it did with IBM’s ThinkPad laptops when it acquired the unit. This means that we’ll still have HTC smartphones, just this time - manufactured under Lenovo’s caring wings. Other terms of the detail have not been disclosed.\n\nThe deal sounds like a very right fit. Lenovo is one of the largest phone makers in China, but does not reach Western markets in the way HTC does, nor does it have the carrier connections. Lenovo is now also the largest PC and notebook seller globally, having surpassed HP, so the business for the Chinese company is growing fast.\n\niPhone 5C, iPhone 5S to go on sale in India on Nov 1\n\nNEW DELHI: Apple will start selling iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C from November 1 in India. The launch is part of the company next phase of iPhone launches worldwide. On October 25, the two models of iPhone will become available in 25 countries.\n\nHowever, India is part of the list of another 12 countries that will get the devices on November 1.\n\nFor now Apple has not revealed India-specific prices of iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C. But in the US the devices cost $649 and $549, respectively, in their 16GB variant.\n\nWhile iPhone 5S is a flagship phone with an all-aluminum body and features like TouchID, iPhone 5C uses plastic body and is similar to the existing iPhone 5 in terms of its core hardware.\n\nThe India price of iPhone 5C is expected to be around Rs 40,000 while the price of iPhone 5S could be slightly above Rs 50,000.\n\nOn Wednesday Apple said that every customer who buys an iPhone 5S or iPhone 5C at an Apple retail store will be offered free personal setup service, helping them customize their iPhone by setting up email, showing them new apps from the app store and more, so they'll be up and running with their new iPhone before they leave the store.\n\nHowever, Apple doesn't operate any retail store here and it is not clear if this service will be offered by its authorized distributors in India.\n\niPhone 5C, iPhone 5S to go on sale in India on Nov 1 - The Times of India\n\nBinatone launches tablet PC for kids priced at Rs 9,999\n\nNEW DELHI: Electronics company Binatone has launched its first android-based tablet PC, App Star, designed for kids above 4 years, priced at Rs 9,999.\n\n\"This 'APP STAR' is packed full of software suitable for children of 4 years and above. It has preloaded fun games, educational apps, art studios, e-books, audio-books, music player and camera with video recorder,\" Binatone Country Head S P Singh said in a statement.\n\nThe company has already launched this tablet for kids in UK and other European markets. It has a 7-inch capacitative touch screen and comes with a special cover that protects it from physical damage when dropped from table height.\n\nThe tablet has Wi-Fi connectivity option and a battery back of up of 4 hours.\n\nThe tablet can be operated in two modes - 'APP STAR' mode for kids and 'parent' mode which is the normal Android screen mode. The two can easily be switched through the parental control.\n\n\"The App Star has secured password protected parental control built-in to the software to ensure time control and firewalled Internet browsing for kids,\" Singh said.\n\nThe company also plans to create full ecosystem for kids' tablets with Fun Karaoke, Speaker dock, Racing Car, Helicopter and accessory pack during the X-mas time, the statement said.\n\nBinatone launches tablet PC for kids priced at Rs 9,999 - The Economic Times\n\nIt's like HTC is taunting us with the One Max.\n\nThe One Max is the company's latest product and a super-sized addition to HTC's aluminum-clad smartphone family.\n\nBeyond the 5.9-inch display and fingerprint sensor, the biggest difference in the One Max is the removable back. Somehow, the company was able to keep the all-metal body but allow users to pry off the back, allowing for the addition of a micro-SD card for expanded memory.\n\nWhen removing the back cover, there's a rectangular area in the back that actually looks like a battery -- even though it isn't. An HTC representative told CNET that the unique architecture of the device -- in which the battery is right behind the display and then the processor and other components are right behind the battery -- make it impossible for the battery to be replaceable. The One Max rocks a large 3,300 mAh battery, which HTC said should be hefty enough to get through a workday.\n\nHTC opted to stick with the same design architecture of the HTC One, preserving the aesthetic appeal of its original flagship phone, the representative said. He added that the option for expandable memory via a micro-SD card slot was a higher priority than a removable battery.\n\nPerhaps HTC will get it right with the next flagship phone. Rivals such as Samsung and LG must certainly be looking at the One Max's removable metal cover as a design cue as for future high-end phones.\n\nHTC One Max joins the phablet fray | CNET TV | Video Product Reviews, CNET Podcasts, Tech Shows, Live CNET Video"
