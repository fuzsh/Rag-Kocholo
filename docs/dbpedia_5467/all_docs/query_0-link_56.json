        "text": "Lenovo has launched Vibe K5 smartphone in India at a price of Rs 6,999. The phone is a successor to the A6000. The Vibe K5 will be sold through a flash sale at 2PM on June 22. The registration for the sale will start today at 1PM exclusively on Amazon.in.\n\nThe Lenovo Vibe K5 comes with 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 415 octa-core processor and 2GB DDR3 RAM. The phone packs in 16GB of internal storage, which is expandable up to 32GB via microSD card.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Vibe K5 has 5-inch screen with resolution of 720 X 1280 pixels. On the back, the Vibe K5 carries a 13-megapixel camera with LED flash. And on the front, it has a 5-megapixel camera. The phone is powered by a 2,750mAh battery.\n\nThe dualSIM phone runs Android 5.1 Lollipop-based Vibe UI and supports 4G LTE connectivity and Dolby audio technology. The phone will be available in gold, silver and grey colours.\n\nLenovo has been quite prolific in launching new phones in India in the last few months. Last month it came out with Zuk Z1.\n\nAlso read: Lenovo Zuk Z1 review: Big battery makes it a winner\n\nLenovo-owned Motorola also launched a couple of new phones recently. It launched Moto G4 Plus last month, and then earlier this week the company launched Moto Z and Moto Z Force at its Tech World event.\n\nAlso read: Motorola Moto G4 Plus review: Two steps forward, one step back\n\nBoth the Moto Z and Moto Z Force are high-end phones and also mark a beginning of a new Moto line-up. This also puts an end to Motorola's high-end Moto X phones.\n\nLenovo also announced its latest phablet Phab 2 Pro, which has been developed in partnership with Google. The USP of the phablet is its capabilities to generate augmented reality experience. The Phab 2 Pro will be globally launched later this year."
