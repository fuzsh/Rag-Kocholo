Whether you want a tablet for everyday use, completing work tasks, playing games or unleashing your creative impulses, there’s a Samsung tablet for you. But how do you pick which one?\n\nThere’s a lot to choose from when it comes to deciding which tablet model to buy. In this guide, we’ve outlined what features to look for in the newest Samsung tablet.\n\nHow do I decide what tablet to buy?\n\nChoosing the right tablet for you depends very much on what you’re going to use it for. Key things to consider when deciding which tablet to buy are screen size, storage space, battery life and connectivity, as these factors will be affected by what you want to use it for. We have listed all the key components and features to look for when comparing different tablet models to help you decide the best tablet for you.\n\nWhat is the best tablet for everyday use?\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a tablet for simple, everyday tasks the Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 is the best tablet for you.

Whether you’re catching up on a show on route to the office, or in bed with a cup of coffee, you’ll want a tablet that feels like a QLED TV in your backpack. A large tablet screen is obviously an essential feature for watching TV shows and films, so opt for a model with a display that’s above 11 inches. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9+ has an impressive 12.4 inch screen, while the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra’s extra large 14.6 inch screen offers a truly immersive, cinematic viewing experience - perfect for watching content on the go. Their Dynamic AMOLED 2X displays will also bring each action scene to life with vibrant colours and the deepest blacks.\n\n*MicroSD card sold separately\n\nWhat is the best tablet for drawing?\n\nSamsung tablets are made with creatives in mind. The Galaxy Tab S9+ and Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra’s large screens allow you to see your digital art in perfect detail. All Galaxy Tab S9 tablets come with Clip Studio Paint pre-installed, so you can start creating sketches and graphic masterpieces from the get go. You can even use your Samsung smartphone* as the artist palette while using your entire Tab S9 screen as your canvas. Plus, with the S Pen included as standard, you’ll have more versatility to write, draw and paint with a stylus that follows every precise move.\n\n*Selected Galaxy smartphones only.\n\nWhat is the best tablet for gaming?\n\nSimilar to the best tablets for artists, when it comes to choosing the best tablet for gaming there are essential features to look out for.
