        "text": "Hot new releases from IFA 2013 gadget show\n\nMatt Clinch | CNBC\n\nNearly 1,400 of the world's leading technology companies have descended on the International Congress Center in Berlin for the 2013 IFA (Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin) Trade Fair.\n\nThe annual show is a chance for leading consumer electronics and home appliances firms to show off their latest wares. But there's also a chance for new kids on the block to try to bring novel gadgets and ideas to the market. The main focus is on digital products, from ultrahigh definition displays to smart televisions, tablet computers, smartphones and networked home appliances.\n\nWith 80 different rooms and space for nearly 10,000 people, the show could be described as gadget heaven—even if it does require some heavy walking!\n\nSamsung has made the biggest noise at the show so far, with the release of its Galaxy Gear smartwatch, marking the first entry by a major tech company into wearable technology.\n\n(Read More: Samsung takes shaky first step into wearable future)\n\nHowever, there's much more on display at the show. CNBC highlights the major products that are drawing the crowds at this year's event.\n\n—By CNBC's Matt Clinch\n\nPosted 2 Sept. 2013\n\nSamsung Galaxy Gear\n\nSean Gallup | Getty Images\n\nAfter months of anticipation, Samsung introduced Galaxy Gear at IFA.\n\nThe smartwatch is connected to a Galaxy user's smartphone and shows a user's updates, like email or texts, on the screen. It also has built-in sensors that can track a user's physical activity. It can make and receive calls, take pictures and run its own apps, and it has a voice control function that allows users to perform tasks by speaking to the device.\n\n(Poll: Would you buy the Samsung smartwatch?)\n\nBut Macquarie analyst Daniel Kim said the device was an \"expensive accessory\" with a limited target market given its $299 price tag.\n\n(Read more: Why Galaxy Gear is no 'game changer' for Samsung)\n\nLenovo VIBE X\n\nMatt Clinch | CNBC\n\nWith a super-sleek body, the Vibe is now the Chinese firm's flagship smartphone. Packed with the Android 4.2 Jelly Bean operating system, it weighs just 121 grams and has a depth of 6.9 millimeters.\n\nDespite the phone's dainty appearance, Lenovo said it will have a 1.5-gigahertz quadcore processor and a 5-inch full-high definition screen.\n\nKeen to buy? A China release is scheduled for November, but there's no price yet. And European and U.S. fans will have to wait a little longer to get their hands on the device.\n\nQualcomm Toq\n\nDavid Maung | Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nBest known for making processing chips, Qualcomm branched out by launching a smartwatch at IFA.\n\nLike the Galaxy Gear, the Qualcomm Toq works in conjunction with a user's smartphone to display alerts. For now it only can be used only with Android devices, but Qualcomm may extend the connectivity to work with Apple's iOS.\n\nAvailable for pre-order immediately, the Toq is priced at $300 and is scheduled to hit stores Oct. 10.\n\nDaniel Matte, a technology analyst at Canalys, contrasted the Toq with the Galaxy Gear.\n\n\"Its claims of four- to five-day battery life are quite credible, and it does interact with a much larger base of Android devices. While the device is more focused than the Gear, it is much simpler in functionality,\" he told CNBC.\n\nMatte added that the Toq was \"largely a marketing exercise\" to sell Qualcomm's Mirasol display technology to smartwatch vendors.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note 3\n\nMatt Clinch | CNBC\n\nIf you think \"phablets\" are fab, then Samsung might just have the product for you: the Galaxy Note 3.\n\nWith a 5.7-inch screen, the cross between a phone and a tablet may prove a little tricky to fit into your pocket, but its multiwindow display allows users to easily complete different tasks.\n\nThough the Note 3 is larger than previous models, Samsung says it is also lighter, slimmer, faster and longer-lasting. It is due for release Sept. 25.\n\nThe Korean tech giant told a packed audience in Berlin that the phablet was the perfect accompaniment to its Galaxy Gear smartwatch. No price has been confirmed yet, but buying the pair together is expected to cost about $1,000. Better start saving those pennies.\n\n(Read more: Samsung's smartwatch is here)\n\nSony Xperia Z1\n\nMatt Clinch | CNBC\n\nPerhaps in an attempt to upstage its Korean rival, Sony held its press event two hours ahead of Samsung's Galaxy launch. After a glitzy entrance, Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai spoke of the \"rapid change\" the company had made before unveiling its flagship smartphone, the Sony Xperia Z1.\n\nThe waterproof device features a 20.7-megapixel, rear-facing camera with a 5-inch display.\n\n\"It's a challenging market, but we have a winning product,\" Hirai said. \"[What] we've packed into Xperia Z1 is something that's really going to wow customers around the world.\"\n\n(Read more: Sony CEO: TV business is 'certainly not for sale')\n\nPanasonic L65WT600\n\nMatt Clinch | CNBC\n\nVery much a buzz term at IFA 2013, \"4K\" resolution allows for ultrahigh definition television and cinema with four times as many pixels as normal high definition.\n\nPanasonic revealed its first foray into 4K at the show: a television with a whopping 65-inch screen and a price tag to match, at $5,999.\n\nThe 65WT600 is the first TV to comply with the HDMI 2.0 interface. Panasonic hopes that like other audio-visual equipment before it, such as Scart cables and the original HDMI, this television will become the industry standard.\n\nThe release is scheduled for October.\n\nSamsung Note 10.1 2014 Edition\n\nMatt Clinch | CNBC\n\nNot satisfied with a smartwatch and a phablet, Samsung added a 2014 edition of its Galaxy Note 10.1 to its arsenal at IFA.\n\nThe upgraded tablet is slimmer than its predecessor and is ready to take on the likes of the Apple iPad. It can be classed as a big brother to the Galaxy Note 3.\n\nThe Note 10.1 features multiwindow, Android Jelly Bean 4.3 and the brand's trademark S Pen, which is now smaller and stored horizontally. The new tablet is available in Europe on Sept. 25, with a global rollout expected next month.\n\nThe price hasn't been confirmed.\n\nLG G Pad 8.3\n\nMatt Clinch | CNBC\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, LG is back with a tablet whose 8.3-inch screen means it's in the iPad's league. LG says it's the only 8-inch device of its kind to feature a full high-definition display. It will retail at $499.\n\nThe company also gave its new Android smartphone its first European outing at IFA. The LG G2 has just one button (a volume control on the back), and LG says it's the ideal companion to the G Pad 8.3.\n\nBoth the tablet and the smartphone will be available worldwide in the fourth quarter. The pair will be available before Christmas in a bundle, if you're feeling generous.\n\nAmazon Kindle Paperwhite - 6th Edition\n\nMatt Clinch | CNBC\n\nDespite a flood of research showing that growth in e-reader take-up might have reached its peak, Amazon has once again added to its family of Kindles.\n\nThe sixth edition of the Paperwhite was released at the IFA and Amazon said the new device has improved back-lighting, higher contrast and several improved software features.\n\nNow available from the online store, it's priced at £109 ($170) for the Wi-Fi version and £169 ($264) for the 3G version.\n\n\"No one is investing on behalf of readers or pushing the boundaries of hardware, software and content for readers like this team,\" CEO Jeff Bezos said in a press release.\n\nBut Amazon has got competition. Its rival Kobo showed off the new Aura 6-inch e-reader at the same event along, with three Google-certified Kobo tablets.\n\nPioneer NavGate Head-Up Display\n\nMatt Clinch | CNBC\n\nHas driving just turned into a computer game? Much more than a sat nav, this device from Pioneer uses augmented reality to create what looks to the driver like a 30-inch display, sitting about 3 meters in front of the vehicle.\n\nPriced at £600 ($938), it's set to go on sale in October. Hooking up to a smartphone with the navigation software, the driver can look into a sun visor which then projects traffic, navigation and other information in full color through the windscreen.\n\nNever take your eyes off the road again.\n\nLG 77-Inch ULTRA HD CURVED OLED TV\n\nLG"
