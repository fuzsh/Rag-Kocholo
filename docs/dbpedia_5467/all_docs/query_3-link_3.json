        "text": "The best big phones curated by us for this list will hopefully satisfy any user who is prioritizing size for their next purchase. Many of these phones can be found on our best phones guide too, but this is the place to be if you need a big-screened, big-batteried smartphone guaranteed.\n\nAlongside their more expansive displays and improved longevity on a charge, the best big phones pack more elaborate cameras, with a greater quantity of lenses and the best optics and sensors on the market. Rest assured, we've tested them all.\n\nWe're still waiting on some of the big phones guides' biggest possible contenders of 2024 to launch. Phones like the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. But more established super-sized devices like the Galaxy S24 Ultra and the OnePlus 12 aren't likely to be disturbed any time soon, if you're looking to upgrade sooner rather than later.\n\nIf you're ready to go big on your next phone, we've put together a list of some of our super-sized favorites. And should you want one of the best small phones instead, we've got you covered there, too.\n\nThe quick list\n\nBest big phone overall\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra deserves its status at the top of the big phones list. First off, with a 6.8-inch, 120Hz QHD OLED and impressive color and brightness levels, its display makes great use of the handset’s size. The rest of the phone’s excellent too, offering top-quality cameras, battery life, benchmark results and software update schedule. And that’s not to mention the new Galaxy AI features, or the included S Pen.\n\nSamsung has made the Galaxy S24 Ultra more expensive than last year, and the 5x telephoto does feel like a downgrade compared to Samsung’s old 10x camera. This is still the ultimate phone if you want to live large.\n\nRead our full Galaxy S24 Ultra review.\n\nBest big iPhone\n\nThe iPhone 15 Pro Max is one of the best big phones around, and without doubt the best big iPhone, which may be all you need to hear to convince it’s worth buying.\n\nThanks to a customizable Action button, a better chipset,a lighter design and an improved zoom camera, you will want for nothing with the iPhone 15 Pro Max. It’s a shame it’s so expensive though. And that the charging is a bit slow. This is forgivable to some degree though, considering how much you still get.\n\nRead our full iPhone 15 Pro Max review.\n\nBest big phone value\n\nOnePlus always offers a great value when it comes to flagship phones, which makes the OnePlus 12 the perfect option for wanting a top-quality display for less than the competition. As well as offering a 6.8-inch 2K OLED display with 120Hz, you also get one of the biggest batteries of any current smartphone, and other cutting-edge tech like a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, 80W or 100W wired charging (depending on the region), 50W wireless charging and RAM and storage to spare.\n\nThe cameras on the OnePlus 12 perform well thanks to their Hasselblad tuning, although we weren’t that impressed with what they capture in dark conditions. And OnePlus is currently steering away from AI features, which you could see as neglecting a key developing area of smartphone tech. There’s little in terms of actual complaints to make about this phone though, and it should suit a wide variety of users very well.\n\nRead our full OnePlus 12 review.\n\nBest big phone for cameras\n\nIt's not just the Pixel 8 Pro's display that's large - it's also got a big brain thanks to Google's latest AI trickery. Photo editing, productivity and call screening have all gotten smarter in the latest pro Pixel, and will continue to develop thanks to a very generous seven years of promised updates.\n\nGoogle's also put effort into improving the Pixel 8 Pro's cameras, offering more granular \"Pro\" controls for users who know what they're doing with their cameras. The new Super Actua display is very bright too, helping you read the display in strong sunlight and enjoy its vivid colors.\n\nThe two key issues with the Pixel 8 Pro are that its battery life, while much better than last year's Pixel 7 Pro, is still a little too short compared to rival phones. And similarly its Tensor G3 chip can't keep up when it comes to CPU and GPU performance, making this an underwhelming phone for gaming or other processor-intensive apps. But if you prioritize brains over brawn, the Pixel 8 Pro is still likely the right big phone for you.\n\nRead our full Pixel 8 Pro review.\n\nBest big foldable phone\n\nThe first-ever OnePlus foldable is an amazing first attempt, so if you need the biggest-possible screen in your pocket, we recommend the OnePlus Open.\n\nIt's the most expensive phone on this list, but it is at least cheaper than an equivalent foldable from a brand like Samsung. It's also got a surprisingly long battery life for its size, and speedy 67W charging. And on the software front, the Open Canvas system lets you open multiple windows more flexibly to suit whatever tasks you need to do at the same time.\n\nOur main complaints are that the night mode photos are lagging behind the quality of the Open's other shots. Plus OnePlus has once again forgotten to offer wireless charging. Thought you'll probably forget all about that once you open up the 7.8-inch main display and start enjoying your apps, photos and videos in all that space.\n\nRead our full OnePlus Open review.\n\nBest big iPhone value\n\nThe iPhone 15 Plus is here to let you get an iPhone that's the same size as the iPhone 15 Pro Max, but for $300 less.\n\nUnfortunately for this larger basic iPhone, it doesn't have a 120Hz display refresh rate, a telephoto camera, or particularly fast charging. These are all things that its Android-using rivals all have, meaning it's a hard sell in some ways.\n\nLucky for Apple, there's still plenty to like about the iPhone 15 Plus. Its main, 2x ultrawide and selfie photos are all very strong, its A16 Bionic chipset still outperforms anything excluding the iPhone 15 Pro, and it's surprisingly light for its size. Plus, with all the standard iPhone software and UI polish, including a new Dynamic Island on the display, it's still a joy to use.\n\nRead our full iPhone 15 Plus review.\n\nBest budget big phone\n\nSitting at the top of the Motorola Moto G series, but at the bottom of the price list for the phones on this page, the latest Moto G Stylus is a cost-effective way to get a big display on your new phone.\n\nThe spacious screen is especially useful here since, as the name suggests, the phone comes with a built-in stylus for all your doodling needs. With increased brightness and excellent color reproduction, stunning battery life and and decent photo capabilities, the Moto G Stylus covers most of your bases.\n\nWe say most because its underpowered chipset will make running demanding apps a little difficult, and its single year of guaranteed updates may mean you need to replace it sooner than the other options we've listed here. But that $400 start price may be all you needed to hear to know this is the big phone for you.\n\nRead our full Moto G Stylus 5G (2024) review.\n\nHow to choose the best big phone for you\n\nAndroid or iPhone? Android phones give you more choice in terms of price, size and innovative designs — many of them happen to be larger, too. However, iPhones offer speedier software updates, better games and apps and better security and privacy. See our iPhone vs Android face-off.\n\nUnlocked or carrier? Most shoppers in the U.S. buy new phones through their wireless carrier. But an unlocked phone gives you the freedom to buy the device without any sort of contract and then bring it to the provider you want to use.\n\nScreen size: For fans of big phones, 6 inches and up is a good place to start. The biggest phones are 6.5 to just under 7 inches. If you want something you can easily use with one hand, go with one of the best small phones with a screen under 6 inches.\n\nCameras: Don't pay attention to the megapixel count. Instead, look at camera face-offs between phones to see the photo quality and look for special features like Night Mode to get better quality in low light. Also see our best camera phone roundup.\n\nBattery life: Generally, phones with larger batteries (measured in mAh) offer the longest battery life, but that's not always the case. That's why we run our own custom battery tests, where phones repeatedly load webpages over a T-Mobile data connection while set to 150 nits of display brightness until they run out of juice.\n\nHow we test smartphones\n\nIn order for a smartphone to make our best phone list, it needs to excel on several tests that we run on every handset. We perform some of these tests in our labs and some in the real world.\n\nWhen it comes to performance, we rely on such synthetic benchmarks as Geekbench 5 and 3DMark to measure graphics performance. These tests allow us to compare performance across iPhones and Android devices. We also run a real-world video transcoding test on each phone using the Adobe Premiere Rush app and time the result. (We unfortunately have to skip this test on some phones due to app compatibility issues, but we attempt this benchmark with each device we get in to review.)\n\nTo measure the quality of a phone's display, we perform lab tests to determine the brightness of the panel (in nits), as well as how colorful each screen is (DCI-P3 color gamut). In these cases, higher numbers are better. We also measure color accuracy of each panel with a Delta-E rating, where lower numbers are better and score of 0 is perfect.\n\nOne of the most important tests we run is the Tom's Guide battery test. We run a web surfing test over 5G (or 4G if the phone doesn't have 5G support) at 150 nits of screen brightness until the battery gives out. In general, a phone that lasts 10 hours or more is good, and anything above 11 hours makes our list of the best phone battery life.\n\nLast but not least, we take the best phones out in the field to take photos outdoors, indoors and at night in low light to see how they perform versus their closest competitors. We take shots of landscapes, food, portraits and more, and also allow you to be the judge with side-by-side comparisons in our reviews."
