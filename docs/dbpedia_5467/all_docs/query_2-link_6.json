        "text": "Synopsis\n\nHighlight of the phone is its still camera – it is the only phone in this price segment to feature optical image stabilization.\n\nDon’t worry if you’re hearing about this brand for the first time. ZUK is actually a subsidiary of Lenovo and they develop smartphones independently. Their first smartphone, the Z1, was launched in China last year. Since the device was using CyanogenMod it could not be launched in India (Cyanogen had an exclusive agreement with YU in India). Now that the exclusive agreement between YU and Cyanogen is over, Lenovo has launched the Z1 in India.\n\nBeing ZUK’s flagship device, the Z1 sports a metal chassis with a curved back panel. We did not like the glossy finish on the rear panel as it attracted a lot of fingerprints and smudges. Up front is the 5.5-inch full HD display which impresses with wide viewing angles, good brightness level and slim bezels. Under the screen is the home button that doubles up as a fingerprint sensor – the sensor works great from any angle and managed to recognise a fingerprint 8 out of 10 times. At 175 grams, the phone is on the heavier side, but thanks to the slim design it does not feel that heavy to hold.\n\nHighlight of the phone is its still camera – it is the only phone in this price segment to feature optical image stabilization. The 13MP camera is capable of taking images with good details and natural colors and the OIS helps in keeping blurry images at bay.\n\nLow light images have visible noise and we also noticed purple fringing in the corners in some photos. Video recording was a disappointment – there is no 4k video support and the full HD videos suffered from random frame drops. Front 8MP camera is also impressive – it took superb images with good details in daylight as well as indoors.\n\nHardware includes a Snapdragon 801 processor, 3GB RAM, 64GB storage and a 4,100mAh battery. Some users might not like the older Snapdragon 801 processor, but in our opinion, it is a capable performer – we faced no issues playing games or full HD videos on the phone. There is no microSD slot for storage expansion, but for a majority of users 64GB is more than enough so we can overlook this issue. Battery life is superb – we were consistently able to get one and half days of battery life with normal use.\n\nIt runs CyanogenMod 12.1 based on Android 5.1. In true Cyanogen style, it lets users tweak almost everything on the phone - you can switch themes, change functions for the hardware buttons, add actions for short, long or double press of the home key, enable double tap to wake, enable on-screen buttons, change screen dpi and so on. The UI is zippy and we did not face any random app crashes too. The Marshmallow update for the Z1 is expected to arrive sometime in June itself. Z1 might have launched late in India, but for the price, it manages to stand neck and neck with existing competition.\n\nIt is the cheapest smartphone with 64GB internal storage and the cheapest with optical image stabilization. Overall, the Z1 proves to be one of the best phones in the sub Rs 15,000 price segment.
