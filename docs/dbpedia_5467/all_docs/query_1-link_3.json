        "text": "20 cool Android smartphones we reviewed recently\n\nJun 20, 2016, 11:32:51 AM IST\n\n1/21\n\n20 cool Android smartphones we reviewed recently\n\nText: TOI Tech\n\nIndia is set to overtake US as the world's second-largest smartphone market by next year. On an average, the market sees over a dozen new smartphones being launched every month. With over 100 mobile brands in the country, it goes without saying that it is difficult to keep a track.\n\nHere are 20 smartphones we reviewed recently.\n\n2/21\n\nOnePlus 3, Rs 27,999\n\nWith OnePlus 3, the company has finally done away with its ‘infamous’ invite system. The smartphone is one of the best Android handsets launched recently in the sub-Rs 30,000 segment.\n\nHowever, there might be some who may find the price tag of Rs 27,999 (for a OnePlus device) a tad steep.\n\n3/21\n\nLenovo ZUK Z1, Rs 13,499\n\nAt a price of Rs 13,499, the ZUK Z1 is a perfect budget smartphone. It's one of the very few smartphones about which you'll likely have very little to complain about.\n\nLenovo ZUK Z1 delivers on all fronts, and can be considered as a cheaper OnePlus One. However, the real challenge for prospective buyers will be deciding between the ZUK Z1 and the recently launched Moto G4 Plus.\n\n4/21\n\nYu Yunicorn, Rs 14,999\n\nYu Yunicorn is definitely the company's best smartphone until now. The smartphone feels great in hands and looks really good, specially the Gold colour variant. While the build is a plus point for the Yunicorn, the camera is something that failed to convince us.\n\nThe performance was largely seamless and the battery performed just fine and even better than some of the other smartphones in the same price bracket of Rs 14,999.\n\n5/21\n\nReliance LYF Earth 1, Rs 19,399\n\nAt a price of Rs 19,399, Reliance has got a champ on its hand with Reliance LYF Earth. Yes, the price could have been a little better. It would have been better if the fingerprint sensor was also available on the smartphone within this price.\n\nOne can pick this one if they are looking for mid-end 4G phone for entertainment and calling needs.\n\n6/21\n\nPanasonic Eluga Arc, Rs 12,490\n\nPanasonic Eluga Arc is certainly one of the best looking smartphones we've reviewed, standing out in a sea of bland looking budget devices.\n\nThe display has rich colour reproduction which makes watching movies and playing games a delight. Panasonic Eluga Arc’s user interface is nearly stock Android and comes with some handy customization features.\n\n7/21\n\nSony Xperia X, Rs 48,990\n\nSony receives a thumbs up for Xperia X in departments like the display, design as well as in features like fingerprint sensor, quick image capture and more. However, there could've been a lot more on the platter. Performance-wise, the handset is as good as the other popular flagships in the market.\n\n8/21\n\nNextbit Robin, Rs 19,999\n\nNextbit Robin looks amazing with its funky colours and a unique thin design. The 100GB free cloud storage is great too. But is it really worth Rs 19,999? That's the big question. Even though the performance was smooth during our testing, with just a small amount of glitches here and there.\n\n9/21\n\nLG G5, Rs 52,990\n\nConsidering that LG G5 is the company's first stab at modular smartphones, the phone doesn't appear to be a poor attempt at all.\n\nAs a flagship-class smartphone, the LG G5 packs in the best hardware in the market. And it shows in its performance. Thanks to a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset paired with 4GB of RAM, the G5 powered through daily tasks with absolutely no effort.\n\n10/21\n\nXiaomi Mi 5, Ts 24,999\n\nXiaomi Mi 5 is no doubt a good buy for the price of Rs 24,999. It offers good value for money. However, the smartphone faces some serious competition from Nexus 5X, Huawei Honor 7, Samsung Galaxy A8 along with phones from Motorola, Lenovo and others.\n\nIn the mid-premium range, just having a good product is not always enough. Consumers tend to prefer bigger brands with the belief that branded smartphones last longer.\n\n11/21\n\nMotorola G4 Plus, Rs 14,999\n\nAt Rs 14,999, the Moto G4 Plus is a value-for-money smartphone. The new Moto G4 Plus is an absolute delight. It is one of the best budget-friendly smartphones in the market you can get.\n\nThe design is somewhat good and new added features work exceptionally well. However, not everything is outstanding with the G4 Plus.\n\nMotorola has done away with a few useful features that were present in its predecessors, most important being water-resistance (which we absolutely adored).\n\n12/21\n\nMeizu M3 Note, Rs 9,999\n\nThe Meizu M3 Note really left us with a mixed bag of emotions. While the phone's design and battery life are all favourable, the overall performance and camera quality turned out to be disappointing. Even the fingerprint sensor was not very responsive. In a nutshell, we think that at Rs 9,999, Meizu could have made the M3 Note a bit better.\n\n13/21\n\nCreo Mark 1, Rs 19,999\n\nUseful software features and monthly updates are the primary USPs of the Creo Mark.\n\nIf Creo is pitching the smartphone based solely on that, the brand could still have differentiated itself with a low-cost smartphone. But at a price tag of Rs 19,999, the Creo Mark 1 is unconvincing. Nevertheless, it's a promising device.\n\n14/21\n\nMicromax Canvas 6 Pro, Rs 13,999\n\nMicromax Canvas 6 Pro is a worthy competitor in a market flooded with cheap yet capable Android handsets. Unlike other Micromax-branded handsets, the Canvas 6 Pro performs surprisingly well.\n\nThe device's battery backup and stock Android operating system are impressive too. However, the smartphone design and build quality are not earth-shattering and the camera quality is just average. At a price tag of Rs 13,999, the Canvas 6 Pro is a value for money device.\n\n15/21\n\nLG K7, Rs 9,500\n\nThe LG K7 is fighting for a spot in the budget segment, where there are already many good and value for money options available. The design of the K7 resembles that of a pebble, which lends it a premium look and feel. It also has LG's 2.5D Arc Glass, which gives its edges a slightly curved appearance. The phone's metallic frame further adds to the design.\n\n16/21\n\nLG K10, Rs 13,500\n\nThe LG K10 bears a price tag of Rs 13,500 which is a bit too much, especially considering what the competitors are offering in the budget segment. The device delivers decent performance and user experience is fairly consistent. However, features such as fingerprint sensor and USB OTG support are missing.\n\nThose looking for alternatives can consider buying the LeEco 1S, which is priced at Rs 10,999 and offers a full metal body, fingerprint sensor, 5.5-inch Full HD display, and 13MP rear camera.\n\n17/21\n\nXiaomi Redmi Note 3, Rs 9,999\n\nThe Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 stands out from the crowd in its own unique way. With a new design, features and price, it is among the best budget phablets available in India. For people who are looking forward to a 5.5-inch smartphone in the price range of between Rs 9,000 to Rs 13,000, this is a good choice.\n\n18/21\n\nSamsung Galaxy A7 (2016), Rs 32,500\n\nLaunched at Rs 32,500, the Galaxy A7 smartphone picks up a lot of characteristics from the Samsung’s 2015 flagship Galaxy S6 smartphone.\n\nWith Gorilla Glass 4 panel on both front and back, the smartphone certainly exudes a premium feel. With a beautiful design, sharp crisp display and a long lasting battery, the Galaxy A7 smartphone is a great catch. It is a good option for people looking for a promise of a reliable brand in this price segment.\n\n19/21\n\nInFocus Bingo 50, Rs 7,499\n\nFor the price of Rs 7,499, Infocus seems to have have ticked all the boxes with its new Bingo 50 smartphone. It is just an updated version with 4G and OnePlus One-like sandstone cover. While the camera, display and hardware prowess is something the company can really boast in the Bingo 50, the software could have been better.\n\n20/21\n\nHTC Desire 626, Rs 13,310\n\nThe HTC Desire 626 is priced at Rs 13,310 and offers pretty decent specifications. The smartphone features a 5-inch HD display and is powered by a 1.2GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor. It comes equipped with a 13MP rear camera and packs a 2,000 mAh battery. The only let down feature of the device is its software - the HTC Desire 626 runs on Android 4.4.4 KitKat operating system."
