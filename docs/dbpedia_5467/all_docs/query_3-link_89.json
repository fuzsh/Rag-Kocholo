        "text": "And with Feature Drops, Pixel phones are getting even more capabilities all the time. Here are several lesser-known Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro features that might be helpful.\n\n1 Capture fleeting moments with Motion Mode\n\nMemorable moments â a babyâs first steps, a hummingbird at the backyard feeder, or a winning goal â happen in a split second. With Motion Mode on Pixel 6, you can get your camera ready to shoot with a simple double-click on the power button. This works regardless of what screen your Pixel is on â and even when itâs locked.\n\n2 Quick Tap to Snap\n\nOnly on Pixel, Snapchat can be accessed directly from the lock screen. Simply tap the back of your phone and youâll be ready to capture a stunning shareable image.\n\n3 Get help in an emergency with the Personal Safety app\n\nOnce you give the Personal Safety app access to your location and microphone, car crash detection on your Pixel will detect motion and listen for sounds typical of a crash. If the phone believes thereâs been an accident, it will sound an alarm and prompt you to either say âEmergencyâ â to trigger a call to 911 â or tap âI am okay.â1 Pixel 6 also lets you store vital information such as blood type and allergies in the Personal Safety app, and allows a trusted emergency contact to access the phone without having to know the password (this data is also cordoned off in the phone, making it more secure from hacking).\n\n4 Real-time language translation with Live Translate\n\nWith a new feature called Live Translate, your Pixel can help you communicate in languages other than your own in real time, even when you donât have internet access.2 Just say, âHey Google, be my interpreter.â Live Translate will automatically display captions on videos, type out text and have the phone read it out in a different language, or give real-time translation when you point the camera at a sign.\n\nPixel 8a\n\nColorful. Powerful. AI-full.\n\n5\n\nFirst, ask Google to call the local business or organization youâre trying to reach. Then use the Wait Times feature to know how long your hold time will be, or use Direct My Call to help you navigate the phone tree to quickly get to the correct department. Pixel 6 users can also use the Hold for Me setting to let the phone do the holding. If youâre put on hold, Google Assistant can wait on the line for you and let you know when someone is ready to talk.\n\n6 Get the right sound for the right place with Adaptive Sound\n\nAs you change environments â say, from a quiet building lobby to a noisy street â a Pixel feature called Adaptive Sound assesses the acoustics near you, then adjusts the sound equalizer settings. And it works with Pixel Buds, too.\n\nSee what else your Pixel 6 can do"
