        "text": "From helping you photograph extraordinary moments to making it easier to catch up with friends, Pixel 7 features help you make and relive memories â like the last-minute touchdown or the picnic with friends, or even your babyâs first steps. Phone calls with old friends will be better than ever, with Clear Calling that tunes out background noise. Itâs all powered by the latest Google Tensor G2 chip, which helps Pixel 7 run machine learning models 60% faster and up to 20% more efficiently than Pixel 6.3\n\nOf course, your phone is only helpful if you trust that your data is safe. Pixel 7 meets the same rigorous protection guidelines trusted by banks, carriers, and governments because of the new Titan M2 chip inside. And Pixel 7 features will continue to keep your phone secure, with five years of guaranteed security updates.\n\nMore helpful, pro level, and safer\n\nHere are a few Pixel 7 features for better photos, clearer calls, and safer browsing:\n\n1 Improve the images in your photo collection (even the older ones from other phones)\n\nIt happens all the time â you get the perfect shot of your kid kicking the winning goal, or a friend at the bar, only to realize later that the photo is blurry. For any of your photos, new or old, just use Google Photos, and tap Photo Unblur toÂ remove blur in just a few taps.1 Photo Unblur uses Tensor G2âs machine learning capabilities to identify and remove blur and visual noise from your photos, creating clearer pictures of your favorite moments.3\n\n2 Get vivid closeups with Macro Focus\n\nWhat if you want to get close to your subjects? Like, really close. Macro Focus delivers Pixel HDR+ photo quality from as close as 3 centimeters away. And with Google Pixel's new ultrawide lens, you can get close enough to highlight raindrops on a flower petal, or the spots on a ladybug.Â\n\n3 Reach for the stars in expressive videos\n\nMore than ever, weâre capturing our lives on video. With Pixel 7, you can take brighter, smoother videos of your most memorable moments. Tensor G2 combines hardware and software to enable high-quality video stabilization. And Pixelâs new 10-bit HDR video lets you record with wider color ranges and higher contrast. On Pixel 7 Pro, you can take videos that look like the movies with Cinematic Blur, which allows you to shift focus between foreground and background.\n\nPixel 9 Pro and Pro XL\n\nAll pro. Pure magic.\n\n4 Better selfies for everyone\n\nFinding the perfect angle on a selfie is a never-ending quest for even the savviest of social media posters. Pixel 7 has Guided Frame, which guides you to the perfect image by talking you through it.\n\n5 Like the sound of all the calls you make\n\nBad reception and background noise can make it hard to hear the person on the other end of the line. Clear Calling makes your phone calls sound better, since it recognizes and eliminates distracting noise like wind and traffic, while enhancing the clarity of the conversation. When you call a business with an automated menu, Direct My Call helps you navigate its phone directory by speaking the options. With Pixel 7, you can see the phone tree right on your screen, then select the option you want using tappable buttons.\n\n6 Get into your phone faster\n\nItâs handy to see certain information from your lock screen, but when you want to get into your phone, it can take a moment to tap in your code. Now, your face can help. Pixel 7 comes with Face Unlock, which means your phone will recognize you when you look at it, opening up your phone automatically.\n\n7"
