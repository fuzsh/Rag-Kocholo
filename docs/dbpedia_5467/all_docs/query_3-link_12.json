        "text": "Smartphones\n\nA smartphone is a phone that can connect to the internet.\n\nThis means they can do a lot of the same things as a computer. In addition to normal phone calls and text messages, a smartphone can connect to mobile data so you can take it outside the house and use the internet. For example, you can use a smartphone to look up bus times while you wait at a bus stop.\n\nSmartphones are small and portable, and many blind and partially sighted people use them to:\n\nGet directions\n\nSend and receive emails\n\nTalk to family and friends by making audio and video calls\n\nTake photos and videos\n\nFind information on the internet\n\nUse social media\n\nMake payments\n\nListen to music, digital radio and podcasts\n\nDownload a wide range of useful programs and apps, such as online banking.\n\nThere are two main types of smartphones: Apple and Android. Apple smartphones are called iPhones. Android smartphones are made by lots of companies, including Samsung, Sony, LG, Huawei and HTC.\n\nSmartphones come in a range of sizes, described as a screen size. Screen size is measured diagonally from corner to corner, and ranges from 4 inches up to 7 inches.\n\nSmartphones use a touch screen, and only have a few buttons (such as the power and volume controls) on the side. To get the phone to do something, you tap or flick across the touch screen, rather than pressing a physical button.\n\nTablets\n\nA tablet is a small, portable computer. It can connect to your home internet (also called wireless or Wi-Fi). They use a touch screen, just like smartphones.\n\nWhilst they are similar in many ways, there are some differences between smartphones and tablets. Tablets have larger screens than smartphones. This can be helpful if you still have some sight but find it harder to see a smaller screen. Unlike smartphones, most tablets don’t have mobile data. This means that you can only connect to the internet at home or in public buildings where there is public Wi-Fi (such as the library), and not when you’re out and about.\n\nThere are two main types of tablets: Apple and Android. Apple tablets are called iPads and come in a range of options, such as the iPad Pro and iPad Air. Android tablets are made by lots of companies, including Amazon, Google and Samsung.\n\nGrants\n\nSmartphones are available to apply for through the RNIB Technology Grant Scheme. Other items include video magnifiers, RNIB PenFriend 3, kitchen equipment, clocks and watches, accessibility software and DAISY players. Click here for more information about grants.\n\nHow to make your smartphone or tablet easier to use\n\nThere are lots of ways to personalise your device so it’s easier to use and access content on your screen. Smartphones and tablets have a range of built-in accessibility features for larger, bolder text, magnification and speech. These settings aren’t usually turned on by default, and you may need some support to change them.\n\nAnother option is the built-in magnification settings. If this is switched on, some items (such as icons and text) may appear to be ‘off screen’. To find them again, you’ll need to move around your screen with finger gestures. These are explained below.\n\nHow to enable the Zoom feature on an iPad or iPhone:\n\nThe built-in magnification setting on an iPad or iPhone is called Zoom.\n\nGo to Settings\n\nTap on Zoom\n\nEnable Zoom (the top option)\n\nThis will magnify your whole screen. To move around the screen, drag with three fingers. To zoom, double tap with three fingers. To change zoom, double tap and drag with three fingers.\n\nHow to enable magnification on an Android device:\n\nGo to Settings\n\nTap on Accessibility\n\nTap on Visibility Enhancements\n\nTap on Magnification\n\nTap on Magnification Shortcut\n\nNow you can choose how you would like to enable the magnifier. There are four options. If you would like to use finger gestures, triple tap with one finger.\n\nGood to know: you can also enable magnification temporarily. To turn it on, triple tap the screen with one finger and hold. When you let go, your phone will go back to its normal settings.\n\nThere are some smartphones specifically with blind and partially sighted people in mind. At the time of writing (January 2024) the four most popular versions are:\n\nSynapptic phone\n\nBlindshell\n\nRealSAM Pocket\n\nSmartVision 3\n\nThe first three phones use a touch screen. The Synapptic is designed to be used by people who prefer larger text or who need speech or a combination of both. The Blindshell phone is designed for those who need speech only. RealSAM Pocket is designed to make reading the latest newspapers, magazines and books easier. SmartVision 3 is designed for users who prefer a numeric keypad to operate their smartphones instead of a touch screen.\n\nWhilst these phones are designed to be a little easier and simpler to use than standard smartphones, it is done so at the compromise of features. For example, all these phones make it very easy to make phone calls and send and receive standard text messages. RealSAM Pocket even has more features as it comes with a range of assistance features including video access to Be My Eyes volunteers, a magnifier, reminders, navigation assistance and an emergency support function. However, you might not get the full experience when using social media or browsing websites.\n\nYou will need to decide if the simplicity of making calls and texts is what you want, or if the other features such as video calls and music etc is more important. If this is the case, then maybe a mainstream smartphone is for you."
