Unveiled in August 2015, it is the first product by ZUK. In most markets outside China, the ZUK Z1 ships with the Cyanogen OS operating system pre-installed. Cyanogen OS is a commercial variant of CyanogenMod. The device was released with Cyanogen OS 12.1, based on Android 5.1 \"Lollipop\", and was never updated to Cyanogen OS 13, based on Android 6.0 \"Marshmallow\". In China, the ZUK Z1 ships with its own ZUI distribution, based on Android 5.1 \"Lollipop\".\n\nThe phone was first made available for sale on 25 September 2015 for US$300 (equivalent to $385.62 in 2023).[2]\n\nIn India the phone was launched at a price of Rs.13,999 on amazon. However the updates for this phone were limited and soon the company stopped giving updates.\n\nThis phone as earlier described had Cyanogen OS operating system but later the company Cyanogen OS was closed and it was replaced by Lineage OS.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nOnePlus One\n\nLenovo smartphones\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nZuk Official Archived 2016-10-18 at the Wayback Machine\n\nLemo International partner\n\nZuk Mobile Canada Archived 2016-03-04 at the Wayback Machine\n\nZuk Official Distributor Archived 2015-10-03 at the Wayback Machine"
