Team Win takes no responsibility for any damage that may occur from installing or using TWRP.\n\nStatus:\n\nSupport Status: Current\n\nMaintainer: juliusssssmiui\n\nCode Name: ham\n\nDevice Tree / files\n\nApp Install Method (Requires Root):\n\nDownload the Official TWRP App (root required):\n\nPlay Store (recommended)\n\nNo Play Store? Download the latest version here.\n\nInstall the app and open it. Agree to the Terms. Select TWRP Flash. Select your device from the device list (ham) and choose a version. The file will download to your Downloads folder. Browse to and select the file. Tap on Flash to Recovery. Find out more about the app here.\n\nDownload Links:\n\nCurrent and past versions of TWRP can be found at one of the mirrors below:\n\nPrimary (Americas)\n\nPrimary (Europe)\n\nTWRP Install (Requires TWRP 2.8.4 or higher already installed):\n\nDownload the latest TWRP image file (.img) from the download link and boot TWRP. Go to install and find and select the Images... button. Browse to the image that you downloaded and select it. Choose recovery and swipe to flash.\n\nFastboot Install Method (No Root Required):\n\nYou will need the platform-tools from the Android SDK on your computer. Download the platform-tools as per your operating system.\n\nWindows users will need proper drivers installed on their computer. You can try the simple FWUL adb/fastboot ISO or the Naked ADB drivers or the Universal ADB drivers if you don't already have a working driver installed\n\nOn your device, go into Settings -> About and find the Build Number and tap on it 7 times to enable developer settings. Press back and go into Developer Options and enable USB debugging. From your computer, open a command prompt and type:\n\nadb reboot bootloader\n\nYou should now be in fastboot mode.\n\nDownload the correct image file and copy the file into the same folder as your platform-tools. Rename the image to twrp.img and type:\n\nfastboot flash recovery twrp.img\n\nfastboot reboot\n\nNote many devices will replace your custom recovery automatically during first boot. To prevent this, use Google to find the proper key combo to enter recovery. After typing fastboot reboot, hold the key combo and boot to TWRP. Once TWRP is booted, TWRP will patch the stock ROM to prevent the stock ROM from replacing TWRP. If you don't follow this step, you will have to repeat the install.\n\nChangelog:"
