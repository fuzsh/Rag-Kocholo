        "text": "It's no surprise that kids are always begging to play with parents' tablets or cell phones — adults are so often on their screens that kids want a piece of the action. That's why tablets for kids exist. With one of them, you don't have to worry about handing kids your precious iPad, only to get it back with dents, scratches or sticky fingerprints.\n\nThese kid-friendly tablets are fairly similar to regular adult versions, except they're often more durable, offer parental controls for content and screen time and come with educational apps for kids.\n\n\"At the Good Housekeeping Institute, we appreciate children's tablets because they are designed specifically for smaller hands and frequent drops,\" says Media and Tech Reviews Analyst Olivia Lipski. \"As for the available child-friendly content, which is often preloaded, we want to ensure that it's vibrant and varied enough to keep kids entertained and educated.\"\n\nOur Lab experts regularly test all kinds of tech and children's products from baby monitors to convertible car seats. And many of our engineers are parents themselves, so you can trust that our recommendations take into account the reality of everyday life. Our pros appreciate kids' tech that doesn't cost a fortune and isn't going to be outdated in a year.\n\nAfter our picks, read on to learn more about how we chose the best tablet for your child's age as well as what you should keep in mind when shopping for a kids' tablet.\n\n1\n\nBest Overall Tablet for Kids\n\nAmazon Fire HD 10 Kids Tablet\n\nPros\n\nGreat parental controls\n\nRich content through Amazon Kids+\n\nLong battery life\n\nCan add popular apps\n\nCons\n\nNavigation takes some practice\n\nWith the latest Fire Kids Edition Tablet, your child can play games and watch videos with less worry about breakage; the 10-inch display comes with a durable case in either blue or aquamarine.\n\nOne tester said, \"The thick bumper makes it easier for my 4-year-old to grip, so I don't worry about it slipping from his hands.\"Our experts and testers especially like that this tablet provides access to curated kid-appropriate books, games and shows on which is free for the first year when you buy the tablet. After that, the service is $5 per year. (You can cancel the service anytime, and non-Amazon apps on the tablet will still work.) There are thousands of ad-free children's ebooks on Amazon Kids+, Audible books that kids can listen to plus shows from Disney Junior, Nickelodeon, National Geographic and more.\n\nParents can set educational goals and enforce time limits depending on the content (you can allow unlimited ebooks, for example, but limit game time to half an hour) — you can even choose to allow specific content down to the episode. You can also choose to give your child access to popular apps including Netflix, Disney+ and Zoom via the Amazon Parent Dashboard.\n\nStorage32 GB, expandable to 1 TBBattery lifeUp to 12 hoursBest agesKids 3 to 7Weight1.03 poundsDimensions9.73 x 6.53 x 0.36 inches\n\nPros\n\nUseful for both kids and adults\n\nGorgeous graphics\n\nSufficient storage for games and photos\n\nCons\n\nParents should buy a protective case separately\n\nOur most expensive pick\n\nThere are three situations in which an iPad might be the best tablet for your child: 1) You want a device that can be used by the entire family. 2) You already have an iPad in your household and want to give it to your child as a hand-me-down and use this one for yourself. 3) You're an iOS die-hard and don't want to learn another operating system. If you use an iPhone or are familiar with iOS this will be a snap for you to set this up and use it out of the box.\n\nAnd it's got some kid-friendly features too. Don't forget to set your \"Find My\" feature to track this tablet's whereabouts from your other iOS devices, so you can quickly see if it's in the car or left at Grandma's. You can also share subscriptions to Apple Music, Apple Arcade and Apple TV+ across devices. The iPad is equipped with Touch ID and you can enable parental controls by using a passcode for certain apps. This one has a 10.2-inch screen and costs another $69 if you add AppleCare+ protection. Also, note that iPads don't come with a , so you'll want to purchase one to make it more durable.\n\nStorage 64 GBBattery Life Up to 10 hoursBest ages Whole family ages 4 and upWeight 1.07 poundsDimensions 9.86 x 6.85 x 0.29 inches\n\nWhen shopping for a kid-friendly tablet, there are two important things to look for: storage and parental controls. Kids love to load up on apps and photos, which can eat up the internal storage space quickly.\n\nIf you plan on downloading a lot of content (like videos, games or additional apps), we suggest a tablet for kids with at least 16GB of storage. More storage is better, but it also increases the price. The ability to expand the storage with an external SD card, can be advantageous, though many have cloud-based options for expanding storage as well.\n\nParental controls allow you to manage how your kid uses the tablet, whether that's limits on screen time or restrictions on content. Our pros say to look for tablets that will filter out content based on age, have parent apps that let you keep tabs on what your kids are using or allow you to put time limits on usage.\n\nMany tablets geared for kids come without a camera to ensure their privacy, but some do feature them. None of our more toy-like selections have cameras included, though our picks that can be shared by the adults in the home from Samsung, Apple and Lenovo do.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends avoiding digital media for kids under 18 months, with the exception of video chatting. (You gotta let those far-flung friends and relatives see the baby.) For kids 18 months and older, the AAP says the ideal is to limit screen time to one hour per day. But even more important is the quality of the screen time. The AAP urges parents to choose high-quality, educational content. Parents should also make sure that screen time doesn't interfere with sleep or physical play.\n\nIf you're looking for a tablet for your toddler age 1, 2 or 3, you may want a toy-like tablet that offers educational content only. Our picks from Fisher-Price, Animal Island and WowWee fall into that toy-tablet category; you can't load additional content onto any of them and your toddler won't accidentally find an app that you don't want them on. None of the toy tablets have a camera, either. The one from Animal Island plays videos, and the ones from Fisher-Price and WowWee are video-free.\n\nIf you want a tablet that helps your preschooler or early-elementary kid age 4, 5 or 6 bone up on literacy and math skills, check out any of our first three picks from Amazon Fire and LeapFrog. A Fire tablet will have a camera and is better built for Zoom and apps such as Disney+ and Netflix; the LeapFrog is more strictly (and richly) educational, although it also has access to Android content.\n\nIf you're shopping for a first \"real\" tablet for a school-age kid age 7, 8, 9 or 10 — a child who is going to be gaming and watching videos and who may need to Zoom with a classmate or teacher — read up on the Amazon Fire Kids Edition, Samsung and Lenovo Android tablets as well as the iPad."
