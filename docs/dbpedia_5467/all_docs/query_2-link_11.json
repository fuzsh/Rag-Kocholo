        "text": "When it comes to Cyanogen-powered Android-based smartphones, you probably might have heard of OnePlus and Xiomi. Now, there is a new entrant on the market - Zuk - a Lenovo-backed company that makes smartphones based on the Cyanogen-variety of Android OS.\n\nThe Z1 comes packed with a 5.5-inch full HD screen, Cyanogen OS and runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor. In addition, the phone also features 3GB RAM and 64GB of internal storage capacity. What's more, the smartphone also packs in a Type-C USB 3.0 connector, which probably could be the first on the market, when it comes to smartphones.\n\nIn terms of battery life, the Z1 comes with a huge 4100mAh battery. With Dual SIM support with 4G LTE capabilities, the Z1 sounds like a perfect smartphone, at least on paper. In reality though, we were also impressed by the performance of the device, though the price tag of AED 1149 does seem a bit on the higher side.\n\nDesign-wise, the phone is a treat to look at and hold. The phone's body is made of an aluminum frame, and just under the 5-5-inch screen, you will find a home button that also doubles up as a fingerprint sensor. For shutterbugs, the phone comes with a 13-megapixel rear camera and 8-megapixel wide angle front camera.\n\nColour options include grey and white colours, and the phone weighs just 175-gms. On the right edge of the device you will find the volume buttons with the power switch placed just below it. On the left edge you will find the SIM cards and the memory expansion slot, all built into one slot, while on top you will find the audio jack, with the USB Type C connector at the bottom edge of the device.\n\nThe phone's display was quite delicious to look at. Colour pop out and the brightness level was just right, thanks to the phone's LiveDisplay tech which can automatically adjust the colour temperature and brightness depending on the time of the day.\n\nPerformance of the device was quite good - flicking through screens and apps felt fluid and swift. The 13-megapixel rear camera takes attractive photos outside, though we found a few noisy pictures when shooting under low light conditions or indoors.\n\nOne of the phone's stand out features is the huge 4100mAh battery. On a full charge, we were able to eke out close to two days of battery backup which is impressive. While the price tag of the device is bit on the higher side, it makes up for it, by offerin good design and build quality, good battery life, and an excellent software.\n\nIf you are on the market for a good phone, but would not want to spend through your nose for a good phone, the Lenovo Zuk Z1 could be something you could consider."
