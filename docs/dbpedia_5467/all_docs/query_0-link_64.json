        "text": "Lenovo has been producing smartphones with large batteries for quite a while, like the 4,000mAh-packing A5000, P70, and K80. Now, the company wants to step it up a notch by launching the Vibe P1 with a 5,000mAh battery. Not only that, it is clad in aluminum, sports a fingerprint sensor, and carries a not-so-hefty Php15K price tag. Is the Vibe P1 worth getting? Find out in our review below.\n\nDesign and Construction\n\nOne of the first things you’ll notice about the Vibe P1 is its attractive design and premium build. The front part reminds us of the OnePlus 2. Dominating the front is a 5.5-inch IPS display with Full HD resolution or 401ppi and mounted with Gorilla Glass 3. The display is sharp and vibrant with good colors and viewing angles.\n\nAbove it are the earpiece and the 5 megapixel front-facing camera. Down below is the physical home button that also doubles as the fingerprint scanner, and at its left and right sides are illuminated capacitive buttons for Recent apps and Back.\n\nSituated on the left side is the OneKey Power Saver switch to turn on its power saving mode. Found on the right side are the buttons for the volume and power/lock.\n\nRight up top are the headset jack and pinhole for the microphone. This top part is also removable which reveals a SIM tray for two nano-sized SIM cards and a separate slot for the microSD.\n\nDown at the bottom are the microUSB port as well as the speaker and microphone.\n\nFlip it on its back and you will see the curved metallic body which reminds us of the HTC One. Here you can see the 13 megapixel camera with dual-tone LED flash and NFC.\n\nOn hand, the Vibe P1 feels premium which is not common for a device priced under Php15K. It’s slightly hefty at 187g and a bit chunky at 9.9mm (justified given the 5,000mAh battery) but it has this certain appeal that makes you want to hold it every now and then. Overall, this is one of the nicest phones that Lenovo has released to date."
