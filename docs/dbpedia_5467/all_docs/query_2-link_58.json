        "text": "Lenovo-backed smartphone start-up ZUK unveiled the international version of its Z1 smartphone, with a partnership with platform player Cyanogen designed to “bring the best customised Android experience to international users”.\n\nThe company unveiled the device for the Chinese market earlier this month, and the company said that it “quickly became a hit”. More than 2 million pre-orders were received within one week, and 40,000 handsets sold out immediately after the first purchase wave kicked off on 18 August.\n\nThe overseas device has “almost the same top hardware configurations as the Chinese version”. It is said to be the world’s first smartphone featuring a reversible type-C charging port with USB 3.0 data transfer speeds.\n\nIt has a 5.5-inch full HD display, fingerprint sensor, large 4100mAh battery, Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor, 3GB of RM and 64GB of storage, 13MP rear and 8MP front cameras.\n\nIn international guise, it comes with Cyanogen OS 12.1 pre-loaded. The Chinese version uses a home-grown Android variant called ZUI OS.\n\nThe international version of Z1 is expected to go on sale in Europe, America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East from September, priced from $299. Colour options are white or space grey."
