If Cyanogen is your favorite flavor of Android, it just got a little better: today ZUK announced that the international version of the handset will come loaded with the commercial version of Cyanogen OS 12.1.\n\nThis international version of the phone will feature the same specs as its Chinese counterpart, including a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 CPU, 3GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and a 5.5-inch 1080p display -- but it'll cost a tiny bit more. In Europe, the US, southeast Asia and the middle east, the ZUK Z1 will retail for $299 and up. Sound good? Sit tight: the Z1 is scheduled to launch internationally sometime in September."
