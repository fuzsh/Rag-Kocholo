The large screens of tablets, foldables, and ChromeOS devices showcase content, facilitate multitasking, and enable user interfaces not possible on small screens.\n\nImagine your app on large screens\n\nA more productive productivity app, more engaging media app, more immersive game. Imagine what you can do with the wide open display space of large screens.\n\nProductivity\n\nMake apps more productive with plenty of work space for tools, text, and uncluttered interactivity.\n\nCreativity\n\nEnable big ideas on large screens. Put palettes, pickers, and panels within easy reach of finger or stylus for natural creative control.\n\nMedia\n\nExpand the viewing or listening experience with related content such as similar titles, author biographies, playlists, or song lyrics.\n\nFor more large screen designs, visit the large screen gallery.\n\nBuild for everyone…\n\nLarge screen devices are a fast growing market segment. Enable your app to run on all large screen form factors in addition to standard phones. Make your app available to as many users as possible. Build for every device, for everyone.\n\n…with the help of app quality guidelines\n\nTo get started with large screen development, follow the Large screen app quality guidelines. The guidelines are a comprehensive set of requirements designed to help make your app the best it can be on large screens.\n\nApp quality tiers\n\nThe quality guidelines are organized into three tiers: Large screen ready, Large screen optimized, and Large screen differentiated. Add large screen capabilities to your app by progressively working through the tiers, starting with Large screen ready. If you have an existing app, use the quality guideline tests to determine the tier your app supports, then implement features tier by tier until your app is uniquely differentiated for large screens.\n\nTier 3\n\nLarge screen\n\nready\n\nExpand your app's possibilities on large screens. Support portrait and landscape device orientations and multi-window mode. Create layouts that fill the available app space.\n\nTier 2\n\nLarge screen\n\noptimized\n\nIncrease user engagement. Accommodate displays of all sizes with responsive/adaptive layouts. Support keyboard, mouse, trackpad, and stylus.\n\nTier 1\n\nLarge screen differentiated\n\nMake your app stand out from the app store crowd. Add differentiated features like tabletop posture on foldables for a user experience standard phones can't match.\n\n…and proven canonical layouts\n\nThe large screen canonical layouts—list‑detail, feed, and supporting pane—are versatile, popular UI designs. Implement the layouts in your app to provide an optimized large screen experience your users will love.\n\nGet started\n\nSelect a quality tier and get started with large screens—all screens—today!"
