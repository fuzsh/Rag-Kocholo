        "text": "The King Zone Z1 Plus one is the king when it comes to selfies, because there are two cameras with 13 megapixels and sensors from Sony. Better selfies you can hardly make now. It is very nice that all necessary LTE frequencies are supported, so are the channels B7 and B20 (LTE 800) full disposal. The equipment is consistently solid, because the processor MediaTek (MTK6753) runs just as smoothly, as the Mali-T720 GPU and 2GB of RAM with 8 CPU cores and 1.3 GHz clock.\n\nThe operating system Android is 5.1, which always liquid l√§uft.Dank the moderately clocked CPU and 3500 mAh battery, really comes every good throughout the day. In normal use, it also creates problems for the second day, without to the charger.\n\nThe 5.5 inches OGS IPS display has 1280 x 720 pixels. Thanks to the OGS Technoligie the display is very energy efficient and overall the \"Japan Panel\" a good choice. Image reproduction is remarkably bright and the contrast is very good for an IPS panel. As protection from scratches Gorilla Glass from Corning used.\n\nThe cameras are, as already mentioned above, not bad. Both sensors Sony had their fingers in the game. During a 13MP main camera is rather normal, so a 13MP selfie cam is already a real feature. Above all, the photo quality from both cameras, for a mid-range device, really outstanding. Camera features such as anti-shake, face beautification, face detection and HDR are available on the menu. The aperture (f / 2.0) also makes sense from poor lighting conditions still the best and the LED flash will be automatically added as needed.\n\nThe housing is high-quality and the King Zone Z1 Plus is only 139 grams very light. Due to the metal frame, the necessary stability is given and small details like the red bars on the loudspeakers + microphone, let the Z1 Plus look elegant and sporty. Especially when you consider that a fat 3,500 mAh battery sits inside and there is a 5.5 inch phablet, the light weight is truly remarkable."
