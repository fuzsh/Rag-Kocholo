        "text": "When developing your Android app, keep in mind that your app runs on devices including Fire tablets with different screen sizes, hardware features, and software implementations. To help ensure that your app works well across a broad array of devices, query the features of the device hardware or software and be responsive to the features that are available.\n\nAvoid trying to detect specific device models such as Fire tablets. Device detection is less flexible than feature detection, and adds development effort over time when you add device models.\n\nYou can detect features in several different ways, such as by querying the package manager, performing reflection, or checking the result of convenience methods. For example, to determine if a camera intent is available, you can use PackageManager to determine if the camera software is installed on the device.\n\nFire Tablet Features\n\nThe following table lists common Fire tablet features, including the build model, API level, and Fire OS version.
