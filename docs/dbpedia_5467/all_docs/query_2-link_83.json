        "text": "News\n\nTech News\n\nLenovo ZUK Z1 review: Built to impress\n\nThis story is from May 19, 2016\n\nLenovo ZUK Z1 review: Built to impress\n\nAt a price of Rs 13,499, the ZUK Z1 is a perfect budget smartphone. Itâs one of the very few smartphones about which youâll likely have very little to complain.\n\nAt a price of Rs 13,499, the ZUK Z1 is a perfect budget smartphone. Itâs one of the very few smartphones about which youâll likely have very little to complain.\n\nLenovo seems all geared up to take the lead in the budget Indian smartphone market. After its own âKâ series and the highly successful Moto series from its now-owned Motorola stable, the company has now brought its ZUK sub-brand to India.\n\nLenovoâs online-only sub-brand, ZUK is set to compete against the likes of Xiaomi, LeEco, and OnePlus. The Z1 is the first smartphone in India to bear the ZUK branding, and comes with Lenovoâs promise of quality. One look at ZUK Z1âs specifications is enough to remind anyone of the much talked about OnePlus One. While the OnePlus One is dated now, the Z1 is looking to gain some marketshare with its competitive price tag of Rs 13,499.\n\nRead also: Lenovo ZUK Z1 first flash sale\n\nZUK Z1 has entered India almost a year late, and the market is now packed with feature packed Android smartphones that cost under Rs 15,000. In fact, the newly launched Moto G4 Plus by Lenovo-owned Motorola is also similarly priced. So with numerous affordable smartphones already rubbing shoulders against each other, does the ZUK Z1 stand a chance in the Indian smartphone market? Read our detailed review to find out.\n\nDesign and display\n\nThe ZUK Z1 looks simplistic yet attractive. It boasts a metal frame paired with a plastic rear panel. Build quality is surprisingly good and the phone is lightweight as well. The fingerprint scanner perfectly blends with the front glass panel and thus, doesnât stick out. Despite having a 5.5-inch screen, the device is very handy. The curved back helps a lot with the grip as well.\n\nThis smartphone comes with a massive 4,100mAh battery and Lenovo has done a good job in tackling the weight of the device. The front panel is nothing unique, and looks similar to any other budget smartphone.\n\nZUK Z1 offers a 5.5-inch Full HD display of 1,080x1,920 pixels resolution, with pixel density coming at around 401ppi. Overall, the display quality is decent. The panel offers good colour reproduction and contrast ratio. The viewing angles are decent too. However, It is not easy to use the phone under direct sunlight due to the reflective display.\n\nPerformance and camera\n\nThe ZUK Z1 is powered by a quad-core 2.5 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor paired with 3GB RAM and 64GB of internal memory. While the processor is dated, itâs still flagship-class and thus shouldnât be an issue for most users. The fact that itâs included in a phone priced at Rs 13,499 only makes things better.\n\nOverall, the device proved to be really smooth during our testing. We didnât experience any hiccups while multi-tasking, even with intensive apps. Gaming performance was good too.\n\nLenovo ZUK Z1 is among the cheapest smartphones that offer 64GB of in-built storage. However, there is no microSD card slot.\n\nThe ZUK Z1 is not a phone to run benchmark tests on as it houses a pretty old processor, and the same will reflect in the scores. But for spec lovers who arenât willing to spend beyond Rs 15,000, this phone ticks all the right boxes.\n\nZUK Z1 is a dual-sim smartphone with 4G support for both. It is backed by a 4,100mAh battery that easily lasted us a full day with moderate use. The phone also comes with a USB Type-C port.\n\nThe best feature of the ZUK Z1 has to be its software. It offers a welcome change from typical custom UIs found on most Chinese smartphones. The phone runs Cyanogen OS 12.1 based on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. With Cyanogen OS, users not only get to enjoy a different experience but also extensive customization. This is ideal for users who love to tweak the look and feel of their smartphones regularly. Cyanogen OS ran smoothly on the phone, without any bugs or errors.\n\nOn the camera front, there is a 13MP rear camera with dual LED flash and optical image stabilization along with an 8MP selfie shooter. The camera is fast and captured some decent shots during our testing. However, low light images didnât turn out to be that good. The 8MP camera on the front delivered appreciably good selfies as well.\n\nVerdict\n\nAt a price of Rs 13,499, the ZUK Z1 is a perfect budget smartphone. Itâs one of the very few smartphones about which youâll likely have very little to complain. Lenovo ZUK Z1 delivers on all fronts, and can be considered as a cheaper OnePlus One. However, the real challenge for prospective buyers will be deciding between the ZUK Z1 and the recently launched Moto G4 Plus.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA"
