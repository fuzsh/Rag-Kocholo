        "text": "surely not the Galaxy S8 or S8+ ... Samsung is dead and buried for me, personal opinion but you also notified one of the many cons i can find about samsung phones ... : the price, they have become like Apple: overpriced with nothing behind to back it up, ok with a contract subscription they are less expensive (or are they ... a C-Sub is a leasing and in the end you will probably pay more than without ) tho you seems like me since you buy SIM free phones\n\nthe main \"innovation\" Samsung put forward is the screen, if we except the Ratio (who is a bit too odd for me) they did what countless other manufacturer do (extending the screen ratio make it bigger indeed) and curved edge is ... a little annoying for some (unwanted screen touch registering by simply holding the phone... for example)\n\nHTC U Ultra ... mmhhh not bad but still ... Snapdragon 821? well ... i like HTC but i've come to hate Qualcomm because of the SD800/810/820 and 616 (lot of issues, like overheating, poor battery performances etc etc etc )\n\nfor example i owned several Honor xX series smartphone (i am more a middle high end than high end .... why paying 600+ when a 200-300~ will do the same... unless PocketMQO with a physics heavy model, but i can live with only 30fps at 1080p while using PocketMQO)\n\nHonor 4X : Kirin 620, 2gb 8gb+32gb 2 to 3 days with a mild use, no overheating all games i ran with where smooth, UI smooth too\n\nHonor 5X : Snapdragon 616 2gb 16gb+64gb 2 days with the same usage, could run quite hot depending the games/app, some throttling in games, UI not so smooth (not a bad phone tho)\n\nHonor 7 : Kirin 935 3gb 16gb+128gb 2 to 3 days same usage, no overheating, games smooth, UI smooth (well that one is/was considered as a high end)\n\nHonor 6X : Kirin 655 3gb 32gb+128gb 2 to 3 days same usage, no overheating, games smooth, UI smooth\n\n(for the story, i actually replaced the Honor 5X by the 7 so i would not give the 5X to my mother, initially i intended to get the 6X but my etailer didn't had it, now my mother has the 7 and totally love it )\n\nbetween the 2 you mention : HTC U Ultra if no other option catch your attention.\n\nalso, what are your expectation for a Smartphone? because nearly all \"flagship\" are overkill/overpriced for most user, and even some lower priced handset can perform similarly depending the task and uses"
