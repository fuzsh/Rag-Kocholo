        "text": "Press Release: Los Angeles, CA – FilmRise is proud to announce it has acquired the North American rights to Dead Awake, the next film from the creator of the Final Destination franchise.\n\nFilmRise acquired the film in a deal with Archstone Distribution during this month’s American Film Market. The distributor plans a theatrical release in the U.S. in early 2017.\n\nThe horror/thriller is about a young woman who must save herself and her friends from an ancient evil that stalks its victims through the real-life phenomenon of sleep paralysis. Dead Awake is directed by Phillip Guzman and stars Lori Petty (Orange is the New Black, A League of Their Own, Point Break), Jesse Bradford (Flags of Our Fathers, Romeo and Juliet, Bring It On), and Jocelin Donahue (Furious 7, Insidious: Chapter 2, The House of the Devil).\n\n“Phillip Guzman’s ‘Dead Awake’ is a terrifying film that we are excited to be bringing to audiences in North America,” said Danny Fisher, CEO of FilmRise. “I had the privilege of working previously with the highly talented Jeffrey Reddick, creator of ‘Final Destination,’ on a film I executive produced that he wrote called ‘Tamara.’”\n\n“We are thrilled to be working with FilmRise,” commented President/CEO of Archstone Brady Bowen, “‘Dead Awake’ is in good hands and we look forward to getting this out for the public to enjoy.”\n\nThe deal was negotiated between Fisher and FilmRise’s VP of Acquisitions Max Einhorn with Archstone.\n\nFilmRise is a film and TV distribution company founded by veteran producer/financiers Danny Fisher, Jack Fisher and Alan Klingenstein. With over 6,000 titles in a wide range of genres, the company's film acquisitions and releases include HBO’s multiple Emmy®-winning “Going Clear” and “Janis: Little Girl Blue,” directed by Oscar®-nominated filmmaker Amy J. Berg and produced by Oscar®-winner Alex Gibney. Television titles include hit series such as Showtime’s Emmy®-winning “Years of Living Dangerously,” and the longest running true crime show on television “Forensic Files.” Titles are in release digitally on Amazon Prime, iTunes, Netflix, Hulu, VUDU, Xbox, Sony PlayStation, Crackle and other platforms, and on DVD and BluRay on Amazon and over 200 online retailers, including Walmart and Barnes & Noble. FilmRise’s recent acquisitions are two-time Academy Award®-nominee Julie Delpy’s “Lolo”; the acclaimed documentary “The Witness”; “Five Nights in Maine,” starring Oscar®-winner Dianne Wiest, David Oyelowo, and Oscar®-nominee Rosie Perez; the buzzed-about horror-comedy “The Greasy Strangler”; the SXSW documentary “Silicon Cowboys”; the award-winning doc “Harry & Snowman”; the drone warfare documentary “National Bird”; Sean Brosnan’s revenge thriller “My Father Die”; the fascinating LSD documentary “The Sunshine Makers”; the Tribeca-premiered chess documentary “Magnus”; and the critically-acclaimed, controversial Sundance drama, “White Girl.” For more information go to: www.FilmRise.com\n\nArchstone Distribution is a sales and distribution company focused on delivering high quality theatrical films and documentaries to the world-wide audience. Headquartered in Los Angeles, Archstone is perfectly positioned for global distribution through their established relationships with reputable distributors in each territory.\n\nPress Release: NEW YORK – Film and television distributor FilmRise today announced that it has acquired worldwide distribution rights to Kevin Burke’s documentary 24X36: A Movie About Movie Posters. The distributor will release the documentary on all major digital platforms, as well as DVD and Blu-ray in 2017.\n\nA world premiere at Fantastic Fest, 24X36 examines the lost art of movie poster illustration through the recollections of the filmmakers, collectors, historians, artists and curators committed to keeping the tradition alive. Director Kevin Burke conducted extensive interviews with devotees of the art form, including gallerists who distribute limited-edition screen printed tributes to cult films in new and original designs. The return of craftsmanship to this area of niche poster design has corresponded with renewed demand for authentic one-sheets from the golden era of the illustrated movie poster. Intertwining these two spheres of interest, one in homage to the illustrated poster’s past and another in anticipation of its future, 24X36 makes a compelling argument for the art form’s continued cultural relevance.\n\nFeaturing interviews with many renowned illustrators—including David Byrd, Roger Kastel,\n\nJason Edmiston, Gary Pullin, Justin Erickson, Paige Reynolds and Laurent Durieux—this engrossing documentary premiered at the Fantastic Fest in Austin, TX to critical acclaim. The movie was produced by Kevin Burke, Graham Lee, Andrea Butler, Richard Chan and Snowfort Pictures’ David Lawson. Executive Producers are Travis Stevens, Stephanie Trepanier, Wendy Donnan, Matthew Chojnacki, Jared Dobbs and Mike Gregory.\n\n“24X36 is a love letter to the generations of artists and collectors who have carried on one of Hollywood’s oldest traditions,” said Danny Fisher, CEO of FilmRise. “We’re thrilled to begin sharing it with film enthusiasts everywhere.”\n\n“We couldn’t envision a better fit for 24X36 than FilmRise,” said the film’s director Kevin Burke. “After a successful premiere at Fantastic Fest, I’m looking forward to the release of our film to a wider audience.”\n\nThe deal was negotiated between Fisher and FilmRise’s VP of Acquisitions Max Einhorn with Travis Stevens of Snowfort Pictures, Inc. Snowfort Pictures’ previous documentary effort Jodorwsky’s Dune won multiple festival and critics’ awards before being shortlisted for the Oscars.\n\nABOUT FILMRISE\n\nFilmRise is a film and TV distribution company founded by veteran producer/financiers Danny Fisher, Jack Fisher and Alan Klingenstein.
