        "text": "Director: Amy J. Berg\n\nStarring. Oliver O’Grady. USA. 1h 41m.\n\nThere comes a time when people just need to own up to the shit they did, however evil and intense, the humane search in the void for an unbiased look into such confessions from budding director Amy J. Berg is perfect in its direct candid approach but it only makes everything seem so much more sinister, not that it’s a easy subject to view in the first place.\n\nAmy J. Berg conjures up a quiet and peaceful atmosphere for setting her subjects, primarily Irish priest Oliver O’Grady, with lots of shots in churches and decorative offices, the focus is entirely on the person trying to tell their story and this is totally important with docufilms.\n\nThe film follows the life of O’Grady who admitted to molesting and raping approximately 25 children while working in California, the priest was at the centre a series of cover up’s and controversy with the Catholic Church when details of abusers and victims seem to be non-existent, priests accused and confirmed to be abusing children are shifted around on a sort of paedophile silk road.\n\nO’Grady’s gentle and quiet persona comes across as sincere, however he’s not a broken man, he holds his head high and confident that he’s paid his dues and doing gods work. In stark contrast his victims are outraged that he’s just mulling around Europe working with children, this revelation really broke a few new headlines when the film was first shown in Holland in 2011, members of a parish in Schiedam recognized O’Grady as having been an active volunteer in the parish until January 2010. So the saga continues.\n\nWith Amy J. Berg ‘s in depth and sobering approach, no stone is left unturned and no tear is spared. It’s so on point and uncovers such damaging information that a lot of people struggle to take it all in and believe it to be true, can something do dark and damaging just be so openly swept under the carpet? With the title mimicking the line from the lords prayer which deeply impacts the story, we have to remember that everyone can be forgiven in the eyes of their Christian lord, no? In theory he’ll be forgiven but it’s only in the hearts of the victims, the courts and anyone with a conscience that he still needs to be considered dangerous, it’s one of those areas of faith that really clash with a changing world.\n\nTragically the closing credits kinda hits the viewer in the gut and is a poignant closing to a harrowing documentary which hopefully keeps the spotlight on something that cannot be forgotten.\n\nTLDR\n\nRating 6/10\n\nRelated –Twist of Faith (2004), An Open Secret (2014), Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God (2012)\n\nList – Abuse Documentaries, Peado Priests in Cinema\n\nPost Discussion"
