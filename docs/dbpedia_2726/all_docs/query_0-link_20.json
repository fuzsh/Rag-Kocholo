        "text": "Continuing their support for women directors, Horizon Award co-founding producers Cassian Elwes, Lynette Howell Taylor, and Christine Vachon, announced the winners of the second annual Horizon Award. Academy Award nominee Chloë Sevigny will bestow up-and-coming filmmakers Macarena Gaona, Juliette Gosselin, Shanice Malakai Johnson, and Florence Pelletier with the Horizon Award at a reception in Park City, Utah, with creative talent, producers, entertainment executives and media in attendance to celebrate these rising women directors and their achievements in independent filmmaking.\n\nThe Horizon Award ceremony and reception will take place on Sunday, January 24th, 2016 at 6:30 pm at the WireImage Portrait Studio at Village at the Lift (825 Main Street, Park City), co-hosted by Jeff Vespa.\n\nThe Horizon Award is an annual award that seeks to identify and mentor talented, up-and-coming female directors – the primary goal being to support women directors early enough in their development to help them overcome the hurdles in advancing their learning curve and careers.\n\nIn addition to the Horizon Award, the four winners will receive grants from the Adrienne Shelly Foundation. The Foundation supports the artistic achievements of female filmmakers through a series of grants that reflect Adrienne Shelly’s dedication to the art of filmmaking and her own successful transition from actress to filmmaker.\n\nThis year’s winners are:\n\nHorizon Award First Place\n\nJuliette Gosselin (University of Quebec in Montreal) & Florence Pelletier (Concordia University, Montreal)\n\nCo-directors of \"Mes Anges à Tête Noire\"\n\nHorizon Award Runners-Up\n\nMacarena (Macqui) Gaona (New York University) Director of \"Channel 999 and Channel 1000\"\n\nShanice Malakai Johnson (Scottsdale Community College) Director of \"End to the Suffering\"\n\nOn making the announcement, Cassian Elwes said: “I’m so excited to announce the winners of the second annual Horizon Award. This year’s overwhelming number of submissions and caliber of work made it very hard indeed to pick just one winner – the jury identified one grand prize winner, and two runners-up. Additionally, we have added new partners to our already formidable team – proving that not only is the move towards gender equality in the zeitgeist, but that there are very real advocates amongst our peers. After the recent summit for systemic change (hosted by Sundance and Women in Film), I am more convinced than ever that we can make a difference and that history is on our side. I remain steadfastly committed to the idea that, one day soon, women will have exactly the same opportunities as men to direct movies.”\n\nFranklin Leonard, Founder and CEO of The Black List and one of the award’s original advocates added: “We are passionate supporters of this award that recognizes fresh voices and perspectives in storytelling. This effort mirrors our own effort – the Black List's 500 Feminist Films project, created by our Director of Community, Kate Hagen. We look forward to mentoring the winners in the year to come.”\n\nThe jury was comprised of 38 influential directors, producers, and executives from the filmmaking community who viewed 483 short film submissions from over 200 colleges and universities world-wide, including the U.S., Canada, England, Australia, India, China, South Africa, Scotland, France, Mexico, Portugal, Columbia, Brazil, Russia, Serbia, the Ukraine, and more. This year, submissions increased by over one hundred from last year, with additional countries and universities participating. Submissions were received from Nyu, USC, UCLA, Chapman, Emerson, Penn State, Loyola Marymount, University of Wisconsin, University of Washington, Syracuse, Tcu, Ryerson (Toronto), Oxford, University of Sydney, University of Melbourne, University of Delhi, and more.\n\nNow in its second year, the Horizon Award provides an all-expense-paid trip for the winning female college students to the Sundance Film Festival, where they will have the opportunity to present their films to some of the industry’s most influential names. The winners receive mentorship, festival access, and important introductions by Elwes, Howell, and Vachon to agents, producers, executives, festival staff, and other influencers throughout the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThe Horizon Award was founded by producer, Cassian Elwes (\"Margin Call,\" \"All is Lost,\" \"Dallas Buyers Club\"), and Michelle Satter, Founding Director, Sundance Institute’s Feature Film Program, in response to a Sundance Institute and Women In Film Los Angeles study that revealed that only 4.2% of the top 100 films each year from 2002-2013 were directed by women. Elwes partnered with Howell (\"Captain Fantastic,\" \"Mississippi Grind,\" \"Big Eyes,\" \"The Place Beyond the Pines:), and Vachon ( \"Goat,\" \"Carol,\" \"Boys Don’t Cry,\" \"One Hour Photo,\" \"Far From Heaven\"), to create the award as an opportunity for young female directors to have mentorship and networking opportunities in conjunction with Sundance, the home of American Independent film.\n\nYou can see links for more info on the study:\n\nPhase I and II\n\nPhase III\n\nSponsors and Partners for the 2016 Horizon Award are: The Black List, CreativeFuture, The Creative Mind Group, Done To Your Taste Catering, FilmLA, Indiegogo, Mprm Communications, the Adrienne Shelly Foundation, Sundance Institute, Twitter, Verge, Vimeo, WireImage, Adina Design, and Women in Film. This impressive group has come together to support an award that they hope will continue to identify, nurture, and launch the careers of future female directors for years to come.\n\nFull List of Jurors:\n\nStephanie Allain Producer (\"Dear White People,\" \"Hustle & Flow\")\n\nDori Begley Magnolia Pictures (Svp, Acquisitions)\n\nAmy Berg Director (\"Janis: Little Girl Blue,\" \"Deliver Us From Evil,\" \"Prophet’s Prey\")\n\nArianna Bocco IFC Films (Svp, Acquisitions & Co-Productions)\n\nRobbie Brenner The Firm (Partner, President of Film)\n\nSusan Carter Hall Painter\n\nAmal ElWardi Zeal Media Company (Producer)\n\nCassian Elwes Producer (\"Margin Call,\" \"All is Lost,\" \"Dallas Buyers Club\")\n\nJanet Grillo Director (\"Jack of the Red Hearts,\" \"Fly Away\")\n\nPoppy Hanks Macro Venture (Svp, Development & Production)\n\nCatherine Hardwicke Director (\"Miss You Already,\" \"Red Riding Hood,\" \"Twilight\")\n\nLynette Howell Taylor Producer (\"Captain Fantastic,\" \"Mississippi Grind,\" \"Big Eyes\")\n\nLiza Johnson Director (\"Elvis & Nixon,\" \"Return,\" \"Hateship Loveship,\" \"In the Air\")\n\nEda Kowan Lionsgate (Svp, Acquisitions & Co-Productions)\n\nGina Kwon Amazon Studios (Executive, Comedy)\n\nHelen Lee-Kim Good Universe (Partner, Head of International)\n\nLaura Lewis CAA (Agent, Film Finance)\n\nAlix Madigan Broad Green Pictures (Head, Creative)\n\nMarianna Palka Actress/Director (\"I’m the Same,\"\"Always Worthy,\" \"Good Dick\")\n\nBruna Papandrea Pacific Standard (Producer/Partner)\n\nKeri Putnam Sundance Institute (Executive Director)\n\nDee Rees Director (\"Bessie,\" “Empire”)\n\nLaura Rister Untitled Entertainment (Head of Production)\n\nRena Ronson UTA (Partner)\n\nMichelle Satter Sundance Institute (Director, Feature Film Program)\n\nCathy Schulman Stx Entertainment (President & Chief Content Officer)\n\nLauren Selig Shake and Bake Productions (Executive Producer)\n\nMary Jane Skalski Producer (\"The Visitor,\" \"Mysterious Skin,\" \"The Station Agent\")\n\nLara Thompson E1 Entertainment (Svp, Worldwide Acquisitions)\n\nChristine Vachon Producer (\"Goat,\" \"Carol,\" \"Boys Don’t Cry\")\n\nRuth Vitale CreativeFuture (CEO)\n\nAngie Wang Director (\"Cardinal X\")\n\nHanna Weg Producer (\"Septembers of Shiraz\")\n\nTanya Wexler Director (\"Hysteria,\" \"Finding North,\" \"Ball in the House\")\n\nJoanne Wiles ICM (Partner/Agent, Motion Picture Talent)\n\nPam Williams Pam Williams Productions (\"Lee Daniels’ The Butler,\" \"Fail Safe\")\n\nLisa Wilson The Solution Entertainment (Co-Founder/Partner)\n\nSo Yong Kim Director (\"Love Song,\" \"For Ellen,\" \"In Between Days\")...\n\n“From Everything I’ve seen and learned, prison is not about helping people reform or rehabilitate, or learn to read, or get a job. It’s not about reconciliation or healing the victims of crime. It’s not about public safety, and it’s not about the wellbeing of our communities. It’s about two things: our worst instinct to revenge and the worship of money.”\n\nAward winning Producer, Director & Human Rights Activist Matthew Cooke is using the power of crowd funding via Indiegogo to finish his film Survivor’S Guide To Prison, an exposé on the barbaric acts of the Us Prison system that holds 25% of the world’s prison population.\n\nThe film’s Executive Producers include Adrian Grenier and Susan Sarandon, and features interviews with Harry Belafonte, Deepak Chopra, Russell Simmons, Author of The New Jim Crow Michelle Alexander, Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine, and Brandon Boyd, the singer of Incubus.\n\nHis chilling exploration dives deep into the criminally abusive & socially unjust realities of incarceration through the perspectives of two prisoners who were convicted of crimes they did not commit. This is an all too common story in the Us where the Innocence Project estimates there could easily be anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000 people in Us prisons that haven’t committed a crime.\n\nYour support of the film’s Indiegogo campaign will help to do more than just finish a film. It will help to give a loud roar to a nearly silent movement to end human rights abuses of an unfathomable scale.\n\nWatch Cooke’s gripping and poignant call to action, and learn more about the chilling facts below:\n\nThe Us has the largest prison population on the planet, larger than China.\n\n1/3 of all women prisoners in the world are in Us prisons.\n\nIf you’re an American, you’re more likely to go to prison here than anyone else in the entire world.\n\nMore Black men are in prison now, than the total enslaved in 1850.\n\nThe USA Has More Prisons Than Colleges And Universities.\n\nMore About Matthew Cooke:\n\nIn 2013 Cooke released his directorial debut How To Make Money Selling Drugs which he also wrote, narrated, shot, edited and art directed. Drugs was produced by Bert Marcus Productions and Adrian Grenier featuring Eminem, 50 Cent, Susan Sarandon, Woody Harrelson and others. Drugs was bought and distributed by Robert DeNiro's Tribeca Film where it debuted at #1 on iTunes and Amazon. Drugs won the audience award at the Champs-Elysees and Newport Film Festivals and the Best Writing Award from the International Documentary Association.\n\nIn 2007 Cooke produced and edited his first feature film. Deliver Us From Evil, written + directed by Amy Berg, was honored with the Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary film, made over 100 critics \"best of\" lists and Rotten Tomatoes top 100 best reviewed films of all time."
