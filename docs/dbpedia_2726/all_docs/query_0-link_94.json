Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.\n\n★ ‘Amour’ (PG-13, 2:07) A masterpiece about life, death and everything in between, the latest from the great director Michael Haneke (“The White Ribbon,” “Caché”) takes a long, hard, tender look at an elderly French couple, Georges and Anne — played by two titans of French cinema, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva — in their final days. Bring hankies. (Manohla Dargis)\n\n★ ‘Anna Karenina’ (R, 2:10) Joe Wright’s version of the Tolstoy novel, with a script by Tom Stoppard, is wildly, sometimes dizzily theatrical, taking place mostly on a series of elaborate stage sets. The story of Anna (Keira Knightley), her humorless husband (Jude Law) and her lover, Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) becomes a lush melodrama, counterpointed by the delicate romance of Kitty (Alicia Vikander) and Levin (Domhnall Gleeson). Not a faithful adaptation, by any means, but something better: a bold, lively and ardent reimagining of the book. (A. O. Scott)\n\n★ ‘Argo’ (R, 2:00) A bearded Ben Affleck directed, and stars in, this smart, jittery thriller about a real if stranger-than-fiction chapter of the Iranian hostage crisis that brought together a smart American intelligence officer, some plucky Canadians and two jaundiced Hollywood veterans (the funny tag team of John Goodman and Alan Arkin) to save the day. (Dargis)\n\n★ ‘Barbara’ (PG-13; 1:45) Christian Petzold directs this tense, smart film about an East German doctor (Nina Hoss) who, after an unspecified offense, has been banished to the boonies. There, in between hospital rounds and harassment from the secret police, she waits and she burns. (Dargis)\n\n‘The Central Park Five’ (No rating, 1:59) Directed by Ken Burns, David McMahon and Sarah Burns, this documentary revisits the 1989 rape and beating of the white woman known as the Central Park jogger and the five black and Latino teenagers accused of assaulting her. The five were imprisoned but later exonerated; the filmmakers look back at what happened and why. (Dargis)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
