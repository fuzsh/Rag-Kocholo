In Yury Bykov’s film, a plumber discovers a crack in an apartment building’s facade, which could lead to two very bad things: (1) The building may fall apart and kill 800 residents; or (2) the plumber may be punished by the corrupt power structure, because reporting the problem was pointing out someone’s bad work. Fixing the crack? No?\n\nPAWN SACRIFICE The so-called chess match of the century (Iceland, 1972) — certainly of the Cold War years — with a genius-and-madness theme thrown in. Tobey Maguire plays the American prodigy Bobby Fischer, and Liev Schreiber is the Soviet champion Boris Spassky. Edward Zwick (“Glory”) directed. Also starring Lily Rabe and Peter Sarsgaard.\n\nPEACE OFFICER Tanks, grenade launchers and armed robots on the streets? Not a war movie being filmed in your neighborhood. It’s just your local cops these days. This documentary from Scott Christopherson and Brad Barber tackles the issue of increasingly militarized police departments in American cities and towns.\n\nSept. 17\n\nTIRED MOONLIGHT The filmmaker Britni West goes back to her Montana hometown and follows several characters through the little crises in their lives. When the film, a slice of American regional realism, was at New Directors/New Films this year, A. O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, praised it and Ms. West, making her feature directing debut, for “an easygoing, perceptive sense of character and place” and “an almost complete allergy to cliché.”\n\nSept. 18\n\nABOUT RAY The fall’s first big transgender drama (there are more to come), with Elle Fanning as the title teenager transitioning from Ramona. Susan Sarandon is his live-in lesbian grandmother, who has trouble with his decision. Naomi Watts is his single mother, who needs the father’s permission for hormone therapy. Gaby Dellal directed.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
