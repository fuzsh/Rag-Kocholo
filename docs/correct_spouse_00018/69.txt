Katmandu - Popular Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala married Nepalese businessman Samrat Dahal in a traditional ceremony attended by family and close friends on Friday.

The wedding rituals, spread over three days, were conducted by Hindu temple priests at a forest resort just outside Katmandu in Nepal's capital.

Koirala, 40, who belongs to a powerful Nepalese political family, was one of the best-known actresses in India in the 1990s. She has turned to film production in Nepal after a lull in her Bollywood career.

Koirala was named a UN goodwill ambassador for her work to promote women's rights and her campaign to prevent trafficking of Nepalese girls in 1999.
