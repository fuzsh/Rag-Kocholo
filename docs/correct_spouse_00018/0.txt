The gorgeous actress, Manisha Koirala is one of the most critically acclaimed actresses of the '90s. With movies like 1942: A Love Story, Bombay, Agni Sakshi, Gupt, Dil Se and many more, Manisha had won the hearts of millions. However, even to this very day, it's still impossible to find an actress, who can effortlessly showcase both grace and sensuality simultaneously on the big screen. People had labelled her as the spitting image of the late iconic actress, Nargis Dutt, both in terms of appearance and talent throughout her acting career.

On the personal front, Manisha Koirala tied the knot with a Nepali businessman, Samrat Dahal, in 2010. Samrat was seven years younger than Manisha, but it was never an issue for the once madly-in-love couple, who had become each other's forever in an intimate traditional wedding ceremony in Kathamandu. The couple had not even informed the media about their relationship and marriage, which is why people had labelled their wedding as an arranged marriage.

In an interaction with author-journalist, Sathya Saran, Manisha Koirala had recalled the time when she used to ask her doctors the much-dreaded question, how much time she was left with. But over the time, she had made peace with fear and death. The actress had also talked about the time when she was declared cancer-free and said:

"There was a time I would ask the doctors to give me a guarantee of how much time I have, but gradually, I made peace with fear and death. That's what taught me to make the most of all I have, and it has now become an extension of my personality. I thought I had not lived my life fully; everything was baaki. Later, I discovered that not everyone is cruel or mean. People accepted and appreciated my journey, and that gave me strength."

For the unversed, Manisha Koirala is a cancer survivor and had also penned a memoir titled, Healed: How Cancer Gave Me A New Life.
