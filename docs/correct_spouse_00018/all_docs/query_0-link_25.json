If that has happened in my current life then love should have been worshipped in the home. Don't compromise in love... you are always qualified to get better choices,\" she wrote on the social networking site.\n\nHowever, Koirala's mother Sushma claimed that the media unnecessarily blowed the minor squabble between a husband and a wife out of proportion which she think is normal.\n\n\"There might have been some minor dispute between the two which is normal in a married life but it has not reached to that extent as reported by the media.\"\n\n\"Manisha is busy with her work and is in Goa currently to attend a film festival where she has become a judge. Everything will be fine as soon as she returns home in a few days. I haven't spoken her about the matter, but so far as I understand it is not serious,\" Sushma told PTI over phone.\n\n\"It is not a big deal. I don't want to blame the media and say that it was totally false. I hope that things will move towards positive direction,\" she added.\n\nPromoted\n\nListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nAccording to a news report published in Saptahik, a Nepali weekly, Koirala remained most of the time afterthe marriagein her maternal home at Maharajgunj in the outskirts of the Kathmandu rather than her husband's house at Budhanilkantha in the Northern part of the capital.\n\nThe Dil Se star tied the knot with Samrat, seven years younger than her, in Kathmandu's Gokarna Forest Resort on June 19.\n\n."
