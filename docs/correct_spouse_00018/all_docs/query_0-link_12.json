However, the two parted ways in 2012.\n\nNow, the actress talked about the charm of having a life partner in one's life during the promotions of her upcoming Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Netflix web series Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar.\n\nIn conversation with Zoom, Manisha said, \". I definitely feel as if there was a male figure in my life, if there was a partner in my life, probably, it’ll be nice to have that.\"\n\nShe added, \"But I have to be very honest life... I am living a full life (I am not waiting for him or wasting my time on that. If it is meant to be, it will be, or else, I am content with my life).\"\n\nThe Dil Se.. actress further said, \"I have a very peaceful and loving family support. I've got a great brother and sister-in-law, great parents and good and loving friends and people.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Other than that, work is going great. I enjoy travelling; there's no financial crunch by God's grace. So, I am in a very good space. I feel complete with myself – mentally, emotionally and physically, in every way.\""
