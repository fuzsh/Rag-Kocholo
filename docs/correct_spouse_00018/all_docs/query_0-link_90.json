        "text": "Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala posted her thoughts on facebook about wanting a divorce just five months after her marriage to Samrat Dahal. The actress deleted the post a few hours later.\n\nSources close to her revealed the actress she wrote it during a \"moment\" and that it was \"silly\", reports Indian daily Mid-Day.\n\nLast Friday, the Bollywood actress wrote on Facebook that she was planning to get a divorce and hoped that the decision wouldn't hurt her parents.\n\nAlthough the actress deleted the message within a a few hours of posting that status, the post had already spread like wildfire.\n\nKoirala appeared happy after her marriage and had even spoken about wedded bliss after coming back from her honeymoon in Sievi, Finland. The actress has had a few traumatic relationships in the past."
