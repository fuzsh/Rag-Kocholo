However, she refuses to completely rule out the possibility. Oh, the suspense!\n\nBut wait, there's more! Our dear Manisha also muses about the idea of having a life partner. Despite having wonderful parents and an amazing circle of friends, she wonders if things would be even better if she had a special someone by her side. Oh, the longing for love!\n\nLet's rewind to the past, shall we? On a fateful day, June 19, 2010, Manisha Koirala took the plunge into matrimony with Samrat Dahal, a dashing Nepali businessman. The couple said their vows in a traditional ceremony in Kathmandu. Alas, their love story hit a rough patch, and just two years later, in 2012, they decided to part ways. Coincidentally, it was the same year when Manisha received her devastating ovarian cancer diagnosis. Talk about life's twists and turns!\n\nIn this exclusive interview with ETimes, Manisha spills the tea about her longing for a life partner. She ponders, \"Isn't it a little late to start a family now?\" Oh, the drama! She believes her life is already complete with her furry children, Mowgli and Simba, her adorable dog and cat. Plus, she's surrounded by an incredible support system of loving parents and amazing friends. But still, she can't help but wonder if having a life partner would add that extra sparkle to her existence. Oh, the yearning for love and companionship!\n\nBut hold on, guys, there's more gossip to chew on. Manisha also reveals her desire to embrace motherhood. She dreams of raising a child as a single mother, if only she could find the confidence to do so."
