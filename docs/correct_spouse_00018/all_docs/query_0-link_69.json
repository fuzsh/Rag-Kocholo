        "text": "The gorgeous actress, Manisha Koirala is one of the most critically acclaimed actresses of the ’90s. With movies like 1942: A Love Story, Bombay, Agni Sakshi, Gupt, Dil Se and many more, Manisha had won the hearts of millions. However, even to this very day, it’s still impossible to find an actress, who can effortlessly showcase both grace and sensuality simultaneously on the big screen. People had labelled her as the spitting image of the late iconic actress, Nargis Dutt, both in terms of appearance and talent throughout her acting career.\n\nOn the personal front, Manisha Koirala tied the knot with a Nepali businessman, Samrat Dahal, in 2010. Samrat was seven years younger than Manisha, but it was never an issue for the once madly-in-love couple, who had become each other’s forever in an intimate traditional wedding ceremony in Kathamandu. The couple had not even informed the media about their relationship and marriage, which is why people had labelled their wedding as an arranged marriage.\n\nRecommended Read: When Jaya Bachchan Was Trolled By Her ‘Bahu’, Aishwarya Rai’s Fans For Her ‘Regressive’ Mentality\n\nHowever, after some weeks of their marriage, Manisha Koirala had revealed that she had met Samrat Dahal on Facebook, and after a series of conversations, the two had fallen in love with each other. According to the actress, she had felt an amazing connection with Samrat, which was the reason they had decided to take the plunge. Everything was going smooth in Manisha Koirala and Samrat Dahal’s marital life, and her millions of fans were in joy to see their favourite actress living the best phase of her life.\n\nHowever, sadly, their marriage ended just six months after their wedding. One day, Manisha Koirala had taken to her official Facebook handle and penned a note in which she openly admitted that she had wanted a divorce from her then-husband, Samrat Dahal. In her note, Manisha had also penned a line that had sent shockwaves around the film industry. She had written:\n\n“My husband has become my enemy. How much worst can it become for a women.”\n\nDon’t Miss: When Anil Kapoor Admitted He Could Leave His Wife, Sunita For Kangana Ranaut On ‘Koffee With Karan’\n\nAfter all the speculations of the couple thinking about reconciling their differences, Manisha Koirala and Samrat Dahal had filed for divorce in 2012 and had parted ways forever. For the unversed, this was the same year when she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Manisha’s diagnosis had come as a big shock as she was at the last stage of ovarian cancer. The actress had no films to work on, and her marriage was broken. Despite all of that, Manisha had managed to beat cancer.\n\nIn an interaction with author-journalist, Sathya Saran, Manisha Koirala had recalled the time when she used to ask her doctors the much-dreaded question, how much time she was left with. But over the time, she had made peace with fear and death. The actress had also talked about the time when she was declared cancer-free and said:\n\n“There was a time I would ask the doctors to give me a guarantee of how much time I have, but gradually, I made peace with fear and death. That’s what taught me to make the most of all I have, and it has now become an extension of my personality. I thought I had not lived my life fully; everything was baaki. Later, I discovered that not everyone is cruel or mean. People accepted and appreciated my journey, and that gave me strength.”\n\nFor the unversed, Manisha Koirala is a cancer survivor and had also penned a memoir titled, Healed: How Cancer Gave Me A New Life."
