Samsung W960 is a full touchscreen phone which has a 3.2 inch capacitive touchscreen. it also has an Accelerometer sensor and Gesture control as well. according to the media sources, Samsung W960 comes with samsung’s Bada OS.\n\nthe main camera of this phone is 3.2 MP and it supports video recording. also has Samsung W960 DMB TV feature. in connectivity side Samsung W960 supports 7.2 mbps HSDPA speed. it has bluetooth but wi-fi is not available.\n\nThere are many HTC Android phones like Google Nexus one. but HTC Droid is the first phone which has their Sense UI that integrated with Android OS.
