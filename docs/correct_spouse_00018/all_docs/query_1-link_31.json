Bear with me;\n\nMy heart is in the memories, there with Sachin in the memories,\n\nAnd I must pause till it come back to me.\n\nNayagan released 25 years back yesterday and Kamal wrote a superb piece on it for The Hindu. I watched the film again after reading his piece. A few intrigues fell in place. For instance, I have had issues with killing one of the Reddys inside a car as was done in Godfather. That aside, there is no denying the films its place. Though not the greatest film made, it certainly is a special film simply because it was a first of its kind in Tamil cinema.\n\nThat the not so great production values had to be brought out by Kamal for us to notice is an achievement in itself. As a film and a screenplay, it might be inferior to Thevar Magan, the other twin from Godfather’s womb. But I won’t deny that Thevar Magan had the hindsight of Godfather and Nayagan. Kamal’s performance here could seem more wholesome than in Thevar Magan but that is because this is a biopic centered around a male protagonist.\n\nThe eye for detailing was interesting in Nayagan. A young Velu Nayakan screams thiruttu kamnaattiyaLa at a young Selva and co. Velu Nayakan, many years later, is widowed and argues with his daughter in the now cult Brutus-is-an-honorable-man-esque avangaLa nirutha sol dialogue and slips in a seth kamnaati. The widowed Velu Nayakan, still with his kids, names a child during Ganesh Chathurthi at an earlier instance. Later on, an old and forlorn Nayakan is arrested by the police and they go looking for witnesses. The same father tells the police that his son was named by Velu Nayakan. There is consistency and detailing in this. Also, it is curious how Mani took pretty much the same content to Thalapathi and turned it into a vehicle for Rajnikanth. A child wrested away from its parents which does not refuse anything anyone asks, kills a wicked guy and later learns that he has a kid and takes care of the family and the clashes between the police and the grey side seem to suggest Mani did have elements of Velu Nayakan in Surya and Karna in Velu Nayakan to turn a Varadaraja Mudaliar into the Nayakan he created on screen with Vitto Corleone contributing to the plot elements.\n\nWhat I found interesting was how Velu Nayakan is carried by his calling. He starts out a reluctant Don being forced to kill Inspector Kelkar. It is Kelkar’s son who eventually leads Nayakan to the assistant commisioner’s house (is Nasser ever named in the film?) which carries the plot further leading to Nayakan’s surrender and it is the son that kills him, presenting a case of harping back into being sucked into a chakravyuha which eventually leads to the downfall of the protagonist. The same theme has been handled in different capacities by different films. Lohithadas’s Kireedam was direct and Thevar Magan was subtle (with an extended shot of Kamal’s feet in the muck, before he chases after a culprit after which he decides to stay in Chinnathoovaloor which pretty much seals his fate, so as to suggest that Sakthi (interestingly, both protagonists are nearly namesakes) is being sucked into a vortex). Thevar Magan has more apparent similarities with Mahabharatha and I am guilty of indulging too much in the epic. But such is the nature of the beast. Velu Nayakan, like Lohi’s Sethumadhavan, takes the knife and has to live by it. Never is this more apparent than when Nayakan concedes to his rebel daughter, niruthuna sethuruven ma.\n\nIlayaraaja’s contribution to this film, as with any film in the 80s, deserves a bow. The rerecording is widely talked about, as are the songs, and deservedly so. The piece of music closest to my heart is not the Thenpaandi Seemaiyile refrain or the theme that plays for Neela, from the brothel (a small cue that grows into a counterpoint that is overwhelming), till Nayakan has lost her. It is when Nayakan is with Kelkar’s son, Ajith. That mera baba mar gaya scene is widely noted for its impact. But Raaja plays a cue in Saarangi, less than a minute long, that is wrenching, engulfing and overpowering, all at once. It plays from 7:07 till 7:53.\n\nHowever, what clinches the writing in this film is how the crown is passed on, albeit reluctantly. Velu Nayakan does not want it. He does not want his children to take over from him either. His son does, realizing his fears. His daughter does not want her son to be influenced by him. Yet, in the final frame, we see a young Velu with what can be construed as a passing-on-the-baton symbol over his neck, looking over his namesake curiously. The hero lives on.\n\nI have an amateur obsession in trying to find the Raagas of film songs. I am no expert and this is a fun hobby as far as I am concerned. This interest has however led to trying to find the roots for the names of Raagas, or rather, their etymologies. Many of them are queer and interesting and it is good fun to discuss a few with examples from films.\n\nA very interesting name is Kharaharapriya. It is supposed to be Lord Rama’s favorite. Ramayanam tells us that Rama killed two Asuras, Khara and Dhooshana, who happened to be cousin brothers of Raavana. This makes him the person who defeated Khara (Khara hara since it rhymes and not Dhooshana hara) and this rAgam being his favorite, becomes Kharaharapriya. Tamil film music has been centered over the last 5 decades around MSV, Ilayaraaja and Rahman. All 3 have had some beautiful compositions in this rAgam. Maharaajan Ulagai AaLuvAn is a song from Karnan, composed by MSV and TK Ramamurthy, which is set to this Raagam. Raaja has been the one composer though, who has handled this Raagam in the most western fashion to surprisingly fabulous returns in Maapilaikku Maman Manasu and Poo Malarndhida (okay I must gush about the flute in the first interlude. *gush*). Rahman has a beautiful Jiyajale/Nenjinile in Kharaharapriya too.\n\nThere are a few Raagas that get their names because of a particular region. Kamboji/Kambodhi could have got its name from the Kamboja region beyond Hindu Kush Mountains that Kalidasa mentions in his Raghuvamsam, Gowla could have got its name from Gowda region (Govinda Bhagavathpadar aka Gowdapaadar, Adi Sankara’s Guru, hailing from the same place which is present day Bengal), Kedaram coming from Himalayas (Kedarnath) and so on. But these are essentially Carnatic Raagas. So it is quite possible that the individuals who made these popular here hailed from these respective places. KV Mahadevan has a lovely Kamboji in Arupadai Veedu Konda from Kandan Karunai (just the first stanza here with the composer moving on a different rAgam for each stanza). Rahman has a fine Ennavale that is loosely based on Kedaram. Raaja has a lovely Kedaram too, still not 100%, in Sundari Neeyum.\n\nI would like end with a rant on my favorite rAgam, Kalyani. Like wise men have said, it is a mangaLagaramAna, i.e. an auspicious rAgam giving it its name. It is possibly the most widely used rAgam in Indian film music. But I feel no one has handled it with the depth and versatility that Raaja has. I would like to not bring a song, for there are countless Raaja himself has composed, but background sequences where he has used the rAgam to ethereal effect.\n\nThe film is Mannan and the theme between Rajni and Pandari Bai is the Amma EndrazhaikAdha song, which is based on, no prizes for guessing, Kalyani. This theme comes thrice. First, when Rajni brings Pandari Bai her wheelchair. Here, a shehnai plays a western classical Kalyani and it leads to the original song itself from the interlude, bringing the essence of the mother-son relationship. The second time, he brings it when Kushboo visits Rajni. He begins it with silence and slowly, a veena plays a gorgeous Kalyani and the theme pops up when Kushboo learns it is Rajni who takes care of his mother. The same theme expressing the mother-son love from a third person’s perspective still sounds otherworldly. It goes on for Kushboo and Pandari Bai to converse and stops as Pandari Bai is speaking and leaves the sequence to complete in silence as he had started it. A simple, clichéd scene is beautifully elevated by the background score. The third time, it is very brief, lasting 15 seconds, and is more about Rajni’s disappointment. He does not finish it fully, for the hero feels incomplete too.\n\nHowever, the piece de resistance is delivered before the climax. All the major characters are here with Kalyani. As Manorama speaks about Rajni, a flute comes in to emphasize the epitome of goodness that the hero is as the violin plays a counterpoint in the background. As Vijayasanthi accuses him, cellos with tremolos start their extension of the rAgam to signify the tension that is building up with the violins taking on the hero’s case, delightfully continuing the counterpoint. As the hero makes his point, an oboe comes in with the violin as Pandari Bai is getting cured. As Pandari Bai is cured, a veena comes in bringing a flurry of notes (a mild violin elevating it) indicating the relief and completeness she experiences over her worthy son and as she calls out Krishna, a shehnai joins in and you stand hopelessly manipulated by the music and are caught by your balls to the edge of your seat and left powerless. I don’t think any background score in Indian cinema can come close to this sequence in signifying the mother-son affection. As Pandari Bai asks for forgiveness, a quick piano traverses through the shehnai, now static on a single swaram to say that her life has been completed and a slow veena with the violin plays with cellos rising in the background to indicate an impending danger (every single, minutest emotion is conveyed and how!) and as the mother falls at her son’s feet and dies, everything stops. There is silence to let the sorrow sink in for a few seconds and he starts the charanam of Amma Endrazhaikadha and the rest of the scene is carried by the song. The lyrics and lead performances play a worthy role here. But the backbone is the music and it makes a clichéd scene a memorable, heartwarming one.\n\nKalyani just thanked Raaja there for elevating her.\n\nPS: I digress here. I came across this piece by director Suka on Ilayaraaja’s music recently and his final paragraph on a personal memory touched a chord. The song is Azhagiya Kanne. The emotion it carries across is the sentiment between a mother and her children. The year was 2006. My mother had to undergo two surgeries on her abdomen. At one point, the doctor told it was a 50-50 chance of survival. I and my sister visiting her in the ICU is one unforgettable image. She is healthy today. But this song, repeated as the mother passes away, with her children beside her, transports me to my personal space 6 years back and it invariably chokes me. I’m sure I’m not alone here. I am a guy who grew up with Rahman in the 90s, who adores both him and his music. But there is no denying that Raaja, with his music, has been able to intrude the corners of my personal space, as is true with almost all Tamils. In many ways, he has become a part of our lives.\n\nWe too owe a thank you to Raaja.\n\nMahanadi watchal happened yesterday, after what must be eons. The depth in screenplay, class in constructing scenes and elevating what is already a powerful scene is what is striking in the screenplays of Kamal in the early 90s, something that is evidently lacking in the last few years. Mahanadi falls in the former category. A lot of things might be pretty evident in the film. This post could hence be clichéd for a few, but to know if you already know what you are going to read, you would still have to read.\n\nKamal has a fascination for names. This is rather evident from the way he names his films after the protagonists. Anbe Sivam, Manmadan Ambu and Vishwaroopam (becoming redundant, yes) now are proof. In Mahanadi also he obsesses on names in his inimitable way. Right from “Krishna’s” daughter introducing herself in front of his friend’s camera; “My name is Kaveri, like the river Cauvery. My brother is Bharani, mother is Narmada and grandmother is Saraswati Ammal; we see references to rivers which are rather direct (not so in the case of Panjapakesan, who introduces himself as Punjabi; Punjab, the land of 5 rivers. He is never again called by his name, leave alone Punjabi. He is simply referred to as Iyer). We see Suganya as Yamuna and the prostitute and her daughter in Songachi as Ganga and ‘Jala’ja.\n\nThe life of the protagonist mirrors a river too by starting out adventurously (some beautifully audacious background score here), unafraid of challenges, foolishly speedy, bouncing over, eventually going down with an almighty thud and mellowing down with twists and turns. This could be a stretch but it’s easy to show the protagonist being kicked and thrashed out rather than visuals that render themselves quite fluidly for such plausibility that it might not be a stretch.\n\nWhat I find striking is after he has sketched the protagonist’s journey to reflect a river; the film gives the quintessential Indian humanness to rivers through the songs, Cauvery to be precise, calling her a woman with water as an apparel. This quite reminds one of Kalki’s portrait of Cauvery where she is in her journey to the groom’s place (sea), her arms growing multifold in delight as she nears him (a wonderfully imaginative picture of distributaries). References to rivers continue through songs from Tagore in Bengali, followed by Tamil, the former calling out to the villager to set his sails in the river and go about his life for he has wasted his time idling away so far (a precise reflection of the protagonist’s life till now).\n\nWe see Kamal’s pet theme of atheism quite apparently coupled with the irony of being asked to read Bharathi to cultivate patience who fuels Krishna’s righteous anger all the more. Kamal the script writer also paints a wonderfully deep canvas to depict human nature in a frankly realistic manner. To elucidate, Sundar, Krishna’s friend, a typically loud mouthed rich guy, mentions inappropriately about Krishna’s wife passing away and realizing that the damage has been done, tries to salvage the moment by calling Bharani a “sweet fellow”. This one sequence packs a lot, from telling us that Krishna’s wife passed away during childbirth to a little peek into the nature of people and also gives the audience a poignant moment, all in a few seconds. The poignancy is more an afterthought here. Similarly, we see Poornam Viswanathan, a character with ulcer who suffers a whole night without food in the jail telling Thalaivasal Vijay that he is to eat only once that day. These sequences don’t judge people as much as reflect what is apparent in a rather subtle way, Kamal style. Beautiful ‘moments’.\n\nIlayaraaja is in sublime form too with his background score. He conceives a wonderful score for Krishna-Yamuna’s platonic love in the jail which he repeats whenever Krishna and Yamuna are together (this scene being my favorite where a bespectacled Iyer asks Yamuna to find his glasses to make sure the unmarried couple don’t go too far) and a different yet equally lovely score for Krishna’s wife and daughter. However, he doesn’t bring the Krishna-Yamuna score but fits in Krishna’s wife-daughter score to underline that Yamuna has become a part of Krishna’s life when Krishna ironically kisses Yamuna goodbye.\n\nI think Kamal is on his own trip here and other than Raaja, he pretty much completely owns the film. The story on the exterior is like every other sad melodrama but what makes it so beautifully realistic is the handling. I just wish he writes more like this.\n\nWhat do composers do when they have a tune? Do they write it down? Do they remember it? Do they play, record it in a safe place, out of the reaches of everyone and use it when they feel it right? Or do they just use it for the film at hand instantaneously? What if a tune comes out of nowhere in the bathroom? Half the musicians anyway come from reality shows and bathrooms. There was a famous caricature in Kumudham in the early 80s where Gangai Amaran, no offence meant, was shown stealing Raaja’s tunes inside a notebook as Raaja was furiously writing them down (suggesting that Gangai Amaran’s tunes were in fact Ilayaraja’s). So what do composers do? This is one question that has always intrigued the layman in me.\n\nWhat Raaja does, I would love to know. A peek into how his brain works when he gets a tune out of thin air is in my bucketlist. What Rahman does, I think I know part of the answer. He uses (or at least did use) a few of them in his background scores and later reuses them for his songs. Roja is a universal favorite of all Rahman-tards. The soundtrack is widely acclaimed and rightly so. The rerecording is brilliant and backgroundscore does a fine job of articulating a part of the film’s score here, alongside Rahman’s other BGMs. Do read.\n\nThere is however a scene that mightily interests me. I did not discover it the first time I was watching the film. However, in the scene where Arvind Swamy comes to the village with his mother to see his would be bride (English doesn’t have a proper translation for ponnu paakaradhu!), Telephone Mani Pol plays in the background. This portion to be precise. He also repeats the same tune here as Madhoobala goes to the temple, a little slower in the tempo now, extra sangathis in the flute to give a semi-classical flavor; a mild tambura to signify sanctity, for the heroine is now in conversation with God. So this is it? The most beautiful portion in Telephone mani pol was once a part of a background score upon which he embellished orchestration and composed a song? Roja released in 1992 and Indian in 1995. So was the composer trying out a few of his songs as background scores in his first few films? Intersting!\n\nAnother film, another score. Puthiya Mugam, Rahman’s third film, had another heartwarming album. Looking for the final song, Idhu dhaan vazhkai enbatha, I discovered another minor facet to the film’s score. In the scene before the climax where Suresh Menon leaves Revathi, the background score starts with a piano playing along with a violin behind it. You get the feel of Netru Illadha Matram because of the violin and sit back to see Rahman pulling out Azhagu Nilave! I felt a rabbit was pulled out of the hat. The score extends up to Menon entering Vinith’s room and going out. The warmth in the nuclear family of husband-wife-son is beautifully conveyed through the score. The score is repeated again, after Menon’s death when Vinith goes to the room to be with Revathi, coming alongside, yes (!!) Netru Illadha Matram! Puthiya Mugam was released in 1993 and Pavithra in 1994. So this does appear to be an interesting method he followed in the early part of his career.\n\nI don’t know if Rahman tried this out after Puthiya Mugam and Pavithra but was the composer playing with an earlier background score and converting it into a song (which is fascinating) or trying out the tunes as background scores first and embellishing them inside songs later on, I will never know. However, it does offer a peak into a part of his brain and I am grateful for that.\n\nA champion leg spinner is coming over the wicket. The batsman charges, flicks the ball to the midwicket fence and in a rare display of emotion, pumps his arms in joy. A crowd of a hundred thousand goes delirious while the champion bowler applauds. Rahul Sharad Dravid’s legend was born there.\n\nOver the next few years, whenever there was a tuffmatch crying for a masterclass, Dravid was there. 115 at Nottingham, 148 at Leed’s, 233 at Adelaide, 270 at Pindi, 31 and 25 at Mumbai (considering we won by 13 runs on a minefield), 125 and 131 at The Eden again and 68 and 81 at Kingston are knocks I cherish because they give me a nostalgic trip with a lot of memories now. As much as I go weak on my knees at Dravid the player, he is also special for giving those moments of watching your team perform well in the purest format in the toughest of conditions. It was a pure joy. Here was a player who was not the most attractive batsman, never destroyed attacks and did not invent shots. He was just a technically correct, gritty batsman who would put his body before the wicket.\n\nDravid as an ODI batsman was not considered a natural in the mould of a Sehwag or a Yuvraj but Dravid the test batsman was a different beast. By being out of form in his last series, he has shown us how much we will miss him when he is out forever. Dravid the captain is also much underrated because of a World Cup failure. As a test captain, he brought us series triumphs in West Indies and England after three and a half decades. We still consider him a letdown as a captain. We are not to be blamed because he wasn’t a roaring success either but wouldn’t we be short sighted if we judged success with limited overs Cricket alone as a yardstick, considering his fair returns as a test captain?\n\nWith Dravid, one will never remember any trademark stroke as is associated with the other legends in his team. What we will remember though, is the everlasting struggle, a struggle that you and I can relate to. He was just one among us, with no real talent but went on to show that with grit, you can score centuries in all test playing nations. That you can end up successful in a format you are not cut out for. His toil was the platform upon which a middling team could rise to become the Number 1 team in the World. The least we owe him is a thank you.\n\nRewinding to 1996, one saw a young man with a V100 brand on his bat walk out on his test debut, already overshadowed by a mate who had scored a ton. Little would he, or we, realize that this would be the story of his life. He scored 95, promptly earning the sobriquet chamathu from my mother. There was immense promise and I, for some strange reason as an eight year old, started to like him. It was my formative Cricket watching days and the cream of that team which went on to represent India over the next decade and half were a part of my childhood as they were with more than half my fellow Indians. What I was to realize later was this was the best Indian team in 7 decades. A little before this gyaan, I knew that we were playing cricket for 7 decades. Starting with depressing lows in the late 90s, the team blossomed in the noughties. What remains of both the team and the childhood are only memories now. As with Dravid, Adelaide was where it reached the peak. It is ironic that Adelaide is where it should touch a trough and end. As with his career, the end also came with a struggle. His retirement or the second 4-0 in less than a year will not signal the end of life. Life has to move on. In the meantime, thank you, Rahul Dravid, for the memories.\n\nILamai ennum poongaatru is a great song for a lot of reasons. The lovely tune, the epic bass guitar (The same guitar we all (okay at least me) pronounce as boss and not base), the ethereal chorus. Yeah, it’s a cult classic.\n\nWatching the song can be very unsettling, said a friend, over chat. I know, I know, I know. Watching Ravikumar slobbering all over the figurine mass of Sridevi can be visually unsettling. But no. The song, with its Shakespearean moral dilemma of whether to do or not to do, brought out wonderfully by one Kannadasan, is indeed unsettling.\n\nI was humming the interlude (yeah, I’m a Raaja fan like that) and wait, something intrigued. Came home –> heard song again –> mind blown.\n\nFirst interlude of the song plays. The guitar and violins leave their trademark stamp as usual all over the place but are cut short by a very mellifluous flute. Humming the tune of the flute leaves you intrigued that it is the same tune that plays in the charanam. But Raaja, being the genius that he is, leaves the flute to play only a part of the charanam. And since the charanam begins almost immediately after the flute, he makes the flute play the final part of the charanam that it is hard to guess that the flute and the charanam share the same tune (from the dhega sugathil gavanam till maNNil aNayA bit, yes bit only) because the first part of the charanam distracts you from guessing so (whole song is very distracting. But that is for another day). So what is special about this? It is in the first interlude that he does this and not the second or third. Before he gives away the tune of the charanam in the charanam, he gives it off in the first interlude. Because he does this in the first interlude when we are hearing the virgin tune while the heroine loses hers, I feel it is deliberate. And it is hard to guess this unless you hum the tune for yourself. I mean, it sounds different.\n\nI think he loves playing such games. I also think he is terrific. I also wonder what lies between his two ears. That motta bastard!\n\nIt has been close to 4 months since I arrived in the US of A. Ponniyin Selvan has been my companion for 3 and half months. As they say, all good things must come to an end and so did Ponniyin Selvan. My PhD will take me a few more years and I can conclude that it is not as good a thing as this epic novel. But that’s for another day.\n\nWhere to begin? Where to end? Plot, Romance and Nature. That Kalki is a genius in conveying all of this would be an understatement. The intrigue, suspense and drama would rival any modern crime thriller. The Romance is also epic. But what takes it into the heart and makes the reading so memorable that you want more is the poetic description of nature. Kalki’s genius is out in the open, where he says Cauvery is the woman of Tamil Nadu who goes to meet her husband, the big sea, and is sent by the other women of Tamil Nadu with Sarees as porandha veettu seedhanam on Aadi Perukku and as she nears her husband, her eagerness to reach him makes her spread her arms which grow multifold to hug her beloved (distributaries of the river as it reaches the estuary). Ponni, as Cauvery is called, with the Sun’s rays on her, gives the impression of a blue Saree with golden streaks over it with the green trees on either banks forming the borders. A man with a top angle view of nature alone can bring forth such creativity into his words.\n\nKalki’s biggest victory is however, in entrenching the lead characters in your heart. Again, he uses Nature throughout the novel to help himself. He uses storms as metaphors to convey to the reader, the storm in the plot and in the lead characters’ hearts. Be it the storm leading to the climax which forms the foil to the storm brewing in the plot or the storm in the sea, he is phenomenal. One such vignette from the novel, where one of the two Heroes, Vallavarayan Vandiyathevan, is caught in a storm in the middle of the sea:\n\n“கடல் அலைகள் ஆவேச தாண்டவமாடின. மின்னல் வெளிச்சத்தில் கண்ணுக்கெட்டிய தூரம் ஆடும் மலைச் சிகரங்கள் காட்சி அளித்தன. காற்றின் கும்மாளம் உச்சத்தை அடைந்தது. ஆடும் மலைச் சிகரங்களை அப்படியே பெயர்த்து எடுத்து வாயு பகவான் வான வெளியில் விசிறி எறிந்து விளையாடினார். வந்தியத்தேவனுடைய கப்பல்மீதும் அந்த நீர்மலைகளில் சில வந்து மோதின. வானத்தைக் கீறிக் கொண்டு ஒரு மின்னல் மின்னியது. அதன் பிரகாசம் அவன் கண்ணெதிரே நூறு சூரியனைக் கொண்டுவந்து நிறுத்தியது போலிருந்தது. தன் கண்களையே அம்மின்னல் பறித்துவிட்டதோ என்று வந்தியத்தேவன் அஞ்சினான். எரிச்சல் எடுத்த கணத்திலேயே அவன் செவிகளுக்கும் ஆபத்து வந்துவிட்டது. எத்தனையோ இடி முழக்கங்களை வந்தியத்தேவன் முன்னம் கேட்டிருக்கிறான்; இன்றைக்கும் எத்தனையோ கேட்டான். ஆனால் இப்போது இடித்த இடியைப் போல் – சே! அது இடியா? இந்திரனுடைய வஜ்ராயுதம் அவனுடைய காதின் வழியாகப் பிரவேசித்து மண்டைக்குள்ளேயே நுழைந்து தாக்கியது போலிருந்தது.\n\nசற்று நேரம் வந்தியத்தேவன் கண்களையும் திறக்க முடியவில்லை; காதிலோ ‘ஓய்’ என்ற சப்தம் கேட்டுக்கொண்டிருந்தது.\n\nமூடியிருந்த கண்கள் ஏதோ சமீபத்தில் தலைக்கு மேலே புதிய வெளிச்சம் பரவியிருப்பதை உணர்ந்தான். காதிலும் ‘ஓய்’ சத்தத்துக்கு மத்தியில் வேறொரு விநோத சப்தம் கேட்டது. காட்டில் தீப்பற்றி எரியும்போது, மரங்களில் தீப்பிடிக்கும்போது, உண்டாகும் சப்தத்தைப் போல் தொனித்தது.\n\nவந்தியத்தேவன் கண்ணைத் திறந்து பார்த்தான். அவன் இருந்த கப்பலின் பாய்மரம் உச்சியில் தீப்பற்றி எரிவதைக் கண்டான்.\n\nவந்தியத்தேவனுக்கு அப்போதும் சிறிதும் மனக்கிலேசம் உண்டாகவில்லை. உற்சாகந்தான் மிகுந்தது கலகலவென்று சிரித்தான்.”\n\nAnd I was reminded of this:\n\nDeep down, somewhere towards the end, you want to become like Vandiyathevan. Kalki, has won you there.\n\nI happened to randomly find out yesterday that the song Sundari Kannal Oru Seidhi, has 2 ragas, Kalyani, as we all know, and Kosalam.\n\nThe pallavi begins with two love lorn lovers marrying. Kalyani seems to be an ideal Ragam for the happiness that is around and it begins with exquisite orchestration as Rajini picks up Shobana, kattifies the thaali and celebrates the Santhi Muhurtham. They then separate. Nayagan goes for war. Nayagi is alone. It is pangs of separation for both and an added burden of war for the Hero. Kosalam makes a grand entry in the interlude presenting all its seriousness with a grander orchestration. Then as the Hero finds external peace in between the war, her thoughts come back to touch him and he parries her questions. She asks him if he loves her and if her love is a mirage. He tells her to ask the moon to know about his pain. To explain this weird fusion of the joy, on being able to speak with each other, albeit through thoughts, and the pain of separation at the same time, Raaja brings in both Kalyani and Kosalam in the charanam. Hence the charanam sounds both joyful and melancholic at the same time. The beauty is Kalyani and Kosalam differ in just one swaram. Kalyani has R2 while Kosalam has R3 in their respective Rishabams. War again, Kosalam again and separation till he reaches her. In the second charanam, they talk about the joy of being together and the pain of being separated after having resolved their “oodal”. Kalyani and Kosalam together as metaphors again. He finally reaches her, it is pallavi and it is only Kalyani now for they are both in joy and the pain of separation is over.\n\nHowever, what was extremely interesting was when the first charanam gets over (they are still separated mind you) and the pallavi comes with Kalyani, Rajini and Shobana come together in their dreams. This song is itself a dream. A dream within a dream (to get them together, bring the joy and justify the usage of Kalyani).\n\nWhat do I say?\n\nHowever, what I find funny is, when Rajini and Shobana actually separate for real and forever in the film, the BGM goes “Naan unnai neenga maatten…Sundari Kannal Oru Seidhi” and it is only Kalyani here. And the Kalyani does create a lump in your throat. It did, at least for me. And ironically, it is “Naan unnai neenga maatten” he chooses to begin it with when they are actually separating, so as to suggest that the separation is only physical. Again, what to say?\n\nNow there are 2 versions to it. First when they separate, the violins come out in all glory and when it goes Sundari, it stops for a microsecond and the flute takes over for Kannal oru seidhi and that microsecond pause brings out the pain in its entirety with the perennially present sun present here too behind the hero Surya (“Suryaputran” to be more precise) looking on while setting to bring forth the darkness. The next version is when Rajini meets Shobana outside the house in the dark and here, it is only the violin this time because there is no new pain but for the leftover memories and the Kalyani again provides the lump in the throat, and they come near each other this time, though they remain separated.\n\nWho do I praise here? Mani? Rajini-Shobana? SPB-S Janaki? Vaali? Or Raaja? Ada pongada. This, at least for me, is proof that when a bunch of inspired geniuses come together, even a run-of-the-mill-lovers-separate sequence can be made to look poetic.\n\nOne of the many instances where life is suggesting what hidden gems are still left unearthed and proves to me #WhyRaajaIsGod\n\nWarning: Containing spoilers, this review is as bad as the film.\n\nThe director had done a ctrl c ctrl v of an English film earlier which he ctrl ved in Hindi. He now thinks he must make something original for Tamil. So he takes his pen out, brings Vijay TV’s Nijam Nadandadu Enna Voice over and introduces to us about the long lost glory of Tamil culture and some Bodhi Dharman. And the Chinese sing a Tamil song in Babablacksheep tune. Check.\n\nPresent day and we have Baby Grand (Grand is the nickname of Kamal Hassan who speaks every language including American English with a grand American accent. Also, he is a grand actor) asking the hero for a monkey to do genetic research with a beautiful oh-so-louly-tambrahm accent. Must tell the director that monkey research is banned in India (monkey being Aanjaneyar, etc, etc). But I will not because I am a proud Tamil and also, a geneticist. Check.\n\nNow this Baby Grand and the hero go on elephants on Adyar Bridge, sing Chinese Tamil songs with American accents in Europe with African extras composed by Harris Jayaraj. Globalization of Tamil. Check. Now she wants to use the hero to do genetic experiments. Ethical clearance anyone? No questions because this is a film on Tamil culture. She goes to a room to talk about her project to world famous Indian scientists who are 50+, talk about their lives’ works in one sentence, are from Ulundurpettai and speak English and mock Tamil culture. Baby grand from Paramakudi launches into a tirade on why the Tamil is the glorious, speaking Tamil in an American accent. Another grand in the making. Check.\n\nShe wants to use the hero to bring back whoever is his ancestor, with the DNA, in the hero. Must ask prof if this really works. If so, must take DNA from Murugadoss and see if it matches with the DNA of any filmmaker. If so, must bring back filmmaking talent. Bleddy around ears heavy jasmine smell raa. But I will not question because jasmine is also part of Tamil culture. Check.\n\nThis Dong Lee is a Chinki villain speaking English with an Indian accent in China. More globalization of the cinematazation of the constitution of the constipation. He causes crisis to Indian economy with baby grand’s prof. So Surudhi goes to prof’s house, hacks into prof’s gmail account and unearths mollamaarithanam of 300 crores of transaction of single wire transfer into Swiss account. Using monkeys in India, genetic testing without ethical clearance, hacking other’s accounts. Crime rate increasingly grandly. But no questions because she is pro-Tamil culture. Check. The Dong uses dog to cause disease. Seriyana bong pa. And baby grand asks him if he has yellow rice in the chest to meet this Bodhi Karman face to face and how dare he cause harm to the great India of the Aryabhatta, Pallavas, TR, Sam Anderson, Perarasu and Digvijay Singh. Yabba.\n\nSo finally she takes our hero, puts him in a box with Discovery channel deep sea diving material for 12 days in an ultra secretive place where they have no contact with the outer world in IIT Madras. So the take home message is that the most vetty place in Chennai with no scent of human activity is IIT. Mr. Director, I want to know the funding for baby grand’s research. And in the midst of all this mumbo-jumbo being passed as logic and science, the hero becomes Bodhi Dharman. Enna karumam da saami!\n\nThe film’s concept is good, it tries something different, first 20 minutes are well filmed and the reference to Gounder was the only LOL worthy moment in the film. Thasall that’s there to this film. Murugadoss, making a film on Tamil culture, science and DNA and all is ok. But next time, if it is about science, include something called research and if it is a film, screenplay. Thanks.\n\nPS: Does the title or this rant make sense? No, neither does the film."
