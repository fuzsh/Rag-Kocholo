Indra Prakash, New Delhi ■ The memoirs of Morarji published in your maga/ine were a welcome change after the numerous gushy, insince- re obits that appeared in the piint media.

Actually, if the man thought beating children was the only effective way of control- ling them, then it is only natu- ral that he would think of such a solution for the nation too! It made me laugh to lead about how cleverly he got around the controversial interview he had given to Mr Sanghv i. At the same time, it gave me a glimpse of how this man must have function- ed when he occupied the highest office in the land — he must have led Ins men a merry dance indeed People i)f my generation have aivva> s heard a lot about Morarji and his many w'hims His attempt to enfor- ce prohibition, his rigidity regarding sexual matters, his moie-Gandhian-than-Gandh- i allitude — we had heartl ol all this, and it had made him seem a strange but colourlul figure SfNDA'i deserves thanks lor bringing the man alive for us Rachna Shvastava, Indore (Madhya Pradesh) One land, one law T lie Shiv Sena and the BJP leaders are voicing stri- dent views on the minorities {Cimrliny trouble, 16 — 22 April). Though the Shiv Sena supremo, Bal Thackeray, might appear to be strongly anti-Mushm, he does have some valid points to make. The Muslim population in India is growing in leaps and bounds, though Syed Shaha- buddin may deny this Indian Muslims still have their own Personal Law and the Koran permits multiple marriages and encourages the prwcrealion of children. Muslims insist on following these tenets, even if it means doom for India with its already large ptipulalion Morarji Desai: there was more to the man than we’d Why can't there be one uni- foriTi civil code for cveryb dy residing in this count No otherminority com» nity in India is so violent ui its actions and so vociferous in its demands. If they caiv not adapt to India's laws, it h better that they seek other pastures. Dr U.S. Iyer, Bangalore (Karnataka) Bal Thackeray: stirring strong sentiments Inching along C hakmas living in Mi/.o- ram should be grateful to the Mizo community as a whole and to Mizo leaders part icular for being allowe lo settle in this state in spite of bei ng outsiders {7 he divid^ ing line, 16 — 22 April). Nearly 50 per cent of the Chakmas in Mizoram are likely to find their names struck off when the new elec- toral roll IS published simply because they are illegal infil- trators. And it is not the state joint chief electoral officer who declared 26 January, 1 950 as the cut-off date for the identi fication of fore- - igners; il is the Constitution of India (Article five, to be exact), that says so. When S.P Dewan claim- ed that his tribesmen have been living in Mizoram 4 SUNDAY/ l3Maylil9S >ince before 1 898, he should also have mentioned that ^ ':it^{ikmas were allowed to in these areas on condi- U4j'im that they obtained valid permission from the concern- ed village chiefs and paid higher taxes to the Mizoram govenimem than Mi/os themselves. It was only much later that they were thoughtlessly giv- en autonomous districts of their own by avaricious Mizo leaders. The result — they are now demanding their own Union Territory, U> be carved out of Mizoram! Well, It is no sin to ask for the moon, but their dream will never come true. HanJhA Te Chhung, Kapurthaia (Punjab) What grievances? I n his article The Bombay hashers (16 — 22 April), Vir Sanghvi says Indian Muslims have thousands of genuine grievances. It would be nice if he could give us an exact list of these grievan- ces. It would also be nice if he could narrate what steps have been taken to resolve these grievances. He says, ’'In the aftermath of Vodhya, liberal Muslims hented that they had let c nutcases take over. ' I am afraid he is unaware of the history of India. That hisioi^ shows that liberal Muslims have never taken up the cause of resolving the thou- sands of genuine grievances that Indian Muslims have. They are of the view that issues related to Muslims should be handled within the context of their religion. The controversy surrounding Taslima Nasreen and the Muslim community’s reac- tion to it is the latest in the long line of such issues, and proves my point once more.

It seems to suggest that the 16lh Rashtriya Rifles resorted to indiscriminate fir- ing only after provocation by guerrillas. What actually happened was that a mere tyre-burst in the area was suf- ficient to send the jawans into a panic, causing them to open fire on innocent civili- ans, killing eight persons — including two policemen — and grievously injuring seve- ral others. I think your reporter, San- tanu Ghosh, should visit the region and ascertain for him- self the real facts about the event.

I agree with MrChibber's comment that this trend will increase the division bet- ween haves and have-nots, but not with his prediction that it will ensure enhance- ment of quality. Also, we must keep in mind that the only reason haves, and have- nots have co-existed in this country is the basic Indian attitude of being fatalistic and meekly accepting our destined lot. An increasingly ostentatious display of weal- th may well bring about a change in such philosophy, and pave the way for a civil war. To avoid such upheavals, the nouveau riche must restrain themselves in their spending spree and everyone should think of constructive ways to improve the lot of the common man. Kriahan Kaira, NawDalhl Aploasuroto behold A mita Malik’s article on Pakistani teleplays ( The play’s the thing ,16 — 22 April) was very timely because now viewers all over India can enjoy FTV thanks to a transponder made available by Asiasat t . Without a doubt, the piece-de-resistance of the PTV continues to be the , superb Pakistani teleplays. 1 feel the reason for their popularity lies in their ability to emote, and rich thematic value, as opposed to the kJiatiyas and cholis that reign supreme on our popula- rity charts and yet evoke none of the admiration that these plays do.

Mrfl A 8 2418 COUNTERPOINT There is nothing quite as nauseating as the spectacle of Sadhvi Rithamba- ra claiming to speak for Hindus. Last week, she tur- ned up in Indore where a Catholic nun. Rani Maria, had been murdered on 25 February. One of those accused of the murder was a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader. In mid-April, a memorial erected at the spot w'herc the nun had been killed 'was vandalised and a glass enclosure contain- ing her picture was destroyed. It fell to j the Sadhvi to speak up on behalf of the majority community. \"Mother Teresa is a magician.\" she said. \"F'.en if a single Hindu is con- i verted, ihe Christians will be wiped out.\" And so on. The government of Digvijay Singh moved swiftly to try and control pas- | sions and placed ihe Sadhvi under arrest, I but there was an uproar anyway. BJP I activists look to the streets. There were incidents of rioting and violence. Six BJP corporators from Indore were anest- ed for participating in the mayhem. And Surendra Verma, a sitting BJP MLA, was taken into custody while leading a protest. It is not my case that we must hold all of th^BJP responsible for everything that this appalling woman says or does. Every party has its share of crackpots, maniacs and lunatics, and perhaps, one could argue in the BJP's defence that its only crime is that it attracts psychopaths just as a bowl of rasgollas attracts flies. My point is different. When people defend the BJP, they argue that there are innumerable parties that claim to repres- ent Muslims. Why do we single out the BJP for criticism? Is it only because it says that it represents Hindus? I am not a BJP supporter but I can see the merit»in the argument. Certainly, it is wrong to claim as many of us do in the name of secularism that the Hindus have no right to organise themselves political- ly. You and I may not wish to join an organisation that has a religious basis but we cannot deny others the right to do .so. The problem is that the BJP' s defen- ders misunderstand the nature of Hin- duism. Not only is it the world*s oldest ' religion, but it has survived the Buddhist and Jain reformations, centuries of i VIR SANGHVI Rithambara and freedom of choice ( iinl ihv HJi* disown (his iipiniHin^ winnnn? Muslim dominance, the Raj, and even, the Hindu Mahasabha because it has taught us to believe in ourselves. Hindu pride is not dependent on having to con- vert others. Wc are what we are because we have the strength to be tolerant of difference. Unfortunately, a section of the HJP and of the panvar hopes to come to power by exploiting di (Terence It hopes to make Hindus insecure and it strives to whip up passions against other communities In the case of Hindu-Muslim tension, It has history on its side. Whatever we secularists may now say, there is little d{>ubt that Hindus were second-class citi/ens during the Muslim period Ol course, it is foolish and pointless to try and extract revenge troin today’s Indian Muslim. But one can see how sections of the siin^h panvar cim focus attentitin on these historical injustices to generate ill- feeling Hut what viboiii the Christians ' What is the justification lor calling Mother Teresa names ' Are we so proud of the way w^e treat people at the bottom of the social ladder that we must thiealen to wipe out the entire Christian comnui nity if a single poor Hindu is converted? T he short answer is that there is no justification foi such a stand. Some or us may not approve of conversions just as Olliers may not appiove ol a party that fla- mes Its appeal in religious :erms. But we do not have Ihe right to prevent jieople from converting And we do not have the right to object to the existence of the BJP. Unfortunately, the BJP itself does not seem to recognise this fundamental liuth. It rails against secularists who object to Its existence and its policies (.in the grounds that they are denying tree dom of choice to Hindus. But at the same time, many of its members threat- en to wipe out other Hindus who exerci- se freedom of choice in a mannei that the sangh parivar finds unacceptable. I think it is fair to say that most readers of Sunday are as revolted by Sadhvi Rithambara as I am. So, I will not waste your time by attacking her. What worr- ies me is that so few people in the BJP are willing to get up and disown this dreadful woman, 1 have yet to read a sin gle statement from any BJP leader of consequence that is at ail condemnatory of her recent behaviour. Worst still, the party’s Madhya Pradesh unit is actively backing her. j Members of ihe /)c/r/w,/*have used viol- ence to protest her release and elected members of municipal corporations and the state Assembly have participated in the agitation I cannot think of a single argument in defence of this sort of behaviour. The BJP accuses th(>sc who do not agree with it of being piejudiced against Hin- dus ano ol being ashamed of Hinduism 1\\) that, there is only one possible retort: is what Sadhvi Rithambara is doing, a part of the Hindu tiadition? And by backing her with agitations isn't a sec- tion of the BJP creating a situation m which every Hindu will be ashamed of this brand of Hinduism ' It may well be that we seculari.sts It is now possible that the BJP will emerge as a significant force at the next general election. But if LK.Advani wishes to rule us, then he must make it clear that his BJP can divorce itself from the fascist core of many of its parivarmmbm have gone too far in the other direction in our attempt to make the Muslim mino- rity feel secure. In the aftermath of the Hindu backlash of the late 19S0s and the early 199()s, most of us have sat and rethought the nature of Indian secularism But what about (he BJP? Has ii rethought its basic policies after the Ayo dhya demolition and the violence that followed? Is It at all concerned that it has become a flag of convenience for loath- some fa.scists, communal crackjiots and evil women such as the Sadhvi - people who will misuse the BJP plai- form to spread anger and hatred And who will sully the name of Hinduism w hile pretending to protect its honoui . It is now possible that the BJP will emerge as a significant force at the next general election Mr Advani has told us that the men w'ho destroyed the Bahri Masjid were acting spontaneously and without his knowledge. The first part of that statement is a he, but wc must give him the benefit ol the doubt on the second part. But if Mr Advam wishes to rule us. then he must make it clear that his BJP can divorce itself from the fascist core of many of' its parivar members. On 6 December 1992, he failed to demonstra- te this. And judging b\\ the manner in which his parly is supporting this demen- ted W'oman and her puke-inducing attitu- des, it looks as though he has just failed the test again. • SUNDAY 7- <14 May 1995 9 POINT OF Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalitha makes one false move after another in her fight against Governor Channa Reddy O n 26 April, sonicliinc in the afternoon, President Shankar Dayal Sharma’s secretariat received a fax message. It w'as from M. Channa Reddy, the Governor of Tamil Nadu. And the contents were near-hysterical. That morning, the Tamil Nadu Assembly had passed a resolution ask- ing for Reddy’s recall. Last month, he had given permission to Subramaniam Swamy to prosecute .layalalitha on 38 charges of corruption. Now , she w anted him out. She alleged in the Assembly that when she had called on Reddy at Raj Bhavan in August 19^3, he had \"misbe- haved\" with her and had used \"uncouth\" language to insult her. After she made this statement, the resolution for the recall was put to vote. (Tingress and DMK legislators walked out before this, but the resolution was passed anyhow. It was this that had got Reddy all worked up. In Madras, he refused to take press calls but the Raj Bhavan put out a terse statement that read, \"It is an absurd lie and it is below my dignity to react to It \" In the fax to the Presi- dent, however, he was far from being circumspect. He urged that Sharma take action. He also warn- ed that if the Centre did not act, Tamil Nadu would secede. Clearly, he was making out a case for the dismissal of the Tamil Nadu government. The President telephoned the Pnine Minister and they had an unscheduled meeting at 6. 1 5 pm The fax was shown. While it is not known what the President said, Narasimha Rao was ol the view that Assembly resolutions lor recall of Governors ought not to become the basis for dismissing them. He added that this would set a prece- dent for other state Assemblies. At that time, the Tripura As.sembly resolution for the recall of Romesh Bhandan had still not come, and when it did, it only strengthened Narasimha Rao's argument. Narasimha Rao then closed the meet- ing with the President, saying it waiuld be unwise to take any hasty steps. Reddy remained. Nor had Jayalalitha gone. But in Madras, facing its hottest week of the summer yet, the political tempera- ture was going way up And it didn’t look as though die Jayalalitha- Channa Reddy (left) and Jayalalltl Reddy-Swamy triangular contest would see a quick cud. J ust now though, Jayalalitha is not in a very strtmg position. One day after the recall resolution was passed, the Tamil Nadu High Court dismissed her plea against the Governor’s order to give sanction to prosecute her. A Divi- sion Bench of Justices M. Srinivasan and S.S. Subramani held that it was the \"exclusive di.scrction\" of the Governor to do what he had done. In her petition, she had also referred to a Supreme Court judgement on a case relating to the state of Maharashtra Ver- sus R.S. Nayak and had argued contrary to its ruling. The Division Bench took exception to this. In the ruling, it noted, \"It is certainly not open to any petitioner, however high his or her position may be, to canvass the correctness of a judgement of the Supre- me Court and that too in an affidavit,\" At the time of going to press, Jaya was planning to move a special leave peti- Naraslmha Rao: backing Roddy to the hilt? 10 SUNDAY May IMS is year’s Republic Day function: not on talking terms fion in the vSuprenie C(>url. Hlsewhcrc, wSwamy was honing his case to be filed against her. And the (iovernor, mean- while, was stepping up his anli- Jayalalitha aciivity. J ayalalitha says that (\"hanna Reddy was sent to stir up trouble lor her. She .says that the Union home minister called to tell her of the appoinimeni, and that her views weren't taken. She apf)ealed to the Prime Minister against Reddy, .she says, but he told her he was a good administrator. If he really was that, he made no attem- pt to hide it. On the day he an ived to take over as Governor, Reddy criticised the state’s law and order situation. Then slowly their differences grew. In July 1993, she went on an impromp- tu fast on the Cauvery water dispute, sur- prising and upsetting Reddy, just fresh to his job. There was the AIADMK- engineered violence and Reddy ordered the administration to act. Jayalalitha did- n’t like this at all. Jayalalitha is not in a very strong position. A day after the recall resolution was passed, the Tamil Madu High Court dismissed her plea against the Governor’s order to give sanction to prosecute her After this, the DMK alleged poll rigg- ing in the Ranipei Assembly by- el eel ion. Then the RSS headquarters in Madras was bombed Jayalalitha was away electioneering. Reddy pulled up the administration for slackness and not informing him in lime. All this he pul m a report to the Centres on the deteriorating law and order situa- tion. Rajesh Pilot flew in to investigate. Jayalalitha was terrified. Ihen, Reddy sal on bureaucratic appointmenis and extensi nis. Jayalali- Iha retaliated. An attempt was made to deny Reddy his constitutional right of addressing the Assembly in its first ses- sion in 1994. Reddy refused to give a day for the stale Budget, and won his way to speak in the Assembly. There, he kept calling the slate government \"this government\" and not \"my government\" as is the norm. Then he tried to scuttle the World Tamil Conference which Jayalalitha w'as utilising to build up her image. The story is that Reddy asked Narasimha Rao and President Shanna not to attend it but that the PM, first agreeing to the request, did finally turn up for it. While in Delhi, Reddy spoke against Jayalalitha. When it ggi reported, she asked for his recall. That was the first time she did this. Then events gathered pace. Subramaniam vSwamy’s plea for the Govenior’s sanction to pro.secute Jayalalitha liad been I>’ing with Reddy SUNDAY 7-1 3 M(ty19Q5 11 lor 17 rTioiilhs. On 25 March, he asked his secret an at to gel it out foi him And on I April, he ga\\e Swamy permission to prosecute Jayalahlha. And all hell l>ioke loose. S wamy has chaiged her with 38 eases ol CO? nipt ion and has the most evid- ence m two of them The first conceins purchase ol 1,29.6(K) sqdt of prime indusinal land from the Tamil Nadu Small Intlusliies C3^rporalion for Ks 1 .82 ciore while its real worth is Rs 4.42 crore, 'Fhe land was for Jay a Publica- tions where Jayalahtha is partner with hei friend, N.

The company, Alagendran Rrothers, was allegedly favoured Swamy has produced official notings against the ileal There j.re many w ho say it js an open- and shill case, and often Jayalalitha’s extreme leactions against both Reddy and Swamy seem to confirm this, l.asl lorlnight, for instance, Swamy referred to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Jielam as international \"pariahs”, a word that lias a negative connotation in Tamil. Jayalahlha had the police aftei Swamy. She wanted him locked up for at least three days. Swamy, apparently, dyed his hair and got to Madras airport on an auionckshaw. When the admi nistration asked the aiiport authorities li give him up, they asked for permission from the Centre. 1’he incident with Redd> was greatly more serious On lO April, A I ADM K goons stoned his motorcade in Tindiva- nain in South Arcol district In the past fortnight, demonstrations have been organised against Reddy.

Opposition leaders belong- ing to the DMK, PMK and MDMK have visited Raj Bhavan and have been w arm- ly received by Channa Reddy \"While the Constitution wants Go\\ ci- nors to function with the aid and advice of the council of ministers,\" said V.R.

But others resent the idea and the differences seem to be growing. Despite protests by the DMK, NF chairman N.T. Rama Rao (NTR) said at a press conference last fort- night that the AlADMK was free to join the alliance. The day before, Murasoli Maran of the DMK, the AIADMK’s arch-rival in Tamil Nadu, had said, **The DMK and the AlADMK cannot coexist in the from,\" But NTR <*ose to ignore him. The Left Front, too, is set to block the AIADMK’s entry. In lamil Nadu, it has a lie-up wdth V. Gopala- samy’s MDMK and is unwilling to upset that arrangement. When Bom- mai first mooted the idea of letting Mt1^Vbm909$nmmeonn9eUon Jayalahtha in, CPI(M) general secre- tary Harkishen Singh Surjeet llatly said no. \"If the AlADMK is taken into the front, weTl consider severing links with them (National Front),\" said Singh later, expressing resentment. Then, when NTR went ahead and told the press that the NF was amena- ble to JayalaSitha's inclusion, Singh was disgusted, \"It is their problem,\" he told Sunday. \"I have said what- ever 1 have to say. I have nothing more to add.\" However, Janata Dal leader Sba- rad Yadav tried to ^>ring down the heat. \"Wc will take a decision only after consulting all partners of the NF- LF,\" he said. \"We are an alliance and there is no question of taking unilate- ral decisions.\" What bothered several NF^LF leaders is that NTR hadn’t cared to find out if Jayalalitha was pt^red Ao fight the Bharatiya Janata Pmy as well white exposing the Congim, The NF-LF alliance is comimited to 8UNDAY7»-13May1M6 tacommonfo* fighting both the Congress and the BJP ”I don't know.

The book. Selling of the President, on the 1968 and 1972 presi- dential campaigns showed how Richard Nixon’s image was manipulated by hi.s media managers to make him visually appealing. Still later, Ronald Reagan was the master of the soundbite. No one seemed to bother about the failed star’s fading memory so long as he could come up with a string of catchy one- liners. And if Bill Clinton scored in 1992, it was as much due to the health of the American economy as it was because of the lad from Hope’s ability to project a youthful look to the nation. Mercifully, Indian politicians have still a long way to go before they run elec- tion campaigns on television screens. I'hey still have to trudge along on padavairas amidst the heat and dust of the countryside to reach out to thte voter. Not for them, the luxury of nationwide televised debates or the ersatz glamour of party conventions It is still probably the interview given to the local paper in Raipur that will make or break the cam- paign of a candidate in Chhatisgarh. Television, (o that extent, has still not become a participant in India's great democratic experiment. But for how long? Seven months in the electronic medium have convinced me that television is the best ego massa- ge our politicians have ever had And even if the camera never lies, politicians can. Indeed, few can match the histno- nics of our netas once the camera is switched on. Train the lights on them, and even the most reticent are transform ed into showmen. And why not, one might ask? If film stars can opt for car- eers in politics, why can't the reverse occur, if only in the guise of small screen stars? Maybe then it’s time to see how our politicians rate on the tube. NX RAMA RAO: Perhaps his self-image is still trapped in one of his innumerable mythological roles, but NTR is easily the most temperamental of intervie- wees. Oft a good day, he will start off by saying, ’’Before we begin, let me bless all my viewers.” On an off day, he will just shun Everyone. Unfortunately, his myriad illnesses have left him sounding incoherent at most times. One statutory' warning though: never begin an NTR interview with a question on Lakshmi Parvathi. SHARAD PAWAR: Is a real pro. Will tuck the lapel mike into his shirt all by himself and will always ask you, ’’Are we rolling now?” Once the camera is rol- ling, his answers are much more measu- red. The problem is that now that Pawar wants to give interviews, no one wants to interview him. Out of power, out of sight. BAL THACKERAY: Is always good for a I quote, whether in power or not. Has a habit of warning you before the inter- vic^v that nothing he says should be edited. Also, has a habit of thrusting the middle-finger of his right hand to empha- si.se a point. Our contemporary godfather-tumed-godman also chooses to play with his rudrakshamala while answering questions. LALOO PRASAD YADAV: The original Bihari babu, he is not justabetter politici- an but even a better actor than Shotgun Sinha. Will regale the viewer with a scr- ies of one-liners ^my own favourite is a recent comment: ''Congress aur BJP music lagarahe hai, aur beech main Seshan dance kar raha hai\"). Can play any role, though is at his best as the cowherd who retains his roots. LK. ADVANI: K is just possible that in RSS shakhasy they don’t just teach Hin- dutva lessons, but also train you for tele- vision. With his benign looks and autho- ritative voice, Advaniji would have made an excellent anchorperson. But cir- cumstances have made him the villain of the secular constituency. It’s a bit like A.K. Hangal being pursued into playing the role of an Amrish Puri. HARKiSNEN SINGH SURIEET: If the BJP-types are made for television, then onrdesi communists are certainly not. Lefties have always made a virtue of shabbincss, and Surjcct is no diffeient. Somehow,' the unshaven, jholawala image is ill-suited for television. And, reading out the communist manifesto •UNDAV7^-l3Miyim COLLAGE SUBJNDAS hardly makes for gripping news. ever decided to make a career switch.

TIWAM: Would put all the Dadajis the cut and thrust of television sound- of the bijg screen out of business if he biles. Has an uncanny knack'of pausing seemingly interminably between senten- ces. This, coupled with his self- righteousness, makes television allergic to VP. RANGARAJAN KUMARAMANGALAM: Is having the time of his life giving inter- views to all and sundry, including fore- ign television networks. Has that mis- chievous gleam on his face and has the knack of saying that he is moving a cut motion and also not moving it in the same interview. RAIESH PILOT AND KAMAL NATH: Both these ministers would love to be in Kumaramangalam’s shoes. Pilot is ready to be interviewed on almost any subject you care to ask him on, from details about a police firing in AgartaJa to the price of vegetables in Cochin. Kamal Nath, too, would claim to be an all-rounder, only in the environment ministry he seems to be forced to answer questions on the Montreal Protocol and lead-free petrol. A.K. ANTONY: Is just the polar opposite of the Nath-Pilot duo. Even when it see- med certain that Antony would become chief minister of Kerala, he preferred not to make any on-record comments. Such modesty is rather unbecoming of Indian politicians renowned for their garrulousness. KALPNATH RAI: Perhaps. Antony needs to leani a lesson or two from the master politician. Rai, will, of couise, go down in television folklore for his ''Raji\\' Gan- dhi is like a diamond\" quote. But equal- ly, his genuinely bad manners means that he will make all kinds of nasal sounds and finger movements even when the camera is rolling. And, he also knows how to remain in spotlight — for example, sit next to the finance minister when the budget speech is being read out. But Mr Rai is not alone. Most politici- ans are now scrambling to get their faces flashed across the nation. A few days ago, a senior politician, who shall go unnamed, wanted to peek through the camera to see hLs recorded interview. Seeing the pictures, he blurted, \"But that’s not how I look*\" Well, now you know why they call Baird’s invention \"the idiot box\". • (The writer is with New Delhi Television and was a roving correspondent with the Ananda Bazar Patfika group) MANI SHANKAR AIYAR CLEAN ELECTIONS AND THECEC All ot US like to boast about our selves, but where most of us would be satisfied blow ing into a small ban sun til self praise, oui chief election commis sioner (ChC) reaches for his loudest trumpet the minute a microphone hoves into view This is not merely his most endeanng personal characteristic, it is also the sour ce ol his charisma So persuaded is he of his own virtues that he carries convic tion when Celling the teeming millions of It So It IS with the recent elections to the state Assembly of Maharashtra Almost in awe of his own achievement, he tells of how 85 per cent of the male elector^ te, and a sliver over 85 per cent of the female electorate, went to the polls with out lear or favo.ur to exercise their fran chise in the freest, cleanest, noblest elec non Maharashtra has evei seen The media are not behind hand in sing ing ‘Hallelujah’ to his every hosanna to himself never before have the walls of Mafiarashtra been less defaced with post ers never before have the loudspeakers gone dead at the stroke ot 10 pm, nevei before have carcadcs carrying Candida tes been so strictly restncied to three apiece, never before has the hand that hands out the lolly been so parsimonious There is one catch though Never before has Maharashtra been handed over to a self-confessed admirer of Reality or illusion ?

The future of our democracy docs not depend on the cnviionmental values of Lutyens’ Delhi — wiiitc-washed walls and hushed silence at bed time being imposed foi three campaign weeks on the raucous noises of everyday life in mofussil and village and slum India. There is not a wall — public or pri- vate in Kumbakonam or Mayiladutu- rai that is not plastered with posters every day of the week, every month oi' the year, all through the years from elec- tion to election. Posters are to that part of India which lies outside the Pandara Road residence of our CEC what the ‘Today’s Engage- ments’ columns are to Seshan’s neigh- bours. They are the accepted means of communication about local events. No our mandi towns (which, in any case, never sleep at night) should be hailed as a eritieal eontribution to dean elections, remains a little unclear to me. .Seshan seems to think more decorum means better elections. I have lived a dis- proportionate part of my life in decorous democracies outside India. So decorous that in no election in this ccntuiy have anything like the same proportion of Bri- tish or Americans, C'anadians or French- men, Germans or Japanese, exercised their franchise as the propoHitin of Indi- ans who lOLitinely participate iii the vibr- ant and throbbing elections of this the greatest democracy of the p(K)r and the illiterate known to history and the world. Rob our elections of their colour — and you run the danger of robbing our •UNDAY 7^13 May 1995 17 democracy ol its vim. Us vitality, its vifioui. True, Seshan in his tlorid person provides all the colour out electorate needs. Hut think of the damage vSeshan- ism could do in the hands ot lesser Seshans than Seshan WE ARE beguiled by SeshatVs winso- me rhetoric into believing that, until he came on the scene, few were the Dalits who W'cnt to the polls and many the hap- less sheep corailed there to pul their thumb imprint on the insignia of the chosen candidate of the local thug. If so, 1 find it difficult to explain how' the most dramatic changes of government occurr- ed decades before C’iiandra Shekhar had this cccentiic whim of making a CFX’ of Seshan. In f>67, the Congress was reduced to not having a single state govenimcnt bet- ween Wagah-Altari on the West Paki- stan border and Jessore on the East Paki- stan frontier Doubtles.^ fewer Dalits than in Seshan’ s day made it to the ballot- box. Yet, that made not a w'hit of differ ence to the outcome. The electorate w'an- ted the ruling party out — and out, des- pite all its wiles, went the ruling parly, mvpany! The election results of 1977 were even more significant A ruling pany — mine — which had the strength to impose and maintain the Emergency, would also have had the strength to ng the elections if it could. The point is that it couldn’t. The electorate did mn need vSeshan to have itself a fair election. And that master of all wiles, Prime Minister (’haran Singh, could do damn all about forestalling the inevitable when the elec- torate decided it was time to forgive Indi ra Gandhi and bring her back to Safdar- jung Road. And w'hcic w'as Seshan at the lime? 1 can't quite remember — hut, if memory serves light, keeping the accounts at the department of space. The fact is we did not need to tic an Alsatian at the gate to stop the rigger from perverting the piJIs. As Rajiv Gandhi discovered to hi- cost when as FVime Minister, with a CEC whose docility and complicity Seshan appears to hold in the deepest contempt, a CEC, moreover, crippled by two auxiliary election commissioners nominated on the immediate eve of the polls (doubtless to ensure that even the spineless Peri Sasiri did not do the wor- m's trick and turn) — what did any ol this avail Rajiv but rejection by the elec- torate at the ballot-box? If our electoral process were as rotten as Seshan loves insinuating, could such a rcvolulionui’y overthrow ot what Khushwant Singh calls the ‘Royal Family’ have been possible? FRANKLY, IT is nonsense to suggest that our electoral process was irrevocab- ly polluted till Seshan arrived in the scene; as much nonsense as to imagine that Seshan has somehow magically cleaned up the whole process. For take the instructive case of Bihar. There was not a trick in the book that Congress chief minister Sinha and Pradesh Congress president Jagannath Mishra did not know when we went to the |;x>lls m November 1989. In the stale with the worst irack record t^f electoral maipraciu e, the ruling parly was thrash- ed at the husimgs. Without, I might add, the benefit of Sesliiin's benign supervision And with Scslian’s supervision, and ail the Nirvachan S.ulan-induccd shena- nigans that went with the March 1995 polls 111 Bihar, the most nolori(>us booth- capluiei in all of Bihar’s sordid electoral history has returned to office with an overwhelming majority. Has the rEC\"s presence made elections in Fiihar more - ' or less — 'fan? Or, in fact, has lbs pre- sence (file uppci case is delibeialc because Seshan is now part of our pan- theon) — oi, in fact, has His presence not made a tinker’s danm of difference to anything but our middle-class’s mind- less fawning over the man? We are in danger of surrendering our- selves to an illusionist. It is, of course, important for cvciy registered voter to gel to the polls and vole as he or she wishes, without let or hindiancc. But, such a preponderant proportion of our electorate have, in fact, been doing so over ten general elections and hundreds of state elections that perversions in the poll process have had hardly any impael on the eventual outcome. Moreover, every verdict has been res- pected as the correct verdict ■— by the losers, by the victors, by the general body of voters. It was so before Seshan. It will be so after Seshan Seshan ’s real aehievemcnl is restricted to the fact that It has remained so in his time, The insistence on photo-identity car- ds, the staggering of polling over months, the meretricious deployment of security and paramilitary forces, switching off Prannoy Roy’s freedom of expression, silencing the loud-speakers, restricting poster-pollution and controll- ing the snake-icngih of careadcs, might have made some marginal contribution to strengthening our democracy. But the truth of the matter is that we were a burgeoning democracy decades before Seshan came on the scene and we will retnain a burgeoning democracy long after Seshan departs. History’s ver- dict on Seshan will not be that he cither made - - or saved — Indian democracy; - but that he gave us a good belly-laugh while casting the office of CEC in the role of Gogia Pasha.

Seshan three years ago when I went to W» Ite^m photograph him for an p assignment for Sunday. The chief election commissioner (CEC) had just found himself in the centre of a controversy when employees at Nirvachan Sadan had protested against his ‘mistreating’ a woman colleague Far from being cowed down, Seshan was forthcoming and effusive. Sunday decided to publish a first person account of the whole episode and I was to photograph him for the record. As 1 went about setting up the lights, putting up a soft box and umbrellas, Seshan asked, \"Young man, is it going to rain?\" It was, however, obvious that the CEC was fascinated by all the paraphernalia. He asked endless questions about the equipment and remarked that he had all along assumed that the only gear a photographer needed was a camera and a lens. The assignment produced about 20 frames which were preserved for Sunday’s records. It was already apparent then that T.N. Seshan was going to be in the news for a long time to come. A year later, Sunday put him on the cover for the first time. The headline said.

By then, the initial media honcyiTKK)!! with the CF.C was over and more and more articles criticising Seshan had begun to appeitr ail over the place — including Sunday. Yet, Seshan was courteous and affable with me. Over a photo-session that stretched to three days, the CEC was ctK)}x.Tative and proved to be a photographer’s delight. He could frow n, smile, l(X)k threatening or morose within seconds. 1 asked him how he could do this. And he informed me that he had learned Kathakali and this is what gave him the gift of quicksilver expressions. rhe Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka Assembly results had just started coming in and the CHC had his work cut out for him. Yet, it was impoitanl for me to photograph him in his work environment.

Wherever he went, heads would snap to attention and he carried around him an aura of unshakeable pi^wer. But it was e(}ually important for me to shiX)t Seshan the man, in his home environment. I asked him how he began his day. He said he would like to begin his day on his exercise bike. However, the demands on his time were so miuiy that the p(X)r bike had now been relegated to his guest room and was seldom used. I asked to see the bike and we lr<H>ped upstairs, where it now lay abandoned. I asked Seshan if he would get on the bike for me. He agreed and we dragged the bike out to Ihe verandah where, after a long spell, the CRC and his bike were united again. By now, Seshan was clearly in a moixi to cooperate. We went out lo the garden where I photographed him in a dhoti and kiirta hiking a walk with his wife. We went back indoors to his puja room and 1 photographed him before his deities. Ever since the CF<!! has remained in the news. Not only as the CEC but, more recently, as a budding writer. I had already taken some I asked Seshan if he would get on the exercise hike for me.

Now the CEC informed me that UBS was publishing a collection of his speeches, A Heart Full ttf Burden, and that he would like to use the photographs I had taken for his bcxik cover. Of course, I had no objections and was glad to talk to UBS’ Ashok Chopra about this. Before long.

And keen that he is photographed favourably for posterity. • SUNDAY? l3M«y1995 25 FIRST PERSON POWER PLAY RAJIV SHUKLA Gov erning Govern^ Lessons from the Channa Reddy- Jayalalitha battle It is high time the President of India introduces a code of conduct for Governors. Not only have they been causing great embarrassment to their respective state governments, but their behaviour at times has not been in keeping with the august office of a Governor. And it's not only that the Tamil Nadu Governor, Channa Kcddy, has pul the central government in an embar- rassing position. There have been many instan- ces in the recent past when Governors have clearly exceeded their brief In W93, Bhanu Pratap vSingh, the then Governor (>f Goa, had dismissed the government led by Wilfr- ed D\\Sou/a and mst died Ravi Naik as the chief minister of Goa without even consulting the cen- tral government or the President. More recently, the Himachal Pradesh (iovemor, Sudhakarrao Naik, made scathing attacks on his political rival, Sharad Pawar, hold- ing the latter responsible for the Congress’ defeat in Maharashtra. In doing so, Naik has clearly viola- ted the tradition that the Governor does not dab- ble in politics. What's more, Naik even met several Independent MLAs from Maharashtia and urged them to support the BJP-Shiv Sena government during the confidence motion in the state Assembly. The matter reached such a pt»int that Prime Minister Narasimha Rao summoned the Governor and pulled him up for hie conduct. In 1994, Gulsher Ahrncd was forced t('/ resign from the governorship of Himachal Pradesh after he actively parti- cipated in the election campaign of his son. The Hlection Commission took exception to this behaviour and directed the C-'entre to take action against him. The Rao government asked Ahmed to resign. During his earlier term as chief mini- ster, N.T. Rama Rao and the then Gover- nor of the state, KumudbenJoshi, partici- pated in a memorable slanging match. Rama Rao even went to the extent of sug- gesting that the post of Governor should be abolished. As far as M, Channa Reddy is concer- ned, he has always been a controversial Governor. When he was Governor of Uttar Pradc.sh, he used to abuse bureaucrats during meetings. As Gover- nor of Rajasthan, Channa Reddy appoin- ted two vice-chancellors of local univer- sities by violating conventions. And the day he went to the Madras Raj Bhavan, he picked up a fight with chief minister Jayalalitha. There have been many insiances where Governors did not get along well with their chief ministers, but never before has a constitutional crisis been precipitated as Channa Reddy and Jayalalitha have now done. It is a well known I act that the Karnataka Governor, Khurshid ^ A lam Khan, never liked the then ».hief minister, Veerapa Moily, and Bhagwat Jha Azad as chief minister of Bihar had a tiff with the then Governor, Govind Narayan Singh, Tripura Governor Romesh Bhan- dan also does not get along well with the chief minister. But they never allowed things to go beyond acetic in limit. But there arc a few Governors like Motilal Vora, P.C. Alexander, Raghunath Reddy and K. Ramanujam who not only maintain a cordial relationship with the chief ministers, but they also see to it that the digni- ty of their office remains intact. In fact, Motilal Vora got along well with such diverse personalit- ies as Kalyan Singh, Mulayam Singh and N.D. Tiwari. No political paity has any grievance against him.. But then, people like Motilal Vora are clearly in a minority these days. It is essential that the Parliament and the Pre- sident formulate a code of conduct for Governors so that the rules of the game are laid down in black and white. • Of late, Governors have been exceeding their brief. While Channa Reddy (left) has managed to precipitate a constitutional crisis of sorts in Tamil Nadu, Sudhakarrao Naik, the Himachal Pradesh Governor, has indicated that he is not above petty politics eUNDAY7~l3May1d95 27 RUPINOEA SHARMA FATAL CURE Many X-ray clinics in the capital and elsewhere are exposing patients to dangerous radiation S hamia’s X-»ay I ahoialDiy in Pahargan), IX’lhi, proud ly Haunts its ‘lacilitics'oii a greasy, sool-ladcn boani — (.

In fact, according to an ongoing sur- vey commissioned by the Union minis- try of health and which is being conduct- ed by Dr B.K.S. Chauhan, a consultant with Safdarjung Hospital, most of the private X-ray clinics in Delhi are violat- ing safety standards. Anything goes here — small, cramped rooms, no pi otec- tive measures taken by the staff and crowding of patients in the same room where the X-ray machine is installed. \"There is absolutely no attention paid to health at most of these clinics,\" elabora- tes Dr Chauhan. Not that the large hospitals are any bet- ter. On 27 April, the Atomic Hnergy Regulatory Board (AERB) banned the Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital in New Delhi from con- ducting radiotherapy on new patients.

All these violations, the directive mled, flouted the Radiation Protection Rules, 1971, and the Atomic Energy Act of 1962.

They ■arc making hay while the sun shines.\" And considering that a single X-ray costs anything between Rs 75 to Rs 1 50, there is plenty of hay to be made. Add to this the fact that since there is little check on the mu.shrooni growth of X-ray cli- nics, practically anybody can set up a machine at his residence without a licen- ce or permit. And since a 1 00 mm confi- guration machine costs Rs 3 lakh and suf- fices lor the basic X-rays of the limbs, abdomen and chest — the three most frequently required for diagnosis by doc- tors — the proposition is indeed a lucra- tive one. W hat many drKtors are peeved about is that while all medical practitioners arc supposed to register them.selves with the Medical Councifof India (MCI), there is no such require- ment for radiologists. Cautions Dr S.K. Bhargava, head of the radiology depart- ment at Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital (GTBH), \"We need a paramedical coun- cil to regulate the standards of radiogra- phy in Delhi. Or else, the hazards of radi- ation will continue to plague us.\". What compounds the problem further SAFETY NORMS As laid down by BARC Tfie Radiation Protection Unit oj the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre ( BARC) prescribes precautionary regulations for the control of radiation from X-ray and CTscan units. Following are the recommendations: ■ Before installing X-ray and CT scan units, the owner must obtain written clearance from the Bombay-based centre which is the only authorised regulatory bixly. ■ There should be at least nine-inch thick concrete walls and 0.6 mm lead screens on air-tight doors and windows to avoid the passage of radiation from the room where the X-ray machines are installed. The room should not be cramped and there should be enough space for the staff $ mobility, depending on the configuration of the X-ray machine. I Technicians handling the above equipment should always be wearing protective gear like lead-rubber aprons, film badges, gloves and goggles to protect themselves from the hazardous effects of exposure to radiation. ■ The owner should anticipate the detedoratjon of the above radiation iwotective materials and order timely replacement of them. • The film badges, worn by the technicians handling X-ray ^wipiaent, absorb radiation. These nlms should be sent to the BARC .htonth to guage the amount of . miation the person is being exposed il Apart froin the above protection, 56^ should be tajken to regularly If eheck X-ray fnachines to detect and prevent any possible radiation leakage.

Apart from theory, the course offers stu- dents practical training in radiography. However, in the midst of all the brou- haha, Delhi’s health ministry had only political platitudes to offer. Says Dr Harsh Vardhan, minister of state for heal- th, \"Wc want to regulate the activity in these diagnostic centres. But our hands are lied because these centres are clubb- ed under ‘neighbourhood facilities’ and come under the purview of the ministiy ot urban affairs. We have raised the issue in the Assembly to monitor the satety standards in these centres. Let’s see what comes out of it. You don’t expect us to down shutters on all these centres.\" And till such time that ‘something comes out of it’, Sharma’s X-ray labora- tory will continue to rake it in. Blissfully exposing patients and the entire neigh- bourhood to hazardous radiation. • 30 SUNOAY7— tSMaylMS THE SOUTH BLOCK INDER MALHOTRA Universal soldiers Should one forget the role of the Indian Army in World War H? 9 May is a very import- ant date in the history of the century that is drawing to a ch)sc. This was brought home to me most for- cefully exactly 30 years ago, on 8 May, I 1965, when I landed in Moscow lor the first time, four days ahead of the then Prime Minister, Lai Bahadur Shastn. The Soviet capital was bedecked with flags, banners and buntings. Even more remarkable was the air of festive joy per- vading the city. It was clear that this had nothing to do with the Indian Prime Minister’s , j expected arrival. But I ^ ^ did not know what the ' extraordinary excitement was about. t ’’Don’t you know,\" ; ^ said the Russian friends, ' j who had come with my > S Indian host to receive me ' 1 at the airport, \"that lomor- . I row is the 20th anni versa- > < 'M ry of victory ove: Ger- V/ man fascism? It is a great ^ day in our lives.\" Over the next two days I was part of unending celebra- tions in private homes and public places. Incvita- • bly, Leonid Brezhnev delivered an interminable > speech at the Kremlin. At \" -1 « a spectacular military lillSSi parade in the Red Square (IVWGb SS-20 missiles were Indian P unveiled. . The Soviet Union is OliniSiarf dead and gone. But Mother Russia goes on. And the Rus- sians are getting ready to celebrate the golden jubilee of their famous victory and to remember the 20 million of their countrymen who died to beat Hitler’s hordes. No wonder then that a big cere- mony is t^ing place in Moscow, at which President Bill Clinton will be the most prominent guest. Britain will celebrate the triumph over the forces of fascism a day earlier than Russia. This is so because while the Nazi General, Alfred Jodi, had suiTcnde- red to General Eisenhower on 8 May, 1945, at Reams in France, the Russians took the surrender of the Nazis in Berlin the next day. They had, needless to add, got to the citadel of the Nazi power well belbre the Western armies. Interestingly, Clinton declined all Bri- tish suggestions that he should stop over in London on his way to Moscow. Even more interestingly, this happened well before the British got angry over the lio- nising of the Sinn Fein leader in Washington and John Major refused to The Russians wM celebrate the goMen jubilee of tbw over Geniian fascisin on 9 May. But they have not invited Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, who is also defence minister and representative of the aimed forces, to Moscow I lake Clinton's propitiatory phone calls, j In short, the \"special Anglo-American relationship\", rather illusory at the best of times, is now a thing of the past. It would be futile to overlook the slow' but unfortunately steady growth of neo- Nazi forces in Germany and the menac- ing rise of racialism and fascism in other parts of Europe. However, the present German mainstream parties cannot be blamed for the crimes of Hitler, And It is precisely this which makes it regrettable that from the ceremony that Chancellor Helmut Kohl staged at the river Elbe, where Russian and American soldiers had first met half-a-century ago, the Poles were excluded. No less shcK'king than this is another melancholy fact. In the whole series of extravaganzas, the sacrifices and servi- ces of the Indian Army iu'e being neglect- ed completely. The two-and-a-half mill- ion Indian soldiers and officers, who took part in that war, constituted the larg- est voluntary force known to history. These gallant men fought, given the country’s circumstances then, under the banner of an alien king. But they fought against fascism. The braveiy with which they did so is a matter of public record. And yet, neither the Indian government nor the governments of the friendly countries, which arc immersed in festivi- ties, have done anything to honour the Indians, who contributed much to the defeat o^ both the Ger- mans and the Japanese. Few remember it but India had a seat on the Allied Control Commis- sion that was set up to run Germany immediately • wUImmu surrender. irVICIOry Ambassador Khub invited Chand was given a tempo- [l0fenC6 major - general and named the commission’s Indian member. Indian troops were present also at the Japanese surrender to Mountbatten at Singapore. Our Russian friends have invited fore- ign minister Pranab Mukheijec to be pre- sent at the Moscow celebrations. But this is not good enough. Appropriately, the Prime Minister, who is also defence minister and representative of the armed forces, should have been asked to join. But then if the South Block docs not bother, why should the Kremlin? • •UNDAV7— iSMuylOgs 31 W hen Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray said in March that he believ- ed Sanjay Dull lo be ' an iniux-ent wrongly ' detained under I'errorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, (TADA), everyone thought the actor’s confine- , ment wascoming loan end. But subsequ- ent events like the court’s relusal to dis- charge Dull and the filing of charge- sheets against him and 1 27 others accus- ed under TADA on 20 April have put paid to chances of his quick release. The legal procedures seem to drag endlessly and with the closure of the courts for summer, there is not much chance of Dull being out on bail. Dutt has been charged with offences i under various sections of TADA and the | Arms Act I le has been accused of \"unau- 1 ihoriscd’v acquiring and keeping in his ' possessK n three AK-56 rifles, ammuni- tion, a ‘9-mm pistol, its cartridges and hand grenades\". He has also been charg- ed with being a party to a criminal cons- piracy, a charge that the senior defence counsel, Majeed Mcmtm, says has \"no substance\". In the latest lepori by defence ’ lawyers, Memon submitted to Justice J.N. Patel of the special TADA court that the cases of all those detained under the preventive Act in connection with . A SECOND OPINION The court seeks review reports on TADA cases. Will it help Sanjay Dutt get the benefit of the doubt? the Bombay blasts be reviewed by a spe- cial committee. Memon contends that those accused in the bomb blasts, includ- ing Dutt, have not been screened by the TADA review committee and that this is a lapse of justice. The submission comes at a crucial juncture and Justice Patel’s direction that the CBI has to comply with the demand and make available review reports on or before 15 May is a small triumph for the defence. Retired Justice D.N. Mehta, who heads the .screening committee, explains its significance and origin. \"As a result of the Kartar Singh Commission, which w as appointed by the Supreme Court to look into the misuse of TADA, a signifi- j cant modification was made in 1993 in | the method of registering a case. The modification was to the extent j that once an offence is registered, it I should be sanctioned by a deputy com- missioner of police (if in Bombay, then by the commissioner of police). And auei ihis, llie ease i.s referred to the scree- ning committee. \"The concerned investigating officer presents the case to the committee aJong with evidence. Wc see if the case falls within Section 3 (terrorism), 4 (disrup- tive activities) or 5 (possession of illegal arms). If it does, then each individual accused in the case is reviewed separate- ly.\" To dale, 300 TADA cases have been reviewed, none of which was related to the blasts. W hen the TADA review committee was formed in July 1994, it brought a ray of hope to the accused. But it faded as soon as it became known that the committee was only a recommenda- tory one and that its jurisdiction didn’t extend to the Bombay blast ca.se. \"If the court has taken cognisance of a ca.se, then the review committee doesn’t come into the picture. And since the com- mittee was formed after the blast accus- ed charge-sheet was formed, we have nothing to do with them,\" explains Justi^ ce D.N. Mehta. Memon contends this, saying a Supre- me Court judgement had made reviews mandatory \"to ensure a higher level of scrutiny in the applicability of TADA. The committee has to review the action of the enforcing authorities and hold quarterly reviews of the application of TADA provisions in respective stales\". This was one of the grounds on which the Supreme Court upheld the validity ofTADA. Justice Mehia agrees thal the delay in justice for 7'ADA cases is a \"negation of freedom and democracy. Cases that arc non-bailable should come up within six to eight months. You can’t put a man away and lorgel aboiil him for two years If his case doesn't come up, then he should he given bail. This is an obliga- tion ol the lawmaker, law -enforcer and law administrator\" Until befoie the elections, the screen- ing committee used to meet once or twice a week in a conlererice room in the Mantralaya, but at present, its activities are at a standstill due to the change in government. Apart fiom Justice Mehta, the com- mittee also consists of the home and law secrctanes, the police commissioner and the director-general of police. Lawyers and human rights activists object to this, saying the majority of the committee consists of people, who h*we a strong bias agaii st the accused The only objective person is rhe retired judge and though he heads tlie committee, he has to depend on the other members for information Justice Mehta says, \"rhe essential function of the screening commitiec is to ensure that no one is wrongfully detai- ned under TADA \" He believes thal des pile being merely a rccxmimcndaiory body, the committee should not be dis- missed. He likens its role to that ol a \"second legal opinion\". B ut Prabhakar Hegde, a senior defen- ce counsel who also represents San- jay Dutt, says the review commitiec is a mere \"whitewash\". Hegde dismisses it saying, \"It is appointed by the state. They can appoint 1(X) committees. My point is that the existing committee is not as required by the law set down by the Supreme Court. There is no review committee at present — neither the Cen- tre nor the state has appointed a commit- tee as suggested by rhe Supreme Court in the Kartar Singh judgement. Why this SUNDAY?— 13 May 1995 has happened, I don’t know,\" Hegde feels the committee is going to .serve no useful purpose. \"With all res* pect lo Mr Mehta, I will not go before the D.N. Mehia committee because it ;s an admimstiative one\" He thinks that ihvnigh Mehta is there lo ensure jiislice. all the stipulations of ihe Kartar Singh judgement are not being followed to make ihul possible. \"He is not the com- mittee appointed by law,\" asserts Hegde. Hegde says that according to the Kartar Singh judgemenl, the committee should be headed by a High (\\)uii judge so that prcKcedmgs amount lo a judicial review He argues thal \"Ihe composiiion ot Ihe stale commiucew ith iisehiel sect eta A Bombay building wrecked by the blasts: ry, home secretary and law secretary clearly indicates that an ailministrative review is being contemplated and not a judicial one. It may be recalled that the Kartar Singh judgemenl was dcliveted on 1 1 March. 19^4, and the Supreme C\\)url was aware of the amendment lo TADA which came into force on 22 May, 1 99V' (In this, before a ease is .sent to a 7 ADA court, it has lo receive sanction from either the inspector- geneial ol police or the commissioner.) So w hat happens to the eases institut- ed before 22 May, 1993. without the sanction of the C7^ oi the KJP'' Obviously, the review' committee is a must in such eases Hegde also raises the point ot the non- too many suspects The legal procedures seem to drag endlessly and with the closure of the courts for summer, there is not much chance of Sanjay Dutt being out on bail. He has been charged with offences under various sections of T ADA and the Arms Act availability ot the icporls t>f the commit- | tcc. \"It is necessary for Ihe governmeni at the state and Centre to report then find- ings to the court. And if they etnne lo the conclusion that I'ADA should not have been applied against some people, then that would amount lo non-sanetioning of the prosecution. 7’hercfore, after this report comes, the court can’t act. It is not permissible for the court to sit in judge- ment on the matter of sanction being giv- en in a ease which is tllctl alter Ihe amendment.\" And on this quirky intcrpietalion, Hegde just might catch the prosecution on the wrong f<K)t. • Lylm Bmvmdam/Bombay | FOCUS Games politicians play Behind Sadhvi Rithamhara 's arrest is admirers say that the move IS a political master- stroke that will pay rich dividends for him and his party in the next Assembly |X)IIs. His critics, however, believe that the chief minister has stepped into a trap laid by his rivals. Whatever be the case, there is no doubt that the arrest of the fire- brand Vi shwa Hindu Pari- shad (VHP) leader, Sadh- vi Rithamhara, in Indore on 24 April, has placed Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh m a piquant position, Many political obser- vers in the state say that tiic arrest oi the Sadhvi on chiirgcs of provoking communal hatred is the chief minister's way of ||y||b|^ getting back at the Bhara- liya Janata Party (BJP), wliich has been making a steady comeback in ^ Madhya Pradesh ever f I since It lost power to the 1 Congress ne<irly two years back For one, Dig- vijay Singh was despera- te to establish his secular credentials and win back the confidence of the k minorities in the post- 1 Ayodhya phase. There was one more ^ important point. Develop- % ments within the Con- gress party over the last couple of months had ma.de Digvijay's position , in die state somewhat . shak>. He desperately ; needed a:i issue that ' “ would get him the sup- BOth DIfl port of all the secular for- ^ ces in Madhya Pradesh. 58011 The Sadhvi issue provid- DOlltiCS ed him with just that - - opportunity. 8DI6 10 But, there are others who feel that the chief minister has actually bungled while handling the Sadhvi issue After all, the BJP needed an issue to stage a comeback in the state. And, by arresting Sadhvi Rithamhara, Digvijay Singh has only helped the fundamentalist forces in Madhya Pradesh to get logethei on one platform. It all began with the arrest ol Sadhvi X Rithamhara in Indore on24Apnl.The charge delivering a cominunally- provocative speech at Udainagar in the Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh. The meeting was organised by the Vanwasi Kalyan Pan shad, one of the many fron- tal organisations of the sangh parivar which works among the tribals of the Raigarh district. Udianagar, incidcntal- ly, is the place where a Christian nun, Sister ^ Maria, was murdered Hjll exactly two months back allegedly by a BJP activist. In the course of her fiery speech, the Sadhvi reportedly threatened the Christian missioncirics with dire con. sequences and she even went to the extent of calling Mother Teresa a \"jLiduganii' (magician). She warned the Christian missionar- ies and asked them lo stop the sinister business of conversions. She said. Ram mandit ka virodh karega, uski Ram naam satya h<p jayegi (those who iippose the Ram temple would be anni h 1 1 ated ) . . Mukiyam Singh narhhakshi hai aur uske sath hai Kanshi Ram, auryahan to musal- > man hhi holega Jai Shree A Ram (Mulayam Singh is ^ a man-eater and with him I is Kanshi Ram, and here I even Muslims will chant I Jdi Shree Ram).\" Both Digvijay Singh and the BJP have been using Sadhvi Rithamhara’s (ahove) arrest to gain poiiticai miiaaga. And so far, the BJP has heen ahia to raiiy aii the forces of the sangh parh/ar behind the Sadhvi The next day, Ritham- bara was arrested from Indore, where she had put up at the residence of her guru, Swami Parmanand. Not willing to take any chances, the cops prompt- ly whisked her off to Gwalior even before her SUNDAY 7 -13 May 1905 supporters were out of bed. But, trouble broke out m Indore once the news of the Sadhvi's Lurest spread. There was violen^ cc and noting in many parts of the city. And the tension soon spread to other parts of the state, especially Bhopal. On 28 Apnl, Ruham- bara was to be taken to Bagli to be produced before the court. The plan was to bring her to Bho- pal by tiain and then onwards to Bagli by road. Somehow', BjP workers came to know of this, and on the appointed day, a large crowd led by the BJP mayc^r of Bhopal assembled at the city rail- way station. Fearing a law and order problem. the authorities got Sadhvi Rithambara to alight at Sukhi Sewaniya, a few kms from Bhopal Hnraged by this, BJP wor- kers went berserk, damaging railway property. The matter didn’t end there. Though, Section 144 was clamped in Bhopal, on 1 May, VHP activists operating under the banner of the Hindu Chetana Manch mobilised the sadhus {o protest against the Sadhvi' s arrest. A day before, Acha- lya Giriraj Kishorc told newsmen that about 2,(XK) sadhus would demonstrate in Bhopal. But the threat turned out to be a damp squib Says Ginraj Kishore: \"At least 25 busloads of sadhus have been detained by the government at various places in Madhya Pradesh while they were procee- ding to Bhopal \" He also warned, \"If the chief mini.ster vvants io put Madhya Pradesh on tire, so be it.\" M ost leaders of the saffron brigade feel that the Sadhvi is needlessly being framed by Digvijay Singh's Con- gress government. Swami Parmanand alleged, \"The video film of the Udaina- gar meeting produced by the govern- ment as evidence has been suitably edited.\" Jaibhan Singh Pavaiya, another VHP leader, asked, \"Why was it that only Rithambara was arrested when Kai- lash Joshi and Dilip Singh Judeo also spoke in the same lone?\" He added, \"The government did not dare to arrest Kanshi Ram and Mayawati last year SunderlalPatwa (below), former BJP CM of the state, says that Digvijay Singh arrested Sadhvi Rithambara only to prove to the world that he is a secular man when they abused Mahatma Gandhi and fanned communal hatiTed.\" Soon, the sangh parivar s sants and sadhus took over the task of negotiating with the government to secure Ritham- bara’s release. Last week, they marched toward the Mantralaya, the state secreta- riat, but the police prevented them from entering the CM's office. Later, a delegation of seers met the chief minister at his residence. Digvijay Singh repeatedly asked the sadhus to give in writing that they will never encourage provocative speeches or fan communal hatred. The meeting I'cll through as the CM’s behaviour incensed the sadhus and sants. Giriraj Kishore later said, \"The agitation will continue till she is released.\" The VHP now plans to hold demon- strations all over the stale. Members of the Durga Vahini, the irilitant women’s wing of the sangh parivar, and the Baj- rang Dal have also been roped in to lend a cutting edge to the movement. Vinay Kaliyar, the Bajrang Dal chief, feels that all efforts to resolve the issue in a peaceful manner have failed since Digvijay Singh is under intense pressure from \"Sonia Gandhi and international agencies\". Adds Sunderlal Patwa, the former chief minister of the state, \"When people like Syed Shahabuddin and Imam Bukhari spit venom, no action is taken against them. But Digvi» jay Singh has arrested Sadhvi Rithamba- ra only to prove to the world that he is a secular man.\" Whatever be the truth, there is no denying that Digvijay Singh is a worried man these days, especially after his men- tor, Arjun Singh, turned a rebel. Maybe, he is just using the Sadhvi Rithambara issue to come out of the corner that he now finds himself in. • D m& hdmmp SmxmM/Bhapal SUNDAV7~-13Mav199fi 35 GN JHA PATWANT SINGH JUSTICE DEN]g Simranjit Siugh Mann 's case is the Indian equivalent of the Dreyfus A ffair in France E ighteen ninciv lour vviliu'ss cd a gross nnscariiagc ol jLishcc w) I ranct', which in the next lew vears would plunge that iKiiion into yeais of unprecedented social turbulence Leon Blum, a luture Premiei, lelt that the Dreyliis AHair \"was a human crisis, less extended and less prolonged in time hut no less violent than the Lrench Revolution At the litre ol this allair lay the arr- est and conviction of Captain Allred Dreyfus, an artillery officer on duty with the General vStaff, on charges of betray- ing mihtai’y secrets to Germany rhe trial and sentencing of Dreyfus were pro- vided a cutting edge by the prevailing anti»semitic temper m iTance, because Captain Alfred IDreyfus was a Jew A man on whom \"the stain ol treason\" could be made to stick, and the violation of w'hose rights w'oiild be sanctioned by the instinctive prejudices of Frvnch society.

For five years, he was subjected to uns- peakable fonns of torture, denied the most basic needs, and conimed alone tor long stretches of time in cells from where he couldn't tell the difference bet- ween night and day.

In the Mann case, few scholars, writers, colum- nists, artists, academicians, professio- nals or parliamentarians have rallied to his defence because Indian society gene- rally prefeis to expend its passions on pursuits w hich have little lodo w ith justi- ce, fair play and such. 'fhere are other dissimilarities loo. Whilst hardly any papers in India have expressed editorial outrage oi launched a crusade against the continuing viola- tion of Mann’s rights, the French press made it a ( aiise celchre. Whether for or against Dreyfus, papers and journals like [a' Temps, L'Aurore, Lc Slide, Ia^ Here Peiuard, Ia^ Pel tie RepuhUipte, Let Lihre Parole, Le Pent Parisien kept the affair in the public eye for almost 12 yciirs until Dreyfus was reinstated in the army in 1 906. Yet another dissimilarity is that whilst the French Jewish community alongwith powerful non-Jewish voices hcli'ied arouse France's collective con- science in the Dreyfus Affair, some members of ManiTs own community have helped to put the knife in him. Then again, whilst the Dreyfus Affair attracted worldwide attention from Lon- don, Berlin. Oslo, Chicago to Melbour- ne, Mann's case has been buried in the chanceries of the world because it would be unwise to jeopardise the economic opportunities India offers through inop- porfune criticism Men like Mann do not figure in the mantra of self-interest. All the same, it is worth recalling Queen Vic- toria’ s communique to Lord Russel, the Lord Chief Justice of England, when Dreyfus was found guilty even after his second trial in August 1889: \"The Que- en has learned with stupefaction the frightful verdict and hopes the poor martyr will appeal it to tlie highest judges.\" 36 SUNDAY / -13 May 19»S As for appealing to the courts, which court does Mann appeal to? Over 1 1 police stations in different districts of Punjab have registered cases against him since 5 January this year. Only in one of them has he been brought to trial whilst the others are said to be \"under investigation”, while he, of cour- se, continues in custody. A slate govem- M ann established his own democra- tic credentials by fighting the 1 989 elections whilst still in Jail when the new political party formed in his name won ten out of the 13 parliamentary seats in Punjab. The fact that he ran for Parlia- ment was evidence of his belief in Indi- a’s democratic and elective processes. Yet, itonically. New Delhi did not view Mann’s party — even after it secured the largest number ol parliamentary seats any singleparty hadever won in Punjab — as harbingers of political stability in Punjab. It saw him as a political force which had to be neutralised and destroy- ed by any means At this critical stage in 1989, everyo- ne took the wrong turn. Mann, by refus- ing to enter Parliament unle.ss he could take his sword with him, threw away a unique opportunity to use this national forum to ♦uriher Punjab’s interests. The Union Government by failing to resolve the impasse in a mature and statesman- like manner, with the V.P. Singh govern- ment compounding its error through insensitivity — or even deliberate intent — by not including a single Sikh in the Cabinet. And the Congress party by cha- racteristically continuing to work surrep- titiously at dividing the Akalis and erod- ing Mann’s massive suppport base. Once the Congress returned to power at the Centre, various inducements includ- ing large funds were offered to encoura- ge bre^away factions to form iheii own parties. With the Akalis kept busy erod- ing their own strength, the Congress governance down to debased levels This duo also had scores to settle with Mann because of his outspokenness, his continuing criticism of their function- ing, his refusal to be bought out. and more than anything else because he had to be broken before he could stage a poli- tical comeback. What better way of doing it than by chiu-ging him with trea- son, with intent to secede from the Union. Eiven though this same man had given Ram Jethmalani, in writing, his intention to work w ithin the constitution- al framework, had contested elections under the ronslitutitin and had appealed to the Indian courts foi justice Whilst the autlioiities are willing to make every allowance foi their own excesses, they arc unwilling to make any exception even lor a politician’s speech, especially if that politician is someone they are bent on destroying. Speeches, as is well-know n, are tactics for draw ing attention and votes They are not state- ments of intent. So, if Mann has talked of secession, he shouid be handled in a statesmanlike manner and negotiated with, rather than driven to increasingly extreme positions One of the many perversions m Indi- an public life today is that whilst some people who openly stand for .secession or genocide, and who flout their links with the underworld are allowed to go free, otliers are incarceiated for years. A state which is selective in enforcing its laws, cannot inspire confidence in its constituents. There are startling similarities between the Dreyfus and Mann cases. The former was an army officer, the latter a police officer. Neither Dreyfus had committed any crime, nor did Mann. Dreyfus was a member of a minority community, as is Mann. Dreyfus was brutally treated in jail, so was Mann ment, which holds the laws of the land in contempt, has stacked these cases again- st him so that even if a court releases him on one charge he can be detained against ten others. Some cases against him are booked under the odious Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), which enables the authorities to detain him indefinitely. Each disgrace- ful tactic provides evidence of how \"democratic\" India actually functions. sneaked back to power in 1992 with only ten per cent of the vote, since the Akalis had foolishly refused to contest the elections. The installation of an unprincipled Congress chief minister and a ruthless police chief set the stage for state terror which has destroyed decencies in public life, rubbished the laws designed to safe- guard people’s rights, and brought Dreyfus had another advantage. When in the midst of the affair, Emile Loubet w as elected Presi- dent of France, he proved to be a man more commit- ted to seeing Justice done than his predecessor. In the same mould was Rene Waldeck-Rousscau who loo would form the government during those tumultuous years. In the end, even though it took 1 2 years, Justice was done. Mann has been hounded for 1 1 years. Isn’t it time the Prime Minister, a well- read man by all accounts, reflected on the vagaries of his renegade men in F*un- jab and brought them to heel? Isn’t it time to call off the disgraceful vendetta against a man who has been sufficiently savaged by the Indian state? • •UNDAY7— 13Miy 1995 37 CENSORSHIP The dramatist said that his play wasn’t intended to hurt anybody but to reinterpret the story of Jesus as any creative author would do.

The play presented Jesus not as the son of God but as a human being, and Mary Magdalene as free of any blemish. The church took oflencc, and on the basis of a publicity maienal distributed by the theatre group, it urged the police to take action. So the police swooped down while the group was rehearsing, confiscated the script and attested Antony. Antony got bail from a district court and moved the High Court of Kerala to lift the police ban.
