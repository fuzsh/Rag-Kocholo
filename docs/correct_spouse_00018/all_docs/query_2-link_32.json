The country has not been ^ble to live out of its violent legacy and .aatadii had been marred with the worst piolenceinhistoty The country's economic If tuation was fast declining and there was |‘$(B6 woe imposed and the IMF said that fste situation in foe country was out of jtmtrol. i * K foese were not enough. Prime Mm- 5 hs Benazir Bhutto was being inoeasmgly ien as corrupt. There were reports foather Ji^shand Asif 2^ari had acquired a 350 ||'i» estate in Surrey, UK costing over 2 ji illion pounds. President Farooq Ahmed lan Leghari had foreatened to dissolve j! t National Assembly under Ardde 58(2) L )he Constitution, a provision mtroduc^ 'General Zia to dismiss any elected gov' I lUncnt, but since he was referred by ^MCir as \"my man\", few expected him to Vr COMPETITION MASTEB take recourse to foe extreme st^. On September 20,1996, her estranged brother; Murtaza, was killed in a gun batUe with the pdice m Karachi. Relations with her brother were never cordial but had hit a new low when foe administration or¬ dered a crackdown on his faction of foe Pakistan People's Party (PPP). The pohce arrreted a key leader of the group and Murtaza, along with armed supporters, had attacked foe police station. Armed con¬ frontation came a few days later in which Murtaza lost his life. A family tragedy, thus, turned out to be a pohtical nightmare for Benazir. It was alleged foat her husband was behind the kill^. Benazir insisted that her brother was l^ed to destabilise her govemmoit and hmted of army coUusum. As allega¬ tions and counter allegations flew, it was just a matter (rf time before somefoing dras¬ tic happened and Benazir was finally booted out on November 5,1996. What made her survival difficult was foe foct that she was fighting too many people and was increasingly regarded as being haughty. She had b^ fightmg the courts and had been at loggerheads with foe Chief Justice for over six months. She had been Ignoring foe World Bank advice and had even been confronting the Presi¬ dent through political moves. Her attitude smacked of arrogance towards everyone, including foe opposition parties, tire Mus¬ lim League of foraier Prime blister Nawaz Suuief, the Jamaat-e-lslami’and foe MQM. It is believed that no government in Pakistan can survive wifoout the ap¬ proval of foe army. The Present and foe generals, the most powerful eleinents in Pakistan, were gradually losing^pa- tience They felt she had to go because of political insensitivity, corruption, haughtiness and administrative irrepti- tude. The economic crisis made it worse. President Leghari's action had the full backup of foe Army. Pakistan now must pr^re*for elec¬ tions, which it must hold within 90 days, as per the Constitutioa Benazir must prove that she still has support of the people but firere is a feeling foat she has reached foe end of the road and has lost the support of pei^le even in her home province of Sndh. A strong contender for power is former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharief. Both may not be able to contest elections if a new law is passed in Pakistan, which bars those i accus^ofcorruptionftomcontestingelec- tions. A dark horse in the contest may be former cricket captam Imran Khan, who entered pofitics and fontned his Tfehnk Insaf (Movement for Justice). Imran's slogan for a clean govenuirent appeals to the urban youth and those ted up with the country's corrupt political culture His chances increase if the two former prune imnisters are disqualified through the account^il- i^ process. Ihou^ Benazir's dismissal may have provided relief to the people, the situation is volatile. The army has not interfered for the presoit, but if the situation spins out of control of the interim government, it may do so.

Inflation rate has been between 10*13 per cent in the country. , ■ The interim budget was not well te- c^ved and the Federation of Pakistan puunbers of Commerce and Industry en* t^rsed the Opposition's call for a strike. Things became so bad that the President tfueari^ened to impose a financial emergency the IMF said that no elected government in the country could get it out of the eco- AMnk mess that the country faced. Dealing with Corruption 'T)A1QSIAN has gone through tumultous 4- y^us since independence. In 1958, its army chief Mohammed Ayub Khan seized knee and rioting. On December 16,1971, I^dclstani troops surrendered in East Paki* ftan and Bangladesh was formed. Zulfikar Ali %utto won the Presidential elections la 1971 and a parliamentary system of gov- munent was adopted. But in 1977, the Army, led by General Zia-ul-Haq again seized power and Bhutto was hanged on charges of conspiracy to murder. After the death of Zia in a plane crash in 1988, Benazir became die prime minister but was dismissed two years later on charges of corruption. She had lost her grip on power lifter ethnic violence erupted in Sindh. She regained power in 1993 after the dismissal bf Nawaz Sharief, who had replaced her in 1990. * The charges of corruption that have dogged Benazir result directly from the isedvities of her husband, Asif Zaidari. He jhas earned die reputation of being the most jpowerful person in Pakistan, almost run¬ ning a parallel government. During 1988 to 1990, he operated out of an office in the jnirs secretariat, striking business deals bom diere. His activities earned him the name of \"Mr 10 per cent\". He was one of Qje causes that Bi^zir was booted out in the first instance. Hvis time too he held a vice like grip on Pakistan's affairs, report¬ edly making a lot of money. President Le^ari's action may have been justified on account of the many charges against Benazir; sectarian violence had escalated beyond belief and Karachi was in danger of becoming the Beirut of the East. However, should an elected gov¬ ernment be dismissed by the President? It is believed that die President's action lias yanked democracy from the roots even though the interest of the army is against it If the President has the power to dis¬ miss an elected government at any time, it is doubtful diat any government will be able to complete a full term and that de¬ mocracy will be able to succeed in the coun¬ try. What is the sanctity of the people's votes when the mandate can be yanked at any time? On the other hand, it might be a proper way to get rid of a government which is blatantly corrupt. Should the people wait for elections to vote against a leader who is corrupt and ineffective? The goings on in Pakistan have repercussions in India too, which has seen large scale corruption i among political leaders. Or should a stmi- I lar law be enacted here which bars those 1 accused of corruption from contesting elec¬ tions? Given the degeneration that exists in Asian countries, such an extreme step may well be warranted. Democracy should ' not give Icaderii the right to make money I and plunder their countries. Looking Ahead 'PAKffiTAN is infor troubled times. Even X if the elections are held as scheduled, the new govemmait will have to deal with the economic situation. The country is in no mood to bear additional burden. It also cannot rely on IMF loans to baji it out. At the same time, the new government will have to deal witli violence that has become the hallmark of Pakistani politics. The situation in Pakistan is fluid. The widow of Murtaza Bhutto has already taken up flic challenge to become Benazir's rival. The country will undoubtedly see many political alliances. At the same time, next-door neighbour Afghanistan is also going through a pe¬ riod of instability. There will be danger of armed mercenaries, which Pakistan has supported in the past, coming from across the border Relations with India, which have been marked by expulsion of each other's diplomats, have been strained and must be put in the backburner for the time being. The major danger now is that the elec¬ tions have been thrust on a country which can ill afford to have one. It is a crucial time for Pakistan. Will it come out of it successfully and continue its experiment witli democracy, or will it see another dis- menUjcrment’ Pakistan: The TVoubled Years 1947.

India is heavily depen- * * dent on imports for meeting her oil and gas [I reifuirements—over 70 per cent of the total M demand is met by imports—putting heavy strain on the precious foreign exchange re- ^ serves. Coal and lignite have limited reserves U emd ate likely to be available only for a few ^' more decades. Moreover, both coal and oil j have ban witnessing stiff upward revision \\ in the prices, thereby increasing the energy * atst enormously year after year. Other re- newable and new sources 0 /energy like bio- h pB, solar/thermal energy, solar photovoltics 'land wind energy are still in the state of de- I velopment and their commercial use is re- Strkted by many limitations in India Hence Hu heavy reliance on power, both hydel as well as thermal. h !t* Conent Scenario T Ir A ^ conunencement of Eighth Five riXXYear Plan the total installed capacity ^ of the power sector was about 69000 Mega- ^watt (MW) out of which thermal power comprised about 68 per cent of the total .*ccapacity, while the share of hydel power ^ was less than 26 per cent. Installed capac- ;*f tty of the nuclear power projects was just fc 1556 MW which was slightly over 2.5 per •^leent of die total power generation capac- : t^Earliec during die Seventh plan period, total of 21,401 MW capacity was added Jito die existing one,out of whidi 17,093MW }^as in the tho-mal power, 3827 MW in the ^Iiydel and 470 MW m the nuclear power While die target of capacity addi- '^fionin thermal power was overshot, there a serious s^page of s^ut 1700 MW die achievenents of target with respect ' .^d»hydeIpower.Nuciearpowa:tafgets j , f JMtlMfly’SI? COMPETITION MASTER also fell short by 235 MW during the sev¬ enth plan period. Overall achievement of total capacity addition in the power sec¬ tor during die seventh plan, however, was 96 per cent of the target of 22,245 MW for the plan. As per the prelections made in the Eighth Plan document, on the basis of the status of ongoing, sanctioned and new projects in the pipeline, it is expected that an additional capacity of 30,538 MW would be created by die end of the Plan Out of this anticipated addition, 20,156 MW (about two third) would be added m die thermal sector, 9,282 MW in the hydel and 100 MW in the form of nuclear power capacity. If the above targets are achieved as planned, the end of the Plan would witness the share of hydel sector at about 28.5 per cent. This marginal increase m the hydel power share is expected to re¬ verse the trend of declining shar“ of hydel power and it is expected that by the end of Ninth Five Year Han, share of hydel power would increase to about 40 per cent. As per one estimate, the requirement of installed capacity in die power sector by the end of Eighdi Plan would be35,153 MW for the plan period. But considering the expected capacity addition of 30,538 MW envisaged in the plan, and of course some shortfril in the target achievement, the country would be short by over 5,000 MW of installed capacity by end of March, 1997. This also means increasing power cuts and rising cost of power in the years to come. If the cumulative gap between the installed goierating capacity (^99,620 MW and die required capacity of 1,04,235 MW is also taken into account, the total cu¬ mulative gap in the supply and demand would be to the tune of 4,615 MW by the end of eighth plan. The Hydel Solution X ply of the power would have serious repercussions during the ninth plan period. Shortage of power would not only affect in additional industrialisation, but would also seriously hamper the capacity utilisation and productivity of the existing industries. This, in turn, could reflect upon the growth rate of the industries as well as that of the Gross Elomestic Product (GDP). Even the agricultural sector is fast emerg¬ ing as a big consumer of the power. Con¬ trary to the bebef in the Government, nei¬ ther the agriculturists not the industrial¬ ists clamour for subsided or cheajTer power They, instead, are interested in more reli¬ able and regular power supply. A long-run strategy should first aim at mcreasing the share of hydel power With the limited sources of coal, lignite and oil, growing reliance would have to be placed on hydel and nuclear power Except for the heavy initial investment, hydel projects have a definite edge over otiier power plants. India has huge untapped identified potential in the hydel sector. Western U.P. and Himachal Pradesh alone have uptapped identified potential of about 50,000 MW. Almost this much hydel po¬ tential is availaUe in the seven north east¬ ern States. Hydel projects not only provide cheap generation of electricity, but are re¬ newable in nature. In other words, hydel pn^ects have a very low generation and maintenance cost, with cost of tiie input being virtually zero, while cost of input U. coal in the thermal power plants is consid¬ erably high. In addition, hydel pn^ts can also be used to meet ^e requironent of irrigation in the down stream areas, and can also adequately meet the peakmg de¬ mands of power. A few main drawbacks of the hydd prajedsarakKiggestaticmperiod, displace¬ ment of population and damage to the enviiotunent and fntite lamis. There seems to be no escaf« 6»m long-gestation peri¬ ods, but the only precaution which one must take is tiiat no time over-runs should be allowed to take place. Failure to com^ plete the on-going projects in time, not only deprives the eccmomy of the avail- abihty of powe^ but also result in escala¬ tion in the cost of the projects. l^tha view toob^te dte criticism of dispkcment of population and destruc¬ tion of forests and fertile lands, a new con¬ cept is fast epierging in hydel power projects. The focus is now shifting from coitstructing big dams to the \"run-of-the- river\" projects. While dams are preferred in the foothills, so that the area down¬ stream could be urigated also, run-of- the river projects are preferred in the high hills, which are far from plains. Such projects do not require big reservoirs and electricity is generated from the water available in the river at a particular point of time. Ibis does not need to displace any population, on the one hand, and does not atfect the forests and environ¬ ment, on the other. But such projects generally caiuiot increase electricity gen¬ eration to meet the peaking require¬ ments, as is done by the reservour-based hydel projects. Hence, a happy blend of both t^es of hydel projects is recom¬ mend^. Other Strategies TN addition to switdiing over to hydel Jprojects and exploitii^ identSied poten¬ tial, several odter strategies are required to be adopted to overcome die shortage of power and to handle the situation arising out of limited sources (rf coal and oil. An efiiecQve strategy could be to have more munber of atomic power plants, particu¬ larly In Soudwm a^ Cented parts of tihe country where coal reserves ate limited and dKR fe not much of hydel power poten¬ tial. Past breeder technology is available in India and many more plants can come up. Surprisingly, the progress in this fidd is very slow evenon tetininationof die current five year plan, the total installed capacity of nuclear power plants would be about2,800 MW, which would be less than 3 per cent of the total installed capacity in die country. One important limitation of die exist¬ ing power dtetribation system is the Trans¬ mission and Distribution (T & D) losses. The T & D system available in the country is quite ine^ient as well as inadequate. As per the Eighth Plan document, T & D losses, at an average, are 22 to 23 per cent at the national level. These losses occur due to technical teasom as well as dieft and other unaccounted for reasons. There is a need to modernise die distribution man¬ agement of power by using modern tech¬ niques and equipments Efforts should also be made to taiw efidfive steps to bring down the T & D losses to around 15 per cent by the end of Nindi Plan. Participation of die private invest¬ ment in die power sector should be en¬ couraged to bridge die gap between the demand and supply. During the current five year plan, die government opened up the power-generation sector to die private sector participation. It is expect^ that 3,800 MW of power generation capacity would be add^ by the private mvestment during the eighA plan. In the years to come, the government should encourage the private parties to come forward in a bigger way, particularly to set up medium and large hydel projects, in which the government could also be a partner. It should, howevei^ be ensured that the pri¬ vate players do not face bureaucratic hurdles, otherwise no private entrepre¬ neur would like to sink his finances in a long-gestation period project, yielding relatively low rate of return. Encouragement to die non-conven- tional energy sources, also called New and Roiewdile Sources of Energy (NR.^, is also overdue. Several steps have been taken to encourage the generation and use of NRSEs but a lot more is required to be done in this direction. The government agencies fiiould come out of the R A D stage and encourage their commercial use. The government should encourage the use of bio-gas, solar thermal technology, solar photovoltics and energy partioikuly in the farm sector and at the individii consumption levels, so that increasing pA sure cm die conventional power is reduce Most of the areas in India have good p tential for use of solar energy. Similarj areas on the coastal regions and hfliy aff have also been identified for use energy for power gAieratiim, at lei» local level Increasing commerdal uw NRSEs would certainly go a long way scaling down die magnitude of pow shortage. Conclusion P OWER sector is under tremendoi pressure today Most of the'State go emments have State Electricity Boim (SEBs) and bulk of the power suppltedl them is subsidised to a larger extent. Mil of die SEBs are incurring heavy losses U are not able to achieve the preset^ norms of 3 per cent Internal ^te of R turn 0RR). It remains to be seen as to ho the recent direction of the government the SEBs to charge the commercial rate< electricity from all consumers except d farm secten^ is going to be received by d masses as wdl as the industrial sector. B one tiling is certain, f.e. higha cost'^ power in the years to come. Even die xte hydel projects whidi would be con^Ieh during the next about 5-year tinre, f pect the cost per unit of electricity at oV- Rs 3 per unit.

Bd|J long-term projects, it is not likely that I expected gap of 4,615 MW of powet ^ the end of Eig^di plan, would nan^ down during the next five year pitji Nothing would be more unfortunate th the process of industrialisation and velopment getting choked by the shed age of power. E^ent management I existing resources as well as commissid ing of small power projects with a small gestation period of 1 to 2 years hold n key to acomfortableposition.

JANUARY ’S7 COMPETmON MASTER i '.I •'S' » ' jgSSAY [Crime and Violence in Indian Society [ Orlita Public Service Commission 1996 f ' There are differences in the way vio- I Ittnce is discussed. In the West, it is seen 'i to dueaten the smooth conduct of a civil [t JOeiety, where race, drugs and crime are *1 the main problems. In India, media glo- t^kation of violence is seen to endanger ’ sot only a patriarchal system but also an ^ kodtoritanan State—a State which tries ’ to impose order on a society caught be- tween the allure of modernism and the ' tentacles of old traditions. * \"You can slam one manhole cover ' diut, but the force of the sewage will ’ push up somewhere else\", said Bernard Jnghms. If in the good old past, vio- . lence and crime were treated with con- < tempt, they have become a way of life l' with some individuals, groups and . gtmgs. Ironically enough, one feels help¬ less when people who take to crime as I <their natural pursuit are respected a lot I and the locals of all hues give them ail 1 die help they need. Thne are the times r when ^e criminals have begun to think I they will not get caught. If caught, they . f.Svill not be convicted. If convicted, it will ytmly be a light sentence. Looking back VVe can see that it is, in fact, the common ^\\iian who has played a big role in allow- j.^g the criminals to take charge of his •Surroundings * If insurgency, seces$ioni«n and mili¬ ar ^tocy have spread their wings far and wide pted posed a senous threat to the pedity. :?|nie perpetrators of such violence, crime '|)md mass killings, were able to find safe ^niaven among the local people. In a way, V%odi violence and crime receive die much 'Ijfci^ised and publicised sustenance from vdio eitl^ prefer to remain indifier- Of from those who aid and abet them JANUARY '97 COMPETITION MASTER m thw nefanous designs and dubious deeds. Ihe dons of the under-world at¬ tribute much of their sway and success to institutionalised corruption and crimineUsed politics. If violence in the name of caste, community and ethnicity has gained ground and private armies have flourished and flouted all rules of the law book, the fault lies with the political pa¬ tronage that criminals and others of their ilk have come to enjoy m the land of Bud¬ dha, Nanak and Gandhi. A report of the CBI that the inci¬ dence of total cognisable cases in India during 1995 has crossed the mark of five million, or so, proves beyond doubt that both violence and crime, includmg eco¬ nomic crimes, have registered a steady increase in our rural as well as urban areas. Pelf, power and prestige, no mat¬ ter what means are adopted and how many emotions are crushed, have be¬ come the obsessive motives of those who can manipulate the levers and reach the top. In some cases, even the use of bullet, where ballot is the valid way to wrest power, is openly propa¬ gated and practised. Organised violence and pre-planned crime on a big scale had been the bane of many a carnage. How many culprits, criminals, rioters and the like have been punished is still a matter under investigation and litiga¬ tion. In the absence of quick trial and adequate punishment to the actual per¬ petrators of these perversions and their masters behind the curtain, the chain or the vicious cycle of crime and vio¬ lence, whether individual or collective, cannot be controlled, much less erased from the Indian State. Erosion of time-tested values like care, concern and compassion for others and an abominable absence of moral and ethical teachings and ideals among our career conscious youth, are some of the major fac¬ tors that have brought us to the present painful pass Brides being burnt or tor¬ tured for dowry, female child killed be¬ fore or after birth (infanticide), harassment of women at home and at their work¬ place, employment of children m hazard¬ ous industries violation of human rights, use of third degree methods by police, long detention of undertrials and such other aberrations are both symptoms and symbols of violence and crime that have afflicted the Indian psyche with all their virulence and venom The 'great causes' have gone out of our lives and in their place only cold cal¬ culations and career-chasing have be¬ come out possessive passions and pursuits. There is an abhorrent absence of such ideals as can inspire us to see beyond our nose so that we may feel mobvated to create such social clknafo as is conducive, constructive and creative for a more humane social order. Still all is not lost. In order to rejuvenate the Indian minds and stir their sullen soul, the message of 'Ikgore \"Kicks raise dust, not crops\" has to be instilled and lifted into tiidr psyche. Hie place of \"causes\" in the national goals an^ targets has to be recognised and a relentl^ts crusade against dehumanisation of perceptions and piociivittes has to be waged befo» the ti^g deluge of violence, vulgarity and crime overtakes and finally ove^ whelms us all. THIS MONTH YESTERDAY January: Before and After Independence Before Independence In this section we shall focus on some of the events relating with Mahatma Gandhi, &ibhas Chandra Bose and bdian Broadcastmg Mahatma Gandhi Mondts of January registered the active entrance as well as exit of Mahatma Gandhi on the Indian scene. For in* stanffi, on January 9 ,1915 Mahatma Gandhi 'finally' reached Bombay (India), after spending about two decades in South Africa. On January 14,1921 Maha^ Gandhi started Wardha Ashram as a branch of Sabarmati Ashram and it was on January 15,1942 that, while talking about his political successor, he said that my political successor was neither Rajaji nor N^Uabhbhai but Jawahar Lai. After surviving a bomb explosion on January 20,1948 Mahatma Gandhi finally suc¬ cumbed to die bullets of Nadiuram Vmayak Godse on January 30,1948. Subhas Chandra Bose Mondis of January have been quite significant in the life of Subhas Chandra Bose. He was bom on January 23,1897. He was elected President of Indian National Congress during the months of January. FUsdy, on January 17,1938, and later, on January 29,1939, against ^e wishes of Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi wanted Bose to wididraw his name in favour of Dr Pattabhai Sitaramayya as Congress Presidoit. Birdiday of Subhas Chandra Bose has also bem mariced by some nohdite eoitifidences. hi 19% he was sentenced to one-year rigorous imprisonment for taking out a procession on All Bmgal Political Su£^ Day In 19%, a Gazette of India Kctraordinary banned 'Indian Struggle 1920-34' by him. In 1945, at Rangoon, he was weighed in gold on his birt^y. Indian Broadcasting lb shengdien the role of State m the management of Indian State Broadcast¬ ing Service die Indian V\\^reless Telegra- jdiy Act 1933 was worked out The Act was prepared to bridge the loophole which existed in the Indian Telegraphy Act 1885, under which diere was no restriction on die possession of wireless apparatus, but only on its working. Ihe new Act came into force on January 1, 1934. Later the Government of bulia granted two and a half lakh rupees for foe establishment of a station at Delhi. And within a period of two years, on January 1,19% foe Delhi station of foe Indian State Broadcastmg Service b^an transmission. Another landmark was set on Januaiy 18,1939 when foe first inter¬ station relays began between Delhi and Bombay. After Independence The long array of events which hap¬ pened during the months of January included promotion of Chief (rf Army Staff General S.H.F.J. Manekshaw to the rank of Field Marshal on January 2, 1973, sibling of Indo-Pal^tani agree¬ ment at Ikshkent on January 10,1966, deafo of the then Prime Minister Lai Bahadur %astri, at Tashkent on January 11,1966 and election of Indira Gwdhi as party leader on January 19,1966. In this section we shall focus on the changes in die 'Political Map', Trojects' and 'Cricket'. Political Map Some changes have been witnessed m foe political map of foe country during the months of January. For instance, on Januaiy 1,1948 ruteis of foe 25 Orissa States surrendered their jurisdiction and authority to the Government of India. On the fame day in 1950 die 450-year edd Cooch Behar State was merged with West Bengal. Later, on Januaiy 20,1972 foe then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi inaugurated Meghalaya as the 19lh State of India and a new Union Ibrri^ toryofArunachal Pradesh. And the * next day two new States of Manipur/ ' and Tripura were inaugurated by foew Gandhi. Projects During foe months of January, some ambitious projects were started in India For instance, in 1950 at Pooim, Jawahar Lai Nehru opened tiw fust National Laboratory of India. In 19% Dr Rajendra Prasad opened foe Ganguwal Power House to benefit PEPSU, Pur^ Himachal and Rajasthan. In 1962 Jawahar Lai Nehni inaugurated, die first State-owned Oil Refinery project at Noonamati, Assam and next year he inaugurated foe Rihand Dam. In 1965 , Lai Bahadur Shastri laid die foundados stone of Duigapur Fertilizer plant and in 1972 Indira Gandhi inaugurated Ufai Dam near Surat. Cricket Indian cricket has registered some epoch-making moments during foe montiis of January, particularly vis-a-vil' Ravi Shastri and MdAzharuddin. On < Januaiy 31,1983 Ravi Shastri roistered ’ hu maiden century at Karadii. On Janta-. ary 10,1985 at Bcmibay, Siastri sc(^ 36' runs by Mtting six sixes off foe bowlingn Tilak ^ and on Januaiy 5,1992 he sornn 206 runs to register first ever double i century for Ini^ in 48 leite against Austn^ in Sydney.

Unrestricted entry of foreign j^4l|Qnels has resulted in people not only !^Sng glued to televison but copying Western culture and values por¬ ted in the programmes We are, thus, doming clones of the West and forget- M oue own culture. There is surely an ^ent need to restrict the entry of ^ign cultural influences. That is why are so many protests today, not (XJMPETmON MASTER I I I I I only against media but also against cultural events. We have to see things not from the point of the educated elite bi^t from the point of view of the common man. Blatant copying of the West will certainly result in our own culture being sidetracked. Foreign companies are not interested in us except to sell us their products and we become willing targets of their devious strategy Unfortunately, our own people, like the Amitabh Bachchan Corporation, have taken it upon themselves to bring events that harm the country I don’t think there is anyting wrong in protesting and trying to save ourselves from Western cul¬ tural imperialism MrB There are two things in your argument that I find curious. First is the belief that educated elites know right from wrong, while common people do not. This smacks of arro¬ gance: that the culture of common people needs protection. Political leaders like C.M. Ibrahim and Sushma Swaraj have that same arrogance. 1 don't see how it is different from the attitude of certain Islamic nations, which have imposed restrictions on women in trying to protect their culture. Second, though you are right about commercialism, why blame the foreign companies alone? Our own businessmen are no better or worse and are guilty of much the same thing. I do not know what you hope to achieve by policing culture. I don't think that our culture is so weak that It needs protection. We have withstood many influences in the past and can do so even now. By imposing unnecesary restrictions we will only be harming ourselves. MrC Basic to the argument about protecting culture is that our culture is somehow good and Western culture is somehow evil and thus we need protection. I would like to ask what is it in our culture that is so good and what is so evil in the culture of other nations. Our culture today is marked by hypocrisy and dishonesty; corrup¬ tion has become a major cultural feature. Senseless protests have shown that intolerance is fast becoming another feature of our culture. If we say that our culture is so good, how do we explain sati or bride burning? We encourage prostitution in temples and we have a thriving trade in women, as streets in Delhi and Mumbai show. The problem does not go away by pretending that it does not exist. In fact, we need openness so that we can get rid of these social evils. Likewise, can we say that Western culture is bad? They have a different way of life, that's all. Many Western values, like honesty and the achieve¬ ment orientation, can do a world of a good to our society. How can we criticise others when we have so many weaknesses ourselves? MrD I would like to say something about protests. Can we really stop cultural influences by organising pro¬ tests? lb my mind, they are meaningless and ate designed to get nSkUa attention only. If newspapers stopped highllgMing protests, I have a feeling that they will ;,. i;^ ( ■s / k X *v X I / I V.

Moreover, protests do not achieve anything Did they stop ' !i the Miss World irom being held, or the j Michael Jackson show? On the other ( hand, the very politicians who wanted to conserve our culture allowed the Midtael Jackson show when they were 1 assured of monetary benefit. The protests simply disguise the blackmail—pay us or we will oiganise a liartal. The whole < business seems to be dubious. On the , odwr hand, (^rve the achievements of Vour so-called rich culture: look at our ! | progress in science aixl technolgy, our j participation in the Olympic games, our peformance in economic aspects like development in coo^titive industry and world exports. Wherever performance is jjlOKasurable, we have cut a sorry figure. ait contort in things that cannot be imeasured under the umbrella of a rich feulture and take pride in them. It would tdo a world of go^ if we are able to jlook at ourselves and see what is there be proud of. Western influence might 4 j{uBt bring a sotse of competitiveness ilamong us and help us to become a Ination of achievers rather than a nation Lof talkers i 'MrB I agree with you. Besides talking, anoflter trait that we have developed over the years is the Mia hai ijattitude. In fact it is no longer an atti* [ tjtcide now but very much part of our ' i^fsonalities. This has happened be- '^use we have never really competed ^wifh the world. Now we have to de- '^velop openness and a competitive spirit ‘ yio that we can stand beside tlie best in of measurable performance. Till ^ long can we survive by exporting Pi^handicrafts? Out culture, if we have : ^me at all, has been reduced to welcom- j^yng foreign celebrities by having them jl^ygarland^ by beautiful girls wearing I^.'^ees and btndis Apart from that, there Siis fittle else ttiat we can offer. There is [th on our streets, and beggars and its swarm tourist places. Should we content in that’ EI think our pathological fear of cultuie, our xenophobia, comes easily to us. Years of colonial rule have left behind a deep sense of wounded pride and nationalism that makes us into irrational critics, adopting strident tones. It is easy to criticise Amltabh Bachchan, but it is a fact that he has projected the country abroad. Think what would happen if other countries adopted the same stance as ours. Our artists, musicians and performers would not be able to go abroad and perform there. Yet, practically in all fields, our people have gained by going abroad. To give an example, many of our writers are unable to get their books published in India. Foreign publishers often give them the opportunity, as well as inte^ national fame. If they too started this talk about cultural invasion, it will limit our arts to a very great extent. Moreover, Indians have gone abroad and settled there and become successful in many fields. There are beautiful Indian temples abroad. If those coun¬ tries started talking about cultural imperialism too, Indians would not be allowed to live as they do and may even be thrown out from the UK, USA, the Gulf and Africa Who would be the loser? If we treat everything with suspicion and fear and look for subversive motives, the losers will be Indians, not the rest of the world. Protectionism—and that too to pre¬ serve a questionable culture—will only make us fall lower and lower into a mess. IMlf A But you cannot deny that foreign programmes on TV and pop shows do spoil our culture to some extent. Young people acquire the same revealing dresses like the foreign stars and want to be like them. It harms their personality. They also want more freedom, and this creates a rift with their parents. Can we say that the sexual attitudes and revealing dresses featured in these TV programmes go with our culture? Do they not harm us? There is certainly a need to regulate qU that. Look at China. They have allowed ' foreign capital but have not allowed I Wsstern cultural invasion. Certainly we can do something like that too. While we continue to taJee technology and money from the West, we can save our culture. MrB Let us take your argument for the time being and we introduce cultural policing in India. Where do we draw the line then? Today we may find foreign programmes bad, tomor¬ row it may be wearing jeans Today it may be foreign music, tomorrow it may be studying English itself. Gradu¬ ally, our society will go backwards into isolation. Somebody mentioned Islamic nations—but the world is not interested in regimes that look back¬ ward. Many Muslim nations have not been able to attract foreign invest¬ ments and have remained poor coun¬ tries. Also, if we look at countries around the world, only those have done well economically which have a policy of openness. Singapore is an example. MrC I would just like to add about TV programmes. I think that this talk of protecting our culture has only arisen partly to protect our inefficient broadcasting system. Look at Doordarshan—itis unwatchable. Even the news are more interesting to watch on foreign channels as the national TV is content in having press notes read out by matrons. It is almost a pain to watch and there have been no innova¬ tion in their programmes. Does Doordarshan project our culture better? Tbday, it is the foreign chan¬ nels, which have Indianised them¬ selves, that are projecting our culture within and outeide the national boundaries. Our stars get more expo¬ sure abroad and so also our music and our films- Coming back to the concern of our politicians, let me say that our culture and integrity is not under threat from foreign charmels or pop shows but firom ^e uncontrolled corruption by our poMcal leaders. It is time that we stopped fids bogey of cultural invaiicm artd geared up instead to face die world. l<tANt)Any W COMPETITION MASTER c i It PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT Be a Winner, not a Whiner A lter the euphoria ol January, the months roll away, enthiisiam and ela¬ tion scale down. Ideab take a backseat and resolutions get diluted or defeated. Life again assumes its grimness. Frustrations, f^uies and fear stare at us. Conflicts con¬ sume us. The deadly grind of routine takes over Many look upon the last year as a dreary stretch which brought nc^ing but despair or defeat. They are not likely to feel exuberant on the coming of the new year since they are stuck in dte defeatist mental¬ ity. Can this year be made differoitfeom the preceding ones? Can it begin a new and glorious chapter in life? Certainly, it am. You have to shed some moth-eaten ways and have to step out of the mental ruts. Banish the fear of failure. No one can ever hope to achieve anything worthwhile so long as his steps arc dogg^ by the crip¬ pling memories of the past, or is haunt^ by the failure in future You have to shake off inertia. Inertia sabotages all efforts. It cripples determina¬ tion. It kills endtusiasm. I know of a man who has come to nothing in life, despite the weU-meaning resolutions made on new year eves. Every year he said to himself, \"I am going to about a miracle about myself. 1 am going to transform myself this year.\" His inertia overpowered him and it whispered to him, \"What is wrong with your present life? Ysu ate still better dian thousands of c^ers. Why put yourself undiN the yokef* Mb wonder his resolu¬ tions remained pious professions. The fact is that we sddom strive to change out present pattern of living. Even if the desire is diere, ^d hSbits drag us back. The famfliar is mote acceptable ^cause it provides a sense ol security^ Also habits are - v! hard to break. They are shirts of iron! A dramatic change to euphoria is all right for a short time. It is like wearing new clothes on. a gala occasion. It cannot bring a real change. It brings only temporary ela¬ tion of spirits. It carmot last for a year or a longer period. Ybu have to find an enduring basis that will last. Mere wishing of a happy new year; mere clinking of glasses does not bring it It requires a sound and wholesome philoso¬ phy of life, a philosophy which can serve as an atKhor in the storms and stresses of life Inertia usually comes to those who have led a loose and unrestrained life, without self-discipline They are the people who have often given themselves up to their slightest whim. In other words, foey have so spoiled themselves that making resolu¬ tions is nothing better than tearing patterns in the air for them. It is an exercise in futil¬ ity. One may not realise but inertia comes because one is inwardly in love with the present state of affairs. One does not want a change in the present pattern of living. In Bus respect, one is like an addict. Ife knows there m\\ut be a change, but has no coura^ or will bring it about, A friend once told me, '1 have a great desire to be successful. But I often give up my efforts when these are on the verge of becoming a reality. Then I re¬ treat into the ^11 of die life I have been used to.\" This, however, does not mean that we have to plunge into the impos^le. We are ready to face trials wiBi a smile, as it were. We know these are only passing clouds barring the sun of success. I know a man whose physical and nrental sufferings would have driv^ many otherstodespair Of even suicide.

The latter is dangerous because makes you at war with yourself by en- l^vouraging cynicism. If you doubt the ve- i fadty of this simple statement, ask yourself, j ^hat is more satisfying? Life or death? ' Love or hatred? Success or failure? Health lOr disease’\" i Clean your old thinking that you have Wen the victim of adverse circumstances.

If you cannot be a genius, you can ‘ certainly be a hard worker. And widi work, \" even an ordinary man can be a success. It y is said of Raph^, \"He owed more to his ? industry than to his genius \" li* life belongs to you and you are free V to make of it what you will. If you wish to V achieve your ambitions or aspu-ations you T must first visualise where you want to go i and what you want to do with your life. When you have made your choice you must seek the means to encompass the '^methods you must use There is no magic formula for suc¬ cess. Every individual has his own ideas as to what will suit him best. The fame which came to Casanova is vastly diffe^ ent from that sought by an unlettered peasant and rose to be president of a huge industrial manufacturing company. Both succeeded in their own fashion, the former by his amorous prowess, the other by cUmbing the ladder in industry. The one thing they had in common was that they knew what they wanted and went after it with single-minded purpose. Of course, this is an essential to any kind of success. Without a clear-cut idea of what he wants most, a man spends his efforts wastefuily, whereas a methodical concen¬ tration of them will ensure maximum re¬ turns. Thus, it is nece^ary to coUect all the information you can get affecting the goal you have in mind and the various stages you must plan towards realisation. Lack of knowledge about some phase of the prob¬ lem to be solved can only bring failure. Take the case of a budding writer He has just come from the university and de¬ cides to become a novelist. He studies the masters, watches how other people act and react so that he may fashion his characters upon them, that racks his brain for suit¬ able plots He may succeed, but if he fails because his style is poor, his plotting weak and his characterisation out of this world, it need not be the end. Indeed, if he turns to more mundane things like writing informative articles for the popular dailies and weeklies, his talent could be richly rewarded and give him the success he desires as a writer, instead of discouragement and failure in a field for which his temperament is unsuited. Know what you want and seek out die information you need to get it. Act upon it and never surrender when faced with initial disappointment. It may seem a contradiction to assert there is no magic recipe for success and then offer a mufe for it. You can turn die hidden power within you into a positive force which will achieve ambition the unthinking call miracles. \"Unless you follow in father's foot¬ steps, you will have to forge your own success with the tools at your disposal.\" Even that is impossible unless you know exactly where you want to go. Successful attainment of ambitions depends on the goal you set yourself. V\\fe like to be liked. We want others to take interest m us.
