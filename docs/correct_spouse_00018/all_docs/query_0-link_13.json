She also averred that there was no fault from Samrat's end and she has no bitterness as well. \"I had a dreamy idea of marriage. If you are in a bad relationship then it's better to separate. There is no bitterness,\" Manish told an entertainment portal. She further added, \"I take full responsibility of hurrying up and wanting to get married and then realising I am not meant for this. There is no fault from other side, the fault is mine.\"\n\nAlso Read | Sanjay Dutt biopic: Manisha Koirala talks about playing Ranbir Kapoor's mother\n\nOn being quizzed about her plans for second marriage, Koirala stated that she isn't keen to get into a relationship again as she is content with her life. \"At this point I am content with my life and my work.
