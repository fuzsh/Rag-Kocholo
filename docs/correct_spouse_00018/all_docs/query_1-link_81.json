        "text": "June 22nd, 1974. This day will be etched in history forever and I think we have to thank God for it. After all, it marks the birth of one of the finest heroes Tamil Cinema has ever seen, Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar, our one and only Ilayathalapathy. Yes, he may be 45 today, but he as young as ever and it looks like despite his age he will always remain Ilayathalapathy in our hearts. Somehow that name has a special feel to it and like the actor, it will stand the test of time. On his birthday today, we’re going to take a look at why the Samrat of the South Indian Box Office is such a loved and respected ‘Thalaivaa.’ There are many reasons and we’re going to look at them one by one, Thalapathy dialogue-wise. Ready?\n\nOru Thalaivan Uruvagarthuku Oru Yugame Theva Padudhu - When it comes to Vijay, there are still many who cling on to the fact that his father was a director and that’s why he made it big. Correction. Yes, his father was a director and that’s why he got the chance to act in films when he started off. But that’s about it. The reason Thalapathy is at the forefront today with millions of fans is not because of his father, it’s because of his unparalleled performance. And now the actor who is one the most bankable stars in the nation has so many fans filling theatres that they can claim “Namma theatre la un padatha ottina nu vei, screen kizhinjidum.”\n\nAll Arealayum Ayya Ghilli Da - There are very few who can master practically everything and Vijay is one such actor. Whether it's action, romance, comedy, style, dancing or singing, you name it, Thalapathy can do everything. The way he holds our attention with his presence is something not many actors can achieve. Truly when he is on the screen one can’t look anywhere else. He is an absolute visual treat. Looks like the actor who always encourages positivity, came into the industry with the mindset “Vandhirkra edam super, pattaya kelapalam.”\n\nEvlovo Pannitom Idha Panna Maatoma - Vijay is one actor whose personality on-screen and off-screen is completely different. Just how he manages to get into the characters while acting has not only fans but fellow actors also floored. A very reserved and silent person in real life, his roles in cinema are almost always just the exact opposite. Yet he pulls them off so convincingly people who don’t know about him won’t be able to believe the contrast. Maybe because his policy is to speak from the heart and act from the mind.\n\nVaazhkai Oru Vattam Da - Just like anyone of us has in life, Vijay has had his ups and downs in the industry. He has faced tough times with a lot of criticism from sections of the audience. But he rose above everything and proved his worth. In romantic hits like ‘Kadhalukku Mariyadhai,’ ‘Thulladha Manamum Thullum,’ ‘Kushi,’ ‘Priyamaanavale,’ and ‘Sachein,’ the actor proved that he can make us all swoon. And with blockbusters like ‘Friends,’ ‘Thamizhan,’ ‘Thirumalai,’ ‘Ghilli,’ ‘Thirupaachi,’ ‘Sivakasi,’ ‘Pokkiri,’ ‘Thuppaki,’ ‘Kaththi,’ ‘Theri’ and ‘Mersal,’ he proved that he is a man of mass and a superb entertainer who is beyond comparison. After all these films, when you say ‘Bigil’ is releasing on Diwali, all I can say is “I’m waiting!” What about you?\n\nOru Thadava Mudeevu Pannita Yen Pecha Naane Ketka Maaten - Yes, once you've decided that you’re a Thalapathy fan, you’ll always be a Thalapathy fan. That’s the kind of hold he has on the audience. Watching him on screen ‘thulladha manamum thullum.’ I can give you a real-life example. From disliking Tamil movies and not being able to appreciate Vijay’s sheer talent, I now not only love Tamil cinema but am also an avid Vijay fan to the extent of visiting shooting spots multiple times. How did that change happen? It’s because he won me over with his performance. When I saw just what he was capable of as an actor, there was no doubt left in my mind that I had wasted years not watching his films. And now I have watched more films of his than any other actor. I had truly understood the relevance of the dialogue “Yena paathu Tamil Nadula indha kelvi kekra modhal aal nee dhan da.” Honestly, there must be no one in Tamil Nadu who does not know who Ilayathalapathy is, and that shows his success.\n\nVijay is not just an actor, he is a phenomenon. He’s someone who is almost part of our families and has played a strong role in many of our lives. His positivity goes a long way in encouraging his fans. Be it his speeches at events or the dialogues he speaks in films, his meaningful words rings in our ears. “Mathavangala vedhana paduthadha yendha sandhoshamamum thappu illa.” Leaving you with this special dialogue today, we wish one of our favourite actors, our very own Thalapathy Vijay, a very happy birthday. Hope to see him do many more movies that touch hearts and inspire millions."
