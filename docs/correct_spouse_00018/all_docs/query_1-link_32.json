        "text": "***Ellorukkum Vanakkam***\n\n***1997 has begun pretty successfully for Kodambakkam.. despite a few\n\nfalls here and there.. producers and directors are smiling as much\n\nas possible!.. Plenty of kisu kisus, music and movie news to cover!..\n\nSo, arambikkalaama?..\n\n***Velliththirai Vambhugal***\n\nKisu Kisus, Major shandais, jagadaas etc..\n\n***Nadigai Sivaranjani secretly tied the knot with telegu actor Srikanth\n\nrecently!.. Kudiyum kuduththanam-aaga 'jam-munu' irukkiraar yendru kelvi!..\n\n\"Avadhaara Purushan\" padam dhaan oda-villai at least real life AP\n\nkidai-ththu vittaar yendra sandhosham dhaan!.. Congrats Sivaranjani!..\n\n***This 4 + 1 Gundu nadigai-kkum dum dum nadandhu vittaadham!..\n\nKodambakkam vattaara seidhigal say she married a kannada actor top\n\nsecretly somewhere!.. Kushboo-vin thozhi has found her kannada 'Gopala\n\nGopala' after all!..\n\n***\"Nattaamai\" loves \"Mettukkudi\".. Kaadhalo Kaadhal.. avalavu kaadhal\n\nbetween Saratkumar and Nagma today!.. Love muththi poyi, Nagma seems to be\n\nin a constant daze between scenes and takes in her films!.. Podhaa\n\nkurai-kku yekka chakka phone calls!.. Producers are crying their eyes out\n\npaying their phone bills!.. Meanwhile, lucky for Sundhar C. who directs\n\n\"Janakiraman\" with Sarat and Nags.. and T.Siva who produces \"Aravindhan\"\n\nwith both of them.. phone bill pozhachudhu!.. Other producers are also\n\nfollowing the same formula!.. \"Ragasiya Police\"-il arambiththa kaadhal-aa\n\nirukkumo?.. Aaga Chaaya-vin wrath-ai paarkkaamal iruvarum kaadhal-ai\n\nniruththa povadhillai!.. Unfortunate but true, that Chaaya Devi (Sarat's\n\nwife) and his children are living in a seperate home, away from Sarat's\n\nbungalow currently. Chaaya hopes avar purushan thirundhi avaridame\n\nvaruvaar!..\n\n***The Mani story.. with not so 'mani-yaana' beginnings, middles and\n\nends.. It appears three nadigars are thoroughly ecstatic that \"Iruvar\"\n\nmannai kavvu-vied at the box office!.. Producer Ramanathan-in dosth\n\noruvar!.. He nicely nazhuvified from signing the film by claiming he had\n\ncall sheets problems.. Plus, he figured he would lose the good acquaintance\n\nof a big V.I.P., if he had accepted and acted in the \"Thamizh Selvan\"\n\nrole.. Add to this our \"Nag\" priyar, who disagreed with Mani over money\n\nmatters and refused the role! Last by not least, the man who ran to\n\nshootings whenever he was called, only to find himself in one 'dhamma\n\nthundu' scene in the film!.. \"Indhiyan\" T.V.-yil keesiyavar-aaga\n\nirukkalamo?!..\n\n\"Iruvar\" drove plenty of distributors in the red, and they have started\n\ndemanding an early release of Mani's \"Nerukku Nerr\" (Direction: Vasanth)\n\non April 14th, Tamil New Year's Day!.. Since distributors are irukki\n\npidichching Mani and Vasanth, they have planned a month long tight\n\nschedule for the month of March, in order to release the film in April!\n\nIdharkku idai-yil Ajeethkumar backed out of the film, claiming he would\n\nhave tremendous call sheet troubles especially with the 'one-month-straight'\n\nshooting!.. Guess, who replaces Ajeeth.... Prabhudeva!.. Well, PD is no\n\nlonger in consideration for the role, as newface Surya, son of actor\n\nSivakumar makes his entry to replace Ajeeth in the film!..\n\nThe minute this change occurred, Vijay and daddy S.A.Chandrasekaran went\n\ninto serious discussions with Mani about pulling out of the film!..\n\nAccording to father and son, the only reason Vijay went along with acting\n\nin \"Nerukku Nerr\" with Ajeeth, was the great reception the team received\n\nfor their work in \"Raajavin Paaravaiyile\" (Wonder when this happenned?)..\n\nNow, Paavam Mani, he not only has to deal with the 3 Crore loss he\n\nencountered in making \"Iruvar,\" but sari kattu-fy his distributors and\n\nconvince Vijay and his dad to stick around in order to complete the film\n\nby the April 14th deadline!.. Well, the scarier thing is Surya (PrabhuD\n\ntata!) has to make up 18 days of shooting that Ajeeth had completed before\n\nthis departure!..(\"Madras Talkies\"-kkum Mani-kkum 1997 aarambam avalavu\n\n\"Anandham\"-aaga illai!)\n\n***No more \"Santhosh\"am for Mohan!.. Oru kaallaththil mike-ai pidiththu\n\nkondu kalakkiya Mohan.. decided to make his comeback into tamil movies by\n\ndirecting his own film.. With these hopes, he went to sign Arjun.. Arjun,\n\nas busy as he is.. offered a script instead of his call sheet dates.. The\n\ndeal was agreed upon that Mo. pay Arj. a sizeable sum and give him\n\nrecognition in the titles as the story writer!.. All thrilled, Mohan gave\n\nhim the promised money.. yenna script dhaan kai-kku varavillai!.. Mo. got\n\nimpatient and angry.. He barged into Arjun's house, fought with him and\n\nwalked out with his money!.. \"Santhosh\" stands as is.. as 'mike' nadigar\n\nfigures out what to do next!..\n\n***Producer Henry-naale shandai dhaan endra nilamai-kku vandhu vittadhu!..\n\nWhen he first began \"Kolangal,\" the film was supposed to star Arvind\n\nSwamy and be directed by Bharathan!.. With a few weeks of publicizing the\n\nnews, both As and Bharathan dumped the film on their own accord!.. Yedho\n\njagada nichchayam nadandhirikku!.. Now, Henry successfully completes and\n\nreleases \"Bharathi Kannamma\" which has been busting competition to pulp..\n\npudhu vathanthis appear!.. Director Cheran's name was left out of several\n\nprinted posters of \"Bharathi Kannamma.\" Instead of directly apologizing to\n\nCheran, Henry avar mel oru paai paanju vittaar!.. Henry said: He spent too\n\nmuch money and killari-fied so much more anxiety for Parthiban and some\n\ntrouble with the protesters, which Henry had to eventually settle!..\n\nInstead of gettin angry in return, Cheran kept his cool and said: I don't\n\nwant to embarass or hurt Henry, by answering his allegations. After all,\n\nhe did introduce me as a director. I will make another hit film soon and\n\ndedicate it to him.. (Maybe M.S.V. Murali and Director C.Ranganathan can\n\nlearn a lesson or two from this?!)..\n\n***Thirai Isai News***\n\n(Kutti News)\n\n***Israth, A.R.Rahman's sister, who made her singing debut under Sirpi's\n\nmusic direction in \"Mettukkudi\" got married to reporter Bismi, with\n\nblessings and a large house as a wedding gift, from her bro!.. According\n\nto Bismi, \"Israth is the second best singer after Bhavatharini today\"..\n\nThe happily married Israth looks forward to singing in more songs and\n\nestablishing herself. It appears that A.R.Rahman has indeed signed some\n\nkind of record deal with Sony. A non-filmi album is expected for release\n\nin 1997. Details on the record deal still remain sketchy.\n\n***There seems to be some kind of pugaar against Karthik Raja recently.\n\nRomba bandha panni kollgiraar yendru kelvi!.. With numerous music\n\ndirectors, ARR, Deva, Sirpi, Vidhyasagar, S.A.Rajkumar, T.Rajendar,\n\nR.Anand, Swararaj, Ranjeeth, Shah, and his own brother Yuvan Shankar in\n\ncompetition with each other, magazines are puzzled at these types of\n\npugaars against a growing artist like Karthik!..\n\nThe pugaars aside, Karthik Raja is eagerly looking forward to his next\n\nalbum \"Ullaasam,\" which might make its appearance for Tamil New Year's\n\nDay!.. After quite a lot of pidivaadham and convincing, Prabhudeva agreed\n\nto sing a rap song with Kamalahassan's daughter Sruthi for \"Ullaasam\".. PD\n\npleasantly surprised himself when the final product was presented to\n\nhim!.. Moreover, Daddy Ilaiyaraja sings along with daughter Bavatharini in\n\na song \"Yaaro Yaar Yaaro\" under Karthik's direction, for the first time..\n\n(Close your eyes to \"Ye Vangikodi\" in \"Ponnumani\".. it probably doesn't\n\nqualify since Karthik was not a full-fledged music director then!)..\n\n***Nee munaale ponaa.. naan pinaale vaaren!.. Poor Israth waited for her\n\nbro ARR to give her a chance to sing under his direction!.. Tired of waiting,\n\nshe went and made her debut in \"Mettukkudi\" under Sirpi's music\n\ndirection.. Now enter Bhavatharini.. probably tired of singing only under\n\nher brothers' and daddy's music direction.. has signed to sing with\n\nHariharan: \"Alps malai kaattru vandhu nenjil veesudhe\".. under Sirpi's\n\nmusic direction for \"Thedinen Vandhadhu\"..\n\n***Annamalai Cine Arts' \"Arunachalam\" has been in the spotlight ever since\n\nit was launched about two months ago.. Idhil adhiga kushi-yaaga\n\nirukkiravar Deva.. Andha kushi-yil vandha paadalgal:\n\nIn the tradition of \"Autokaran,\" comes yet another S.P.B. solo:\n\n\"Arunaachalam Naan Dhaanda\n\nArunaachalam naan dhaanda\n\nAnnai Thamizh naattil naan\n\nanaivarukkum sondhamadaa\n\nUppu potta aall marapadhillai-yadaa\n\nAana thappu senja aalla viduvathillai-yaadaa\"\n\nThe other 'Deiveega' padal..\n\nMaththaadu Maththaadu Mallige\n\nMaththaadu Maththaadu Mallige\n\nAmbujam.. Pankajam.. Ranjitham.. Senbagam..\n\n\"Arunaachalam\" releases with another 3 songs besides these.. April 14th,\n\n1997!.. Less than a month from now!..\n\n***Jaaali!.. Seems like every music director in Kodambakkam has something\n\nto smile about in 1997.. especially someone like Sirpi!.. With Sundhar C.\n\nand R.B.Choudhri films carrying Sirpi to great heights last year.. ippo\n\nyennadaa-na new films kuvindhullana.. including \"Janakiraman\" under\n\naasthana director Sundhar C., Gurudhanapal's \"Periya Idaththu Maapillai,\"\n\nSivashri Pictures \"Thedinen Vandhadhu\" with Prabhu, a film for Pyramid\n\nNatarajan, Ibrahim Rauthar's \"Dhinamum Ennai Gavani,\" Livingston's\n\n\"Unakkum Enakkum Kalyanam,\" A.L.Azhagappan's \"Ini Ellam Sugame,\"\n\nBharathiraja's \"Vakkapatta Bhoomi,\" and \"Raasi\" with Ajeethkumar!.. Even\n\nthough his music in \"Kaathirundha Kaadhal\" went unnoticed, Sirpi does have\n\na lot to look forward to this year!.. \"Azhagiya Laila.. thirumbi varuvaala?\"\n\n***\"Achu Vellame\" from the film \"Sakthi\" with music by newcomer R. Anand\n\nseems to have lifted quite a few eyebrows with curiosity and excitement in\n\nChennai.. Though the film did not fare well at all, R. Anand might have\n\ngot his big break and will utilize it in Bharathiraja's \"Siragugal\n\nMurivadhillai\"!.. Speaking of big break, Soundharyan who has been\n\npushed down into B and C grade films happens to be busy, regardless of\n\nwhat we think!.. He composes for the \"Conductor Mappillai,\" (Murali,\n\nDevayani, Swathi), \"Cheran Chozhan Pandian,\" \"Pattakaran\"-another Murali\n\nflick, and the Ranjith-Vikram-Saravannan-Swarna film \"Sundaram +2\".. Best\n\nof Luck for 1997!..\n\n***Last but not least, \"thaththuva paadal\" sung by Actor Karthik and\n\nSwarnalatha for \"Shishya\" under Deva's music direction:\n\n\"Apollo Apollo\n\nVinveli-kku pogudhu\n\nKaadhal dhaan\n\nAeroplane-il mei-silirkka pogudhu\"\n\n***Virudhugal***\n\n(So early in '97?)..\n\n***Ajantha Fine Arts and Bharath Social Cultural Academy gave out their\n\nannual best artists' and film awards on January 1st, 1997!.. It appears\n\nthat this is an New Year tradition for these academies!.. Unforunately\n\nthey don't tell us the criteria used to judge who receives these awards..\n\nAjantha Fine Arts:\n\nBest Actor: Prabhu\n\nBest Actress: Meena\n\nBest Actress (Spl. Award): Nagma\n\nBest New Face (male): Abbas\n\nBest New Face (female): Swathi\n\nBest Character Actor: Vijaykumar (Vanitha received the award on behalf of\n\ndaddy!)\n\nBest Character Actress: Vadivukarasi\n\nBest Villain: Anandharaj\n\nBest Film: Avvai Shanmugi\n\nSpecial Awards: \"Ullaththai Allithaa\"\n\n\"Sundhara Purushan\"\n\n\"Gokulaththil Seethai\"\n\nBest Director: K.S.Ravikumar\n\nBest Lyricist: Vairamuthu\n\nBest Story Writer: R. Selvaraj\n\nBest Cinematographer: Ilavarasu\n\nBharath Social Cultural Academy Awards:\n\n(Idhu allavaa interesting choices!..)\n\nBest Actor: Prabhudeva\n\nBest Actress: Ramba\n\nBest Actor (Spl. Award): R. Pandiyarajan\n\nBest Film: \"Indhiyan\"\n\nBest Character Actor: Vijaykumar\n\nBest Character Actress: Manjula\n\nBest Music Director: Deva\n\nBest Lyricist: Vairamuthu\n\nBest Singer (Male): S.P.Balasubramanium\n\nBest Singer (Female): Swarnalatha\n\nBest Comedian: Vivek\n\nBest Comedienne: Kovai Sarala\n\nBest Dialogue Writer: Balakumaran\n\nBest Cinematographer: Jeeva\n\nBest Villain: Radha Ravi\n\n***Tamil Movie News***\n\n(Kutti News)\n\n***Ambika is back, after almost a year of begging and pleading.. she\n\nfinally stars as one of Sathyaraj's two wives, (Kovai Sarala being the\n\nother).. in Gurudhanapal's other 'Periya' film.. \"Periya Manushan\"..\n\nManivannan has been complaining for a while that he hasn't had time to\n\nstar with Sathyaraj in a film.. but considering Gurudhanapal cannot make\n\na film without the pair (\"Thai Maman,\" and \"Maaman Magal\").. surely,\n\nManivannan-in aasai nirai-veri vidum.\n\n***Actress Jayashree is also making a comeback (though Ramarajan wishes\n\nto call it just an \"udhavi\") in \"Vivasaayi Magan\".. Who knows what has\n\nhappenned to old actresses in recent time.. they seem to be coming back in\n\nhoards all of a sudden.. Whether inspired by Jay, Ambika or Jyothilakshmi,\n\nactress Latha returns to the silver screen in \"Ponn Villaiyira Bhoomi\" and\n\n'Venniraadai' Nirmala has all the luck, as she stars in P.Vasu's \"Vaaimaye\n\nVellum\" and Rajini's \"Arunaachalam\"..\n\n***T.Rajendar is back in the news, as well!.. After a few dismal films\n\nlike \"Thaai Thangai Paasam,\" T.R. has gone back to ilamai.. ilamai..\n\nilamai themes again.. He seems to have signed Prabhudeva, Manthra, and\n\nKalyankumar's son (name unknown) for his film \"Ilam Kaadhalargal\"..\n\nAanaalum idhu podhaadhu polirrukiradhu!.. T.R. is seriously trying to sign\n\nManisha Koirala to star in the film!.. He has also begun another project\n\ntitled \"Monisha\" with one hero and three heroines.. As usual, the\n\nastaavadhaani is at work: Story, Screenplay, Dialogues, Cinematography,\n\nMusic Direction, Lyrics and Direction by T.Rajendar.. His son Chilambarasan\n\nhas already sung a song \"Monalisa unakku kissu tharuvala\" under his\n\nfather's music direction!..\n\n***R.V.Udhayakumar is recovering from his losses in \"Subaash\" in a nice\n\nway.. He is trying to sign Vijayashanthi to star in his film.. It just so\n\nhappens Vijayashanthi is up to her neck in film making with not much spare\n\ntime!.. Interestingly, people still don't know why Arjun neeki-fied her\n\nfrom \"Thaayin Manikodi\".. Sathyaraj has recently declared that he feels\n\nreally old compared to all these newcomer 'ilam' nadigargal!.. He has\n\nchanged his policy.. From now on, he wishes to stay with the youthful\n\ntrend and have at least one 'young one' in each of his films co-starring\n\nwith him!.. Abbas will co-star in M.G.Pictures' \"Unnai Vida-maatten\" and\n\nAjeethkumar in \"Pagaivan\" with Sathyaraj!.. Market-ai eppadiyaavadhu nilai\n\nniruththa vendaama?!..\n\n***Eeshwari Rao isn't too thrilled today.. not because she debuts in Balu\n\nMahendra's \"Raman Abdhulla\".. but because she was tossed out of John\n\nAmritaraj's \"Koottaali\".. Everybody's guess is the 'kavarchi' factor.. and\n\nshe refused to expose.. or so it appears!.. Rajshree has been signed for\n\nthe role.. though some predict that she might also be kicked out too and be\n\nreplaced by Heera.. Rumour.. rumour.. everywhere!.. Incidentally, Heera\n\nstars in a Balu Mahendra film, which is scheduled to begin soon after\n\n\"Raman Abdhulla\" hits theatres in Feb '97!..\n\n***Vinitha has finally found her way to Chennai again!.. Jujulipaa had\n\nspent quite some time in Kannada films, before tamil offers brought her to\n\nKodambakkam once again!.. She currently stars with Mansoor Ali Khan in\n\n\"Vettu Onnu Thundhu Rendu\" (Director C. Dhinakar), \"Vidivelli\" with\n\nSurya, \"Samrat,\" \"Sivappu Nila,\" \"Naan Oru Indhiyan\" and \"Ponnuvilaiyira\n\nBhoomi.\" Vinitha sila very interesting matters discuss pannar, in her\n\ninterview with Cinema Express recently. She said another poraamai\n\npidiththa nadigai had declared that Vinitha could only do glamourous roles\n\nand could never do good roles ever!.. Incidentally, this nadigai has a\n\nreputation for extremely skimpy clothing in tamil cinema.. In some ways,\n\nshe was the one who set the 'kavarchi' trend!.. Though Vinitha hesitated\n\nto divulge her name.. kandu pidikkardhu romba simple.. \"Sa.....\" nadigai!..\n\n***Special Thanks to Sridhar Seetharaman for his information on the\n\nARR-Sony Deal and Satish Subramanian for his info on the Sarat-Nagma love\n\naffair!..\n\nTO BE CONTINUED..\n\nMy Sources: Cinema Express, Anandha Vikatan, Kumudham..\n\nSandya..\n\n********\n\nTamil Movie News can also been seen at:\n\nhttp://www2.ntu.ac.sg:8000/~sf918168/mayajaal.html\n\n********"
