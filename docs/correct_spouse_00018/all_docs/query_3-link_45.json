Rama foo. Further, the comparison was super- fluous, revealinK that there was nothing much to write about ANR as an artiste. In facU both ANR and NTR were nurtured into superstars by really talent- ed directors like the late C. Pulliah, K- Pratyagat- ma and B. Nagi Reddy in the golden era of Telugu cinema. Even in the socials, in which the writer raves about ANR's non-existent artistry, it was NTR who did better, himself direct- ing some purposeful socia- ls within the box-ofRee for- mat like TodudonggaJu early in his career and later, Talla PeUamk, Koddudiddina Kapuram (his 200th film) and Ummadi Kutumbam, all I of which were big hits. The contention that ANR excelled NTli in mythologicals, too, rings hollow. ANR does not have the personality or voice quality that NTR had for such characters. ANR himself was aware of this. In fact, only the late S.V. Ranga R^ could excel both of them be it in socials or mythologicals. ANR was time and ag^n overshadowed by another talented artiste in lelugu cinema, K. Jaggiah. V.

But there were no spectral visitations, md gradually the discordant nocturne became an accepted descant to the creak Mid groan of the old mansion as4t settled :o rest after the bustle of tlie day. The piano played on, unnoticed. And then one day its secret was revealed. It seemed that my grandmo- :her, known for her eccentricity, was giv- ?n to concealing titbits of food for her w)n, my father. Convinced that he was aeing starved, she had turned the piano into a secret la;-der, unknown to anyone ’’No,” I replied. **¥00 know Ray's Cal- cutta, not mine.” Anyone who has ever been there has his own Calcutta. All you have to do is listen to it, as I have listen- ed to mine. T unkk! it is a sound unique to Calcutta, in the quiet of dawn or the still of night. The sound of a brass rickshah-bell. Even the manic roar of noonday traffic cannot drown out its insistent counterpoint. He is short and slight, no more than five feet and two or three inches in his bare, splay-toed feet. The spare frame is wiry with stringy muscle and his work- thickened hands seem too big for thin arms and stooping shoulders as he cups a bidi to his mou^. His creased face is sunburnt and leathery, the comers of Around midnight, he rattles the rick- shah through the narrow lanes behind Ripon Street to a late night dhaba for a meal of chappatis and dal and. as a once- a-week indulgence, a little meat. Then, the brass bell clanking out of habit, he wends his way through deserted streets to Taltolla where he shares a room with 24 other rickshah pullers, paying a hundred rupees a month for sleeping space. Tomorrow is another long day. Nabud Ali left his muluk near Muzza- farpur, where his family are sharet:roi> pers, to earn a regular income in the city. He had never seen a man-drawn rick- shah before. He gazes into the smoke from his bidi, trying to recall the past. \"ITie street lights were very small and dim. And the roads were quiet and not full of holes and ditches as they are now. Between Two Worlds except herself and the mice who ventur- 'd out at night to feast off the hidden deli- :acies, scampering over the keys and fili- ng the house with eerie music. As a child, my favourite story of the nany my mother told me was that of the ghostly piano, playing by itself in an old louse and haunting it with its uncanny lirs. 'Die image stayed with me. coming 0 mind again when I began to think ibout this book. In many ways, Calcutta — or at K'ast. he Calcutta I knew — found an apt meta- )hor in a derelict, tuneless piano: once trand and imposing, but now consigned o cobwebs aqd memories; difficult to iccommodate in any practical scheme of hings, yet defiantly enduring; pathetic o some, poignant to others, sufficient to tself. Over the years, Calcutta has played a nedley of themes for me. as haphazard ind helter-skelter as befits a chance created city. Many of the passages have )een harsh and jarring, some nostalgic, lot a few quirky and off-beat. But all of hem have been meant only for me. Years ago a fellow guest at a party in Greenwich Village, New York, told me hat when he visited Calcutta, Saty^it ^ showed him around the city. \"I bet I mow your Calcutta better than you do,** lesaid. Some cities have a great past; some a yeat mture. Jug Suraiyas Calcutta has the hide worlde charm, but will it survive? Illustrations: Samir Biswas the eyes crow-footed with deep wrinkles through squinting at the glare. His name is Nabud Ali, **You can say about 50 years old,\" and he has been a Calcutta rickshah puller for the past 30 years. A typical day in the life of Nabud Ali starts at 4 pm, just before the evening rush hour begins. Wearing a faded check lungi and a loose cotton vest, he takes a rented rickshah, No.56, out into the streets. He works till past midnight, carrying five to 10 fares on an average shift, earning between Rs 20 and Rs 40. \"Late in the evening I wait near the Perk Street crossing. The sahibs coming out of the big hotels then are usually in a good mood. Sometimes they gWe as much as five, »x rupees for amort ride.\" My meals would cost only five or six paise. And the Gora sahibs were very free with money.\" Thirty years later, little has changed in Nabud's life. His people are still sha- recroppers in Muzzafarpur, and he still does not own the rickshah he pulls. \"Yes, 1 would like to own my own rick- shah. But a new one costs Rs 8,000.\" His eyes widen as he hears himself mouth such an astronomical figure. \"Where will I get that much money from?\" The sar- dar who collects the money every (jay for the owner, who has about 150 rickshahs, charges a daily rental of Rs 12. The pul- ler's licence costs Rs 5 and annual rene- wal at the vehicles department costs a rupee. He tries to send at least a hundr- ed rupees home every month, but doesn't always succeed. Nabud does not think of his work as degrading. \"Some push thelas, others wash cloAes or sweep floors. I pull a rick- shah. What is there to fec*l bad in that? It is only a way of filling one's belly.\" Besi- des, like everyone ^Ise who comes to live and work in the Mahanagar, the Great City of dreams, 'Nabud Ali has one story of which he is the hero. Nabud's story took place late on a miny night when the bus coming in from the airport broke down on the flooded streets. Among the stranded passengers was Chuni Goswami, the legendary soc* cer star. Nabud has never been to a foot- ball match, but he had no difficulty in recognising the famous face. Football is Calcutta’s passion, and even the meanest pavements are alive to its magic. Nabud agreed to get Chuni home, all the way to Lake Gardens. Bui wading through knee-deep water, he felt his streng^ flagging halfway there. Sensing this, Chuni leapt from the seat, and insist- ed that Nabud get in and let him pull the rickshah. And so the two of them took turns, hauling the rickshah and each other through the submerged city. When they reached I^ke Gardens, Chuni’s wife cooked them a hot meal. Chuni suggested that Nabud spend the night there, but the rickshahwallah decli- ne and set off on his long way home. That is Nabud Ali’s stoi^. and to him it doesn’t matter at all it never happened. Nabud has two sons, the older one \"must be 12 or 14\". Neither is literate; both work in the fields. His wife and sons have never been to Calcutta, never seen a rickshah puller's life. 'They don’t know how hard it is,\" says Nabud. \"I would never let my sons become ricksha- hwaliahs.\" Yet he has no plans for their future. \"Perhaps,\" he says with sudden, almost childlike, hope in his voice, \"some big person will give them a job. employ them...\" Tlie words falter as the vision fades. Nabud does not know how long he will be able to continue such demanding work. He is getting old. ’'Perhaps ano- ther two or three years,\" he says, \"as long as 1 can manage.\" The lungs, he knows, are the first to go. When that hap- pens. he will go back to the constant anxiety of a sharecropper’s life. But now he is still a rickshahwallah, proud of hisr skill and stamina. “I can still take passengers all the way from central Calcutta to Howrah or Bally- gunge. Or sometimes, three of them ins- ist on getting in. But 1 can manage. It was far more difficult when 1 began. I was young then, but not used to such work. It was heavy, very ti*-ing. Now it comes easily enough.\" A veteran, Nabud is wily in the ways of the city. He knows its many moods and rhythms, the hazards and possible dangers. Bobbing and weaving through traffic-snarled streets, between thunder- ing walls of steel, he has never so far had a major accident, he says, briefly touch- ing his palms together in thanksgiving. Nor. despite the late and lonely hours of his work, has he ever been waylaid or robbed. But he has several times had trouble with the police. 'They said it was a ‘No Entry’ road. It is always some- thing.\" He had to pay five rupees on each occasion. The memory of the loss causes a wince of pain. Nabud is aware of politics but not parti- cularly interested. \"All this business of which government comes in and which goes out means very little to people like us. They come and go. our work is the same.\" He pinches out the stub of his bidi and puts it away, then picks up the shafts of his rickshah and clatters off in search of a fare, the brass bell jingling. A good passenger could mean mutton curry for dinner. 1 hoped 1 was a good passenger for Nabud Ali, once a week, for almost two years. The first time, I said 1 would pay full fare, but walk beside the rickshah. not get in. I’m a rickshahwallah. said Nabud. not a beggar. 1 got in. Don’t lean forward, it’s harder for me that way. said Nabud. Lean back. I settled back against the plastic cushion as we rattled through the night, tumbrel to a revolution that would never come, not here, not pn these streets where 30,000 Nabud Alis daily ply their trade, pulling for all their life is worth. T here are no arrivals here, no departures. \"Just call me Fitus, pal. Fitus, you know, like in ‘fight’.\" That’s the only name he is known by in the small, shadowy, often violent world that is the only home he has ever known — a place as oddly named as he himself; Wellesley Second Lane, Calcutta. It is just that. A ten-minute walk from the fashionabli shops and restaurants and neon lights o Park Street, it is a social and econonw dead-end. Bypassed by the city, it is ; place of decrepit houses and decayini dreams; a haunt of junkies, petty thieves street fighters, alcoholics, matka run ners, out-of-work band boys trying to ge it together and knowing they can’t. an< jockeys who will never ride again. It is a place where neither fools no angels would care to tread. Small, huddl ed houses with windows that seem admit darkness rather than light line th< narrow street, leaning tiredly agains each other. There are no pavements fo there is no space for them. ITie residen pariah dogs and drunks prowl the stree with impunity, unafraid of traffic. Fo who would bring a car in here, and why An old man in a dirt>' vest hunches ove a rickety balcony and looks out a nothing. A street hawker selling churai and pickles cuts through, ignoring lh< low growls of the dogs at his trespass He knows he is unlikely to find custon here, even for his paltry wares. There ii a quietness about the place, a stillness o despair. But it is a deceptive languor For like a dead nerve suddenly stung t( the quick, the nexus of lanes and gulliei in the area can erupt into violence over j pinprick. That’s when the hard boys liki Fitus come into their own. He doesn’t look like he’s be much us< in a brawl. Like his street, he seems stun ted and wizened. Years of under nourishment have made him lean almost scrawny, 'fhe sun has bleachec his hair till it is a faded khakhi, like thi colour of his eyes or his scuffed, canvw shoes. But there is a taut wariness ii him, a cunning agility taught by th< tough school of the streets and unhampe red by the superfluous weight of forma education. However, though he i obviously proud of his refutation, ant knows that it is a useful thing to have ii his domain. Fitus doesn’t like to tall about his battles. \"Yeah, there’s, fight: going on all the time. I don’t like to fight But my friends, you know, they call m when there’s trouble, when some bus gers get ftinny with them. Then See Fw to go and help them, being ray friend and air Fitus is almost sure of how old he is \"Yeah, like 111 be 23 this year.\" He doei not know the wliereabouts of his fathe and cannot redly remember him. lives with his moflier, grand*mother, ; grand-aunt, several brothers, sisters am cousins in two maSi rooms widi a tii roof and a packed earth floor, and will no kitchen or lavatory. A common priir in the courtyard serves about dx ftuni lies, mainly poor Anglo-Indians, Vk Fltus's folks, tvho form the nuyor part o he local population. They are the resi- iue of the large Anglo-Indian communi- y which once lived in Calcutta. Almost ill who could have emigrated, leaving >ehlnd those who have nowhere to go. As shortage of physical space makes it mpossible for Fitus to stay indoors except when he is actually sleeping or mating, his real home is the street where le spends almost all his waking hours. \\part from being a necessity, this is also ^ood for business. Of course, Fitus ioesn’t call it that. He has \"friends” aiid le can \"fix things\". Things like casset- es, cigarette lighters, watches and the K'casional camera or tape-recorder. ’You want anything you let me know. Like it might take a little time, you know. ■ i ' ' . ’\"‘M : \" but ril get it for you.\" Fitus does the preli- minary work for his “deals” in ram- shackle, hole-in-the-wall joints like “The Thake”, as it is known to those who have to know it. It has tables and benches of rough, linpainted wood and a regular clientele of foreign hippies, trippies, touts and the assorted flotsam of the city that has drifted into this hidden backwa- ter. Hot sweet tea in thick glasses is ser- ved, and toast sprinkled with sugar. But the main draw is the ganja and charas cigarettes that are available under the counter. Rumours and gossip pass around with reefers and sharp ears can pick up a tip and make a connection. It is an area of rudimentary economy where an order for an omelette can be a mark of affluence and where prices are often still talked about in annas. Yet, strangely enough, the right word can open up a subterranean cavern of modern-day treasures. The actual deals are very seldom if ever conducted here, nor are potential buyers brought to the place, where the complicated logistics are worked out. You go with so-and-so to such-and-such's place and pick up the stuff and take it to that one’s house, and ril come there to collect it and lake the other guy along to make the delivery. Complex, but it might explain why Fitus has no police record — or so he claims. F itus made one of his most profitable deals here. Someone had heard about someone who was told by someo- ne who knew about a chap who wanted a two-in-one tape player. Fitus passed the word along the line that he could sup- ply — a Grundig for 1,400 bucks. Word fil- tered back that the man would go up to only 1,200. Fitus was desperate. The next day was race day and he needed money to chase the big bonanza he knows that one day he just has to win. So he took the set and went to meet the man. The man sensed Fitus’s need. The set wasn’t in good condition, twelve was too much for it, he would only give ten. Fitus wanted to get up and go, but the man opened his wallet and began to count ten 100 rupee notes. Fitus couldn’t take his eyes off the money. It lay on the table, hypnotising him. He grabbed it and darted for the door, turned and came back. ”You want cassettes for that, you let me know, OK?” Then he was gone. The next day. of course, he dropped the thousand at the tracks. The tip the ex- jockey had given him had not been quite so hot after all. And it turned out that he had pinched the Grundig set from his Aunt Hester, who runs a brothel on Sud- dcr Street. But what the hell, as Fitus would say. A guy’s got to try, hasn’t he? Besides Hester is by far the best off in the family, has a prosperous establish- ment, red-dyed hair and a pet monkey who bites unwary clients on their backsi- des. She can afford twenty new Grun- digs. And Hester, who comes from S^ond I.ane herself, though that was a long time ago, has forgiven Fitus. Except on the occasions when she has had a lit- tle too much beer with her whisky and gets worked up about ’’that bastard nephew” of hers. You can go down to Wellesley Second Lane if you like. Any cabbie will take you to the head of the street and drop you off there to walk the rest of the way on foot. He doesn’t want to ruin his suspension on the potholes to find his hub-caps miss- ing when he comes out. You can walk in quite safely. But all youll see is a mean, squalid little street going nowhere. The place might seem to close in on itself pro- tectively. A shutter being pulled in. a rag of curtain twitching shut, the sing-song cadence of the street stilling. No echoes of the stories it abounds in will reach your ears. Youll look around and might even walk past Fitus without knowing it. So youll come away and later say, the- re’s nothing, nothing there at all. ^id in a way you’ll be right, and in a way wrong, for Wellesley Second I^e is not just a street or a geographical location. It is a condition, an acceptance of bleakness in which nothing grows and not even illu- sions can dare to be paved with gold. T here is one Calcutta institution on which no one mW turn down an empty glass — or, more sqipropriately, a tea-cup. 'Fhe ongoing life and times of the city can be summed up in a four-letter word^d- da. To the archetypal Calcuttan, adda is more than just a way of life — it is an irre- sistible detour as well as eventual destination. The range of adda is as vast as the city of Calcutta and as small as a closed circle of cronies. The young and not-so-young unemployed graduates who loiter on South C^cutta street comers or sit on rocks^-^mall stone platforms outside homes, designed specifically for taking in fresh air and letting out hot — and talk about football, politics and the shocking cost of Charminar eighties, are indulg- ing in adda. So, in their own way. are the retired judges, barristers and senior civil servants who preside over their chotas in the hallowed precincts of the Calcutt; Club and pass learned judgments on decii ning moral standards, increasing corrup tion and the scandalous surcharge oi Scotch. In between these two extremes are thi coffee-house intellectuals of Co11eg< Street and Jadavpur who spout Marcus< and Marx, Proust and Pirandello, will catholic facility, and the babus of Shyani bazar and i^lighat, members of the cleri cal brigade who crowd of an evening int< tiny neighbourhood cafes to vociferat about cabbages, kings and the pemicioui price of hilsa. The hub-bub is punctuates by an occasional staccato order for . “double hair--a typical adda institutioi which refers to one cup of tea split int< two. After alL why waste money and mii the lining of one’s stomach with tannii acid when all that one’s there for is ths talk? The secret behind the popularity o these marathon talk-fests is that ths Bengali, since childhood, has a passiona te and lifelong love affair with the langua ge he speaks. A Bengali does not conver se or convey information; he declaims This holds true whether the subject a stake is the best bus to catch to get to Bell aghata or the nuances of Brechtiai drama. Ask a Bengali a question and yoi will get an oration. He sees all the world as a stage oi which he has the star role and even ai audience of one is a full house for him. Ai he gets into his stride you can see bin becoming mesmerised by the stirring cadences of his own eloquence. As hi talks he becomes in turn a Rabindranatl singing a paean of praise, a Surendranatl Banneijee thundering a broadside again St imperial oppression, a Netaji exhortinj the Azad Hind forces to stiffen tlieii sinews, and an Utpal Dull playing madde ned Lear railing against the cruel ingrati tude of the cosmos. As the sentences rol amd syllables reverberate, all one can d< is sit back and enjoy the one-man show. The adda is most importantly an instru ment of cathartic release. All the pent-uj emotions that the avera^ Cdcuttai builds up in the course of his daily odys sey , careering between the Scylla of chro nic shortages and the Charybdis of chaoi rampant, while clinging on to an over crowded mini bus, are poured out in thi Homeric epic of the adda. This is die secret behind the obdurab sanity of the Calcuttan, a phenomenoi which is achieved against all odds anc which never ceases to astonish outsiders The daily adda acts as an emodona armour which protects the partidpan against the slings and arrows of outrage OU6 urban life. It could truly be said tha an adda a day keeps the revolution at bay Though the adda is by and large a verj 6 Cc^tr>, organised occupation, one of the best kinds of adda to have is an impromptu one. I recall a memorable example. It was the evening before the day 1 got married and some friends had taken me out on a last bachelor bash. Having put down more than a few quick ones, we repaired to Anarkali, a Sikh dhaba justly celebrat- ed for its excellent chicken bharta and the thoughtfulness of its management which keeps the place open till the small hours of the morning. The eatery was packed as usual and we had to share a table with a lone bhadralok who was intensely involved with a murgh massalam. Ignoring him we continued our discussion* which happened to be about poetry. I'd just said something about Browning’s monologues when our co-diner suddenly flung down the drum- stick he had been gnawing, leapt to his feet and shouted: “Browning, Word- sworth, Milton! Why are you not mention- ing the name of Rabindranath, no doubt an immortal bard.” It was obvious that he, like us, had had a couple too many. It was equally obvious that he was all set to make a scene. With- out really thinking, I said, *'What*s in a name? Alber all *Amar nam, tomar nam, Vietnam’ (My name, your name, Viet- nam).” This was a time when Vietnam was a red-hot emotive topic, and it was as though Td waved a magic wand. His wrath turned immediately to gushing good fellowship and with a cry of “Com- rade!” he slapped me on the back and for the next hour and a half told us all about Yankee imperialism, the art of Ritwick Ghatak and his own humble attempts at writing verse. A lot has been said and written about that unique species, the Calcutta intellec tual, and I have often had to take curious out-of-towners on expeditions to see this fascinating creature in his natural habitat. As the gunfighters of the Wild West are suppos^ to have prowled the saloons and mainstreets of the American frontier seeking notches to add to their reputa- tions, the logomachists of Calcutta haunt the coffee houses in search of verbal duels. Squaring up to each other and having gathered a circle of witnesses, the two opponents open fire in a ritual governed by an unwritten but inflexible code. The idea is to nominate a mutually acceptable subject and then to out-namedrop the other in rapid bursts of references to cri- tics and works on the subject under deba- * te. The tension mounts as the names fly like berserk ping-pong balls above the rat- tle of cheap crockery. “Popper”, “Berg- son. Buber, Marcel!” “Ivan Illych, Susan Sontag, Levi Strauss”. Finally one of the combatants runs out of nominal ammuni- tion and, defenceless, crumples before the other’s continuing onslaught. The vic- tor stalks away, folloi^byadiniringaco- Iyte8,whilethelo$erdrown$hismortiflca- tlon in a ack^idiged cup of cof^ T he institution of adda is supported by a rundown old relative — eccentric, can- more than just the intellectual climate tankerous, infuriating, impossible to live of the place.

Like a fiy in amber, a distant city is pre- served in memory, a remembrance of times past. T he loneliness of the long-distance Cal- cuttan, caught between two worlds, springs from a realisation of double exile. All emigrants experience the paradox of displacement: You don’t have a home till you leave it; and when you do, you find you can't go home again. But in the case of Calcutta this feeling is compounded by a sens€» of dislocation in time as well as space. Perhaps because — as its critics claim— it is a place with a past but no ftitu- re, the city is capable of inducing a virul- ent and chronic attack of nostalgia. In a sense, Calcutta is everyone's childhood, measles, mumps and all. Tlie emigrant experience is perfectly suited to a transplant of Calcutta. And since this can’t be done with the real city, a mythical one has been invented to fit the need, an emotional precinct of love and squalor. Beyond the reach of urban blight and civic neglect, this portable city of the mind flourishes all the more as the real one deciines. “Every time we meet, we end up miking about Cal. It's the one thing we have in common,\" says a Sydney- based airline executive, referring to the “old mob from back home\". And then he adds, “But none of us has been back in years.\" Like the words of an old song that keep repeating themselves in your head, or a fever dormant in the blood, or an importu- nate lover impossible lo be rid off, it keeps returning again and again, at the oddest times and in the strangest places.

Assuming the crowns of Upper and Ix)wer Egypt in 1279 BC, the “king of kings\". Ramses II, reigned for more than 60 years. He sired at least 90 children, brought his empire prosperity and peace, built more colossal structures and had his name carved on more stone surfaces than any other pharaoh. He is linked also with the exodus of the Hebrews. “As this scholarship enriches our knowledge of ancient Egypt, it is round- 1 Photographs: O.L. Mazzatenta ing out a more human portrait of this towering figure.\" Rick (iore writes. Evad- ing destruction for 3,000 ytiars, Ramses’ mummy lies inside an unmarked case in Cairo’s Egyptian Museum. James Harris of the University ef Michigan led a team that X-rayed and examined the mummy before it was removed from view and put in an airtight case to prot(!ct it. Harris described the physical Ramses to Gore: “He was about 5 feet 8 inches in height -one of the tal- ler pharaohs. He had a strong jaw; a beak- ed nose, a long thin face. TTiat was not typical of earlier pharaohs. “He probably looked more like the people of the eastern Mediterranean. This is not sur- prising, because he came from the Nile Delta, which had been invaded in the past by peoples from the east.” Ramses II was about 8 when his father Seti became pharaoh. “Seti must have fill- ed his son with romantic tales of war.” Gore writes. “I can imagine him personal- ly showing tlie boy how to charge a cha- riot into a fray.” Seti also infused his son with his own two great dreams: to reclaim the lands lost to the Hittites, Egypt’s archenemies to the northeast, and to build colossal monuments to his own godliness in the style (jf the jjreat kinf^ of earlier dynasties. Together they swore to recapture the city of Kadesh, today in Syria. It guarded trade routes to the east. Seti and Ramses took the city briefly, but it returned to Hit- tile mil' as stion as they got back to Egypt. Tlie walls of the majestic temple of Kar- nak, a towering monument refurbished by both Ramses and his father, reveal the way a pharaoh was supposc^d to enjoy mayhem. “His majesty,\" reads one inscription, ‘'exults at beginning the baf- fle, he delights to enter into it; his heart is gratified at the sight of blood. He lops off the heads of the dissidents. ... His majesty slays them at one stroke — he lea- ves them no heirs, and whoever escapes his hand is brought priscuier to Egypt.\" But Seti wanted I^mses to create life as well as dc^stroy it. He s(‘k^‘ted a harem for him. 'fhe message was clear: Start procreating. Ramses wastt*d no time. His principal wife, the lovely Nefertari. quickly pniduc- ed a son. His second-favourite wife, Ist- nofret, soon delivered another. Within 10 years each wife had borne at least five sons and several daughters. His other wives may have accounted for another five to 10 sons and as many daughters. “Ramses* house must have resounded with the gurgles, yelps and whimpers of each yt.»ar*s crop of bouncing royal babic's,\" says Ef^tologist Kenneth Kitchen of the University of IJverpool. Kitchen has spent the past 22 years trans- lating and studying 2,(KK) pages of hiero- glyphs relating to Ramses. He is the world’s leading authority on the man. When 'Seti died at about age 50. Ram- ses, still in his 20s. became king. The new pharaoh immediately bc'gan a build- ing boom. Ramses compkHc^ his own temple at Abydos. He built a great city in the Nile Delta at his old family home, cal- ling it Pi-Ramses, Houst^ of Ramseys. He finished the columned hall at Kamak, commissioned the mighty rock temples at Abu Simbel and raised oth^T temples in nearly every important Efpq)tian city. Ramses also took credit for many structures built by his predecessors, chi- selling out their names and substituting his. “He commissioned so much art,\" says Rita Freed of Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, “that it became mass produc- tion. He seemed more interested in quan- tity, not quality. There probably weren’t enough good artists. Whereas his prede- cessors chiselled a lot of raised relief, he chose sunken relief. It’s easier to do — and harder for your successors to chisel away.” I D the fifth year of his reign Ramses decided to retake the strate^c city of Kadesh.

Then suddenly the luck of Concerning the parting of the Rec Sea, modern scholars suggest Moses may have led his people through a swam- py lake region east of Pi-Ramses. Strong winds might have blown aside shifting waters on one of the lakes. Then, when the pharaoh's charioteers were in hot pursuit, the wind could have turned, swamping the Egyptians. “Beyond the scriptures,\" writes Gore, “evidence of the exodus is slight It was not an event — the destruction of one of his prized chariot brigades — that Ram- ses would have documented for posterity.\" By the time Ramses reached his mid- 40s he had given up his annual cam- paigns against the Hiltites but not his mania for building. Shortly after return- ing from Kadesh he began planning his greatest monument, Abu Simbet He chose a rc^mote site far to the south in Nubia, where pink sandstone bluffs towi*- red above the Nile. There he had four 67-foot seated statues of himself carved into the rock. ' Behind the statues his workers cut a temple 160 feet deep into the hillside. They adorned the walls ^yith the glories of Kadesh. On an adjacent bluff he built a ... p Ha o acwitiyllwii^ M 1 rg [ flOirinttMi second monument to honour his wife Nefertari. Wliy did Ramsc*s build his most colossal temples so far from the Egyptian heaitland? Rita Frwd of the Boston museum feels it was a i)olilical statement to the Nubians. “Nubia was a critical source of gold, labour, and exotic materials,\" Freed told Gore. “Those sta- tues said: T am Ramses the Great. You will continue to pay tribute to me.’\" Ramses' humanity resonates in the companion statues of Nefertari. He eleva- ted her to the same eternal heights he sought for himself and bestow^ upon her words of uncharacteristic tender- ness: “Possessor of charm, sweetness love,\" he had inscribed in her tomb. Lit- tle is loiown of Ramses' other wife, but Kitchen speculates: “Nefertari had the looks. He was obviou^y proud of her, showing her off ah the time. But 1 think Istnofret had the brains. “It's her oar- ing that wielded the most power as Ram sesaged.\" “In his later years the old pharaoh pro- Wy lived in a golden sunset,\" says Kitchen. “Decorating acres of walls and travelling a circuit up and down the Nile, rather like a Methodist minister, making sure everyone was doing his job. \" Eventually he turned the reins of government over to Istnofn^t's two old- est sons. Prince Ramst*s and Khaem- waset. Both died before their father, as did at least 10 other sons. A younger son of Istnofret, Memeptah, finally inherited the throne. Kamst^s probably died of old age. X- rays of his mummy indicate he suffered painful hip arthritis, which probably causr ed him to stoop. His teeth were badly worn and he had dental abscesses and gum disease. With all these human ail- ments, did he really believe he was a god? Who can say? ' “But cleariy,\" Gore concludes, “he strove to be the king his country expected— iJTOviding wealth and security — and succe^ed. He also want- ed to live forever.

In the distance we can see the sprawiing campus ol the Kasturba Medical College and Hospital which has put liny Manipal firmly on the world map of health educa- tion, while behiiid us the road winds sliarp- •y round the shoulder of the hill bc*fore disappeanng into the verdant valley below, where the temple towm of Udupi slumbcTs as it has done for so many centuries. Hut our distination is still some distance away, and as we veer off the beaten track past monotonous clusters (if flat-topped brick and concrete dwellings and shells of houses in various stages of construction, our eyes are drawn almost inexorably to a quaint old fashbned structure with a jut- ting open portico, stately wooden pillars, a sloping tiled roof reminiscent of another age, anothei time. TTiis, then, is the house that has cata- pulted its owner Vijaynath Shenoy, anT em- ployee of the Syndicate Bank at Manipal, stanght into the pages of national news- papers and magazines. This is the house that draws on endless stream of visitors from all over south India, ordinary people who shuffle wide-eyed through the rooms pausing to caress a fluted wcxxlen pillar worn smooth and dark with age, or gasp in recognition when some traditional bell metal article in Shenoy s collection of household artefacts kindies long forgotten memories of sooty cavernous Idtchens in sprawling ancestral houses demolished ago. This is the house that attracts celebrities like Girish Kamad. Sonal Man Singh, H.V. Karanth and other glitterati THE from the w'orld of art, music and dance whenever they are in the vicinity. It is also the house that Vijaynath Shenoy built as a labour of love, sinking into it is his life's savings, personally supervising every last detail to make it tnily reflect the glorious craft tradition of the western coast of In- dia. It was about 15 years ago that Shenoy The house that Vijaynath Shenoy has built in Mani] pal is unique: it is mad e out of what is considered throwaway material. But today it Has become a tourist spot, ii^'sVlDYAPAI'\" The grand rebuilder, Vijaynath Shenoy USED first became interested in traditional architecture and, in the course of his wanderings through the districts of Uttar and Dakshin Kanara (coastal Karnataka), and the Malnad or Western Ghats region of Shimoga, Chikmagalur, Hassan and Coorg, he visited scores of traditional stalely mansions, temples and churches. \"Hie beauty and grandeur of the wooden pillars, doors and screens instilled in him a sense of wonder at the virtuosity of the 'acharyas' (craftsmen and artisans) of a bygone era. But the winds of change had already liegun to blow. 'ITie collapse of the joint-family .system, the migration of entire families ti; different metropolitan cities, and the difficulty in maintaining such sprawling establishments had resulted in dozens of these houses being demolished , to make way for mixiem steel and con- crete structures. “1 was deeply concerned at the manner in which these craft re- sources which form an integral part of our c-ullural heritage and are so necessary for maintaining cultural continuitv were Ixiing destroyed,” Shenoy exclaims. Brass, copper and bell metal utensils and other household artefacts were being sold to scrap merchants who sent them to metal foundries for melting, wliile the priceless wooden components were being chopped down as firewood, he recalls with horror. When his one-tnan crusade against such wanton destruction met with Ijttle .^^ . success, Shenoy inarshaBed all his re- \" LOOK sources and began buying whatever pieces of intricate wcxxlw'ork he Could lay his hands upon, often getting them cheap for the price of timl)er. “At that point of time 1 had absolutely no idea of building a house; what I would do with all these pieces 1 did not know. My prime concern was to avert their destruction,” he explains. It was only later when he failed to mobil- ise support from wealthy fnends and local organisations to build a museum for these pieces that the idea of building a house, incoiporating all the wooden structural components that he had c'ollccted from old disrnantled houses, came into his mind, and he set about “giving a contemporary interpretation to the traditional style of architecture, adopting modem techniques, yet never bsing sight of my roots”. While Shenoy lays no claim to being a trained architect, he admits that his years of experience in studyk^ architectural pat- terns coupled with wide reading and a keen eye for aesthetic detail sto(^ him in good stead in designing and executing his plans without resorting to professional he^. llte house which conforms to the prhiciples laid down in the Vastu ^stra is built round the diowkoT central courtyard open to the sky. llns provides light and ventilation to all comers of the house, as weD as a place where children can play in srfety and women perform their household dxnes in complete privacy. Leaning com- fortably against one of the fluted wooden pillars that support the rool ot the open hexagonal portico w'hich juts out of the building, Shenoy talks at length about how lie had to judiciously blend various heter- ogenous components -parts of temple chariots, bits ol carving from a dilapidated church, stumps of pillars rescued from a wedding feast where they were being used as firewood — so that no single part got undue importance. Leading the way through the gorgeously carved front door, he tsJees us into the rectangular living room whose floor of dull red-oxide and ceiling covered entirely with a cloth paint- ing depicting the Sampooma Raniayan serves as a fitting complement to the ornate wooden pillars, the dummy balcony above the central door, and the intricately patterned perforated wooden screens which make up the inner wall of the room. O n either side of the living room are two identical chambers lined with shelves, housing Shenoy's collection of books, curios and contemporary art. 'Fhe central chowk is skirted by a narrow open verandah which leads to the kitchen and the dining room on the eastern side, the bedrooms on the west, and a kmg rec* tangular hall crammed with andent idols, pieces of sculpture, metalware, dl liitered on the floor in glorious confbsion. ”My prime cx)ncem was to avoid the format of a gallery where objects are displayed in barge numbers in a continuous d^” says Shenoy as he weaves an ek^uent hand towards the assorlmenl of traditional biass, copper and lx*ll metal utensils of ever\\‘ conceivable shape and size that line the walls of the kitchen and dining nxini, and the quaint old oil containers, perfume iXrttJes, sindoor boxes and jewel caskets that vie for attention in the cabinet in the liedrtXHn. just as they did in some otluu* house years ami vears ago. Shenov’s attempt at tciuvenaling peo pie's interest in the rich cultural traditions of the \\Vestt‘ni coast seems to have paid dividends dunng the last tew months. Ob- jects which were dismissed as old fashioned and outdaled an' now being seen in a new light, he claims, and people are becoming increasuyeh .iware of the need to “salvage, resunett and conserve” a dying tradition. All of which should make Shenoy a very happy man: the sheer IxMut y and aesthetic appeal of the littk' house, however. Umd to obscure the basic philosophy^ he wants to project, he laments, narrating the stoiy ol the oil -rich Sheikh who offered him a blank cheque if he would dismantle the entire structure and reassemble it in some more accessible (and presumably more com- ercially nable) spot near Bangalore. \"But this is where the house belongs, the architectural pattern is typical of this re- ^on, how can it fit into alien surround- ings?\" he quries, bewildered, ruling out any such proposition. Though the htiuse was built with the idea of being lived in, a series of practical difficulties have arisen, torcing Shenoy to form a public trust for its management though he will continue to be totally in- volved with Its functioning. “People would walk in at all hours... sometimes they’d come from far flung districts and I didn’t have the heart to refuse admission,\" he smiles a trifle apologetfrally. 'Hie total lack of privacy; the effort required in maintain- ing the elaborate wncxlwork and metal- ware, keeping them clean and dust -free; the necessity of documenting the entire collection coupled with the knowledge tliat the priceless antiques and brealhtakingly beautiful artefacts in the house ultimately belonged not to his family alone but to the people at large who are the inheritors of this cultural tradition were some of the factors which influenced Shenoy's decision to move to a separate living quarters in the vicinity. Nevertheless he continues to be closely associated with the venture, escorting groups of people around llie rooms, pointing out terracotta tiles of rare beauty or demonstrating the autolrx'k sys- tem on the wooden door which some tatented craftsman devised almost a cen- tury ajp, contributing his mite to the pre- servawn of a culture tradition threatened by the superfiewhty and crass conirnen ial- ism so rampant in society today. ■ 17 Monpabeau^ 'wipl ' l D NaciMi| WM imodeB windjoiir'ftiilfn^^ and nMpmed to t^. theb/iullik.

(Subhasish Ma|umdar, CE 145, Salt Lake City, Calcutta 700064) fine: Because in Chinese, the word for “small bottle” is “XIa Peng”, which rhymes with the surname of Deng XIaopeng, leader of the Chinese Communist Party. Breaking a small bottle, therefore, has the same relevance as burning an effigy.

POSTMORTEM CONTENTS Tlif Siriirily Bir Guns There are some glaring mistakes in the cover story, ‘How Safe Are Our VIPs?’ Oune 16). ITie remark that the SPG is unarmed is immediately contradicted by the pictu- re where the SPG guard is seen carrying a Heckler und Koch MP5K — made in Germany— submachi- ne gun, which being 12.8 inches long, is specially designed for coniealed carrying' by plainclo- thesmen. 'Fhis gun is- fed by a 15-round 9mni Para- bellum magiizine especial- ly designed for it. And it would certainly not serve the purpos(‘ of guarding our VIPs if they went about unanned. Further, your conten- tion that the NSCi uses AK47s is wrong. 'Iliey are armed with Heckl<T und Koch MP5A3 fully auto- matic sub-machine guns with sliding metal stnit stocks which allow a cdn- sid(Tal)le reductioin in length from 26.77\" to a convenient 19.3\". This weapon (the larger ver- sion of the MP5K used by the Src) is fed by a 9mm Parabellum 30-round magazine (with a spare* m^azine clipped bn for quick and smooth change in action) and fires at a rate of 800 rounds per minute (unlike the AK47 assault rifle which only fires at the rate of 600 rpm and being ungainly and unweildy for this work is not and never has been, a favourite of the NSG). This weapon is in service with the German, the Netherlands and Swiss armies and the famed Bri- tish SAS, besides being a favourite with certain ter- rorist ^oups in Europe and Beirut. Your comment about Gautam Kaul is also wrong. He is an inspector general in the CISF, but does not head the force. It is headed by an 11^ offi- cer of director general status. RP,N.

A close look at what it implies. SECTIONS COVER STORY L ots of colour. And probably little substance. That's what many an kvid Lok Sabha watcher has to say about the composition of the new House. Also, a surfeit of new faces, a natural con- sequence of the good showing by the BiJP, which has risen in strength from 85 in the last Lok Sabha to 121 this time. The Congress(I), too, has improved its lowing, going up from 197 to 226, with quite a few interesting first-timers in its ranks. But there is one striking difference bet- ween the new feces of the BJP and the CongressO) . The latter are not new to the poli&al field, they have spent some years in the Congress fold and have thus gain- ed agrounding in the profession. This can- not be said of the BJP, a party that grew in popularity so fest between the last elec- tion and this' one that its leaders had to launch a hunt for 'catchy* feces which could encash its 'earnings’ of the Ram Jan- mabhoomi campai^. Their strategy paid off rather well, with a number of 'sants', popular television stars, bureaucrats and retired Army officials romping home. Striking, these MPs m^ be. But the moot question is how they will perform. Will any of them riiape into a serious parliamertarian, which the party seems to be sorely in need of, or will ffiey be nothing more than rabble^users;' of which the party has no dearth? Or will th^ be just mute witnes- ses to the proceedings, contributing noth- ing but numbers to £he BJP? ' In the ninth Lok Sabha, among die enti- re BJP band only LK. Advani and Jaswant Singh are well versed in the conduct of business and could be expected to steer the party in crucial debates on issues fac- ing the nation. Now there will also be Atal Behari V^payee to bolster the BJP in Lok Sabha, but only at some cost to the party in the Sabha where he was a mem- ber earlier. Even so, Advani still feces the test of converting his new and diverse flock into a serious and disciplined force. There is already one MP who proposes to seek Advanl’s guidance hi diaping herself into a dignifi^ parlia- mentarian: Deeplka Chikludia. She encashed her small-screen image of Sita to get elected from Baroda. Journalists <dl her the giamour gitj of the Lok Sahha^ an image that Deepika is hardly averse to. But she still wishes to be {mown for ’•substance*' more than •beauty\". No sooner had she been given die tfeket by the BJ P than she was able to answer queries fielded by journalists, but interviews with her always left a lingering that she had been briefed by a BJ P atflvwt on moat scores. That impression seemed togetconfirmed when sheanswe* fed a query about her views on the BJP manifesto frith a \"No comment\". Nevertheless. Deepika is no dumb doll; if nothing else she is at least clever enough. During her election campaign she told us that she had no plans of giving up films for politics and would pursue- both careers with equal zeal but of late, she has changed her tune. \"I will com- plete my pend^ing assignments within a year and a half and then devote myself to politics.\" she says. Is Deepika really gett- ing serious about serving the nation or is it Slat her husband-to-be has advised her to quit films after marriage and she is merely turning a necessity into a virtue before the public? If Deepika shows the potential of turn- ing into a serious parliamentarian, there are doubts about the contribution that the group of seven from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad could be expected to make to substantive issues facing the nation. They got the ticket because the BJP was playing the Hindutva card and by S^ma Paul meets some of the more interestinF first-timers in Parliament their own confession the sadhus amongst the VHP group wish to achieve nothing more than a temple at the controversial place in Ayodhya, to be followed by ones at Mathura and Varanasi. The only other item on their agenda is a ban on cow slaughter. Salman Khursheed: Fluent in defence Girija Vyas: Preferring politics to maniage Swami Sakshiji Maharaj, who won from Mathura, says the sadhus will return to their original mission once these objectives are achieved. It will be interesting to watch how he and other sadhus in the Ix>k Sabha. including Swami Chinmayanand, who will be serv- ing his second tenn in Parliament and has served several terms in UP Ljegislatu- re, could help them out. Others from the VHP group, which may well be called the creme f/e la creme of the saffron parly, include S.C. Dixit , former vice-president of the VHP. Vinay Katiyar, the fire-spitting Bajrang Dal chief from UP and B.L. Sharma ‘Prem* who defeated the Congress(I) heavy- weight, H.K.L. Bhagal, from East Delhi. If what the latter says about his aims and objectives in Parliament are what we should go by, the non-sadhus of the VHP group have as limited a wqrld view as the sadhus. .Sharma says he wishes to seek the rcpealmenl of Article 370 and uniform civil code, both of which the BJP has promised in its manifesto. Those who know Dixit and Sharma feel they would prove nothing more than rabble-rousers in the BJP ranks. But Shar- ma contests that, sayingthat only the Con- gress party is known for its 'shouting brigade'. Many of the distinguished first-timers in the Congress(I) party have been accommodated in the 58-member council of ministers by Prime Minister P.V. Nara- simha Rao. That wguld deprive Parlia- ment watchers the pleasure of lislening more frequently to them. A big loss on this count would be Salman Khur- aheed, one of the handful of MPs from Uttar ^adesh who has been made mini- 5 S.C. Dixit Rabble-rouser ster — as deputy to R Chidambaram — in the prestigious commerce ministry. Son of the well known Khursheed Alam Khan who has been minister of state seve- ral times, Salman has a BA in jurisprudeii ce and BLC from Oxford University and has been a practising lawyer at the Supre- me Court. With fluency and substance both being his strong points, he could have become a speaker worth listening to. He admits that a few years as a back- Farooq: Now swimming in the sea bencher would have honed his skills as a parliamentarian.But he himself has no regrets on that count, saying that ’’being a defence counsel is often more interesting than being the prosecutor”. A freelanct* journalist and writer of seve- ral distinguished legal papers, he is quite thrilled to have made it to F^arliament in his second go (he lost in 1989). \"I basical- ly have an instinct for politics,\" he says, \"and desired to be a politician since my schooldays.\" If I preferred to do law earlier, it was only because I wished to pursue my other interests in life before poltics consumed all my time and atten- tion,\" he says. Another newcomer for whom becom- ing an MP is a long cherished dream come true is Mani Shankar Aiyar. As a tour organiser and close associate of Rajiv Gandhi, he has been a public figure for some yt‘ars. His is no! exactly a new face for the public, but new he is certainly is in fVliament. \"It feels good to be in Par- liament legally, after winning the elec- tions,\" he says, adding that in the past he always had a lurking fear that one of the armed guards would question him why he was there. Aiyar was widely expected to find a place in the council of ministers, but never the one to look at the negative side of things, he says, \"I can participate in the proceedings much more as a backben- cher.\" Having served in the Indian Fore- ign Service, one would expect that foro ign policy would be a subject close to his heart, but he claims to be far more inter- ested in other issues. On the top on his list of priorities is the implementation of what he he calls \"Rajiv’s vision of democracy at the grassroots level as set out in the Constitution Amendm(*nt Bill relating to Panchayali Raj and Nagar Palikas.\" Other issues that he would like to contribute to include revamping of zonal cultural centres, the PM’s security and education. \"I would like to make the Congress stick to its pledge of increasing progressive level of allotment of funds to education to achieve six i)er cent of the budget at the end of the Ninth Flan.\" As he entered the hallowed precincts of Parliament, Mani Shankar ^yar had one prayer on his lips. He wanted the media to be a bit kinder to him. Analysing his problematic relationship with the media, he said, \"I lack the F^olonious-like quality. Gravity is not rny starling point and my jokes are often misunderstood.\" A t the oath-taking ceremony in I^shtrapati Bhavan, Giijia \\yas looked both glamorous and dignifi- ed an(f stood out amongst all the mini- sters. Her looks in person do not quite match her seamen image; but it is when she speaks in Hindi that her personality 'l^hFkhtdia: Shapni).^ lu r si l'; really impresses. A P’hl) in philosophy and a professor at Udaipur University besides havdnp taught at the Delaware University in the US, which is the seat of ' philosophy, Vyas is at her best when she starts relating her subject with the every- day mundane realities and even with her (jwn portfolio, information and broad- casting, where she is a deputy minister. Has she ever had philosophical discus- sions with P.V Narasiinlia Kao who has included her in her I’ouiicil of ministers? \"Yes,\" she replies, \"but that was a long lime ago.\" She quickly adds that that was not the r(‘ason for b(»ing included in the Council. She has had widt* (‘xperience in her home state, Rajasthan , where she held several portfolios int'luding those of public relations, education and parliamen- tary affairs, finance and taxation, science and technology and technical education, dairy and husbandry. PWI). tourism, women, children and nutrition. Vyas is honest enough to admit that she won the election because of the sym- pathy wave following the assassination of i^jiv Uandhi. Kven then, her victory mar- gin was only 2B.0l)(). llie HJP was quite strong in her area and she threw a direct challenge to them. From her platform, she always told the people that the HJP was distorting Hinduism and even threw a challenge to Siidhvi Rithanibhara to have a debate wfith her on Hinduism from a common platform. 'Hie Sadhvi, it seems, was not prepared for it as she deci- ded to abandon her constituent^. But Vyas says the challenge is still open to- her. Like the Siidhvi, Vyas is also unmarri- ed and quite happy with her single status. \"One can’t have two jobs, they always clash. I prefer to be in politics,\" she says. I 'ITiough she is ha|)py to have become a minister, she feels she could have conlri- , billed a lot to piirliamenlaiy debates as an ordinaiy Congress MP. lo(». But one can't havt‘ it both ways and Vyas certainly knows that! Another experienced first -linier in fV- lianieiit and the Union council of mini- sters is M .0.11. Farouq from Pondicher- r>‘. Twici‘ chi(‘f minister of that tiny slate, he has no problems coping with tli<‘ new big world of politics in Nev\\ Delhi. \"I was swimming in a [umd earlier.\" he says, \"and now I am in the sea. But I can swim just as W(‘!I.\" Hiere are. however, a ft*w things about the political culture of the north he does not like vt-n- much. One is the overemphasis on caste and religion during elections, \"Can you imagine.\" he^ sa>s, \"that my coirslitueiuy has only seven per cent Muslims and I have b(‘en winning the tdection ihtTi* f<M tlie last Ilf) years.’\" He also has grave objections to I the overemphasis on the security and he di>es not like the fact that wherever h(* goes in his car a securityman must be sea- ted beside him. ”1 used to joke in Pondi- cherry that where criminals go, policem- en are bound to go, but in New Delhi whe- rever ministers go, policemen are bound to go!\" As minister of state for civil avia- tion and tourism, he feels, The priorities of the airlines should be punctuality, main- tenance and courtesy besides good food and disc^lihe.\" A young Haryana MP who is like a breath of fresh air is ShalQa from the Sirsa reserved constituency. The daughter of a Congress leader, Dalbir Singh, who died quite suddenly of leuke- mia, she says she owes her political car- eer to two persons: her father and Rajiv Gandhi. The former made her an idesdist and the latter g^ her the break. Rtuiv Gandhi met her along with her mother over a meal after the death of her father, and Shaiija, who is an MPhil in English literature, went armed with her bic^ata to take his guidance in choosing her career. \"He gave it a cursory look and then threw a bombshell by offering me a ticket from my faitheris constituency.\" Thus began her political career in 1989, but she predictably lost the election in what was a strong anti-Congress tide in Haryana. This time, however, she was quite sure of victory and Rsuiv Gandhi made it a point to visit her constituency and tell her that she is going to win; and this, when Sirsa had not been on his list of tour programmes drawn up by the pail}^ bigwigs earlier. Since the leader who backed her to the hilt is no more, Shaiija knows things are not going to be as easy, but she is prepared to m^e the best of the opportunity of being a MP and make her presence felt. She says she will be watching the pro- ceedings in Parliament for the first few weeks and would then like to focus the attention of the House on the special pro- blems and needs of her constituency. Her other areas of interest will be education, women, children and welfare of back- ward and oppressed classes. The last is only natural; Shaiija herself is Harqan. P erhaps the most apolitical of all the MPs is Rita Verma. Neither her reasons for joining politics nor those which made her choose th^ BJP as her party are apolitical* in that sense. And she accepts that nobody who knew her when her husband was alive would have believed that she would become an MP one day. All she was known for was a good academic knowledge of politics and politicians. Wife of the Dhanbad SP, Randhir Verma, who was shot dead in an encoun- ter with Punjab terrorists, Verma says: \"I decided to join politics because I wished to fight a society which wanted to humilia- te me and make me accept all the humilia- tion they heap upon widows in this soci^.\" The fellies of both her parents and in-laws, which have government ser- vice backgrounds, were opposed to her joining politics, but she took it as a chal- lenge to her husband’s popularity and a persona] test. \"I have proved myself.\" she now sa"
