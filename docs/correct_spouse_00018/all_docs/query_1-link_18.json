        "text": "An actor, director, producer, and talk show host - Aamir Khan has done it all in his career spanning over thirty years. Gearing up for his next big and most-anticipated release Laal Singh Chaddha, Khan has a lot riding on his shoulder, considering the movie is a remake of the iconic film Forrest Gump featuring Tom Hanks that took home six Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role (Tom Hanks) and Best Director (Robert Zemeckis). Khan who recently appeared on the latest episode of Koffee With Karan shared how it took him around 8-9 years to get the official rights of the movie for the Hindi adaptation.\n\nKnown for taking a long period of time to create a film, Aamir Khan is very picky in the kind of content he stars in.\n\nHowever, in the process of choosing films, he's passed on some big projects to other actors which then changed their career trajectories. As the saying goes ‘One man’s loss is another man’s gain’. While the loss part might not stand true for Aamir Khan, the gain part certainly does stand true for Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan. Let’s look at the blockbuster films that Aamir Khan said ‘no’ to.\n\nAamir Khan rejected these 7 movies that changed the career graph for Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan and went on to mint money at the box office\n\n1. Saajan\n\nOne of the highest-grossing movies of 1991, Saajan is a romantic drama that had every element which made it succeed at the box office. One simply can't miss mentioning its poetic lyrics and heartfelt music that topped the music charts for months. The makers of the movie had approached Aamir Khan and Salman Khan for the movie, however, the former turned down the role. Later, Sanjay Dutt was approached for the same who instantly agreed to do the role. The two Khans were later seen in the iconic Andaz Apna Apna that went on to gain cult status.\n\n2. Darr\n\nEver wondered what if it wasn’t Shah Rukh Khan as the psycho-obsessive lover but Aamir Khan instead delivering the popular dialogue, “Tum Aesa Mat Karo Ki..Ki..Ki..Kiran”? Well, it’s pretty difficult to imagine anyone else portraying the iconic role other than SRK which is still considered one of his best performances to date. Reports state that the first choice for this role was Ajay Devgn but since he didn’t give any response to the maker, the movie was offered to Aamir Khan. But When AK decided not to do the role, the movie went on to SRK. Goes without a say, SRK as a hero or villain shines in this film. In fact, during Lagaan, filmmaker Ashutosh Gowariker and Khan had developed a good rapport, so when the director decided to make Swades, he naturally offered the part to Aamir first who turned down the offer claiming that the plot of the movie bored him. Later SRK was roped in for the part.\n\n3. Hum Aapke Hai Koun\n\nTalk about an iconic movie that established Salman Khan as an actor, and it is impossible to not start the list with Hum Aapke Hai Koun. This movie starring Salman Khan and Madhuri Dixit collected Rs 69.75 crores during its release. With inflation-adjusted to the present day, it made a whopping Rs 354.7 crore, per Hindustan Times. Director Sooraj Barjatya had first approached Aamir for the role who didn’t find the script appealing. The movie boosted Salman Khan's career in the industry.\n\nInterestingly, during his interview in Koffee with Karan when Aamir Khan was asked about which directors he wishes to work with, he instantly named SS Rajamoul and Sooraj Barjataya.\n\n4. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge\n\nThis is the movie that changed the definition of romantic movies in Bollywood. Aditya Chopra initially offered the role of Raj to Aamir who decided not to go ahead with the role. The movie turned out to be Shah Rukh Khan’s best and most-loved movie to date. The same year, Aamir Khan's Rangeela was also released. While both the movies performed well and both Khans were loved for their respective roles, the SRK and Kajol starrer went on to create history.\n\nDDLJ was placed twelfth on the British Film Institute's list of top Indian films of all time. It even held the tag of Biggest Blockbusters Ever in Hindi Cinema for the longest time. The film took home a National Film Award and at that time set a record of winning 10 Filmfare Awards. The movie also had a historic 1000-week run at Mumbai's Maratha Mandir theater. During its release, it earned Rs 69 crore and has a present-day worth of Rs 301.71 crore, per Hindustan Times.\n\n5. Mohabbatein\n\nJust like DDLJ, Aditya Chopra also offered yet another hit love story to Aamir Khan who refused to do the role. As everyone knows, Shah Rukh Khan went on to portray the role of Raj and the movie turned out to be a massive hit at the box office.\n\n6. Bajrangi Bhaijaan\n\nThere came a period when for the longest time Salman Khan’s movies were underperforming at the box office. It was in 2015 when Khan bounced back with his heartfelt performance in Bajrangi Bhaijaan that was not only loved by his fans but was also hailed by the critics (a scenario which is witnessed less in the case of SK).\n\nAs per the reports, when Kabir Khan approached Aamir Khan for this film, the actor wanted certain changes in the movie that the maker didn’t agree with. Later, the movie went to Salman Khan and the rest is history.\n\n7. Dil To Pagal Hai\n\nAnother grand hit coming from filmmaker Yash Chopra was initially offered to Aamir Khan who turned it down. The role later went to Shah Rukh Khan and we all know that to date, the movie is loved by viewers. The same year Aamir Khan was seen in another cult comedy Ishq, alongside Ajay Devgn, Kajol and Juhi Chawla."
