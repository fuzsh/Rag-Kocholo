        "text": "Manisha Koirala has returned to the movies again. Making her comeback with Mauli, directed by debutante Promita Sengupta, the actress plays Bihari-Muslim woman who reunites with her lost son after years. In an interview to Mumbai Mirror, she opened up and spoke about the want to adopt a girl child –\n\nI am extremely close to my family but they live in Nepal. I feel lonely when I come back to an empty house. There’s a need for human bonding, I’ve wanted to adopt since I was a child.\n\nManisha was married to Nepali businessman Samrat Dahal in 2010, but they filed for divorce, two years later. When asked if she’s open for a second marriage, Manisha was quite positive –\n\nWho wouldn’t want to get married? Initially it’s great, but later, you never know. If somebody nice comes along, I may think about it. What’s important at present is a sense of family which will come with the adoption.\n\nThe actress plans to get into film-making and writing as well. We’re just glad to see her back!"
