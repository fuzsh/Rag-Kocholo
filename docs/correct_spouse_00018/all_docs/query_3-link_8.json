Final Word: Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff tops the show in this high voltage action thriller which lacks an engaging script and interesting narration. Story : War is the story of Kabir (Hrithik Roshan) who works for Indian Intelligence. He commits a series of crimes after which his student Khalid (Tiger Shroff) takes the re- sponsibility to trace Kabir and the reason behind Kabir's crimes. The rest of War is all about the unexpected twists and how Kabir stages a massive search operation for the most wanted criminal and Khalid's contribution in this operation. Watch War to know about the rest. Analysis : War opens on an interesting note but the film finds different paths and the plot gets deviated completely. Hrithik and Tiger Shroff steals the show with their packed performances and terrific screen presence. The action stunts have been top notch and the makers spent lavishly on the film. With an interesting interval bang, the first half of War looks decent and will not disappoint the audience. The second half of War is a mixed bag and has enough flaws. Once again the action episodes, lavish visuals and the grand production values are the major high- lights of the film. The film's track gets deviated once again and the narration gets side tracked. Vaani Kapoor sizzles in her limited role and the song has been canned well. The climax has been dragged and it looks unusual. On the whole, the second half of War is a disappoint- ment. 2.5/5 20 WWW.CINESPRINT.COM | OCTOBER- 2019 EVIEW BOLLYWOOD\n\n21. 21OCTOBER- 2019 | WWW.CINESPRINT.COM\n\n22. EVIEW BOLLYWOOD 22 WWW.CINESPRINT.COM | OCTOBER- 2019\n\n23. Final Word: Prassthanam is built on countless conflicts, awash with textbook characters and dated in its story-telling. Story : Prassthanam is a 2019 Bollywood drama, which has been directed by Deva Katta. The movie stars Sanjay Dutt, Jackie Shroff, Manisha Koirala, Ali Fazal, Amyra Dastur and Satyajit Dubey in the lead roles. Prassthanam is a remake of Telugu hit movie Prasthanam. The first look motion poster of Prassthanam release with a tagline \"the survival of the toughest in the journey to earn the legacy,\". Analysis : Prasthanam about political ambition and corruption lead- ing to downfall and tragedy in a family. The drama unfolds around one family. Sanjay Dutt plays Baldev Pratap Singh, a man with political ambitions, which gets fast-tracked when he is handed over charge of a rural power centre. He ce- ments his hold when he agrees to marry the dying leader’s widowed daughter-in-law and adopt her two children. Baldev is a powerful leader who is bracing to fight to retain his seat. His sons are his Achilles Heel. Saroj (Manisha Koi- rala) is mother to Ayush and Palak but the birth of her third child, her son with Baldev, creates a rift between the step- children. The grown up Ayush (Ali Fazal) is a measured and thinking man being groomed to take over the political reins from Baldev. Palak (Chahat Khanna) is estranged from the family, resentful of her mother for remarrying and unwilling to forgive her for having Vivaan (Satyajeet Dubey). 2/5 23OCTOBER- 2019 | WWW.CINESPRINT.COM\n\n24. Final Word: Varun Tej tops the show with his packed performance throughout the film. A decent mass attempt. Story : After facing the heat from a section, the makers renamed the film as Gaddalakonda Ganesh. As the title says, the film is all about the story of a ruthless gangster Gaddala- konda Ganesh (Varun Tej). Talented and young filmmak- er Balamurali (Atharvaa) decides to make a film on his life story. The rest of Gaddalakonda Ganesh is all about how he turns close to Ganesh and if he excels in presenting the life story of Gaddalakonda Ganesh. Watch the film to know about the complete story and what happens next. Analysis : Gaddalakonda Ganesh has a decent premises set. The first half of the film looks racy with packed action, enter- tainment and interesting narration. Varun Tej stuns the audience in his first ever mass outing as Gaddalakonda Ganesh. He lives up to the expectations and carries the entire film on his shoulders. The songs look decent on screen. With an interesting interval bang, the first half of Gaddalakonda Ganesh looks decent. The second half of Gaddalakonda Ganesh starts on an interesting note but the film soon dips down. The pre- climax episodes and the unwanted threads leave the audience in disappointment. The climax too looks predict- able. The remix song has been shot well on screen and the love track between Varun Tej and Pooja looks im- pressive. On the whole, the second half of Gaddalakonda Ganesh is just ok. 3/5 EVIEW TOLLYWOOD 24 WWW.CINESPRINT.COM | OCTOBER- 2019\n\n25. 25OCTOBER- 2019 | WWW.CINESPRINT.COM\n\n26.

Laced with all the needed ingredi- ents, Syeraa should not be missed. Story : Syeraa is the story of the first freedom fighter of the coun- try Uyyalavada Narasimha Reddy. Set in the backdrop of Rayalaseema, the core plot is about how Uyyalavada Narasimha Reddy comes to know about the problems faced by the people because of the Britishers and his revolt against the British kingdom. The film narrates about Uyyalavada's efforts in uniting 61 palegars and revolt- ing against the British. Watch Syeraa to know about the complete story of the unsung hero Uyyalavada Narasimha Reddy. Analysis : Syeraa starts on a slow note which narrates about the core plot of the film that is set in Rayalaseema region. The film takes pace slowly and catches the fuel before the pre- interval. The action stunts are canned well and the interval episodes are the major highlight of Syeraa. Megastar roars loud with his packed performance in the movie. The tech- nical aspects along with the VFX and the grand production values are the major highlights of the film. On the whole, the first half ends on a decent note and leaves good ex- pectations on the film. The second half of Syeraa lives up the expectations and the action stunts are the major highlights of the film. The emotional drama looks well connected and the screenplay along with Megastar's packed performance is the major highlight of Syeraa. The climax episodes are a treat and they will stand out and will appeal to all the sections of audience. The production values make the film look lavish. On the whole, Syeraa is a treat to watch and will cater to all the sections of audience. 3.5/5 27OCTOBER- 2019 | WWW.CINESPRINT.COM\n\n28. 28 WWW.CINESPRINT.COM | OCTOBER- 2019\n\n29. 29OCTOBER- 2019 | WWW.CINESPRINT.COM\n\n30. pecial StOry Emotional Comic Drama 30 WWW.CINESPRINT.COM | OCTOBER- 2019\n\n31.

Salman Khan Salman Khan and Sanjay Leela Bhansali's much-anticipated film Inshallah may be shelved, but the actor says he still shares a great equation with the filmmaker. The 53-year-old actor and the director announced earlier this year that they will be col- laborating for a love story, also featuring Alia Bhatt, and the film will hit the theatres on Eid 2020. The project, however, was cancelled last month following cryptic tweets by Salman Khan and Sanjay Leela Bhansali's production team. Deepika Padukone A lot has been said and written about Pyaar Ka Punchnama director Luv Ranjan's upcoming film report- edly featuring Ranbir Kapoor, Ajay Devgn, and Deepika Padukone. The Padmaavat actress' fans were pretty upset when they read reports about Deepika working with Luv, who was accused during #MeToo movement. To express their displeasure, fans started trending #NotMyDeepika on Twitter. Soon, media reports suggested that Deepika Padukone opted out of the film. Ayushmann Khurrana Ayushmann Khurrana who stepped into Bollywood with Vicky Donor made his mark with his very first content-driven film.

Mahesh Babu The handsome hunk of the Telugu film industry, Mahesh Babu is a superstar in every right! In fact, the star also enjoys a huge fanbase in the USA as his films open to humongous numbers in this market. Thanks to dubbed South films on the small screens, he has garnered huge recognition in the Hindi mass belts as well and needless to say, his charm and smile are also the reasons behind his popularity among women. But the best part is that Mahesh Babu is not only easy on the eyes but he is also a power-house performer. Regina Cassandraa When we talk about actresses in the South Indian film industry, one of the prominent names that come to our mind is that of Regina Cassandraa. Bollywood film buffs will know her as Sonam Kapoor's love interest in Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga. She has scored a winner at the box-office with Evaru and is a truly stylish woman. Regina Cassandraa's personal style is chic and wearable. From contemporary Indian wear to pantsuits and dresses, she knows how to ace the look.
