        "text": "The Tashkent Files review :\n\nMost of us know former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri only for his ‘Jai Jawan Jai Kisan’ slogan. In reality, Shastriji fought for our independence alongside Gandhi and Nehru, started the green (agriculture) and white (milk) revolution which changed India for the better, successfully won a war in 1965 (something his predecessor Nehru failed miserably in 1962) and ushered in economic reforms to rescue then ailing India.\n\nUnfortunately, our school history textbooks haven’t given Shastriji his due, relegating him to a footnote and instead choosing to concentrate only on the other two Congress leaders. The Tashkent Files, directed by Vivek Agnihotri, is a well researched movie on Lal Bahadur Shastri’s life and goes a step further to answer questions on the great leader’s mysterious death in Tashkent (then part of USSR; present day Uzbekistan).\n\nIn the early hours of 11th January 1966, Shastriji was found dead in his hotel room and said to have died of a heart attack. Shockingly, no post mortem was conducted and his dead body brought back to India had turned blue and bore cuts oozing blood. This raised a lot of still unanswered questions :\n\nWas Shastriji poisoned? Why wasn’t his regular cook allowed to serve him food that night?\n\nWhy were two different set of reports made on his death – one for India and one for the Soviet Union? Why weren’t they ever published or made public?\n\nWhy did the Indian doctor attending to him and the cook die in separate car accidents not too long after this incident?\n\nWas this an international conspiracy perpetuated by the CIA? Or KGB? Or was it a plain State sponsored murder?\n\nThe film explores each of the above questions and tries to answer them from various documented sources available.\n\nBorrowing the template from the classic ’12 Angry Men’ (1957), Agnihotri sets the debate in a dimly lit room where nine members of a committee set up to investigate Shastris death assemble.\n\nAdmittedly, the film’s first half is quite slow paced for its own good. The proceedings pick speed only in last half hour and the climax is a shocker with its big revelation. The music is a letdown and the songs should’ve been avoided altogether. The production quality is strictly average.\n\nComing to the performances, Prabhuji Mithun Chakraborty gets a meaty role and nails it. Shweta Basu Prasad is impressive as the investigating journo. Naseeruddin Shah is wasted. So is Pankaj Tripathi. Pallavi Joshi shows up on a wheelchair smoking a beedi. And Mandira Bedi at 46, still looks hot and sexy. She’s the best of the lot.\n\nFinally, you leave the audi praising Vivek Agnihotri for his guts and gumption to take on this offbeat difficult subject…and deliver a resounding punch!!\n\nRatings on some key aspects :\n\n1.

And with patriotism currently the flavour of the season, Romeo Akbar Walter (or RAW in short) couldn’t have been more perfectly timed. It could’ve done better with a tighter screenplay though!\n\nThematically similar to Alia Bhatt’s ‘Raazi’ (2018), John is Romeo Ali, a bank cashier, who is picked by the Research & Analytics Wing (RAW) chief (Jackie Shroff) to go undercover in Pakistan right in midst of the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war.\n\nTaking code name Akbar, he infiltrates an arms dealer who is right hand of ISI and stumbles upon a sinister plan of air strike which will significantly impact India.\n\nNo doubt, writer – director Robbie Grewal had an interesting concept in hand but his execution is a bit underwhelming. The film’s lethargic first half makes the audience impatient at times and by the time the proceedings pick up in the last half hour, it’s too little too late.\n\nStrictly by comparison, Sriram Raghavan’s ‘Agent Vinod’ (2012) was more stylish, Kabir Khan’s ‘Phantom’ (2015) was more thrilling and of course last years ‘Raazi’ appeared more realistic and mature in execution.\n\nOn the positive side, John Abraham is super duper in the titular role and pitches in yet another spectacular performance. Mouni Roy, though wasted in a small role, looks damn hot and attractive. Jackie Dada impresses as the RAW chief. It’s good to see old timers – Shadab Khan (legendary Amjad Khan’s son) and pretty Suchitra Krishnamoorthi – back on screen after a long time.\n\nTo sum up, RAW is not a bad film at all. It certainly makes for a decent one time watch. Only thing is it could’ve been an awesome experience…but but but.\n\nRatings on some key aspects :\n\n1. Acting : 4/5\n\n2. Direction : 2/5\n\n3.

Be kind to animals. Stop poachers by not buying ivory products. A message well taken. Only it didn’t need this two hours of relentless actioner to drive home this point.\n\nComing from director Chuck Russell known for Hollywood hits like ‘The Mask’ (1994) and ‘The Scorpion King’ (2002), Junglee can be termed a disappointment…though not of epic proportion. Okay!\n\nAs for the Jungle mein mangal theme, Bollywood has had its share of elephant sagas in the past. Rajesh Khanna befriended and saved one in ‘Haathi Mere Saathi’ (1971) eons ago and some years later, another haathi returned the favour in KC Bokadia’s ‘Main Tera Dushman’ (1989). So what new is being offered on the table, you ask?\n\nFor one, the action sequences featuring Vidyut Jammwal are a sheer delight. Note the police station scene which is total paisa vasool moment specially for maar dhaad loving audience of single screen cinemas. Indeed, Junglee scores very high in this department.\n\nWhere it falters is in the emotional quotient. Vidyut’s camaraderie with the elephant is underdeveloped and restricted to one song, his feud with dad is unconvincing and above all, his love triangle with two heroines (Asha-Pooja) is simply a yawwnnn. Nevertheless, Marathi actor Pooja Sawant makes her presence felt.\n\nMakarand (Mak) Deshpande appears as a martial arts guru who later hits the bottle. By the way, he’s performed better as drunkard (Haha!). Russell has added a nice spiritual touch to his Bollywood debut with his villain (Atul Kulkarni, impressive as always) quoting lines from the Bhagvad Gita and Lord Ganesha himself, making a splendid appearance in one important scene. The VFX is superb here.\n\nNo doubt, Junglee scores on the technical front but is let down by its weak script and dialogues….absolutely pheeka!!\n\nQuite naturally, the star of the show is apna Vidyut bhai. He’s truly electrifying. Junglee’s not.\n\nRatings on some key aspects :\n\n1. Acting : 2.5/5\n\n2. Direction : 2/5\n\n3. Music : 2.5/5\n\n4. Story, Screenplay and Dialogue : 1.5/5\n\n5.

This one is pyaar impossible!!\n\nTwo strangers different in all aspects – age, religion, financial as well as social status – develop feelings for each other after a chance encounter at the ever crowded Gateway of India. This chalk and cheese difference is between Miloni (Sanya Malhotra), a bright CA student and a street photographer Rafi (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) who convinces her to pose as his fiancèe so that his grumpy grandmother can stop pressuring him to get married. Kuch bhi!!\n\nWith such an implausible concept, writer – director Ritesh Batra brings you this wannabe art film which leaves you thoroughly exhausted at the end of its one hour fifty minutes of run time.\n\nNow now, don’t get me wrong. I don’t have any issues with art-house ventures and have appreciated the Naseeruddin Shah – Smita Patil cinema of yore. Primarily cos those films had strong content and were unpretentious in approach. In fact, Batra himself, had made ‘The Lunchbox’ (2013) which I liked for similar reason.\n\nRitesh tries to give a similar kinda offbeat treatment to Photograph only this time, he has no story to tell and practically nothing to shoot.\n\nSo all we get are five scenes of Miloni studying for her exam, four scenes of her disinterestingly eating meal with her family, three scenes of her taxi rides with Rafi, two scenes at a ramshackle single screen cinema (one of the surviving few at Mumbai’s Grant road area) where Rafi and Miloni go to watch an old re-run and one confusing scene showing Miloni’s tuition teacher (Jim Sarbh) trying to shamelessly flirt with her.\n\nAll of the aforementioned scenes are repeated to such an extent that you can easily sneak out of the audi after half hour, go for a jog in the nearby park or maybe catch an IPL inning somewhere and then come back quietly towards the end only to discover the onscreen story not moved by half an inch.\n\nMore woes, we never get to know why an educated girl like Miloni agrees to pose as Rafi’s to- be-wifey and actually spends “quality” time with him and his grandmother. Don’t think any girl with a slightest iota of common sense would ever do that!!!\n\nOf the lead pair, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Sanya Malhotra are sincere but there is little they can do with such an illogical and lazy script. As a result, this Photograph remains largely underdeveloped and throws out a negative picture only. Skip it please!!\n\nRatings on some key aspects :\n\n1. Acting : 3.5/5\n\n2.

Tee Hee! When Surya’s father (Jimit Trivedi) awkwardly asks Aajoba to find a way to spill the news of his impending second marriage, grandpa coolly tells him the easiest way out – Tell Surya that you want to have sex!!\n\nThe dialogues are the film’s biggest positive and the numerous one liners make you LOL every time. With perfect casting and a retro feel, director Vasan Bala manages to create a surreal world which may take some time to get used to but once you do, you are truly hooked to the proceedings. Yup, this is in true sense a ‘Hatke’ action comedy totally different from the standard Bollywood fare we see week on week.\n\nComing to the cast, I always considered Mahesh Manjrekar to be a better director than an actor but with this film, he has proved what a fantastic actor he is. Ekdum Zhakaas!!\n\nGulshan Devaiah can shine under a good director and Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota is the finest example. Playing diverse twins – one legged Karate master and a suave underworld don – this is Gulshan’s best performance till date. Radhika Madan playing Supri – Surya’s love interest and a Karate champion – is equally impressive. Her intro action scene with Kishore Kumar’s ‘Nakhrewali’ song playing in the backdrop is absolutely rocking!!\n\nUndoubtedly, Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota is risky proposition for a debut film. However, Abhimanyu Dassani not just sails through this quirky enterprise with flying colours but also displays a fair amount of spark and acting flair in his first attempt. A star in the making provided he chooses the right projects!\n\nAll in all, Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota is a mindblowing experience at the cinemas. Never had so much fun in recent times…see it to believe it.\n\nRatings on some key aspects :\n\n1. Acting : 4.5/5\n\n2. Direction : 4/5\n\n3. Music : 3.5/5\n\n4.

So yup, Kesari should be welcomed and celebrated. Even with its fair share of inconsistencies and cinematic liberties..\n\nOn 12th September 1897, ten thousand Afghan tribesmen attacked the Saragarhi fort in Khyber Pass (present day Pakistan) and were effectively restrained by just 21 Sikh soldiers belonging to the British India army. Kesari depicts this incredible military combat which is considered to be one of the greatest stand-offs in world history. Wow!\n\nAkshay Kumar plays Havaldar Ishar Singh, a braveheart who leads his regiment to hold back the barbaric enemy from conquering his as well as other strategic forts on that day. Akshay shines in the lead role and the only other actor who could’ve possibly pulled off this daring act was Sunny Deol during his ‘Gadar : Ek Prem Katha’ (2001) peak phase.\n\nIndeed, Akshay Kumar is the life and soul of Kesari and deserves another National award for his awe-inspiring performance. Yes, this Singh is king. Simply Outstanding!!\n\nBesides the towering presence of Akshay, the film’s positive includes cinematographer Anshul Chobey’s wonderfully captured landscapes and expectedly, the production quality and sound design are also top notch. Certain touching scenes like Ishar Singh trying to communicate with an Afghan woman he rescued from a “Jihaad” spewing fanatic remain with you long after the movie is over.\n\nOn the flipside, certain pre-interval portions are a drag. Like the Sikh regiment helping the local villagers build a mosque. Why o why?!! And Parineeti Chopra, playing Ishar Singh’s wife, reminds you of Aishwarya Rai’s fully faltoo bhoot turn in ‘Mohabbatein’ (2000) when she distractingly flits in and out of the battleground. Quite unnecessary, all that mellow shallow drama!!\n\nBut clearly, the pros outweigh the cons here with Kesari giving you moments aplenty to clap and cheer for the brave soldiers. That itself, makes it worth a dekko. Go for it..\n\nRatings on some key aspects :\n\n1. Acting : 4/5 (Akshay gets 5/5)\n\n2. Direction : 3.5/5\n\n3. Music : 3/5\n\n4.

Not just him but many stalwarts like Ramesh Sippy (after the epic ‘Sholay’ (1975)) have seen their subsequent films (though well made and otherwise good enough) not matching up to their own previously set high standards and unconquerable benchmark…\n\nBadla suffers from the same problem – it’s a well made slick thriller with some awesome performances and a knockout finale but doesn’t come close to Ghosh’s cult classic ‘Kahaani’. Of course, it is far far superior to his ‘Kahaani 2’ (2016) and ‘Te3n’ (2016) – two films he directed and wrote in the interim.\n\nAn official remake of Spanish film ‘Contratiempo’ (2016), Badla is a crime thriller with multiple twists and an unguessable climax. Influence of ‘I Know What You Did Last Summer’ (1997) as well as RGV’s Urmila Matondkar starrer ‘Kaun’ (1999) is also evident.\n\nA two hour long conversation between a murder accused Naina Sethi (Taapsee Pannu) and her lawyer Badal Gupta (Amitabh Bachchan), the film reconstructs the crime story from different perspectives to ultimately reveal the unpleasant truth and of course, the killer.\n\nDirector Sujoy Ghosh’s execution is fantastic and his adapted screenplay is gripping right till the end. Having said that, the multiple twists in the plot and the Rashomon-esque treatment may confuse some – the masses in particular who like to be spoon fed every single information and generally hate to use their bheja.\n\nTechnically, Sujoy’s films are always top class and Badla is no different. Cinematography, editing cuts and background score are first rate. Producer Shah Rukh Khan has ensured excellent production quality. In fact, the film looks like a premium Hollywood product, no less.\n\nOf the cast, Amitabh Bachchan is outstanding as the lawyer out to save his client. His intense looks and thick baritone dominate the proceedings throughout. Brilliant performance! Taapsee Pannu is equally good in a complex multi layered role.

She has immense super powers – whether pulverising a space ship with her bare hands or shooting in to space like a comet.\n\nAlas, the decision of casting Brie Larson as the titular character appears flawed. Larson looks cute but lacks the screen presence to make you root for her super hero avatar. Compared to Gal Gadot’s ‘Wonder Woman’ (2017) in the rival DC universe, Brie Larson doesn’t come close to being a super woman at all…not even by a galaxy. Boo Hoo!!!\n\nOn the positive, Samuel Jackson’s Nick Fury steals the show with his witty one liners and an inert humerous. Indeed, the screen springs to life whenever he comes on screen. And yes, the reason behind his eye patch will make you lol.\n\nFinally, Captain Marvel is certainly, not the best from the MCU but it does set up the stage for the eagerly awaited ‘Avengers : End Game’.

Sultan Ahmed.\n\nTwo names I recalled after watching Abhishek Chaubey’s latest dacoit drama ‘Sonchiriya’. Shekhar Kapur made the hard hitting highly realistic docu-drama ‘Bandit Queen’ (1994) which was just not for the faint hearted. On the other end of the daaku spectrum stood the ever commercial Sultan Ahmed films like ‘Ganga Ki Saugandh’ (1978) and ‘Daata’ (1988) which had a simpleton villager turning dacoit to avenge his parents murder or sisters rape at the hands of the evil thakur or zamindar.\n\nSonchiriya is not as raw and intense as ‘Bandit Queen’ nor is it as daft as Sultan Ahmed’s repertoire – it falls somewhere in between. Niether here nor there type. Which ain’t good. And coming from Chaubey whose last film was the knock out ‘Udta Punjab’ (2016), this film can be termed a disappointment!!\n\nCirca 1975 Chambal, Man Singh (Manoj Bajpayee) leads his gang of dacoits who refer themselves as ‘Baaghis’ and not ‘Looteras’. They make formal announcement while looting a wedding and even hand over a cash gift of Rs.101 to the bride. So docile!\n\nAlas, Man Singh is hunted down by his nemesis cop Gujjar (Ashutosh Rana) who has an unfinished feud with this gang.\n\nNext, Lakhna (Sushant Singh Rajput) and Vakil (Ranvir Shorey), the late Man Singh’s daaya and baaya haath, fight over their egos when a lady (Bhumi Pednekar) seeking justice for a rape victim girl, unwittingly joins their brigade.\n\nThe film’s first half is nothing but a repetitive loop of ambushes where Man Singh’s gang gets elimininated one by one. Truly, nothing happens in terms of plot development here.\n\nPost interval, Sonchiriya tries to explain some situations and takes the drama forward but again, one repetitive ambush follows another. A character called Phulia – resembling the real life Phoolan Devi -is thrown in for no rhyme or reason and by this time, you are too tired to count who’s alive and who’s perished. Seriously!!!\n\nPerformance wise, Manoj Bajpayee leaves an impression even in a special appearance. Evidently, Sushant Singh Rajput and Bhumi Pednekar have worked hard on their roles and it shows. Ranvir Shorey and Ashutosh Rana don’t disappoint either. But all their effort pales in front of a tepid screenplay.\n\nWorse, in an attempt to lend authenticity to the enterprise, the lingo is hard core Bundelkhandi which is extremely difficult to comprehend. Oh yes, there are the English sub-titles which I referred to most of the time while watching the movie. Thank God!! But shudder shudder for those who don’t have a habit of reading sub-titles quickly, this film will be a hellish experience. Surely!!\n\nOn the positive, Sonchiriya ends with an important message – that crime never pays and a criminal can seek a redemption, if he so desires. Abhishek Chaubey deserves credit at least for highlighting this fact.\n\nP.S. Talking of the dacoit genre, one film I can recommend is the highly under-rated ‘Yateem’ (1988) directed by JP Dutta and starring Sunny Deol, Kulbhushan Kharbanda and Sujata Mehta. Do try it out. Maybe, I’ll write a separate blog on this fave film of mine. Soon.\n\nRatings on some key aspects :\n\n1. Acting : 3.5/5\n\n2. Direction : 2/5\n\n3. Music : 2/5\n\n4.

The second one has Johnny Lever in a cameo, playing a Bong pilot who drives a helicopter re-assembled from an auto rickshaw. Except for these two gags which genuinely make you lol, the rest of Total Dhamaal offers nothing new in terms of content as well as entertainment.\n\nSupposedly a sequel, Total Dhamaal is actually a third grade remake of Dhamaal Part one (2007) which though slapstick and rash, had its moments. Here, Indra Kumar tries to recycle the same plot of treasure hunt substituting his ‘W’ clue in the original with an ‘OK’ and adding a box office friendly star cast of Ajay Devgn, Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit to the mayhem.\n\nSorrily, the new adds fail to add value to the enterprise. While Devgn looks jaded and tired, Anil – Madhuri, as the bickering Gujju-Marathi couple, aren’t able to recreate their ‘Dhak Dhak’ chemistry of Indra Kumar’s own yesteryear hit ‘Beta’ (1992).\n\nTechnically too, Total Dhamaal has nothing much to shout and clap about. The music comprises of two bad remixes. One of them is Sonakshi making a satyanaash of the cult item song ‘Mungada’ from ‘Inkaar’ (1977). Wish Helen ji sues the makers for making a mockery of her unforgettable number.\n\nAll in all, Total Dhamaal ends up making you glum. It’s mostly ho-hum.\n\nRatings on some key aspects :\n\n1.
