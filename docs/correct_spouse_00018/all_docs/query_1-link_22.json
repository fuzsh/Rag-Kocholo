        "text": "Jalsa , Mumbai June 11 , 2012 Mon 11 : 39 PM\n\nDharmesh Patel, of the sweet Liverpool accented daughter, happy birthday for the 11 th … and coming in advance Tatiana Saavick for the 13th of June , a most prosperous birthday and many more artistic works from you … love and happiness !!\n\nThe problem really with modern gadgetry these days is that by the time you learn how to use it effectively, another more efficient model hits the market and the temptation to acquire it pounds within. End result ; you never get to master either one. So just when I begin to master the touch screens of the iPhone 4, the version iPhone 4S has appeared, and now I read that another thinner more efficient iPhone and MacBook Pro are on their way. More hours and days of learning these new contraptions now !!\n\nWhat does one do then ? One relies on the assistance brought to us courtesy the salesman of Apple goods. Problem is he is not there all the time, and since most issues of working occur in the middle of the night, it is really an exercise in futility. But one has to say, all inventions coming our way delve deeply on how they could make our lives easier, more efficient perhaps and an assertive effort on the complete reliance on man made machines. This many may say is true mostly in the case of communication, but I would think that in all walks of our lives there has been a penetration of technology. India, that has for long been denied this liberty, or to be generous, luxury, due to various inevitable circumstances, has relied on its home grown cottage industry, and surprisingly because of the economic disparity, continues to operate despite odds. Science and its advancement has done wonders for most of the world, but at a cost, which sadly India has not been able to have access to. Under this then, the best it could do, or the best that the not so privileged could do, was to rely on age old practices. And it must be admitted that they still do rather well. The jadi booti cures of ancient times is still a marvel in the villages especially. It is the herbs and roots culture of attending to various ailments, and really, they were not too wrong. Modern medicines are but an exploration of elements found on this planet in nature. The drugs and injectables did not come in from outer space, they were here within our sphere. Its just that some great minds or ‘researchers’ or the ‘saintly ones’ found them out and administered them to effect. Ailments in those early ages were considered to be connotations of evil doing, and prayer was one of its cures. But later when the medicinal herbs came about and started giving result, the men and women that were responsible for cure were considered nothing less than supreme exalted deity. Hence the ‘saintly ones’. But why then, even now the medical profession is looked upon as being on par with godliness. To have opportunity to study the human body and attend to it, to know its functions and its intricacies is no less than a marvel.\n\nFor one that has had several encounters, it is indeed a revelation each time to learn how little is known even by the very best on the subject. Yet they labor on with the earnestness and intensity of a new comer, desperate to learn more, with the the intent of what ? To bring relief and succor to the ill and suffering. And so great is the belief on getting to know more, to bring relief, that they give assurance to the patient that were they to hold on with the medication for some time and have faith, there could be improvement in the condition in the years to come , because they have the belief that with the extensive research that is underway, there could be an improvement in the treatment and perhaps a permanent cure as well. Of course this holds good for diseases that have long term treatment prospects, but with the kind of faith that doctors instil in us, it makes our journey of treatment a lot more pleasant. Some illnesses have a cure which could be effective enough for a certain period of time, say 5 years, but the medical fraternity would never give a time period to the patient, ideally. Instead they would assure him or her that there could be a cure in time to come. With recent scientific developments, they now discover that you could set your DNA according to your wishes, you could avoid the presence of certain ailments and so on …\n\nModern gadgetry will and shall continue now to guide the medical profession towards perfection. With each passing day hundreds of enlightened brains work tirelessly to find to explore to invent better and more effective cures. Perhaps with greater advantage for and with the Western world. Their reliance on the machine is a must. And they have done sufficient work on it for it to give them results or insights which perhaps an external examination, one, that is more prevalent in India say, or the more developing countries, is unable to provide. Cost and finance is a major hurdle. Investment in these high end machines is professionally a must for the betterment of those that suffer. But how does the investor get his return. He gets his return from its usage and the subsequent fee that will be charged for it. A fee that most patients in our part of the world are unable to afford. A fee which the State is unable to give subsidy for. The result then is that the high end investigation equipments may not find place in our system. There is thus a greater reliance on physical examinations by the professional doctors and an assessment of the ailment accordingly. Now many may consider this to be a handicap, but I would think that it makes the local doctor then perhaps a little more proficient.\n\nMany a times I have been to a store in the United States, bought some goods, looked at the price, paid an amount and known what change I should get back. Not so with the lady behind the cash counter. Until she feeds it into the computer at her disposal and the machine tells her how much change given in excess needs to be returned, she will not accept any verbal consideration from you. Many a times, when the cash counter lady has struggled with the machine, and you have beaten her to it with the correct amount to be reimbursed, there is astonished surprise – ‘ how the heck did you get that, you got a calculator hidden somewhere, sir ?’. ‘Nope, just did it mentally !’. ‘You a smart brain, where you from – India ?’. ‘ Yes ma’am !’. ‘Ahh .. thought as much, you guys got brains, good at Math !’\n\nThere is but no denying the fact that machine efficiency does provide a better sense of the evaluation of the problem. And we all hope and pray that modern research and development does indeed come through with better solutions. With each new discovery there shall be the advantage and the disadvantage linked in. We have lost the benefit of knowing the correct word to write or spell on our laptops. The computer does this for us. Is this one of the reasons why, when we send text messages on the mobile v tnd 2 rt lik so !??\n\nHmm .. worth a thought !\n\nAnd heck !! I just spoke to my iPhone 4S to ask the time, weather and condition for Mumbai, and it spoke back to me, somewhat rudely to say it was time …\n\nSo good morning again …or so my iPhone 4S tells me .. seriously .. there is an App., on it that facilitates this !"
