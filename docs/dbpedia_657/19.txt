(and in brackets the officer's graduating class of the Naval Academy at Etajima, if applicable).

(M) Behind the name indicates a merchant marine (civilian) officer.

Rank as was at the date he took command, whether as supervisor or captain.

If an officer is shown as being in command before the ship was commissioned, he was Chief Equipping Officer, becoming Commanding Officer on the date the ship was commissioned.
