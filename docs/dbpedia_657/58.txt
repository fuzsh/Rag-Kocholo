A very welcoming community. I joined a year ago and have been coming since. If you are new to Aikido, you can find here a group of Aikidoka that are open to teaching you. If you are advanced, you will find many black belts to train with. The chief instructor, Brooks Sensei, is a great, devoted teacher who truly cares about his students. Also, the dojo is large and it has AC!

My cousin has been coming here for over a year and I've observed several classes. Everyone is super friendly, welcoming, and are very happy to take the time to help beginners and cater to all skill and fitness levels. The atmosphere is one of respect, compassion, hard work, and friendly humor.

They've really helped my cousin build her confidence, and her skills and strength have improved exponentially in a short period of time. They have you work on different techniques against several partners in each lesson, so there's never a shortage of variation and action. There is also no shortage of passionate and knowledgeable people with whom to connect, learn, and practice.

Seeing my cousin's experience there, her deep love for it and her happiness with herself, I highly recommend this dojo to anyone interested in taking up Aikido or any traditional martial arts.

I've had the distinct opportunity to know Instructor Glenn Brooks both personally and professionally for over 15 years.

When called-upon, Glenn has provided 'Personal Protection' and 'Personal Affairs Management' for my VIP Clients, some of whom are recognized as international icons in their field...

Additionally, in my work with the 'US Department of Defense (DOD)' I've enlisted Glenn's team at AoS to prepare me personally in the area of martial arts for tactical operations in hostile zones throughout the world.

Personally, Glenn has become a true friend and mentor of which I cannot imagine facing any situation, personal or professional, without him at my side.

Onward, Upward, Always, Together with Glenn Brooks and Aikido of Scottsdale!

Come and see a class for yourself what a special place this really is. I give my highest compliments of Sensei Brooks and the incredibly positive experience provided by this dojo and all the students involved. You would be hard pressed to find a better group of people, dojo, Sensei, or martial art to study. Becoming a student at Aikido of Scottsdale is one of the best decisions I have ever made and one I am happy to share with my son who is also a student.

I have been to many Aikido schools, and this is without a doubt the best school I have attended. Brooks Shihan is a 7th Degree Black Belt with over 40 years of experience in the art. His classes are both serious and fun, and he has the ability to make the more difficult aspects of Aikido accessible to the new learner. The students and teachers are friendly and welcoming, and I look forward to training every time I go there.

My children have been in the youth class for almost a year. It has been satisfying to see their skills and confidence grow. Aikido is a great way for them to move their bodies and learn self-defense with big smiles on their faces. One of the things I appreciate most about Aikido of Scottsdale is how the older students and adults will assist in the youth classes. This mentorship encourages young students to continue in their training and promotes a family atmosphere. Senpais Stu and Tal do a great job with the little kids.
