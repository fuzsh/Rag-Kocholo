Despite his tenacious effort to save Japan from taki ng its tragic path, Konoe was desti ned to fail and face the fate of the nation ­ the ultimate defeat and national humiliation of foreign occupation - and the tragic finale of his own life on December 16, 1945, four months after Japan's fal l . This book attempts t o portray i n a fai r fashion this tumultuous expe­ rience of Konoe as Japan's most decorated court noble and politician and yet a grossly m isunderstood individual . It consists of six chapters. The first chapter is a brief sketch of Konoe's upbringing, educational background, and political training. It is highlighted by the publication of Konoe's sensational and controversial article \" Rej ect the Anglo-American­ Centered Peace,\" Konoe's first meeti ng with his political \"mentor,\" Prince Saionj i K i n moch i , Konoe's disappointing experience at the Paris Peace Conference, and his effort to reform the House of Peers . The second chapter describes the tumultuous 1930s and the rise of Konoe as a \" Messier\" -like figure who would save the deeply troubled nation, characterized by rapidly emerging right-wi ng militarism, the decline of party politics, and the development of political conflict between Saionj i and Konoe over the issue of determ ining the course Japan should pursue . The third chapter talks about Konoe's first cabinet . The focus of this chapter is the China Incident, which took place only a month after Konoe's i nauguration as Prime M i nister in June 1937, and Konoe's endeavor to ach ieve a diplomatic settlement of the incident with the nationalist gov­ ernment of China in order to stop the deterioration of Japan's relation­ s h i p with the Western powers subsequent to the incide n t . The chapter ends with the illustration of Konoe's frustration and disappointment when he had to step down from premiership, and was replaced by a contrasting ligu re , H i ranuma Kiichiro, k nown to be lacon ic and cautious.\n\n2\n\nPreface\n\nThe fourth and fifth chapters deal with Konoe's return to the pre mier­ ship, his continuous effort to achieve a settlement of the China I ncident , h i s engage ment i n U.S . - Japan diplomatic talks. These chapters provide detailed accounts of a series of policies Konoe undertook, starting with national mobilization, the creation of the National Service Association ( Taisei Yokusankai ) , the Wang Chi ng-wei maneuver, the Tripartite Pact, and Konoe's proposed summit with Franklin Roosevelt. As discussed in the fifth chapter, the readers of this book should find the most shi n i ng moment of Konoe's political life i n his attempt to achieve a diplomatic set­ tlement with the United States. Contrary to Konoe's general reputation as a weak and indecisive pol itician , he was tenacious and firmly com m itted to the cause . The last chapter describes Konoe's war experience and the twilight of his life from the end of the war to his death on December 16, 1945. It also talks about Konoe's effort to ach ieve an early term i nation of the war, his reaction to Japan's defeat, his expectations of and involvement in the after­ math of the defeat , and the irony of his fate that led to Konoe's suicide. My overall aim with this book is to provide not only a fai r account of Konoe and his role as a politician but also a concisely written descrip­ tion of the turbulent era of Japanese politics from the 1920s to the end of 1945. Such success as I have achieved would have never been possible with­ out the assistance I have received from various i nstitutions and indiv idu­ als. F irst of all, a word of appreciation goes to Florida State University and the Association for the Asian Studies, I nc . Both in stitutions prov ided me with monetary assistance. Their generosity made it possible for me to con­ duct productive research at the Library of Congress and elsewhere . I am also thankful to Dr. Winston W. Lo, Dr. Neil T. Jumonville, and Dr. Peter P. Garretson of Florida State University, Professor Kondo Masaomi of Daito Bunka Un iversity i n Tokyo, and the staff of the Asian Reading Center at the Library of Congress for the various suggestions, encouragement, and assistance I have received from them . I owe them a great deal for making it possible for me to complete this project. My special thanks also go to my former schoolmates Dr. Roy Camp­ bell and Dr. James Maynor, Jr., who spent many hours on proofreadi ng and editing my entire manuscript. I would l ike to express my gratitude also to M r. Yang Jun-gi n , doctoral candidate at Florida State University, who kindly helped me to have proper pronunciation of Chinese names and words. Thanks to these individuals, many errors that I would have made otherwise, have been avoided . The errors that re m a i n are of course mine alone .\n\nPreface\n\n3\n\nLastly, my greatest appreciation goes to my wife, Frances. Without the cooperation and sacrifices she made to support me in many ways, my man uscript would have never been completed . I n the text that follows, all Japanese and Chinese personal names are written i n an Oriental style - a surname first followed by a given name .\n\nIn troduc tion At dawn on December 16, 1945, just a few hours before he was to appear at Sugamo Prison i n Tokyo as a war criminal, Konoe Fum imaro, the former Prime M i n ister of Japan , was found dead . He had killed him­ self by taking potassium cyanide. He was 54. For Japan, the death of Konoe was far more than a tragic finale of his life . It also symbolized the end of the most turbulent and critical epoch Japan had ever witnessed. It was the time in which Japan , along with Ger­ many and Italy, had challenged the world's existing pol itical, econom ic, and ideological structures. Democracy and capitalism were put on trial by two newly risi ng ideologies: Fascism and Nazism. Parallel to this turbulent and dynam ic epoch- making struggle were the equally tumultuous challenges Japan faced i nternally. The right-wing nationalists, the driving force for Japan's challenge to the existing world order, attempted to dismantle Japan's adopted western pol itical and eco­ nomic systems, seeing them as i n sufficient, outmoded for carrying out their mission , and, more importantly, the root cause of destruction of the i n digenous national cha racter. They challenged the status quo of pro­ western authority, parliamentary government, party politics, and capital­ ism. It was an attempt to undo what had been established through the Meij i Restoration and the subsequent modernization , and to restart Japan's quest by creating a new system that would be more applicable to national spirit than the existing system . Japan found itself on the verge of a stormy political and economic reform movement that was later called the Showa Restoration . It div ided Japanese society intricately and critically over the d i rection the nation should take . The rapid rise of m ilitarism and politi­ cal i nstability was further intensi fied by factionalism i n the military and pol itics i n the late 1920s and early 1930s. The background of this rise of militarism and right-wing national­ ism i s traced to major i n ternational occurrences, particularly Japan's involvement i n China. It began when Japan emerged as a victor first i n the Si 110- Japanese Wa r in 1 8 95 and again a decade later in the Russo-Japanese\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nWar in 1905. These v ictories brought Japan onto the world stage of pol i­ tics, consequently creating tension between Japan and the other major powers, first with the Soviet Union and later with the Anglo-Saxon pow­ ers . Despite the military clash i n 1 8 9 5 , at the begin n i ng of the twentieth century the Sino-Japanese relationship was not necessarily characterized by an imosity only. For i nstance, convi nced that Ch ina had to follow Japan's success in modernization, a considerable number of Chi nese students came to Japan to study. By 1906, the number of Chinese students studyi ng i n Japan had reached 1,300. 1 The most promi nent o f these students was Sun Yat-sen, who lived in Japan from 1897 to 1903, using it as the base for his revolutionary activities. These students, i ncludi ng Sun , established a good relationship with the Japanese leaders who were sympathetic to their rev­ olutionary cause . Among those Japanese leaders were u ltranationalist Toyama M i tsuru, future Prime M i n ister I n ukai Tsuyosh i , and radical socialists Kotoku Shusui and Kita I kk i . Many Japanese also went t o China, motivated b y various reasons. Some went there out of a sense of altruism , some for the spirit of adven­ ture, and some for the cause of Japanese imperialism. Among the m , most memorable is Kita I kki . As a strong advocate of socialism , Kita went to China twice in 1 9 1 1 and 1916 to support the Chi nese Revolution .2 It took little time, however, before the Sino-Japanese relationship turned sour as Japan began to exploit Chi na's political i nstability. After the fall of the Manchu dynasty i n 1 9 1 1 , Yuan Shih-k'ai established a repub­ lic, along with Sun Yat-sen. China later became divided , however, when Yuan arbitrarily tried to establish his own dynasty. Then , after the death of Yuan in 19 16, China entered the era of wa rlords. Despite Sun Yat- sen's effort to unify the nation under his three principles - nationalism , democ­ racy, and people's l ivel ihood - Chi na's political i n stability was worsened, creating an opportunity for Japan to take advantage of the situation for political and econom ic exploitation . The most notorious action taken by Japan was the submission of the Twenty-one Demands to China in 1915. With other major powers unable to intervene on behalf of China because of their preoccupation with World War I, Yuan Shih-k'ai had no choice but to accept the Japanese demands . Naturally this acceptance raised enormous outrage among the Chinese nationals . Such outrage was further i ntensified with the 1919 Versailles Peace Settlement, which accepted the Japanese demand to legalize Japan's control over both Shantung and the Pacific islands that were formerly owned by Germany. This outrage resulted in a nationwide anti-Japanese movement known as the May Fourth Movement, led by students and i n t ellectuals .\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nDespite this continuous turmoil i n Ch i na, the following decade of the 1920s was considered a period of international cooperation . It began with the Washi ngton Conference i n 1921-22 at which a series of agreements were made . F irst , i n 1 9 2 1 , i n the Four Power Pacific Treaty, the Un ited States, Great Britain , France, and Japan agreed to maintai n the status quo of each nation in terms of their possessions i n the Pacific . This was fol­ lowed in 1922 by the F ive Power Naval Treaty ( the above four nations plus Italy), which was meant to achieve naval arms reduction , and the Nine Power Treaty ( the nations in the F ive Power Naval Treaty plus the Nether­ lands, Belgium, Portugal , and China ) , which dealt with the principles and policies regard i ng Chi nese issues. Along with the other major powers, Japan signed these treaties. Shidehara Kij u ro, one of the Japanese delegates to the conference, became Foreign Minister shortly after the conference and promoted harmonious foreign policy, so-called Shidehara Diplomacy. Then, i n 1925, the Treaty of Locarno was signed by France, Germany, and Great Brita i n as a mechanism to establish a mutual security. Under this treaty, Germany became a member of the League of Nations and pledged to settle any future problems in a peaceful fashion . The 1928 Kellogg­ Briand Pact followed the Treaty of Locarno. All major powers but Russia signed it. The pact denounced all wars except those for self-defense . Seem­ i ngly, Wilsonian democracy was indeed on the way to becom ing reality. As it turned out , however, the era of peace had little substance. In the Nine Power Treaty, the signatory nations made a pledge to respect the sovereign ty, i ndependence, and territorial integrity of China. They also agreed to respect the principle of the Open Door policy - equal oppor­ tunity in com merce in China for all nations. No nation , however, actu­ ally had any i n tention of followi ng up on these principles, refusing to renounce the u nequal treaties imposed on China during the n i n eteenth century. Thus, it was rather i nevitable that this decade- long period of inter­ national cooperation would come to a halt when the U.S. stock market crashed in 1929, fol lowed by worldwide and unprecedented economic depression . Japan was one of the nations most severely hit by this eco­ nom ic collapse . Boosted by the war economy associated with World War I , Japan had been i n good shape econom ically until the end ofthe 1910s. Shortly after the war was over, however, the Japanese economy began to decline. After the catastrophic earthquake on September 1 , 1923, Japan was al ready facing an economic crisis by the eve of the 1929 stock market c rash in the United States .3 Hence, the impact of the stock market crash o n Ja p an and the following depression was enormous . As will be discussed l a t er, a l o n g with this economic p roble m , by the late 1920s Japan became\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\npolitically and socially unstable as shown in the decline of party politics and the rapid rise of m ilitarism and right-wi ng national ism. The Manchurian I ncident i n 193 1 was one ram ification of such polit­ ical, social, and economic turmoil, and this was followed by a series of political assassi nations and coups d'etat i n the 1930s. Then the Marco Polo Bridge I ncident took place in 1937. Although i n itially considered to be a m i nor incident, it quickly escalated into a major war between Japan and China, causing apprehension in the West about Japan's aggression as a growing threat to their i n terests i n the Far East and Southeast Asia. It was the begin n i ng of a shift in the nature of the Sino-Japanese conflict , from regional to global . The West began to put econom ic pressure on Japan th rough sanctions . In order to deal with such i ncreasi ng menaces, Japan took a series of countermeasures: national mobilization , the creation of the new political structure, the Wang Ching-wei maneuver, the Tripartite Pact , and then, as the last resort , seeking a diplomatic settlement of the Sino-Japanese con flict through i n tensive negotiations with the United States. None, however, bore fruit, resulting i n Japan's Pearl Harbor assault at the end of 194 1 . It was during this critical period in Japan's prewa r era, 1937- 194 1 , that Konoe took t h e center stage of Japanese pol itics. Becom ing Prime Min ister th ree times during this short period, he took far greater respon­ sibility than any pol itician could ever imagine in Japan's effort to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis. As history has witnessed, however, Konoe failed. This failure resulted in not only his personal tragedy but also i n great national tragedy. It brought Japan i nto a \"doomed\" conflict with the United States and ended in devastating defeat , followed by the humiliat­ ing experience of submitting to the occupation of foreign powers. Not surprisingly, the robust popularity Konoe received i n the prewar era plummeted . Along with Tojo, he became a prime target of the public i n their quest to find someone who ought to be responsible for Japan's defeat . Similarly, before the war, journalists and academicians had treated Konoe as a rising star. They praised Konoe as someone who could save Japan from national crisis. These same people, however, became critical in their postwar assessment of Konoe. Most of the postwar writi ngs on Konoe have one thing in common : an assertion that it was his character flaws ( a weak mind and i ndecisiveness ) that ultimately caused Konoe's failure, making h i m frequently bungle at crucial moments. One may find this assertion plausible because Konoe was fundamen­ tally irresolute, and he hi mself was aware of it. It was i ndeed this aware­ ness that partially made him reluctant to lead the nation. In 1936, when the Okada cab i net fell after the February Twcn t y-s i x I ncidc n t , Pri nee\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nSaionj i ( 1849-194 0 ) , as a Genro, recom mended Konoe to the Emperor as Okada's successor, but Konoe turned down the recommendation . 4 Clearly, Konoe's own doubt about himself with regard to his suitability for lead­ ership was one factor i n his decision. No matter how plausible it seems, however, the above assertion is difficult to sustai n . Konoe's reign came at the time when Japan was goi ng through its most difficult time i nternally and external ly. Internally Japan was i ntricately div ided, particularly with regard to coordi nation between the civilian government and the m i litary. With the rapid decline of the political parties in the early 1930s and the simultaneously rising mil itary power, the civilian government and the military became too estranged to make a coordinated effort to deal with many pressi ng issues. The m ilitary began to function as i f it were an autonomous i nstitution , mak i ng it extremely hard for the civilian government to enact any effective pol icies. When Konoe took office i n 1937, with the recently re- i n stituted require­ ment of selecting an Army Minister from among the act ive generals, the m i litary had almost reached the point of havi ng absolute autonomy, keep­ i ng the government often unaware of ongoing m ilitary action s . Konoe took various efforts to alter the situation ; however, none succeeded . Externally as well, Konoe had little capacity to have any control over u n folding i nternational events, as i ndicated in the following examples. In 1937, Japan concl uded the Anti-Comintern All iance with Germany and I ta ly. The i n itial reason for Japan to join this alliance was to check Com­ mu nist expansion and the Soviet threat to Japanese interests in Manchuria and northern China. It was, however, abruptly shattered by the German­ Sov i et Non-Aggression Pact in August 1939. Then, in late 1 940, the Konoe government leaned toward the Tripartite Pact. This time, Konoe hoped that t he Soviet Union would be on the side of the Axis in order to keep the l l n i ted States out of the European conflict . Konoe's hope, however, was once again shattered by the German decision to invade the Soviet Union i n June 194 1 . To Konoe, this made the pact mean ingless . O n e has t o wonder how relevant Konoe's personality would have been with regard to these two 1 ; c r m an decisions. After this debacle over the Tripartite Pact, Konoe real­ lied t h at the only option left for him to save Japan from a fatal confronta1 i' 1 1 1 with the Allied powers was to reach a diplomatic settlement with the \\lnited States to solve the China Inc ident . Once again Konoe faced a situ­ .11 ion t h a t was too much for him to cope with . Neither Japan nor the Un ited '•Lilt'S was able to compromise over the U.S. key demand for reaching a diplomatic settlement with Japan - a total withdrawal of the Japanese troops lr om C h i n a and Indo-China. Although Konoe displayed unusual tenacity .111d assntivcness in his effort, he was destined to fail from the outset .\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nThus, i n ternally and externally, Konoe had little con trol over the unfolding events, making the assertion that he ultimately failed because of his character flaws superficial at best . Taking into consideration this perfunctory and stereotyped assertion , this study attempts to produce a more fai r and balanced account of Konoe and h i s era. Accordi ngly, it focuses little on Konoe's character but instead makes a close exa m i nation of how the external and i nternal circum stances of Japanese pol itics and economy shaped Konoe's policy making. The sources used for this study are both secondary and primary. While some secondary sources such as Konoe Fumimaro by Yabe Teij i , The Road to the Pacific War ( eight volumes by the Academy of Japan Interna­ tional Politics- Study Group on the Cause of Pacific War ) , Konoe Fumi­ maro: Emperor, Military, a nd Na tion by Okada Takeo, and n u me rous contemporary articles, mostly written i n the 1930s and early 1940s, pro­ vide good background, the bulk of this study relies on primary sources.5 The most significant and useful are the two writi ngs by Konoe himself, Seida nroku and Ushinawa resh i Seiji (Lost Politics), and the diary of Harada Kumao.6 Seida nroku, consisting of various essays by Konoe, is an excellent source for understanding his personality and the roots of his ideological and political thoughts . Ushinawareshi Seiji is a memoir covering the period from Konoe's first cabi net to the end of the Pacific war. It provides i n great detail an account of Konoe's political i nvolvements over the major issues . Dia ry of Harada Kumao is a set of nine volumes. Throughout his diary, Harada, a personal secretary of Prince Saionj i with wide- rangi ng personal associations with those who shaped the most turbulent era of Japanese modern history, prov ides the i nside stories of contemporary Japanese pol­ itics. It is a great source i n helping us to understand the complex and divided nature of Japanese politics. In addition, the documents Kido Koichi, the diaries of Kido Koichi, Ugaki , and Yabe, the memoirs of Cordell Hull and Joseph C. Grew, and Konoe's numerous public speeches and state­ ments also provide i mportant i n formation that gives added depth to this study. Incidentally, except for very few materials, most of the sources used for this study are written in Japanese . Accordingly, most of the quotes in this study are translations from Japanese to English . Little work on Konoe has been done by non- Japanese scholars. The Sea rch for a New Political Order: Konoe Fumimaro, the Political Parties, a nd japa 11ese Politics During the Early Showa Era by Gordon M . Berger is the only significant work done\n\nby a non-Japanese scholar. Considering the scarcity of work on KorHJl' in English, although this study is not particularly addressed to a non Japanl'Sl' audience, it will m ake\n\nIn troduction\n\nll\n\na significant contribution by providing a rare account of Konoe i n English for non-Japanese readers . It is rather strange to find that , despite Konoe's stature and the crucial role he played - in many ways greater than Tojo's­ Western scholars have pai d l i ttle attention to Konoe. While that alone makes this study significant, as stated earlier, the p rimary significance of this study comes from the establishment of a better understandi ng of one of the most unfairly assessed political figures, Konoe Fum imaro, and his role in modern Japanese h istory. It has been six decades since the end of World War I I . Yet the ramifications of that war are still relevant to our lives, making historians continuously reengage i n writing on the war i n order to better understand i t . In such engagement, it is a firm belief of the author of this study that a proper understandi ng of Konoe and his role is indis­ pensable .\n\n1\n\nKonoe's Background and Upbringing On October 12, 1891, Konoe Fumimaro was born i n Tokyo as an heir of the Prince Konoe fam ily, the head of the five regency fam i l i es . ' His mythological ancestry goes back even to the prehistoric age of the gods in close association with the Imperial family. According to legend, the founder of the Konoe family, Amemokoyane no Mikoto, ranked h ighest among the gods who greeted Nin igino Mikoto, grandson of the goddess Amaterasu, on his descent to Japanese soil, and from him sprang the Fuj iwara fam ­ ily.2 The Fujiwara family for centuries had conducted ceremonial affairs of the I mperial Court and played an i mportant role i n national develop­ ment. It is well k nown historically that Fujiwara Kamatari , one of the most powerful figures of the Fuj iwa ra family, played a significant role in the success of the AD 645 Taika Reforms (Great Political Reform s ) . During t he Fuj iwara Period ( 894-c . 1200 ) , Japan m ade enormous cultural growth, and generation after generation the Fuj iwara family played the role of regent giv i ng pol itical assistance to the Emperor. Konoe was a di rect descendant of this extremely disti nguished noble court family, Fuj iwara. One of the descendants of the Fujiwara family, Motomichi, took the name of Konoe. He resigned from the post of regent in 1202 when he was 1 1 nable to get along with Mi namoto Yoritomo, who ended the rule of the long-lasting aristocracy by establish i ng a feudal government in Kamakura i n 1 1 8 3 . Then Yoritomo took the policy of separation of the regency, cre­ .1 t i ng five regent fam i l ies, i ncluding the Konoe fam i ly as head rege n t . 3 rvtcanwhile, t h e seventeenth generation of t h e Fujiwara fam ily, Nobutada, did not have any sons . The fourth son of the Emperor, Goyosei , became h is heir. This was the direct infusion of imperial blood i nto the Konoe l.11nily.\n\nWith this im pressive noble birth, Konoe was destined to have a pres­ t q:ious futur e . Indeed, he had prestige in his public life except during the h1 il'l period of the post-World War II era. In his private life, however, he\n\n14\n\nKonoe Fumimaro and the Failure of Peace in Japan\n\nwas not so fortunate . Literally from the moment of his birth, Konoe's life was struck by tragedy. His mother Sawako died from the complications of childbirth, only e ight days after Konoe's birth . She was only twenty-th ree years old. A year later, Konoe's father, Atsumaro, married Sawako's sister, Motoko, giving Konoe one half brother and three half sisters. Konoe was not told that Motoko was not his birth mother. When the truth was finally revealed to h i m , he was already a young adult. Having kept believing that Motoko was his real mother, he was deeply shocked and greatly affected emotionally by this news. In his later years, Konoe had repeatedly said, \"Until I reached adult age, I had been made to believe that my stepmother Motoko was my real mother. After the truth was revealed to me, I could not help thi nking that the world was full of lies .\"4 The second tragedy struck Konoe when he was fourteen years old ­ the death of his father, Atsumaro, at the age of forty-two. Born with a dili­ gent and rather aggressive nature, Atsumaro had excelled in h i s l i fe , particularly at school . I n A p r i l 1 8 8 5 , when Prince Saionj i K i n moc h i ( 1849-1940) left Japan for Europe a s a minister to Austria, Atsumaro fol­ lowed Saionji across the ocean to study abroad . He spent more than five years in Germany.5 In September 1890, he returned to Japan and began to get involved in politics. Despite his youth, Atsumaro became remarkably successful i n a short time . In 1895 he became the head of Gakushuin ( an academic institution for court nobles ) , and in the following year became the president of the House of Peers. He was only thirty-two years old. Atsumaro was a supporter of constitutionalism i n i nternal politics, and i n foreign affairs he was a strong advocate of nationalism.6 This aspect was particularly promi nent in his view on East Asia. After Japan's v ictory in the S i no - Japanese War of 1 8 94-95 , sensing an i nc reasing tension between Western imperial powers i n East Asia and Japan as a newly emerging Asian power, Atsumaro became an initiatory figure i n advocat­ ing a policy of East Asian security - defending East Asia from Western i mperialism. To enhance his cause, he set up the East Asian Study Club i n 1898 and also the National Club of Comrades i n 1 900. He began to dis­ tance h i mself from Pri nce Saionj i K i n mochi and Ito H i robum i , the founder and president of Seiyuka i , who were i ncli ned to take a conc ilia­ tory policy toward the West . It is interesti ng to note that Konoe Fumi maro was destined to share his father's thoughts about East Asia. There is no indication in Konoe's writing, however, that he was directly i nfluenced by his father's political thoughts . He was only fourteen years old when Atsumaro died. Also, Konoe did not take any serious i nterest in politics until he was nearing graduation from college . It is not d i fficu l t to spec u late, however, that as\n\n1-Konoe's Background and Upbringing\n\n15\n\nKonoe got involved in politics, his particular interest in Chinese affairs was infl uenced by his father's strong concern for China. So, undoubtedly Atsumaro made a great success i n the political arena. At the same time, however, his politically v igorous and unorthodox activ­ ities created adversaries and exhausted the family fortune, throwing the family i nto considerable debt. When Atsumaro died, the Konoe fam ily was by no means well off. Recalling the unpleasant experience he had shortly after h i s father's death, Konoe wrote, \"When my father was alive, various people came to see us from morning to n ight . I was constantly flattered even though I was only a small child. After his death, all this suddenly ceased . Those who had been taken care of by my father now completely changed their atti­ tudes toward us and urged us to pay back money my father allegedly bor­ rowed from them . Because we did not have much money, we used our valuable possessions to clear our debts. One wealthy fellow refused to accept our offer and kept returning what we gave h i m . \" 7 Embittered by the experience, Konoe became rebellious toward the world around h i m . During his j u n i o r h igh a n d h igh school years, Konoe confined himself al most entirely to reading. As Konoe h i m self pointed out, he became a gloomy young man. 8 In 1909 Konoe entered h igh school, and he initially took an interest in philosophy. Strongly i n fluenced by his German and philosophy teacher, I wamoto Tei , he began to think of choosi ng a profession in philosophy. When he was a sen ior, however, social studies became more attractive to h i m . Konoe first studied philosophy at Tokyo I mperial Un iversity. Then , shortly after, he transferred to Kyoto I mperial University and enrolled i n t he Department of Law. He spent most of his time, however, studying soci­ o logy u nder the well-known Marxist scholar Kawakam i Hajime. While at Kyoto Imperial University, Konoe translated Oscar Wilde's '/he Soul of Ma n Under Socialism i nto Japanese . lt appeared in the May and lu ne 1 9 14 issues of the third series of the journal Shin Sh icho. Because of t hl· book's radical content, however, these issues were banned.9 Although it is not clear why Konoe translated Oscar Wilde's book, this translation dl' monstrates Konoe's ideological i nclination at that time . 1 0 What should I )t' no t e d here is that it was during this particular period of his life when 1 hl' ideological foundation of Konoe's political thought was bei ng shaped . A nother memorable event during Konoe's university period was his 111 s t meeting with Saionj i Kin moch i . I n 1912, Saionj i's second cabinet fel l w hl' n i t faced the dispute with the army regarding establish i ng two addi ­ l lt 11 1 a l divisions. H o m e Min ister K a tsura Ta ro replaced Saionj i a n d formed hi\\ t hird cabinet. This triggered a rising concern about the tyran nical\n\nKonoe Fumimaro and the Failure of Peace in Japan\n\n16\n\nKonoe fumimaro (left) in his youth with his younger brothers and sisters\n\n(«)\n\nMainichi Photo Hank).\n\npower of military cliques and a growing bureaucracy, which developed into a nationwide movement to protect constitutional government. Through this movement, Konoe began to be interested in politics and also to develop a favorable image of Saionji.11 As mentioned above, however, because of the political tensions between his father and Saionji and also because of the absence of a close relationship between the Konoe family and the Saionji family, Konoe had never seen Saionji. Nonetheless, one day Konoe felt like seeing Saionji and went to see him without even a letter of introduction. According to Konoe, this meeting left him with quite a bad impression. The Konoe family had a higher noble status than Saionji's, and Saionji addressed Konoe accord­ ingly, calling him \"Your Excellency.\" Being a university student and still wearing the school uniform, Konoe thought that Saionji was making fun of him. Offended, Konoe did not see Saionji again until he had graduated from Kyoto Imperial University in On November II,\n\n1918,\n\n19 17.\n\na year after his graduation, the First World\n\nWar came to an end with the Allied victory. Shortly before, on the night of November\n\n6,\n\nKonoe wrote an essay, \"Eibeihoni no Heiwashugi o Haisu\n\n(Reject the Anglo-American-Centered Peace).\"12 It was published in the December\n\n15, 1 9 1 8 ,\n\nissue of the journal\n\nNilwn oyo/1i Nilwnjin (Japan a lUI\n\n1-Konoe's Background and Upbringing\n\n17\n\nJapanese). It is difficult to overemphasize the significance of this essay. It\n\nrepresents the essence of Konoe's ideological views. It is the foundation and key to understanding his later policy making. Throughout his entire political career, Konoe never wavered from these views. 1 3 He wrote :\n\nDemocracy and humanitarianism will be the dominant ideologies in the coming postwar era, and this will have a grave impact on Japan as a member of the world community. One has to remember, however, the essence of democracy and humanitarianism is the equality of all human beings. Nation­ ally, it means civil rights and international recognition of equal right of exis­ tence and opportunity for each nation, forbidding any special rights and monopolies. Such rights are eternal and a fundamental rule of human moral­ ity, and it is nonsense to say that this rule is not applicable to the Japanese constitution. What is regrettable, however, is that, today, Japanese leaders tend to follow blindly an Anglo-American version of democracy and humanitarianism, and, therefore, fail to see its true nature. In Bernard Shaw's book, Fate and Man, Napoleon says the following: \"The English are good at using moral and reli­ gious feeling to express their own desire. Furthermore, once one makes his or her ambition holy and makes it public, it takes determination to accomplish his or her goal. While daring to commit robbery and plunder, the English always have a moral excuse, and while advocating freedom and independ­ ence, they divide up the world under the name of colony and squeeze profit from them.\" The Anglo-Americans all conclude that it is German despotism and mili­ tarism that have brought such a major disturbance to world peace. Germany is an enemy of humanity. Therefore, Germany has to be punished in order to preserve justice and humanity. Accordingly, this war is a fight for democracy and humanitarianism against despotism and militarism, for justice against violence, and for virtue against evil. One cannot help feeling deeply hateful toward the German disregard for justice and humanity and the atrocities they committed. Also, it is natural that the Anglo-Americans condemn such atrocities. It is, however, a shrewd and unacceptable argument by the Anglo-Americans to say that a man has to be an enemy against justice and humanity because he has disturbed the peace. Such an argument becomes possible only when one assumes that the prewar situation of Europe was the best from the standpoint of justice and humanity. One has to wonder who has assumed that the prewar situation in Europe had been the best for justice and humanity, therefore, anyone who disturbs it ought to be punished as an enemy of humankind! The European conflict is a fight between the accomplished nations and the unaccomplished nations and between those who find the preservation of the status quo beneficial and those who find the destruction of the status quo beneficial. The former demands peace, and the latter demands war. There­ lore, peace does not necessarily always bring justice and humanity, and mili­ tarism is not necessarily always against justice and humanity. The Anglo-American peace is only based on a principle of \"safety first\" by 1 hose who find the preservation of the stat us quo beneficial, and it has noth­ ing to do with justice and humanity. It is snvile that, when Japan, consider-\n\n18\n\nKonoe Fumimaro and the Failure o f Peace i n Japan\n\ning its international standing, should be advocating the destruction of the status quo along with Germany and Italy, our leaders, intoxicated by the \"beautiful words\" of the Anglo-Americans and influenced by an Anglo­ American-centered peace, consider peace equal to humanity and long for the League of Nations as a God-given device. One should not oppose the League of Nations but congratulate it if it is organized truly around the idea of jus­ tice and humanity. There is, however, the possibility that the League of Nations might create a situation where the established nations confine the non-established nations politically and economically, and, therefore, the latter have to get behind the former permanently. In short, it is the Anglo­ Americans who get the most benefit from the League of Nations. The others, although they joined the League under the pretense of justice and humanity, get almost no benefits. On the contrary, they are obliged to get weaker politi­ cally and economically. This is an intolerable situation not only with regard to Japan's position but also with regard to justice and humanity in general. As for Japan's entering the League of Nations at the upcoming Peace Confer­ ence, therefore, the central questions Japan cannot fail to address are the end of economic imperialism and nondiscriminatory treatment of the Asians by the Caucasians. The threat to justice and humanity is not just militarism alone. Although the world has been saved from the hail of bullets with the defeat of Germany, what threatens the equal right of existence for each nation is not a rm s alone. In essence, economic imperialism is equal to military impnialism, and it a lso should be resisted. 14 a y ear after Konoe's graduation from that he was not just a literary and 111•hk young man hut a lso someone with potential to be a fine politician . 1 5 I t I'• indl't'd 'ignilicu1t whl·n one considers that the essay was written not n n l ) h)' 'II' h . 1 youn� 111.1n hut a lso at the time when Germany had just lw,·n dl'lt·.ltl'd .llld t l w villo r i o u s Anglo-American powers were proclaim ­ ing tlwmsdves t l w r h a m p i on o f justice a n d h u m anity. 1\\onoe's essa y was, t h e refor e , in a sense unti mely, but it was insight­ lui. What fo l l owe d after the Peace Conference proves that the questions Konoe raised were on ta rget . It can be quickly recalled here that the fail­ ure to resolve the questions of colonialism , racism, and econom ic unfair­ ness was one key factor, if not the only factor, that led to another worldwide conflict only two decades later. A month after the publication of Konoe's essay, on Jan uary 18, 1919, the Paris Peace Conference began, and Saionji Kinmochi was chosen to head the delegation from Japan . Working at the Home Ministry but still having no clear direction in terms of his career plans, Konoe seized this opportunity to shape up his future life . Konoe asked Saionji to allow him to accompany him to the conference. As Konoe himself wrote, it was a rather strange fate that he took his first journey overseas as a member of the delegation under Saionj i just like his father, Atsumaro, did thirty-four yea rs before . 1 6 This l'ssay was written only\n\nl\\1·ntn l111pnial University, i n d i c a ting\n\n'\n\n1-Konoe's Background and Upbringing\n\n19\n\nSaionj i's party left Japan for Paris on Jan uary 14, 1 9 19. On the way, when they stopped at Shangha i, two unexpected i ncidents took place. One was Konoe's encounter with the translation of his essay \" Rej ect the Anglo­ American-Centered Peace\" and a rebuttal against it in the journal Millard's Review.17 It was the work of Thomas F. Millard , an anti- Japanese Ameri­ can journalist and a chief editor of the journal . In it, Millard warned that dose attention had to be paid to the fact that the Japanese delegation i ncluded Konoe, who wrote such an anti-Anglo-Ame rican and anti­ establishment essay. Learning about Millard's warning, Saionj i censured Konoe. Other than that, there is no evidence that Konoe's accompanying Sa ionj i created any obstacle for Japan's participation i n the Peace Confer­ ence. The other unexpected event was Konoe's meeting with Sun Yat-sen, who happened to be i n Shanghai as a refugee. Sun read Konoe's essay in the Millard Review. He found so much to share i n Konoe's essay that he took the initiative to meet him. Accord i ng to Konoe, it was an uplifting meeting. He was particularly impressed by Sun Yat-sen's passionate view on the national awakening in the Far East . 1 8 These two i ncidents at Shanghai re i n forced Konoe's expectation regarding the Paris Peace Conference . To Konoe, the conference was the linest opportunity to emend the world situation for an establish ment of real peace . 1 9 It tu rned out, however, to be disappointing to Konoe. Even before the Japanese delegation reached Paris, the news they were receiv ing I rom there was discouragi ng. Konoe i ncreasingly felt betrayed. Hence, .1lter he reached Pa ris, he titled his first report to Japan \" Power Still Rules t he World . \" According to Konoe, noth i ng was mentioned at the confer­ cnce about the removal of the barrier of economic unfairness, one of the ma i n components of Wilson's Fourteen Points. Also not mentioned was 1 he i ssue concern ing freedom from racial discrimination with regard to 1111 111i gration . When the draft of the League of Nations was about to be .1dopted at the fifth convention of the Peace Conference held at the French I o reign Ministry on April 28, 1 9 1 9, the Japanese delegation asserted a ban • d r acia l discrimi nation as a condition for Japan's agreement to the League • d Na t ions. The representatives of the other powers, however, took no con­ ·o�dna t ion of Japan's assertion .20 To Konoe , as he wrote in his article, \"I mpression of Peace Conference at Paris,\" in June 1 9 19, these disappoint­ Ill): out c o mes from the conference were clear proof of the persistence of 1•own as an iron rule . 2 1 Though far from satisfactory, Konoe did not necessarily see the con­ It'! t\"IKL' as a total failure . He argued , \"Although it suffered from the severe 11111 i ngL· m e n t by European and Ame rican self-interests, the principle of \\V1botn's Fo u rte en Points, particularly with re gard to national sovereignty,\n\n20\n\nKonoe Fum imaro and the Failure of Peace in Japan\n\nat least became the core spirit of the Peace Conference and has b rought new hope to the small nations that have long suffered from oppression. In this sense, i t is i ndeed Wilson's great ach ievement that the League o f Nations has been set up. I t is a result of h i s passion and effort . H i s name, Wilson , will gloriously and eternally shine in the h istory of humankind. It would be premature to declare the ruin of idealism from the disappoint­ i ng result of the con ference . \"22 Having completed the m i ssion at the Peace Conference , Saionj i Kin­ mochi and his party left Paris for Japan on July 1 7, 1 9 19. Konoe did not accompany them but traveled to France and Germany to visit various places, i nclud i ng the University of Bonn where his father had studied more than three decades earlier. Then he went on to visit England and the United States . While having an emotional experience i n Bon n trac­ ing his father's past, Konoe also closely observed the European and Amer­ ican social structures . It helped Konoe to see Japan and its social structure objectively and comparatively, making him critical of some of the tradi­ tional aspects of Japanese societyY I n November 1 9 1 9 , Konoe finally returned to Japan. During the following decade, until the arrival of the turbulent era of the 1 930s, as a member of the House of Peers, Konoe steadily built up his political career by becomi ng involved in many issues. The most significant was the issue of reforming the House of Peers . He became a member of the House of Peers when he was still a un iversity student . With his noble court family background, a seat at the House of Peers was hereditary to h i m . As a member, he developed his concern for the role o f the House of Peers. I n his short essay \"Attitude Japanese House of Peers Should Take ,\" Konoe elaborated on how the House of Peers as the Upper House should function i n its relation with the Lower House . According to Konoe, if both houses alway s agreed with each other, the two-house sy stem was mean­ i ngless, but at the same time, if they disagreed constantly, it had no merit and became harmfu l . How should the Japanese House of Peers deal with this dilem ma? In a comparison with the two- house system of England, Konoe argued that the best way to deal with this problem was through the self-restriction of the House of Peers . The House of Peers was designed to be the opposition power set against the political party-oriented Lower House . Unlike that of England, it was constitutionally far freer from any restriction by any outside force than the Lower House . For example, the government had no right to dissolve the House of Peers. In that sense, it was possible for the House of Peers to abuse its constitutionally protected position . Unless the constitution was amended , there was no law to pre­ vent it. Consequently, self- restriction was t h e on l y way to have a n y con-\n\n1-Konoe's Backgrou11d and Upbringing\n\n21\n\nt rol of the House of Peers. Konoe believed it could be feasible and effective since the House of Peers was not party-oriented.24 In an\n\n192 1\n\nhe set up the Club of Constitutional Study with Mori Kaku,\n\ninfluential member of the Diet from the Seiyukai Party. The promo­\n\ntion of reform of the House of Peers was the main aim for the club. Then, in\n\n1922,\n\nKonoe joined Kenkyukai, which created a little controversy.\n\nKenkyukai, the most powerful faction of the Upper House, opposed Konoe's effort to reform the House of Peers. It made little sense, therefore, that Konoe, while pushing for the reform of the House of Peers, joined Kenkyukai. As Yabe Teiji points out, this was perhaps the result of polit­ ical maneuvering by then Prime Minister Hara Satoshi from Seiyukai and Mori Kaku to strengthen their party position by having Konoe as a mem­ ber of Kenkyukai.25 In January\n\n1924,\n\nsucceeding the second Yamamoto cabinet, Kiyoura\n\nKeigo formed his cabinet, which predominantly consisted of the members of the House of Peers, particularly from Kenkyukai. When it triggered the\n\nmovement of protection of the constitutional government, despite his membership in Kenkyukai, Konoe supported the movement pushed by the political parties Kenseikai, Seiyukai, and Kakushin Club, and contributed to the fall of the Kiyoura Keigo cabinet. The new cabinet was formed under the premiership of Kato Takaaki in June\n\n1924.\n\nIt was a coalition cabinet\n\n11f the above three parties.\n\nlu Novcmhcr 192H, Konoc hnnimaro in kimono giving a radio broadcast(«) Mainichi l'lwlo llank).\n\n22\n\nKonoe Fumimaro and the Failure o f Peace in Japan\n\nIn November 1927, Konoe ended his polem ical membership in Ken­ kyukai . Then, in the following month, he set up Kayokai (Tuesday Cl ub). It was a club only for the heirs of princes and marquises. The most mem­ orable i nvolvement of Kayokai in politics came in February 1928 when Home Minister Suzuki Kizaburo was forced to resign because of his ques­ tionable interference in the general election . Prime Minister Tanaka Giichi attempted to appoint his close personal friend, Hisahara Fusanosuke, as a successor. Strongly opposi ng Tanaka's action , M i n i ster of Education Mizuno Rentaro subm itted his resignation in protes t . Pretending that he accepted M izu no's resignation , Tanaka fabricated the Emperor's wish for having Mizuno continue to serve as Minister of Education to force Mizuno to take back his resignation . Although Mizuno did so, when Tanaka's action was criticized , he was obliged to turn i n his second resignation. It was the House of Peers that became a driving force for the accusation aga i n st Tanaka. Konoe led Kayokai to support the House of Peers. The Prime Min­ ister was forced to resign in July 1929, and his successor was Hamaguchi Osachi of the Minseito. One upshot of Konoe's strong involvement in the reform of the House of Peers was a selection of Konoe Fumimaro as the Vice Chairman of the House of Peers in 1929. Four years later, in June 1933, Konoe, succeeding Tokugawa Iesato, beca me the fifth Chairman of the House of Peers.26 Agai n he was \"destined\" to follow in his father's footsteps.\n\n2\n\nKonoe and Turbulence of the 1930s The Japanese economy already had been un stable si nce the end of the F i rst World War due to the overextension of capital i nvestment and pro­ duction and also the end of Japan's economic advantage as a supplier to meet the strong demand for war goods . Japan's economy deteriorated fur­ ther from the severe destruction caused by the great earthquake and the subsequent m ajor conflagration in September 1923. With no administra­ tion able to take any effective measure to cope with the problem , this econom ic difficulty was the continuous trend throughout the 1920s. Suc­ ceedi ng Tanaka Giichi as Prime Min ister in July 1929, Hamaguch i Osachi took a couple of radical measures to turn around this economic stagna­ tion . O ne was the policy to enhance economic efficiency, meani ng heavier work cond itions (fewer workers and lower wages for the same production ) and the concentration of capital to fewer hands. The other was lifting the embargo on gold and returning to the gold standard in order to buttress the value of the yen and halt inflation . Unfortunately, however, the stock market crash in the United States and the following worldwide economic depression did not give these measures a chance to be fully tested . What followed for Japan was unprecedented econom ic turmoil . The prices of goods steeply declined because of deflation , and international trade also dropped sharply wh ile the unemployment rate skyrocketed. Nat­ urally, in this situation , the industrial corporations and the agricultural i ndustry had an extremely difficult time in running their busi nesses . The l ives of the farmers and the industrial workers became almost unbearable. Along with the internal and external political turmoil, these economic hardsh ips fomented social and political discontent . The nation was losing its trust and confidence in the politicians who were not only unable to cope with the problems but were also frequently i nvolved in political cor­ ruption and rivalry. The parliamentary government and party politics came under attack . Growing m ilitarism and the rise of the right-wing 23\n\n24\n\nKonoe Fumimaro and\n\nthe\n\nFailure of Peace in Japan\n\nnationalism were a natural consequence of these trends. The arrest of Sociali sts and Com munists and t he counterattacks by the anarc hists became daily occurrences . 1 It was i n the m idst of these circumstances that the London Naval Arms Reduction Conference took place in January 1930. Despite the desire of the Japanese navy to obtai n a ratio of 10:10:7 for the United States, Great Britai n , and Japan, respectively, in cruisers and other warships, Wakatsuki Reij iro, the head of the Japanese delegation , accepted the ratio of 10: 10:6. Finding it unacceptable, the naval officers led by Adm iral Kato Kanj i launched an attack agai nst the Hamaguchi government . They were joined by the Seiyukai Party leaders such as I nukai Tsuyoshi and Hatoyama Ichiro. Their argument was that the supreme command was i ndependent, and, therefore, the government had no authority to make any decision with regard to national defense. Admiral Kato resigned after he appeal ed directly to the Emperor. Despite Kato's effort to oppose the government, Prime Minister Hamaguchi, with the support of Saionj i and the political party Mi nseito, succeeded in pushing through the ratification of the agreement. This brought dire polit­ ical consequences. Although the Seiyukai leaders' making use of the mili­ tary discontent for political goals may have had a short-term gai n , in the long run it weakened the position of party politics and brought grave con­ sequences for the future of the parliamentary government. Outraged by the ratification of the agreement, the right-wing militarists and the civil­ ian radicals began to target those who supported the agreement, thus trig­ gering series of political assassi nations and coups d'etat i n the 1930s. The first victim was Prime Minister Hamaguch i , who was shot and seriously injured by the right-wing radical Sakyoya Tameo at the Tokyo railroad station on November 14, 1 930. Hamaguchi survived the i n itial attack, but died a few months later. The assassin was sen tenced to death, but later his sentence was reduced, and he was eventually released i n 1940. He resumed his right-wing political activities. 2 Following this assassination was the so-called March I ncident . The plotters were the m i litary officers Koiso Kuniaki, Nagata Tetsuzan, and Hashimoto K i ngoro, and one of the top leaders of the civilian right-wing radicals, Okawa Shumei . Seei ng no hope i n the existing pol itical system , i n March 193 1 they attempted t o have \"national reform\" by establish i ng a new cabinet under the leadership o f the M i n ister o f the Army, Ugaki Kazushige, as Prime Minister. Despite the elaborate plan , this coup d'etat never took place, allegedly because at the very last m i nute Ugaki changed his mind, withdrawing his support for the coup attempt.-1 As these two i ncidents symbolize, the politically stormy era of the\n\n2-Konoe and Turbulence of the 1930s\n\n25\n\n1930s had already begun by early 193 1 . Strangely enough , however, around that t i me Konoe Fum imaro, who only a year after his graduation from college wrote the sensational article \" Rej ect the Anglo-American-Cen­ tered Peace\" and had been passionately involved in the Upper House reform movement a decade earlier, was showing little i nterest incurrent affairs. According to Konoe, this changed when he again encountered Mori Kaku in May 193 1 . It was a reunion after a decade, since they had estab­ lished together the Club of Constitutional Study in 192 1 . Konoe recalled what Mori said to him during their meeting : \"Time is changi ng drastically. Dealing with such issues as pa rty pol itics and the House of Peers is becom­ i ng trivial . We have to keep up with this change . Otherwise we face seri­ ous consequences . \" 4 Seei ng Mori Kaku as a politician with a strong belief in party politics, Konoe was surprised at this remark . Konoe even sensed a tone of fascism in it. After this meeting, Konoe began to see Mori regularly and, through h i m , he became closer to the right-wi ng nationalists . Konoe began to pay close attention to the swiftly moving current affairs such as the Manchurian prob l e m , the rise of mi litarism , and the i ncreasi ngly expand i ng social instability. It was like the second eye opening for h i m . Meanwhile, t h e turbulence of t h e 1930s continued. On September 18, 193 1 , the Manchurian I ncident took place. By this time , with a weakening economy and a rapidly growing population , much was at stake i n Manchuria for Japan. Things were not going well for Japan , however. There were strong and growing anti- Japanese elements in Manchuria. In add i­ tion , there had been threats from the head of the Kuom intang Party, Chi­ ang Kai-shek, who was determ ined to unify the whole of China. Chiang launched the so-called Northern Expedition to remove all the warlords in north China. He began to move his troops to the north in April 1928. Alarmed by this, the Kwantung Army officers wanted to replace Chang Tso-lin's army with their own troops and send them into key areas in Manchuria in order to have all of Manchuria under their control . Their plan , however, was opposed by Prime M i nister Tanaka. Then the Kwan­ t u ng Army assassi nated Chang Tso- l i n , hoping that his death would cause some local disturbances, thus giving them an excuse to move troops to the key areas in Manchuria. However, no major outbreaks took place . On the contrary, Chang H sueh-liang, son of Chang Tso-lin, came to power and p rom ised his loyalty to Chiang Kai-shek . These circumstances became alarming enough for the Kwantung officers to take a drastic action . On September 18, 193 1 , the small section of the Southern Manchurian Railroad in Mukden was blown up. The Kwantung Army promptly issued ,, (()m munique stat ing that it was the Chi nese troops that were responsi-\n\n26\n\nKonoe Fumima ro and the Failure of Peace in Japan\n\nble for that i ncident and the following attack on Japanese guards. What really took place was that a small group of the Kwantung Army was ordered to blow up the section of the railroad to create an excuse to bring down Chang Hsueh-liang from power. With only a vague idea of what really happened, the Wakatsugi cab­ inet adopted the policy of keeping the i ncident as a local matter and tried to settle it promptly. Contrary to their desire, the Kwantung Army rap­ idly moved their troops and put all of southern Manchuria under their con­ trol . Even the Korean troops led by Army General Hayashi Senj uro were sent to Manchuria. Hayash i did so without first obtai n i ng an imperial sanction , thus violat i ng the core pri nciple of the mil itary code. To make matters worse for the government , the Kwantung Army's action i n Manchuria was welcomed and enthusiastically supported by the public, and there was a growing criticism of the government effort led by Foreign M i nister Sh idehara Kijuro to achieve a conciliatory settlement of the Manchu rian issue .5 Having almost literally no support with regard to its Manchurian policy, the Wakatsugi cabi net fell in December 193 1 . l nukai Tsuyoshi replaced Wakatsugi .6 I n September 1932, the Lytton Com m ittee that conducted an i nves­ tigation of the Manchuria I ncident submitted a report to the League of Nations/ It recommended the cre­ ation of an autonomous regime under Chi nese sovereignty for prov i nce and a withdrawal of all Chinese and Japanese forces. This was unacceptabl e to the Japanese army. Then Japan withdrew its membership from the League of Nations i n 1933 when the League of Nations Security Council Assembly voted 42 to l against Japan . Not sur p r i s i n gly, Konoe did not share the assessment of the Lyt­ ton Com mittee over the Manchu­ rian I ncident. In the begi n n i ng of his article published in 1936 i n Tokyo, \"Improve the Present Situ­ ation of the World,\" Konoe states, \"Si nce the M a nchurian I ncident Portrait o f Konoe Fumimaro (© Mainichi Photo Bank) . took p l an· , J a p a n h a s hccn in a very\n\n2-Konoe and Turbulence of the 1930s\n\n27\n\ndifficult position i n ternationally. Japan's activ ities in Manchuria have al ready been questioned many times at the League of Nations. Japan is like a defendant to be judged i n the world court i n the name of world peace. Fac i ng this situation, i n order to get the consideration of Japan's position from the so-called Western Peace Advocates, I think we not only ought to explai n that Japan's action in Manchuria is i n dispensable for Japan's exis­ tence but also openly express to them our belief of how to achieve a true world peac e .\"8 This article clearly expresses Konoe's position , stating that the Manchurian Incident was justifiable and the result of the unfairly struc­ tured world political and econom ic systems. Therefore, it was not only inevitable and indispensable for Japan but also should be commended as a positive action for the sake of changing the current world structure to ach ieve true peace. Alth ough it may sound naive and l ike self-justification, Konoe truly believed that i n order to rectify the world's unfair structure, expelling Western imperialism from China and Asia as a whole was a first and essential step. Japan's i nvolvement in Manchuria, therefore, was not an act of aggression but a n ecessary step, and should be considered an action designed to benefit both China and Japan. This is the same argument Konoe made as a young college graduate in 1 9 1 8 in his article \" Reject the Anglo-American-Centered Peace.\" This sympathetic and supportive remark to the plotters of the Manchurian I nci­ dent helped Konoe strengthen his popularity and support not only from the right-wing radicals, but also from the public i n general .9 A month later, the Manchurian Incident was followed by another coup d'etat , the so called October I nciden t . It was caused by about 120 young m i l itary officers led by Hashimoto Ki ngoro, a l ieutenant and infl uential member of the extremely radical right-wi ng organization, the Cherry Blos­ som Club. 10 Realizing that contemporary party politics and a conciliatory foreign pol icy were not sufficient to settle the Manchurian issue, they plot­ ted the uprising in order to have national reforms by setti ng up a cabi net u nder Lieutenant Colonel Araki Sadao. Unlike the March I ncident, this t i me they tried to achieve their goal by themselves without relying on any support from the civilians. ' ' It was abortive, however, because the top lead­ l' rs of the m i litary became aware of the plot beforehand. Then, i n the following year, on May 15, 1932, the i ncident that altered I he nature of Japanese politics at a very critical juncture of modern Japa­ ll l'Se history took plac e . It had grave consequences for the course Japan would take in the next decade or so, up to the end of the Pacific war i n 1 94 5 .\n\nhy\n\nT h i s i ncident , known as t h e M a y Fifteenth I ncident, was carried out the naval officers and the army cadets led by a naval lieutenant, Koga\n\n28\n\nKonoe Fumimaro and the Failure of Peace in\n\nJapan\n\nKiyosh i , and a radical agrarian reformer, Tachibana Kosabro. It was designed to kill Prime M i nister I n ukai and the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Makino Nobuaki , who pledged to fulfill the Emperor's wish to sup­ press the Kwantung Army in order to achieve a prompt and peaceful solu­ tion to the Manchurian I ncident . I n addition t o the assassi nation of I nukai and Makino, the plotters planned to attack the Seiyukai headquarters, the M itsubishi Ban k , the police headquarters, and various electrical power plants. They failed i n all but one of their goals- the assassi nation of I nuka i . When the assassins broke into the Prime M i nister's official residence, I nukai attempted to talk to them, believing he would be able to dissuade the m . His attempt ended in vain . He was killed on the spot . What made the May Fifteenth I ncident so sign ificant is that , with this i ncident, the age of party politics came to an end. Until the i ncide n t , Japa­ nese politics had been characterized by party politics . Particularly, from June 1924 to May 1932, the presiden t of one of the two major parties had always led the Japanese governme n t . That ended with the assassi nation of I n ukai and did not resume until t he arrival of the post-World War II era. From May 1932 to August 1945, eleven men led the government. Four of them were admirals, four were generals, and only t h ree were civilian s . 1 2 Hence, the May Fifteenth I ncident was clearly a turning poi n t of pre­ war Japanese politics. It was a transition of power from pol i tical parties to the m i l itary. After the i ncide n t , the m i l i tary became i ncreasi ngly autonomous and assertive in policy making. Accord i ngly, the Kwantung Army i n Manchuria almost got a free hand to do whatever they desired to do. Shortly after the May Fifteenth I ncident , Konoe met Saionj i and gave h i m his thoughts about future political prospects . Konoe told Saionj i that to let the military coup d'etat destroy the party cabinet was sheer nonsense. Its establishment took ten years effort. So, mai ntaining parliamentary pol­ itics and party cab i net were absolutely essential . To do so, the Seiyukai party had to form a cabinet even if it might lead to a further confronta­ tion with the military. 1 3 If that was not possible, Konoe continued to say that lett i ng the military be in charge was the other choice to take and, even though risky, it m ight be the best. Konoe explained to Harada why it m ight be the better approac h . To Konoe, putting the m i litary i n position to gov­ ern would l ikely restrain them from any devious action and also l ikely lead them to stumble in their governing, causing them loss of their political muscle . So, to Konoe, despite risks, the above two o p t ions were worth­ while to take, and perhaps, the only choiccs . 1 '1 To Saionj i , however, neither o p t i o n w a s an l· p 1 .1 h l l' . Ta k i ng i n to con-\n\n2- Konoe and Turbulence of the 1930s\n\n29\n\nsideration the Emperor's wish to have the next Prime Minister be neither supportive of the radical nationalists nor abusive to the constitution , Saionji recom mended an adm i ral, Saito Makoto. Saionj i thought Saito, the for­ mer governor-general of Korea who was k nown to be moderate in his pol itical views, could be acceptable to both the military and the civilians . Then Konoe, with regard to Saionj i's recom mendation , wrote the followi ng :\n\nIn the end, Saionji prevailed. It was Saito Makoto who became Prime Minis­ ter, creating neither party nor military but a \"compromise\" cabinet. Saionji actually wanted to see a continuation of the party cabinet. He realized, how­ ever, the political party did not have any support but resentment from the military and had also became completely untrustworthy in the eyes of the nation. To Saionji, therefore, the creation of a party cabinet at this juncture was counter-effective, only causing the government further friction with the military. So was the creation of military cabinet. Saionji knew that the gov­ ernment take-over by the military would likely lead a new cabinet into extreme radicalism. So, to Saionji, the best choice the nation could make was a compromise cabinet. How did this compromise cabinet actually function? Under a compromise cabinet, although the military had a clear edge in terms of power, a political party was still able to have some control over excessive use of power by the military. There might be a situation in which the army's use of power was absolutely uncontrollable, and there was no way to suppress it but to let the army go their way. Under the compromise cabinet, even in this situation, a political party was not totally powerless. By letting the army have its way, the political party was still able to delay the outcome of the army's action from becoming effective. Consequently the political party was able to minimize the potential risks that might result from the army's action. According to Konoe, this was the essence of the compromise cabinet Saigon suggested. 15 Clearly the ideological difference between Konoe and Saionj i played role here in terms of what a cabi net should be like after the May Fif­ t eenth Incident . Saionj i argued that the military officers were being car­ r i ed away by their passi o n . As long as this was so, one had to avoid s t i mulating them and i nstead wait for them to cool down . Once they restored their calmness, diplomacy would be back on the right track and 1 h e cooperative nature of Shidehara Diplomacy would return . 1 6 As Saionji's rl' m a rk indicates, he did not see the necessity of having any fundamental , h a n g e both i nternally and externally. What was the best for Japan was to k l'ep the status quo. Sharply disagreeing with Saionj i , Konoe responded to Saionj i's \"do­ n o t h i n g approac h . \" He argued that the direction Japan was undertaking 1 h l' n w a s molded by the world situation . Regardless of whether or not the J J J i l i t a r y rose or the Manchurian I ncident took place, it was fate that Japan h . u l t o fac e . With re g a rd to waiting fi.u· the m i l itary to cool down , it would a\n\n30\n\nKonoe Fumimaro and the Fa ilure of Peace in Jap a n\n\nnever happen as long as pol iticians failed to recogn ize this fate o f the nation . The military would continue to be a driving force, and Japan would i ncreasi ngly speed up a move i n fateful direction . It was, however, very dangerous to let the m i litary lead the nation . I n order to retake politics from the hand of the mil itary, the politicians had to recognize this fate of the nation , take the lead ( not the other way aroun d ) , and e nact various reforms i n order to find a way out of this fateful situation . Without real­ izing this fate of the nation , if the politicians did nothi ng but try to oppress the m i l itary, they would never be able to take politics back i n t o their hands. 1 7 According t o Konoe, Saionj i was amused by his remarks and said , \"Agai n , Konoe's argument of taki ng a lead . \" 1 8 Whether or not this is amus­ ing, the ideological difference betwee n Konoe and Saionj i at this critical j uncture of Japanese politics was very significant in determi n i ng the fate of Japan. I n the end, Saionj i's approach preva iled, and the trend of com­ promise pol itics continued until the end of World War II. As the after­ math of the February Twenty-six I ncident i n 1936 proved , however, what Saionj i expected to see never took plac e . Instead of cooling down , the pas­ sion of the right-wing nationalists sharply escalated, causing them to stage continuous uprisings. The first of these was the Shinpeitai I ncident in July 193 3 , 1 9 fol lowed by the October Fasc ist I ncident i n August 1933,20 the November I ncident i n November 1934,2 1 and the assassi nation of Nagata Tetsuzan in August 1935,22 All but the assassi nat ion of Nagata ended i n failure . I n the midst of this political turmoil, Konoe went to the United States in May 1934Y By this time, there was a growi ng expectation for Konoe to form a cab i net. Facing serious issues such as Japan's i n ternational isola­ t ion and the i n c reasi ngly i nten sified right-wing actions at home, and despite being a moderate, Prime M i nister Saito was worn out from gov­ erning. He was eager to step down and let Konoe be his successor. Con­ sidering that it would be a better option for Konoe to go abroad to see Japan from outside, however, Saionj i persuaded Saito to remai n in office and rec­ om mended Konoe to take the trip. Publicly, i t was a trip to attend the h igh school graduation of his older son , Fumitaka. As Konoe wrote i n his memoirs, however, the main pur­ poses were to promote U.S. understanding of Japanese diplomacy after the Manchurian I ncident and to examine the U.S. view on the upcomi ng Naval Arms Reduction Conference . 24 It was a rather short but quite busy trip. Visiting the major cities of the United States, Konoe had meet ings w i t h v a r i o u s dignitaries such as President Franklin Roosevel t , for m e r l ' n· s i d l' n t l l nhc rt l l oov c r , Secretary\n\n2-Konoe and Turbulence of the 1930s\n\n31\n\no f State Cordell Hull, Wall Street tycoon Thomas W. Lamon t , Colonel Edward House, and many others. Through these meetings and the speeches he delivered, Konoe, wh ile l isten i ng to the U.S. views, made his best effort to convey the important task of the revolutionary changes taking place i n Japan and Japan's position on major issues such a s Manchuria o r the ratio of naval arms reduction . Konoe found some Americans with solid k nowledge about Japan who were supportive of Japan's position and role in the international arena. He realized, however, that in general the U.S. public's k nowledge of Japan was al most zero creati ng fundamental obstacles for promoting mutual under­ standing between the two nations. So there was a need for Japan to make an effort to remedy the situation . Accord i ng to Konoe, such an effort could be i n the form of setting up Japanese cultural centers i n major U.S. cities or creating student exchange programs. Konoe realized, however, the most immediate need for Japan was an improvement political propaganda. To Konoe, Chi na was doing far better than Japan when it came to political propaganda, leading the U.S. public's mood toward being more sympathetic to China than to Japan. For example, Konoe was quite disappointed to find out that Colonel Edward House, who he thought understood better than anyone else Japan's position as a have- not nation, was actually criti­ cal toward Japan. House told Konoe that the Japanese political situation was similar to that of prewar Germany, and so Japan was destined to share the fate of Germany. House's view, Konoe believed, was to a great extent the outcome of i neffective Japanese propaganda. Besides these rather unsatisfactory experiences, there was one unex­ pected outcome from Konoe's trip that m ight have been one of the causes of the future failure of his d iplomacy. As stated earlier, Konoe met with various dignitaries during his stay i n the United States, and among them was Thomas W. Lamont, one of the most i nfluen tial figures of Wall Street a n d k nown to be pro-Japanese. He made a great contribution in promot­ i n g U.S. i nvestment in Japan . After his return to Japan , Konoe wrote an article about his trip to the l l n ited States. In it, he made a remark about what Lamont had told h i m : .. When I saw Lamont i n New York, he said that President Roosevelt did 1 1ot know anything about diplomacy, and Hull was an economist who knew 1 1 o t h i ng about d iplomacy and had very l ittle k nowledge about the Far I .... 1St . \"25 When Konoe's article was translated and published in a U.S. journal , /Ire Da ily Worker, Lamont read Konoe's remarks and was infuriated by 1 hl' m . Lamont stated that Konoe's remarks were far from the truth and were , , pml' d i s t or t i o n of what he had told h i m . Whether it was the truth or a\n\n32\n\nKonoe Fumimaro and the Failu re of Peace i n Japan\n\ndistortion, what really i n furiated Lamont was Konoe's i n sensitivity and disregard for the potential trouble Lamont m ight have with Roosevelt or Hull because of these publicized remarks by Konoe. So i n furiated was Lamont that on September 24, 1934, he wrote a let­ ter to Joseph C. Grew, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan .25 In it, he says, \"I would like to draw your attention to the most mean-spirited treatment I have received from Prince Konoe. I have always met well-behaved Japa­ nese gentlemen . Seeing this man's behavior, I cannot help, however, but be convi nced that Konoe is the worst bounder. I hate seeing this type of man com ing to the United States and dealing with the improvement of the U.S.-Japanese relationship. \"26 Real izing the seriousness of this matter, Konoe wrote a l etter to Lam­ ont to express his regret . In the letter, Konoe defended himself by saying that it was the Japanese press that publicized his conversation with Lam­ ont without getting his consent . Sympathetic to Konoe, Grew also sent a letter to Lamont to speak for Konoe . Their effort, however, did little to m i n imize the damage done to Konoe's image . I n his article \"Nichibei Gaiko n i Okeru Fushi n no Tanjo\" ( \"Birth of Distrust i n U.S.-Japan Diplomacy \" ) , Professor Hosoya Chihiro of Hitot­ subashi University poi nts out that it is l ikely that the i mage the U. S. lead­ ers had of Konoe through the above episode , and the image Konoe had of the U.S. leaders through his trip to the United States, had a subtle i n fluence on the issue of the summit meeting in 1941 .27 Konoe returned to Japan in m id-summer of 1934. Japan was still i n the m idst of political turbulence . A year and a half after Konoe's return , the i ncident that put the whole nation i nto a state of shock took place on February 26, 1936. This so-called February Twenty-Six I ncident shared a s i m i lar backgrou nd with the preceding i n c idents, such as the anti­ capitalism and anti-democracy movements caused by economic and social problems particularly in the rural areas, the lack of trust of the govern­ ment brought on by corruption and the rivalry of party politics, discon­ tent toward the trend o f arms reduction , and repugnance toward pro-Western diplomacy, particularly Shidehara Diplomacy. This i ncident, however, significantly differs from the others i n one respect , factionalism in the army. I t is i ndeed thisfactionalism that became the immediate cause of the i ncident. Traditionally, the army, s i nce the establishment of Japan's modern military, had been domi nated by the officers from the Choshu clan until the death i n 1922 of Yamagata A ritomo, who was the founder of the Japa­ nese army and served as one of the most i nfluential Genros.28 After the death of Yamagata, the dom ination of the army by the Chosh u officers\n\n2-Konoe and Turbulence of the 1930s\n\n33\n\nbegan to diminish and thus created a chance for the non- Choshu officers to rise up. Yamagata was succeeded by Tanaka Giich i . Then, with Tanaka's dem ise, there was no appropriate leader to succeed h i m , thereby further weakening the Choshu officers' domi nation . By this time, the army was clearly divided i nto two factions: the Choshu faction and the non-Choshu faction . The leading officers of the Choshu faction , such as Nagata Tetsuzan , Tojo H ideki , and Yamashita Tomoyuki, were mostly com i ng from well­ off fam i lies and were the graduates of the Military Academy. Exposed to modern thinking in terms of how the army should be i n order to deal with future wars, they placed a great emphasis on two thi ngs : ( I ) Moderniza­ tion of the army by equippi ng it with modern machi nery such as tanks and airplanes and placing less reliance on human resources ( meaning the reduction of the size of the army ) , and ( 2 ) A comprehensive approach ( total mobilization ) to military affairs by coordinating the military, poli­ tics, and economy. Because of these approaches, they were called the Tosei­ ha ( the Control faction ) . The non-Choshu officers, led b y Mazaki Jinsabro and Araki Sadao, often called the Kodo-ha ( the I mperial Way faction ) , strongly believed that what was esse ntial for Japan to win future wars was not machi nery but \"spirit of Yamato. \"29 Already resentful about the long domi nation of the army by the Choshu officers, they were further infuriated by the approach t aken by the Tosei faction . The assassi nation of Nagata Tetsuzan was one result of such infuriation . I n the m idst of this army factionalism i n the mid- I930s, one aca­ demic theory, first m ade public al most three decades ago and making a great contribution to the p romotion of parl iamentary government a n d pa rty politics, became t h e focus of controversy. It further intensi fied the m i l itary factional ism by strengthe n i ng the movement of the right-wing rad icals . This so-called Organ Theory came from a prom i nent constitu­ t i onal law scholar, M i nobe Ta tsukic h i . Accord i ng to his theory, the 1-:!nperor was an organ of the state . H e was not above the state but con­ t a i ned withi n it. Making an argument for the Emperor as a national polity by the right­ w i ng nationalists groundless, Mi nobe's Organ Theory caused a strong reac­ t i onary attack on M inobe by not only the radical militarists but also the u a t ionalist scholars and pol iticians. The i n itial attack came from a mem­ ber o f the House of Peers and a director of Kokuhonsha, Kikuchi Takeo, iu February 1935. He denounced Minobe as a traitor, a rebel, and an aca­ dl' m ic bandit. Then Hiranuma Kiichiro and the members of Seiyukai, see­ l ug a po l i t ica l opportunity to overth row the Okada cabinet, joined the\n\n34\n\nKo n o e Fumimaro\n\nand the Failure of Peace in Japan\n\nattack. Th is intensified attack against the Organ Theory eventually obliged Mi nobe to resign his seat in the House of Peers and give up his teach ing position at Tokyo I mperial Un iversity. His books were banned, and he was almost killed by a fanatical right-wing national ist. As this reactionary movement against the O rgan Theory indicates, i n the m id- 1930s, a n ultranationalistic ideology became increasingly dom i­ nant . The ideological control was intensified, and liberalism and democ­ racy were almost completely eradicated . Two years later, i n March 1937, under pressure from the army and ultranationalists, the government issued Ca rdinal Principles of the Na tional Entity of Japa n (Kokuta i no Hon gi) .\n\nThus, infuriated and threatened by the long dom i nation of the army by the Tosei-ha and its policy orientation, the Kodo-ha saw an opportunity for them to take action to turn the situation around and have their cause prevail . On the snowy morning of February 26, 1936, by mobilizing more than 14,000 men of the infantry regi ments of the First Division and the I mpe­ rial Guards Division , the rebels attacked and occupied the key govern­ ment buildings, killing a number of senior statesmen . Their mission was to establ ish a military government under General Mazaki as Prime Min­ ister by eradicating the destructive elements to the nation such as Genro, elder statesmen, financial and mil itary cl iques, bureaucrats, and political parties. Some of the major targets were Prime M i nister Okada Keisuke, former Prime M i n ister Saito Makoto, M i n ister of F i nance Takahashi Korekiyo, General Watanabe ]otaro, who had replaced Mazaki as an inspec­ tor general of military education , the Grand Chamberlai n Suzuki Kan­ taro, and former Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Makino Nobuaki .30 Saionj i Kinmochi was also on the list. H i s name was taken off, however, at the last mi nute because of the disagreement among the rebels about whether or not Saionj i should be spared . Saito, Takahash i , and Watanabe were killed. It was in itially believed that Prime M i n ister Okada was also killed , but in fact Okada's brother­ in-law had been mistaken for Okada and killed by the assassins. The rebels occupied the M i nistry of the Army, the Diet, and the Prime Min ister's res­ idence and demanded national reform s . What resulted was not acceptance of their demands, however. With­ out havi ng any clear idea about what would follow after the rebellion, the rebels put their hopes i n their expectation that the army leaders and, most importantly, the Emperor would support their cause . Their expected out­ come did not come to fru ition . Ini tially, War M i n ister Kawashima showed his sympathy toward the rebels. Also, General Araki and General Mazaki n a t ura l l y d id not wa nt the\n\n2-Konoe and Turbulence of the 1930s\n\n35\n\ngovernment to take any m ilitary action to suppress the rebellion. They urged Kawashima to persuade the Emperor to accept the demands of the rebels. All this changed , however, when the Emperor showed his determi ­ nation to subdue the rebels. Even General Mazaki became hesitant t o fully support the rebels, so the rebellion was doomed . All together n ineteen men were sentenced to death, i ncluding Cap­ tain Isobe, officer Muranaka Koj i , an i nfluential intellectual and nation­ alist, Kita Ikki, and his follower, Nish ida M itsugu . J I General Mazaki was arrested as a supreme leader of the rebell ion but was later released because of i nsufficient evidence. The fa il ure of the Kodo-ha i n their quest for Showa Restoration had two significant outcomes. One was the decisive loss of power of the Kodo­ ha, ending factionalism in the m i litary. The other was the restoration of the practice of choosi ng the M i nister of the Army from among the active army generals. With regard to the latter, as Konoe points out i n his postwar writing, Ush inawa reshi Seiji ( The Lost Politics ) , with the re-enforcement of this practice, the m i l itary greatly enhanced its political power, putti ng the cab­ i net almost completely under military control .32 Perhaps Konoe , more than anyone else, k new how difficult it was to run the government under this situation . As will be discussed later, during his reign , Konoe was unbear­ ably frustrated about hav i ng no control of his own cabi net to carry out his policies, often at the most critical momen ts. Concerning the fiasco of the Kodo-ha, Konoe made an insightful argu­ ment .33 He stated that the Kodo-ha policy orientation was rooted in an observation of the Russian Revolution by two Japanese militarists, Gen­ eral Araki and Lieutenant General Kobata, who happened to be in Russia as military attaches during the revolution . They were strongly concerned with the fate of Russia, particularly the rise of Commun ism . Their obser­ vation eventually developed i nto the policy guideline for the Kodo-ha in t he 1930s. I nternally, their aim was to maintain and protect national polity by restoring Japan to a society based on Japanese tradition s and spirit . In order to ach ieve that a i m , it became essential to prevent a Com mun ist i n trusion into Japan . Rather naturally, therefore, the Kodo- ha focused on t he policy of mov i ng northward, dealing with the Soviet Union . To them , it was out of the question to become militarily involved i n China and sup­ port the policy of mov i ng southward . Con sequently, they opposed the M a nchurian I ncident and the China I ncident, and also they strongly opposed the advancement of Japanese troops into French I ndo-China and the con frontational approach toward the United States.\n\n36\n\nKonoe Fumimaro and the Failu re of Peace in Japan\n\nHence, with regard to policy making, internally and externally, there was a strong disagreement between the Kodo-ha and the Tosei- ha. Konoe argued that the February Twenty-six I ncident ended this r ivalry, opening up a way for the Tosei-ha to satisfy the desire of moving southward . Konoe saw, therefore, the beginning of Japan's tragic end in the fiasco of the Kodo­ ha.34 He argued that, prior to the February Twenty-six I ncident, Japanese politics and society in general were inundated with \"Japanism . \" It was the general perception that it was the Kodo-ha, led by Generals Araki and Mazaki, who placed the m ilitary and the entire nation on the wrong path . So, b y clearing away the Kodo- ha after the February Twenty-six I ncident, the Tosei-ha was applauded by the nation as well as the foreign powers . To Konoe, this applause made little sense , however. As already mentioned above, what really took place was that , through the February Twenty-six I ncident and the triumph of the Tosei - ha over the Kodo-ha, the army greatly enhanced its political power and gai ned almost a free hand i n lead­ i ng the nation in any way they wished, thus bringing Japan to its fatal des­ ti ny. An implication Konoe was seemingly mak i ng from the above argu­ ment is i mportant . It would have been possible to avoid the war i n the Pacific . As we generally understand today, it was not right-wing national­ ist thought that directly caused the military confrontation between Japan and the United States, but the power struggle among the i mperial nations over the econom ic and political interests in China and the southern Pacific . So, it ispossible to make a convincing argument that if somehow the Kodo­ ha had been able to mai ntain their stronghold in the military and to check the Tosei- ha's southward movement, Japan would have taken a different path , altering h istory drastically. A fter the February Twenty-six Incident, the Okada cabinet came to an e n d , and Okada was succeeded by Hirota Koki . Before Hirota was chosen, however, Saionj i actually recom mended the appointment of Konoe to be Prime Minister. On March 4, 1936, Saionji met with Konoe. During the meeting, which lasted nearly two hours, Saionji gave the reason why Konoe ought to be the next Prime Minister. He stated that Konoe was the most suit­ able candidate because of his popularity in almost every segment of soci­ ety, whether it was the m ilitary, the political parties, or the House of Peers.35 At first, Saionj i had been rather reluctant to recom mend Konoe. He knew the enorm ity of the hardsh ip Konoe would face . Saionj i wanted Konoe to be i n charge when the time was cal m , not at this most unstable and unpredictable moment . Saionj i came to the realization, however, as many people did, that Konoe was perhaps the only political figure who might be able to put Japan on the right track.\n\n2-Konoe and Turbulence of the 1930s\n\n37\n\nI n Dece m b e r 1 936, Konoe t:u m i m a ro on t h e p l a t fo r m of t h e N a t i o n a l D i e t ( �) M a i n ic h i Photo B a n k ) .\n\nContrary to Saionj i's wish, Konoe turned down the recom mendation, daiming poor heal th . Konoe also responded to Saionj i's argu men t of why he should be recom mended .36 Konoe argued that a person who enjoyed popularity from all sides would be restricted in his governi ng because those who supported him would naturally expect to be pleased, and if not, would I urn antagonistic . 37 Sa ionj i, however, did not accept Konoe's reasoning i n turning down h i s recom mendation , and was determined to make Konoe form his cab i­ net . He told Konoe that , at the current juncture, a matter of being healthy o r not was secondary. He also said that he had authority and was deter­ m i ned to recom mend anyone he h oped to be Prime M i n ister to the Lmperor. Saionji urged Konoe to free himself from any trivial matters and .tccept his recommendation .38 Despite Saionj i's strong recom mendationto the Emperor and the L m peror's personal request for Konoe's acceptance, Konoe was as solid as \" rock and showed no sign of wavering. His poor health and also his aware­ n e s s of the unsuitabi lity of h i s personality for the job were surely reasons f o r Konoe's stubbornness. As Konoe said in his writing, however, the essen1 1 .11 reason for his rejection was h i s realization that he would not be effective 1 11 h i s governing because of the great gap existi ng between him and Saionj i 1 11 t h e i r views, particularly in terms of the military after the debacle of the \"' H l o - ha .-'9\n\n38\n\nKonoe Fum imaro and the Failure of Peace i n Japan\n\nSaionji then selected Foreign M i n ister Hirota Koki . Faci ng two immi­ nent tasks, the formulation of a clearly defined national policy and the set­ tlement of the North China problem , H irota's cabi net came up with the policy called \"The Fundamental Principles of the National Policy. \" It specified Japan's goals in Asia, including the establishment of security i n Japan's leadership status i n East Asia and Japan's advancement i n to the South Ch i na Sea. It prov ided a basic guideline of how to achieve these goals as characterized by such policies as the expansion of the m ilitary, administrative reform , a new econom ic plan , and the reorganization of the Japanese way of life . As Mikiso Hane points out in his book, Modern Japan: A Historical Su rvey, this pol icy became a blueprint for the Japanese Empire in terms of Japan's policy orientation , pursued by H irota's successors, and it eventually led Japan i nto the war in the Pacific .40 Though sign ificant because of the specification of Japan's direction , H irota's cabinet suffered from the very begi nning of his premiership. In for m i ng his cabinet, H i rota selected a few party pol itician s : Kawasaki Takukich i , Yoshida Shigeru, and Shimomura Hirosh i . Then , led by Gen­ eral Terauchi Yoshikazu, the army bluntly i nterfered with this selection by arguing that those selected were too liberal . Faci ng such blunt political interference by the military, Hamada Kuni­ matsu, a member of the Seiyukai, retal iated . In January 1937, at the Sev­ entieth Parl iamentary Session , Hamada bitterly criticized the m i l itary, saying that the polit ical ideology of the m i litary was orien ted toward a dictatorship. I n furiated by Hamada's speech, General Terauchi accused Hamada of insulting the military. Hamada responded by saying, \"General Terauchi claims that, in my speech, there are some remarks that are insult­ ing to the military. As a representative of the nation, I can not keep myself quiet over the charge that I have i nsulted the nationally honored m i litary. General Terauchi, I would like you to point out which of my remarks actu­ ally insulted the military. I f there is i ndeed such a remark, I would l ike to apologize by com mitting 'hara-kiri. ' I f not , however, I would l ike you to do the same . \" 4 1 Th is so-called Hara-kiri Man to (dialogue) brought the fall of the Hirota cabi net . Enraged, Terauchi urged Hirota to step down . When Hirota refused, Terauchi resigned , causing the resignation of Hirota's entire cabinet . Saionj i recom mended General Ugaki Kazush ige as H irota's successor. Ugaki's cabinet was never organized, however. The army found Ugaki unacceptable for the followi ng reasons : first, he was engaged in arms reduc­ tion as War M i nister under Kato Takaaki; second, he equivocated in the March Incident of 193 1; and third , he was considered too close to party politicians. 42 Facing the arm y's refusal to prov ide any ge neral as a possi-\n\n2-Konoe and Turbulence of the 1930s\n\n39\n\nble candidate, Ugaki wa s unable to appoint anyone as M i n ister of the Army. He was a clear v ictim of the revived practice that an appoi ntee for Army M i nister had to be made from among active army generals . As a last resort , Ugaki asked the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal , Yuasa Kurahei, to issue an Imperial Order compelling the army to provide an army general .43 F i nding Yuasa unfavorable to his proposals, Ugaki felt it useless to pur­ sue it fu rther. Already apprehensive about the fall of Hirota, Konoe was outraged by Ugaki's failure to form his cabi net because of the army's i nterference . Unable to remain indifferent , he wrote a letter of reproach to General Ter­ auch i . In his letter, Konoe argued that while it made sense to debate a pol­ icy i n terms of \"right and wrong,\" rejecti ng a person who had been given an I m perial O rder to be Prime Minister made no sense and raised a seri­ ous concern with regard to j ustice . Konoe emphasized that it was neither his being for or against formation of Ugaki cabi net nor correctness of a choice of Ugaki that made him speak up but his desire to preserve j ustice and respect the national polity. Clearly, to Konoe, noth ing was more impor­ tant than national j ustice and he was deeply worried that Ugaki's debacle would cause great d isorder. When some associates of Konoe, afraid that t he letter might result in something fatal to him, attempted to restrai n him, Konoe told them that he had no regret to die for right cause .41 After Ugaki's fiasco, Army General Hayashi Senj uro, who was favor­ able to the army, was selected to be the successor to the Hirota cabi net . When Hayash i carried out the surprised dissolution of the Diet without any specific reason , however, the opposition parties, Seiyukai and Min­ seito, ga i n ed a majority and launched a movement to overth row the l layashi cabi net . Losing support even from the army, in May 1937 Hayashi resigned after serv ing for only four months. Hayash i wanted Konoe to be his successor. On May 29, Hayashi sounded out Konoe regarding his i nterest i n the job. Just l ike his refusal i n the aftermath of the February Twenty-six I ncident, Konoe told Hayash i t hat because of his poor health and inexperience, he should not be the one to be selected .45 Then, Hayashi chose Army M i n ister Sugiyama under the nmsideration that a choice of any civilian would be taken as concession h y the military to the political party and, therefore, would have negative rl'percussions for the m ilitary situation , particularly in Chi na.46 Agreeing with Hayashi , Konoe and the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Yuasa, supported the choice of Sugiyama Gen. Despite their support, the Sugiyama cabi net was never formed because of the strong opposition from .S a ionj i against selecti ng an active Army M i nister as Prime M i nister. T h e n Saionj i , se ei n g no other appropriate candidate, once again rec-\n\n40\n\nKonoe Fumimaro and the Failure of Peace in Japan\n\nommended Konoe. He told his personal secretary, Harada Kumao, \"It is absolutely bad to select the active Army Minister as Prime Min ister. I n this situation, I think, Konoe should be the one . I have always hesitated to choose Konoe and i n fact wanted to avoid selecting him. I f l am consulted, however, I cannot agree to choose someone i n whom I have no faith . A choice has to be made in a reasonable manner. Although, considering the situation, it is quite pitifu l that there is no other appropriate person but Konoe after all .\"47 Under Saionj i's recommendation , the I mperial O rder came to Konoe once again. Even to Konoe, it was out of the question to turn it down this time . I n June 1937, rather reluctantly, Konoe accepted the Imperial Order. Thus, at the age of forty-six he embarked on his quest for the salvation of a deeply divided and troubled nation .\n\n3\n\nKonoe's Fir st Cabinet When Konoe accepted the Imperial Order to become Prime M i nis­ ter, he was at the prime of h is life . He enjoyed popularity and support from l iterally every segment of society. Tired and apprehensive about the endless political turmoil and the uncertainty of the direction in which Japan was heading, the nation was anxious to have a new leader, someone different and fresh who m ight be able to pull the nation together. In the eyes of the nation, Konoe was ideally fitted to fulfill such a national need. H i s status as one of the most distingu ished court nobles, his wel"
