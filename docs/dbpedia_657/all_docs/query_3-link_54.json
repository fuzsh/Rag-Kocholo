        "text": "Martial arts have since their beginnings always been understood as an holistic formation of the human body and mind. Although it may be an “invented tradition”, Karate-dô can claim to be deeply connected with Zen-Buddhism. In this paper I will describe and classify those forms of meditation that can be extracted from the teachings of the Buddha Sakyamuni. The practice of “mindfulness” as it was developped in the USA is an amalgam of diverse types of buddhist mental training. It is nowadays widely applied in clinical and therapeutic contexts. Mindfulness training is presently introduced into Karate-dô, namely by Yukawa Shintarô, a Karate and Taijiquan practitioner and clinical psychologist. This paper is an assessment of this effort and tries to contribute to the concept, that the effective use of meditative elements in Karate training can decisively improve body awareness, technical skill and overall health.\n\nEngaging in martial combat, whether for military, self-defence or cultivation purposes, is taken to sensitise practitioners towards existential issues which in turn enliven potential religio-spiritual experiences and awakenings. In this paper, we draw on Girard’s (1977) Violence and the Sacred, and in particular his proposition that, “religion shelters us from violence just as violence seeks shelter in religion” (Girard, [1977] 2005: 25) to examine sacralisation processes in the traditional martial arts with a particular focus on highlighting how violence, sacralised through sacred imagery, is used as a structuring force to instill dispositions that counter ubiquitous human tendencies towards unfettered violence and violent vengeance. We highlight the phenomenon and function of sacred imagery used in martial arts with very different cultural, ethnic, and spiritual influences, specifically: Japanese Karate, Korean Taekwondo, Brazilian Capoeira and Mexican Xilam. For authenticity, each section is written by an experienced scholar-practitioner of the art and combines literary, empirical, and biographical reflection. Despite these variations, we identify two modalities of sacred imagery use. The first is representational imagery used as sacred signifiers which embed the art in a tradition of sacred attachment. The second form of sacred imagery is metaphorical discourse which is designed to invoke creative visualisations aligning practitioners with idealised experiential states taken to have sacred (as well as practical) value in relation to combat. We conclude that the use of sacred imagery in these ways becomes part of an affective body pedagogy used by the traditionalist martial arts to transfer valued knowledge through the corporeal medium to offset and sacralise violent tendencies. It is qualified that in practice, this sacralisation process involves complex entanglements of the cultural origins, practitioner interpretation and the contemporary context of the martial art in question. The outcome is an evolving sacralisation process which rests in constant tension with the underlying problems initiated by the ubiquitous body-in-conflict problem and the propensity for violence and violent vengeance that the learning of combative skills might otherwise unleash in the body and onto society.\n\nThis paper aims to understand the science of meditation practice that hidden in Shaolin Kung Fu. The Theravāda insight meditation method named \"Body posture practice\" (iriyāpatha Satipaṭṭhāna) is closely related to what's in the Kung Fu implemented by Shaolin monastery. The history of Shaolin Temple spans for fifteen hundred years from the Buddhabhadra, the first abbot to the present. The unique identity is the Shaolin Kung Fu, the martial arts with bare hands originated from the application of the natural environment to the unique style of Prānic fighting obtained from practicing of insight meditation. The science of meditation practice that has been imprinted into the DNA of this legendary temple is still standing to be proved in all ages.\n\n* Video presentation available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaZ1bM_LGvc&t=13s Martial arts styles and groups have many parallels with religions or religious denominations. This paper focuses specifically on one such area; animosity and mistrust between groups and styles. It uses the concept of ressentiment as a critical tool to explore this issue, derived from analysis of the arguments presented by Friedrich Nietzsche, Max Scheler and Stefano Tomelleri, and their applicability to the martial arts. Finally, it draws out potential implications and ways forward for the martial arts, using Tomelleri’s related concept of fraternity. It is hoped that this analysis will inform and support the central project of the MASRN, namely to remove barriers, and enable genial and respectful, yet challenging and vigorous interdisciplinary knowledge sharing and discussions across styles.\n\nMartial arts are understood to promote violence at best, and syncretism for Christians at worst. However, my 30 years of martial arts experience have shown that two major components in martial arts training are flow, and cooperation. Flow is the mental state in which a person is fully immersed in a feeling of energised focus while performing an activity. In martial arts practice, this can be achieved in the dialectic of both competing and cooperating with a training partner. This paper examines how this practice of 'flowing with the go' can be understood as a form of spiritual practice by studying the combat sport of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu."
