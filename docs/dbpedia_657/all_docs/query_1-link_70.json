        "text": "In the process of teaching, it can be noticed that instructors can use different ways of information delivery methods to achieve the educational goals that they want to achieve. Various paths can be followed by the instructors when they want to present the information to their students. Whether the method of information delivery is a traditional one, an electronic one, or an approach that blends both of the traditional and the electronic type, the final outcome is the development of the knowledge inside the learners. However, the different ways of information delivery bring with them various advantages and disadvantages. This study is an attempt to give brief information about the blended approach of learning. This study is important since it tries to give brief information for the Iraqi EFL college instructors about this approach. It was not possible to conduct the research empirically because it was done in 2020 when blended learning was applied in Iraqi universities for the first...\n\nTeachers are all the time looking for different ways of increasing the quality of their teaching. At present the use of computers and new technologies has become an important aspect of foreign language learning. They have enabled the language teaching community to redefi ne some of the strategies and concepts of teaching and learning. In this climate computer-based distance learning courses have emerged. One of the supports of the distance learning is e-learning, which is widely used at the University of Hradec Kralove. Sometimes e-learning is also exploited in the so-called blended learning. The talk will concentrate on the perception of the term blended learning, its possible model and contribution. In conclusion one of the representative blended courses will be introduced.\n\nThe purpose of the applied research presented herein is to devise and promote language teaching paradigms that are intended to develop bilingual abilities in second-generation Latin Americans (aged 11-12 years) in the Italian middle school, thereby recovering their original linguistic background, while amplifying their knowledge of Italian, thus redefining a carefully balanced, pluralistic linguistic framework. Moreover, the study aims to establish a bilingual teaching model that may also be applied to different language pairings. The LI.LO (acronym for Italian Language/Native Language) programme was designed and delivered in blended learning on Sybra/CLiRe (Centro Linguistico in Rete) platform of the University of Genoa and it focuses on the development of bilingual skills with respect to academic language, cognitive abilities, and computer competence. It promotes language proficiency and the complete integration of non-Italian, second-generation Latin American students. The first ..."
