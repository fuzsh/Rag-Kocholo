        "text": "Mitsunari Kanai (1938-2004), was an aikido teacher born in Japan, who spent most of his teaching career in the United States. He was an 8th dan teacher with the title shihan in the organisation Aikikai.\n\nLife\n\nKanai was one of the last group of students of the founder of aikido, Morihei Ueshiba, entering the Hombu Dojo in 1958 as an uchi-deshi. He moved to the United States in 1966 as a 4th dan and subsequently founded the New England Aikikai, currently located off Porter Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Kanai was instrumental in the early development of aikido in the United States and Canada, and taught seminars widely throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. He was one of the founders and a Technical Director of both the United States Aikido Federation (USAF) and the CAF.\n\nKanai was also skilled in iaido and subsequently taught this art to his senior students, many of whom hold dan rank in both iaido and aikido. He was also highly respected for his metalworking skills and deep historical knowledge of the Japanese sword, the katana, serving at times as a specialist advisor to the East Asian Collection at the nearby Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\n\nSome of his senior students continue to operate New England Aikikai, while others have dispersed, starting new dojos throughout New England, notably Framingham Aikikai and Portland (Maine) Aikido, and as far away as Portland, Oregon. His students also run the aikido clubs at nearby Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Tufts University.\n\nSee also\n\nAikikai\n\nAikikai Hombu Dojo\n\nOther USAF Shihan:\n\nAkira Tohei\n\nYoshimitsu Yamada\n\nKazuo Chiba\n\nSeiichi Sugano\n\nFramingham Aikikai\n\nAikido de la Montagne\n\nHarvard Aikikai\n\nThe MIT Aikido Club\n\nNew England Aikikai\n\nToronto Aikikai\n\nTwo Rivers Aikikai\n\nWoburn Aikikai"
