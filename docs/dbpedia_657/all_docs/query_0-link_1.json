When you enter the building, proceed to the end of the hallway and turn left. The classrooms are through the second and third doors on the right after the left turn. The building may not be open until approximately ten minutes before the scheduled class times shown below.\n\nPlease note: Club activities at the synagogue are limited to the hours shown below. Synagogue personnel have only limited information about our program. If you are interested, please contact the club directly (there is an e-mail link at the bottom of the page) or visit us during a scheduled class.\n\nBecause of synagogue security concerns it is no longer possible to leave the building unlocked during our classes; if you wish to visit a class, use the button to the left of the door to request entrance."
