        "text": "Plenary Session in the 23rd International Congress of Byzantine Studies: Byzantium – A World of Changes. The Association Internationale des Études Byzantines (AIEB) will hold its next congress, the 23rd International Congress of Byzantine Studies, in Belgrade from the 22nd to 27th of August, 2016. The members of the Serbian National Committee for Byzantine Studies, as well as all Byzantinists and medievalists of Serbia, are proud that the Belgrade school for Byzantine studies is to be entrusted again with the organization of this congress. We warmly welcome Byzantine scholars from around the world to participate and contribute to this important exchange of ideas and thereby establish the present state of research in Byzantine studies. The upcoming congress will focus on deepening the understanding of Byzantium (the Byzantine Empire) as a living organism that lasted for more than a millenium and in which ideology, erudition, art and culture essentially contributed to the deveolpment of Europe from the Late Antique and Medieval period up to the present day. The congress will also offer young researchers the opportunity to share their ideas and projects for future research on Byzantium. Bearing all this in mind, the Réunion-Intercongrès held in Athens in September 2013 accepted the name and motto of the Congress suggested by the organizers. Both elements emphasize the above-mentioned need for understanding Byzantium as a complex organism that calls for innovative approaches to the future research. The president of the Republic of Serbia, Tomislav Nikolić, will act as patron for the International Congress due to its importance for scientific research in Serbia and for the cultural identity of the country, for which the organizing body would like to expresses its deep gratitude. In addition, because of the scientific and cultural prominence of the International Congress, the organizers have taken further steps to secure international patronage.

The Mediterranean world does not present climatic variations, having, therefore, a Mediterranean climate, and as a consequence, a Mediterranean Architecture. Outside the orthodoxy of the Modern Movement architects such as José Antonio Coderch, Alejandro de la Sota and Aris Konstantidinis, proposed architecture committed to its time, at the same time committed to the Mediterranean place where they happen to produce architecture. An attitude that comes from the construction site and an updated reinterpretation of the vernacular as a source of inspiration and a set spatial and formal easements and Academicians fully released worldwide. With three examples of Mediterranean Houses-houses —in front of the sea—, where the constructive realism became a certain brutalism, sets out an investigation to determine the genealogy of its architecture. These three houses, located in a same sea, but in opposed poles, have been solved with very similar operations. Their approach to the popular culture, trying to embrace the origins of a very rich Mediterranean vernacular architecture, will be the pillars from where they are able to create a modern language which it is distant/isolated from an intention and a speech typically avant-garde.\n\nThe use of the new generation of remote sensors, such as echo sounders and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers with differential correction installed in a drone, allows the acquisition of high-precision data in areas of shallow water, as in the case of the channel of the Encañizadas in the Mar Menor lagoon. This high precision information is the first step to develop the methodology to monitor the bathymetry of the Mar Menor channels. The use of high spatial resolution satellite images is the solution for monitoring many hydrological changes and it is the basis of the three-dimensional (3D) numerical models used to study transport over time, environmental variability, and water ecosystem complexity.\n\nThe Huerta is recognised as one of the 13 specific agricultural landscapes in Europe, present in only three Mediterranean countries, namely Spain, Italy, and Greece. In the case of Spain, three areas fall within the established Huerta agricultural classification: the Huertas de Valencia, Murcia, and Vega Baja. While all of them share common landscape features, each Huerta has distinguishing singularities which are approached through two perspectives: firstly, the structural tangible elements, related to functional networks—water distribution, pathways networks, settlement patterns, and the agricultural production system; and secondly, the role of the intangible components—connotations of the word Huerta, water management, canal and path upkeep rules, and the administration of these territories. The analysis of the tangible elements and intangible components in the three Spanish Huertas shows these territories as complex and balanced systems that have historically counterbalanced the..."
