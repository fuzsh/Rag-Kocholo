        "text": "Journal of Combative Sport, May 2003\n\nWith heartily reciprocated good wishes: Letters from E.J. Harrison to Robert W. Smith, 1950-1960\n\nEdited and annotated by Joseph R. Svinth. Reprinted by permission of Robert W. Smith. Copyright EJMAS © 2003. All rights reserved. NOTE: Permission to reprint elsewhere on the Internet is denied without express written permission, but you are encouraged to link to this page. Meanwhile, if you decide to print a copy for personal reference, note that the document is about 37,000 words in length. So bring a lot of paper!\n\n(May 28, 1950)\n\nI am greatly obliged to you for your kindness in sending me the extract from L. Adam Becks \"The Garden of Vision\" [Ed.: Beck, Lily Adams, pseudonym; i.e., Eliza Louisa Moresby Beck. Published by Ernest Benn: London, 1933].\n\nSingularly enough, a very careful reading of the extract has been sufficient to satisfy me that the author of the work, whoever he may be, has ingeniously made use of material borrowed apparently without acknowledgement from my own book, The Fighting Spirit of Japan [Fisher Unwin, 1913]. Thus the gist of Arimas colourful discourse on the kiai and aiki is really a clever réchauffé of my chapters on \"The Esoteric Aspects of Bujutsu,\" particularly Chapter IX in which I give the substance of a remarkable lecture delivered for my special benefit by the famous veteran Nobuyuki Kunishige of the Shinden Isshin-ryu. The most conclusive proof of the true inspiration of Arimas discourse appears on the last page of the extract, in which he is quoted as saying, \"I may do well to give the rules which are considered to hold the secret of kiai!\" Then follow these so-called rules which have obviously been lifted almost word for word from page 167 of my book, where I describe them as \"verses\" which explain the secret of kiai!\n\nIt is utterly impossible to entertain the suggestion that this resemblance is merely an amazing coincidence. My book was admittedly the first non-Japanese publication to disclose the underlying esoteric aspects of Japanese martial arts (bujutsu). Before then the West knew nothing of the kiai, aiki, or the power of the saika-tanden developed through deep abdominal breathing. Indeed, I was the first non-Japanese to supply Western judoka with this esoteric terminology. My own opinion is that no such person as Arima is the author of the matter you have kindly sent me. From the context he seems to figure simply as a leading character in a sort of novel or romance based upon various features of Japanese occultism.\n\nI myself knew a prominent yudansha of the Kodokan named Arima who wrote an excellent book on judo that was translated into English. [Ed.: Arima, Sumiotomo. Judo: Japanese Physical Culture. Tokyo: Mitsumura & Co., 1906, 1908.] I left my own copy in Japan, but our famous Gunji Koizumi, founder of the Budokwai, has a copy. Anyhow whoever is responsible for the subject matter has certainly taken a good many liberties with his elaboration of the theme. Certainly I have never yet heard any modern exponent of the kiai or aiki able to produce the startling phenomena so vividly described in the opening passages of the extract.\n\nKunishige was quite the most remarkable exponent of the kiai ever known to me during something like twenty years residence in Japan. Virtually all other demonstrations of the kiai were more or less perfunctory and devoid of genuinely occult efficacy. Of course not being personally acquainted with something like a million members of judo and jujutsu schools  perhaps more  I cannot pretend to know the precise extent of the powers possessed by individuals. It stands to reason, however, that if within the memory of any living person, Japanese or otherwise, a famous master had performed such feats as seemingly transforming a fan into a sword, or vice versa, or rendering a subject lifeless and then restoring him, his fame would long ere this have passed far beyond the boundaries of Dai Nippon.\n\nTrue, Kunishige could revive a seemingly dead person, and knowledge of kuatsu enables its possessor to restore the victim of strangulation provided it is promptly administered. But, say, the story of causing birds to fall senseless from a tree and then reviving them is taken from my Fighting Spirit of Japan. The story deals with one Matsujuro who flourished hundreds of years ago, and I myself never vouched for its truth!\n\nOur own well-known writer here, Shaw Desmond, has been guilty of similar inroads on my pages without acknowledgement. Such exaggerations are not really advantageous to the best interests of the art.\n\nNaturally I do not object to other writers elaborating ideas taken from my book, but I think they ought to indicate how much of the material served up in the form of a novel or a romance is based upon fact and how much is purely imaginary. Also when they reproduce the precise terminology of Japanese occultism they should be sporting enough to mention the source of their knowledge.\n\nSome time ago I was told by one Major Browne, a 1st Dan (shodan) of our Budokwai, now in Malaya, that he had himself read two novels in which credit was given to my book by the authors for the occult portions of their books. I cannot now recall the titles of the latter. It is therefore just possible that this \"Garden of Vision\" is one of them, and that somewhere in the authors introduction or preface mention is made of my book. In that case, of course, I have no grievance. Anyway, I think on further investigation you will find that it is not Arima who is the author, but that he is featured as a character in the book.\n\nYou may be interested to hear that a textbook on judo by me will shortly be published by Foyles of London. [Judo. London: W. & G. Foyle, 1950; New York: Dover Publications, 1950.] It runs to about 35,000 words and will contain 34 good line drawings and 32 photographs. Unfortunately the publishers have lost a great opportunity of bringing out a really comprehensive book. Although I describe as many as sixty throws, holds, locks, etc., the restriction of the number of photographs to only 32 means that some 28 techniques will not be illustrated. This is a grave shortcoming for which I cannot be held responsible. The book is to be sold at the absurdly low price of half a crown. [Ed.: Two and one half shillings, at the rate of 20 shillings to the pound.] I am already the author of a smaller manual of only 10,000 words published long before the war by Foulsham & Co., originally at a shilling but now selling at half a crown. [Foulsham's Physical Training Books, by H. F. Bush, in collaboration with E. J. Harrison, W. Foulsham & Co., London; 1935.] And yet a book three times as large will shortly be on the market at the same price! This hardly makes sense.\n\nWell, I must not bore you further with these idle fancies.\n\nDespite my venerable age of 76, I keep in close touch with the Budokwai and am often there for a chin-wag and consultation. I contribute a good deal to our quarterly bulletin, and nearly all my articles have been translated into the French by the leading French school in Paris. I am even contemplating re-emergence as a coach if my new book brings me any further useful publicity. Money is pretty tight on this side, and provided I am not required to engage in violent action on the mat, I think I am still sufficiently vigorous to demonstrate methods.\n\n(Apr. 12, 1953)\n\nAlthough I personally am very far from satisfied with my latest effort [Ed.: Manual of Judo, London: W. Foulsham & Co. 1952] I do feel justified in laying the \"flattering unction\" to my soul that the unprecedented epistolary interest thus manifested in the Manual may be interpreted as proof that its many readers are pleased with it. What is more, most of the obvious shortcomings should be ascribed not to my own incompetence but to the disheartening parsimony of the publishers, who, on the grounds of economy, insisted upon the excision of hundreds of words from the original text, the scrapping of a detailed index, and the omission of several illustrations of very important methods. Truly the path of the aspiring judo author is beset with obstacles!\n\nI am now doing the translations of the French text explanatory of various techniques, hitherto rendered into French from the Japanese original of the late Shuichi Nagaoka, 10th Dan, and Kaichiro Samura, 10th Dan. I have not so far been paid for this service, but instead am receiving free copies of the Anglo-French Judo Review including a complete set from its inception.\n\nIt may interest you to hear that I am engaged during my spare time in translating the Groundwork section of Tsunetani Odas celebrated work on judo. [Ed. Judo on the Ground. The Oda-9th Dan-method \"Katamewaza.\" An interpretation of the Oda system comprising numerous drastic immobilizations, necklocks and dislocation methods hitherto unknown in the West ... Line drawings by Jak. Photographs by I. Morris.] Oda is another of my contemporaries and well remembers me. He is now 9th Dan, and universally recognised as the greatest living authority on all three branches of katamewaza. I sent these versions to my pet protégé Malcolm Gregory, now 4th Dan, in Tokyo. He has acclaimed them, in his customary buoyant and trenchant manner, as the work of a \"bloody genius!\"\n\nMy old contemporary Shuichi Nagaoka died shortly before a copy of my Manual could reach him, but he remembered me, as when Gregory visited him, he referred to him as \"Harrison-san no tomodachi, ne? [Ed.: \"Mr. Harrisons friend, arent you?\"] The news of his demise at the age of 78 or 79 greatly depressed me. I do not derive any great personal satisfaction or gratification from the reflection that I am now the oldest living judoka in the world. (Ill be eighty on my next birthday.)\n\nAs for the translation of Odas work, I am selecting primarily the newazate. Of those, I am especially selecting the less orthodox and more drastic methods that have hitherto been banned at the Budokwai. Examples include the use of one leg or both legs to reinforce the power of the arms in various necklocks and bonelocks. I have begun on the kansetsuwaza, which number at least sixty, and am almost ready to start typing my rendering of 25 or thereabouts, together with an introduction.\n\nI do not pose as a Japanese scholar, but thanks to my ability to use a very fine ideographic dictionary coupled with my knowledge of the two syllabaries, the Hiragana and Katakana, I can generally grind out a fairly lucid rendering. Unfortunately Odas style isnt quite so clear as it might be and much less so than that of dear old Sakujiro Yokoyama, now no more, whose judo manual bequeathed me in the old days has served as a valuable guide to the interpretation of the more orthodox techniques.\n\nThe manager of Foulshams, publishers of the new Manual, Belasco by name, who ages ago accepted my little textbook on jujutsu (under the auspices of the late Yukio Tani!) [Ed.: The Art of Jiu-jitsu, 1932] and my textbook on wrestling [Ed.: Wrestling: catch-as-catch-can, Cumberland & Westmorland, & all-in styles. Published under the auspices of W. Wood, etc., 1928] has arranged to see me in a few days to discuss the publication of a new book which would include these Oda methods. It is as yet too soon to say whether this plan  a long-term one at best  can be realised, but both my wife and I feel pretty sure that had not the Manual been selling well Belasco would never dream of bothering his head about another work from my pen.\n\n(May 5, 1953)\n\nYou may be interested to hear that Foulsham & Co. have commissioned me to do two more judo books. The one for beginners is to comprise about 15,000 words and have a retail price of 3 shillings 6 pence. [Ed.: Judo for Beginners, London, 1953.] The other [Ed: Judo on the Ground], a much more ambitious venture on my part, bids fair to tax my modest powers to the utmost if I may hope to succeed. It is intended to embody the latest instruction in Groundwork, and is based upon a Japanese work written by one of my old-time contemporaries, Tsunetani Oda, 9th Dan. We shall of course frankly acknowledge the source of our information and the publishers have authorised me to offer Oda a fee of 25 guineas for the loan of the original photographic negatives because in the book they come out badly. If he cannot do this we shall be rather put to it to work out line drawings in the text. The manual for beginners is wanted at the beginning of July and the other book, which should run to about 50,000 words, early January next. Amid almost ceaseless alarums and excursions I have to gird up my loins or to vary the metaphor keep my bulbous proboscis to the grindstone many hours a day if I am to deliver the goods in accordance with this timetable.\n\nIt may prove impossible. I have still to tackle a lot more of the translation. The original text, I regret to say, is often not so clear as one might wish. (Or at any rate, as I, with my far from thorough knowledge of the Japanese printed word, could well desire.) Were I affluent I should fight shy of any more commitments of this kind, but unfortunately my wife and I are in decidedly difficult financial straits. So I cannot afford to turn down an opportunity of earning a little badly need lucre, albeit well aware beforehand that no sooner is it earned than it will be stolen from me by the blood-sucking vampires of the Inland Revenue. The local government is a gang of lousy socialists who squander hard cash galore at the ratepayers expense. One of their latest inspirations is an aviary! And we householders and ratepayers are soaked to provide luxuries and amenities for tenants of council flats [Ed.: Government-subsidized housing] such as we could not possibly afford for ourselves.\n\nNuff said.\n\n(July 1953)\n\nSo far we havent yet been privileged in this country to witness a demonstration of aikido. The one given by Tohei during the First National AAU Judo Tournament in San Jose, California, must certainly have been impressive. [Ed.: Said Robert W. Smith, writing in Budokwai Quarterly Bulletin, July 1953, p. 11: \"Tohei (8th Dan in Aikido), a visitor from Japan, put on a remarkable demonstration of this higher Judo  although it is, of course, not exactly that. Five yudansha, including Yoshimura (4th Dan) attacked him simultaneously and were summarily beaten off by the agile little man dancing so daintily on the tatami. The bout was unrehearsed and I have never seen anything equal to it.\"] The exhibition given for my special benefit by the great veteran Kunishige would seem to be the closest approach to it within my own personal experience. His seemingly effortless ability to pull several lusty young judoka around the dojo despite their desperate efforts to resist must surely be ascribed to what he then called aiki. Then, too, his power to resuscitate the seemingly dead  in certain circumstances  undoubtedly savours of the occult.\n\nI have placed in my publishers hands the typescript of my judo book for beginners. It was restricted to something like 15,000 words. I need hardly tell you that to keep within these limits I have had to leave out far more than I would have put in, and that the contents have had to be confined to an exposition of fundamental methods with the emphasis on nagewaza. Within those limits I have tried to make the booklet an amalgam of the explanations given by Tsunetani Oda and another prominent authority named Hikochi Aida.\n\nAs for the much fuller translation of Odas text, I must admit that Odas literary style is often far from lucid. It is clear from the context that he has confused his \"lefts\" and \"rights\", and rather curiously he speaks about a turn of the body to the right when we in the West would call it a turn to the left! I expect that in the end matters will boil down to something in the nature of judicious eclecticism and adherence to the prudent maxim, \"When in doubt, leave out.\"\n\nCould I afford to turn up my snout at the offer of filthy lucre, Id gladly chuck my hand in and rest upon my laurels, such as they are, for the duration. After completion of the Manual I was so utterly fed up with struggling against the publishers endeavours to ruin the blasted book that I swore a solemn oath that this would be my swan song. Unfortunately, I was fated to perjure myself in this respect. One of my hardest tasks has been to dissuade the well-meaning director from excursions into the domain of cheap sensationalism. To some extent I rejoice to say that these efforts have proved successful.\n\n(Nov. 6, 1953)\n\nI am in this evening of my long and misspent life infernally, hellishly, devilishly, diabolically, and not to forget demonically busy with commitments. Some are paid but all too many are unpaid!\n\nMy 80th birthday anniversary was celebrated (if that is the word) at the end of August by my old-time Lithuanian chiefs, friends, and admirers, whose name seems to be legion. I spent almost twenty colourful years in the service of the free and independent Lithuanian Government, now tragically superseded by the ineffably foul and obscene Soviet Russians. Although it is no longer possible for the Lithuanians to demonstrate their appreciation in a very tangible manner, they gave a big reception and dinner in my honour on August 29. For weeks afterward I was kept busy penning letters in Lithuanian acknowledging messages of congratulation from far and near.\n\nMeanwhile I have been in the throes of literary labour. This compilation based on the Oda techniques runs to more than 45,000 words and will have more than a hundred photographic illustrations. Doubtless the piercing optics of hypercritical readers will in due course detect many errors but all the same I devoutly hope that the residue will be found useful.\n\nTrevor Leggett is at present in Japan for the BBC. He has been putting in some practice at the Kodokan, but I hear from my greatest friend Malcolm Gregory that he can no longer vie with the younger generation of judoka. He is not yet forty but he has for some years been troubled with  I think it is  severe migraine and no longer goes in for contest. These days he confines his activities to instruction and the demonstration of kata during the periodical displays.\n\nYou will read in due course all about the last international contests held at the Albert Hall on October 30. The Dutch team carried off the European championship by beating the French team, till then holders of the championship. Sad to say our Budokwai team representing this country were badly beaten by the French and didnt score a single point. The Dutch triumph is remarkable considering not only Hollands small population but also the fact that their highest graded combatants were only 2nd Dan.\n\nThe Budokwais Gunji Koizumi and the new instructor Kawamura were the only Japanese performers. During the evening they gave a very fine demonstration of the classical koshiki kata. I also saw Henri Plée, who is the editor of the Anglo-French bimonthly Judo. He has agreed to pay me £50 for the right to translate into French my Fighting Spirit of Japan.\n\nFinally, a small dose of egotism. My small Judo for Beginners will be out on the 10th. Although necessarily restricted in its scope, I have done my utmost to bring the technical descriptions up-to-date.\n\n(Dec. 7, 1953)\n\nMy wife and I happen to be confirmed cat lovers. For more than two weeks we have been nursing a beautiful pet female Persian member of our feline family of six. First of all she contracted what is called \"cats flu,\" a post-war pathological phenomenon previously unknown to vets. Then in some mysterious way the trouble developed into pneumonia. For days past it has been a case of touch and go with her life hanging in the balance. However, thanks to the ministrations of our splendid vet with no expense spared we are beginning to cherish the hope that she is almost out of danger.\n\nOne has to be a cat lover to appreciate the keen anxiety we Harrisonai (Lithuanian plural of our surname!) are feeling as from day to day or even hour to hour we keep track of the patients symptoms and meticulously comply with the vets directions. And when I personally am required to switch at almost a moments notice from the ministrations of a male nurse to a job of translation calling for much mental concentration my correspondence suffers.\n\nI am interested to learn that  as coincidence would have it  your Masters thesis [ed. at the University of Washington] was on Deportation of Non-Slavic Peoples from The Baltic States to The Soviet Union, 1940-1950. This was undoubtedly one of the most atrocious crimes  the deportation, not your thesis!  recorded in historical annals.\n\nI am wondering which one of my books put you wise to the dichotomy underlying my personality. Perhaps it was Lithuania Past and Present [Ed.: Hazell, Watson & Viney: London, 1928], in which there is a passage referring to the famous catch-as-catch-can wrestler Karl Pozhela [Ed.: also Pojello], a pure Lithuanian whose acquaintance I made first in Great Russia while he was already a champion amateur middleweight. But for the hideous recital of Red enormities in Lithuania, I hope that you have been able to obtain a copy of a booklet I did for the Lithuanian American Information Center in New York entitled Lithuanias Fight for Freedom [Ed.: New York: 1952; a similarly titled text was published in London in 1944. I suppose I am one of the very few Britishers able to read, write, speak, and translate Lithuanian.\n\nMy other languages, apart from Japanese, are Russian, Polish, French, German (not too good) and Spanish (ditto). While in Japan I acquired a pretty good command of the colloquial or zokugo and today with the aid of a dictionary I can figure out Japanese judo texts. Alas, we are young only once in a lifetime. Believe me, after forty or thereabouts the days, months, and years seem to pass by like lightning, and almost before one realises it one is in the sear and yellow leaf.\n\nMy latest judo effort entitled Judo on the Ground, based on the Oda system, is in Foulshams hands. It runs to at least 45,000 words and will be quite well illustrated.\n\n(Jan. 23, 1954)\n\nI am daily expecting to have the proofs of Judo on the Ground dumped on me, but actual publication must still be in the offing. The publishers tell me that it will run to about 50,000 words, or about 190 pages. The illustrations are reproduced from Odas  very bad  originals. The retail price will be about fifteen shillings.\n\nBelasco, director of Foulshams, has virtually commissioned me to grind out another interpretation of a huge Japanese work by one Aida, 8th Dan, who is reputed to be the best all-round exposition of judo yet extant. But for the grisly fact that my wife and I are in dire need of filthy lucre I should decline with thanks. But needs must, etc., and so I have already made a hesitant start on this arduous task. Fortunately Belasco has authorised me to engage the services of some Japanese student  if one can be found in these confines  to help me with the more difficult and abstruse passages. One other snag is that an Englishman in Japan is engaged in much the same sort of task. Since he enjoys the inestimable advantage of being at the fountainhead of judo knowledge with ready access to the sources, he may very well beat us to it!\n\nI am further fated to work here in the midst of frequent interruptions prejudicial to concentration. Under economic stress I do the translations from French of much of the matter printed in Henri Plées Revue Judo Kodokan. The remuneration isnt exactly munificent but I cannot afford to turn it down. All in all I find the days much too short for the multifarious duties I have to pack into them.\n\n(Feb. 22, 1954)\n\nAlthough I am usually loath to inflict my troubles upon others, I think you ought to know that I long ago ceased to be a sound insurance risk. The timeworn ticker aint what it used to be and might now go back upon me at any moment.\n\nStrange as perhaps it may seem to those that have no special liking for animals in general and cats in particular, the loss in early December of our most beautiful female feline gave me a nasty shock and I simply cannot snap out of the depression into which this painful incident has plunged me. Frankly speaking, apart from a few chosen friends, I am apt to prefer our cats society to that of the average human being! However I continue to adhere to my more or less Spartan regimen and well-meaning acquaintances still insist that externally I do not look my true age. Having confessed so much, I will pass on to more cheerful themes.\n\nThe Oda whose katamewaza system I have tried to summarise in my new book is Tsunetani Oda, 9th Dan. He is still very much alive. Gregory met him in Tokyo, did some newaza with him, and further reported that Oda remembered me as an older contemporary with whom, to use his own words, he had had in the past many a merry bout of randori. I do not know any other Oda.\n\nThe blithesome jest seems to be that while admittedly I do not feel able at eighty to turn out the volume of work whereof I was capable at twenty-five, many of my contemporaries apparently expect me to exude a bloody sight more! And what between sordid domestic chores on the one hand and a voluminous personal correspondence and the production of alleged judo literature (four books in the last three years and a problematical fifth in the offing) on the other, Im conceited enough to think that my present-day exertions will bear comparison with those of 55 years ago. Yet true enough, were I free and affluent instead of being an economic serf and damned hard up in our halcyon Welfare State, nothing would please me more than to quit the Hub with its hubbubs and like Popes \"blameless vestal\" retire to some remote beauty spot \"the world forgetting by the world forgot\". But I am evidently fated to die in harness  or should I say in chains?\n\nTo answer your question, I have never seen a demonstration of French savate. Nor for that matter have I any first-hand knowledge of karate. Where is there an exposition of this system?\n\n(May 20, 1954)\n\nSpeaking of Charles Yerkow, I wish right away to plead guilty to the soft impeachment of not being an original writer on judo. And to the best of my recollection I have never set out to be anything pretentious. \"My will hath in it a more modest working.\" Unless my memory plays me false in the Foreword to my Manual I go out of my way to make this fact quite plain and to avow my debt to leading Japanese authorities.\n\nIn a few special cases applicable to  for the most part  tachiwaza I have ventured to obtrude a more or less independent interpretation. For the rest I think it is fair to say that my modest contribution to the art is an amalgam compounded of explanations and expositions culled from such writers as the late Sakujiro Yokoyama, who when he bequeathed me his fine pioneer work on judo [Ed.: Judo. Tokyo: Nishodo, 1915] expressed the hope that I might at some future date make use of it as I have done, plus subsequent writers such as Oda, Takahiko Ishikawa, and Aida.\n\nIf I may be permitted the luxury of a pat on my own back (rather a difficult waza), I have been at considerable pains to transmute the frequently muddled locutions and execrable style of the Japanese original texts into passable English. From this point of view my dope is a trifle removed from mere translation.\n\nIf you have my smaller Judo for Beginners you will note much the same acknowledgement of my indebtedness to Japanese authorities noted in the Preface. One more claim to an innovation: I think my Foyles Judo broke new ground by furnishing readers with a glossary of Japanese judo terminology. This has been greatly amplified in my Manual. My Judo on the Ground, openly based on the Oda system, includes another special glossary of current terms.\n\nIncidentally, Yerkows Official Judo [Ed.: New York: A. A. Wyn, 1953] was recently submitted to me by the publishers Herbert Jenkins Ltd. for a report. Between us, I felt bound to tell them that unless the work could be considerably revised and amplified, its publication here would add very little to the knowledge of judo. Yerkow has contrived to omit some of the most effective and spectacular methods in each division, and there is no Japanese terminology. The American publishers refused to allow any alterations to be made in the text so the deal was off.\n\nIn the domain of judo bibliography \"the cry is still they come\" would seem to be an appropriate slogan. At this rate it will soon become a distinction not to have written a book on the subject, as the late Basil Hall Chamberlain once said about books on Japan. Be this as it may, I honestly feel that as an interpreter of sorts I am doing the cause of judo enlightenment in the West a much greater service than were I to attempt to foist my own out-of-date ideas upon a credulous public.\n\n(Jul. 10, 1954)\n\nI must thank you sincerely for the immense trouble you have taken, as evidenced in your letter addressed to Charles Yerkow, to refute the charge that I am what is called a lift writer on judo. In my last letter to you I brazenly admitted the justice of the soft impeachment. All the same when I read your apologia I was conscious of summat not far removed from a glow of self-righteousness permeating my timeworn carcass.\n\nIncidentally, from that copy of your other letter to \"Truley Yours\" I learn for the first time that there is a fighting art called Gung Fu. I have already heard about this karate but Gung Fu is new to me. [EN1]\n\nI am fagging away at a very free translation of the well-known work by Aida and have almost finished the draft, which runs perhaps to about 60,000 words. It will be necessary for me to get hold of an intelligent Japanese student well versed in English to help me clarify the obscure and cryptic passages in the original text. I am not in any sense a Japanese scholar. Very much on the contrary it is dashed hard work for me to verify the ever-recurrent unfamiliar terms and expressions in their ideographic guise.\n\nWhen I based my earlier books on Yokoyamas excellent manual I had far less trouble because Yokoyama had thoughtfully provided alongside virtually all his ideographs (kanji) their Hiragana pronunciations. The newer judo manuals no longer follow this practice. Therefore I am compelled to look up every unknown word (most of them are disyllables) in the excellent ideographic dictionary in my possession for which I once paid four guineas. Next I combine the two-component on or Sinico-Japanese sounds and verify this combination by reference to Takenoubu Yoshitaros very fine and comprehensive Japanese-English dictionary. For the most part I have managed fairly well but all the same here and there I have come up against sticky problems which call for the co-operation of a Japanese native son to solve.\n\nI expect you know that every Japanese ideograph is made up of the so-called radical which indicates the classification of the word and the so-called phonetic which indicates its pronunciation. Unless and until you can identify the radical in an otherwise strange ideograph (kanji) you are bound to have a hell of a job looking up and finding the word in the ideographic dictionary. There are about 214 generally used radicals and the more you know of these the better for your purpose.\n\nDuring my fairly long residence in Japan I had to work far too hard as a journalist to find the leisure essential to anything approaching mastery of all the radicals or the difficult written language. But, at the cost of one nervous breakdown in my early twenties, I did get the hang of the basic principles and this modest knowledge has since stood me in good stead.\n\nLuckily judo books as a rule are not couched in the Simon-pure written lingo. Instead they are written in semi-colloquial (zokugo) language which I am able  with considerable difficulty at times  to understand. Without that foundation, however, I could never have made use of such a thing as an ideographic dictionary.\n\nOf course my familiarity with the judo terminology has also been a great help in facilitating this ambitious enterprise. And anything like a literal translation of any Japanese book would be sheer imbecility.\n\nMy aim has been to transmute the turgid, long-winded, and often absurdly pretentious language of the Japanese author into reasonably lucid English, and I am grateful to you for your tribute to what you regard as my success in this endeavour.\n\nWhen next you write to me Id be interested to hear what textbooks you are using at your end in your study of the kanji. I am almost certain that specialists have elaborated appreciably better methods than were available in my day.\n\nMy linguistic lot is not at all lightened by the dire necessity of keeping in close touch with my other languages which I need if and when I am called upon (all too rarely) to do a job of translation for filthy lucre. Thus I have to ring the changes on Russian, Polish, and Lithuanian, not to mention French and German.\n\nI shall shortly be starting to translate Kawaishis Ma Méthode de Judo from the French. It runs about 40,000 words. Kawaishi is head of the Fédération Française de Judo et de Jiu-jitsu in France and he has granted W. Foulsham & Co. the exclusive right of translation on the express understanding that I undertake it. Foulshams are to pay me 100 guineas for this job, which may take a few months. It may hold up my completion of the Aida version but this work will be much more straightforward. My name will appear on the title page as translator and editor.\n\nLet me confess to you that I have by now had almost a surfeit of judo and would fain retire on my laurels would Destiny permit, but needs must. Were I free and affluent I should like nothing better than to devote my final years to breaking a few lances in the cause of my second homeland, Lithuania.\n\n(Aug. 20, 1954)\n\n\"Tell it not in Gath\"  81 this month.\n\nJudo on the Ground ought to be out shortly.\n\nMeanwhile, for about two hours every afternoon I am working with a Japanese student on the revision of my rendering in English of the Japanese text of Aidas huge classic Analysis of Judo. An exhaustive translation is out of the question and would far and away exceed the publishers requirements, but I estimate that I have at least 60,000 words in English. This is a great book but not immaculate. I have never yet in all my experience come across a judo textbook guiltless of errors, usually in the matter of \"rights\" and \"lefts\". Also my Japanese assistant has confirmed my independent detection of  in some cases  the erroneous substitution of \"arms\" for \"legs\"!\n\nI remember Aida as a young man of about 27 when in the 1920s he spent some time teaching at the Budokwai. So he has now turned sixty. He was short but powerfully built, decidedly good-looking, and invincible on the mat. He is ranked as 8th Dan. His reputation as an authority and instructor stands very high and his book was sponsored by Risei Kano, the late Nagaoka, and Mifune.\n\nThe devil alone knows how I am going to type these two scripts when complete. The trouble always is that one has to deal with people that do not possess the foggiest idea of the labour involved in translation from any language and above all from the Japanese.\n\nIn the midst of all these alarums and excursions I am almost daily flooded with a spate of Lithuanian literature  bulletins and newspapers from the USA  that I would fain absorb but simply havent the leisure essential for this purpose. Truth to tell I have had a surfeit of judo and would, were it possible, retire on my modest laurels, but unhappily we cannot afford to dispense with the none too lavish receipts emanating from that source.\n\nDuring the past two weeks the tragic suicide by gas poisoning of one of our oldest and most valued friends, an art teacher, has cast a deep shadow over our lives. He was threatened by imminent blindness and could not face the prospect of becoming a burden upon his wife.\n\nThat extraordinary American and judo dilettante Walker Edwards is now in town with Tsunetani Oda, 9th Dan, and we have gathered several times under this roof. Oda is in the early sixties, quite on the small side, very inoffensive and appreciative of our restricted hospitality. He has been up in Scotland giving a few lessons in katamewaza at an Edinburgh Dojo, and together with Edwards will shortly be setting out for Germany and then France. Thereafter, I presume, its back to Dai Nippon.\n\nEdwards is about 48, tall and rather distinguished looking, but clearly a crank with a firm belief in his own political infallibility. He must have lashings of filthy lucre to travel almost ceaselessly over the globe coquetting with judo. He has brought Oda over from Japan by air and will send him back by the same route.\n\nI hear from Greg [Ed.: e.g., Malcolm Gregory] fairly regularly. He sounds very happy in California but plans at some future date to return to Japan for a refresher course. I presume he will again stay with his great Japanese friend Ishikawa. One of his current problems is to sidestep the allurements of Californian high life as exemplified, between us, by the eternal feminine in swimsuits! From what I know of him I dont seriously think that the peril is a dire one.\n\n(Sep. 11, 1954)\n\nYoull be pleased to hear that your colleague Art Broadbent ran me to earth about three weeks ago. He spent a forenoon with us and met my wife who invited him to dine with us the following Sunday. Unfortunately, after accepting the invitation, he found he couldnt come along. He telephoned me to report that he had had a workout at the Budokwai in its new quarters in South Kensington and had failed to score a single throw!\n\nKawamura, the chief instructor, had greatly impressed him. Since Broadbent is a 3rd Dan, I think we may fairly assume that under Kawamuras ministrations the standard of waza must have greatly improved.\n\nBroadbent then told me that he was about to set out again for the North. I should have liked to see more of him, but as they say in Dai Nippon, shikata ga nai, it cant be helped.\n\nDuring our personal meeting he told me quite a few interesting things about your own \"poisonality.\" Clearly he is an admirer of yours.\n\nBefore leaving London on the eighth instant to visit my oldest surviving first cousin in Yorkshire, I had already typed more than half the translation of Kawaishis book. I hope to finish the rest when I get back in about a fortnight or three weeks. But the typing of at least 60,000 words of the Aida book will be a decidedly tough proposition.\n\nThanks awfully for your all too flattering references to me in your bibliography of judo. I shall have to order a greater size in hats as a result!\n\n(Oct. 10, 1954)\n\nI have just finished my translations of the Kawaishi book and am to take it along to Belasco of Foulshams on Tuesday, the 12th inst. Belasco has agreed to pay me 100 guineas for my pains. We are returning here in a taxi together since Belasco is to dine with us that evening so that my wife can bring her charm to work upon his susceptibilities! He is by the way a widower. We are pretty old friends and I know he rather likes me.\n\nI have made a start on the typing of my Aida version. So far Ive ground out nearly 80 quarto pages, averaging about 300 words a page. I reckon therefore that my English version must run to at least 60,000 words if not more. As yet I havent fixed up any terms with Belasco.\n\nMuch to my surprise, Belasco on the telephone the other day brought up the question of my Fighting Spirit of Japan. He told me he had had inquiries from certain quarters about a reprint. Quite a while ago I lent him the book to read in the hope that he might be induced to reproduce it, but gently though firmly he turned down the idea so I let the matter drop. He also mentioned that his son had been discussing it with him. So it may be on the cards that he will finally decide to take a chance on it. The point of course is that a potential clientele for such a work is steadily increasing among judo fans and may already conceivably have reached such proportions as to justify a bolder policy than would formerly have been worthwhile. The joke is that, as I ascertained in our talk over the telephone, Belasco hadnt actually read the book at all. Indeed, he intimated that he had thought it was some kind of a novel!\n\nAnyhow, I am to cart the thing along with me on Tuesday and this time he really will go through it carefully. We are in a bit of a quandary over the blasted title. Yet in the end it may be advisable to leave it as it is because virtually a hundred percent are within this particular orbit pro-Japanese. Therefore the words \"Fighting Spirit of Japan\" arent at all likely to scare them. And the fact remains that the book has already become widely known by that title and might not later be identified were we to reprint it under some alternative name. But better not count our chickens before they are hatched.\n\nAll in all it would seem that I am better known in the USA than in my native land. But are we not told that a man is never a prophet in his own country?\n\nI have already mailed you an autographed copy of my Judo on the Ground. I must warn you that I am not at all satisfied with the overall result, especially as regards \"JAKs\" line drawings from the book photographs. Many of his drawings leave a devil of a lot to be desired, and the odds are that sooner or later the book will incur a spate of well-deserved criticism under this particular head. I did actually point out many of these defects to the Foulsham manager Houlgate when I was disentangling the figures but it was evident he had no wish to go to the trouble and delay of having any of them redrawn, so there you are.\n\nIn spite of all the raucous ballyhoo about the amenities of our Merrie Welfare State and Spongers Paradise, the sad fact remains that we are hag-ridden with a bloated bureaucracy. The most appalling outrages camouflaged as \"law\" are daily being perpetrated by countless local and central authorities, in the form of the compulsory purchase of land at prices arbitrarily fixed, which prices rarely if ever bear the remotest relation to the actual market value of the land or the prices paid by the dispossessed owners. Thus that hoary old adage about an Englishmans home being his castle has become a sorry jest. Already one poor victim of such an outrage has gone and hanged himself.\n\nThe virtually totalitarian powers and prerogatives of the executive and local government have reached such a pitch that our right to be regarded as a true democracy should be seriously challenged. Even a Tory government has obviously fallen under the malign spell of this official itch for more and more encroachments on the liberty of the subject. I wonder how this state of affairs compares with procedure in the USA.\n\nThe recent rate of mortality among our older friends has been alarming, and now I suppose I must be almost the oldest of these relative contemporaries. \"The grave doth gape and doting death is near. Therefore exhale!\"\n\n(Nov. 24, 1954)\n\nYou must realise that the prospective reprint of Fighting Spirit shall have to a large extent be guided by what Belasco wants. Here, for example, is a case in point.\n\nSome weeks ago we had him over here for the evening meal, and after dinner he relaxed up here in an easy chair before the fire and dipped into the pages of said book. When we began to talk about the necessity for abridgement I suggested that perhaps my chapter on the Japanese Eternal Feminine might be sacrificed. Whereupon he put in a most emphatic negative insisting that this was among the most interesting in the book!\n\nThis phase of the subject will amuse you. I was over at his office some weeks ago and there met his son Ronnie Belasco, who is married to an American and represents the firm in New York. We discussed between ourselves the question of publication and during this informal talk I regaled both father and son with a rather hectic description of the Japanese licensed quarters, more particularly the famed Tokyo Yoshiwara and the strange distinctive elaborate ceremonial governing the patronage of the higher-class resorts of Tokyos \"Nightless City\". This recital so fascinated both of them that Belasco urged me to include a chapter on this very subject in any reprint of the book! I am quite prepared to do this because I have plenty of material for the purpose.\n\nI am still waiting to hear from Belasco. As a matter of fact I have written him this very day (November 25) in a letter returning my signed copy of the agreement on the Aida book in which your are interested and have asked him to expedite his decision and views on the Fighting Spirit.\n\nI handed in my typescript of translation a few weeks ago. I reckon it must run to quite 70,000 words. Belasco is granting me 10 percent royalty instead of the 7-1/2 percent allowed on the Manual and Judo on the Ground. While admittedly this work is important and many of the authors descriptions are undoubtedly exceptionally detailed, I found that the text bristled with what are let us hope printers errors. Examples include confusion between right and left, hand and foot, etc. Thus he will explain that you seize your opponents lapel with your foot or slide your hand along the ground!\n\nThe Japanese student Inouye who spent a week with me here entirely confirmed my original discovery of these weird lapses. Moreover his descriptions are unequal and in several instances they impressed me as so poor and incomplete that I deemed it essential to substitute others from Oda and/or Ishikawa to clarify the position for future readers. And he omitted at least ten highly important waza. Here too I have had to provide on my own account. Again although in his introduction he has classified the various methods (tewaza, ashiwaza, koshiwaza, sutemiwaza, etc.) in the subsequent text he lumps them all together \"in most admired disorder\" without any intimation of the branch to which they belong, so that I have had to make good this lapse as well. Nothing is said about atemiwaza and in every other book the book is orthodox in contradistinction to the Oda method which makes use of the feet and legs in the execution of katamewaza.\n\nI deliberately left out his description of the Ju-no-kata with its 100-odd line drawings. These Forms of Gentleness impress me as of minor interest to younger judoka and their inclusion would have expanded my version far beyond the scope of the Belasco plan for a book to sell at a price between 18 and 25 shillings. At the Budokwai public displays these forms are invariably demonstrated by women or  as a special treat (?) by Koizumi and Dame Russell-Smith -- and rarely fail to bore the spectators and to evoke only perfunctory applause.\n\nI think Balasco hopes to be able to issue the book about July next.\n\nShortly I shall have galley proofs of Kawaishis important book on my hands. Like Oda he has not scrupled to include kansetsuwaza and shimewaza that are taboo at the Kodokan and in this country. He has, however, gone one better than Oda in that he describes some really devastating leg and dislocation neck locks that are entirely foreign to my own judo experience in Dai Nippon. In my preface to my translation I point out that even though these dangerous methods cannot safely be introduced into friendly practice and contest they should nonetheless be taught to responsible yudansha unless we are anxious to expose them (the yudansha) to the possible humiliation not to say disaster of defeat at the hands and legs of toughs and plug-uglies who have managed to pick up this dangerous knowledge.\n\nIn a letter to Malcolm Gregory I mentioned this merit of Kawaishis book. He still insists that my Judo on the Ground \"is the outstanding book of all judo works. Can there ever be a better? I sincerely doubt it.\" Quite flattering to my senile amour propre. I must admit that I had awaited Gregs estimate with no little trepidation so that when it came I inwardly breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nFoulshams are having fresh drawings made of the two worst efforts of the ineffable JAK, these for the next printing. Already 2,500 copies of the book have been sold and fresh orders continue to come in. The total printing is 5,000.\n\nWhat a hell of an uphill task it is, this dealing with publishers! The rub is that Belasco, much as I like him, knows damn all about judo yet takes it upon himself to \"check through\" my typescript. I am perpetually upon tenterhooks in the uneasy expectation that he will call for some drastic curtailment of the text and thereby almost ruin the work. He wanted to do this with the Manual and his fatuous plan would have necessitated the excision of two chapters! Can you beat it?\n\nWhile Id joyfully relegate all further literary exertions in this domain to the demnition bow-wows, when all is said and done I ought to be grateful to Belasco. Without his support the Harrisonai might long ere this have become inextricably bogged down in the red, with a debtors prison in the offing as their ultimate objective. What does fairly infuriate me here is that no sooner do we earn a little extra by dint of the most intensive labour than we are robbed of a big slice of it by the State, an institution not inaptly characterised by George Schwartz of the Sunday Times as a \"liar, a thief and a cad.\" Almost invariably at the end of every year we find ourselves bled white by the local and central parasites.\n\nI note that you have got hold of my Peace or War East of Baikal [Ed.: Kelly and Walsh: Yokohama, 1910]. Im afraid a good many of my political assumptions and inferences havent been justified by the sequel and my final decidedly abrupt summing-up now impresses me as inept. All the same I certainly did put in a tremendous amount of work on its compilation and managed to collect a mass of factual material of which numerous other publicists did not subsequently scruple to acknowledge the source.\n\nMany of the photographs were my own. In some respects I was handicapped by my residence in Japan which tended to militate against 100 percent frankness on particular aspects of the problems involved. However, I did sense that notwithstanding the surface veneer of Japanese friendship for the USA there was a strong current of underlying hostility in certain Japanese quarters.\n\nAs for remarking on the work of other judo authors, suffice it to say that I would never have the temerity to pose for pictures myself.\n\n(Dec. 15, 1954)\n\nI am again fiendishly busy, this time revising the Manual. Belasco wants an additional 8 or 9 pages (sides) of fresh matter, most of which I have already ground out for insertion. But the trouble with Belasco & Co. always is that when it comes to a pinch they are always afraid to go to any extra expense entailed by the inclusion of extra figures so essential to a clear comprehension of the text. Already in the first edition, as you must have noted, two of the more important shimewaza, viz., the okurierijime and the sodeguruma are not illustrated and in the kansetsuwaza division, that other highly important jumonjigatame, also is not illustrated. I have pointed out that it would be puerile for us to fail to repair these disastrous omissions while at the same time piling on additional illustrated matter. Nonetheless I shall be greatly surprised if these considerations carry a conclusive appeal and induce them to follow my advice. I am indeed amazed that we havent long ere this been the recipient of indignant oaths from disappointed readers on their discovery of these blanks.\n\nI am kept busy too by Monsieur Plée, and have only just gotten through the translation of some thousands of words of dope for his next issue. It is dished up to me in long sheets of cheap yellow paper, single-spaced, and bristling with corrections written in with ink, and I am often put to it to make sense of many locutions in the original text.\n\nDid I tell you in my last that the Aida book may see the light by next July? I shall soon be snowed under with the Kawaishi proofs.\n\n(Jan. 8, 1955)\n\nYour news about Mifunes book [Ed.: Canon of Judo] is startling and it has shaken dear old Belasco more than somewhat. Apparently he is under the impression that some English publishing firm is bringing out the English version. But the inference I have drawn from your letter is that this English translation is being prepared and published in Tokyo. Can you enlighten us further on this important point? Belasco further remarks: \"I think I have already explained to you what a racket this publishing business is in this day and age, and I think we must follow the present mode of though which is the devil take the hindmost.\"\n\nI must say that personally I really dread the prospect of having to wade through another huge dose of the kanji in order to add my sum of more to that which already has a bloody sight too much. Truth to tell, Im about sick and tired of judo and all its works, especially the sublimated crap I get in cartloads from Plée, much of it a repetition ad nauseum of orthodox throws as executed by various Japanese. I must frankly say that with rare exceptions the gift of clear and lucid exposition seems to be denied the average Japanese judo writer and as often as not I find it necessary to correct blatant mistakes usually occurring in the confusion of lefts and rights. These writers are too fond of splitting up their explanations into numbered and serialised sections instead of giving you a smoothly running, fluid story of the relevant technique. It will therefore be quite interesting for me to see whether my old friend Mifune has been guilty of the same boring method.\n\nThe policy of depicting judo as something sacrosanct which they call \"The Way\" or \"The Path\" productive of supermen gives me a pain in my scraggy neck. Actually youll find about as much petty intrigue, jealousy, hostile rivalry, and what-not among the ranks of judoka as in any other sporting environment. Were it not that I am in dire need of our debased currency Id cheerfully withdraw from the wearisome task of interpreting the ideas of Japanese writers and devote the limited residue of my existence to the support of the Lithuanian cause which means a damned sight more to me than judo. The very best and most generous treatment I have ever known in the course of my long and often misspent life has come and continues to come from my old Lithuanian chiefs and colleagues. It is always a source of regret that I cannot give them a great deal more of my time and mental energies, such as they are.\n\nRegarding your question about my perpetual grade of 3rd Dan, it no longer matters to me whether I am moved up a peg before I shuffle off this mortal coil. Between us, doesnt this very fact illustrate my earlier remark about the petty jealousy underlying the conduct of judo affairs? Nor does this wonderful Way people never tire of prating engender conspicuously good manners. For example, I have yet had an acknowledgement from any Budokwai judoka of a complimentary and autographed copy of any books I have sent them. Fact!\n\n(Jan. 19, 1955)\n\nIn the near future I will be revising my Fighting Spirit of Japan which Belasco has to all intents and purposes decided to reprint.\n\nOur local and central fiscal vampires seem to take a sadistic delight in bleeding us white. Only the other day, after waiting ten years since the end of the war, did I feel justified in treating my desiccated hide to a new and roomy overcoat to replace horribly shabby old ones far too tight for my bulbous body. Believe it or not but rarely in the course of my long and often misspent life have I had to slave so hard as in the Dämmerung of my doleful days on this \"goodly frame, the earth\".\n\n(Feb. 1, 1955)\n\nI have this day received by airmail from Tokyo a copy of the Mifune magnum opus, Judo Kyoten: Michi to Jutsu [Ed.: The Canon of Judo: The Way and the Art]. Am I right in my inference that the book has been sent to me thanks to your kind offices? If so would you write direct to Belasco letting him know the total cost of this service and to whom the money should be paid.\n\nAlthough I havent yet had enough time to examine it in detail even a cursory survey of the contents has sufficed to satisfy me that it is a splendid thing. The effect of this superficial scrutiny is to bring home to one what an absolute tyro one is at this end! It has made me realise as perhaps never before what an impostor I am to pose as an authority on the art! Fortunately I have from the first and consistently been careful at all times to disavow any claim to be an expert.\n\nBelasco wrote me a few days ago that he would like to see me one day this week to discuss the revision of The Fighting Spirit of Japan. You will have learnt from my previous letter that he  greatly daring  plans to have me produce an abridged version of the Mifune masterpiece. Between us I am none too happy over the idea and am daunted by the prospect. A large-scale abridgement could be brought out only at an almost prohibitive price. On the other hand our financial position is so precarious that I hesitate to turn down the proposal out of hand.\n\n(Feb. 9, 1955)\n\nSoon after dispatching my last letter to you I went along to Foulshams and had a talk with Belasco. I think I mentioned to you a short while ago that he has been quite keen on my undertaking what he calls an abridgement of the book as soon as possible despite the virtual certainty that a Kodokan official translation will soon be on the book market. However, after I pointed out that I was not prepared to undertake such an onerous task single-handed, would in any case require skilled Japanese collaboration to tackle such a wealth of fresh material, and that the job might well take a year, he began to see the red light. Now as a possible alternative we are going to approach Risei Kano with a proposition that Foulshams should handle the English translation upon a business basis, something they are well able to do with their world-wide organisation. I must say I am vastly relieved over this possible issue because even if everything were open and above board I do not feel equal to the mental and physical fag, plus eye-strain, which the task would entail.\n\nWhen I was at the Foulsham office Houlgate told me that the Aida book would not be published before the end of this year or the beginning of next. This is rather bad news for me because before it sees the light the Mifune magnum opus will have stolen a march upon it, so that its sales are likely to be adversely affected. (The authority of a mere 8th Dan like Aida can hardly compare with that of a 10th Dan of Mifunes calibre.) Lucky for me that Belasco has already paid me an advance royalty of £75 on account of the Aida translation!\n\nMeanwhile I have corrected all the book proofs of my translation of Kawaishis Method of Judo, a tiresome and meticulous job for which Im not paid an extra bean. Despite minor shortcomings from which no judo book is free I regard it as a very valuable addition to the judo bibliography, especially in the Groundwork section.\n\nProbably ere this youve read I. Morriss disparaging notice of the Oda book in the Budokwai Bulletin for January. Or shall we say he has damned it with faint praise? He is wholly within his rights and there is some justification for his comments on the line drawings. Be this as it may I can well afford to take a philosophical view of his remarks seeing that so far some 3,400 copies of the book have been sold. But I had to smile at his curt remark that I had inserted \"a few ideas\" of my own. Why shouldnt I? Or am I risking excommunication for my hardihood in criticising the official taboo of leg locks and the use of the leg or legs in the application of shime and kansetsuwaza? In that case my introduction to the Kawaishi translation bids fair to evoke open denunciation of my temerity in challenging orthodoxy.\n\nIm still waiting for Belascos outline of the needed revision of the Fighting Spirit. The protracted delay in this context is simply infuriating. Once I start I intend to do a bit of debunking of the inflated claims wherewith we are nowadays flooded by our prize japanomaniacs. The apparent awe with which these impressionable and credulous worthies speak and write about THE WAY (in caps) is quite ludicrous. So much sublimated crap! Malcolm Gregory shares this viewpoint to the hilt. So does Ishikawa!\n\n(Mar. 21, 1955)\n\nThe revision of Fighting Spirit has entailed an average of six or seven hours typing daily for at least six weeks. I see Belasco in a day or two to hand it over.\n\nThe true and basic leitmotif of the book is the fighting spirit of Japan, and we hope to attract the attention and interest of readers as far as possible beyond the category of judo fans and fanatics. I have felt bound to do a bit of debunking in the light of what happened during the last war and to make it clear beyond peradventure of doubt that the retention of the old title must not be construed as condoning the ghastly failure of bushido, bujutsu, michi, et al., to live up to their highfalutin professions. And since then the claims put forward by the clamorous votaries of the art to produce a species of superman motivated by the loftiest ethical particulars really give one a pain in the neck.\n\nBelasco plans to bring out the revised version of Fighting Spirit in the autumn and my Aida version early next year. Naturally before then I shall be fairly snowed under with proofs. The revised version of the Manual is already done. Then  most formidable task of all  Belasco wants me to do the story of my misspent life!\n\nThe prospect tends to daunt me. I think I have a fair amount of raw material but Im wondering whether at this late date I shall prove capable of infusing into the story the ingredient of exuberance and la joie de vivre without which any autobiography must inevitably fall flat. Also  a grisly reflection!  shall I survive long enough to consummate the task?\n\nIt isnt being morbid on my part to realise that I am reaching the end of my mortal tether and that my early objective may well be the electric flames of the nearest crematorium. And thatll be the end of me; at least I think so because I do not believe in survival. I eschew dogmatism and like [the nineteenth century British mathematician William] Winwood Reade I concede its possibility. To all intents and purposes Im an agnostic like most of my male kinsmen. For the rest Ive left a brilliant future behind me. I never try to disturb the faith of others and I never start a religious discussion. But there it is.\n\nBefore I forget: Ive followed your advice and have incorporated an appropriate quotation from Herrigels fine book [Ed.: Zen and the Art of Archery] into what I conceive to be the most suitable section, as also your friends experience described in the Budokwai Bulletin. Ive done my best with what little data at my disposal to describe karate and aikido. My survey of judo expansion outside Japan avoids statistics, which always tend to be a crashing bore. In any case there would be no space for anything like an exhaustive country-by-country survey and I make no pretence under that head.\n\nI have amplified some of the original chapters, sometimes with personal reminiscences. In treating of the obvious past and now defunct personalities I have naturally adjusted the tense forms accordingly, for the most part making use of what the French would call the past historic.\n\nIn my last chapter, \"Postscript,\" I have frankly avowed my conviction that the impact of an alien military occupation upon the Japanese has been and continues to be vulgarising. I know this inevitable tendency from my own military experience during the First World War when I saw it in operation in France and North Russia. It would be too much to expect that judo could remain immune from this pernicious influence.\n\nOverall, my theme was \"Tell the truth and shame the devil.\"\n\nI roughly estimate the revised version to total about 80,000 words. Illustrations are cut down to 17 in place of the original 34. The retail price will be eighteen shillings as against the original twelve shillings six pence for a far better produced book. Belasco is allowing me 10 percent on his sale price only, which is twelve shillings. Of course he is taking a risk. To comply with his requirements Ive had to sacrifice what I consider quite a bit of interesting stuff. Between us, I fancy the basic material isnt exactly his cup of tea, but what he thinks is a promising demand has induced him to incur the risk. When alls said and done the author may propose but the publisher disposes and not without reason. Belasco is a good sort and our association has been a godsend to the Harrisonai.\n\n(Jun. 28, 1955)\n\nI must thank you greatly for quoting me in extenso that condensed but remarkably accurate sketch of my career from H.E. Wildes Social Currents in Japan of which I have never heard before. Also for D. Draegers flattering comment [Ed.: \"\"E.J. can make a privy sound like a palace\"] on my literary style. How great minds think alike!\n\nOur friend Gregory has beaten you to it with the report of Ishikawas arrival. He tells me that Ishikawa would fain persuade him to accompany him on a tour of Cuba and the South Americas but that hes a little too happy with his present lot in Los Angeles to indulge in a journey with His Nibs. And for my part I dont blame him, do you?\n\nIn other respects his letter reflects a mood which I too largely share, viz., reaction against what he not inaptly calls \"cosmic moonshine\", which nowadays impinges more and more upon the subject of judo and the martial arts. From the positive awe manifested by our nippomaniacs in their approach to these topics one might well suppose that they were sacrosanct. I get a surfeit of this lunacy from Plée, especially in the sections of his bimonthly devoted to the would-be philosophical and psychological aspects of judo and the martial arts. Thus whenever mention is made of THE WAY, that mystic word is always given in capital letters (LA VOIE in French). For my sins Im doomed to translate this piffle into English.\n\nPerhaps one of my worst inflictions is the task of wrestling with the text of that imbecile novel entitled Sugata Sanshiro. It began at least two years ago and bids fair to outlive me. Ive just got off something like ten thousand words of this coagulated crap redolent with references to THE WAY. Heres one sample gem for your private collection.\n\nThe hero Sugata Sanshiro is replying to the beauteous Takako who wants to know what he hopes to get from judo. \"Im trying to understand the principle of the earthly and heavenly law, the Way of Truth, mademoiselle.\"\n\nAnd what about this cryptic utterance? \"The fact of accepting the combat which will decide life or death while making float the immutable imperturbability of the mind at the mercy of the current of life permits alone the advent of true strength.\"\n\nDid you ever read such pretentious twaddle?\n\nPerhaps Ive mentioned in a previous letter that in the revised Fighting Spirit Ive deemed it my duty to do quite a bit of debunking of this growing craze. Doubtless future readers badly infected with the virus of twaddle will denounce me from the housetops as a backsliding heretic but I hardly think that their yells and cellar-flaps will disturb my sleep at night. I owe my beloved Lithuanians a bloody sight more than budo, bushido, bujutsu, and the rest.\n\nThe grim joke is that several members of the juvenile generation have begun to visit me in quest of guidance in judo! If I let them theyd hang on for hours and hours and Im simply obliged to ration them.\n\nSeeing that you too enjoy other intellectual interests than judo I have to report that I returned a few days ago from a special mission to Bradford, Yorkshire. I represented the Lithuanian Association in Great Britain, of which I am an Honorary Member, at a huge meeting convened to solemnise the fifteenth anniversary of one of the foulest crimes ever recorded in our sinful history  the mass deportations in early June 1940 by the Soviet Secret Police, the NKVD, of at least 100,000 Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians of both sexes and of all ages, including infants in arms, to slave labour camps in Siberia and elsewhere in the Soviet Union. I had to speak shortly in Lithuanian and at greater length in English. This was rather an onerous task at my age but I did my best and I hope not in vain.\n\nI vastly enjoyed the stupendous hospitality of the Lithuanians in that city. It has to be experienced to be believed. We are sending strong resolutions to the heads of the Western Governments briefed to attend those \"summit\" bleatings at Geneva next month. In them, we emphasised the dangerous and amoral fallacy of \"peaceful co-existence\" with the monolithic thugs and gangsters of the Communist world. Not that these protests will have any practical effect  in my view at any rate. Nonetheless its imperative that we place ourselves on record. Meanwhile a complete conspiracy of silence broods over our precious home press and Parliament as far as the tragic fate of those forgotten millions is concerned.\n\n(Sep. 2, 1955)\n\nI am pleased to hear your favourable report on Ishikawa, whose name and fame originally percolated through to me via Malcolm Gregory, whose chief instructor he was during Gregs judo training in Dai Nippon. Greg even lived with him for quite awhile before his departure. So soon after his arrival in California Ishikawa looked Greg up at the Los Angeles Athletic Club, and tried hard to persuade Greg to accompany him on a judo tour of the States and South America. Personally Im not at all surprised that Greg wouldnt yield to Ishikawas blandishments, having become far too closely attached to his local surroundings and its numerous material and cultural amenities. In many ways Gregory has outgrown the Japanese chapter of his personal odyssey and although he must still rely upon his judo qualifications for a livelihood he now prefers to devote most of his leisure to omnivorous reading and the further cultivation of his quite exceptional musical tastes. Like myself he has become bored to the verge of tears by the almost non-stop preposterous claims advanced by well-meaning but undiscriminating enthusiasts seeking to interpret judo not only as the most wonderful and ethical sport in the world but also as a unique philosophy, obedience to whose basic principles must sooner or later transform its disciples into something not far removed from the status of a superman. As doubtless you yourself have noticed such claims are closely associated with the concept of the MICHI (invariably printed in capital letters) which the disciple is adjured to follow if he sincerely wishes to join the serried ranks of the elect. In California, poor Gregory has been subjected to such a surfeit of this brand of piffle that he found even Ishikawas presence and conversation somewhat tiresome.\n\nKenshiro Abe has recently created a system called EN-SHIN-DO \"with a valid ethical-philosophic-practical base\". DO is of course the Sinico-Japanese reading of the pure Japanese form michi, but without the other kanji its hard to say what EN-SHIN means. The only two readings of the form given in my dictionary are \"centrifugal\" and \"the centre of a circle\". In any case Im hardly so credulous as to take the new system seriously.\n\nI havent so far met him in the flesh, but from a young correspondent whom I rate as one of the most intelligent, courteous, and appreciative of any, Lowe by name, not yet eighteen years old, I learn that he cut a rather poor figure as an instructor at the recent judo summer school. He went on the mat without donning complete judogi, and Lowe tells me that most of his throws were counters, and that his demonstrations of uchikomi were nothing like so satisfactory as those of I. Morris, a Budokwai 2nd Dan of long standing. Ichiro Abe, a 6th Dan living in Belgium, is personally known to me and is assuredly a first-rate performer on the mat. He must be considerably younger than K. Abe. Of course without seeing K. Abe at work it would not be fair for me to cite Lowes opinion as conclusive.\n\nThe Fighting Spirit is to appear in October. Belasco has devised quite a striking jacket for it but the fate of the revised version will depend upon its contents. Experts will doubtless detect shortcomings and deplore omissions, but with the data at my disposal I did the best I could. I am prepared to accept the verdict of my future readers in a philosophical spirit which has nothing to do with the overworked MICHI!\n\nSorry to say that the Harrisonai are just now passing through a decidedly nasty patch. A lot of dry rot has come to light in this guesthouse of ours upon which we rely for our livelihood, and the prospective cost of getting rid of it and making the blasted residence \"weather-worthy\" (or shall we say watertight?) may very well land us in the red seeing that our sterling resources are wholly inadequate to defray it. Belasco has been more than kind in letting me have an advance on my future royalties well ahead of the due date, but the amount in question is much too small to meet the bill. I plan to approach two organisations of which I am a life member, viz., the British Legion and the Newspaper Press Fund, for additional aid but I cannot be certain that they will stump up more than a negligible proportion of the grand total. I should say that nowhere else in the so-called civilised world is the ownership of house property (we are merely leaseholders) fraught with such onerous responsibilities and overhead charges as in our jocund Welfare State. Then, too, my wife has just undergone a minor operation and isnt feeling any too well in consequence. Verily it never rains but it pours.\n\n(Oct. 10, 1955)\n\nThe revised edition of The Fighting Spirit of Japan came out today. I havent yet had my complementary copies but by the merest chance a friend somehow got hold of an advance copy which I inspected yesterday. Speaking quite objectively I feel bound to say that as regards paper, binding, and to a lesser degree printing it isnt a patch on the original edition published by the late Fisher Unwin at half the price. Also it contains only 250 pages as against 350 in the Unwin edition. In this connexion it has to be noted that whereas in the Unwin edition there are only about 31 or 32 lines to the page, in the Foulsham edition there are 42 and of course many more words to the line as a result of the far narrower margin. Nevertheless judged by present-day standards both paper and typography will doubtless rank as first-class.\n\nThe jacket to this new edition is certainly effective with a samurai depicted in full war panoply as the centrepiece. Of course when the Unwin edition came out such vulgarities were unknown but today they are almost universal. Unfortunately some smart Alec whose identity is unknown to me took it upon himself to add an extra blurb entirely without my knowledge just underneath the picture. I dont suppose the average reader will detect the confusion of epitaphs of which it is guilty but Ill bet my bottom dollar that you will! Again, some other if not the same idiot has had the colossal nerve to monkey with my new preface. Not only has what I considered an effective turn of phrase been excised, but also he has substituted for my finale one of his own that culminates in a fatuous non sequitur. These changes have been made after I had corrected and returned the proofs. Can you imagine such discourtesy?\n\nBelasco himself was unaware of the imbecile addition to the jacket blurbs and may even be ignorant of this further tampering with my text. He has all along been so decent in his treatment of me that Im loath to cause any friction but shall certainly lodge a polite protest after receipt of my complimentary copies. But there was one other occasion when I had to put my flat foot down. Believe it or not, they were planning to publish my colossal Aida translation and amplification without my name as translator and editor! I raised such a rumpus that they dropped this monstrous plan like a red-hot potato and now everything in the garden is lovely. Actually Im dealing with the proofs at my leisure because publication will not take place earlier than May or June next year. This work runs to more than 280 pages without the index which I have yet to compile  a hell of a job as doubtless you know. I suppose my Peace or War index is the most ambitious effort of my long and misspent life.\n\nIn your letter you mention Kawaishis Self Defence. I take it that this is the French edition? As coincidence will have it, Gailhat, the versatile yudansha and artist, has sent me a complimentary copy of this terrific work with his friendly greetings but no other comment. I at once notified Belasco and he asked me to pass it on to him, which I have done. So the chances are that he will take the necessary steps to obtain Kawaishis permission for an English rendering by me. This may prove a longer and rather more difficult job than the translation of his Judo Method. Whether or not Belasco will commission me to write the story of my life will largely depend upon the success or otherwise of the new Fighting Spirit. So nous verrons. In any case I opine that a translation of Kawaishis Self Defence would have to be given priority.\n\nI saw Geoffrey Gleeson not long ago at the Budokwai. He certainly looked in the pink. Hes a busy man seeing that in the daytime hes studying Japanese at the Oriental College for his final diploma and in the evenings is teaching at the Budokwai. Everybody there was very friendly, and the leaflets of my various books as also the flamboyant jacket of The Fighting Spirit are being prominently displayed on the clubs notice board.\n\nPoor Trevor Leggett is recovering from an attack of jaundice and looked much the worse for wear. His newly grown beard is flecked with grey and that made him look far older than his actual age.\n\nI havent heard from Greg in well over a month. After disposing of this screed I propose to write one to him to find out if all is well with him. In our fortuitous age one never can tell what may befall us from day to day or even hour to hour.\n\n(Jan. 29, 1956)\n\nThe impact of that dry rot horror I reported in a recent letter has all but landed our alarmingly diminishing bank account in the red. Prate as the Confucian \"superior person\" may about the power of the human mind to alleviate mundane worries, actual experience of our current brand of corrosive financial difficulties suffices to give the lie to what I greatly fear our mutual friend Greg would brutally (or shall I say \"emblematically\"?) define as \"bullshit\".\n\nIt is indeed lucky for me that before this calamity befell us I had already completed my revision of The Fighting Spirit of Japan and that even more exacting job of translating the Aida book on judo. Had either or both of them coincided with the appalling upheaval occasioned by these structural alterations and the presence of two builders \"from morn till dewy eve\" for months on end, concentration on those exacting commissions would have been well nigh impossible. Now at least we know the words and have the house more or less to ourselves.\n\nIn the wake of those alarums and excursions a lull has set in on the home front. In some ways it is none too welcome since it means less revenue for the Harrisonai. Apart from a few odds and ends of Lithuanian translation, revision of English articles for a Baltic quarterly called East and West at Grub Street rates, and literally occasional shillings for Polish translations which I undertake in collaboration with a Polish colleague, no filthy lucre to speak of has accrued to us from the outside for some months now.\n\nBelasco is awaiting Kawaishis consent to my doing a curtailed translation of his My Method of Self Defence. Nothing definite yet has been decided under this head.\n\nAs regards The Fighting Spirit of Japan, it is true that although several highly favourable reviews have appeared in the provincial (but not the metropolitan) press, sales are lagging, not more at the moment than about 800 copies. Personally Im convinced that Belasco was most ill-advised to fix the retail price at 25 shillings instead of, say 21. Now when it is too late perhaps he has arrived at the same conclusion!\n\nIn the purely personal sphere my most interesting item of news is my \"promotion\" to the grade of 4th Dan. This \"honour\" was conferred upon me on January 7, 1956. The occasion was the Japanese Ambassadors ceremonial opening of the Budokwai Dojo for the year. I hadnt beforehand quite made up my mind whether or not to attend the ceremony but a few days before the appointed date Gunji Koizumi rang me up and expressed the hope that I would turn up which I promised to do. The Dojo was pretty well filled but with enough mat space left for the afternoons programme to be staged. I had no inkling whatsoever of what was in the wind and was really startled when Koizumi from the ambassadorial dais called out my name and asked me to approach. When I did so he announced that in recognition of my \"services to judo\" the grading committee had decided to award me the 4th Dan (to be confirmed in due course by the Kodokan). The new black belt signifying the promotion was then handed to me by the Japanese Ambassador who shook hands with me and congratulated me on my preferment. All that was left to me was to make one of my best courtly bows and briefly to express my thanks for this \"honour\".\n\nThe judo programme was in the hands of Gleeson, Palmer, Leggett, and some others with Koizumi looking on from his seat next to the Ambassador. All he did was some randori with a kid in his teens. Both Gleeson and Palmer greatly impressed me. Palmer, now about 23 or 24, I think, has returned from Japan a 4th Dan, like Gleeson, but enormously more muscular and heavier than when he left these shores three years ago. Although not more, Id say, then five feet nine or so in height he scales more than 14 stone (about 196 pounds avoirdupois), with atlantean shoulders and massive thighs and calves. He wears an 18-inch collar. Both he and Gleeson experienced no difficulty in throwing one after the other in quick succession the members of the customary two-team contest that wound up the proceedings; this meant some fourteen or fifteen opponents for each of them.\n\nI have a hunch, old man, that you wont be surprised to hear that this belated and by no means over-generous award of 4th Dan leaves me cold. At this late date I could have cheerfully dispensed with it \"for the duration\", when, as the poet says, \"the grave doth gape and doting death is near. Therefore exhale!\"\n\nRather significantly some weeks earlier when I first met Charley Palmer at the Budokwai shortly after his return from Japan, he informed me in strict confidence that the Kodokan powers-that-be had sounded him before his departure on the subject of my promotion and had asked him to ascertain my views on it. I then told Palmer that while I had no desire to be promoted by the Budokwai I should certainly appreciate a higher Dan conferred by my old Alma Mater. Of course no particular Dan was ever mentioned but I was virtually sure that after all these years it would not have been lower than a 5th. But now of course whether wittingly or unwittingly Koizumi has forestalled any move from that quarter and so I must be content to bear my blushing honours thick upon me until the inevitable hour.\n\nMaking the best of a bad job, however, I have notified Belasco of this development. He has already made arrangements to have \"4th Dan\" substituted for \"3rd Dan\" on the title page of the Aida book, publication of which is scheduled for May or thereabouts. Presumably future editions (if any) of my other books will be similarly amended. So much for this egotistical interlude.\n\nI must correct your erroneous impression that Kenshiro Abe, 7th Dan, is attached to the Budokwai. Actually he is the prize packet of the London Judo Society, which after the Budokwai is the largest and best-equipped dojo in Great Britain. Some idea of his grotesque mentality can be deduced from a photograph of himself that he has widely circulated in these confines since his arrival in the UK. In this print he is shown clad in an ill-fitting boiler suit, his scanty locks unkempt, and holding in his left hand a huge card on which in his own handwriting is featured the following cryptic message to a wondering world all agog to receive this unique revelation: \"Judo is a way of life. We must to select No. 1 of way of life of human being. Judo lesson alway necessary gentle and softness of moving. I think sure No. 1 of life there are in circular movement as sun center and many star moveing all way. Judo best of strength is throu use strength of contestants.\" So now, dear boy, you know!\n\nDoubtless you will have read in the Budokwai Bulletin Koizumis report of Abes decidedly eccentric behaviour at the Bisham Abbey summer school. There he distinguished himself by dishing out Dan grades to all and sundry (in a Pickwickian sense), and more than once was seen to be \"off-balance\" on the mat under the impact of \"hot and rebellious liquors\" in his blood. Of course having got him Eric Dominy and George Chew must make the best of him. Be careful not to confuse K. Abe, 7th Dan, with Ichiro Abe, 6th Dan, of Belgium. The latter is a much younger man, a handsome Japanese, and from the little I have seen of him in action at the Albert Hall a splendid performer.\n\nPerhaps inevitably at my time of life some of the resilience of my erstwhile interest in the \"gentle way\" has oozed out of my cerebellum, and give way to my preoccupation with the life and death struggle with those foul and foetid foes of \"civilised\" mankind, the Communists. In particular I am concerned with the tragic lot of the Lithuanians and the other two Baltic peoples. The comparative ease with which these Kremlin thugs and sub-humans can almost at will bamboozle quite a big section of the inhabitants of these isles is simply staggering and must be seen on the spot to be believed. We refuse to be insulted and the more verbal kicks Messrs. Bulganin and Kruschchev land on one cheek of our silly backsides the more eagerly we proffer the other cheek for similar treatment. Its an old English custom, methinks. And when, as now seems fairly certain, those two bloodstained malefactors visit us in April the cups of tea they will be called upon to quaff and the addresses of welcome theyll have to acknowledge may well baffle computation. \"Whom the gods wish to destroy,\" etc. At the present rate we are losing the Cold War upon almost all fronts. In the absence of any coherent, well-thought out plan we are reduced to the pitiful role of \"semi-despondent furies\" rushing madly hither and thither from one spot to another on the periphery or perimeter trying to extinguish local conflagrations kindled by Soviet agents and hirelings. What a game! And the end is not yet, not by a long chalk. Nor do I opine that I am destined to witness it.\n\nHowever, in the interim I am not insensible to the appeal of judo as a kind of escapism. And while Greg was here life for me wasnt devoid of zest. His departure has left me without a single congenial male friend to take his place. But in his absence I find Charley Palmer a very fine lad indeed. We had him over the other day for tea in connexion with my need for some information on the cost of living in Japan and other details required by one of my fans, a young fellow named Hart, at present working in Kenya but desperately eager to get to Japan to prosecute his judo studies to the point of a black belt. He is only a Budokwai 3rd Kyu. Palmer very kindly furnished me with the necessary information for transmission to Hart.\n\nPalmer is obviously a youth of good breeding. His physical presence is, as already intimated, most impressive. Outside the Budokwai he is teaching judo at the rate of a pound per hour and is evidently doing very well along those lines. I think he really enjoyed his visit and certainly did ample justice to the tea and cake served up by my wife! She too shared my liking for the braw laddie. He is going to buy a copy of The Fighting Spirit and then get me to autograph it. He made excellent use of his stay in Dai Nippon and now speaks and reads Japanese with facility. Gleeson ditto.\n\nGreg wrote some time ago that he was contemplating matrimony but has since  wisely in my opinion  abandoned the idea. He plans shortly to embark upon a further stage of his earthly Odyssey, perhaps to revisit Japan and then carry on to other fields and pastures new. He is leading a very full and colourful life, both physical and intellectual, reading omnivorously and listening to the best classical music, his love of which he shares with us. One should avoid the one-track mind. Dont you agree?\n\n(Oct. 29, 1956)\n\nOur mutual friend John Wilson of Chicago has again taken up the threads of our correspondence. I must say that his letters reflect an attractive and virile personality while his photograph taken while in the act of demonstrating a hadakajime on one of his victims reveals him to be a good-looking fellow. He is evidently leading the kind of life he loves as a judo instructor and teacher too of bayonet fighting in the Marine Reserves. His last letter to me contained a generous and really eloquent tribute to my modest services in the cause of judo, i.e., the printed word. I must confess that as I read this appreciation I felt moved almost to the point of \"piping the lachrymal glands\". I shall certainly file his missive among the family archives.\n\nHe asked me in his letter, as a personal favour, to write a letter to his friend Al Holtmann of the Southern California School of Judo and Jujutsu. He stocks most of books and has told John that already he has sold upwards of 2,000 of them. I lost no time in complying with Johns request and hope that my letter was to Holtmanns liking!\n\nJohn also tells me that he was recently in California. During his tour he visited Los Angeles but unfortunately was not then aware of Gregorys address at the Los Angeles Athletic Club and so failed to meet him. But he quotes at some length your feeling description of Gregs prowess in groundwork, more especially that he resembled on octopus on the mat with what seemed like four arms and four legs, and that when he done toying with you there wasnt a moving part in your body. You werent just pinned, you were nailed to the tatami! Naturally I shall quote this part of Johns letter in my next letter to Greg together with his tribute to myself. I know quite well beforehand that Greg will lap up both excerpts with avidity.\n\nYou may be mildly interested to hear that a new quarterly judo journal has now made its appearance. It is published by Judo Limited, 91 Wellesley Road, Croydon, Surrey. Editors G. A. Edwards and A. R. Menzies, Technical Adviser, T. P. Leggett. In their prospectus they feature as prospective collaborators Koizumi, Harrison, and Leggett in that order and plan to include me as a leading judo \"personality\" in the wake of GK [Gunji Koizumi, founder of the Budokwai].\n\nThe initial issue contains some excellent material, notably an article on basic principles of judo by Leggett. P. S. Porter [Ed.: e.g., Phil Porter], Captain USAF, writes on judo in the USA, Richard Bowen on judo organisation in Tokyo, and Leggett again on contest glimpses. Some 47 pages in all. Ive taken out a years subscription as a friendly gesture. If later I can think of something to write about I shall try to oblige them but can no longer, I fear, hope to keep pace with budding writers of the younger generation who enjoy the advantage of deriving their knowledge, both empirical and theoretical, from practice and observation on the good old mat. Still, figuring in the role of purveyor of the knowledge of others, I have just completed the typing of my latest translation, Kawaishis Les Katas Complets de Judo. This little job has taken me all of two months, averaging perhaps six hours a day. Including the illustrations by Gailhat my script totals 280 or more pages. Belasco has promised me £100 and I am now awaiting a telephone message appointing a date for my delivery of the goods and, I devoutly hope, collection of my \"renoomeration\", as a famous town councillor of the old Vancouver was wont to say. I still have to correct the proofs of my condensed version of Kawaishis other work, My Method of Self Defence, for which too I have to make an index.\n\nI wonder whether you agree with me that Gailhats drawings are often more than a little crude and lacking in clarity? Nevertheless on the whole Kawaishis description of the seven katas will prove a valuable addition to the judo bibliography.\n\nGreg sent me rather a vague account of his experiences in Cuba with Ishikawa. He said that Ishikawa seemed to have aged appreciably since their last meeting and most of the time was morose and taciturn. Also his waza lacked its whilom dynamism. Meanwhile Greg continues to be absorbed in omnivorous reading, and writing. All in all a very happy man.\n\n(Feb. 20, 1956)\n\nIt may interest you to hear that Belasco has commissioned me to grind out a drastically curtailed English version of Kawaishis Ma Méthodé de Self-Défense, a sort of companion volume to his My Method of Judo with which I have already dealt. The original French text runs to over 380 pages but His Nibs wants me to reduce this tome to little more than 96 pages (sides)! This means that allowing one side for the illustration itself only about 50 sides at the very outside would be left for the letterpress. And yet he wants to sell such a book for at least 9 shillings 6 pence, and probably 12 shillings 6 pence! My Manual, approximately double the size, sells at 9 shillings 6 pence. Where is the sense of proportion in such planning?\n\nAnyhow, I have devoted more than a weekend to a very careful examination of the text and have reached the conclusion that he will be a veritable Peter Schlemihl if he refuses to expand the translation considerably and insists upon adherence to his first intention. I have written to him in this sense but of course far more discreetly because as the result of my examination of the text I am convinced that a more generous version would appeal to a wide circle of aspiring judoka. Kawaishis final section of atemi alone runs to about 93 pages and in my opinion his exposition of this all-important branch of the art is the best. Certainly it is the most comprehensive and lavishly illustrated of any known to me, at any rate in any European language.\n\nSome of Kawaishis techniques are positively fiendish and would be a veritable godsend (?) to every self-respecting thug and plug-ugly conversant with the English language! And now that our sloppy parliamentary idealists have decreed the abolition of capital punishment these paladins of the underworld will be fairly clamouring for knowledge of just this kind to enable them to cope more effectively with our upholders of law and order. Few things better calculated to encourage knowledge of this kind among our enterprising criminal classes could be conceived than our abolition of the death penalty. Personally I am strongly in favour of getting rid of our truly barbarous method of hanging and also for restricting execution to those guilty of the foulest kinds of premeditated murder. I would, however, extend some other less ghoulish type of elimination to persons guilty of cruelty to both children and animals and could I have my way Id cheerfully include most vivisectionists and votaries of our atrocious blood sports! But what a hope!\n\nAnyway, I must now await Belascos final ruling on the book. The non-atemi part of the book contains many traumatic counters not found in any other work that I know of. For his original scheme Belasco was willing to pay me only £50 but with the proviso that for every new edition he would add £20. Not what youd call a princely remuneration but then beggars cannot be choosers.\n\nIf, as I feel sure you share with me the conviction that not even judo is the be-all and the end-all of life, then you are probably interested in this truly dastardly visit in April of those two bloodstained malefactors \"Bulge\" and \"Krush\". [EN2] I stand aghast at the poltroonery masquerading as \"statesmanship\" responsible for this descensus Averni or more mildly the monolithic imbecility of [Prime Minister Anthony] Eden & Co. With the monstrous decision to require the Queen to receive those ruffians and to smile sweetly upon them we would appear to have reached the nadir of national abasement. If only the queen had the moral guts to refuse emphatically to sully her hands with this unsavoury and malodorous greeting! Let us however hope that the instant those bastards cease to pollute the atmosphere with their foul presence she will rush to the nearest available toilet and there disinfect her hands with the strongest possible solution. Active steps are now being taken to organize mass protests against this visit and to demonstrate publicly when B and K appear in public  if they do. We Harrisonai are signing a petition to Parliament on this score on behalf of the Balts and other enslaved peoples. To all intents and purposes our press has gagged unofficial correspondence on the subject, and two of my own letters have been merely acknowledged but not printed.\n\n(Apr. 25, 1956)\n\nWhen I read your remark that my Ground was being published in the United States by Sterling Publishers I got quite a jolt. Under the terms of my agreements with Foulshams, in the event of any of my books being published in the USA I am entitled to 50 percent of the proceeds. Therefore I lost no time in getting in touch with the braw Belasco, who was equally prompt in letting me know that the work in question is not being published but merely handled by the firm you mention. He assured me that if and when any American publisher brought out a purely American edition of any of my books Foulshams would not fail to honour their agreement with me.\n\nSince we last exchanged letters Belascos only son Ronald has gone back to New York. There he should long ere this have arranged with some reputable New York house to handle my revised Fighting Spirit of Japan. In this context I may report that the revised version has had some quite complimentary notices in the home press but not yet in any leading metropolitan rag. The Glasgow Herald, an important provincial daily, gave it much more than a column. Of course, from the outset we have not been banking on big sales but rather on a steadily growing demand for the book in both hemispheres. In my opinion the retail price of 25 shillings for a book of 250 pages or some 85,000 words is a bit steep but Belasco tells me emphatically that on the basis of rising costs even after the lapse of only a few months since its publication he couldnt afford to publish it at less than 30 shillings! However, when these figures are converted into your high-grade currency the retail price on your side will be only a bagatelle. So we must possess our alleged souls in patience and abide the issue. I must confess that I was sorry to have to scrap so much of the original material, but Belasco was insistent and needs must, etc.\n\nMy translation (with additions) of Hikoichi Aidas important book, which we have entitled Kodokan Judo, has seen the li"
