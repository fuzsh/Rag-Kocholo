Everyone is super friendly, welcoming, and are very happy to take the time to help beginners and cater to all skill and fitness levels. The atmosphere is one of respect, compassion, hard work, and friendly humor.\n\nThey've really helped my cousin build her confidence, and her skills and strength have improved exponentially in a short period of time. They have you work on different techniques against several partners in each lesson, so there's never a shortage of variation and action. There is also no shortage of passionate and knowledgeable people with whom to connect, learn, and practice.\n\nSeeing my cousin's experience there, her deep love for it and her happiness with herself, I highly recommend this dojo to anyone interested in taking up Aikido or any traditional martial arts.\n\nRead more\n\nEdward Baker\n\n★★★★★\n\nRead More\n\nI've had the distinct opportunity to know Instructor Glenn Brooks both personally and professionally for over 15 years.\n\nWhen called-upon, Glenn has provided 'Personal Protection' and 'Personal Affairs Management' for my VIP Clients, some of whom are recognized as international icons in their field...\n\nAdditionally, in my work with the 'US Department of Defense (DOD)' I've enlisted Glenn's team at AoS to prepare me personally in the area of martial arts for tactical operations in hostile zones throughout the world.\n\nPersonally, Glenn has become a true friend and mentor of which I cannot imagine facing any situation, personal or professional, without him at my side.\n\nOnward, Upward, Always, Together with Glenn Brooks and Aikido of Scottsdale!\n\nRead more\n\nGreg Talcott\n\n★★★★★\n\nRead More\n\nCome and see a class for yourself what a special place this really is.
