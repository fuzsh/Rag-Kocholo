        "text": "I dont do Kajukenbo. However, John Bishop, whos page I took this from, is a member here. I'll defer any Kaju related questions to him.\n\nI went to college with Professor Peter Choo's son (also named Peter) as well as Kevin Funakoshi (son of Sensei Kenneth Funakoshi, one of the first Kajukenbo black belts). We used to play cards at lunch everyday. Then one day an article about Sijo Emperado came out in Inside Kung Fu I think. I mentioned that article, and they started ripping in about all of the inaccuracies. I later met the co-founders through Peter and also Professor Walter Godin and they confirmed what Peter and Kevin were saying that day. Professor Frank Ordonez for example, has never heard of Sekeino Jujutsu and therefore never studied that. He told me directly that he studied Kodenkan Jujitsu at the Kaheka Lane dojo under Professor Sam Luke. If you have any information on that art, please let me know and I will be sure to pass it on to him. Professor Choo said that he was a boxer in the US Army and studied Kodenkan Jujitsu with Professor Luke and Kenpo Karate with Professor Thomas Young, who taught a class out of the Kaheka Lane Kodenkan dojo. Professor Choo said he never studied Tang Soo Do, but did study taekwondo in the 1960s when he was stationed in Korea. He was also a big Aikido fan and studied that when he was stationed in Japan, again in the 60s. When they created the Black Belt Society, they said it was an inside joke because they were all white belts at the time, except for Professor Holck. Even Sijo Emperado was a white belt at the time, studying with Professor Chow. In fact, there is a very beautiful portrait of Sijo in his white uniform and white belt that Professor Ordonez has. Professor Holck is half japanese and had a japanese last name, but they changed it to his mother's maiden name after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. They were all friends from Farrington High School, except for Professor Holck, I think grew up in Kailua. He came in the group because he was the cousin of Professor Choo's wife.\n\nI believe Professor Bishop knows all of this and more, but for his own reasons has that other information on his webpage. Not for me to judge or criticize him for what he does or doesn't do. Kajukenbo is a rich and very interesting art for me, which I never studied. But I did grow up very close to both the Palama Settlement and Nuuanu YMCA as well as the original Queen Emma Street dojo of Professor Mitose, about one mile down the Pali Highway from all of that, in Puunui.\n\nBut finding out about kajukenbo's history through the co-founders themselves was my motivation to study korean martial arts history by seeking out the founders and hearing it from their own mouths and showing me using their own photo albums and documents. So I am grateful to kajukenbo and the co-founders for steering me on the path that I follow to this day. In that way, I guess I did learn from them the key concept of getting it from the horse's mouth.\n\nLOL...fire away. Trust me sir, I doubt you'll offend me. Why? Because I myself, have questioned things many times, and I'm more than sure I've pissed off my fair share of Kenpoists, but thats fine. I have my views, they have theirs. If they dont agree with mine, I could care less....I'm more than happy with my thoughts on the art. Anyways, I'd be happy to hear what you have to say.\n\nWell, as I said, my uncle was a long time member of the Nuuanu YMCA, which was right down the road from our houses (we lived next door to each other). He trained with Professor Chow during the 50's and introduced Professor Chow to his wife Patsy. So Professor Chow was very grateful to my uncle. Professor Chow and his wife would always visit my uncle's house for dinner and try and get us kids to train with him. But frankly, when we were kids, Professor Chow looked kind of scary, so we weren't so interested. Besides, we were taking other martial arts as well. But anyway, when the subject of GM Ed Parker came up, it always came out that he trained very very little with Professor Chow. I think he trained a little with Professor Chow before he moved to Utah for college, was on his mormon mission and then the coast guard. So he was hardly around. I think they said that EP made it officially to blue belt under Professor Chow. In the photos that GM Parker has in his infinite insights volume 1, GM Parker is wearing his blue belt in that photo. My uncle is in the first row on the left with the widow's peak forehead. I heard that Professor Chow, after much begging, allowed GM Parker to wear a black belt on the mainland, because he had a club going in Utah at school. When he moved to Los Angeles, GM Parker did keep in touch with Professor Chow through correspondence and sent some small money to Professor Chow every now and then. Professor Chow had letters from GM Parker saved from the 50s and 60s, pleading poverty because of this or that. Those letters were stuck in between issues of old Black Belt magazines that Professor Chow had saved in beer boxes in his garage, covered with canvas. I would say Professor Chow had a love hate relationship with GM Parker, more hate than love. I think Professor Chow resented GM Parker for what he felt was using his name to legitimize what he was doing, which Professor Chow felt had almost nothing to do with his art. Professor Chow said that GM Parker's style was mostly some \"chop suey\" combination of kung fu that he learned when he moved to Los Angeles, and that the only thing that was his was the name. When Professor Chow passed away, GM Parker did show up to the funeral crying, so there is that. I think it was a complicated love hate relationship.\n\nI went to college with Professor Peter Choo's son (also named Peter) as well as Kevin Funakoshi (son of Sensei Kenneth Funakoshi, one of the first Kajukenbo black belts). We used to play cards at lunch everyday. Then one day an article about Sijo Emperado came out in Inside Kung Fu I think.

So I am grateful to kajukenbo and the co-founders for steering me on the path that I follow to this day. In that way, I guess I did learn from them the key concept of getting it from the horse's mouth.\n\nI agree with probably 80% of what you have written. Over the last 60+ years there have been a number of inaccuracies concerning the history of Kajukenbo that have been handed down from generation to generation.\n\nAs stories get told over and over, some things get changed, exaggerated, left out, forgotten, or added in. Most are just minor honest mistakes and misunderstandings. Some were innocent exaggerations to make the Kajukenbo legend seem bigger then it really was. And a few were exaggerations to make a individual's legend bigger then it really was. Often times by others after that person had passed. And a very few were just plain malicious lies.\n\nIn researching my first book, and several magazine articles over the years, I spent a lot of one on one time discussing Kajukenbo history with Sijo Emperado. In person, and in letters and phone calls. In the last years of his life, he was spending several months a year in Hawaii visiting friends and relatives. So a lot of my last discussions with Sijo were by letters. Because I was writing a book that would take a long time to compile, I started attaching questionnaires to my letters, so my questions were clear, and Sijo could easily answer them in his own words. These questionnaires also provided me a record of history written in Sijo's own hand.\n\nIn addition, I have 4 video taped interviews of Sijo. Two of those interviews also include one or 2 of the other founders. Sijo did 3 in the 1980's. One for Panther Productions. Another with Sijo, Peter Choo, and Joe Holck in Hawaii. And another with Sijo, and Joe Holck in Arizona. Also, in the 1990's, there's the one I personally did with Sijo.\n\nFrom interviews and statements from Sijo, Peter Choo, and Joe Holck, here are their answers on the following topics.\n\nThe \"karate\" in Kajukenbo is Tang Soo Do.\n\nYes and no. Peter Choo said that he had some training from his father in Korean martial arts. This was prior to the official founding of Tang Soo Do in 1945. Many say Tang Soo Do is just renamed Shotokan, since Korea was a Japanese Colony from around 1905-1945. In reality many Korean martial arts were combined with other arts, refined, and renamed. Tang Soo Do-So Bak Do was a early name used by several Korean Kwans. It is unknown if the Korean art Peter Choo had learned from his father was one of the one's that was later united under the \"Tang Soo Do\" banner.\n\nI asked Sijo how Peter Choo could be a tang soo do practitioner, since Tang Soo Do was not founded until 1945. His response was: \"Peter Choo knew Korean karate, everybody called Korean karate Tang Soo Do.\" Which makes sense, since Tang Soo Do had been the official name for the Korean striking and kicking arts at the time. The names \"Tae Kwon Do\", \"Hapkido\", \"Kuk Soo Won\" were not commonly used until the 60's.\n\nThe five founders (Black Belt Society) of Kajukenbo were black belts.\n\nDuring the time of 1947 thru 1949, the only founders who were black belts were Sijo in Kenpo, and Joe Holck in Danzan Ryu Jujitsu.\n\nAround 1952, Joe Holck also received his black belt in Kodokan Judo.\n\nGeorge Chang had some kung fu training, but kung fu did not have belt ranks at the time. And from some accounts, George Chang did not continue with martial arts training after the Korean War.\n\nPeter Choo had some Korean martial arts training as a child from his father. He was also a proficient boxer, and had some training in both Kenpo, and Danzan Ryu jujitsu. After the Korean War, Choo was stationed in Korea, Okinawa, and Japan during his military career. He continued with his martial arts training, and earned black belts in Aikido, Tae Kwon Do, and Shorinji Ryu Karate. His aikido black belt came from Koichi Tohei, and his Tae Kwon Do (Tang Soo Do at the time) black belt came from Joon Rhee.\n\nFrank Ordonez had some training in Kodokan Judo, Danzan Ryu jujitsu, and Kenpo, at the time of the founding of Kajukenbo.\n\nThey trained together everyday for 3 years.\n\nAt first for a while, but Sijo and Joe Holck said after that they trained \"whenever they could get together\". And sometimes not all of them were together. Four of them were still in the Army in 1947-48, so they weren't able to get together \"everyday\".\n\nThe main players on the mat were Emperado, Choo, and Holck. Ordonez and Chang participated some, but spent a lot of time recording the system and techniques in writing and photos.\n\nThe \"Bo\" in Kajukenbo was for Chinese Boxing (kung fu).\n\nYes and no. Four of the 5 founders (Emperado, Choo, Ordonez, Holck) were boxers (western boxing). The 5th founder was a kung fu stylist (Sil-lum Pai). Techniques from both Chinese Boxing and western Boxing found their way into Kajukenbo. But since martial arts were considered \"Asian\" at the time, the western boxing influence and escrima influence were not emphasized at the time.\n\nGeorge Chang was killed in the Korean War.\n\nIn 1950, the 5 founders were separated by military and work obligations. It was rumored that George Chang had been reported \"missing in action\" in the Korean War. The founders were geographically separated and not really in communication with each other for around 30 years. The only founder who had stayed with Kajukenbo from day one, was Emperado. Not hearing anything over the years about Chang, Emperado and others assumed that he had died in the war.\n\nThere was a lot of shocked people when Chang showed up at Peter Choo's funeral in 1997. After the war he returned to Hawaii, but never became involved in the martial arts again. He died for real in 2003.\n\nI agree with probably 80% of what you have written.\n\nThat's more than most people who were anxiously waiting for your reply was expecting. Sometimes people have to hear it from one of their own before they accept and believe something. Thanks for your response. Some questions and comments though.\n\nFrom interviews and statements from Sijo, Peter Choo, and Joe Holck, here are their answers on the following topics.\n\nHow come you didn't interview Professor Ordonez? To me, he is the original kajukenbo historian. I would think you would want to speak to him first.\n\nPeter Choo said that he had some training from his father in Korean martial arts. This was prior to the official founding of Tang Soo Do in 1945. Many say Tang Soo Do is just renamed Shotokan, since Korea was a Japanese Colony from around 1905-1945. In reality many Korean martial arts were combined with other arts, refined, and renamed. Tang Soo Do-So Bak Do was a early name used by several Korean Kwans. It is unknown if the Korean art Peter Choo had learned from his father was one of the one's that was later united under the \"Tang Soo Do\" banner. I asked Sijo how Peter Choo could be a tang soo do practitioner, since Tang Soo Do was not founded until 1945. His response was: \"Peter Choo knew Korean karate, everybody called Korean karate Tang Soo Do.\" Which makes sense, since Tang Soo Do had been the official name for the Korean striking and kicking arts at the time. The names \"Tae Kwon Do\", \"Hapkido\", \"Kuk Soo Won\" were not commonly used until the 60's.\n\nSome quick comments. Did Professor Choo specify what exactly his father taught him? It couldn't have been tang soo do because that term was not invented until 1944, when GM LEE Won Kuk created it. Also Peter Choo the first could not have taught his son Tang Soo Do, because he couldn't have learned Tangsoodo, or karate. As stated previously, Mr. Choo came on the first shipload of native Koreans to Hawaii in 1905, five years before the Japanese occupation started, in 1910. And everybody did not call korean karate \"Tang Soo Do\", because that term was not known in the west until 1956, when the first American, Master Dale Doulliard, began studying it at Yong San. Mr. Doullilard became the first American to receive a black belt in any korean martial art in 1957, when he received 1st Dan from the Tang Soo Do Moo Duk Kwan. Master Droullilard is alive and still lives in Michigan.\n\nGeorge Chang had some kung fu training, but kung fu did not have belt ranks at the time. And from some accounts, George Chang did not continue with martial arts training after the Korean War.\n\nI was told he had zero training and in any event, he did not participate at all in the creation of kajukenbo outside of photographing the techniques for the original manual. He was a photographer in the US Army. Therefore it is misleading to include him and siulumpai as the basis for \"bo\", especially since there were so many others who did american or western boxing, which did play a heavy role in the creation of kajukenbo techniques. Siulumpai did not come to Hawaii until 1962, through Master Buck Sam Kong. That was and still is the name of his organization, siulumpai. So that is probably where Sijo got the term siulumpai from, from Sifu Buck Sam Kong, who was maybe the most famous kung fu practitioner in hawaii back in the 60s and 70s.\n\nPeter Choo had some Korean martial arts training as a child from his father. He was also a proficient boxer, and had some training in both Kenpo, and Danzan Ryu jujitsu. After the Korean War, Choo was stationed in Korea, Okinawa, and Japan during his military career. He continued with his martial arts training, and earned black belts in Aikido, Tae Kwon Do, and Shorinji Ryu Karate. His aikido black belt came from Koichi Tohei, and his Tae Kwon Do (Tang Soo Do at the time) black belt came from Joon Rhee.\n\nProfessor Choo was NOT a black belt in Taekwondo, and did NOT study under GM Jhoon Rhee. In fact, Professor Choo showed me his taekwondo rank card, 1st guep (1st kyu in japanese) from a taekwondo kwan whose name I did not recognize. I remember the card was dated in the 1960s and Professor Choo said he received that when he was stationed in Korea.\n\nFrank Ordonez had some training in Kodokan Judo, Danzan Ryu jujitsu, and Kenpo, at the time of the founding of Kajukenbo.\n\nProfessor Ordonez said that he had some boxing training as well, but was not as accomplished at Professor Choo, who was the best boxer of the group.\n\nIn 1950, the 5 founders were separated by military and work obligations. It was rumored that George Chang had been reported \"missing in action\" in the Korean War. The founders were geographically separated and not really in communication with each other for around 30 years. The only founder who had stayed with Kajukenbo from day one, was Emperado. Not hearing anything over the years about Chang, Emperado and others assumed that he had died in the war. There was a lot of shocked people when Chang showed up at Peter Choo's funeral in 1997. After the war he returned to Hawaii, but never became involved in the martial arts again. He died for real in 2003.\n\nI attended Professor Choo's funeral and no one was in shock when Mr. Chang showed up. My understanding was the Professor Choo and Mr. Chang kept in touch over the years. Professor Choo's son told me that Mr. Chang was alive back when we were in college in the early 80s. Also, I have seen photos of Professors Choo and Ordonez wearing uniforms at the Palama Settlement school in the 60s for sure, so the statement about everyone losing touch for 30 years is incorrect.\n\nThat's more than most people who were anxiously waiting for your reply was expecting. Sometimes people have to hear it from one of their own before they accept and believe something. Thanks for your response. Some questions and comments though.\n\nHow come you didn't interview Professor Ordonez? To me, he is the original kajukenbo historian. I would think you would want to speak to him first.\n\nI wrote to him several times in the 80's early 90's (pre-internet), but he never returned any of my letters. I don't really know how much of a historian he could be, since he was not actively involved in Kajukenbo from around 1958 to the 90's. He may have visited people or communicated with people during that time, but he or any of the other founders (besides Emperado) did not have a active part in Kajukenbo after the 50's. You also have to remember that after 1960, most of the activity and seniors in Kajukenbo moved to the mainland.\n\nWhen my first book came out in 2006, he did write to me a couple times, and verified the information that I had written. One of his letters is in the 3rd edition.\n\nNow that Emperado has died, he has taken a more active role with his own organization.\n\nSome quick comments. Did Professor Choo specify what exactly his father taught him? It couldn't have been tang soo do because that term was not invented until 1944, when GM LEE Won Kuk created it. Also Peter Choo the first could not have taught his son Tang Soo Do, because he couldn't have learned Tangsoodo, or karate. As stated previously, Mr. Choo came on the first shipload of native Koreans to Hawaii in 1905, five years before the Japanese occupation started, in 1910. And everybody did not call korean karate \"Tang Soo Do\", because that term was not known in the west until 1956, when the first American, Master Dale Doulliard, began studying it at Yong San. Mr. Doullilard became the first American to receive a black belt in any korean martial art in 1957, when he received 1st Dan from the Tang Soo Do Moo Duk Kwan. Master Droullilard is alive and still lives in Michigan.\n\nLike I said, he did not train in Tang Soo Do prior to his military service in Korea. It was just Korean martial arts, and they used the name Tang Soo Do, for lack of a better description.\n\nI'm sure you know that many parts of the Asian culture arrived in Hawaii long before making it to the mainland. I'm not saying the actual art of Tang Soo Do was being taught in Hawaii in 1950, but it's very possible that the Korean community in Hawaii knew of the name and art. On at least 2 occasions I heard Joe Holck say that Choo was \"Korean Karate-Tang Soo Do\". And Holck was the one who came up with the \"Kajukenbo\" name. He was also Peter Choo's cousin by marriage.\n\nI was told he (Chang) had zero training and in any event, he did not participate at all in the creation of kajukenbo outside of photographing the techniques for the original manual. He was a photographer in the US Army. Therefore it is misleading to include him and siulumpai as the basis for \"bo\", especially since there were so many others who did american or western boxing, which did play a heavy role in the creation of kajukenbo techniques. Siulumpai did not come to Hawaii until 1962, through Master Buck Sam Kong. That was and still is the name of his organization, siulumpai. So that is probably where Sijo got the term siulumpai from, from Sifu Buck Sam Kong, who was maybe the most famous kung fu practitioner in hawaii back in the 60s and 70s.\n\nThis is from a biography on George Chang, which was written by Frank Ordonez:\n\n\"He contributed the \"BO\" in the KaJuKenBo system known as the Chinese Boxing - Gung-Fu style.\n\nHis family, friends, and co-founders know him as a refined individual, a outstanding martial artist and Korean War veteran.\n\nAt the early age of twelve, George spent a few years in his father's native land, the province of Kwangtung, prior to World War II.\n\nWhile in China he got his initial start in the \"hard / soft\" system of Sil Lum Kung-FU (Shaolin).\n\nHe retuned to Honolulu in 1941 when Hawaii was U.S. territory and not yet a state.\n\nChang then furthered his Chinese style knowledge under the late Wong Kok Fut.\"\n\nProfessor Choo was NOT a black belt in Taekwondo, and did NOT study under GM Jhoon Rhee. In fact, Professor Choo showed me his taekwondo rank card, 1st guep (1st kyu in japanese) from a taekwondo kwan whose name I did not recognize. I remember the card was dated in the 1960s and Professor Choo said he received that when he was stationed in Korea.\n\nHe stated in a video taped interview at Turtle Bay (Hi) in the early 90's, that he trained with Jhoon Rhee when he was in the Army stationed in Korea, (1953-55). He said that Jhoon Rhee was a Korean Army Officer at the time. He did not say if Rhee was his primary instructor, but he did say that he trained with him. And he said that he received black belts in Tae Kwon Do, (in Korea), Aikido (in Japan), and Shorinji Ryu Karate (in Okinawa). He may have told you different, but that's what I have on tape.\n\nProfessor Ordonez said that he had some boxing training as well, but was not as accomplished at Professor Choo, who was the best boxer of the group.\n\nCorrect. Emperado and Holck (aka: Joichi Matsuno) had boxed as teenagers. Peter Choo and Frank Ordonez both boxed on the same Army boxing team in Hawaii, that was coached by Thomas Toyama. Toyama has been called by some the \"unofficial 6th founder\".\n\nI attended Professor Choo's funeral and no one was in shock when Mr. Chang showed up. My understanding was the Professor Choo and Mr. Chang kept in touch over the years. Professor Choo's son told me that Mr. Chang was alive back when we were in college in the early 80s. Also, I have seen photos of Professors Choo and Ordonez wearing uniforms at the Palama Settlement school in the 60s for sure, so the statement about everyone losing touch for 30 years is incorrect.\n\nThe pictures that I have seen were from the late 50's at a belt test. If they are the pictures that Walter Godin had, one in particular is misidentified. The man that is said to be Choo, is actually Paul Yamaguichi. And Godin is receiving his blue belt, not black belt.\n\nIt's very well known that after the 50's, the only founder that was actively involved in Kajukenbo was Emperado. Emperado always referred to Chang as \"Frank Ordonez's friend\". He did not know him very well, and had no communication with him after 1950. Since the other founders were also gone, he only heard rumors about Chang. First that he was \"missing in action\". Then that he had died.\n\nBetween 1956 (after Woodrow McCandless died) and 1958, Ordonez did help on occasion at the Palama Settlement school. But mostly Joe Emperado, Sijo Emperado, and Pauly Soronio taught there. Choo, Chang, and Holck were in the service at various locations.\n\nAfter getting out of the service, Joe Holck settled in Tucson, Arizona. He had a very illustrious career in jujitsu and judo. Emperado moved permanently to California in around 1980-81. After 1950, the 5 founders were never together as a whole group again. And after 1958, Emperado was the only founder who actively taught and propagated Kajukenbo.\n\nAround 1988, Emperado was at a event in Tucson, Az., hosted by Vince Black. Joe Holck was also invited. In a video taped interview at the event, Holck and Emperado said that it was the first time they had seen each other in over 30 years.\n\nAround 1990, Emperado, Holck, and Choo, were brought together for a Kajukenbo event at Turtle Bay, Hawaii. Vince Black also video taped a interview with them on that occasion.\n\nAnd in June of 1996, Emperado, Choo, Holck, and Ordonez, were brought together for the annual KSDI Tournament that was held in San Jose, Ca. After that, Ordonez and Holck (Choo passed away in 97) would occasionally attend the Las Vegas KSDI tournament."
