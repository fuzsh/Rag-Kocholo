        "text": "INTRODUCTION TO THE LISTING OF JAPANESE PRISONERS OF WAR AND INTERNEES HELD IN AUSTRALIA FROM 1941 TO 1947 When Japan attacked Pearl Harbour, Australia was also at <strong>war</strong> with Japan. Japanese civilians in Australia were rounded up <strong>and</strong> interned, but it went fur<strong>the</strong>r than that. Japanese people or family members <strong>of</strong> Japanese were also interned as were such people from many o<strong>the</strong>r places outside Australia such as Indonesia <strong>and</strong> New Caledonia. People <strong>of</strong> mixed race who were married <strong>to</strong> a Japanese or children from such relationships were also interned. One lady who was listed as ¾ Aboriginal was interned because she was part Japanese. Many Japanese had been in Australia for two generations but were still interned. To read more about this subject see Yuriko Nagata’s excellent book “Unwanted Aliens – Japanese Internment in Australia” (University <strong>of</strong> Queensl<strong>and</strong> Press). Japanese military personnel were also interned as <strong>the</strong>y were captured or surrendered in <strong>the</strong> various campaigns in New Guinea <strong>and</strong> <strong>the</strong> Pacific. Military personnel were interned in ei<strong>the</strong>r Cowra or Hay, whereas civilians tended <strong>to</strong> be interned in Gaythorne, Tatura or Loveday camps. Many children were interned <strong>and</strong> a number were also born in <strong>the</strong> camps after 1941 through <strong>to</strong> 1946. Due <strong>to</strong> <strong>the</strong> lack <strong>of</strong> shipping after WWII, some POW were not sent home until 1946 or 1947. Many Japanese, even those not born in Japan, were repatriated. The lists are presented with Japanese last name by <strong>the</strong> given names in <strong>the</strong> first column <strong>and</strong> year <strong>of</strong> birth in <strong>the</strong> second column. Sometimes you will see more than one name in each box such as Kumagai aka Kumaya, Takanobu aka Takanopu. “aka” means “also known as” <strong>and</strong> <strong>the</strong> individual has used an alias for both <strong>the</strong>ir surname <strong>and</strong> given name. The <strong>listing</strong> is extensive <strong>and</strong> cointains over 5,000 names arranged in year <strong>of</strong> birth from 1849 <strong>to</strong> 1946 <strong>and</strong> <strong>the</strong>n alphabetically. Civillians <strong>and</strong> Military are listed <strong>to</strong>g<strong>the</strong>r. Military personnel will be found in <strong>the</strong> military service age groups from year <strong>of</strong> birth 1900 <strong>to</strong> 1925 approximately. If you know a particular name you can use <strong>the</strong> normal search facility in Micros<strong>of</strong>t Word <strong>to</strong> locate. If you want <strong>to</strong> read more about a particular person you should 1. block <strong>the</strong> full name, 2. copy it 3. click <strong>the</strong> link <strong>to</strong> <strong>the</strong> National Archives http://www.naa.gov.au/<strong>the</strong>_collection/recordsearch.html 4. click on RECORDS SEARCH 5. <strong>the</strong>n paste <strong>the</strong> name in<strong>to</strong> <strong>the</strong> box marked Keywords (or name) You will <strong>the</strong>n get an image <strong>of</strong> that person’s original record card <strong>and</strong> find out where <strong>the</strong>y were captured wherer <strong>the</strong>y came from in Japan, occupation etc. See example below."
