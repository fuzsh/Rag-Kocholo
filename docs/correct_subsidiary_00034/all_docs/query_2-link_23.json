Armed with state-of-the-art IT tools, they found it nearly impossible to locate the root cause of problems, investigate security attacks and assemble all the data required for compliance audits. Their conclusion: the silo approach to managing IT, with separate tools for every technology and IT function, was cumbersome, costly and didn't scale.\n\nSo, they founded Splunk to develop a new approach. The concept is simple. If Google can index and let users instantly search billions of pages of Web content, why not do the same for the datacenter? This new approach, called IT Search, is changing the way we manage, secure and audit IT infrastructures. Using Splunk IT Search software, organizations can now search and analyze all their IT data from one place in real time.\n\nWith Splunk, they can now troubleshoot outages, investigate security incidents and demonstrate compliance in minutes, instead of hours or days. Splunk arms IT with a new level of visibility and insight to protect critical resources, increase productivity and deliver improved service quality.
