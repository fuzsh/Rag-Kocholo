Box 85518 Lincoln, NE 68501-5518 CHANGE SERVICE REQUESTED June 17, 2005 Volume 27 Number 24 www.processor.com Products, News & Information Data Centers Can Trust. Since 1979 IT Patching Has Gotten Easier Who (Or What) Gets The Credit? by Ericka Chickowski The cowboy days of patch man- agement weren't so long ago. IT managers were living in the now, playing from the hip with reactive patch policies. \"People used to play it fast and loose,\" says Tom O'Reilly of CMS Energy. \"Really it was mad may- hem. These days it is a lot more methodical and a lot more proac- tive about patches.\" Just two years ago, his com- pany had no formal patch management process. But that was before circum stances forced its pri- orities to change. \"About 18 months ago, when the Blaster worm hit, that was pretty much the turning point for us,\" O'Reilly says. \"We didn't have any tools in place when that hit, and it really opened everyone's eyes as to why we couldn't be reactive about patching.\" Because the business is in a critical niche, regulations also played a part in its effort to improve patch manage- ment, he says. \"On top of that, Sarbanes- Oxley mandated that we had to have patch management in place, and that happened right around the same time as Blaster,\" he says. Through a combina- tion of better tools, bet- ter patch schedules on the vendors' parts, and just plain necessity, managers such as O'Reilly are getting better at change manage- ment. The process of managing patches is no longer the trial it once used to be. Better Vendors For many IT managers, a big part of the reason why patching has become easier is the cooperation of vendors. Software manufacturers have generally heard IT's cries over patch management and respond- ed with scheduled patching and free tools to help ease the pain. Microsoft is especially key, as it's the biggest bellwether in the patching game. If Microsoft products are difficult to patch, then it will be an arduous process for Go to Page 7, Column 1 Bluetooth: The Next Big Threat? What You Need To Know To Protect Your Company's Data by Chris Jackson When it comes to security, convenience always comes at a price. Bluetooth connectivity is no exception. The initial premise of Bluetooth was that all your electronic devices would con- nect wirelessly over a piconet, freeing you from USB, PS/2, and serial cables. Yet security ex- perts have uncovered numerous Bluetooth largely relies upon the vendors' security implementation to protect your information. vulnerabilities in various Blue- tooth implementations that pose a potential threat to your busi- ness. To help minimize your exposure to the risks of Blue- tooth devices, we'll discuss the common threats, as well as some recommendations from experts in the security field on how to mitigate the risk posed by Bluetooth. Bluetooth Basics Bluetooth devices operate in an unregulated radio frequency with ranges up to 30 meters. Devices that incorporate Blue- tooth connectivity range from keyboards and mice to cell phones and PDAs. Whether it's used to synchronize your PDA, cell phone, or computer or to free your desk from cable clut- ter, Bluetooth largely relies upon the vendors' security im- plementation to protect your information. And like any wire- less technology, its signal can be read further than expected, in some instances up to 1 kilo- meter away. How does Bluetooth expose your business information? Largely through cell phones and PDAs. Bluetooth keyboards and mice are relatively safe once \"bonded\" to their computer sys- tems. They also rarely travel out- side of the office, unlike PDAs and cell phones. The greatest vulnerabilities are bluesnarfing, bluebugging, and bluejacking. Bluesnarfing.

The company, which has a market capital- ization of more than $80 billion, surpassed Time Warner with its capitalization of $78.1 billion. Google is still far behind Time Warner in terms of sales though: Google posted sales of just $3.2 billion last year; Time Warner had $42 billion. While some analysts fear Google may be overval- ued, many analysts believe the stock could exceed $325 a share. I Higher Salaries For Certain IT Skills IT salaries increased for workers with certain niche skills, Foote Partners reports. Factors contributing to the higher salaries include a strong economy that has added some new jobs recently, the hot merger and acquisition market, and government regula- tions. Foote Partners ranked the highest- paying skills as project-level security, RAD/Extreme Programming, VoIP, and Storage/SAN. The categories showing the greatest growth include applications devel- opment tools and languages; messaging, email, and group ware skills; and network- ing and Internet- working skills. I Microsoft CEO Reveals Company Plans At the recent TechEd 2005, Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer announced the software giant is putting more effort toward providing infrastructure and tools for \"a new way of work.\" Ballmer noted an increased emphasis on mobility, with Microsoft's Visual Studio Tools for Office, the upcoming Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 Service Pack 2, and the Messaging and Security Pack Feature for Windows Mobile 5.0. Ballmer also hinted that, in the future, Microsoft Outlook could become a centralized platform to link together Office applications with different forms of enterprise applications. I Apple Confirms Switch To Intel Apple CEO Steve Jobs confirmed that Apple will begin using Intel chips in its Macintosh computers starting in June 2006. By the end of 2007, all Macs will ship with Intel processors. The company says it is \"very far along\" in transitioning the Mac to Intel processors; every release for OS X in the last five years has been compiled for Intel's processors. Migrating Mac apps to the Intel platform will be made easier with Xcode 2.1, which lets developers compile binary apps that run on PowerPC and Intel processors. A new technology called Rosetta will help in translating PowerPC apps for the Intel environment. I Satisfaction Wanes For Offshoring According to consulting firm Dia- mondCluster International, the number of buyers satisfied with the providers of their offshore outsourcing has fallen from 79% to 62%. The firm's annual survey of IT out- sourcing also revealed that 51% of buyers are terminating their outsourcing relationships earlier than scheduled. Although critics of offshoring worry about the effects of job losses on the economy, a report from the Information Technology Association of America shows that sacrifices by U.S. IT workers actually improve the U.S. economy. I United To Install Wi-Fi United Airlines will begin offering in- flight Wi-Fi service beginning sometime next year, allowing passengers to check email and surf the Web while flying. United will be the first domestic airline to offer the service, although carriers such as Lufthansa and Japan Airlines already offer the service on international flights. The airline has not yet determined a price for the service, which will use United' s existing airline phone network operated by Verizon. I EU: Microsoft Moving In Right Direction The European Commission, the EU's antitrust committee, responded favorably to Microsoft's latest concessions related to the antitrust case. The concessions involve Microsoft implementing its new product interoperability strategy worldwide and creating more royalty licensing plans and customization options. These new propos- als will be presented to other companies before the EC makes it final decision. I Cisco, Yahoo! Join Forces Against Spam Cisco and Yahoo! are working together to create a new email authentication system that will help in the battle against spam and fraud. The system, called DomainKeys Identified Mail, combines Yahoo !'s DomainKey authentication technology, which verifies a sender at the DNS level, and Cisco's Internet Identified Mail, which ensures consistency of header signatures as messages are pushed through the system. The two companies are working to make DKIM a Web standard and plan to offer the technology on a royalty-free basis to other companies in the industry. I Citrix Buys NetScaler ClTRIX ANNOUNCED ITS PLANS to buy NetScaler, Citrix' s third acquisition in about a year. NetScaler specializes in traf- fic compression and balancing technology to quickly transport data between Internet servers, improving the speed and reliability of Web sites and private corporate net- works. NetScaler' s clients include Google, MSN, Amazon.com, and United Airlines; it estimates that 75% of all Web users go through its services every day. Citrix will pay $300 million in the deal, which includes both cash and stock. I Microsoft Fined In Patent Case A jury in federal court has ordered Microsoft to pay $8.9 million to Guate- malan inventor Carlos Armando Amado for infringing on Amado' s 1994 patent on technology linking Microsoft's Excel and Access programs. Amado says he created the software, which uses a single spread- sheet to link the two programs, and filed for a patent in 1990. Two years later, when the patent was still pending, he tried unsuccess- fully to sell it to Microsoft. The jury dis- missed the other nine counts Amado brought against the software maker.

Know When To Plug The Holes & When To Leave Them Open by Elizabeth Millard • • • Thanks to such speedy changes in development, software applica- tions are constantly being updat- ed to incorporate new security protections, additional features, and interoperability controls. Although the march to perfection is good for small to midsized enterprises that want to keep their systems fresh and strong, it can also be a wearisome task to keep up with all the changes. For many companies, the head- ache can be lessened by employ- ing patches strategically, leav ing some applications to be patched later. Experts note that scheduling nonpriori- ty patches on a regular basis, rather than scurrying to put every patch in place as soon as it's avail- able, is a better use of time and resources Patch Application Matrix Small to medium -si zed enterprises should create a chart similar to the one below to specify the business risk of a breach in security and the downtime allowable for meeting patching requirements.

But, in general, there are several ways to evaluate whether a patch is criti- cal or just nice to have. The first step for this process is establishing a solid assess- ment procedure, according to Microsoft. Companies need to take stock of what's in their cur- rent inventory of computing assets, from Web servers down to print servers and desktop operating systems. For IT companies using a Windows-based system, there will likely be a number of com- ponents already being updated by Microsoft's Software Update Services. However, security sys- tems and standalone computers aren't part of a managed infra- structure, Microsoft notes, which means they must be manually checked to make sure that the latest software updates have been installed. The criteria to use when decid- ing what to install and when to install it, for Microsoft as well as other vendors, is determined by the effect an unpatched applica- tion will have on the company's overall technology environment. If an isolated system has a moder- ately used application, IT admin- istrators can patch it when it's convenient. But if the patch is for the company's main database, Go to Page 8, Column 1 Monitor Virtual Booth 3695 • Virtual Product 0032 • FlexScan L795 is ideal in any business or graphics environment • Unique Active Rotation portrait mode support with- out special software • Picture in Picture from two computer sources • 10-bit gamma correction for optimal color rendition • Slim Bezel Design to save space on your desktop • USB 2.0 Hub to facilitate high speed connection with other peripherals 5710 Warland Drive Cypress, CA 90630 Phone:(562)431-5011 Fax:(562)431-4811 WEB: www.eizo.com EMAIL: orders@eizo.com Retail Price $899 Monitor Virtual Booth 4251 • Virtual Product 2421 • Grade A TFT/LCD panels ranging from 6.4\" to 20.1 \" • Integrated with touch screen options • Integrated with high brightness and exclusive transflec- tive technology options • Integrated with waterproof NEMA 04/IP 65 options • Designed for commercial, industrial, and custom applica- tions CTX INDUSTRIAL 16728 E.

It has also bulked up its offering of free patching utilities to improve the process. \"As far as free product goes, what they offer is pretty amazing,\" O'Reilly says, explaining that working for a utility company forces him to be fru- gal because big expenditures mean a rise in power prices, which must be well-justified to the public. Investing In Tools It is debatable whether the efforts of manufacturers such as Microsoft have really been the miracle balm for relieving the patching headache. \"To us, it doesn't matter,\" says Chad Gniffke of InHouse IT about regular patch schedules. He says the reason his company is able to easily handle patch management is not because of the outside forces at play but instead because of the investment and com- mitment it made a year ago. Last June InHouse IT purchased Kaseya, a patch and system manage- ment tool that has automated much of the patching process on the thousands of machines that InHouse IT man- ages. \"We started using Kaseya a year ago, based on need,\" Gniffke says. \"It was obvious to us that we needed something to help us, or we were going to have to go to clients and tell them we were going to have to be in their offices for double the amount of time in order to manually stay up-to-date with patches. That wasn't an option.\" Combined with a collection of homebrewed tools, InHouse IT is able to fully automate the pro- cess and generate reports to up- date staff about changes made on all machines managed by the com- pany. And even O'Reilly at CMS Energy can't depend on Microsoft's and other vendors' utilities alone to carry out the process. He supple- ments manufacturer tools with HFNetChk, low-cost patch manage- ment software from Shavlik. Sound Strategy Whether using free tools or expen- sive ones, improvements in the patch game have depended on sound oper- ational strategies, as well. \"Right now we have it scheduled so that when Microsoft releases a patch, we have set up a number of machines that are guinea pigs,\" O'Reilly says. \"They are a mix of different users who act as a pretty good represen- tation of our clientele, and they get it first.\" After installing on these test ma- chines, he waits a week to be sure there aren't any problems and scans patch-related mailing lists for user Processor.com warnings about bad patches. If everything turns up clear, he uses a combination of vendor tools and HFNetChk to roll out the patches on everyone's machine. Even with the help of Kaseya, Gniffke has had to adopt a workable strategy for success. Though the pro- gram has helped his company ease the process, it wouldn't be possible with- out bringing in a full-time employee to manage the system. \"We have a single point of responsibility for patches,\" he says. \"We really need that full-time person to make sure everything runs smoothly.\" Benefits No matter what the reason for improvement, managers such as O'Reilly and Gniffke have seen the benefits of better change manage- ment. Since investing in its tools, Gniffke says that the dividends are clear. \"One area that has been a huge benefit is that none of our businesses need to do patch management during business hours,\" he says. \"We've seen less emergency response issues due to patching, and it really has made our end-user experience better since we streamlined the process.\" By The Numbers The market for patch management tools is growing exponentially. Analysts believe that the niche will be a $300 million market by 2008. According to the Yankee Group, it can cost businesses up to $300 per patch per machine using a fully man- ual process for patch management. Page 7 BlueTooth: The Next Big Threat? Continued from Page 1 on flaws in several cell phones and PDAs that use Bluetooth. Bluesnarfing relies on two things: Bluetooth being enabled on your device and your device being in dis- coverable mode. By bluesnarfing a hacker can retrieve your contact lists, your calendar, and any other data stored in the device. Hackers can access your device surreptitiously from up to 10 meters with easily available equipment and soft- ware. Although the Bluetooth industry would have you think this is unlikely, think of all the public places you carry Think of bluejacking as I spam for your cell phone. I your PDA or cell phone. Security experts have even created devices that can increase the range of your vulnerability up to 1 kilometer. Bluebugging. Like bluesnarfing, bluebugging allows an attacker to access your cell phone's data and also use your cell phone for outbound calls. By connecting over Blue- tooth to your cell phone, the intruder could eavesdrop on conversations near your phone, impersonate text mes- sages, and record cell phone conversations. Intruders could also modify existing data on your cell phone. Blue- bugging currently only affects cell phones, but as PDAs morph into cell phones, the risk to your company data will increase. Bluejacking. Bluejacking is one of the more innocuous vulnerabilities in Bluetooth. Think of bluejacking as spam for your cell phone. Miscreants can send business cards anonymously to your device and usually do so just for enter- tainment. They can't access or modify any of your data, but they can definitely annoy you. The Future As with the vulnerabilities discovered with 802.x wire- less networks, administrators are discovering that Bluetooth devices can expose more data than is acceptable. With Bluetooth being incorporated in millions of devices, the chance that your business could be affected by Bluetooth vulnerabilities increases every day. Minimizing the danger posed by Bluetooth devices is a difficult task. Most vendors simply tell you to configure your device as \"undiscoverable.\" However, this doesn't pre- vent some devices from being exploited. According to Bruce Schneier, CTO of Counterpane Internet Security, the best thing you can do to mitigate your exposure is simply to not use Bluetooth devices in the workplace. Disabling Bluetooth connectivity can be done on most devices, although not all. And finding out which devices in your enterprise utilize Bluetooth can be a challenge. If you're concerned that Bluetooth devices may be slipping under the radar, devices such as AirDefense's BlueWatch and Red-M's Red-alert PRO can help you identify Blue- tooth devices in your business. Risk vs. Reward Any new technology can pose an unacceptable risk to your business during its infancy. Determining when the trade-off between security and convenience is acceptable can be difficult without knowing the nature of any vulnera- bilities in the technology. As Bluetooth devices become more commonplace, it's incumbent upon IT managers to proactively manage them until their security implementa- tions improve. Action Plan Inventory your existing Bluetooth devices using tools such as AirDefense's BlueWatch and Red-M's Red-alert PRO / Disable Bluetooth functionality whenever possible on the devices you've uncovered. ei Configure devices to be undiscoverable. / Check with your vendors to see if you're running the latest firmware on any devices that require Bluetooth functionality. / Don't store mission-critical data on devices that leave your company premises.

The plan should also include which individuals are responsible for patching each sys- tem, says John Baschab, co-author of \"The Executive's Guide to In- formation Technology.\" Putting one person in charge of all updates can backfire if that per- son has additional responsibilities. It's better to assign updates to who- ever is in charge of that system. For example, the person who takes care of desktop support should be in charge of desktop patches. \"Updates can be assigned ac- cording to area of specialty or ex- pertise,\" says Baschab. \"That way, it's part of a routine and doesn't feel overwhelming.\" In creating a patch plan, IT managers should look at areas of risk, says Chad Robinson, senior research analyst at IT consultancy Robert Frances Group. He notes that many enterprises don't con- sider email clients to present a high business risk because other tasks can be done while the email client is down. But for many com- panies, this kind of thinking could lead to a skewed sense of risk. \"Email clients represent one of the most common sources of infec- tion from viruses and worms,\" Robinson says. \"So they pose a risk to other systems in the enterprise.\" Processor.com mation on their sites are Secunia, Sophos, and F-Secure; they also contain links to patches in their security alerts. Whether the patches should be downloaded immedi- ately or whenever it's convenient depends on severity of the flaw, says F-Secure Director of Antivirus Research Mikko Hypponen. \"Vulnerabilities are rated based on the danger that they pose to Experts note that scheduling non- priority patches on a regular basis, rather than scurrying to put every patch in place as soon as it's available, is a better use of time and resources. Therefore, they should be patched as soon as an update is made avail- able, he adds. Eyes & Ears IT managers should also moni- tor Web sites and security mailing lists that aren't vendor-related, advises Robinson, to find out about breaking security news that might require a patch. Symantec has a solid track record of issuing alerts about new patches, but some vendors aren't as stellar. Robinson notes that product ven- dors have been known to be \"relaxed in their classification risk levels\" in an attempt to downplay product flaws. Three reputable security research firms that often contain patch infor- users, how easily a system can be compromised, and whether the code is in the wild or was just created in a security lab,\" he notes. If a malicious hacker is able to take control of a system remotely and is spreading the code across the Web, then F- Secure and other companies will give it a high risk rating, such as \"highly critical.\" Security research firms often hold their highest rating, \"ex- tremely critical,\" in reserve for when it' s really needed. If one of these ever does appear, Hypponen suggests that IT managers drop whatever they're doing and get their systems patched pronto. \"An 'extremely critical' vulner- ability is just too dangerous not to patch right away,\" he says. \"This is true especially because ex- ploitation of the flaw usually doesn't require any interaction on the part of the user. An attacker can just get in, whether someone opens the door or not.\" Less critical ratings are used for vulnerabilities that can be patched later in the day, or when- ever there's a free moment. These are typically items such as cross- site scripting vulnerabilities or privilege escalation flaws that might allow exposure of data to local users but don't open the whole system to attack. June 17, 2005 Especially helpful on security sites are the extensive patches available. Often, the firms will supply equipment-specific patches or links so that an IT manager doesn't have to go back to the ven- dor or navigate through multiple security sites for the right fixes. In general, patches can be man- aged with prioritization, with one eye toward breaking news. \"Patch- ing is like maintaining your house,\" says Hypponen. \"You do regular maintenance based on what's need- ed, with the understanding that you'll need to act fast if the base- ment is flooding.\" Procedures For Patch Deployment The Robert Frances Group recommends developing certain patching system procedures. The sample chart below breaks down the ownership group for each task and who should be notified. Task Ownership Notify Monitor for vulnerabilities Security group CIO/CSO Identify vulnerable systems and determine severity Security group CIO/CSO Determine response until patch is available Security group Administrators Implement response until patch is available Administrators Security group Monitor for patches Security group CIO/CSO Test patch for defects or adverse effects Administrators Security group For defective patches, determine appropriate course of action Security group CIO/CSO, Administrators Identify patch effects, such as reboots required.

It is, therefore, imperative that patches be tested on systems that are representative of stan- dard systems on your network to ensure there are no conflicts or incompatibilities before you deploy them. Ed Skoudis, founder and senior security consultant with informa- tion security firm IntelGuardians, says, \"Corporate patch manage- ment's most important aspects are competing concepts: thor- oughness of testing and speed.\" Skoudis adds, \"We need to op- timize, to the extent possible, across both of these axes, al- though that is difficult. But time- ly patches applied after testing are crucial.\" Your patch testing and patch management procedures have to account for these competing goals. The testing has to be thor- ough enough to essentially rule out any potential issues but not take so long that it impacts the overall integrity of your net- work security by leaving your systems unpatched. Define Your Starting Point In order to tell if the patch or update adversely impacts your systems, you have to know how the systems are supposed to work in the first place. You should cre- ate and define a base build for each of the standard configura- tions in use in your environment. You might have one build for desktops and another for servers, or you may break it down further if groups such as engineering, accounting, or Web developers have specialized hardware and software that make their con- figurations unique. The base build should detail the hardware and software in- stalled on the system, as well as maintain a listing of the patches or updates that have already been applied. A change management group should approve any up- dates or additions to the base build and add the changes to the base build documentation. Write It Down As with any proce- dure or policy, it is best to have the steps clearly defined and written down. Not only does having a written process pro- vide you with a check- list to use to ensure you follow the same steps each time, but if the primary patch testing team is unavailable, other personnel should be able to follow the patch testing process using the written documentation. The patch testing documentation should describe each step of the patch testing process and include the base build descriptions or ref- erences to where the base build details can be found. The process should provide some examples of how the hardware and software are expected to behave for each of the standard build configura- tions, and it should include tests that IT administrators can per- form to verify that the systems still function properly after a new patch is applied. Where possible, the documentation should in- clude graphics or screen shots so that technicians following it know exactly what they should see during testing. Use A Phased Approach It is important that your com- pany's testing process represents your environment, but you don't want to impact the live produc- tion network. Do the initial test- ing on model systems that are clones of the systems the patches will eventually be applied to. You should have at least a couple systems configured for each of the standard base builds you have defined. Ideally you should also remove or segregate your model computer systems from the live production network. You lose the benefit of testing in a model environment if flaws on the functionality testing that you per- formed on the model systems, you can then proceed with rolling the patch out to the whole network. Verify Successful Installation Executing some tests to ensure that the systems still function properly is certainly a primary concern, but part of the patch test- ing process should also include making sure that model systems somehow propa- gate or impact the production environment. After you have successfully applied and tested the patch in your model environment, you should still proceed with caution. No matter how well you have defined and configured your model environment, there may still be minor differences in the production systems that may prove catastrophic when you install the patch or update. Rather than unleashing the patch on the entire network, you should select a handful of ma- chines representing each of the standard build configurations and implement the patch only on these devices first. After you perform the same patch verification and The Patching Proced ure Software patch Test patch on or update ■)► model system released environment Roll patch to small portion of live network Deploy patch to full production environment ^v^ ^^M ^^H Verify that patch installs successfully ^ Verify that patch ^^ can be removed successfully Perform system ^^^ backup before deploying patch patch actually installed and is working properly. Within each of its security bulletins, Microsoft includes a section called \"Verifying Patch Installation\" under the heading \"Additional Information About This Patch.\" In this section, you can find the Registry entries affected by the patch, new file versions you should expect to find once the patch is in- stalled, and other configuration changes that happen by apply- ing the patch. You can use this information to create a checklist of items to look for to verify that the patch was installed for Microsoft applica- tions or operating systems. Other vendors may include a similar list of changes and updates in the documentation included with their patches. While it might not always be feasible, where possible you should try to validate whether the patch actually fixes the flaw it was in- tended to fix. You can try to simu- late exploiting the vulnerability the patch is designed to fix. You should make sure that your model systems are separate or segre- gated from the production net- work, though, so any exploits don't spread to the live systems. Uninstalling / Back-Out Plan Regardless of how thorough your patch testing is, problems may still arise once the patch is deployed on the production systems. It is also possible that you find out, days later, that the patch actually opens more critical vulner- abilities than it fixes and that you need to remove it immediately. You should have a current backup for those patches that alter the system so they cannot simply be uninstalled, for patch- es from vendors who did not cre- ate an uninstall routine, or for situations where a patch renders the system completely inopera- ble. The patch testing and de- ployment process must include a step to perform a backup of all critical systems and data prior to patch deployment. Expedite, But Don't Rush Once a vendor announces a vul- nerability and re- leases a patch to fix the flaw, a clock starts ticking in the race between get- ting the patch test- ed and deployed and having a malicious ex- ploit to take advantage of the vulnerability. Your patch testing pro- cess must be thorough enough to ensure the patch does not cause more prob- lems than it solves but should also be able to be executed in an expedited manner so you can get the patch deployed as quickly as possible to protect your network. Patch Testing Considerations Chris Davis, co-author of \"Hacking Exposed: Computer Forensics,\" spells out five essentials of creating an effective patch testing procedure. 1 . Establish a baseline from which your systems are going to be built. 2. Establish a baseline policy that specifies which team will main- tain the baseline. 3. Establish a patch policy that identifies the people involved, the metrics by which patches are delivered, the process and contacts used to deliver patches, and the tools used to do all of this. 4. Establish a patch management team that identifies patches for different OSes, hardware, and applications; determines the crit- icality of the patch; and commu- nicates the need for maintaining patch levels. 5. Involve other groups, such as network teams, and find and include people on meaningful and appropriate mailing lists. Page 10 Processor.com Patch Management Applications New Features Help Streamline The Process by Douglas Schweitzer, Sc.D. • • • Software bugs are pricey. Ac- cording to a study by NIST, such problems cost the U.S. economy about $60 billion annually. And until software vendors find bugs more promptly, organizations will have to put up with buggy soft- ware that requires patching on a regular basis. Unfortunately, if you're using, or are considering using, manual processes to stay on top of security alerts and patches, you'll quickly find your- self falling behind, vulnerable to attacks similar to what happened with the Code Red and Slammer worms and their brethren. Attacks are even more likely on heterogeneous networks using a mix of operating system plat- forms. A better approach may be for your organization to automate the distribution of security patch- es for workstations and servers, thereby simplifying and shorten- ing the patch management process and cycle. Fortunately, there are a good number of third-party tools available to help streamline this important process. The Free Way With some of its products beset with misconfigurations, Microsoft realized the need for a streamlined method for identifying the most common ones in its products. This led to the Microsoft Strategic Technology Protection Program and the development by Shavlik Technologies (www. shavlik .com) of the MBSA (Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer). Available at no charge from Microsoft, MBSA is a scanning tool that searches for misconfigurations, recommended patches, and hotfixes for the OS and installed Microsoft compo- nents, such as Windows IIS and SQL Server on Windows-based computers. Also available at no charge is the Microsoft SUS (Software Update Services) server. Devel- oped with simplification in mind, SUS helps network managers keep Windows-based systems up-to- date with the latest patches and hotfixes by aiding in the deploy- ment of updates to Windows • ' \" 7 ■ ■-':■■ ' [ Password: | m ■ guard N, 5, 5, ■ ^_j Security Scanner (Default) B-S 5can Filters ( -y Full re, 'jf High set urity l-QP Security issues | ■■■ 0P Missing patches \\™QP Open ports './Open rci \"JfOpenUD \\~-QP List of shares _/ SNMPi; formation _/ List oh: '■■■■[?

Industrial Strength Solutions GFI LANguard N.S.S. (Net- work Security Scanner) audits your network security, performs patch management, and automatically detects security vulnerabilities on your network. GFI LANguard N.S.S. checks your network for all potential methods a hacker might use to attack the network. By analyzing the OS and appli- cations running on your network, it identifies possible security holes. It plays devil's advocate and warns you about weaknesses before a hacker can find them, letting you handle them before the hacker can exploit them. Providing in-depth information about all your organization's machines and devices, GFI LAN- guard N.S.S. scans your entire network, IP by IP, and supplies information such as the service pack level of the machine, miss- ing security patches, open shares, open ports, wireless access points, USB devices, services/applica- tions active on the computer, key Registry entries, weak passwords, users and groups, and more. The scan results are outputted to an HTML report, which can be customized or queried, enabling you to proactively secure your net- work, for example, by shutting down unnecessary ports, closing shares, or installing service packs and hotfixes.

WinlNSTALL DAS (Desktop Availability Suite) from On- Demand Software takes an inte- grated approach to desktop life- cycle management. By using all the functions of this com- plete suite, IT admins don't have to manage the desktop by relying on patches alone. DAS' patch management capa- bility leverages packaging functions, inventory, multiple software distribution methods, and replication for distributed environments. The DAS reads Microsoft's Mssecure.xml file and shows all OS and application patch bulletins on a console display for easy read- ing. The user simply clicks, and the patch is downloaded and packaged for the desktop. Also available is the drag-and-drop method for dis- tributing patches on machines that require the patch, automatically distributing the patch at login when machines have yet to be patched or scheduling the patch to run at a specific date and time. For organi- zations with distributed offices, WinlNSTALL DAS can be set to schedule replication jobs to auto- matically replicate all patch pack- ages to a local site rather than across the WAN. Unlike other scanning products that rely on the MBSA database, the DAS inventories the actual hot- fix level for all Microsoft operating systems and applications. In this way the DAS is able to provide a vulnerability assessment check on the OS, application, individual machine, and hotfix levels. For the small to medium- sized enterprise, the DAS is appealing for its cost effectiveness. Needing no dedicated patch management servers to run the product, the DAS includes MSI packaging, software distribution, inventory and asset management, the ability to install operating systems and service packs, and personality and data transfer along with patch management at roughly the same cost as standalone patch manage- ment solutions.
