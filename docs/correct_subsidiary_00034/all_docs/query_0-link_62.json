        "text": "Nonclassicality of Photon-Added Displaced Thermal State via Quantum Phase-Space Distributions\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhang, Ran; Meng, Xiang-Guo; Du, Chuan-Xun; Wang, Ji-Suo\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe introduce a new kind of nonclassical mixed state generated by adding arbitrary photons to a displaced thermal state, i.e., the photon-added displaced thermal state (PADTS), and obtain the normalization factor, which is simply related to two-variable Hermite polynomials. We also discuss the nonclassicality of the PADTS by considering quantum phase-space distributions. The results indicate that the value of the photon count statistics is maximum when the number of detected photons is equal to the number of added photons, and that the photon-added operation has a similar modulation effect with increasing displacement. Moreover, the negative volume of the Wigner function for the PADTS takes a maximal value for a specific photon-added number.\n\nGeneration of a Kind of Displaced Thermal States in the Diffusion Process and its Statistical Properties\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nXiang-Guo, Meng; Hong-Yi, Fan; Ji-Suo, Wang\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThis paper proposes a kind of displaced thermal states (DTS) and explores how this kind of optical field emerges using the entangled state representation. The results show that the DTS can be generated by a coherent state passing through a diffusion channel with the diffusion coefficient Ï° only when there exists Îº t = (e^{\\\\hbar Î½ /kBT} - 1 )^{-1}. Also, its statistical properties, such as mean photon number, Wigner function and entropy, are investigated.\n\nQuantum-teleportation benchmarks for independent and identically distributed spin states and displaced thermal states\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGuta, Madalin; Bowles, Peter; Adesso, Gerardo\n\n2010-01-01\n\nA successful state-transfer (or teleportation) experiment must perform better than the benchmark set by the 'best' measure and prepare procedure. We consider the benchmark problem for the following families of states: (i) displaced thermal equilibrium states of a given temperature; (ii) independent identically prepared qubits with a completely unknown state. For the first family we show that the optimal procedure is heterodyne measurement followed by the preparation of a coherent state. This procedure was known to be optimal for coherent states and for squeezed states with the 'overlap fidelity' as the figure of merit. Here, we prove its optimality with respect to the trace norm distance and supremum risk. For the second problem we consider n independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) spin-(1/2) systems in an arbitrary unknown state Ï and look for the measurement-preparation pair (M n ,P n ) for which the reconstructed state Ï n :=P n circle M n (Ï xn ) is as close as possible to the input state (i.e., parallel Ï n -Ï xn parallel 1 is small). The figure of merit is based on the trace norm distance between the input and output states. We show that asymptotically with n this problem is equivalent to the first one. The proof and construction of (M n ,P n ) uses the theory of local asymptotic normality developed for state estimation which shows that i.i.d. quantum models can be approximated in a strong sense by quantum Gaussian models. The measurement part is identical to 'optimal estimation', showing that 'benchmarking' and estimation are closely related problems in the asymptotic set up.\n\nNonclassical thermal-state superpositions: Analytical evolution law and decoherence behavior\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMeng, Xiang-guo; Goan, Hsi-Sheng; Wang, Ji-suo; Zhang, Ran\n\n2018-03-01\n\nEmploying the integration technique within normal products of bosonic operators, we present normal product representations of thermal-state superpositions and investigate their nonclassical features, such as quadrature squeezing, sub-Poissonian distribution, and partial negativity of the Wigner function. We also analytically and numerically investigate their evolution law and decoherence characteristics in an amplitude-decay model via the variations of the probability distributions and the negative volumes of Wigner functions in phase space. The results indicate that the evolution formulas of two thermal component states for amplitude decay can be viewed as the same integral form as a displaced thermal state Ï(V , d) , but governed by the combined action of photon loss and thermal noise. In addition, the larger values of the displacement d and noise V lead to faster decoherence for thermal-state superpositions.\n\nA thermal modelling of displacement cascades in uranium dioxide\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMartin, G., E-mail: guillaume.martin@cea.fr [CEA â DEN/DEC/SESC/LLCC, BÃ¢t. 352, 13108 Saint-Paul-Lez-Durance Cedex (France); Garcia, P.; Sabathier, C.

[Laboratory for Reactor Physics and Systems Behaviour, Paul Scherrer Institute, CH-5232 Villigen PSI (Switzerland); Maillard, S. [CEA â DEN/DEC/SESC/LLCC, BÃ¢t. 352, 13108 Saint-Paul-Lez-Durance Cedex (France)\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe space and time dependent temperature distribution was studied in uranium dioxide during displacement cascades simulated by classical molecular dynamics (MD). The energy for each simulated radiation event ranged between 0.2 keV and 20 keV in cells at initial temperatures of 700 K or 1400 K. Spheres into which atomic velocities were rescaled (thermal spikes) have also been simulated by MD to simulate the thermal excitation induced by displacement cascades. Equipartition of energy was shown to occur in displacement cascades, half of the kinetic energy of the primary knock-on atom being converted after a few tenths of picoseconds into potential energy. The kinetic and potential parts of the system energy are however subjected to little variations during dedicated thermal spike simulations. This is probably due to the velocity rescaling process, which impacts a large number of atoms in this case and would drive the system away from a dynamical equilibrium. This result makes questionable MD simulations of thermal spikes carried out up to now (early 2014). The thermal history of cascades was compared to the heat equation solution of a punctual thermal excitation in UO{sub 2}. The maximum volume brought to a temperature above the melting temperature during the simulated cascade events is well reproduced by this simple model. This volume eventually constitutes a relevant estimate of the volume affected by a displacement cascade in UO{sub 2}. This definition of the cascade volume could also make sense in other materials, like iron.\n\nStress and Displacement Analysis of Microreactors during Thermal and Vacuum Loading\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2017-09-07\n\nARL-TR-8121 â SEP 2017 US Army Research Laboratory Stress and Displacement Analysis of Microreactors during Thermal and Vacuum...is no longer needed.

GRANT NUMBER\n\nRock properties and their effect on thermally-induced displacements and stresses\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChan, T.; Hood, M.; Board, M.\n\n1980-02-01\n\nA discussion is given of the importance of material properties in the finite-element calculations for thermally induced displacements and stresses resulting from a heating experiment in an in-situ granitic rock, at Stripa, Sweden. Comparisons are made between field measurements and finite element method calculations using (1) temperature independent, (2) temperature dependent thermal and thermomechanical properties and (3) in-situ and laboratory measurements for Young's modulus. The calculations of rock displacements are influenced predominantly by the temperature dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient, whereas the dominant factor affecting predictions for rock stresses is the in-situ modulus\n\nThermal cycling fatigue of organic thermal interface materials using a thermal-displacement measurement technique\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSteill, Jason Scott\n\nThe long term reliability of polymer-based thermal interface materials (TIM) is essential for modern electronic packages which require robust thermal management. The challenge for today's materials scientists and engineers is to maximize the heat flow from integrated circuits through a TIM and out the heat sink. Thermal cycling of the electronic package and non-uniformity in the heat flux with respect to the plan area can lead to void formation and delamination which re-introduces inefficient heat transfer. Measurement and understanding at the nano-scale is essential for TIM development. Finding and documenting the evolution of the defects is dependent upon a full understanding of the thermal probes response to changing environmental conditions and the effects of probe usage. The response of the thermal-displacement measurement technique was dominated by changes to the environment. Accurate measurement of the thermal performance was hindered by the inability to create a model system and control the operating conditions. This research highlights the need for continued study into the probe's thermal and mechanical response using tightly controlled test conditions.\n\nTHERMAL DISPLACEMENT OF CRANKSHAFT AXIS OF SLOW-SPEED MARINE ENGINE\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLech Murawski\n\n2016-08-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper presents analysis of displacement of a crankshaft axis caused by temperature of marine, slow-speed main engine. Information of thermal displacement of a power transmission system axis is significant during a shaft line alignment and a crankshaft springing analysis. Warmed-up main engine is a source of deformations of an engine body as well as a ship hull in the area of an engine room and hence axis of a crankshaft and a shaftline. Engines' producers recommend the model of parallel displacement of the crankshaft axis under the influence of an engine heat. The model gives us the value (one number! of the crankshaft axis displacement in the hot propulsion system's condition. This model may be too simple in some cases. Presented numerical analyses are based on temperature measurements of the main engine body and the ship hull during a sea voyage. The paper presents computations of MAN B&W K98MC type engine (power: 40000 kW, revolutions: 94 rpm mounted on 4500 TEU container ship (length: 290 m. Propulsion system is working in nominal, steady-state conditions; it is the basic assumption during the analyses. Numerical analyses were preformed with usage of Nastran software based on Finite Element Method. The FEM model of the engine body comprised over 800 thousand degree of freedom. Stiffness of the ship hull (mainly double bottom with the foundation was modelled by a simple cuboid. Material properties of that cuboid were determined on the base of separately performed calculations.\n\nState of the Art Review on Theoretical Tribology of Fluid Power Displacement Machines\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nCerimagic, Remzija; Johansen, Per; Andersen, Torben O.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nmachines, and also the work done to validate the theoretical models.

The review considers the rheological models used in the theoretical approaches, the modeling...... and wear mechanisms in the lubricating gaps in fluid power machines is confined to simulation models, as experimental treatments of these mechanisms are very difficult.

The displacements introduced by thermal expansion are usually derived without considering the annex height and underground part of the monument (e.g. located on roof or top of the buildings), which may bias the geophysical explanation of the seasonal oscillation. In this paper, the improved vertical displacements are derived by a refined thermal expansion model where the annex height and underground depth of the monument are taken into account, and then 560 IGS stations are adopted to validate the modeled thermal expansion (MTE) displacements. In order to evaluate the impact of thermal expansion on GPS heights, the MTE displacements of 80 IGS stations with less data discontinuities are selected to compare with their observed GPS vertical (OGV) displacements with the modeled surface loading (MSL) displacements removed in advance. Quantitative analysis results show the maximum annual and semiannual amplitudes of the MTE are 6.65 mm (NOVJ) and 0.51 mm (IISC), respectively, and the maximum peak-to-peak oscillation of the MTE displacements can be 19.4 mm. The average annual amplitude reductions are 0.75 mm and 1.05 mm respectively after removing the MTE and MSL displacements from the OGV, indicating the seasonal oscillation induced by thermal expansion is equivalent to >75% of the impact of surface loadings. However, there are rarely significant reductions for the semiannual amplitude. Given the result in this study that thermal expansion can explain 17.3% of the annual amplitude in GPS heights on average, it must be precisely modeled both in GPS precise data processing and GPS time series analysis, especially for those stations located in the middle and high latitudes with larger annual temperature oscillation, or stations with higher monument.\n\nLarge displacement spring-like electro-mechanical thermal actuators with insulator constraint beams\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLuo, J. K.; Fu, Y. Q.; Flewitt, A. J.; Spearing, S. M.; Fleck, N. A.; Milne, W. I.\n\n2005-07-01\n\nA number of in-plane spring-like micro-electro-thermal-actuators with large displacements were proposed. The devices take the advantage of the large difference in the thermal expansion coefficients between the conductive arms and the insulator clamping beams. The constraint beams in one type (the spring) of these devices are horizontally positioned to restrict the expansion of the active arms in the x-direction, and to produce a displacement in the y-direction only. In other two types of actuators (the deflector and the contractor), the constraint beams are positioned parallel to the active arms. When the constraint beams are on the inside of the active arms, the actuator produces an outward deflection in the y-direction. When they are on the outside of the active arms, the actuator produces an inward contraction. Analytical model and finite element analysis were used to simulate the performances. It showed that at a constant temperature, analytical model is sufficient to predict the displacement of these devices. The displacements are all proportional to the temperature and the number of the chevron sections. A two-mask process is under development to fabricate these devices, using Si3N4 as the insulator beams, and electroplated Ni as the conductive beams.\n\nField survey of occupants thermal comfort in rooms with displacement ventilation\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nPitchurov, G.; Naidenov, K.; Melikov, Arsen Krikor\n\n2002-01-01\n\nField survey of occupantsÂ´ response to the thermal environment in eight office buildings with displacement ventilation was performed. The response of 227 occupants (94 males and 133 females) was collected and analysed. A neutral thermal sensation was reported by 37% of the occupants, and between...... slightly cool and slightly warm by more than 85% of the occupants. The occupantsÂ´ thermal sensation was close to the predictions by the PMV index. About 24% of the surveyed occupants complained that they were daily bothered by draught mainly at lower leg. Presence of draught discomfort was verified even...\n\nDisplacements of Metallic Thermal Protection System Panels During Reentry\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDaryabeigi, Kamran; Blosser, Max L.; Wurster, Kathryn E.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nBowing of metallic thermal protection systems for reentry of a previously proposed single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle was studied. The outer layer of current metallic thermal protection system concepts typically consists of a honeycomb panel made of a high temperature nickel alloy. During portions of reentry when the thermal protection system is exposed to rapidly varying heating rates, a significant temperature gradient develops across the honeycomb panel thickness, resulting in bowing of the honeycomb panel. The deformations of the honeycomb panel increase the roughness of the outer mold line of the vehicle, which could possibly result in premature boundary layer transition, resulting in significantly higher downstream heating rates. The aerothermal loads and parameters for three locations on the centerline of the windward side of this vehicle were calculated using an engineering code. The transient temperature distributions through a metallic thermal protection system were obtained using 1-D finite volume thermal analysis, and the resulting displacements of the thermal protection system were calculated. The maximum deflection of the thermal protection system throughout the reentry trajectory was 6.4 mm. The maximum ratio of deflection to boundary layer thickness was 0.032. Based on previously developed distributed roughness correlations, it was concluded that these defections will not result in tripping the hypersonic boundary layer.\n\nGeneral displaced SU(1, 1) number states: Revisited\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDehghani, A., E-mail: alireza.dehghani@gmail.com, E-mail: a-dehghani@tabrizu.ac.ir [Physics Department, Payame Noor University, P.O. Box 19395-3697 Tehran (Iran, Islamic Republic of)\n\n2014-04-15\n\nThe most general displaced number states, based on the bosonic and an irreducible representation of the Lie algebra symmetry of su(1, 1) and associated with the Calogero-Sutherland model are introduced. Here, we utilize the Barut-Girardello displacement operator instead of the Klauder-Perelomov counterpart, to construct new kind of the displaced number states which can be classified in nonlinear coherent states regime, too, with special nonlinearity functions. They depend on two parameters, and can be converted into the well-known Barut-Girardello coherent and number states, respectively, depending on which of the parameters equal to zero. A discussion of the statistical properties of these states is included. Significant are their squeezing properties and anti-bunching effects which can be raised by increasing the energy quantum number. Depending on the particular choice of the parameters of the above scenario, we are able to determine the status of compliance with flexible statistics. Major parts of the issue is spent on something that these states, in fact, should be considered as new kind of photon-added coherent states, too. Which can be reproduced through an iterated action of a creation operator on new nonlinear Barut-Girardello coherent states. Where the latter carry, also, outstanding statistical features.\n\nQuantum properties of a superposition of squeezed displaced two-mode vacuum and single-photon states\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nEl-Orany, Faisal A A; Obada, A-S F; M Asker, Zafer; Perina, J\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we study some quantum properties of a superposition of displaced squeezed two-mode vacuum and single-photon states, such as the second-order correlation function, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, quadrature squeezing, quasiprobability distribution functions and purity. These type of states include two mechanisms, namely interference in phase space and entanglement. We show that these states can exhibit sub-Poissonian statistics, squeezing and deviate from the classical Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Moreover, the amount of entanglement in the system can be increased by increasing the squeezing mechanism. In the framework of the quasiprobability distribution functions, we show that the single-mode state can tend to the thermal state based on the correlation mechanism. A generation scheme for such states is given.\n\nA displacement based FE formulation for steady state problems\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nYu, Y.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nIn this thesis a new displacement based formulation is developed for elasto-plastic deformations in steady state problems. In this formulation the displacements are the primary variables, which is in contrast to the more common formulations in terms of the velocities as the primary variables. In a\n\nMonolithic micro-electro-thermal actuator integrated with a lateral displacement sensor\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZhang, Yan; Choi, Young-Soo; Lee, Dong-Weon\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThis paper presents monolithically fabricated horizontal thermal actuators integrated with piezoresistive sensors for in situ displacement sensing. The great advantage of a hybrid system is the use of closed feedback control for improving the transient response of a thermal actuator and positioning accuracy. It consists of two 'hot arms' made of doped silicon for Joule heating-induced thermal expansion when a current flow passes through them. The piezoresistor is embedded in the base of the 'cold arm' flexure for monitoring the tip deflection and for performance characterization. This 'cold arm' is not a part of the electrical circuit, which further improves the heat power efficiency and the measurement accuracy. Optimization is achieved mainly through modification of the geometry as well as the fabrication process. The fabricated micro-electro-thermal actuator with an integrated sensor is intended for use as a scanning cantilever in atomic force microscope or as a sample holder to drive the moving object through arrays configuration.\n\nNumerical simulation of displacement instabilities of surface grooves on an alumina forming alloy during thermal cycling oxidation\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLi, Feng Xun; Kang, Ki Ju [Chonnam National University, Gwangju (Korea, Republic of); Ding, Jun [Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing (China)\n\n2009-08-15\n\nDisplacement instability of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) is a fundamental source of failure in thermal barrier systems. In this work, a finite element analysis has been performed to analyze the displacement instability occurring at a heat resistant metal with superficial TGO subjected to thermal cycling. Lateral and in-plane growth of the TGO which happens during high temperature is simulated by means of material property change from the substrate metal to the TGO. Most of the material properties including the TGO growth are based on the results experimentally obtained in-house. Results of the finite element analyses agree well with the experimental observation, which proves the accuracy and validity of this simulation. The technique will be useful for future work on more complicated phenomena such as deformation under thermo-mechanical cycling\n\nEvaluation of thermal displacement behavior of high temperature piping system in power-up test of HTTR. No. 1 results up to 20 MW operation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHanawa, Satoshi; Kojima, Takao; Sumita, Junya; Tachibana, Yukio\n\n2002-03-01\n\nTemperature of the primary cooling system of the High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor, HTTR, becomes very high because the coolant temperature at the reactor outlet reaches 950degC, and 400degC at inlet of the reactor. Therefore, it is important to confirm the thermal displacement behavior of the high temperature piping system in the primary cooling system from the viewpoint of the structural integrity. Moreover, newly designed 3-dimensional floating support system is adopted to the cooling system, it is meaningful to verify the thermal displacement behavior of the piping system applied the 3-dimensional floating support system. In the power-up test (up to 20 MW operation), thermal displacement behavior of the high temperature piping system was measured. This paper describes the experimental and analytical results of thermal displacement characteristics of the high temperature piping system. The results showed that the resistance force induced from the supporting system effects to the thermal displacement behavior of cooling system, and the analytical results have a good agreement with the experimental results by optimizing the resistant force of the floating support system. Additionally, structural integrity at the 30 MW operation was confirmed by the analysis.

A fracture of 265 m length, 30 deg dip angle, 5 GPa/m shear stiffness and 30 deg friction angle gave 4.5 cm shear displacement. In the two-dimensional UDEC models, the fracture extension is defined as the length L along the dip direction of the fracture. In reality, however, the three-dimensional geometry of the fracture will influence the shear magnitude. Results from additional three-dimensional analyses (using FLAC{sup 3D} ) offer a comparison between two cases regarding the three-dimensional extension of a fracture. A model assuming a fracture with infinite extension in the strike direction, and a length L in the dip direction, i.e. the 2-D assumption made in the UDEC analyses, gives 1.4 times larger fracture shear displacement than a corresponding model with a circular fracture of diameter L. Among the different parameters varied between models in this study, the fracture friction length, fracture friction angle and shear stiffness are found to be the most important for the heat induced shear displacement on the fracture plane. With regard to the current safety limit for allowed fracture shear displacements (10 cm), the following approximate layout restriction i suggested: Central parts of fractures dipping in the range of 30-45 deg with a minimum length of 700 metres in the dip direction, and a friction angle smaller than about 15 deg or shear stiffness in the order of 0.005 GPa/m or less, should not be allowed to intersect the deposition holes. This recommendation is only valid for the over all conditions assumed in this study. A significantly different initial stress state or change in thermal loading could lead to a different layout criterion.\n\nInternal Environmental Displacement: A Growing Challenge to the United States Welfare State\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMichelle A. Meyer\n\n2013-04-01\n\nFull Text Available While the greatest potential for environmental displacement occurs in poorer nations, internal displacement has resulted from environmental change and disasters in the United States; and climate change will likely amplify this movement. I describe how environmental displacement is a policy drift that reduces the effectiveness of current welfare state policies to protect US populations from the risk of impoverishment. Evidence from previous disasters indicates environmental displacees have particular assistance needs. I identify the four main assistance needs in my Environmental Displacement and Resilience Model then use this model to evaluate whether current policies address housing, finances, health, and discrimination needs of those displaced. My analysis highlights a gap between the countryâs response to disasters and the current welfare state social safety nets. Without disaster and welfare policy changes environmental displacement will continue to be a policy drift that leave displacees vulnerable to social and economic marginalization.

Mixed zone (MZ oxide often grows at the interface between the alumina layer and top coat in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs at high temperature dwell times accompanied by the formation of alumina. The newly formed MZ destroys interface integrity and significantly affects the displacement instabilities of TGO. In this work, a finite element model based on material property changes was constructed to investigate the effects of MZ on the displacement instabilities of TGO. MZ formation was simulated by gradually changing the metal material properties into MZ upon thermal cycling. Quantitative data show that MZ formation induces an enormous stress in TGO, resulting in a sharp change of displacement compared to the alumina layer. The displacement instability increases with an increase in the MZ growth rate, growth strain, and thickness. Thus, the formation of a MZ accelerates the failure of TBCs, which is in agreement with previous experimental observations. These results provide data for the understanding of TBC failure mechanisms associated with MZ formation and of how to prolong TBC working life.\n\nCoulomb displacement energies of the T=1, J=0 states of A=42 nuclei\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSato, H.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nCoulomb displacement energies of the T=1, J=0 + and 6 1 + states of A=42 nuclei are analyzed with previously known charge dependent forces and effects, and with the available Hartree-Fock single-particle wave functions. From the study of the Coulomb displacement energies of the 6 1 + states it is found that the present knowledge on the charge dependence, including a phenomenological charge symmetry breaking force previously introduced so as to help explain the Nolen-Schiffer anomaly, gives a sufficient and consistent explanation for both single-particle and two-particle systems. From the study of the 0 + states, it is found that the Coulomb displacement energies of the second 0 2 + states can be explained with a compensation between the smaller Coulomb energies of the second lowest two-particle state and larger ones of the deformed 4p-2h state.

Interestingly, such itinerant quantum microwaves can be generated in the form of squeezed photon states by Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPA). We employ a specific ''dual-path'' setup for both state reconstruction and JPA characterization. Displacement operations are performed by using a directional coupler after the squeezing. We compare our results with theory predictions. In particular, we discuss our experiments in the context of remote state preparation and quantum teleportation with propagating microwaves.\n\nDeploying Difference: Security Threat Narratives and State Displacement from Protected Areas\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nElizabeth Lunstrum\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available State actors are increasingly treating protected areas as sites of security threats and policing resident communities as though they are the cause of this insecurity. This is translating into community eviction from protected areas that is authorised by security concerns and logics and hence not merely conservation concerns. We ground this claim by drawing upon empirical work from two borderland conservation areas: Mozambique's Limpopo National Park (LNP and Guatemala's Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR. In both cases, we show how these security-provoked evictions are authorised by the mobilisation of interlocking axes of difference that articulate notions of territorial trespass with that of a racialised enemy. Rather than a new problem or phenomena, we show how these axes are rooted in prior histories of state actors rendering racialised subjects dangerous, Cold War histories in both cases and a longer colonial history with the LNP. We also show how standing behind these evictions is the nation-state and its practices of protected area territorialisation. From here, we illustrate how the rationale behind displacement from protected areas matters, as evictions become more difficult to contest once they are authorised by security considerations. The cases, however, differ in one key respect. While displacement from the LNP is an instance of conservation-induced displacement (CID, although one re-worked by security considerations, eviction from the MBR is motivated more centrally by security concerns yet takes advantage of protected area legislation. The study hence offers insight into a growing literature on conservation-security encounters and into different articulations of conservation, security, and displacement.\n\nReliability of buildings in service limit state for maximum horizontal displacements\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA. G. B. Corelhano\n\nFull Text Available Brazilian design code ABNT NBR6118:2003 - Design of Concrete Structures - Procedures - [1] proposes the use of simplified models for the consideration of non-linear material behavior in the evaluation of horizontal displacements in buildings. These models penalize stiffness of columns and beams, representing the effects of concrete cracking and avoiding costly physical non-linear analyses. The objectives of the present paper are to investigate the accuracy and uncertainty of these simplified models, as well as to evaluate the reliabilities of structures designed following ABNT NBR6118:2003[1&] in the service limit state for horizontal displacements. Model error statistics are obtained from 42 representative plane frames. The reliabilities of three typical (4, 8 and 12 floor buildings are evaluated, using the simplified models and a rigorous, physical and geometrical non-linear analysis. Results show that the 70/70 (column/beam stiffness reduction model is more accurate and less conservative than the 80/40 model. Results also show that ABNT NBR6118:2003 [1] design criteria for horizontal displacement limit states (masonry damage according to ACI 435.3R-68(1984 [10] are conservative, and result in reliability indexes which are larger than those recommended in EUROCODE [2] for irreversible service limit states.\n\nDisplacement Ventilation\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nBjÃ¸rn, Erik; Mattsson, Magnus; Sandberg, Mats\n\nFull-scale experiments were made in a displacement ventilated room with two breathing thermal manikins to study the effect of movements and breathing on the vertical contaminant distribution, and on the personal exposure of occupants.

The experimental conditions comprised displacement ventilation alone (room air temperature of 23 Â°C, 26 Â°C, 29 Â°C) and DPV with displacement ventilation (26 Â°C, 29 Â°C), both operating at supply air temperatures 3, 5 or 6K lower than room air temperature, as well as mixing ventilation (23 Â°C, 3 K......). During one hour exposure participants answered questionnaires regarding PAQ and thermal comfort. PAQ was significantly better with DPV than without DPV at the same background conditions.

This work analyzes the thermal effect of the lubricating oil presence in the air during compression with the scope of exploiting it as a thermal ballast to mitigate both the gas temperature rise and its compression work. The bibliographic review shows that other authors suggested that oil can have positive effects if properly injected. Here an energy balance analysis is executed with the scope of deriving relations for the gasâliquid compression in analogy with those typical for the gas-only compression and of confirming that ideally the liquid presence may have beneficial effects, making the gasâliquid compression even better than 1- and 2-time intercooled gas compressions. Given these positive results, a heat transfer analysis is conducted to model the thermal interaction between gas and oil droplets within a mid-size rotary vane air compressor. A droplet diameter of the order of 100 Î¼m leads to large reductions of both temperature increase and compression work: air can exit the discharge port at a temperature as low as 60 Â°C and compression work can be lowered by 23â28% with respect to conventional compressors. Finally, a test rig is constructed and operated to investigate a large-flow and large-angle oil nozzle taken from the market showing that, at the operating conditions of a compressor, oil breaks up into small droplets and undefined structures with large exchange surfaces. -- Highlights: âº Exploitation of thermal effect of oil in gas compressors is assessed numerically. âº Oil in 100 Î¼m-diameter droplets mitigates effectively the gas temperature rise. âº Discharge temperature and compression work result to be much smaller than typical. âº An experimental setup is used to investigate oil atomization via commercial nozzles. âº A tested nozzle creates fine oil droplets and structures at conditions of\n\nCalculated thermally induced displacements and stresses for heater experiments at Stripa, Sweden. Linear thermoelastic models using constant material properties\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChan, T.; Cook, N.G.W.\n\n1979-12-01\n\nThermally induced displacements and stresses have been calculated by finite element analysis to guide the design, operation, and data interpretation of the in situ heating experiments in a granite formation at Stripa, Sweden. There are two full-scale tests with electrical heater canisters comparable in size and power to those envisaged for reprocessed high level waste canisters and a time-scaled test. To provide a simple theoretical basis for data analysis, linear thermoelasticity was assumed. Constant (temperature-independent) thermal and mechanical rock properties were used in the calculations. These properties were determined by conventional laboratory testing on small intact core specimens recovered from the Stripa test site. Two-dimensional axisymmetric models were used for the full-scale experiments, and three-dimensional models for the time-scaled experiment. Highest compressive axial and tangential stresses are expected at the wall of the heater borehole. For the 3.6 kW full-scale heated experiment, maximum compressive tangential stress was predicted to be below the unconfined compressive strength of Stripa granite, while for the 5 kW experiment, the maximum was approximately equal to the compressive strength before the concentric ring of eight 1 kW peripheral heaters was activated, but would exceed that soon afterwards. Three zones of tensile thermomechanical stresses will occur in each full-scale experiment. Maximum vertical displacements range from a fraction of a millimeter over most of the instrumented area of the time-scaled experiment to a few millimeters in the higher-power full-scale experiment. Radial displacements are typically half or less than vertical displacements. The predicted thermomechanical displacements and stresses have been stored in an on-site computer to facilitate instant graphic comparison with field data as the latter are collected\n\nDisplacement ventilation\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nKosonen, Risto; Melikov, Arsen Krikor; Mundt, Elisabeth\n\nThe aim of this Guidebook is to give the state-of-the art knowledge of the displacement ventilation technology, and to simplify and improve the practical design procedure.

A square slab SAPD treated with ionizing radiation was tested. The SAPD becomes a continuous homogeneous and isotropic viscoelastic medium due to the generation of randomly coiled collagen fibers formed from their bundle-like structure in the dermis. A harmonic TIESW then propagates on the surface of the SAPD as measured by a nanometer-scaled strain-stress response under thermal equilibrium conditions at room temperature. TIESW oscillation frequency was noninvasively measured in real time by monitoring the transverse displacement of the TIESW on the SAPD surface. Because the elastic shear modulus is highly sensitive to absorbed doses of ionizing radiation, this proposed biodosimeter can become a highly sensitive and noninvasive method for quantitatively determining tissue-absorbed dosage in terms of TIESWâs oscillation frequency. Detection sensitivity at 1 cGy and dynamic ranges covering 1 to 40 cGy and 80 to 500 cGy were demonstrated.\n\nDisplaced squeezed number states: Position space representation, inner product, and some applications\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nMÃ¸ller, Klaus Braagaard; JÃ¸rgensen, Thomas Godsk; Dahl, Jens Peder\n\n1996-01-01\n\nFor some applications the overall phase of a quantum state is crucial.

Indeed, just a simple comparison has been performed between the standard coherent state and nonlinear coherent state for the formation of NDNSs. In the present paper, after expressing enough physical motivation of our procedure, four distinct classes of NDNSs are presented by applying algebraic and group treatments. To achieve this purpose, by considering the DNSs and recalling the nonlinear coherent states formalism, the NDNSs are logically defined through an algebraic consideration. In addition, by using a particular class of GilmoreâPerelomov-type of SU(1, 1) and a class of SU(2) coherent states, the NDNSs are introduced via group-theoretical approach. Then, in order to examine the nonclassical behavior of these states, sub-Poissonian statistics by evaluating Mandel parameter and Wigner quasi-probability distribution function associated with the obtained NDNSs are discussed, in detail.

The expression for a teleported Fock state is also derived as a particular case of DFS's teleportation.

The dependences of the thermal entanglement of the teleported state on the DM coupling constant, the temperature and the entanglement of the noisy quantum channel are studied in detail for both the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic cases. The result shows that a minimum entanglement of the noisy quantum channel must be provided in order to realize the entanglement teleportation. The values of fidelity of the teleported state are also studied for these two cases. It is found that under certain conditions, we can transfer an initial state with a better fidelity than that for any classical communication protocol.\n\nTime-optimal thermalization of single-mode Gaussian states\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCarlini, Alberto; Mari, Andrea; Giovannetti, Vittorio\n\n2014-11-01\n\nWe consider the problem of time-optimal control of a continuous bosonic quantum system subject to the action of a Markovian dissipation. In particular, we consider the case of a one-mode Gaussian quantum system prepared in an arbitrary initial state and which relaxes to the steady state due to the action of the dissipative channel. We assume that the unitary part of the dynamics is represented by Gaussian operations which preserve the Gaussian nature of the quantum state, i.e., arbitrary phase rotations, bounded squeezing, and unlimited displacements. In the ideal ansatz of unconstrained quantum control (i.e., when the unitary phase rotations, squeezing, and displacement of the mode can be performed instantaneously), we study how control can be optimized for speeding up the relaxation towards the fixed point of the dynamics and we analytically derive the optimal relaxation time. Our model has potential and interesting applications to the control of modes of electromagnetic radiation and of trapped levitated nanospheres.\n\nThermal microwave states acting on a superconducting qubit\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGoetz, Jan; Mueting, Miriam; Haeberlein, Max; Wulschner, Friedrich; Fischer, Michael; Deppe, Frank; Fedorov, Kirill; Huebl, Hans [Walther-Meissner-Institut, Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 85748 Garching (Germany); Physik-Department, TU Muenchen, 85748 Garching (Germany); Xie, Edwar; Eder, Peter; Deppe, Frank; Gross, Rudolf [Walther-Meissner-Institut, Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 85748 Garching (Germany); Physik-Department, TU Muenchen, 85748 Garching (Germany); Nanosystems Initiative Munich (NIM), Schellingstrasse 4, 80799 Muenchen (Germany); Marx, Achim [Walther-Meissner-Institut, Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 85748 Garching (Germany)\n\n2016-07-01\n\nWe analyze the influence of broadband thermal states in the microwave regime on the coherence properties of a superconducting (transmon) qubit coupled to a transmission line resonator. We generate the thermal states inside the resonator by heating a 30 dB attenuator to emit blackbody radiation into a transmission line. In the absence of thermal fluctuations, the qubit coherence time is limited by relaxation. We find that the relaxation rate is almost unaffected by the presence of a thermal field inside the resonator. However, such states induce significant dephasing which increases quadratically with the number of thermal photons, whereas for a coherent population of the resonator, the increase shows a linear behavior. These results confirm the different photon statistics, being Poissonian for a coherent population and super-Poissonian for a thermal population of the resonator.\n\nTeleportation of displaced Fock states: Fidelity and their teleported photon number distributions\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nQuintero, William; Ladera, Celso L, E-mail: clladera@usb.ve [Departamento de Fisica, Universidad Simon BolIvar, Apdo. 89000, Caracas 1086 (Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of)\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe consider the teleportation of displaced Fock states which are highly non-classical states of the quantized electromagnetic field which have a set of remarkable quantum properties that include the peculiar oscillations of their photon number distributions.

The 1948 Genocide Convention incorporates extermination by mass killing and elimination through forced migration as two distinct elements of genocide. Genocide scholars and public discourse emphasize extermination by killing, but they give far less explanatory attention to the elimination processes that the Genocide Convention describes as 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction'. (Article II United Nations 1948.) In Darfur, understanding the latter processes requires theoretical attention to the history of food, water, and famine and detailed methodological attention to temporal processes of displacement. We demonstrate how intentional state-led attacks on food and water massively dislodged Black Africans in Darfur from February 2003 to August 2004. The political leadership of the Sudanese state dehumanized and forcibly displaced Black Africans from their homes in Darfur to camps where they largely remain, not only through mass killings and rapes, but also by destroying life-sustaining access to food and water, leading to the genocidal elimination of group life in this region.

S. L.; Kastoryano, Michael J.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nPreparing quantum thermal states on a quantum computer is in general a difficult task. We provide a procedure to prepare a thermal state on a quantum computer with a logarithmic depth circuit of local quantum channels assuming that the thermal state correlations satisfy the following two properties: (i) the correlations between two regions are exponentially decaying in the distance between the regions, and (ii) the thermal state is an approximate Markov state for shielded regions. We require both properties to hold for the thermal state of the Hamiltonian on any induced subgraph of the original lattice. Assumption (ii) is satisfied for all commuting Gibbs states, while assumption (i) is satisfied for every model above a critical temperature. Both assumptions are satisfied in one spatial dimension. Moreover, both assumptions are expected to hold above the thermal phase transition for models without any topological order at finite temperature. As a building block, we show that exponential decay of correlation (for thermal states of Hamiltonians on all induced subgraphs) is sufficient to efficiently estimate the expectation value of a local observable. Our proof uses quantum belief propagation, a recent strengthening of strong sub-additivity, and naturally breaks down for states with topological order.\n\nRod displacement measurements by x-ray CT and its impact on thermal-hydraulics in tight-lattice rod bundle (Joint research)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMitsutake, Toru; Misawa, Takeharu; Kureta, Masatoshi; Akimoto, Hajime\n\n2005-06-01\n\nIn tight-lattice simulated rod bundles with about 1 mm gap between rods, a rod displacement might affect thermal-hydraulic characteristics since the displacement has a strong impact on the flow area change along the heated section. It should be important to estimate how large the rod position displacement could quantitatively affect critical power for the tight-lattice rod bundle from the point of improvement of prediction capability of subchannel analysis. In the present study, the inside-structure observation of the simulated seven-rod bundle of Reduced Moderation Water Reactor (RMWR) was made through the whole length of the test assembly. Based on the measured rod position data, the relation between the rod position displacement and the heat transfer characteristics was investigated experimentally and through the two kinds of subchannel analysis, the nominal rod position case and the measured rod position case, the effect on the predicted critical power was estimated. The high-energy X-ray computer tomograph (CT) of Fuels Monitoring Facilities (FMF) at the O-arai Engineering Center in Japan Nuclear Cycle Institute (JNC) was applied for the inside-structure observation of the test assembly. The CT view of the cross sections within the test assembly assured the hexagonal rod position arrangement was almost the same as expected by design. The measured data with the X-ray CT facility showed that all rod displacements were small, 0.5 millimeters at maximum and 0.2 millimeters in average. In the heat transfer experiments for the seven-rod bundle, the boiling transition (BT) position and the rod surface temperature behavior was measured. All thermocouples on the center rod downstream from the BT-onset axial height showed almost simultaneous temperature increase due to BT. And the thermocouples located on the same axial heights showed quite similar time-variation behaviors in the vapor cooling heat transfer regime.

Interatomic forces were represented by either the Gibson II (Cu) or Johnson-Erginsoy (Ni) potentials in most of this work, although some simulations using ''Embedded Atom Method'' potentials, e.g., for threshold events in Ni 3 Al, are also presented. The results indicate that the primary state of damage produced by displacement cascades is controlled by two phenomena, replacement collision sequences during the collisional phase of the cascade and local melting during the thermal spike. As expected, the collisional phase is rather similar in Cu and Ni, however, the thermal spike is of longer duration and has a more pronounced influence in Cu than Ni. When the ambient temperature of the lattice is increased, the melt zones are observed to both increase in size and cool more slowly. This has the effect of reducing defect production and enhancing atomic mixing and disordering. The implications of these results for defect production, cascade collapse, atomic disordering will be discussed. 34 refs., 7 figs., 2 tabs\n\nMicroscale solid-state thermal diodes enabling ambient temperature thermal circuits for energy applications\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nWang, Song\n\n2017-05-10\n\nThermal diodes, or devices that transport thermal energy asymmetrically, analogous to electrical diodes, hold promise for thermal energy harvesting and conservation, as well as for phononics or information processing. The junction of a phase change material and phase invariant material can form a thermal diode; however, there are limited constituent materials available for a given target temperature, particularly near ambient. In this work, we demonstrate that a micro and nanoporous polystyrene foam can house a paraffin-based phase change material, fused to PMMA, to produce mechanically robust, solid-state thermal diodes capable of ambient operation with Young\\\\'s moduli larger than 11.5 MPa and 55.2 MPa above and below the melting transition point, respectively. Moreover, the composites show significant changes in thermal conductivity above and below the melting point of the constituent paraffin and rectification that is well-described by our previous theory and the MaxwellâEucken model. Maximum thermal rectifications range from 1.18 to 1.34. We show that such devices perform reliably enough to operate in thermal diode bridges, dynamic thermal circuits capable of transforming oscillating temperature inputs into single polarity temperature differences â analogous to an electrical diode bridge with widespread implications for transient thermal energy harvesting and conservation. Overall, our approach yields mechanically robust, solid-state thermal diodes capable of engineering design from a mathematical model of phase change and thermal transport, with implications for energy harvesting.\n\nAssessing interventions available to internally displaced persons in Abia state, Nigeria.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEnwereji, Ee\n\n2009-03-01\n\nInternally displaced persons are faced with several problems, such as sexual violence, and deserve appropriate intervention, especially in view of the increasing prevalence of HIV/AIDS and other infections in Nigeria. This study attempts to assess interventions offered by governmental authorities and organizations to internally displaced persons and to identify gaps in services as well as to identify what needs to be strengthened. The author reviewed relevant published and unpublished documents and collected data by interviews with semi-structured questions. Twenty-five organizations and government and police departments and 55 internally displaced persons were interviewed. None of the organizations, including governmental institutions, provided social services or assistance in prevention of HIV/AIDS to internally displaced persons. The main services provided by 17 (68%) organizations to 43 (78.2%) of internally displaced persons were provision of food, clothing and money, but these were provided on an ad hoc basis. Only 3 organizations (12%) included spiritual counseling and resolution of communal conflicts in their services. The fact that most organizations, including the government, do not have services for internally displaced persons indicates lack of support for internally displaced persons. The government should be urged to include these people in most prevention services, including HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. This should help reduce the national prevalence of HIV/AIDS.\n\nImpact of the operation of non-displaced feedwater heaters on the performance of Solar Aided Power Generation plants\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nQin, Jiyun; Hu, Eric; Nathan, Graham J.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ Impact of non-displaced feedwater heater on plantâs performance has been evaluated. â¢ Two operation strategies for non-displaced feedwater heater has been proposed. â¢ Constant temperature strategy is generally better. â¢ Constant mass flow rate strategy is suit for rich solar thermal input. - Abstract: Solar Aided Power Generation is a technology in which low grade solar thermal energy is used to displace the high grade heat of the extraction steam in a regenerative Rankine cycle power plant for feedwater preheating purpose. The displaced extraction steam can then expand further in the steam turbine to generate power. In such a power plant, using the (concentrated) solar thermal energy to displace the extraction steam to high pressure/temperature feedwater heaters (i.e. displaced feedwater heaters) is the most popular arrangement. Namely the extraction steam to low pressure/temperature feedwater heaters (i.e. non-displaced feedwater heaters) is not displaced by the solar thermal energy. In a Solar Aided Power Generation plants, when solar radiation/input changes, the extraction steam to the displaced feedwater heaters requires to be adjusted according to the solar radiation. However, for the extraction steams to the non-displaced feedwater heaters, it can be either adjusted accordingly following so-called constant temperature strategy or unadjusted i.e. following so-called constant mass flow rate strategy, when solar radiation/input changes. The previous studies overlooked the operation of non-displaced feedwater heaters, which has also impact on the whole plantâs performance. This paper aims to understand/reveal the impact of the two different operation strategies for non-displaced feedwater heaters on the plantâs performance. In this paper, a 300 MW Rankine cycle power plant, in which the extraction steam to high pressure/temperature feedwater heaters is displaced by the solar thermal energy, is used as study case for this purpose. It\n\nInternal Displacement, the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the Principles Normative Status, and the Need for their Effective Domestic Implementation in Colombia.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRobert K. Goldman\n\n2010-05-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper briefly examines the phenomenon of internal displacement world-wide and the genesis of the United Nationâs mandate to deal with this problem. It examines key conclusions of a UN sponsored study which found that existing international law contained signifi cant gaps and grey areas in terms of meeting the needs of internally displaced persons. It also examines the origins and the content of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and the normative status of these Principles. It suggests that, while not binding as such on states, the Guiding Principles have nonetheless become the most authoritative expression of minimum international standards applicable to the internally displaced and that based on state practice many, if not all, of these principles may eventually become part of customary international law. The paper also discusses the need for effective domestic implementation of the Guiding Principles, and examines how governmental authorities, the Constitutional Court and civil society organizations in Colombia, as well as inter-governmental bodies, have responded to the crisis of internal displacement in the country. While noting the adequacy of Colombiaâs legislative framework on internal displacement, the paper concludes that the State has not taken the measures required to prevent future displacement or to effectively meet the protection and assistance needs of its displaced citizens.\n\nDisplacer Diameter Effect in Displacer Pulse Tube Refrigerator\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhu, Shaowei\n\n2017-12-01\n\nGas driving displacer pulse tube refrigerators are one of the work recovery type of pulse tube refrigerators whose theoretical efficiency is the same as Stirling refrigerators'. Its cooling power is from the displacement of the displacer. Displace diameter, rod diameter and pressure drop of the regenerator influence the displacement, which are investigated by numerical simulation. It is shown that the displacement ratio of the displacer over the piston is almost not affected by the displacer diameter at the same rod diameter ratio, or displacer with different diameters almost has the same performance.\n\nThe Three Gorges: the unexamined toll of development-induced displacement\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMartin Stein\n\n1998-04-01\n\nFull Text Available In China, the context of forced displacement in its broadest sense centres on four issues: (1 coercive displacement for development; (2 political persecution resulting in controlled displacement; (3 massive labour dislocations; and (4 disaster-induced displacement. This article looks at the role of the state in displacement, focusing on the first of these issues: development-induced displacement.\n\nFinite element modelling and experimental characterization of an electro-thermally actuated silicon-polymer micro gripper\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKrecinic, F; Duc, T Chu; Sarro, P M; Lau, G K\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis paper presents simulation and experimental characterization of an electro-thermally actuated micro gripper. This micro actuator can conceptually be seen as a bi-morph structure of SU-8 and silicon, actuated by thermal expansion of the polymer. The polymer micro gripper with an embedded comb-like silicon skeleton is designed to reduce unwanted out-of-plane bending of the actuator, while offering a large gripper stroke. The temperature and displacement field of the micro gripper structure is determined using a two-dimensional finite element analysis. This analysis is compared to experimental data from steady-state and transient measurements of the integrated heater resistance, which depends on the average temperature of the actuator. The stability of the polymer actuator is evaluated by recording the transient behaviour of the actual jaw displacements. The maximum single jaw displacement of this micro gripper design is 34 Âµm at a driving voltage of 4 V and an average actuator temperature of 170 Â°C. The transient thermal response is modelled by a first-order system with a characteristic time constant of 11.1 ms. The simulated force capability of the device is 0.57 mN per Âµm jaw displacement\n\nThermality and excited state RÃ©nyi entropy in two-dimensional CFT\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLin, Feng-Li [Department of Physics, National Taiwan Normal University,Taipei 11677, Taiwan (China); Wang, Huajia [Department of Physics, University of Illinois,Urbana-Champaign, IL 61801 (United States); Zhang, Jia-ju [Dipartimento di Fisica, UniversitÃ degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca,Piazza della Scienza 3, I-20126 Milano (Italy); Theoretical Physics Division, Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences,19B Yuquan Rd, Beijing 100049 (China); Theoretical Physics Center for Science Facilities, Chinese Academy of Sciences,19B Yuquan Rd, Beijing 100049 (China)\n\n2016-11-21\n\nWe evaluate one-interval RÃ©nyi entropy and entanglement entropy for the excited states of two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) on a cylinder, and examine their differences from the ones for the thermal state. We assume the interval to be short so that we can use operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators to calculate RÃ©nyi entropy in terms of sum of one-point functions of OPE blocks. We find that the entanglement entropy for highly excited state and thermal state behave the same way after appropriate identification of the conformal weight of the state with the temperature. However, there exists no such universal identification for the RÃ©nyi entropy in the short-interval expansion. Therefore, the highly excited state does not look thermal when comparing its RÃ©nyi entropy to the thermal state one. As the RÃ©nyi entropy captures the higher moments of the reduced density matrix but the entanglement entropy only the average, our results imply that the emergence of thermality depends on how refined we look into the entanglement structure of the underlying pure excited state.\n\nLocal thermal equilibrium and KMS states in curved spacetime\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSolveen, Christoph\n\n2012-01-01\n\nOn the example of a free massless and conformally coupled scalar field, it is argued that in quantum field theory in curved spacetimes with the time-like Killing field, the corresponding KMS states (generalized Gibbs ensembles) at parameter Î² > 0 need not possess a definite temperature in the sense of the zeroth law. In fact, these states, although passive in the sense of the second law, are not always in local thermal equilibrium (LTE). A criterion characterizing LTE states with sharp local temperature is discussed. Moreover, a proposal is made for fixing the renormalization freedom of composite fields which serve as âthermal observablesâ and a new definition of the thermal energy of LTE states is introduced. Based on these results, a general relation between the local temperature and the parameter Î² is established for KMS states in (anti) de Sitter spacetime.

Martins Mattar\n\n2012-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The human displacement caused by adverse weather conditions is, and has been for a long time, a natural strategy to adapt to environmental changes. However, the frequency of natural disasters and the negative impact of climate change have increased significantly affecting a growing number of people. Internal and external tensions caused by large-scale displacements, conflicts generated by resource scarcity, increased spread of diseases and geopolitical reordering are among the consequences linked to this phenomenon. The case of the small island nations that will be submerged by the sea level rise is an extreme example that raises fascinating questions. This article aims at analyzing the links of climate change on the dynamics of migration and exploring legal and political implications and possible solutions, in particular, for the populations from small island nations.\n\nThe relationship between the TMJ internal derangement state including rotational displacement and perforation and the clinical characteristics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJeong, Hwan Seok; You Dong Soo\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThis study was designed to reveal the correlationship between the internal derangement state of TMJ and clinical characteristics including pain and mandibular dysfuntion. One hundred and twenty five subjects with TMJ signs and symptoms were chosen for two years. The level of pain and mandibular dysfuntion were evaluated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Craniomandibular Index (CMI). The diagnostic categories of TMJ internal derangement were determined by arthrography and they included normal disc position, anterior disc displacement with reduction (ADDR), rotational disc displacement with reduction (RDDR), andterior disc displacement without reduction (ADDNR), and rotational disc displacement without reduction (RDDNR). Also disc perforation was used as a criteria to divide the diagnostic subgroups. The obtained results were as follows ; 1. The patient distribution of each group was 5 in normal disc position (4%), 40 in ADDR (32%), 30 in RDDR (24%), 34 in ADDNR (27%), and 16 in RDDNR (13%). 2. Perforation was observed in 8% of ADDR, 10% of RDDR, 32% of ADDNR, and 19% of RDDNR. 3. CMI of perforation group was higher than that of reduction or normal group(p 0.05).\n\nLANSCE steady state unperturbed thermal neutron fluxes at 100 Î¼A\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRussell, G.J.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe ''maximum'' unperturbed, steady state thermal neutron flux for LANSCE is calculated to be 2 /times/ 10 13 n/cm 2 -s for 100 Î¼A of 800-MeV protons. This LANSCE neutron flux is a comparable entity to a steady state reactor thermal neutron flux. LANSCE perturbed steady state thermal neutron fluxes have also been calculated. Because LANSCE is a pulsed neutron source, much higher ''peak'' (in time) neutron fluxes can be generated than at a steady state reactor source. 5 refs., 5 figs\n\n[The physiological classification of human thermal states under high environmental temperatures].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBobrov, A F; Kuznets, E I\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThe paper deals with the physiological classification of human thermal states in a hot environment. A review of the basic systems of classifications of thermal states is given, their main drawbacks are discussed. On the basis of human functional state research in a broad range of environmental temperatures the system of evaluation and classification of human thermal states is proposed. New integral one-dimensional multi-parametric criteria for evaluation are used. For the development of these criteria methods of factor, cluster and canonical correlation analyses are applied. Stochastic nomograms capable of identification of human thermal state for different intensity of influence are given. In this case evaluation of intensity is estimated according to one-dimensional criteria taking into account environmental temperature, physical load and time of man's staying in overheating conditions.\n\nLocal temperature in quantum thermal states\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGarcia-Saez, Artur; Ferraro, Alessandro; Acin, Antonio\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWe consider blocks of quantum spins in a chain at thermal equilibrium, focusing on their properties from a thermodynamical perspective. In a classical system the temperature behaves as an intensive magnitude, above a certain block size, regardless of the actual value of the temperature itself. However, a deviation from this behavior is expected in quantum systems. In particular, we see that under some conditions the description of the blocks as thermal states with the same global temperature as the whole chain fails. We analyze this issue by employing the quantum fidelity as a figure of merit, singling out in detail the departure from the classical behavior. As it may be expected, we see that quantum features are more prominent at low temperatures and are affected by the presence of zero-temperature quantum phase transitions. Interestingly, we show that the blocks can be considered indeed as thermal states with a high fidelity, provided an effective local temperature is properly identified. Such a result may originate from typical properties of reduced subsystems of energy-constrained Hilbert spaces. Finally, the relation between local and global temperatures is analyzed as a function of the size of the blocks and the system parameters.\n\nAnalysis of displacement damage and defect production under cascade damage conditions\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nZinkle, S.J.; Singh, B.N.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nand residual defect production must be treated separately. An evaluation of experimental and computer defect production studies indicates that the overall fraction of defects surviving correlated annihilation in an energetic displacement cascade in copper decreases from about 30% of the Norgett......-Robinson-Torrens (NRT) calculated displacements at 4 K to about 10% of the NRT displacements at 300 K. Due to differences in the thermal stability of vacancy versus interstitial clusters, the fractions of freely migrating defects available for inducing microstructural changes at elevated temperatures may be higher...... for vacancies than for interstitials. The available evidence suggests that the fraction of freely migrating vacancies at temperatures relevant for void swelling in copper is greater than or similar to 5% of the calculated NRT displacements....\n\nCoulomb displacement energy of the f sub(7/2) state of the 48Ca\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSato, Hiroshi.\n\n1979-11-01\n\nThe Coulomb displacement energy of the T = 4, J = 0 state of the 48 Ca is analyzed. Modifying a previous method of the calculation of the core polarization correction, it is found that the charge symmetry breaking force, which is introduced previously so as to help explain the Nolen-Schiffer anomaly of the T = 1/2 system, is also needed in this system, while there still exists an ambituity in the type of the force. (author)\n\nA Comparative Study for Modeling Displacement Instabilities due to TGO Formation in TBCs of High-Temperature Components in Nuclear Power Plant\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nXia Huang\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper reports two numerical simulation methods for modeling displacement instabilities around a surface groove in a metal substrate used in nuclear power plant. The amplitude change in the groove, the downward displacement at the base node, and the groove displacement at the periphery were simulated using ABAQUS to compare the results from two methods, as well as the tangential stress in the elements at the groove base and periphery. The comparison showed that for the tangential stress two methods were in close agreement for all thermal cycles. For the amplitude change, the downward displacement, the groove displacement, and the stress distribution, the two methods were in close agreement for the first 3 to 6 thermal cycles. After that, inconsistency increased with the number of thermal cycles. It is interesting that the thermal cycle at which the discrepancy between the two methods began to occur corresponded to a thermally grown oxide (TGO thickness of 1âÎ¼m, which showed the accuracy of the present work over the classic method. It is concluded that the present workâs numerical simulation scheme worked better with a thinner TGO layer than the classic method and could overcome the limitation of TGO thickness by simulating any thickness.\n\nDynamic thermal analysis of machines in running state\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nWang, Lihui\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWith the increasing complexity and dynamism in todayâs machine design and development, more precise, robust and practical approaches and systems are needed to support machine design. Existing design methods treat the targeted machine as stationery. Analysis and simulation are mostly performed at the component level. Although there are some computer-aided engineering tools capable of motion analysis and vibration simulation etc., the machine itself is in the dry-run state. For effective machine design, understanding its thermal behaviours is crucial in achieving the desired performance in real situation. Dynamic Thermal Analysis of Machines in Running State presents a set of innovative solutions to dynamic thermal analysis of machines when they are put under actual working conditions. The objective is to better understand the thermal behaviours of a machine in real situation while at the design stage.

[Dunham Associates, Inc., Minneapolis, MN (United States). Advanced Technologies Group\n\n2001-08-01\n\nTwo-dimensional computational simulations are performed to examine the effect of vertical location of a convective heat source on thermal displacement ventilation systems. In this study, a heat source is modeled with seven different heights from the floor (0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0 m) in a displacement ventilation environment. The flow and temperature fields in thermal displacement ventilation systems vary depending on the location of the heat source. As the heat source rises, the convective heat gain from the heat source to an occupied zone becomes less significant. This effect changes the temperature field and results in the reduction of the cooling load in the occupied zone. The stratification level is also affected by the heat source location at a given flow rate.

Following the behavior of the thermal conductivity coefficient of water, which shows a maximum close to 135 0 C, the thermal conductivity coefficient of heavy water exhibits a maximum near 95 0 C and near saturation pressures. This maximum is displaced to higher temperatures when the pressure is increased. Under the same temperature and pressure conditions the thermal conductivity coefficient of heavy water was lower than for water. The pressure effect was similar for water and heavy water. In the temperature range of our experiments, isotherms of thermal conductivity coefficients were almost linear functions of density\n\n2014 and beyond: implications for displacement\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAidan OâLeary\n\n2014-05-01\n\nFull Text Available 2014 marks a watershed for Afghanistan, with the withdrawal of the International Security Assistance Force after twelve years, and the very real risks this withdrawal poses to the capacity of the Afghan state to meet the many internal and external challenges faced by the country.

However, this state can only be observed directly within sparse boreholes or inferred conclusively from the presence of subglacial lakes. Here we synthesize spatially extensive inferences of the basal thermal state of the Greenland Ice Sheet to better constrain this state. Existing inferences include outputs from the eight thermomechanical ice-flow models included in the SeaRISE effort. New remote-sensing inferences of the basal thermal state are derived from Holocene radiostratigraphy, modern surface velocity and MODIS imagery. Both thermomechanical modeling and remote inferences generally agree that the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream and large portions of the southwestern ice-drainage systems are thawed at the bed, whereas the bed beneath the central ice divides, particularly their west-facing slopes, is frozen. Elsewhere, there is poor agreement regarding the basal thermal state. Both models and remote inferences rarely represent the borehole-observed basal thermal state accurately near NorthGRIP and DYE-3. This synthesis identifies a large portion of the Greenland Ice Sheet (about one third by area) where additional observations would most improve knowledge of its overall basal thermal state.\n\nA synthesis of the basal thermal state of the Greenland Ice Sheet.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMacGregor, Joseph A; Fahnestock, Mark A; Catania, Ginny A; Aschwanden, Andy; Clow, Gary D; Colgan, William T; Gogineni, S Prasad; Morlighem, Mathieu; Nowicki, Sophie M J; Paden, John D; Price, Stephen F; Seroussi, HÃ©lÃ¨ne\n\n2016-08-10\n\nTh"
