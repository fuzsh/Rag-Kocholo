        "text": "American software company\n\nThis article is about the company. For the open-source software it maintains, see Open Source Tripwire.\n\nNot to be confused with Tripwire Interactive.\n\nTripwire, Inc. is a software company based in Portland, Oregon,[3] that focuses on security and compliance automation. It is a subsidiary of technology company Fortra.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nTripwire's intrusion detection software was created in the 1990s by Purdue University graduate student Gene Kim[4] and his professor Gene Spafford.[5][6][7][8] In 1997, Gene Kim co-founded Tripwire, Inc. with rights to the Tripwire name and technology, and produced a commercial version, Tripwire for Servers.\n\nIn 2000, Tripwire released Open Source Tripwire.[9][10]\n\nIn 2005, the firm released Tripwire Enterprise, a product for configuration control by detecting, assessing, reporting and remediating file and configuration changes. In January 2010, it announced the release of Tripwire Log Center, a log and security information and event management (SIEM) software that stores, correlates and reports log and security event data.[citation needed] The two products can be integrated to enable correlation of change and event data. August 21, 2009, the firm acquired Activeworx technologies from CrossTec Corporation.\n\nRevenues grew to $74 million in 2009.[11] In October 2009, the company had 261 employees;[12] that number grew to 336 by June 2010.[13]\n\nBy Mayâ€“June 2010, the company had over 5,500 customers[13] and had announced that it had filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed initial public offering of its common stock.[14] A year later, the company announced its sale to the private equity firm Thoma Bravo, ending its $86 million IPO plans.[15] CEO Jim Johnson cited the firm's failure to reach the $100 million revenue milestone in 2010 as well as changing IPO market expectations as reasons for not going through with the IPO.[16] The day following the acquisition, the company laid off about 50 of its 350 employees.[17]\n\nTripwire acquired nCircle, which focused on asset discovery and vulnerability management, in 2013.[18]\n\nIn December 2014, Belden announced plans to buy Tripwire for $710 million.[19] The acquisition was completed on January 2, 2015.[20] In February 2022, Belden announced to sell Tripwire to HelpSystems (HelpSystems was renamed Fortra later that year).[21]"
