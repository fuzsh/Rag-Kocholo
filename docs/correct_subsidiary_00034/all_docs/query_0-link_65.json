Since 1979 Writing A Good Backup Plan A Primer On Priorities & Methods by David Garrett Here's a little tale to think about . . . A firm with a Web portal backed up all of its servers nightly, using a mix of back- up methods and an information lifecycle management system. One night a drive failed. The IT group, unflustered over the loss, went to retrieve the backups from tape, only to find there was no data on the tapes themselves. The backup software was flawed, and for over a month it was \"writing\" data to tape without any data transfer. The result, of course, was a minor form of Armageddon. It took the firm six weeks to return to business as normal, and it was able to do so mostly by paying data entry clerks huge sums in overtime. Hence it's not enough to back up. You have to have a thorough, tested plan. And before you presume that you are safe, remember that no one in the World Trade Center knew that Flight 1 1 would end as it did on a fateful September morning in 2001. Plan & Then Plan Again Start with the basics. The first step in planning is knowing what data you have — what there is and where you keep it. Is your data on servers, atomized over a thousand users' computers, or a melding of both? No doubt you'll have the standard data types that all companies use: email, Office docs, a Web site, and most likely an ERP, CRM, SCM, or financial app that stores vital data. You may have an intranet and other systems to worry about, too. But no matter what kinds of data you have, you'll need to know your data cul- ture, the unique way a firm deals with information. Is most of your business con- ducted through email? Do you have crucial data on users' hard drives? Are your HR Go to Page 8, Column 1 Is Encryption Enough? Options For Dealing With Stolen Laptops by Chris A. MacKinnon A stolen laptop spells bad news for anyone. But for small to medium-sized enterprises, it means more than just the cost of the laptop; we're looking at proprietary information loss and corporate network vul- nerability. Case in point: The Department of Justice just had a laptop stolen with proprietary data on 80,000 employees. And according to the FBI, only 3% of stolen computers are ever recovered. Today, there are three op- tions when it comes to deal- ing with the loss of a laptop and preventing related data theft: encryption, software that has a kill command, and soft- ware that has stealth capab- ilities to track the device through the Internet. Right now, the perception is that encryption is the only real option. However, manufactur- ers are coming up with some pretty innovative ideas. The question is, are these manufac- turers meaning for these solu- tions to replace encryption or merely enhance it? Encryption While encryption has been a staple in the security diets of many IT professionals, it is not the only solution. In fact, most security professionals would agree that because net- works and thieves are both getting smarter, encryption only represents one tier in a well-rounded, multitiered se- curity solution. Ben Haidri, vice president of marketing and business devel- opment for Absolute Software, says most thefts happen in- house, and encryption alone won't save you. Haidri says, \"It's easy to think that encryp- tion will address your secu- rity needs, but the reality is, in the majority of corporate thefts, it's often very ineffec- tive, as the thief is the em- ployee who has access to the computer and therefore the data. Also, there is no guaran- tee that the data was in the right folder or volume and was encrypted to begin with.\" The loss of a laptop pre- sents a security problem on Go to Page 9, Column 1 According to the FBI, only 3% I of stolen computers are ever recovered.

EU officials refused to comment on which offices were searched or whether any documents were taken. For more than four years, the EU has been investigating claims that Intel used unfair business prac- tices to get clients to purchase its chips. Intel has been cooperating with the EU since the start of the investigations, providing request- ed documents and meeting with officials. I Microsoft Simplifies Licensing & Financing Programs Microsoft made changes in its licensing and financing programs to make it easier for customers to buy software. Under the now worldwide Open Value program, SMEs can license two new bundles of core technology: the Professional Platform and the Small Business Platform. With Open Value, cus- tomers will now be able to track licenses online, and partners can resell Open Value licensing, which puts the VAR in better con- trol of the relationship with the customer. In addition, contracts for both financing and licensing deals have been significantly short- ened, which should simplify the transactions. I Group Proposes Antispam Standard It'll be easier to eliminate spam and phishing emails if a new specification devel- oped by Cisco, Yahoo!, Microsoft, and sev- eral other companies becomes standard. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is a combination of Yahool's DomainKeys and Cisco's Internet Identified Mail. The spec uses public key cryptography, attaching a digital signature to all outgoing messages, so recipients can verify the authenticity of the email using a DKIM-enabled server. The IETF will likely start discussions on DKIM late this month and could create a working group to debate the spec. I Spyware Defined . . . A group of anti-spyware software mak- ers, including Computer Associates, Tenebril, Lavasoft, Microsoft, and McAfee, have joined forces as the Anti-Spyware Coalition and published a proposed defini- tion of spyware. Spyware is loosely defined as software that gathers user information and is installed without the user's consent or knowledge. The expanded definition states spyware is anything that \"impairs users' con- trol over: material changes that affect their user experience, privacy, or system security; use of their system resources, including what programs are installed on their computers; or collection, use, and distribution of their per- sonal or otherwise sensitive information.\" Critics say having a standard definition will make it possible for existing spyware compa- nies to escape detection. I ... Not A Moment Too Soon According to a study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, 91% of Internet users have changed their online behaviors to avoid sypware and adware. About 50% of respondents have stopped visiting unknown Web sites they suspect might install spyware on their PCs, while more than 80% no longer open email attach- ments if they're unsure of their origin. I Sarbanes-Oxley: A Security Threat? A report from the Information Security Forum shows that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could be diverting spending from protecting against other security threats. Some mem- bers of the ISF, including CitiGroup and EDS, expect to pay up to $10 million to comply with Sarbox regulations. According to the ISF, Sarbox doesn't cover some important security issues such as disaster recovery and business continuity and could cause some companies, particularly those not involved primarily in the financial indus- try, to ignore more pressing security issues. I Four Cisco Executives Retire Four of Cisco's top executives have announced their retirement. The retirees are Chief Development Officer Mario Mazzola and Senior Vice Presidents Soni Jiandani, Prem Jain, and Luca Cafiero. All four have been at Cisco for more than 10 years and have worked together for more than 20 years. They were founding members of the company's Fibre Channel switching startup and developed Cisco's storage business from the ground up. Analysts question Cisco's future storage strategy now that it's losing four key executives. I New Web Suffix For Mobile Phones The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, meeting in Luxem- burg, has approved the new suffix \".mobi\" to be used for Web sites geared specifically for mobile devices. The sites, which will be ready next year, will fit a small screen and be compatible with limited bandwidth and memory. A number of powerful mobile phone operators and handset makers requested the .mobi suffix; they hope it will encourage Web site designers and other firms to develop more Web pages for mobile devices. I Justice Department Probes Adobe, Macromedia Deal Justice Department officials have asked Adobe and Macromedia to supply additional information about the compa- nies' products to get a better idea of the competition in the market and how a merg- er might affect product pricing. In April Adobe announced its intent to purchase Macromedia for $3.4 billion in an effort to expand its lineup of multimedia tools. Adobe is facing increased competition from Microsoft and open-source developers. I HP Appoints New CIO HP has announced that Randall D. Mott, the former senior vice president and CIO at HP's rival Dell, will be the new executive vice president and CIO at HP. Mott's main duty will be managing HP's data center oper- ations, technology infrastructure, application development, and global telecommunications networks. Gilles Bouchard, HP's former CIO, will stay in the position of executive vice president of global operations.

Various manu- facturers are introducing their VoIP handsets to the market. In techno- logical terms, the VoIP handset is the end of the line for a VoIP sys- tem. But in terms of user accep- tance, a good VoIP handset can go a long way towards making believers out of users who might be skeptical of VoIP' s potential. In most cases, VoIP telephones look just like their traditional POTS (Plain Old Telephone Sys- tem) counterparts. The only dif- ference, of course, is the ability to connect to a converged voice and data network and the various fea- tures and capabilities that enable such connectivity. In this roundup, we take a look at some of the VoIP telephones from various manufacturers, including Avaya, Cisco, Lucent, and Nortel. Read on to learn more about these handsets and the features that put them at the head of the VoIP class. VoIP: The Market Heats Up VoIP market acceptance and adoption are heating up. Although many maintain the technology is still young and needs to mature fur- ther, most industry sources predict VoIP will continue to take market share away from traditional tele- phony during the next few years. According to eMarketer Senior Analyst Steve Butler, the business and consumer migration to VoIP is still a long ways off. But, says Butler, VoIP is on the verge of moving out of the early adoption phase and into the mainstream. Buying Tips The following tips will help you purchase the right VoIP phones for your company. • Select a phone with features appropriate for your work environment. • Make sure the phone you select will work with your specific vendor's VoIP system. • Look for a phone that sup- ports the QoS protocol used in your network. • If possible, select phones for busy individuals with a handset and speakerphone feature. • DHCP compatibility will give you flexibility for IP addressing. • Look for flash upgradeable firmware, so your handsets will grow with your VoIP system. • Choose a telephone that sup- ports your VoIP system's Unified Messaging features, if available. • Above all, listen to your users. eMarketer predicts VoIP use will become widespread during the next couple of years. A recent Info-Tech Research Group study reveals over 60% of midsized enterprises have already deployed VoIP or are planning to do so within three years. Info-Tech also predicts VoIP will experience greater than 35% growth in 2005, as many midsized enterprises move to adopt and implement the technology. A December 2004 IDC study of the VoIP semiconductor market predicts a 48% compound annual growth rate from 2003 to 2008. The correlation is simple. Now that VoIP adoption is picking up, the silicon brains that power VoIP devices will benefit as a result of VoIP' s growth. The bottom line on the VoIP marketplace is that, in spite of industry concerns about security and the status of accessibility to 911 services, the pace of adoption from both business and residential customers will accelerate. (For more information on 911 and VoIP, see \"Enhanced 911 With VoIP Technology\" on page 30.) Overview: VoIP Phones There's a lot of behind-the- scenes technology required to make VoIP a reality. Shuttling voice traffic over data networks requires the prioritization of voice packets so they arrive at their desti- nation on time and in the right sequence. But in the end, the goal is simple: a dial tone delivered by a handset that, for all intents and pur- poses, looks just like a traditional POTS handset. In spite of the fact that VoIP phones are manufactured to look exactly like their POTS counter- parts, they have features that are specific to VoIP technology. For example, VoIP phones have pro- grammability features that make them a bit more flexible than tradi- tional telephones. VoIP phones must also be able to interact with various IP network protocols and systems, such as QoS and DHCP. Let' s take a look at a few mod- els from Avaya, Cisco, and Nortel and examine the features that make them unique. Avaya sets the tone for SMBs. Avaya, a spin-off of Lucent, has made a name for itself in recent years in the telecommunications marketplace with a wide array of products for the telecommunica- tions and IP telecommunications marketplace. Avaya' s 56xx line of H.323 IP telephones is, according to the company, specifically designed for the needs of small and medium- sized enterprises and for use with Avaya' s IP Office system. The 56xx line consists of four models: 5601, 5602, 5610, and 5620, as well as an EU24 expansion unit for use with the 5620 telephones. Features included with every model in the line are, to name a few, auto-answer, conference call- ing, forwarding, call park, call pick- up, call waiting, dial emergency, suspend call, forward on busy, for- ward on no answer, forward to Snapshot Avaya 56xx Series IP Telephones (includes 5601, 5602, 5610, 5620) Avaya's 56xx Series of IP telephones are designed specifically for SMEs requiring a variety of IP telephone capabilities, from entry-level, low-usage phones to full- featured IP telephones developed for high voice traffic environments (such as cus- tomer service centers). www.Processor.com/Avaya specified number, and ring back when free. In short, all the models carry the features you'd expect to find in a telephone designed for a business environment. If you require a full-duplex (speak and listen) speakerphone, you'll have to go with the higher- end 5610 and 5620 models because the 5601 has no speakerphone and the 5602 features a \"listen-only\" speakerphone. The 5610, 5620, and a special 5602SW model feature 10/100 BaseT Ethernet ports for connect- ing the telephone to a PC. All models also connect directly to your LAN and can use either DHCP client dynamic or static IP address assignments. The tele- phones support standard protocols, including H.323, SIP, G.711, and G.729 A/B voice coders, and vari- ous QoS features, including Layer 4 UDP port selection, Diffserv pri- ority numbering (Layer 3), and Layer 2 802.1 p/q. The higher-end 5610 and 5620 models even feature Web brows- ers, which allow for access to Web- enabled business applications. Cisco leverages its network- savvy expertise. Whenever people think of the networking revolution, they invariably think of Cisco Systems, the company whose hard- ware runs a large chunk of corpo- rate networks and the Internet itself. Naturally, Cisco's network expertise has resulted in a wide array of products for VoIP, includ- ing IP telephones. Cisco's 7900 Series line of IP phones includes eight models, ranging from the 7902G to the 7971G-GE. The 7971G-GE, 7970G, 7960G, 7940G, 7912G, and 7905G all feature XML programmability, which provides customers with the ability to cre- ate custom XML applications. The 7902G entry-level model is designed for basic calling (low traffic) environments, and unlike its higher-end counterparts, it doesn't have an LCD display. So if you're looking for a simple IP phone with minimal extra features that will do the job, the 7902G will work nicely. Standard telephony features that come with the 7902G include sin- gle line/DN (Directory Number), call waiting, call transfer, three- way (conference) calling, redial, call hold, up to four speed dials, and voicemail access. Network features include the Cisco Discovery Protocol; IEEE 802. 1Q (VLAN) automatic con- figuration; G.711a, G.711u, and G.729a/b audio compression codecs; 10 BaseT Ethernet con- nection; and DHCP and network software upgradeability. Cisco's 7940G is in the middle of the 7900 Series product line, so it has some advanced features, such as an LCD display; dynamic soft keys for navigating phone menus; a speaker phone; and access to Web- based XML information services that include stock quotes, weather reports, etc. The phone is designed for what Cisco calls \"transaction type\" (high voice traffic) workers. Other features include a hearing- aid-compatible handset, a two port 10/100 BaseT Ethernet switch, 802. 1Q VLAN compatibility, a dedicated headset port, G.711 and Snapshot Cisco 7900 Series of IP Telephones (includes 7902G, 7905G, 7910G+SW, 79120,79400,79600,79700, 7971G-GE). Cisco 7900 Series of IP telephones run the gamut from simple, entry-level models to more complex, customizable models that can be adapted to a variety of business needs. www.Processor.com/Cisco G.729a audio compression, static or DHCP IP address assignments, and H.323 and Microsoft Net- Meeting compatibility. Nortel's IP phone duo. Nortel Networks is another example of a networking pioneer that is active in the burgeoning VoIP market- place. Nortel provides telecom- munications services to all types of organizations, from govern- ments to small businesses. Nortel's line of VoIP tele- phones consists of four products: the IP Phone 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2007. The IP 2050 Software Phone is a \"soft-phone\" designed for use with notebook or desktop PCs that require telephony ser- vices. (Nortel implemented a mar- keting model name change in 2004, so these models have fairly new names. For example, the IP Phone 2004 is the new model name for the i2004 phone.) These phones are compatible with a variety of Nortel communi- cations systems, including Busi- ness Communications Manager; IP-enabled Meridian 1; Meridian SL-100; Communication Servers 1000, 2000, and 2100; and Multi- media Communication Servers 5100 and 5200. The single-line IP Phone 2001 is the entry-level model in the series and is designed for public areas and low call traffic locations. The phone features 802. 3 af PoE com- patibility, listen-only speaker phone, 10/100 BaseT Ethernet connectivity, and basic telephony features. Other network features include DHCP compatibility for Snapshot Nortel IP Phone 2001 ,2002, 2004, 2007 Nortel's IP telephone line recently changed names, from Succession i200x Internet Telephones to Nortel 200x IP Phones. These IP phones work with various Nortel systems, including Meridian, IP-enabled Meridian-1 , and Meridian SL-100 systems. www.Processor.com/Nortel dynamic IP address assignment and automatic firmware upgrades. The IP Phone 2004 is compati- ble with advanced features, such as Nortel's CallPilot Unified Mes- saging for Meridian PBX systems. The phone's LAN connection can be manually configured for either 10Mbps or 100Mbps for environ- ments where switching equipment does not automatically negotiate connections. The IP Phone 2004 also features PoE using 802. 3af and DHCP compatibility for dynamic IP addressing. VoIP For The Masses The VoIP phones we discussed here are all capable handsets that will get the job done. Manufactur- ers are developing a variety of tele- phones designed for all types of work environments, from low call traffic areas, such as lobbies, to the busy desks of call center agents and other professionals who \"live on the phone.\" Keep in mind that these handsets are designed to work with VoIP systems from the same vendor.

But extending those plans to cover specific data loss scenarios usually isn't done. In addition to establishing emer- gency measures if a company's data stores get emptied, IT depart- ments also have to think about what to do for common data loss, such as when a user deletes the wrong file or some email goes missing. Planning for these every- day issues can lessen IT headaches and possibly even keep things from getting lost in the future. Make A Plan The first step in planning for a data loss incident is to actually just have a plan. Sussman esti- mates that about 90% of small to midsized enterprises have no idea what they'll do if, for example, the marketing manager just lost all of his email. \"In many cases, panic is the first and best option at these companies,\" he jokes. For those that would prefer not to scurry in panic when incidents strike, Sussman recommends going through various recovery scenarios and assigning value to different types of data. Email may be more vital than corrupted doc- uments that were created a few how much energy and time to put into recovery efforts. \"Most often, it's going to be email that people care about,\" says Joel Smith, CTO of antispam software maker AppRiver. \"Companies should have a plan in place that specifi- cally addresses how email can get recovered easily.\" Once it's decided what's worth recovering, IT can move on to what type of tools or applications hours ago, and it's likely that email from within the past few months is more important than what's being stored from a few years ago. Just as companies use tiered strategies for backup, they can take the same approach for recov- ery. Understanding what's impor- tant for users will help IT decide should be in place. There are numerous options in the market- place, from online recovery ser- vices such as Ontrack to software packages such as Stellar Phoenix. The important thing is to have these tools in place before inci- dents happen. A quick tip: Don't use a utility program that doesn't allow you Recovery Session Some software can put data recovery into a user's hands. Here's a sampling of options: Recover My Files R-Undelete GetDataBack This software from GetData recovers If users are continually regretting their From Runtime Software, this applica- files lost by accidental deletion, soft- \"delete file\" choices, this application tion is especially good for getting data ware crash, virus infection, or acci- from R-Tools Technologies could pro- back after a disaster, like damage to dental reformatting of the hard drive. vide comfort. The company also has the root directory. It can recover files www.getdata.com email recovery and data recovery even if Windows doesn't recognize applications. the drive. www.r-tt.com www.runtime.org to save an \"undo\" file of any repairs that it makes. Also, if data loss is accompanied by strange drive noises such as grinding or clicking, you may want to refer the problem to a professional. User Education An integral part of recovery planning is deciding on the role of the end user. At some companies, especially those with technologi- cally less savvy end users, IT may decide to do all the recovery through software and services. But at companies where em- ployees are adept at installing software without incident or using multiple devices, some automated tools (see the \"Recovery Session\" sidebar) could be used to give them power to recover files them- selves, says Sussman. An important aspect of giving users more control is to ensure that they also understand the backup process, says Tony Barbagallo, senior vice president of marketing at online backup and recovery firm EVault. \"A common problem with users is that they think they're backing up files, when in fact they're not,\" he notes. \"They assume that the information in all their per- sonal and desktop folders is mag- ically backed up somewhere, but unless the files are designated for backup, they may have to deal with recovery.\" When companies do tell em- ployees how to do self-backup, such as by dragging relevant files to a systemwide folder on the desktop, they neglect to stress the importance of the task, Barbagallo says. \"People hit the delete button awfully quick,\" he says. \"Also, they tend to ignore error mes- sages, or they don't read them. A little user education on backup and recovery issues can go a long way.\" Test It Out To know with certainty that a recovery plan works, it has to be used to actually recover some- thing. Whether a company is using software in-house or rely- ing on a service that does backup and recovery, it's worthwhile to occasionally \"lose\" something important, such as the CEO's email or a sales database that's utilized frequently. After making sure that a reli- able backup is at the ready, a company can delete the file or application and begin recovery When Recovery Goes Bad Although many software recovery applications are straightforward to use, they can still be misused or actually make the problem worse. If it seems like a user has been a little too heavy handed with Norton utilities, many experts believe that's the time to take a hands-off approach and seek professional help. For more information on backup and recovery services, see the \"Vaulting To Success\" article on page 1 1 . \"If it looks like the problem has gotten worse, stop touching the machine, basically,\" says Scott Gaidano, co-founder of recovery firm DriveSavers. \"Users need to know that if it looks like what they're doing might cause more harm than good, they should refer the problem to a recovery service.\" Indications of a bad recovery are usually obvious, he says. The tell- tale hard drive churn, frozen screen, newly missing files, or infrequently-seen error messages are all reasons to back off and bring in the experts. \"It's fine to attempt a recovery on your own, but at the first sign of trouble, stop trying to do it yourself because that could cause more problems and affect more machines or even the network,\" says Gaidano. procedures. Usually, these types of tests are done to make sure that backups work properly, but they're used less often for recov- ery. Instead of immediately going to backup, Sussman recommends trying to \"find\" the deleted data through other means. \"In a real situation, you'd have the backup ready, and that would solve the problem,\" he says. \"But what if the tape fails or your backup procedure didn't store the data properly?

Where do you store switch and router settings, passwords, and device baselines? You'll need to answer these questions in your plan. Alphabet Soup: BIA&ILM Next, you'll need to rank your data. Rare is the firm with enough time and money to back up all of its data nightly, so you'll need to prioritize. You have two options. First, you can — and should — conduct a business impact assessment on all your data. A BIA is a financial model of the damage a certain type of data loss will cause. If you lose a few spreadsheets on the comptroller's hard drive, will it be as bad as losing all of Great Plains or all the A/P records or payroll? A BIA starts with a written survey of department heads. Ask them what data they need to continue their work. Have them explain why they need it and what they would do if it were lost. Have them quantify the dollars or man-hours such a loss would entail. Then rank your data based on those answers and make backup decisions based on that rank. The next option involves ILM. Despite what you've heard, it's not a technology per se (although a number of software and hardware solutions address it). Rather, it's a technique that reviews how information flows through your enterprise. In a nutshell, most ILM systems learn the age of a piece of data and how often it's used. Fresh data that's used often is then moved to your best servers (which are unlikely to fail); stale data that's kept most- ly for records is moved to older machines that might not be as sturdy. A Question Of Methods Don't forget to address the question of backup methods — full, differential, and incremental. A full backup moves all your data to the backup system no matter when it was changed or whether it was even changed. What's To Blame For Data Loss? According to Protect Data, data loss is rarely caused by malware. So what's to blame? Virus issues and malware 7% Software problems 14% Human error 32% Natural disasters 3% Hardware or system failure 44% It's thorough but costly and slow. A differ- ential backup copies the documents that changed since the last full backup. An incremental backup transfers the data that changed since the last backup of any kind (full, differential, or incremental). Which should you use? It depends — and it may not be the same for each system. You'll need to take such factors as capacity, recovery speed, and budget into account. You may want a full email backup nightly but only a differential backup of old memos on a rarely used drive. Where To, Please? With tapes in hand, where do you store them? Most firms store at least one set of tapes offsite to guard against theft, fire, or flood. But you'll need to store your tapes in the right place. A safe deposit box is a vanilla option but not always the best. A vaulting service (see Iron Mountain's at www. iron mountain.com) will keep your data in theft- proof, flood-proof, danger-proofrooms. And no matter where your backup is stored, you'll need to test it. It's something that few companies do — to their ultimate horror. Simply put, there are dozens of rea- sons to test your backup, including the potential of failed software, encryption problems, or the simple fact that you stored your tapes in a safe deposit box next to the box of a man who keeps a collection of rare magnets. In truth, the only failsafe way to test your backup is to restore it, and to do that, you'll need to set up a test network or, at the very least, a test server to perform a full or incremental restore. Once you've restored your data, you'll need to test its integrity by running the apps that use it or by using data integrity tools such as Rocksoft's well-known Veracity (www .rocksoft.com), which can verify the status of a system rollback. An Enterprise Backup RFP You may not have the people or expertise to run a good backup in-house. It's an art, and when dealing with data— your firm's lifeblood— why leave it to chance? If you decide to outsource, you'll need an RFP. Keep these points in mind: • Do you need to outsource all your back- ups? Or only a few crucial ones? • Ask your vendor to provide a backup audit and strategic plan as part of his work. • There's nothing better than a scope state- ment to outline a process, and it should be tied to firm dates and times. • Demand an SLA. An SLA will tie your ven- dor to detailed performance targets, an absolute must with backups and restores. • Include a nondisclosure agreement. To out- source backups, you need to divulge your network setup, and that should be classified. And Last Of All... Even the best of plans can fail if there's no one to run them — or if no one knows about them. Your backup plan should not exist in your head. It should be written down and given to key people in your company. If there's a system failure, who gets noti- fied, and when? If you're hit by a bus, do your colleagues know where you put the backup tapes? What happens if you're in France when a server goes down? You'll need to resolve these questions and more. After all, a good backup plan is only as good as the people who run it. And in the end, they're only as good as what they know.

Continued from Page 1 several fronts: physical, network, and data security. Haidri says encryption only solves one of them. He claims that using encryption for data security is only effec- tive approximately 20% of the time that theft is committed by a nonemployee. Bradley Lide, president of CyberAngel Security Solutions, comments on full disk encryption. \"Most companies feel that they have 'challenged' users and want to ensure that they do not forget to encrypt a document or place it in a secure area. Therefore, full disk encryption is popular, While encryption has proven an effective security technology, more security professionals are turning to software developers such as Absolute Software for solutions that track stolen laptops covertly, alert users, and aid in the recovery process. as it takes any decision making out of the users' hands. But most commonly, people find that the resources required to run that type of software end up with some performance issues. Also, if you are looking to recover that computer, your chances are slim if you have 'locked everything' on that computer; they are more likely to chop it up or throw it away.\" Martin Moran, founder and CEO of Brigadoon Software, would agree with Haidri and Lide. \"There is nothing wrong with encryption. I use it myself and I highly recommend it for anyone using a computer. The fact of the matter is strong computer security needs to be multitiered. Theft recovery software just makes practical sense as part of a multitiered approach to true computer security.\" Regarding software with a kill command, Lide says, \"I do not like it, based on liability reasons. If a monitoring center such as ours has the ability to call a computer and erase, delete, thrash, or whatever other term you might use, it opens the possibility of moni- toring center error. Also, it is dependent on that computer connecting to a communica- tion source to provide that command.\" Nifty Solutions Lide says that 80% of laptop thefts result in a rapid resale. To thieves, Lide says, a laptop has more value if it appears fully functional. \"Tracking products usually are very covert, not alerting the unauthorized user, so they have a tendency to use that computer without thinking about violating some security package.\" CyberAngel Security Solutions offers CyberAngel Security software, which uses unique patented alert, lock, and locate tech- nology to detect unauthorized access of a laptop and silently report the intrusion to the CyberAngel security monitoring center. The CyberAngel Security software offers multilevel protection while remaining invisible to an unauthorized user. When the CyberAngel Security soft- ware is activated, it alerts users (via email or fax) with real-time notification of unauthorized access. The software will lock communication ports, preventing Processor.com unauthorized dial-up access to remote net- work servers or online banking and investment accounts and also to prevent unauthorized email of sensitive docu- ments via dial-up access from the stolen laptop. Communication is restricted to PDAs, pocket PCs, and smartphones. CyberAngel Security software also pro- vides secure encryption and helps users locate and recover a stolen laptop by identi- fying the location from which the laptop is calling. CyberAngel Security Solutions will also help coordinate notice to all necessary law enforcement officials to effect a rapid recovery of the stolen laptop. Brigadoon Software has developed a theft recovery software package called PC PhoneHome, which it believes significantly increases a laptop's chance of recovery. The software secretly sends an invisible email message to a specified email address containing the physical location of a stolen laptop every time it connects to the In- ternet. The message contains the laptop's exact location. Once this information is received, Brigadoon provides full technical and recovery support. Recovery agents work with global ISPs and investigating law enforcement agencies to recover the stolen property. Encryption Realities Page 9 Absolute Software offers Computrace- Complete, a solution that deters theft and guarantees the recovery of stolen PCs or laptops. ComputraceComplete lets users efficiently monitor who is using their sys- tems, what hardware and software changes are being made, and where their systems are located physically. Absolute Software will recover a stolen laptop or PC within 60 days or buyers may receive up to $1,000 per stolen computer. Absolute Software has plans to release new feature enhancements in two major software updates beginning in the fall. Some of these enhancements will include upgrades to data delete capabilities (allow- ing users to set priority for data deletion based on file type), post- theft remote file recovery (to ensure data is recovered before it is deleted), user authentication enhance- ments, and user lockout at the BIOS level. With the introduction of various regula- tory compliance standards, companies are under a tremendous amount of pressure to show that they have done as much as possi- ble to protect their physical assets, networks, and data. Companies need a layered ap- proach to security and technologies that work together to provide security solutions that cover as many bases as possible. Encryption products on the market today provide either file/folder, volume-based, or full disk encryption. File/folder offerings usually rely on end users participating in the process by putting files in the proper location. Security is only as good as its weakest link— and end-user reliance is one of the biggest. Volume-based encryption poses similar issues in making sure the files are in the right place but gives IT more control and often eliminates the need to have the end user involved. Full disk encryption options are the most secure but also the least flexible and can oftentimes present IT staff with problems of interoperability, slow system performance, and deployment difficulties. Another potential issue with encryption is where the keys are stored and how they are accessed. Many of today's encryption products store the keys locally and use Windows authentication to gain access to the encrypted data. So if the thief is the employee, he has full access to the data, and the company's data isn't protected.

And new regulatory requirements are compelling businesses to elevate the importance of sound data man- agement, including backup and restore operations. Fortunately, companies such as Veritas, Computer Associates, EMC, and others are paying atten- tion to small and medium-sized enterprises and are introducing backup products designed to ease your data backup burden without breaking your budget. It's espe- cially encouraging that companies such as EMC and Veritas, which traditionally sell products into the large enterprise market, are now developing and marketing prod- ucts aimed at the SME. Let's take a look. Acronis True Image 8.0 Storage management software developer Acronis markets various backup applications aimed at the SME marketplace. These include Acronis True Image 8.0 Corporate Workstation and True Image 8.0 Server for Windows. The Corporate Workstation ver- sion is designed solely for the backup of multiple client desktops and laptops across a network. If you want to back up your Win- dows-based server(s) also, you will need to purchase True Image 8.0 Server for Windows. The software backs up hard drive sectors instead of simply copying individual files so admin- istrators can make exact copies of disks that are easily restored to \"bare metal\" systems. Other features include scheduled backups on multiple workstations, remote restore, incremental back- ups, management console, backup job status notifications, and sup- port for various backup technolo- gies, including DAS, RAID tape, network drives, USB/FireWire storage devices, CD, DVD, and removable drives. CA BrightStor ARCserve Backup M 1.1 For Windows CA is another example of a large software developer taking an inter- est in the SME marketplace with the launch of new applications. CA's BrightStor ARCserve Backup rll.l software for backup and re- store of Windows servers and Win- dows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, and NetWare clients is certified by Microsoft to work on all versions of Windows servers. In addition, ver- sions of BrightStor are available for NetWare and Linux environments. BrightStor works in both SAN and NAS environments and fea- tures wizard-driven operation to create backup jobs with ease. The software works with single or mul- tiple server environments. Other features include remote file system device support, a job \"preflight check\" that ensures future jobs per- form without problems, and multi- plexing for enhanced performance. The software is also included with CA's recently released pro- tection suites designed for the SME marketplace. In addition to backup software, the various pro- tection suites also include antivirus and anti-spy ware applications. EMC Dantz Retrospect 7 For Windows One of the first products launched by the new combination of EMC and Dantz Development is Retrospect 7. Retrospect is a Windows backup and recovery application that comes in four edi- tions: Multi Server, Single Server, Small Business Server, and Disk- to-Disk. The software is able to back up computers and servers running multiple OSes, including Win95/98/Me/NT4/2000/XP, Mac OS 7.1 or later, Mac OS X 10.1 or later, Red Hat Linux, SuSE Linux, and Solaris. The various editions differ ac- cording to the number of server or desktop/notebook assets they protect. For example, the Small Business Server edition is licensed EIDE/IDE/FireWire/USB tape drives, hard drives, CD-R/W, DVD-R/W, DVD+R/W, DVD- RAM, network drives, and others. NovaBACKUP supports all Win- dows versions Win98SE to WinXP and works in small network envi- ronments. NovaNET is the company's stur- dier backup solution. It is marketed as a full-featured network backup to protect a single server running Windows Small Business Server plus networked desktops and notebooks. Other features include wizard- driven operations, automatic device recognition, incremental backups, automatic removal of older data, and disaster recovery CDs. Novastor NovaBACKUP & NovaNET Novastor develops and markets two backup applications that may be of interest to the SME: Nova- BACKUP and NovaNET. Like other applications in this roundup, the programs differ in terms of capabilities and, of course, price. NovaBACKUP is designed for single PC or server backups; the software works with various types of backup media, including SCSI/ program that works in the most common network OS environ- ments (Microsoft, Linux, and Net- Ware). In addition to support for traditional backup devices, Nova- NET also works in SAN and NAS environments. Its capabilities can be expanded via various plug-ins, including support for Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and others. The Open File Manager plug-in, available for both NovaBACKUP and NovaNET, is designed to allow the backup of open, in-use files during backup jobs. Veritas Backup Exec Suite Veritas is marketing its Backup Exec Suite and Backup Exec 10 for Windows Servers products to SMEs with increasingly complex data management needs. The Backup Products For SMEs: A Quick Look Now that more companies are paying attention to the small to midsized enterprise marketplace, the choices of backup solutions available are plentiful.

Backup Exec 10 now features a central admin server option, which gives admins the ability to manage multiple Backup Exec servers from a single console. Backup Exec Suite links Backup Exec, Repli- cation Exec, and Storage Exec so administrators can view informa- tion from each app in the suite within the Backup Exec Console. The software also provides con- tinuous protection for desktops and notebooks and protects servers run- ning Oracle lOg, Lotus Domino, and SAP R/3. Backup Exec uses an \"agent\" to back up servers running Linux or Unix OSes. Other features include \"synthetic full backups,\" constructed from multiple incremental backups; data copying from remote to centralized locations (Replication Exec); and monitoring and blocking of non- business-related file storage (Stor- age Exec). Yosemite TapeWare Master Server & TapeWare PC Workgroup Yosemite develops and markets two backup applications for SMEs that don't quite have enter- prise-class backup needs yet: Yosemite TapeWare Master Serv- er and Yosemite TapeWare PC Workgroup. If you don't have a complex network and simply need to back up a group of desktop PCs con- nected via a peer-to-peer network, the Yosemite TapeWare PC Work- group will meet your needs. The application backs up multiple PCs from a single PC desktop connect- ed to a USB, IDE, or SCSI tape device. Other features include wizard- driven operation, backup schedul- ing, a bare metal disaster recovery agent, and the ability to connect an unlimited number of locally attached tape devices. If your needs are more complex, Yosemite's TapeWare Master Serv- er may work for you. This applica- tion is designed for single-server backups of Windows, Linux, Net- Ware, or Unix servers connected to an unlimited number of client desk- tops. If you want to scale up to multiple servers, you must purchase additional TapeWare licenses. Other features include backup scheduling, role- and job-based security, and remote management. Various plug-ins expand function- ality, including Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Exchange, Or- acle, Open File Manager, and Bare Metal Disaster Recovery. Data Backup: A Must Do Gets Easier These apps are a few examples of the wide range of backup pro- grams available for your business. It's a boon for SMEs that software companies that have traditionally overlooked smaller enterprises are finally paying attention to this key business segment. Data protection requirements for SMEs will only increase. The number of software applications that are up to the task is increasing as that happens.

July 22, 2005 Processor.com Vaulting To Success Online Backup & Recovery Services Offer SMEs A Way To Do It Right by Ericka Chickowski • • • Smaller businesses are notori- ously bad about backing up their data. According to Gartner re- search, 40% of small to midsized enterprises don't back up their data. Of those that do, 64% do it onsite. This is putting their busi- nesses at tremendous risk. Just a few years ago there was no easy answer for these business- es, which often just didn't have the resources to do the job right. Times have changed. Over the last year, the online backup and recovery market has exploded. Companies are now offering offsite disk-to-disk back- up for a fraction of what it would cost to set up hardware and main- tain it internally. The data is trans- ferred online, with on-the-fly encryption for added protection. Many analysts believe these ser- vices to be the silver bullet for SME backup needs. Big Boys Of Backup The following are some of the most prominent national services that are available for the SME marketplace. AmeriVault. For several years now, AmeriVault has been work- ing as a VAR, reselling EVault services with a high-end service approach. Though the company is still continuing its relationship with EVault, it is shifting its SME focus by offering online backup services based on its own backend technology. This new XpressVault offering comes as a result of AmeriVault' s January acquisition of Certified Backup. Compared with its other services, Xpress- Vault is a more affordable solution for companies with between 50 and 1,000 employees. Arsenal. Like EVault, Arsenal is also a storage managed service provider, offering things like on- demand storage and data center consulting. But in reality the firm is focusing mainly on its ViaRemote service these days. According to company representatives, this ser- vice will make up 80% of the company's growth in 2005. The pay-as-you-go service offers enter- prise-wide backup to protect PCs, servers, and laptops on Windows, Linux, or Unix platforms. There is also the opportunity to upgrade to the ViaRemote Fast Restore Op- tion, which offers higher service levels for those with stringent RTOs (Recovery Time Objectives). BluePoint. BluePoint's SME offsite data backup is delivered through an onsite SNAP (Storage Network Access Point). Starting at $199 per month, DataSafe's big selling point comes via Blue- Point's close relationship with IBM. DataSafe is especially easily integrated with Tivoli systems to provide backup and recovery man- agement for midsized enterprises that have a lot of infrastructure but don't have the time or expertise to keep things thoroughly backed up. EVault. Almost all of the big backup and recovery services out there will try to sell their cus- tomers based on the regulatory compliance. But EVault has espe- cially tried to differentiate itself based on its catering to the vertical markets that are most affected by these regulations, specifically the law, financial, and health care fields. Rather than focusing sole- ly as an online backup service business, EVault touts itself as a managed service provider with a greater depth of services. EVault' s total information lifecycle manage- ment services include backup and recovery, long-term archiving, and high-availability storage services. Unlike many managed service providers that offer all of these perks, EVault uses its own in- house software and technology to power its online backup services. Live Vault. The biggest player in the SME backup and recovery market, Live Vault helped lead the surge in online backup adoption. The company breaks up its services and products into two broad cate- gories: LiveVault InSync for SMEs and LiveVault InControl for medi- um-sized and large enterprises with Just The Facts, Ma'am Though it may seem like they are all the same, each online backup company has a different spin on pricing and market focus.

Page 11 remote offices. Whereas InSync is a service designed to allow SMEs to implement backup strategies quickly and affordably, InControl is a backup product package that allows enterprises to build an online backup solution into their own infrastructure rather than out- sourcing that duty. As the leader of the pack in the service category, LiveVault has a numerous list of channel partners. Firms such as Iron Mountain, HP, and U.S. Data Trust all sell LiveVault services rebranded under their own banners. Savvy Networks. Savvy Net- works offers a range of offsite data backup and recovery services. In addition to its own brand of online vaulting, its hot- and warmsite server recovery services give busi- nesses the option of setting up a fully redundant offsite server con- figuration at a fraction of the cost of actually setting up such facili- ties on your own. Starting at $200, warmsite service by Savvy pro- vides for periodic syncs with an online vaulting account or back- up tapes in the event of an emer- gency; this service is designed for businesses with a high level of tol- erance recovery objectives. (Those with more aggressive RTO needs can utilize the hotsite service at a starting rate of $500.) The company is also partnered with Intradyn to offer services in con- junction with the company's unique RocketVault appliance. The device simplifies data man- agement, offering near plug-and- play backup and archiving with little need for configuration. Picking Partners Because of the popularity of this recently formed niche, a flurry of new companies are offering online backup. There are a few things to investigate before choosing whom to buy from. First, be sure to ask what kind of encryption the firm offers for your data. Second, you should know how long restores will take. It is also important to see if a company offers SLAs or not; a higher monthly rate may be worth it if there are more performance guarantees. Finally, be sure to ask if your choice is a reseller. If it is, investigate the service itself to be sure that it is a good match for your business.
