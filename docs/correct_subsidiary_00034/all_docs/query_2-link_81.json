Our solutions empower customers to think ahead, take control of their security infrastructure, and predict and prevent IT security threats.\n\nOrganizations have to predict security threats â not just react to them\n\nToday, the majority of security spending is focused on solutions that take defensive or reactive approaches to threats. As a result, security teams are saddled with overwhelming amounts of disparate security data, tools that don't communicate, and alerts that sound only after the damage has been done. Organizations that seek to survive and thrive must go on the offensive and predict and preempt threats before it's too late.\n\nWe empower organizations to preempt business risk\n\nAt CORE Security, we believe the greatest risk organizations can take is to remain reactive to IT security threats. We therefore enable our customers to proactively identify critical threats and reveal risk in the context of specific business objectives, operational processes, and regulatory mandates. As a result, security teams not only predict threats but also more effectively communicate their implications to peers in the line of business.\n\nCORE Security Solutions CORE Insight Enterprise:\n\nEnterprise-class predictive security intelligence platform\n\nBusiness risk identification, validation and prioritization\n\nContinuous threat simulation\n\nProactive threat replication\n\nCORE IMPACT Professional:\n\nComprehensive vulnerability assessment and testing software\n\nReal-world, exploit-based security testing\n\nNetwork, web, client-side, wireless & mobile coverage\n\nCORE WebVerify:\n\nWeb application testing software\n\nAutomated testing of custom web sites and applications\n\nProactive identification of OWASP Top 10 threats\n\nCORE CloudInspect:\n\nSecurity testing SaaS for Amazon AWS cloud deployments\n\nAffordable, on-demand cloud security assessment\n\nNo prior Amazon authorization required\n\nCORE Services\n\nSecurity consulting services\n\nProduct implementation services\n\nOnsite and online training\n\nCustomer support (24/7 available)\n\nCORE Security Benefits\n\nAlign with corporate goals\n\nProtect brand, reputation and valuation\n\nRetain customers and avoid fines / penalties\n\nAlign with performance objectives\n\nPrevent system downtime\n\nMitigate risks to intellectual property and customer data\n\nComply with policies and regulations\n\nAddress PCI, FISMA/NIST, HIPAA, SOX, GLBA, etc.\n\nIncrease efficiency and effectiveness\n\nIncrease security assessment scope and frequency\n\nOptimize headcount and consulting resources\n\nPractice process excellence\n\nConduct documented, repeatable security assessments\n\nValidate security using established best practices\n\nCORE Security helps more than 1,400 customers worldwide preempt critical security threats throughout their IT environments, and communicate related risk to the business.

The consumerization of IT, including BYOD, and the broad adoption of virtualization and the cloud bring new capabilities to organizations. But as network guests, contractors, employees, and partners all need differing levels of access, across a variety of devices, to resources that might be located virtually anywhere, IT teams also realize that traditional security models are ill-equipped to address the new security demands and threats that this network revolution is bringing. The Cisco SecureX security strategy is designed to address the new network and security landscape. SecureX is based on four key concepts: First, any effective security strategy needs to leverage the intelligence and footprint of the network as its foundation, because every user, device, and resource is attached to the network. Second, security needs to exist within the framework of dynamic context - understanding the who, what, when, where, and how of every user, device, and traffic flow. Third, security is only as good as its awareness of the threats. Cisco's Security Intelligence Operations, the largest threat telemetry database in the world, analyzes real time data from over 700,000 appliances, 30 billion web requests, 1/3 of the world's email messages, and over 150 million endpoint devices every single day, resulting in over 8 million daily security updates fed continuously to Cisco's family of security products. And fourth, the ability to define and distribute security policies that allow organizations to see every device, control access to resources, and leverage the network itself must be part of a unified policy enforcement strategy. Combined, these elements of Cisco SecureX enable the flexible, any-device connectivity that organizations want with the accurate, effective enforcement that they need, across the entire distributed network environment.Cisco provides the industry's largest portfolio of security products and solutions in every form factor, including appliances, cloud, virtualized, and integrated network security offerings. These include the next-generation, context-based ASA security appliance, email and web content security, IPS sensors, the AnyConnect mobile security client, and TrustSec's identity-based access control enabled by the new Identity Services Engine.Cisco is proud to be a BlackHat sponsor.
