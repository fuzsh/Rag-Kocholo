PCT MicroTubeTM Adapter Kit* for Pressure-Enhanced Enzymatic Proteolysis 1 hr Trypsin Digest with PCT 12 hr Trypsin Digest No PCT Pressure Cycling Technology (PCT) Discovery Starts with Sample PreparationTM *Patent Pending\n\n2. Pressure BioSciences, Inc. Pressure BioSciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBIO) is a life sciences company focused on the development and commercialization of a novel, enabling platform technology called Pressure Cycling Technology (“PCT”). Barocycler PCT Sample Preparation System The Pressure Cycling Technology Sample Preparation System (“PCT SPS”) employs rapid cycles of hydrostatic pressure, between ambient and ultra high levels, to precisely control biomolecular interactions. The PCT SPS can be used to accelerate enzymatic reactions, such as protein digestion with trypsin and other proteolytic enzymes, to prepare samples for analysis by mass spectrometry. In addition, the PCT SPS can be used to disrupt tissues and cells to extract cellular structures and components such proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and small molecules for further analysis. The PCT SPS is comprised of a Barocycler (a small, semi-automated bench top instrument used to generate high, hydrostatic pressure) and specially designed single-use processing tubes. Temperature can be controlled during the PCT-based sample preparation process by an external circulating water bath, which can be an important addition to the Pressure Cycling Technology Sample Preparation System. “PCT offers clear advantages over our standard method of sample prep, including shorter processing time, higher throughput, and reduced operating costs – and all without sacrificing quality. We found these advantages so significant that we recently incorporated PCT into our standard mass spec proteomics analysis workflow.” Dr. Shane Burgess Director, Life Science and Biotechnology Institute Mississippi State University PCT MicroTube Adapter Kit* Processing time, sample throughput, accuracy, efficiency, and standardization are key elements of the sample preparation process for mass spectrometry. The PCT MicroTube Adapter Kit, in combination with the PCT SPS, can reliably and reproducibly control the enzymatic digestion of proteins while reducing the time of digestion from hours to minutes with the same or better quality as other, currently available techniques. The PCT MicroTube Adapter Kit comes complete with an ergonomically designed, space-saving Work Station containing PCT MicroTubes and PCT MicroCaps, as well as tools and hardware, to enable the user to process from one to forty eight samples simultaneously in the PCT SPS. * Patent Pending PCT MicroTube Adapter Kit\n\n3. PCT MicroTube* The PCT MicroTube was designed to meet the critical requirements of modern proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry. It is made from a fluoropolymer, fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). This polymer was selected because of its unique features. FEP is highly inert and retains its integrity within an extremely wide temperature range (-200oC to +100oC). The PCT MicroTube’s outstanding chemical resistance, non-wetting surface, and negligible protein and nucleic acid adsorption, help to ensure nearly complete sample recovery, features that are essential for high pressure-enhanced enzymatic proteolysis. * Patent Pending PCT MicroCap* PCT MicroCaps were also designed to meet the critical requirements of modern proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry. They are made from polytetraflouroethylene PCT M icroCaps (PTFE), a polymer selected for features that are ideal for high pressure applications. The PCT MicroCap is Indent for available in three designs, designated 50, 100, or 150. Picking G el Plug Each MicroCap design designates an approximate reaction volume. By selecting a particular MicroCap type, samples may be digested in reaction volumes of approximately 50, 100 and 150 mL. In addition, all PCT MicroCaps have the 100 µ L added unique feature of being able to be used as gel spot pickers to excise and transport small protein spots from a 150 µ L gel. The PCT MicroCap holds the gel protein spot safely within the cap, while it is transferred to the PCT MicroTube, 50 µ L ready for processing by PCT. * Patent Pending “Incorporating PCT into our standard mass spec workflow has resulted in several significant advantages, including an improved number of unique peptides identified and a reduction in undesired protein modifications…and now with the new PCT MicroTube Adapter Kit, throughput will no longer be a bottleneck.” Dr. Paul Pevsner New York University School of Medicine Suggested PCT Workflow\n\n4. “PCT results in identification of more unique peptides than our standard sample preparation technique for mass spectrometry. It appears that PCT may also be highly successful in digesting and recovery of very complex samples, an area of great difficulty at the present time. These advantages, coupled with the unique characteristics of the recently designed PCT MicroTubes, offer researchers working in mass spectrometry-based proteomics a wonderful new tool for scientific discovery.” Dr. Alexander R. Ivanov Harvard School of Public Health Figure 1. Quantitative Profiling of Peptide Abundance for In-Solution Digested Model Proteins. Selected examples illustrate superior digestion efficiency and peptide recovery using PCT. Data provided by Dr. Alexander Ivanov, Harvard School of Public Health Figure 2. PCT significantly increases digestion efficiency and peptide recovery following in-solution digestion. Digestion was performed using an array of conditions, as indicated. LC-MS was performed on C-18, 10 cm x 150 µm (VC-10-C18WS-150EU) column using a 30 minute 5-60% gradient (A: 0.1% formic acid; B: acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) Peptides were detected on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer with ETD ionization source; Alternating ETD/CID spectra were collected and the data were analyzed using Proteome discoverer software with 1% FDR data filtering to determine sequence coverage and the total number of peptides. Peak areas for selected peptides were measured using LCquan package for each LC/MS run (9 runs per digest condition). Values were normalized to the average area obtained for each peptide (n=72). Median values from each set of 9 LC/MS runs for each peptide and each condition are presented. Data provided by Dr. Roger Biringer, Thermo Fischer Scientific\n\n5. Figure 3. PCT-assisted digestion has been shown to increase efficiency and peptide recovery from gel-separated proteins. New consumable containers offer features which facilitate gel spot picking using a combination of disposable gel cutter tool combined with the tube closure. Data provided by Dr. Michail Alterman, CBER, FDA. “We believe that this new patent pending sample containment and processing system, combined with the unique power of PCT, gives the researcher extraordinary ability to gain new knowledge using today’s analytical identification techniques, such as mass spectrometry. Based on the results from our beta site testers, we believe that our PCT MicroTube Adapter Kit can benefit a large segment of the proteomics and genomics research community.” Dr. Edmund Ting Sr. VP of Engineering Pressure BioSciences, Inc Features and Benefits of the PCT SPS and PCT MicroTubes • Standardize Protein Digestion for Mass Spectrometry • Substantially Increase Protein Digestion Efficiency • Significantly Accelerate In-Solution and In-Gel Protein Digestion • Promote Accurate & Efficient Peptide Cleavage • Avoid Undesired Protein Modifications Due to Prolonged Digestion Time • Process Up to 48 Samples at a Time • Versatile Range of Sample Sizes (50-150 µL) • Compatible with a Variety of Proteolytic Enzymes • Inert, Non-Wetting, Single-Use MicroTube Processing Containers • Unique MicroCap Design for Protein Spot Transfer from Acrylamide Gels ."
