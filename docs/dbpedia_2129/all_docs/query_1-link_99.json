        "text": "The finest tunes about brotherly love and sisterly solidarity.\n\nThe bond between siblings is a rich and complicated one that varies from family to family. Brothers and sisters can be friends, rivals, confidants, co-conspirators and bitter enemies—possibly all at the same time. No wonder there have been so many brilliant songs on the subject.\n\nTo honor this rich musical history, we’ve created a list of the 20 best songs about siblings. Selections include classics about brotherly love, odes to sisterly solidarity and one left-field depiction of taboo familial loving that only Prince would dare attempt. In addition to The Purple One, the featured artists range from Elvis Presley to ’60s soul giants to British Invasion rockers to modern art-pop auteur Grimes. Billy Idol snags a spot with a sneering ’80s fave, and Canadian punks PUP check in with a song that’ll have you thinking twice about going camping with your sister. Plus, They Might Be Giants remind us that TV theme songs can sometimes be transcendent.\n\nWhile all of the songs are very different, they share at least one thing in common: They describe relationships with people we don’t get to choose. In life, we theoretically get to pick our friends and lovers, but our brothers and sisters are just kind of there. Ideally, we love them and want only the best for them—but we sometimes loathe, envy, or worry deeply for them. The 20 songs on our list touch on all of these feelings and more, presenting complex family dynamics in the form of easily digestible slices of pop. Even only kids will dig them.\n\n“Sibling Rivalry,” PUP\n\nPUP lead singer Stefan Babcock and his sister have a funny tradition of taking each other on terrifying camping trips. As described in this 2019 pop-punk rager, they’ve gone rafting through sewage and barely survived freak Chilean snowstorms. “I’m not trying to stick it to you,” Babcock sings to his sis, hella annoyed but somehow still enjoying himself. “But who thought of this in the first place?”\n\n“Come Dancing,” The Kinks\n\nWith brass and organ reminiscent of Britain’s pre-rock music-hall days, “Come Dancing” is a sweet song about how time passes and people change but certain things stay the same. It’s all about Kinks leader Ray Davies’ sister—a onetime teenage heartbreaker who’s now all grown up, worrying about her daughter smooching boys on the front steps. This being a Kinks tune, there’s a whiff of melancholy, and it comes in the final verse: “She knows they get away with things she never could,” Davies sings of his big sis. “But if I asked her, I wonder if she would.”\n\n“Boss of Me,” They Might Be Giants\n\nBest remembered as the theme to TV’s Malcolm in the Middle, “Boss of Me” is a punk-ska anthem for nerdy younger brothers and sisters everywhere. While the lyrics don’t explicitly mention sibling squabbling, it’s about refusing to be pushed around by someone just because they’ve got a few years and/or inches on you. The lesson: “Life is unfair.”\n\n“Little Sister,” Elvis Presley\n\nWhen the King gets cheated on, he doesn’t throw in the towel. He simply works his way down the sibling chain and gives his two-timing ex’s kid sister a try. “Little sister don’t you do what your big sister done,” Elvis warns over twangy guitars with just a hint of menace in his voice. Or else what—he goes after the mother?\n\n“We Are Family,” Sister Sledge\n\nPenned by Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers of Chic, this disco-soul solidarity anthem applies to all kinds of families—not just the ones united by blood. “Just let me state for the record,” the ladies of Sister Sledge sing, “we’re giving love in a family dose.” Guaranteed to make even the most dysfunctional siblings butt-bump on the dance floor\n\n“He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother,” The Hollies\n\nThe harmonica is but one of many heartwarming elements in this song about brothers helping brothers, no matter the cost. The title phrase comes from a slogan for Boys Town, a famed community for homeless youth, and the piano comes compliments of Elton John, who falls in with the tastefully saccharine strings to deliver an emotional knockout.\n\n“Little Brother,” Ella Vos\n\nIndie-pop singer Ella Vos has never shied away from heavy subjects. She’s sung about abortion and postpartum depression, and this 2016 song was written after her younger brother was involved in a car accident. “Stay close, little brother,” Vos sings tenderly, promising to always have his back. “I know your true colors.”\n\n“White Wedding,” Billy Idol\n\nLegend has it that Billy Idol wrote this taunting 1983 new-wave classic as a dig against his sister, who was pregnant and engaged. Except there was no drama with her real-life shotgun wedding. With lines like, “Hey little sister, what have you done?” Idol was thinking back to a time when such things were considered highly scandalous. Idol has described this song’s narrator as an “incestous, kind of sick brother,” and that adds a whole other level to the bizarre family drama he so gleefully describes.\n\n“You and Your Sister,” Chris Bell\n\nAs co-leader of the pioneering power-pop band Big Star, Chris Bell co-wrote and sang poignant, tuneful guitar ditties that should’ve been huge hits. “You and Your Sister,” the B-side to the debut solo single he released in 1978, shortly before his death, is a pure-hearted love song for a girl whose sister thinks he’s no good. This doubting sis is only mentioned in one line—which happens to feature harmony vocals from Bell’s old bandmate Alex Chilton—but her disapproval is clearly dragging this innocent soul down.\n\n\"My Brother's a Basehead,\" De La Soul\n\nDespite the lighthearted vibe of the music—based around a sample of Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders’ 1965 No. 1 “The Game of Love”—this tale of addiction is no joke. De La rhymer Pos is angry and frustrated as he watches his brother graduate from weed to crack, with predictably disastrous results. “Unlike the other drugs where you had control,” he raps, “this substance has engulfed your body and soul.”\n\n\"When We Grow Up,\" Diana Ross\n\nSome kids dream of being astronauts or pop stars or the first woman president. On this sweet piece of ‘70s pop, Diana Ross tells her best friend—presumably her brother, though not necessarily—that all she wants in the future is for them to remain close. Note the feminist subtext in the second verse: She’s already figuring society will make him an engineer and her a perfumed lady in gloves.\n\n“Alfie,” Lily Allen\n\nSupposedly driven by concern, not scorn, Lily Allen spends the entirety of this song—the fourth single off her excellent 2006 debut, Alright, Still—marching through her brother’s room and cataloging his shortcomings. It seems he’s a lazy stoner addicted to TV and video games, and Lily thinks he needs to get off his butt and find a job. Thankfully, he did. Alfie Allen is now a successful actor best known for playing Theon Greyjoy on Game of Thrones. He even earned an Emmy nomination in 2019.\n\n\"My Sister Says the Saddest Things,\" Grimes\n\nThe words aren’t intelligible unless you read along with the lyric sheet and use some imagination, but this ghostly 2010 electro-pop jam is all about feeling. It finds Grimes on a late-night stroll with her only friend, the sister who’ll keep all her secrets—like why she needs to “cry on the 4th of July,” or why she sings like a mystical nymph who’s wandered into the world of Twin Peaks.\n\n“My Sister,” Juliana Hatfield Three\n\nSo many emotions in this alt-rock favorite—the first one being anger, which Hatfield spells out rather plainly in the first verse: “I hate my sister / she’s such a bitch.” Juliana also respects her big sis for being cool, envies her for being good at everything, and misses her because she left home before she could take her to see the Violent Femmes\n\n\"My Little Brother Just Discovered Rock and Roll,\" Art Brut\n\nArt Brut lead talker Eddie Argos can only sit back and watch while his 22-year-old brother goes mental for indie rock. “There’s a noise in his head and he’s out of control,” a frazzled Argos says over precisely the kind of punky guitars his troubled sibling probably fancies. If Argos were really concerned, he’d have made this a jazz song.\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nSign Up"
