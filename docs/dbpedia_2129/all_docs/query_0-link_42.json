        "text": "\"Billboards\" is four choreographers' ballets rolled into one, danced magnificently by the Joffrey Ballet to the recorded music of a composer identified in the Brooklyn Academy of Music's current program as Prince Rogers Nelson.\n\nYes, that's how he wishes to be billed, although an asterisk on the same program reveals the open secret that he uses the \"stage name, Prince.\"\n\nWhatever you call him or \"Billboards,\" the entire production was given a dynamic New York premiere on Tuesday night at the opening of a weeklong run, part of the Next Wave festival at the Academy (30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene).\n\nLong before Prince became a star or sold 10 million copies of \"Purple Rain,\" the Joffrey had pioneered the most successful rock ballets of the 1960's and early 70's. If not a pop ballet to end all pop ballets, \"Billboards\" -- even by the Joffrey's standards -- is a mammoth enterprise within the genre.\n\nHere is the ultimate crossover ballet: a sprawling, clever reflection of the uneasy cultural mix of our time. Classical and popular dance styles meet in \"Billboards\" as if there were no borders; images of sexual bravado beat a cautious retreat; trendy attitudes carry their built-in irony.\n\nIn many ways, \"Billboards\" is more of a must for mainstream audiences than for the diehard Prince fan. True, the latter will discover how four experimental choreographers can march so differently to the same drummer. Laura Dean, Charles Moulton, Margo Sappington and Peter Pucci were invited by Gerald Arpino, the Joffrey's artistic director, to give their takes on Prince's music.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
