        "text": "I am of German-Nigerian descent and grew up bilingual, speaking english and german, in a Turkish neighborhood in Wiesbaden, Germany, which hosts one of the biggest US military bases. I moved to London when I was 19, where I started making a living as an artist and now I live between Los Angeles and Berlin. Reflecting on my upbringing and lifestyle, of which my music is a result, I would say that there is no real genre / box to fit me into. I cross too many borders to just be at home in one place, but industrial and genre fluid I would definitely see applicable here.\n\nLearn your lesson, remain high (in spirit) and keep it moving. You will get it right on your next cycle.\n\nWhich song? DONTTOUCHMYDRUGS? yess, its cuz the song is about protecting your peace, being shamelessly hedonistic. Its simple, “back up bitch, don’t touch my drugs, right!“\n\nYou & Me\n\nI usually find inspiration in everything. But the US is different, everything here is extreme. In Berlin and Western Europe in general, the extreme happens in hidden places, In darkrooms. In NYC & LA the extreme happens in broad daylight, right on the street. If my life outside of America fueled my creativity, my life in America is kerosine.\n\nMy music has evolved a lot since then, I have grown as a human and as an artist. After BMA I had other big records like Benz | I know, Emotions etc. but all of these songs have a different sound than Bury Me Alive. I never was really only taking place in one genre, which reflects my and our all lives. some minor, some major but we’re all constantly going through changes – thus, the changes in my sound are an extension of me.\n\nI don’t force it.\n\nDONTTOUCHMYDRUGS is a peace of music I made in order to express a side of me that is unapologetically hedonistic. I let go, I celebrate, dance, feel alive, I feel myself with this song and you can too, let this be your drug instead.\n\nThe Berlin music scene has been on fire, there are so many talented artists that are blending techno, house and rap and pushing creative boundaries. I feel proud to represent a new wave of artists coming out of Europe, but if you want to understand the German music scene in 2023, GERMAN ANGST is all you gotta know.\n\nI made this project to help me tackle anxiety that I dealt with for the first time in my life, right after the pandemic. I needed something to keep my brain stimulated and my feet moving when I was out and about again.\n\nI opened the door. Music has the power to inspire, heal, educate, if I get to play even a small part in opening the door to anyone to feel connected through my music, that’s dope.\n\nCONNECT WITH KELVYN COLT\n\nINSTAGRAM | SPOTTIFY | YOUTUBE\n\nPhotos | VITALI GELWICH"
