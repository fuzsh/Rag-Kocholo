There were tons of amazing joints being played but one track had me vibing with the rocksteady beat and laughing at the super rudeboy lyrics!\n\nOn this 1967 gem, Prince Buster delivers his ten commandments to women. Yes, yes… I know the lyrics are suuuuper sexist but it was just a different time.\n\nCommandment #11: Go make me a sandwich. Right now!\n\nShare — Facebook Twitter Copy Link"
