        "text": "The Dragon Prince currently features four soundtrack albums and an exclusive vinyl record, including various background music of the Netflix series. They are available on Spotify and purchasable through iTunes and Apple Music.[1]\n\nInformation[]\n\nThe soundtrack of The Dragon Prince is composed by Emmy Award-winning German composer Frederik Wiedmann. In discussing the composition of music for the program's third season, he stated that he took the show's music in new directions based on the characters becoming braver and more courageous, and also based on the program's new romance element. He used a Celtic fiddle as a representative instrument for Rayla and a cello for King Harrow. Asked to name one track that he felt would best represent the entire series, he suggested \"Leap\" from the third season.[2]\n\nBook One: Moon/Season One Soundtrack[]\n\n# Track List Time 1 The Dragon Prince – Main Title 0:34 2 Long Ago, in Xadia 3:30 3 Brothers 1:00 4 Mercy 1:16 5 The Jelly Tart Heist 0:40 6 My Heart for Xadia 1:53 7 Sheer Courage 1:43 8 Not That Simple 2:08 9 Last Sunset 1:39 10 Smoky Seekers 1:33 11 Moonlight Battle 2:12 12 Up to Us Now 2:38 13 Flash, Woof, Zap, Slash! 2:25 14 A Message of Death 2:05 15 Valley of Graves 1:28 16 Pyre 1:32 17 Hello, Sister 1:20 18 All the Bad Feelings 1:30 19 Doubtful Intentions 2:24 20 Snow-nami 3:32 21 Through the Ice 1:22 22 Miracle on the Cursed Caldera 1:13 23 It's a Fun Spell 1:22 24 The Other Bad News 1:13 25 A Huger, Scarier Monster 2:13 26 Worse Than Death 2:14 27 Turn Back 1:01 28 Do Not Touch Those Webs 1:01 29 The Jerk Face Dance 0:47 30 Guardian of the Moon Nexus 2:50 31 Fading Quickly 4:16 32 Azymondias 2:38 33 End Credits – The Power to Change Everything 0:43\n\nBook Two: Sky/Season Two Soundtrack[]\n\n# Track List Time 1 Encounter at the Breach 2:49 2 The Moon Nexus 1:09 3 Only Human 3:06 4 In the Moon Temple 1:44 5 Slidey-Sling Go-Fast Rope 1:08 6 The Half-Moon 1:37 7 Nothing, Nothing, Nothing! 1:18 8 How Am I Going To Tell Him?
