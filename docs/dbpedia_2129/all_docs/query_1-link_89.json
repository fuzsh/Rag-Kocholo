        "text": "OK, this is not a discussion about if Prince was gay or not. I find Prince's entertainment and drag queens style similar - for example, when Prince and Morris exchanged insults/ putdowns, Prince's effeminate appearance and behaviour.\n\nOf course, Prince didn't go completely to extending what is a woman like drag queens. Consider this - you have a man who wears makeup like a woman and dresses kinda like a woman, yet has a street attitude and will hurl insults to anyone in their way - while still putting on a great show. Quite similar to drag queens.\n\nYou insentive clod!\n\nHow can you call someone a 'drag queen' in these times of LGBTQ-whateverness?\n\nYou should be using different wordings to not insult, yes, certain individuals.\n\nAlso you should use different wordings to be more correct, more precise.\n\nSo please try again.\n\n.\n\nAnd I do know that insulted people choose to be insulted.\n\n.\n\nSo, no, I would not call Prince a drag queen.\n\nNot even in his most femiinine outfit. (please show it)\n\nshort answer no.\n\nFrom what I can work out Prince was always dressed in a masculine way from his point of view. The makeup thing had been pretty standard in rocknroll for a long time and only really falling away in the homophobic AIDS-fearing Reagan era, obviously which is where Prince was in his prime, but there's a big difference between growing up in the 60s and 70s and growing up in the 80s and beyond.\n\nThat's just me musing, it's actually a huge question. He also liked to fuck with people.\n\nAnd you haven't really defined what you mean by \"neo\"\n\n[Edited 8/10/20 4:42am]\n\nCertainly that cover art for Lovesexy's tourbook seemed \"drag\".\n\nBut outside of that it seems to fall into the theatrical extravagance of Liberace or Elton John, but all referencing his musical influences, or fashion forward designs, often designs originally for women, but re-tailored to fit a man.\n\nI still remember him coming out at one of the latter shows at Paisley Park in 2002 to sing \"Empty Room\" in an outfit (not a dress) with long long royal wedding style train dragging behind. I wish there was pic! I think it was red. It was outrageous theatricallity for a very theatrical and dramatic song.\n\nSoftSkarlettLovisa said:\n\nOK, this is not a discussion about if Prince was gay or not.

Quite similar to drag queens.\n\nThis is one of the lowest, most ignorant, and homophobic posts. I don't know why it seems pertinent to delve into such depths of ludicrousness. Who thinks drag queens just wear makeup and hurls insults?? We could fill a room with what clearly isn't known, by some, about drag queens, and apparently a small warehouse with what seems to be unknown about Prince.\n\nWhen you know better, you do better. And now you know better.\n\nYou P.C. Police Orgers really need a Bill Maher session.\n\nYou sound pathetically paranoid and defensive.\n\nAggressive, even.\n\nNo need to resort to \"lowest\", \"most ignorant\", \"homophobic\" or \"rude\".\n\nGet off your platform boots.\n\nThe OP was referring to the caricature Prince could sometimes project,\n\ncomparing it to the caricature Drag Queens project,\n\nbecause yes, they put up a show, that's what they do,\n\nit's a night life role, they impersonate an enhanced, exaggerated persona\n\nand it's assumed as such by themselves in the first place.\n\nYou don't see them going to their day job dressed in fuchsia glitters.\n\nAnd fair enough, Prince sometimes projected an image close to caricature.\n\nIt's called entertainment.\n\nRarely a man in show-business\n\nhas put so much gloop on their eyes.\n\nIt made him sexy as hell, but still, that's some serious make-up.\n\nAnd the OP isn't that far gone. A Drag Queen claims\n\nhis masculinity behind the extravaganza, otherwise we're talking transsexual.\n\nIt's assumed that you'll find balls under the skirt.\n\nIt's a manifesto, with fun (night-life) as its core.\n\nPrince did wear make-up and lace props, he was extravagant\n\nyet he was still presenting a very masculine stance.\n\nJust as Little Richard homosexuality left little doubt.\n\nEmbodying a caricature, wearing a mask,\n\nthat's what showmen and women,\n\nwhatever their physical sex, do (except for the boring bland ones).\n\nIt's theater, not necessarily their identity.\n\nSure, it can be, but then it ceases to be entertainment.\n\nHaving said that, the OP has clearly very little knowledge\n\nof what sort of persona a Drag Queen is.\n\n[Edited 8/10/20 13:07pm]\n\nudo said:\n\nYou insentive clod!\n\nHow can you call someone a 'drag queen' in these times of LGBTQ-whateverness?\n\nYou should be using different wordings to not insult, yes, certain individuals.\n\nAlso you should use different wordings to be more correct, more precise.\n\nSo please try again.\n\n.\n\nAnd I do know that insulted people choose to be insulted.\n\n.\n\nSo, no, I would not call Prince a drag queen.\n\nNot even in his most femiinine outfit. (please show it)\n\nYou're acting like the LGBTQ+ community is overly sensitive, but you're the one crusading against them because you don't like using proper pronouns and terminology I can't deal with this\n\nDisclaimer: certainly no Drag Queen outfit,\n\nbut we're getting pretty close to \"over the top\",\n\nwhich is what Drag Queens look for as an effect.\n\nSure, the thread is all provocation that borders on trolling,\n\nbut Prince's extravaganza remains an interesting topic,\n\nbecause the reason for it is not easy to pinpoint.\n\nHow far can a man go in exploring his feminity before gender issues arise?\n\nEven in this, women are treated unfairly, because the moment\n\nthey stop wearing make-up and cut their hair, they're butch.\n\nConditioning is a hard thing to shake off, for most.\n\nWe're back to the social identity question Prince has always brought upfront,\n\nsince when he first started exploring with his camera,\n\non the cover of \"The Beautiful Ones\" (the bio).\n\nI still stand on the theory that Prince was going for appearing as \"partner in crime\" to women.\n\nThe \"I'm on your side\" kind of nod. \"I can lend you my mascara\".\n\n\"I understand you\". That was his approach in seduction, because\n\nhe couldn't count on being six-feet tall, or on blatant masculine attributes (as definied in the seventies and eighties).\n\nIn hindsight, pretty much. But nobody really looked at it that way and intent is everything.\n\nAlso drag can mean a lot of things, it doesn't mean you have to 100% impersonate a woman.\n\nI don't know how every one of us hasn't had that moment of looking back at Prince and thinking \"He didn't just push it, that was full on\".\n\nThe Morris and Prince banter isn't drag shade but everyone is taking a lot from Little Richard there.\n\nudo said:\n\njaawwnn said:\n\nMaybe yeah, but I seriously doubt Prince considered it drag.\n\n.\n\nWhat elements in this picture do some consider drag? (to get things clear)\n\nI see no attempt to look female.\n\nIt is just the makeup. Perhaps the type of gloves.\n\nSo if he were made up diffrently it would be a non-issue.\n\nYeah, the face makeup and the gloves and the big earrings.\n\nListen, I know it's not drag, and you know it's not drag, but I also know my mates and some of them would look at that and go \"why is he dressed like a girl?\"\n\nudo said:\n\njaawwnn said:\n\nMaybe yeah, but I seriously doubt Prince considred it drag.\n\n.\n\nWhat elements in this picture do some consider drag? (to get things clear)\n\nI see no attempt to look female.\n\nIt is just the makeup. Perhaps the type of gloves.\n\nSo if he were made up diffrently it would be a non-issue.\n\nOn the Lovesexy tourbook all this looks \"woman\" mode: His hair, the traditional female makeup that is exagerrated into unnatural colors, the gloves, the sequin background, and the attitude. All seem overtly drag. I think this was prince trying to do a drag look for sure. And a worn out, frazzled drag look too!\n\nBut the original post was could Prince be considered to be in a neo-drag kind of theme in his normal Prince style.\n\nWell maybe the truth comes out when you see comedians or impersontators doing their version of Prince. Without the actual person, and just the details of style, you see what the elements are and how they fall upon average perception.\n\nIn contrast this is not drag:\n\n[Edited 8/11/20 9:32am]"
