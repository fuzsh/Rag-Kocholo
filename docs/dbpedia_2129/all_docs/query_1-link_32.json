        "text": "Prince Rogers Nelson, more commonly known as Prince, has died at the age of 57. As one of the best-selling recording artists ever, he will be remembered for his extraordinary contribution to music and his ability to connect with multiple generations of listeners.\n\nRead More: Prince, Icon of Pop Music, Dies at 57\n\nOne such fan that he made an impression on was Dave Chappelle, who created a hilarious sketch for his Comedy Central series Chappelle’s Show that focused entirely on the Purple One. In the segment, Charlie Murphy recounts the “True Hollywood Story” of a game of basketball he and his friends played against Prince and the Revolution. The bit is both a parody of Prince and a loving tribute to him, featuring iconic lines such as, “Why don’t you purify yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka?,” and, “Game: Blouses.”\n\nRead More: See Prince’s Life in Photos\n\nPrince went on to confirm that the incident was indeed based on a true story and said that he was a huge fan of the retelling. In 2013, he debuted the single “Breakfast Can Wait,” an homage to the sketch that was released alongside cover art featuring Chappelle dressed in a “Purple Rain” era costume.\n\nIn an email statement to TIME, Charlie Murphy expressed his grief over the news of Prince’s passing. “I’m blown away,” he said. “May he rest in peace. Music has lost one of its greatest icons.”"
