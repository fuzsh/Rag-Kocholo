        "text": "In 1993, my best friend and his father died in a car crash. I was 16, and it was hard to take. Your song Dreams seemed to help us make some sense of it. What inspired you to write it? TopperJK\n\nIt started as a poem about how every time I took a step closer to my dreams of singing and writing songs, they seemed to move further out of my grasp. There were various incidents. When I was singing covers in a club someone told me I’d never amount to anything more. When I was unemployed a guy saw that my middle name was Gabrielle and said: “I can’t imagine that name in lights, can you?” People said I couldn’t be a star with a lazy eyelid. So it was about being down to me whether I was going to sink or swim. Did I believe their negativity or did I believe in myself? I’m sad to hear that story, but I’m glad you were able to find some kind of solace in the song.\n\nRise – the song and the whole album – were so uplifting they got me through a very dark period. What inspired you? ddhillon365\n\nMy life had fallen apart because of a certain highly publicised event that saw me disappearing for a while. So that song was about that association being over and the album was my return to the industry. The song’s about hope and hanging in there through dire situations, sung by someone who lived to tell the tale. When I sing it now, it’s almost like it isn’t about me, because I can’t believe I was where I was. The song was written with Ferdy Unger-Hamilton, who signed me, and Ollie Dagois. Ferdy was a huge Bob Dylan fan and presented me with the music from Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door. I wrote over the chords and unbeknownst to me it was sent to Bob Dylan, who loved it. I’m eternally grateful and proud that such a legend allowed us to use it because we didn’t plagiarise it and I like to think we did him justice. I didn’t get any threatening letters from people saying, “What have you done to Bob?!”\n\nYour album Rise, particularly the song Over You, helped me get through my first breakup. Have any albums or songs moved or inspired you? cherylgriffin\n\nWhite Ladder by David Gray. When a relationship broke up I had that song on repeat for weeks, months even. It helped a lot. I’m a huge fan of his and got to meet him, and short of acting like a stalker, I was trying to just hold his hand and say: “It’s really nice to meet you.”\n\nIs it true that you once turned down the opportunity to perform on stage with Prince? VerulamiumParkRanger\n\nYes, because I’m a scaredy cat. It was in Abu Dhabi and I was at the side of the stage with Nicole Scherzinger. During one song, he wanted us both to come on and sing and dance. I was in awe of him and how gorgeous she was with her amazing vocals, and just couldn’t do it. It was all down to my insecurity. I’m kicking myself now and today I would do it but some things are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I did go to a couple of his parties, though. One that night and one in the US. What can I say? He was Prince.\n\nYou were brilliant on The Masked Singer. How much were you involved in the process of designing the Harlequin costume? Yoshi2010\n\nWhen you’re approached to do it, they have different costumes and characters. If there was an outfit with trousers or a catsuit, that wasn’t going to happen, so I chose to be Harlequin. Then you don’t have an ultimate choice in the design, but you get to see what it’s like and they ask how you feel about it. I had a corset made. Then the mask was put on. It was great until I tried to sing in it. Then I wanted to die. I was menopausal, really hot, and had a panic attack for the first time in my life. Once they made it easier for me I was able to enjoy the process. I love the fact that it introduced me to a younger generation. Later I found out that Joss Stone did it when she was pregnant and didn’t moan at all.\n\nAs a new artist, there was a relatively long gap between your initial success and Give Me a Little More Time. Were you nervous about being out of the spotlight? JacquelinePearce\n\nYeah, because after the first album I became a mum. Then I was nervous of my return because as an artist you’re always nervous about releasing new music. In my naivety I didn’t really take on board that if you take time out, there’s going to be all these new people to compete with. It worked out, but I’m sure a few of my label bosses lost a bit of hair.\n\nWhat did you do while you were away from the spotlight again? dfyorkie\n\nI’d been away from my two kids so much, I thought: “Do they even know I’m their mum?” So after 2007, I took an 11-year hiatus. By the time the kids were older, I was ready to come back, and I’ve been able to enjoy touring and everything else from a different perspective, rather than that of a mother who’s constantly worrying.\n\nWhen you worked with East 17 [on If You Ever], were they good boys or was it carnage? catchy-titled\n\nI do not have one complaint against those boys. They were gentlemen. Brian, Tony, John, Terry … they were all flipping lovely. If there was any carnage, I wasn’t part of it.\n\nWhat memories do you have of meeting Nelson Mandela? VerulamiumParkRanger\n\nOh my gosh. Just a glorious moment. I’m not into politics, but I was asked to go to the Labour party conference in Brighton, and he was there. After the rehearsals he came over and said: “I wanted to come and dance and sing with you.” I’m like: “You should have done.” He was really lovely. I kept telling myself to stay cool but I wanted to scream. This man was in prison for all those years and still forgave the people that imprisoned him and tried to get a better deal for his country regarding apartheid. Whenever I see the photograph, I’m like: “Wow, I actually got to meet him.”\n\nIf you could pick an artist to duet with, who would it be and why? cherylgriffin\n\nI don’t work with loads of other people but on my new album, A Place in Your Heart, I have just worked with Mahalia. I met her when we opened for Adele and she was on the bill. She’s amazing and if you hear her voice, you have to shut up and listen.\n\nDid your dreams come true? LintonTravelTavern\n\nI would say so. Because I think back to when I was a kid when we were leaving school and writing in each other’s books, someone put: “I hope to see you on Top of the Pops.” Obviously people felt that in no way that would actually happen. Now I’m in my 50s and still doing what I love the most. So my dreams have come true and they are continuing to come true."
