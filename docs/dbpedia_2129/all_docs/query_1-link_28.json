        "text": "He’s reclaiming the title of “London Boy.” For his birthday, Prince William took his children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, to the first night of the Taylor Swift Eras Tour in London and had a grand ol’ time. He experienced every Swiftie’s dream: meeting American royalty, being a part of Swift’s Instagram hard launch of Travis Kelce, and hearing the “Hits Different” and “Death by a Thousand Cuts” mash-up; it’s the surprise-song jackpot. During the show, the future king of England was caught grooving to “Shake It Off.” The royal guards even played it upon Swift’s arrival to London. What more could he have possibly wanted?\n\nMaybe, just maybe, he was hoping to hear a special song during the surprise-song segment. Here are five guesses of what tracks Prince William had on his wish list.\n\n5. “Now That We Don’t Talk”\n\nIf we had to pick another danceable 1989 track not already on the set list, it’d be this one. It’s catchy and about another Brit (Harry Styles). Maybe it’s also a way for him to understand a different Harry — his brother, since they’re still not really on speaking terms. Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, do have new icons …\n\n4. “Message in a Bottle”\n\nThis song was once described to me as a Trolls 2 vibe. Willy’s got three kids at home who probably have jumped around to the Trolls movies; they have some bangers (and mash), and he clearly loves to bust a move! It also has a small London reference as well; gotta keep it local.\n\n3. “End Game”\n\nWhile the song itself doesn’t have any explicit English references, the music video includes Swift’s favorite kebab shop, Kentish Delight. She reportedly places a huge order of kebabs after her Friday concert.\n\n2. “Macavity”\n\nFrom one London boy to another, Swift sang Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Macavity” in the Cats movie, and since she did a mash-up with “Crazier” a few weeks ago, anything’s fair game.\n\n1. “Livin’ on a Prayer”"
