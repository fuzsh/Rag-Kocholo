        "text": "It's been almost a year since Prince formally declared the Internet to be \"completely over,\" and now the artist formerly known as a symbol is back on his Web-hating soap box. \"I personally can't stand digital music,\" said Prince in an interview with the Guardian. \"You're getting sound in bits. It affects a different place in your brain. When you play it back, you can't feel anything. We're analog people, not digital.\" And the other problem with the Internet according to Prince? The lack of regulation when it comes to copyrighted content available for free on the Web. \"The industry changed,\" continued Prince. \"We made money [online] before piracy was real crazy. Nobody's making money now except phone companies, Apple and Google. It's like the gold rush out there. Or a carjacking. So I'll just hold off on recording.\" While we shouldn't expect a new album from the artist anytime soon, we can certainly rest assured that he'll be coming to a town near you, at least for one (or 21) nights.\n\nWith a combined 10 GRAMMY Awards, comedian Stephen Colbert and producer/musician Jack White are adding another commonality notch to their belts in the form of a musical collaboration. White and his Nashville-based Third Man Records have produced Colbert's recent single \"Charlene II (I'm Over You),\" the follow-up to the comedian's '80s new wave release, \"Charlene (I'm Right Behind You).\" Colbert, along with his backup band — female goth rock group the Black Belles — premiered the single live on June 23 on \"The Colbert Report.\" The song is available for download at iTunes, but audiophiles can also purchase a limited-edition vinyl pressing in red, white and blue available from Third Man Records just in time for the Fourth of July holiday. But fans at iTunes are already looking ahead as one commenter wrote, \"Can't wait for Charlene III (Did You Get My Last Record?)!\"\n\nArguably one of music's biggest cult documentaries, Heavy Metal Parking Lot is celebrating its silver anniversary in 2011. Clocking in at just 17 minutes, it's a must-see for aspiring metal heads, and has received accolades from the likes of Oscar-winning writer/director Cameron Crowe, actor Ed Norton and Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl. The film captures the shirtless, beer-guzzling debauchery in the parking lot of the Capitol Centre in Landover, Md., leading up to a 1986 Judas Priest gig. It's lack of cinematography or tangible plot aside, part of the film's charm is its spontaneity. \"We certainly didn't go in with an agenda or plan, and 25 years later we are still trying to make sense of Heavy Metal Parking Lot,\" filmmaker Jeff Krulik told NPR, and said the production cost for the film was a mere $5 for a parking fee. Have any of these headbangers cut their mullets? Find out with a look at what the alumni from Heavy Metal Parking Lot are up to in 2011. And you can relive the film in all its devil-horn glory here.\n\nPolitics and music, as they say, make strange bedfellows. They also create a lot of licensing problems. The latest rocker to issue a take-down request is Tom Petty, who will ask the Michele Bachmann presidential campaign to refrain from using his \"American Girl\" in any campaign-related endeavors, according to an NBC report. Musicians issuing cease-and-desists to politicians trying to co-opt popular songs or musicians into their campaigns has a long contemporary tradition. In 1984 presidential candidate Ronald Reagan invoked Bruce Springsteen during a stump speech, trying to hitch his star to Springsteen's working class fans. In 2008 John McCain apologized to Jackson Browne for using \"Running On Empty.\" That same year California state senatorial candidate Chuck Devore had to make a similar mea culpa to Don Henley for appropriating \"The Boys Of Summer\" and \"All She Wants To Do Is Dance.\" The grandfather of all political apologies to musicians came in 2010 when U.S. Senate candidate Charlie Crist took to YouTube to issue an official apology to David Byrne for his unauthorized use of \"Road To Nowhere.\" As for Bachmann, maybe this would have been a better choice for her campaign stop.\n\nAfter she wore a dress made completely out of raw meat to the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, and arrived encased in an egg shell to the 53rd Annual GRAMMY Awards in February, Lady Gaga has certainly made a name for herself as a raw (no pun intended) and edgy fashionista. With the help of social media network Tumblr, Gaga has created a home for all of her fashion forays in the form of a photo blog titled Amen Fashion. So far, the Fame Monster has posted several entries that picture her showcasing a wide array of styles, from the self-dubbed \"Tokyo Unicorn\" to her \"Born To Kill Look.\" And, not for the faint of heart, there's also an image of the organ featured in her \"Alejandro\" video with a post that reads, \"He ate my heart, so I put his in the Alejandro video.\" Moral of the story? Don't eat Gaga's heart, but feel free to get a taste of her fashion sense.\n\nWhite House party crasher Michaele Salahi made her recording debut back in March and made her live-singing debut (or at least live lip-syncing debut) last week on an NBC affiliate in Miami. Neither events made the splash she and husband Tareq made in 2009 when they crashed an official White House dinner for Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as part of a reality TV stunt. The song, \"Bump It,\" a club-flavored dance track, is available at iTunes, where customer reviewer Klaus Von Bong commented: \"Dump it.\"\n\nPlaceholder for invalid migrated embed (See migrate logs for details).\n\nPitbull's \"Give Me Everything\" featuring Afrojack, Ne-Yo and Nayer is No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and LMFAO's \"Party Rock Anthem\" featuring Lauren Bennett and GoonRock is tops on iTunes singles chart.\n\nAny news we've missed? Comment below.\n\nFor the latest GRAMMY news, visit us on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nLast Week In Music\n\nClosing out the ceremony with her first performance in four years since being diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome, Celine Dion delivered a stunning rendition of Edith Piaf’s everlasting classic, \"L’Hymne à l’amour\" from the Eiffel Tower. Her impressive vocals made it seem as though she had never left.\n\nThis performance marked Dion’s return to the Olympic stage; she previously performed \"The Power of the Dream\" with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and composer David Foster for the 1996 Olympics.\n\nAxelle Saint-Cirel\n\nPerforming the National Anthem is no small feat, yet French mezzo-soprano Axelle Saint-Cirel knocked it out of the park.\n\nDressed in a French-flag-inspired Dior gown, she delivered a stunning rendition of \"La Marseillaise\" from the roof of the Grand Palais, infusing the patriotic anthem with her own contemporary twist.\n\nWith the stirring lyrics, \"To arms, citizens! Form your battalions. Let’s march, let’s march,\" Saint-Cirel brought the spirit of patriotism resonated powerfully throughout the city.\n\nGojira\n\nMaking history as the first metal band to perform at the Olympics Opening Ceremony is just one way Gojira made their mark at the event.\n\nThe French band took the stage at the Conciergerie, a historic site that once housed French kings during medieval times and later became a prison during the French Revolution, famously detaining Marie Antoinette – Creating a monumental moment as the first metal band to perform at the ceremony, but also stirring the pot as they used the chance to nod toward politics.\n\nPerforming a revamped version of \"Ah! Ça Ira,\" an anthem that grew popular during the French Revolution, the artists aren’t new to using their songs as a vehicle for political messages. The GRAMMY-nominated group are outspoken about issues concerning the environment, particularly with their song, \"Amazonia,\" which called out the climate crisis in the Amazon Rainforest. Using music to spread awareness about political issues is about as metal as it gets.\n\nAya Nakamura\n\nCurrently France’s most-streamed musician, Aya Nakamura went for gold in a striking metallic outfit as she took the stage alongside members of the French Republican Guard. As there were showstopping, blazing fireworks going off behind her, she performed two of her own hit songs, \"Pookie\" and \"Djadja,\" then followed with renditions of Charles Aznavour’s \"For Me Formidable\" and \"La Bohème.\"\n\nAlthough there was backlash regarding Nakamura’s suitability for performing at the ceremony, French President Emmanuel Macron dismissed the criticism. \"She speaks to a good number of our fellow citizens and I think she is absolutely in her rightful place in an opening or closing ceremony,\" Macron told the Guardian.\n\nA key architect of Petty Country was the man's longtime producer, George Drakoulias. \"He's worked with Dad for a hundred years since [1994's] Wildflowers, and he has super exquisite taste,\" Adria says.\n\nIn reaching out to prospective contributors, he and fellow music supervisor Randall Poster started at the top: none other than Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton. \"Having Willie and Dolly made people stand up and pay attention,\" Dreakoulias told Rolling Stone, and the Nashville floodgates were opened: Thomas Rhett (\"Wildflowers\"), Brothers Osborne (\"I Won't Back Down\"), Lady A (\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\"), and so many others.\n\nEach artist gave Petty's work a distinctive, personal spin. Luke Combs jets down the highway of \"Runnin' Down the Dream\" like he was born to ride. Along with Yo-Yo Ma and founding Heartbreakers keyboardist Benmont Tench, Rhiannon Giddens scoops out the electronics and plumbs the droning, haunting essence of \"Don't Come Around Here No More.\"\n\nAnd where a lesser tribute album would have lacquered over the songs with homogenous Nashville production, Petty Country is the opposite.\n\n\"I'm not a fan of having a singular producer on records like this. I want each one of them to be their own little crown jewel,\" Borchetta says. \"That's going to give us a better opportunity for them to make the record in their own image.\"\n\nThis could mean a take that hews to the original, or casts an entirely new light on it. \"Dierks called up and said, 'Hey, do you think we would be all right doing a little bit more of a bluegrass feel to it?' I was like, 'Absolutely. If you hear it, go get it.'\"\n\n\"It had the diversity that the Petty women like on the records,\" Adria says, elaborating that they wanted women and people of color on the roster. \"We like to see those tributes to Tom reflect his values; he was always very pro-woman, which is why he has such outspoken women [laughs] in his wake.\""
