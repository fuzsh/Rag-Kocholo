A music video was also produced to promote the single.[2]\n\nReleases\n\n[edit]\n\nThe UK CD single was released as a two separate discs which fit in a double jewel case that was included with the first disc. Both discs had different picture sleeves and different contents, other than a \"radio edit\" of \"The Holy River\" and edit of \"Somebody's Somebody\" (also from Emancipation). Disc one also included two remixes of \"Somebody's Somebody\": a \"Livestudio Mix\" and an \"Ultrafantasy Edit\". Both were mostly re-recorded versions of the song with additional lyrics. Disc 2 included the previously released \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Mustang Mix)\" and a one-minute commercial called \"On Sale Now!\". The UK cassette single was the same as disc 2, but without \"On Sale Now\".\n\nA US promotional release was sent to pop radio stations at the same time as \"Somebody's Somebody\" was sent to Urban radio stations, it was also made available to consumers for free, and only through book chain, Borders Music. It was a cassette single with the previously unreleased \"Welcome 2 the Dawn\", advertised as being from the upcoming album The Dawn. In reality, the song was later released on The Truth.\n\nExcluding the re-release of \"1999\", \"The Holy River\"/\"Somebody's Somebody\" became his final UK Top 40 single in his lifetime.\n\nComposition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe mid-tempo number features a guitar melody without a chorus. It climaxes in a searing guitar and Pipe organ solo.\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nDavid Stubbs from Melody Maker felt the song found TAFKAP \"at his most limpid, most William Blake-like, in his sexual mysticism.\"[3] Music Week gave the song three out of five, describing it as \"a tasteful, restrained rock ballad stripped of funk pretension. Low-key, but still pleasant.\"[4] David Sinclair from The Times wrote, \"Gentle pop tune from the scandalously underrated Emancipation album.\"[5]\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nWeekly chart performance for \"The Holy River\" Chart (1997) Peak\n\nposition Belgium (Ultratip Bubbling Under Flanders)[6] 4 Germany (Official German Charts)[7] 92 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40 Tipparade)[8] 10 Netherlands (Single Top 100)[9] 63 US Hot 100 Airplay (Billboard) 58 US Mainstream Top 40 (Billboard) 19 US Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks (Billboard) 31\n\nWeekly chart performance for \"The Holy River/Somebody's Somebody\" Chart (1997) Peak\n\nposition Scotland (OCC)[10] 22 UK Singles (OCC)[11] 19"
