        "text": "Did you know that Nicholas Galitzine can sing? After watching the endearing Red, White and Royal Blue karaoke scene or the 2021 reboot of Cinderella, you might have wondered whether the British actor was relying on age-old Hollywood magic or complete vocal dubbing. Well, we're happy to report that Nicholas Galitzine can actually, really, truly sing, and he's good.\n\nThe next time Galitzine is set to showcase his vocal skills on-screen is in his forthcoming rom-com with Anne Hathaway The Idea of You, in which he plays Hayes Campbell, the frontman of fictional hit boyband August Moon. (Hayes is believed to be largely inspired by Harry Styles.)\n\nGalitzine takes to social media to show off his pipes on a pretty regular basis, amassing a pretty impressive collection of pop covers. (Oh, and he plays guitar too, NBD.) The actor-singer has covered artists like Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo, Lady Gaga, and even Fleetwood Mac. Sit back, relax, and keep scrolling to watch Nicholas Galitzine sing his heart out.\n\n“You're On Your Own, Kid” by Taylor Swift\n\nGalitzine covered Swift's Midnights track with just his acoustic guitar for accompaniment in a recent video — snuck in an IG photo dump posted on November 2, 2023 — which was quickly shared and praised by Swifties worldwide. “'You’re On Your Own, Kid (Nick’s Version),'” one person commented.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n“Vampire” by Olivia Rodrigo\n\nIt seems that, like the rest of us, Galitzine couldn't get enough of Olivia Rodrigo's first GUTS single “Vampire.\" The actor covered it with his trusty guitar, and now we want a duet.\n\n“Best Part” by Daniel Caesar and H.E.R.\n\nGalitzine also occasionally shares covers on TikTok, and his cover of Daniel Caesar and H.E.R.'s song “Best Part” had fans swooning — and earning the video over one million likes and almost seven million views. “I’m no popstar but i do enjoy a sing song,” he wrote in the caption. (And now he's soon to play a pop star. Don't you love a full circle moment?)\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n“God is a Woman” by Ariana Grande\n\nIn 2019, Galitzine covered Ariana Grande's “God is a Woman” and joked that it had taken him a few tries to nail the performance, but it's safe to say he definitely did.\n\n“Summertime Sadness” by Lana Del Rey\n\nGalitzine previously posted two covers to his YouTube channel, including a pitch-perfect cover of Lana Del Rey's hit “Summertime Sadness.”\n\n“Landslide” by Fleetwood Mac\n\nGalitzine also took on Fleetwood Mac's beloved “Landslide” via his YouTube channel with an acoustic cover posted in 2019. “I did [a] cover of Landslide as I continue to write my own music,” he wrote in the video's description. “It's only a taster but I hope you enjoy my take on this Fleetwood Mac classic, which is pretty much an illustration of the geography of my heart.”\n\n“Glimpse of Us” by Joji\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n“In my ‘sad boy’ era,” Galitzine captioned this cover of Joji's “Glimpse of Us\" posted to TikTok in 2022. Wait, he plays piano, too? “Tell me one thing he can’t do,” one fan commented, reading everyone's minds.\n\nRed, White & Royal Blue (2022)\n\nGalitzine takes the mic as Prince Henry and has to try to tone down his vocal chops for the performance, given that Henry isn't supposed to be a great singer while drunk. Despite that little detail, Galitzine still does sound pretty good while performing a rendition of Queen's “Don't Stop Me Now.”\n\nBonus: “Comfort” by Nicholas Galitzine\n\nGalitzine doesn't only cover other musicians' songs; he also writes his own! His song “Comfort,\" about the loneliness of life hopping between sets and hotels and a reluctance to commit to a relationship, dropped during summer 2022."
