        "text": "Also known as 'the Young Pretender', Prince Charles Edward Stuart was the grandson of the deposed Catholic King James VII of Scotland and II of England. He and his followers believed the throne of Great Britain rightfully belonged to the House of Stuart, and led the campaign, known as the Jacobite Risings of 1745, to overthrow King George II.\n\nAlthough the handsome prince and his troops experienced some successes in battle against the Hanoverian forces, Charles was eventually halted at the Battle of Culloden in 1746 by the Duke of Cumberland and the Red Coats; the bloody clash was to be the last major battle ever fought on British soil. The tale of the Bonnie Prince Charlie's escape is now legendary and has inspired both song and story.\n\nFind out more about the life and times of this Jacobite hero\n\n1. ISLE OF ERISKAY\n\nFollow the Bonnie Prince Charlie Trail through the Outer Hebrides. The Isle of Eriskay was the first place where he set foot on Scottish soil and is where he started his campaign. The islands are also where he initially fled to after the defeat at Culloden.\n\n2. CULLODEN BATTLEFIELD\n\nAt Culloden Battlefield and Visitor Centre, uncover what happened on that fateful day in April 1746. Immerse yourself in the battle experience and examine archaeological evidence from the site.\n\n3. CULLODEN HOUSE\n\nStay in the place where Bonnie Prince Charlie took up his battlefield headquarters. Rich in history, the beautiful Culloden House is now a luxurious country house hotel.\n\nFind out more about the Bonnie Prince Charlie Trail\n\nFind out more about Culloden Battlefield and Visitor Centre\n\nFind out more about Culloden House\n\n4. GLENFINNAN MONUMENT\n\nSee the Glenfinnan Monument, dramatically set at the head of Loch Shiel in the west Highlands. In the visitor centre, discover the story of the '45, Risings and tour the structure itself. Glenfinnan is the place where Charles rallied the clans loyal to the Stuart cause and started the final Risings.\n\n5. WEST HIGHLAND MUSEUM\n\nAt the West Highland Museum in Fort William, you can see the Bonnie Prince's death mask, sword, and some of his clothing, including his fine silk waistcoat, as well as other Jacobite artefacts.\n\n6. MUSEUM OF ISLAND LIFE\n\nOn the Isle of Skye, just behind the Museum of Island Life, lies a memorial to Flora MacDonald, the Jacobite sympathiser who helped Charles escape Scotland following the defeat at Culloden by disguising him as a maid and smuggling him by boat.\n\n7. PERTH MUSEUM\n\nFollowing a multi-million transformation of the former City Hall, Perth Museum will open its doors to the public on Easter weekend 2024. In addition to becoming the new home of the legendary Stone of Destiny, Bonnie Prince Charlieâ€™s sword and a rare Jacobite wine glass will also both go on public display for the very first time. It's the first time the sword has returned to Scotland since it was forged in Perth in 1739.\n\nFind out more about Glenfinnan Monument\n\nFind out more about West Highland Museum\n\nFind out more about the Museum of Island Life\n\nFind out more about Perth Museum"
