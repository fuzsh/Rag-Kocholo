        "text": "SIDE 1\n\nMUFASA\n\n(looks out over the Pridelands)\n\nLook, Simba: Everything the light touches is our kingdom.\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nWow...\n\nMUFASA\n\nA king s time as ruler rises and falls like the sun. One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king.\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nAnd this ll all be mine?\n\nMUFASA\n\nEverything\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\n(in awe)\n\nEverything the light touches...\n\n(looks off in the distance)\n\nWhat about that shadowy place way out there?\n\nMUFASA\n\nThat s beyond our borders. You must never go there, Simba.\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nBut I thought a king can do whatever he wants.\n\nMUFASA\n\nWell, there s a lot more to being a king than getting your way all the time.\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\n(pointing in the distance)\n\nDad, what are those birds over there?\n\nMUFASA\n\nThey re buzzards.\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nThey re scary. Why don t you chase em away?\n\nMUFASA\n\nI don t have to. They re doing what they re supposed to do. You see, Simba, everything exists in a delicate balance. As king, you need to understand that balance and respect all creatures from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope.\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nBut Dad, don t we eat the antelope?\n\nMUFASA\n\nYes, but when we die, our bodies become the grass, and the antelope eat the grass. Everything is connected in the great circle of life.\n\nSIDE 2\n\n(SCAR lounges in the shade. YOUNG SIMBA enters.)\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nHey, Uncle Scar! Guess what? I'm gonna be king of Pride Rock!\n\nSCAR\n\nOh, goodie. Well, forgive me for not leaping for joy. Bad back, you know.\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nMy dad just showed me the whole kingdom! And I'm gonna rule it all!\n\nSCAR\n\n(scheming)\n\nReally? He didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border, did he?\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nWell, no. He said I can't go there.\n\nSCAR\n\nAnd he's absolutely right! It's far too dangerous. Only the bravest of lions go there.\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nWell, I'm brave. What's out there?\n\nSCAR\n\nI'm sorry, Simba... I just can't tell you.\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nWhy not?\n\nSCAR\n\nAn elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince.\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nAn elephant what?\n\nSCAR\n\nOops.\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nWhoa!\n\nSCAR\n\nOh dear, I've said too much. Well, I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later - you being so clever and all. Just promise me you'll never visit that dreadful place.\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nNo problem, Uncle Scar.\n\nSCAR\n\nThere's a good lad. You run along now and have fun. And remember: It's our little secret.\n\nSIDE 3\n\nZAZU\n\nStep lively! The sooner we get to the waterhole, the sooner we can leave!\n\n(SIMBA and NALA whisper conspiratorially.)\n\nYOUNG NALA\n\nSo where're we really goin'?\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nAn elephant graveyard.\n\nYOUNG NALA\n\n(loudly)\n\nWow!\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nShhhh! Zazu...\n\nYOUNG NALA\n\nRight. So how're we gonna ditch the dodo?\n\n(YOUNG SIMBA and YOUNG NALA huddle. ZAZU, thrilled, flies to them.)\n\nZAZU\n\nOh, just look! Little seeds of romance blossoming in the savanna! And one day you two will be married!\n\nYOUNG SIMBA, YOUNG NALA\n\nYuck! Eewwww!\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nI can't marry her. She's my friend.\n\nYOUNG NALA\n\nYeah. It'd be too weird.\n\nZAZU\n\nWell, sorry to burst your bubble, but you two turtle doves have no choice. It's a tradition going back generations.\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nWell, when I'm king, that'll be the first thing to go.\n\nZAZU\n\nNot as long as I'm around.\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nIn that case, you're fired.\n\nZAZU\n\nNice try. But only the king can do that.\n\nYOUNG NALA\n\nWell, he is the future king.\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nYeah! So you have to do what I tell you!\n\nZAZU\n\nNot yet , I don't! And with an attitude like that, I'm afraid you will be a pretty pathetic king, indeed!\n\nYOUNG SIMBA\n\nNot the way I see it!"
