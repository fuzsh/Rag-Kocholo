        "text": "While King Charles III may have been the centre of the royal coronation, it was also an important day for his wife, Camilla.\n\nFormerly the Queen Consort, Camilla also went through ceremonial procedures similar to Charles, leaving Westminster Abbey with a new title.\n\nSo why did Camilla gain the title Queen, and why was Prince Philip never named king? Here's what you need to know.\n\nWhy is Camilla's title now Queen?\n\nHistorically, the wives of sitting British monarchs have taken the title Queen.\n\nMost recently, Queen Elizabeth II's mother, Queen Elizabeth, was married to King George VI.\n\nHowever, for Camilla, there has been some controversy because she was not Charles's first wife.\n\nShe was granted the title the Queen Consort by the late Queen Elizabeth II in February last year during the Platinum Jubilee.\n\nHowever, her title first appeared as Queen Camilla when the coronation invitations were sent out.\n\nA royal source told CNN: \"It made sense to refer to Her Majesty as the Queen Consort in the early months of His Majesty's reign, to distinguish from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.\"\n\n\"The coronation is an appropriate time to start using 'Queen Camilla' in an official capacity,\" the royal source said.\n\n\"All former queen consorts have been known as 'Queen' plus their first name.\"\n\nIs Camilla Queen now?\n\nYes, but not in the same way as Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nShe still remains a queen consort as she is married to the sovereign.\n\nIf, like Elizabeth, she had ruled in her own right, she would be Queen Regnant.\n\nPrevious queen consorts have also dropped the consort part of the title.\n\nWhen did Charles marry Camilla?\n\nCharles married Diana Spencer, who became Princess Diana, in 1981.\n\nCamilla married Andrew Parker Bowles in 1973 but they divorced in 1995, shortly after Charles gave an explosive television interview admitting to an affair with Camilla.\n\nA year later, Charles and Diana were divorced.\n\nIn 1997, Diana died in a car crash. A global outpouring of grief followed.\n\nCamilla and Charles waited until 2005 to marry in a private civil ceremony.\n\nAt the time, the palace referred to her as the Princess Consort.\n\nCamilla has two children with Andrew Parker Bowles — Tom Parker Bowles and Laura Lopes — but does not have any children with Charles.\n\nWhy was Camilla's anointing different to Charles's?\n\nLike King Charles, Camilla was also anointed during the coronation — but, unlike Charles, or the previous queen consorts, her anointing was in public view.\n\nBuckingham Palace described the change from tradition as: \"Just one of a number of ways in which the service has been adapted, evolved, simplified without losing any of its magic and majesty.\"\n\nAlso changed in the ceremony: she only touched the ivory Queen Consort’s Rod with Dove, and the gold Queen Consort’s Sceptre with Cross, as opposed to holding them.\n\nShe was crowned with Queen Mary's Crown before the choir sang a new song, Make a Joyful Noise, composed by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber.\n\nWhy was Prince Philip never king consort?\n\nUnlike the royal women, the husbands in the monarchy have not taken the title of king.\n\nThis is for two reasons: Traditionally, the title of king can only be inherited, and because the king always outranks the queen.\n\nWhen Prince Philip married Queen Elizabeth II in 1947, he was given the titles of Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich.\n\nUnlike Camilla, he was not crowned at his spouse's 1953 coronation. Instead, he was officially made Prince Philip by Queen Elizabeth as declared in a new letters patent, in 1957."
