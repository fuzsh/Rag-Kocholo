        "text": "2016 will go down not only as a year of uncertainty, but also as one in which Generation X lost many of its beloved heroes.\n\nThe lost include David Bowie, Carrie Fisher, George Michael and A Tribe Called Quest's Phife Dog. Also taken were musical geniuses such as Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire and Leonard Cohen.\n\nEl Paso and the border also lost three of its iconic heroes — Juan Gabriel, Debbie Reynolds and local blues legend Long John Hunter. It also lost El Paso's No. 1 rock fan, \"Crazy\" Simon Zimerle.\n\nBut none hit me harder than the loss of my favorite musician, Prince.\n\nHere are some thoughts I posted to my El Paso Times blog on the day he died:\n\nHis name was Prince, and he was funky.\n\nI can never remember when it was that I first heard of Prince.\n\nAs an avid fan of MTV and of the legendary Steve Crosno’s nightly radio show on B-94 FM, I’m pretty sure I already had heard and jammed to “1999” and “Little Red Corvette” by the time my parents took my brother and me to see the movie “Purple Rain” at the “dollar movies” at Montwood.\n\n1983 was the year Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” ruled the music world (it was released in late 1982). But by 1984, the music world had been taken over by the Purple One. There were lunchroom debates about who was better, Prince or MJ? (Prince. Always Prince)\n\nI also can recall an older kid I looked up to singing “Little Red Corvette” in a school bus while we were on the way to a field trip, and thinking, \"Prince is cool.\" What an understatement.\n\nTo this day, I tease my mom over the fact that she let my dad take us to see “Purple Rain.” I had to have been in about third or fourth grade. My brother is four years younger than I am, and if you haven’t seen the theatrical version of the movie in a while, you might have forgotten how sexual the movie is. One more kid and my mom wouldn't have had enough hands to cover our eyes with.\n\nI know for sure, however, that the day I saw that movie was the day Prince won my complete, undivided devotion. Don’t get me wrong, I loved Michael. But this was Prince. And he was funky.\n\nThe theater was packed with kids who were older and who seemed a lot cooler than me, a skinny little kid with glasses. They had obviously seen the movie multiple times. They all knew every word to every song. They recited lines between Prince and his co-star, Apollonia — \"What's the initiation?\" \"You have to cleanse yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka.\"\n\nI was sold.\n\nI remember begging my uncle Max to dub me a cassette copy of the “Purple Rain” soundtrack. After weeks of him promising to do it, I finally complained to my mom that he had kept my blank cassette – only to find out he thought I was too young to have a copy.\n\nDid he not know I had already seen the movie?\n\nI finally recorded all of the songs straight off the TV to a tape recorder when the movie aired on cable. Yes, this is how I listened to “Purple Rain” for a good couple of years, at least.\n\nAnd I remember wishing against all odds that someone would take me to see Prince when the “Purple Rain” tour hit Las Cruces in 1985. Fat chance.\n\nBy middle school, my parents had separated and my dad was dating a woman with a son who was a year or two older than me. And best of all, he was also a Prince fan and had a lot of Prince’s catalog on cassette. Heaven.\n\nFlash forward another 10 years or so and the announcement came that Prince would once again be coming to perform in Las Cruces in 1997. I was beside myself.\n\nI bought two of the best tickets a college student’s money could afford. I took a very, very close friend at the time, Venessa.\n\nThe end of that friendship is still painful to me in some ways today, but I always remember fondly that we saw Prince together … and that she had to use the ladies’ room as soon as the lights dimmed. I was annoyed to say the least.\n\nJust a few days ago, my heart stopped when I heard Prince had been admitted to an emergency room in Illinois. But then he was released quickly, with reports saying he had the flu.\n\nI remember thinking, “What if Prince dies? Yeah right. The guy will probably live to be 80 or 90 and we’ll all be amazed at how great he still looks.”\n\nOne of my close DJ partners and I just had our second \"Prince vs. MJ\" night less than two weeks before you died. Surely, countless other DJs will now be playing your music this weekend.\n\nI wish I had the chance to see him perform live one more time.\n\nPrince Rogers Nelson died today.\n\nA genius. An American treasure. A sex symbol. (A symbol, period, for a while in the 1990s.) A guitar player. A funky technician. A “Controversy.” A “Dirty Mind.” A hero. An icon.\n\nYour music will always be a part of me.\n\nRest in peace.\n\nPrince Rogers Nelson – June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016."
