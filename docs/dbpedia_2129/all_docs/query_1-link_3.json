        "text": "It seems strange to relate now, but in the early years of Prince Rogers Nelson’s career, there were voices that doubted whether he would ever be truly successful.\n\nHe was clearly exceptionally talented and possessed a vision for his music that bordered on obstinacy: not only had he produced, arranged, performed every instrument and composed all but one song on his 1978 debut album For You, he had also somehow contrived to get a record contract with Warner Brothers that entitled him to complete artistic control, almost unheard of for a new artist.\n\nBut he was also a strange, shy, awkward figure, apparently unwilling to play the promotional game. His interviews were almost wilfully unrevealing; an early appearance on that venerable US music TV institution American Bandstand was such a disaster that host Dick Clark later claimed Prince was the most difficult artist he’d ever encountered on the show. How could anyone so apparently unwilling to play the game ever hope to make it?\n\nAs it turned out, Prince knew exactly what he was doing, even when it looked like he had no idea. The way he behaved as his career began in the late 70s would set a pattern for the rest of his life.\n\nHe was, if anything, even more lavishly talented than the credit that claimed he’d played 27 different instruments on For You suggested. He went on to make umpteen albums in a myriad of music styles: he could, it appeared, do everything from rock to funk to jazz to psychedelia.\n\nSome of the albums were better than others – his output was so torrential that not even he could completely maintain his quality control – but whatever they sounded like, they always sounded like Prince. And he was infinitely more obstinate than that first recording contract made him appear. For the best part of 40 years, he conducted his career according to a whimsical internal logic that seemed to baffle even his closest collaborators.\n\nWhole albums were inexplicably shelved, songs that could audibly have been huge hits confined to The Vault, the legendary space in his Paisley Park studio complex that apparently teemed with unreleased material. His stubbornness in dealing with record companies became so famous that at one point it threatened to overshadow the actual music he was making, a perhaps inevitable by-product of walking around with SLAVE written on his face to protest against the terms of his record deal.\n\nBut the strangeness and reticence that characterised his early interactions with the media were anything but a hindrance: he used them entirely to his advantage, turning himself into a genuinely mythic, unknowable figure in the process. His interviews were spectacularly unforthcoming about anything other than his music. He developed his own shorthand in which all his songs were written – U for you, “eye” instead of I – and at one point, he changed his name to a symbol: for a time, you were either supposed to refer to him as Victor or The Artist Formerly Known As Prince. “I am something that you’ll never understand,” he sang, knowingly, on I Would Die 4 U, a single from the album that made him a global superstar, 1984’s Purple Rain. It wasn’t hyperbole.\n\nThe initial consensus seemed to be that Prince was a kind of Minnesotan answer to Motown’s Rick James, intent on dragging R&B in a darker, more viscerally sexual direction; a reaction to the string-laden sumptuousness of disco. James certainly thought so, baldly accusing Prince of stealing his act when the two toured together, and indeed, you could see where the confusion arose.\n\nBoth had a penchant for performing in provocative outfits, both were unafraid of incorporating rock influences into their music – James dubbed his sound punk-funk, while Prince briefly and disastrously toured as a support to the Rolling Stones – and both were keen to parlay their success into svengali status: James with Teena Marie and the Mary Jane Girls, Prince with The Time and Vanity 6 among others.\n\nBut in retrospect, you can tell the two were cut from noticeably different cloth. Prince’s early albums seemed weirdly intent on picking at taboos, as if he were testing how far he could go, what he could get away with. It was one thing to write dirty funk tracks that upset the infamous Parents’ Music Resource Centre, quite another to write songs about incest. And his musical vision turned out to be vastly more complex. By the time of his 1982 commercial breakthrough, 1999, it encompassed everything from rockabilly to synthesised machine-funk he claimed was influenced by Blade Runner to piano ballads to unashamed pop. It might have seemed like self-indulgence and hard work had his songwriting not been of such an astonishingly high quality. Instead, it just sounded like a man with talent to burn.\n\nFor the next few years, he seldom put a foot wrong, however improbable the paths he chose to go down, producing arguably the greatest run of albums in the 1980s: Purple Rain, Around the World in a Day, Parade, Sign o’ the Times and Lovesexy. He seemed capable of perfectly balancing artistic and commercial concerns, never an easy trick to pull off. Every album he made was expansive, experimental and never the same as its predecessor, but every one came thickly larded with indelible hits. His live shows were spectacular: he was not merely a prodigiously gifted guitarist, but a hell of a performer. Moreover, they were never bound by the strictures of stadium pop. The setlists kept changing; there was always room for improvisation.\n\n1988’s Lovesexy was the last album of his flawless imperial phase – perhaps he was distracted, first by his desire to make movies (as evidenced by 1990’s disastrous Graffiti Bridge, his ability to act and direct was always more questionable than his musical judgment), then by his long-running dispute with Warner Brothers. The hits never dried up – he scored his solitary British number one in 1994 with The Most Beautiful Girl in the World – but his albums became noticeably more uneven: there was always fantastic music on them (even 1994’s derided Come contained a song as great as Letitgo), you just had to work a little harder to find it.\n\nIf he never quite regained the astonishing musical form he displayed in the mid-to-late-80s on record, his live performances could make you believe he was still an artist absolutely at the top of his game. The 21 concerts he played in London in 2007 were rapturously received, and his return to the capital in 2014 with a new all-female backing band called 3rdEyeGirl playing “hit and run” shows at small venues with little warning were both a media masterstroke and a wild artistic success. He kept his career in constant motion: always performing, always touting a new-found protégé, releasing albums with a dizzying frequency, invariably coming up with new ideas.\n\nHis latest was performing solo, accompanying himself on piano. “I have to challenge myself,” he told me late last year, “because I’m not one to get bad reviews.”\n\nI’d flown to Paisley Park, his studio complex in a suburb of Minneapolis, at short notice without being told why, although it transpired he had decided on a whim that he wanted to meet the press in order to announce a European tour. It was all rather confusing and chaotic and strange. He elected to be interviewed while seated at a keyboard, with representatives of the press literally gathered at his feet.\n\nThe representatives of the press didn’t get a great deal out of him. If he didn’t like a question, he would mutely shake his head and play the theme tune from The Twilight Zone. They would still get quite a story: if he wasn’t going to tell us anything about himself, he certainly gave us something to write about. Later that night he played, picking songs from his back catalogue apparently at random: Raspberry Beret, Girls and Boys, Something in the Water Does Not Compute. They sounded amazing. As ever, he was simultaneously impossibly gifted, completely unknowable – something you could never understand – and a man who knew exactly what he was doing."
