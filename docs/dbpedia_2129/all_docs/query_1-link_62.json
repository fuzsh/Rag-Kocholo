        "text": "Travis Kelce and his brother, Jason, received a protocol \"warning\" ahead of their meeting with Prince William at a Taylor Swift concert in London last week.\n\nOn an episode of the brothers' New Heights podcast, they described their uncertainty over the etiquette of greeting a member of the royal family. The prince and his two eldest children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, met Swift backstage at Wembley Stadium on June 21.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if I was supposed to, like, bow to them, curtsy, just be an American idiot and shake their hand,\" Travis, who is Swift's boyfriend and a Kansas City Chiefs tight end, told listeners. \"We wanted to be polite, especially on this side of the pond.\"\n\n\"We did get [a] warning because honestly we don't know,\" Jason said.\n\n\"But they said that because we weren't at, like, an official royal event, we didn't need to bow or curtsy,\" he continued. \"If it would have been like an official meeting or royalty event, then it would have been that. But I did still address him as Your Royal Highness.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Kensington Palace and Travis Kelce's representatives via email for comment.\n\nThe Context\n\nLast Friday, William took his two eldest children to Swift's concert on his 42nd birthday.\n\nThe royal party was photographed meeting the pop star and Kelce after the show. The images were released on Kensington Palace's official social media account and on Swift's.\n\n\"Happy Bday M8! London shows are off to a splendid start,\" Swift captioned her image.\n\nWhat We Know\n\nThe Kelce brothers praised William and the young royals in the Wednesday episode of their New Heights podcast.\n\n\"Dude, he was the coolest motherf*****,\" Travis said about William, adding that George and Charlotte were \"an absolute delight to meet.\"\n\nWilliam has met Swift before, having co-hosted a 2013 charity event at Kensington Palace with the singer to aid U.K. homelessness charity Centrepoint.\n\nAccompanied by Jon Bon Jovi, the prince and Swift sang onstage the New Jersey rocker's hit song \"Livin' on a Prayer.\"\n\nViews\n\nPrince William has not commented on his meeting with Swift and the Kelce brothers. However, in a post to the official Prince and Princess of Wales social media accounts he thanked the pop star.\n\n\"Thank you @taylorswift13 for a great evening!\" a photo of the prince and his two children with the singer was captioned. \"#LondonTSTheErastour.\"\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nSwift will return to London to perform five nights of her \"Eras\" tour show at the Wembley Stadium in August.\n\nAfter this, the star will perform dates in Canada—where she is set to wrap the tour in December—having grossed over $1 billion.\n\nJames Crawford-Smith is Newsweek's royal reporter, based in London. You can find him on X (formerly Twitter) at @jrcrawfordsmith and read his stories on Newsweek's The Royals Facebook page.\n\nDo you have a question about Charles and Camilla, William and Princess Kate, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, or their family that you would like our experienced royal correspondents to answer? Email royals@newsweek.com. We'd love to hear from you.\n\nUpdate 6/26/24, 11:20 a.m. ET: This story was updated with more information and background."
