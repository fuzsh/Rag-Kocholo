        "text": "Is anyone else in love with the live performance of this track at his birthday gig in '84? The guitar is so funky, his falsetto is so endearing, his dedication to Sheila E. is so sincere, it's like you can tell the Revolution is on the brink of world stardom when he plays this track bridging Free into Erotic City. For me, it's the most daring song of the show...\n\nwatcha all think of this song?\n\n\"Sitting in this cafe waiting for my baby........\"\n\n1.) I love songs where Prince sings lyrics that can be/obviously are from a females perspective -daring\n\n2.) I love the stripped down feel of the album cut\n\n3.) I love this live version by Prince and the Revolution (perfection)\n\n4.) Sheila E and band sorta imitate Prince's live version Steph or Miko cuts into a guitar solo too\n\n5.) Another example of the magestic sounds of the Purple Rain era\n\nrap said:\n\nWho is or should it be credited to - Prince or, Prince and the Revolution?\n\nWell the released album version is credited to Sheila E\n\n.\n\nA lot of these songs especially during the PR years were fleshed out with the Revolution, and a lot of those protege songs had a Prince and band 'version' and then a released version.\n\n.\n\nNoon Rendezvous reminds me of Desire. the studio session with Prince and the Revolution had a similar feel on both, the yearning and the guitar solos\n\n.\n\nI wonder about Next Time Wipe the Lipstick Off Your Collar(Glamorous Life) if there was a similar kind of studio take with more build and guitars(guitar solos)\n\nOldFriends4Sale said:\n\n2.)

That 18-minute rehearsal is such a magnetic ride. I must have listened to it 50 times over the years and it never feels like an 18-minute effort, it flows so brilliantly.\n\n.\n\nThe soundboard Birthday show of the live performance is a brilliant version too - merely lacking another 3 or 4 guitar solo minutes!\n\n.\n\nSheila's band did an excellent live version - a more muscular sound with some lovely guitar. Is it Miko?\n\n.\n\nThat era was fantastic for sure. I think the 90s covered more breadth of material but the quality in the 80s was so consistently high that it frightens me when I look at how easy it was for him to create magic. Adonis & Bathsheba anyone? Crazy talented.\n\nPorterUK said:\n\nOldFriends4Sale said:\n\n2.) I love the stripped down feel of the album cut\n\n3.)

Adonis & Bathsheba anyone? Crazy talented.\n\nYes I agree, the length makes you want even more. Not in a rush. That is one thing I loved about that time, it was like they were having a private party so no need to rush. \"You all can go home, we're just jamming\" -Prince\n\n.\n\nYes the Birthday show was brilliant, magical\n\n.\n\nYes I just watched Sheila E and band, they did a really good job, sounded like the album and Prince's live version but with their own touch. At least on the show I watched Steph B took the guitar solo and Benny had a bass solo, then they combined. Miko on guitar did co-lead vocals\n\nListen 2 how Sheila brings in the ending of Purple Rain on this one\n\n.\n\nYes, I can't get enough of Adonis & Bathsheba, and Go\n\nKeithyT said:\n\nWe've said it before and well say it again. Awesome. It's up there with Just My Imagination for me.\n\nWOW! It's right up there with Just My Imagination for you??? The birthday gig version?? I just relistened to it and the chciken grease guitar riffs in the beginning are to die for! Who is referring to when he says, \"Shake it Steve.\" Old Friends do you know? I think he also refers to a Steve coincidently at the small club show...\n\nI'm so happy you all dig it as much as I do... Isn't it a trip when you come across an old song that you've heard a bunch before ages ago but something suddenly clicks and you pick up the genius in the song you had been missing for years and can't stop listening to a song from '84!! I love when he says, \"Guitars and Drums\" and then instantly it's like...WOWWWWWW!!!!\n\nthx for sharing\n\nOldFriends4Sale said:\n\nrap said:\n\nWho is or should it be credited to - Prince or, Prince and the Revolution?\n\nWell the released album version is credited to Sheila E\n\n.\n\nA lot of these songs especially during the PR years were fleshed out with the Revolution, and a lot of those protege songs had a Prince and band 'version' and then a released version.\n\n.\n\nNoon Rendezvous reminds me of Desire. the studio session with Prince and the Revolution had a similar feel on both, the yearning and the guitar solos\n\n.\n\nI wonder about Next Time Wipe the Lipstick Off Your Collar(Glamorous Life) if there was a similar kind of studio take with more build and guitars(guitar solos)\n\nSo, the 18:40 min rehersal version I proudly own as of yesterday is called \"Neon Rendezvous\" and should be credited to Prince and the Revolution?\n\nComeHereLetMeCutYourHair said:\n\nKeithyT said:\n\nWe've said it before and well say it again.

The music all around songs celestial etherial"
