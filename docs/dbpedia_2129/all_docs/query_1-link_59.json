He sang it at home in Galloping Green, Foxrock, Co Dublin, on 5 December 1970 to Tom Munnelly and Hugh Shields. Jim Kelly learned Lord Abore from Frank Feeney and sang it to Tom Munnelly in OâDonoghueâs pub, Merrion Row, Dublin, in May 1970. Both recordings were included in 1985 on the Folk Music Society of Ireland anthology Early Ballads in Ireland 1968-1985, which was reissued on CD in 2015 by An GoÃ­lÃ­n.\n\nPeggy Seeger sang Harry Saunders in 1976 on her and Ewan MacCollâs Larrikin album No Tyme Lyke the Present. She noted:\n\nIn the ballads, blood flows thicker than water, and a good deal more often. The bulk of the strife is in the family, but it is rare to find a mother killing her son—her baby boy perhaps, but not her grown son. It is common, however, in both life and art to find conflict between the mother and the sonâs wife. In Harry Saunders (given the title of Prince Robert by Child) the struggle culminates in the death of the son. In one of Childâs texts, there is a revealing verse:\n\nIt is the fashion in oor countrie, mither,\n\nI dinna ken what it is here,\n\nTo like your wife better than your mither,\n\nThat … bought you sae dear.\n\nIn spite of the missing words, the meaning is clear. But the ballad is very rare. It is from the singing of F.C. Gainer of Tanner, Gilmer County, West Virginia.\n\nAl OâDonnell sang Lord Abore and Mary Flynn in 1978 on his Transatlantic / The Leader Tradition album Al OâDonnell 2.\n\nJackie Oates sang Lord Abore and Mary Flynn in 2006 on her eponymous first album Jackie Oates. She noted:\n\nThis is an Irish version of Child ballad 87 Prince Robert taught to me by Sean OâShee of Exeter. The song is a harrowing insight into the consequences of a motherâs overbearing motherliness!\n\nEwan McLennan sang Prince Robert in 2014 on his Fellside album Stories Still Untold. He commented:\n\nThis is a folk song that is typical of the more dark and epic murder stories involving parentsâ jealousy and fury towards a marriage they see as unacceptable.\n\nIt first appeared in Scottâs Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border in 1802 and became ‘Child #87’ in Francis J. Childâs seminal collection The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, where he published several variations of the text. In this recording Iâm singing the text version from Motherwellâs Minstrelsy Ancient and Modern collected from a Mrs Thompson. Although it shares some ‘floating verses’, the story in Prince Robert seems to be unique amongst the classic ballads.\n\nThe words were never printed with music and the melody that might have been sung with this ballad has been long lost. After trying, without great result, to write music for the song I put it to the tune of a similar Irish ballad, Lord Abore and Mary Flynn—it seems to work.\n\nSteve Byrne sang Prince Robert on the 2019 album Scottâs Sangs that revisited the ballads of Walter Scottâs Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border. Emily Lyle noted:\n\nAccording to Scott, this ballad is derived “from the recitation of a lady, nearly related to the Editor”, namely his motherâs sister in Edinburgh, Miss Christian Rutherford. It is a unique song that has not been recorded in the Scots song tradition in living memory.\n\nHowever, a rare version was found in Ireland in 1970 by ballad collector Tom Munnelly (1944-2007). Tom recorded it as Lord Abore and Mary Flynn from two singers in County Dublin, Jim Kelly and Frank Feeney (d. 1982). Feeney in turn had heard it from his late wife, who is not named, from County Carlow. The story of the songâs discovery is documented in Irish Folk Music Studies Vol. 1 (1972-3). Tom Munnelly passed the song on to Dublin singer A1 OâDonnell (1943-2015) who recorded it on the album Al OâDonnell 2 in 1978, which is where Steve Byrne first heard it, and found the melody fitted Scottâs words well. It is thought that ‘Lord Abore’ or ‘OâBore’ is a ‘mondegreen’, or mishearing, of ‘Lord Robert’.\n\nLankum sang Lord Abore and Mary Flynn in 2023 on their Rough Trade album False Lankum. They noted:\n\nLord Abore and Mary Flynn is an Irish version of the ballad Prince Robert (Child 87). Although Scottish in origin, this is the only version that could safely be said to have survived in the tradition. Although there is a related American ballad called Harry Saunders, this appears to be a relatively modern recreation of the song. It was thought to be extinct in this part of the world until the song collector Tom Munnelly happened to hear it being sung in a Dublin pub in 1969. The singer was Jim Kelly who had learnt it from Frank Feeney of Galloping Green, who in turn had learned it from his wife, a Carlow woman, whose name is, unfortunately, not noted. The two men can be heard singing their respective versions of the song on the album Early Ballads in Ireland 1968-1985.\n\nLyrics\n\nFrank Feeney sings Lord OâBore\n\nLord OâBore and Mary Flynn\n\nThe two were children young,\n\nThey were scarcely fourteen years of age\n\nWhen love between them sprung,\n\nWhen love between them sprung.\n\nLord OâBore was going out one day\n\nAnd says his mother to him,\n\n“Youâre going away, dear son,” she says,\n\n“Youâll drink before youâll go,\n\nOh, youâll drink before youâll go.”\n\nShe brought him down a bottle of wine\n\nAnd filled a glass for him,\n\nWith her false, her false, with her two fingers\n\nShe put strong poison in,\n\nOh, she put strong poison in.\n\n“Oh why, oh why dear mother,” he says,\n\n“Youâve poisoned me full sore?\n\n“Oh indeed itâs true, dear son,” she says,\n\n“Youâll see Mary Flynn no more,\n\nOh, youâll see Mary Flynn no more.”\n\n“Is there anybody in this house,” he says,\n\n“Would go on a message for me,\n\nWould go unto Mary Flynnâs tower\n\nAnd bring her here to me,\n\nOh, bring her here to me?”\n\nUp spoke a pretty-faced little boy\n\nWho was his sisterâs son:\n\n“Oh, I often went on your message before\n\nBut itâs now I have need to run,\n\nOh, itâs now I have need to run.”\n\n“Where are you going, my pretty little boy,\n\nOr what brought you here to me?\n\nYour grandma âpared a place for you\n\nAnd now invited thee,\n\nOh, now invited thee.”\n\n“Your grandma âpared no place for me\n\nNor either invited thee.”\n\nAnd soon she guessed of her pretty little boy\n\nThat Lord OâBore was dead,\n\nOh, Lord OâBore was dead.\n\n“Come saddle for me the swiftest horse,\n\nCome saddle for me the bay.\n\nCome saddle for me the swiftest horse\n\nThat ever ran that way,\n\nOh, that ever ran that way.”\n\nWhen she went to Lord OâBoreâs tower\n\nShe stepped into the hall,\n\nOh, the sheets were spread and the torches burn…\n\n“What brought you here, Mary Flynn?” she says,\n\n“What brought you here to me?”\n\n“Oh, the ring thatâs on his little finger\n\nI came to crave of thee,\n\nOh, I came to crave of thee.”\n\n“No ring, no ring, Mary Flynn” she says,\n\n“No ring have I for thee.\n\nFor the pain of death it came so quick,\n\nIt split the ring in three,\n\nOh, it split the ring in three.\n\nShe laid her feet beneath his feet,\n\nHer side down by his side.\n\nShe laid her head beneath his head\n\nAnd immediately she died,\n\nOh, immediately she died.\n\nJim Kelly sings Lord Abore\n\nLord Abore and Mary Flynn\n\nWere both children
