        "text": "Consider this a “Pre-Grammy” Drinking Think Piece of Business vs. Principles\n\nIntroduction\n\nI can understand if the first reaction to the headline is something like:\n\nWait, What? Prince fought for his Rights as an Artist! Maybe you don’t get it!\n\nSo I’d like to get in front of that, and try to do it the right way. As in, be clear. To the point.\n\nNumber One, I do understand Rights Management. Unlike Prince, I’ve never signed a RIAA contract, so I get 100% of my Official Releases and all Licensing power. I also understand a Compulsory License in the US allows re-interpretation by way of payment, and Remixes involve more than that, and my SoundCloud is littered with examples of not paying for either but not allowing Download or releasing for profit of those tracks. Fine line? Yes.\n\nNumber Two, I’ll show enough evidence that you’ll understand why I’m a firm believer in US Copyright Reform and Prince was a great example of an asshole when it comes to giving back. This is really an interesting combination of factors, published interviews, actions, and what 2017 looks like through the past behavior of, ahem, the “Music Business” as we know it because of what Copyright enables.\n\nThe Biggest Music Irony of Prince’s Death\n\nSo here’s where The Grammy’s “Tribute” or whatever is going to be a ridiculous irony of something I pointed out in 2016:\n\nP laying Prince’s songs live is called doing a “Cover” and he wanted to eliminate the ability to do Covers of his songs — and what did all sorts of Musicians do to pay their respects after he died? They did Covers of his music. You know, the very thing he wanted to eliminate.\n\nThe upcoming 2017 Grammy performance by [INSERT-NAME-OF-NOT-A-BRILLIANT-GUITARIST-HERE] will essentially be a crowning insult to Prince. Well, unless doing a Cover song of somebody else in the style of Prince for the induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, right? Huh.\n\nAlive, Prince fought Cover songs. Dead, Prince can’t fight Cover songs.\n\nTake a moment to consider how that works financially.\n\nAlways Worth More Dead\n\nWhen alive, Prince was famous for fighting with his record label, to the extent of changing his name to what often was typed out by Music Journalists as “The Artist Formerly Known as Prince” as a rebellion tactic. He obsessed over the Copyright powers to his tunes to the point of “Going Nuclear” against a Fair Use case involving a dancing toddler and a Prince song playing in the background on a stereo. Apparently he didn’t have a sense of humor.\n\nHe was the kind of guy that would say “No.” over and over to Weird Al. Really. Think about that for a minute.\n\nNow that Prince has died, Weird Al isn’t going to go flood the market with the never-approved material. Legally he could. Maybe after reading this, it might be a Moral Obligation to go ahead and release the never-approved material.\n\nPrince didn’t write out a Will, didn’t do any “Estate Planning” as it might be called, and, let’s be honest, considering he was an Opiate Addict Pill Head, it should’ve been something taken care of long before even the overdose on the Private Jet shortly before his last elevator ride. That wasn’t a good decision. But, I say this as somebody very sensitive to health and well-being, Prince didn’t make good decisions when it came to his body.\n\nNow the vultures get to set in.\n\nWhy Prince is a Copyright Reform Case Study\n\nBy wanting to control everything so much, Prince actually set up his squad of heirs and “Business Managers” to start profiting in ways that he would have completely hated. I feel like a psychic here. But it makes sense.\n\nBefore the end of 2017, we’ll hear a Prince song in a major TV commercial.\n\nEverything that was wrong about Prince trying to smother other interpretations by way of Copyright is how his family is going to — more than likely — sign whatever they can if the price is right for as long as Copyright lets them. Depending on the track, that’s 50–100 years. Why?\n\nThe system is broken when legal heirs who can’t play “Purple Rain” all the way through on guitar can inherit the Copyright to the song for decades. Realistically, that song should go to the Public Domain so every guitarist can do their version of “Purple Rain” without having to pay a cut to some Label, Publisher, Sister or Brother of Prince.\n\nI’d be okay with Life + 5 years. A catalog like Prince is a great example of how 5 years can be a profit window, some exclusivity, but knowing in a little while the material will re-enter the hopper of the Creative Realm. Music might be the example here, but do I feel the same way about Film, Writings, Software code, and that sort of stuff?\n\nYes. I genuinely do think that we live in a modern time — at least in the US — where the Spirit and Letter of Copyright have been extremely distorted. Instead of being in sync with how progress has reduced time and cost for Creative Pursuits (look at Garage Band on iPhone vs. Sun Studios 1960s), money and greed and Disney pushed things the other way.\n\nSharing is Caring…and the Irony of Selfishness\n\nI can understand why Prince had a difficult relationship with Rights Management, Record Labels, and the Music Industry — he signed really young in life. Like essentially drafted out of High School. Talent x 1,000.\n\nNone of the above tilts the scales away from labeling him an asshole when it comes to Rights Management as a participant in the Music Community. Even Radiohead called Prince out in public for being too into himself with somebody else’s material.\n\nThat’s what is so funny about the Covers by Musicians who wanted to pay their respects. If they really knew anything about Prince, they’d know that doing a Cover is something he’d dislike.\n\n…and what is about to go down at The Grammys? Uh-huh. Riiiight.\n\nEpilogue: Security Through Obscurity\n\nWhen Prince released two albums on the same day, I bought both. ARTOFFICIALAGE has collected a lot of dust. PLECTRUMELECTRUM has been played so many times, if it was an LP, it’d be damn near worn through. That album, the one with 3rdeyedGirl, blew my doors off. Epic.\n\nIn a way though, it was the title track that spoke to me the most. A beautiful groove. Simple sections. Funky. I wanted to try it on, so I sat there and took a couple days to figure it out. Then I had to break it in and get comfortable.\n\nThat’s what’s wonderful about art — and why sharing is important — because it’s a way to enable another person to feel, visualize, have the hair on the back of the neck stand up in harmony with a piece. Inspiration is a vein that all artists should feel allowed to tap into. That’s different than straight copping like a chump, no doubt, but, well…he did like dress up Covers…\n\nI did a Cover of PLECTRUMELECTRUM on an Acoustic and called it PLECTRUMACOUSTICRUM and, as of this writing, it’s still there. I made it out of love for the song. I recorded it because I wanted to hear and see my playing as a critic. I uploaded it because I felt like if Prince wanted to really be an asshole about it I could use the takedown as an opportunity to challenge him to a duel, even though nothing would probably ever come of it."
