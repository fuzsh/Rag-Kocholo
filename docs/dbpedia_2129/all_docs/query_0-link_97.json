        "text": "Today, legendary Canadian-American folk singer Joni Mitchell — born Roberta Joan Anderson— turns 80 years old. Born in Alberta, Canada, Mitchell is revered as one of the most influential singer-songwriters to come out of the 1960s.\n\nWith her strikingly deep lyrics and incorporations of pop and jazz, Mitchell went on to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, as well as having pop culture magazine Rolling Stone call her “one of the greatest songwriters ever.”\n\nLet’s show our love and appreciation of Joni Mitchell by creating a playlist that highlights her as an artist. Think about your favorite songs — either in their original forms, or covers and tributes recorded by the many artists she has inspired.\n\nFor today’s 9:30 Coffee Break, which Joni Mitchell songs, covers, and tributes do you want to hear?\n\nRespond with your song ideas in the comments below.\n\nHave an idea for a Coffee Break topic?
