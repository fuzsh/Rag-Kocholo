        "text": "This Independence Day may not find most Americans feeling as free as they might have on Fourth of Julys past. Yet, as the fight to maintain democracy heats up to an uncomfortable degree, we can still seek solace and strength from the songs that are written about America and use them to inspire change.\n\nThe 11 songs presented here span more than 50 years of social activism. They collectively illuminate how fighting for rights and equality have threaded American society, and how there's still plenty of room for growth. There's a lot to despair over right now, but the accompanying playlist is intended as a reminder not to lose hope during the long fight ahead.\n\nHowever you're commemorating the holiday, dive into these powerful songs from Prince and The Revolution, Rage Against the Machine, Dolly Parton and more.\n\nNina Simone — \"Mississippi Goddam\" (1964)\n\nRacial segregation and oppression in the civil rights movement battleground states — Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee — are Nina Simone's focus in \"Mississippi Goddam.\" \"Desegregation,\" she sings, as her band responds, \"Do it slow.\" \"Mass participation (do it slow)/ Reunification (do it slow)/ Do things gradually (do it slow)/ But bring more tragedy (do it slow)/ Why don't you see it/ Why don't you feel it?\"\n\n\"I didn't like 'protest music' because a lot of it was so simple and unimaginative it stripped the dignity away from the people it was trying to celebrate,\" she wrote in her 2003 book I Put a Spell On You. \"But the Alabama church bombing and the murder of Medgar Evers stopped that argument and with 'Mississippi Goddam,' I realized there was no turning back.\"\n\nGil Scott Heron — \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\" (1971)\n\nOriginally recorded as a poem for Gil Scott Heron's 1970 album Small Talk at 125th and Lenox, \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\" was set to music for his Pieces of a Man album that was released the following year. The idea of not being able to just sit home and watch real change take place still resonates in a digital activism era.\n\n\"The revolution will not be right back/ After a message about a white tornado,\" he says in the piece. \"White lightning, or white people/ You will not have to worry about a dove in your bedroom.\"\n\nPointer Sisters — \"Yes We Can Can\" (1973)\n\nOakland's hit-making Pointer Sisters recorded \"Yes We Can Can\" the same year as the case of Roe vs. Wade was decided in the Supreme Court. It's an apt time to return to the song's hopefulness as fuel in the fire to regain reproductive rights.\n\n\"We got to iron out our problems/ And iron out our quarrels,\" the Sisters sing. \"And try to live as brothers/ And try to find peace within/ Without stepping on one another/ And do respect the women of the world/ Remember you all have mothers.\"\n\nPrince and The Revolution — \"America\" (1985)\n\nThanks to a funked-up thread of the familiar refrain of \"America, America, God shed his grace on thee\" — from the 19th Century standard \"America the Beautiful\" — Prince's \"America\" can pass as a thoroughly patriotic song to people who don't dig deeply into the still-relevant critiques in his lyrics.\n\n\"Jimmy Nothing never went to school/ They made him pledge allegiance/ He said it wasn't cool/ Nothing made Jimmy proud/ Now Jimmy lives on a mushroom cloud.\"\n\nThe anxiety of nuclear war that weighed heavily on songs of this era can be understood in the context of the present, with Russian attacks on Ukrainian nuclear power plants that have taken place in just the last few months.\n\nRage Against The Machine — \"Take The Power Back\" (1992)\n\nThis early Rage Against The Machine song from 1992 stands well today as an activist anthem in the disinformation age of book-banning and school curriculum upheaval. \"Take The Power Back\" advocates for the truth to be told and for the power to return to the people.\n\n\"In the right light, study becomes insight,\" sings frontman Zack de la Rocha. \"But the system that dissed us/ Teaches us to read and write/ So called facts are fraud/ They want us to allege and pledge/ And bow down to their god.\"\n\nTune-Yards — \"My Country\" (2011)\n\nIt's been over a decade since Oakland musicians Merrill Garbus and Nate Brenner — together, known as Tune-Yards — released \"My Country.\" But the song's lyrics about America's vast inequalities, especially for those seeking a new home here, still apply just as much as they did in 2011.\n\n\"My country, 'tis of thee/ Sweet land of liberty/ How come I cannot see my future within your arms,\" Garbus sings angrily.\n\nChildish Gambino — \"This Is America\" (2018)\n\nDonald Glover's unflinching look at being Black in America hits hard — and is especially potent when absorbed with the accompanying music video, which won the GRAMMY for Best Music Video in 2019. The video brings the song to life in vivid detail, including burning cars, police terror and Gambino murdering a choir with a machine gun.\n\nThe song's lyrics about the anxiety of guns expresses a sentiment that unfortunately still holds true today, as the first half of 2022 has been particularly deadly with gun violence across the country. \"Yeah, this is America,\" he raps with increasing alarm on the song. \"Guns in my area/ I got the strap/ I gotta carry 'em.\"\n\n\"I just wanted to make, you know, a good song,\" Glover told E! in an interview on the red carpet at the Met Gala in 2018. \"Something people could play on Fourth of July.\"\n\nGlover took home three more GRAMMY Awards for \"This Is America\" in 2019: Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Rap/Sung Performance.\n\nDolly Parton — \"19th Amendment\" (2018)\n\nDolly Parton steps in with some crucial history about women's rights in \"19th Amendment,\" presented in her endearingly bubbly style. The song is a highlight of 27: The Most Perfect Album, a compilation of songs from various artists who wrote about one of the 27 Amendments to the Constitution. (On the album, it's titled \"19th Amendment,\" as each track's title is the Amendment it's about. Parton refers to the song as \"A Woman's Right.\") The project was released in 2018 by Radiolab at New York's WNYC Studios before the midterm elections.\n\n\"It is the duty of the women of this country to secure for themselves the sacred right to vote,\" she insists in the song.\n\n\"Being lucky enough to be a successful woman in business, I wanted to exercise my right to write about the 19th Amendment to praise and uplift women,\" Parton said in an interview with WNYC.\n\nGary Clark Jr. — \"This Land\" (2019)\n\nGary Clark Jr. is a six-time GRAMMY winner who is lauded around the world for his artistic prowess. But as an American — and, more specifically, as a Texan — he is still keenly aware of how racism still persists in this country. \"This Land,\" which is the title track to his 2019 album, was written after a neighbor confronted him in disbelief that a Black man could own the property where Clark lives, a 50-acre horse ranch in Kyle, Texas.\n\n\"N**** run, n****a run/ Go back where you come from,\" stings the chorus.\n\n\"I just wanted to let it be known: this land is your land, but it's mine too, and we all, as Americans, as citizens of this country, should all have an equal shot,\" he told The Guardian.\n\nMaino — \"I Can't Breathe\" (2020)\n\nThe death of George Floyd inspired a lot of powerful music in 2020. Before the late Eric Garner was killed at the hands of NYPD in 2014, he said, \"I can't breathe,\" which Floyd also said when he was killed by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. The phrase is now associated with the Black Lives Matter movement and international activism against police brutality.\n\nWhile several artists have released songs pertaining to police brutality, a few have specifically named songs \"I Can't Breathe\" — including H.E.R., whose single won the GRAMMY for Song Of The Year in 2021. \"Stripped of bloodlines, whipped and confined/This is the American pride,\" she says in a spoken word portion of the song.\n\nBrooklyn rapper Maino also released a song called \"I Can't Breathe\" in 2020, using the compelling track to call out the history of the continued police brutality against Black people. \"Think I'm tired of bein' silent,\" he rhymes over an interpolation of the music from Fugees' \"Ready or Not.\" \"Tired of people not tired to see us dyin.'\"\n\nLukas Nelson — \"Untitled\" (2022)\n\nOn June 27 — three days after the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade — Lukas Nelson performed an untitled song on his Instagram account that reacts to the controversial decision.\n\n\"Now the stars don't shine for her at night/ They're just holes in the sky,\" sings Nelson (who is Willie Nelson's son and the frontman of Lukas Nelson & Promise of the Real). \"They don't give no light/ And the darkness lingers/ Endlessly/ For she must carry the seed.\"\n\nRolling Stone noted that it joins notable songs about abortion that have recently been released, such as \"Disorders\" by Ani DeFranco and Stone Gossard, or re-recorded, like Cyndi Lauper's new version of 1993's \"Sally's Rights.\"\n\nThe soul of America has long been reflected in the music that's written about it. As history has shown, artists aren't afraid to speak their minds in song — and as the fight for a more equal, peaceful country continues, there are likely many more to follow.\n\nHow The Pandemic And Political Turmoil Inspired 2022 GRAMMY Nominees: Alicia Keys & Brandi Carlile, Foo Fighters & More\n\nWith massive crowds and countless critics raving about her debut album, Ravyn Lenae knew what she had to do: completely ignore all of the expectations that led to it.\n\n\"I knew in order for me to keep evolving as an artist and a person, there was no choice but to let those boundaries go,\"she says from her home in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter building up a growing following in Chicago alongside other members of the Zero Fatigue Collective (which includes producer Monte Booker and rapper Smino), Lenae relocated to the West Coast. She made a massive mark on 2022’s Hypnos, which featured a beguiling mix of alt R&B, house and soul alongside Renae’s magnetic vocal presence.\n\nAnd rather than coast, Lenae dug deeper for the followup, Bird’s Eye (due Aug. 9). Working with frequent Kendrick Lamar collaborator and in-demand producer DJ Dahi, Bird’s Eye flutters across genres and influences — pulling from Fleetwood Mac on one track, drawing in Childish Gambino on another, and adding Jimmy Jam’s bass elsewhere. Indicative of these multifarious influences are two pre-release singles: the retro pop-leaning \"Love Me Not\" and the soulfully skipping \"Love Is Blind.\"\n\nLenae uses that shapeshifting methodology as a way to interrogate the concepts of love and relationships — never content to rest on her laurels, learning how best to grow and adapt. \"Making the songs and getting to the bottom of what they meant for me was me kind of retracing my steps a little bit and really acknowledging all these moments in my life, in my childhood, that were pivotal for me and my identity,\" she says.\n\nNearing the release of Bird’s Eye, Lenae spoke with GRAMMY.com about directing the video for \"Love Me Not\" in Chicago, blending Brazilian music with Prince inflections, and how the album helped her reconnect with her father.\n\nA lot seems to have happened in the two years since 'Hypnos.' On a month-to-month, day-to-day basis, how much do you shift creatively?\n\nIt feels like night and day to me, even though it's been a really short amount of time. During this time between Hypnos and this album — the recording and creating process — a lot unlocked with me. [There was] a lot of personal growth that happened that allows me to approach music in a much freer and kind of impulsive way.\n\nWith the last album and that process, I think I did place a lot of parameters around what I had to be, what I had to sound like, what it had to feel like, who I had to connect with. And I kind of just released all of those expectations with this and made music that I wanted to hear.\n\nHow easy was it to actually release those boundaries and work more more in the moment?\n\nI knew in order for me to keep evolving as an artist and a person, there was no choice but to let those boundaries go, if I wanted to keep pursuing music in a way that felt honest. And then being able to collaborate with people such as Dahi, who has kind of mastered that in a lot of ways, and learning from him and seeing his process, seeing how easy and natural it is to just fall into what feels right…\n\nI think the longer you're in an industry or you're in something, the more rules you place on [creativity] and the more you overthink it and try to mold it in a way that doesn't feel impactful. As an artist, being around him and him encouraging that type of process, I think that was a lot of it, too.\n\nDahi's worked with some incredible artists, and clearly in a way that accentuates that artist rather than making it about DJ Dahi. That must have been so perfectly aligned with your openness, to go in and let yourself learn what you wanted to do. They always say if you know too much and plan everything out, you’ll end up stifled creatively.\n\nIt's so true. And that's why I describe it as me kind of returning back to that 12-year-old me, that 13-year-old me, before I cared about opinions, what people thought about me and what I was doing, what I was wearing I think we start off that way, and then the older we get, the more we get so self-conscious and we judge ourselves more harshly than everyone else.\n\nWhy do we do that?!\n\n[Laughs.] I think it's just human nature. And then we try to unlearn all of it.\n\nEven just in daily life, it's so hard to not think about what I could have done at any given moment. And when you’re creating music, there are 5 million ways you can create the same idea and you have to just land on that one.\n\nA hundred percent. During this process, we would have a song idea and then three different versions of that song that hit completely different feelings — maybe a more soft rock version of it, maybe a more indie version of it, maybe a more soulful version. Then it was about having to settle into what is \"the one\" and what feels the best, versus like what's going to chart or what's going to get in the club. Having to release all of that and just really lean into what feels good is what works every time.\n\nThat relates even to how the album was announced, with two tracks that almost speak in conversation with one another. Those songs balance such clever hooks with more nuanced conversation about how conflicted and complex love and relationships can be. How did you find that balance between emotional realism and such immediate music?\n\nIt was just really feeling empowered and confident in my decision making. And that's something that's developed over time, too. Really listening to my voice and what I want out of music in my career and my rollout, you know?\n\nListening to that, obviously having people around me who are like-minded in that way like my management and my team. We all kind of empowered each other to lean into those feelings. At no point in this process did anything feel forced or like I was reaching for something.\n\nThat’s so interesting. You want your team to feel supportive but you also want to feel empowered to take risks away from that support. And that reminds me of “Love Me Not,” which has some really smart risks. It's that vintage pop feeling, right down to the clap-along beats, and the vocals feel right in your ear. So when you started working on that track, for example, did you always imagine it being that nostalgia, that warmth?\n\nI thought that there was just something so cool and timeless, a classic feeling about it. And my songs are the ones where you can really pinpoint what the influences are, or when this was made, or the person behind it. Having a song like that, that really reminded me of Outkast. Like, What is this?\n\nEven before it dropped, I remember having some anxiety around maybe my fans not liking it because it feels a little different from Hypnos. I think anytime you kind of jump outside of the bubble you've kind of created, it's scary because there are people living in that bubble with you who like the temperature in there.\n\nIt’s so important to be constantly revitalized in your work. If you’re doing the same thing, even if your fans are demanding it, you’re not going to get that. And hopefully when your fans see all that you can do, they’ll follow it.\n\nYeah. And there's so much left in me to explore into and put out into the world. And look at an artist's career, someone like Tyler, the Creator: Seeing where his sound started and how he's almost trained his fans’ ears to be receptive to something new every time. They've completely grown up with him in a lot of ways and expanded their palate. Kind of forcing the hand of listeners is something that's really interesting to me. [Laughs.]\n\nI love that idea of pushing yourself and pushing your fans, but still within the realm of what's good. [Laughs] Not just experimenting for the sake of it. Speaking of growing and experimenting, I wanted to ask about the “Love Me Not” music video that you directed. It feels so well shot but still so intimate and casual.\n\nI knew with the album and how I wanted the imagery to feel, it would be very homey. Making the songs and getting to the bottom of what they meant for me was me kind of retracing my steps a little bit and really acknowledging all these moments in my life, in my childhood, that were pivotal for me and my identity, those first moments where I felt like I was getting closer to myself in a way.\n\nA lot of that started on the South side of Chicago, at my grandmother's house, in the basement. Even the cover of the album symbolizes that transition for me. That's where I dyed my hair red for the first time in the basement, in the sink, so coming back to the sink and dyeing my hair ginger on the cover was something that felt so powerful and defining for me. It just made perfect sense that we were going to go back to Chicago for the first video, in my grandmother's house, with all my family members involved. Those are my grandparents, my mom, my sisters, so that's why it feels so loose and candid. I really wanted to give people a glimpse into my life and what it felt like walking into my childhood home.\n\nGetting to see a place through someone else’s eyes is so extraordinary. It really makes the little details pop. For example, the plantains cooking on the stove at the beginning.\n\nYeah. I associate plantains with my grandparents, my family. We’re of Panamanian West Indian descent, so those smells and those sounds, I really wanted to incorporate into the video.\n\nThat really speaks to bringing some comfort along with the risk-taking, same as having your family around. The features do a great job of bolstering you, setting up that stability, particularly Ty Dolla $ign on \"Dreamgirl.\"\n\nI think we just had the idea to kind of take the song into a different world in a way. When we first started the first section of the song, I just knew there was magic there. Those Prince drums and that Brazilian guitar — why do those make sense together? It shouldn't ever make sense together. But when I heard it? Oh my god, this feels like something fresh and new, but also like I've felt this feeling before.\n\nDahi's brain is just incredible, and then even bringing in Jimmy Jam on it to do bass was a dream come true. I knew it kind of felt like it existed in that Janet stratosphere, and I thought it would be such a cool touch for him to do that personally. Dream come true on all spectrums. I love Ty Dolla $ign, obviously grew up listening to him. He's incredible and I was so honored that he wanted to do it.\n\nBesides Janet, were there any particular artists who were kind of central inspirations for this album specifically?\n\nSonically, Janet is always in the mix. With this one in particular, some Gwen Stefani, No Doubt, a little bit of Fleetwood Mac in there. I just love taking these worlds that are very different from each other and kind of mashing them and seeing what happens. It's like my favorite thing ever.\n\nYou’re trained in classical music, and it's so clear that you understand the range of emotion that you can convey. I'm just curious what happened when you went into recording — or even before that, in the writing. What was it like digging into yourself to find the narrative that matched the mashing?\n\nHonestly, I don't think there was much premeditation with the writing and what I wanted to touch on in a way. Really leaning into those impulsive initial first feelings that a song gives me is something I really valued with this album. And moving forward, that'll be my process.\n\nWhat was premeditated with the writing process with this album was, with every song, trying to really peel back those layers in my brain and those barriers lyrically. Like, What would I naturally say? Think of that and then think, Okay, how can I make this even more literal, even more personal? Even in working with my girl [songwriter] Sarah Aarons, I learned a lot from her as far as songwriting and how to really paint a picture that feels clear and concise and emotional. Not trying to find the prettiest words or the most interesting words, but really writing what feels real. And that's something that I've really, really valued and learned with this process.\n\nEven with “One Wish” with Childish Gambino, the whole album feels like this big conversation on relationships. Being more direct feels like some advice someone would get with a relationship itself, let alone writing about it. Did that process help you actually process what was happening in your life too?\n\nOh man, 100 percent. And that's why music is so beautiful to me. It's really a means of opening dialogue between me and myself, and then me and the people in my life. With a song that's so important to me like “One Wish,\" it’s not just because it's a great song, but because this has really catapulted me into this different part of my life and repairing relationships, opening up difficult conversations — like with my father in particular. Hearing such a simple song and the response I've gotten from it has only validated me much more in the fact that these real stories, real emotions are what connects.\n\nHave you played the album for your father?\n\nWe started repairing or rekindling our relationship maybe two years ago. The making of Bird’s Eye was at its peak and I felt like it was important for me to have a song on the album that addressed my relationship with him in order for me to release it and start to move on in a positive way.\n\nSo sharing the song with him, inviting him to be in the music video was huge for us. And then even after debriefing about maybe some feelings that came up when he heard certain lyrics or when he saw certain scenes in the video, it just opened up this really honest, candid dialogue between us and I couldn't be more grateful that I have this outlet.\n\nMore R&B News\n\nThis summer continues to dazzle us with an electrifying array of music, with new releases arriving from Jimin (MUSE), Ivan Cornejo (MIRADA), Koe Wetzel (9 Lives), Denzel Curry (King Of The Mischievous South Vol. 2), and Adam Lambert (Afters), and many more this week. From eagerly awaited comebacks to iconic collaborations, July 19 has an abundance of new music to offer across all genres.\n\nAs you continue shaping up your summer playlists, be sure to check out the following 11 new songs and projects.\n\nJT — 'City Cinderella'\n\nFollowing the release of \"The City Cinderella Documentary,\" which chronicles JT's inspiring journey from overcoming challenging circumstances to embarking on a solo career, the rapper unveils her highly-anticipated 16-track mixtape, City Cinderella. The project is a showcase of talent and growth, featuring powerhouse collaborations with DJ Khaled and Jeezy, the latter of whom features on a remix of her hit \"OKAY.\"\n\nCity Cinderella is JT's first project since parting ways with her former City Girls cohort, Yung Miami. Speaking to Paper Magazine about her new venture, JT explained that the inspiration for the project was simple: \"I just wanted to authentically be myself and make music.\"\n\nRauw Alejandro — \"DEJAME ENTRAR\"\n\nPuerto Rican star Rauw Alejandro has been a song machine since his Sony Latin/Demars Entertainment debut with 2019's Trap Cake, Vol. 1. He'll be releasing his fifth album in five years later this year — and judging by his latest release, it may be his sexiest yet.\n\n\"DEJAME ENTRAR\" sees Alejandro getting close to a woman who once was just a crush, but has now turned into his latest love affair. The singer debuted the sultry, pulsing track with a smooth performance on \"Today\" on July 12; one week later, the song's official release also included the official video, which co-stars actor Adrian Brody.\n\nThough Alejandro hasn't revealed a release date for his next project, he teased on \"Today\" that it will hopefully be done \"soon.\" \"These songs [are] too good to be inside the studio,\" he said.\n\nChildish Gambino — 'Bando Stone & the New World'\n\nJust two months after re-releasing his 2020 project, 3.15.20, under the new title Atavista, Donald Glover is back with another Childish Gambino album, Bando Stone & the New World. The LP features stylistic musical choices that parallel Gambino's past albums, including 2011's Camp, 2013's Because the Internet, and 2016's \"Awaken, My Love!,\" as well as features from Amaarae and Jorja Smith, Flo Milli, Fousheé, and Yeat.\n\nAs Glover revealed in April, Bando Stone & the New World will be his last album under the Childish Gambino moniker. But he's going out with a bang: along with a massive world tour, Bando Stone & the New World is accompanied by a sci-fi film titled Bando.\n\nAccording to a recent interview the New York Times, it seems Glover feels a sense of completion with the project, too. \"Success to me is, honestly, being able to put out a wide-scale album that I would listen to,\" he said. \"For this album, I really wanted to be able to play big rooms and have big, anthemic songs that fill those rooms, so that people feel a sense of togetherness.\"\n\n'Twisters: The Album'\n\nNearly 30 years after the 1996 release of Twister, the blockbuster finally gets a sequel with the highly anticipated Twisters — and an equally exciting accompanying soundtrack. The sprawling Twisters: The Album features some of the biggest names in country music today, with tracks from Luke Combs, Lainey Wilson, Jelly Roll, and many more.\n\nCombs was the first to tease a taste of the soundtrack with his gritty, uptempo tune \"Ain't No Love In Oklahoma,\" which was released alongside a music video that featured clips from the movie. Scenes from the film can also be seen in the clip for Jelly Roll's \"Dead End Road,\" which arrived the day before the album's release.\n\nBut there's so much more to discover across the soundtracks 29 songs, from Megan Moroney's \"Never Left Me\" to Charley Crocket's \"(Ghost) Riders In The Sky.\" And though the track list is stacked with country stars, there's a few gems to enjoy by hitmakers from other genres, too, including Benson Boone (\"Death Wish Love\") and Leon Bridges (\"Chrome Cowgirl\").\n\nAlessia Cara — \"Dead Man\"\n\nIt's been two years since we last heard from Alessia Cara, but she's ready to begin her next chapter. The GRAMMY winner unveils \"Dead Man,\" the lead single from her forthcoming fourth album — and if the kiss-off track is any indication, Cara's in her fearless era.\n\nBacked by crisp drums and harmonious saxophones, \"Dead Man\" is an edgy ode to someone she's cutting off because he's no longer serving her. \"If you really care, then why am I feeling you just slipping through my hands?,\" she questions in the chorus. \"If you're really there, then why can I walk right through ya?/ Talkin' to a dead man.\"\n\nJames Bay feat. Noah Kahan & The Lumineers — \"Up All Night\"\n\nIn the folk-pop collaboration that dreams are made of, James Bay teams up with longtime friend Noah Kahan and genre giants The Lumineers for \"Up All Night.\" The track boasts a vibrant instrumental layered beneath the harmonious blend of each artists' vocals — a perfect soundtrack for warm, starry summer nights.\n\nThe week \"Up All Night\" arrives also marks a full-circle tour moment for Kahan and Bay. Five years after Kahan first opened for Bay on the \"Let It Go\" singer's Electric Light Tour in 2019, Bay is now opening for Kahan — at New York City's Madison Square Garden and Boston's Fenway Park, no less — on the We'll All Be Here Forever Tour.\n\nSueco — 'Attempted Lover'\n\nAfter four years and two projects with Atlantic Records, Sueco unveils his first independently released studio album, Attempted Lover. Across 12 tracks, the L.A. native delves into the complexities of love and relationships, while navigating the tangled emotions that accompany these themes.\n\nSueco set the stage back in March with the project's lead single, \"Drama Queen\" — a raw, high-energy track that drew in both new and loyal listeners. He soon followed up with \"Mulholland Drive,\" a stripped-down acoustic gem, showcasing the impressive range of musical styles that Attempted Lover has to offer.\n\nIn celebration of the release, Sueco will embark on the Attempted Lover Tour in Sept. 13, kicking things off in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and hitting 32 cities in North America until Nov. 2.\n\nKALEO — \"USA Today\"\n\nDuring a short break from their Payback Tour, KALEO is back with new music — and making a statement and an impact with their latest release.\n\nThe rock band deliver the emotionally charged \"USA Today,\" a reflection on gun violence in America. Though frontman JJ Julius Son first wrote the track in 2019 with Shawn Everett and Eddie Spear, he felt compelled to release the track after an innocent bystander was killed during the attempted assassination of Donald Trump on July 13.\n\n\"So here we are/ Fighting for america/ Fighting for a new day/ Trying hard to change/ USA today,\" Son sings over gritty guitar riffs and dark synths. KALEO invites listeners to join the movement, pledging to donate a portion of the proceeds from the song to the gun violence advocacy group Everytown.\n\n\"USA Today\" is the second track KALEO released from their forthcoming fourth album, which is due later this year; it follows the acoustic lead single, \"Lonely Cowboy.\"\n\nAvery Anna — 'Breakup Over Breakfast'\n\nAfter being named an Artist to Watch by Amazon Music, Pandora, Spotify, and CMT in 2023, country newcomer Avery Anna further displays her promise and prowess with her debut album, Breakup Over Breakfast. The Arizona native co-wrote all 17 tracks on the project, including standout track \"girl next door,\" a powerful ballad that puts Anna's golden vocals on display.\n\n\"These songs mean the world to me. It's a little bit of rock, country, acoustic, pop, and everything personal,\" the singer/songwriter wrote in an Instagram post. \"I really wanted to give you guys an album that you can confide in. I carefully chose the songs and track listing, and creating it was an adrenaline rush / a relief all at the same time.\"\n\nRole Model — 'Kansas Anymore'\n\nWith his 2022 debut album, Rx, Role Model dove deeply into themes of love. Two years later, the rising bedroom pop star offers a different take on that same topic, grieving the very relationship that inspired Rx with Kansas Anymore.\n\nAlong with offering a different take on love and relationships, Role Model's latest effort is also inspired by his longing for his native state of Maine. Drawing inspiration from artists like Zach Bryan, the War on Drugs and Caamp, Kansas Anymore chronicles Role Model journeys back home, attempting to fill the void created by leaving his East Coast roots for California. The project represents a mature step forward, navigating the rollercoaster of heartbreak and homesickness — and moving listeners in the process.\n\nJoe Jonas — \"Work It Out\"\n\nSince releasing his first solo album, Fastlife, in 2011, Joe Jonas has been plenty busy, from landing a megahit with his pop-rock group DNCE to bringing back the Jonas Brothers with his siblings Nick and Kevin. Thirteen years later, the singer makes a solo comeback with \"Work It Out,\" the bouncy lead single from his sophomore solo album, Music for People Who Believe in Love, due Oct. 18.\n\n\"This album is a celebration of gratitude, hope, and love. These songs reflect on my life from a bird's-eye-view acknowledging the many blessings around me,\" Jonas shared on Instagram, referencing both his own experiences as an individual and as a recent father of two. \"I hope it brings you as much joy as it brought me creating it.\"\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\n\"I strive for originality in my music,\" Prince declared in a 1985 interview with MTV. \"That was, and will always be the case.\"\n\nIt was this determination to do things his own inimitable way that birthed the decade's most audacious superstar project: Purple Rain.\n\nPrior to the album's June 25, 1984 release, Prince had scored some mainstream hits — including \"1999\" and \"Little Red Corvette\" — but hadn't fully blossomed into the prolific, world-conquering musical hero he's now immortalized as. Nor did he have acting experience. Yet, Prince somehow managed to convince his management and label into financing a big-screen hybrid of romance, drama and musical accompanied by an equally ambitious pop soundtrack.\n\nIt was an inherently risky career strategy that could have derailed the Purple One's remarkable rise to greatness in one fell swoop. Instead, Purple Rain enjoyed blockbuster success at both the box office and on the charts, with the film grossing more than $68 million worldwide and the album topping the Billboard 200 for a remarkable 24 weeks.\n\nInitially conceived as a double album featuring protege girl group Apollonia 6 and funk rock associates the Time, the Purple Rain OST worked as an entirely separate entity, too. In fact, it had already sold 2.5 million copies in the States before the movie hit theaters, largely thanks to the immediacy of lead single \"When Doves Cry,\" Prince's first ever Billboard Hot 100 No. 1.\n\nAnd a full 40 years on from its release, Purple Rain's diverse range of power ballads, hard rockers and party anthems still possess the power to stun, whether the phrase \"You have to purify yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka\" is familiar or not. Here's a look at why the GRAMMY-winning record — and 2010 GRAMMY Hall of Fame inductee — is regarded as such a trailblazer.\n\nIt Hopped Genres Like No Album Before\n\nWhile the streaming age has encouraged artists and listeners to embrace multiple genres, back in the 1980s, \"stay in your lane\" was the common mindset. Of course, a musician as versatile and innovative as Prince was never going to adhere to such a restriction.\n\nThe Purple One had already melded pop, soul, R&B, and dance to perfection on predecessor 1999. But on his magnum opus, the star took his sonic adventurism even further, flirting with neo-psychedelia, heavy metal and gospel on nine tracks which completely eschewed any form of predictability. Even its most mainstream number refused to play by the rules: despite its inherent funkiness, \"When Doves Cry\" is a rare chart-topper without any bass!\n\nAs you'd expect from such a virtuoso, Prince mastered every musical diversion taken. And the album's 25 million sales worldwide proved that audiences were more than happy to go along for the ride.\n\nIt Championed Female Talent On And Behind The Stage\n\nAlthough the likes of Jill Jones, Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman had contributed to previous Prince albums, Purple Rain was the first time the Purple One pushed his female musical proteges to the forefront. On \"Take Me With U,\" he shares lead vocals with one of his most famous, Apollonia. On its accompanying tour, he invited Sheila E. to be his opening act. And in something of a rarity even still today, two of the soundtrack's engineers, Susan Rogers and Peggy McCreary, were women.\n\nMelvoin and Coleman would go on to become artists in their own right as Wendy and Lisa, of course. And Prince would also help to radically transform Sheena Easton from a demure balladeer into a pop vixen; compose hits by the Bangles (\"Manic Monday\"), Martika (\"Love Thy Will Be Done\"), and Sinead O'Connor (\"Nothing Compares 2 U\"); and provide career launchpads for Bria Valente and 3RDEYEGIRL.\n\nIt Broke Numerous Records\n\nAs well as pushing all kinds of boundaries, Purple Rain also broke all kinds of records, including one at the music industry's most prestigious night of the year. At the 1985 GRAMMY Awards, Prince became the first Black artist ever to win Best Rock Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal, beating the likes of the Cars, Genesis, Van Halen, and Yes in the process. Purple Rain also picked up Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media at the same ceremony, and was nominated in the night's most coveted Category, Album Of The Year.\n\nAnother impressive feat was the one that had only previously been achieved by the Beatles and Elvis Presley. With the same-named movie also hitting the top of the box office chart, Prince became only the third artist in history to score a No. 1 album, film and song in the same calendar year.\n\nIt Changed How Albums Were Sold\n\nAlthough it seems positively chaste compared to the likes of \"WAP,\" \"Anaconda,\" and \"My Neck, My Back (Lick It),\" Purple Rain's tale of a \"sex fiend\" who enjoys pleasuring herself in hotel lobbies was deemed so provocative at the time of release that it inadvertently instigated a political taskforce.\n\nAppalled by the sexual lyrical content of \"Darling Nikki,\" a track she caught her 11-year-old daughter Karenna listening to, future Second Lady Tipper Gore decided to set up the Parents Music Resource Centre with three other \"Washington Wives.\" The organization subsequently persuaded the record industry and retailers to issue any album containing child-unfriendly material with Parental Advisory stickers. (Another Prince-penned hit, Sheena Easton's \"Sugar Walls,\" was also included alongside \"Darling Nikki\" in the \"Filthy 15\" list of songs the PMRC deemed to be the most offensive examples.)\n\nIt Paved The Way For The Pop Star Film\n\nPrince was the first pop superstar from the 1980s holy trinity to bridge the gap between Hollywood and MTV, with Purple Rain arriving eight months before Madonna's star turn in Desperately Seeking Susan and four years before Michael Jackson's fantastical anthology Moonwalker. And it spawned a whole host of similar vanity projects, too.\n\nYou can trace the roots of everything from Mariah Carey's Glitter to Eminem's 8 Mile back to the tale of a troubled musical prodigy — nicknamed The Kid — who finds solace from his abusive home life at Minneapolis' hottest night spot. And while the acting and screenplay were never going to trouble the Academy Awards (as lead actress Apollonia predicted, however, it did pick up Best Score), Purple Rain's spellbinding onstage performances captures the euphoria of live music better than any other concert film, fictional or real.\n\nIt Helped Redefine Masculinity in Pop\n\n\"I'm not a woman, I'm not a man/ I am something that you'll never understand,\" Prince sings on Purple Rain's biggest dance floor number \"I Would Die 4 U\" — one of many occasions in both the album and film that challenged notions of masculinity, gender and sexuality even stronger than the Purple One had before.\n\nIndeed, although the early '80s was unarguably a boom period for white British pop stars outside the heteronormative norm, it was rarer to find artists of color so willing to embrace such fluidity. Prince, however, had no problem — whether sporting his now-iconic dandy-ish, ruffled white shirt and flamboyant purple jacket combo, or unleashing his impressive array of diva-like shrieks and screams on \"Computer Blue\" and \"The Beautiful Ones.\" André 3000, Lil Nas X and Frank Ocean are just a few of the contemporary names who have since felt comfortable enough to express themselves in similarly transgressive fashion.\n\nIt Added To The Great American Songbook\n\nFrom the apocalyptic rockabilly of \"Let's Go Crazy\" (\"We're all excited/ But we don't know why/ Maybe it's 'cause/ We're all gonna die\") and messianic new wave of \"I Would Die 4 U,\" to the experimental rock of \"Computer Blue\" and self-fulfilling prophecy of \"Baby, I'm A Star,\" Purple Rain delights at every musical turn. But it's the title track that continues to resonate the most.\n\nFollowing Prince's untimely death in 2016, it was \"Purple Rain\" — not \"1999,\" not \"Kiss,\" not \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\" — that many fans gravitated toward first. Initially conceived as a country duet with Stevie Nicks, the epic power ballad was described by Prince as pertaining \"to the end of the world and being with the one you love and letting your faith/ God guide you through the purple rain.\"\n\nThe superstar acts every inch the preacher on the emotional tour-de-force. And as the final song that Prince ever performed live — on the Atlanta leg of his Piano & A Microphone tour, a week before his untimely passing — closed the curtains on a truly revolutionary career.\n\nGRAMMY Rewind: Lizzo Thanks Prince For His Influence After \"About Damn Time\" Wins Record Of The Year In 2023"
