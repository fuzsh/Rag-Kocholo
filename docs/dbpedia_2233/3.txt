COPASI - Creating and solving mathematical models of biological processes

COPASI is an open-source software application for creating and solving mathematical models of biological processes such as metabolic networks, cell-signaling pathways, regulatory networks, infectious diseases, and many others. COPASI includes features to define models of biological processes, simulate and analyze these models, generate analysis reports, and import/export models in SBML format.
