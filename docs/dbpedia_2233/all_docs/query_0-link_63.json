Interpreting these phenomena requires the use of quantitative methods and computation. We work on many aspects of Computational Systems Biology:\n\nDevelopment of modeling and simulation software (like COPASI)\n\nMethodology for parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis\n\nReverse-engineering biological networks (top-down modelling)\n\nStandards for systems biology\n\nMultiscale modeling and simulation\n\nMethodology for nonlinear dynamics analyses\n\nWe are also involved in modeling specific biological phenomena:\n\nThe network of iron absorption, metabolism and signaling in mammals\n\nMixed species Candida albicans-bacterial biofilm formation\n\nWhere we work\n\nWe work at the Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling, part of the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. Our academic affiliation is with the Department of Cell Biology."
