        "text": "As the scope and complexity of bioinformatic research widens, the need for a practical simulator for biochemical systems has grown considerably. The influx of experimental data begs the need for analytical tools; however, current implementations exhibit limitations with user-interactivity. We present CASS (Computational Adaptable Stochastic Simulator), an analytical modeling tool with a focus on a clean user-interface and malleable terms. Through adaptations of the Gillespie algorithm, our program accepts a broad range of user-specific input and simulates network interactions across time according to chemical propensity functions. CASS offers users a layout of parameter and plotting preferences in order to maximize compatibility for experimental models. This versatile tool shows promise for applications across the board in small-scale research.\n\nMathematical modelling has become a standard technique to improve our understanding of complex biological systems. As models become larger and more complex, simulations and analyses require increasing amounts of computational power. Clusters of computers in a high-throughput computing environment can help to provide the resources required for computationally expensive model analysis. However, exploiting such a system can be difficult for users without the necessary expertise. We present Condor-COPASI, a server-based software tool that integrates COPASI, a biological pathway simulation tool, with Condor, a high-throughput computing environment. Condor-COPASI provides a web-based interface, which makes it extremely easy for a user to run a number of model simulation and analysis tasks in parallel. Tasks are transparently split into smaller parts, and submitted for execution on a Condor pool. Result output is presented to the user in a number of formats, including tables and interactive graphical displays. Condor-COPASI can effectively use a Condor high-throughput computing environment to provide significant gains in performance for a number of model simulation and analysis tasks. Condor-COPASI is free, open source software, released under the Artistic License 2.0, and is suitable for use by any institution with access to a Condor pool. Source code is freely available for download at http://code.google.com/p/condor-copasi/, along with full instructions on deployment and usage.\n\nIntrinsic fluctuations due to the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions can have large effects on the response of biochemical networks. This is particularly true for pathways that involve transcriptional regulation, where generally there are two copies of each gene and the number of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules can be small. Therefore, there is a need for computational tools for developing and investigating stochastic models of biochemical networks. We have developed the software package Biochemical Network Stochastic Simulator (BioNetS) for efficiently and accurately simulating stochastic models of biochemical networks. BioNetS has a graphical user interface that allows models to be entered in a straightforward manner, and allows the user to specify the type of random variable (discrete or continuous) for each chemical species in the network. The discrete variables are simulated using an efficient implementation of the Gillespie algorithm. For the continuous random variables...\n\nThe Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is an XML-based format for representing mathematical models of biochemical reaction networks, and it is likely to become a main standard in the systems biology community. As published mathematical models in cell biology are growing in number and size, modular modelling approaches will gain additional importance. The main issue to be addressed in computer-assisted model combination is the specification and handling of model semantics. The software SBMLmerge assists the user in combining models of biological subsystems to larger biochemical networks. First, the program helps the user in annotating all model elements with unique identifiers pointing to databases such as KEGG or Gene Ontology. Second, during merging, SBMLmerge detects and resolves various syntactic and semantic problems. Typical problems are conflicting variable names, elements which appear in more than one input model, and mathematical problems arising from the combination of ..."
