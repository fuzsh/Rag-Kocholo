        "text": "BioModels “Model of the year” competition 2023\n\nBioModels has launched a new competition for early career researchers, to recognize emerging leaders in systems biology modelling, identify exciting modelling research and promote reproducibility and good modelling practice.\n\nAm I eligible?\n\nThe competition is aimed at early career researchers, including but not limited to PhD students, postdocs, staff scientists, and research assistants, who have published a peer-reviewed scientific manuscript with a mathematical model within the last two years (since 1 Jan 2021).\n\nPIs, group leaders, lecturers, and professors are not eligible.\n\nHow do I enter the competition?\n\n1) Submit your model to a public (FAIR) model repository\n\nSubmit model codes to open standard repositories such as BioModels, Physiome, and CellCollective and make them publicly available.\n\nYou can submit your model code in any format (e.g. Matlab, Python, C++, R, Julia Scripts, COPASI, etc). However, submitting the models encoded in community standards including COMBINE standards (e.g. SBML, CellML, OMEX) would be advantageous.\n\n2) Submit your application using the online form\n\nA short summary/abstract of your model, highlighting its scientific outcome, novelty and impact (max.500 words)\n\nCitation and link to the published manuscript (Open access) or a PDF\n\nThe deadline for submissions is 20 January 2023.\n\nWhat can I win?\n\nWinners will share £1000 award money.\n\nThey will also receive certificates of excellence.\n\nWinners will be invited to write a short blog (2-page max) about their models to be published and promoted on the BioModels platform.\n\nThe jury will aim to publish a piece entitled “Model of the year 2023” in a leading systems biology journal highlighting the winners’ work.\n\nHow will the winners be decided?\n\nThe jury panel will evaluate the abstracts and select between 4 and 10 BioModels of the year. Criteria:\n\nScientific merit. Our expert jury panel will evaluate the abstracts on scientific merit.\n\nModel reproducibility. Our curators will evaluate the model’s reproducibility. Only reproducible models are eligible.\n\nCommunity standard. Encoding models in community standards when possible is advantageous.\n\nThe competition was officially launched at ICSB2022 (https://www.icsb2022.berlin/) in Berlin, Germany.\n\nFurther details including an FAQ, eligibility and evaluation criteria, timeline and partners are available here.\n\nWinners of Model of the year 2023\n\nDr Jan Rombouts Lendert Gelens’ Lab, University of Leuven, Belgium\n\n\"Modular approach to modeling the cell cycle, simple cell cycle model”\n\nMODEL2212060001 MODEL2212060002\n\nDr Eva-Maria Geissen Henrik M. Hammarén’s group, EMBL, Germany\n\n“Protein synthesis and post-translational modification”\n\nMODEL2212160002\n\nDr Lorenz Adlung, Marcel Schilling’s Lab, DKFZ, Germany\n\n\"Cell-to-cell variability in JAK2/STAT5 pathway”\n\nMODEL2103080001\n\nSelection Panel\n\nProf. Amber smith, University of Tennessee\n\nDr Virginie Uhlmann, EMBL-EBI\n\nProf. Silvia Santos, The Francis Crick Institute\n\nDr Hiroki Asari, EMBL\n\nDr Wolfgang Huber, EMBL\n\nDr Thomas Quail, EMBL\n\nCo-ordinator: Dr. Rahuman Sheriff (sheriff@ebi.ac.uk)"
