        "text": "Features\n\nCOPASI carries out simulation and analysis of biochemical network models.\n\nModels\n\nModels in COPASI are based on reactions that convert a set of species into another set of species. Each species is located in a compartment, which is a physical location with a size (volume, area, etc). This maps directly to biochemical reaction networks, but can also represent other types of processes (for example, the species could be cell types). COPASI automatically converts the reaction network to a set of differential equations or to a system of stochastic reaction events — the user does not have to write down the math explicitly, the software does that. Models can also have:\n\nUnlimited number of species, reactions, and compartments.\n\nArbitrary discrete events; these can be used to change the model, or just to monitor the progress of simulations.\n\nArbitrary differential equations; these have to be added explicitly by the user and can be mapped to species, compartments, or generic variables.\n\nCompartments can have variable sizes (ie they can be variables of the model).\n\nThe rates of reaction can be picked from a set of predefined kinetic functions (the most common in biochemistry), or arbitrary functions defined by the user.\n\nModels can be visualized through\n\nthe GUI interface, with tables for reactions, species, compartments, etc.;\n\nan arbitrary number of network diagrams (including an SBGN-compliant option);\n\nthe full set of differential equations; these can be exported in Latex or MathML formats.\n\nCOPASI can import and export models in the SBML format (levels 1 to 3). Models can also be exported in XPP format, Berkeley Madonna format, and as C code (code for the differential equations).\n\nSimulation\n\nSimulation can be performed either with stochastic kinetics or with differential equations, and the software easily allows switching between them. The software provides an interface to create parameter scans (sweeps), parameter sampling and repeated simulations — including complex simulation scenarios mixing parameter samples with scans and repeats of simulations (or other analyses).\n\nAlgorithms available for simulation:\n\nLSODA for ordinary differential equation modeling.\n\nRADAU5 for ordinary differential equation modeling (for very stiff systems).\n\nStochastic Runge-Kutta (RI5) for stochastic differential equations.\n\nGillespie's direct method for exact stochastic kinetics.\n\nGibson & Bruck's version of Gillespie's algorithm for exact stochastic kinetics.\n\nτ-leap algorithm for faster (approximate) stochastic kinetics.\n\nAdaptive SSA/τ-leap algorithm for faster (approximate) stochastic kinetics.\n\nHybrid Runge-Kutta/SSA for simulations with mixed stochastic kinetics and differential equations.\n\nHybrid LSODA/SSA for simulations with mixed stochastic kinetics and differential equations.\n\nHibrid Runge-Kutta/SSA with arbitrary partition of reactions between stochastic kinetics or differential equations.\n\nSimulations can be of time courses or steady states.\n\nAnalysis\n\nModels can be analyzed and modified with a large set of methods:\n\nStoichiometric analysis of the reaction network, including mass conservation analysis and elementary flux modes.\n\nOptimization of arbitrary components of the model using a range of diverse algorithms.\n\nParameter estimation using a range of diverse optimization algorithms. This can be done over several different experiments simultaneously, including mixtures of steady-state and time course experiments.\n\nLocal sensitivity analysis.\n\nMetabolic control analysis (a special form of sensitivity analysis).\n\nTime scale separation analysis; this allows definition of fast and slow components of the model, in a time-dependent way.\n\nAnalysis of stochasticity using the linear noise approximation (allows estimating variances and co-variances even in the presence of large numbers of particles).\n\nCross sections, which allow to characterize non-linear dynamics properties, such as oscillations and chaos.\n\nLyapunov exponents, which allows to establish if the system dynamics are chaotic.\n\nData visualization\n\nCOPASI allows users to visualize data in various ways:\n\nNetwork diagrams can be used to visualize time course simulations as movies;\n\nnetwork diagrams can also be used to visualize mass conservation moieties, and elementary flux modes;\n\narbitrary 2D plots of any model variables and parameters (including trajectories in phase space);\n\na series of plots that are most commonly used are already pre-defined;\n\nColor-coded matrices, for easily identifying large and small values;\n\n3D bar chart representation of matrices\n\nData output\n\nCOPASI allows users to define report files where data is written to during simulations and analyses. These report files are useful for importing data onto other applications for further analysis and visualization."
