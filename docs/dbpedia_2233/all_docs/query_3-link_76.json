        "text": "As the scope and complexity of bioinformatic research widens, the need for a practical simulator for biochemical systems has grown considerably. The influx of experimental data begs the need for analytical tools; however, current implementations exhibit limitations with user-interactivity. We present CASS (Computational Adaptable Stochastic Simulator), an analytical modeling tool with a focus on a clean user-interface and malleable terms. Through adaptations of the Gillespie algorithm, our program accepts a broad range of user-specific input and simulates network interactions across time according to chemical propensity functions. CASS offers users a layout of parameter and plotting preferences in order to maximize compatibility for experimental models. This versatile tool shows promise for applications across the board in small-scale research.\n\nIntrinsic fluctuations due to the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions can have large effects on the response of biochemical networks. This is particularly true for pathways that involve transcriptional regulation, where generally there are two copies of each gene and the number of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules can be small. Therefore, there is a need for computational tools for developing and investigating stochastic models of biochemical networks. We have developed the software package Biochemical Network Stochastic Simulator (BioNetS) for efficiently and accurately simulating stochastic models of biochemical networks. BioNetS has a graphical user interface that allows models to be entered in a straightforward manner, and allows the user to specify the type of random variable (discrete or continuous) for each chemical species in the network. The discrete variables are simulated using an efficient implementation of the Gillespie algorithm. For the continuous random variables..."
