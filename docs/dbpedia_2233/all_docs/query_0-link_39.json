        "text": "CytoCopasi is a Cytoscape app that enables modeling, importing, simulating, and comparing biochemical reaction networks. It uses the Java bindings of Complex Pathway Simulator (COPASI) for quantitative systems biology modeling.\n\nBesides the regular ODE-based tasks, such as time course simulation and steady state analysis, users can also superimpose and compare two chemical reaction networks (e.g., a healthy vs diseased state) to display the concentration deviations at steady state. Users can also manually perturb a model by modifying one or more parameters of their choice (e.g., the activity of an enzyme or the initial concentration of a drug molecule) and visualize the downstream effects on the steady state profile.\n\n● Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) support\n\n● Import local SBML files\n\n● Direct connection to KEGG for importing pathways and converting them into SBML\n\n● Extract KEGG modules as subnetworks\n\n● Supports BRENDA’s SOAP access for enzyme functional data queries\n\n● Comparative reaction network visual analytics\n\n● Perturbation analysis capable of visualizing downstream effects due to mutations or drug treatment\n\n● Windows, Linux, Unix, or MacOS operating system\n\n● Cytoscape 3.8. or above https://cytoscape.org/\n\n● Java OpenJDK 11.0.14 or above\n\nThe CytoCopasi JAR file contains native library files CopasiJava.dll, libCopasiJava.jnilib, and libCopasiJava.so for Windows, MacOS, and Linux/Unix, respectively.\n\nThe recent version of CytoCopasi can load these libraries automatically during start up; however, should Cytoscape throw an \"Unsatisfied Link Error\", you can alternatively try to manually copy the appropriate native library to a directory in your java.library.path and restart Cytoscape.\n\nJava.library.path usually contains multiple directories, but the user can copy the native library to any of them.\n\nFor all OS types: Open Terminal and type\n\nFind the java.library.path section in the output; it should look like below:\n\n● Download the executable from the Releases section https://github.com/scientificomputing/CytoCopasi\n\n● Download the additional files as .zip and extract them into a new folder, which will be named CytoCopasi-main\n\n● After downloading and extracting, go to CytoCopasi-main/Native Libraries/\n\n● The correct type of Mac OS X native library depends on your Mac processor. If you are not sure, this article explains how to find out.\n\nFor intel (x64): open the folder Mac OS X (Intel)\n\nFor M1/M2 chips: open the folder Mac OS X M1M2\n\n● Open terminal and type:\n\nex: sudo cp libCopasiJava.jnilib /Library/Java/Extensions\n\n● Enter your user password when prompted.\n\n● Go to CytoCopasi-main/Native Libraries/Windows\n\n● Run terminal (Windows PowerShell) as administrator (this option will appear when you right-click on the terminal icon.\n\n● Go to CytoCopasi-main/Native Libraries/Linux\n\n● Open terminal and type\n\nSince CytoCopasi is not yet available on App Store, you need to install it in one of the following two methods.\n\nClick on “Install from file” on the App Manager Dialog, and find the CytoCopasi-1.0.jar file in the repository you downloaded.\n\nCopy CytoCopasi-1.0.jar file to [...]/CytoscapeConfiguration/3/apps/installed\n\nOnce the installation is complete, you will see the CytoCopasi tab on the left panel space"
