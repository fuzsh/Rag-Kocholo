COPASI

COPASI is a free and open source software for modelling, simulation and analysis of biochemical networks. It is one of the most used simulators for SBML models.

A collaborative project ongoing since 2000, together with many people at Virgina Tech and University of Heidelberg.

ManyCell

This is a multiscale simulator for populations of cells where each cell is described by a full ODE model. It uses COPASI for the molecular level and an agent based simulator for the cell level.

Gepasi

A popular biochemical pathway simulator. Gepasi is no longer maintained, you should instead use COPASI.

MEG transforms one Gepasi model into another that corresponds to many replicates of the first, useful to construct multicellular models.

SMETS algorithm

This is an algorithm to measure the distance between two multivariate time series with different dimensions (PLoS One paper here). Matlab code that implements this algorithm is available here.
