the 1920s, his father left the Corriere della Sera and moved to the United States, where he directed

the Italian-American newspaper Corriere d'America from 1923 to 1931.[1]

After completing his studies in Italy and at Columbia

University, Barzini Jr. worked for two New

Y

ork World.[1] In 1928, together with Richard Washburn Child,

former

Ambassador

to

[edit] Panay Incident

As the Corriere della Sera Asian correspondent, he went to China. On December 11, 1937, he was

aboard the USS Panay on the Y

angtze Patrol in Nanking at the prompting of George Atcheson, a

U.S. Embassy official. Also aboard were Universal News cameraman Norman Alley, Movietone

News’

Eric

Mayell,

the

ork Times's

So

ong,

Collier's

Weekly

correspondent Jim

Marshall,

and

La

Stampa

correspondent

Sandro

Sandri.

Atcheson

had

invited

them

aboard

the

Panay so that they could document the fall of the city from relative safety. The four journalists had

been covering the ongoing Japanese invasion of China in the mid-1930s, and found themselves in

the thick of things in early December 1937 as Japanese forces moved on Nanking.[3]

According to Alley, writing in his memoir I Witness, Atcheson proclaimed that aboard the gunboat

the group would be "as safe as you would be on good old American soil." Little did any of them

know that in just a week’s time, Panay would be attacked, sunk, Sandri killed, and that they would

witness the Rape of Nanking.
