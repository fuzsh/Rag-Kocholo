Diminutive in contrast with those Fascist bosses who shared her fate, she swung dead beside her lover and Duce, Benito Mussolini, while a vengeful crowd bayed its hatred and derision. Her naturally curly dark hair was now tangled; for one classically aware observer, its dishevelled state reminded him of the Medusa, even though, he added, her pretty face remained unblemished.2 The expensive black kid shoes (size 33), which she had worn the previous day on her small and delicate feet, were lost. But, as would be revealed by a later exhumation, there lay meticulously sewn into the shoulder pads of her camisole ‘an antique diamond ring, a gold locket studded with 17 small diamonds spelling out the letters C and B. Inside was preserved a tiny note with the motto “Clara, I am you and you are me. Ben 24 April 1932–24 April 1941” and a miniature gold box containing a rosary acquired at the sanctuary of Santa Rita at Cascia in Umbria’.3 Such detail may endlessly fascinate Italians, but the rest of the world has scarcely shown more than a passing interest in Petacci’s fate. To be sure, some mutterings were immediately voiced about the ‘barbarity’ of the scene at Piazzale Loreto, with pious assertion that the innocent lover had not 1\n\nCLARETTA\n\ndeserved the cruel dictator’s fate. On 3 May 1945 Lord Birkenhead wrote to the London Daily Telegraph in execration of ‘the horrendous Saturnalia’ of Piazzale Loreto, where Claretta had been hung ‘like a hen, beaten, bound and put on sale’; her fate had amounted to ‘the most savage and cruel exhibition of the century’.4 The American poet, Ezra Pound, during the war an unapologetic propagandist of Fascism, and in 1945 locked up in a US military prison before being incarcerated for a decade at a lunatic asylum in Washington, mourned the sacrificial deaths of ‘Ben and la Clara’ in his Pisan cantos.5 In the 1960s the world-wandering, New Zealand-born ‘Count’ Geoffrey Wladislaw Vaile Potocki de Montalk (he claimed Polish aristocratic descent), effusively hymned a ‘dear heroine’, who had bravely sacrificed herself for love.6 Sardonically driven by the expectation that Fascist sex could swell audience numbers, in 1975 the BBC sponsored a play archly entitled Private affairs: Caesar and Claretta. In its presentation, the young Helen Mirren enhanced her career playing Claretta as she followed her road to Piazzale Loreto. According to a review in The Times, Mirren was notably convincing when, portraying the events of 27 April 1945, ‘layer after silk layer slithered to the floor as she prepared for bed’ or when, the next morning, ‘she left for what she believed to be liberation she was so excited she had no time to fetch her knickers from the bed and gave a hideous little giggle of hope as she went out of the farmhouse’.7 Shortly afterwards, the Scottish dramatist Robert David MacDonald brought Claretta and Hitler’s partner, Eva Braun, together in a work entitled Summit conference. Dedicated to Rolf Hochhuth and saluting The representative, with its bitter critique of Pope Pius XII’s attitude to the Holocaust, as ‘the most important European play since the war’, Summit conference explored the Holocaust with greater attention than it did Italian Fascism. ‘Clara’8 was represented as the female version of a timeless Italian Machiavel: ‘I am the Duce’s whore, and that is what they call me,’ she was portrayed as saying. ‘I am a scandal but at least I am a public scandal. Every month, I give 200,000 lire to the poor, and they look at my clothes and smell my scent and they spit – and take the money.’9 The play was revived at the Lyric in London in 1982, on this occasion with another distinguished actor, Glenda Jackson, playing Claretta, but met with poor reviews. An acerbic critic wrote that ‘it suggests something Giraudoux might have 2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nwritten on a bad day’.10 Still less successful was a racehorse called Petacci – it may be wondered how the callers pronounced the filly’s name – which ran unplaced a few times in 1977–8 and was then sent to stud.11 Such were mere flickerings of posthumous international interest. No doubt, then and later, further fleeting attention was aroused when a film or a book or a scandal was reported from Italy. In 1974–5 Carlo Lizzani’s romanticised Mussolini: ultimo atto (‘The last days of Mussolini’) targeted a global market through the deployment of international stars, with Rod Steiger as the Duce12 and Henry Fonda as Cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster, archbishop of Milan. However, the role of Claretta fell to the less well-known Lisa Gastoni and not, as was originally rumoured, to Liz Taylor (with Richard Burton and not Steiger to play Mussolini).13 Ten years later, the Neapolitan director Pasquale Squitieri directly (and sympathetically) portrayed Petacci’s life in a film called Claretta, with a semidocumentary beginning. He employed his partner, Claudia Cardinale, in the title role, her performance winning a silver medal at the Venice Biennale of 1985.14 Squitieri, a cinematographer with many contacts on the Italian political right, readily persuaded Claretta’s surviving younger sibling, Myriam,15 to be interviewed. But no international stars joined them and the film caused few ripples outside Italy. Popular historical accounts in languages other than Italian remain sparse, with the most recent, Roberto Olla’s translated Il Duce and his women (2011), dwindling to the end of its narrative around 1936 and therefore, despite some description of Claretta, scarcely focusing on her.16 In his avowedly revisionist biography of Mussolini, the journalist Nicholas Farrell, who took residence in the Duce’s home town of Predappio and regularly writes for the Spectator in critique of the Italian left, preferred brevity to detail. ‘Italian women,’ he maintained, ‘. . . queued up – literally – to make love’ to Mussolini. Claretta, Farrell added, possessed the requisite qualities of ‘big breasts’ and ‘powerful hips’ and, in his opinion, little more needed to be known about her.17 As such remarks demonstrate, Claretta’s story has frequently aroused foreign stereotypes about Latin lovers, with the assumption that every Italian male, and certainly any in power, aimed to live in a perpetual ‘bunga bunga’ party. Typical was the leaked report published in the Guardian that, 3\n\nCLARETTA\n\nwhen preparing for a state dinner with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, the British premier David Cameron joked that the main agenda in Rome was ‘jacuzzis and whores’.18 Cameron’s apparent assumptions were little different from those of American ambassador Joseph Kennedy (himself no model of uxorious care) three generations earlier, when, in March 1939, he counselled that the quickest way to keep Italy onside in the deteriorating international situation would be to despatch ‘six American chorus girls’ to Rome to divert Mussolini and Galeazzo Ciano, his son-in-law, minister of foreign affairs and alleged competitor as a sexual athlete.19 But, if the world has largely forgotten Claretta, Italy remembers. Scarcely a week passes without some further reference to her on the web or in the news. In 2015, for example, fans learned that a 1939 Alfa Romeo Sport Berlina, the very car that Claretta and her brother Marcello had driven to their deaths in April 1945, had been auctioned in Paris for $2.1 million.20 A few months later, a (clunky) 1936 Bianchi bicycle, allegedly a February 1943 present from ‘Ben’ to his lover, was put on eBay by a Foligno-based seller for a cheaper but still pricey € 250,000.21 More melodramatic was a set of reports in 2011–12 that Petacci’s ghost had appeared four times on the lakeside at Salò, ‘capital’ of the Repubblica Sociale Italiana (RSI; Italian Social Republic), the puny regime of a puppet dictator between 1943 and 1945. Dressed in a flowing 1930s-style gown, ‘tall and beautiful’, the apparition, perhaps seeking sweetness still, had become visible just outside the elegant Vassalli gelateria looking out over Lago di Garda. In April 2012, at a delicate moment in national political history, with the Berlusconi era coming to an end, the spectre spoke up to condemn rightist infighting and leftist temptations. Two Sicilians and two Lombards, it was reported, heard the ghost whisper to perpetually bickering Italians: ‘Ben said, do stop it now!’ Massimo Merendi, chief of the Associazione National Ghost Uncover [sic], was engaged to examine the case further, it was promised, but the truth of Petacci’s presence could not be doubted.22 Memory flourishes at other sites along Lago di Garda, where at Salò in June 2015 a museum and ‘study centre’ for the RSI opened, amid controversy, for visits and seminars.23 There and elsewhere in the neighbourhood, maps advise how to find ‘twenty places important in the RSI’. The most 4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nbeauteous is the Villa Fiordaliso, where Petacci, her parents, Japanese diplomatic staff and an SS guard lived in 1943–4 in what must have been a crowded house. The villa was initially built for its German owner, Otto Vèzi, in 1907 in full ‘Liberty’ (Art Nouveau) style, thereby forming a small part of those developments that led Italian nationalists to bewail the fate of the Gardasee, as they bitterly rechristened the area around the lake. After German defeat in the war, in 1928 it was bought and enlarged by the wealthy Lombard Botturi-Polenghi family. In recent decades it has been lovingly restored by its owner, Max Tosetti, as has the adjacent Renaissance Torre San Marco. Each is set on the lakeside just below the Vittoriale degli Italiani, the extensive palace where the poet Gabriele D’Annunzio indulged himself and his syncretic tastes through his declining years.24 Today the Villa Fiordaliso is a centre for lavish weddings and dinners, while overnight guests are offered the opportunity ‘to sleep in Claretta’s bed’, still furnished as it was in 1944.25 (A sceptic might note tartly, however, that she and the Duce rarely passed a night there; whatever quick coitus they managed between 1943 and 1945 usually occurred in the Torre San Marco.) Nonetheless, among those said to have enjoyed the contemporary lavish facilities at the villa and/or to have been emotionally moved by their historical resonance are Laurence Olivier, Monica Vitti, Claudia Cardinale and ‘Stormin’ Norman’ Schwarzkopf. Silvio Berlusconi has also relaxed ‘in this room of sighs’, a popular historian has confided with a nudge and a wink. ‘And of just one thing we can be sure. He was not alone.’26 A hardcover copy of the romantic popular biography, Roberto Gervaso’s Claretta: la donna che morì per Mussolini (‘Claretta: the woman who died for Mussolini’), is made available by the management of the hotel for contemplation and written commentary.27 Sadly, the more celebrated guests seem to have forgone this opportunity, although visitors who have reflected on their meeting with Claretta’s spirit have arrived from as far afield as Australia, New Zealand, Kazakhstan and Venezuela. They have kept their opinions for the most part apolitical and sentimental (with possible national differences): ‘Our unforgetable [sic] day. The Italians really know how to live’ (a couple from Dallas, September 2002); or the more ecstatic French couple ‘E et G, une nuit torride, inoubliable, et pleine 5\n\nCLARETTA\n\nde sentiments, faits partagées à deux. Peut-être avons-nous ravivé l’idylle magnifique entre Claretta et Il Duce’ (July 2004). Another French pair were briefer one month later, recording: ‘Calme, douceur et volupté.’ Other sentiments were prosaic: ‘We did sleep in a very historical room but I was here with my wife lovely Margie and not with a lover like Claretta’ (a couple, perhaps German, perhaps not, from Munich, September 2007). More directly connected with the Mussolini–Petacci story were two Italians who recalled lyrically: ‘I am yours . . . You are mine . . . for ever if God wants it . . . so Ben and Claretta wrote . . . so you and I write.’ Thirty kilometres north along the lake, the Villa Feltrinelli has been converted into a larger and still more up-market hotel whose staff acknowledge that Mussolini’s bedroom is always the first to be booked. There, the Duce and quite a few of his extended family lived in 1943–5. But the presence of his wife, Rachele, ensured that Claretta never stretched languorously on this bed. Quite a bit further north at Obermais/Maia Alta above Merano in the German-speaking sector of the Trentino-Alto Adige, locals still readily identify a ‘castle’ as the ‘Villa Petacci’ (actually called the Villa Schildhof and erected in 1911), and are sure there was regular sexual congress there. They are deluded. The villa was acquired in April 1943 from two Hungarian noblemen by Claretta’s brother Marcello, and acted as a redoubt for the whole family at a difficult moment later that year and in 1944–5 (then minus Claretta).28 The Petacci family’s most vaunted dwelling place, however, was the stridently modernist Villa Camilluccia, a massive – 700-square-metre, 32-room, 2-storey – residence in the northern suburbs of Rome beneath Monte Mario. At first appearance it might suggest a full conversion of the Petaccis to the taste and philosophy of Fascism. However, much about it belied its apparent commitment to revolution, rather confirming the family’s determination to climb socially by any means. Occupying a large block of land at Via della Camilluccia 355–7, it was equipped with a swimming pool, tennis court (according to gossip, the court was never prepared for play and the pool’s drainage system did not work),29 terraces replete with gymnastic equipment, orchard, flower garden, chicken run and two separate guard posts, while boasting a huge salone with crystal doors (the servants’ quarters doubled as an air raid shelter). Claretta’s own bedroom, 6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nequipped with large mirrors, exuded female sentiment of a cloying kind, displaying a fondness for silk fabric conforming to her taste in plunging negligees, and a devotion to the colour pink in its furnishings and even its telephone. After the fall of the dictatorship the Villa Camilluccia experienced an uneven fate. It was sacked by an aggrieved populace in July 1943 and then handed over to the Istituto del Santissimo Crocifisso, a Catholic charitable organisation – founded under Fascism – committed to children’s welfare.30 Following the establishment of the Italian postwar republic, those members of the Petacci family who had escaped Claretta’s and Marcello’s fate in 1945 sued for the Villa’s return with tardy success: in 1960 the Italian state paid out an ordered 22.5 million lire (of a requested 104 million) in compensation.31 But Myriam and the Petacci parents lacked sufficient will or capital to restore it, with the Villa lingering for a time as the ‘Palazzi restaurant’ before being bulldozed in 1975. The site, somewhat incongruously, now houses the Iraqi embassy. However, its story still attracts naive celebration by cultural historians lauding ‘a courageous example of modern architecture, spare and essential, with an intense and complex use of space’ and hailing it as an effective marriage of Le Corbusier and Palladio.32 Less remarked upon but worth a tourist visit in Rome is the Petacci family tomb in the Campo Verano, the city’s cemetery, spreading behind the Basilica of San Lorenzo towards the Tiburtina railway yards, and subject to vicious Allied bombing on 19 July 1943, an attack which triggered the Duce’s first fall. Claretta’s corpse was interred there one spring day on 16 March 1956. Her remains had travelled a complex course from the Piazzale Loreto, even if, unlike those of her partner Mussolini, they had not suffered the bathetic fate of being purloined by nostalgic admirers.33 The final burial in Rome had been allowed by the Italian state after Ugo De Pilato, the lawyer of Claretta’s still living parents, Dr Francesco Saverio Petacci and Giuseppina Persichetti, petitioned the government in January 1954 for charity. ‘Two elderly parents, severely struck by fate,’ De Pilato wrote in lachrymose vein, could thereby find some closure, a mandatory concession when ‘the memory of this unhappy creature inspires throughout Italy and outside the country merely sentiments of sorrowing sympathy and reverence’ and neither criticism nor disdain.34 7\n\nCLARETTA\n\nIn the present day, few of the tourists who throng Rome find their way to the mausoleum. Yet to bask in this small corner of the city’s history does have its attractions for a visitor. The web offers two pathways to the Petacci tomb. In the romantic evocation of the Rome daily Il Messaggero – which under the regime employed her doctor-father as a medical commentator – Claretta is recalled as ‘Mussolini’s woman’, it being stressed that she ‘died tragically’. Nonetheless, it is quickly admitted that the tomb of the comic film star Alberto Sordi has more appeal, with many other actors resting nearby awaiting veneration.35 A local news-sheet counsels a rival track. Its ‘third itinerary’ directs pilgrims past the Jewish sector of the cemetery and on to the nearby tomb of the comic dramatist, Eduardo De Filippo. Up a rise to the right rest the remains of his brother, Peppino, buried in a pyramid-shaped edifice. Opposite stands the tomb of the Petaccis and just a little further on, we are told, that of Attilio Ferraris, a celebrated footballer in the Fascist years, who in 1934 was a member of the first Italy squad to win the World Cup.36 It is plain, therefore, that a host of ideas and memories whisper across the contemporary Campo Verano.37 But the Petacci tomb deserves inspection. It is built, as was expected in the 1950s, of pre-stressed concrete, now blackening and crumbling with age and carbonation, and is reached via a short stairway. From this elevated site, the tomb rises some 30 feet farther into the skies, being surmounted by a slightly curved roof. A long glass shield, broken into rectangles, protects the inhumations. At the bottom, Francesco Saverio and his wife lie united in death, as they were in life. On the side, Claretta’s younger sister, the sometime starlet Myriam, rests alone. But these family members are as subordinate to Claretta here as they were in history. It is she who commands the tomb. Above the first layer of interments and pushed back a little lies a solid black marble coffin. It is labelled CLARETTA 28-II-1912 – 28-IV-45. Strikingly set above it is a white marble statue, larger than life-size, of the dead woman. She is wrapped in what might be a sheet or toga (and not her favoured negligee, often worn late into the afternoon).38 Her shoulders, upper arms, hands and feet are bare, with her upper leg revealed beneath a diaphanous layer. Her right knee is slightly raised, suggesting motion, although her legs are placed primly together. She has her chin up, with her 8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nbreasts thrust forward (perhaps to the pleasure of Mussolini’s passing ghost). Her hair is a little unkempt. Her smile is contained. But the most expressive feature of the statue is the large hands, which are turned outwards, presenting her arms and shoulders, bashfully offering herself and her soul to a chosen partner. In death, Claretta remains young and austerely beautiful. The lines of her body may be exposed but not in a sensual manner; her sculptor has left her decorously promising eternal love, not lust.39 It may be, nonetheless, that the tomb’s history is passing. On 28 October 2015, ninety-third anniversary of the Fascist takeover in Rome, the tomb was reported to be in serious decay and of potential danger to onlookers; no surviving member of the Petacci family had then offered to repair it.40 In August 2016 it was officially declared to be in ‘a state of abandon’ and therefore a possible object of removal, with the authorities complaining that all attempts to contact the family heirs in the USA had failed. But, shortly after, another report indicated that Ferdinando Petacci had been actively trying to preserve the family tomb and blamed the cemetery authorities for their failure to assist him.41 After all, Campo Verano is not the only site of Claretta’s physical commemoration. Inevitably the centres near Lake Como, where lover and dictator were executed, have also from time to time sought to record suffering and death (and to attract visitors). In 2010 the Berlusconian mayor of Giulino di Mezzegra caused some consternation by urging in an online article the erection of a statue of Claretta on the left side of the Villa Belmonte, at the gates of which it was generally agreed Mussolini and his partner met their end.42 Controversy lingers to this day, with rival fascists and neofascists contesting the wording that should accompany a small surviving memorial there, and continuing to debate whether Claretta’s death can in any way be justified.43 Fifty years earlier, similar controversy arose after the family erected an 80cm by 40cm cross on a white marble base in memory of their dead daughter, ‘innocent victim of a horrible crime’ – government toleration being granted with the cautious request that the memorial not intrude onto public land or constitute a traffic hazard.44 Soon, however, other phantasms gave more troubling meaning to the site with neofascists adding a plaque to Mussolini and the Fascist cause, an appendage that prompted police intervention and the transfer of the commemorative material to the town cemetery.45 9\n\nCLARETTA\n\nSites of memory carry power. But Claretta’s story also retains its spark in written version. Indeed, in a neoliberal age which glories in the individual and celebrity, Claretta and her fate loom ever larger in popular histories of Mussolini and his Italian dictatorship. Their implications deserve analysis. An extensive literature, much of it foreign, has been regularly alarmed since 1945 whenever fascist political groupings have surfaced in Italy.46 The country did, after all, unlike Germany, allow the existence of an avowedly neofascist party, the Movimento Sociale Italiano (MSI; Italian Social Movement), the title invoking the radical-sounding ideology of the RSI or, more subtly, the message that ‘Mussolini [è] sempre immortale’ (‘Mussolini lives for ever’).47 Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the MSI became an acceptable partner of Berlusconian government, before, like its communist enemy, abandoning its past identity (and name) during the change from First to Second Republic and swearing itself now ‘post-fascist’. Yet the MSI was not the only home of admirers of the interwar dictatorship. With or without the approval of the MSI’s leadership, more extreme fascist grouplets have existed and still exist, with Casa [Ezra] Pound being the most active current example.48 The allure of neofascism, however defined, retains a fascination to some, although the main ideological inheritance is transferred less by the ghost of Mussolini, despite regular pictorial representation of a dominating Duce,49 and more by that of Hitler or, for example, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the poetic and mystical leader of the Romanian Legion of the Archangel Michael. In any case, when surveying the anti-democratic right in Italy, it is important to underline that, across the postwar generations, it was not so much Mussolini’s mind as his body (and, often enough, if with some hesitations, its mingling with Claretta’s) that entranced some Italians. Hardly was the dictator dead and his regime destroyed than the Mussolini family re-emerged at the centre of memory reconstruction. Each of Mussolini’s legitimate offspring, except for Anna Maria, a sufferer since childhood of polio, published accounts of their childhoods. The eldest son, Vittorio, provided a model of buoyant description in 1957 through the celebrated firm of Mondadori in Milan.50 That same year, Mussolini’s younger sister Edvige also sketched a sanguine recollection of her brother, a memoir published in Florence by La Fenice (‘The Phoenix’, meant to be 10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\na telling name), a business that was assembling what became forty-four volumes of Mussolini’s Opera omnia (they omit all but the skimpiest and most formal reference to Claretta).51 Edda, Mussolini’s eldest child, had been estranged from her father by his failure to prevent the execution of her husband, Galeazzo Ciano, in January 1944, and, as early as 1952, a short work recounting that ‘tragedy’ or ‘betrayal’ appeared under the authorship of an adaptable ex-Fascist intellectual, Emilio Settimelli.52 Other, more forgiving autobiographical works followed, even after Edda’s death in 1995.53 Prize for the best title should, however, go to a study by Fabrizio, Edda’s eldest child, born in Shanghai in 1931. It is entitled Quando il nonno fece fucilare papà (‘When Grandpa had Daddy shot’).54 By then, it was the Duce’s youngest son, Romano, born in 1927 and a globally applauded jazz pianist, who was assuming the lead in representing the family,55 perhaps in part stimulated by the political career of his daughter, Alessandra, in and beyond the MSI.56 After an initial career in modelling and risqué film, Alessandra Mussolini kept the family name in the headlines through campaigning that has combined her grandfather’s political and sexual appeal.57 Romano died in 2006 but his name survives in the Centro Studi Romano Mussolini and the attached Museo Mussolini, which today can be visited at the Villa Carpena, the Romagna estate purchased under the dictatorship.58 In 2013–14, Mussolini’s birthplace in the paese of Predappio, near Forlì, housed an extensive exhibition on the young Duce’s life, illustrated by a lavish guide edited by Franco Moschi, a more distant member of the clan.59 Rumours continue of the establishment of another museum in the surviving and aesthetically attractive Casa del Fascio (the former Fascist Party headquarters) at Predappio. Others of the extensive new generation of the family have engaged in well-publicised historical reflection60 and legal process,61 while one entrepreneurial relative was reported to have moved from offering private lessons in seduction to launch a ‘Seduction School’ at Cervia on the Romagnol Adriatic.62 Back in the first decades after 1945, each family member had produced his or her book with the assistance of an eager journalist and, in its pages, there were few attempts to do more than portray a happy surface of family life. Pride of place in this insertion of the Mussolinis into memory and nostalgia went to Mussolini’s widow, Rachele, who had led the way for the 11\n\nCLARETTA\n\nentire family with a memoir published by Mondadori in 1948; its two accompanying postwar photographs illustrated Rachele either virtuously knitting or hand-making fettuccine.63 Serialised first in sixteen issues by the illustrated magazine, Oggi, and then much translated, Rachele’s words reached a remarkable claimed total circulation of more than 104 million readers.64 Her account made only passing reference to Claretta, until a brief admission of Rachele’s public confrontation with her in October 1944. The younger woman’s conjunction with the Duce in death was blamed on unknown forces, who ‘at the last minute wanted to put her near Benito in order to heighten the scandal involved’.65 Until her death in October 1979, sudden enough to forestall a planned audience with Pope John Paul II,66 Rachele stayed in the news, whether through autobiographical writings or interviews (journalists were needed for both).67 The image that resulted was of an ever-loyal wife and mother, expert at cooking pasta and the other dishes of her region, a generous but demanding and by no means stupid head of her family’s domestic hearth.68 Certainly regime propaganda and perhaps reality had long represented Rachele this way.69 But, under the postwar republic, her embodiment of a ‘timeless’ sposa e madre esemplare (‘ideal wife and mother’) was confirmed. The real heartland of what has been brilliantly defined as a popular ‘nostalgia . . . without knowing well, in truth, for what precisely’70 was located less in books than in the photographic weeklies and monthlies, which, almost immediately after 1945, became the preferred reading of middle Italy. Oggi, the most successful of these ventures, soon had a circulation of well over a million copies, and its nearest competitor, Gente, 300,000.71 By 1974 Oggi’s run had grown to more than 4 million.72 The preferred subject matter of such weeklies was ‘an infinite quantity’ of written or photographic memory. When Mussolini appeared in its pages, he tended to be ‘in intimate, familial dress’, the Duce, it was averred, having instituted a ‘special sort of dictatorship’.73 Readers might also agree that he headed a special sort of family, although the term was not used, where, as a ‘typical Italian male’, he could range unhindered from Rachele’s bed. (Actually, the two slept in separate wings of the Villa Torlonia, their estate in Rome, given all but rent-free to the family from 1929.) Even while they expatiated on Mussolini’s human (and humane) normality, the weeklies 12\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ndid not forget the ‘tragic love story’ of ‘Ben and Clara’.74 As a piece in Oggi in 1952 underlined, in her death, Claretta had above all shown herself ‘a faithful and courageous woman’.75 Prompting the memory of this part of Mussolini’s life were the surviving members of the Petacci family. They were led by Claretta’s little sister Myriam, who may have had a faltering career in cinema but who knew something about publicity and was committed to resuscitating the honour of her family at least as fervently as were the Mussolinis theirs. In 1950 Myriam came back from sanctuary in Franco’s Spain to launch legal proceedings to claim her sister’s recently discovered diaries and other papers. Defeat followed initial victory in that case but, during 1955, Myriam won space in four successive issues of Oggi to tell her and her sister’s story.76 In time, not long before her death on 24 May 1991, she published a fuller memoir and self-defence with the assistance of the journalist Santi Corvaja.77 In the photo-magazines, Myriam was joined by Zita Ritossa (‘Zizi’), the partner of her brother, Marcello, and mother of his two sons, Benvenuto Edgar (born in 1939) and Ferdinando, two years his junior. Unlike Myriam, by then in Spain, Zita, her husband and children were, like Claretta, members of the final convoy that was blocked by partisans near Dongo on 27 April 1945, with fatal results for Marcello. Ritossa, who had given an extensive interview to a journalist, Luigi Saolini, as early as October 1945,78 bolstered no fewer than fourteen issues of Tempo, another of the illustrated magazines, in 1957 giving her account of this event, her own family life and the stony reception which she had received from the Petaccis when introduced to them as Marcello’s partner; the two did not marry. In 1975 Ritossa added a shorter account in Oggi, focusing on Claretta.79 In between, she tried to fob off Myriam and her parents in their attempts to sue her for ‘an unacceptable disclosure of matters pertaining to private life’; legal judgment on the case swung backwards and forwards in 1958, 1960 and 1961, before the Cassazione supreme court ruled in the Petaccis’ favour on 20 April 1963.80 The postwar history of the Petaccis has been studded with – usually newsworthy – litigation. It still is. Nonetheless, during the first decades after the war, the Petaccis did not prevail over the Mussolini family in their struggle to attract public approval 13\n\nCLARETTA\n\nof their past. Indeed, in 1956 an editorialist in Tempo declared that, for all the romance in Claretta’s life and death, she should be viewed as merely a ‘minor figure in the history that we are living’.81 Such a dismissive conclusion must have appealed to the Mussolinis: Rachele had continued to refuse to talk about her husband’s last affair or at best pronounced patronisingly that she was sorry for how Claretta had died and now took pious pains to remember her in her recitations of the Ave Maria.82 In highlighting this primacy of the legitimate family, the key document was ‘Mussolini’s last letter to his wife’, where he affirmed that ‘you know that you have been for me the only woman I have really loved. I swear it before God and our Bruno at this supreme moment.’ It was first published in Rachele’s initial memoirs and its authenticity was later approved in Mussolini’s Opera Omnia.83 However, no original survives. Some historians have therefore concluded that there was no such correspondence and the invention sprang from the unsparing struggle that Rachele was prosecuting posthumously against Claretta. Before her death Rachele is said to have admitted the forgery to a biographer, Anita Pensotti.84 Yet Pensotti had elsewhere commented on Rachele’s limited literacy compensated by her iron memory, even for exact phrases.85 In any case, as a more recent biographer of Rachele has urged, the epistolary sentiments were by no means contrary to Mussolini’s conflicted attitude to his wife and family on the one hand and to his young lover on the other, or a reverse of his marked tendency to appease the chivvying woman who was then nearest to him.86 It may be that no last tearful letter was scribbled by a repentant Duce; and yet its attitudes (and its hypocrisy) may well have expressed Mussolini’s mind late in April 1945. As the postwar decades passed, the popular pull of memory of dictatorship did to some extent lessen, even if Red Brigade terrorists thought that, by kidnapping and murdering the loquacious Christian Democrat party secretary Aldo Moro in 1978, they could thereby expose the fascism lurking beneath the mask of the Italian version of liberal democracy. Academic historians were by then using the massive if unevenly preserved archives of the dictatorship to examine it, with Renzo De Felice composing a biography of Mussolini that ran past 6,000 pages. De Felice disclosed the shadows and, more controversially, some lights in the regime and its dictator. But he remained a rigorously neo-Rankean political historian, 14\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\neschewing serious commentary on the Duce’s private life and personal emotions. Claretta he dismissed in a short ten pages as apolitical by most definitions;87 her major mention in his volumes was primly confined to a documentary appendix. There, De Felice recounted a jaundiced description by a secret agent, General Giacomo Carboni, of a visit to the Villa Camilluccia in July 1943, just before the dictator’s overthrow by his colleagues in the Fascist Grand Council and at which time, as shall be seen below, the lovers’ relationship was in some crisis. Carboni described Claretta as ‘an insignificant little person’, while her bedroom, into which he claimed to have peeked, reminded him, with its ceiling and wall mirrors (allegedly installed at the wish of Claretta’s mother), a double bed with a rare silk coverlet, adjoined by a black marble bathroom equipped with large central bath set on paving decorated with mosaics in the ‘Roman manner’, of the tasteless pseudo-grandeur of ‘the set of an American film’.88 De Felice was by no means the only historian of Fascism. A vivid democratic debate flourished, and still flourishes, inside and outside Italy about the nature of the dictatorship and its proclaimed totalitarianism (it was the pioneer of this term).89 Mostly, however, neither Claretta nor the complications of family life under the regime has stimulated much serious review,90 with Italian academic historians frequently professing an austere deprecation of biography and ‘scandal’. In regard to the national reckoning with history, the fall of the Soviet Union and the global triumph of neoliberalism shifted the scene in Italy, where the cultural division into a (largely latent) popular sympathy or nostalgia for Fascism countered by a high cultural commitment to antiFascism now withered away along with the nomenclature and apparent ideological base of the country’s political parties. With this drastic change, at least in appearance, sentimental readings of Mussolini and his regime and family revived, being expressed most vividly by Berlusconi, the preeminent politician of the new era (if scarcely an orthodox neoliberal). Mussolini, Berlusconi pronounced, ‘never killed anyone’, while the places where he confined his political enemies were, in reality, villeggiature, ‘holiday camps’.91 He compared his own travails in ruling to those of the Duce, in his mind another Italian leader prevented from doing good by the intractability of the national population.92 15\n\nCLARETTA\n\nSuch pronouncements from on high fitted into a revival of affection for the regime, with the damnation of Fascism as the partner of Hitlerian Nazism now obscured by an emphasis on the private, the personal and the emotional (and the sexual). In such circumstances, it is no surprise to find that Claretta’s ghost is not confined to sporadic appearance outside a gelateria. Instead she has become ever more significant as a symbol and ‘heroine’ of the regime and, many now accept, her ‘personal tragedy’ carries more important messages and lessons into the present than does the fall of the regime. It is true that Mussolinis of the younger generation still sometimes fill the news. But Rachele, the ‘peasant housewife’, now looks an old-fashioned figure from an Italy that has been lost, whereas Claretta can be portrayed as a feisty modern woman and even a proto-feminist. Striking in this regard is Roberto Festorazzi’s 2012 popular biography, emphatic that Claretta ‘died for love of Mussolini’.93 Festorazzi is a historian ready to purvey some of the more outrageous conspiracy theories that circle over ‘the last days of Mussolini’ and has been happy to acknowledge his admiration for a Fascist grandfather.94 But, privileging the personal over the ideological, he elevated Claretta to a higher historical plain than she had earlier achieved. Especially after 1943, she was, Festorazzi has contended, a ‘sort of Ducessa’, ‘queen’ of the RSI–Nazi alliance, a ‘fervent Fascist’ new woman, and ‘pro-German in her innermost marrow’. All in all, she acted as Mussolini’s ‘lover, friend, secretary, confidante, faithful disciple and goad’.95 Such a record renders her ‘a contemporary heroine’, ‘a universal symbol of the deepest oaths of love’. By her behaviour in April 1945, Claretta riveted onto the ‘act of dying a symbolic force, a profound drama, a visceral pathos, in a word, a dignity which the execution of the Duce alone could not have had’.96 Her sacrifice had absolved Mussolini of many of his sins. Yet such saintly qualities did not entail a diminution of her sensual power. Claretta, Festorazzi concluded, is a myth, largely because she is ‘the type of woman that every male dreams of and desires, even while knowing he cannot deserve her’.97 If this interpretation is to be believed, it might almost be thought that Claretta was a more significant Fascist than Mussolini. Yet in composing his book, Festorazzi made only minor use of the massive documentation, 16\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nwhich, over the last decade, has significantly elevated Claretta’s importance in modern Italian history, and disclosed evidence that carried implications well beyond national borders. No historian of the regime can now fail to consult the diaries that Claretta scrawled almost every day into a succession of notebooks after she first met the Duce in April 1932. To the revelations in that source – many older and powerful men have had sex with younger women but an account from the female partner is highly unusual – can be added an extensive correspondence. During the nineteen months of the RSI’s existence, Mussolini wrote no fewer than 318 letters to his lover. An edition of these, including in footnotes many of Claretta’s responses, appeared in 2011, with decidedly forgiving academic commentary.98 Claretta wrote back to her lover, often at greater length, and other members of her family – father, mother and sister – also found reason to send extended epistles to the dictator. Claretta’s record may be an indispensable source for the comprehension of Mussolini’s regime but another of the many ironies in the history and historiography of Fascism is the controversial place of diaries in the dictatorship’s telling. Long pre-eminent was that composed by Mussolini’s sonin-law Ciano, born in 1903 and from 1936 to 1943 the youngest foreign minister in Europe. By 1943 Ciano, in his heart a young conservative, Fascist-style, had transmuted his early callow enthusiasm for the Axis into a bitter dislike of his German allies. On the evening of 24/25 July he duly voted to remove his father-in-law from power. Amid the confusion that followed, Ciano was foolish enough to seek sanctuary in Germany, defying Edda’s advice to go to what would have been a more accommodating Spain.99 He was soon arrested and confined in Verona, with both the Nazis and radical Fascists determined on his execution in retribution for the July ‘betrayal’, and – everyone, including Mussolini, knew – for the more general failings and equivocations of the Italian dictatorship. While the RSI was establishing itself and Mussolini was trying to work out what his life meant as a puppet dictator at Gardone, Ciano went to his death on 11 January 1944. Both Rachele and Claretta vengefully approved his punishment.100 Mussolini, who acknowledged that he was the person really responsible for the faults attributed to Ciano, accepted it much more uneasily, with a typical mixture of unhappiness and self-pity. 17\n\nCLARETTA\n\nUrgent in Ciano’s defence had been his wife, Edda, Mussolini’s eldest and favourite child. Then and later, she might have been willing to admit that ‘marriage was not my most authentic vocation’. But, at the death, she stood by her man as purposefully as both Rachele and Claretta had done in July 1943 and would do, or seek to do, in 1945. When it was plain that Ciano was to die, Edda fled with her children and an accommodating partner to Switzerland, carrying with her the extensive diaries, often antiGerman in their import, that had been kept by her husband. According to Edda, they weighed no less than 48 kilos, six more than she herself when she reached Ischia in 1945. Concealed with difficulty beneath her winter clothes as she crossed the border, they occasioned scurrilous rumours that she was pregnant.101 In such flight, she broke with her father to his frequent lament. On publication after 1945, the Ciano diaries became the most basic source of all serious accounts of the regime, with their exposure of not so much German arrogance and perfidy as Fascist levity and bellicosity.102 As has already been noted, the immediate postwar years unleashed a flood of memoir-writing in Italy as in other combatant states, almost all of it exculpatory, much military or diplomatic, and little of major significance. Over the next generations, the major addition to such literature was the diary of Giuseppe Bottai, the most self-consciously intellectual of Fascist ministers, if a man who nurtured something like a crush on his leader. It appeared in 1982. Bottai survived the war and died in 1959, while his son, Bruno, made a highly successful diplomatic career, rising to be bureaucratic head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (and honorary president of the Federazione Italiana del Cricket). In retirement, Bruno Bottai published his own family story, which, however, lacked the glamour of the Petaccis and Mussolinis.103 Shadowing such publication and any understanding of the regime was another diary, Mussolini’s own. Quite a few survivors from the regime, including his sister, claimed to have seen the Duce regularly jotting down notes and opinions.104 The fate of such alleged writings soon became a rich part of the vivid conspiracy theories which were circling, and continue to circle, over Mussolini’s last days and which, as will be noticed later in this book, include claims about the treasure that he, the Petaccis 18\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nand others who went to their doom may have been carrying, as well as a ‘lost’ packet of letters, which the Duce and Winston Churchill had allegedly exchanged over the years. There is also the issue of how exactly the dictator and his lover died and why she did so, with Churchill again starring as the one who, it is claimed, wanted most to be rid of her. (For more detail, see chapter 7.) Yet the simple truth remains that the correspondence has never emerged, and the case for it ever having existed is slight to non-existent. In regard to the general history of the regime, central place in arguments about missing evidence should be assigned to the ‘Mussolini diaries’, the false Mussolini diaries that is. The fine contemporary historian Mimmo Franzinelli has trenchantly narrated how they appeared, reappeared and then appeared again and, despite frequent exposure of forgery, stubbornly failed to die.105 Their composition began at Vercelli in the early 1950s at the hands of Giulio Panvini Rosati, a pensioner who had once worked for the local police under the RSI, his wife Rosetta Prelli (still in awe of Mussolini’s and Gabriele D’Annunzio’s charisma) and their daughter Amalia (‘Mimi’). The women made themselves into experts in mimicking Mussolini’s handwriting, and were soon adroitly penning a version of the regime’s past. They finished their labour in 1955. They then tried to sell their handiwork for millions of lire, soon assisted by intermediaries from the world of neofascism, and persuaded Mondadori to assess the diaries. However, when consulted, Rachele and other members of the family denied their authenticity, although a sale did go ahead with Time-Life. Just as a fortune beckoned, however, suspicious journalists from Il Corriere della Sera asked for police evaluation and the sham was exposed. In April 1959 Amalia was arrested and put on trial for forgery and fraud, soon to be found guilty; she and Rosa Panvini were sentenced to brief terms in gaol from which they were quickly released.106 The first act of the history of the Mussolini diaries was thereby over, except for a brief epilogue in 1967, when mother and daughter (despite Amalia having had brief further trouble over forging a cheque to a local butcher) again sold their labour, this time to The Sunday Times. However, the renewed falsehood was quickly apparent, and there were further arrests, with De Felice signalling his authoritative disapproval of the pages given to him for 19\n\nCLARETTA\n\ninspection. Rosa Panvini died in 1968 and, although Amalia lived on to 1986, she failed to convince with an imaginative new claim to have acted as a medium of the Duce when doing her writing.107 But the diaries had not lost their charge. A bizarre struggle over them continued among ‘expert’ academic historians, both Italian and foreign, who were regularly asked their opinion of the texts. The Englishman Denis Mack Smith, from his base at All Souls Oxford often in battle with De Felice, announced that the calligraphy was definitely Mussolini’s, adding in sphinx-like words that this ‘was the diary that Mussolini would have wanted to write’.108 Brian R. Sullivan, a North American expert in the tenebrous world of the secret services, declared the material genuine but then recanted in 1987, after hostile graphological analysis at Sotheby’s. Soon he changed tack once more, now taking up existing Italian suggestions that Mussolini had copied his own diaries some time at Salò (or had them copied by a third party) and that revision explained their variation from what he had written in the 1930s.109 The diaries, it was becoming evident, were impossible to kill off in a turbid world of masked owners and special agents seeking scoops for their press barons on either side of the Atlantic, as well as in that Italian arena where memory and popular history promiscuously mingled. Academic historians did not help much. Before his death, De Felice in 1995 made a U-turn of his own to suggest that the material ‘could have preserved the echo of the originals’. Nicholas Farrell also plumped for authenticity.110 Emilio Gentile, De Felice’s successor at Rome University, demurred, as later did Giordano Bruno Guerri, Bottai’s biographer. But Romano Mussolini reversed his own and his family’s longstanding dismissal of the diaries and in 2005 proclaimed their trustworthiness.111 Act three of the diaries’ drama was about to begin. Marcello Dell’Utri, a Sicilian senator who had for decades worked closely with Berlusconi in financial, cultural, press and political matters, emerged as the new protagonist of the diaries, even if he found much other work on his plate. He had held a key role in the foundation of Forza Italia (1993), the initial Berlusconian ‘party’. From 1997 to 2013 Dell’Utri was also fighting a sustained battle in the courts against claims that he nourished close ties with the Mafia. Eventually, in 2014, after Berlusconi had 20\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nfallen from office, Dell’Utri was condemned to seven years’ confinement, with numerous other misdemeanours on his record or still under trial. After fleeing to Lebanon, he was arrested there, returned to Italy and gaoled. It was this man who, in 2007, announced that the diaries had been purchased from Swiss owners by a local company, seemingly under his aegis, and would now be made available through the well-known publishers, Bompiani. Ignoring the reiterated doubts of Gentile, Guerri and other leading Italian historians of Fascism, between 2010 and 2012 Bompiani put onto the market four volumes of what it called ‘the diaries of Mussolini, real or conjectured’ (presunti). Covering the years from 1935 to 1939, they were given further exposure by the ultra-neoliberal and anti-leftist daily paper Libero, which in March–April 2011 serialised the writings in thirty parts. Its editor, Maurizio Belpietro, took pains to ‘honour’ Dell’Utri for their discovery and, it was said, sales of the paper increased markedly.112 Displaying his own anti-anti-Fascism or more, Dell’Utri did not forbear to speak in September 2010 at a conference in Rome arranged by the Associazione di promozione sociale Casa Pound Italia (‘The Society for Promoting Casa Pound to the Italian People’) in celebration of ‘the diaries re-found’, while Pasquale Squitieri, whose career in cinema had been enlarged by a term as a Berlusconian member of parliament, took rhetoric to new and empyrean flights when he told another Rome conference in November: ‘We must cut the word false from the documents. Are the Gospels false? Jesus left nothing written down.’113 The first volume of the diaries to be published, that covering the year of 1939, was bolstered with a lengthy, if anonymous, introduction. There, some of the worries about the veracity of the material were conceded but always with the claim that there was an equal, and probably more convincing, view that they were genuine. Helpfully, Emilio Gentile’s once authoritative rejection was now conditioned by a note saying, despite his grave doubts, that he could not fully judge the diaries’ authenticity. Similarly, readers learned that Eugenio Di Rienzo, an editor of Nuova Rivista Storica, a leading academic journal, had qualified his repudiation with the Delphic remark that, ‘if we are dealing with a falsehood, it is, like all falsehood, based on an element of truth’.114 The introduction ended with what was stated to be a wholly objective ‘scientific’ analysis positively 21\n\nCLARETTA\n\nadjudging the writing style, and the chemical composition of the paper and ink used.115 Sales rocketed past 10,000.116 Bompiani’s publication was not complete before Mario Monti replaced Berlusconi as prime minister in November 2011, while in the background Dell’Utri’s troubles in court multiplied. Moreover, in April 2011 Franzinelli published his devastating (and courageous) exposure of the long history of the diaries’ faking. His denunciation did earn a brief acknowledgement at the back of reprints of the 1939 diary.117 When the entries allegedly covering the years between 1935 and 1937 followed, the introduction was again included but eventually accompanied by the admission that Franzinelli had indeed picked up ‘mistakes’, while it was also now announced that a trial was proceeding in Switzerland over who actually owned the diaries.118 To be sure, the farcical tale of the Hitler diaries, with its own pattern of business corruption and levity and academic vanity, offset with occasional honesty and scholarship, is better known than the Mussolini story.119 In historical celebrity, the Führer always trumps the Duce. Yet the fraudulent Fascist writings have been harder to kill. Italians have shown themselves more readily won over than their sometime German allies by dulcified accounts of dictatorship and by the idea that conspiracies obscure the truth with the same inevitability of winter fogs in the Val Padana. As one popular historian stated in 2014, history was a synonym for lying, in practice never more than victors’ accounts.120 In such circumstances, it would be rash to conclude that, in the long-playing melodrama of the Mussolini diaries, Italians will not eventually be persuaded to watch act four. In this Italian predilection for mysteriously hidden evidence lurks another deep irony. One major reason why anyone who flicks through the content of the Diari veri o presunti might conclude that they are forged is that they contain no mention of Claretta Petacci.121 Rather, and presumably fitting the life assumptions of a mother and daughter from Vercelli, Mussolini’s private life appears conventional, with him not forgetting to expatiate on his deep respect for Rachele and his love for his (legitimate) children. ‘The family is everything for me,’ he was made to write in November 1939, ‘the squeak of the door, the special smell, a wellknown object come back into my attention, the sound of the voices of 22\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthose who are mine, restore me and fill me with comfort . . . Rachele has known how to give our house the simple and healthy, patriarchal, nature of our Romagna.’122 Yet while Dell’Utri, Bompiani and Libero were pressing on regardless with selling the fake diaries, it was already becoming widely known that Mussolini’s last lover had left behind a hefty record of their affair and of many other aspects of the last decade of the dictatorship. A genuinely intimate account of the Duce could now oust the forged version. In November 2009 the journalist Mauro Suttora, a senior editor of Oggi among other attainments, had edited a valuable selection of Claretta’s flood of entries (her scribblings in 1938 alone covered 1,810 pages, although many of these contained fewer than one hundred words). Suttora’s edition covered the years from 1932 to 1938.123 In his introduction, the journalist briefly described the diaries’ provenance, underlining the comment of Emilio Re, the inspector general of the state archives who presided over their discovery in 1950, that ‘people search for Mussolini’s diaries. But the real and important Mussolini diaries are these ones by Petacci, where the dictator becomes a man and is revealed without make-up or artifice. In the diaries and letters there can be found not merely the dictator’s romantic life but also high politics and, on crucial occasions, the life of the entire country.’124 Claretta’s diaries may have long been shrouded by the Italian state. But their pathway into the archives was clear enough. Just before her final flight to Milan on 18 April 1945, Claretta had packed her personal records into crates and passed them into the hands of her friend, Countess Caterina Cervis, who worked for D’Annunzio’s widow, owner of the Vittoriale complex, which included the Villa Mirabella, Petacci’s last sanctuary by Lago di Garda. Cervis and her husband buried the trove and, after 1945, began to realise that it might bring them financial gain. The surviving Petaccis either had similar ideas or were moved by familial piety. In October 1949 Giuseppina Persichetti was the first of their number to return from Spain. When she arrived at Gardone, however, the Cervises received her frostily, refusing her requests to hand over what Claretta had entrusted to them. In February 1950 a leak to Il Corriere della Sera made public what had been done in 1945, with the effect that Italian government officials recovered the Petacci papers. They carried them off to 23\n\nCLARETTA\n\nthe archives in Rome where Emilio Re prepared a full catalogue.125 With Myriam now also back in Italy, in July 1951 the Petacci family sued for the return of their property, seeking 394,935 lire in additional compensation. The favourable judgement in January 1952 was reversed on appeal, with the state’s lawyers emphasising that the documentation had ‘genuine political import’ and was not merely private, for it demonstrated that Claretta’s influence on the Duce had steadily grown. ‘Petacci’, the court heard, ‘may have lacked the highest degree of education. But she was not deprived of natural ingenuity and sometimes, when not blinded by jealousy, was possessed of penetrative understanding.’ Moreover, given the way that she recorded what Mussolini said over the phone ‘almost stenographically’, the diaries could be viewed as much Mussolini’s as hers.126 They belonged therefore to national and not just Petacci family history. Legal activity continued over the return of the Villa Camilluccia, the possible prosecution of those partisans who had killed Mussolini and his lover, and the dispute with Zita Ritossa. However, the Petacci papers remained securely in the vaults of the Archivio Centrale dello Stato, a grand Fascist building in the model regime suburb of EUR (Esposizione Universale Romana), planned under the dictatorship and, perhaps paradoxically, completed after 1945.127 Hopes that the papers would fall back into family hands evaporated. Claretta’s mother, Giuseppina, died in March 1962; her father Francesco Saverio in 1970. Ever since the war, Myriam had acted as the real head of the family and custodian of Claretta’s positive memory. Her life ended in May 1991 amid further controversy and talk of new litigation. The spur was the emergence in the family of Ferdinando Petacci, the second son of Claretta’s elder brother, Marcello. Ferdinando had worked in a range of business activity in the Americas, from 1983 residing in various parts of the USA. His main address is now in Tempe, Arizona. Over her last years, Myriam lived in a flat in EUR in declining economic circumstances. She was nursed by Rita D’Agostini, once a maid in the Mussolini family house and a staunch supporter of the MSI. But, when Ferdinando arrived for his aunt’s funeral, he charged D’Agostini with purloining jewels that Myriam had conserved, with stealing 23 million lire from her accounts and even with hastening her death. Prime among the lost property was, 24\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nallegedly, a ‘testament’ that Claretta had written down before her death and, presumably, not passed on to the Cervises.128 In response, D’Agostini came out fighting, telling journalists that she was the real Fascist. Myriam, she reported, ‘could not bear’ her nephew who, in return, had ignored her and done nothing to alleviate her ‘squalid, solitary, final agony’. Nothing that he claimed was true, she concluded firmly.129 No concrete results of this spat have been recorded and, since then, no further talk of any mysterious last writings by Claretta has recurred. But Ferdinando has very much become the new head of the family and everactive conservator of (a version of ) Claretta’s memory, as well as that of his parents and grandparents. In regard to its trove of Petacci papers, the Archivio Centrale rigorously observed a seventy-year rule. But such a fiat meant that, from the first decade of the new millennium, the diaries could be read and assessed by journalists and scholars and made available for public reckoning. As was noted above, a first selection from the material, covering the years from 1932 to 1938, was published by Suttora in 2009. Two years later, with Franzinelli now editing, another extensive selection appeared with entries from 1939 to 1940. A further volume, again edited by Franzinelli and covering the tumultuous times from 1941 to 1945, has, for obscure reasons, not been published at my time of writing.130 For Ferdinando, issues involving his aunt and parents have become imbricated with the vast theorising about Churchill’s dealings with Mussolini that has involved many Italian historians and commentators. Its origin may well have lain in Fascist wartime propaganda depicting ‘the English’ as the prime national enemy and was certainly cherished by neofascists after 1945; one grew almost apoplectic in expressing his dislike of Churchill’s fat pink face, which he compared to ‘that of an over-fed eunuch’.131 This associated story of forgery, political manipulation, naive or wilful misreading and/or invention of evidence has recently been recounted by Franzinelli, with the same immense critical skill that he displayed in unravelling the faking of the Mussolini diaries.132 Ferdinando Petacci, who must reject such findings, had already made plain his views in a preface attached to Suttora’s collection,133 and took them further in a coda published with the volume about 1939–40.134 In this latter case, 25\n\nCLARETTA\n\nFerdinando began with the assertion that his aunt had actually been an ‘anti-Fascist’ arguing that, right from the first meeting in 1932 with the Duce, she had been motivated not by passion but the desire to spy. It was that devotion which kept her attached to the Duce, even when he began to mistreat her. Whatever her sex life, she remained in her soul a Catholic, and her profound religious belief eliminated any temptation to indulge in that anti-Semitism legislated by the regime after 1938. In Ferdinando’s reading, the diaries were therefore not ‘real’, since they did not really convey his aunt’s actual thoughts and personality (and covert actions), but only Mussolini’s. For example they did not hint at the possibility that, given his contacts in the Vatican, Francesco Saverio Petacci could have acted as a conduit to pass Claretta’s secrets to the British. After such remarkable claims, Ferdinando switched his attention to Churchill and to the ‘lost’ Mussolini letters, reiterating the views of the numerous paladins of this conspiracy theory that, in 1945, the ruthless British prime minister needed to dispose of embarrassing papers and agents who had served their use. Ferdinando gave a new twist to the conspiracies, suggesting that the diaries had probably been interfered with somehow and by somebody. They had, for example, been manipulated to accuse Mussolini of responsibility for the Holocaust, when he was not really a sincere anti-Semite. So, Petacci concluded with a bleak refusal of the merit of any historiography, ‘in so far as Italy is concerned, only archaeologists in some far-off future perhaps will be able to reconstruct the history of our country, if technological advances allow them to distinguish between false and authentic documentation’.135 Failing any evidence to sustain Ferdinando Petacci’s spirited comprehension of his national and family history, an analyst has every reason to rejoice in the amplitude of the Petacci papers and in the bright light that they throw on the Italian dictatorship and many of the interpretative disputes that mark it (as they should do while democratic history can thrive or survive as ‘an argument without end’).136 For anybody wanting to probe the nature of Mussolini’s dictatorship, in sum, diaries – real and conjectured – are the beginning of wisdom. What Ciano reported in his version, published quickly in the postwar period, was largely political and diplomatic, although the fact that he was 26\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\na brilliant young man ensured that his unspoken assumptions revealed much about how a natural young conservative coped with chat about Fascist revolution and its totalitarian realignment, in theory, of all Italian hearts and minds. Predictably, the fake Mussolini diaries tie simplistically with the historiographical assumptions of 1950, privileging high politics and the making of peace and war. They naturally connect with the oldfashioned, neo-Rankean approach to history, sustained to his death in 1996 by De Felice as the doyen of Fascist studies, and by no means yet abandoned in many Italian and foreign academic studies of the regime. By contrast, the Petacci diaries and letters, and the other material, doubtless on occasion fragile and scandalous, need to be read between the lines, just as all historical sources do. Claretta was undoubtedly ‘telling her own story’ as she obsessively scribbled down every remark her lover directed at her, either over the phone or when they were in more intimate contact, whether to do with their latest squabble or with politics and ideology. She was also endeavouring to tell the Duce’s story as a man of sublime grandeur (and occasional personal weakness). Claretta may have been starstruck. But she never lost a sense of self nor a kind of self-importance. The haste of her writing demonstrates an urgency that drove her as a diarist, stark proof that her subjectivity was engrained into her pages. As time went on and she matured in her own fashion, she became ever more resolute in a self-defined task to stiffen the Duce against his sea of troubles. It would be naive to ask whether Claretta was telling the truth in her pages, and there must have been occasions when she misunderstood or slanted material in her own favour. Diarists, by definition, like to think that they matter and are given to exaggeration on that score. Yet the verisimilitude of Claretta’s account is unchallengeable and it and the other sources that can be brought to bear on the Petacci family story open new avenues of understanding of the Mussolini dictatorship and its curious medley of avowedly ‘totalitarian’ social engineering and practical compromise with existing Italian histories. In so doing, Claretta’s extensive papers fit neatly into the new preoccupation of historians with emotions and psychology and what may be the deep springs of human actions. Their pages record orgasm, the extrusion of most bodily fluids, hysteria, fainting fits, illness, anger, jealousy, possessiveness, love and hate, music, poetry, 27\n\nCLARETTA\n\nreading and art, as well as politics. They illuminate the ‘private’ at least as much as they do the ‘public’. They draw attention to the Catholic, the familial, the local and Roman, the bourgeois, the personal, while displaying – despite the deep hostility that Claretta and her family provoked among those most committed to the RSI – the Fascist, even the radical fascist. In entering the world of Claretta Petacci and her family, readers will confront a ‘real’ Italy, one that was not merely ‘legal’ or ideological. Claretta’s story may lack the depth of tragedy. But, in its human texture, commitment and contradiction, as well as its female representation of ‘love’ and sex in high places, it is worth deep and detailed reflection.\n\n28\n\n1\n\nSEX AND THE COMING DICTATOR\n\nO\n\nne per day through his adult life. Five thousand. Four hundred. One hundred and sixty-two. About twenty (by Rachele’s reckoning). The number of women with whom Mussolini is said to have had sex varies wildly.1 In a conversation with a (male) admirer in 1937, Mussolini deprecated too elevated an estimate of his sexual prowess. ‘As far as women are concerned,’ he declared, ‘my experience is the same as all healthy men, neither more nor less than others. If I, Mussolini, had had truck with all the women they claim for me, I would have to have been a stallion rather than a man.’ A Don Giovanni or a ‘ladies’ man’ must be despised, he added.2 By contrast, when indulging in bed-chat with Claretta, Mussolini boasted on one occasion that he simply could not remember the tally of women whom he had penetrated. Then he liked to savour how, some time not long after his installation as prime minister, he had kept fourteen different lovers on the go at the same time, satisfying four of them every day. In May 1938 he boasted to the wide-eyed Claretta that he had sex with one at 8 p.m., another at 9, another at 10 . . . before climaxing with ‘a terrible Brazilian’ whose name he had forgotten (leaving open the distinct possibility that he was fantasising to his credulous young partner).3 On another occasion, he complained to Claretta that, in 1923–4, he had been lonely, with only Margherita Sarfatti, Bianca Ceccato and another woman showing up in his bed from time to time.4 29\n\nCLARETTA\n\nAny sexual pleasure for him or them may have been brief. Quinto Navarra, major-domo at Palazzo Venezia, in his graphic but controversial memoirs, allegedly written after the war by two journalists on the make, reckoned the Duce took two or three minutes over each copulation,5 with the implication picked up by the biographer Denis Mack Smith that sex with this dictator was rape or something similar to it – ‘sadism’ not love.6 Whatever the case – and all the literature on the subject, marked as it is by scandal, innuendo or sentiment, needs sceptical scrutiny – by most accounts sex and Mussolini went together as automatically as a horse and carriage. To use a cruder parallel from the animal world adopted by the sometime Fascist and later radical conservative and celebrity journalist Indro Montanelli the dictator dealt with women as ‘a cock does his hens’.7 A contemporary journalist-historian, Roberto Olla, has a more circumspect metaphor: ‘sex . . . was at the centre of the myth of Mussolini: all the rest turned upon this, like a wheel around a hub’.8 The most extreme representation of the Duce in this regard came in a tract written in 1945 by Carlo Emilio Gadda, another intellectual with a Fascist past by then renounced. It was entitled Eros e Priapo. Long held to be obscene, the work was published in expurgated version in 1967 when Gadda labelled his old leader ‘the leading Harvester, Fantasist and Ejaculator’ of Italy. Under this dictator’s rule, he declared, all that women had to do for the patria was ‘to let themselves be fucked’. In his opinion, the Duce’s governance was less revolutionary or tyrannical than priapic.9 It is therefore surprising to find Alexander Geppert, a German cultural historian, maintaining that Adolf Hitler was ‘an adored object of desire, a powerful sex symbol and a pined-for lover’, stimulating in his fans carnality of greater intensity than that aroused by Mussolini. The Italian dictator, by contrast, Geppert argues, ‘appears as a different type of leader – less sexualised and more avuncular – who was to be contacted for direct advice and uncomplicated assistance’ by women of the people.10 Geppert’s sample of Germans is meagre and he seems to have done no serious research on Italy. He has not noticed, for example, a letter reeking with childish passion that Mussolini received from a Florentine first communicant in May 1936. ‘I, so little, with so many defects, so distracted and sometimes disobedient to Mamma and Papà, so negligent with my school work, such an egoist’, she 30\n\nSEX AND THE COMING DICTATOR\n\nwrote with pre-teenage angst to a master on high. ‘If only I could receive you together with Jesus! To be on my tongue, to lie on my chest, to rest on my poor heart! How good that would be!’ she concluded in innocent intermingling of fleshly fellatio and holy sacrament.11 Nonetheless, Geppert may have a point worth noting: much of the development of Mussolini’s image as a Latin lover run wild actually occurred after the war, where stories of his rampages became a natural partner to the sentimentalising of the dictatorship in the illustrated weeklies. Before 1945 ordinary Italians, if it is possible to use the term, in the great majority of cases lived their daily lives far from the centres of power, and Geppert is correct in arguing that Fascist welfare policies, despite what now can be comprehended as their corruption and confusion,12 were marketed by an active and adroit propaganda as gushing like a fountain from the dictator himself. The Archivio Centrale preserves tens of thousands of letters, written by Italians to their dictator, the majority of which seek implicit or explicit gain through Mussolini’s personal intervention and are more interested in property, employment and improved living conditions than sex.13 Moreover, there are other reasons to doubt the common implication that Mussolini was unusual in his sexual reach and performance. After all, the literature hostile to autocratic power is filled with sex scandals and regularly insists that dictators display their ruthlessness in bed as unrestrainedly as they do in public policy. The behaviour of such Julio-Claudian emperors as Caligula and Nero (or, with a different gender cast, Tiberius), as slyly described by Suetonius and Tacitus, has been a lasting model. In more recent times, especially, and perhaps in Mussolini’s wake (however transmuted by local factors), pen portraits of the copulative habits of dictators have remained conspicuous. Muammar Gaddafi, a French journalist declared, was ‘a tyrant who ruled through sex, obsessed with the idea of one day possessing the wives or daughters of the rich and powerful, of his ministers and generals, of chiefs of state and monarchs’. On a daily basis, Gaddafi made do with raping and enslaving ‘hundreds of young girls’, the charge runs. Only in brutal and rapid sexual congress could he be truly satiated in his rise from poor Bedouin to ‘Brotherly Leader’ of his people.14 More flamboyant was Jean-Bédel Bokassa in the Central African Republic, an admirer of Napoleon who, in 1976, elevated himself to 31\n\nCLARETTA\n\nemperor. Bokassa tallied seventeen legitimate wives and thirty recognised progeny, of whom one bore the euphonious name Charlemagne. An expert on his regime has suggested that Bokassa’s children numbered ‘in the hundreds’;15 with this quiverful, Bokassa eclipsed his imperial model. In regard to the romance of power, however, Napoleon is still an eminent figure and one from whom it is hard to separate politics and sex. The Frenchman is especially remembered for his frank expression of love. As he wrote to Josephine Beauharnais, he longed to ‘kiss her heart and then lower on her body, much, much lower’.16 Not for nothing was Mussolini the (co-)author of a play about Napoleon, being given to muse uneasily with Claretta whether he yet had come up to the Corsican’s heroic ideal.17 Petacci was, however, no Josephine, being far too prudish to allow her diary to record their physicality over-frankly; she coyly wrote ‘c..o’ for culo (‘bum’), ‘p . . .’ for puttana (‘whore’) and could not spell pederast or haemorrhoid,18 while Mussolini’s own youthful bodice-ripper, The cardinal’s mistress (1910), was scarcely explicit in its depiction of sex.19 If dictators (and they are always male) are often assumed to have been rampant in their lust, other prominent men of the Fascist era scarcely confined themselves to the marriage bed. The Futurist poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti assured his diary in 1917 that he needed a new woman every day. ‘I am always a man of rapid and violent coitus,’ he ruminated complacently, ‘then comes sleep and detachment’ (although, in possible retribution for such sexism, in 1923 he married Benedetta Cappa, twenty-one years his junior; she proved at least as thrusting a personality as he).20 Before that, Marinetti’s self-consciously wicked denunciation of the family as ‘an inferior sentiment, almost animal, created by fear’ was wildly inaccurate as a presage of the behaviour of actual families, like the Petaccis and Mussolinis, under Fascism.21 Gabriele D’Annunzio, another poet whose political appeal made him a serious rival to Mussolini as a post-First World War Duce, judged himself immodestly to be ‘the world’s greatest lover’. According to his most recent biographer, D’Annunzio possessed special flair in cunnilingus (a sceptical historian might wonder whether Claretta could imagine that version of intimacy).22 On the other side of the gender divide lay Doris Duranti, early cinema star and sometime lover of Alessandro Pavolini, the secretary of the revived Partito Fascista Repubblicano (PFR; Republican Fascist 32\n\nSEX AND THE COMING DICTATOR\n\nParty) under the Repubblica Sociale Italiana, who claimed in her memoirs to have bedded at least one hundred men.23 She was also demanding: early in their relationship, Pavolini was reported to have given her five expensive furs just as a token of love.24 Taking lovers was standard practice among Fascist Party hierarchs. As was noted, Ciano was thought a competitor with his father-in-law in his array of sexual partners. Italo Balbo, the most serious potential rival to Mussolini within the Fascist Party, while remaining solicitous towards his wife (she was the daughter of a rich banker) and family, found time for numerous affairs. There were even rumours of intercourse with Crown Princess Maria José, who was locked in a loveless marriage with Umberto, the heir to the throne. When Balbo was rusticated in 1933 to be governor of Libya, he took with him his young lover, the actor Laura Adami, and patronised her appearances there as Ophelia, Juliet and in other celebrated roles.25 Adami, born in 1913, was a year younger than Claretta. Michele Bianchi, Roberto Farinacci, Ettore Muti, Arturo Bocchini and many other Fascist bosses behaved similarly.26 Mussolini’s private secretariat kept extensive, and presumably useful, files on the sexual peccadilloes of the regime’s ruling elite; there, charges of adultery were at least as common as complaints about peculation.27 But too inflated emphasis on dictators and Italians may be mistaken. After all, American president John F. Kennedy assured the gentlemanly British prime minister Harold Macmillan (who had the courtesy to put up with his wife’s longstanding affair with his bisexual friend, Robert Boothby), that he needed a woman every three days or else would be rent by a terrible headache.28 Another biographer reckons it was one per day but adds that Kennedy declared that his ‘passion’ was ‘spent quickly’ and readily ‘disposed of like an itch’.29 An aide computed knowingly that, in so far as the administration of the American empire was concerned, sex demanded ‘less time than tennis’.30 In our own era, Dominique StraussKahn sounds as though he was at least as ruthless as Kennedy in his mating habits,31 while Berlusconi retailed a myth of himself as a great lover as enthusiastically as did Mussolini.32 Nor was patriarchal behaviour very different in that generation which made Italy during the Risorgimento. Giuseppe Garibaldi, for one, broke 33\n\nCLARETTA\n\nimmediately with a second wife thirty-four years his junior when he heard allegations of her infidelity. His next wife, married in 1880 just before his death, was forty years younger than he and the wet nurse of his grandchildren. Earlier, as Lucy Riall has described, Garibaldi ‘had a series of passionate, overlapping relationships with several women’, some of them foreign.33 Patriarchal attitudes and actions may flourish wherever men gather. But, of modern ideologies, Fascism is the most extreme in putting men on top in its imagined ideal society. In that regard, Victoria De Grazia began her study How Fascism ruled women: ‘Mussolini’s regime stood for returning women to home and hearth, restoring patriarchal authority, and confining female destiny to bearing babies.’34 Often enough, Mussolini was crass in expressing his contempt for women. As he assured his celebrated interviewer, Emil Ludwig, in 1932, with himself in mind, ‘women exert no influence upon strong men’. After all, he added, they were ‘analytical, not synthetical’ and could only ‘play a passive part’ in the great world. ‘During all the centuries of civilisation’, they had followed and not led men, he concluded sententiously.35 Quite a few historians have accepted that Mussolini’s Ascension Day speech in 1927 was the crucial guide to his regime’s purpose with its pledge to ‘dictate demography’ and thereby police and animate the bedrooms of the masses.36 Yet the most recent study of the fate of the Italian family under the dictatorship has concluded that Fascism failed to decide ‘the exact contours of the family discourse that it wanted to propagate’, with the result being that, throughout the era, Catholicism, not the dictatorship, ‘offered the dominant model of family life in Italy’. The regime failed to alter either the law or Italians’ ‘long-standing beliefs, habits and customs’ in regard to their family loyalty.37 Similarly De Grazia wryly deployed the cliché in her book’s title in order to expose the actual variation and confusion of policy and practice, especially where there was radical chat about the marshalling of the ‘new Fascist woman’. In examining Claretta Petacci and her world, it is important therefore to underline that Mussolini’s behaviour towards his sexual partners was more nuanced than sensational accounts of the ‘Great Ejaculator’ have allowed. It may be that evidence about his other relationships is less reliable and extensive than that revealed so rapturously about Claretta’s ties 34\n\nSEX AND THE COMING DICTATOR\n\nwith the Duce in her papers. Yet a full comprehension of their affair in turn demands knowledge of the dictator’s other dealings with women and a portrayal of how Mussolini behaved sexually during his socialist youth, his Fascist rise to power and once installed as dictator. By his own account, his first intercourse occurred while a teenager in a local brothel, as it must have done for many boys of his class. The woman, he recalled, was older than he was and much more experienced. It was not his only meeting with a prostitute. When serving his term of military conscription in 1905–6, he informed Claretta in 1938, ‘I often went to the brothel where the women were rather knowing and dirty. But they initiated me into the mysteries and vices of sex.’ Before that ‘a romantic’, afterwards, he explained coldly, ‘I have regarded all the women whom I have taken as if they were in a brothel. For my carnal satisfaction.’38 The chronology of Mussolini’s memory was as vague as his sentiments were crude and peremptory. But there are accounts, more or less credible, of fleeting affairs with women, often the wives of other men, who crossed his path while he was a primary school teacher in the provinces or a questing socialist emigrant in Switzerland and the Austrian Trentino. When he was teaching at Tolmezzo, for example, he disclosed to Claretta, ‘the girls were wild for me’, but the name of only one of them – Graziosa – had stuck in his memory.39 The use of force was often a key part of Mussolini’s recollection, and a method to be applauded. Whether events happened exactly as he described and whether male aggression was unusual in his world at the time remains imponderable. More established is the claim that, at Trento in 1909, he fathered a boy child on a socialist comrade called Fernanda Oss Facchinelli. But the baby did not survive infancy and the relationship soon ended.40 Apart from his ‘sainted mother’, Rosa Maltoni, who died, aged only forty-six, in 1904 – Mussolini never ceased to invoke this reverent or clichéd image of her maternal love for him in his waywardness41 – the most impressive woman whom he met in these years as an aspirant revolutionary was the Russian Marxist Angelica Balabanoff. Five years his senior, she assumed a major part in his life as a teacher of elementary dialectics, a legacy that remained with him as dictator when he had frequent need to appear knowing, without having the time or will to master the subject 35\n\nCLARETTA\n\ninvolved.42 A recent biographer of Balabanoff has contended that she and Mussolini were lovers from when they met in Switzerland for almost a decade until 1913, but the contention seems based on the fancy, common in that era, and certainly held by Mussolini, that a man and a woman could not be alone together without sexual congress.43 If there was once a fondness between them, Balabanoff had radically changed her mind in a work first published in New York in 1942, where her character study of the dictator was devastatingly hostile. ‘Naturally diffident, a misanthrope, always worried about looking a fool, envious of those who knew anything . . . Mussolini saw in every intellectual an enemy and competitor.’ For all loyal socialists, she concluded, he was nothing more than ‘A Man bought and sold, a Judas, a murderous Cain.’44 Mussolini, by contrast, was surprisingly generous in his recollection of her, telling a young male admirer that she had indeed taught him how to think.45 Speculation about a period when many wild oats were sown does not end but takes a new course after the commencement of the Duce’s partnership with his eventual wife and the mother of his five legitimate children, Rachele Guidi, late in 1909. The two were joined in a socialist small-town romance, with Mussolini soon carrying off his young lover (born in April 1890, she was almost seven years his junior) from his father’s home through the rain so they could live together in a tiny flat at Forlì, where Mussolini was the editor and sole serious journalist on the staff of the earnestly entitled local socialist paper, La Lotta di Classe (‘The Class Struggle’). As he later drooled in his rough manner to Claretta, Rachele was then ‘in flower, buxom, with magnificent breasts, beautiful’. ‘A peasant’, he added in evident sop to his bourgeois lover’s readily aroused jealousy, ‘but a beautiful one’. One day, he ran on, ‘I threw her on an armchair and took her virginity . . . with my accustomed violence.’ Soon thereafter she fell pregnant and, accepting her plea that he not abandon her, they agreed to pursue a life together, with the result that he abandoned a half-idea he was treasuring of immigrating to the USA.46 The first child of this relationship was a daughter, Edda, born on 1 September 1910. Until just before they set up house together, Rachele had been residing with her mother, Anna Guidi, who herself was the lover of Mussolini’s father, Alessandro, prompting unsubstantiated claims 36\n\nSEX AND THE COMING DICTATOR\n\nthat Rachele may have been Benito’s half-sister.47 Scandalmongers on occasion have similarly asserted that Edda was ‘really’ Balabanoff ’s child,48 and even contended that, after she had grown up, Mussolini committed incest with her.49 In 1912 a momentous change occurred in Mussolini’s life when his revolutionary faction triumphed at the Socialist Party congress at Reggio Emilia. In reward for this victory, Mussolini, still only twenty-nine, was promoted to editor of the main party newspaper, Avanti!, which had just moved its office from Rome to Italy’s business capital, Milan. Now Edda, her father and mother rented a flat in a bustling modern city; for Benito Mussolini confinement in the dull and politically flaccid provinces was over. This new world proffered fresh sexual opportunity: Mussolini was scarcely confined by comradeship with his partner, Rachele, (‘la mia compagna’, as he called her),50 even though they took out a civil marriage certificate in December 1915, before Rachele gave birth to two further children, sons Vittorio and Bruno, in September 1916 and April 1918. While his legitimate family was expanding, Mussolini’s political life was subject to momentous change. From 1911 to 1914 he assumed a leading Party role as a socialist revolutionary, as well as proving a capable journalist and business manager on Avanti! The outbreak of European war brought a radical shift when, in October, following the guidance of many of his country’s leading intellectuals, Mussolini swung round to demand national entry into the conflict and did so at the cost of expulsion from the Socialist Party and the loss of his editorship of its daily paper. He quickly returned to the fray as editor of his own newspaper, Il Popolo d’Italia (‘The People of Italy’), its Mazzinian or warmongering populism announcing that he now spoke for the nation above class. Italy finally did enter battle against Austria in May 1915, and five months later Mussolini accepted conscription into the national armed forces, serving at the front along the Isonzo valley until wounded by shrapnel on 24 February 1917 in an accidental explosion behind the lines.51 But words and guns did not entirely fill his life. Through these hectic times, Mussolini, despite his union with Rachele, formed continuing relationships with three other women, Leda Rafanelli, Margherita Grassini Sarfatti and Ida Dalser, as his actual or hoped for sexual partners. 37\n\nCLARETTA\n\nIt was before the war that, on 28 February 1912, Clara (‘Claretta’) Petacci was born into a respectable, ambitious and deeply Catholic Roman bourgeois family (utterly antithetical to Mussolini’s then-imagined destiny as the leader of socialist and universal revolution). She owed her name to their devotion to Santa Chiara, an early follower of St Francis of Assisi. The pater familias was Francesco Saverio (Francis Xavier) Petacci, the piety of his name evoking the family’s longstanding and continuing links with the Vatican. Francesco Saverio had, however, been born in Constantinople in 1883, making him the same age as Mussolini. In the Turkish capital, his father, Edoardo, worked as a senior official in the Ottoman postal service, allegedly pioneering its use of stamps. Edoardo Petacci was one of those not uncommon Italian professionals who had for centuries been scattered around the Mediterranean basin, in an experts’ imperialism still lacking overt ties with that of the modern nation state. It was a background that Francesco Saverio shared with the Futurist chief Marinetti, born in Alexandria in 1876 to a lawyer and businessman who gave counsel to the khedive of Egypt. In 1902 F.S. Petacci returned to Italy to complete medical training, rejoicing in the recommendations and patronage of his doctor uncle, Giuseppe, who held a prestigious post in the pope’s medical service. There, in 1915, he found space for his nephew. Francesco Saverio’s practice as a doctor was better rewarded financially in successive clinics that he operated, one being in the flourishing new Roman suburb of Monteverde. By the 1930s F.S. Petacci directed another medical practice, purposefully situated at Via Nazionale 69 in the city centre. In 1909 Francesco Saverio had married his cousin, Giuseppina Persichetti, born in 1888 into a fertile Catholic family; she had seven siblings. Her father, Augusto, at least according to his granddaughter, Myriam, had been a leader of the Italian Catholic Youth Society soon after that body came into existence in 1867.52 The Petaccis and the Mussolinis may have been a class apart but, similar to Benito and Rachele, there was no delay in the arrival of children to Giuseppina and Francesco Saverio. A son was born on 1 May 1910, May Day. The Petaccis utterly rejected that date’s coincidence with the socialist workers’ festival by christening their son Marcello Cesare Augusto, thereby arming him with that romanità 38\n\nSEX AND THE COMING DICTATOR\n\n(spirit of classical Rome) which would become a major theme in Fascist propaganda but which had already before 1914 beguiled the minds of respectable Romans. During the next year of Cinquantennio (fiftieth anniversary celebrations of national unity), the grandiose Victor Emmanuel monument was opened athwart the ancient Capitol and the nation embarked on aggressive and brutal imperial conquest of the Ottoman provinces of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, which the Italians called Libya, drawing on the Latin word for North Africa.53 Rhetoricians hailed the augmented power of the ‘Third Italy’ and exulted in its modern ‘legionaries’ ‘reclaiming an empire’. By contrast, the revolutionary socialist, Mussolini, at the time of Edda’s birth deeply and ostentatiously anti-national and anti-clerical, lambasted Rome as ‘a parasitic city, full of landladies, shoeshine boys, prostitutes, priests and bureaucrats’.54 Mussolini’s soul, unlike those of the Petaccis, was certainly not yet Roman. Dreams of empire among the bourgeoisie did not necessarily convert into action. When Marcello grew to manhood, as will be seen below, he proved less Caesar Augustus than princeling, assiduously seeking promotion and financial gain through his sister’s influence. Meanwhile, for more than a decade, with Giuseppina somehow controlling her fertility, he and Claretta were the Petaccis’ only children, before Myriam completed the new generation on 31 May 1923. All were proud to be Petaccis; parents and offspring were deeply bonded as a family, with a commitment that neither Claretta’s entry into Mussolini’s bed nor the ‘tragedy’ of 1945 weakened for an instant. Such developments in the lives of Roman bourgeois occurred well beyond Mussolini’s ken. In Milan, however, there was plenty to do for the new editor of Avanti! and aspirant leader of a socialist movement seemingly fixed on revolution, even if he never renounced his own social and intellectual ambitions. Advances in his public life could readily be matched by fresh excitement in his private. Now among his widening contacts was Leda Rafanelli, a new woman of the belle époque, primed to open Mussolini’s mind to a rich and world-girdling span of culture and politics. An anarchist of independent cast, Rafanelli flirted with what was called ‘Arabism’ and ‘the spirit of the East’, read books, presided over a salon and 39\n\nCLARETTA\n\nenthused about gender and racial equality. An observer might add that, if photos are to be believed, she looked her age and, with a large nose, slim figure and her dark eyes fixed on the camera, she was anything but a conventional ‘Italian’ beauty. But, for a questing Mussolini, it was easy to conjoin physical and intellectual appeal. Indeed, Rafanelli’s range and unconventionality stunned the young man from Forlì. Her endorsement of ‘free love’ seemed enticingly to offer him a more earthy consummation of their friendship, although it is doubtful whether coitus between the two ever occurred. Nonetheless, hard at work in his editorial position, and writing furiously there and elsewhere, Mussolini eagerly found time for penning frequent epistles to Rafanelli and for plotting meetings with her in his spare time, either in the af"
