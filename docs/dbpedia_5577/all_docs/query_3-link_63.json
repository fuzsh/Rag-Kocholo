        "text": "Zebulun\n\nAustralia / New Zeland / Netherlands\n\nZebulun is believed to have settled in Holland; which has a province named Zebulund (Zealand); and also in Australia and New Zealand, among other places. The boat and sea on Zebulun's Tribal Standard is also featured on New Zealand's (New Zebulund's) Coat-of-Arms. “The Netherlands (Holland) features lions on its Coat of Arms. Lions symbolize all of Israel especially as united under the House of David from Judah whose special sign is a lion…The Dutch come mainly from Zebulon though other tribal groups (such as those from Naphtali) are also present” (The Tribes, p. 318). Prophesied to be a “haven of the sea,” Holland is composed of much rich farmland reclaimed from the ocean. Also, Amsterdam (at the mouth of the mighty Rhine River, with a vast flotilla of barges arriving daily) and Rotterdam (world-renowned as a Europort and vital shipping link for the European Union) were two of the world’s greatest ports in the early 1960s. Another prophecy in Deuteronomy shows that Zebulun would “Rejoice…in your going out” (33:18). Notice what author Luigi Barzini says about the Dutch peoples in his book, The Europeans: “This passion for the sea drove them [the Dutch] to conquer not neighboring provinces…but to set up distant trading points all over the world…They settled in New Amsterdam [which became New York City], a vast natural port, cluttered with flat sandy islands large and small, at the mouth of a big river, which evidently reminded them of home; in South Africa, Japan, Formosa, Brazil, Ceylon, Indonesia, the West Indies, and many other profitable places” (p. 208). The prophecy continues by explaining that Zebulun would “suck [of] the abundance of the seas, and [of] treasures hid in the sand” (vs. 19). The Netherlands has always been able to do this in several ways. One is through international commerce by the use of her shipping fleet. Another way has been through the reclamation of land from the sea. The Dutch are well known for building dykes and reclaiming land for the use of farming.\n\nLine 1: King Edward I Plantagenet \"Longshanks\" to Meriwether Lewis13\n\n1.
