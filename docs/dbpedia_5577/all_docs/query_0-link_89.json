        "text": "Despite the growing number of publications on the Russo-Japanese War, an abundance of questions and issues related to this topic remain unsolved, or call for a reexamination. This 30-chapter volume, the first in the two-volume project Rethinking the Russo-Japanese War, provides a comprehensive reexamination of the origins of the conflict, the various dimensions of the nineteen-month conflagration, the legacy of the war, and its place in the history of the twentieth century. Such an enterprise is not only timely but unique. It has benefited from a multinational team of thirty-two scholars from twelve nations representing a broad disciplinary background. The majority of them focus on topics never researched before and without exception provide a novel and critical view of the war. This reexamination is, of course, facilitated by a century-long perspective as well as an impressive assortment of primary and secondary sources, many of them unexplored and, in a number of cases, unavailable earlier.

Narrative processes participating in sense- making take place within a cultural context, and can be studied via a diatextual approach to the discursive structures and the tools of Greimasian narrative semiotics. Contextualisation in narrative enunciations means not only using elements of actorialisation, spatialisation and temporalisation, but also ‘dramatising’ the relationship between Self and Other through «cultural metaphors» (Gannon 2011). This paper explores three authors’ texts from post-WWII Italian literature, showing three different representations or ‘narra- tive uses’ of Japan: Il re dei Giapponesi (1949), an unfinished novel by Pier Paolo Pasolini; If on a Winter's Night a Traveler (1979), Palomar (1983) and Collection of Sand (1984) by Italo Calvino; Silk (1996), a short novel by Alessandro Baricco. In these texts, I examine the distinct meaning of Japan’s metaphors, high- lighting the different levels of exoticism in Japan’s description, and the different degrees of the subject's involvement in terms of their relationship with otherness (embrayage or débrayage). Japan can be used in literary fiction as a ‘pretext’ (Pasolini), as a setting (Baricco), or as a context (Calvino). In any case, it serves as a cultural metaphor: a rhetorical apparatus conveying portrayals of Japan to Italian contemporary cul- ture with different degrees of verisimilitude, ranging from an almost fable-like scenery to a vague historical background and a peculiar biographical frame.\n\nThe essay is framed by the story of an early translation of the metaphorical expression “republic of letters” into an East Asian language. The story itself—reconstructed from primary archival materials—is then used as an illustration of the processes of transmission, translation, and communication that brought into existence something like a republic of letters on a Eurasia-wide scale. Although scholarly consensus is no longer marked by the uncritical acceptance of the description of Tokugawa Japan as a “closed country,” the trope of isolationism continues not just to shape the popular awareness of the period, but to determine disciplinary agendas. This is particularly true of the disciplinary culture of intellectual history, which has mostly taken “Japanese thought” for its self-evident object. Yet, in the face of considerable geopolitical and logistical odds, by the eighteenth century there was a quite densely interconnected sphere of textual culture that can be seen as Eurasian in its scope. Japan was part of this network to such an extent that the trope of a “closed country” is unfitting to characterize the intellectual activity of the early modern period. This micro-historical study of a particular translation’s conditions of possibility is an attempt to demonstrate how we could do intellectual history differently, in this case by recasting Japan as a nodal point within a Eurasian network of the transmission of texts, metaphors, and imaginaries that partook in the generation of knowledge.\n\nSince the global success of the Made in Italy brand in the 1980s, Japan has witnessed an Italian boom in the early 1990s, turning Italy in the last decade into the most loved foreign country in Japan, especially among women and youth. The recent popularity of Italy in Japan is unparalleled in the whole world as in regards to intensity and duration, but had passed mostly unnoticed in terms of academic investigation. The underlying assumption of this essay is that such popularity relies to a large extent on how “Italy” has been configured as an orientalized and idealised “West”, resulting from an ambivalent process of both superiorization of its classical past and inferiorization of its modern present. It is the very configuration of “Italy” as a strategical interface between the hegemonic Euro-American other and the subaltern Japanese self that proves to be particularly seductive in mediating deep rooted, unresolved, and uncanny tensions of pro-Westernism and anti-Westernism. This essay will explore how the transnational space of Italianness takes form through cumulative encounter between emotional geographies of “the West” articulated in Japan (Occidentalism), as well as of “the East” in Italy (Orientalism). Most influential representations of Italy and Italians embedded in Japanese cultural landscape will be investigated by focusing on their fluid intersections with the lived experience and projections of both Japanese and Italians in contemporary Japan as in regards to issues of nation, race/ethnicity, gender, and sexuality."
