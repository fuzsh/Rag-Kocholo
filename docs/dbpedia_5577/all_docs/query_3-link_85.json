        "text": "PART I\n\nThe Country\n\nStruck with Consequence\n\nA Canadian journalist wrote a few years ago that people like me—male writers and artists—live in the West mainly because things stay the same, because what you loved one day you could be forgiven for loving the next. I don’t think the motive is ignoble, or restricted to males. I have lived for sixteen years now in a determinedly unchic western town whose charms are obscure, austere, sometimes even squalid, and so far I have been forgiven for all that I love. But I like another of that journalist’s quotes better: The wilderness reminded him that everything he did had a consequence.\n\nWe fell in love with the country first. For coastal people, the Real West is wilder and more full of marvels than they can imagine without living in it . . . or, often, even when they do begin to live in it. The heart of the West will always be the big dry blue blocks of forest service and BLM land, cut into spaces the size of New England states by highways and New West boomtowns. Off in their centers, invisible to travelers, are whole worlds. But there is so much going on at the edges that it takes a while to get to them. In my first months in New Mexico I saw a bobcat in my yard and picked up an unfortunate adolescent lion’s skull in the arroyo that flowed through town. I flushed golden eagles from the highway’s edge, and climbed to falcon aeries that overlooked pavement. Ravens—in my other life rare denizens of the coast of Maine—were now rarely out of sight. Rattlesnakes were a common summer nuisance; every other week or so, I’d move a prairie rattler from my yard and release it behind the town dump. Antelope and scaled quail came to my fence by day, deer and elk crossed the road by night. I had never lived in a place so full of wild creatures—not just managed species like deer and elk but raptors, songbirds, an ark of reptiles, javelinas, coyotes, three species of foxes, lions, bears, and rumors of wolves.\n\nThat we hunted, just like everybody else, was at first a source of amazement to our neighbors, then a road into the country and new friendships. My partner, who took all things as she found them, had the easier way; that she could ride well didn’t hurt, either. I was solitary and set in my ways, a falconer and bird hunter and naturalist who had a social and aesthetic dislike of such things as deer drives: in short, a bit of a snob, though I didn’t realize it. She had no such problems. Once she got a job on the local paper, reporting on rodeos and fairs and traveling seventy miles to town meetings, there was no holding her back. It wasn’t until after her death that I realized how friendships with western country people transcend even death. Her friends had now become mine.\n\nWe had known a few ranchers together while she was alive. John, a young landowner who lived where he was born, thirty miles south of the pavement, showed up after a cryptic preliminary call with a goshawk on his fist. It was not an imprinted modern falconer’s servant with enough paper on it to license a liquor store, but a wild old bird that had gone through about twenty fifty-dollar fighting-cock chicks before John live-trapped it with a set of monofilament snares and decided to ask the advice of the only falconer in the county, seventy-five miles away. I don’t know who looked more feral that day—John, a pale caballero slumped in my chair wearing denim and snakeskin boots and a black tractor cap, with a raptorial nose and an Okie-sounding twang at odds with his land-grant surname; or the hawk. The gos was an old breeder, a haggard in falconers’ terminology, with eyes that had darkened with age past ruby to garnet. Although he wasn’t much bigger than a pigeon, he was as spooky up close as an uncaged leopard and as elegant as an ancient engraving of death. Except for his eyes and legs he was a study in monochrome, with the black back of the Sierra Madre Apache race, and eyebrows and front of filigreed silver. He gripped John’s work-gloved fist with spidery yellow fingers and watched our every move, but made no attempt to fly.\n\nI was impressed by their cool. Looks like you’ve already got him manned.\n\nI ain’t done much. He’s not stupid.\n\nWhat do you expect to do with him?\n\nI don’t know. Put him back and let him make more, I guess. Seems a shame to keep him. . . .\n\nWhat about your chickens?\n\nHe’s worth fifty damn chickens.\n\nI was amused and a little shocked. Then why’d you catch him?\n\nHe was so neat, I just sort of wanted to see him up close.\n\nA lot of the older ranchers would not have agreed; they were fond of poisons, and shot every rattlesnake. But after Betsy died I began to meet back-country people who shared John’s sentiments. Sis, a matriarch-in-training, heiress apparent to a four-generation ranch established by an Italian Swiss in the 1880s, a team roper, bartender, and community activist, wouldn’t kill a snake, though she always carried a.38. She collected them live for the university, and once sketched for me the crucial difference in labial scale count between the Mojave and western diamondback rattlers on a bar napkin. Her brothers, who ran a guide service and a lion pack but who disliked the sometimes necessary killing of lions, had snapped Polaroids of virtually every local lion, each perched defiantly on a tree or ledge, and could tell them apart by their tracks. Still later I met Windy Will, a slightly older small rancher in the badlands to the north, who read Edward Abbey, grinning and shaking his head (I approve of the sorry-ass son-of-a-bitch at least half the time) and who argued against making a local peak a designated wilderness only because it would then fill up with people from Albuquerque.\n\nSomething that should have been obvious dawned on me slowly. First and foremost, contrary to those who portray ranchers as profit-hungry, greedy exploiters, interested only in squeezing the most out of the land, monsters who somehow manage to combine the worst characteristics of capitalist consumption and welfare abuse: The ranchers love their land.\n\nAll their land, deeded and leased. They, at least those who live on it—that most ranchers are absentee landlords is slander—know every inch of it as well as you know your backyard. (And if you care enough to read these words, I suspect you know your backyard better than 80 percent of the populace.) They’ve ridden over it, lived and died on it. They have stories, song lines: Here’s where Uncle Pancho was shot by those sons-of-bitches in 1918; here’s where the bobcats den; hawk nests up there; here’s where Billy damn near cut his hand off with the chain saw in ’75. Some of them are even good stewards. In time, they have been changed from Europeans with a fear of all that is wild to people who have quirky affection for all those strange things out there: the singing coyotes, dark ominous eagles, invisible mountain lions—all these fellow inhabitants that you have to put up with but that finally make your home a very different place than the suburbs of New York City.\n\nThey also love work, hard work, on that same land. Though not routines. I’ve rarely met happier people than cowboys who have work. Nor ones who hate regular hours more, which may point to one of the reasons ranch folks are hard for outsiders to understand. Urbanites, yuppies, suburbanites, call them what you will: They are all middle class, bourgeois, with jobs and routines from which they escape to an increasingly intricate web of pleasures. Ranchers and cowboys, whether owners or workers, stand outside this twentieth-century structure. They control baronial amounts of land, but their customs and language seem working class to intellectuals. They have the frugality and generosity, the sir-and-ma’am manners of the plain people of the South, from whom their culture descends. They are emotional, contrary to the John Wayne image, and can be moved to tears. But they don’t show their tears to strangers.\n\nA Montana friend pointed toward a real difference between modern and country people. She said that urbanites tend to see all people who work with the soil and nature—farmers and fishermen as well as ranchers and cowboys—as people who are losers in the professional race, people too dumb to be yuppies, people too unintellectual to have real jobs. Because of this, they can be pitied but hardly consulted on important issues. And those who are out there in the employer class must be in it to make money off the land, to rape it as long as they are allowed—why else would anyone live voluntarily in W. H. Auden’s desert full of bigots?\n\nThere is consequence here, all around.\n\nI came to romanticize ranchers a bit, which didn’t much interest them one way or the other. Defending them against a compulsory multiculturalism in which European whites were the new inferior class, I forgot the true lesson of multiculturalism: that we’re all equal, equally fucked, European and Indian and African and Mexican, that even a dog is capable of cruelty, that some sort of original sin exists, that Buddhism demands compassion for a reason. I dreamed of a place where the best of the Old and the New West would come together, where long-haired cowboys and literate tough cowgirls and sensitive hunters would stand together against the exploiters and Californicators, the miners and vegetarians. The wave crested when a ranch couple my own age and I vowed to secede from the larger county and form our own, with guns blazing for ranchers and hunters, readers and rattlesnakes. I started a book on the strength of such euphoria, intending an explanation of ranchers to the coast, a manifesto for environmentally sound ranching, I don’t know what else. It collapsed. Feelings were hurt, money was lost. People for the West, that cynically funded exploiter of legitimate paranoia, claimed my friends. Environmentalist became a swear word, and spotted owls a joke. I wrote a novel, but never sold it.\n\nMy town still looks the same. There is no skiing here, and no blue-ribbon trout water; we’re a hundred miles from the nearest city with jobs. And yet: In the last year we’ve elected a mayor who has lived here three years. Two galleries have opened, both selling southwestern art. There is talk of a leash law, and trash fees; the dump is now routinely referred to as the sanitary landfill, and has hours. You can no longer leave dead animals there. Of course, People for the West is stronger than ever; the bumper sticker of choice is BOBBIT BABBITT.\n\nThe rumor goes like this: A lion stalked a kid from a new family upcanyon. There’s a consensus: Everybody wants to kill it, but the Christians and the new people are most fervent. The new people say they’re reluctant. In the old days the cat might have been killed, but not talked to death by hypocrites. Of course, the lion probably doesn’t care much about the various rationales.\n\nI contemplate moving: Provence, Chihuahua, Thailand. I hear John’s in Belize.\n\nThe old people, the old cultures, knew something about consequence that the new ones don’t. The new ones, both born again and politically correct (two faces of the same coin, or hydra, eerily similar in their self-righteousness), are of course sure they know, surer than the old ones ever are. Luigi Barzini, the Italian journalist, once wrote of such people that they lack the humble skills of men who have to work with lackadaisical unpredictable nature, the skills so to speak of sailors, fishermen, farmers, horsetamers, the people who must at all costs avoid deceiving themselves and must develop prudence, patience, skepticism, resignation, as well as great fortitude and perseverance\n\nWhat the old ones really knew in their bones was that death exists, that all life eats and kills to eat, that all lives end, that energy goes on. They knew that humans are participants, not spectators. Their work and play and rituals affirmed and reinforced this knowledge.\n\nThe new ones all want to evade death and deny it, legislate against it, transcend it. They run, bicycle, network, and pray. They stare into their screens and buy their vitamins. Here, they want the street drunks locked up, cigarettes banned, drunken driving met with more severe penalties than armed assault. They fear guns, cowboys, Muslims, pit bulls, whiskey, homosexuals, and freedom. Strong smells offend them.\n\nIn my town, the new people are disgusted by the matanzas of the old Spanish culture. Who but the Spanish and Mexicans would call a joyous fiesta celebrating pork a matanza, a killing?\n\nThe new ones hate dangerous hard work. Who but a cretin would voluntarily work on horseback, rope cows, unroll miles of barbed wire? Or, for that matter, cut trees, stack bricks, fish out of sight of shore in winter, plow, balance on high steel? They fear solitude and people who don’t babble. When they are alone or silent, thoughts of death or meaninglessness come flooding in. Who would be alone? For this reason, they fear real leisure, and distrust anyone, rich or poor, who has too much.\n\nThey like games but don’t know how to play. They dislike the idea of skills—that anyone might do anything better than anyone else. They distract themselves with endless interchangeable electronic fantasies, none too different or disturbing. Real novels deal with hard things—a woman I once dated told me they were all about dysfunctional families—and must be assimilated in solitude, so nobody reads. They raise their children with Nintendo.\n\nNew people say the word spiritual a lot. They have never looked long into any void. They prefer the Paradise Valley to the Red Desert. They pray for angels, extraterrestrials, the rapture, rescue, intervention. They believe in recovered memories, but have few real ones. They think they are victims, but they are conquerors.\n\nAccording to an article in High Country News, an important regional representative from a national conservation organization said in a meeting in Aspen that the role of environmental groups is to save the Colorado Plateau from the people who live there.\n\nThe new people disapprove of, cannot comprehend, hunting. How could anybody but a sadist cause death voluntarily, again and again? That they also do so escapes their tender consciences and consequence-free brains. Curiously, they allow and even celebrate catch-and-release fly fishing. Some of its practitioners are even what conservation writer Ted Kerasote calls fossil fuel vegetarians. I know a woman who persecuted—not too strong a verb—a fellow worker because he had drawn a sheep permit and backpacked into a remote wilderness peak, then out of it with the head and the meat. She is so devoted to nouveau fishing that she had a beaver dam on her property dynamited. As Dave Barry says, I am not making this up.\n\nThe instinct to hunt, whatever that is, must be strong, else why would a bunch of death denyers spend the budget of a medium-size Third World country on chic equipment for what a colder mind might call fish torture? They think they are innocent, and brag that they do not eat fish. They leave their fingerprints on the river, their footprints on the gravel; many leave uneaten fish floating downstream. The greener among them are merely self-righteous and maybe—to use a phrase I usually don’t—in denial. The more egregious offenders in the same army squeeze whitefish, bash carp, fight returning river habitats to native coarse fish because they prefer brown trout.\n\nI have fly fished since I was four; still do. I tell people that pure catch-and-release is playing without consequence, date rape, politically correct torture for the sentimental. I get some odd looks.\n\nGary Synder says: Life in the wild is not just eating berries in the sunlight. I like to imagine a ‘depth ecology’ that would go to the dark side of nature . . . the ball of crunched bones in the scat, the feather in the snow, the tales of insatiable appetite. Too abstract? He continues: The other side of the ‘sacred’ is the sight of your beloved in the underworld, dripping with maggots. Can you live with the thought of that consequence?\n\nBuddhist hermits, nurses, and cowboys see death as real, horrible, inevitable, necessary, unimportant, and sometimes funny. One night when my partner Betsy was still alive, we got to drinking hard with John and his wife. I believe it was after a cockfight fiesta, and a meal of Burmese-style curry, with cinnamon and chilies and black Chinese mushrooms. Gradually conversation turned to what we later referred to as dead-animal stories . . . absurd deaths, horrible ones, hilarious ones. From there, inevitably, it progressed to human death tales. There was a chill outside the ring around the woodstove, and fire in our bellies. I doubt four people ever laughed harder. There were tears in all our eyes and my sides hurt. I could barely sit in a chair."
