        "text": "Biblio member since 2004\n\nThe Complete Traveller Antiquarian Bookstore grew out of The Complete Traveller Bookstore, the first travel bookstore in the United States. Owners Harriet and Arnold Greenberg were (and are) travel writers and Arnold, a life-long collector of antiquarian books. Many customers have combined their purchases of new guidebooks with editions of older classics. While the largest number of titles in the Antiquarian Bookstore are travel related, our collections include many first editions of fiction and literature, and even some unusual children's books. Those of you who have visited our store have seen one of the country's premier collections of authentic Baedekers. The small red-covered books are considered the first modern travel guides and are treasured for their great historic detail and fold out maps throughout. From the rare \"Indien\" to the prosaic \"Central Italy,\" we have them all. We are proud of our rapidly expanding collection of rare titles dealing with the history, culture, peoples and communities of New York City and New York State. Other specialties include: The A&C Black Twenty Shilling series--books to far-flung destinations that are filled with scores of colorful illustrations. And, the state and city guides of the American Guide Series, a depression-era project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and written by many who later became renowned.\n\nTerms of Sale:\n\nOrders are processed within 3 business days (and most of the time much faster).
