        "text": "Re-reading Italian Americana is a brilliant analysis of the status of Italian American studies in America and Italy, a powerful appraisal of critical works in the field, and a literary feast. Enriched by Tamburri's original and informed commentary on major writers and poets from di Donato to Mazziotti Gillan, it persuasively argues for the importance of Italian Americana in the American literary and cultural canon. Tamburri has written an indispensable book that is required reading for anyone who cares about multiethnic writing in the contemporary scene.\n\n— Josephine Gattuso Hendin, professor of English, New York University\n\nIn this most welcome contribution to the field, Tamburri offers an authoritative, comprehensive, and at times provocative examination of key questions surrounding Italian American Studies. ...This is an important work that has masterfully achieved its goal of teaching us a new way of reading and reconsidering Italian American literature.\n\n— Mark Pietralunga, chair of modern languages and linguistics, Florida State University\n\nDr. Tamburri removes the velo off of Italian-Americana giving a new perspective into its authors and critical writers. He sums them up then gives them a shove. By examining some of our hallowed writers and critics with precision and insight and with an enjoyable and accessible language Re-reading Italian Americana tells us that what we took for granted may no longer be accurate and that it’s time to get tough and redefine the recent past. Re-reading Italian Americana is a must read for anyone interested in learning what the Italian American experience is all about. With new immigrants from different parts of the world making their homes in the United States today Anthony Tamburri’s Re-reading Italian Americana is extremely relevant for what it says about one of the last century’s most contradictory groups to ever be absorbed by the so-called melting pot.\n\n— Richard Vetere, novelist, poet, playwright, film and television writer\n\nA few times--a very few times--in a generation, a work of literary and cultural scholarship, critical analysis, and winning polemic comes along that we confidently describe as a landmark in the field. For many reasons, Re-Reading Italian Americana qualifies for the honor. It is unique in its accessibility of presentation without sacrifice of precision and complexity, and tough in its call for Italian Americans to get involved, stop the cheerleading and sentimentality, and contribute.\n\n— Frank Lentricchia\n\nThe latest addition to the outstanding 'Fairleigh Dickinson University Press Series in Italian Studies', Re-Reading Italian Americana: Specificities and Generalities on Literature and Criticism is a 198 page compendium comprised of eight major literary analyses by Anthony Julian Tamburri that is organized into three sections. The first section deals with the general situation of Italian/American literature and its reception both in the United States and Italy. It also discusses other social and cultural issues that pertain to Italian Americana. Section two (Specificities of Reading Prose) consists of six chapters, each discussing a specific author; three dedicated to prose (Pietro di Donato, Mario Puzo, Luigi Barzini), three dedicated to poetry (Joseph Tusiani, Maria Mazziotti Gillan, Rina Ferrarelli). Section three (Specifications of Reading Poetry) examines the current state of criticism dedicated to Italian/American literature, with the second part focusing in on number of specific works. A work of impressive and meticulous scholarship, Re-reading Italian Americana: Specificities and Generalities on Literature and Criticism is enhanced with the inclusion of an extensive bibliography and a comprehensive index, making it an extraordinary and highly recommended addition to academic library collections. It should be noted that Re-reading Italian Americana: Specificities and Generalities on Literature and Criticism is also available in a Kindle edition.\n\n— Midwest Book Review"
