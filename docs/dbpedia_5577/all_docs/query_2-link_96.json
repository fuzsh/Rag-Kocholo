        "text": "REVIEWED BY TOM VALEO\n\nWhile driving in Naples, Italy, I began to detect a grammar and syntax in the bleating of car horns. A friendly \"toot-toot\" meant \"Look at me; I'm going to cut you off now,\" while three short toots meant \"I'm coming through this intersection full speed and I really wouldn't want to hit you because you didn't see me coming.\" A more persistent \"tooot-tooot-tooot!\" meant \"Hurry up, you idiot!\"\n\nI was not imaging this, according to Beppe Severgnini, author of La Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind.\n\n\"Cars in Italy don't just talk,\" he writes. \"They make comments, insults, protests, insinuations and lectures. They whisper, scream, object, inquire, whine, and express every nuance of human emotion. ... A short, sharp beep means 'I saw that parking space first!' Or 'Wake up! The light just changed!' A longer, disconsolate note wails, 'Who left this car in front of my garage door?' \"\n\nSevergnini also explains a custom that puzzled me on the autostrada, Italy's version of the interstate. Oncoming cars across the grassy divide occasionally would flash their lights at me. They were just warning me, Severgnini writes, that \"a police patrol car is just around the corner. This is one of those rare occasions when Italians, happily hoodwinking the appointed authorities, pull together and show team spirit with total strangers.\"\n\nSevergnini, a columnist for Corriere della Sera of Milan, has written a celebration of the quirks and eccentricities of his compatriots by plotting a 10-day hypothetical trip through the national psyche. He begins with an epigraph by Luigi Barzini, author of The Italians: \"At this point, being honest with oneself is the highest form of patriotism.\"\n\nBut Severgnini's version of honesty includes a comedian's talent for hyperbole.\n\nThe walls in Tuscany, for example, are nothing but \"exposed brick as far as the eye can see,\" he says. \"There are bricks on the churches, bricks on the houses, bricks on the restaurants, and bricks over the restaurants.\" Why, he wonders, do the Tuscans \"deprive walls of plaster's protection?\"\n\nSevergnini concludes that the exposed brick reveals the Italian desire to indulge visitors' fantasies about Italy. \"We offer a Tuscany of the mind,\" he says. \"These days we are the world's leading manufacturers of emotions. Perhaps we should apply for a patent, and bottle them.\"\n\nSevergnini does not mock his beloved homeland. On the contrary, his breezy, flippant style reveals a deep affection for Italy and the perplexing tendencies of its people.\n\nIn The Italians, published in 1964, Barzini tried to see into the depths of the Italian psyche. By placing the Barzini quote at the front of his own book, Severgnini implies that he, too, wants to strip away all pretense and reveal the truth about Italians.\n\nInstead, he seems hopelessly dazzled by what the Italians call la bella figura, the thin, attractive veneer that covers up problems below. Like an exuberant ringmaster, Severgnini points to the amazing performances that make up the Italian circus, but he has no idea, really, how the show works.\n\nTom Valeo is a freelance writer based in St. Petersburg.\n\nTHE BOOK\n\nLa Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind\n\nBy Beppe Severgnini\n\nBroadway, 240 pages, $23.95"
