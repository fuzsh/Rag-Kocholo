Although written in a white heat, this book took more than a decade to germinate. Along the way, I have learned a great deal from those who have not shared my enthusiasm for Italian stuff, a great deal from those who have shared my enthusiasms for other kinds of stuff, and a great deal from those who have shared with me their enthusiasms for all kinds of other stuff. Also, Italians have long memories. Which makes writing acknowledgments an impossible task. So let me dispense with my continuing education and call the roll of those who have engaged me on matters expressly Italian. At Amherst College, Eric Siebert put Sinatra records on our turntable, George Birdsong came over to listen. The American Studies faculty taught Urban Villagers. Allen Guttman quietly cautioned me about antiCatholicism in the old-line academy; several others—Jack Cameron, Barry O’Connell, and Mary Gordon—modeled ways of finessing it; many others—especially David Wills, Dale Peterson, Robert Gross, and Laura Wexler—helped me find my way. In graduate school at Yale University, Jean-Christophe Agnew told me I’d like Mario Puzo’s The Fortunate Pilgrim; Alan Trachtenberg supervised my forays into immigrant history and ethnicity theory; Richard H. Brodhead coached a dissertation in a subfield—immigrant and multicultural literature—that didn’t yet exist. One hot summer, John McLucas and Antonella di Napoli taught me intensive Italian; Matt Munich, fourteen-year-old opera buff, shared the intensity. Gary Garibaldi, head of Local 34 and a New Haven visionary, sat me at his family table for Sunday dinners. Werner Sollors talked shop along Mary Antin’s route through East Boston, encouraging and soon publishing my first Godfather essay. Bill Boelhower relayed good work and kind words from Italy; Jules Chametzky and Donald Weber did too, from those Pioneer Valley schools I adored. Reva Siegel and Raoul Ibarguen taped Madonna videos and turned Springsteen concerts into pilgrimages; Tara Fitzpatrick schooled me in Long Island Catholicisms. Joe Skerrett Jr. hosted my first MLA panel, Robert Viscusi attended. xi\n\nxii\n\nacknowledgments\n\nWerner Sollors unpacked di Donato’s sociology, Mangione’s anthropology; John Lowe went after the humor. In Geneva (where “Euro culture” was already taking shaping unbeknownst to itself, in Switzerland of all places), André Kaenel and Jay Blair asked me, more times than they probably care to remember, why? Corinne Boccard, with a greengrocer for a father and a jazz-loving Italian for a boyfriend, didn’t have to. Shortly after I returned to the States, Emory Elliott asked me for an overview of early immigrant literature; Frank Lentricchia, a comrade in close reading and movie screening, invited me to write on White Noise. Alan Thomas wanted cover art for my first book, Ethnic Passages: I found “Telegraph Pole” in an obscure corner of the Stella archive; Randy Petillos secured permission from the Potamkins to use it; Richard Rodriguez sent me a congratulatory note, saying “What a beautiful cover.” Art Casciato, writing on di Donato, wanted to hear more about Puzo. Maurice Wallace, then a graduate student, connected Do the Right Thing to Puzo’s political economy. Vincent Peterson shared his Brooklyn borderlands and kept me posted on the arts of crossing over. James T. Fisher, Paul Giles, Mary Gordon, and Robert Orsi drafted original essays for Catholic Lives, Contemporary America that would prove ethnically relevant; Camille Paglia talked about Catholic tendencies, letting me write it all down; Paula Kane, Sandra Mize, Paul Crowley, and Scott Appleby debated the results. John Paul Russo at Italian-Americana coaxed reviews from me. Pellegrino D’Acierno invited an encyclopedia essay for The Italian American Heritage and a performance piece on “urbanity at the end of the millennium” (the latter got me thinking about Spike Lee again). Anthony Tamburri slipped me copies of his anti-hyphenation polemic and a Madonna video compilation. The NEH awarded a summer grant to work on Joseph Stella, enabling me to work with curators and plot with old friends at Yale, the Whitney, the Met, and the Newark Museum. At Mario Mignone’s invitation, I visited SUNY/Stony Brook to discuss the future of Italian American Studies. Paula Marantz Cohen masterminded Sinatra’s first appearance at the MLA, and Hofstra University sponsored an entire conference, both of which were splendiferous. Stanislao Pugliese shepherded the Hofstra papers into print. Alane Salierno Mason and Helen Barolini sent me their good books. John Gennari proved to be a man after my own African Italian heart, and he got\n\nacknowledgments\n\nme together with that other city slicker, Carlo Rotella. When Tina Klein revealed Nancy Kwan in Flower Drum Song, images of Madonna danced in my head. Frank Lentricchia shared an Italian American fiction anthology he assembled in the 1970s, when all the publishers would say was no. Peter W. Williams asked me to conjure up another encyclopedia essay; Jay Parini did, too. Rafael Pérez-Torres’s idea for a volume on post-ethnic America recalled Big Night to consciousness; Michael Gorra then quizzed me, isn’t passing for Italian in the movies “just acting”? Susan Mizruchi prompted my first extended venture into Italianizing Catholic Studies. Laura Wexler, Stanley Hauerwas, and Lucy Maddox liked “Lorenzo’s Chrism” enough to show it around; Frank Lentricchia, enough to publish it in a special issue of SAQ; Grant Farred, enough to chew me out for not producing more. Fred Gardaphé and Mary Jo Bona arranged another performance panel, “Stereotypes, Schmereotypes,” before which Gardaphé chuckled, “Just be yourself.” Sante Matteo invited me to an Italian American Studies Symposium, where Rebecca West and Ben Lawton discussed Italian film, Art Casciato and Paul Giordano spoke to identity myopia, and Sante shared his students with us. Of special note is the opportunity Gordon Hutner provided to give three of my boys—Stella, Sinatra, and Puzo—a public hearing, at an ALH symposium, where Ann DuCille laughed in just the right way at my experimental diction (which meant more to me than she could possibly know), and where Mitch Breitwieser, José David Saldivar, and Jonathan Freedman told me, “You’ve just got to see The Sopranos.” Back in Durham, Jim Applewhite averred, “It’s art, man; it’s really art.” In the meantime, Werner Sollors was getting ideas: how would I like to write a book on “Italian Americans in the Age of Cultural Studies”? My home institution, the English and related departments of Duke University, made answering Sollors’s call possible, encouraging risk while demanding rigor. Barbara Herrnstein Smith plucked my letter of application (with all its talk of Puzo and Yezierska) out of a stack of late arrivals. Melissa Malouf shared with me her short stories on Italian America; Marianna Torgovnick, Crossing Ocean Parkway; Frank Lentricchia, The Edge of Night and the ensuing novels. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick got me thinking queer and Catholic together. Cathy Davidson gave me detailed feedback when I first started thinking about Sinatra; Houston Baker, when I starting writing again on film; Michael Moses,\n\nxiii\n\nxiv\n\nacknowledgments\n\nSarah Beckwith, Ian Baucom, and Thomas Pfau, when I first started thinking about Stella. Roberto Dainotto proposed bringing Italian American Studies to Duke with me. Priscilla Wald applauded an early draft of chapter 10, “Cine Cucina”—the cornerstone, as destiny would have it, for what lay ahead—when others did not. Two classrooms full of undergraduates entertained my first efforts to constellate the Italian American arts; Jeremy Rossman, whose grandmother once met Springsteen and didn’t even know it, got the picture; so did Phil Tinari. Jinan Joudeh insisted I put the word out, and her father, who came to Italian cooking the hard way, showed why. I’ve excused graduate students from having to grant me formal indulgences for my Italian thing, but many of them recently—Suzanne Schneider, Caleb Smith, Alex Feerst, Nihad Farooq, Jené Lee Schoenfeld, Vin Nardizzi, Adam Haile, Melinda DiStefano, and Kinohi Nishikawa—have been solicitous, anyway. John Hilgart and Lisa Naomi Mulman, among others, remember when. Dean Karla Holloway granted me smiles of real encouragement—and a research budget. Marianna Torgovnick gave the finished manuscript a warm nod of Brooklynite self-recognition; Janice Radway and Joseph A. Porter took it under wing, too. My chair, Maureen Quilligan, kept committee assignments at bay and shared, on a daily basis, the joy of learning from students. Catherine Beaver and her staff expedited as needed, taking my ethnic excitability in stride. My colleagues—every single one of you!—have made the workaday world an education and a pleasure. Intellectual life depends on associated community, and you are my home association. Werner Sollors, my once and future padrino, gave the entire draft a very timely once over, spotting both linguistic miscues and opportunities to cross-reference, urging that I make the architecture more apparent (“You’ve given us one archetype per chapter”), and challenging me to make the last remaining chapter pertinent to the book’s religious issues. Matthew Jacobson, master historian and kindred spirit, kept me chronologically focused and factually honest, with the academic landscape (“What does Cultural Studies have to do with it?”) in front of me. Together, they cottoned on to the vision and pushed for clarity. Casey Jarrin, who once brought Gentlemen Prefer Blondes to a graduate class, was my first sounding board for the artwork. Vamshi Reddy did leg work\n\nacknowledgments\n\nfor one cover idea. Then a photograph from A. Kenneth Ciongoli and Jay Parini’s Passage to Liberty caught my eye, and the book’s spirit. From the beginning, Eric Zinner, my editor at New York University Press, thought that many short chapters just might work, but knew to warn against both repetition and discontinuity. At the end, he held me to standards of public communication, inspiring several eleventh-hour chapter revisions and a more expansive conclusion; it was a pleasure to be taught so cogently and efficiently, often by only a few phrases. His assistant, Emily Park, guided both the manuscript and me through the NYU paces, exchanging pointers on the cover. Despina Papazolgou Gimbel saw the manuscript through production in style, marshalling me with uncanny grace. Nicholas Taylor copyedited unobtrusively, taking me at my word. NIAF awarded Feeling Italian a Culture and Heritage Grant, in support of promotion beyond standard academic venues. Beth Eastlick, ideal combination of enthusiast and skeptic, read every word I wrote, and let me keep some of them. Tony Ferraro and Dani Ferraro bugged me to get off the computer. My parents afforded the family periodic escapes to the beach. Many moons ago, the late great R. W. B. Lewis told me: “If you had any balls, you’d write the whole damn thing on Puzo.” Here it is, Mr. Lewis, the next best thing: a whole book—a whole book!—on the artistry of Italian America. A modest portion of chapter 5 has been published in two different forms: Thomas J. Ferraro, “‘My Way’ in ‘Our America’: Art, Ethnicity, Profession,” ALH 12 (Fall 2000), 506–11; and Thomas J. Ferraro, “Urbane Villager,” in Frank Sinatra: History, Identity, and Italian American Culture, ed. Stanislao Pugliese (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), 135–46.\n\nxv\n\nIntroduction Feeling Italian Just when I thought I was out they pull me back in. —Michael Corleone, 1990\n\nOne would think, on the face of it, that the Italian Americans whose ancestors came to the United States en masse a full century ago must be coming to the end of their social and cultural distinctiveness. Blue-collar foundations that were once taken for granted have finally waned; the fourth and fifth generations are dispersing into the suburbs and across the country; and long-cultivated bloodlines are being diluted by intermarriage and alternative arrangements, with lovely results. We also know that the cultural baton and ethical highground have been passed to immigrants of color, that the Internet enables the incessant reinvention of personal and group identity on a surreal scale, and that the good ol’ melting pot has made a hearty comeback in the form of mestiza hybridity, fusion cuisine, and global sampling. Surely the social historians are right, then: Italian Americans must be at the twilight of their ethnicity. So how come HBO’s The Sopranos has caught everyone by the throat? Feeling Italian: The Art of Ethnicity in America is not an attempt to turn the clock back, to think of white ethnicity in 1970s terms, as an issue of “us” versus “them.” It is not about the Italian American community frozen in time but rather about the century-long, often wondrous, at times discordant, Italianate remaking of the United States. Feeling Italian is written after the shift from industrial manufacturing to the postindustrial service economy and the concomitant flight from the inner city to the suburbs have undercut classic blue-collar values and pressures; 1\n\n2\n\nintroduction\n\nafter the barriers to the power professions have come tumbling down, with people of Italian descent in positions of authority everywhere and biased access no longer an excuse for lowered expectations; and, of course, after the discourse of multiculturalism has taken the great leap forward, from an activist counterculture and “we are minorities, too” attitude to the new—diversity-obsessed, yet strangely abstract—orthodoxy. With change has come obligation and opportunity. I have chosen to foreground artifacts—books, movies, paintings, recordings, video—in part because they hold attention and insert themselves in memory more easily than historical data and sociological precepts. But I have foregrounded artifacts also because it is my belief that aesthetic media, especially quality media, have been integral to the persistence and dissemination, transformation and recovery, of Italianate sensibilities beyond their regional class base and family confines, and at no time more so than in our own: postindustrial, postmodern, and, in some ways, post-ethnic. It is through art and, increasingly, in the wake of the fourth generation, only through art that we come to know and to deal with what it means to feel Italian still in America. Who are Italian Americans today, in the age of political correctness and virtual reality, after the so-called twilight of ethnicity? How did they get this way? What patterns or structures of feeling are demonstrably Italian? Which ones become recognized as such, and which do not? Where does the idea of “feeling Italian,” as itself a structure of feeling, come from? How has Italian-derived culture impacted, even permeated, the U.S. mainstream? What remains recognizably different about Italian forms of Americanness, different in truth as well as in perception? And what is it about the Italian American difference that makes it so appealing to non-Italians? Why, in short, does American Italianness matter in a post-ethnic, gender-liberated, transnational, racially utopian United States? The purpose of this book is to answer these questions by proposition and, more importantly, by example: to examine the evolution and persistence of Italian Americanness; how it developed from Southern Italian dislocation and increasing intergroup contact/mobility; how it has influenced the nation at large even when we don’t quite sanction its influence, understand its operation, or recognize its origins; and why as a subculture, real and imagined, real because imagined, it continues to exercise\n\nintroduction\n\nsuch an appeal both to those who immediately identify with it and to those who think of themselves as strictly outsiders to it.1 My title is evocative and multivalent. The pun in Feeling Italian harbors a double meaning: to “feel like an Italian” means, first, to feel the way Italians feel, to have Italian or Italianate types of feelings, whether recognized or not; and, second, to feel that one’s identity is Italian or Italian-like, no matter the ancestry. The phrase invokes cultural continuity over distance and across time, including the mystique of such continuity, without relying on credentials of blood: so formulated, “feeling Italian” opens up the ranks (you don’t have to be one to feel like one) and beats back both the authenticity police and the determined de-essentializers —this feeling of Italianness was made in America from cultural formations that arose in Italy. But this structure of “feeling Italian” does not surrender the claim to distinctiveness. I know there’s a loose-jointedness to the concept; that’s the idea. It’s an aesthetic, really: the play of ambiguity across the identity line, done well, is the art of feeling Italian in America. The peasants who migrated to the United States from south and east of Naples, first as transient labor, then as proletarianized settlers, knew themselves not as Italians but as members of a particular family, perhaps a town, at most (after arrival) a dialect-defined region, but nothing more. Italia, the newly emergent nation-state of Italy, its government, its declared cultural capital of Florence and its Church operations in Rome, its rallying cries for unification and economic incorporation, they distrusted, even despised. It was not until they had dealt with nativist suspicion and wonder in the United States, so new (ethnically hostile priests, health crusaders, cartoonists drawing them as monkeys) yet so familiar (Sicilians were called Africans in Italy), did they think of themselves as a unit, and it was not until they had committed to stay and acclimated to the urban working classes did they feel they were, in truth, Italians—Italians of an American stripe, Italian Americans. But of course that identity, however emergent, wasn’t merely relational: it reflected and reinflected folkways and folk desires shared across Southern Italy, whatever their differences (Calabrians more stubborn than Neapolitans? go figure), then brought to bear upon life in the United States, the medium of social aggregation and cultural convergence. Italian-like feelings were turned into the feeling of being an Italian: this is a historical dialectic of\n\n3\n\n4\n\nintroduction\n\nrepresentation and self-representation, yes, but it was lived in the blood, the flesh, the soul. From the beginning, the media mattered as a site of American projection and guarded Italian response. But it was not until after World War II, at the very moment when European-descent ethnicity was supposed to have disappeared into the convenient mists of whiteness, that the first offspring of the Italians entered the national limelight in notable numbers, reanimating the Italian mystique. And it was not until the 1970s and 1980s, in the wake of the rise of the new ethnicity, the diversity mania of multicultural chic, that Italian Americans by the score claimed the center stage of American culture as their own, especially the movie screen, where they vied with each other and with the national iconography machines. Reciprocal reinvention was at work, with paradoxical results: even as those of Italian descent took the national discourse more and more into their own creative hands, remaking America, so too those of Italian descent knew themselves more and more through how the paesans acted in the public eye and how they were portrayed in the media, the popular arts especially. Italian American self-understanding and the portrayal of Italians in American culture at large, then, moved closer together, to the point where the feelings Italian Americans have for themselves, the feelings non-Italians have for Italian Americans, and the feelings they both have for the role of Italianness in America intertwine and interpenetrate: almost—but not quite!—one. What is peculiar about this convergence, the faultlines notwithstanding, is how little it has worried individual Italian Americans, especially outside the sphere of organized professionals. They have experienced very little angst, fretting neither about their own authenticity nor the province of others in trying to define what is really Italian nor the claim of others to actually embody it. When need be, they simply ignore the cheap counterfeits (the accordion-dialect cafone songs, the pizza and pasta chains, those really bad mafia flicks); more often than not, they are charmed, even enlightened; and, sometimes, exalted. There are reasons for this, this feeling of being okay and even more-than-okay with massmediated Italianness, and these reasons go back to the beginning, to the culture of Southern Italy and its transatlantic relocation, to that cluster of feelings we have no choice but to label as Italian. I want to trace that\n\nintroduction\n\norigin, these evolutions, to be a good historian, to look backward so as to look forward; but most of all, I want to visit the charm, the illumination, the exultation. This book has issues, but even more than that, it has mysteries. Who was the seamstress Maria Barbella? What did she do to become the most famous—nay, the most notorious—immigrant in the United States of 1895, and why have we forgotten her? How did Giuseppe “Beppino” Stella, an émigré from the backcountry hills of Basilicata, become America’s premier painter of the industrial cityscape, and what was it about the utter medievalness of the rural Mediterranean that proved to be so far-sighted? What was happening meanwhile behind the scenes, at the jobsite, where peasant laborers were building—literally—the new urban world: a bloody sacrifice on the cross of capitalist exploitation; this we know, but what else? And who were the immigrant matriarchs of so much lore, everyone’s Donna Rosa, who lorded it over their broods at home in the tenements then, and who somehow still command our sense of female possibility, even in the professional ranks? The ghost of the immigrant matriarch in the newly Italianized boardroom may be a bit uncanny, taking one to know one, but some puzzles from the past continue to weigh more obviously upon us. What in the 1950s made Francis Albert Sinatra (whose early handlers wanted to rechristen him “Frankie Satin”) Sinatra, and why does that attitude still matter? How did The Godfather get under our skin, circa 1970; and why can’t we—thirty-plus years later, in the era of the Russian and Columbian mobs, anti-Arab profiling, and Internet paranoia—let our Sicilian bloodbrothers go? Haven’t the guineas finally gotten white, at times in the worst possible ways; and don’t we—thanks to Spike Lee—know it? Sure, Madonna never stops talking about her background—“Italians Do It Better”—just like Sinatra, but what could “Italianness” mean in Madonna’s case, when her Girlie Show is never the same thing twice, so gleefully rebellious, so inventively chameleon-like, with any ethnicity (yo, any culture or history) fair game for her costume dramas, her artistic poaching? Is there, moreover, anything to be learned from today’s mass-mediated Italian American Lite—the films of romantic comedy central like Moonstruck and My Cousin Vinny, even Prizzi’s Honor or Big Night—beyond the fact that stock ethnic schlock will fool most of\n\n5\n\n6\n\nintroduction\n\nthe people most of the time? And what in the world do the prejudice police have to complain about, if what Italian Americans invent when left to their own devices—in this case, an entire crew of producers, actors, and writers, heavily Italian or veritable converts, working on spec out of the network spotlight—is a comic opera of sublime intelligence, The Sopranos? These are the questions I pursue, a taste of what is to come. My ambition for this book is not coverage, but something else: ten case studies at the intersection of culture, idiom, and artifact, which, taken together, present a history (not the entire history by any means, but a formidable pathway through it) of Italian America: Italian America in its own terms, as it has made and found itself to be. Each chapter offers a sustained, concentrated meditation on a single Italian American image, each subject vexèd, each text magical. The determination here is to analyze ethnicityin-transition, warts and all, but also to mediate it, to play it up and run with it. Underneath the scholar’s imperative you will feel, therefore, a pulse of affirmation and affection, with special confidence in art’s darker truths, including ethnic self-damnation. Throughout I look from past to present to see how we’ve gotten here from there; that’s my primary responsibility, but I can’t help insinuating, as arranger Quincy Jones did for Sinatra on the brink: “The Best Is Yet to Come.” Italian American cultural production is one of the intellectual community’s better-kept secrets. One book can only do so much to put the word out, and there are major figures, major texts, and major constellations not considered here: I don’t discuss the 1891 New Orleans lynching or the Sacco-Vanzetti affair; the politicians like LaGuardia, Cuomo, or Ferraro; the original Rockys, Joey D. or Yogi or Roy Campanella (the great Brooklyn Dodgers catcher who helped Jackie Robinson to break in, and whom we tend to forget was half Italian), Coach Lombardi or Franco Harris (half Italian, too). I don’t discuss early Italian theater and vaudeville, the graphic artists, animators, and architects (like Robert Venturi); grand opera, both nationally and regionally (Italians passing for Spanish in the Southwest); the vast number of instrumentalists, in jazz especially (composers, too); or the “assimilated” filmmakers of the golden age of Hollywood, Frank Capra and Vincente Minnelli; plus all those actors and actresses, beginning with Valentino. There’s more liter-\n\nintroduction\n\nature, too: the return-to-Italy tales, women’s writing (what ever happened to Octavia Waldo?), poetry; and the postmoderns—including guerilla critics Camille Paglia and Frank Lentricchia, from whose fierce autonomy I have taken heart. So much great stuff, and so much of it barely touched!2 This book is, then, an introduction to Italian ways of feeling and ways of feeling Italian in the United States, both historical and contemporary, that arise from the usual suspects—family values, prejudice both without and within, and stepped economic mobility, which the new social history and ethnic sociology can help us to read—only to carry us into ongoing issues of habit and mind that, however stereotypical (as criminal, urbanite, lover, gourmand, aesthete, neo-racist, or prima donna), continue to escape scholarly notice, intellectual understanding, and theoretical incorporation. I am especially interested in pursuing the interplay between ethos (lived values) and ethnos (sense of belonging) in our age of transnationalism. On the one side of the dialectic is a highly particular version of Catholicism (paganish, domesticated, sensualized), in which it is first the extended family and later the intersections among food, sex, and art that make for shadow faith. On the other side are certain globalizing presentations of that sensibility, in which feeling Italian is not by birthright so much as it is by choice, a map for educating desire and (re)conceiving relatedness. The two sides of the dialectic —the secularizing of Catholicism among the Italians versus the Italian Catholicizing of secular America—come together not as a righteous xenophobia, the guido-style parochialism of which we have had more than enough, but as a demanding, even consequential mode of culturebased cohesion: acting Italian, finally, as an art for America. This book offers a dramatic account of an earthy, sensuous, sardonic people: those people, the Italians of both distant history and recent vintage in the United States, but also the rest of us, readers and watchers and thinkers at large, who so identify when and how we can, most often through the media arts. This book is for each and every one of us, the democratic way, who has always wanted to be the hero of every story we care about (especially if the heroine is an underdog!), and who therefore already has a sense of what it feels like to be a paesan in America. In this kind of cultural studies, reconstructive rather than deconstructive,\n\n7\n\n8\n\nintroduction\n\nharnessing thought to people rather than people to thought, I begin at the beginning, assuming what must be assumed, with the incontrovertible facts of lived history and marginal folkways. But in the affect I identify, in the artifice I examine, and in the effect I wish to stimulate, I pursue the other side of the ethnicity dialectic: the allure of storied difference. Feeling Italian, then. If only in your dreams.\n\nchapter\n\n1\n\nHonor Friday Bloody Friday A woman knows the cost of a life better than a man does. —Elizabeth Cady Stanton, 1895\n\nThe southern Italian peasants who came to the United States during the Great Migration (1880–1917), first as sojourners, later as settlers, to help build and run the industrial cities, were the proudest of peoples. Having suffered for centuries at the hands of the landowners and the governmental authorities and the Church, the weather and the gods, they had long before established distinctive ways of making do and of making sense: the mother-centered order of the family for all practical intents and purposes, the Virgin for the expression of hope and the renewal of courage, the cult of Honor for communal intrigue and masculine self-esteem. They were ferocious realists who understood where power lay and why it was wielded, but they would have hated—hated—to be considered anyone’s victim. I begin, then, with a story about a common laborer from the darkest era in Italian American history—the first era, that of arrival. Yet it is, in their spirit, a story not of backbreaking work and studied isolation unto death, a commonplace narrative, but of a curious victory or rather, to be more precise, a series of victories, in their earliest dealings with official America: victories so improbable—paradoxical in how they occurred, contrary in their implications, yet wondrous for all of that—that they feel like acts of grace. At the end of the nineteenth century, America was actively seeking cheap labor—expandable, expendable labor—for its booming industries and burgeoning cities. Italian peasants, some with skills in the 9\n\n10\n\nhonor\n\nconstruction or extraction or hand trades, most just farm workers with strong backs and tough constitutions, answered the call, upwards to three hundred thousand a year.1 The vast majority came from the notoriously backward regions of rugged Italy, especially the Mezzogiorno, the area south and east of Naples, where—as classic rumor has it—the hill-town people are so suspicious of outsiders and so tight with one another they refuse to give a stranger directions. What these emigrants wanted was the opportunity for the first time ever to escape hunger and degradation; their American Dream was the (not so) simple transformation of penny wages into saved dollars. A significant proportion, at least the majority, settled in the industrial Northeast, where they worked and lived together in conspicuous concentrations in the toughest city neighborhoods, including Hell’s Kitchen, East Harlem, and the Lower East Side of New York.2 Feeling Italian in America began, I believe, as a function of the original urban ghetto, especially its breakdown. The Italian colony, as it was first termed, was built in accordance with ancient habits (la via vecchia, including fierce familialism, low expectations, and distrust of authority) and new necessities (including chain migration, language barriers, and restricted housing). Its insularity caused as much alarm among the majority of established Americans who disdained contact with others as among the small minority who welcomed it. And, most importantly for our purposes, cracks appeared in those symbolic ghetto walls almost the instant they were raised. Feeling Italian in America began, then, in the contact zone of mutual Italian/American (re)construction, as a founding interplay between how the immigrants understood their new country and what the citizens at large thought of them, when the hermetic seal of Southern Italian culture cracked itself open to external inspection. Why did the Italians come all the way to the United States only to cling so fanatically to themselves? How, nonetheless, did their private lives and communal doings become the focus of widespread curiosity and national concern? When such affairs spilled into the public sphere, what happened? Was it the case, as latter-day defensive thinking would have it, that these aliens, these foreigners, these racialized others were screwed from the very start? Or were there ways and means—once recognized only to themselves—to take advantage of America’s special conditions, even when (perhaps especially when) their backs were to the wall? And, if so, how can we possibly now know?\n\nhonor\n\nOn July 17, 1895, an illiterate seamstress in Lower Manhattan by the name of Maria Barbella became the first woman in the world to be sentenced to die in the electric chair. At the time the basic circumstances of the case suggested she had been used, abused, and hung out to dry several times over. But the case did not turn out as anyone could have reasonably predicted, and sixteen months later, after an extended sojourn in Sing Sing Prison and an O. J. Simpson–style retrial, Barbella was, amazingly, set free. Until a decade ago, no one in the United States, not even the professional historians of immigration and the female proletariat, had ever heard of Barbella, but we now know most of what transpired, thanks to painstaking research by Idanna Pucci, an anthropological filmmaker and author from Italy. Pucci’s The Trials of Maria Barbella is a sobering reminder of anti-Italian prejudice, of course, but it is much more than that.3 Pucci researched for ten years like a woman possessed. She not only had the tenacity to persist against all odds, turning up court transcripts, the trial appeal, all kinds of letters from various interlocutors, Il Progresso Italo-Americano for 1896, and of course the voluminous Englishlanguage newspaper and magazine archive, but she also had the patience, skill, and sensibility to shape the myriad pieces of the public record into what is, in effect, a documentary novel. In its overall architecture, The Trials of Maria Barbella preserves the ambiguity of the archive, as Pucci lets the materials speak in their contrary complexity, and she invites the reader to share in the intrigue of deciphering the historical record, with subtle pointers to Pucci’s own investigative suspense. In what follows, I attend to what Pucci seems to be saying sotto voce, and I do so with increasing urgency because what I hear there, under Pucci’s breath, reminds us that the good stuff is never neat, never nice. Ultimately at issue in The Trials of Maria Barbella is, I believe, a mystery dance between political correctness and lived history—that is, between the contemporary intellectual mandate to unearth how Southern Italians were once racially denigrated and systematically mistreated, which is true, and the transatlantic Italian appetite for ascertaining illicit sexuality, exacting just revenge, and crediting divine intercession, which is even more true.4\n\nAt 9:45 a.m. on Friday, April 26, 1895, Maria Barbella came out of the Tavolacci Bar at 428 East Thirteenth Street with her body wholly\n\n11\n\n12\n\nhonor\n\nunscathed, her heart and mind under great duress but not permanently destroyed, and the better part of her dignity reinstated. Left dying on the bar floor behind her was the bootblack, Domenico Cataldo, whom Maria, a long-sheltered naif, understood to be her fiancé, the love of her life, but who was in fact by all accounts (including his own) an unconscionable exploiter of vulnerable women—the sort of man the immigrants used to call a Lothario, the kind we would call a stalker, a dealer in false pretenses, and a serial date rapist. Maria said, “Me take his blood so he no take mine. Say me pig marry.” Only pigs marry! is what Maria actually heard, in regional Italian dialect. It was romantic misadventure turned dramatically violent, and as such a scenario more familiar from village legend than from fact. The scene of the crime was New York’s infamous Little Italy, the Five Points district of Lower Manhattan, which housed a dense concentration of unskilled and semi-skilled Italian laborers, the majority of them adult males living under penurious contract in stable-like conditions. The protagonists came from neighboring hill towns in the very worst part of Southern Italy, the mountainous anklebone called Lucania or Basilicata, a place ravaged forever by climate and outsiders and history itself. Banished to Basilicata in 1935, Carlo Levi found a world of exploitation and alienation older than communal memory and harsher than humane measure: “No one has come to this land except as an enemy, a conqueror, or a visitor devoid of understanding.”5 It was a land of the most stubborn poverty (la miseria) where either you suffered terribly all life long (many died young) or took leave of your history, most often to go to America.6 Idanna Pucci reports that when the Barbellas came to rent a standardissue airless railroad apartment at 136 Mott Street, they might as well have still been in Basilicata. Well, yes and no. On the one hand, the immigrants of lower Mott Street, all from the region, speaking variants of the same dialect, had transplanted the most intense elements of their long-evolved culture. Christ was on the altar but Mary was worshiped; women made the ultimate decisions because they did the hardest work; and people owned nothing to speak of but what they could speak of, that is, communal lore and individual fantasy.7 The worship of Mary was a strange exultation of Virginity-cum-Fertility, which translated, in practice, to a woman’s chastity-before-marriage and motherhood afterward being a matter of Honor for all the family, especially the men—who had\n\nhonor\n\nso much time on their hands, unemployed, unemployable, without political franchise, with so little to be proud of, so little to contest. The immigrants brought their Honor cult with them, but circumstances had changed. In Basilicata, there was no place without prying eyes, and an unmarried woman, especially a young unmarried woman, would never be left alone. In Basilicata, to claim sexual conquest was a ubiquitous form of male braggadocio, offering solace while resisting proof. In New York City, Domenico Cataldo took advantage of the jam-packed Lower East Side—young women walking unescorted and beyond familiar eyes a fair distance to and from work, ubiquitous barcafés admitting women where drinks could be doctored, and very cheap apartments available at a moment’s notice—to make good on what in Italy was, for logistical reasons, mostly just talk. Maria Barbella was a chaste dutiful daughter of the old school who had never had a suitor and who worked ten hours a day, six days a week, for minuscule wages, taking piecework home at night and bringing her check to her parents, unopened. In November 1893, when the two first talked on the street, Cataldo was nearing thirty years of age and had been in New York long enough to have put almost a thousand dollars in the bank, to the immigrants a prodigious sum; Maria admitted to having just turned twenty and to having arrived only eleven months before— during which time she had done nothing but work, seen nothing but the sweatshop, nor conversed with anyone beyond their tenement stoop. Heartlessly and stealthily Cataldo pursued Maria, while refusing to meet her family as custom prescribed and the Barbellas demanded. To elude Cataldo, Maria changed walking routes, then switched sweatshops, but he found her again months later, and eventually his charm melted away some of her traditional resolve. It is unclear how exactly they came to lie down together, but when she awoke that first morning in Cataldo’s apartment, Maria knew that her father would not let her step across the threshold into the family’s fifth-floor walk-up until and unless she were properly married. Maria had dishonored herself and thus the family, which were, to people from the south of Italy, the same thing. It took truly dreadful immediate circumstances—a sudden forty degree rise in heat late on the afternoon of April 25 to an unprecedented ninety degrees, ten hours of handling rough wool in a suffocating sweatshop, sexual brutality following Cataldo’s middle-of-the-night return\n\n13\n\n14\n\nhonor\n\nhome, and his morning declaration that he was returning to Italy—to bring the relation to a fever pitch of violence; but Cataldo had, as the local Italians understood it, given Maria no choice. For over a month, he had resolutely refused to marry her, and a young Italian woman scomunicata 8 from her family was nowhere and nothing. There was only one way to get her honor back. The neighbors on Mott Street mourned with the family when Maria was taken to jail, though most assumed Maria was responsible and the killing justified. To the Italian vice-consul, it was surprising only that a member of Maria’s family hadn’t already done the deed. There was no proof, however, that Maria had actually intended to kill Cataldo, whom she seemed genuinely to have loved and, in her posttraumatic daze, often spoke of in the present tense. She only wanted, as she put it, to draw blood—which would bring the pair before the American authorities, whom Maria seemed to think would hold Cataldo to his promise of marriage. So not only was it part human tragedy, part minor miracle that the diminutive Maria had, in fact, killed Cataldo, who was much stockier and stronger, but there was something providential in the truly mysterious manner of the death, which allowed Maria to walk a precarious ethical and psychological line. Maria had satisfied the oldworld criterion of the vendetta. At the same time she could tell herself that she had only intended to enforce Cataldo’s promise of marriage— which satisfied the new-world ideal of a love match. Maria seemed as well truly not to remember exactly what happened in the bar, which was, as we shall see, a boon in itself. Cataldo’s throat had been cut. The weapon, which Maria had taken from their makeshift bureau, was an old-fashioned straight-edged razor, altogether too evocative of the long thin knife called a stiletto that had already entered English parlance as a sensationalistic stand-in for the immigrants themselves. I don’t think we can underestimate the symbolism of that straight-edge, anymore that we can underestimate the prejudices triggered by the combination of occupations (bootblack and seamstress), extramarital domestic discord, a seedy bar, card playing, emotion-driven violence, and—of course—the psychosocial overinvestment in the idea of Honor itself. In the America of 1895, the Southern Italians were a despised and feared people, despised especially for doing the work they were brought to do, and feared (characterized as dark-skinned dagos and\n\nhonor\n\nAfrican-blooded guineas) because they were known to work at half wages (pay rates in the North advertised below that of “coloured labor”) seemingly without complaint, clinging to each other and their established ways of doing things. Only four years earlier in New Orleans, eleven Sicilians who had just been exonerated in one way or another of the murder of a corrupt police captain were lynched—a couple of them literally, the rest massacred by bullets—by a huge mob organized by the KKK-like White Defense League; and rightly so, according to such distinguished arbiters of national public opinion as Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and the editors of the New York Times.9 “Maria the murdering seamstress,” with the hot temper and the deadly straight-edge, was made for the tabloids even if she hadn’t been a foreigner; that she was Southern Italian was—for the purposes of a national psyche alarmed about newcomers, factory workers, “Roman” Catholics, and darker-skinned peoples—too good to be true. The very sight of the average Southern Italian was frightening to most Americans of older stock: markedly short and thick of trunk, often misshapen from malnutrition and lack of medical care, dark of skin and hair, in clothing that bespoke their origins, their poverty, and their occupations. In the illustrated papers just coming into being in the 1890s, they were drawn, all too often, with the simian features of the very creatures—performing monkeys—that helped the first arrivals survive. In The Dangerous Classes of New York, Charles Loring Brace pursued the Italian organ grinders of Five Points into their homes, reporting “a bedlam of sounds, and a combination of odors from garlic, monkeys, and the most dirty human persons.”10 The immigrants were loud—speaking dialects much harsher than Tuscan Italian—and they smelled, from lack of washing but also from their wretched surroundings and unfamiliar cuisine. Even their foodstuffs set them uncomfortably apart: “fish that never swam in American waters . . . Big, awkward sausages, anything but appetizing,” noted Jacob Riis.11 Riis, a former police photographer turned housing reformer and no fool, swore that in 1890 almost none of the parasitical criminality of the Five Points—be it opportunistic or organized—was of Italian origin. But the Southern Italian’s vaunted tendency to sudden excessive emotion, according to Riis, could and did cause trouble between friends— competing in cards or love or whatever the local coinage of esteem—\n\n15\n\n16\n\nhonor\n\nthat occasionally resulted in violence, which was, more importantly, “settled,” if at all possible, without the involvement of the police: The wounded man can seldom be persuaded to betray [his attacker]. He wards off all inquiries with a wicked “I fix him myself,” and there the matter rests until he either dies or recovers. If the latter, the community hears after a while of another Italian affray, a man stabbed in a quarrel, dead or dying, and the police know that “he” has been fixed, and the account squared.12\n\nThis method of communal self-reliance—closemouthed problem solving —may not have yet gained a prominent place in the national imagination, but word of its existence was already getting around (the omerta), to the anger of the civic authorities and the anxiety of the general public. Maria’s initial treatment by the police and penal system, especially her incarceration in the Tombs, was rough to the point of brutality. The media was gleefully vicious, rechristening her “Barberi” to echo the sound of “barbarism,” thereby invoking the reigning view of Italians as dirty, stupid primitives prone to the violent outbreak of emotions. The first trial before the New York Superior Court less than three months later was almost comically corrupt, featuring a defendant being tried for firstdegree murder who didn’t understand the concept of premeditation, an incompetent translator whom the judge often prevented from doing his job, and an obscure public defender who met with his terrified client for less than an hour several weeks before the trial and who owed his appointment to political support he had thrown to the judge. Nasty biases and procedural irregularities were to be expected, but they only served to exacerbate the cultural standoff that was the primary lesson of Maria’s first trial, regarding alternative constructions of female self-determination, righteous conduct, and just punishment. The Lower East Siders understood that, whatever exactly had happened in the bar, Maria had in the larger sense of things defended herself. “I take his blood so he no take mine” is what she, under duress, with only the present tense of English available to her, had said: American-style self-defense, perhaps; Italian-style justice, beyond a shadow\n\nhonor\n\nof a doubt. Domenico was a rogue—seducing women right and left, including one long-term lover of such dubious character she seems to have taunted Maria, at Cataldo’s request, with their ongoing affair— but the ugly depths of his character only underscored the principles in play. Having fought to obtain the imprimatur of marriage for weeks, she had done the only thing left to do, given his utter refusal to respond to her mother’s pleas, and with his absolute intransigence before her in the form of imminent flight—which was to try force. Under the code of Honor, the desecrated female was not only ruined for marriage but dead to her world—symbolically dead, which sounds truly barbaric if it weren’t for the fact that she was also eligible for symbolic resurrection, through the vaunted vendetta. Everyone in the neighborhood was surprised, in fact, that Maria’s father or older brother hadn’t already killed Cataldo. When Maria stormed into the bar, with a razor up her sleeve, she was making a last-ditch effort to get her beloved back, but even if that effort failed, she was practically guaranteed that she would regain her respect—even if, in the worst case scenario, it cost her life. This even the public defender, Amos Evans, otherwise out to lunch, understood. Improvising, he decided to play the culture card—to present Maria’s predicament in her own, Southern Italian terms, in an attempt to evoke sympathy and seek leniency from the jury, which was necessarily all-male and, of course, included not a single Italian, Italian speaker, or even anyone of southern European descent. But the presiding judge, John W. Goff, of Anglo-Irish background and severe formality, prompted the prosecuting attorney to object to Evans’s defense strategy on the grounds that such evidence was prima facie motive for premeditation and thus self-incriminating, so he could then rule that the defense’s evidence regarding the circumstances leading up to the tragedy, including Cataldo’s predatory character and Maria’s crisis of Honor, was inadmissible. In an American court there was literally no defense for what Maria seemed to have done. In his final charge to the jury, Judge Goff prohibited from consideration any and all mitigating circumstances, instructing the jury to decide only on the basis of how they construed intent: “The killing did not take place in retaliation against betrayal. When Maria Barbella took the razor from the chest, she had a plan in mind. It is up to you to decide what it\n\n17\n\n18\n\nhonor\n\nwas” (79). To everyone in the courtroom, the verdict seem dictated: “A jury does not concern itself with mercy. The law does not distinguish between the sexes.” Three-quarters of an hour later, the jury had carried out its charge. “The American code has triumphed over the Italian” (81) was the straightforward, victorious declaration of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. A poor Italian girl’s last-gasp stand on her own behalf in the old way —with the knife—was ipso facto her legal death warrant in the New World. The electric chair had been in usage in New York State for six years. Three days later, Judge Goff sentenced Maria Barbella to be the first woman on earth so to die.\n\nOn the face of the public record—as Idanna Pucci has been able to reconstruct it, based on newspaper accounts, letters, one memoir, trial transcripts, a copy of the appeal—the first part of Maria Barbella’s history, up to and including her sentence, reads like a series of spiraling victimizations; the second part, beginning with the series of interventions, like a victory for social justice engineered by activist sentiment within the public sphere. It appears to be, for lack of a better term, a righteous story of a poor immigrant girl done wrong—dealing in the terms of domestic containment, sexual exploitation, and ethnic scapegoating. She is saved from the grotesque compounding of injustices— from the legal system’s logic of blaming the victim—by liberal (then called “progressivist”) activism, including the sentimental wing of the feminist establishment and the enlightened element within the scientific/phrenological community, whose cast of characters can be forgiven their tendency to patronize, given the enormity of what was at stake: a woman’s life, and a people’s reputation. Feminist intellectuals, including Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Mary Livermore, and Susan B. Anthony, protested against what they saw as a characteristic instance of the law blaming the victim (Anthony argued that a false promise of marriage be criminalized), but neither their sociological empathy for Maria nor the legal analyses they offered could be heard against the fever-pitched anticipation of the electrocution to come. Dominating the press, especially in New York City, were phrenological and physiognomic portraits of Barbella, whose personality was supposed\n\nhonor\n\nto be legible in the shape of her skull and body. Maria, a seamstress, took great care with her appearance even under these most dire of circumstances; she was no Mediterranean beauty but pleasantly enough featured. Wielding calipers, however, the pseudo-scientists attested to a predominance in her of simian features—“grossly asymmetrical cranium,” “enormous” lips, and “jutting cheekbones”—that, they claimed, not only indicated the arrested evolutionary development characteristic of the Southern Italian peasant in general but were just exactly indicative of a passionate, impulsive, dangerously reactive personality (154). Life-sized figurines of Barbella, dubbed “Maria the Murderess,” popped up at the amusement park on Coney Island, midtown in Macy’s department store’s curiosity shop, even downtown along the Bowery. Enter onto the scene, in the immediate aftermath of the conviction, a type with no precedent in the south of Italy except in the imaginative pantheon of patron saints. From the very north of Italy came Cora Slocomb di Brazzà, a New Orleans debutante and heiress turned Northern Italian aristocrat by marriage and women’s labor entrepreneur by fierce dedication (she organized a lace-making cooperative in Udine). Cora Slocomb had followed Maria’s trial from the other side of the ocean (“Another poor Italian immigrant at the mercy of the American courts”). Making the transatlantic crossing to see for herself, she found not a few like-minded progressives already in action (including Rebecca Salomé Foster, the otherwise anonymous “Tombs Angel”). Slocomb befriended Maria and her family, rallied public figures and intellectuals and even a couple of members of the press, organized a massive petition for clemency to the governor of New York State (who kept his mouth shut and bided his time), and, most importantly, she secured a first-rate defense team headed by Frederic House and featuring Emanuel Friend, who together would prove to be the Johnnie Cochran/Alan Dershowitz duo of their era. That a wealthy, educated, and titled person would take up a poor peasant’s cause was a true shock to the Barbella family and to their Italian community. Such skilled and concerted intervention was in its own way a major miracle on the Lower East Side, but the best—tactical judgment and legal inventiveness in the face of anti-Italian prejudice, the great good luck of the properly prepared (including a key witness), and certain instincts about Maria and her fellow immigrants—was yet to come.\n\n19\n\n20\n\nhonor\n\nIn September 1895, with the long appeals process underway and Maria better housed (in a strictly physical sense) and better fed (the Barbellas could afford macaroni only on Sundays, otherwise it was bread and milk) and better schooled (the warden’s wife decided to teach her English) at Sing Sing than at any other time in her life, Cora di Brazzà felt able to return with her husband to Italy. In mid-October, Cora undertook the truly arduous journey south into the mountains of Basilicata, to Maria’s native town of Ferrandina, so remote she was lucky to find it on a map. In Ferrandina, she witnessed firsthand the social forces underlying the extreme deprivation called la miseria, which stepped her empathy up another notch. Cora also found evidence of periodic, short-term mental instability—almost certainly epilepsy—afflicting both sides of Maria’s family. Here, then, were grounds for burying the culture card and substituting for it an up-to-date variation on the classic temporary insanity defense, seductively scientific with a disarming (to the racists) counterpunch. “Maria was no longer the victim of an indigent class or of an inferior condition due to her sex. She was no longer a woman forced to kill because of a barbarous southern Italian custom, nor a murderess for money. She was an epileptic” (210–11). House, who took the case for expenses only, went immediately to work fashioning an effective appeal, featuring overlooked and/or suppressed evidence, including Cataldo’s own twelve-inch knife found on his body, but his strongest leverage came from failures of due process. In April 1896, the Court of Appeals in Albany granted a retrial, holding Judge Goff accountable for systematic elimination of testimony and for outright bias. Six months later, House and his partners mounted only the second epilepsy defense ever in the United States—a twenty-four-day (and often night-session) ordeal in which a small legion of forensic anthropologists and alienists (as psychologists were called) debated whether the medical histories and physiognomies of the Barbella family indicated the kind of “degeneracy” that would have made Maria susceptible to fits in which she did not know, quite literally, “who she was, where she was, and what she was doing.” According to their claims, epilepsy was a barbaric, indeed, barbarism-inducing condition because it deprived the sufferer not only of memory after the fact but of agency during it. House and his team had found a way to turn the racial primitivism hounding Maria to her advantage—at least theoretically. But\n\nhonor\n\nthe amount of volition that was seemingly necessary to kill Cataldo—a hidden razor pulled from a dress sleeve, opened, then slashed across a throat—left Maria’s actual state of mind in doubt. If to a historian of prejudice there is something gratifying about the turnabout in fair play that the epilepsy defense entailed, to an unreconstructed partisan of folk culture there was something delicious about what was, in retrospect, the decisive moment of theatricality during the retrial. House strove to establish that Maria was prone to episodic fits that had never been diagnosed but which everyone in the neighborhood knew about—and to do so he had, of course, to rely on poor, illiterate, malnourished if not misshapen, egregiously out-of-place laborers who did not speak a word of English. On cross-examination, the lead prosecuting attorney, John F. McIntyre, generally rock solid throughout both trials, badgered one of these witnesses, Angelo Piscopo (a hallmate from the sad tenement where Cataldo had installed Maria), to the point where Piscopo admitted through the translator that it was, alas, difficult for him to describe the screaming fit that Maria had undergone just ten days before Cataldo’s death. Reaching for a coup de grace, prosecutor McIntyre asked Piscopo, in the classic condescending rhythms of pointedly facetious cross-examination, if “by any chance” the man could “imitate” what he had heard. It was, as Pucci reports, an enormous mistake: “Yes, sir,” Angelo answered excitedly. The tall thin man stood up and gave the awful, gasping cry of the epileptic. It was an unmistakable scream. Angelo threw his head back and lifted his arms, rotating his hands upwards and then stopping them in midair. He stayed there, rigid, and yet trembling from head to foot. “Sit down!” thundered McIntyre, but the damage was done. (254)\n\nWhat poetic justice! The prosecutor had intuited so little about the most melodramatic and gesticulative of peoples that he asked Piscopo, heretofore restrained by the terrifying solemnity of the nineteenth-century Anglo-American courtroom, if “by any chance” he—a Southern Italian peasant!—could act something out. The fact of a full-bore black-out interlude making Maria both superhuman and less-than-human might explain the lack of clarity everywhere in her testimony, both on the witness stand and behind the scenes.\n\n21\n\n22\n\nhonor\n\nIt would account for the physical power and strength of purpose with which she must have wielded the razor. And it would account for the success with which she rebounded, the psychological health and ethical self-possession that she displayed at the second trial. The opportunity to assign Maria’s mysterious behavior—“A woman does not kill lightly, it’s not in her nature” was Cora’s original operating assumption—to a temporary bout of mental illness seems heaven-sent given the legal jeopardy in which she found herself, but, with 20/20 hindsight, we can also see how well the fit served Maria both before (how does a poor Italian girl solve a problem like Cataldo?) and after (how does a good Catholic girl live with a solution like Maria’s?) the trial. More than once, in ironies of almost surreal proportion, Maria’s epilepsy got her into a double bind only to set her free.\n\nThe time-honored Italian Catholic peasant cult of Honor is—apparently —what got Maria Barbella into so much trouble. The progressive American culture of personal self-transformation, political intervention, and genetic neurology is—apparently—what got her out. But there was a dialectic at play between the two, tradition as modernity, the Italian as American, that requires our final attention. To the delight of her family and community, America proved its boast of justice when Maria was saved as if by miracle by forces that would seem to have been and to a large extent must have been very much outside her control: ambitious activists, legal technicalities, forensic medicine. But the information that Idanna Pucci was able to gather is not yet all before us, and there is another trajectory to the story—Maria’s gumption, her resourcefulness —yielding a spicier dimension to the narrative. If as a victim several times over—worked to the bone, exploited in love, demonized by the press, objectified by social workers, and railroaded by the judicial system—Maria Barbella illustrates what the immigrants faced upon arrival, then as the ultimate victor—set free from Cataldo, exonerated before the law, liberated from public spectacle, both her life and dignity restored— Maria illustrates how it all began: the century-long transfusion of Italian blood rites into American possibility. No Italian, perhaps no immigrant, was more on the public stage at the height of the Great Migration than Maria Barbella. However much\n\nhonor\n\nagainst her will and intent, Maria Barbella was a celebrity with a stage name and iconic tag—Maria Barberi, the murdering seamstress—done up in wax, midtown at Macy’s, downtown on the corner at Five Points. While she could not have known in advance what she was getting herself into, she was not without agency; and in the exercise of that agency —including its snowballing significance and profound reversals—lies one more dimension of Maria’s story. Progressivist patronage, judicial review, and the sciences of the mind opened up the possibility for winning her legal freedom—which to a Southern Italian felt like an act of divine intervention—but it was Barbella herself who stepped onto the stage and allowed the heavens to work on her behalf, whether she understood it that way or not. Maria had to some degree offered herself up to Cataldo, dreaming of a better life; she had to some degree worked up the strength that sacrificed his life in order to resurrect her own in the wake of broken dreams; and she had done what had to be done, to put herself in the position to receive the fates’—the Blessed Mother working through the Patron Saints of the Transatlantic—forgiveness. It was the American promise of romance that tempted Maria to risk Cataldo’s proximity, however we figure the role of a sedative in the consummating hour. It was her anger at the embarrassment, at the brutal assumption and social betrayal of her love that gave her the physical strength to fight, including the strength of will to summon that convenient lapse of consciousness. And it was the ability to dream another ending for herself that allowed her to heal for sixteen months in Sing Sing, to learn enough English to present herself as a love-struck good girl done wrong by a heartless predator and then betrayed a second time by the bad blood of an inherited neurological disease. If these were the first steps toward assimilation, it was assimilation, Italian style. Maria Barbella could have had no inkling that she was about to be put on parade as the first Italian in America available for mass forms of identification and disdain, empathy and projection; but it was not a coincidence, the grace with which she responded to the hazards and opportunities that came her way, slowly at first, then spiraling into the triumph of the second trial. Fighting Cataldo brought her into a social theater in which she successfully “seduced” and “deployed” a whole coterie of others—Rebecca Foster and Cora Slocomb di Brazzà, of course, but also the warden’s wife and the inmates at Sing Sing, Frederic House\n\n23\n\n24\n\nhonor\n\nand the defense team, producer-playwright Moishe Ha-Levi Ish Hurwitz Jewish (who dramatized her story for the Yiddish stage), and such eloquent commentators as Julian Hawthorne (Nathaniel Hawthorne’s son), who wrote for the New York Journal—ultimately bringing certain of the educated elite and many of the newcomers in the street around to see it more or less her way. It was the colorfulness of Cataldo’s death coupled with the unique severity of her sentence (they had yet to work the kinks out of this brutal form of public execution) that caught the interest of Maria’s interlocutors, but it wasn’t just righteous curiosity that sustained commitment and focused concentration during the grueling year of research, preparation, and trial. It was—it had to be—Maria. The progressivists working on Maria’s behalf may have first been drawn to the case on principle, but they kept at it, I think, because they saw something in Maria tougher and more complex than the tag of condescension—“this childish, ignorant, hot-blooded Italian girl”—used by casual sympathizers. As Pulitzer’s New York World put it, “Simple epilepsy will not save Maria from the electric chair” (210). Crucial to the victorious acquittal was Maria’s remarkable poise on the witness stand, including six hours of first-class cross-examination, during which she consistently maintained, in the English she had learned at Sing Sing, that she loved Cataldo still, that all she wanted to do was to get him to marry her, and that she did not remember what transpired in the bar—“The blood on my hands. I thought I was cut” (237). Maria let herself believe, so others could believe, that she was merely and only a confused, conscientious, love-besotted girl overwhelmed—tragically lost, even to herself —by a devastating fit at the fatal hour. But was it so? The very first fact about Maria that Pucci enters into the narrative record concerns the obscure night when Cataldo first took the girl’s honor. The one thing Maria knew for sure about how it happened was that her clothing—a long wide skirt, several underskirts, corsets, tailored blouses, and stockings—had not been torn. “When a man wanted a woman, he had to make his way through layers and layers of material —unless, obviously, she desired him enough to take her clothes off” (3). Pucci’s “unless” dangles, in a teasing flash, an ambiguous inflection, baiting us with the idea of something closer to informed consent, which would mean that Maria had been flirting, however momentarily, with the\n\nhonor\n\nexplicit transgression of Southern Italian sexual norms. Given that peasant mores and obligations were at stake, even a small element of rebellious self-determination puts a more difficult ethical spin on the affair than drug-induced violation alone, which was, more or less, what everyone thought at the time, even the many non-Italians who proclaimed she should fry. Pucci seems to have taken the nineteenth-century equivalent of date rape for her own operating hypothesis through most of the research and writing of The Trials of Maria Barbella. The book begins, “This is how I saw the events leading up to the death of Domenico Cataldo” (p. 3, emphasis mine)—until, in the name of thoroughness (the Ellis Island records had been destroyed) and happily perverse curiosity, she finally made the tough pilgrimage to Maria’s village of Ferrandina, where the trains still do not go. There are two parishes in this medieval township, a forbidding place where the townsfolk no longer remember anyone by the surname Barbella. And yet, in the second of the church’s records, Pucci discovers that there was indeed born to Michele and Filomena Barbella a girl child, christened Maria, at 6 a.m. on October 24, 1868. In 1868!, which means that in April 1895, when Domenico Cataldo lost his life to the razor, Maria Barbella was not twenty-two years old, as was taken for granted in every single instance of the public record, but nearly five years older. For once, Pucci speculates out loud: “When Cataldo rejected her, she may well have lost hope of ever getting married. In her mind, it may have been her last chance. In 1895, an unmarried woman in her late twenties was already doomed to a life as a spinster” (289)—which, I might add, involved full-time service first to her younger siblings and then to her aging parents, untouched by companionate love or physical intimacy her whole life long. The knowledge of Maria’s real age suggests a reassessment of Maria’s attitude toward the affair itself, casting it in a more consensual light despite Cataldo’s practiced subterfuge. Pucci doesn’t quite say it, but could Maria have been tempted, originally, by the idea of receiving the love that she felt was long overdue, while at the same time setting a last-ditch marriage trap? (Wouldn’t Domenico have to keep his promise?) Such thinking on the part of Maria, even if and perhaps especially if it were accompanied by the contrary fear that in Little Italy the code of obligation pursuant to taking a maiden’s virginity wasn’t going to be the\n\n25\n\n26\n\nhonor\n\niron bond it was in Basilicata, ratchets up the frustration Maria must have experienced at Cataldo’s refusal to marry her. Hell hath no desperation . . . , we might put it. Readers are likely to find themselves thinking throughout most of The Trials of Maria Barbella that Maria was simply victimized at each stage and that the acquittal is legally just and morally righteous in contemporary terms, and yet by the book’s end Pucci leaves us with the disconcerting probability that, epilepsy or no epilepsy, Maria Barbella took Domenico Cataldo’s life. It is unclear whether the Italians, who figured the act justified but never raised the question of sexual consent, simply couldn’t imagine a good girl like Maria saying yes, or if they believed that by accepting her virginity Domenico had, in fact, contracted marriage. From our contemporary perspective the acquittal looks less like a legal confirmation of Maria’s innocence and more like a bestowal of mercy: an act of divine intervention, if you like, or the unwitting grace of her interlocutors’ empathy and effort. The full shock value of Pucci’s revelation of Maria’s age devolves not only upon the immigrants, whose huddling together in secret is an ancient art of culture that supposedly ran in their blood, but also upon the one outsider who must have discovered Maria’s actual age and who therefore must have elected to enter voluntarily into the Southern Italian cult of secrecy, namely, the American-born Unitarian, Cora Slocomb di Brazzà. You may, if you take pleasure or courage in the figurative excess of Catholic iconography, think of Cora as an angel of mercy, not only because she masterminded the defense that brought the jury to its acquittal, but because she also withheld the hidden fact that would have condemned Maria. Or you may think of Cora less extravagantly as an abettor to a successful stroke of intercontinental feminist intervention in getting a poor, abused woman off the nastiest of hooks. But there can be no doubt of Idanna Pucci’s own role—as tenacious researcher and inspired narrator—in all this. What takes my breath away about Pucci’s reconstruction is that, as a story, despite or rather because it is sequenced, nuanced, and understated with historical rigor, it feels so Italian. The Trials of Maria Barbella does great justice to the public record it establishes, slowly inviting a social and ethical triumphalism, in order to let us in on the full power of the darker realism of an Italian women’s omerta: the exquisite little secret that Domenico Cataldo’s death\n\nhonor\n\njust may have been a calculated act of vengeance, and Maria Barbella’s freedom a gift of blessed Fate.13 From start to finish, Maria Barbella threatened the American public because she was the bearer of an alternative culture with different traditions of conflict resolution, self-assertion, and guilt attribution (part fact, part legend), which were put to risky use across the Atlantic and almost earned her a truly barbaric American death. The tribulations of Maria Barbella in the United States occurred only because of changed circumstances—Cataldo’s assumption of cost-free exploitation, a sensationalist media fanning the flames of an already-prejudicial courtroom, a legal system focused on the genderless appraisal of utterly gendered circumstances and behavior, a death sentence designed to be a lesson to the hot-blooded multitudes; and the subsequent process of exoneration— the progressivist intervention, a fancy temporary-insanity defense, and a jury forced to think in black and white—that was American, too. Taken together, the moral of the story would appear to be that, from the very beginning, to survive in America you have to play by its rules— that is, to assimilate. But crediting Maria with agency (romantic, vindictive, performative, and “blessed”) suggests that, despite or rather because of cultures in conflict and in transition, her particular strategies for self-determination—embracing physical romance, striking out for personal and familial vengeance, acting the good girl born under an unlucky neurological star, and keeping secret from first to last the devastating fact of her imminent spinsterhood—were less cleanly assimilationist and more, well, Mediterranean than meets the eye. Once apprised of the full record, we are in a position to feel what, secretly, Maria Barbella and those closest to her must have felt, what Cora Slocomb di Brazzà must have eventually intuited, and what author Idanna Pucci has crafted her documentary novel to provoke in us. Barbella’s is the story not only of male predatory opportunism but of female sexual transgression; not only of physiological accident but of poorly calibrated vengeance; not only of U.S. penal-code justice but of Italianstyle common-law mercy. Whatever the import of Barbella’s epileptic fit on her momentary volition, a year and some months later Maria Barbella stood before an all-American jury and got away—in cultural as well as literal terms—with murder.\n\n27\n\nchapter\n\n2\n\nCity New York Delirious The truth: These country women from the mountain farms of Italy . . . loved the clashing steel and stone of the great city, the thunder of trains in the railroad yards across the street, the lights above the Palisades far across the river. —Mario Puzo, 1964\n\n“Milan is just like New York, only there aren’t so many Italians.” The assumption underlying this common quip is that New York is one of the most Italian places on earth, yet it was built and settled not by the urban peoples of Italy’s advanced north but by contadini—the rural peasants from the impoverished, essentially medieval hill towns south and east of Naples. What happened? How did Italian peasants, conservative by their own tradition, come to so love the American city—Greater Metropolitan New York and its industrial satellites most of all—that they remain to this day hugely identified with it? The story begins with the initial encounter of Mediterranean hill towners with the techno-industrial cityscape, a sensory shock of profound import that no one understood better than the painter Joseph Stella, who emigrated at eighteen from Basilicata to New York’s Lower East Side and emerged fifteen years later as America’s “first and greatest futurist.” Stella’s colossal renditions of America’s urban infrastructure— of Coney Island, the Brooklyn Bridge, the port and skyline of New York —captured the primal scene of industrial sublimity, the newcomer’s 28\n\ncity\n\nfierce engagement with what Stella called, with an energetic, compacted Italinglish eloquence, “the polychromatic riot of a new polyphony.” What Stella meant—what, indeed, he pictured—was the sudden, instantaneous exposure to tunnels and bridges that knew no bounds, buildings that leaped massively to the sky, and electric lights that cut through and carnivalized the night sky—which in combination felt to him like nothing short of “a new divinity.” Throughout the period of the Great Migration and well into the 1920s, after the gates of admission had been effectively shut to the southern and eastern Europeans, there were many efforts—most of them led by oldfamily social workers with evangelical Protestant leanings—to move the Italian immigrants from the cities, especially from the tough ghettoes of the Lower East Side, Hell’s Kitchen, and East Harlem, onto farms in places like south Jersey, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The idea was that the city (crowded, filthy, and filled with crime) was inherently corrupting, and that the Italians, unusually susceptible to corruption, needed to get out if they were to be saved and safely absorbed into American society. The back-to-the-farm movements failed miserably, however, as only a very, very few immigrants ventured forth and even fewer did not immediately return to the Little Italies. The established explanations for this resistance are good ones: industrial wage labor, no matter how exploitative, still brought cash that could be saved, no matter in how miniscule the units, which is what brought most of the immigrants in the United States in the first place (many of whom figured they would send money and then go back to Italy); the romance of the land had no appeal to the peasants from south and east of Naples, most of whose families had suffered under its caprice since time immemorial, nature no friend; and that peculiarly American arrangement wherein individual families lived on farms isolated from one another made no sense at all to ferociously social people who huddled together in hill towns, finding in the conviviality of street stoops, piazzas, and neighboring relatives the only respite from the terrible and terribly alienating work on the land they farmed, often miles away. These are persuasive accounts of why the immigrants rejected farming from the get-go. But I think there developed, with surprising speed, a less practical, less ideological, less domestic reason for keeping close to the city, which has to do with the Italian feeling for what sociologists call the built environment:\n\n29\n\n30\n\ncity\n\nhow the immigrants responded to and made sense of the remarkable physicality of New York. I can’t prove, of course, what the illiterate and undocumented felt, but in interpreting what is in the sociological record beyond dispute— the stubborn urban-ness that the Italian immigrants demonstrated from the start and that has characterized each and every ensuing generation—we have the privilege of a very special kind of hindsight, which is that of artistic legacy.1 It is not a coincidence that those descended from a highly gestural people whose semi-pagan mode of Christianity is outlandishly iconographic rather than word-focused, and spectacleextravagant rather than spectacle-wary, related day to day to their new environments visually (taking in through the eye) and theatrically (dramatically presenting oneself to the eye); and it is not a coincidence, then, that over time they came to achieve so well, as a group, not so much in the written as in the visual and performative arts. But we need not focus on the big picture—yet. Of the various tendencies within the arts of Italian America, which of course go off in diverse, even contrary, directions, what is unmistakable, from the very beginning, is an involvement in the emergent industrial city so intense and impassioned that there is no other word for it than metaphysical; and it is a mystery to be happily reckoned with that the original mapping of that involvement— the cityscapes of Joseph Stella—continue, somehow, to speak to many of us today who are trying still to look the human impact of phenomenal technological advancement in the eye. In early 1896, at the very moment that Maria Barbella, the East Side seamstress, was at Sing Sing on death row, Giuseppe Michele Stella left Mura Lucano, another medieval township on the slopes of the southern Apennines in Basilicata, and crossed the Atlantic from Naples by steamship to the United States to join his older brother, Antonio, in New York’s Italian East Side, just blocks from where the Barbella family had settled (closer, still, to where a couple generations later Martin Scorsese would be raised). America was a shock—a blinding cacophonous assault of light and machinery, skyscraper and mill, tunnel and bridge—which obsessed young Giuseppe from the start and intensified year after year (he saw the coal mines, the steel towns, and the refineries, too), but which he would not come to understand, if understand was the right\n\ncity\n\nword, until he could portray/represent/visualize it, sixteen years later, as the painter Joseph Stella: Steel and electricity had created a new world. A new drama had surged from the unmerciful violation of darkness at night, by the violent blaze of electricity and a new polyphony was ringing all around with the scintillating, highly colored lights. The steel had leaped to hyperbolic altitudes and expanded to vast latitudes with the skyscrapers and with bridges made for the conjunction of worlds. A new architecture was created, a new perspective.2\n\nTwenty and forty and sixty years later, Stella was still talking about his initial encounter with America in this way, in an idiom of extravagant, highly impacted metaphors that strike the ear (you might even say, hit the eye) with the ultra-quick, superbright sensory overload that epitomized his first contact: “I could define New York as a monstrous steely bar erected by modern cyclops to defy the Gods with the dazzling of a thunderbolt.”3 How typical of the Italians was talk like this? Like the great majority of the immigrants, Stella came from an impoverished mountain village where the train did not go, electricity was scarcely a rumor, and, the ancient Roman aqueducts notwithstanding, women still lugged water by donkey and on their heads. The son of a governmental functionary (the only kind of middle class there was in such a town), Stella received a boarding-school education where he was taught Whitman and Poe as well as the European classics and where he felt the early stirrings, or so he later claimed, of artistic temperament—impulses that seem to have been directly linked as well to the melodramatic (manic-depressive) hypersensitivity for which Southern Italians are renowned even today, in the United States especially. The Stella family was not immune to poverty, but he was no contadino—that’s for sure. On the other hand, the peasants who arrived in the United States had, most of them, spent no more time in Naples (or in Palermo, or in any other city for that matter) than it took to find the loading dock, whereas Stella had lived in Naples for several years of high school, which means that the contrast between the hill towns they came from and what they saw from the decks and\n\n31\n\n32\n\ncity\n\nthen along the streets when they arrived was, if anything, greater for the contadini than that which Stella experienced. Stella had some big words, but they were not originally in English; he did not use them the way American intellectuals did; and even then it was not the words that would finally matter but the pictures. Stella’s reaction to the advanced metropolis was not so much typical as it was, in varying ways, hypertypical—of the Italian country folk, of Mediterranean Catholics and their fellow immigrants more generally, and of all those who encountered the modern city all at once, without warning, and beyond earshot of formal sociological analysis. The principal response of each and every one must have been mindbending, body-wracking shock, of being utterly overwhelmed not only by the arduousness of the journey and the rough uncertainties ahead, but also by changes of movement and sound, dimensions of time and space that did not, by any known measure, compute. But what, then, was distinctly Italian about that? Stella’s reaction had a particular shape to it, even a recurring and renewed and exponentially increasing shape, a shape much more complex and wonder filled and even desirous than the doom-filled repugnance, nostalgic to the core, that has come down to us from the metaphysics of New England transcendentalism, which was itself (as scholars have come to recognize) a reaction formation from the rural periphery of Boston (America’s first mercantile capital) to the market and manufacturing taking hold within.4 In March of 1835 or ’36, Ralph Waldo Emerson, then a disgruntled young Unitarian minister, took a walk in a quotidian daze across the cow pasture called Boston Common, without any occurrence of special good fortune, and enjoyed what he called “a perfect exhilaration,” in which he became “a transparent eyeball”: the moment, as it were, of a nineteenthcentury, post-Puritan (universalistic) American sublime. Imagine then that a man had a mystical Romantic poetic frame of mind like Emerson, but unlike Emerson he came from a medieval town barely touched by capitalism and not at all touched by the technologies of modernity (no locomotive, no electricity, no running water), and unlike Emerson peopled environments and occasioned festivity and visual spectacle ran in his blood,5 and unlike Emerson he encountered urban modernity not through the fits and starts of colonial Boston and of excursions therefrom but all at once—crossing the seas to America. Like Emerson before him,\n\ncity\n\nStella felt part and parcel of something beyond the individual self, supernature, but Stella’s stimulus to the sublime was urban, not rural; machine driven, not nature borne; and people entailed, not isolated. Out in the park woods all by himself, back turned upon the city, Emerson had, on a singular occasion, been “glad to the brink of fear,” giddy with the inferred benignity of God, whereas the techno-industrial cityscape panicked Stella to the wellspring of ecstasy; he felt the deliciousness of terror recurrently, yet as if for the very first time; and what, metaphysically, the techno-industrial environment felt like to him was the pulsing together of deity and demon through the mind-body membrane into the soul. What did this feeling mean? How could he find out? And how could he express it? In the fall 1896, his first year in the United States, Stella started medical school according to his brother’s wishes, but only lasted a year. In the spring of 1897, he started the College of Pharmacy of the City of New York, but only lasted a semester, instead hanging out at the Art Students League. From 1898 to 1901, he studied at the New York School of Art under its esteemed director, William Merritt Chase, who against the tide of change taught the skills of Rembrandt and Van Eyck, and who saw in Stella such promise that he granted him the most unusual boon of a scholarship. For the next decade Stella, already a brilliant draftsman, thought to follow directly in Chase’s footsteps, struggling to execute classical subjects in traditional media while eking out a living as a documentary illustrator. From 1909 to 1910, he studied the Renaissance masters in Italy, then traveled to Paris, where he met the modernist avantgarde and experienced a revelation, that his “fate” (such a Mediterranean Catholic way of thinking about these things!) was to “put [my] vision into the future instead of walking back to the past.” At thirtyfive years of age, then, Stella realized his exact calling as an artist, which was to declaim in visual form that “steely orchestra of modern constructions” that had long haunted him—to render techno-industrial America’s reordering of human experience, and thus, through painting, a move at once self-incorporating and self-alienating, to claim and to disclaim the city. As Stella understood it, the United States demanded forms of acceptance and resistance, translation/interpretation and the registering of mystery, worship and something of an exorcism—an art “myriad-minded” in respect of “an oceanic poliphony (never heard\n\n33\n\n34\n\ncity\n\nbefore)” inhering in “the new civilization of america” (his terms, his spelling, his capitalization). In an idiosyncratic masterpiece, Delirious New York (1978), Rem Koolhaas (whom Time magazine dubbed the architect of the first decade of the new millennium in the issue that was released just a couple of days before the 9/11 attacks) nominated the spectacular prewar recreation complexes at Coney Island as the harbinger of the twentieth-century city to come. But Stella got there first—in taking architecture as an animate being and in nominating Coney Island as the symbolic register of the techno-industrial revolution. Stella’s first famous painting, the sensation-causing Battle of Lights, Coney Island, Mardi Gras (1913–1914), was a gigantic canvas, described at the time as a “phantasmagoria,” representing one of the Coney Island amusement complexes, Luna Park, at night (during the festivities it marketed as “Mardi Gras”). Battle of Lights depicts the psychosocial dislocation of the not-yet-naturalized spectator, half in and half out, seen from afar but as if in the center of centrifuge, through a funhouse mirror hallucinogenically; it refuses to discipline the paint either to programmatic theory or modern decor, incorporating Luna Park—its figured tower as the cyclops—while testifying to its effect on the participant-observer. The formal leap in representational modality rehearses the shift in built reality; the rush of felt power in Stella as an artist rehearses the fear and wonder not only of the leap in art technologies that he learned in Paris but the leap in lived techno-industry that he reexperienced in returning to the States and that he recognized in the prismatic microcosm of Coney Island. At Coney Island, you did not so much escape from urban modernity as tumble headlong into its logical culmination, a frenzy of machined light and movement, a playful yet gut-wrenching escalation of the very forces impacting the psyche day to day. In his breakthrough Coney Island series, Stella set out to capture—at a moment when electric light was still awe inspiring (Luna Park alone had a quarter of a million light bulbs) and transportation technology an as-yet untapped amusement resource and cultural mores emerging at last from the nineteenth century (the rides flung bodies, warm from the beach, shockingly together)—the force of the park upon the individual who had just arrived in the several senses of that word, arrival. I don’t think it is a coincidence, in contrast, that it was an American-\n\ncity\n\nBattle of Lights, Coney Island, Mardi Gras, 1913–1914. Oil on canvas, 76 × 85 in. Yale University Art Gallery.\n\nizing Italian who took the American neo-carnival seriously—who focused not on the artificiality of its amusements and hence the presumed gullibility of their consumers, but celebrated instead the park as a “modern kermesse” (kermesse being an old Dutch word for an outdoor fair, with, of course, a fearful ambivalence of mystical affect but not a trace, not a single trace, of moral or aesthetic condescension).6 Consider for instance where in the old world the magic came from, what magic there was in the hill towns they had left behind: the townspeople would break out from the worst kind of daily routine for festas of the Virgin and the patron saints, which embraced color and light and sound and movement. These elaborate, relatively crowded processions, with colorful icons held aloft, surrounded by tables of luxurious food and drink, topped off\n\n35\n\n36\n\ncity\n\n(if at all possible) by fireworks!—even the verticality of the hill towns, crowned by cathedrals towering over the hills towering over the valleys —suggested an eerie predilection for the New York sensorial cacophony, enough of a predilection to suggest that there was a reason more complex than changing an old home for a new one or being people of the body rather than the mind to explain how the shock of the industrial city entailed, for the immigrants at least, some kind of affirmation and, over time, became addictive in itself: the urban-ness, as it were, of the urbanite.7 Stella’s Battle of Lights was the most famous and controversial painting in the famous and controversial Montross Gallery Show of 1914; it was a shocker, but it almost instantly received the “futurist” label. The term “Italian futurist” has come to imply that Stella was a sophisticated player in the new transatlantic arts, but to call his work futurist is, alas, all too neat and convenient—even for work as directly influenced by Umberto Boccioni and Gino Severini as the Coney Island paintings. Although Stella was of course himself an Italian and he had, in fact, met several of the leading lights of the concerted movement—Boccioni, Severini, and Carrà—that did indeed call itself futurism, Stella insisted, not without cause, and not inaccurately, that he worked from inspiration, not from an intellectualized artistic program. Stella was excited by the potential of the new art to render the world in transformation, but he, like Emerson, had little time for groupthink: for Stella, a challenge to tradition that starts or turns doctrinaire will defeat its own purpose, which is to see beyond what has already been established. Stella’s inspiration was to deploy a scandalously innovative art not for art’s sake, not for innovation’s sake, and not just to outrage an onlooker whose tastes were still Victorian, but rather to convey a concentrated reenactment of the actual experience of arriving that first time at Coney Island, to induce that particular jolt, including its thrills, in the first-time viewer of the painting, and to keep it alive viewing after viewing. For all its affinities with the manifestoes of Carrà and Martinetti, Battle of Lights is less thesis driven than phenomenological. If in fact we compare Battle of Lights to its most immediate formal models, several things emerge: it was not sufficiently clean, not sufficiently decorative, for the Museum of Modern Art. At one point Stella called Battle of Lights a kaleidoscope, but Battle of Lights is actually less geometrically neat—\n\ncity\n\nless like the actual view through a kaleidoscope—than the famous Boccioni and Severini paintings that he must have seen in Paris and that eventually were installed at MoMA. Stella insists on the duality of participant and spectator—that is, on the doubleness of being, simultaneously, an individual at the center of the park’s whirl and the individual taking in the whole thing. Most importantly, in comparison to the European models, Battle of Lights is an earthier, more naturalistic representation of the modern amusements—you can trace and name the individual rides, including The Tickler and Razzle Dazzle—inviting the viewer to laugh with the artist himself having fun with perspectives on the park; and it is a headier, indeed more spiritual, summing-up of the import of those amusements, in which the cyclopean tower personifies (we might even say incarnates) the new technological order. We must call it fated instinct that landed Stella, when he was growing confident as an artist in the wake of the Coney Island successes but nonetheless still struggling financially, in a Williamsburg apartment blocks from the harbor, while his studio remained in Lower Manhattan. What he saw looking across the harbor from his apartment in the industrial port was what he took in again psychophysically each time he made the walk across the Brooklyn Bridge—the pedestrian walkway recapitulating transatlantic migration recapitulating global capitalist modernization. Ernest Goldstein, writing for young people with clarity and intelligence, observes with succinct binaries: It took Stella twenty years from the first time he saw the bridge to paint it. During that time, he completed two educations: one as an artist, the other as an immigrant in New York City. From one he learned how to paint. From the other he learned what to see in the land of opportunity. He needed both educations to paint his bridge.8\n\nStella “interpreted” (the word is finally his, of course) the voices of"
