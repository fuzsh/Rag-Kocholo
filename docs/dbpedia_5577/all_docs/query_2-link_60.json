        "text": "That is the title of a book by Luigi Barzini. Please note that this is by Luigi Barzini Jr. Since his father was also a well known Italian journalist. They both worked at the Milanese newspaper Corriere della Sera â€“ Italy’s equivalent of the New York Times. But Junior outdid his father in writing some very influential and controversial books. This particular book was published in 1964 so it had already been around a long time when I first read it. Still, it provides great insights into the Italian character and the forces that have shaped the nation. In the photo below the woman is his daughter Benedetta an actress and model – an interesting story in her own right.\n\nOne thing that has definitely changed from the time when Barzini wrote this book is the economic status of Italy. He talks of Italy as a poor country but now it has about the same GDP as the UK. There is still the problem of the Mezzogiorno. That is the economic divide between the wealthy north and the relatively impoverished south. This has been so for a very long time and seems to be due to a cultural difference between the two halves of the country. In some ways it is like the United States in that the north developed industry while the south remained more feudal. I dare say that that model still holds. Another aspect of Italian life that remains true today is the brain drain from Italy due to the inadequate resourced provided for scientific researchers. I read an article recently about just that phenomenon Amazing that this is just as pertinent now as 46 years after Barzini made this observation.\n\nOther notable observations stressed by Barzini are the importance of spectacle (check out those Carabinieri uniforms) and the art of illusion, and perhaps most importantly of self-delusion.\n\nBasta! It’s a great read and provides a lot of insight into what makes the country and the people what they are. I’d even say it is a must for anyone serious about trying, difficult I grant you, to really understand Italian national character. For those of you who’d like something a little shorter here is an article that Luigi wrote for the New York Times in 1981.\n\nSo has anyone read this or a similarly significant book on the Italian character?\n\nOf course I’d love for you to subscribe â€“ you can be the second (my wife is the first).\n\nI haven’t fixed these in years but the perfect opportunity presented itself. We were invited to a wedding of one of the dancer friends of my wife. Well, she’s my friend too but I’m not really a part of the dance community except by marriage. In any case part of the wedding was the request to bring a dish for the reception. I volunteered to bring an appetizer (antipasto). These things are just so delicious and relatively simple to make. They are from a cookbook I bought long ago by a San Francisco chef named Carlo Middione. He had a great place in San Francisco called Vivande Porta Via which sadly has closed. These come from a cookbook of his entitled â€œThe Foods of Southern Italyâ€ which is available (I checked Amazon) and is a worthy addition to any Italophile cookbook shelf.\n\nIn any case, these little sandwiches made of eggplant slices with mortadella and provolone inside are just the thing to serve someone that thinks that they don’t like eggplant. They are the best eggplant that you’ll ever eat! You bread the outside by dipping them in beaten egg and then coat with a mixture of breadcrumbs, parsley, parmigiano reggiano then drizzle with a little olive oil and bake them in the oven. You’d better make a double recipe since they will disappear fast. You can find the complete recipe here. One thing of course when doing the dunking in eggs and breading â€“ I never can seem to do this without getting wads of breading all over my fingers because after all you’re breading your fingers at the same time. I wind up dumping some of the breading on the top and shaking off the excess and then turning them over and doing the same. Believe me, it’s worth the effort.\n\nWhere is that food stylist when I need her? These are right out of the oven and waiting to be cut into quarters as finger food to amaze your friends. Â You’ll need to soak the baking sheet. Maybe I should have given it a thin coat of oil. In any case it will clean right up after a bit.\n\nSo pour a glass of wine and give a toast to Carlo.\n\nOh, you can subscribe to an RSS feed or an email notification of posts by clicking the appropriate link on the right sidebar.\n\nIt is very interesting learning another language. For one thing, all of those grammar Â things that I learned in grade school and pretty much went in one ear and out the other become more important. When I started learning Italian I wouldn’t have known a gerund if it bit me in the ass. The gerund is the verb form ending in â€“â€œ ingâ€. In English we use them a lot. â€œI am going to the storeâ€. They are activities that we are in the process of doing or will be doing in the near future. In Italian the simple present tense serves this purpose. â€œVadoâ€ – â€œI goâ€ is good enough. The gerund in this kind of context is only used for emphasis. The example that my Italian teacher gave is â€œ I’m talking on the telephone â€“ I can’t talk to you nowâ€. Â And how about those objects? Do I ever think about direct or indirect objects. No way. But learning Italian has forced me to revisit those long ago forgotten terms for grammatical structure.\n\nI first thought that the verbs are really complicated in Italian. Well, I still think that. I mean, how many past tenses does one really need? Italian has a bunch of them and they have very specific usages. Then as I start thinking about English. Well, we have a bunch of them too. â€œ I would have goneâ€ is a good example. These probably drive the speakers of other languages nuts when they are learning English. Of course there is also the dreaded congiuntivo. This is the speculative form of verbs and there is really no equivalent in English. One uses a different form of verb to say something like â€œI think that your mama is fatâ€. The â€œisâ€ in that sentence would require the congiuntivo form of the verb. An Italian teacher that I had some years ago compared congiuntivo it to entering another room of the language.\n\nI am starting to get a feel for the language. So I’m using some of the past tenses properly (most of the time) now. That feel is the same thing that I feel in English when I say to myself, â€œyou know, that just doesn’t sound rightâ€. So that is progress.\n\nAnother thing that I’ve always found difficult are the small words, articles, prepositions, pronouns. In Italian, for example, not only do you need to learn the pronouns but where they are placed in a sentence. Two can be combined into a single string and sometimes are attached to the ends of vowels. How crazy is that? Of course with time it will all somehow seem right when I have a better feel for the language.\n\nOne on line source that I have recently found and like a lot comes from the University of Texas in Austin and is called Radio Arlecchino. I especially like it when the narrator talks about the second person plural form of verbs â€“ that is, the plural form of â€œyouâ€. He says, well, if you’re from Texas, this is y’all.\n\nIn all I really am enjoying the study of this beautiful language and will share some more in future posts. I’d love to hear about any language learning experiences that anyone else has had so that’s what the comment space below is for."
