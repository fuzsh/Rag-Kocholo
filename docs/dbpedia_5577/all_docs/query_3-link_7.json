I ask you again sir, here and now under oath. Were you at any time a member of a crime organization headed by Michael Corleone? „ ~ Questadt to Frank Pentangeli.\n\nQuestadt is a minor but key antagonist in the 1974 film The Godfather Part II.\n\nHe was portrayed by the late Peter Donat.\n\nBiography[]\n\nQuestadt was a lawyer and member of the US Senate. He also worked for Hyman Roth. In the fall of 1958 he was present in Havana along with Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola, Patrick Geary and other influental people. He was seen sitting behind Roth during his meeting with Cuban dictator Batista.\n\nAfter a failed assassination attempt against him, Roth decided to put Michael Corleone away by using a different strategy. Since he also failed to assassinate Michael he decided to use his connections in order to put him in jail and destroy his crime organization so he orchestrated a Senate investigation against organized crime by having one of Michael Corleone's top men Frank Pentangeli confess about Michael's involvement in crime. Even though Frank initially agreed to do it (as he thought that Michael had betrayed him) he changed his mind after seeing his older brother along with Michael Corleone in the court. Questadt, along with the other Senators were shocked as they did not expect this and thus Roth's plan to eliminate Michael Corleone failed.\n\nQuestadt's involvement with Roth was revealed to Michael by his brother Fredo Corleone, who had just betrayed him to Roth. It is unknown if Michael tried something against Questadt later on."
