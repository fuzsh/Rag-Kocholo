        "text": "Historiographical critics often profiled Dionysius of Halicarnssus as an athenian classic imitator, sometimes as a recoverer of latin tradition, legendary or constitutional, either of some specific civil episodes of Roman history. Rather less often, a coherent idea of roman politics and its influence on international stage has been examined on his count. It is then possible, comparing his texts and that of other authors (specifically Cicero) to get a structured image of roman politics, reconstructed on historical basis, inspired to a model of corporative δημοκρατία. In the present study, we try to make clear this view through Dionysius hisorical work (Books II-VI).\n\nThroughout the Ptolemaic era, the Greek rulers of Egypt had to tackle complex issues pertaining to the nature of their dominion over peoples who were in many ways culturally, socially, and politically distinct. This paper examines how, despite these differences, Ptolemy II Philadelphus found a way to connect with both the Greek and Egyptian segments of his population by identifying himself with the god Dionysus. Although a Greek deity, Dionysus possessed specific associations that would have resonated with elements of Egyptian religion and culture. These connotations would have promoted the perception of Philadelphus as a legitimate and benevolent ruler capable of transcending cultural boundaries. The grand procession in the Ptolemaia festival has been characterized by Dorothy J. Thompson as a form of propaganda for the ruling family. Similarly, the various forms of evidence presented in this paper suggest that Dionysus would have been a convenient political vehicle in this syncretic environment. Such an approach on the part of Philadelphus was highly innovative and effective, and influenced the political identity assumed by later Ptolemaic rulers.\n\nThis chapter juxtaposes Quintus’ Posthomerica and Nonnus’ Dionysiaca in terms of the political and ideological positions they adopt towards Rome, and argues that the way they represent Hellenic and Roman identities is characteristic of the different cultural environments in which they were written. The first section is concerned with the characterisation of Aeneas and Sinon in Books 11-13 of the Posthomerica; Quintus’ depiction of these two characters reflects a contestation and re-negotiation between Roman and Greek identities, which is typical of the Second Sophistic period. The following section contrasts the treatment of the Pleiad Electra and the myths relevant to her in the two epics, in order to elucidate the differences between Quintus’ and Nonnus’ attitudes towards the Roman Empire. Finally, the third part of the paper turns to the question of Nonnus’ embrace of Rome and Roman ideology, and briefly examines the phenomenon of the collapse of traditional Hellenism in Late Antiquity, as it is expressed in Book 41 of the poem, the story of Beirut."
