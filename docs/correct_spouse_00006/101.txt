Washington: Eternal Sunshine... star Jim Carrey has said that he will never marry Jenny McCarthy, former Playboy playmate with whom he has been dating for a year.

The 45-year-old actor who has been married twice seems to have the belief that a marriage ends in divorce, which is why he has decided never to exchange the wedding vows with McCathy.

“We’re never getting married, but we’re never getting divorced, which is fantastic,” Femalefirst quoted him as saying.

“She’s just a wonderful lady and much deeper than she’s ever received credit for, and I’m very excited about her future.”

When asked whether he would like to give McCathy a ring to cement their love, Carrey replied, “I bought her a Chloe purse. Isn’t that good enough?”

Carrey was previously married to actress Lauren Holly and has a 19-year-old daughter, Jane, with his first wife, Melissa Womer.
