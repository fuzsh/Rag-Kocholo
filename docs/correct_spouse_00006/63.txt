Jenny McCarthy has opened up about Jim Carrey cutting all ties with her autistic son since their break-up, US Weekly reports.

In a recent interview with Howard Stern, the actress says: "I've tried to ask [Jim] numerous times [to see Evan], because my son still asks."

McCarthy dated Carrey, 50 years old, for over five years - during which time her son became quite attached to the Ace Ventura star.

Despite not directly contacting Carrey, McCarthy said she has used other channels to see if he'll consider seeing her son:

"I haven't [reached out directly]... I think that sometimes people need to take a real break from each other," she said.

"But as a mother, you just hope when you have a relationship with someone, it has nothing to do with the child when you break up."

Despite her son's struggle, McCarthy says she does not regret the decision to break up with Carrey - who has opened up about his lifelong struggle with depression on a few occasions.

"As you get older, you kind of get to see things more clearly... hopefully you get happier [over time], and I am so much happier."

In the mean time, McCarthy said she lets Evan watch some of Carrey's old movies and tells him that "someday you'll cross paths".

"It's hard. He's been in therapy. It's a process, he's working on it," she told Stern.

The actress is now in a relationship with Chicago Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher.
