        "text": "Jim Carrey is defending himself after ex-girlfriend Jenny McCarthy accused him of abandoning her autistic son, Evan, and forcing the 10-year-old to go to therapy.\n\n\"I will always do what I believe is in the best interest of Evan's well being,\" Carrey said in a statement released by his publicist to ABCNews.com today. \"It's unfortunate that Evan's privacy is not being considered. I love Evan very much and will miss him always.\"\n\nMcCarthy, who dated Carrey for more than five years, opened up about her struggles with Evan on Howard Stern's radio show Monday. \"I've tried to ask [Carrey] numerous times [to see Evan], because my son still asks,\" McCarthy said, adding that Evan tells her he misses Carrey \"almost weekly.\"\n\nMcCarthy said that while she doesn't communicate with the comedian directly, she's gone through \"channels\" to convince him to reconnect with her son.\n\n\"As a mother, you just hope when you have a relationship with someone, it has nothing to do with the child when you break up,\" she said. \"I tell [Evan] that someday you'll cross paths, meet again â€¦ [but] it's hard. He's been in therapy. It's a process, he's working on it.\"\n\nBut the Playboy model revealed that she lets Evan watch Carrey's movies and said she still loves her ex.\n\nMcCarthy, 39, and Carrey, 50, broke up in 2010. At the time, Carrey tweeted, \"I'm grateful 4 the many blessings we've shared and I wish her the very best! S'okay!\""
