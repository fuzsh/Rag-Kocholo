In way, Jim Carey is also kind of 90s as well\n\n...so is Jim.\n\nlol I think they'd make a cute couple. Both of them are crazy as fuck.\n\nThey seem like a weird, but fun(ny) couple...\n\njenny mcarthy is the most disgusting woman\n\nI fucking agree. I can't stand how apparently people love her. She's just gross and very untalented. :/\n\nyup.\n\nUgh - have you read her \"mothering\" books? She is also the stupidest woman ever.\n\nI agree... I'd want to knock their heads together like coconuts.\n\nicon! \"helloooooo im a carrrrrr\" i lovveee himmmm\n\nhe is very funneh!\n\nRIP :(\n\nHe could do way better. The woman has no class.\n\nWhat an odd couple.\n\nWhat...the fuck....\n\nNO!!!!!\n\nthey do seem like their sense of humor would match. i agree with not wanting to be stuck in a room with them though. seems like the would try to one up each other with stupid faces and shit\n\nI bet they are the most tediously dull company.\n\nAlso anybody who's seen a Jim Carrey interview knows he's very, very laid-back in real life but pretty much goes ape-shit in front of the cameras if the role calls for it. He's not like Tom Green, who is nutty all the time. He's an actor. He acts.\n\nI don't know if Jenny is the same way, but I can't picture them together if she's crazy and annoying in real life too.\n\niawtc\n\nWow.\n\nremember when jenny mcarthy was like, the big thing? singled out? haha, that was back when people's 15 minutes actually ENDED\n\nOh I know.. I love single out! she was awesome!\n\nI couldn't agree more with that last statement. Fading into obscurity is a lost art, sadly."
