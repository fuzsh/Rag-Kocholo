        "text": "Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Jim Carrey gave no hint of what led to his breakup with Jenny McCarthy in his short announcement via Twitter on Tuesday, but he punctuated it with his trademark smiling emoticon.\n\n\"Jenny and I have just ended our 5yr relationship. I'm grateful 4 the many blessings we've shared and I wish her the very best! S'okay! ?;^>\"\n\nThe comedic actor's next tweet was even cheerful:\n\n\"Be of good cheer folks! It's a beautiful world, and we're all gonna get what we need the most! ?;^>\"\n\nCarrey issued another message to fans Wednesday morning:\n\n\"I appreciate your well wishes today! All of you folks together make One Mighty Heart! Spanks! ?;^>}=<;\"\n\nMcCarthy acknowledged in 2008 that she and Carrey were living together but had no plans to marry. And in past interviews, they insisted that they didn't need \"a piece of paper\" to verify their relationship.\n\n\"We've both been married a couple times,\" Carrey told CNN's Larry King in December 2008. \"I like it the way it is, and I think she likes it the way it is. And that's all we need. I really don't, at this point of my life, feel like I need to have the approval of someone in the collar or a judge to tell us that our relationship is sacred.\"\n\nCarrey and McCarthy met at actor David Spade's birthday party at a time when he had no girlfriend, he told King. \"I was just knocking them off one after another. It was just sick.\n\n\"I just stood there in the middle of the room and kind of had that feeling like I was everything I felt,\" he said. \"And she looked at me, and she said, 'You just looked so peaceful that I had to come and talk to you.' \"\n\nCarrey said he found McCarthy to be \"very sweet,\" and they began dating.\n\n\"You're just lucky while it's there, you know. That's all, just lucky,\" he told King.\n\nCarrey joined McCarthy in a public campaign for autism awareness after her young son from her marriage to actor-director John Mallory Asher was diagnosed with autism.\n\nThe couple founded Generation Rescue, a nonprofit group to help children with autism under the banner \"autism is reversible.\"\n\nCarrey was a stand-up comedian before landing a regular job on the sketch comedy TV show \"In Living Color\" in 1990. His big-screen career took off with his \"Ace Ventura\" roles, followed by strong of box office hits that include \"The Cable Guy,\" \"Liar, Liar,\" \"The Truman Show\" and \"Man on the Moon.\"\n\nMcCarthy began her career as a Playboy model in 1994, which later led to acting roles. She also wrote a book on parenting."
