The former Playboy Playmate and current cohost of “The View” announced Wednesday that she and New Kid on the Block <b>Donnie Wahlberg</b> are engaged. McCarthy, 41, shared the news on the morning chat show, jumping up and down excitedly. She said Wahlberg enlisted the help of her 11-year son in the proposal. “This weekend, I was sitting with Donnie ... and he went into the other room and out came <b>Evan</b> with a card that said ‘Will’ and he handed it to me,” she said. “Then Evan ran away and Evan came in with a card that said ‘You.’ ... I just started crying and then Evan came back into the room with the word ‘Marry’ -- but spelled wrong.”",

        "text": "It appears Jenny McCarthy has the right stuff. The former Playboy Playmate and current cohost of “The View” announced Wednesday that she and New Kid Donnie Wahlberg are engaged. McCarthy, 41, shared the news on the morning chat show, jumping up and down excitedly. She said Wahlberg enlisted the help of her 11-year-old son, Evan, in the proposal. “This weekend, I was sitting with Donnie . . . and he went into the other room and out came Evan with a card that said ‘Will’ and he handed it to me,” she said. “Then Evan ran away, and Evan came in with a card that said ‘You.’ . . . I just started crying and then Evan came back into the room with the word ‘Marry’ — but spelled wrong.” By then, McCarthy knew what was happening. “The last time, Donnie came out with Evan and Donnie’s shirt said ‘Me’ . . . and he got down on his knee.” Awww. “Of course, I said ‘Yes,’ ” McCarthy said. “In that moment, Evan yelled, ‘I have another dad!’ and it made all of us cry.” This will be the second time around for both. Wahlberg, 44, was married to Kim Fey, with whom he has two children, and McCarthy was married to director John Asher. She was also previously in a relationship with actor Jim Carrey. In recent years, McCarthy has been best known for her very public crusade against vaccines, which she believes may be linked to her son’s autism."
