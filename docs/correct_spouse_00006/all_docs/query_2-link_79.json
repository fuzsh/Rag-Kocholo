        "text": "“It’s not fair to comment on really anything except that he is an amazing person and that’s all I have to say.” — Jenny McCarthy in June 2006.\n\nTalk about a role reversal! Normally, Jenny McCarthy can’t keep quiet about anything and Jim Carrey tries not to say a word about anything private.\n\nBut now, it looks like a brand new Jim as Access Hollywood’s Shaun Robinson found out when she sat down with Carrey for our new interview.\n\n“Are you a man in love?” Shaun asked Jim.\n\n“You know, I don’t like to flash those words around in public. They’re for her. But I am having a wonderful time,” Jim smiled.\n\n“Jenny McCarthy is a very great lady,” Shaun added.\n\n“She’s greater than people know,” Jim beamed.\n\nRare words of affection from a notoriously private Carrey, who stars in the upcoming thriller “The Number 23.” But the actor simply lit up talking about his girlfriend of over a year, the notoriously outgoing McCarthy.\n\n“She’s so public. You’re very private. How do you guys balance that?” Shaun asked. “Because she has talked about you in such affectionate ways.”\n\n“She is a person who is very much about encouraging the best in me and I in her and she’s just a wonderful lady and much deeper than she’s ever received credit for. I’m excited about her future,” he added.\n\nAnd Jim revealed that Jenny’s future includes him by her side, and that’s thanks in part to finding each other at the right time.\n\n“I think being with someone is better when you’re already complete yourself and I’m at a point in my life where I feel pretty complete,” Jim contends.\n\n“So if you had met her years ago, it would never have worked?” asked Shaun.\n\n“No, not at all. Not at all. I went through a lot of relationships that I believe were meant to define what I don’t want in another person and in myself and it refocused me on what I do want,” Jim said.\n\nAnd as for wanting a future walk down the aisle?\n\nAfter Jim and Jenny arrived together at Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes’ romantic Rome wedding last November, Shaun just had to ask if that inspired any “I do” ideas.\n\n“No, we’re never getting married,” Jim smirked.\n\n“No?” Shaun asked.\n\n“Nope, sorry,” he said.\n\n“You’re kidding. Why not?” Shaun followed up.\n\n“We’re never getting married, but we’re never getting divorced, which is fantastic,” he laughed.\n\n“Well get a ring at least,” Shaun told him.\n\n“Why’s that?” Jim asked.\n\n“The lady deserves at least a ring just to say you’ll be lifelong friends,” Shaun suggested.\n\n“I bought her a Chloe purse. Isn’t that good enough?” he grinned.\n\nCatch Jim in “The Number 23” when it hits theaters February 23."
