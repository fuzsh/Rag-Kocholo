I love Evan very much and will miss him always.\"\n\nAnd while McCarthy says Evan is in therapy to deal with Carrey's absence, she's found a different way to cope, dating Chicago Bears linebacker\n\nBrian Urlacher\n\n.\n\nJon Hamm recalls being\n\ntold he'd never be a TV star\n\nJon Hamm\n\nwas told by the head of a network, who we're guessing would rather not have his/her name made known, that he would never make it in Hollywood.\n\nr.\n\nAnd that wasn't his only setback.\n\n\"(I lived in) L.A. for 10 years, not working, having no money and no prospects. The days were kind of great; it was the long nights staring at the ceiling waiting for the phone to ring,\" he remembered. \"The uncertainty is always the difficult part, at least it has been for me.\"\n\nNot that the \"Mad Men\" star, who is seemingly everywhere nowadays, has that to cope with anymore.\n\nKhloe Kardashian starts\n\nfertility treatment process\n\nKhloe Kardashian\n\nis undergoing fertility treatment to have a baby.\n\n, so she visited a reproductive center in Beverly Hills, Calif., to get the process started.\n\nSo far, that consists of giving blood – with her sister Kim by her side – so her hormone levels can be evaluated.\n\nRobin Roberts diagnosed\n\nwith bone marrow disease\n\ne, a disease of the blood and bone marrow.\n\nRoberts will need a bone marrow transplant later this year – her sister will be the donor.\n\n\"My doctors tell me I'm going to beat this – and I know it's true,\" Roberts wrote on the GMA website.\n\n\"If you Google MDS, you may find some scary stuff, including statistics that my doctors insist don't apply to me. They say I'm younger (she's 51) and fitter than most people who confront this disease and will be cured.\"\n\nPortia de Rossi joins cast\n\nfor remake of 'The Munsters'\n\nPortia de Rossi\n\nNBC's \"Munsters\" reboot.\n\nEW reports that DeRossi joins\n\nJerry O'Connell\n\n(Herman),\n\nEddie Izzard\n\nas Grandpa,\n\nMason Cook\n\nas Eddie and\n\nCharity Wakefield\n\nas Marilyn.\n\n\"Mockingbird Lane\" is being developed by \"Pushing Daisies\" creator\n\nBryan Fuller\n\nand directed by \"X-Men's\"\n\nBryan Singer\n\n."
