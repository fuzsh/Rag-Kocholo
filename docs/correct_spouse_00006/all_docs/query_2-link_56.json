        "text": "Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy's breakup last week after five years of dating surprised many, especially because the two were so involved in the lives of each other's kids, but the cause might not be so surprising. Star magazine reports that Jenny left Jim because he refused to take his medication for depression, and if his increasingly erratic Twitter postings are any indication, Star might be correct.\n\nJim opened up to CNN in 2008 about his years-long struggles with depression, and said that while he had taken Prozac to treat his depression in the past, he didn't believe in taking the drug long-term. \"I think Prozac and things like that are very valuable to people for short periods of time,\" Jim said. \"But I believe if you're on them for an extended period of time, you never get to the problem. You never get to see what the problem is because everything's just kind of OK.\" Did Jim Carrey And Jenny McCarthy Get Married?\n\nJim also told CNN that he was treating his depression with vitamins, and said that Tom Cruise was partially right when he went on his anti-medication rants back in 2005. All righty then. Star quotes friends of Jim and Jenny as saying that Jim would disappear for days at a time. \"It was such an emotional roller coaster for her,\" an unnamed source told the magazine. \"When he'd get down, he'd just disappear. He would hide out in a hotel or one of his homes, not answering her calls.\" Depression in Context: Strategies for Guided Action\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich can't be good for a relationship. Jenny, for her part, had been a part of Jim's anti-drug crusade, with her own well-publicized petitions against vaccinations for kids, but it sounds like Jim's refusal to take care of his own mental health was a dealbreaker for her. Which is sad. Depression is a real illness that its sufferers need to treat, and it usually doesn't go away. Yeah. How's that for a downer?\n\nVia Celebitchy, Star and Popeater.
