        "text": "He wrote: “Jenny and I have just ended our 5yr relationship. I’m grateful for the many blessings we’ve shared and I wish her the very best. S’okay!\n\n“Be of good cheer folks! It’s a beautiful world, and we’re all gonna get what we need the most! (sic)”\n\nMcCarthy also took to twitter to reveal news of their split, saying she was “grateful” for their time together and would continue to be “committed” to his daughter Jane, 22.\n\nShe said: “I’m so grateful for the years Jim and I had together. I will stay committed to Jane and will always keep Jim as a leading man in my heart.”\n\nIn February, Jenny revealed her excitement at the birth of Jim’s daughter Jane’s first son Jackson.\n\nShe said: “I think I’m going to be an awesome grandma, the world’s best is what I say.”\n\nJust last month former Playboy model Jenny claimed she would marry Jim, but only for tax reasons.\n\nShe said: “We say ‘never’, but I don’t know. Maybe for tax purposes, someday, when we are old. That’s why we keep joking – like, when we are 70! But for now, we’re fine. We are really fine!”\n\nJim has been married twice before, first to waitress Melissa Womer – Jane’s mother - from whom he split in 1995, and to his ‘Dumb and Dumber’ co-star Lauren Holly, which lasted less than a year after they tied the knot in 1996.\n\nMcCarthy was previously married to actor-and-director John Mallory Asher in 1999.\n\nThe couple had one son, Evan, born in 2002, before they split in 2005."
