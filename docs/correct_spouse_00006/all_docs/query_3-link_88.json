Isn't that good enough?\"\n\nCarrey was previously married to actress Lauren Holly and has a 19-year-old daughter, Jane, with his first wife, Melissa Womer.\n\nMcCarthy filed for divorce from film director John Asher in August 2005, after six years of marriage. They have a four-year-old son, Evan.\n\n- BANG! SHOWBIZ"
