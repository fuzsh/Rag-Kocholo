        "text": "LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNA: Kim Kardashian's SKIMS kept up with its '90s-inspired theme with a new swimwear commercial starring Jenny McCarthy and Carmen Electra. For an extremely sizzling SKIMS promotion on Thursday, July 6, 2023, Electra and McCarthy looked stunning in scant string bikinis as they played during a car wash. MTV superstars Electra, 51, and McCarthy, 50, posed for the camera while washing vehicles, revealing their incredibly toned frames and abundant cleavage in tiny two-pieces. As per Daily Mail, McCarthy pouted and posed for the camera, rubbing soap over her cleavage while flaunting thick curls.\n\nBefore saying \"I do\" to her present husband, American actress, model, and TV personality Jenny McCarthy was previously in a few notable relationships and also married in the past. One of the notable relationships she was a part of was with the famous comedian and actor, Jim Carrey. However, now McCarthy and her American singer-songwriter and actor husband Donnie Wahlberg have become the epitome of a picture-perfect celebrity couple for the past nine years. Indeed, their love story is so sweet that it could rival the best fairy tales.\n\nWho is Jenny McCarthy dating?\n\nAccording to his IMDb profile, McCarthy's husband Donald Edmond \"Donnie\" Wahlberg was born on August 17, 1969, in Boston, Massachusetts. Donnie is the brother of actor Mark Wahlberg. Before making his big screen debut, Donnie founded the boy band New Kids on the Block, popularly known as NKOTB.\n\nDonnie made his big-screen debut as a \"tough guy\" gangster in Mickey Rourke's urban drama 'Bullet' (1996), which was shot in 1994 but didn't come out until two years later. After a few TV movies, he eventually landed a leading role in 'Southie' (1998), as a wayward Irish-American son who returns to his rough-and-tumble Boston neighborhood.\n\nDonnie has since trademarked his unfiltered vitality into various movies, including 'Triggermen' (2002), 'Dreamcatcher' (2003), 'Saw II' (2005), 'Annapolis' (2006), 'Saw III' (2006), 'Saw IV' (2007), and 'Zookeeper' (2011). He has also played the protagonist in a number of gritty TV series, including 'Blue Bloods' (2010), 'The Kill Point' (2007), 'Return of the Mac' (2017), and 'Runaway' (2006).\n\nDonnie is married to Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg right now. He has two sons -- Xavier and Elijah -- with his ex-wife Kim Fey. He was once a teen heartthrob who appeared to be headed down a terrible and dangerous path following his initial fame, but somehow avoided the usual dangers of drugs and self-destruction and has since proven himself to be an actor with \"the right stuff.\"\n\nHow Jenny met Donnie?\n\nDonnie's 2013 guest appearance on 'The Jenny McCarthy Show' brought the two together for the first time. They had an instant connection, and their chemistry was so intense that they began dating after only a few months. They didn't try to disguise their relationship and even kissed on live television to ring in the new year. And the following year, Jenny made her engagement to the NKOTB member public on 'The View'.\n\nMcCarthy once remarked about her current marriage to Donnie, whom she has been with since 2014, \"Donnie has been amazing. I thought for sure I would be going at it alone, like many parents who have kids with autism do, usually 80 percent of them [are] divorced. So the fact that I found the love of my life for me, and Evan found a stepdad in his life, I feel like I can’t ask for anything else.\"\n\n'Back in the ’90s'\n\nMcCarthy and Electra pose alongside a cherry-red Ferrari in a steamy car wash scene, along with electric guitars and melting ice cream. The former 'Playboy' models had previously \"faced off\" in MTV's claymation series 'Celebrity Deathmatch' and collaborated on McCarthy's 2005 film 'Dirty Love'. In a press release, McCarthy exclaimed, \"The energy on set was incredible, especially shooting alongside Carmen, who looks amazing! It felt like we were back in the ’90s, and years later we’re still having fun!\""
