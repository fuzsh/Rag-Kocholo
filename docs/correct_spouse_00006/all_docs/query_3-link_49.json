        "text": "Who knew that when I sat down with Jenny McCarthy, host of the NBC reality dating show, Love in the Wild, that we'd be gossiping like high school girls talking boys, relationships, and love vs. career? And yet, it was one of the most fun and enlightening conversations I've had in quite a long time.\n\nJenny has had quite a few high-profile relationships (Jim Carrey, anyone?), and she's learned some pretty important lessons from each experience. She even admits there's someone new in the picture (according to reports, that someone is the Chicago Bears' Brian Urlacher). So when I was telling her about a recent situation of mine, she actually gave the most logical advice. I just have one question: Jenny, when are you available for our next session?\n\nGlamour: What I love is that you are so vocal about finding a guy's guy. You've said—and it's true, if this is the type of guy you want—that those types exist in the Midwest.\n\nJenny McCarthy: It's true. A man's man. Out here they borrow your make-up, and they are so metrosexual. It's definitely not in California, if that's what you're looking for, but it depends on your personal taste. I'm not an East Coast girl either. I really like the meat and potatoes kind of guy. I wrote an article actually for the [Chicago] Sun Times, but now I have to kind of change it, called 'Sex in the Wrong City,' and it was all about the guys in LA vs. the guys in the Midwest. It's everything we're talking about, and why Midwest guys are the best guys. This was before anything else has taken place.\n\nGlamour: So you're dating someone now?\n\nJenny: [Nods her head up and down yes]. I'm interested in someone right now.\n\nGlamour: And I'm guessing they don't live in LA, which is why this proves your theory.\n\nJenny: That's right.\n\nGlamour: Well, that brings me to my next question. Do you move for love if you haven't found it yet, based on where you might think you have the best chance?\n\nJenny: It's an easy question and an easy answer. Whichever one is your top priority. There's some women that go, 'I will quit, I will move, I will do anything for romance.' And then there's women that feel like, 'In order for me to feel like my true self, I need to have a job and an occupation, etc.' So my advice is to send out the waves of, 'I need to stay in this position, but I need a guy from somewhere else, that we can still make it work somehow.' So it depends on your priorities.\n\nGlamour: What is your best relationship advice?\n\nJenny: Well, I have dating advice and relationship advice. My dating advice is to really see how they treat the service industry. So I pick up on that as a sign of whether they get a next date or not. Then, in a relationship I would say try to be your authentic self as much as possible, otherwise it just sucks later on.\n\nGlamour: What do you think about guys who are so interested in you, and then do a 180 and drop off the face of the earth, only to come back months later like nothing happened?\n\nJenny: No! You don't. And it's really, really hard. If there is a disconnection, and it's on their part that they disconnected first, you do not let that plug outlet come back near you. You keep it disconnected and that's it. Mind you, if you were initially using them for sex, then fine. But most girls aren't. Most girls are looking for a connection. If you're looking for more, then you're screwed. Literally. The only time I would say it might be an exception is if you find your high school sweetheart on Facebook or something, and you are now 36, and you've kind of grown up, and you can kind of see if that person has evolved. Because many times there was an initial connection but you had to go through all these other experiences. But if only a few months have gone by, then no, I'm out of there.\n\nWell, what do you guys think? I'm totally on board with Jenny's advice. I want to know how things have worked out for you if a guy has tried to crawl back into the picture after they disconnected first. Did it work out the second time?\n\nMore TV Love:\n\nSecrets of Emily Maynard's Upcoming *Bachelorette Season!
