        "text": "He said FaceTime is nearly as good as being together in person. “It’s great. It’s like, why not? Right? We’re going to miss each other, why wake up saying, ‘Oh my God, I missed you.’” he added. “I tell her if you wake up at three in the morning and can’t sleep, just tap me on the shoulder through the phone and I’ll wake up and hang out with you for a while.”\n\nWahlberg has been married to McCarthy since 2014. McCarthy, now 51, rose to fame as a Playboy model, but transitioned into something of a media magnate in recent years, per Forbes.\n\nHere’s what Jenny McCarthy has been up to …\n\nWhat did Jenny McCarthy become famous for?\n\nPer the same source, McCarthy skilfully managed to transition from modelling to TV and then acting in the years that followed.\n\nWhat has Jenny McCarthy been up to?\n\nMcCarthy went on to star in various films and TV shows including Scream 3, Dirty Love and John Tucker Must Die, and became a co-host on ABC’s The View and MTV dating show Singled Out.\n\nMcCarthy has also written numerous books, including Baby Laughs: The Naked Truth About the First Year of Mommyhood and Healing and Preventing Autism: A Complete Guide.\n\nThese days, she’s busy as a judge on Fox’s musical competition show The Masked Singer and taking care of her family.\n\nDoes Jenny McCarthy have any kids?\n\nAccording to People, McCarthy has one son – Evan Joseph Asher – whom she shares with her ex-husband John Asher. She told Forbes that her son inspires much of her work, including her books.\n\n“My son was diagnosed with autism at age three and I was successfully into my 3rd book. Autism is a full-time job. Most kids require 40 hours of ABA therapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy,” she told the publication. “Even if I was the biggest movie star in the world, I would have to quit during the early years. Early intervention is everything so I knew exactly where I was supposed to be with my son. And the universe/God allowed me to be home and work on him while writing the next six books that followed.”\n\nWhere does Jenny McCarthy live?\n\nDid Jim Carrey date Jenny McCarthy?\n\nBack in 2005, after her divorce from first husband and baby daddy John Asher, McCarthy dated comedian Jim Carrey for five years, per Us Weekly.\n\n“I’m so grateful for the years Jim and I shared together,” McCarthy told the publication at the time. “I will continue to be in his daughter’s life and will always keep Jim as a leading man in my heart.”"
