        "text": "Jim Carrey doesn't want to marry again.\n\nThe 'Dumb and Dumber To' actor - who was previously wed to Lauren Holly for a year and Melissa Womer for eight years - insists he won't ''voluntarily'' tie the knot again, even if he meets the perfect woman.\n\nAsked by Howard Stern if he would consider marriage for a third time, he said: ''I just don't see it as necessary at this point. Is it really sacred? I don't know.''\n\nThen asked what he would do if the right woman came along, he added: ''I can't say that I know how I would feel if I meet somebody that knocks my head off.\n\n''I can't make hard fast rules about the future but I wouldn't voluntarily go that way.''\n\nThe 52-year-old star - who dated Jenny McCarthy for five years until 2010 - is wary of getting romantically involved with anyone else in the spotlight again because the relationship overshadows his career.\n\nHe explained: ''If you hook up with someone who is famous, you become a sellable commodity and that's the most important thing in those magazines.\n\n''It's not what you're doing in the movie. It's who you are with, what are you doing, are you breaking up?''"
