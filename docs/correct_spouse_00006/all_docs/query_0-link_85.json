        "text": "Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy have announced that they are splitting up after five years together. \"I'm so grateful for the years Jim and I shared together,\" Jenny said in a statement. \"I will continue to be in his daughter's life and will always keep Jim as a leading man in my heart.\" The actor's rep confirmed the news, saying: \"Jim and Jenny have recently decided to end their five year relationship. They are grateful for the many blessings they have shared and wish each other the very best.\" The Mask star repeated the message on his Twitter page: \"Jenny and I have just ended our 5yr relationship. I'm grateful 4 the many blessings we've shared and I wish her the very best! S'okay! ?;^>.\" The pair had always been outspoken about their desire NOT to get married but Jenny recently hinted that nuptials may be on the cards. \"We say 'never,' but I don't know,\" she said. \"Maybe for tax purposes, someday, when we are old.\" Jim Carrey has been married twice before, while Jenny has a seven-year-old son Evan with her ex-husband director John Asher.
