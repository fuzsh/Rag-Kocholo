I used to opportunity to let her know, and everyone else there, how much of an amazing man her husband is.\n\nI’ve not met such a kind hearted, genuine man who doesn’t even think about putting himself second and doing all he can for his fellow man.\n\nFrom being the first person to put their name on one of my rally permits (taking responsibility for anyone breaking rules which was bound to happen.)\n\nBeing arrested, realising he could get free and taking that chance to outrun them.\n\nTurning up at every single rally I did, rain, sleet, heat, 100,000 or 10 people - he was there.\n\nThe first national strike event in Canberra when the whole country was locked down, Michael was the only person who risked the borders and arrived from out of state. Not the only speaker, not the only person in politics….. THE ONLY PERSON.\n\nThat night I was able to spend some time with him, hear his stories, his beliefs, his morals, and I honestly didn’t know such an Angel of a man existed.\n\nThis man is an icon. Please support him and the Heart Party in the next election. And yes, his wife Barbara is great too.\n\n#sydney #rally #protest\".",
