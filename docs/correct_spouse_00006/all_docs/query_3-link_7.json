        "text": "Jenny McCarthy and Donnie Wahlberg started dating in July 2013 after meeting on her VH1 talk show, The Jenny McCarthy Show. The couple quickly fell head over heels for each other and announced their engagement in April 2014. Just a few months later, in August 2014, they tied the knot during an intimate ceremony at the Hotel Baker in St. Charles, Illinois. McCarthy and Wahlberg have been going strong ever since, proving that their love can stand the test of time.\n\nDonnie Wahlberg, an American actor, singer, and producer, rose to fame in the late 1980s as a member of the popular boy band New Kids on the Block. After the group disbanded, Wahlberg transitioned into acting and is best known for his roles in the Saw film series and the television drama Blue Bloods. Besides his relationship with McCarthy, Wahlberg was previously married to Kim Fey, with whom he shares two sons, Xavier and Elijah. Donnie's famous brother, Mark Wahlberg, has also contributed to his notoriety in the entertainment industry.\n\nIn April 2012, Jenny McCarthy began dating NFL player Brian Urlacher, linebacker for the Chicago Bears. The two were spotted on several dates and events together, causing quite a buzz in the media. However, their relationship was not meant to last, as they called it quits in August 2012 after just a few months together. Despite the breakup, McCarthy and Urlacher remained good friends and continued to support each other's careers.\n\nBrian Urlacher is a retired professional football player who played his entire 13-year career with the Chicago Bears. He is widely considered one of the best linebackers in NFL history, earning eight Pro Bowl selections, five All-Pro honors, and the 2005 AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year award. Outside of his relationship with McCarthy, Urlacher was previously married to Laurie Urlacher, with whom he has three children. He is also well-known for his work in philanthropy, particularly his efforts through the Brian Urlacher Foundation.\n\nJenny McCarthy and entertainment lawyer Paul Krepelka started dating around January 2011. Despite their busy schedules, the couple managed to make their long-distance relationship work, with McCarthy flying back and forth from Los Angeles to Boston. However, distance eventually took its toll on the relationship, and they decided to end things amicably in August 2011. McCarthy and Krepelka have since moved on but remain friendly.\n\nPaul Krepelka is a prominent entertainment lawyer based in Boston, Massachusetts. Although he is not famous in the traditional sense, his high-profile relationships and clientele have put his name on the map. Krepelka specializes in representing clients within the sports and entertainment industries, helping them navigate complex legal matters such as contracts, endorsements, and intellectual property rights. While he has no other known high-profile relationships, his time with McCarthy certainly brought him some attention in the media.\n\nJenny McCarthy began dating fitness model Jason Toohey in August 2010 after meeting through mutual friends. The couple seemed to be a perfect match, often spotted hitting the gym and attending events together. However, their relationship was relatively short-lived, as they decided to part ways in December 2010. McCarthy later admitted that the breakup was due to her not being ready for a serious relationship at the time.\n\nJason Toohey is a successful fitness model and personal trainer, known for his incredible physique and dedication to health and wellness. His career as a model has landed him numerous high-profile gigs with brands such as Under Armour and Muscle & Fitness Magazine. Apart from his relationship with McCarthy, there isn't much information available about Toohey's personal life or any other high-profile relationships he may have had. Regardless, his time in the spotlight with McCarthy certainly helped boost his career in the fitness industry.\n\nJenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey began dating in December 2005, after forming a connection at a party. The couple was very public about their relationship, often sharing affectionate moments on the red carpet and attending various events together. After five years of dating, McCarthy and Carrey announced their split in April 2010, citing that they had grown apart but would remain friends. Their breakup was reportedly amicable, with both parties focusing on their respective careers and families.\n\nJim Carrey is a renowned actor and comedian, having starred in numerous blockbuster films such as Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, The Mask, Dumb and Dumber, and The Truman Show. He has earned two Golden Globe awards for his work in The Truman Show and Man on the Moon. Carrey's personal life has also been a subject of interest; he was previously married to actress Melissa Womer, with whom he has a daughter, Jane, and later married his Dumb and Dumber co-star Lauren Holly. Additionally, Carrey was in a long-term relationship with actress Renee Zellweger before his relationship with McCarthy.\n\nJenny McCarthy and John Mallory Asher crossed paths on the set of the film Diamonds in 1998, where Asher was directing and McCarthy was acting. The couple began dating and eventually got engaged in January 1999. They tied the knot later that year in September and welcomed their son, Evan, in May 2002. Unfortunately, their marriage ultimately ended in a divorce, finalized in September 2005, with both McCarthy and Asher putting their focus on co-parenting their son.\n\nJohn Mallory Asher is an accomplished actor, director, and screenwriter. Some of his most notable acting roles include Gary Wallace on the television series Weird Science and roles in films such as Double Dragon and Kounterfeit. As a director, Asher has worked on several projects, including the films Tooken and Po. Apart from his marriage to McCarthy, he was previously married to actress Vanessa Lee Asher from 1994 to 1996. Although Asher's career may not be as publicized as some of his high-profile relationships, his work within the entertainment industry has undeniably made an impact."
