        "text": "After Jim Carrey was interrupted while almost proposing to longtime girlfriend Jenny McCarthy on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” this week, Access Hollywood’sShaun Robinson caught up with the couple at the premiere of Jim’s new movie, “Yes Man,” to find out if “yes” was a word Jenny would be telling Jim anytime soon.\n\n“We are already married in our hearts,” Jenny told Access.\n\nVIEW THE PHOTOS: Star Couples\n\n“So if he asked you, you would say, ‘no,’ instead of ‘yes?’” Shaun asked.\n\n“I would say, ‘You are joking, because you know me better,’” Jenny said. “And, we love each other as is.”\n\nVIEW THE PHOTOS: The Latest Star Sightings\n\nDespite the unlikelihood of a trip down the aisle for the couple, Jenny and Jim are very much a family, especially when it comes to celebrating the holidays.\n\nJim told Access that he loves to dress up like Santa for Jenny’s 6-year-old son Evan.\n\n“I pretended I was coming down the chimney,” Jim said of last year’s Christmas celebration. “I was going insane in the living room. But, he was at a distance and he was a little — it was a little shocking for [Evan.]”\n\nVIEW THE PHOTOS: Hollywood Moms\n\nJim, who is known for going to great lengths in all of his roles, appears to do the same when it comes to playing St. Nick.\n\n“He even got on the roof and pretended to land the sleigh,” Jenny explained.\n\n“That’s a time honored tradition in my family,” Jim continued. “You got to go to the roof. You got to take the jingle bells on the roof and trump around.”\n\n“I go all the way with the illusion,” he added.\n\nRelated Content from AccessHollywood.com:\n\nPLAY IT NOW: Jim Carrey Proposes To Jenny McCarthy On ‘Ellen’\n\nPLAY IT NOW: ‘Yes Man’ Premiere, Los Angeles"
