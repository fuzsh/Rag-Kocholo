I’m grateful 4 the many blessings we’ve shared and I wish her the very best! S’okay! ?;^>,” tweeted the “Ace Ventura” star.\n\nPHOTOS: CELEB COUPLES WE LOVED\n\nMcCarthy confirmed the split minutes later on her Twitter account, saying, “Im so grateful for the years Jim and I had together. I will stay committed to Jane and will always keep Jim as a leading man in my heart.”\n\nCarrey’s rep also confirmed the split to Entertainment Tonight.\n\nCarrey, 48, is no stranger to announcing big news on Twitter, as the star recently posted about becoming a grandfather when daughter Jane, 22, gave birth to her first child in February.\n\nCarrey and McCarthy, 37, have been prominent activists for autism, as McCarthy’s son Evan has been diagnosed with the disorder."
