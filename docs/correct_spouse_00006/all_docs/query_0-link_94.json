        "text": "It’s taken Jenny McCarthy 40 years to make love.\n\nThe former “View” co-host, 41, told Page Six on Thursday that she never experienced making love until she met her husband, Donnie Wahlberg.\n\n“No doubt. No doubt,” the outspoken mother of one said when asked if Walhberg, 45, was her first love-making partner.\n\nMcCarthy’s dating history includes a four-year relationship with manager Ray Manzella; a six-year marriage to John Asher, with whom she had a son, Evan, in 2002; a five-year relationship with Jim Carrey; and a brief courtship with former Chicago Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher that ended in 2012.\n\nThe “Dirty, Sexy, Funny with Jenny McCarthy” SiriusXM host has not been shy about her sex life and said that sex has gotten better with age.\n\n“I never thought it would be,” she said. “I thought I would become insecure as I got older. But as you get older, you know what you like. Then you learn what making love really is when you meet your soulmate.”\n\n“But with Donnie it’s wonderful,” she added, as Wahlberg quietly sat next to her.\n\nThe pair, who have been together since 2013, got engaged in April of this year. They exchanged vows in Chicago on Aug. 31. Evan walked her down the aisle.\n\nLike McCarthy, this is Wahlberg’s second marriage.\n\n“There is no challenging parts,” she said of the couple’s relationship. “Every night, I have that feeling like when your mom tells you a friend can sleep over that night. I feel like it’s a gift every night I go to bed with him.”\n\n“Dirty, Sexy, Funny with Jenny McCarthy” airs daily on SiriusXM beginning on Monday, Oct. 27, at 10 a.m."
