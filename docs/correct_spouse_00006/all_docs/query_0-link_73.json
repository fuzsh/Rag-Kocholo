        "text": "Jim Carrey has responded to some trash-talking his ex-girlfriend Jenny McCarthy did during a Howard Stern interview earlier this week, denying her jabs that he hasn't wanted anything to do with her son Evan since their split. And we all know it's every male role model's job to continue to take care of his ex's kids who aren't even his, two years after breaking up with the woman.\n\n\"I will always do what I believe is in the best interest of Evan's well being,\" Carrey told the New York Daily News in response to her Monday comments. \"It's unfortunate that Evan's privacy is not being considered. I love Evan very much and will miss him always.\" That reaction was forced by her rather unnecessary dialogue calling out the actor, as if he was some sort of monster for not visiting the boy.\n\n\"I've tried to ask (Jim) numerous times (to see Evan), because my son still asks,\" McCarthy told Stern on Monday. \"I haven't (reached out directly) ... I think that sometimes people need to take a real break from each other. But I still love him. I think you can love people from a distance and respect him. But as a mother, you just hope when you have a relationship with someone, it has nothing to do with the child when you break up.\"\n\nBreaking up with someone after five years is a pretty direct message that you need more than just some time off, but whatever. She didn't have to go on to say the 10-year-old has been in therapy over the whole thing. Then again, she claims her son's alleged on-again, off-again autism is the result of vaccinations, too, so we can understand Jim getting testy. Maybe Evan's dad, actor John Mallory Asher, should say something about all this.\n\n[Photo: The couple in 2008. Getty Images]"
