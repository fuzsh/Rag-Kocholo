        "text": "Jenny McCarthy is still glowing after saying \"I do\" to \"Blue Bloods\" star Donnie Wahlberg over Labor Day weekend.\n\nThe couple exchanged vows outside of Chicago in front of family and friends, including McCarthy's 12-year-old son, Evan, who played a big role in the big day: He walked McCarthy down the aisle.\n\n\"I looked at my son just before I walked down the aisle and I saw his big blue eyes looking up at me in his little tuxedo and I thought there's nothing that can go wrong, nothing that can spoil this moment,\" McCarthy told CBS News.\n\nMcCarthy's son also had a big part in the wedding reception.\n\n\"Evan gave the most beautiful toast talking about his new step dad and how he's so grateful about how I've found someone I love and who he loves and was so excited to start a new family,\" she said. \"So those types of moments don't get any better.\"\n\n\"I thought I was going to be more nervous than I was. But I wasn't,\" she continued about her wedding. \"I really kind of stayed present and just had so much gratitude. We walked down the aisle. I locked eyes with Donnie. We didn't take our eyes off of each other. We danced the night away.\"\n\nThe pair started dating last year and announced their engagement in April. They initially thought they would get married in 2015. But that quickly changed based on venue availability.\n\n\"The place we wanted to get married at was the Hotel Baker in Chicago -- St. Charles -- this little town in my neighborhood,\" McCarthy, 41, said. \"And they said Labor Day opened up and I thought, 'Oh my gosh, that's three months away. Do I have enough time?' Really, it meant as a bride, 'Do I have enough time?' I'm a big emotional eater. I'm like, 'What am I going to do? I'm going to eat myself out of my dress.' I took a lot of advice from friends. One of my friends tried something called SkinnyStix and I was hooked immediately and that really helped me not overeat.\"\n\nMcCarthy, who's now a spokesperson for SkinnyStix, also ran on the treadmill for 45 minutes a couple of times a week and spent time getting into the right mindset.\n\n\"I was spiritually involved by writing out the ceremony,\" she said. \"That really helped me get ready to....marry the man of my dreams. So besides taking care of myself physically, I took care of myself spiritually. And gave Donnie the best of me on that day.\"\n\nIt's the second marriage for both McCarthy and Wahlberg. Wahlberg, 45, was married to Kim Fey from 1999-2008. They have two children together. McCarthy was married to director John Asher from 1995-2005. They are parents to Evan. McCarthy dated Jim Carrey after her divorce before getting into a relationship with Wahlberg.\n\n\"We both come from really similar pasts -- families -- Irish, hardworking, lower middle class,\" said McCarthey when asked why she and the New Kids on the Block star work. \"He started supporting his family at a very early age. I did the same. We both wrote checks to pay off our parent's bills....We both have had ups and downs in our careers. We both had children. We both had a divorce. We both stayed in this business. We're both workaholics and passionate. The most important is that we have a spiritual connection. We're really involved with self-realization and self-improvement.\"\n\nMcCarthy parted ways with ABC's \"The View\" earlier this year and is gearing up to host her own daily radio for SiriusXM dubbed \"Dirty Sexy Funny.\"\n\n\"I'm so grateful for that because I did a month trial with Sirius and it went so well that they had called and said, 'We want to offer you a Monday through Friday show and have you follow Howard Stern.' So, Howard would pass the baton and announce your show.' I thought, 'That doesn't get any better in radio.' And considering I love to talk and I kind of have more of a mindset for a platform that allows me to say what I want to say, it was the perfect marriage.\"\n\nCoinciding with the radio gig is McCarthy's current comedy tour -- also dubbed \"Dirty Sexy Funny.\" Three years in the making, the outing features performances by a host of female comics hand-picked by McCarthy.\n\nIt's similar in scope to what McCarthy plans to do with her radio show.\n\n\"I think you're going to be quite surprised and happy to see kind of the old Jenny back,\" she said."
