        "text": "Love comes in all shapes, sizes, types, and forms, all of which are worthy of celebration this and every Valentine’s Day. Luckily, there's a plethora of cinematic options to share with whomever you have a special bond with, be it a significant other, a friend, or a family member.\n\nFrom charming comedies to riveting dramas, check out some options to curl up with and toast to the thing that makes the world go round.\n\nTO WATCH WITH FRIENDS\n\nBridesmaids\n\nYes, weddings are a beautiful union of two souls. They can also be a stress test for every relationship in one's life. The wedding at the center of Bridesmaids puts the friendship of leads Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph in the pressure cooker, as it opens up their relationship to new people, including breakout scene-stealer Melissa McCarthy. It's a hilarious, raunchy and occasionally stomach-turning comedy that proves that even when your friends' lives change or move forward, the real ones never leave you behind.\n\nBooksmart\n\nMuch like Bridesmaids, the hilarious and sweet comedy Booksmart features a friendship tested by a major life change. This time, high schoolers Molly (Beanie Feldstein) and Amy (Kaitlyn Dever) embark on an all-night adventure to make up for a lack of high school partying before graduation. Though the girls have been BFFs for years, they find there's still more to learn about one another and, despite some ups and downs, they’re closer than ever by the time diplomas are handed out.\n\nHow to Be Single\n\nDakota Johnson, Rebel Wilson, Leslie Mann and Alison Brie play characters all in search of love in New York City, with varying strategies and results. At first glance, the movie seems to push forward the importance of finding a significant other, but eventually some of the characters learn that love comes in many forms. With an excellent, sometimes wry sense of humor, the movie has relatable moments for everyone, no matter where they are in their quest for love — or just a good time.\n\nI Love You, Man\n\nMale friendship is often treated as a joke, and this movie leans into that stereotype to actually show why it’s important. When Peter (Paul Rudd) gets engaged, he realizes he has no male friends and struggles to find some until he meets a quirky investor (Jason Segel). Their friendship really takes off quickly, threatening the engagement, but all parties come together in the end, with a renewed appreciation for healthy male bonding.\n\nSwingers\n\n\"Vegas, baby! VEGAS!\" Swingers is so much more than the oft-quoted trip to Vegas sequence, which is intended to get heartbroken Mike (Jon Favreau, who also wrote the script) to move on from his ex, but ultimately fails. Mike's friends have his back though as he falters in making new connections (like in the painful yet hilarious answering machine meltdown scene). With their support, he finally figures out how to move forward in his love life. The iconic buddy comedy is a time capsule of '90s Los Angeles that features an undeniably \"money\" Vince Vaughn as Mike's loyal friend Trent.\n\nThe Wood\n\nThe lasting impact of friendship takes center stage in this coming-of-age comedy starring Omar Epps, Richard T. Jones and Taye Diggs. When Diggs' character goes missing ahead of his wedding, it's up to Epps and Jones to find him and get him to the altar. Along the way, the group recounts shared memories from their childhood in Inglewood, California, reminiscing on their awkward teenage years and the lessons that have taken them through life.\n\nTO WATCH WITH SIGNIFICANT OTHERS\n\nCarol\n\nGreat love can often be stifled by time and circumstances, as is the case for Carol (Cate Blanchett) and Therese (Rooney Mara) in this romantic drama. Carol and Therese meet during the holidays at the department store where Therese works and soon strike up a relationship, but their romance is constrained not only by the time period they live in (the 1950s), but their own class, age and personality differences. The Todd Haynes-directed film features, among many other stunning attributes, beautiful cinematography by Ed Lachman.\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n\nWhen Joel (Jim Carrey, in one of his best dramatic roles) decides to have his memories of his ex Clementine (Kate Winslet) erased after she has already done so, he finds that love and memory aren't as simple as black and white. To some, this sci-fi-tinged romance is a testament to the power of love. To others, it’s a bummer reminder of how hard it is to find that love. Ultimately, the story lands somewhere in the middle, working as a reminder that all relationships come with both good and bad times. Written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Michel Gondry, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is regarded by many as one of the greatest films of the 2000s.\n\nLove and Basketball\n\nAll's fair in Love and Basketball. This beloved classic stars Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps as Monica and Quincy, respectively, two aspiring basketball players who share a passion for the game of basketball on the court, and eventually a love for each other. From childhood to adulthood, the film follows the pair through life's ups and downs — and how they come together when their dreams threaten to tear them apart.\n\nThe Notebook\n\nThe sweeping story of Allie and Noah (Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling), soulmates from different sides of the tracks who find each other through all sorts of struggles is an all-time favorite for lovers. It would be quicker to name a scene in this tearjerker that isn't a classic. The movie tugs at the heartstrings, sometimes painfully, but as with all great loves, the heartbreak and pain are worth it for the time, however long or short, you have with your one true person.\n\nSilver Linings Playbook\n\nA rom-com with a healthy dash of drama, Silver Linings Playbook digs into the complicated nature of romance when faced with life's very real difficulties. Bradley Cooper's Pat and Jennifer Lawrence's Tiffany both experience mental health struggles that they work through together as their romantic relationship unexpectedly blossoms. The film culminates in a charming dance scene that could be described as goofy, messy, slightly offbeat, and one that still works. And the same could be said of Pat and Tiffany's romance.\n\nTO WATCH WITH FAMILY\n\nAbout a Boy\n\nA sweet yet cheeky ode to found family, About a Boy truly proves that no man is an island. Hugh Grant plays Will, a womanizing loner who ends up involved in the life of young Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), becoming somewhat of a father figure to him and a much better person overall in the process. By the end, as he's surrounded by the people in his life, he embraces the importance of human connection and love.\n\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding\n\nWhen someone gets married, they're marrying that person's whole family. And every family has traditions and quirks that may seem strange to an outsider. Perhaps no other movie shows all of this better than My Big Fat Greek Wedding does. Based on star and writer Nia Vardalos' own experience introducing her husband to her big, Greek family, this comedy became an instant hit with its relatable story of love working through culture clash.\n\nCrazy Rich Asians\n\nThe over-the-top lifestyle of Singapore's elite comes as a bit of a shock to New Yorker Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) in Crazy Rich Asians when she accompanies her boyfriend Nick (Henry Golding) to Singapore for the wedding of Nick's best friend. Thrust into the spotlight on her trip, Rachel must contend with a whole host of challenges — including meeting Nick's disapproving mother (Michelle Yeoh). Rounding out the cast of this charming rom-com are Gemma Chan, Lisa Lu, Awkwafina and Ken Jeong.\n\nLove, Simon\n\nThis tender coming-of-age story pulls double duty as a tale of learning to love your authentic self and finding love, both romantic and platonic, once you do. Simon (Nick Robinson) is gay, but hasn’t told his family and friends until a blackmailer threatens to do it for him. After he’s cruelly outed, Simon eventually finds freedom in loving who he is and sees that his friends and family love and support him too, allowing him to take a chance on romantic love.\n\nMi Familia\n\nFeaturing an all-star cast (Jimmy Smits, Edward James Olmos, Esai Morales, Constance Marie and Jennifer Lopez), Mi Familia is the epic story of three generations of the Sanchez family's triumphs and tragedies. Love and loss abound as the family moves from first-generation immigrants to second- and third-generation families that struggle to find their place among familial expectations and the world they grew up in. Despite their hardships, love brings the family back together over the years, and guides their path forward in an ever-changing landscape.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nRom-Coms to Watch for Any Occasion\n\nNikole Beckwith: 6 Movies About Non-Romantic Love"
