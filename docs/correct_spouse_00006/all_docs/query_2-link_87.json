        "text": "Splitting? Already? Jim Carrey‘s daughter and her husband say it’s over.\n\nJane Carrey and Blood Money singer Alex Santana, parents to 9-month-old son Jackson Riley, wed only a year ago.\n\n“The couple will remain friends, as well as devoted parents,” the comedian’s spokeswoman told In Touch Weekly.\n\nAccording to a family friend, the 23-year-old Jane Carrey Band front woman and her baby are visiting her dad in New York, where he is currently filming “Mr. Popper’s Penguins.”\n\nJim Carrey split from longtime girlfriend Jenny McCarthy last spring.\n\nRapper T.I. claims he’s becoming a better man during his stint in prison, telling fans, “The longer I sit, the smarter I get.”\n\nT.I. wrote a letter to his fans (which a member of his team posted on his website) explaining, “It does’nt matter how long it’ll be before the next time you see me. What matters is that I’ll be a better man before that time comes.”\n\nHe also reveals that he’s been trying to understand God’s “plan” for him, saying, “How do you tell God Almighty that all you wanna do is LIVE LIFE ??? What if all you wanna do is be a father to your kids, a husband to your wife, and son to your mother.”\n\nT.I. has served 2 months of an 11-month sentence in an Arkansas prison stemming from a 2009 gun conviction.\n\nKevin Smith has had another flight melt-down.\n\nLess than eight months after the director, 40, started a Twitter war with Southwest Airlines for removing him from a flight because he was “too fat,” he’s run into issues again — this time with Virgin America.\n\nSmith took to his blog Monday to write a rambling diatribe in which he ranted about how he, his wife, Jennifer Schwalbach, and a pal missed their flight out of JFK, despite having first-class tickets and arriving at the gate with 10 minutes to spare. The Silent Bob actor explained he he doesn’t like to board early because “When you’re the Too Fat To Fly guy on a plane? Well everyone stares.”\n\nBut despite employing the use of a concierge service, the group didn’t get to the gate until the door was being shut.\n\nExplained Smith, “We pleaded with Manny (the unfriendly face of Virgin America JFK working the gate), pointing out the remaining time (there were still 8 minutes before scheduled departure), and pointing out that the jetway was still attached to the plane. Flying as much as I do (usually up at the front of the plane), I know that the jetway only gets pulled back ONCE THE PLANE DOOR IS SECURELY CLOSED.”\n\nBut Smith said his main issue was not being able to retrieve his luggage — including two bags that held his wife’s medication — from underneath the plane.\n\nAnd though Smith, who dubbed himself the “loudmouth of the skies,” said he would “never spend another dime on anything Virgin-related ever again,” he did later update his blog to say he received an apologetic email, full refund for his flight and free tickets. “Unlike Southwest, @VirginAtlantic seems to care,” he wrote. “I appreciate the gesture/effort.”\n\nShe may have just been given the green light to drive (again), but Lindsay Lohan won’t be going anywhere far for Christmas.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the starlet will have to remain in California in accordance with the rules of the Betty Ford Center and its sober living facility, despite her mother’s wishes for her to celebrate the holiday season with family on the East Coast.\n\n“Dinah Lohan wants Lindsay to go home to Long Island for Christmas, [but] that won’t be happening,” a source told Radaronline.\n\n“Judge Elden Fox was very clear with his order that he wanted her to stay in rehab until after New Year’s,” said the source and, apparently, a trip out of state wouldn’t be fulfilling that requirement.\n\nBut Lohan has seemingly been doing well in rehab thus far. The troubled 24-year old’s good behavior at the rehab center has earned her short shopping excursions and trips to her home in L.A..\n\nAccording to TMZ the clinic finally handed over Lohan’s car keys Monday, two weeks after the L.A. County Probation department restored her license.\n\nlsmith@denverpost.com\n\nMore celebrity headlines"
