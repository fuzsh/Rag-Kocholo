        "text": "Blue Bloods star Donnie Wahlberg got a lot more than he bargained for as the result of a recent appearance on Jenny McCarthy's VH1 talk show. After some steamy banter between the host and her guest, the pair are now dating, People reports.\n\nWahlberg, 43, appeared on The Jenny McCarthy Show in March and engaged in a very frank discussion about his sexual preferences with McCarthy, 40.\n\nPhotos: Actors who dated their TV relatives\n\nMcCarthy blogged about Wahlberg's appearance and said it gave 50 Shades of Grey \"a run for its money.\" \"Being turned on by a guy is always fun but to have it legitimately happen to you on TV is to be turned back into a 12-year-old,\" she wrote in a blog post for the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nWahlberg was married to Kim Fey for nine years until the two divorced in 2008. They have two sons. McCarthy has one son from a previous relationship. She dated Jim Carrey for five years until 2010, and was recently linked to NFL star Brian Urlacher.\n\nWatch clips from McCarthy's interview with Wahlberg below:\n\nView original Report: Blue Bloods' Donnie Wahlberg Is Dating Jenny McCarthy at TVGuide.com\n\nOther Links From TVGuide.com"
