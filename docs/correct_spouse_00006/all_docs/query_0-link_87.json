        "text": "Jenny McCarthy and Donnie Wahlberg are engaged, she announced on The View Wednesday.\n\n\"I just got engaged!\" McCarthy exclaimed, before jumping around the talk show's set, showing off her yellow sapphire ring.\n\nWahlberg, who joined his fianc√©e on stage, enlisted the help of McCarthy's son Evan, 11, when he got down on one knee last weekend. As for the wedding date, McCarthy said the couple was undecided, but that August 2015 was an option.\n\nBefore the episode aired, McCarthy teased the big announcement. \"Turn on #theview,\" she tweeted. \"It's gonna be a goooood one. :)\"\n\nAfter the segment aired, Wahlberg added, \"#Happy.\"\n\nThe couple have been dating since last summer. This will be the second marriage for Wahlberg, 44, who has two sons from his marriage to Kim Fey. McCarthy, 41, was previously married to Evan's father, John Asher, and dated Jim Carrey for five years.\n\nWatch McCarthy's announcement below.\n\nView original Jenny McCarthy and Donnie Wahlberg Engaged at TVGuide.com\n\nOther Links From TVGuide.com"
