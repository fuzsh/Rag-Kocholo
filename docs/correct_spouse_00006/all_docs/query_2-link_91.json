I love her to pieces.\"\n\nWhile she and Jim aren't married, Jenny joked that their relationship mirrored that of her Harpo Productions boss, Oprah Winfrey. Jenny's planned talk show is coming in 2011 – and with Oprah off the air, she's hoping that she could be the next daytime queen.\n\nVIEW THE PHOTOS: Jenny McCarthy\n\n\"Does that make Jim….
