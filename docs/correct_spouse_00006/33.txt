“So if he asked you, you would say, ‘no,’ instead of ‘yes?’” Shaun asked.

“I would say, ‘You are joking, because you know me better,’” Jenny said. “And, we love each other as is.”

Despite the unlikelihood of a trip down the aisle for the couple, Jenny and Jim are very much a family, especially when it comes to celebrating the holidays.

Jim told Access that he loves to dress up like Santa for Jenny’s 6-year-old son Evan.

“I pretended I was coming down the chimney,” Jim said of last year’s Christmas celebration. “I was going insane in the living room. But, he was at a distance and he was a little — it was a little shocking for [Evan.]”

Jim, who is known for going to great lengths in all of his roles, appears to do the same when it comes to playing St. Nick.

“He even got on the roof and pretended to land the sleigh,” Jenny explained.

“That’s a time honored tradition in my family,” Jim continued. “You got to go to the roof. You got to take the jingle bells on the roof and trump around.”

“I go all the way with the illusion,” he added.
