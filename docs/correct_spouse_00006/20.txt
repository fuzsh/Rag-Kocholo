The former couple have been outspoken about not getting married, but McCarthy recently joked to Us that they were considering walking down the aisle.

"We say 'never,' but I don't know," she told Us at the 8th Annual World Poker Tournament in L.A. in February. "Maybe for tax purposes, someday, when we are old."

McCarthy also recently told Us she was "really excited" to become a grandmother after Carrey's 22-year-old daughter, Jane, gave birth to son Jackson in February.
