Jim Carrey's daughter, Jane, is pregnant with her first child – and that makes his partner, Jenny McCarthy, a soon-to-be almost grandmother.

"I'm soon to be a grandma!" she told AccessHollywood.com's Laura "Dish of Salt" Saltman at an event promoting her new Nintendo Wii game, "Your Shape" by Ubisoft in LA. "So that's interesting. 37 [years old], I get to be called 'Grandma.'"

However, the youthful star said she doesn't mind the title.

"I'm going to try to keep in shape and youthful, so 'Grandma' sounds pretty good," she said.

And the star told The Dish that she feels like a real mom to Jane.

"I would even call myself an absolute mother-in-law," she said. "I'd consider her my daughter. I love her to pieces."

While she and Jim aren't married, Jenny joked that their relationship mirrored that of her Harpo Productions boss, Oprah Winfrey. Jenny's planned talk show is coming in 2011 – and with Oprah off the air, she's hoping that she could be the next daytime queen.

"Does that make Jim…. Stedman?" Jenny joked.
