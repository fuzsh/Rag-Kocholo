The 48-year-old star told over half a million internet followers that he and former model McCarthy, 37, would remain friends.

Twice-married Carrey, previously engaged to actress Renee Zellweger, doted on Jenny’s seven-year-old autistic son Evan.

Carrey, the star of The Truman Show, has a 22-year-old daughter, Jane, from a relationship with actress Melissa Womer.

He said on Twitter: “Jenny and I have just ended our five-year relationship, I’m grateful for the many blessings we’ve shared and I wish her the very best! S’okay!”.

McCarthy said: “I will always keep Jim as a leading man in my heart.”
