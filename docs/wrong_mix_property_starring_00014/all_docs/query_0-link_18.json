The pair in the movie fell in love after Natalie made a grand entrance in her new job working for Hugh's character, the Prime Minister, spluttering accidental swear words and ultimately embarrassing herself.\n\nBut this allowed Martine to go onto have a successful career in music with a number one album and five top singles.\n\nHowever, the star has had a difficult time and has lived with serious health conditions for a number of years.\n\nShe has been diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome ME and Lyme's disease.\n\nThe severity of her illness even meant at one point she needed to use a wheelchair after becoming so weak from collapsing more than 20 times, reported our sister title MyLondon.\n\nLiam Neeson\n\nSince Love Actually, Liam Neeson has starred in numerous roles compared to his fellow colleagues.\n\nOf course, his most notorious role is his role as Bryan Mills, a retired CIA agent, who travels all the way across Europe to hunt down his estranged daughter who was kidnapped in Taken.\n\nLiam tragically lost his wife Natasha Richardson in a freak skiing accident, in 2009. She was only 45-years-old at the time of her death.\n\nFrom the Dark Knight Trilogy, Narnia and Star Wars, the 69-year-old is still working within film.\n\nPeople can be rest assured to see him in many more films including playing a role of someone who is a professional assassin who gets on the wrong side of a criminal organisation in The Marksman.\n\nAndrew Lincoln\n\nNow, Andrew's role in Love Actually saw the movie unravel to reveal his secret obsession with his best friends newly wedded wife Juliet.\n\nArmed with a boom box, and cue cards audiences saw him confess his love to Keira Knightley's character in the movies iconic duo scene.\n\nSince then, his played a character that has woken up from a coma to find the world in ruins and plagued by zombies.\n\nHe held the role of Sheriff Rick Grimes, lead character of the Walking Dead until 2018, in which audiences saw him slay zombies.\n\nHowever, fans will be able to see him pick up his sheriff hat as he picks up his role again in the planned trilogy of the Walking Dead.\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor\n\nChiwetel only played a small part in the movie compared to Keira Knightley, but following the movie he has taken up roles in 12 Years A Slave, The Lion King and Dr Strange.\n\nThe London actor has been busy and viewers can expect much more from the 44-year-old actor.\n\nIn the coming years, viewers are set to see him in The Pod Generation, The Old Guard 2 and Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.\n\nIn 2008, he was awarded an CBE, Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), by the Duke of Cambridge.\n\nEmma Thompson\n\nThis iconic British star, Dame Emma Thompson DBE , is idolised by many for her amazing acting. Everyone's hearts were broken seeing Emma's character, Karen, in the bedroom crying after discovering her husbands affair.\n\nFans were moved so much by the scene at her acting. However, it seems the star was going through a similar heartbreak herself with her first husband Sir Kenneth Branagh.\n\nThe Mirror reported, that Sir Kenneth Branagh allegedly had an affair with Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nMore recently she starred as Baroness in Cruella alongside Emma Stone.\n\nHowever, her fans will be able to look forward to highly anticipated remake Matilda.\n\nAlan Rickman\n\nBeloved and warmly admired British star Alan Rickman had already made noise in the acting scene before appearing in Love Actually.\n\nUnfortunately, he played the role of Harry who has an emotional and physical affair - breaking his hearts wife in Love Actually, Karen, aka Emma Thompson.\n\nHe played the villain Hans Gruber in another festive classic, Die Hard with Bruce Willis.\n\nBut, perhaps his most famous role was that of Severus Snape. Alan Rickman portrayed the professor in all the Harry Potter movies.\n\nHowever, Alan sadly died in January 2016 at the age of 69 to pancreatic cancer. He passed away while surrounded by his loving family in London.\n\nHis fans cherished his role as Absolem in Alice Through the Looking Glass.\n\nHugh Grant\n\nA British rom-com just would not be complete without Hugh Grant.\n\nHugh took up the role as British Prime Minister David, and people saw the best dad dancing down 10 Downing's Halls ever.\n\nHe is entertaining on screen as well as real life and had already played in popular comedy hit Four Weddings and a Funeral.\n\nSince 2002 he has picked up the mantle of countless movies such as Paddington 2, The Man from U.N.C.LE. and The Gentleman.\n\nHis been awarded a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA Award.\n\nThe 61-year-old will be appearing in Dungeons and Dragons, a different role than his usual gig.\n\nJoanna Page\n\nAppearing as Judy in the festive classic, she was seen in the buff on top of co-star Martin Freeman.\n\nIt became a career defining moment as four years later she came to Britain's screens in the hit comedy show Gavin and Stacey.\n\nShe played alongside Co-star James Cordon as Stacey Shipman. The TV series success ran between 2007 and 2010.\n\nIt also made a grand return in 2019 after more than a decade disappearing from our TV screens.\n\nHowever, the actress has given up the acting gig as she now ventures into the world of TV presenting.
