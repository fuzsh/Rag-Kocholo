        "text": "Cancel culture is threatening to spoil one of the most beloved Christmas movies of all time.\n\nLove Actually has been a staple on our television screens every festive season since 2003, with iconic scenes such as the airport reunions and Emma Thompson's Christmas morning cry sure to pull on the heartstrings every re-watch.\n\nHowever, the feel-good Christmas film is in danger of being \"cancelled\" after fans took to social media to decry its \"toxic\" messages about women and relationships.\n\nREAD MORE: Love Actually: 10 things you didn't know about the iconic Christmas film\n\nREAD MORE: 'The lingerie I thought my husband bought me for Christmas, actually went to his secret lover'\n\nTwitter critics have claimed the romcom rewards \"toxic\" male characters such as Hugh Grant as the UK Prime Minister and Andrew Lincoln's Mark.\n\nOne Love Actually's storylines involves Mark's pursuit of his best friend's wife Juliet, played by Keira Knightly, who he declares his love for in the final scenes of the movie.\n\nAnother male character, played by Alan Rickman, is universally despised after he cheated on his wife, played by Emma Thompson, with his secretary.\n\nThe film also follows the romance between the Prime Minister and his tea lady, Natalie.\n\nNatalie, played by Martine McCutcheon, is fired by the Prime Minister when she is sexually harassed by the visiting US President, played by Billy Bob Thornton.\n\nMany social media users have been vocal about the storylines which have \"aged poorly\" since it was filmed 18 years ago.\n\n\"Seeing lots of hate for Love Actually and I just want you to know that, I'm with you. The movie is absolutely terrible and promotes so many toxic relationship traits,\" one person fumed on Twitter.\n\nREAD MORE: Woman reveals she's 'happy' her ex-husband is getting married\n\n\"Love Actually is actually one of the worst movies ever. It is one big celebration of toxic relationships. It's not romantic or loving at all. It's infuriating and borderline grotesque that it is this celebrated and trends every year,\" another wrote.\n\nOne added: \"I watched Love Actually for the first time last night and not only is it fatphobic, but it's also sexist? There was maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the whole thing that I laughed but most of the film I was just like, \"wtf, how is this considered romantic?\"\n\nWhile some critics were quick to point out the movie's flaws, some said despite its problematic themes, Love Actually is still a sweet film about romance and love.\n\n\"Watching #LoveActually for the first time this season. It's problematic for several reasons: fat-shaming a beautiful woman for no reason, Mark's gross voyeuristic obsession with his best friends wife, etc,\" one woman wrote.\n\n\"And it's also beautiful: Jamie and Aurelia learning each other's language as they fall in love, Daniel being a supportive and inclusive stepfather while mourning his wife's death.\"\n\nSeveral Love Actually stars have since spoken out on the film's problematic storylines, with actress Lulu Popplewell — who played Daisy — calling the movie \"sh—\" in 2020.\n\nREAD MORE: Maria Thattil: 'Why I'll be saying more than 'Merry Christmas' this December'\n\n\"I don't regret it at all. Look, softly be it spoken I think it's a s*** film,\" Popplewell told the podcast Almost Famous with Barnaby Slater.\n\n\"I think it's aged badly. All the women in it are sort of passive objects. I think that there was an article that described them as passive objects to be acquired, and on re-watching it's not great.\"\n\nIn 2017, Andrew Lincoln reflected on his \"weird stalker\" character and said he worried about how Mark's actions would be perceived by viewers.\n\n\"But I kept saying to Richard [Curtis, the film's writer-director 'Are you sure I'm not going to come off as a creepy stalker?'\" he told Entertainment Weekly.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here."
