I love the fact that people still like them, but I never felt really comfortable doing them,\" Grant told Barrymore. He added he preferred roles that gave him \"more of a mask.\"\n\n\"I want to be someone else. Then it frees me up and then I quite like acting,\" Grant continued.\n\nHe then joked that playing an Oompa Loompa in \"Wonka\" was a role that felt closest to who he was in real life.\n\nGrant rose to prominence by starring in romantic comedies such as \"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\" \"Notting Hill,\" and \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" back in the '90s and early '00s.\n\nHe also starred alongside Barrymore in the 2007 rom-com \"Music and Lyrics.\"\n\nIn recent years, he's chosen to act in different types of projects, including \"Paddington 2\" and \"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves.\"\n\nGrant's latest movie \"Wonka,\" which features Timothée Chalamet in the titular role, is set to be released on December 15."
