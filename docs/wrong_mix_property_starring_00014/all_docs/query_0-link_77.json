        "text": "Child star Lulu Popplewell has slammed Richard Curtis's movie 'Love Actually' as a 'cheesy, s**t sexist film'.\n\n'Love, Actually' is regarded by many to be one of the best rom-coms by revered filmmaker Richard Curtis, who also brought us such classics as 'Four Wedding and a Funeral', 'Notting Hill' and 'Bridget Jones' Diary' but now the child actor Lulu Popplewell who famously appeared as the 'lobster in the school nativity' has hit out at the movie calling it sexist and a 's**t film'.\n\nImage from StudioCanal.\n\nOnly twelve at the time, Lulu played Emma Thompson’s character Karen’s daughter in the 2003 blockbuster. Although only having a few lines of dialogue - she was remembered as the little girl telling her baffled mum that she was to play the part of “first lobster” at the school's nativity play.\n\nSpeaking on the podcast Almost Famous, Lulu, now a 29-year-old comedian, slammed the film saying, she \"hates the film for its portrayal of women\".\n\n\"Look, softly be it spoken I think it's a s**t film. I think it's aged badly. All the women in it are sort of passive objects.\n\n\"I think that there was an article describing them as passive objects to be acquired. On re-watching it's not great.\n\n\"You also have to remember that he [Curtis] was writing in the context of the time.\n\n\"I mean I don't know how he excuses more recent work.\n\n\"But it was in 2003 or whenever it was out. But it is also not for me because I don't like cheese. I'm glad people like it.\"\n\nImage from Getty.\n\nLulu also revealed what it was like to be among such megastars at such a young age.\n\n\"I remember meeting Hugh Grant as well, 'cos Richard introduced me to him. And he said 'oh god do I have to speak to her? I hate children'.\n\n\"Non-ironically. Which I thought was really funny.\"\n\nImage from Getty.\n\nLulu also revealed she wasn’t allowed to watch the film when it first came out as she was too young.\n\nShe said: ''I wasn't even allowed to watch it when it came out because it was a 15 - there's nipples and everything.''\n\nLove Actually follows the lives of eight very different couples in dealing with their love lives in various loosely interrelated tales all set during a frantic month before Christmas in London, England."
