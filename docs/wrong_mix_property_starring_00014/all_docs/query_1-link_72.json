        "text": "Somehow it's been 20 years since Love Actually was released, introducing us to Hugh Grant’s dancing, octopus nativity costumes, and Keira Knightley’s baker boy hat. The festive classic, written by Richard Curtis, was released in November 2003 and saw an ensemble cast of the UK's most A-List actors come together to tell a story of interwoven tales about love, in all its forms, at Christmas.\n\nThe film has become a Christmas tradition, and while there's many things we love about the film (see octopus nativity costumes), some parts of the movie feel firmly stuck in the early 2000s. So if the film were to be given a reboot for today, what would a Love Actually set in 2023 look like? Would Harry still cheat on Karen (spoiler alert: yes)? Would the competition for a Christmas number one still happen? And would Natalie and David get together?\n\nHere's what a Love Actually remade in 2023 would look like:\n\nWhat? The Harry and Mia cheating storyline\n\nIn the revival: Harry would still cheat on Karen, sorry. But instead of a long drawn-out affair, Mia would just give Harry a discount code for her OnlyFans account (she’s making a killing btw) and Karen would find out through their joint online bank account. *Sob*.\n\nWhat? Body-shaming Natalie for her weight\n\nIn the revival: Fat-shaming is so 2000s (and even then it shouldn't have happened), so Natalie's appearance doesn't come into it - and neither does a romance with David. Talk about an imbalanced power dynamic.\n\nWhat? Jamie and Aurelia's relationship that made no sense\n\nIn the revival: Instead of Jamie dating Aurelia, she'd work in a neighbouring village and they'd match on Hinge. After several failed attempts at dates with the help of Duolingo, they realise they don’t actually have anything in common, and end things before NYE. At least Jamie's nephews will see him this year.\n\nWhat? Peter and Juliet’s unattainable mews home\n\nIn the revival: Forget the stunning Notting Hill abode. Rising house prices means the couple find themselves living in a shared property, unable to fund their dream wedding. Oh, and instead of banoffee pie, Juliet offers Mark a gluten-free vegan pastry.\n\nWhat? The film's complete and utter lack of diversity\n\nIn the revival: The ensemble cast reflects London's interesting, diverse culture, encompassing characters from the LGBTQIA+ community and a wide range of socio-economic backgrounds and ethnicities.\n\nWhat? Joanna's performance at the school talent show\n\nIn the revival: Joanna’s performance of ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’ would go viral on TikTok, with Mariah Carey commenting with several heart-eye emojis. Joanna would be signed by an agent and would become a fast fashion brand's youngest ever influencer.\n\nWhat? Colin’s quest to have sex\n\nIn the revival: Rather than a story dedicated to Colin's objectification of women, the film would feature a feel-good plot about a woman, played by Michaela Coel, navigating the complexities and joys of being unattached during the festive season.\n\nWhat? Billy Mack’s journey to Christmas number one"
