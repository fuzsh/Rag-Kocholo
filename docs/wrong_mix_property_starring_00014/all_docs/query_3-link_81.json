        "text": "Fans have found famous British actor Hugh Grant to be a Hollywood heartthrob for decades, thanks to his roles in romantic comedies including \"Notting Hill,\" \"Bridget Jones’s Diary\" and \"Love Actually.\"\n\nLately, the 63-year-old has been highlighted for his snarky and \"grumpy\" comments about the characters he’s portrayed in movies.\n\nWhile he reflected on his rom-com days with \"Music and Lyrics\" co-star Drew Barrymore, the two candidly revisited Grant’s \"Hugh-aissance\" days, and he explained what happened to the heartthrob fans grew to love.\n\nHUGH GRANT 'SLIGHTLY HATES' MAKING MOVIES BUT ‘I HAVE LOTS OF CHILDREN AND NEED MONEY’\n\n\"I got too old and fat and ugly to do romantic comedies, obviously,\" Grant quipped on \"The Drew Barrymore Show.\" \"I got offered more interesting things.\"\n\n\"I got a bit better,\" he explained. \"I got a little less bad after I had children, got married, got happier.\"\n\nDuring his interview with Barrymore, she called Grant’s new role a \"Hugh-mpa,\" as he plays an Oompa Loompa – a fictional group of tiny elf-life creatures who have an orange appearance and green hair – in the upcoming \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" prequel, \"Wonka.\"\n\nElsewhere in the conversation, Barrymore asked Grant if playing the Oompa Loompa was \"the most true\" to his character and what he brought to his role.\n\n\"I didn’t bring much. I just brought … grumpiness … curmudgeonly … I based him on an angry little Scotsman I once knew … no one liked him much … he was a bit lonely … but bossy,\" Grant added.\n\nBarrymore continued to ask Grant what in his personal life he still wanted to accomplish.\n\n\"I’ve done my personal life,\" he replied. \"I’m very happily married, great girl, lovely children … done, finished, cooked.\"\n\nHUGH GRANT ADMITS HE WAS ‘JUST PLAIN WRONG’ ABOUT NOT WANTING FAMILY EARLIER IN LIFE\n\nGrant stars alongside Timothée Chalamet, Olivia Colman, Keegan Michael-Key and more in the lavish big-screen musical.\n\nThe actor previously made similar comments that he didn’t consider his experience filming \"Wonka\" to be very sweet.\n\n\"It was like a crown of thorns, very uncomfortable,\" Grant reportedly said in a press conference, according to Metro. \"I made a big fuss about it. … I couldn’t have hated the whole thing more.\"\n\nHe reportedly also jokingly confessed that he had to make some sacrifices when signing up for the role to provide for his family.\n\n\"I slightly hate [making films], but I have lots of children and need money.\"\n\nGrant has five children in total, including Tabitha, 12, and Felix, 9, with his ex, Tinglan Hong. He also shares three children, ages 11, 6 and 5, with his wife, Anna Eberstein.\n\n\"Wonka\" director Paul King shared why he cast Grant as an Oompa Loompa in the film.\n\n\"They’re so biting and satirical and funny, but they’ve got a real kind of edge to them … and they take an enormous delight in these children’s demise,\" King told the Associated Press. \"I had this vision of Hugh Grant, you know, this high with orange skin and green hair. And once you have that picture come into your mind, you have to try and get it out there.\"\n\nHUGH GRANT REVEALS HE HATED FILMING HIS ICONIC 'LOVE ACTUALLY' DANCE SCENE: 'EXCRUCIATING'\n\nGrant has previously confessed other roles he despised, such as his dancing scene in \"Love Actually.\"\n\nDuring a special appearance to celebrate the film’s 20th anniversary, Grant admitted he disliked participating in the dance montage in the beloved holiday movie.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?
