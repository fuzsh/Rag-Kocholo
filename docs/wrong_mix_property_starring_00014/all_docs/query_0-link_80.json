        "text": "Let's get started.\n\nONE: DO YOU EVER WANT TO SHOOT AT THINGS?\n\nAcknowledging as we must the sad truth that Pierce Brosnan will someday be unavailable, try this on for size: Hugh Grant is James Bond!\n\nNo?\n\n\"Quite frankly, I think there might be a question mark about my butchness,\" Grant allows.\n\nBut is he not dashing? Is he not a subject of the crown? Does he not possess the requisite randy streak? And how\n\nbloody butch was Roger Moore? \"Whether people really believe I could be scary with a gun in my hand,\" Grant adds, \"that is slightly ludicrous.\"\n\nThis is why Grant is now cradling a Bushmaster XM15 assault rifle on the LAX Firing Range in Inglewood, near the Los Angeles airport. The formidable weapon has been presented to him by a skinny, twenty-something fellow with a shaved head and an arsenal at his feet. He's wearing a Beavis and Butt-head T-shirt.\n\n\"Do you own a lot of guns?\" Grant asks.\n\n\"Five,\" says Beavis. \"Just five.\"\n\nGrant squints down the barrel toward the paper target fifty feet away; it is imprinted with a picture of a menacing, mustached intruder. \"You see his shoulder, this side?\" Grant says. Beavis nods. \"I'm gonna put a bullet right through it.\" He mutters, \"Bastard!\" and fires. The report reverberates off the sheet-metal walls like the roar of a cannon. He misses. Not by much.\n\nGrant proves to be handier with Beavis's 12-gauge. \"Motherfucker!\" he snarls this time, nailing the target square in the chest with one shot and blowing off the right ear with another. He then takes up a Glock 34, and a barrage of hot shell casings flies over the partition, pings off the ceiling, and hits me on the head, and we see that he has connected with the target on nine of thirteen rounds (a great many of which struck the bad guy's groin; make of that what you will).\n\nThis proficiency with firearms is a consequence, he says, of summers spent in Scotland \"learning to do manly things,\" such as fishing with his grandfather, a military man. \"He made a range for us, and we used to shoot every day these targets that became more and more grotesque the older we got,\" Grant recalls. \"We used to make German faces, and then we'd put little pillboxes of tomahto ketchup on their noses so that if you hit them in the middle of their faces, they'd get bloody. It was marvelous, really.\" They would don kilts and perform Scottish dances. They would make great whooping sounds in the tradition of the Highlanders. \"Woo, woo, whoop!\" Grant demonstrates. \"I sounded like a girl.\"\n\nGrant offers me $500 to put the Glock to Beavis's head and yell, \"Freeze!\"\n\n\"He is magnificent,\" Grant says.\n\nWe turn to a virtual-reality game (with live ammo and real guns) called Drug Wars, in which villains are projected onto a foam screen. \"I want to shoot her,\" Grant says of a female smuggler--then proceeds to empty his nineteen-round clip, taking out three or four more bad guys before (oops) nailing a fellow drug-enforcement officer.\n\n\"I'm disgusted with you!\" the game's virtual narrator spits at Grant for killing an innocent.\n\nAnd our man is forced to concede the missing Bondian element deep within his soul, the sine qua non that he lacks to pull off the archetypal British agent. \"You have to believe that, ultimately, he could kill you,\" Grant supposes. \"I think that's why Sean Connery was the best, because you thought, Well, he's actually quite an angry and violent man, deep down.\"\n\nBond is an awfully tall order.\n\n\"I always thought I'd be marvelous in the role, but Elizabeth says I'd be a laughingstock.\" He turns to the range clerk. \"Is there a game called Hollywood Agents?\"\n\nSo, on a scale of 1 to 5, how are you with artillery?\n\n5 = Charlton Heston\n\nYou (choose one): 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 4\n\nAllow me to explain: Across this muscular and chest-thumping land, there is a certain kind of guy who finds himself conflicted about Hugh Grant, who is somewhat aware that he likes Hugh Grant, who laughs when he finds himself viewing Hugh Grant's movies, but who finds Hugh Grant a bit too slight, too proper, to endorse publicly. Who, having spent the past decade thrilling to the steroidal he-manliness of American action figures both fictional and non, is disinclined to admit feelings of identification with a man whom, in some ways, he sees as even less manly than his own larded ass.\n\nThis sort of man (and you know who you are) compares himself constantly to all others of his kind. Puts himself to the test. And gets results that only he can understand--doing fine here, need to do better there. That sort of thing.\n\nIt is a test of status and virility, and it is a test as old as time. Improvements are hard-won and effortful and incremental at best.\n\nTo this sort of guy, can it be anything but vexing that this Hugh Grant has shacked up with the fierce and bosomy and usually undressed Elizabeth Hurley? Can this sort of guy be blamed for believing that Hugh Grant's accent--ironically, the same clipped elocution that to him makes even Brits as brutal as heavyweight Lennox Lewis sound like prissy manservants--is an unfair advantage in the slaying of women, from whom he believes Grant could generally take his pick for ravishment? Specifically, his woman?\n\n\"That,\" Grant chirps, \"is my life's ambition.\"\n\nWhat has he got that I haven't got? the everyman might wonder. Apart from Grant's being famous, smarter, richer, better looking, wittier, and a better marksman, of course?\n\nIt is a mystery. Closer inspection is required.\n\nWe will put Hugh Grant to the test. (Feel free to follow along and grade yourself appropriately, on a scale from 1 to 5--5 being manliest. It'll be fun.)\n\nOn behalf of us all, I am in search of Hugh Grant's manhood.\n\nAnd there it is, right there in the backseat of a Lincoln Town Car, there as he relaxes after taking up arms against all those enemies of Hugh, there as he glides through the streets of Los Angeles on a sunny spring day. At just the moment I think I find it, Grant clutches the door handle, cracks the window, strains for fresh air, and announces that he might become carsick. The pressure may be getting to him.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" he says, \"if I vomit on you.\"\n\nLet's continue.\n\nTWO: DO YOU TALK LIKE PRINCE CHARLES?\n\nTomahto.\n\n1 = His Royal Highness\n\nYou: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 1\n\nTHREE: DO YOU HAVE A MANLY JOB?\n\nHis stock in trade is riffing off himself as the charming, befuddled fish out of water. In Notting Hill, he was a charming, befuddled bookseller drawn into the celebrity fishbowl of a famous actress, played by Julia Roberts. In Grant's second movie of the summer, Mickey Blue Eyes, he's the charming, befuddled proprietor of a New York art auction house who falls in love with Jeanne Tripplehorn, the daughter of a mobster played by James Caan, and suddenly finds himself laundering money and digging shallow graves. So far, Hugh Grant has mainly been known to act in \"date movies.\" Mickey Blue Eyes may be a date movie, but it is not a \"chick movie,\" for it is also a gangster movie. A romantic-comedy gangster movie, to be sure, but one with solid mob cred and verisimilitude. First of all, there is Mr. Caan. There is a solid supporting cast of thick-fingered capos. There is gunplay. The location shots in the Italian enclave of Mill Basin, Brooklyn, are brilliant: impossibly ornate houses on tiny lots festooned with spiral topiaries. (Production notes for the film say the locals complimented Caan on his plum-colored suit.)\n\nAnd among the extras are several poster boys for the RICO act. \"Sometimes we needed to cut because the film was too long,\" Grant says, \"and then we remembered, 'Well, that's the son of the head of the Gambino family; maybe we ought just leave him in.' \" During the filming of a scene in which Caan and Grant bury a body in a New Jersey landfill, a childhood friend of Caan's from the old neighborhood drew near, pulled the actor aside, and said, \"Listen, don't dig too deep around here.\"\n\n5 = Evel Knievel\n\nYou: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 2\n\nFOUR: DO YOU UTILIZE BODILY NOISES AS A MEANS OF EXPRESSION?\n\nIt comes from between Hugh Grant's lips, the selfsame smackers he's nibbled for years in the face of romantic-comedy angst, the tender, rosy pout that causes wives and girlfriends the world over to fantasize of sonnets whispered in the ear. It is a loud and deliberate expulsion, possessed of the sort of bass and sharpness that announce its creator as a man of earthy self-possession and defiance. It is cranky and spontaneous, genuine and hearty. It comes hard on the heels of a citrus-cured sea-bass salad and a seafood risotto at Ago, a sleek Los Angeles eatery co-owned by Robert De Niro. It is not of sufficient resonance or duration, to my mind, to be properly called a belch, but it is most certainly a burp, and an excellent one, as burps go. One of those sharp, succinct burps. And when a man burps, he does not burp with an accent: Hugh Grant's burps sound just like American burps. Like this: brrrrap!\n\n\"I am very pissed off,\" says Grant upon completion of the burp, with which he is making a point.\n\nIt is April. Notting Hill has not even opened yet, and already there are detractors accusing him of falling back upon the thespianic tics that cemented his screen image as a charming but diffident aesthete: eye batting, raking of fingers through the hair, lip biting, and stammering. \"I don't put my hand in my hair once in Notting Hill!\" Grant grouses. \"And I haven't stammered since Four Weddings and a--well, uh, no, I--\"\n\n5 = Only on crowded elevators\n\nYou: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 2\n\nFIVE: DO YOU MAKE A LASTING IMPRESSION?\n\n\"I really like Hugh Grant,\" the woman next to me coos to her date during the opening scenes of Notting Hill, as if she'd, well, forgotten about him entirely. For that, she could be forgiven. It is now June, and it's been a long time since Hugh Grant's dimples were projected anywhere near this Skokie, Illinois, multiplex. \"If you're an actor, there's not much point to you unless you've just done something that's actually entertained people,\" Grant says, phoning from some castle in England where he and Hurley are ducking the press hurly-burly. \"Seeing as how I haven't done anything that's entertained anyone for about four years, it's a bit of a relief.\"\n\nFour Weddings and a Funeral, the movie that made Grant a star, came out in 1994. In 1995, as you might recall, Grant was involved in an incident that caused him to receive some unflattering press. He immersed himself in building a movie-production company with Hurley, naming the company Simian Films, Grant says, \"because Elizabeth's obsessed with apes--hugely embarrassing.\" He appeared only in a couple of smallish movies, including Simian's first feature, Extreme Measures, a medical thriller that costarred Grant and Gene Hackman. Nobody went, which is a pity, because Grant batted nary an eyelid, flopped nary a forelock--and saved the day!\n\nAnd so, for most of the past four years, Grant's mainly been wielding his manhood in the offscreen Hollywood role of big, swinging you-know-what, which is to say he's a producer. \"I think there's a Hollywood scumbag executive lurking inside me who wants to get out,\" he says. \"The biggest boost my day can have is reading about some film that's flopped; I tell you, the schadenfreude you develop is really quite alarming.\" That statement notwithstanding, directors, actors, and fellow producers describe a new sense of gravitas in Grant, a seriousness, a new sort of depth--which he almost certainly would deny.\n\nHis career, he supposes, has been something of an accident. He was born on September 9, 1960, in London, into a family he describes as \"impoverished gentlefolk.\" His father was an army man, then a carpet salesman; his mother was a housewife. He earned a degree in English literature from Oxford University and had all intentions of working on a master's in art history at the Courtauld Institute when he started playing bit parts in local theater productions on a lark and took a role in a 1982 student film called Privileged. \"I spent more time posing and going to bad parties, really, than acting,\" he recalls. \"And they asked me to play a partygoing poser in the film.\" His film stock rose with the 1987 Merchant Ivory production of E. M. Forster's Maurice, for which he won Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival. It was uphill from there: The Dawning with Anthony Hopkins, Ken Russell's The Lair of the White Worm, The Remains of the Day, Impromptu, and Sense and Sensibility. In 1994, the same year he broke out internationally in Four Weddings, American audiences saw him in the Roman Polanski film Bitter Moon.\n\nNone of these movies involve Grant crashing through windows or beating anyone up. But it was Four Weddings's huge success that really sealed his future as a fumbling, lovable weakling.\n\nAnd it's clearly the genre in which moviegoing Yanks wish him to remain. Notting Hill's four-day opening weekend scored $27.7 million--a record for a romantic comedy, for what that's worth. And while Julia Roberts is the star everyone expected to carry Notting Hill to enormous profitability, Grant had more screen time and was singled out for praise by Newsweek, The New Yorker, The New York Times, and Roger Ebert. \"Is he the one that's still alive?\" Grants asks. \"Ah. Good.\"\n\n1 = \"Who?\"\n\nYou: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 3\n\nSIX: ARE YOU BRAVE?\n\nThe Hotel Nikko Beverly Hills is owned by a Japanese consortium, and the Japanese know a thing or two about earthquakes. Hence, the building is a high-tech, earthquake-ready structure. When it counts, the building roils and flexes mightily. Five years ago, Richter called when Grant and Hurley were snuggling in their suite.\n\n\"Suddenly, in the middle of the night, I thought something was very peculiar because instead of just me and Elizabeth in bed, it was me, Elizabeth, and the television set,\" Grant recalls. \"I hauled Elizabeth out of bed and made her stand in the doorway,\" he says. \"I thought it was rather marvelous that I remembered what to do. Of course, what I'd forgotten was that you have to put on your shoes because all the glass breaks, and so we had lacerated feet, bleeding to death there in the corridor.\"\n\n5 = Fire dog\n\nYou: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 2\n\nSEVEN: DO YOU LIVE IN FEAR OF YOUR LADY FRIEND?\n\nFor thirteen years, Hugh Grant has managed to remain Elizabeth Hurley's squeeze against sometimes difficult odds without even marrying her. This would require strength and wiles of which we don't know the half.\n\nHurley, for one thing, has been known to pack heat. Grant claims she was kicked out of an L. A. gun club for dropping a loaded pistol indoors. She has availed herself of course work in the art of self-defense. \"She likes all those violent sports like kickboxing,\" Grant says. \"The ones where you don't wait for the guy to attack you; you just smash him in the face.\"\n\nShe also presents danger in the form of one German shepherd called Nico, acquired by Hurley from a well-known actor after the dog was knifed in a burglary attempt. The owner hadn't gotten the dog's stitches removed, so Hurley did it herself.\n\nHer most abiding pleasure is siccing Nico on small creatures. \"She has a passionate hatred for squirrels,\" Grant says. \"She used to take the dog squirrel-hunting in Hyde Park in London, and whenever there was a squirrel, she'd say, 'Go get it! Kill that little fucker! Kill it! Fucker! Fucking vermin!'\n\n\"We were developing a script with John Cleese once, and he was obsessed with this hatred of hers for squirrels. We had a lunch together in a posh restaurant in London, and the waiter came up and said, 'I'd like to tell you about a few specials we have today: We have a blah-blah and a blah-blah and a fricassee of gray squirrel.' John was so happy.\"\n\nDespite her antipathy toward certain fuzzy-tailed rodents, Hurley is known as an animal lover. Grant is less of an enthusiast. Among the photographs taken for this story was one that featured him sitting atop a horse, a position to which he is not accustomed. \"I'm frightened of horses,\" he says.\n\nHurley, by contrast, once was photographed for the cover of this magazine curled up with a living, breathing lion. \"She's braver than I am,\" he says.\n\n1 = \"I did not have sex with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.\"\n\nYou: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 2\n\nEIGHT: DO YOU HAVE MUSCLES?\n\n\"What I absolutely refuse to do,\" Grant says, \"is go to a gym.\"\n\n5 = Xena, Warrior Princess\n\nYou: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 2\n\nNINE: ARE YOU A \"WINE QUEEN\"?\n\nRegarding money, Hugh Grant cannot be bothered. Although he now makes something on the order of $7 million a movie--\"stupid sums of money,\" he says--he has not invested a red cent. \"I've had no stocks, no shares, no nothing. It just sits in banks.\"\n\nAnd while he relishes posh hotels and fancy wines--he admits to being a \"wine queen,\" in fact--he is not a pretentious consumer of the perks of fame, such as being whisked into nightclubs. \"All my life, I've never got into any clubs or bars; never have done. What they want you to do is get really queeny and say, 'Don't you know who I am?' \" He has exactly the appropriate understanding of a movie star's responsibility to his planet. \"I've been trying to resist caring about the environment, because it's such a cliché for actors, but I find that I'm starting to care despite myself,\" he reveals.\n\n5 = \"Another Thunderbird over here!\"\n\nYou: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 2\n\nTEN: DO YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOURSELF?\n\nHe relishes bad habits. He can drink great quantities of beer. He will mooch a cigarette here and there. \"Elizabeth smokes four thousand cigarettes a day,\" Grant says. \"I've caught her with cigarettes in her nostrils.\"\n\n5 = \"I have woken up in jail.\"\n\nYou: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 4\n\nELEVEN: ARE YOU ATHLETIC?\n\nHe cannot throw a spiral with an American football, but then, they don't teach that in England. He is known as \"hard\" on the rugby field, \"which means you kick people a lot, rather than the ball,\" he says. When in L. A., he will get up as early as 5:00 a.m. to catch soccer matches at what passes for a pub in that town, the Cat & Fiddle. Should a round of pinkish negroni cocktails arrive at his table, he is known to cry, \"I've got a poof drink!\"\n\n1 = \"I saw Notting Hill three times.\"\n\nYou: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 3\n\nTWELVE: ARE YOU A BOLD LIAR?\n\nHe boasts of his days in Her Majesty's Special Air Services, the elite force that flushes hijackers out of commercial jets, eventually accepting a discharge because \"I couldn't wear those balaclavas--I was getting a rash.\" He effortlessly produces extravagant and preposterous lies, such as this one about serving in the SAS, and confesses only upon relentless grilling.\n\n5 = \"I did not have sex with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.\"\n\nYou: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 4\n\nTHIRTEEN: DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF STYLE?\n\nHe will describe himself as a lousy dresser. He does admire the style of his London tailor Douglas Hayward, as much for Hayward's cruelty as his clothing. \"I walk in, and he'll say, 'Fuck me, you're fat, Hugh.' I have one love handle, on this side. They say things like, 'Sir has a very full thigh' and 'Sir has a pronounced calf.' \"\n\nAnd he would share this sartorial lesson--a gift, friend, and one that you gentlemen in parachute pants might take to heart: Grant met Hurley in the late eighties during auditions for a dubious movie that he signed on to only to get close to her. \"I was doing pretty well over the first few days, and then I put on my stonewashed jeans, this being 1987. Elizabeth said that it took her at least a week to recover.\n\n\"We all live on a knife edge like that,\" he says, remembering. \"One garment can fucking sink you.\"\n\n1 = Stonewashed, 1987\n\nYou: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 5\n\nFOURTEEN: ARE YOU SICKLY?\n\nHe frequently complains of one physical malady or another; during our time together, his self-diagnoses ranged from sciatica to meningitis, both of which seemed questionable, although he was doubled over with back pain that clearly made it hard for him to get in and out of the car. Past afflictions have included bursitis (\"which is very humiliating, because only women are supposed to get it; the symptom is frequent, scanty urine\"); he blames the condition on \"chilled kidneys,\" which sounds more like English food than a disease. \"No, my own kidneys were chilled from riding a moped round London with nothing but my mother's anorak.\"\n\n1 = \"Chilled kidneys\"\n\nYou: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 1\n\nFIFTEEN: DO YOU PAY YOUR GAMBLING DEBTS?\n\n\"I know a book you'll so love,\" Grant says, pounding the table, when I mention that I sometimes write restaurant reviews. \"Lanchester. John Lanchester. It's like pornography for people who love food.\" This remark presents, to my mind, a test of Hugh Grant's character as a man. Famous people are all the time disingenuously telling unfamous people that they will do things for them--that they'll call, send you a wonderful book, have you over to the house--and they never do.\n\nOur segue into literature is brought about upon my complimenting Grant on his teeth, which then sparks talk of Martin Amis and the flaying as a traitor to Britannia he received for having his formerly snaggled smile repaired. \"It's really killed him in England, that thing,\" Grant says. \"He is far and away the best novelist of our generation, and he's known as the guy who fixed his teeth.\"\n\nI ask if he's read The Pope's Rhinoceros, the second novel by my English friend Lawrence Norfolk.\n\n\"The Pope's Rhinoceros is by Stephen Fry,\" Grant says.\n\nNo, it isn't, I say.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Grant says.\n\nNo, I say. Lawrence won some prize for it.\n\n\"I will bet you fifty bucks The Pope's Rhinoceros is by Stephen Fry,\" Grant says.\n\nMake it a hundred, I propose.\n\nA week goes by; I'm at home in Chicago. A FedEx signed by someone named Woodhatch arrives from London. Its contents: Lanchester's The Debt to Pleasure, Evelyn Waugh's A Handful of Dust, and three twenty-dollar bills.\n\n\"No American change,\" Grant wrote in an accompanying note. \"You owe me $10. Love, Hugh.\"\n\n5 = Limey bastard actually still owes this writer $40.\n\nYou: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 4\n\nSIXTEEN: ARE YOU IN TOUCH WITH YOUR FEELINGS?\n\nIt has been said that Grant is incapable of digging deep as an actor, of tapping the fiery pits of emotion to present explosive, blistering performances that sear our souls. It has been said, mostly, by Grant himself. \"I think I'm just a very shallow person,\" he says. \"I don't know where these people get it all from. I mean, they bring up these hysterics and passions, and my life hasn't had any of those.\"\n\nCertainly there has been a rough patch or two. \"There are a few,\" he says, \"but like any good Englishman, you don't get too upset over anything bad that happens to you. You get over it.\"\n\nAnd while Grant's mass popularity clearly stems from the type of character he's played in comedies, it's not so much that he's never done anything different as it is that fewer people go to those films. It is also true that there's no overabundance of good romantic comedies. \"I seem to be playing a game that no one really plays anymore,\" he says. \"It's like being the croquet champion of the world. No one writes knockabout farces, the sort of stuff they used to make millions of in the thirties and forties and fifties. I've read every single romantic comedy that's been written in Hollywood for the last five years--unbelievably bad.\"\n\nAnd so he goes about the business of giving people stuff they like. \"I'm not one of those people who are so concerned about Acting,\" Grant says. \"I'm quite interested in actually entertaining people.\n\n\"I think that coming from a very arty-farty background--I studied literature, Shakespeare for fucking years and years and years, and doing a billion Shakespeare plays--I'm just so more interested now in giving people who actually work, making cars in Milwaukee, in giving them a good night out. To me, that's so much a greater achievement than making someone who lives in Hampstead feel good and pious after a night at the Almeida Theatre. And I'll tell you something: It's way, way, way harder.\" (He is to be forgiven for thinking that anybody in Milwaukee has ever made cars.)\n\nAt this moment, Grant is filming a top-secret Woody Allen movie--one of those projects in which the actors don't get the whole script, only the pages upon which they have lines. \"I had a fax from Woody that said, 'This character is a sophisticated charmer who turns out to be a villain, and I thought you'd be perfect.'\"\n\n1 = \"Hold me.\"\n\nYou: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 4\n\nSEVENTEEN: DO YOU HAVE A PAST?\n\nYou are correct--you've nearly made it to the end, and we've scarcely mentioned that incident in the car.\n\n\"Classy, I call it,\" Grant says.\n\n5 = \"It meant absolutely nothing to me.\"\n\nYou: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nHugh: 5\n\nSO,WHO'S THE MANLIER MAN?\n\nOut of a possible 85.\n\nHugh: 50\n\nYou: ____\n\nIf your score is 17 - 49: Math is hard. Check your numbers carefully.\n\n51 - 85: Nice work. You are in the company of Jack Palance, Ricky Martin, and Madeleine Albright.\n\n50: Congratulations. More than likely, you are Hugh Grant."
