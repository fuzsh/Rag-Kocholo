        "text": "Love Actually star Lulu Popplewell has spoken out about the film, calling it \"cheesy and sexist,\" and saying she thinks \"it's s**t\".\n\nPopplewell, who plays Emma Thompson's daughter Daisy in the 2003 film is now a comedian and made an appearance on the Almost Famous podcast, where she gave her fairly critical opinions on the film.\n\n\"I don't regret it at all,\" she explained. \"Look, softly be it spoken I think it's a s**t film. I think it's aged badly. All the women in it are sort of passive objects. I think that there was an article describing them as passive objects to be acquired.\n\n\"On re-watching it's not great,\" she continued. \"You also have to remember that he [Richard Curtis] was writing in the context of the time... I mean I don't know how he excuses more recent work. But it was in 2003 or whenever it was out.\n\n\"But it is also not for me because I don't like cheese. I'm glad people like it,\" she said.\"\n\nPopplewell's starred as Daisy, Emma Thompson's daughter and is known for the iconic scene in which she tells Thompson's character that she got a part as a lobster in the nativity play.\n\nA few years ago the film hit headlines with a sequel named Red Nose Day Actually for Comic Relief. With stars like Rowan Atkinson, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Andrew Lincoln, Martine McCutcheon, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy and Olivia Olson all appearing.\n\nFilm creator broke hearts when he announced in 2017 that the film will never have a full-length sequel.\n\nCosmopolitan UK's November issue is out now and you can SUBSCRIBE HERE."
