        "text": "Hugh Grant, the charismatic British actor known for his charming wit, amazing hair and impeccable comedic timing, has graced the silver screen for decades. With a career spanning various genres, Hugh Grant movies are a testament to his versatility as an actor.\n\nOur favorite Brit was born Hugh John Mungo Grant on September 9, 1960, in London. He won a scholarship to Oxford and that’s where he caught the drama bug. In 1982, while still a student, Grant made his screen debut in Privileged. He would continue to hone his craft over the next decade. Then, in 1994, he got his breakthrough role playing opposite Andie MacDowell in Four Weddings and a Funeral, which won him a Golden Globe Award and brought him immediate critical fame and audience adoration.\n\nHere we look back at Hugh Grant movies, and ranked our favorites— see if you agree with our ranking!\n\n15. Maurice (1987)\n\nThe film Maurice came out in 1987 long before Hugh Grant movies became a thing. Directed by James Ivory, it was based on the 1971 novel Maurice by E. M. Forster. We love how young (and handsome) Hugh Grant looks in this film. His charisma is undeniable, even at the start of his career. This coming-of-age story is about English school friends finding themselves falling in love at Cambridge. The film stars James Wilby as Maurice, Hugh Grant as Clive and Rupert Graves as Alec.\n\n14. Did You Hear About the Morgans? (2009)\n\nDirected by Marc Lawrence, this romantic comedy centers on a Manhattan couple (Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker) who witness a murder and are subsequently placed in witness protection in a rural town. The film explores the challenges of a strained marriage amidst the backdrop of a quirky small town. This feel-good romantic comedy captured our hearts. The chemistry between SJP and Hugh didn’t hurt.\n\n13. Extreme Measures (1996)\n\nYes, some of our favorite Hugh Grant movies are rom-coms, but our faavorite actor also does a great thriller. In Extreme Measures Grant plays a British doctor working at a hospital in New York. He starts to make unwanted inquiries when the body of a man who died in his emergency room disappears. The trail leads him to the door of an eminent surgeon (played by Gene Hackman), who wants the hospital’s secret to remain undiscovered. A young Sarah Jessica Parker is also in this film.\n\n12. Mickey Blue Eyes (1999)\n\nStarring Jeanne Tripplehorn, James Caan and Hugh Grant, this romantic comedy portrays our lovable Englishman navigating the world of organized crime. It adds a unique twist to the traditional romantic comedy formula. Grant plays Michael Felgate, who discovers that his fiancée’s family has ties to the mob. Directed by Kelly Makin, the film explores the humorous complications that arise when love and the mafia collide.\n\n11. Paddington 2 (2017)\n\nGrant takes on the role of Phoenix Buchanan, a charming but self-absorbed actor, in this adorable family film. Paddington 2 follows the beloved bear as he embarks on a quest to clear his name after being framed for theft. Grant co-stars with Ben Whishaw and Sally Hawkins.\n\n10. Florence Foster Jenkins (2016)\n\nWhile this didn’t make a huge splash at the box office, we really loved this film. Directed by Stephen Frears, this biographical comedy-drama tells the true story of Florence Foster Jenkins, a New York heiress with dreams of becoming an opera singer despite her lack of talent. Grant plays Jenkins’ devoted husband, St. Clair Bayfield, while Meryl Streep plays Jenkins.\n\n9. The Remains of the Day (1993)\n\nThis all-star ensemble includes Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. In this drama directed by James Ivory, Grant plays Cardinal, a wealthy and carefree guest at Darlington Hall. The film explores the life of Stevens (Hopkins), the butler of Darlington Hall, and his complex relationship with housekeeper Miss Kenton (Thompson). The Remains of the Day provided Hugh Grant with an opportunity to showcase his dramatic acting skills.\n\n8. Sense and Sensibility (1995)\n\nWho doesn’t love a good period drama? Starring Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet and directed by the super-talented Ang Lee, this adaptation of Jane Austen’s novel follows the Dashwood sisters as they navigate love and societal expectations. Hugh Grant portrays Edward Ferrars, a reserved and honorable gentleman. He steals every scene that he’s in.\n\n7. Music and Lyrics (2007)\n\nDrew Barrymore is fantastic as a quirky lyricist who teams up with a washed-up ’80s pop star played by Grant. The two work together to write a chart-topping song for a current pop sensation. Marc Lawrence directed this romantic comedy that explores the challenges of reinvention and second chances. Grant is adorable as a former idol attempting a comeback.\n\n6. Two Weeks Notice (2002)\n\nThis romantic comedy, directed by Marc Lawrence, revolves around Lucy (Sandra Bullock), an environmental lawyer, and George (Hugh Grant), a wealthy real estate tycoon. When Lucy decides to quit her job, George realizes he can’t function without her, leading to a series of comedic events. Grant’s on-screen chemistry with Bullock made this one of our favorite rom-coms.\n\n5. Love Actually (2003)\n\nThis holiday classic is still going strong 20 years later. Directed by Richard Curtis, Love Actually weaves together multiple love stories in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Grant plays the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, showcasing his comedic and dramatic talents. Plus, who could forget Grant’s dance sequence to the Pointer Sisters’ Jump (For My Love). Other stars of the movie include Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley.\n\nRelated: Love Actually is Celebrating It’s 20th Anniversary — See The Cast\n\n4. Bridget Jones’s Diary (2001)\n\nThe book was an instant best seller, so it’s no wonder this movie did equally as well. In this romantic comedy directed by Sharon Maguire, Grant plays the roguish Daniel Cleaver, the love interest of Bridget Jones (Renée Zellweger). The film humorously chronicles Bridget’s attempts to navigate love, work, and societal expectations. Hugh Grant initially turned down the role of Daniel Cleaver but later reconsidered, and we are happy he did.\n\n3. About a Boy (2002)\n\nDirected by Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz, this film follows the unconventional friendship between a wealthy, commitment-phobic man (Hugh Grant) and a socially awkward young boy (Nicholas Hoult). The movie is based on Nick Hornby’s novel of the same name. Grant’s portrayal of the cynical and charming Will earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor.\n\n2. Notting Hill (1999)\n\nGrant stars as William Thacker, a London bookstore owner whose life takes an unexpected turn when he falls in love with a famous actress, Anna Scott (Julia Roberts). The film, directed by Roger Michell, explores the challenges of love in the spotlight. The iconic line, “I’m just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her,” has become one of the most memorable romantic quotes in movie history.\n\n1. Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)\n\nStarring Andie MacDowell and Kristin Scott Thomas, this is the film that put Hugh Grant movies on the map. In this romantic comedy, directed by Mike Newell, Charles (played by Grant) navigates the ups and downs of love, while attending four weddings and a funeral. The film received critical acclaim for its humor, relatable characters, and Grant’s endearing performance. The film’s success marked a turning point in Hugh Grant’s career, propelling him into international stardom.\n\nClick through for more feel good romance:\n\n80s Rom Coms: 8 of the Decade’s Most Swoon-Worthy Movies, Ranked!\n\n10 Best Period Dramas on Netflix, Ranked — Perfect For When You Need an Escape"
