        "text": "It's that time of the year again where we sit down to watch Love Actually for the 17th time and still laugh at all the jokes and enjoy every second of it as if it were the first time.\n\nThe quintessentially British Christmas rom-com was mainly filmed in London, but the all-star cast made their way to Surrey for some of the key scenes.\n\nEpsom Downs Racecourse was the setting of the famous final scene set at the arrivals hall in Heathrow Airport where the storylines of all the different stars, including Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, and Hugh Grant, come together.\n\nFind out how you can get more news from SurreyLive straight to your inbox HERE.\n\nThe racecourse has been used to film airport scenes before. In the Bond film GoldenEye it transformed into St Petersburg Airport.\n\nSandown Park in Esher gets five seconds of screen time as Milwaukee International Airport when the character of Colin arrives in America.\n\nSome of the film was shot at Shepperton Studios, also in Surrey, including the heart-warming scene where Hugh Grant dances around 10 Downing Street.\n\nUnfortunately, director Richard Curtis was only allowed in the PM's residence while supervised and had to recreate the scenes there from memory.\n\nShepperton Studios has also been used for filming Gladiator, 1917, some of the Harry Potter films, Captain America: The First Avenger, Notting Hill, and Atonement.\n\nThe real Heathrow Airport does make it into the film, as apparently real people were filmed with hidden cameras in the arrivals hall for the opening and closing sequences.\n\nThe film crew went up to people after filming them, and asked them to sign a waiver giving their permission to feature in the film.\n\nIn London, Peter and Juliet's wedding was filmed at Grosvenor Chapel in Mayfair, Harry buys a necklace at Selfridge's, and Billy Mack records his Christmas hit at Westaway Studios in Notting Hill."
