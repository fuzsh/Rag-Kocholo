        "text": "Cambridge has unsurprisingly appeared as the backdrop in a glut of Hollywood movies and TV series. The beautiful city's aesthetic has been used in a host of popular films like The Theory of Everything, Chariots of Fire, to Elizabeth: The Golden Age, as well as in TV series like Grantchester.\n\nSome of the UK's most famous, talented actors have starred in films based in the city or studied at the world-famous university. Back in 1987, Hugh Grant starred in the film Maurice just before he hit the big time in his role as Charles in the 1994 classic, Four Weddings and a Funeral.\n\nA large number of the scenes for Maurice were shot in the halls and quadrangles of beautiful King's College. However, many other parts of Cambridge city can also be spotted throughout this film. The film ended up winning big at the Venice Film Festival and was lauded at the time for tackling the subject matter of gay relationships in such a tactful and progressive way.\n\nRead more: Tom Hiddleston and Zawe Ashton expecting first child\n\nMaurice, a film based on the novel by E.M. Forster about gay love in the 20th century, features the actors James Wilby, Hugh Grant, Rupert Graves and Denholm Elliott. The tale of gay love takes place in the context of a repressive Edwardian England. It follows the main character, Maurice Hall, through university (you guessed which one) and his rollercoaster relationship with Clive (Hugh Grant).\n\nThe university mates find themselves falling in love whilst studying at Cambridge. However, to win back his place in society, Clive gives up his forbidden love for Maurice, and marries a trivial woman called Ann.\n\nMaurice, meanwhile, attempting to remedy himself of his homosexuality with a therapist, ends up falling in love with another, Alec, a gamekeeper. The pair - Maurice and Alec- after much tribulation, end up being happily reunited by the end of the film. The story is based on a true story from individuals in E.M. Forster's own life.\n\nHugh Grant confessed in the DVD extras at the end of the film, that he and James Wilby already knew each other from appearing in Grant's first film role together, and the two were able to rehearse their scenes together at Grant's house the night before Wilby's audition.\n\nGrant recalls his brother's shock when he returned from work: \"Being a surprise to my banker brother when he came home and found me kissing James Wilby in the front room\".\n\nInterestingly, in his will, Forster left the rights to the book Maurice to King's College, Cambridge, where he had originally been a student himself. The college did not want to give permission to film Maurice at first, as they believed the novel to be second-rate, and an \"inferior\" work, and were worried it would damage Forster's legacy, however, the director was \"very persuasive\". The rest is history!\n\nOne of the most memorable moments in the film, according to IMDB, can be below, an exchange between Alec and Maurice about their future together:\n\nAlec Scudder:You talk like a man who's never had to earn his living.\n\nMaurice Hall:You can do anything. Once you know what it is. We can live without money, without people. We can live without position. We're not fools. We're both strong. There'd be some place we could go.\n\nAlec Scudder:Wouldn't work, Maurice. Be the ruin of us both. Can't you see?”\n\nDo you want to watch the film? It's available on Amazon, and Netflix so there's no excuse not to go ahead and review it for yourself."
