        "text": "As we head into the home stretch of 2023, it can only mean one thing: Christmas is just around corner. So with half of the advent calendar doors now open, there’s no better time than to sit back and unwind with a few festive films.\n\nEvery year, many of us turn to some Christmassy classics to get us in the spirit of the season – favourites like Home Alone, Elf and Die Hard. But if you prefer your films with a dash of British humour and a sprinkling of romance, there’s none better than Love Actually.\n\nFrom Notting Hill writer-director Richard Curtis, the 2003 rom-com follows the love lives of eight different couples in London as told through various loosely interrelated stories, all set during a frantic month in the run up to Christmas. It boasts a huge ensemble cast including Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Martine McCutcheon and Joanna Page.\n\nREAD MORE: TV writer’s guide to the 10 best Christmas films and where you can watch them this festive season\n\nThe film was another success for Curtis upon its release, grossing almost $250 million worldwide. In the 20 years since, Love Actually has cemented itself as a festive staple and is enjoyed every year as a Christmas comfort film.\n\nIt also regularly features in lists of the best ever Christmas films. In 2021, data revealed Love Actually to be Britain’s favourite festive film, ahead of The Grinch and Home Alone.\n\nSo if you’re keen to wind down with Love Actually this Christmas, here’s how you can watch it in the UK.\n\nIs Love Actually on TV this Christmas? How to watch the Hugh Grant comedy\n\nLove Actually is streaming on Netflix over in the US. But here in the UK, it is available to watch on Sky Cinema.\n\nThis means that if you want to watch Love Actually over Christmas, you’ll need a subscription to Sky Cinema. Savvy shoppers can currently get Sky Cinema included in an awesome deal that also includes Netflix and Apple TV+.\n\nThis amazing entertainment bundle includes Sky Stream, Sky TV, Sky Cinema and Netflix for £37 a month, with customers also able to claim six months of Apple TV+ at no extra cost. This money-saving deal means bargain hunters can save almost £55 with Apple and have access to premium Sky channels like Sky Atlantic, Sky Max and Sky Documentaries, plus loads of films like Elf and May December.\n\nWhat’s more, this bundle includes all the most-talked-about new shows on Netflix and Apple TV+ including the final season of The Crown, Godzilla spin-off Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, season three of Slow Horses and Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks’ upcoming WWII epic Masters of the Air. Those looking to upgrade their broadband can also add Sky’s Superfast broadband with 35Mb/s for an extra £13 a month.\n\nLove Actually is also available to buy on Amazon’s Prime Video for £3.99."
