        "text": "IT'S a beloved British classic and must-see Christmas viewing for millions in the festive season.\n\nBut this week one of Love Actually's child stars, Lulu Popplewell, resurfaced and branded the yuletide favourite \"cheesy and sexist.\"\n\nLulu played Emma Thompson's daughter - who famously dresses as a lobster for the school nativity - when she was 12.\n\nSpeaking on the Almost Famous podcast, she said: \"I think it's a s**t film.\n\n\"I think it's aged badly. All the women in it are sort of passive objects. I think that there was an article describing them as passive objects to be acquired.\"\n\nNow a comedian, the 29-year sparked a slew of comments with fans saying she is unrecognisable as the child actor in the 2003 movie - but she's not the only one.\n\nWant to know what happened to Joanna the singing schoolgirl or Sam, the cute kid who was in love with her? Here Fabulous Digital explores where the stars are now, 17 years down the line...\n\nOlivia Olson\n\nOlivia stole the show when she sang Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas is You at just 11 years old.\n\nNow the American actress is 28, living in LA, and you may have followed her on this year's Celebrity X Factor, where she ended up coming 12th.\n\nOlivia has also been part of the cast behind the animated series Adventure Time on Cartoon network, where she voices Marceline the Vampire Queen.\n\nShe has also worked on Disney's Phineas and Ferb, where she voices Vanessa Doofenshmirtz.\n\nThomas Brodie-Sangster\n\nIn Love Actually, Thomas stole hearts as the adorable stepson son of Liam Neeson's character.\n\nGame of Thrones fans will recall that the young actor starred in the hit HBO series as Jojen Reed, who is tasked with protecting Bran Stark.\n\nThe 30-year-old also starred in the movie franchise Maze Runner and has also featured in Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens and Phineas Ferb.\n\nHis latest role is in the chess drama The Queen's Gambit, opposite Anya Taylor-Joy, which drops on Netflix on Friday.\n\nHeike Makatsch\n\nGerman actress Heike Makatsch became one of the biggest villains of Christmas when her character Mia flirted with her married boss Harry, played by the late Alan Rickman, in the movie.\n\nOne of the most emotional scenes saw Harry buy Mia a gold necklace, which his wife Karen, played by Emma Thompson, thought was for her.\n\nAfter flirty Mia, Heike played Leisel's mother in the movie version of The Book Thief in 2013.\n\nAndrew Lincoln\n\nAnother heartbreaking love scene is when Andrew Lincoln's character Mark struggles with his feelings for his best friend's wife Juliet, played by Keira Knightley.\n\nOne of the most memorable scenes from the film sees him express his love to Juliet via some cardboard signs outside her house.\n\nSince his tragic storyline in Love Actually, Andrew's career has boomed, starring in AMC series The Walking Dead as sheriff deputy Rick Grimes.\n\nKeira Knightley\n\nKeira was just 18 years old when she played Juliet in Love Actually, and she's added numerous film credits to her list ever since.\n\nShe was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in Pride and Prejudice and The Imitation Game.\n\nKeira is now one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood, and has stolen the show in movies such as Pirates of the Caribbean and The Duchess.\n\nHugh Grant\n\nHugh Grant was one of the more lovable characters in the Christmas film, playing the newly-elected Prime Minister David.\n\nHe's gone on to do the Bridget Jones sequel, The Edge of Reason, but declined the offer to star in the third and recent movie, Bridget Jones's Baby, released in 2016, unlike co-star Colin Firth.\n\nHugh has starred in the likes of Paddington 2, Did You Hear About the Morgans and The Rewrite.\n\nColin Firth\n\nColin was a hit in Love Actually starring as heartbroken Jamie, who finds his wife has been cheating on him with his brother.\n\nThankfully it wasn't all sad for Jamie, who ended up finding love with his Portuguese housekeeper.\n\nColin has certainly kept busy since his Love Actually days, adding The King's Speech, Tom Ford's A Single Man, and the John le Carré adaptation Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy under his belt.\n\nHe also starred in the third Bridget Jones movie in 2016.\n\nRowan Atkinson\n\nWho can forget Rowan's hilarious performance in Love Actually as annoying jewellery salesman Rufus?\n\nOf course, Rowan is no stranger to comedy, and has gone on to star in numerous Mr Bean and Johnny English sequels.\n\nThe most recent, Johnny English 3, was released last year, and saw him feature opposite the film's Prime Minister, played by fellow Love Actually favourite Emma Thompson.\n\nMartine McCutcheon\n\nFormer Eastender stars, Martine was memorable in Love Actually as the cheerful Downing Street staff member who swore at the Prime Minister, but ends up winning his heart.\n\nMartine has since proved her talents off the screen on the stage, winning an Olivier for her role as Eliza in My Fair Lady in the West End.\n\nShe has also kept busy on Spooks, in a Tesco ad and has even published a novel called The Mistress.\n\nMartine has also been a panellist on Loose Women, alongside the likes of Katie Price, Andrea McLean, Nadia Swahala and Ruth Langsford.\n\nShe is married to singer Jack McManus and has a five-year-old son, Rafferty.\n\nMartin Freeman\n\nMartin has also had an impressive string of movies since Love Actually, where he played John, a stand-in on adult films.\n\nHe has gone on to feature in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Hot Fuzz and Nativity!\n\nHowever, two of his biggest gigs to date are him landing the roles of Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit, with the first movie being released in 2012, and Dr John Watson in Sherlock from 2010 to 2017.\n\nHe starred in Black Panther in 2018 and has recently starred in the TV comedy Breeders, opposite Daisy Haggard.\n\nJanuary Jones\n\nJanuary played Jeannie, one of the attractive American girls that sex-obsessed Colin bumps into in Wisconsin.\n\nShe was the ringleader of the group of girls who fall for his English accent and charms.\n\nA few years later in 2007, she was cast as Betty Draper in Mad Men, which ran until 2015.\n\nAlan Rickman\n\nAlan was already an acting legend when he starred as Harry in Love Actually, having been in Die Hard, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and Sense and Sensibility, with Love Actually co-stars Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant.\n\nHe had already taken on the iconic role of Severus Snape in the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nTragically, Alan passed away in 2016 at the age of 69, having won a Bafta, Emmy, a Golden Globe and a SAG in his lifetime.\n\nWe shared how there was a classic scene in Love Actually that Hugh Grant absolutely hated shooting.\n\nAnd Love Actually fans can move into charming £2m mews house from iconic scene in film."
