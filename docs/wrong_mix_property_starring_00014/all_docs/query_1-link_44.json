Grant plays a commitment-phobe who finds out he might have to change his ways after his girlfriend becomes pregnant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrant reprised his role as Daniel Cleaver in ‘Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason’ in 2004\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 27%\n\nGrant's Daniel Cleaver was killed off for the most recent Jones movie, \"Bridget Jones's Baby,\" but he takes a more pivotal role in this one as he flies out to Thailand to work with Bridget, who becomes his lover again for a period of time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played Meredith Potter in 1995's 'An Awfully Big Adventure'\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 36%\n\nThe movie's title is taken from the classic quote from J.M.

Also starring Alan Rickman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2006, he played the host of a talent show in 'American Dreamz'\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 38%\n\nThis cultural satire almost sounds like a \"Black Mirror\" episode made today.

The village, outraged, try to prove him wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrant starred in 'Music and Lyrics' as Alex Fletcher in 2007\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 63%\n\nA washed-up singer turned lyricist (Grant) gets another shot at a comeback when a famous teenage singer asks him to write a chart-topping hit.

This classic Christmas movie boasts an astonishing cast of British stars, but Grant comes close to stealing the movie all by himself as the Prime Minister who dances through Number 10 and learns to stand up for his country after he falls in love with a member of the Downing Street household staff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1988, Grant played Lord James D'Ampton in 'The Lair of the White Worm'\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score: 65%\n\nThis British horror movie sees a young Peter Capaldi as an archaeologist who finds a strange-looking skull at an excavation site.
