        "text": "Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves trailer\n\nHugh Grant has a long and eclectic filmography and has starred in countless movies over the years. For the longest time, he was a romantic-comedy actor who was always getting the girl at the last minute, but he has since transitioned into a new period of his career. In the recently released Dungeons & Dragons: Honour Among Thieves, he plays Forge, a dastardly rogue who doesn't care who he hurts as long as he gets paid. The same kind of cut-throat energy is still present in Grant in real life, it may seem, as he recently explained how much he hated a major movie from his past.\n\nGrant recently appeared on The Late Late Show with James Corden to promote the fantasy movie this week, where he got involved in a different kind of game (sadly, this one doesn't involve dice).\n\nThe Notting Hill star was thrown into Corden's game: Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts. In it, he was given two options: Answer a tough question, or eat a horrific mix of \"worm and mayonnaise shepherd's pie\".\n\nWhile on the hot seat, Grant was quizzed over which film he would happily remove from his IMDB page.\n\nWith a grimace, he pointed out: \"The thing is, I would happily shred my CV because I specialised in being bad for decades really.\"\n\nRegardless of how much disdain he held for his career, Grant went on: \"As you know, as someone in the industry, it’s one thing for me to say that I was bad, but I can’t bring down the rest of the wonderful colleagues who worked with me on any film by saying it was bad, so that’s my dilemma.\"\n\nGrant paused, and with that said, confirmed his choice: \"The Lady And The Highwayman.\"\n\nNever heard of it? You wouldn't be the only one. The Lady And The Highwayman is a British romantic-adventure TV movie released in 1989. It was actually one of Grant's first-ever projects.\n\nDescribing the movie, the 62-year-old actor said: \"I’m a highwayman, I’m meant to be sexy, low-budget, bad wig, bad hat. I look like Deputy Dawg.\" (sic)\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He continued: \"When I’m tense, my voice goes up two octaves so Deputy Dawg would come leaping out of trees when a carriage went past and go: ‘Stand and deliver!’ And, it’s poor.”\n\nAlthough the actor looks back on it undesirably now, it no doubt helped him get to where he is these days, so it can't all be bad.\n\nWith that said, he no doubt still has the experience on his mind, as Grant previously admitted to second-guessing film scripts when they land on his desk.\n\nIn particular, he admitted he almost didn't take the Dungeons & Dragons role of Forge when he first received the script.\n\nGrant told the BBC: \"My agent said: 'I'm going to send you this Dungeon and Dragons thing.' I thought: 'I don't think that's for me dear.'\"\n\n\"Then I read it,\" he went on. \"And it's, like, really hilarious. The two Jonathans who wrote and directed it must have been very steeped in Monty Python or something. Because it was a properly funny script.\" (Via BBC)\n\nThe door has since been left open for his character, Forge, to return to the series in the future.\n\nDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is in cinemas now."
