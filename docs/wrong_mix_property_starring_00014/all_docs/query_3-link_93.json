        "text": "When you’ve been in the moviemaking business for as long as Hugh Grant has, you’ve earned the right to take whatever kinds of chances you want in the roles you choose. If that means poking a little fun at your own image as an aging, curmudgeonly actor whose best roles may be behind him (though we’d argue that’s certainly not true) or going completely off the rails as a digitally created Oompa Loompa in the new Wonka film, that’s your prerogative.\n\nAfter years of struggling to get away from the kinds of romantic roles he was being offered after his breakthrough performance in Four Weddings And A Funeral, it’s been fascinating to track the progression of Grant’s projects as he continues to push boundaries on his own terms. If he ever cared what audiences thought of him, he certainly doesn’t anymore. And lately it seems as if he’s found a new sort of niche that suits him. That doesn’t mean we love his performances in beloved rom-coms like Notting Hill and Love Actually any less. He’s an actor of many talents.\n\nHere, then, are our favorite Hugh Grant performances ranging from the most stable characters to the most delightfully unhinged."
