        "text": "While the debate rumbles on over who should play the next 007, here’s an idea for the next Bond villain: Hugh Grant. Okay, sure, sounds ludicrous but consider that one of his newest roles, Guy Ritchie’s Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre, has him playing a kind of modern-day version of Brad Whitaker in The Living Daylights – only much, much more fun – and his CV reads like one long audition for the pinnacle of big-screen villainy.\n\nAnd if the James Bond dream doesn’t come to pass – and lord knows, Grant would help puncture the aura of melancholy that settled over the franchise during the late Craig era – there’s still pleasure to be had in taking stock of his career arc to date. Those foppish early days as a romcom stalwart, all floppy curtains and golly-gosh self-effacement, have given way to a run of arch antiheroes, straight-up bad guys, and at least one cannibal. Few actors are making being bad look like so much fun as mid-career Grant."
