        "text": "Profession: Actor and Producer\n\nBiography: Hugh Grant's first leading film role was in \"Maurice\" (1987) based on the E.M. Forster novel, for which he won Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival. However it was the 1994 romantic comedy \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" that propelled Grant to international fame. The film, written by Richard Curtis, was made cheaply but became a worldwide hit.\n\nGrant has since made a number of other Richard Curtis films including \"Notting Hill\" (1999) with Julia Roberts and was one of a large ensemble cast of \"Love Actually\" (2003). The roles cemented Grant's onscreen persona as a bumbling but charming Englishman.\n\nIn recent years Grant has gained considerable acclaim for a number of more nuanced roles, he was nominated for a various awards for his part in \"Florence Foster Jenkins\" opposite Meryl Streep, and for his 1st television role for 25 years the Stephen Frears directed \"A Very British Scandal\" (2018).\n\nThroughout his career Grant's personal life has attracted much media attention, particularly his relationship with Elizabeth Hurley. More recently Grant became a prominent spokesperson during the New of the World phone hacking scandal in the UK and against the role of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in general.\n\nBorn: September 9, 1960\n\nBirthplace: London, United Kingdom\n\nAge: 63 years old"
