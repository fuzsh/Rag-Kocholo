        "text": "Hugh Grant has admitted that he struggled with filming one of the most iconic scenes in Love Actually.\n\nWith Christmas just around the corner, the movie is always on everyone's watch list as one of the most legendary feel-good festive offerings to get cosy on the sofa with.\n\nFans of the flick all have their favourite scenes from the love-filled plot - and it seems that one of the leading stars also has a scene that's stuck in his head over the past 20 years.\n\nThe actor has been reminiscing about filming the British Romantic Comedy and how he was less than comfortable filming one fan-favourite moment when he signed up to star as heroic Prime Minister David.\n\nHugh, 62, won the hearts of everyone watching when he played the bumbling member of parliament who fell in love with a member of his household staff.\n\nThe gorgeous lady in question, potty-mouthed Londoner Natalie, was played by none other than brunette beauty Martine McCutcheon.\n\nViewers were in awe of the unlikely coupling, the repercussions of which resulted in a scene that has been endlessly shared on social media over the years.\n\nThe special moment sees David perform an epic dance around No10 Downing Street to Jump by The Pointer Sisters after he takes on Billy Bob Thornton's sleazy President who he witnessed hitting on Natalie.\n\nHowever, while viewers may love the scene, Hugh has confessed that he wanted it to be axed as he wasn't happy to do it.\n\nTalking to Diane Sawyer for ABC’s The Laughter & Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Years Later Hugh outlined his embarrassment.\n\nHe said: “I saw it in the script and I thought, ‘Well, I’ll hate doing that’,” he recalled. “I didn’t fancy doing the dance at all, let alone rehearsing it. And I’m out of rhythm, by the way, especially at the beginning when I wiggle my arse.\"\n\nBut he admitted that despite his dismay at it the routine has its fans. He continued: “To this day, there’s many people - and I agree with them - who think it’s the most excruciating scene ever committed to celluloid. But then some people like it!”\n\nMovie director Richard Curtis then explained how Hugh \"kept saying no\" to the scene.\n\nHe said: “I think he was hoping I’d get ill or something and we’d say, ‘Oh, well, what a shame, we’ll have to lose that dancing sequence.\"\n\nHe also described a “contractual obligation” that meant Hugh had to perform the dance, which the suave actor went on to jokingly describe as a “contractual guillotine.\"\n\nThe Love Actually Reunion is due to air in the US on November 29."
