        "text": "Hello hello!\n\nTwo years ago, I did a bit of a round up of my favourite films and TV shows for 2021. Last year, it didn’t happen but this year I’m back for a few roundups about movies, TV, and books and podcasts that I’ve engaged with over the course of 2023 – all being the main forms of entertainment I spend my time with.\n\nLet’s start with movie films. Please bear in mind that this serves as a personal ranking, not one of critical quality. I haven’t by any means seen everything that might qualify for a critical top 10 this year.\n\nThat said, here we go…\n\nContinue reading “2023 in MOVIES: My Top 10” →\n\nIt would be fair to say that Richard Curtis’ crowd pleaser Love Actually is not hard hitting political discourse, but one of its central plot threads does warrant closer examination.\n\nCurtis’ film is a loose-knit, Altman-esque character piece under the central umbrella of ‘love’, mostly involving Curtis’ traditional retinue of cloyingly middle class Londoners living in a fantasy version of Britain’s capital where everyone has money, time to navel-gaze, and doesn’t worry about laws such as breaching airport security gates and things like that. It is, simply, a load of sickeningly twee nonsense inflated, bizarrely, into some kind of totemic Christmas film that only humbugs suggest might not just be rubbish, but also contain numerous creepy plots and almost sociopathic characters.\n\nYou only have to look at Andrew Lincoln wooing Keira Knightley with cue cards on the doorstep of the house she shares not only with her boyfriend, but his best friend.\n\nLeaving that aside, there is one plot line in Love Actually that bears looking at, given outside of Emma Thompson’s genuinely moving performance as the wife of a cheater, it probably stands as the only thread in the film that is easy to stomach: the romance between Hugh Grant’s incumbent British Prime Minister and Martine McCutcheon’s cockney Downing Street tea girl. There is a charm about their characters that belies the rest of the film, even if it bears almost zero reality with anything else in British politics, bar the thinnest of tangential nods and winks to both the Blairite and Bush eras – fitting as the film was made and is set during their tenures, and at the point tensions were fraying.\n\nLove Actually might here be political fantasy, but it has one foot in post-9/11 reality.\n\nContinue reading “LOVE ACTUALLY: A Fairytale in Downing St | Film Feature” →\n\nTo my shame, I had never heard of Beasts before Andrew Screen’s forensic exploration of this 1976 series, The Book of Beasts, came to my attention.\n\nFrom the pen of Nigel Kneale, one of Britain’s greatest screenwriters of horror and science-fiction during the 20th century, Beasts was an anthology series of six episodes that aired on ATV, an ITV subsidiary in the 70s, each of which circulated around the idea of a ‘creature’ of some description that would play into domestic or workplace horror. Different characters, different scenarios, yet an overarching thematic tether.\n\nAnthology series were nothing new to television either in Britain or America, with many from the 1950s onwards telling stories that would inspire generations of storytellers. Beasts, however, doesn’t seem to have escaped the 1970s to the same degree other of Kneale’s creations have, such as the various Quatermass TV shows and films, or chilling one-shots such as The Stone Tape.\n\nDare I suggest, Beasts generally is a little forgotten.\n\nContinue reading “THE BOOK OF BEASTS (Andrew Screen) | Book Review + Author Interview” →\n\nIt’s been a heck of a year for Martin Scorsese, what with the build up and critically feted release of Killers of the Flower Moon, not to mention his ongoing cultural battle with the legions of popcorn fodder fandom. He’s also been doing a lot of TikTok-ing, because of course he has.\n\nMany a cinema fan will have used the opportunity of a new Scorsese picture, which doesn’t roll off the production line every year, as an excuse to revisit his vibrant and eclectic filmography. What’s your Scorsese poison? I’m partial to a bit of Goodfellas, a bit of Raging Bull, and actually more of his darkly comic output such as After Hours and The King of Comedy. They’re very much my jam.\n\nOne of his earliest being re-released as 2024 begins is Mean Streets, which first arrived in 1973 before Scorsese made his name significantly with Taxi Driver a couple of years later. One of the ‘new wave’ of American auteurs emerging from the ashes of the studio system in the 1960s, Scorsese earned his spurs with deliberately New York-centric explorations of his own sense of Catholic guilt, upbringing and meaning, that conflict with modern times.\n\nContinue reading “MEAN STREETS (1973) | Blu-Ray Review” →\n\nAn old friend of mine, enjoying my surname, would often refer to me as ‘Monsieur Noir‘, perhaps unaware that noir is best associated with a cinematic style that transcends nations. Noir is, and always has been, global.\n\nRadiance, a fairly new boutique brand on the block, set out to make that point with their World Noir Vol. 1 set, a copy of which they were kind enough to furnish me with. Though by no means an expert in noir, with plenty of education in British and American terms yet to come, it has always interested me as a sub-genre. The chance to catch several fairly obscure international examples of the form was too good to pass up.\n\nThis set contains three pictures – Japan’s Ore wa matteru ze aka I Am Waiting from 1957, France’s Un temoin dans la ville aka Witness in the City, from 1959, and Italy’s Un maledetto imbroglio aka The Facts of Murder, also from 1959 – the only film of the set I was not sent, so I’ll just list features it contains in that case and talk a little more about the preceding two films.\n\nContinue reading “WORLD NOIR Vol. 1 | Blu-Ray Review” →\n\nThe recent passing of actor Dean Sullivan, aka Brookside’s Jimmy Corkhill, stirred inside me a reminder of the very last episode of the Channel 4 soap opera. 80 minutes of pure, working class dystopian horror that you almost can’t believe was broadcast in 2003.\n\nBefore we get to that, a quick reminder about Brookside, a serial these days in danger of drifting into the mists of television past. Created in 1982, on the launch of Britain’s fourth TV channel, by Phil Redmond—who had previously developed popular BBC children’s serial Grange Hill—Brookside offered British audiences the third regular, successful soap experience after Coronation Street and Emmerdale Farm, both on ITV.\n\nPredating the BBC’s EastEnders by three years, a show destined to long outlive it in longevity and popularity, Brookside followed Corrie and Emmerdale’s leads with a northern setting, in this case a suburban close in Liverpool. As Coronation Street evoked the working class manufacturing roots of Manchester, and later EastEnders the rough edged capitalism of London, so too did Brookside capture the Scouse mindset across the 1980s – that of a militant rebuke to Thatcher’s Britain.\n\nContinue reading “Revisiting the terrifying, dystopian finale of BROOKSIDE” →\n\nRegular readers or followers of mine might recall that over the summer I started a BookTube channel. Alternatively, you might not given ‘Black’s Books’ didn’t last very long. I put out several videos talking about books, which I enjoyed doing, but an appropriately bookending holiday in Croatia threw me off and I never really recovered.\n\nIt was also primarily that BookTube is work. In advance of starting my own channel, I digested quite a bit of BookTube after starting a job as a school librarian and really enjoyed the nature of it. As you can see from previous adventures, I’m a bit fascinated by YouTube and feel behind the curve in not properly exploring it. Podcasts and the written word remain by preserve but YouTube, or equivalents, feel more like the future.\n\nHats off to creators such as Roy Bayfield, the man behind Roy Reads Anything, because BookTube is not easy. You need the right camera. You need the right microphone. The right editing software. The right amount of time to record and edit. And this is before the obvious reading required and thinking about BookTube ideas for ‘content’ (oh how I hate that word). You can see why some consider it a full-time job. How people balance it with work is beyond me.\n\nContinue reading “BookTube: ROY READS ANYTHING | Profile + Interview” →\n\nIn the summer of 2021, I had an unexpected slide into my Twitter DMs from David Baldwin, a producer and programmer at the Midland Arts Centre (known as the MAC) just outside of Birmingham.\n\nHe was kicking off a new venture called Square Eyes for November of that year, a festival geared around television across the decades, from highlighting archived material, celebrating historical and modern shows, and leaning toward the future. As his pitch document stated: “As the development of new TV studios continues in Birmingham and the Midlands becomes more and more visible on screen – whether via reality shows like The Rap Game or All That Glitters, or dramas like Small Axe and Peaky Blinders – it feels like the perfect time to launch a TV festival in the UK’s second city.”\n\nThough I had decamped from living in Birmingham six months earlier, in the throes of the pandemic, and was now ensconsed as an ex-pat in the West Country, I was thrilled to be involved in what David wanted to create. I’d seen Birmingham begin to grow in confidence as an artistic hub as the city was shaped by investment and infrastructure, over the last couple of decades, and like many I was sick of London getting all the opportunities. This felt like something Birmingham needed.\n\nContinue reading “Birmingham’s SQUARE EYES TV Festival 2023 | Event Preview + Interview with curator David Baldwin” →\n\nThe name Russell T. Davies has never gone away in television circles but is about to go stratospheric, as his return to showrunning Doctor Who kickstarts perhaps the most exciting tenure for that series in almost twenty years – since, indeed, he revived the institution from non-existence.\n\nGay Aliens and Queer Folk is a celebration of the man, the worlds he creates and the impact he continues to have on LGBTQ storytelling. Davies is a big, bold character, coming of age as a writer in children’s television (penning such memorable series as Children’s Ward and the nightmare fuel that was Dark Season), before edging close to soap opera (raised as he was on the earthy working class drama of Coronation Street), before breaking out into mainstream awareness with Queer as Folk, a revolutionary show about gay men that bridges the 90s and 00s in the perfect manner.\n\nContinue reading “GAY ALIENS AND QUEER FOLK: How Russell T. Davies Changed TV (Emily Garside) | Book Review + Author Interview” →"
