        "text": "There we have it. Another year bites the dust. 2023 has rocketed by and I thought I’d close off the year with some thoughts on the last 12 months, and some reflections on my own work and journey.\n\nFirstly, if you’re reading this, thanks. My website is fairly deep cut so I can only assume you’re interested in me and my work if you’re engaging in this post, and I do appreciate it. Trying to get people’s eyes on the written word right now is hard, with no easy recipe. I’m not one for ‘SEO’ and all that stuff to engage the algorithm. I’m old fashioned and subscribe to the ‘if you write it, they will come’ method. So thanks for coming.\n\nEspecially as the use of this website has been fairly sporadic this year, and weighted more on the last few months. There are several reasons. Chiefly, book writing, which I’ll come to a bit later, also writing for other sites (again, I’ll get to that). But also because I’ve only recently begun to figure out what I want this website to do, which I feel is evident in some of the material over the last couple of months, which if you’ve been here before you might note is a shade different.\n\nContinue reading “That Was the Year That Was: Reflections on 2023 and plans for 2024” →\n\nHello folks!\n\nTwo years ago, I did a bit of a round up of my favourite films and TV shows for 2021. Last year, it didn’t happen but this year I’m back for a few roundups about movies, TV, and books and podcasts that I’ve engaged with over the course of 2023 – all being the main forms of entertainment I spend my time with.\n\nMy last top 10 is of TV shows, of which once again I’ve watched an inordinate amount. Some old, a lot new. Should top out at around 900 episodes of TV watched across the year, slightly under from last, and likely way more than next year will bring with a baby in the house! Anyhow, these are my choices, again based on what I’ve watched, with some honourable and dishonourable mentions at the end.\n\nTurn on the box and let’s delve in…\n\nContinue reading “2023 in TV: My Top 10” →\n\nHey everyone!\n\nTwo years ago, I did a bit of a round up of my favourite films and TV shows for 2021. Last year, it didn’t happen but this year I’m back for a few roundups about movies, TV, and books and podcasts that I’ve engaged with over the course of 2023 – all being the main forms of entertainment I spend my time with.\n\nNext up we have books. Now not all of these are new releases this year, rather books I’ve read for the first time and enjoyed. I wish I could keep up with all the new releases out there but that’s just impossible. I’ve read close to 50 books this year, possibly a personal record, but this is a choice list of those I’ve enjoyed the most.\n\nLet’s open the page…\n\nContinue reading “2023 in BOOKS: My Top 10” →\n\nHi folks!\n\nTwo years ago, I did a bit of a round up of my favourite films and TV shows for 2021.

Please bear in mind that this serves as a personal ranking, not one of critical quality. I am also omitting podcasts that I have produced or developed myself, just to avoid accusations of navel gazing. I might flag some of those up in a more personal list, we’ll see.\n\nOn we go, then…\n\nContinue reading “2023 in PODCASTS: My Top 10” →\n\nHello hello!\n\nTwo years ago, I did a bit of a round up of my favourite films and TV shows for 2021.

Please bear in mind that this serves as a personal ranking, not one of critical quality.

It is, simply, a load of sickeningly twee nonsense inflated, bizarrely, into some kind of totemic Christmas film that only humbugs suggest might not just be rubbish, but also contain numerous creepy plots and almost sociopathic characters.\n\nYou only have to look at Andrew Lincoln wooing Keira Knightley with cue cards on the doorstep of the house she shares not only with her boyfriend, but his best friend.\n\nLeaving that aside, there is one plot line in Love Actually that bears looking at, given outside of Emma Thompson’s genuinely moving performance as the wife of a cheater, it probably stands as the only thread in the film that is easy to stomach: the romance between Hugh Grant’s incumbent British Prime Minister and Martine McCutcheon’s cockney Downing Street tea girl. There is a charm about their characters that belies the rest of the film, even if it bears almost zero reality with anything else in British politics, bar the thinnest of tangential nods and winks to both the Blairite and Bush eras – fitting as the film was made and is set during their tenures, and at the point tensions were fraying.\n\nLove Actually might here be political fantasy, but it has one foot in post-9/11 reality.\n\nContinue reading “LOVE ACTUALLY: A Fairytale in Downing St | Film Feature” →\n\nTo my shame, I had never heard of Beasts before Andrew Screen’s forensic exploration of this 1976 series, The Book of Beasts, came to my attention.\n\nFrom the pen of Nigel Kneale, one of Britain’s greatest screenwriters of horror and science-fiction during the 20th century, Beasts was an anthology series of six episodes that aired on ATV, an ITV subsidiary in the 70s, each of which circulated around the idea of a ‘creature’ of some description that would play into domestic or workplace horror. Different characters, different scenarios, yet an overarching thematic tether.\n\nAnthology series were nothing new to television either in Britain or America, with many from the 1950s onwards telling stories that would inspire generations of storytellers. Beasts, however, doesn’t seem to have escaped the 1970s to the same degree other of Kneale’s creations have, such as the various Quatermass TV shows and films, or chilling one-shots such as The Stone Tape.\n\nDare I suggest, Beasts generally is a little forgotten.\n\nContinue reading “THE BOOK OF BEASTS (Andrew Screen) | Book Review + Author Interview” →\n\nIt’s been a heck of a year for Martin Scorsese, what with the build up and critically feted release of Killers of the Flower Moon, not to mention his ongoing cultural battle with the legions of popcorn fodder fandom. He’s also been doing a lot of TikTok-ing, because of course he has.\n\nMany a cinema fan will have used the opportunity of a new Scorsese picture, which doesn’t roll off the production line every year, as an excuse to revisit his vibrant and eclectic filmography. What’s your Scorsese poison? I’m partial to a bit of Goodfellas, a bit of Raging Bull, and actually more of his darkly comic output such as After Hours and The King of Comedy. They’re very much my jam.\n\nOne of his earliest being re-released as 2024 begins is Mean Streets, which first arrived in 1973 before Scorsese made his name significantly with Taxi Driver a couple of years later. One of the ‘new wave’ of American auteurs emerging from the ashes of the studio system in the 1960s, Scorsese earned his spurs with deliberately New York-centric explorations of his own sense of Catholic guilt, upbringing and meaning, that conflict with modern times.\n\nContinue reading “MEAN STREETS (1973) | Blu-Ray Review” →\n\nAn old friend of mine, enjoying my surname, would often refer to me as ‘Monsieur Noir‘, perhaps unaware that noir is best associated with a cinematic style that transcends nations. Noir is, and always has been, global.\n\nRadiance, a fairly new boutique brand on the block, set out to make that point with their World Noir Vol. 1 set, a copy of which they were kind enough to furnish me with. Though by no means an expert in noir, with plenty of education in British and American terms yet to come, it has always interested me as a sub-genre. The chance to catch several fairly obscure international examples of the form was too good to pass up.\n\nThis set contains three pictures – Japan’s Ore wa matteru ze aka I Am Waiting from 1957, France’s Un temoin dans la ville aka Witness in the City, from 1959, and Italy’s Un maledetto imbroglio aka The Facts of Murder, also from 1959 – the only film of the set I was not sent, so I’ll just list features it contains in that case and talk a little more about the preceding two films.\n\nContinue reading “WORLD NOIR Vol. 1 | Blu-Ray Review” →\n\nThe recent passing of actor Dean Sullivan, aka Brookside’s Jimmy Corkhill, stirred inside me a reminder of the very last episode of the Channel 4 soap opera. 80 minutes of pure, working class dystopian horror that you almost can’t believe was broadcast in 2003.\n\nBefore we get to that, a quick reminder about Brookside, a serial these days in danger of drifting into the mists of television past. Created in 1982, on the launch of Britain’s fourth TV channel, by Phil Redmond—who had previously developed popular BBC children’s serial Grange Hill—Brookside offered British audiences the third regular, successful soap experience after Coronation Street and Emmerdale Farm, both on ITV.\n\nPredating the BBC’s EastEnders by three years, a show destined to long outlive it in longevity and popularity, Brookside followed Corrie and Emmerdale’s leads with a northern setting, in this case a suburban close in Liverpool. As Coronation Street evoked the working class manufacturing roots of Manchester, and later EastEnders the rough edged capitalism of London, so too did Brookside capture the Scouse mindset across the 1980s – that of a militant rebuke to Thatcher’s Britain.\n\nContinue reading “Revisiting the terrifying, dystopian finale of BROOKSIDE” →"
