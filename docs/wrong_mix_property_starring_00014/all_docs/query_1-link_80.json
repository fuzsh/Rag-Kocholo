        "text": "It’s hard to pick a favourite scene in the much-loved 2003 rom-com, but most fans would agree the part where Hugh Grant — as David, the Prime Minister — dances around his Downing Street home to Jump would have to be right up there.\n\nIt’s a shame the actor himself doesn’t agree.\n\nIn fact, Grant absolutely hated filming that scene.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Beast, director Richard Curtis revealed the truth: \"[Hugh] was hugely grumpy about it.\n\n\"The fault line was the dance, because there was no way he could do that in a prime ministerial manner.\n\n\"He kept on putting it off, and he didn’t like the song — it was originally a Jackson 5 song, but we couldn’t get it — so he was hugely unhappy about it.\n\n\"We didn’t shoot it until the final day and it went so well that when we edited it, it had gone too well, and he was singing along with the words.\n\n\"When you edit a dance sequence like that, it’s going to be a third of the length, and the bit he’s singing the words to isn’t going to be the bit of that moment, so it was incredibly hard to edit.\"\n\nHere are some other facts about your favourite Christmas film that you probably didn’t know:\n\nLove Actually was meant to be two separate films\n\nThe legendary rom-com director Richard Curtis told Vulture that he was originally working on two films, one about Hugh Grant’s character and the other about Colin Firth’s character.\n\nHe said: “I’d worked out whole films on those subjects, and then I thought, ‘Oh, I don’t want to do these because they are just turning out to be a shape I know’.\"\n\nAndrew Lincoln thought his character was a \"stalker\"\n\nIt’s a pivotal moment in the movie, but when Mark, played by Andrew Lincoln, told his best friend’s wife Juliet (Keira Knightley) that he loved her via a series of handwritten signs — the actor was a bit unsure about it.\n\n\"He [Mark] is a stalker,\" Lincoln later told TheWrap.\n\n\"That was my question to Richard Curtis, ‘Do you not think we’re sort of borderline stalker territory here?’ And he said, ‘No, no. Not with you playing it, darling. You’ll be alright’.”\n\nFun fact: Lincoln wrote those signs himself.\n\nThe movie stole a scene from Four Weddings and a Funeral\n\nThe scene where Colin accidentally insults the caterer’s food to her face while attempting to flirt was originally written for Hugh Grant’s character in Four Weddings and a Funeral, but was cut in the final stages of editing — so it was recycled.\n\nClaudia Schiffer was never supposed to be in the movie\n\nThe original script referred to the blonde character as someone who looked similar to Claudia Schiffer.\n\nBut the director had trouble finding an actor who fit the mould, so they approached the supermodel to see if she was interested.\n\n“It was funny how it ended up, you know, him getting the real deal. I just thought it was brilliant,” Love Actually star Elisha Cuthbert said to VH1.com.\n\nLaura Linney's casting was inevitable\n\nCurtis auditioned many actors for the part of hopelessly-in-love office worker Sarah, but kept saying he wanted someone “like Laura Linney”.\n\nEventually, the casting director snapped and said: “Oh for f**k’s sake, get Laura Linney then.”\n\nShe auditioned — and of course, landed the role.\n\nEmma Thompson wore a fat suit\n\nThe director felt the Academy award-winning actor was too thin and needed some help from the costume department to achieve the ‘mumsy’ look.\n\nThe airport scenes at the beginning and end of the film are real people\n\nThe crew had cameras set up at Heathrow Airport for a week filming real people as they greeted their loved ones."
