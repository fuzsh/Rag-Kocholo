Love Actually Live is billed as a “multimedia concert celebration of the beloved holiday film,” featuring top recording artists and actors reinterpreting many of the songs and scenes from the hit film for the small stage.\n\nFirst performed in 2018, Love Actually Live played at the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills for two seasons, before the COVID-19 pandemic put the show on hiatus last year. Now, after more than a year of people spending time apart, the holiday season is looking a little more joyful in 2021, with the show returning to the Wallis for a limited-run engagement.\n\nPerformances for Love Actually Live will run from Saturday, November 27 to Friday, December 31. Tickets to the family show range from $35 to $125 and will be available at TheWallis.org/Love. The show features a cast of singers and dancers interpreting some of the most iconic musical moments from the 2003 film, while the corresponding movie scene plays on screen. A live orchestra accompanies the performers, as they reimagine songs from the film’s hit soundtrack including, “Christmas is All Around,” “The Trouble With Love,” and Joni Mitchell’s “Both Sides Now.”\n\nPrevious productions have featured cast members like Rumer Willis, Tony winner (for Once) Steve Kazee, The Voice star Chris Mann and country singer Aubrie Sellers. Casting for this year’s production is expected to be announced soon.\n\nLove Actually Live is a co-production from the team behind Los Angeles’ award-winning “For The Record” series and the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts. This is an officially-sanctioned production, with the team receiving permission from Universal Pictures and Universal Theatrical Group for the immersive, Broadway-style adaptation.\n\n“Love Actually Live provides the opportunity to celebrate together, in person, with the people we love, in a year when it’s needed the most,” says The Wallis’ Artistic Director Paul Crewes, in a press release. “It is always a pleasure to collaborate with our For The Record family, and I’m grateful to be sharing this very unique experience with Los Angeles audiences once again.”\n\n“During the past holiday season, we all adapted and watched artists perform live concerts online, participated in network television sing-a-longs, and some even went to drive-in movie theaters in an effort to feel surrounded by the festive spirit,” adds For The Record Live executive producer Shane Scheel. “As we move forward each day to a world on the mend, I am thrilled to once again bring together our incredibly talented artists and deliver an evening to audiences each night [in person] that is sure to strengthen connections, make merry and celebrate love.”\n\nTicket prices for previews (November 27, 28, 30) range from $35 to $105; ticket prices for the December 1-31 performances are $39-$125. Find out more at TheWallis.org/Love, where tickets will be available as of September 1. You can also join the waitlist on FeverUp.com to get access before tickets are available to the general public."
