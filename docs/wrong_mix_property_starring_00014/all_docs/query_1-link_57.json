        "text": "Last Updated on November 28, 2022\n\n“At Christmas, you tell the truth,” one character says in Love, Actually–and the truth may be that Love Actually is actually psychotic. Or at least that’s what Hugh Grant once wondered.\n\nIn the trailer for the upcoming TV special The Laughter and Secrets of ‘Love Actually’: 20 Years Later, star Emma Thompson recalls a moment she shared with co-star Hugh Grant while filming the holiday romantic comedy. “Hugh came up behind me as we were walking out and said, ‘Is that the most psychotic thing we’ve ever been in?’”\n\nLove Actually is plenty over-the-top, cliche and cluttered, but “psychotic” might be a little excessive. It, too, has been critiqued as of late for its sexism, fat-shaming and depiction of female characters. So while “psychotic” might not be the best choice of words for Grant, one can agree that Love Actually has maybe not aged too well.\n\nThe special, which will air on ABC on November 29th, looks to be a typical fluffy Diane Sawyer piece, but since the movie has only grown in popularity over the past two years, it will surely be a must-see for fans.\n\nThose participating in the special include writer/director Richard Curtis, Thompson (the cheated on Karen), Grant (Prime Minister David), Bill Nighy (who earned a BAFTA for his performance), Laura Linney (lovelorn Sarah), and Thomas Sangster and Olivia Olson, the subjects of one of the most endearing subplots. In it, they’ll be reflecting on the movie’s themes, its enduring legacy and, yes, that embarrassing dance scene.\n\nThis is not the first time the cast of Love Actually has reunited. They previously teamed up in 2017 for Red Nose Actually, a short made for Red Nose Day, a telethon hosted by Comic Relief.\n\nIs Love Actually part of your annual holiday viewing? Let us know your favorite scene or subplot!"
