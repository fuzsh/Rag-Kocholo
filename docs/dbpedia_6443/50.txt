One way to look at the early development of films is to look at the progression of the length of films presented. However, there are many oddities and problems such as film speed. There was no set rate of frames per second so time would vary greatly depending upon the exhibitor. This is why early silent film was measured in linear measurements instead of time. To help calculate, 1000 ft would be about 15-17 minutes. Here's a chart of progression with each a commercial film that took the record for length at that time:
