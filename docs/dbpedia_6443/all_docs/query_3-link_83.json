Russell plays a senator’s daughter who asks her father to get her a commission in the Women’s Army Corps (WAC) so that she can be close to her boyfriend. The senator thinks that it’s a better idea for her become an enlisted soldier, so Russell’s character ends up in basic training. Hilarity ensues …\n\nThe Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) was formed in 1942, and the unit was converted to full status the following year to become the Women’s Army Corps (WAC).

Often a scow can be seen carrying junk or garbage.\n\n15…Capitale in which “La Dolce Vita” was filmed..ROMA\n\nIn Italian, “Roma” (Rome) is the “capitale” (capital) of “Italia” (Italy).\n\nThe title of the celebrated 1960 Federico Fellini film “La Dolce Vita” translates from Italian as “The Good Life”. There is a character in the film called Paparazzo who is a news photographer. It is this character who gives us our word “Paparazzi”, a term used for photographers who make careers out of taking candid shots of celebrities.\n\n17…Lanai hi..ALOHA\n\nThe Hawaiian word “Aloha” has many meanings in English: affection, love, peace, compassion and mercy. More recently “aloha” has come to mean “hello” and “goodbye”, but only since the mid-1800s.\n\nLanai is the sixth largest of the Hawaiian Islands. Lanai was first spotted by Europeans just a few days after Captain Cook was killed on the Big Island of Hawaii in 1779. In 1922, the Hawaiian Pineapple Company bought the whole island of Lanai and turned most of it into the world’s largest pineapple plantation. Since then, Lanai has been known as “The Pineapple Island”. Today, 98% of the island is owned by Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle, and 2% is owned by the State of Hawaii.\n\n18…Soft-spoken painter Bob..ROSS\n\nBob Ross was an artist and art instructor.

Koi have been bred for decorative purposes and there are now some very brightly colored examples found in Japanese water gardens.\n\n29…Title character in a Beatles “White Album” song..BUNGALOW BILL\n\n“The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill” is a John Lennon song that was recorded by the Beatles.

R. D. Blackmore was an English novelist, very celebrated and in demand in his day (the late 1800s). His romantic story “Lorna Doone” was by no means a personal favorite of his, and yet it is the only one of his works still in print.\n\nLorna Doone shortbread cookies were introduced by Nabisco in 1912. Presumably, they were named after the famous novel by R. D. Blackmore.\n\n42…__ Peachik: flavored vodka..STOLI\n\nStolichnaya is a brand of Russian vodka made from wheat and rye grain.

Nowadays we often refer to this arrangement as the Ionian League.\n\n27…Arm bones..ULNAE\n\nThe humerus is the long bone in the upper arm.
