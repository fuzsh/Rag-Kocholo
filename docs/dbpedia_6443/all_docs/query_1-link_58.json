        "text": "As a boy in Bishop's Waltham, Hampshire, William Atkins took possession of what he thought of as a miniature moor close to his home, spending all his dusks there, and many of his before-school dawns. It was the subject of the GCSE geography inquiry that he wrote at 14, the aim of which was to predict its future, though this seems mostly to have been a way of making a teenage virtue of his growing preoccupation with its atmosphere, an \"ill- omened\", \"sombrous\" mood he recognised in the novels he'd begun to read: The Hound of the Baskervilles, Lorna Doone, Wuthering Heights.\n\nHow thrilling the moor was, whether by foot, or on the page. \"It's not the sea, is it?\" asks Mary Lennox, the heroine of Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Secret Garden, arriving in Yorkshire from India. In her question – her words have been printed on my heart since childhood – is awe, confusion, a desire to rule things out even as she grasps that nothing can quite be ruled in: all the swirling, complicated feelings, in fact, that Atkins experienced as a boy and which, in the end, gave birth to this, his first book.\n\nAlas, the moor of his childhood turned out to be more of a fen. But those tussocky hectares had done their work. Twenty years later, having lost his job in publishing, Atkins decided to explore England's moorlands, which had always promised something that the meadows, pastures and woods had not: \"a kind of reply to the portion of myself that remained uncultivated\". He would walk out, pushing down the \"infinitesimal shying\" he could feel deep inside, \"the old, animal revulsion induced by hostile terrain\".\n\nThe Moor is his account of this journey, made in stages, and it is attentive to such things as blisters, gaiters and the sudden return of one's mobile phone signal. Also, to fog. But it's far more than a travelogue. We are, broadly speaking, in Robert Macfarlane territory here (though Atkins is less given to overwriting than Macfarlane), geology patiently giving way on the path to poetry, botany resting at a stile while social history clambers by. Walkers can be competitive, particularly those who favour moorland. But they're also convivial, and Atkins likes to talk to those he meets, and to meet those who know the land better than he, with the result that The Moor is full of conversations, too: with gamekeepers, beaters, birders, and local historians.\n\nSometimes, it's as crowded as Kinder Scout on a sunny Sunday. The reader, then, must expect occasionally to be disoriented – though perhaps this is as it should be, given how easy it is to get lost on a moor, even to disappear. Consider the story of Charlotte Dymond, with which his book opens: an 18-year-old servant at Penhale farm on Bodmin Moor, she set out on foot on the afternoon of 14 April, 1844, and was never seen again.\n\nI behaved badly, a partisan critic from the off, and read the book back to front, beginning with the second section, about the north. It hardly mattered. The moors of the south-west (Bodmin, Exmoor, Dartmoor) where Atkins begins his tour are neater, more self-contained, mere islands compared with what he calls the archipelago of the northern moors, which extend up through the Pennines to the Scottish border. I would say they're less likely to make you gasp in wonder, too. But they are all places of violence – homes to prisons, army shooting-ranges and, once, to mines – even if it is only in the north that grouse fall from the sky come August. These moors have always attracted poets, writers and religious maniacs – there being something numinous in their vastness, even if they cannot be said to be exactly peaceful (the wind and the ghosts see to that). Both, too, have their own language. The burning of moors to increase grouse numbers and improve grazing (done a section at a time, this ensures young heather for the birds to feed on, and older heather to provide cover) is known as \"swaling\" in the south-west and \"swithening\" in North Yorkshire. Some of this language is irresistibly lyrical. In Danby, North Yorkshire, when the moor steams after rain followed by hot sunshine, it is called \"summer geese\", a phrase so exquisitely apposite that once learned, I doubt it can ever be forgotten.\n\nThe Brontës are in this book, of course – Atkins is particularly interested in the fearsome day in 1824 when the bog above Haworth burst, and Patrick Brontë feared his children drowned – and Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes, who made pilgrimage to Top Withens, the farmhouse widely (though possibly wrongly) considered the inspiration for Wuthering Heights. But he has turned up many others: Mad Grimshaw, the Reverend William Grimshaw, Patrick Brontë's predecessor as priest at Haworth, who preached up to 30 times a week at the moor's scattered farmhouses; Beatrice Chase, the Dartmoor novelist who, after the first world war, built a private chapel that became the heart of a minor cult of salvation; and Henry Williamson, the author of Tarka the Otter, who looked at Dartmoor and saw the battlefields of Europe. He is excellent on WH Auden's abiding attachment to Alston Moor, and gives a radiant account of the life of Frank Elgee, an exceptionally passionate curator of the Dorman Museum in Middlesbrough who became, on the publication of his 1912 book The Moorlands of North-Eastern Yorkshire, his county's answer to Gilbert White.\n\nAll this is deftly punctuated with meteorological drama – the remains of a Lancaster bomber on Bleaklow Moor in Derbyshire that appear and disappear according to some current beneath the peat; the snow lying so deep on Alston Moor in 1916 that to walk on it meant finding your head level with telephone wires – and with Atkins's self-deprecating wit. Whenever things are in danger of getting too sombre, too serious, he will ponder his lunch. On one occasion, this is a bag of BBQ Mini Cheddars and a strawberry Ribena. On another, he takes from his rucksack some raisins, a marshmallow, a date, a fruit pastille and an orange with five small holes in it – the remains of the Christingle he was given at a service at the Methodist chapel in Oxenhope, in the parish of Haworth. His writing is clear and deeply felt, descriptive – the ridge of Kilmar Tor on Bodmin looks like a \"moor-diseased pelt\"; the flowering of the heather changes the face of the moor \"not by brushstrokes, but by stippling\" – without ever becoming too flowery.\n\nA few negatives. Now and then, you feel Atkins struggling to find the right structure for his material, and en route there are some less interesting patches (the reader must get his or her head down, and push on, hoping the brow of the hill will come soon). It is a huge failure of Atkins's publisher not to have added maps to the text; I often struggled to grasp where exactly he was, even when he was writing about places I know well. Why doesn't each chapter begin with a Wainwright-style sketch? But, in context, these are small things.\n\nThis is a wonderful, teeming book, and those stoutly poetic souls who favour moorland over lush valleys, rolling dales and even snow-capped fells – \"It's not the sea, is it?\" – will cherish it, and consider it quite the classic."
