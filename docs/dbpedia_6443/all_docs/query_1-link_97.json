        "text": "Who was the Mystery Chef?\n\nJohn MacPherson [1876-1955] was a gregarious wealthy Scottish bon vivant sent to America by his father at age 30 to learn the value of money. Instead? He taught himself how to cook. And then he parlayed that knowledge into a media empire. MacPherson says he cloaked his identity out of respect for his mother, who was embarrased about having a son who \"cooked.\" We never discover what his father thought about MacPherson's career.\n\nWhere did he come from?\n\n\"Perhaps I should start this book by answering a question that so many have asked: 'How did I, a man, ever come to take up cooking as a hobby? ' Well, the answer is--I didn't take up cooking as a hobby. Some would say I drifted into it by accident, through I myself don't believe such things happen by accident. I am a Scot, and therefore I see design in all things. I came to America in 1906 from London where I owned a prosperous, rapidly growing advertising business. I came here looking for American business, and later decided to stay and learn American methods. I left my London business in the hands of my father, who was a director in various large companies, and a fine old gentleman of the Schotch school. He always said that he wished i couldn't make money so easily, because I spent money much too freely; in fact, he said that I spent more money in a month than he had spent at my age in a year. My father decided that my visit to America was his chance to teach me the real value of money, and so, instead of sending me the L100 remittance that I had arranged for his to send, he sent me L2, and wrote saying he would send me L2 a week, and that ought to be plenty for a youngster of my age. In vain I expostulated with him, pointing out that street car concudtors in New York City got more than twice as much as he expected me to live on. But he would not weaken. This all led to a quick change in my method of living; instead of throwing away money on extravagant parties, I gave up my rooms in the hotel, and having looked around, found rooms in a boarding house. The house was fine, but words fail me when I try to tell you how bad the meals were.\" (p. v)\n\nWhat was his culinary training & cooking philosophy?\n\n\"In that boarding house I joined forces with a man who, like myself, had been used to the best of everything in life. After talking it over, we left the boarding house; took a furnished apartment and started to cook some of our own meals. At first we broiled chops and steaks, and then I roasted a piece of beef. it was good. I roasted a chickn cooking vegetables as well as potatoes, and we began to feel that we were getting somewhere, so we invited our first guests to dinner. They seemed to think we were quite marvelous. By this time I got a real thrill out of cooking, and I began to branch out and cook new things...Married, now, for over twenty-five years, I have cooked practically every meal, every day....Once you treat cooking as an art, it will quickly prove itselff to be one of the most fascinating of all arts. To me it is not strange that I should find pleasusre in cooking. What does seem strange to me is that so few people do find pleaures in it or know that many of the world's greatest men have found pleasure and relaxation in the art of excellent cookign. Thye are surporsed to hear that Alexandre Dumas was a wonderful cook, and that the last book he wote was a cook book.: (p. v-vi) \"When you sit down at your dinner table tonight, think for a moment of how many people were employed in the growoing and preparation of the ingredients you used in cooking that dinner. When I say ten thousand men and women help us to prepare each meal, I believe the estimate is conservative; and I think you will agree with me when we have traced through the people involved in the production of just one ingredient form its source to your table.\" (p.x) .\n\nWhy the mystery?\n\n\"Perhaps I should ansewer the qusetion that I am sure many would ask: why do I call myself The Myster Chef? The reason was a good one at the time I decided to use it. My dear mohter, who was alive at the time, was horrified when she first heard that I had taken to cooking as a hobby. My mother became reconciled to the fast that I had become an expert in the art of cooking, but she always thought that I should keep it under my hat. She had trained each of my sisters to have a complete knowledge of household management...To my mother it as only right and propler that each of her daughters should know all about household management and cooking, but for a son to be taking an interest in the kidtch--well, that was different! Now one could hardly call broadcasting about cooking 'keeping my hobby under my hat,' so that in deference to myh mother's wishes, i decided touse the namme of the Mystery Chef. now that my mother has passed on, and I have become known to millions as The Mystery Chef, it is better that I keep that name, because after all, as I have so often said in my radio talks, 'Who I am doesn't matter. it is what I have to say that counts.' And I say, 'Always be an artist at the stove, not just somebody who cooks.'\" ---The Mystery Chef's Own Cook BookJohn MacPherson, [Blakiston Company reprint 1934 edition, by special arrangment with Longmans, Green & Co.:New York] 1945 (introduction)\n\nThe cook books\n\n\"For the last four or five years the 'Mystery Chef' has been broadcasting his knowledge of cooking, and his ardent conviction that cooking should always be practiced as a fine art, with such success that his radio fans have begged him to preeserve for them in book form the wisdom to which they have been listening. This volume is the result. But he still keeps his incognito, although in the intorduction he explains how he came to take up cooking as a hobby and why he has kept up his interest in it for almost thirty years. A chapter devoted to fundamntal informaiton about cooking will, the auther declares, enable any one who profits by it to become a good cook, because it contains all the basic instruction needed. Any one, he insists who can successfully cook these dishes and follow there instructions can use any recipe, turn any formula into a tasty dish. There are recipes, 275 pages of them, including famous dishes of a dozen nations, for a large assortment of delectable things to eat, for every meal in the day and every course in the meal, and there are chapters on preparing dinners for dinner parties and offering what he calls 'coordinated recipes fore entire dinners.' The book ends with twenty-odd pages of 'cooking tips.' It is notable among cook books for the simplicty and clarity of its directions.\"\n\n---\"An Unusual Cook Book, The Mystery Chef's Own Cook Book, 366. pp. New York:Longmans, Green & Co., $3.\" New York Times Book Review, December 9, 1934 (p. 26)\n\n[NOTE: Food Timeline library owns copies of The Mystery Chef's Own Cook Book [1934, 1945] and Be an artist at the gas range: Susscesful recipes by the Mystery Chef [1936]. Happy to share recipes. Mystery Chef Chicken, anyone?]\n\n\"One day several years ago a man obliged a friend by taking his place on a radio program. This man had been trained as a chemical engineer but his lifelong hobby had been cooking. So he talked about cooking from his own unique, common-sense point of iew. It as a new point of view that took the mystery and the trouble out of cooking and put simplicity and pleasure into it. Several thousand letters came in to the radio station asking for more. A great food company asked this man to undertake a regular talk on cooking. He consented and The Mystery Chef was born to the air. He became one of the ranking stars of the radio world and he and his sponsors were swamped with demands for a complete cook book containing his famous eays recipes for delicious meals. The Mystery Chef's Own Cook Book was written and published. tens of thousands of women--and men--expert cooks, even those who couldn't boil water, practical cooks willing to be shown easier, more economical ways, brought it; and now the publishers and The Mystery Chef have cooperated to cut its cost in half so that tens of thousands more may enjoy the pleasure and profit in cooking The Mystery Chef's way. The new Mystery Chef's Own Cook Book is the same, original, large, 366-page book with new recipes and a new jacket. There are its uniuqe features: It is really explicit; anyone who can read can carry out its directions and make delciious dishes. The Mystery Chef does not assume that you know anything about cooking or cooking terms: when he tells you to 'fold in an egg' he explains just what one does. And yet the recipes are so arranged that the experienced cook can see their essentials at a glance without bothering with all the detailed directions. All the ordinary cooking problems are reduced to a chapted on 'Basic Cooking.' When you have mastered this, you can cook the usual foods and prepare delciious meals. It gives a large groups of 'Coordinated Recipes'--entire dinners, with full and explicit directions for every move in preparation, and a time schedule, so that the most inexpereinced can bring the meal off successfully with each dish done on time. This coordinated timing of meals is one of the most important features ever put in a cook book. There is an entire section of 'Famous national Dishes; which are authentic but interpreted in understandable terms with available ingredients. There is a large section of the most exciting and revolutionary cooking tips. And besides all that there is a complete range of carefully tested recipes covering everything from soup to nuts.\"\n\n---The Mystery Chef's Own Cook Book [The Blakiston Company:Philadelphia PA] 1945 (dust jacket text, front & back)\n\nRadio star\n\n\"The Mystery Chef...Broadcast History: 1930, local Boston radio.

The Mystery Cehe was John MacPherson, a Scot who broadcast anonymousl because his mother was ashamed of having a son dispense recipes on the air. 'Who I am doesn't matter,' he would frequently remind us; 'it's what I have to say that counts.' He had been cooking for more than 25 years, since his arrival in America and his tenancy in a boardinghouse where the food was so bad that he was forced to cook his own. The 10,000 recipes he had collected ran from rare to common, from frugal to rich, and contained 200 special menus of the world's great men (Burbank, Edward VII, Steinmetz, etc.). He progresses from local radio to sydication to the networks. His earliest network sponsor was the Davis Baking Company. The most important ingredient of any recipe, he said, was love: 'You must go into the kitchen with love in your heart for what you are about to do, and for the people who will eat your cooking.'\"\n\n---On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, John Dunning [Oxford Unviersity Press:New York] 1998 (p,. 476)\n\n\"That cooking is becoming increasingly a fad with men is revealed in the interest housewives are showing in the radio program of 'The Mystery Chef.'

Barnes & Co.:South Brunshwick NJ] 1979, 2nd edition revised, volume 2 (p. 693)\n\nHow successul was the Mystery Chef?\n\n\"He's a gray-haired Scotsamn with a British accent, a former advertising executve and a favorite of 7,000,000 housewives, but hardly anybody knows his name. When he started broadcasting twelve years ago he called himself The Mystery Chef (he still does), and he appealed to the depression audience because he taught them how to save money on meals. Last week he came back, after more than a year of silence, with a new program five afternoons a week at 2:15 EWT over the Blue network and a bigger audience than ever. In his first full network series, he'll concentrate on beating today's soaring food prices, with special emphasis on meat rationing. I'll gie you easy recipes for delicious meals,' he reassured the worried homemakers, 'and I'll guarantee that you will not use 1 1/2 pounds of meat per person per week. If we should have to get down to 1 pound a week that would not present any problem to me.' His first broadcast, for instance, included a recipe for a meat dish, which would serve six people for less than 41--a caserole, made of layers of chopped beef, fried eggplant, and tomatoes, and served with mashed potatoes. He's not just talking either. He cooked a full three-course dinner in his New York penthouse a few days ago for six hungry food-company executives. it included soup, meat, two vegetables, potatoes, hot biscuits with butter, and dessert--and cost only 21.1 cents per person. Nobody knows the Mystery Chef's name except himself, his wife, the Blue network--and Newsweek, which has promised not to give him away. He's not just trying to be spooky. The secret began in 1906, when he wrote from New York to his blueblooded family in London and told them he was living in a furnished room and cooking his own meals. That was after his father had cut off his money supply because 'I spent more money in a month than he sepnt in a year.' The family was horrified and asked him not to let anyone know, so he never has. That's his story, anyway, through it's been pointed out that the title makes good publicity--and that he was an advertising man for 25 mears before he started cooking with gas. Outside the broadcast the Mystery Chef spends his time writing a religious book called 'God Answers'...collecting Scottish jobks and entertaiing celebrities: he dishes up the joks along with the dinner He has been married 34 yars, and his red-haired wif hasn't cooked a meal yet.\"\n\n---\"Whosis the Chef,\" Newsweek, December 21, 1942 (p. 79)\n\nEpilogue\n\nWe don't know exactly when or why the Mystery Chef's identity was revealed. The 1945 edition of the Mystery Chef's Own Cook Book lists John MacPherson on the copyright page but not as the author. Most folks (except librarians) don't look at publisher fine print. That was four short years before the television show debuted. Neither do we know the name of his first apartment roomate, his red-haired wife, or why his 1949 TV show lasted only one season. Most fascinating? How reporters through time endeavored to convey MacPherson's credentials (advertising executive, chemical engineer) without questioning his culinary training. A TRUE Mystery Chef, indeed."
