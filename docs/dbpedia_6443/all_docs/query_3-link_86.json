        "text": "While looking through my meager \"collection\" of old books, I came across \"Lorna Doone - A Romance of Exmoor\", by R.D. Blackmore. It is an 1889 edition, and I have never read it. I liked it because of the artwork on the cover. I learned today, from my Wife, that she has read it, and plans to read it again.\n\nHas anyone read it? Would a guy enjoy reading this? ...just asking.\n\nThanks, Tom, I have heard of the Australian Bushranger. I will be reading it, for sure.\n\n\"By his own account, Blackmore relied on a \"phonologic\" style for his characters' speech, emphasising their accents and word formation.[4] He expended great effort, in all of his novels, on his characters' dialogues and dialects, striving to recount realistically not only the ways, but also the tones and accents, in which thoughts and utterances were formed by the various sorts of people who lived in the Exmoor district in the 17th century\".\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorna_Doone\n\n...and then of course, there came the cookie! Originating, in Pittsburgh, PA, no less!\n\n\"Christine McIntyre is Lorna Doone in Scotched In Scotland. Nabisco makes the Lorna Doone Cookie. Nabisco says: \"No record exists for the exact motivation behind the selection of that name, but in those days shortbread biscuits were considered a product of Scottish heritage, and the Lorna Doone character was symbolic of Scotland.\" Maybe the short was the inspiration for the cookie\"!\n\n\"Lorna Doone is a golden, square-shaped shortbread cookie produced by Nabisco. Introduced in March 1912, it was possibly named after the main character in R. D. Blackmore's 1869 novel, Lorna Doone, but no record exists as to the exact motivation behind the name.\n\nAccording to the Howat family legend, the original cookie recipe was given to Nabisco by employee Joe Howat from Pittsburgh, PA. The shortbread recipe was from his mother, Marion Rankin Howat, who was born in Scotland.\n\nThe ingredients in the current version of this cookie include enriched flour, soybean and/or palm oil, sugar, partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil, corn flour, salt, high fructose corn syrup, baking soda, corn starch, soy lecithin, and artificial flavors.\n\nLorna Doone cookies are featured in the poem, \"Lorna Doone Last Cookie Song (I Shared it with Gloria)\", found in the book Egg Thoughts and Other Frances Songs, by Russell Hoban\".https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorna_Doone_(cookie)\n\nLORNA DOONE LAST COOKIE SONG (I SHARED IT WITH GLORIA), by Russell Hoben\n\nAll the sandwich cookies sweet\n\nIn their frilly paper neat,\n\nThey are gone this afternoon,\n\nThey have left you, Lorna Doone.\n\nLorna Doone, Lorna Doone,\n\nRoaming through the heather,\n\nLorna Doone, Lorna Doone,\n\nWe’ll grow old together.\n\nChocolate and vanilla creams\n\nPass like little tasty dreams\n\nEaten up and gone too soon,\n\nAll but you, our Lorna Doone.\n\nYou are plain and you are square\n\nAnd your flavor’s only fair.\n\nSoon there’ll be an empty place\n\nWhere we saw your smiling face.\n\nLorna Doone, Lorna Doone,\n\nYou were last but you weren’t wasted.\n\nLorna Doone, Lorna Doone,\n\nWe’ll remember how you tasted.\n\nIn honor of the author, who was laid to rest January 4th, 2012.\n\nOne source suggested the Author, named her after a place. Lorne (or Lorn; Scottish Gaelic: Latharn) is an ancient district in the west of Scotland, now part of the Argyll and Bute council area.\n\nThere is also the Lorne sausage, a type of square sausage that is popular in Scotland. My dictionary tells me that this is probably named after Tommy Lorne, who was a Scottish comedian in the 1920s, long after Lorna Doone was written. Lorne, however, was not his real name, so he may have taken it from the place in Argyll.\n\nAlthough it was an option in high school, I chose Catcher in the Rye for my mandatory reading.\n\nI have never really had even a small penchant for fiction but have much honor for the great authors of it. If given the choice, and because of their notoriety regarding writing style, Blackmoore, Dickens, Steinbeck, Poe and Longfellow could easily be within my grasp of what most call \"good reading.\"\n\nStrange. I seriously read only non-fiction but enjoy a fictional movie. Maybe I can find Lorna Doone on youtube."
