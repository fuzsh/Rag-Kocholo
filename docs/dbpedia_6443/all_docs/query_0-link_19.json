The film has English intertitles and Russian? Subtitles.\n\nPlot: It is 1830 in Paris and the rent is due, but the money is not there. An article here, a painting there and a monkey with a cup gives them enough money for the rent, but not for food. Fortunately, Musette from downstairs has enough food for everyone including Mimi - the poor little waif from next door who Rodolphe has met. But Count Paul also has his lusting eye on Mimi and uses her embroidery to get close to her. Rodolphe and Mimi fall in love and Mimi works endlessly to support Rodolphe who is writing his play with a new found passion. He does not know that he has been discharged from writing for 'Dog and Cat Fanciers'. Mimi wants to get his play produced and Count Paul offers to help, but there is a terrible fight when Rodolphe thinks that Mimi is faithless to him with Count Paul. After the fight, he seeks out a doctor as she is sick, but she has left when Rodolphe returns and will stay away until his play is finished.\n\nReview: For those who love silent films, this film needs no introduction. For those who know nothing about them and would like to begin your Silent Classics 101 class or better yet your Lillian Gish 101 class, begin with this. Lillian Gish was a silent screen star who also was a very successful movie star in talking pictures. But her main contributions to film history are her silent pictures. She was also in The Wind, The Scarlet Letter, Broken Blossoms, Orphans of the Storm, and in director D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation, Intolerance, and Way Down East. All of them are essential to a Lillian Gish 101 class.\n\nBut begin with La Boheme. It centers around tenants in an apartment building, who are barely scraping by: John Gilbert who is a writer of stories and plays, or at least hopes to be, and Lillian Gish who sews to make money. They can barely make enough to pay for the rent. Gilbert at least has friends with whom he is \"poor but happy\" with. But Lillian is alone and looks as petite as actresses come. Their lives cross when he takes her in and feeds her out of pity and from thereon he falls in love with her. Miss Gish's dark expressive eyes and fine distinctive features only heighten her performance. She is heartbroken, when she has to give her clothes away and gets very little for them. And throughout the film, she does all she can to help the man she loves.\n\nAnd the last 15 minutes is unforgettable as she is at death's door, but makes her way through the village, back to John Gilbert, hanging onto the back of trucks and literally dragging herself across the street. If you haven't had a good cry lately, I recommend this and defy anyone to not break down watching this. If you don't, then something is seriously wrong with you. What's amazing also is that Miss Gish was already petite, but she lost even more weight just for her final scenes to be believable. That is not makeup. The crew watching and even John Gilbert thought she was actually dying. But, Miss Gish was that way; she would do all for the sake of her work, as the true artist she was. This is in my opinion her tour de force, and that's saying a lot, as she was always outstanding in everything she ever did.\n\nNone of her other films really capture the intensity and sensitivity of her talents as La Boheme does, with the exception of The Wind. Discover Miss Lillian Gish and La Boheme and you may never want to go back to talking picturesâ¦.£7.49\n\nLabios Sem Beijos (1930)\n\nDirected by Humberto Mauro and starring Lelita Rosa, Paolo Morano, Didi Viana and Gina Cavalieri, this film has a runtime of 71 mins and the print quality is good to very good. This Brazilian silent has Portugese only intertitles.\n\nPlot: Lelita is a wealthy and rebel young woman, who meets the stranger Paulo Morano in a cab, and after an initial resistance, she falls in love with him. Meanwhile, her younger sister Didi tells her that she has an infatuation with a man called Paulo. Lelita believes that Paulo is cheating her with her sister and she breaks with him. Later, she realizes that her sister is dating indeed a homonymous and she committed a mistake with her boyfriend.\n\nReview: This movie is worth seeing if only to witness a Rio de Janeiro that truly does not exist anymore. It was already a big city then, but it does not look that way for us today, and the beaches are all changed, too. For us it might be a light romantic comedy of some 70 years in the past. It is certainly a joy, and quite funny at times, and easy to watch. But, in 1930, this movie was considered not suitable for the ladies in Brazil. I guess I can understand.\n\nThe authorities probably figured that, upon seeing these rich girls that seem to be doing nothing but flirt and go to dancing parties all day long, women in Brazil would flock to Rio de Janeiro to let it loose! In the end, it is your regular love story, but it does seem to condone sex before marriage, as long as it is just a couple of days before the proposal!..£7.49\n\nLaborâs Reward (1925)\n\nDirected by John J.Manning this film has a runtime of 65 mins and the print quality is very good to excellent.\n\nPlot: A motherless family is thrown into crisis when the father is injured at work. With no workers' compensation to fall back on, the eldest daughter, Mary, has to work long hours for low wages until she collapses. As a result, her coworkers band together to unionize.â¦..£7.49\n\nLabyrinth of Horror(1921) **UPGRADE â Improved print**\n\nDirected by Michael Curtiz and starring Lucy Doraine, Alphons Fryland, Max Devrient and Paul Askonas, this film has a runtime of 91 mins and the print quality is very good to excellent. This is an Austrian silent with French intertitles and hardcoded English subtitles.\n\nPlot: Edward Stephenson, the son of a great industrialist, is due to marry the daughter of another prominent business leader. But the boy prefers a modest employee of the latter, Maud Hartley, whose brother is an impossible rascal, murderer of a police officer. Maud is spurned by Edward who wrongly assumes she is unfaithful. Later, the girl is victim of a railway accident and then throws herself headlong into the easy life. Will the couple reunite again, for better or worse?\n\nReview: Alphons Fryland is the son of an industrialist. He is supposed to marry the daughter of another factory owner, when he encounters Lucy Doraine, working at his fiancee's home as a maid. She is forced to quit, and eventually goes at Fryland's factory as his secretary. Her brother, Jean Ducret, steals her keys and robs the factory's safe. She is fired, but to avoid scandal, is let go. Hard luck follows her, and she becomes a debauchee.\n\nIt's 6,000 feet of hard luck for Miss Doraine, which Michael Curtiz's movie insists i a matter of fate. At times I found the piling up of bad breaks to be wearisome, and then Curtiz and his director of photography, Gustav Ucicky, would offer an interesting shot: Miss Doraine lying in a hospital bed, hallucinating of drown in a shower of flowers, or a stuntman climbing a tall factory smokestack. There were also some great crowd scenes; by this stage in his career, Curtiz had the ability to direct scenes of mass chaos. It's a talent he would use many times in the coming years.â¦..£7.49\n\nLadies of Leisure (1926)\n\nDirected by Tom Buckingham and starring Elaine Hammerstein, T.Roy Barnes, Robert Ellis and Gertrude Short, this film has a runtime of 58 mins and the print quality is good.\n\nPlot: Rich, spoiled Marian pressures Eric to marry her.Her brother is in love with her friend Mamie, but a scheming ex husband tries to blackmail her. Mamie is saved from suicide by Eric, who's in a compromising position when he brings her home.\n\nReview: Elaine Hammerstein and Gertrude Short play the ladies in two meandering story lines here. Hammerstein plays Mamie, a paid companion to Short in a wealthy household where she is being romanced by the handsome son (Robert Ellis). He presses for marriage but she has a dark secret. She finally accepts a ring from him as a friendship ring but goes into hiding when her \"husband\" (Jim Mason) appears on the scene. It seems she was tricked into marrying him after her father was framed in a jewel robbery. He expects her to help rob the house so she escapes.\n\nShort plays Marian, a perky little pest who's after a \"confirmed bachelor\" (T. Roy Barnes) who does everything he can to avoid her. But no matter how he and his butler (Tom Ricketts) lie to her, she always manages to sneak into his apartment. By today's standards,she a stalker.\n\nThe two stories come together when Hammerstein decides a jump off the Brooklyn Bridge is the only way out, but who should be driving by but Barnes. He talks her out of jumping and taker her home. About the same time, a detective has traced Hammerstein to Barnes' apartment, which sends Ellis into a fury since Barnes is his best friend.\n\nEllis shows up and threatens Barnes if Hammerstein (dressed in a dry robe) is in the apartment. But Short sneaks in again and bursts into the room (in a robe) and declares she is married to Barnes. Ellis backs off and Short tells him Hammerstein is back at the house waiting for him.\n\nEllis races home but what will he find? Barnes has been trapped into marrying the pesty Short. Will they find wedded bliss?â¦..£7.49\n\nLads of the Village, The (1919)\n\nDirected by Harry Lorraine and starring Bernard Dudley, Maudie Dunham and Jimmy Learmonth, this British silent film has a runtime of 76 mins and the print quality is very good.\n\nReview: Everyone in the village has turned out, for Jimmy Learmouth and his pal Joe Peterman have been demobbed, and Jimmy has won the V.C. He has no interest in hanging around and making a speech, so his captain, H.J. Lord tells the tale, involving the captain's girl, two German spies, dispatches, and Learmouth dressing up as a Turkish magician.\n\nIt's based on a stage play co-produced by Peterman and starring, one can only presume, him and Learmouth, in a long, rambling tale about how the British officer was saved by the dumb luck of having plucky English commoners to to help out their stalwart, incompetent superiors. It's been nicely opened up -- not only in the bookends, shot outdoors, but in the battle scenes, which are nicely done. I don't doubt the sequences set in the Turkish Pasha's court, with his underdressed harem was in the original stage show, but it was undoubtedly a time when everyone was saying it was good for moraleâ¦.£7.49.\n\nLady, The (1925)\n\nStarring Norma Talmadge. Runtime: 65 minsâ¦..£7.49\n\nLady and the Beard, The (1931)\n\nDirected by Yasujiro Ozu, the film has a runtime of 75 mins and has a logo throughout. The print quality is goodâ¦..£7.49\n\nLady Hamilton (1921) **UPGRADE â Now with English subtitles**\n\nDirected by Richard Oswald and starring Liane Haid, Conrad Veidt, Werner Krauss and Reinhold SchÃ¼nzel this film has a runtime of 80 mins and the print quality is very good.The film is timecoded throughout and has Russian intertitles with English subtitles.\n\nPlot: The dramatic story of Lady Hamilton's rise and fall in European society during the 1700s and early 1800s, including the romantic love story with Lord Nelson.\n\nReview: For many years, âLady Hamiltonâ was considered a lost film â and it still is, officially. But, unofficially there is an excellent copy from the Russian film archive. The version is not complete, but it looks incredibly well, considering the age. Conradâs Major Nelson is amazing. Liane Haid is also very good as his lover, Lady Hamilton. In comparison to the 1941-version with Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier, which was focused on the couple, the 1921-version is even better, because it reflects also the political situation and the difficult years of war against Napoleon. The end of the scene from the silent film was a source of inspiration to the sound version, but not even Olivier could surpass Conradâs brilliant acting all the way. He is very convincing and obviously dedicated to the cause for which his character fights until his death. There are also some romantic and even delirious moments in which especially Connie is very good, and his acting here, like in all of his films, is the best from the entire cast, even if Werner Krauss is also effective as Lord Hamilton. This film is a gem of the German silent cinema, and it deserves complete restoration in order to be available not just for collectors like me, but also for all the fans of Conrad Veidt around the world. â¦..£7.49\n\nLady in the Library, The (1917)\n\nStarring Jack Vosburgh and Vola Vale. Runtime: 45 minsâ¦..£7.49\n\nLady of Chance, A (1928)\n\nStarring Norma Shearer, Lowell Sherman, Johnny Mack Brown and Eugenie Besserer. Plot: Dolly, alias \"Angel Face,\" meets a naive young man at a hotel who appears to be rich. Thinking she's found an easy mark, she marries him, only to find out that the plantation he was bragging about belongs to a neighbor, and his fortune is more speculative than real. In spite of herself, she falls in love with him. Review: Story of female con artist who falls for her scam victim is just a backdrop for Shearer, who photographs beautifully and shows a remarkable range without uttering a word (check out the \"wedding veil\" scene, where she moves from mocking the idea of marriage to momentarily embracing the idea, all within a few seconds of subtly-evolving facial gestures). Entertaining, even if plot takes a couple of slightly unbelievable twists, with nice balance of comedy and drama (again, Shearer's range of emotion in the last scenes of the film are impressive and engaging). Clearly shows why Norma Shearer was a major MGM star even before the advent of soundâ¦..£7.49\n\nLady of the Camelias, The (1915)\n\nStarring Francesco Bertini. Good print. Runtime 53 minsâ¦..£7.49\n\nLady of the Dugout (1918)\n\nDirected by W.S.Van Dyke and starring Al Jennings, Frank Jennings, Corinne Grant and Carl Stockdale, this film has a runtime of 64 mins and the print quality is very good.\n\nReview: Pardoned criminals Al and Frank Jennings sit down with a couple men who want to know about their past. The men are fans of their stories in The Saturday Evening Post and want to know if there are any stories that haven't been published. Al then goes about telling of them robbing a bank and then running into a poor woman and her child who were abandoned by her husband. THE LADY OF THE DUGOUT is a pretty silly little story because the Jennings' try to make themselves look like good guys, which they certainly were not. One really has to get over that and just sit back and try to enjoy the picture. I will say that technically speaking this here is one of the best Westerns I've seen from this era. Director W.S. Van Dyke does a really good job at keeping the action going at a great pace and he also manages to make the film look very professional. I think the biggest problem with the movie is that the title cards seem to preach way too much and I also think they say way too much. Quite often they'll tell us something like \"the kid is sleeping\" and then we'll get a shot of him sleeping. It will read \"they were mad\" and then we see a scene of them mad. There really wasn't any need for the cards and other times scenes just dragged on including one flashback where we see the woman's early days. Still, the film contains some great action scenes that make it worth viewing and there's no question that there's something interesting hearing this made up story from two outlawsâ¦.£7.49\n\nLady of the Lake, The (1928)\n\nA real rarity (or is that oddity?). IMDB shows the year as 1930 so possibly held back by the production company Fitzpatrick Pictures. Starring Percy Marmont and Benita Humeâ¦..£7.49\n\nLady of the Night (1925)\n\nDirected by Monta Bell and starring Norma Shearer, Malcolm McGregor, Dale Fuller, George K.Arthur and Fred Esmelton, this film has a runtime of 61 mins and the print quality is excellent. In addition Joan Crawford appears uncredited as a body double for Norma Shearer in some scenes.\n\nPlot: Lady of the Night ~ the story of two baby girls, born near in proximity, but worlds apart in life, - Molly Helmer, the daughter of a thief, and Florence Banning the daughter of the judge who would send Molly's father to prison. The girls' lives come together as young women at eighteen as Florence leaves the security of the exclusive Girls Select School, and Molly, now orphaned, begins her life free from reform school. Norma Shearer plays both young women, but the apparent differences in their worldliness will also make them most unfamiliar in appearance. Molly's new world consists of nights at Kelly's Dance Hall and her ever-present worshiper, Chunky Dunn. On one of her nightly dance hall outing's Molly meets David Page, an up and coming inventor, whom she quickly falls in love with. Molly persuades David to seek an honest buyer for his new safe-cracking device; against the advice of Chunky whose shadier side see's this as an opportunity for himself, and to corrupt David in the process. Following Molly's advice, David meets with a group of investors, including the now retired Judge Banning, father of Florence. While at the Judges' home, David meets Florence and is instantly engaged by her charm and innocence, a characteristic not so present in Molly, although she tries hard to become such. We then begin to watch the personal struggles of two young women, both in love with David, yet both willing to give him up; Florence thinking the other has a stronger claim and Molly believing she is not good enough. Through strong direction and subtle acting intermixed with false bravado, we see Molly mature into one who sacrifices all for the sake of others, and become the person she so often imitated. -- Very sentimental - Excellent movie for the person who believes there is no good silent film.\n\nReview: Norma Shearer is terrific playing a dual role in this well-done silent film about two women - Molly, the daughter of a convict and Florence, the daughter of the judge who sentenced him. Molly of the heavily painted face, huge feather hat, and big beaded necklace, lives in a flat on the wrong side of the tracks and goes out with a little local named Chunky. But while out at the nearby dance hall she meets a handsome, crooked grinned lug named Dave Page, who she instantly falls in love with. Dave has invented, of all things, a device that can open any safe in the world - encouraged by Molly to \"not go crooked\", he sells the invention to the judge and a group of bank directors, and soon literally bumps into Florence - and into a love of his own! Poor, poor Molly. Norma Shearer is so good in this, the characters of Molly and Florence completely seem like two different women, and excellent split screen photography is used here when they are both on screen at the same time. I thought there would be something in this about the fact that the two are lookalikes, perhaps switching places or something - never happens. The fact they look alike is just not part of the plot here. The lighting is done in an interesting way in this - Norma as Florence seems to be shot in more filtered, subtle lighting and she looks very lovely - Norma as Molly is severely lit to make her look more sharp and, boy oh boy, does the thick makeup she wears as this character look really harsh - she looks almost like a prostitute hereâ¦..£7.49\n\nLady of the Pavements (1929)\n\nDirected by DW Griffith and starring Lupe Velez and Jetta Goudal. Very good print. Silent film with some sound sequences. Runtime: 86 minsâ¦..£7.49\n\nLady Windermereâs Fan (1925)\n\nStarring Ronald Colman and directed by Ernst Lubitsch.\n\nPlot: Mrs Erlynne, the mother of Lady Windermere - her daughter does not know about her - wants to be introduced in society, so that she can marry Lord Augustus Lorton. Lord Windermere, who helped her with a cheque, invites her to his wifes birthday-party, but Lady Windermere thinks, she has reason to be jealous, so she decides to leave her husband and go to Lord Darlington, who is pining for her. Mrs Erlynne finds this out and tries to prevent her of this mistake, but her daughter leaves her fan in Lord Darlingtonâs residence.\n\nReview: At first it might not seem as if the combination of Ernst Lubitsch and Oscar Wilde would work very well, but this silent-screen adaptation of Wilde's \"Lady Windermere's Fan\" is both enjoyable and well-crafted. Instead of clashing, Lubitsch's stylish, mischievous approach and Wilde's perceptive cynicism complement each other. The characters and the story are Wilde's, the acting and the style are Lubitsch's. Although the material is heavily re-worked from the original play, Lubitsch's decisions all seem to work pretty well. Wilde's witty and resourceful dialogue is gone, but his insightful portrayals of human nature remain. Lubitsch also makes good use of the camera to bring off some shots that could not have worked on the stage. In particular, at times he makes the fateful fan seem almost a full-fledged part of the cast. This movie version features solid performances by May McAvoy and Bert Lytell as the Windermeres, with a youngish-looking Ronald Colman suitably ingratiating as Lord Darlington. But Irene Rich has the most interesting character, and as Mrs. Erlynne she also gives a fine performance that particularly stands out in her scenes with the other characters. She and Lubitsch both capture the nature of her unpopular but admirable character, while carefully setting up the contrasts and conflicts between her and the other characters, who are in general more socially acceptable but far less worthy. This also works well simply as an entertaining, often very amusing, and sometimes dramatically compelling story. For most silent film fans, it would definitely be worth tracking down and watchingâ¦..£7.49\n\nLaila (1929)\n\nStarring Mona Martenson. Runtime: 145 minsâ¦..£7.49\n\nLamb, The (1915)\n\nStarring Douglas Fairbanks. Review: Excellent movie! The movie is, overall, very enjoyable, as it contains much of the light humor and 1915 charm Douglas Fairbanks worked so well in his first feature film. The plot, of the rich coward (Fairbanks) who goes to great lengths to be more manly to please his fiance (Seena Owens), seems old and worn out, but this movie carries it off wonderfully well. However, the portrayal of the Indians in this movie is questionable as it is not quite politically correctâ¦..£7.49\n\nLand In Captivity aka Zemlya v Plenu (1928)\n\nDirected by Fyodor Otsep and starring Anna Sten, the film has a runtime of 69 mins and has English and Russian intertitles.

I has a logo throughout and German only intertitles.\n\nAlthough the majority of voters in the 1921 referendum voted in favor of Upper Silesia remaining in Germany, the industrialized eastern part of the province was given to Poland by the Allies. In order to remind broad sections of the population of this fate, the elaborate cultural and propaganda film LAND UNDER THE KREUZ was made in 1927 on the initiative of the authorities. It describes the historical development of Upper Silesia, the serious consequences of the Versailles Treaty and the referendum for the German population as a drama of loss of homeland and expulsion, hardship, illness and inner turmoil. After LAND UNTERM KREUZ was initially banned, it premiered in Gleiwitz in Upper Silesia on the âVoting Remembrance Dayâ in 1927 and led to massive upsets in German-Polish relationsâ¦.£7.49\n\nLash of the Law, The (1925)\n\nStarring Bill Bailey. Runtime: 47 minsâ¦..£7.49\n\nLash of the Whip (1926)\n\nDirected by Francis Ford and starring Ashton Dearholt, Harry Dunkinson, Florence Gilbert, Francis Ford and Frank Baker, this film has a runtime of 45 mins and the print quality is very good to excellent.\n\nPlot: \"Hurricane\" Smith ( Francis Ford ), head of a steamship company, plots to keep the railroad from entering the city. The map of the proposed route becomes the instrument by which Blake ( Frank Baker ) and Florence ( Florence Gilbert ) are harassed by Smith's gang and repeatedly are rescued by \"Pinto Pete,\" ( Ashton Dearholt ) who is adept with a whip.\n\nReview: There's a prosperous, modern capitol city that the rail road wants to run a spur to. To do that, they must find a way through Ghost Valley, but Francis Ford's shipping company which controls all access to the city and is strangling it -- despite its evident prosperity -- sends a bunch of scalawags to stop the railroad surveyors. Only a masked bandit called Pinto Pete (Ashton Dearholt), his deadly whip, and his comic servant stand guard against the desperate villains.\n\nIt all sounds pretty unlikely, and that's the way director Francis Ford handles this comedy-adventure. Dearholt and pal are a mock heroic pair, like the Cisco Kid would become when reduced to B movie status twenty years later. There is some spectacular fight sequence in high cliffs that look a lot like the sort of thing that the serials had been doing for a while; Ford had starred in and directed them for Universal, when he and Grace Cunard were Universal's top moneymakers. Now he was working for the States Rights market instead, but he still knew how to shoot a fight sceneâ¦.£7.49\n\nLast Berlin Taxi, The (1926)\n\n**Now with English intertitles!!**\n\nStarring Lupu Pick and Hedwig Wandel. Decent print. Runtime: 73 minsâ¦..£7.49\n\nLast Chance, The (1926)\n\nStarring Bill Patton and Dorothy Donald.\n\nReview: With so many silent westerns having been made, and so few of those having survived, I'll watch pretty much any silent western I can find. This 1926 entry starring Bill Patton is above average, and as a footnote was directed by Horace Carpenter, of later fame as the mad doctor in Dwain Esper's 1934 sleaze classic MANIAC. The plot here involves the standard \"stolen payroll\", and for the first ten minutes or so things are played out in a solid but standard manner, but then when Patton decides to infiltrate the gang, he does NOT do it by pretending to be a rough and tumble criminal from some other part of the country, but does it as a greenhorn in mail-order \"outlaw clothes\" who comes off as a buffoon. The gang does need another member, and this guy obviously poses no threat, so why not bring him on...the gang also relishes being able to make fun of him. Patton shows a wonderful Stan Laurel-like comic presence during these scenes, and he is teamed against gang leader \"Black Bart\" played wonderfully by Merrill McCormick, who looks like a long-haired and bearded Robert Walker Jr. There are a lot of close-ups in the film, and Carpenter comes off as a first-rate director of low-budget indie westerns. Each character is vividly drawn and the action moves at a brisk pace, but there is a lot of entertainment value and I'm sure the children of the day would have gotten a big laugh out of many scenes. I look forward to seeing more of his workâ¦.£7.49\n\nLast Command, The (1928)\n\nFeaturing the performance that gave Emil Jannings the very first best actor oscar and directed by Josef Von Sternberg. Also starring William Powell.\n\nPlot: A decorated, aristocratic Czarist General is reduced to penury after the collapse of Imperial Russia. An old adversary, now a successful director hires the general to re-enact the revolution which deposed him.\n\nReview: Josef von Sternberg's \"The Last Command\" is probably his finest film. It is one of the only times that Sternberg was able to add story and acting to his preoccupation with the visual picture. The credit for the acting goes all to Jannings who gives a powerful performance as the General with a haunting past. He definitely deserved the first Best Actor Oscar that he did receive...£7.49\n\nLast Days of Pompeii, The (1913)\n\nDirected by Mario Caserini and Eleuterio Rodolfi and starring Fernanda Negri Pouget, Eugenia Tettoni Fior, Ubaldo Stefani and and Antonio Grisanti, this film has a runtime of 87 mins and the print quality is very good to excellent. This longer better quality print is now available with the original intertitles plus additional English subtitles.\n\nPlot: Well respected Pompeiian Glaucus performs an act of kindness by buying Nidia, a blind slave being mistreated by her owner. Nidia falls in love with her new master, but he only has eyes for Jone. Jone in turn is lusted after by Arbace, an Egyptian high priest of Isis. When Nidia beseeches Isis for help in capturing Glaucus' heart, Arbace gives her a \"love\" potion, which really will affect his mind and not his heart, thus opening the way to Jone for himself. When Arbace's disciple is murdered Glaucus finds himself in hot water, shortly after which Mt. Vesuvius erupts.\n\nReview: An evil Egyptian priest menaces a young Roman maiden while a blind slave girl shows great courage in attempting to rescue her beloved master, during THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII.\n\nProduced less than two decades after the birth of cinema, this silent film is considered to be the first important historical epic filmed on a truly grand scale. It also heralded the arrival of the Italian movie industry as a force to be reckoned with, however briefly, in the halcyon days before World War One.\n\nProduced by prolific director Mario Caserini (1874-1920), it features a completely static camera which has the effect of turning each shot into a living tableau. (The only exceptions are a few pan shots of flowing lava which were inserted in the film's final moments.) Caserini manages his early crowd scenes very nicely, in which everyone looks like they're actually doing something and have a reason to be in the shot. The use of light & shadow on the large sets is also most commendable.\n\nThe final twenty minutes, when Vesuvius blows her top and destroys Pompeii, features special effects which are still quite impressive. After more than an hour of silver toned film, the abrupt switch to red tints at the instant of the eruption is a definite attention grabber.\n\nMuch of the acting is very theatrical & overripe, but that was the style back then and was probably much affected by grand opera. Two performers should be noted - Fernanda Negri Pouget is quite touching as the tragic blind girl, and Ubaldo Stefani, as the hero, is unintentionally hilarious in the scene in which he drinks a witch's poisoned brew.\n\nThe film's final moments embrace a mature sensitivity and highlight the latent power of the cinematic image. â¦..£7.49\n\nLast Days of Pompeii, The (1926)\n\nDirected by Victor Varconi this Italian silent film with Italian only intertitles and a runtime of 175 mins is timecoded and the print quality is ok.\n\nReview: The last of the great silent Italian epics, The Last Days of Pompeii is as lavish as anything produced by Hollywood at that time - only much, much raunchier. During an orgy in the house of the evil priest Arbaces, naked slave girls are served up (literally!) on platters decked with flowers. A nubile mummy rises out of her sarcophagus to do a striptease and bare-breasted sphinx statues come to life as her chorus line. In the gladiators' tavern, wildly effeminate men (kohl-dark eyelids and lipstick as thick as clotted blood) drool and bat their eyes over so much naked, muscular flesh. All in all, the most satisfyingly decadent Ancient Rome saga until Fellini Satyricon in 1968! In between the orgies and the rampant homoeroticism, directors Amleto Palermi and Carmine Gallone stick close to the Victorian melodramatics of Bulwer-Lytton's novel. The blind flower girl Nydia (Maria Korda) loves the dumb but good-hearted hunk Glaucus (Victor Varconi) who prefers the demure and aristocratic Ione (Rina de Liguoro). Ione, alas, is lusted after by the villainous Arbaces (Bernhard Goetzke) who also has a close...er...friendship with her brother Apicedes. A gorgeous young ephebe who resembles an Aubrey Beardsley angel, Apicedes can find nothing better to do than convert to Christianity. The best way, apparently, to 'wash himself clean of sin.' You can always spot the Christians in these movies. They're the un-photogenic ones - the ones with glum faces and no jewels. But piety is no guarantee of salvation once Mount Vesuvius finally blows its top. The Grand Finale incorporates newsreel footage of an real volcanic eruption - so we're treated to the anachronistic but wholly delightful sight of two cameramen in modern dress, scurrying down the slopes to escape the burning lava! We watch, well-pleased, as the opulent sets crumble into still-more-opulent ruins. No, they really don't make 'em like that anymore! Not that anybody these days would have the nerveâ¦..£7.49\n\nLast Edition, The (1925)\n\nDirected by Emory Johnson and starring Ralph Lewis, Lila Leslie, Ray Hallor, Frances Teague and Rex Lease, this film has a runtime of 80 mins and the print quality is excellent.\n\nPlot: The assistant foreman of the San Francisco Chronicle press-room, Tom MacDonald is passed over for the post of foreman in favor of a younger man. He gains satisfaction, though, when his son, Ray, obtains a good job in the district attorney's office. Reporter Clarence Walker, in love with MacDonald's daughter, Polly, is sent to obtain evidence against notorious bootlegger Sam Blotz, who is protected by Assistant District Attorney Gerald Fuller. Blotz and Fuller frame Ray to put Walker off their track. Although his conscience bothers him, Walker reports the story in time for the last edition. MacDonald attempts to stop the presses, and when Blotz's henchman, \"Red\" Moran, blows up the building, MacDonald is blamed and put in jail with his son. Walker eventually uncovers evidence exonerating the father and son, MacDonald is made foreman, and a new newspaper plant is built.\n\nReview: The Last Edition (1925) is a pleasant enough silent film. The main guy is a old news paper man hoping to get his promotion after 20 years in waiting. But we get a look into the office of the executives and his yes-men and the world of gangsters as things doesn't exactly go the right way for our good man and his decent family. A fairly captivating action film at times with it's share of shortcomings. And as a real curio the real Police Chief of San Francisco makes a cameo. That's none other then Daniel J. O'Brien, the father of Hollywood star George O'Brien! You can see him having pictures of his son on the wall during his scenes. In another Hollywood connection Dan O'Brien was actually the one to order the arrest of \"Fatty\" Arbuckle in 1921!...£7.49\n\nLast Indian Attack, The aka El Ultimo Malon (1917)\n\nDirected by Alcides Greca.

It has a discreet logo throughout.\n\nPlot: The film evolves during the French Revolution. Alaine de lâEstelle (Diomira Jacobini) and her maid Leontine (Karina Bell) try to flee Paris. Alaine is expected by her fiance, Ernest de Tresailles (Walter Rilla), at the castle of Trionville. Alaine and Leontine get unexpected help from Marc Aron (Ekman), lieutenant in the revolutionary army. He is member of the Jacobines, who right after the marriage of Ernest and Alaine occupy Trionville. For love of Alaine Marc tries to help Ernest and by consequence is himself arrested and executed. The film premiered at the Berlin Mozartsaal in 1928 and was an international success. In particular Ekman 's performance was lauded. Still it took till 2010 for a print from Moscow to emerge at the film archive of Toulouse, which was sent to the Filmmuseum Potsdam, where it was restored and re-premiered in March 2011. It was considered then to have an overdosis of pathos and heroism, but still be an enjoyable film full of excitementâ¦.£7.49\n\nLast of the Mohicans, The (1920)\n\nStarring Wallace Beery and directed by Clarence Brown.\n\nReview: As Alice and Cora Munro attempt to find their father, a British officer in the French and Indian War, they are set upon by French soldiers and their cohorts, Huron tribesmen led by the evil Magua. Fighting to rescue the women are Chingachgook and his son Uncas, the last of the Mohican tribe, and their white ally, the frontiersman Natty Bumppo, known as Hawkeye. Keeping the storyline close to that of the original novel, this is perhaps the best telling of the Cooper classic. Great photography, and what for the time, must have been considered \"under-acting\" maintain a timelessness to this version. It is interesting to see a somewhat slim Wallace Beery as the villain Magua. While the 1936 Randolph Scott version is good, this one is the best, much more so than the Daniel Day Lewis atrocity produced in the 90s!!!â¦.£7.49\n\nLast Outlaw, The (1927)\n\nStarring Gary Cooperâ¦â¦£7.49\n\nLast Performance, The (1927)\n\nStarring Conrad Veidt and Mary Philbinâ¦â¦£7.49\n\nLast Round-Up, The (1929)\n\nSilent western starring Bob Custer and Hazel Mills.\n\nPlot: There is trouble on the Bar D ranch as cowhand Mile Ahead plans to rustle the herd.

He leaves the palace dressed as a hunter and goes to a far corner of the Principality. There he meets Katrina, the daughter of an innkeeper. Katrina is so winning and wholesome, just the kind of girl that the Prince has not been used to, that he asks if he can secure a room at the inn. He is accommodated and finds that the more he sees of Katrina the more he hates to leave and go back to the old life. Finally the court becomes impatient at the absence of the Prince and sends couriers to find him and persuade him to return. Katrina's brother has taken the Prince to task on account of his interest in Katrina and hot words pass. Raolf attacks the Prince, not knowing who he is. While the struggle is taking place Von Tromp enters and Raolf is astounded to learn that they have had the Prince as their guest. The diplomatic relations between Saxe-Tholberg and Austrania have been strained owing to some trouble over the boundary, and war is imminent. The Ambassador of Austrania, anxious to secure the plans of Saxe-Tholberg, corrupts one of the officers of the Saxe-Tholberg army and meets him at the inn kept by Katrina's father. Their conversation there is overheard by Katrina and her brother, who enter the room and accuse the officer of being false to his country. The Austranian Ambassador attacks Raolf. Katrina secures a weapon and accidentally shoots the Ambassador. Two officers who have accompanied the Ambassador enter. They seize Raolf and accuse him of the crime. Raolf is arrested and condemned to death in spite of the protests of Katrina, who tells the court that she did the shooting, and of the plot which they discovered. The Saxe-Tholberg officer, however, had escaped and taken the papers with him, so there was no proof of Katrina's story and the sentence of death is ordered to be carried out. Katrina makes a last appeal to the Prince, who pardons Raolf. The Austranian Nation demand satisfaction, but not being able to get it, declare war. In the ensuing war the forces of Saxe-Tholberg are not very successful in a crucial battle the leader of the Saxe-Tholberg forces is wounded and the flag is shot from the flag pole. Becoming demoralized, the Sax-Tholberg army is about to retreat when the Prince calls for a volunteer to raise the flag. The pole is on a small hill which is swept by the fire of the enemy, and it means almost sure death for one who makes the attempt. Raolf starts out but is killed before he attains his object. Several others make the attempt but are not successful. Finally Katrina offers herself and in spite of the protests of the officers and of the Prince, rushes from the house toward the standard. The very boldness of the attempt being made by a woman ensures its success, and the wavering forces of Saxe-Tholberg rally and drive the enemy back. Katrina's reward is that which falls to the lot of many patriots who offer their life for their country's goodâ¦.£7.49\n\nLast Warning, The (1929)\n\nDirected by Paul Leni and starring Laura La Plante, Montagu Love, Margaret Livingston and John Boles, this film has a runtime 77 mins and the print quality is good.\n\nReview: Paul Leni (The Cat and the Canary, The Man Who Laughs) directs this Universal horror film, which has been forgotten over the years but if you've seen some of the studios bigger pictures then you've can tell what all this film has influenced. A popular show on Broadway, inside a creepy theatre, is closed down after the mysterious murder of one of the actors. Years later the police reassemble the original cast and bring them back to the theater to see if they can trap the murderer but it might be a ghost they're dealing with. This film mixes elements of The Phantom of the Opera with the old dark house themes of films like The Bat and delivers a terrific entertainment. This film has never been officially released so I had to view it via what appears to be a 16mm print and the quality was pretty bad throughout so if I get a chance to see a pristine print then I'll probably bump my review up. The technical eye of Leni, who died after this film, is untouched by nearly everyone as he's constantly trying new and different things with the camera. I love how he'll have a medium shot and then move the camera in to show some evidence before moving it back out to let the action role. The film runs just under 80-minutes and goes by very fast with some exciting action but also a great story to work with. The actors, including John Boles who would later appear in Frankenstein, all do nice work as well. There are a few twists and turns along the way that actually work well within the story. This film works on a technical level as well as the story level and that makes this a wonderful little gem that needs to be rediscovered. The only thing people know about this movie nowdays is that it was a huge influence on James Whale and this is easy to see. There's a woman here, used as comic relief, which is later a carbon copy in Una O'Connor. The Old Dark House also lifts some shots here but I won't say which ones since it'll ruin scenes in both movies. The score here was also later reused in Dracula and this film was shot on the same sets as The Phantom of the Opera so there's a lot of connections here.â¦..£7.49\n\nLate Mathias Pascal, The (1926) **UPGRADE â Improved print**\n\nDirected by Marcel LâHerbier and starring Ivan Mozzkuhkin, Marcelle Pradot, Lois Moran and Pierre Batcheff, this film has a runtime of 172 mins and the print quality is excellent. This is a French silent film with French intertitles and English subtitles.\n\nPlot: Mathias Pascal, only son of a once rich family, marries beautiful Romilde, who has a terrible mother-in-law. She controls her daughter, and soon his home life becomes a nightmare, as well as his job as assistant librarian in his home town. His only moments of lights are his mother and his baby, but both die on the same day. Shocked he leaves his hometown and gets to Monte Carlo, where he wins a fortune at the Casino. Returning home, he reads his own obituary in a paper. They have found a corpse in a creek and connected it with his disappearance. Mathias, noticing that he now is free from all ties to his old live, decides to start a new one, and goes to Rome, where he rents a room in a pension full of fake spiritualists who are controlling the owner. The chief of the gang, Terence, wants to marry the owner's daughter Adrienne, and has convinced her father to give her to him, with no regards of Adrienne's feelings, who is in love with and loved by Mathias.\n\nReview: The White Russian exile Ivan Mosjoukine was arguably the greatest male star of the silent screen. Imagine an actor who combined the matinÃ©e idol looks of John Barrymore with the smoldering sexual magnetism of Valentino, the deft physical comedy of Chaplin with the dark Gothic creepiness of Lon Chaney. It sounds impossible, of course - unless you've seen Mosjoukine in action. One glance from those hypnotic, liquid eyes holds more power than all the others combined. Indeed, there's a strong case for Mosjoukine as the greatest actor in screen history. His stylised High Romantic playing has dated far less in 80 years than the Actor's Studio tricks of Brando and de Niro have dated in half that time. To see him in his great roles - and Matthias Pascal is one of those - is to feel time itself dissolve through the camera's lens. Mosjoukine, like Garbo, is one of a handful of screen stars whose work on celluloid has the immediacy of live performance. As a vehicle for Mosjoukine and his brilliance, The Late Matthias Pascal is one of the all-time greats. He starts off as an adolescent dreamer, last survivor of a ruined of a ruined aristocratic dynasty (much like Mosjoukine's own family in post-Revolutionary Russia). Blundering his way into marriage, he becomes a harassed and penniless family man, weighed down by wife, baby and the original Mother-In-Law From Hell. Only the awfulness of his home life allows him to tolerate his job - catching rats at the local library, whose mouldering piles of books resemble the last scene of Citizen Kane! Tragedy strikes, and Matthias runs away. Instantly, his luck changes. Winning a fortune at the Casino in Monte Carlo, he moves on to Rome - where he appears as a young gentleman of fashion. Soon enough, he falls in love with a young girl played by Lois Moran. An infatuation of F. Scott Fitzgerald and the model for Rosemanry in Tender Is the Night, Moran is similarly idealised in this film. Naturally, Matthias longs to do the decent thing and marry her. Yet he faces the same dilemma as most of Pirandello's heroes. If he isn't himself, who on Earth is he? As a work of cinema, The Late Matthias Pascal is not as spectacularly dotty as L'Herbier's 1924 masterpiece L'Inhumaine. It is also perhaps a shade too long. Yet its bravura sequences - the library, the casino, the dream sequences where Matthias is haunted by his 'dead' double - show L'Herbier as an unjustly neglected genius, worthy of a place next to Lang and von Stroheim in Film Studies 101. His spectacular use of real-life locations is unusual for the 20s. But Mosjoukine is the most spectacular sight of all!â¦.£7.49\n\nLaughing at Danger (1924)\n\nStarring Richard Talmadge. Review: A lovelorn man accidentally happens upon a missing piece of death ray machine, and becomes the target of criminals intent on using the machine.This silent action/comedy with science fiction elements (the death ray) has a fun idea at the center of it; our hero laughs at danger not because he's so brave, but because he believes he's in the middle of an elaborate practical joke set up by his father to raise his spirits after he is rejected by the woman he loves. Therefore, he never really believes he's in danger, and that is the joke of the situation. The movie is amusing enough, but it never really takes this premise to its ultimate possibilitiesâ¦.£7.49\n\nLaughter and Tears (1921)\n\nDirected by B.E.Doxat Pratt and starring Evelyn Brent, Adelqui Migliar, Dorothy Fane and Maudie Dunham, this film has a runtime of 69 mins and the print quality is very good to excellent.

A woman falls in love with a struggling artist, who later becomes famous and decides to leave Venice for a lucrative career.\n\nReview: A British silent from 1921 you say? Canât be much cop can it? Well, itâs not a classic but it is very enjoyable not least for those glamorous backdrops but also for the hints of Bright Young Thing hard-partying. Then thereâs Miss Brent, her face slightly fuller than in her von Sternberg films but with that famous profile, the infamous sulk, those piercing eyes all much in evidence.\n\nShe is the standout performer in the film as director B. E. Doxat-Pratt gives her plenty of close-up as well as walking shots as she drifts, wrapped in darkened shawl along the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es or down canal-sides. She also laughs and not in a world-weary or loaded wayâ¦ but then she is meant to a bohemian sprite, an unaffected creature of pure and simple emotionâ¦.£7.49\n\nLaw And The Outlaw, The (1913)\n\nStarring Tom Mix and Myrtle Stedman. Review: According to Blackhawk Films who distributed the standard 8 format of this film, it originally(in 1914) was a 2 reeler, but at least 5 years later as Mix's popularity began to soar it was combined with another 2 reeler to provide a near feature length film for his ever growing audience. It still stayed true to the overall story, although the ending was altered somewhat. The plot chiefly is fairly interesting and Mix's performance is good, but the abundance of inter-titles is a drawback as well as the camera work which in general relies on the medium shot. There are about only 2 medium close shots, and no \"close-ups\" at all! What is really different about this Western is that the hero is definitely not your stereotypical hero, as he flirts with disaster more times than not. Dakota Joe(Mix) is on the run for crime attributed to him but actually committed by his brother. There is a $1000 reward poster for him nearby which he promptly crumbles up. Maybe he is on the run because of his pullover striped shirt he is wearing! It's a dead giveaway. There is a 1912 photograph of him wearing a similar shirt in the book, A Pictorial History of the Silent Film, so perhaps he was experimenting in a trademark style which thankfully he must have been talked out of. Anyhow, we are introduced to the characters at the Paradise Valley Ranch he has ridden up to. There is the foreman(troublemaker) and the ranch owner. Dakota joins up with the outfit and soon is well acquainted with the local beauty, Grace. At round-up time they ride together and the foreman doesn't like it. Next, a fight between two of the cattle is showcased. Then as everyone has settled down for eats, a bull is on the loose and after Grace. Dakota Joe comes to the rescue, bringing the animal down, although he also is totally spent. At his weakest now, the law happens to ride up and take advantage of the scene in order to capture him. As they begin leading him into town, he escapes. Dakota then is able to steal a gun from a sleeping man. The law return to the ranch hands and seek their help. Next we see, a rare(in this film) medium close shot of Dakota shooting his handcuffs apart. Before you know it, the posse once again catch up to him and there is a shootout. Dakota Joe gets away, but not long after gets thrown from his horse! What Western star does this? He is not too far from the whole crowd now, and in fact Grace takes out a telescope(how many of those do you see in a Western?) and is able to ascertain Dakota's safety. Well, the law once again captures and leads him off to jail, with Grace remarking, between sobs, that she will wait for him. Maybe events now will take a turn for the best, as when we see Dakota Joe behind bars he is wearing a white dress shirt! After a short interval Grace gets concerned that Dakota will be mistreated at the jail house. What follows is a scene that no doubt was not new even then, but would be repeated countless times in future Westerns. It's the old \"hiding the saw in the picnic basket trick\" that Grace resorts to! This works and he soon breaks out. Once again, though, luck is not on his side. He suffers more hazards than the \"Hazzards of Helen\" and \"Perils of Pauline\" put together! What happens this time is his horse goes lame. To escape his pursuers, an inventive scene, which once again would be used in later pictures, takes place. Dakota takes apart his rifle and uses it as a breathing tube to hide under water. As the posse pass him by and are out of site, he continues for some distance on foot. It is not long before he collapses. An old prospector(is there any other kind?) with a telescope(they must be on sale!) finds him and brings Dakota to his cabin to get well. There is some confusion later which reminds the viewer that they are actually viewing 2 combined films, but the conclusion is nicely worked out, and one more medium close shot is thrown in for good measure.

Review: Uncommonly fine little rural romance, where the familiar plot contrivances (mother love, war heroics, the \"Daddy Long Legs\" motif of the benefactor falling in love with his ward) are transcended by sensitive treatment.

The merchant Zhurov is in love with Nata, and hopes to marry her, but she is non-committal. When Zhurov introduces his friend Prince Bartinsky to the family, both young women soon fall in love with the dashing but irresponsible prince. The prince is in love with Nata, but because of his enormous debts, he decides to marry Musya to get her dowry, and he allows Nata to marry Zhurov. All the while, Mrs. Khromova remains very uneasy, fearing that marriage is unlikely to cause the self-indulgent prince to change his ways.\n\nReview: Yevgeni Bauer's \"Silent Witnesses\" (or \"Mute Witnesses\") (1914) had at the center of its story a love circle, as does this film, \"A Life for a Life\". The two films also share the same aesthetic, as is visible in much of Bauer's work: that is, the art of mise-en-scÃ¨ne. Supposedly, Bauer was attempting here to make a film that would compete with foreign spectacles. Perhaps, that is why the sets and production values of this film are especially lavish. A fantasy scene resembles an Italian epic, such as \"Quo Vadis?\" or \"Cabiria\", and columns are visible throughout the mansion. The melodrama is sensational, and the suspense is befitting of D.W. Griffith. Nonetheless, the picture still mostly resembles Bauer's own oeuvre.\n\nThe story will do. The acting isn't that remarkable, although Vera Kholodnaya, apparently a star in her day, is lovely and has a fairly expressive face. Her major gift, however, is the white of her eyes, which the camera can record from quite a distance. The sets are more interesting, their design and the way they are filled to create depth and space. In one scene, a curtain is used to unveil the truth. Bauer used curtains in other films for various reasons, including to reference theatre. Lighting effects also add to the mise-en-scÃ¨ne.\n\nThe mise-en-scÃ¨ne is probably better than that in most of Bauer's other works, at least in the lushness of set design, but what makes the most difference as to whether the film works on a whole is what supports the mise-en-scÃ¨ne. And, this is where Bauer has failed before. I don't care much for filmed plays and that's what one could call \"Silent Witnesses\". By that, I mean a traditional story and plot filmed by a stationary camera from long shots in long takes. In \"A Life for a Life\", there is some camera movement (slow inward and outward dolly shots, such as in the double wedding scene), and Bauer's usual cinematographer, Boris Savelyev, deserves credit, but it's mostly through editing that Bauer keeps the film moving.\n\nSome of it is simple (but very important), such as cuts from establishing shots to medium shots and closer looks. There's some mild crosscutting between the five characters. But, Bauer also displays an expert knowledge of continuity editing; for example, when Nata stands up, angry with the prince, the film cuts from the closer look to a long shot. This is common practice nowadays, but not always in 1916, such as in those Italian spectacles, or PathÃ© film d'art photoplays. Some of the cuts might be too quick, but that's a minor error.\n\nBauer's most impressive editing in his films is the flow of shots that he sometimes attains. There is a hint of it here, such as in the passionate meeting between Nata and the Prince when her husband catches them. The editing--the way the shots flow into the next--creates the mood. \"A Life for a Life\" isn't the best film by Bauer that I've seen (see \"After Death\" (1915) and \"The Dying Swan\" (1917)), but it's how a film should be at the most basic level, and from there, Bauer fills it with, among other things, interesting mise-en-scÃ¨ne. â¦â¦£7.49\n\nLife of Dante aka Dante e Beatrice (1913)\n\nDirected by Mario Caserini and starring Oreste Grandi, Fernanda Negri Pouget, Giovanni Enrico Vidali and Cesare Gani Carini, this film has a runtime of 44 mins and the print quality is excellent.

The film has French and English intertitles.\n\nStoryline: We first see Moliere at work in his father's shop, when a boy. All the employees are busy at their appointed tasks, except the youthful playwright, who snatches time to re-read one of his earliest efforts. The door opens and the Italian comedian, Scaramouche, enters in quest of a particular style of chair. Moliere tenders his play for perusal; but, just as Scaramouche begins to be interested, Poquelin, the father of Moliere, comes in unexpectedly and the play is hastily thrown out of sight. Again the boy poet places it in the comedian's hand, and some clever work is done by Scaramouche, as he tries to read the manuscript without being detected by the stern upholsterer. The next scene shows Moliere at the Louvre palace, where he meets Louis XIV for the first time. Here we see the scorn of the courtiers for the actor-dramatist and the consideration shown for him by the King. This scene will be remembered for the delicate beauty of the interiors shown. Next we view the stately splendor of the festival at Versailles, where hundreds of courtiers, ladies in waiting and great nobles attend on Louis XIV. The beauty of the court costumes, which set the fashion for all the royal houses in Europe at that time, and the courtly air and demeanor of every individual in the royal pageant, have been faithfully reproduced. One cannot but marvel at the excellence of the training of this vast throng, every one of whom acts his or her part as if manor-born. We must take off our hats to this Gaumont producer. As Moliere comes into the scene, the acting of the King, the courtiers and of the great actor himself, is faultless. When the King places his arm around Moliere's shoulders and walks off with him, it is a delight to watch the faces of the surprised and jealous train of followers. And when next we see Louis seated at table with Moliere, serving him with his own hands, the cup of the courtiers is full. The scene showing the distraction of Moliere over the desertion of his wife is a pathetic picture and displays talented emotional acting. Then, when she appears before finally leaving him, and we watch the play of coquetry on her witching face and note her charm of manner and grace of deportment, we do not wonder at poor Moliere's abandonment to despair. The attempt of the faithful maid servant to arouse Moliere from his apathy and melancholia is a brilliant specimen of silent acting in both roles. The last appearance of Moliere, and his first in the role of Malade, is a fine depiction of the stage of the tennis court theater and of the French manner of acting a part in the seventeenth century. Then follow his sudden illness and deathâ¦.£7.49\n\nLife of Buffalo Bill, The (1912)\n\nStarring William F.Cody and featuring Pearl White in a minor role, this film has a runtime of 33 mins and the print quality is OK to Good.\n\nPlot: While on a vacation, an elderly Buffalo Bill dreams of his adventures as a young man when he scouted for the cavalry, fought Indians and captured outlawsâ¦.£7.49\n\nLife of the Jews in Palestine (1913)\n\nThis film is now available with English intertitles and has a runtime of 61 minsâ¦..£7.49\n\nLife of The Party, The (1920)\n\nDirected by Joseph Hanabery and starring Roscoe âFattyâ Arbuckle, Winifred Greenwood, Roscoe Karns, Julia Faye and Frank Campeau, this film has a runtime of 54 mins and the print quality is excellent.The film also features uncredited parts for William Boyd and Lucien Littlefield.\n\nPlot: Milly Hollister, the secretary for the Better Babies League, consults Judge Voris for advice in her fight against the milk trust, unaware that he is in collusion with the trust. The judge refers Milly to attorney Algernon Leary, whom he regards as an incompetent buffoon. The corpulent attorney is so smitten with Milly that, although impoverished, he tears up her check and accepts the case for nothing. When the case comes to trial under Judge Voris, he makes Leary appear ridiculous and throws him out of court. Angered, Leary denounces Voris, now a mayoral candidate, as a tool of the trust, and with the backing of Milly's organization decides to run for mayor himself. To discredit his opponent, Voris hires a notorious woman called French Kate to compromise Leary. The scandal alienates Milly, who announces her betrothal to Voris. After a series of misadventures, Leary is vindicated and wins both Milly and the election. âAFI\n\nReview: \"He gave up his seat on the trolley to three women.\"\n\nYes, he was known as \"Fatty\" and his roles often played on or against his size and weight. But he really was an actor, even if he didn't always get a chance to prove it.\n\n\"Life of the Party,\" probably an unfortunate title considering the event that ended his acting career, gave him such a chance.\n\nIt was a sort-of comedy about politics and corruption -- which pretty much go together like \"horse and carriage\" and \"love and marriage\" -- but with lots of dramatic and sometimes adult situations.\n\nArbuckle was a large man but with lots of physical abilities, some even say \"acrobatic.\" He used everything in \"Life of the Party,\" including some serious facial expressions, to create quite believably a young would-be reformer lawyer -- would-be reformer because of the hoped-for love of the proverbial good woman.\n\nNone of his fellow cast members is known today except Roscoe Karns, an excellent character actor of especially the 1930s, but all were superbly worth watchingâ¦.£7.49\n\nLife Story of David Lloyd George, The (1918)\n\nDirected Maurice Elveyâ¦.. £7.49\n\nLife Story of John Lee, or The Man They Could No Hang, The (1921)\n\nDirected by Arthur W.Sterry this film has a runtime of 81 mins and the print quality is decentâ¦..£7.49\n\nLige Conley Short Films (1924-1928)\n\n3 short comedies from this forgotten silent comedian:\n\nAir Pockets (1924) with Earl Montgomery, Sunshine Hart and Olive Borden.

The film stars Marion Davies and Conrad Nagel, and is an adaptation of the play The Merry Wives of Gotham by Laurence Eyre (USA). The film has color sequences using tinting, Technicolor, and the Handschiegl color process. The play was produced on Broadway at Henry Miller's Theatre from January 16, 1924 to April 1924. Davies' part was played on the stage by actress Mary Ellis.\n\nReview: \"Lights of Old Broadway\" (1925) stars Marion Davies and Conrad Nagel. Davies plays twins whose mother dies on the way over to America on a ship, and now the twins are separated by being given to two different families, one a very poor Irish immigrating family and the other a very wealthy American banking family. Based on the stage play \"The Merry Wives of Gotham\", this is told in rip-snorting style, with Davies as the Irish lassie now a star in an earthy burlesque (not strip!) joint in a tough section of NYC around 1870. She's also (as her twin) the respectable, slightly uppity daughter of banker Frank Currier and his wife Julia Swayne Gordon. Eventually the two meet, of course, but do they ever figure out who they are? Is it necessary that they do? It's the DNA and how it makes the girls behave when together that counts!\n\nConrad Nagel plays the son of banker Currier, and he falls madly in love with the poor squatter, the Irish lass Fely O'Tandy. Of course this starts a rumpus which drives the wheels of the film; that, and the fact that Currier wishes to drive off the squatters, all the Irish and other immigrant souls who've squatted on a certain piece of land. Of course, too, the O'Tandy's live on that land.\n\nWonderful bit of hokum! It's loads of fun watching Davies and her Irish father, Charles McHugh, battle their way through all of the plotting before them. This new release from Kino-Lorber is superb! Tinted, with at least one handschiegl scene and Technicolor in a couple of others, this is an absolutely beautiful restoration. Very highly recommended!\n\nFor the record, you'll love seeing Teddy Roosevelt as a young boy, Tom Edison trying to market his \"sound machine\", and all the references to lighting the streets of the downtown city with electric arc lamps as opposed to gas. The last figures prominently in the plot of the film. Tony Pastor and Weber and Fields are also integrated into the plot. If you look closely, you'll see Karl Dane, George K. Arthur, and even Mary Gordon in small or insignificant parts. Matthew Betz has one scene as the leader of a plot against those who would move the squatters from their property.â¦..£7.49\n\nLilac Time (1928)\n\nStarring Colleen Moore and Gary Cooper. Review: Colleen Moore at the height of her stardom turned from flapper and comedy roles (like \"Flaming Youth\" and \"Ella Cinders\") to a great WW I romance, Lilac Time. Moore plays a French village girl who falls in love with a British flying ace (Gary Cooper). Not much happens, but it's a sweet romance and was a big hit in its day. This film also established Cooper as a star. Some OK dog fight footage helps enliven this war film, but it's the chemistry between the stars that makes it special. Good special effects for its time, and a socko ending with Moore being told Cooper has died of his wounds.... A real tear jerker but it works. Among the co-stars are Eugenie Besserer and Arthur Lake. Colleen Moore had a great face and is very expressive, allowing her to under act, a skill that made Mary Pickford and Lillian Gish tops starsâ¦..£7.49\n\nLimite (1931)\n\n**Now with English intertitles!!**\n\nBrazilian silent film directed by Mario Peixoto.

Please note that the film contains French only intertitles at the moment.\n\nPlot: In the kingdom of the Moguls, Prince Roudghito-Sing, a young officer of the palace, falls in love with Zemgali, a captive princess held prisoner and coveted by the Grand Khan. Fleeing the country, he takes refuge in Paris and his presentability allows him to be hired as an actor by a French film company. The trouble is that Anna, the star of the movie, is attracted to him, which displeases banker Morel, the producer and Anna's lover\n\nReview: I was beaming with joy throughout - one of my favorite filmmakers, a keen theorist at the time, directing one of the most interesting actors of the era, in a film that superficially seems to be about movie-like excess and indulgence, conceived on a lavish scale, - the Grand Khan, throngs in costumes outside the palace, cavalcades, danger and intrigue - but is actually about shatters of a fabricated story falling from the mind.\n\nThis interests me doubly, triply, because I've been keeping track of the Russian cinematic trail into Paris. Perhaps the single most important missing link in this endeavor is L'angoissant Aventure, actually filmed on the run from the Soviets over a period of months as the Ermolief troupe, the Russian cinematic aristocracy before Eisenstein, was forced to relocate to Paris, where it made acquiantances with the new generation coming into film. I have not been able to find that film, so if any reader has information I would be grateful to know.\n\nThankfully we have this; incidentally also about an aristocrat, a Mongol prince, forced into exile in France and bumping into a film production en route there. No wonder Mozzhukhin wrote the script. His next film would be for L'Herbier.\n\nThe joys in this are manifold. If you are one of those who labor under the impression that silent film was all about pantomime, theatric setups, simplified emotion and gross ahistoricity, you will have the chance to smirk at the exotic movie Tibet portrayed here and the melodrama of forbidden princely love, then have the rug pulled from under your feet as the film washes up in France and turns unerringly modern. The acting is subdued, the camera captures amazing views from a car in motion, a new geography unknown before the camera, the relationship between prospective lovers is ambiguous. Epstein beautifully renders the confrontation of the two cinematic worlds, as the furious Prince breaks up a scene of the woman being strongarmed by a villain on the ship, acting honorably only to be told they're shooting a movie so it's all make-believe.\n\nMore cool stuff ahead. So the Prince turns into an actor and starring in a movie as himself, presumably a wild adventure like the opening of the actual film. Is this the first film about a film being made in the history of the medium? If not, it's certainly the first intelligent one, and perhaps the only one until Sternberg four years later.\n\nSee what Epstein does. We know that the Prince was exiled and the throne usurped from him by an impostor, passing as the king in the king's place, so we have an actor on that end that looks like a movie but is supposed to be real calling the shots that produce the chain of events. Back in France, we are among actors, our character one, and spend time on the backlot of film sets.\n\nSo it's no surprise that the finale is an actual marvel of cinematic deception, inside an upscale hotel, where police are waiting for the Prince outside the glass facade with couples faintly seen dancing inside the lobby as though projected on a movie screen. There is a ball masque where confetti rains on our masked lovers, on par with anything Sternberg conceived and predating him by a good number of years.\n\nMore clues; a one-eyed pianist, the monocle on the banker that makes his one bulging eye look like a lens, the dreamy finale obviously a deathbed hallucination.\n\nAnd something else. Music is of a high importance here, all through the film we can see violinists accompanying the production - but of course the film-within is naturally going to be silent, the score performed live in each theater as was customary. We can only presume they are playing to set the mood for the actors. Epstein superimposes at one point violins being fiddled over the lull of waves at sea.\n\nSo we have something invisible, in our case inaudible, that serves only to cultivate the space around the normally fabricated art. Say a melodrama filmed as a poem. This was Epstein's innovation, the music all in the roaming eye fiddling across the world....£7.49\n\nLittle American, The (1917)\n\nStarring Mary Pickford.

Her brother stalks the accused slayer and finally shoots him down in the street. Mary rushes to the hospital and offers her blood for a life-saving transfusion, even though she thinks she'll die.\n\nReview: Although the concept of a 32 year old woman portraying a 12 year old girl might be a stretch for today's sophisticated audiences,in the 1920's this was what the fans of Mary Pickford desired and expected from their favorite star. The opening scene displays Annie's tomboyish character as the apparent leader of a multi-ethnic street gang in comic \"battle\" with a rival group. The sight of a young girl being socked in the jaw and kicked may be a bit crude, but the scene is played in such an \"Our Gang\" fashion that it would be hard to take any of this seriously. Anyway, Annie can dish it out as well as take it. Once Annie returns to her tenement home and replaces her street duds with more girlish attire, it becomes more difficult (especially in close-ups) to imagine this beautiful young woman as a street urchin. However, for those who can muster the required suspension of disbelief, the rest of the movie has it's rewards. Vacillating between comedy (Annie's gang puts on a show) to sentiment (Annie plans a birthday surprise for her Irish policeman father) to tragedy (her father is killed on his birthday), the film gives Mary ample opportunity to display a range of emotions that would please her fans of any era.\n\nOf course the requisite \"happy ending\" is eventually achieved; the evildoers are apprehended with the help of Annie's friends and rivals and she is last seen in the company of her pals riding down a busy thoroughfare on a sunny day. Which is a good a way as any for a Mary Pickford movie to end. . £7.49\n\nLittle Church Around The Corner (1923)\n\nStarring Claire Windsor, Kenneth Harlan, Hobart Bosworth and Pauline Starke.\n\nPlot: A wealthy minister in a mining town is something of an advocate for the miners' safety, but he doesn't really get involved in the issue.

V. Cortelyou, the magazine's publisher. Greatly taken by young girl, Cortelyou arranges for her to live with Dolly Griffith, a woman of questionable reputation who often aids him in his wicked schemes of blackmail and seduction. During a party, seemingly in Mary's honor, Cortelyou obtains some apparently, compromising evidence with which to blackmail Mrs. Young, the wife of a wealthy broker; Cortelyou then makes rough advances toward Mary, and one of his assistants, Jack McGuire, gives him a good beating. Threatened with blackmail, Mrs. Young turns in desperation to Jack for help. Jack and Mary attempt to trap Cortelyou in a net of his own making, but the blackmailer is too smart, outwitting Jack and abducting Mary. Cortelyou also kidnaps Mrs. Young, keeping her and Mary in a deserted house. Jack learns of their whereabouts and arrives with the police. Cortelyou is arrested, Mrs. Young is saved from the consequences of scandal, and Jack proposes to Mary.\n\nReview: The story behind the story is more interesting than the one that appears on screen -- which is about how sweet small-town girl Gladys Walton comes to New York City for a magazine competition and excitement, only to fall prey to the big bad Wolf of Broadway. It's a carefully calculated piece of work, something to suggest the wickedness of the big city to appeal to the prurient interests, like a DeMille picture, and yet have it small town values win out in the end -- the United States only shifted to an urban population in the 1920s, so there was a lot of nostalgia for small town values. The direction by Burton King is decent, the acting is good and the production values are okay. It's pretty much what you expect.\n\nThe story behind the story is that Gladys Walton was Al Capone's girl friend -- cue Cloris Leachman in BLAZING SADDLES screaming \"Yes! He was mein boyfriend! -- This got her knocked out of her contract with Universal Studios for violation of the morals clause. I don't think it was any great loss to the cinematic arts, but it does add a certain piquancy to the entire pictureâ¦.£7.49\n\nLittle House in Kolomna, The\n\nStarring Ivan Mozzhukin, Praskovya Maksimova and Sofya Goslavskaya.

Green and starring Mary Pickford, Claude Gillingwater, Joseph Dowling and James Marcus, this film has a runtime of 110 mins and the print quality is very good to excellent\n\nPlot: Young Cedric Errol lives with his widowed mother in New York City. Cedric's late father was a son of the Earl of Dorincourt, but the Earl had objected strongly to his son's marriage, and thus has long been estranged from Cedric and his mother. But when the Earl's only surviving son dies in a riding accident, Cedric suddenly becomes Lord Fauntleroy, the Earl's heir. Cedric and his mother travel to England, where they must overcome the Earl's hard feelings about the past, as well as some unexpected obstacles.\n\nReview: Just in itself, this is an entertaining version of the old-fashioned story of \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\", with good characterizations, settings, and story-telling. But what makes it particularly enjoyable is Mary Pickford's irresistible charm in a double role as young Cedric and as his mother.\n\nPickford's performance as the mother 'Dearest' is flawless, as she portrays her with elegance and grace, practically the image of the character that you get from the story. As Cedric, Pickford certainly gives the character a new look. There's nothing in the least to criticize about her performance, yet it's impossible not to be reminded of Pollyanna, Rebecca, or Pickford's other young girl roles. Even when she gives her character a rough-and-tumble look (at which she is very good), she is just too feminine and too attractive for it not to be noticeable. Yet her charm and buoyant energy make Cedric a thoroughly engaging character, if somewhat different from his literary image.\n\nThe rest of the production deserves plenty of credit as well. Several of the supporting characters are especially good. Claude Gillingwater strikes just the right note as the old Earl, and there is a trio of pleasant characters from Cedric's old neighborhood, who just have to come on screen to be good for a smile. The settings and photography are nicely done, never ostentatious but always providing an effective backdrop for the characters and story. Perhaps most impressive of all is the special effects wizardry that makes Pickford's dual performance work so well, frequently putting her two characters together without the slightest snag.\n\nThis is the kind of old-fashioned story that Pickford makes almost effortless, yet it's not hard to see a good number of strengths, both in her own performance and in the rest of the movie....£7.49\n\nLittle Mary Sunshine (1916)\n\nStarring âBabyâ Marie Osborne. Review: A precocious child brings a man and his estranged fiancÃ©e back together in this sentimental but extremely popular comedy-drama produced by the Balboa company of Long Beach, California. Five-year-old Baby Marie Osborne starred in the title-role, the motherless victim of a drunken father who stows away in the car of handsome Bob Daley (Henry King). Like Mary's father, young Daley is addicted to the devil brew, but his love for Little Mary Sunshine not only turns him into a teetotaler but reunites him with his estranged fiancÃ©e, Sylvia Stanford (Marguerite Nichols). This clichÃ©-ridden drama gave Baby Marie Osborne -- or as she was known around the studio, the \"Baby Grand\" -- international fame. Balboa would produce nine additional Baby Marie Osborne films, the little girl becoming arguably the company's most valuable asset. Director/leading man Henry King, also benefitting from his association with the child star, went on to enjoy a legendary career as a director of (mainly) rural romances, chiefly for Fox and its successor, 20th Century Fox. ~ Hans J.

When Lord Rintoul attempts to rout the rebellious weavers, Babbie always manages to send word in time to prevent their being taken by surprise. Gavin, new minister to the town, falls in love with Babbie, and his relationship with the young gypsy almost costs him his position. But what Gavin and his parishioners do not know is that Babbie is actually Lady Babbie, ward of Lord Rintoul.\n\nReview: Betty Compson stars as the Gypsy girl known as Babbie. She incurs the wrath of Lord Rintoul when it's suspected she has warned the riotous weavers that the police have been called. The local weavers are incensed that Rintoul has lowered their wages. The innocent new minister (George Hackathorne) gets involved after meeting Babbie by chance in the woods where he is writing his sermon. His infatuation with the wild beauty incurs the wrath of the local town council but he refuses to help entrap her. Will love prevail? Long thought lost, a print was found in a European archive and its intertitles have been translated into English. This was an important starring film for Betty Compson. It's interesting to see the role reversal with Compson playing the disguised hero and Hackathorne the young innocent. Compson is, as always, fascinating to watchâ¦.£7.49\n\nLittle Miss Hoover (1918)\n\nStarring Marguerite Clarkâ¦..£7.49\n\nLittle Orphant Annie (1918)\n\nStarring a very young Colleen Moore.

Plot: Little Sara Crewe is placed in a boarding school by her father when he goes off to war, but he does not understand that the headmistress is a cruel, spiteful woman who makes life miserable for Sara. Review: This simple but pleasant story is mostly worthwhile as a vehicle for Mary Pickford to play the kind of role that made her popular. Here, she is a young heiress trying to get used to her new surroundings at a school for girls, when a sudden tragedy changes everything. There isn't a lot to the plot, and so much of the screen time is simply used to show how charming young Sara (Pickford) can be. Pickford, of course, knows just how to make her character sympathetic. Most of the other characters are simply stock figures, except for a young Zasu Pitts, who gets a lot of screen time as Sara's friend. It's not one of Pickford's more memorable films, but it's a pleasant way to pass an hourâ¦â¦.£7.49\n\nLittle Robinson Crusoe (1924)\n\nDirected by Edward F.Cline and starring Jackie Coogan, Daniel J.OâBrien, Will Walling and Tom Santschi, this film has a runtime of 73 mins and the print quality is very good to excellent.\n\nPlot: A boy struggles to survive after being shipwrecked on a deserted island.\n\nReview: Following his performance in Chaplin's 'The Kid', Jackie Coogan became an astonishingly popular silent-film star while still a very young child. Sadly, the many millions of dollars earned by young Jackie were squandered by his parents and his stepfather. Because of Coogan's misfortune, the guardians of modern child actors are now required to keep their children's earnings in trust for their adulthood.\n\n'Little Robinson Crusoe' is one of Jackie's star vehicles. Young Mickey Hogan is the orphan cabin boy on a ship commanded by cruel Captain Dynes. Mickey's only friend is the ship's cat, named Man Friday. (The cat is black: clearly a racial reference.) A storm at sea (featuring some very bad miniatures, and unconvincing lightning) finds Mickey and Man Friday clinging to the wreckage. But a convenient island heaves into view.\n\nThe prospect of a small boy alone on a remote island could be frightening, but this movie plays for comedy. So we get some antics with monkeys hoying coconuts. There are also some African-looking natives, played in full racial stereotype and identified in the inter-titles as 'cannibals'.\n\nThe island next-door over is run by a white man: overseer Adolph Schmidt, accompanied by his pretty daughter Greta. The latter looks to be about 15 years old, about midway between Jackie's age and adulthood. When the native labourers decide to kill Schmidt, it's Jackie to the rescue.\n\nThere's a good performance by character actor Clarence Wilson, and a few clever sequences with animals. Most of the 'island' footage looks like it was filmed in Griffith Park. Jackie Coogan's starring films were geared for both adult and child audiences, so the boy hero here is never in any real danger. The racial stereotyping in this movie is very distasteful, but not any more so than in many other films from this period ... and quite a few films from this time are much worse with it. Child actor Coogan shows real comedic talent, and I'll rate this movie 7 out of 10. Pass the coconuts!....£7.49\n\nLittle Toys aka Xiao Wanyi (1933)\n\nDirected by Sun Yu and starring Ruan Lingyu, this is a Chinese film with additional English intertitles. It has a runtime of 103 mins and the print quality is good.\n\nReview: Small Toys tells the story of a gifted artisan toy maker, played by Ruan Lingyu, who crafts small toys from clay and bamboo that her husband then sells in a nearby town. Ye's daughter, after the story moves forward ten years to 1931, is played by Li Lili, another famous actress in both silent and sound films. It is perhaps not the best film of either of these great Chinese actresses, but like many films from the period, are important for historical reasons as well as for mere entertainment value.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD Many catastrophes then strike one after the other: Ye's husband dies and her little son disappears, warlords destroy the village, cheap modern toys begin to outsell the handmade works Ye and her equally gifted daughter create. The family move then to the outskirts of Shanghai and the story moves forward ten years. In 1932, the Japanese attack Shanghai and bring further disaster to the family. Finally mistaking New Year firecrackers for bombs, Ye, driven to madness, urges those around her to take up arms against the imaginary enemies. SPOILERS END\n\nThis movie was made after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and these events play a pivotal role in the action as well as the spirit of the film, especially its frequent and undisguised nationalistic appeals, including one directly to the audience! As for the title, apart from indicating the nature of the main character's business, as the plot moves forward, it seems to suggest that the characters themselves are mere toys in the hands of Fateâ¦..£7.49\n\nLive Wire, The (1925)\n\nStarring Johnny Hines.
