I'm sorry, I have some question: I know, that pages about media, that contain only tanegashima matchlock are ineligible. But, the movie Azumi contain not only standart arquebuse, but also contain very rare, but realy historical exist Japanese matchlock revolver, so, I created the stub on discussion page: Talk:Azumi‎. May you visit it for it discussion about it's eligibility, please. Pyramid Silent (talk) 06:42, 17 January 2017 (EST)\n\nAzumi page on imdb.\n\nIt's absolutely revolving barrels gun (due the obvious reason, I can't upload screenshots with revolving moving, but, I uploaded two screenshots with different barrels position). And, this gun is the equipped with a pistolgrip and it's matchlock, due the typical hammer with a match (I don't know, is the word \"hammer\" correct for matchlock guns). Pyramid Silent (talk) 08:37, 17 January 2017 (EST)\n\nThanks! The gun on this photo seems much more similar. How do you think, is the term\"revolver\" correct, and may this page be eligible? Pyramid Silent (talk) 12:24, 17 January 2017 (EST)\n\nMany thanks! I changed the name to matchlock pepperbox. Pyramid Silent (talk) 13:04, 17 January 2017 (EST)\n\nNet help with ID\n\nHello, Greg-Z! I'm sorry, I have some request: may you help me to ID the pistol in the hands of Moldovan policeman in Fat. It's seem like variant of PM, but, it's not the standart Soviet or Russian model. Probably, it's some Moldovan produced variant. Pyramid Silent (talk) 07:30, 30 January 2017 (EST)\n\nPistol in Family Happiness (Semeynoe schastye)\n\nHello, Greg-Z! I'm sorry, I have some question. Maybe I'm wrong, but I notice one wrong ID in the page Family Happiness (Semeynoe schastye) and add it on the talk page. Pyramid Silent (talk) 18:47, 16 February 2017 (EST)\n\npistol in Midsomer Murders\n\nHello, Greg-Z! I'm sorry, I have some moment: at least one of the pistols in the gun shop in Midsomer Murders are clearly Wheellock and not Flintlock. Pyramid Silent (talk) 12:56, 2 March 2017 (EST)\n\nCheck my new page\n\nHello, Greg-Z! I'm sorry, I have some request: may you check my new page: Famous Brigands Stories: Václav Babinský? Pyramid Silent (talk) 07:54, 24 March 2017 (EDT)\n\nHello again! I'm sorry, I have another request: may you check my new page: another episode of the Brigands Stories: Famous Brigands Stories: Schinderhannes? Thanks! Pyramid Silent (talk) 12:16, 1 April 2017 (EDT)\n\nMany thanks for the help! Also, how do you think, is the Schinderhannes's father's rifle muzzleloaded or breach loaded? Pyramid Silent (talk) 17:03, 1 April 2017 (EDT)\n\nRE: Request for help\n\nWill do. I'll leave any notes/thoughts in the appropriate talk pages. StanTheMan (talk) 22:18, 5 April 2017 (EDT)\n\nTuretskiy gambit\n\nMany thanks for the help! I corrected the page and add two more missed pistols (Russian pecussion cap and flare gun). Pyramid Silent (talk) 18:12, 27 April 2017 (EDT)\n\nSome question about animation\n\nHello, Greg-Z! I'm sorry, I have have some question: as far, as I know, cartoonish animation are against the rules. However, some western animations (like Archer, The Adventures of Tintin, The Iron Giant, etc.) are allowed, due, it's depicted not cartoonish, but realistic guns. So, I have question to administration: is this animation (Russian feature movie \"Fortress. With Shield and Sword (Krepost. Shitom i mechom)\" rather realistic for exist or it's to cartoonish and ineligible. The examples of screenshots I uploads here. So, may I upload screenshots on discussion page to view it for Administrators. Pyramid Silent (talk) 05:06, 29 April 2017 (EDT)\n\nok, I removed the question. Pyramid Silent (talk) 06:50, 29 April 2017 (EDT)\n\nCheck my ID\n\nHello, Greg-Z! I'm sorry, I have some request: may you check my ID in Hidden (Skjult)? I found a promo shot, where this rifle is clearly seen. Thanks! Pyramid Silent (talk) 07:08, 6 May 2017 (EDT)\n\nI, also remade my old page Trackman (Putevoy Obhodchik). I uploaded a few more screenshots and reuploads low quality. May you also check it, please? Pyramid Silent (talk) 10:30, 6 May 2017 (EDT)\n\nMany thanks for the help! I corrected and renaming the page. Also, if it's not hard for you, may you upload image for Vladimir Naumov (I created actor page and director category, due he holds two different handguns in movie and directed three medias - two movies and one TV-series). Thanks! Pyramid Silent (talk) 10:27, 8 May 2017 (EDT)\n\nPicasso Trigger\n\nHi Greg, it is with great pleasure that I can inform you I just finished the Picasso Trigger page. I had some delay (almost a year...) but now finally the Andy Sidaris \"saga\" is completed. It's nothing new, most guns are the same, but as usual fun to watch. The unidentified gun pops up again, will make a discussion topic about that on the Main Page. Take care, PeeWee055 (talk) 10:31, 26 May 2017 (EDT)\n\nGlad you liked the page. I don't think the P08 Luger is really a target version, would be too expensive for Andy Sidaris. My best guess is that they used a Luger, the barrel broke during the movie shooting and they made a new barrel themselves but it turned out too big. Anything can be expected with an Andi Sidaris movie! PeeWee055 (talk) 04:48, 27 May 2017 (EDT)\n\nDifference between M1911 and M1911A1\n\nHello, Greg-Z! Excuseme, I have some request. I haven't exes to PC at this time. Somebody changes pistol in Sailor Moon from 1911 to 1911A1. May you check it: is this correct or not? Thanks! Pyramid Silent (talk) 16:54, 6 August 2017 (EDT)\n\nActor, who holds a single gun\n\nHello, Greg-Z! Excuseme, I have some question. I have seen, that existthe many pages of actors, who uses only a single gun in single movie. I shall haven't exes to PC for a few next day, so, I ask: may be exist the page for actor Lev Fenin, who playes in many various movies and avarded a USSR avard, but, in currently exist movie pages, he was seen used brifly a wheellock pistol in Minin and Pozharsky. Pyramid Silent (talk) 07:51, 10 August 2017 (EDT)\n\nMany thanks! I had created the page. Pyramid Silent (talk) 08:47, 10 August 2017 (EDT)\n\nSorry, yes, I know it, but on the all screenshots, when he holds a gun, his face isn't seen clear. Currently, I can't upload anothes screenshot. Pyramid Silent (talk) 09:09, 10 August 2017 (EDT)\n\nAndy Sidaris \"mystery\" pistol finally identified!\n\nHi Greg, you may remember that one 'mystery' pistol kept showing up in Andy Sidaris movies. Thanks to SeptemberJack it has now been identified as the Edison Giocattoli Sharkmatic, a 1970s Italian cap gun, sold as a toy at the time.\n\nI will revise the movie/actor pages in due course, and SeptemberJack is working on a Photoshop version of below image. By the way, thanks for updating actor pages for Picasso Trigger last week, it was on my ‘to-do’ list but I could not find the time yet. Will complete pages related to this movie in the coming weeks. Take care, PeeWee055 (talk) 14:55, 12 August 2017 (EDT)\n\nI just noticed you were informed separately of this gun a few days ago. I will go ahead anyway and if I see you have already sone some work, I will thank you :-) Take care, PeeWee055 (talk) 15:00, 12 August 2017 (EDT)\n\nHey Greg, could you please check the discussion page for 'Blank Fire Only Guns'? FunkyChinaman has removed the Edison Giocattoli Sharkmatic (Andy Sidaris mystery gun!) but I am asking him to put it back. Thanks for getting involved, PeeWee055 (talk) 04:47, 15 August 2017 (EDT)\n\nHelp in Wheels of Fire\n\nHello, Greg-Z! Excuse me, I have some request. I upload a few more screenshot for PPS-style submachine gun. How do you think, is it PPS or not. Also, this gun fired onscreen, so it's real gun and it's seems not mock up. Pyramid Silent (talk) 09:47, 16 August 2017 (EDT)\n\nUnidentified handguns in Dr. Mabuse, the gambler\n\nHi,Greg-Z!Look, I recently started working on this page, and I couldn't identify 2 revolvers which aren't seen so well(the movie is an old B&W). I suggested what could they be, but can you ,please, help me?--VLAD M (talk) 11:19, 6 September 2017 (EDT)\n\nMusket in Chato's Land\n\nHello, Greg-Z! Excuse me, I have some guess about musket in Chato's Land. I think, that's actualy not a musket, but a Remington 1863 Zouave.\n\nThe only differ is the little short gun leight, but it's may be just visual illusion or carbine version of the gun. Pyramid Silent (talk) 08:24, 7 September 2017 (EDT)\n\nThis version are more shorter? Pyramid Silent (talk) 09:49, 7 September 2017 (EDT)\n\nRE: Redirects\n\nThing is only admins have the ability to do so, since it goes more or less under the same principle of deletion. --Ultimate94ninja (talk) 15:37, 15 September 2017 (EDT)\n\nCustom Nagant\n\nHello, Greg-Z! I create a photoshopped image of the custom Nagant M1895, that appeared in the Sheriff's Star (Zvezda sherifa), New Adventures of a Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Fantasy Over Mark Twain's Theme (Novye priklyucheniya yanki pri dvore korolya Artura), Killer's Wedge (Sposob ubiystva) and Four Sheets of Plywood (Chotyry lysty fanery). What do you think about that? Pyramid Silent (talk) 14:05, 26 September 2017 (EDT)\n\nNo, I had used Photoshop, but, the sourced screenshots from Chotyry lysty fanery and Novye priklyucheniya yanki are slightly blured and fuzzy. The only good quality is the grip from Sposob ubiystva. Pyramid Silent (talk) 14:15, 26 September 2017 (EDT)\n\nThanks! I also add gun image for the musket in Chato's Land. Pyramid Silent (talk) 14:26, 26 September 2017 (EDT)\n\nHelp to check the ID of the pistol\n\nHello, Greg-Z! Excuse me, I have some request: may yopu check the ID of the pistol in the old Soviet movie. At first, I thought, that's Broqua & Scholberg Marked .44 Russian Single Shot Pistol, but, maybe it's wrong and it's Auguste Francotte Pistolet de Tir de Salon pistol, which appers in at lest two soviet movies. How do you think, is the my ID correct? Pyramid Silent (talk) 14:54, 6 October 2017 (EDT)\n\nOh, sorry, I found old disscussion about it. Also, how do you think, is it usefull, to create a gun page for Auguste Francotte Pistolet de Tir de Salon pistol, which appeared at lest in two movies and one actors is ID? Pyramid Silent (talk) 15:49, 6 October 2017 (EDT)\n\nRE: Rifle category\n\nI wouldn't be so sure about that regarding the Volkssturmgewehr, since its round isn't as heavy-hitting as that of battle rifles; I think it would just qualify as a service rifle. As for the other rifles that you mentioned, they fire full-sized rounds, so maybe you're right. Since you know about these more than I do, I'll leave the changes up to you. --Ultimate94ninja (talk) 10:06, 23 October 2017 (EDT)\n\nRequest to same help with ID\n\nHello, Greg-Z! Exquse me, I have some request: may you help me with ID the rifle in the Lorna Doone. It's seems to be not a muzzleloaded gun. May it be the Chassepot 1866. Also, I have some question about Treasure Island (Ostrov sokrovishch) (1971) (I'm absolutely not sure in my guess, so, I only wrote it on disscussion page). Pyramid Silent (talk) 12:26, 25 October 2017 (EDT)\n\nMany thanks! Pyramid Silent (talk) 14:45, 25 October 2017 (EDT)\n\nAlso, after more close watching on screenshots, I have to more guess {about several mocked up muskets and pistol). Pyramid Silent (talk) 19:52, 27 October 2017 (EDT)\n\nRe: e-mail\n\nI send a test letter. Pyramid Silent (talk) 20:14, 3 November 2017 (EDT)\n\nRE: Le Deuxième Souffle\n\nFrom what I've seen on IMFDB, yeah, we usually sort the weapons by name in their particular sections (an admin has been insisting on that, at least on video games pages), but to be honest I'm not sure if it's a rule that always needs to be applied to all pages (the order of significance does make sense). And yeah sure, I'll upload additional screenshots later (I don't have the film with me right now).\n\nBy the way, while we're at it, could you weigh in on the discussion for Rien à déclarer that we started months ago, in case you're able to correctly identify the particular weapons seen in the screencaps? Thanks.\n\n--Ultimate94ninja (talk) 04:56, 2 December 2017 (EST)\n\nI don't think so. It appears to have a dark finish like the Smith & Wesson Model 13 (I just re-watched the scene, and based on the lighting, I don't think it's supposed to be a stainless steel version tricking us into thinking otherwise), but at the same time it has a heavy barrel (similar to that of the 65-5 Ladysmith), which I'm not sure if it's available to the Model 13. --Ultimate94ninja (talk) 12:21, 5 December 2017 (EST)\n\nThanks\n\nI'd forgotten about those, yes. Evil Tim (talk) 14:09, 2 December 2017 (EST)\n\nHelp to ID the autocannons and military veachles\n\nHello, Greg-Z! Excuse me, I have some request: may you help me to ID the autocannons and military veachles in the Girls' Last Tour? Sorry, that's anime page, but, it's seems, that several of the autocannons and veachles are seems to be drawn rather realistic. So, if it possible, may you help me with ID? Thanks! Pyramid Silent (talk) 15:14, 13 January 2018 (EST)\n\nMany thanks for the help! I corrected the page. Pyramid Silent (talk) 04:51, 14 January 2018 (EST)\n\nA strange question about actor's page\n\nHello, Greg-Z! Excuse me, I have some question: if the page for an actor are eligibly, due his characters can be seen with two different types of firearms in two different movies, but had nopthing known about any detiles of his life (most likely, the only information, that currently known about him is the actor's credites in the movies endings), may I add it to actor's page, or it's useless information? Pyramid Silent (talk) 13:16, 24 January 2018 (EST)\n\nRE:\n\nDefinitely not an FR F1; this shot is pretty telling of that, not to mention the different handguard as well. It does seem like a MAS-36 to me, though a custom variant (also, is that really a suppressor on it, or some kind of compensator?)\n\nBy the way, confirm with me, are these two revolvers a S&W Model 65-5 Ladysmith and an MR-73 respectively? (and here, the one below the MAC Mle 1950, do you think it's a S&W Model 27?) As for this one, do you have any idea about its ID?\n\n--Ultimate94ninja (talk) 14:04, 1 February 2018 (EST)\n\nThanks. Regarding the Revolver-4, after checking again, it seems that not all the Model 65-5 revolvers are stainless steel, so maybe you're right. At the same time though, I looked up some images of the dark finish Model 13, and some variants actually have a heavy barrel like in the weapon in the movie (I think it's the case for at least the Model 13-4). What do you think, should we go for 65-5 or 13?\n\n(Also btw, in regards to this discussion, the actual classification would be handheld heavy machine gun, eh?)\n\n--Ultimate94ninja (talk) 15:41, 1 February 2018 (EST)\n\nRequest for a help\n\nHello, Greg-Z! Excuse me, I have some request: may you help me with ID the armored car in The Bomb (Bomba) (it's Uzbek movie, so, it's may be Uzbek made veachle). Also, now, I working on the large page Suicides (Samoubiytsy) and have some other request: althought, most firearms are clearly ID, please, if it's not hard may you check my ID. Thanks! Pyramid Silent (talk) 18:02, 19 February 2018 (EST)\n\nMany thanks for the help! Now, I complited both pages. How do you think, is the all correct now? Pyramid Silent (talk) 14:20, 20 February 2018 (EST)\n\nMaybe, I'm wrong, but the Tommy gun can be seen fired onscreen (I uploaded a few more screenshots). I had corrected several misspellings in English, later, I shall trying to find more. Pyramid Silent (talk) 15:22, 20 February 2018 (EST)\n\nSome guess about a character in the Min-Series\n\nHello, Greg-Z! Exuse me, I have some question: is the character (at the left) holds any guns in the TV-series Here Lies the Border (Zdes prokhodit granitsa). His name is Khislyat and he was played by actor Utkur Khodzhayev, who also appeared in the movie The Seventh Bullet (Sedmaya pulya), when he also holds a firearms. So, if he holds a firearm in this TV-sries, the actor may have his own page. Pyramid Silent (talk) 19:53, 16 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nMany thanks. Also, how do you think, is the my IDs in the Nails (Gvozdi) correct? Pyramid Silent (talk) 12:19, 17 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nMany thanks! I shall try to find some toy revolvers with those reeces/ Also, how do you think, is the unknown shotgun the same model as the another one, or, it's different? Pyramid Silent (talk) 15:18, 17 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nSorry for the (possibly) wrong ID advice\n\nHello, Greg-Z! Once upon a time, I thought, that the Muskets in the Cuba are wheellocks. But, now, I think, that I was wrong: I found some much more close images (source) of the similar guns, and it's a Snaphaunce lock Moukhala Musket. Sorry for the wrong ID advice :( Pyramid Silent (talk) 15:42, 29 April 2018 (EDT)\n\nSMG in Caution! Red Mercury! (Oberezhno! Chervona rtut!)‎\n\nHello, Greg-Z! Many thanks for the fixing my wrong ID. I had upload a few more photoshoped screenshot and have another guess: Talk:Caution! Red Mercury! (Oberezhno! Chervona rtut!)‎. What do you think about it? Pyramid Silent (talk) 15:50, 1 May 2018 (EDT)\n\nSome question\n\nHello, Greg-Z! Excuse me, I have some request: how do you think, is the all ID in my new page The Wild East correct? Pyramid Silent (talk) 11:36, 6 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nThanks a lot! About those misspellings - I shall correct its at the near future. Pyramid Silent (talk) 16:27, 6 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nMy guess about percussion muskets in Pyramid of the Sun God (Die Pyramide des Sonnengottes) and Treasure of the Aztecs (Der Schatz der Azteken)\n\nHello, Greg-Z! I have some guess about percussion meskets in the movies Pyramid of the Sun God (Die Pyramide des Sonnengottes), Treasure of the Aztecs (Der Schatz der Azteken). Maybe, it's just for me, but this short carbines are similar that also can be seen in the Chato's Land, while this long musket are similar to full leight Remington 1863 Zouave. For comprassion:\n\nMaybe, I'm wrong. Pyramid Silent (talk) 13:17, 15 June 2018 (EDT)\n\nI also guess, that this rifle in the movie Apaches (Apachen) are flintlock:\n\nHelp with my pages\n\nHello, Greg-Z! I am glad to Your returning! Many thanks for the help with my pages. Excuse me, I have some request: may you also check the pages Biker (Bayker) and Treasures of the Twelve Gods (Sokrovishcha dvenadthati bogov)? Also, currently, I'm not absolutely sure about ID FN Browning Hi-Power Silver Chrome and Combat Planess. How do you think, is this ID correct? Pyramid Silent (talk) 09:17, 6 July 2018 (EDT)\n\nMany thanks! I shall correct it, after having access to PC (I'm currently not in the Moscow). Also, I had created a page for actor Karl Gurnyak. I guess, that he holds a guns in two different movie (kino-teatr.ru helped me), but, I didn't watch it's, so, I have a question: is the information on actor's page correct? Pyramid Silent (talk) 16:22, 6 July 2018 (EDT)\n\nHow do you think, is this two actors page correct?\n\nHello, Greg-Z! Excuse me, I have some question: I created two actors pages Nina Zorskaya and Vasili Novikov, both appeared in Boyevoy kinosbornik series, due they also holds firearms in another movie. But, I didn't watch any of the Boyevoy kinosbornik movies, so, may you check - is this pages correct?

About the musket, it seems to be well worn, due the smoke from the lock during the shoting, which means to partly damaged hammer (the result of a lot of shots). This movie is a Cuban produced/filmed, so, it's possibly the old American gun.

As for the Derringers, I'm not sure. Perhaps we could create a \"Derringer\" disambiguation/broad-spectrum page, sorta like 22 LR Pump Action Rifles or Bolt Action Rifles - Most common Sporting Models. Does that sound like a good idea?

Excuse me, I havesome request: may you help me with ID some AK rifle in the Republic Z (Respublika Z). At first, I think, that's AK-12, but, it's seems wrong guess. Thanks Pyramid Silent (talk) 14:16, 5 March 2019 (EST)\n\nA great thanks! How do you think, is I should create a new gun page, or just create a new section in currently exist gun page? Pyramid Silent (talk) 15:06, 9 March 2019 (EST)\n\nActually, it's not a Saiga MK-107 either; note how the gas block is different. My guess is that it's a modified AK-105 (in fact, the setup in the movie has a lot in common with this Airsoft version). As for the MK-107 image, it just belongs to the talk page of the AK-74, since it's a civilian version of the AK-107. --Ultimate94ninja (talk) 16:49, 9 March 2019 (EST)\n\nAK-104\n\nHi, I'd like to ask, could you remove the protection of the AK-104 image? I'm pretty sure it's not a genuine one, primarily since it is shown with a solid trunnion rather than a stepped one, and thus I'd like to replace it with a good quality image that I have ready (and that also has the smooth side/low drag magazine typically used on the weapon). --Ultimate94ninja (talk) 17:31, 16 March 2019 (EDT)\n\nAppreciated, thanks! --Ultimate94ninja (talk) 13:43, 17 March 2019 (EDT)\n\nApologies\n\nApologies.

In the case of Port, there are other movies such as this one and this one, but yes, you do have a point about the fact that they don't have pages on IMFDB right now. Due to this, I'm not sure what's the most appropriate action, so I guess it's your call. --Ultimate94ninja (talk) 11:51, 28 April 2019 (EDT)\n\nMany thanks!\n\nHello, Greg-Z!

Excuse me, I have several questions: At the page The Shore of Salvation (Bereg spaseniya) for the brigands hired by the Grave Robber often uses word \"Такультаны\", but, I hadn't found any other appearance of this word, so I had used term \"mercenaries\", but, I'm not sure if it's correct. Also, how do You think, is the ID of this page is correct? A second question about first rifle in Slave Coast (Cobra Verde): I guess, it's a small-caliber, bolt action rifle with a strange wooden ring on the buttstock. I had never seen any rifles with such wooden ring. How do you think, what it's can been. Pyramid Silent (talk) 09:15, 1 May 2020 (EDT)\n\nA great thanks! About first rifle in \"Cobra Verde\" - it can be seen firing, but only in distance. While the muzzle flash and smoke can be seen, it wasn't seen clear at this moment, theoretically it's maybe different rifle. Also, I had correct the ID of several Single barreled shotguns, which is wrongly among percussion shotguns section.

I haven't had access to the computer I originally played it on for a long while now, and I would still like to make screenshots of the game in 4:3 aspect ratio (since the game is that old). I would like to think I'd get to completing the game's page eventually, but can we compromise and change the page to \"Incomplete\" for now? --Mazryonh (talk) 20:13, 11 May 2020 (EDT)\n\nThanks for changing the status of the page. As a Russian yourself, do you like video games focusing on Russian history, such as the Death to Spies series, Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad, etc.? --Mazryonh (talk) 09:53, 12 May 2020 (EDT)\n\nWIP to complete\n\nI understand you're trying to reduce the number of WIPs, but rather than changing them to complete, it might be safer to change them to incomplete. Formatting is one thing, but unless you've seen the movie, you can't be sure everything has been covered. --Funkychinaman (talk) 09:54, 12 May 2020 (EDT)\n\nUpdating the \"Sluga gosudarev\"\n\nHello, Greg-Z! I'm sorry, that I forgot to add this weapon at the page. But, just now, I have living in the village due the quarantine of COVID-19 pandemy in Moscow, so, I havent only old NOKIA mobile phone, not PC, noteboock etc. So, just now, I absolutely cann't create a screenshots or even watch any movie, but, right after returning to Moscow, I shall rewatch this movie and apdate the page. Pyramid Silent (talk) 08:19, 18 May 2020 (EDT)\n\nI did it. This page is improved by the better quality screenshots and adding some previously missed weapons, include the percussion hand mortars.

Excuse me, I have some request: in the movie Samurai Avenger: The Blind Wolf appeared some rather strange variant of Kar98 rifle. It's generally resembles Kriegsmodell, but has a groove on the stock, non-standard longer cleaning rod and elongated front part (between barrel band and muzzle). I guess, that's some rare variant of Kar98, but I don't know much about this rifle. So, how do you think, what is this variant. Thanks!

Should a template be created for this? Maybe I'll get more parts of this series in the future or someone else. And yes, the film series is worth watching, some kind of British humor in a different way.\n\nQuestion: May I also create templates, so do I have the permission to do this?

Similarly, it is a pity the pictures of Sigourney Weaver from the movie Rakka.--Pandolfini (talk) 05:04, 9 December 2020 (EST)\n\nAstra 900/C96 in Sedmoy sputnik and other Lenfilm films\n\nI recently re-identified one of the C96-type firearms in the Russian film Sedmoy sputnik from an Astra 900 to a standard Mauser C96. My observation is that the right side of the movie gun lacks the screws common to the Astra C96-type pistols, and instead has indentations similar to some of the later Mauser C96-type pistols.\n\nHowever, I currently have an issue after this re-identification: The page originally claimed that the film pistol has a \"typical outline of the front part\" that allows it to be identified as an Astra 900 rather than a Mauser C96. In our pages on a number of other Lensfilm movies (for example, Zhizn Klima Samgina), this reasoning is also used to identify C96-like pistols as Astra 900s. I'm unsure of what exactly is this \"outline\". I would suggest reevaluating all the other Astra 900 identifications, but I'm unsure because I could not find any specific C96-like features on the screenshots we have of those movies. --Wuzh (talk) 03:53, 15 December 2020 (EST)\n\nAbout Nachalnik Chukotki, the Astra 900 identification is fairly reliable; you can see in this image the distinctive Astra \"plate\" on the left side of the pistol frame. About all the other Lensfilm movies, do you have links to the forum.guns.ru discussion posts? There might be some better screenshots on there that I can use to improve my identification of the pistols. --Wuzh (talk) 03:07, 18 December 2020 (EST)\n\nSounds reasonable. In the absence of more detailed screenshots these are the best of what we can do now. --Wuzh (talk) 12:21, 21 January 2021 (EST)\n\nRE: National Film Registry\n\nI used this article.

So, feel free to create them.\n\nHowever, I have access to the 1931 The Squeaker / Der Zinker, which I might want to create later--HighPhigh (talk) 09:58, 18 February 2021 (EST)\n\nNobody (2021)\n\nJust an FYI that I'm re-starting the page, this time with screenshots. Noticed you had deleted it yesterday for being empty\n\nVigor\n\nI am resuming work on the page after I saw the deletion message, I can get screenshots over the next few days and have them on the page, replacing the old, low-res ones I hastily brought back from a few months ago. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the game, there is no easy way for me to get some of the weapons, besides playing for hours everyday, which I don't have time for, so proper ADS/reloading screenshots will take a while for some of the rarer guns. --JackalUnderscore (talk) 05:23, 18 August 2021 (EDT)\n\nNaming\n\nHello, Thanks for letting me know this. I committed the same error for The Private Eyes. The movie category listings have both movies listed inappropriately starting with \"The\".

LJ (talk) 17:16, 12 September 2021 (EDT)\n\nAttention\n\nI uh... brought stuff to your attention. Ominae (talk) 11:02, 15 September 2021 (EDT)\n\nSeveral actors for gun wielding characters\n\nI hadn't watch the Snow and Ashes (Sneg i pepel), but, according the screenshots from this site, several more actors, that played the gun wielding characters can be ID: Vldimir Yudin, Artyom Potylitsin, Andrey Polishchuk. Maybe more. Pyramid Silent (talk) 11:34, 21 September 2021 (EDT)\n\nMaybe, I'm wrong, but both characters on this screenshots are carring guns: the left one carries some kind of rifle, while the right one carries a holstered handgun. One of them is Dedukh and played by Andrey Polishchuk, however, I don't know, who is Dedukh of them two. So, if the exact character will be IDed, it's possible to add the character-gun info to actor's page. Pyramid Silent (talk) 14:45, 21 September 2021 (EDT)\n\nI understand. As I said, I hadn't watch this movie, so, I can't say any guess about adding or not adding this information to Andrey Polishchuk page.

That said, personally I think these national produced categories are too extraneous and just extra work we shouldn't have to add anyway. But that's me. Again right now simply a case of removing links that go nowhere. StanTheMan (talk) 21:04, 22 September 2021 (EDT)\n\nNo worries at all, life happens. Take 'er easy.

Pyramid Silent (talk) 16:22, 18 October 2021 (EDT)\n\nLittle warning\n\nHey, it's me, TrickShotFinn. Although I've been off IMFDB, I've come to warn about potential acts of vandalism in near future. I hope you pass this information to other admins:\n\nI've gotten in a fisticuffs at the Wikipedia-Wikipedia. There's this editor from Pennsylvania using a the handle Jacee215 who may have made things personal . This results from a back-and-forth between me and him, regarding Russian Sambo & Shoot Wrestling legend Volk Han. He has gotten in trouble with Wikipedia's admins and may be banned soon. However, there is a fair risk that he will come here to do some vandalism, as my Wikipedia profile mentions that I have done stuff here (at IMFDB).\n\nSo, If there is some weirdo who deletes large chunks of pages here connected to entries I've done, it might be him. If you confront him in talk, the ways to tell him is his writing style, as he alters writing style between responses - sometimes using good grammar, capitalization and punctuation and then with random capitalization and punctuation, with lots of unnecessary/clumsy spacing. He will often also fail to use a signature. There is also chance that he will start using eugenics and philosophy-based insults for those who defy him. Also if he makes mention of any Japanese Pro Wrestlers, MMA fighters or non-Japanese guys fighting Japan (esp. Volk Han) - it's him.\n\nWhen confronting him, appeal to policy and be concise and decisive with him. Do not - I repeat - do not get in arguments with this guy. He might appear like some punk kid who might \"try to do the right thing the wrong way\" - but he is a real stubborn piece of work who will exploit your goodwill. I might sound bit overt - I admit that - but I had to wrestle with this brat for like four months before he crossed the admins and I advise caution if he comes here. This is level of a problem that had to be brought to Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents at the Wikipedia. -- TrickShotFinn (talk) 12:10, 19 November 2021 (EST)\n\nScreenshot tag for promo photos\n\nHi Greg.

I started a research a time ago due to the Mausers on the pages Joyeux Noël and March of Millions and I found out that the M98/22 actually has a parade hook as well since it has a parade sling attachment. It could be that the M98/22 in Turkish service got the parade hook removed, but that is only a guess. Here is a Czech website as an example.\n\nThe Steyr-Mauser 1912 looks very identical to the M98/22 because the newly established Czechoslovakia Republic took over many of them and these served as a model together with the Gewehr 1898. So, I think, an unmodified Steyr-Mauser is rare nowadays. I uploaded this picture back then to show the similarities between the two versions. I hope you understand what I mean. Let me know if you have any doubts about it.--HighPhigh (talk) 01:37, 24 January 2022 (EST)\n\nThe Magnificent Kotobuki\n\nHello! Many thanks for the help with ID in The Magnificent Kotobuki.

Solarriors (talk) 21:33, 4 Jan 2022 (CET)\n\nRifle in Father Brown\n\nWell, first of all, thank you for thinking of me in this regard and second, as you already described on the page, the rifle is not seen in detail, but I would support your (very good) guess.\n\nSince I don't know much about the Mauser-Vergueiro (heard and seen before yes, but otherwise...), I looked it up and found some pictures of the front sight which confirms this precisely: No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3. I hope this may help you with this issue.--HighPhigh (talk) 09:45, 18 February 2022 (EST)\n\nExactly! It's a strange mixture. I'm a bit curious how they got it. Anyway, until next time! :) --HighPhigh (talk) 13:17, 19 February 2022 (EST)\n\nRE: One more curious flintlock pistol\n\nYeah, it looks like it could be Mle 1733, clearly it doesn't have the typical British lock plate. Though there is something I have never seen on any plate of this style, a bolt or something in the middle of the plate. Maybe an attachment point for a belt hook? --Nanomat (talk) 22:19, 7 March 2022 (EST)\n\nSawyer's pistols in Hornblower: Mutiny indeed seem to be dueling guns. I also spent some time researching this and it turns out this is a common design for dueling pistols made by various makers, however, I also didn't manage to find an example with swivel ramrod and/or belt hook. ID-ing them just as dueling pistols should do for now. --Nanomat (talk) 22:14, 8 March 2022 (EST)\n\nNah, the flintlock Charles Moore has a different trigger guard extension compared to the Hornblower gun. The Hawken also has different trigger guard and ramrod slot. Look for some dueling gun with a trigger guard styled like the Hornblower gun, if we manage to find a maker who made this particular design then we could solve it. --Nanomat (talk) 20:52, 9 March 2022 (EST)\n\nRE: [edit] Categorization of images\n\nGot it, thanks Greg-Z! (talk)\n\nReopening Watch_Dogs: Legion's page\n\nIt says \"page was noeffort\". The person who made it should have added more screenshots, but to me it had everything else a page would need, it had explanations of how the weapons functioned in game, it included every weapon in game, had an overview section, was formatted perfectly, grammar and spelling were all fine.\n\nI'd like to reopen the page. If I post in game screenshots of the rest of the weapons, and use the pre-existing version in the discussion section, would that be up to IMFDB standards? Cause other than missing screenshots, I'd want to know what, if anything, else was wrong with it before I reopen it.--U7355608 (talk) 21:31, 27 May 2022 (EDT)\n\nKeep me logged in\n\nCan you try specifically going to the https://www.imfdb.org version of the site? You have to type it in manually in the search bar, you'll know you have it because the you'll see a lock in url bar. For me that keeps me logged in on Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. If you have restrictive cookie settings or a cookie blocker that might also be logging you out. We'll move to a 100% https site for everyone next week. --bunni (talk) 16:26, 4 September 2022 (UTC)\n\nIf you click the Random page link does it take you to a https version with a lock in the url bar or a http version with a broken lock? For me I don't get a redirect if I manually type https in the url bar and Random page sends me to https with a lock in the url bar. If Random page doesn't send you to https then you may have a 'preferHTTP' cookie that keeps redirecting you to http, you could try clearing cookies in your browser for imfdb. In Firefox if I click the lock there's a dropdown for 'Clear cookies and site data...' --bunni (talk) 17:07, 4 September 2022 (UTC)\n\n:Broken titles"
