Miss Shirley Mason, shines as an\n\nuufortunate victim of ?circumstances, At\n\nthe afternoon and evening sessions vocal\n\nnumbers are rendered by lv. Irvan Yvain.\n\nReviews and gazettes are' screened, - and\n\n?West's Viceregal Orchestra contributes\n\nfirst-class music, under the baton of Mr.\n\nJames Wilton."
