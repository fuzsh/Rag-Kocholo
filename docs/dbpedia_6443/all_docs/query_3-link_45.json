        "text": "This vintage photograph features American stage and film actress, Kathleen Clifford (1887-1962). The IMDb credits her with 14 film credits between 1917 and 1932. She is known for “Richard the Lion-Hearted (1923)”, When the Clouds Roll by (1919)”, and “Who is Number One? (1917)”. She often played leading roles in her films for Paramount. During her film career, she worked alongside Douglas Fairbanks Sr., Betty Compson, and Wallace Beery. She appeared on the Broadway stage six times between 1909 and 1916. Clifford was famous as a Vaudeville comedienne and male impersonator. She was billed as “The Smartest Chap in Town”. At one point in her vaudeville career, she worked as a duo with female impersonator, Bothwell Browne. Like many movie performers, she left acting with the advent of sound films. During the early years of World War I, she served as a Red Cross Nurse with the British Army in France. Upon retirement, she became a business woman and owned “Broadway Florist” in Hollywood. Clifford also wrote a novel about her time in Hollywood. She was married to Miomir Peter Illitch for over 35 years. He was a banker. This original photographic portrait of Kathleen Clifford was taken by a highly talented and esteemed American photographer, Fred Hartsook (1876-1930). He owned a California studio chain that, at that time, was considered to be the largest photographic business in the world. His celebrity clients included President Woodrow Wilson, Henry Ford, Mary Pickford, and Charles Lindbergh. He also owned a resort and two ranches in Southern California where he raised Holstein cattle. He was married to Bess Hesby, queen of the San Francisco Pan-Pacific Exposition of 1915. SOLD\n\nPOSTCARD 1 (SOLD)\n\nPOSTCARD 2\n\nPOSTCARD 2 (CLOSE-UP)\n\nPostcard 1 is a hand tinted vintage real photo postcard that features Madge Bellamy (1899-1990), an American stage and film actress. She was a popular leading lady in films of the 1920’s and 1930’s. The sound era put the brakes on her career and a romantic scandal in the 1940’s brought it to a total stop. Madge was a Texan. She was born in Hillsboro and was raised in San Antonio and Brownwood. Her father was an English professor at Texas A&M University. As a young child she took dancing lessons but soon, she was interested in becoming an actress. At age 9, she made her stage debut in “Aida”. She and her family moved to Denver, Colorado. She met Carlos Bellamy there and the two married. When Madge decided to leave the state to pursue acting, her marriage ended. Madge went to New York City and worked on Broadway as a dancer. In 1919, she replaced Helen Hayes in Broadway’s “Dear Brutus”, opposite actor, William Gillette. Her career took off thereafter. In 1920, Madge appeared in her first film as a supporting actress to Geraldine Farrar. She then signed a contract with the Triangle Film Corporation. Her “breakout role” was as the title character in Lorna Doone (1922). In 1924 she signed a film contract with Fox Film Corporation. She stayed there five years and during that time she appeared in two films for film director, John Ford. In 1925, she began to have difficulties with fox executives. In 1928, she appeared in Fox’s first talking film, “Mother Knows Best”. In 1928, she married for a second time. The marriage lasted 3 days before she and her husband separated. By 1929, Bellamy’s career entered a tail-spin. She had made poor choices out of her unbridled anger. Fan magazines gave her the nickname of “Miss Firecracker” due to her temperament. In 1929, she also quit her contract with Fox, right after they bought the rights to make a film out of Broadway play. The vehicle was bought with a plan to have Madge be it’s star. Bellamy later admitted she quit over money and added “I got too big for my britches”. She didn’t work again until 1932. She accepted roles in “Poverty Row” (B-movies) films. One of these films was “White Zombie” (1932) in which she appeared opposite Bela Lugosi. Her performance received many poor reviews from film critics. By 1940, Madge basically had no film career. However, she wasn’t done with drama. She was arrested after firing three shots from a .32 caliber revolver at her former lover of five years. The incident was premeditated. She was angry at her intended victim because he married a model shortly after ending their affair. Fortunately, her aim was poor and she missed. The only casualty was her ex boyfriend’s car which took a couple of shots into it’s body. Bellamy pleaded guilty to a lesser charge (violating gun laws), and received a suspended six month sentence and probation. Madge Bellamy’s IMDb filmography reports 61 credits between 1920 and 1945. This vintage postcard is provocative. This postcard is risque for it’s era. She is showing a lot of bare skin. The postcard was published while Madge was under contract with Fox. Therefore, the postcard is from before 1929. The card was published by J. Beagles and is part of the “Famous Cinema Star Series” (No.210P). (SOLD)\n\nPostcard 2 offers another risque view of Madge Bellamy. Her alluring pose and short skirt qualifies this postcard to be considered provocative. This card was produced while Madge was under contract with Fox Films, sometime before 1929. This postcard was published by Ross Verlag as part of a series (No.3907/2). The postcard is in very good condition (see scans).\n\nBuy this original Vintage Real Photo Postcard (includes shipping within the US) #7386\n\nTo purchase this item, click on the Pay with PayPal button below\n\n$24.00\n\nBuy this original Vintage Real Photo Postcard (includes International shipping outside the US) #7386\n\nTo purchase this item, click on the Pay with PayPal button below\n\n$34.00\n\nPOSTCARD 1\n\nPOSTCARD 2\n\nThis vintage real photo postcard features acclaimed theater actress, Miss Ellaline Terriss (1871-1971). Ellaline Terriss was a British actress and singer who was active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Ellaline was the daughter of leading actor William Terriss. He was murdered in 1897 by a deranged actor. She began her acting career in the 1880s. She was best known for her roles in musical comedies and her performances in popular shows such as “The Shop Girl” (1895) and “The Circus Girl” (1896). Terriss was also a talented singer, and her beautiful voice and charming personality made her a popular figure on the London stage. She was considered one of the leading actresses of her day and was known for her versatility, grace, and style. Throughout her career, Terriss appeared in numerous productions in London and on tour in Britain and the United States. She was also the wife of actor and producer, Seymour Hicks, who was a leading man in his own right. She continued to perform and was a prominent figure in the theatrical world until her retirement in the 1920s. Toward the end of her career, Terriss appeared in silent films and made a successful transition into talkies. This cabinet card portrait was taken by celebrated photographer Napoleon Sarony. He was based in New York City. A hand stamp on the reverse of the photograph identifies Siegel-Cooper Company. This firm was a department store in Chicago, Illinois. The store had it’s own photo studio and one wonders if this photograph was an item for sale within that studio.

Next stop was New York, where she appeared in four Broadway plays between 1911 and 1915. Shortly after her last Broadway appearance, Wehlen left the stage and pursued a film career. She appeared in over twenty films between 1915 and 1920. “Everybody’s Magazine (1911) reported that Wehlen was very pretty and very graceful. Her acting and voice were also praised. In addition, the article stated that “she has the indescribable charm of personality” and that audiences liked her and wanted her to never leave the stage during a production. Miss Wehlen’s photograph on this postcard was taken by celebrity studio, Foulsham & Banfield. The card was published by Rotary Photo as part of a series (no.11717H).\n\nIn Postcard 2, Wehlen is beautifully dressed for the portrait appearing on the postcard.

The card was published by EAS as part of a series (no.1868/2). The firm was located in London and New York. The postcard was printed in Germany. Interestingly, the word “imperfect” is printed in two places on the front of the card. The word “chic” appears in the upper right hand corner of the image. Emmy Wehlen fits the bill. She is truly chic. The message on the postcard indicates that it was written in 1913.

She was known for her vivacious energy, mesmerizing on-screen presence, and her impressive talent. She was born in Brooklyn, New York and grew up in the borough’s tenements.
