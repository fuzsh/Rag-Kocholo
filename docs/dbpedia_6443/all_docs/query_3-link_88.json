        "text": "A Brief History of Photoplay Editions\n\nPublishers have noted for hundreds of years that illustrations enhance their printed words, in that the reader can relate to the artist's rendition along with the author's mental imagery. With the advent of photography, publishing houses recognized the further clarity that the photo could provide and, in the late 1800s, the first true \"Photo-Play editions\" were produced.\n\nPlays or novelizations of plays were illustrated with photos of the play's \"first run\". These early \"play\" tie-in books were primarily published by Grosset and Dunlap. The peak years were 1900-1915; the format dwindled in numbers thereafter. \"Play\" Tie-In books were revitalized as recently as the early 1960s through an attractive series published by Random House and featuring many Hollywood notables. There are over 100 titles in this format published before the advent of feature films. These photoplays deserve special mention as they were the natural predecessors to the Movie Tie-In book. Grosset and Dunlap even advertised these books as \"dramatized novels\".\n\n\"Play\" Tie-In books were revitalized as recently as the early 1940s through an attractive long running series published by Random House and featuring many current and future Hollywood notables. Many Random House plays are true first editions and some were subtitled Fireside Theater Book Club Editions.\n\nWith the emergence of more lengthy productions in the movie industry, the term \"photoplay\" took on a new meaning. Now the public could see a production on the movie screen as opposed to the theater stage and \"photoplay\" became synonymous with today's concept of \"feature film\". The popularity of a movie fan magazine Photoplay (1911-1980) only added to the connection of this term to films.\n\nThe appearance of the first MTI is a matter of speculation. The publisher Edward J. Clode produced in 1913, the first crossover tie-in. This edition of What Happened to Mary contained stills from both the stage and movie versions. The serial movie of this MTI was released in 1912. Grosset and Dunlap (undated) reprinted this title close to the 1913 date and this reprint may have been their first, in relation to Grosset & Dunlap reprinting an existing book, as an MTI.\n\nThe earliest known United Kingdom film as an MTI is an undated (possibly as late as 1920s publication) edition by Greening, for the 1913 United Kingdom production entitled A Message to Mars. This title will also be contending for the earliest fantasy / sci-fi entry. The stills depicting Martians are a far cry from the special effects of today's movie industry.\n\nSerial films were predominant in the early MTIs. The movie going audience desire to know the outcome of those \"to be continued\" cliff hangers, before the next episode appeared in the theatre, probably accounted for good sales. Bobbs Merrill Co. published the MTI of The Adventures of Kathlyn (1913) in 1914 and was promptly reprinted by Grosset and Dunlap with additional stills. Hearst International published MTIs of the serials Perils of Pauline (1914), Exploits of Elaine (1915) and Romance of Elaine (1916). The Hearst books were issued in the United Kingdom by Hodder & Stoughton though not illustrated with stills, all are quite scarce.\n\nGrosset and Dunlap continued its output with The Million Dollar Mystery, The Trey of Hearts and The Master Key, all arriving in 1914. The serials were the first movie novelizations as other MTIs appearing in the teens were usually reprints of existing novels. The year 1914 saw Grosset and Dunlap producing its earliest deluxe MTI. The Eagle's Mate with Mary Pickford boasted a colored photo dust jacket, a colored photo on the book front cover and interior stills, including double spread endpaper stills. The caption opposite the title page heralded what was to become common practice in the early MTIs:\n\n\"The unusual success of the film version of The Eagle's Mate has prompted the issue of this special photo play edition of the book, and the publishers desire to express to the Famous Players Film Company, who produced The Eagle's Mate as a photoplay, their thanks and appreciation for permission to use the illustrations that appear in this edition\".\n\nDillingham was another early, though short lived, publisher of MTIs. Traffic in Souls (1913) and Diamond From the Sky (1915) are two examples. A.L. Burt Company began a long involvement with MTIs with early titles such as the Rex Beach novels The Spoilers (1914) and The Barrier (1917). Burt also provided an early fantasy title with a youthful Antonio Moreno, The Island of Regeneration (1915). The teens also saw the first paperback or \"pulp\" like MTIs with editions of She and Camille published by J. S. Ogilvie Company in 1917. Ogilvie also produced a children's series of early MTIs with soft covers including Jack and the Beanstalk (1916) and Treasure Island (1916).\n\nTwo other books deserve special mention circa 1915, those being the first MTIs of Alice in Wonderland. This is the first known instance of Grosset & Dunlap publishing a deluxe and more common version. The oversized deluxe boasts a full photo dust jacket with three color scenes, interior artwork, color stills and numerous black & whites. This edition was issued with a Gift Box and the only known example of such by Grosset & Dunlap. The regular sized G&D has a color still pasted on front cover with similar dust jacket. The DJ flaps mention these editions as being the first filming of this Lewis Carroll classic.\n\nThe publisher most evident in the MTI field developed its stronghold in this era. Grosset and Dunlap had extensive reprinting rights and though MTI output dwindled during World War I, afterward the company rebounded nicely and escalated production throughout the 1920s. A dust jacket ad, circa 1920, refined the advertising format that popularized Grosset and Dunlap MTIs:\n\n\"The success of moving picture stars in the production of famous novels is inducing many people to purchase the books themselves. If you like the play you will want the book to keep permanently. All are illustrated with scenes from the photoplay\".\n\nGrosset and Dunlap and A. L. Burt, referred to \" photoplay editions\" in their advertising as early as 1915. By the late 1920s Grosset and Dunlap ads took this approach:\n\n\"Your favorite pictures will mean so much more to you if you will read the books from which they were produced\".\n\nA. L. Burt's advertising circa 1925, made the following \"sales pitch\", appealing to our mental imagery:\n\n\"A photoplay is made doubly enjoyable after one has read it in story form. The characters are as charming as old friends in new clothes. And one tingles with pleasure as one's flights of imagination become actualities on the screen. The reverse is equally delightful. When one reads the story of a photoplay after seeing it, the vivid mental pictures and the strikingly real characters that come to life become irresistibly fascinating. Try it and you will read the story version of every picture you see\".\n\nThe connection between reading books and attending the photoplay showing was heavily advertised in magazines. From 1925-1934 magazines such as Ladies Home Journal, Country Gentleman and Needlecraft often ran full page ads that featured MTIs. For the price of a magazine subscription, one could receive free books and the connection with movies was heavily promoted. Bookstore displays must have been quite eye catching to window shoppers. Book publishers were happy to publicize \"photoplays\" as sales of their MTIs produced good profits. The \"Roaring Twenties\" were the peak years for \"the photoplay edition\". Most titles were priced at 75 cents and were discounted by the larger stores. Other companies that entered the field include Renard, Efrus & Bennett, Macaulay, and Jacobsen-Hodgkinson. Renard published a short series of classical literature titles in 1925 that included the Lon Chaney vehicles, Treasure Island (1920) and Oliver Twist (1922) with sixteen and twenty stills respectively. The Westbrook Company provided at least one softcover MTI in 1926, Bertha the Sewing Machine Girl with Madge Ballamy. Douglas Fairbanks, through his own publishing company was responsible for small paperback editions of The Three Musketeers (1921) and Robin Hood (1922).\n\nA lengthy series of MTIs with paper covers and similar in appearance to \"digests\" were produced by Jacobsen-Hodgkinson Company under the logo \"Popular Plays and Screen Library\" (later \"Screen Hit Novels\"). Ninety odd titles were published, sold at 10-15 cents and often contained tinted stills. In the late 20s, Jacobsen-Hodgkinson became Jacobsen and their MTIs contained no interior stills, though the colored photo/front covers were an appealing substitution. The series is the first publisher to heavily utilize novelizations rather than novels. Many of the screenplay writers were given credit and the stories written by unidentified hacks. The titles from the early 30s are tough to locate.\n\nSome titles of merit include Old Clothes (1925), The Cat and the Canary (1927), The Road to Mandalay (1926) and Tillie's Punctured Romance (1927). A limited number of these same MTIs were published by Jacobsen with hard covers and photo dust jackets. Examples are The Divine Woman (1928) with Garbo and Don Juan (1926), the first feature film with a synchronized musical score.\n\nA similar series to Jacobsen was published in Sydney, Australia during the 1926-27 and called \"Movie Stories\". This series was primarily novelizations as well, though origins from novels were more common than Jacobsen. Photos on both sides of the covers were standard with no interior stills. These digest size booklets totaling 48 pages were visual treats and now quite scarce. Examples include Faust (1926), The Road to Mandalay (1926), The Cat and the Canary (1927) and The Man Who Laughs (1928). There are some 50 titles advertised in this series.\n\nMacaulay was another periodic contributor to the MTI market with notable titles including Beyond the Rocks (1922) starring Rudolph Valentino and Gloria Swanson and She Done Him Wrong (1933 ), which may be the only Mae West hardback MTI. Another competitor who appears to have been cut down by the Depression was the Efrus and Bennett Company. They published at least five titles including Gold Diggers of Broadway (1929) and Footlights and Fools (1929). Milton Bradley Company published two oversize, deluxe books that are worthy of special mention, Evangeline (1919) and Lorna Doone (1922). Other oddities include The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (1922) by Donahue Company and another oversize edition by Renard, of the Jackie Coogan film Little Robinson Crusoe (1925), complete with some extra photos of Jackie doing his exercises. The mid 1920s gave rise to MTIs from the United Kingdom and its colonial interests, Canada and Australia. There are a few United Kingdom MTIs from the teens but they are the exception. Movies represented were a mix of UK and US productions. In general books from the UK were smaller and more often only mention \"The Book of the Film\" on the dust jacket. UK publishers of MTIs are difficult to find in the United States. Paper drives and bombing during WWII in England destroyed countless MTIs and in general the prewar titles should be considered scarcer than United States counterparts.\n\nIt's interesting to note that many important US film productions, such as The Sheik (1921), The Unknown (1927), Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), Conflict (1945), A Night in Casablanca (1946) and The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954) were only published in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe largest UK publisher was Readers Library in London. This was the first UK publisher to popularize the \"Film Edition\" concept (1923-1935). Their editions were small sized (6 3/4\" by 4 1/2\") and most often featured a colorful movie artwork dust jacket with written mention of the movie in the editor's comments. There are over 200 Readers Library MTIs and they were frequently reprinted. The Spy (1928), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) and Ben Hur (1926) are examples where reprints had new artwork jackets. Readers Library also provided eight interior stills in about one half of their later 1920s production. \"Illustrated Editions\" include London After Midnight (1927), The Man Who Laughs (1928) and The Jazz Singer (1927). Readers Library editions exist of several early Alfred Hitchcock films, including The Farmer's Wife (1928), The Lodger (1926) and Blackmail (1929). Another Readers Library edition worthy of mention is the rare first edition of the classic film sequel Bride of Frankenstein (1935).\n\nIn typical British fashion, Readers Library advertising made an interesting point:\n\n\"The series comprises classics and modern copyright novels. Furthermore, in order to meet the undeniable call for good literature associated with the film, it includes such novels as form the basis of each new and important film, publication coinciding with the pre or general releases in every instance.\"\n\nThe UK publisher Hutchinson, designed editions similar in format to the Grosset and Dunlap MTIs. Scaramouche (1923), The Ten Commandments (1924), Phantom of the Opera (1925) and the science fiction classic Metropolis (1927) are examples. A rare second edition of The Wizard of Oz (1925) was advertised by Hutchinson with only a mention of the film on the front flap of the dustjacket. Hutchinson also issued digest paperback versions in their popular \"6 d\" series of novels including Atlantide / Queen of Atlantis (1932) and The Keeper of the Bees (1935).\n\nThere were also MTIs published in Canada and Australia and often containing stills not found in US editions, though on a much smaller scale than the UK based publishing houses. McClelland and Thomas Allen were occasional Canadian publishers with near identical versions of Grosset and Dunlap photoplays. Movie Stories was a series in the mid/late 20s published in Australia. These 48-page paperback booklets number some 30 titles and include the 1926 issues Faust and Temptress. Angus and Robertson, a London based publisher, was a pioneer hardback publisher in Australia, providing a forum for the countrys emerging film industry.\n\nBy the late 1920s, MTIs were at their zenith with Grosset and Dunlap leading the field. The economic collapse during the Depression stunted the rapid growth and ultimately altered MTI formats. In the early 1930s, Grosset and Dunlap books generally had four stills rather than the usual eight found in the 1920s. Some only had stills on the endpapers to further cut costs. MTIs with only a dust jacket tie-in became more common and often the jacket used artwork rather than photos.\n\nIt's important to recognize that the novelizations appearing in the 1912- 1930 era often represent films \"lost\" for viewing to modern historians and movie lovers. These storylines and photo illustrations comprise a significant portion of the available historical record and offer glimpses to many cultural and social events of this era.\n\nIn 1933 the Whitman Company published the first movie Big Little Books. These MTIs were cheaply produced on poorer quality paper but were loaded with stills, often over 100. Colored photographs on the covers were standard and other companies such as Saalfield, Lynn and Engel Van Wiseman contributed their version of the BLB format. Notable examples include Les Miserables, A Tale of Two Cities and David Copperfield all in 1935. Several Tarzan titles were available only in this format, including Tarzan the Fearless (1933) and Tarzan Escapes (1936). Movie Big Little Books and their kin continued through the early 1940s and number over 100 movie titles.\n\nFrom about 1931 through the early 50s the UK publishing firm of Hodder & Stoughton issued MTIs as part of their \"Yellow Jacket\" series which referenced the color of the dust jacket. Early examples include The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934) and The Squeaker (1937). There were periodic \"paper\" editions as well, i.e., Daddy Long Legs (1931) and Good-Bye Mr. Chips (1939).\n\nThe late 30s produced some of the finest children's editions, with the vast majority being the feature animated films of Walt Disney. The various oversize dust jacket editions for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Pinocchio (1939) and Fantasia (1940) are all highly collectible.\n\nThe year 1939 is often cited as an unsurpassed year for quality film production and the MTI industry was not going to miss out. Grosset and Dunlap and Macmillan provided oversize editions of Gone With the Wind with color stills. Bobbs Merrill Company offered The Wizard of Oz with endpaper photos. The Dodd Mead Company offered several deluxe movie editions including The Man in the Iron Mask, Wuthering Heights and The Hunchback of Notre Dame with Charles Laughton as Quasimodo.\n\n1939 also gave rise to an expanding paperback book industry and several Pocket Book MTIs appeared that only mentioned their movie counterparts, such as the two-volume set for Victor Hugo's Hunchback of Notre Dame and The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex. Paperbacks with movie dust jackets were appearing in the \"White Circle Film Edition\" series by Collins, a London based publisher. The book front covers repeated the dust jacket photo and The Lady Vanishes / The Wheel Spins is a 1939 example of a classic Hitchcock film.\n\nThe UK publishing would often be a year behind the US due to differing film release dates. 1940 gave rise to UK editions of Gone with the Wind & The Wizard of Oz by Macmillan & Hutchinson respectively. It is interesting to note that despite wartime restrictions, Hutchinson published no less than four Wizard editions compared to the US output of one. These editions are now the most sought after and the hardbacks are superior to the US Bobbs Merrill edition. The dust jacket and book cover production still evident on one of these editions are of the primary actors but not from the finished picture, which is another first.\n\nMTIs started appearing more regularly in the school systems in the late thirties, with the Globe Company inserting stills in their abridged editions of literary classics such as Treasure Island (1934), Drums Along the Mohawk (1936) and Wuthering Heights (1939). Generally, these books were published years after the film's release and are listed because they include many of the classic movies of the 30s and 40s. These books complete with their study guides and questions for the student dropped off in production in the early 1960s.\n\nDuring WW2, MTIs were advertised with the G.I. in mind. \"Send this book to a boy in the Armed Services anywhere for 4 cents postage\" was a common sight on dust jackets. There were resurrections of the classic style MTI with a series of \"Motion Picture Editions\" by Forum Books (Tower/World) with interior stills and photographic jackets. Some examples include The Big Sleep (1946), Kitty (1945) and Adventure (1945). In 1945 Grosset and Dunlap provided a short series entitled the \"Film Classics Library'' including And Then There Were None and The Bells of St. Marys.\n\nMany wartime books were published on cheap pulp paper to conserve resources and they tend to age quickly. Despite the wartime restrictions, the above-mentioned series are among the best to appear in this field and are quite attractive. In reviewing the UK publishing of the WW2 era, it's easy to see the diminished product as a consequence to the paper conservation drives.\n\nThe majority of hardback MTIs in the 1940s are of the dust jacket tie-in variety. Grosset and Dunlap continued to dominate the market. World (Tower/Forum), Triangle and Sun Dial Press were lesser producers. Tower provided a line of mystery titles including The Lodger (1944), Lady of Burlesque (1945) and Hangover Square (1945). Grosset and Dunlap developed a line called \"Madison Square Books\" with jacket tie-ins, including Sergeant York (1941), Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941) and The Spoilers (1942). Many of these titles appeared in regular and slightly larger sizes with the regular perhaps being a \"Book Club\" edition. Some of these smaller editions lost the written credit to the movie, while retaining the movie photo. Triangle Books altered between artwork and photo jackets more frequently than other publishers and examples of their output include Rebecca (1940), Pride and Prejudice (1940) and Background to Danger (1943).\n\nFrom 1938 to the early 50s, Ward Lock in London published at least 12 deluxe MTIs that can't be beaten as a series or as a visual delight. The premier title The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) with Errol Flynn contained no less than 16 full page color stills and 100 black and white photos. In an oversized format, these books also had color dust jackets with the book front cover repeating the jacket illustration. Later titles scaled down to eight color and 80 black and white photos. Other titles include Scrooge (1951), King Solomon's Mines (1950) and three Lassie films. At least one title was reprinted with fewer stills (Robin Hood) and this title and Stanley and Livingston (1939) were also issued as oversized paperback versions.\n\nThe 1940s also saw a growing market for paperback books, which decreased demand for hardbacks. By the end of the decade most MTIs available were paperback. The gradual disappearance of the movie studio \"star system\" altered advertising through books. The country's fascination with TV ultimately created another alternative to reading which left cheaper paperback editions as the most marketable option.\n\nPocket Books was one of the earliest publishers of paperbacks, providing MTIs of The Philadelphia Story (1941) and Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet (1940) with Edward G. Robinson. The Pocket Book edition of The Good Earth (1937) was issued as an un-numbered edition in its first appearance and is considered the first true paperback (pocket sized). This book contains a reference to the movie in the rear text about the author, Pearl Buck. When available, one might expect to pay between $2,000 and $3,000 in collectible condition.\n\nArmed Services Edition paperbacks appeared in 1944-46 and their oblong format often gave written credit to their movie counterparts on the back covers. Some notable exceptions featured a movie photo on the front cover that appears as a book dust jacket, Double Indemnity (1944 ) and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ( 1932 ) are examples. The edition for Woman In The Window (1944) shows the book jacket front from the World published version.\n\nThe UK series by Hollywood Publications and later World Film Publications (circa 1945-52) were thin paperback booklets, often with 20 interior stills. Advertising with these books further popularized the UK \"Book of the Film\" concept. Some notable examples include A Night in Casablanca (1946), Humoresque (1947) and Dead Reckoning (1947). Later editions were more oversized softcovers and include the Hitchcock films Under Capricorn (1949) and Stage Fright (1950). There were some occasional hardback editions with movie dust jackets such as A Guy Named Joe (1944) or Hamlet (1948). There are about 75 titles in this series.\n\nBantam Books were big publishers of MTIs and one of their titles, The Pearl (1947), contains interior stills. Other Bantam titles include Sorry Wrong Number (1948), Winter Meeting (1948) with Bette Davis and The Red Pony (1948) by John Steinbeck. Avon Books infrequently offered MTIs in the 1940s and examples are Stage Door Canteen (1943) and The Private Affairs of Bel Ami (1947). Bart House produced a short series of MTIs with endpaper stills. The Sin of Harold Diddlebock (1947), a Harold Lloyd comedy, is an example. Century published several paperbacks with movie ties. Some of their \"digest\" sized titles are quite difficult to come by, such as The Dark Corner (1946) with Ronald Colman, Singapore (1947) and Fallen Angel (1946).\n\nThe UK publisher Pan began a long MTI relationship in the late 40s. Early issues were often only a back cover credit. Their MTI production progressed to become the most visually appealing and perhaps the most collected UK paperback publisher.\n\nThroughout the 1950s the paperback MTIs maintained their predominance and usually had a photo or artwork tie-in on the cover. They were not the visual bonanza found in so many of the earlier hardbacks. The exceptions, among the best available in this decade, were published mostly by Avon and Signet. Both publishers had a tendency to accentuate the female anatomy in their stills or artwork, a typical graphic style of the paperback field during this era. Some examples of the Avon output include Boy On A Dolphin with Sophia Loren, Valerie and Pickup Alley, both with Anita Ekberg, all appearing in 1957. Avon titles often had stills on the same page as the text (similar to some of the Jacobsen titles in the late 1920s). This produced a \"newspaper\" look to the photos.\n\nSignet would often run 4-8 pages of stills in the center of the book and perhaps are best known for featuring many of the plays of Tennessee Williams, including Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (1958) and Suddenly Last Summer (1959). Marilyn Monroe made some MTI appearances for Signet in the films The Prince and the Show Girl (1957) and Some Like it Hot (1959).\n\nPocket Books (Cardinal), Signet and Bantam Books continued as primary providers of United States MTIs in the 1950s. Other publishers included Perma Books, Popular Library and Pyramid. The mid 50s saw Gold Medal issuing an increasing number and identical editions were appearing in the UK with the same logo. Some scarce paperback originals appear as Gold Medal editions including the Louis L'Amour titles Hondo (1954) and The Tall Stranger (1957). In 1954 Dragon Press in the UK published Creature from the Black Lagoon novelized by Vargo Statten (John Russell Fearn). Both a digest sized paperback and a hardback version were issued. Nice artwork of the creature is repeated on the paperback cover and hardback dust jacket. Recent contacts in the UK report the digest as being the \"rarest\" paperback published in the country. The definition of \"rare\" can be debated at length but copies are rarely offered and likely priced in the $3-5,000 range.\n\nOther United Kingdom publishers were also active, most notably Digit, Fontana, Panther, and WDL. Some UK publishers had their US equivalents as books were often near identical i.e., Bantam/Corgi and Dell/Mayflower.\n\nThe UK Pan paperbacks are sought for their beautiful art covers and a visual balance was often achieved through a rear cover photo. Sam Peffer (aka \"Peff\") was a popular artist for Pan and his covers are actively collected today. Collectible examples of his work include Boy On A Dolphin (1957) and The Barbarian and the Geisha (1958) and The Man Who Finally Died (1962).\n\nIn 1952 Pocket Books, the \"grandfather\" of US paperback publishing, issued a few UK \"Pocket Book\" editions with interior stills and color covers. Titles available include the Robert Taylor/Deborah Kerr movie Quo Vadis and Pickwick Papers.\n\nIn Australia the publisher Horwitz provided MTIs including collectible titles such as The Five Pennies (1959) with great artwork of Louis Armstrong or Too Hot to Handle with Jayne Mansfield and The Hands of Orlac, both in 1960.\n\nA footnote for the Shirley Temple collector regarding hardback MTIs is needed. In 1959, coinciding with the Shirley Temple TV show for children, Random House issued a series of five books. These MTIs highlighted six of the best films of the actress as a child. They boasted a color photo front cover, duplicated on the dust jacket, and many black and white photos. With collector interest in Shirley Temple, it's important that these titles not be confused or equated with Temple MTIs of the original movie periods (1930s). Only on the dust jackets, where her TV series is mentioned, can one readily detect the publication era.\n\nThe 1960s continued to predominate with paperback MTIs. In comparison the UK publishers (as was the case in the 50s) produced many more hardback editions but these were still greatly outnumbered by the paperback versions. United States publishing provided some hardbacks that were Book Club editions and copied the paperback edition, The Graduate (1967) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) are examples. The first edition of 2001 is noted as such and is a fairly expensive MTI that should not be confused with the Book Club Edition version.\n\nThe US paperback publisher Lancer provided MTIs for American International Pictures, that featured the aging horror stars Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre, Basil Rathbone and the youngster Vincent Price. Titles include The Raven (1961) and Comedy of Terrors (1963). A short series of paperback Monarch Movie Editions appeared in the early 60s and focused on horror and mature themes. Brides of Dracula (1960) and Jack the Ripper (1958) are prime examples.\n\nThere are several scarce and expensive movie paperback editions from the 1960s. These were primarily from movies that featured nudity and/or bloody gore, the beginnings of the \"splatter films\" period. Novel Books had a short series of MTIs that included the classic gore titles The Blood Feast and Two Thousand Maniacs both in 1964. Herschell Gordon Lewis was the director and has developed a following similar to Ed Wood Jr. Greenleaf Classic provided Orgy of the Dead (Ed Wood Jr.) and Queen of Blood in 1966 which are difficult to find. Pendulum Press in 1968 published a series of six titles referred to as \"Pendulum Pictorials\". Titles include films directed by the now \"cult\" personality Ed Wood Jr. Bye, Bye Broadie and Raped in the Grass were typical of the Wood product. Novel Books and Greenleaf Classics were not easily purchased outside of adult bookshops, contributing to condition issues and rarity.\n\nUK publishing in the 60s kept pace with the US paperbacks and may have surpassed them in total numbers. UK book publishing firms seemed more interested in maintaining \"Film Editions\" and in general the UK editions from the 50s-60s era are more visually appealing. US publishing was now more likely to use the \"blurb\" tie-in rather than stills or attractive artwork.\n\nFor the ever loyal \"horror\" fans, United Kingdom MTIs from the 60s provide many titles not published in the United States. Hammer Films was often the movie production company and sought-after titles include Revenge of Frankenstein (1958) The Terror of the Tongs, Fall of the House of Usher (both 1960) and the Pan \"Hammer Horror Omnibus\" volumes in 1966 and 1967. Penguin Books in the UK provided the MTIs for the Quartermass series refitted by Hammer for the theaters, from the 1950s TV productions.\n\nA final comment on the paperback format of MTI will look at the series by Olympic Foto-Reader which numbers 14 titles (1967-68). These are X-rated and were found in the adult book shops of the day. As one might surmise these books were heavily illustrated and titles like The Acid Eaters and The Love Rebellion exemplified the 1960s time period. It is not unusual to find these books with a \"saw cut\" through the top of the book. Some titles are questionable as to movies being produced vs. staged models.\n\nWith this historical overview concluded, it is past due to give special consideration to the seminal work in this field. In 1975, Emil Petaja published the book Photoplay Edition, written from the perspective of a collector, who had witnessed much of the MTI history. This first attempt at listing titles and describing the genre is noteworthy for its full-page reproductions of over ninety stills from MTIs. His description of origins further develops the major publishing firms and the commentary, in general should be of great interest to collectors. Emil Petaja's research provided the basis for the expanded listing found in this guide. The author extends a special \"thanks\" to Emil for his inspiration. At this time, copies of Photoplay Edition continue to show up, as an affordable addition to your reference library.\n\nAs the collectibles book market has grown, new authors have emerged to describe various aspects related to MTIs. In 1994 Moe Wadle provided The Movie Tie-In Book (Nostalgia Books), which is a bibliography of United States paperback MTIs. In 1995 Randall Larson authored Films Into Books (Scarecrow Press), which has an extensive listing of novelizations from both movies and TV."
