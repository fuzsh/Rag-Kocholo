        "text": "This vintage real photo postcard features actress Lois Moran (1909-1990). She was an American stage and film actress. She was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She lost both her father, and then her step father, at an early age. In 1921, at the age of 12, Moran and her mother moved to Paris, France. She began singing and dancing at the Paris National Opera at the early age of 13 years old. By age 14, she was appearing in silent films. Her debut in a Hollywood film occurred in “Stella Dallas” (1925). Moran’s film experience included musicals. In fact, she appeared with Al Jolson in “Mammy” (1930). The IMDb reports that Moran acted in 39 films between 1924 and 1974. She parlayed her experience in movies to begin acting on the Broadway stage. The IBDb lists Moran as appearing in 3 Broadway plays between 1930 and 1933. Moran’s personal life included a short affair (1927) with “The Great Gatsby” writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Interestingly, one of the characters (Rosemary Hoyt) in “Tender is the Night” is said to mirror Moran. In 1935, she married Clarence M. Young, the assistant Secretary of Commerce. This postcard was published by Ross Verlag as part of a series (No.3171/1). In the lower right hand corner is the logo of Fox Films. She was likely under contract with Fox when this photo was taken. The photo was taken by Fox photographer Max Munn Autrey (1891-1971).

She was a popular leading lady in films of the 1920’s and 1930’s. The sound era put the brakes on her career and a romantic scandal in the 1940’s brought it to a total stop. Madge was a Texan. She was born in Hillsboro and was raised in San Antonio and Brownwood. Her father was an English professor at Texas A&M University. As a young child she took dancing lessons but soon, she was interested in becoming an actress. At age 9, she made her stage debut in “Aida”. She and her family moved to Denver, Colorado. She met Carlos Bellamy there and the two married. When Madge decided to leave the state to pursue acting, her marriage ended. Madge went to New York City and worked on Broadway as a dancer. In 1919, she replaced Helen Hayes in Broadway’s “Dear Brutus”, opposite actor, William Gillette. Her career took off thereafter. In 1920, Madge appeared in her first film as a supporting actress to Geraldine Farrar. She then signed a contract with the Triangle Film Corporation. Her “breakout role” was as the title character in Lorna Doone (1922). In 1924 she signed a film contract with Fox Film Corporation. She stayed there five years and during that time she appeared in two films for film director, John Ford. In 1925, she began to have difficulties with fox executives. In 1928, she appeared in Fox’s first talking film, “Mother Knows Best”. In 1928, she married for a second time. The marriage lasted 3 days before she and her husband separated. By 1929, Bellamy’s career entered a tail-spin. She had made poor choices out of her unbridled anger. Fan magazines gave her the nickname of “Miss Firecracker” due to her temperament. In 1929, she also quit her contract with Fox, right after they bought the rights to make a film out of Broadway play. The vehicle was bought with a plan to have Madge be it’s star. Bellamy later admitted she quit over money and added “I got too big for my britches”. She didn’t work again until 1932. She accepted roles in “Poverty Row” (B-movies) films. One of these films was “White Zombie” (1932) in which she appeared opposite Bela Lugosi. Her performance received many poor reviews from film critics. By 1940, Madge basically had no film career. However, she wasn’t done with drama. She was arrested after firing three shots from a .32 caliber revolver at her former lover of five years. The incident was premeditated. She was angry at her intended victim because he married a model shortly after ending their affair. Fortunately, her aim was poor and she missed. The only casualty was her ex boyfriend’s car which took a couple of shots into it’s body. Bellamy pleaded guilty to a lesser charge (violating gun laws), and received a suspended six month sentence and probation. Madge Bellamy’s IMDb filmography reports 61 credits between 1920 and 1945. This vintage postcard is provocative. This postcard is risque for it’s era. She is showing a lot of bare skin. The postcard was published while Madge was under contract with Fox. Therefore, the postcard is from before 1929. The card was published by J. Beagles and is part of the “Famous Cinema Star Series” (No.210P). (SOLD)\n\nPostcard 2 offers another risque view of Madge Bellamy. Her alluring pose and short skirt qualifies this postcard to be considered provocative. This card was produced while Madge was under contract with Fox Films, sometime before 1929. This postcard was published by Ross Verlag as part of a series (No.3907/2). The postcard is in very good condition (see scans).\n\nBuy this original Vintage Real Photo Postcard (includes shipping within the US) #7386\n\nTo purchase this item, click on the Pay with PayPal button below\n\n$24.00\n\nBuy this original Vintage Real Photo Postcard (includes International shipping outside the US) #7386\n\nTo purchase this item, click on the Pay with PayPal button below\n\n$34.00\n\nPOSTCARD 1\n\nPOSTCARD 2\n\nMady Christians (1892-1951) was an Austrian-American actress.

The family moved to Berlin and in 1912 they moved to New York City where her father became the general manager of the Irving Place Theater. In 1917, she returned to Europe to study acting under Max Reinhardt. Before the early 1930’s she appeared in several European films. In 1929, she starred in the first full sound film made in Germany. After touring the United States in a play, she was offered a Broadway contract. While appearing in Broadway she became part of a small and influential group of lesbian theater producers, directors, and actors. Christians became involved in political issues. She worked to help refugees, to gain rights for workers, supported Russian War relief, and was involved in other political issues. Her political work brought her to the attention of the FBI and other anti Communist groups, notably the House Committee on Un-American Activities. The FBI investigated Christians when an informant identified her as a “concealed communist”. The investigation virtually ended her performing career. She passed away in 1951 This card was published by Ross Verlag. The firm operated in Berlin, Germany.

She was known for her vivacious energy, mesmerizing on-screen presence, and her impressive talent. She was born in Brooklyn, New York and grew up in the borough’s tenements.

Despite her humble background, she became a very influential figure in cinema history. Her rise from poverty to stardom, and her groundbreaking portrayals of independent and liberated women, helped her gain an enduring legend of the silver screen. Clara Bow was discovered in 1922 when she participated in a magazine contest searching for new talent. Her photographs were seen by film producer B. P. Schulberg who saw her potential and offered her a screen test. Her screen presence was impressive and she signed a contract with Paramount Pictures. In her earliest films, her versatility was was obvious as she transitioned effortlessly between dramatic and comedic roles. It was the 1927 film, “It” that made Clara Bow a superstar and earned her the nickname of “The It Girl”. She was viewed as modern, charismatic, and sexually liberated. Bow was also successful in “talkie” films, despite her Brooklyn accent. While Bow was successful professionally, her personal life was a “hot mess”. She had a long term troubled marriage to actor Rex Bell (m.1931) and she battled her own mental health issues, including anxiety and depression. In 1933, Bow retired from acting and became a rancher.

Her filmography on IMDb credits her with 49 film appearances between 1922 and 1934. She made her film debut at the age of eighteen.

She played in silent films and made a successful transition to sound films. She even sang in some of her talkies. She was married to a prosperous Jewih man, named Adolf Strenger. Because of her marriage, in 1938 she was banned from any participation in the German film industry. It was thought that she was probably not Aryan like her husband. The rise of the Nazis forced the couple to leave Germany and emigrate to the United States via Portugal.The pair left Europe with the assistance of Aristedes de Sousa Mendes. He was a Portuguese Consular stationed in France. Mendes defied orders from his government and issued thousands of visas to Jews, allowing them to escape with their families and their lives.
