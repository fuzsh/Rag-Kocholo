        "text": "Full Work\n\n(Sharon Goode worked with Andrew Birkin on the ATV production of Peter Pan with Danny Kaye and Mia Farrow, and also on the research for the BBC drama The Lost Boys. During that time, she corresponded and met with Nico Llewelyn Davies. With her kind permission, I have now transcribed and edited (taking out salutations and anything that wasn't relevant) the correspondence between them. It does show some remarkable insights in Nico's life as a boy, the tragedy of his parents' untimely death, his relationship with his brothers and his nephews, and growing up with JM Barrie as his guardian. Brutus, January 2021.)\n\nPlease note the correspondence is copyright protected so no part can be used or quoted in other works without the authors' or their estate's explicit permission. Any enquiries should be directed in the first instance to this website.\n\nSharon Goode (SG) to Nico Ll. Davies (NLD)\n\n17/11/1975\n\nDear Mr Ll. Davies\n\n(…) Andrew and I became interested in Barrie when we were both working on the ATV production of “Peter Pan” which was made last summer. We read Janet Dunbar’s book and then started reading around the subject – his letters, Cynthia Asquith’s diaries etc. and then, of course started reading through the plays, novels and speeches. Andrew has a copy of Denis Mackail’s biography, which he had strongly recommended me to read and I have ordered a copy which should be arriving any day now. Obviously, from my point of view, I would like time to study this before meeting you. I, myself, am helping Andrew with the research for his trilogy but also hope, at the same time, to write a book on Barrie – probably something on the lines of my “impressions of the man and his literature”. I feel that after so much reading I must have something to say, although at the moment I am still looking very hard for an “angle”!\n\nWe would be very interested to see any photographs, letters etc and there will of course be small detail questions that spring to mind… I shall give these some thought and try and compile sort of list before visit, but as I said before, the impression Barrie made on you is far more valuable to us than anything else.\n\n(…)\n\nNLD to SG – 19/11/1975\n\nDear Miss Goode\n\nMany thanks for your letter. (…)\n\nI’m sure I’ll be able to answer some questions, tho’ I don’t know the answers to others. (…)\n\nAt this – very early to me – stage, I shall guess the three things in which you should perhaps concentrate: and I say because it seems to me they’re missing for most current views on J.M.B: (a) his humour, his fun-to-be-with etc; (b) the large number of his men friends from Capt Scott, Thomas Hardy, A.G.W. Mas, old Scotch friends and vice versa; (c) his wizardry with children… He (and I) only knew one small child who didn’t fall completely to his wiles, whether wriggling his ears, moving his eyebrows or throwing stamps up to the ceiling. (…)\n\nA creature of moods, yes indeed: maybe to be expected of a man of genius: times of silence, but many many more hours of humour.\n\nDenis Mackail will tell you a great deal. It’s too long – and we had to cut a great lot even then – but chock full of the very Barrie. Another essential book in its way – which I’d be sure you know – is Roger Lancelyn Green’s 50 Years of Peter Pan.\n\n(…)\n\nSG to NLD 24/11/1975\n\nDear Mr Davies\n\nMany thanks for your letter of the 19th November. I have indeed taken all your points to heart and thank you very much for them. Barrie’s humour, I think, is so obviously an important of the man, yet it is the one that it is most difficult to find examples of. It’s all so easy to get such pleasure from the deeper level of his writing that perhaps the humour’s too often overlooked. I do agree that it should not be. I suppose that it’s in the speeches that one can most easily find examples of the wit (I’ve just finished the McConnachie & JMB selection) though, obviously, it’s there throughout his writing and, as you know so well, his conversation.\n\nI also took to heart Mackail’s warning at the beginning of his book … (“If any biographer should swallow more than a fraction of speeches and writings which are professedly autobiographical – he may still find himself quite a remarkable distance from the truth”! Truth – I doubt whether anyone will ever, with any certainty, claim to know it (for who can tell when reality ends & fantasy begins?!) All one can hope for, I think is to gain a total impression of Barrie which embraces all aspects of his character and does him no discredit by oversimplification or harping too much on one facet. But enough of this. You said this was an early stage for me. The more I read, the more I know I have to read! (Although, at the same time, I find it hard to remember that time when there wasn’t at least one Barrie book on the bedside table!).\n\n(…)\n\nWe have made contact with Mr Lancelyn Green who, also, has been very encouraging and has invited us to visit him on our way back from Scotland next week.\n\n(…)\n\nNLD to SG – 28/11/1975\n\nDear Sharon\n\nI’m sure I should call you thus: whether or not you’ll find it as simple to ‘Nico’ a 72 year old… whichever you find easier, either writing or when we meet. And the same of course will go with Andrew Birkin tho’ I didn’t mention this in the long letter I wrote him the other day.\n\nYou’ll get this on your return from Kirriemuir which I’m bound to say I expect you’ll find a pretty depressing spot! I haven’t been there since the funeral and much as I love, and frequently as I have visited, Scotland. I’m more drawn to Thrums!\n\nWhen you both come here there’s one thing (or things) I’m sure I should let you take away: the typescripts of my brother Peter’s SOME DAVIES PAPERS AND LETTERS (or some such title): for the last few years of his life Peter worked on this and, as I shall tell you it contributed greatly to his own growing melancholia, and eventual death. He called it The Morgue! And delving into the tragically early deaths of Father & Mother – each in their early 40’s – each so beautiful, such a perfect pair etc. is full of deep sad names (??) as one reads. Peter did it absolutely privately… it was just for my brother Jack and me and any of our children i.e. ONLY FAMILY. It consists of many letters with marvellous comments… And of course when J.M.B. appears on the scene there are many many revealing glimpses of him and what we all thought of him etc. After a good deal of deliberation I let Janet Dunbar take them away and – in my biased view – Peter’s part is much the best of Janet’s book! Peter’s major plan was to start with Father & Mother’s meeting (perhaps with an earlier volume or two as Llewelyn Davies and du Maurier parents) ending with my brother Michael’s death by drowning in 1921 which – as Denis Mackail says – was J.M.B’s Mortal Blow. But Peter never got so far… in fact he’d only begun to get the bit about George (killed in March 1915) into shape; still there is a considerable amount of stuff in what Peter did complete which I would say is vital for any study of J.M.B. even tho’ Janet may have lifted the cream.\n\nI’ll sort out a few old photographs tho’ I doubt if there’s very much of interest here. (…) You will, I expect, be thrilled to see the Wm Nicholson designs for the Peter Pan characters to appear in the 1904 original production of the Play which are at present decorating our hall.\n\nYou will doubtless have seen my long letter to Andrew in which I told him to ask me a few particular questions when you both came here… I think I must have included ‘you cad’; here we are or two for you; ‘Mr Mears’, Billiards and other games and the Billiard Table; Fishing; Snobbery; Neville Cardus.\n\nThe only person I can at the moment of think you ought to try and see: she could be particularly ‘useful’ to Andrew’s thoughts on the Uncle Jim-Michael relationship is EILUNED LEWIS. She has written a few books – the best known DEW ON THE GRASS and has been a contributor to Country Life: I can’t remember her married name – it’s written HENDY, HENDRY (I think) or HENTY – been married for years... details & address and so on can be got from an ex-secretary at Peter Davies Ltd (Miss Joan Waldegrave). She was one of the family ‘Mr & Mrs Hugh Lewis’ referred to in Denis Mackail’s work: was Michael’s age and devoted to J.M.B. as they all were and he to them. I know she’d love to help – at least, I’ve not seen her for 10 years but ‘if she’s alive she’d love to help’. (...)\n\nBy now you and Andrew will be aware that I let any pen take me across a good deal of page (…) when the subject interests me. I’ll take it that you’ll show each other what I write to the one. (…)\n\nSG to NLD 4/12/1975\n\nDear Nico\n\nYes, it is very easy to write that – the problem was remembering to write “Dear Mr Davies”! I was very pleased to get your letter which was waiting for me when I got back from Scotland. (…)\n\nWe were, as you so rightly expected, disappointed with Kirriemuir itself – very grim, especially the Den (complete with vividly painted children’s swings etc.). The Barrie museum at his birthplace was very interesting though … they have a photocopy of the Boy Castaways, which we were very pleased to be able to see, and also corrected proofs, photographs, press cuttings etc. (…) We also visited Balnaboth House and St. Andrews where we talked to two women who were at the St. Andrews Speech. While we are on the subject of visiting places there is a point that I have been meaning to ask you – I visited Brendon and found “Ashton House”, although no one there remembers Barrie or the summer of your mother’s death. I enclose a photograph of the house and wondered if you would be able to identify it – it’s not, by any means, a major issue, but it’s an end I might as well get tidied up now! Would I be right in assuming that you and Michael went back to Brendon again with Barrie and that his letters referring to you asking Nicholas Snowe for fishing rights were talking about another summer?\n\n(…)\n\nI think I explained in a previous letter than Andrew and I met while we were both working on the ATV Peter Pan. I was one of the secretaries to Gary Smith, the producer and worked with the “writers”. It was at that stage I read the Lurie article and then Janet Dunbar’s book, and started on Barrie’s plays and novels. Andrew offered the idea of his trilogy to ATV who were very interested but said they couldn’t think about making it until 1977. The B.B.C. were keen to do it straight away. By that stage Andrew and I had had many long discussion son Barrie and I had already started doing research, for my own personal satisfaction, in my spare time. I began to think that I’d like to try my hand at writing something on Barrie myself. …I was incidentally, very interested in your comment that your brother Peter would be a book in himself. I do agree with you that Peter’s comments are the best of Janet Dunbar’s book, and look forward very much to seeing the rest – I may yet find a little more “cream”; … Barrie is such an interesting subject and I am becoming labelled as a “Barrie Fan”, which I don’t object to!\n\n(…)\n\nNLD to SG 6 /12/1975\n\nDear Sharon\n\nMany thanks for your letter: yesterday evening I wrote at vast length to Andrew – mostly giving him my Cynthia Asquith angle, in order to save time when we meet – and as I know each of you shows the other my letters this won’t (I trust!) be too long.\n\nI was particularly glad to get your two pictures of Ashton Farm as I think we used to call it: alas I can’t properly claim to identify it… I was 6 ½ when I stayed there: A somewhat coincidental fact my wife (Mary) and I went for a week or so to Exmoor in 1974 and one wet and windy day went in search of Ashton… something of a success in the church at Dare but by the time we tried to approach Ashton House itself, the steepness, our careering small dog, the weather etc. ‘shyness’ in motoring down the rickety ‘drive’, meant we never saw the house; in 1923 friend and I motored by and I remember climbing through some outlying fence and looking at the house but what little memory I have left from then is useless. Nicholas Snowe at first stirred no memory, but vague thoughts have returned. But my first step was to look into Peter’s typescript concerning Mother’s death and – through my tears (it’s fearfully sad, the compilation practically killed Peter as I think I told you) – it became clear that when Mother died in mid August 1910, Michael and I stayed behind at Ashton till the end of the school holiday, and George & Peter & J.M.B. returned after the funeral so this end August/early September would be the period I talked to Nicholas Snowe about fishing rights. We never went back: from then on it was Scotland ‘always’: 1911 Sutherland, 1912 Outer Hebrides 1913 Killiecrankie 1914 Argyll and the war – thereafter short hops here & there for Michael and me until lastly 1920 Eilean Shona. All wonderful in their very different ways … all considerably more attractive than your first visit to Kirriemuir!\n\n(…) May I keep the Ashton photographs? I’d like to have them in Peter’s typescript.\n\n(…)\n\nSG to NLD 16/12/1975\n\nMany thanks for your letter. I am pleased you liked the photographs of Ashton Farm – please do keep them, I am enclosing copies of the others that I took there in case you are interested in having these too. (…) “Ashton” has now been divided into two properties – the buildings at the back are referred to as “Ashton Farm” and the house itself as “Ashton House”.\n\nMy trip to Ashton was somewhat ‘off-the-cuff’ in that I was visiting friends in Somerset and thought it would be a good idea to see if I could find anything. All I had to go on were the extracts from Peter’s notes which Janet Dunbar quotes and also two small references in letters to Cynthia Asquith (Meynell’s collected letters): Dec.20 – “I trust you will all have a very good Christmas at Dulverton. The nearest I ever was when we were on Exmoor, and had the rectory where Blackmore wrote Lorna Doone. The great man who owned all the fishing was Nicholas Snowe, and the boys used to make Nicholas, aged six, intercede with him for fishing facilities on the grounds they were of the same name – successfully too.” Feb. 1927 – “I hope you got safely to Pixton and were not eaten up by the dogs. There is a part of Exmoor not very far from you which I once knew so well that I daresay I could go about it still, blindfold, without striking against many trees. Where Blackmore lived when he wrote Lorna Doone. Michael was ten then and I remember we had a grand scheme of reaching Dulverton and fishing some water there.”\n\nFor the sake of simplicity I am at the moment assuming that either Barrie’s reference to ‘the rectory where Blackmore wrote Lorna Doone’ is a touch of fantasy or, alternatively, that when Peter says that they (you) returned not to Ashton but ‘to Oare, a mile or so higher up the little river’ that it was to Parsonage Farm, which claims to have been where Blackmore stayed. It is but a small detail though! Ashton House itself was so much the picture I had conjured up from Peter’s notes that instinct, if nothing else, convinced me I was at the right place – I’ll never make a proper researcher!\n\nI’ve numbered the backs of the photographs and shall try to explain what I was trying to show (…):\n\nEnough on Ashton! May I ask you for a few comments on Mary Ansell? Her sad story is one part of the complex picture which I find very interesting. Did Barrie ever discuss her and his marriage with you? Did you, in fact, ever meet her? I find the contrast between the 1917 letter to her, with the thoughtful “But just one thing I should like to say, because no one else can know it so well as I, that never would a young literary man have started with better chances than Mr Cannan when he had you at the helm.” And Cynthia Asquith’s reference in her ‘Portrait’ to the 1923 Stanway gathering somewhat unbelievable. Perhaps I am too kind on Mary, and too damning on Cynthia, but my immediate reaction was to write ‘bitch’ in heavy letters in the margin of the Asquith book. Perhaps I shouldn’t have written that either! Were you aware of a change in Barrie’s attitude to the ‘elderly woman’ once he was, presumably, helping her financially once more? Presumably he must have seen her occasionally after 1917. Someone remarked to Andrew and I in passing that they had heard a story that Mary returned from France every year and Barrie stipulated that she could only be spared one hour of his time! Any comments? Were you yourself aware of the reason for Broadway being ‘put strictly out of bounds’ in 1923? (...)\n\n(…)\n\nNLD to SG 19/12/1975\n\nMany thanks for your letter – and for kindly sending me more photographs! I value having each of them but ‘recognition’ is something, alas, of an overstatement. I wish the weather had been more clement that day last year when Mary and I were there – when I might have met the present owners… almost the only sharp-ish memory I have is of a pretty steep curving bit of drive down to the front door with, on the left, a grass sort of verge of about a yard wide down which I used to hurtle with a kite soaring in the draught behind me! I doubt if it exists today. (Just looked again at your first sent picture and think I can detect where I ran with my kite!).\n\nI’m afraid your guess will be better than mine so far as Blackmore is concerned. I’ve no recollection at all of moving from Ashton after Mother’s death. It may be in Peter’s ‘book’ which you’ll be seeing before long. But I would certainly ‘assume’ that J.M.B. was putting in a bit of fantasy unless he meant simple that Blackmore was living in the district some of the time he was writing Lorna Doone which he probably was!\n\nAnd how I wish that I could tell you more about Mary Ansell. And I can’t remember how much I have written about her to Andrew. I rather think I told him the true story of the 1923 ‘terrible narrow escape’ on p.158 of Cynthia Asquith’s book. While you were writing ‘BITCH’ possibly on p 157, I wrote on p 158 ‘QUITE UNTRUE – see after index’ and I wrote about 16 lines. Fully dramatic in its way, but no ‘hairbreadth escape’… I was the driver! Ask Andrew: if I haven’t told him I’ll give you the dope. We all loved ‘Mrs Barrie’ while she was around and – almost unbelievably were/are certain she loved us. But I never spoke to her between 1909 and 1937. Uncle Jim NEVER spoke a word about her to me. I have one grisly memory which I place at Dhivach Lodge in Scotland, summer of 1907, when I went one morning into Uncle Jim’s bedroom and said something like ‘Is Mrs Barrie coming back?’ or ‘When’s Mrs Barrie coming?’ and getting a very awful expression from him ½ in his face ½ in a sort of grunt! This sort of thing occurred two or three times to me…VERY rare, and pretty ghastly! ‘You CAD!’ (which I asked Andrew to remind me of when we meet!) was the worst.\n\nHow difficult if not impossible it is trying to work out why this? And why that? from an author’s point of view. So often one is ‘certain’ than X happened and then one hears No, it was Y. Any vague ‘knowledges’ I have of Mary Barrie trying to see Uncle Jim will have stemmed from Cynthia, so I can’t fully trust it. From somewhere or other I have always ‘understood’ that Uncle Jim was always generous to her. To me, now, looking in to Denis Mackail’s book I became pretty sure there was nothing in your ‘rumoured’ ‘she could only be spared one hour of his time’. (…)\n\nAnd I’m not really much of a help on your ‘angle’: I would have been against the admittedly attractive idea of comparing Peter with Alice & Christopher Robin, simply because Peter was NOT the original of Peter Pan! He got tagged with it on account of the genius of the title. As you know from the Dedication ‘To the Five’ Uncle Jim says he got PP from rubbing the five of us violently together: more correctly it should have been Four: more correctly still Three as it was George, jack and Peter who really lit the spark from and before ‘The Boy Castaways’. I’ll be very happy to talk about all this… I think I’ve said that Peter truly detested his link with it, as – one gathers – Christopher Robin has. You’d be astonished how many people I’ve heard sure that they were the origin of Peter Pan. My favourite I think is the Ranee Muda of Sarawat – or Sylvia Brooke whose daughter married Harry Roy!\n\n(…)\n\nSG to NLD 27/12/1975\n\n(…) I am very glad you found the photographs of Ashton interesting. Thanks for all the trouble you have taken in trying to identify them – from your ‘kite’ memories I’d say that, even if it proves at a later stage not to be the place, ‘Ashton House’ is a very good understudy and the right sort of picture to have in mind!\n\nMary Ansell – I think part of her fascination for me is going to be the fact that I can find so little, but thank you anyway. I’ve been trying to fit your “When’s Mrs Barrie coming” against a holiday background and am finding it difficult, unless Ashton (?). Mary was still around in 1907 and was at Dhivach Lodge with you. That was the holiday when Sylvia saved Luath from drowning. Looking at my Mackail notes the situation looks like this: 1908, Christmas – that very interesting Swiss holiday: Barrie, Mary, Gilbert Cannan, Sylvia & boys. (I realise you would have been only 5 but did any of your brothers, in retrospect, pass comment on it, other than Peter’s ‘It must have been a queer quartet of adults that conversed together after the boys had gone to bed’?) 1909 – Sylvia and boys to Dartmoor while Barrie rehearsing. He went to Black Lake, spoke to gardener and divorce blew up. The next holiday, as far as I can find in Mackail, is 1910 – Ashton and your mother’s death.\n\nI couldn’t remember your comments on the ‘hairbreadth escape’ and checked with Andrew – in fact you hadn’t included them in your ‘Cynthia’ letter and we’d both be very interested. So if you could you give the dope I’d be very grateful. Apart from Mary, another two names have sprung to mind this morning – Charles Frohman and Captain Scott. Frohman – I very much liked the story on page 456 of Mackail about the perpetual pass scribbled on the fly-leaf of a Rider-Haggard book. Any more recollections like that, or comments Barrie may have made to you about Frohman? Scott – did Barrie ever talk to you about Scott or hint as to what the misunderstanding between them had been. You were probably too young to remember meeting him but did any of your brothers tell you any stories about him. How did the news of his death affect you all? Yes, it affected the whole country but I would imagine it would have been different for those connected, in however small a way, with the man himself. How did Barrie appear to take the news when with you?\n\nWizardry with children (…). A very important point I think – the amount of happiness Barrie gave to children and got from them. Going back to the Alison Lurie article, I think the main point in that that I disagree with is the ‘lonely and distressed’ idea. Yes, he could be full of self-pity, especially when he wanted sympathy, but who can’t? ‘And the little boys he loved have turned into strange and hateful young men’ – never. If you told me that Barrie ever tried to stop you growing up, I don’t think I’d believe you! As early as the Little White Bird stage he knew and accepted that you would all grow up.\n\nThe following excerpt shows this so well I think:\n\n“David,’ said I, with a sinking, ‘are you going to Pilkington’s?’\n\n‘When I am eight,’ he replied.\n\n‘And shan’t I call you David then, and won’t you play with me in the Gardens any more?’\n\nHe looked at Bailey, and Bailey signalled him to be firm.\n\n‘Oh no,’ said David cheerily.\n\n(…) But Timothy would have remembered.”\n\nHe ‘had him laughing and happy again’ for that was what ‘he’ was so good at. I think always Barrie accepted that the children he played with would grow up but that this increased the happiness he experienced while they were still children – how. Much more we all value something we know we shall soon lose! Those Stanway summers – what was it like for you, as an adult, looking back at Barrie playing with the next Timothy/Simon Asquith etc. generation of children. Were you aware of the ‘Barrie playing with children’ hadn’t changed but that the ‘Barrie the writer’ had and therefore the difference with all the other children he brought under his spell was that there was no ‘Peter Pan’ evolving and although he magic as far as each child was concerned was the same, some of the magic for Barrie had gone. (…)\n\nWas it purely coincidence that Jack called Timothy, Timothy. (“The Last of Timothy” chapter in The Little White Bird is, in my opinion, one of the best bits of Barrie and a very important step in the development of ‘Peter Pan’ – Timothy and the Peter in the Little White Bird merging to become the Peter Pan of the play.) Is Jack’s Timothy contactable or are there any other names in the Asquith boys/Timothy age range who you think it me be worth me trying to trace, not so much for the trilogy story but just for more childhood impressions of JMB. By the way, Simon Asquith, if I haven’t already mentioned it, is dead.\n\nYes, of course I agree that Peter was not Peter Pan (if he has to be anyone I would plump for Barrie himself, although ’Peter’ is obviously more than that … far more) Yet Peter was one of the family that inspired ‘Peter Pan’, he was the one who had part of the name and was therefore more easily associated with the story, and the one, from what you say, who was most affected by the association. Therefore, on these counts, he was very much an example of a child affected by literature. But yes, to over-simplify, or rather over-stress, however appealing would be a mistake. It is but an idea.\n\n(…)\n\nNLD to SG 1/1/1976\n\n(…) And many thanks for your excellent letter of 27 Dec. It’s funny, isn’t it, the way this extra lengthy correspondence has sprung up between you, me and Andrew… very unusual I’d think – and of course I fully realise I’m not only retired but actually like writing letters!\n\nLet me start this ‘reply’ with the true story of the ‘hairbreadth escape’ (see p 158 of Cynthia Asquith’s Portrait of Barrie): I had a very great friend in Roy Kennerley-Rumford – Clara Butt’s son: one of Uncle Jim’s most wonderful ‘gifts’ to me was having me run a cricket week for 3 consecutive summers in delicious Stanway – 6 or 7 of us in the Eton Eleven the rest and all of us close friends etc. Roy had been in the first year and had to put off the second, got meningitis and died, funeral at Stoke in Oxfordshire while we were at Stanway. I said I was going to drive over – would Uncle Jim like to come with me? He would and then said words to the effect ‘Let’s try and go some different way or ways so that we can avoid Broadway… I’m rather bored at always going through Broadway..’ There didn’t seem much problem about this and I successfully skirted it on the way to the funeral: but on the way back I lost the track and we found ourselves going through Broadway. Suddenly I saw a lady walking along the pavement in our direction… “Oh, look at that woman, Uncle Jim – I’m sure I’ve seen her somewhere before, do you know her?” Without a quiver of any emotion [he was a consummate actor!] he said ‘No, I don’t think I’ve seen her before’ and we drove on. She never looked towards us, I hadn’t seen her for at least 16 years, didn’t think much more about it. Till that evening Cynthia said to me ‘Do you know who that lady was you saw in Broadway? She used to be Mrs Barrie, but don’t tell Uncle Jim that I’ve told you.’ I truly was astounded! But there was nothing resembling a word of truth in the missing a hairbreadth running down an elderly woman or what a fantastic might-have-been. Rather frightening were one starts wondering how much one can ever believe as one reads an autobiography sketch!\n\nMy ‘when’s Mrs Barrie coming’ remark: may not be my actual words. I’m pretty certain it was Dhivach and my guess is that she will either have been with us and left for a day or two, or not yet have arrived. This (Dhivach) was certainly the last place she came on holiday with us boys. All Denis’ dates, and your reading of them are correct. So far as Caux is concerned, tho’ I do have funny little isolated memories (aged 5) they are of such things as being pronged up the backside as I sat at my toboggan and a faster chap collided with me with spikes on his books… a lot of fuss was made of me which I enjoyed, but can’t remember who was the culprit! I used, from time to time to say a few words about Caux and the ‘queer quartet’ with my brothers, particularly with Peter, but cannot think of anything worth repeating which will not find (if it’s there!) in Peter’s typescript – which Janet Dunbar may not have included in her book. Coincidentally I have very recently, and for the first time, read a novel by Gilbert Cannan called Round the Corner which I thought extremely good. I once asked Martin Secker, who had about the prime of all publishers’ lists – including such as D H Lawrence, Compton Mackenzie etc – which of his author she personally considered the best and was astounded when he said ‘Gilbert Cannan’. Peter always told me how much we all liked him!\n\nCharles Frohman. I have here the copy of Red Eve by Rider Hagggard and you’ll be tickled to see the ‘perpetual pass’, Alas I can hardly remember him, tho’ Uncle Jim often talked of him ALWAYS with deep affection. As for Capt. Scott – again the very faintest memory, probably at Dhivach Lodge when I was rising 4! But here again of course I had much talk later with Uncle Jim and often had in my hands the fabulous last letter he wrote Uncle Jim from the South Pole. ‘This will be yours, one day’ said Uncle Jim.. which did not turn out accurate! But I cannot at all remember the actual effect of the tragedy personally on Uncle Jim.\n\nAs for Alison Lurie article! I think just as well I’ve never seen it. ‘The little boys he loved have turned into strange and hateful men’!! Could there not be money in this for me?! Of course I think Michael and Simon Asquith did turn into strange and hateful men so it’s difficult to know which square one is on. I hadn’t realised Simon was dead … I get a bit confused remembering which of the two went to prison, each I think was a Conscientious Objector (tho’ I’ve nothing against that if genuine)… in my eyes there’s bad blood, Charteris rather than Asquith. I don’t think this is a case of envy or bad blood because they’ve snitched all our money, but most people would think so.\n\nOf course he never tried to stop a soul growing up however much he regretted that such had to happen. I must and will tackle next The Little White Bird I have a rather sickening belief that I’ve never read it!\n\nIn the Stanway years I truly enjoyed a good deal of Uncle Jim’s ‘wizardry’ with the various Charteris/Asquith children tho’ I wasn’t present at any of the children’s plays, being away and married by then. You could possibly get a slant and much of this from Ian Fleming’s widow Anne (who was Anne Charteris the eldest of her four – three girls and a boy, children of Guy). She had little affection for the set-up, and has something of an ironic tongue! Very good company & very intelligent, but fancy a bit sickened by the whimsicalities. She could interest you – rather than Andrew, at any rate from his trilogy point of view. I think your impressions are right: he could still play wonderfully with children, who loved him, but his own magic-for-Barrie evaporated with Michael’s death.\n\nI can’t be certain but I’d say nothing stemming from J.M.B. caused Jack & Gerrie to call their son Timothy (I’ve always understood that was quite a toss-up whether I should be called Nicholas or Timothy.) Both of Jack’s two children are dead – each a tragic story which I’ll tell you one day if you’re interested tho’ they don’t affect Barrie all that much. Gerrie is alive, and contactable in Cornwall. But I’m not sure how much I should recommend you to contact her … we could talk about this. For one reason or another she didn’t find too much to say in Uncle Jim’s favour, was naturally primarily influenced by Jack. But Gerrie is and always was a chronic complainer… e.g. the world, and if you like God, is set against Gerrie. And in truth things never worked too well for her, and very badly on occasion. You’d also get a word or two of interest from my much loved cousins – also by chance in Cornwall – Angela & Daphne du Maurier. Moving upwards, I’m pretty sure Cynthia’s sister Lady Mary Lyn (I think that’s her present surname) still lives and is well at Apperley Court near Tewksbury in Glos. Used to be a great friend – never the reverse, but gone out of my life. She would have many of the later memories, but I don’t think ever appreciated how much and deep Cynthia had her claws with the sporran!\n\nI was particularly thrilled to get a telephone call the day before yesterday from Eiluned Lewis letting me know that you’d been talking to her on the telephone: and that you’ll be seeing her before you’ll be seeing me! I’m sure you’ll like her, but don’t know how much she can ‘help’ either you or Andrew. What ‘thrilled me most was talking to her elder sister Medina (whom I think you will meet) with whom I don’t think I’ve talked for more than 50 years! The fun we all used to have so many years ago. Again I’ll show you – maybe boring you to hell – old snaps of our days with the Lewis in Wales during World War 1. All of us, every Lewis, every Davies, the one Barrie loved pretty much every minute.\n\n(…)\n\nSG to NLD 5/1/1976\n\n(…) Yes, this lengthy correspondence is, I suppose, unusual, but a very good thing., I think. It’s all too easy to rush to the telephone with half-formed ideas to discuss and then a few weeks later find that my ideas may have changed and I’m by then, not too certain about those original debates. (…)\n\nMay I begin with a couple of things I should have thought to put in the last letter, where they obviously belong! Firstly – you said previously that you wish you had known Mary Ansell better and I just wondered whether you have ever read any of her books. So far, the only one I’ve managed to get hold of is ‘Happy Houses’, (I’m still hoping to find ‘The Happy Garden’ and ‘Men & Dogs’). I started reading it but have had to leave it and get my priorities right – e.g. Mackail, the Collected Letters etc. If you haven’t read it, would like to, and can’t get hold of a copy, you are, of course, very welcome to borrow mine. I’m going through Mackail for a second time, sorting out my notes, and balancing it with Daphne du Maurier’s ‘Gerald’ for light relief – as well as all those other things that one has been meaning to read for so long!\n\nThat was the first. The second is the name (I don’t know how) left out of the ‘any memories of..’ list – Charlie Chaplin! How serious do you think Barrie was in those two suggestions for Chaplin to play Peter Pan? It’s a very interesting thought – and what an interesting dinner that must have been…\n\nI have been dipping into the Letters once more. Do you know anything about Mrs Josephine Maitland Edwards (Miss Mitchell Innes), p.114 of the 1942 edition of Meynell, obviously a friend of George’s? I love Barrie’s letters to Elizabeth Lucas, especially the one on p.90 – ‘I had an odd thought today about the war that might come to something, but it seems to call for a poet…’ Wonderful – I remember reading that for the first time and then, by chance meeting ‘A Well Remembered Voice’ like an old friend. Any stories connected with the move of flats in Adelphi Terrace – it must have been a pretty marathon move? What has happened to Audrey Lucas? Yes, I got Eiluned Hendry’s address from your secretary and wrote to her. She telephoned to say that, as she is still writing for Country Life and is also in the process of writing another book (one chapter of which, apparently is on Barrie), she didn’t feel that she could enter into a lengthy correspondence (!) and suggested that we visit her before her sister returns to Wales, and she goes to visit her daughter.\n\nAnother thought – how did Barrie get on with your school/college friends. I like the letter to Audrey Lucas about your ‘great friend who is much concerned because his father’ (who is a member of the Government(?)) ‘is not bright enough’. ‘The boy stayed with us in summer, and I told him on his departure that I expected a very fine letter of thanks for my hospitality. He took it solemnly, and I had a grand letter from him, and Nico had one at the same time asking him to wire how the letter had been received.’ A nice story, but what was that visit, during the holiday that followed Michael’s death, really like – pretty gruelling for everyone I would have thought? What did Barrie think of Rupert Buxton (‘a Harrow lad but otherwise commendable’)?\n\nI am very intrigued by my copy of the Collected Letters. It has been underlined and written in by someone whose writing I can only describe as considerably worse than Barrie’s – and that took me a fair while to master! The ‘someone’ whose name in the front looks like ‘Roger Something’, appears to have been present at the Shona holiday – at the top of p.184 I can make out “He was wrong. The very next day we went for a walk”. Beside the “puppy that a friend of Michael’s has brought here”, ‘he’ has written RB (Rupert Buxton?), yet at the front of the book there is a note ‘p. 184 Supposed conversation with self’ and he’s obviously notRupert Buxton. ‘He’s’ also written ‘Rupert B’ against ‘Michael will be back soon, but contemplates a reading-party with another undergrad in Dorset’. Was he right to associate Rupert Buxton with those references? Any thought as to whom my book might have belonged to? – I must admit it’s a fascinating sensation, going to read something and being aware of someone else’s underlinings and trying to see what they thought was important about that bit… (…)\n\nI must say that I entirely agree with the sentiment behind your thoughts on Michael’s death. It would be so much nicer to believe that Michael had committed suicide rather than that he was another victim of the ‘darlings of the gods die young’ theme. Something none of us will ever know, unfortunately. Did you ever discuss this with Jack and Peter – did they have any views on the subjects?\n\nDo read The Little White Bird, I thoroughly recommend it, and after all, it really is your book! Which reminds me, the ATV “Peter Pan”- something that you’ll find Andrew and I will disagree on, so I might as well have my say now! Yes, it has plenty of faults – Danny Kaye, however much one likes or dislikes him, will never ben ‘Captain Hook’. The trouble with it was that it was too closely linked to ‘Light Entertainment’! Newley & Bricusse read the play, went away and wrote the songs, and only then was a ‘writer’, almost in the variety sense of a ‘link-man’ sought, to, as it were, fit the play around the songs. Bear with me, don’t turn away in horror. Andrew quietly ‘wrote’ it with his American co-writer (who is basically a light entertainment/comedy writer), waited for the American to return whence he came… and then gradually re-wrote, re-organised or whatever, the whole thing – by this time he’d taken up the sort of ‘defender of the faith’ position. It was all great fun, and what better compliment to Barrie than for the first screening room to empty with practically the whole crew coming out saying ‘Great – when can we do another version… if only we could start at the beginning again.’ Very much a Barrie ‘amend, amend, amend’ attitude. I’m not saying watch it, but I am saying don’t automatically not watch it. Gary and Dwight, the Producer and Director, did, in my view, a good job of keeping as much pure Barrie as possible, given the American buyer of the show… and one must always remember the money man! The musical wasn’t great, but it was adequate, and so much better than the previous American, annual T.V. Peter Pan! I personally rate it for three main things – 1. The Narration (I could quite easily watch it to hear Gielgud alone, and Andrew put a lot of work into just the narration – you have no idea how hard we had to fight to keep ‘ever a dark and solitary enigma’ in “Gee, but what does it Mean to the mid-west.” A victory for us though!) 2. I think the relationship between Peter and Wendy works very well & 3. It is, after all, Peter Pan… I just can’t help enjoying it! This is all getting, dare I use the word, whimsical. I’ve had my say. It will be on television on Sunday, 19th February, at 7.30 pm. (…)\n\nNLD to SG 8/1/1976\n\nI fancy there are one or two questions I can answer this time: let’s see…\n\nMary Ansell books. The only one that I think I have here – which you’re very welcome to borrow – is Dogs & Men; I wouldn’t swear that I’d heard of the other two you mention and would be happy to swap-borrow Happy Houses if you’d like to bring it here on 24th.\n\nCharlie Chaplin. I doubt if you’ll be able to read my enclosed letter to The Times of a few years ago which I’ve just found in my wallet! The occasion was of course a fantastic one for 17 year old me: who had come back at the flat unexpectedly a night early so as to be with Uncle Jim an extra night before going back to Eton… much pleased Uncle Jim who was fixed for this Chaplin dinner at The Garrick, rang up E.V. Lucas who was arranging it, who found room for me! I sat between Lutyens and Frampton (who sculpted the Peter Pan statue) and personally had the time of my life tho’ the highest spots didn’t come till we had walked back later - J.M.B., C.C., Edward Knoblock and self – to the flat to be joined by G. du M: and in the next hour or two C.C. and G. du M. vied with each other in imitating this and that, acting this and that etc. Wholly entrancing. Uncle Jim was quite serious and would have loved to work somehow on how to get C.C. to be P.P.: Chaplin wrote about it in two books: bur the first (a rotten book) was the one I liked best because of the chapter he wrote called ‘I DINE WITH THE IMMORTALS’ and among the names (which of course he got from his menu!) was Mr Nicholas L Davies!\n\nJosephine Mitchell Innes was George’s ‘love’ – don’t forget he was only just out of his teens: the Mitchell Innes girls (I think a cousin among them rather than sisters) were obviously captivating to my family as not only George & Jack fell for them but also Gerald Millar (sp?) our much loved cousin. Many times we ragged them about the girls but I was too young for today’s memory. I’ve always ‘understood’ that at the time of George’s death in March 1915 he and Josephine had a sort of agreement between them to get married. Some years later I met – and talked of this with a sister of hers Elizabeth but I’ve lost all touch and doubt if any are alive. Certainly not Josephine. [I think there’ll be things about this family in Peter’s typescript of DAVIES LETTERS which you & Andrew will be taking from here]\n\nTho’ I remember the 3rd floor flat very well, and our first sight of the much larger one upstairs, I have no recollection at all of any ‘marathon move’: doubtless all took place when I was either at Eton or in Campden Hill Square… pretty sure I wasn’t involved with any movement of furniture or book!\n\nAudrey Lucas. As I think I told Andrew in my last letter – a propos of something Eiluned Lewis has said on the telephone – I had recently been having a little correspondence with Audrey, probably starting from writing to each other about Janet Dunbar’s book – which Audrey didn’t like, chiefly because it showed so little sign of Uncle Jim’s humour. Audrey died last year, up in the North of Scotland. She had something of a strange life …a big success with at least one novel … lived for some time with an actor … I think never married … I think one child… a pretty difficult upbringing with an enchanting mother and a wonderful company, ultra selfish father in E.V. We saw a lot of her ‘way back when’.\n\nYes – as I’ve told Andrew – Uncle Jim did get on with all his friends. Maurice Bridgeman (now Sir, and ex-head of B.P. and I would guess ultra pompous – never see him.) was the friend alluded to; his father being the late W.C. (?) Bridgeman M.P. who was later raised to the peerage. No, that Summer holiday at Stanway – some four months after Michael’s death – while certainly heave of heart for J.M.B. was wonderfully ‘run’ by Cynthia Asquith and for the rapidly recuperating younger generation there was a good deal of fun. I think I probably have a picture of Maurice Bridgeman and few of us at that time and place – I'll show if you.\n\nWhat little Uncle Jim saw of Rupert Buxton I’m sure he would have liked however strongly he let his thoughts rest on the growing up and away of Michael – on which ‘vital’ subject he naturally enough never spoke a word to me. (Or to anyone?)\n\nYour copy of the Letters is without doubt the copy that use to belong to Michael’s very great friend (of whom I’ve also written to Andrew) Roger Senhouse. Again, I have some Eilean Shona photographs including Roger, and his puppy who we called Rhona, maybe that R.B. is to do with the puppy’s name. Bring it with you. You’ll also see Audrey Lucas and the seven feet high perfect Etonian alluded to on p 183 of the Letters. One of the comic things about this book is that there are NO letters to Peter or me (or any of our family) tho’ we published the book! Sort of the opposite of having our cake and eating it! Peter & I each shrunk from having our letters published, knowing how much Uncle Jim would have shuddered – and yet we published the book. I suppose better than letting someone else do it.\n\nI will have talked with Peter about the possibilities of Michael’s suicide – I doubt with Jack. Whatever reaction there was I cannot remember, but I’m sure enough that they’d be along the lines of ‘one can never know… I’m apt to doubt it’ – Certainly no convictions either way.\n\nI’ve read The Little White Bird. I don’t think I’d read before any bit except for the P.P. in K.G. bit. I found many bits of typically wonderful stuff, a moderate amount of indigestible treacle, and I did get a bit less interested towards the end. But I’m indeed glad I read it and it does throw many a gleam on the birth and growing pains of Peter Pan. I had more than one surprise at finding obviously the first mention of this phrase and that which got into the play.\n\nYesterday I spent a long time listening to a 24 year old bearded American idealist – who, did I tell you?, is aiming to produce 75 years of Peter Pan book etc. He gave me a horrifying account of the current Lulu-Ron Moody affair … Danny Kaye I’m sure enough will ham Hook to Hell. And I gather he’s a blonde rather than black-avized Hook. He could have been made first class, but only under J.M.B.’s (or any!) iron rules. Which I doubt Moody could. I shall certainly look at 7.30 pm on Sunday 29 Feb and only pray ‘the Brothers’ haven’t returned to BBC1!\n\nSG to NLD 13/1/1976\n\n(…)\n\nMany thanks for it, & the clipping which I certainly was able to read. Will return clipping to you on 24th if that’s alright. Where to being with this letter?...\n\nBarrie got on well with all your friends – how did you get on with all his? The impression I get is that Barrie put his friends very much in compartments, quite naturally. (Lewises, Olivers i.e. ‘family’ friends; his aristocratic associates; Kirriemuir people; literary & newspaper men; people of the theatre; etc. etc.). Did you & Michael find it easy to mix with, and adapt to, these different groups or did you find there was any set of his associates with whom you regarded a dinner of whatever as ‘duty’? Or did Barrie tend not to socialise so much when his two special people were home for the holidays?\n\nA small ‘continuity’ detail which occurred to me this morning (…) – did any or all of you boys smoke – or had Barrie’s cough put you off the idea?!\n\nThe famous notebooks – did Barrie always carry his notebook with him & take it out to jot down speech or incidents that arrested him, or did he set aside a writing time when the notebooks were the first step in collecting his thoughts. Was that amusing ‘keep talking & I’ll stop you when I’ve got an article’ attitude you were aware was always there? Did he discuss the ‘the art of writing’ with you and Michael? How much did he influence Michael’s writing? Eilured Hendry had some letters Michael had written to her & Andrew & I were struck by the similarity to Barrie’s letters. Months ago I was looking through some of the old Eton College Chronicles of the time when Michael was joint editor & one bit leapt out & hit me, I was so sure it must been Michael. It’s an imaginary thing about an old boy leaving the school to his juniors –\n\n“We think we see a curious sort of place, the same & yet hardly the same, a curious emptiness & unreality about it. There doesn’t seem to be much going on in the way of work or games really, as a matter of fact we think we see a kind of wizened creature, once boyish enough no doubt, emerging from the same places we know nowadays, probably in search of some sort of food; but, mind you, we don’t know at all – we only think.” What do you think?\n\nDid Barrie ever hint to you that he would have like to write something about Michael? How seriously do you think he toyed with the idea of writing his autobiography – and what a fascinating document that would have been!\n\nWhen I read your last letter to Andrew I got to the Roger Senhouse bit &, with great excitement, realised it was the end of my detective game! I also realised that Andrew & I had been asking you very much the same things at the same time. Sorry if I bored you – it was coincidence, we hadn’t specifically been discussing friends, Audrey Lucas or whatever.\n\n(…)\n\nNLD to SG 17/1/1976\n\n(…)\n\nBarrie and ‘his’ friends. (…) as best as I can answer I would say he would be apt to entertain his Kirriemuir friends (if and when he did!) when we were away: used to talk about same often – particularly Robb and his canary – but I never met him or ‘them’: if Principal Irvine was coming from St Andrews I could well be there … probably for lunch: theatrical friends I would nearly always be there and I have wonderful ‘lunch’ memories of such as Karsavina, Gloria Swanson, Julia James etc: Gilmour, always there – and as and when J.M.B wanted to talk ‘business’ they would go to the study and I elsewhere… all (this I want to stress) wholly normal. As Cynthia began to move in, and the occasional dinner party came round, I’d as likely as not opt out… just meet, say, Churchill or Haig and then take myself to a movie. I can’t remember sitting down to any such meal at the flat. (God be praised?!) I think it fair to say that 9 1/2 times out of 10 Uncle Jim would know who Michael & I would get on with and who would bore us (and vice versa) and no one ever found a suggestion of a problem here. Less, rather than more, I would say I found Uncle Jim’s ‘friends’ a bore, than most sons would find their father’s friends a bore! Occasionally when his sister came along one of us brothers might pull a lugubrious face at the other but we (really) liked her and certainly got more of a giggle than a grunt. If you remind me I’ll give you an imitation of her! There was NEVER a ‘duty’ to anyone. Uncle Jim really didn’t ‘socialise’ as I understand the word: every now and then, off to dinner, a club, possibly a week end, but very rarely and sometimes I’d be asked, sometimes he’d know I wouldn’t be interested, but always I again assure you NO PROBLEM!\n\nSmoking! Again no problem! His ‘terrifying’ cough had no effect on us. I used to enjoy it. We all of us smoked: not like chimneys – till later on, maybe! And always, in the Halcyon days, Turkish! The sort we nearly always had – certainly 1922-1926 days – was ORCILLA … a sort of off-shoot of BALKAN SOBRANIE. (I didn’t touch gaspers till marriage …rapidly smoked on & on, became a 40 a day, stopped [with ease] overnight and haven’t smoked for 5 years). (…) In other words “Not put off the idea, by his cough’.\n\nNotebooks. Were wholly unaware of their existence till Mackail’s book. We never\n\ndiscussed his writing, or indeed seldom if we thought of it, till years later… after his death, I suppose. It’s perhaps important for you and Andrew to realise that my whole genuine attitude to Uncle Jim is as a beloved very close ‘relative’ NOT an author.\n\nHe never – with me, anyway – discussed ‘writing’! I think he had much effect on Michael’s writing and to lesser extent (because I’m a lesser person) on my own. Yes, Michael’s editorials to the E.C.C. were obviously affected by J.M.B.: so were his letters; so, to a lesser extent are/were my own: my everyday letters to Uncle Jim, or rather his to me, could contain a half or less than a line, but occasionally quite a few lines, which would strike some dim chord in my mind, and I ‘KNOW’ that much of what I think, say, or write, stems from Uncle Jim. But he never – so far as I can remember … and I would bet ‘never’ – talked to me of writing either his own autobiography or something about Michael. He used, on several occasions I think, to discuss his ideas for stories or plays with Michael: particularly he was anxious to write a thriller either in book or show: and Michael always told him he was any good at that sort of thing – hence the ‘death’ of a play about a Mr Lapraik to which I can find no reference in Mackail! but which I remember Uncle Jim accepting Michael’s thumbs down. I was never to reach such terms – literary wise – with J.M.B. (or with anyone else!).\n\nGetting back for a moment to the ‘socialising’: a bit difficult to be precise or certain. Undoubtedly JMB became more snobbish in his later days: probably – as Lady Astor used to say – due more to Lady Cynthia Asquith than to anyone else, but maybe stemming from star days and his aiming at helping either Michael and me, or later just me, mix more easily with the upper set! On a few occasions a titled beauty or two would come for supper, or I’d go and stay a week end with him at some stately home… I fitted in there better than anyone else! But I think I was always more extroverted than the others: a bit less shy, shall we say. Particularly after poor Michael died and my bright light was less dimmed: no one could compete with him!\n\nSG to NLD 26/1/1976\n\nMany many thanks for a wonderful day last Saturday. Please pass on my thanks to Mary for everything. (…)\n\nPerhaps I should do this thing ‘properly’ and give you an ‘inventory’ of the treasures we took away with us! So here goes:\n\nPeter’s ‘Davies Letters’; 1 brown leatherbound JMB Sylvia photographs book; 1 ‘sunny memories’ photo album; 1 canvas bound photo album with loose enclosures; 1 Kodak photo album; P. P stills; photograph of Adelphi flat; photograph of Barrie & Michael on lawn; Greedy Dwarf programme; Red Eve; 2 ‘confession’ books; Complete Billiard Player with scores in back; 1 wooden box containing letters. (…)\n\nI also forgot to ask you if you could give me the addresses for Gerrie and Daphne & Angela du Maurier, in the hope that we get a chance to get down to Cornwall at some stage – a much more appealing spot than Kirriemuir! Also, do you by any chance have an address for Anne Fleming?\n\nThere are obviously lots of things better left until we talk again next time, and of course there are bound to be plenty of questions arising from all the marvellous new things we have to read, but, if you don’t mind, I’ll mention of or two things now which I think might be easier to have a think about and drop me a note. For example, things Barrie liked to read. I have got the impression that Emily Bronte would rank as probably his favourite author. Am I correct? Did he ever, in your hearing, say anything about why he liked ‘Wuthering Heights’. I know why I like it, just wondered if he ever made any comments. You told Andrew, I think, that of Hardy’s novels, Jude was his favourite. Just how important a figure was Hardy in the story? I love the very “Barrie’ line in a letter to Cynthia “Hardy took me yesterday to the place where he is to be buried, and to-day he took me to see the place where he would like best next to be buried.” Did you meet Hardy, I’m sure you must have? What did you think of him? How did Cynthia get on with him? I know Barrie and Cynthia visited Max Gate shortly after Michael died. Somehow my picture of Hardy is not that of a man who I see fitting into the ‘Cynthia’ scene. Meredith obviously was a good friend – have you any comments on him? I’m trying to think of other contemporary names who I don’t remember cropping up – Swinburne, did he ever meet/read/comment on him? Kipling he obviously knew, but how well? I rather get the impression, not close at all.\n\nAnother thought. Mackail stresses heavily the parallel between the Tommy/Elspeth set up and Barrie and Maggie. Were you aware of a special sister/brother relationship, or was this all ‘novelist’s licence’ as it were? Did he ever talk about the death of the first Winter brother? Presumably there was a time when the Winters apparent annual visits to the flat coincided with your holidays, or was this all after you were married and away? What did you think of them?\n\nBarrie’s attraction towards beautiful women – did his ‘flirtations’ ever seem ‘over the top’ or embarrass you? Did he turn his charm on women with the same confidence that he turned it on children, and do you think it is fair to say the compliments etc. were all part of a studied act, an act which he of course enjoyed. I would tend to assume that he kept good control of such conversations, friendships etc., would I be right? – or was there ever an element of the silly little man making a fool of himself type of reaction from his associates.\n\nHow close were you to Elizabeth Lucas? What sort of woman was she?\n\n(…)\n\nNLD to SG 30/1/1976\n\n(…)\n\nI gave Andrew address and telephone numbers of the three in Cornwall and await word from all of you when you’d like me to write more fully to Angela & Daphne (…). Wait till our next letter (…) about Anne Fleming: she’s in constant touch with our brother-in-law Hilary Bray, who lives with us here: he returns from Switzerland tomorrow and will give me Annie’s address: Hilary and Ian were close friends. I’ve personally never liked Anne: very good company, very clever, very like her aunt Cynthia in many ways tho’ I personally think has been more nymphomaniacal in her time! Don’t let Hilary see this! I fancy she won’t have too nice things to say about the Barrie invasion of Stanway, and am inclined to think her as not worth a visit, from Andrew’s point of view, anyway! Cynthia’s sister, Lady May Lyon, tho’ must be 80 plus now, I think still lives at Apperley Court nr Tewkesbury: she, post Michael’s death, would have good memories – particularly of Stanway times. I gave Andrew a few other names, more may occur tho’ I think you’ll have had most of the possibly worth while ones by now.\n\nBarrie’s reading. True enough we talked a lot of Wuthering Heights and I would think Catherine could be his favourite heroine; yet I would plump for Scott as his No 1 author for reading and re-reading. I can’t remember his favourite tho’ I would guess either Redgauntlet or The Heart of Midlothian; Meredith, particularly Evan Harrington & Richard Feverel (but I may be wrong there). In all this sort of things it should be Michael supplying the answers… he was a prolific and thoroughly intelligent reader from a very early age whereas I started late and have always known how ill-read I am compared with what I should be and should been… I used to be their despair as I continued with either Comic Cuts or Dr Fu Manchu longer than I should. Yet, as I have said; Uncle Jim’s intense pleasure as I was set Stevenson’s The Black Arrow as a holiday task at Wilkinson’s was such that he spent hours making out a terrific exam paper for me of 100’s of questions and went round & round the Round Pond with me, so that I won the prize! Fearfully keen on Stevenson of course. He did read a great deal, mostly the classics. Very occasionally a modern novel. No: it was Hardy himself who liked Jude the best: J.M.B.’s two favourites were The Woodlanders and The Return of the Native, with a particular soft place I his heart for the first chapter in The Mayor of Casterbridge. Vanity Fair he loved, strangely I can’t remember about Dickens tho’ feel sure he’d have loved Pickwick and more particularly David Copperfield – and – so different – Tale of Two Cities i.e. NOT a complete Dickens-lover such as Bernard Darwin but certainly with great admiration for him. But – how awful is memory – I can’t remember talking to him about Shakespeare! Somehow I feel his taste must have been like mine i.e. worshipping the Tragedies, not so drawn to the comedies except for Midsummer Night Dream … (…)\n\nI personally can’t see Cynthia with Hardy… I doubt if the three were ever in a room together. Hardy I met once or twice and of course trembled at the times with worship most of the time! (I often play the game with myself ‘who is the greatest person you’ve ever met’ – knowing how fantastically above average my meeting with so-called greats have been – and Hardy always leads, if only by a short lead over Churchill and Chaplin!) I told Andrew some time ago, I think, of my worst priggish story which was then Uncle Jim offered me as a 17th or 18th birthday present the choice between a motor-bike and a complete set of Thomas Hardy: I chose, promptly enough, the latter! And have never repented – till at age 37 I was made to ‘learn’ the motorbike in the Army as the Grenadier Guards became mechanised! I’ve NEVER been so frightened. One day when Hardy was having a meal at the flat I asked him which was his own favourite novel and when he said he thought Jude, I got hold of my copy and there is his signature… meant to show it to you! My other vivid memory of him – as I also told Andrew, I’m sure – was taking him to a rehearsal at the Haymarket of Mary Rose: we were sitting in the stall side box and T.H. was wearing rather a wide, sombrero-like homburg hat: for some reason he was suspected of being an Australian newspaper reporter and they tried to sling him out of the theatre until I remonstrated that he was Mr Thomas Hardy! He was delighted and wrote a nice little poem about it – not about the theatrical eviction so much as a night of ‘Mary Rose’. He was a dear ‘little man’… unlike Shaw or Wells … Galsworthy I liked. As for JMB himself? I’d say his likes were ‘as mine’. He was very fond of T.H. but I would hazard the guess that (JMB was younger, of course) Meredith and Stevenson mean more in his life. Incidentally he much like Conan Doyle and Quiller Couch, neither of whom I met. Meredith was dead before I came on the scene, but I was ‘brought up’ on a photograph of G.M. and J.M.B. and Uncle Jim clearly worshipped him. [A.E.W. Mason was a very close friend at one time].\n\nSwinburne rings no bell at all. Kipling we met once, at the Royal Albion Hotel in Brighton. I would say not a friend, an acquaintance – with certainly literary respect form J.M.B.’s side. I wasn't drawn to him at all – but I was pretty young. Wells came to Stanway, during my school years: I remember being most unattracted! And would swear that Uncle Jim did not like him personally tho’ one has read differently. H.G.W. got a bit shirty when J.M.B. trashed him at croquet! The only thing I can remember of my conversation with him was, as we walked through one of the gardens and passed some ‘Mullein’, he said ‘my father always told me Mullein was the best cure for piles’!\n\nThe Writers. I’m sure Mackail is right in stressing the similarity or parallel between Tommy/Elspeth and himself and Maggie. I saw a great deal of ‘Maggie’ and her husband had have quite a few stories. I was going to give you an imitation of her…! I heard a great deal – presumably only from Uncle Jim – about the most tragic death of her bridegroom to be, and the ‘acceptance’ of the latter’s brother, William: whose eventual funeral was attended by Peter and me and Gen. Freyberg (of whom we haven’t yet talked, but who became a biggish figure in J.M.B.’s life.) And these two Winters had one son, Willie, who (a) was a chess champion (2) went to gaol for a bit (can’t remember why!) (c) came much into our lives during the Scottish years at Scourie and Killiecrankie in particular... can’t remember him in the Outer Hebrides. Dead now, an extraordinary chap… the best story of whom is coarse, or un-writeable, and connected closely with the sublime Harry Brown (J.M.B.s’ first butler) … or did I tell you the other day? I could talk about the Winters as well as imitating Maggie! Remind me of Rat catching, Come-for-the Worms, Galsworthy says I’ve the most beautiful voice, Nicholas of the lovely eyes, Gold near Stanway.\n\nWhat’s so difficult/impossible: you say sister/brother relationship: suggests reasonable ‘sentence’, yet my relationship with J.M.B. would be – shall we say?! – unusual. I’ve known – as we all have – a lot of brothers and sisters: yet I shall never know as strange a couple as James Matthew and Margaret (whatever) Barrie. I was fond of her, even tho’ I spent too many unattractive youthful moments pulling her leg in different directions. But in fact I liked them all.\n\nBarrie’s ‘flirtatiousness’ never embarrassed me: I thought, on occasions, it was ridiculous: a bit different, particularly as 9 times out of 10 the recipient of the flirtatious enjoyed it all. Some – my Mary, maybe? – thought it absurd: others – Peter’s wife, maybe? – thought, however ridiculous, I’ll play up to it! But I certainly never got near the stage of thinking ‘Silly little man making a fool of himself’. I think he thought he could make himself more or less irresistible… Well, he could from all points of view except sexual.\n\nElizabeth Lucas. A particularly enchanting person. ‘Charm’ is a tricky word… she had a basinful. Also, of course, exceptionally with it, or on the spot, or intelligent. If only she had felt it worthwhile, or had the energy, or simply the real interest (much as she truly loved J.M.B.) to look after him, and thus kept Cynthia out of the way, how better in many ways things could have been. She didn’t have too easy a life: E.V., chock full of brain and humour but utterly selfish, was the wrong husband to anyone… I – we – used to like her enormously… the games we used to play etc... but he didn’t make Elizabeth’s life all that easy. It went to pieces. We used to see a lot of their daughter, Audrey, and even up to last year (when Audrey died) she & I exchanged letters. J.M.B. loved Elizabeth, as we all did: but she left the door open to Cynthia. (…)\n\nSG to NLD 5 February 1976\n\n(…) Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think one of the things which have not covered so far is the ‘you cad’ story. Peter’s note on the reference in a letter to George of ‘Personally I think boys are often better judges of man and motives than the man of boys and their motives. Something of the child remains in them to make them see very clearly – children sometimes bore down to the soul. Nico for instance.’ Reminded me that it was something I’d meant to ask last time. Is this possible of a written answer or is it too long, and better to wait until next time?\n\nPeter’s notes on the letters are marvellous. Wonderful book – wonderful man. When did he start writing this collection, do you know? I take it that I’m right in assuming that you had volume four typed up after his death – did you edit it at all, it reads very well to have been taken from random notes? I’ve just finished reading it – well late last night actually, and I was very deeply moved by it all. The picture of George emerges so clearly. You mentioned before about the time when Peter was with an older woman and estranged from Barrie. Was this before Michael died? I hope the estrangement wasn’t for long. I wouldn’t have thought that Peter was the sort of man to harbour grudges, but perhaps I’m wrong.\n\nThank you for all the suggested people to contact. I’ll start writing around. I’ll write to Gerrie and give her the opportunity to put her views on Jack and Barrie, for reasons both of courtesy and interest. She may feel that she has nothing to say but then again…. I also thought that it might be a nice idea to drop a line to Peter’s children, really just to inform them that we are doing something that will include their father as a character. Would it be possible for you to let me have their addresses. (…)\n\nA small point I reminded myself to ask you – am I right that Jack’s Timothy was born in the same month that Michael was killed? Would you happen to remember his birthday?\n\nIf I may throw another Mackail quote at you: ‘Barrie could always hide his sorrows from children, and it was still very difficult for him not to play with any little boys whom he met’. But his sorrows were very great indeed. How did he appear to manage to hide them? I would have that it would have taken more than ears, eyebrows and funny expressions. Was there any ‘routine-type dialogue’ when Barrie met a child for the first time. Were there any running gags etc. you remember from your childhood, jokes he played over and over again, or anything like that. Can you remember any special phrases he would use when talking to a child as opposed to an adult. Did he put on an act, a different face or whatever, or did he treat children like adults. (…)\n\nAs I think we all agreed when we met, unrelieved tragedy is not as moving as tragedy/humour. Can you think of any amusing stories, perhaps ‘lighter’, is a better word, from the times just after the deaths of Arthur, Sylvia, George, and Michael? How would Barrie have attempted to lift you boys out of your sorrow (…)? People with problems tended to confide in him – did he have any set ways of trying to make them laugh. Can you think of any incidents at any of these times which might have suddenly happened and for some reason appealed to his sense of humour, thereby lightening the gloom? Any examples of that wonderful wit; affective when most needed? What sort of sense of humour did Brown have – would it be a natural thing for him and Barrie to share the odd joke? Were there any people that Barrie liked seeing not necessarily because he liked them, but because he could laugh at them… anyone you all laughed at together, or any one who would be guaranteed to bring light relief.\n\n(…)\n\nI love the continued references in George’s letters to his mother about his different coloured socks and his caterpillars – anything to add?\n\n(…)\n\nNLD to SG 9/2/1976\n\n(…) Before I try to answer this and fail over that, and in case I forget to mention this to Andrew (…), two points about Trilby as shown on TV a couple of weeks ago – did you see it? First, and less ‘Important’ have you by chance seen Daphne du Maurier’s letter in the current ‘Radio Times’, p 51; second: in my view the Trilby, Sinead Cusack, was so du Maurier that she would be ideal for Sylvia in Andrew’s trilogy… tho’ I know he’s at present (maybe quite correctly) sold on Mia Farrow. Just worth bearing in mind, perhaps.\n\n‘You Cad’. In its way this is an awful story, tho’ in later years it used to give Peter a lot of devilish delight! The scene was the dining room at 23 Compton Hill Squ. I think breakfast-ish: company J.M.B., all the brothers, possibly excepting Jack: date I don’t know, but if Peter’s ‘almost a certainty’ in the reference to which you refer is correct, it would be autumn of 1911: Uncle Jim had just returned from America and we were all peppering him with questions as he ate his breakfast. I, and about 7 or 8, suddenly hurled at him ‘How was Maudie?’ meaning Maude Adams, to whom Uncle Jim always referred to as ‘Miss Adams’. Uncle Jim’s almost incomprehensible reaction was immediate: looking at me with the very depth of contempt he just said ‘you cad’ which plunged me into a paroxysm of tears and I buried my head in Peter’s lap on a sofa. I can’t recall at all if there were any apologies, but I know all sympathy (even from Michael!) were for me this time. The point, I suppose, is my telling you and Andrew this story is to show that with all the humour and intense and sympathetic kindness, he could be cruel for brief moments on rare occasions and when he was, he was all the more withering to sensitive souls! But, as perhaps Peter hints in his use of the words ‘immortal episode’ Peter during the time we worked together and saw so much of each other was constantly saying ‘You Cad!’ to annoy me.\n\nI’m so glad – tho’ not remotely surprised – you think so much of Peter’s ‘notes’… I think they are marvellous. I’m not sure whether you’ve tackled the lot, or only the slimmed vol. on George; which last book I had typed from his pencilled written ‘first draft’ and added no editing of my own except I think adding either one or two letters from myself to George at the front.\n\nPeter’s ‘other woman’. May he forgive me for talking about it/her! It had the greater effect on his existence. I don’t know when they met, but it would either be towards the end of the war, 1918, or possibly 1917. She was a very talented artist, a good bit older than Peter, married and with a daughter, I don’t know if her husband was alive. Let’s call her Vera, which was her name! I first knew about her – shocking but not untypical ‘schoolboy’ story – through cribbing a letter or two left lying about by Michael when we share a room at Eton … large handwriting, in a sort of purple ink, I would guess scented! (I’ve never told anyone about this.) Peter entirely loved her, and I would say it was entirely mutual. When he was demobilised they set up house together and they lived together for a number of years. Certainly in Epping, maybe London before that. I think his first business was to do with old furniture etc. For one reason or another this was extremely upsetting to J.M.B. well, it would be to any guardian with a couple of younger brothers to think of etc. I remember Uncle Him taking me to lunch with them in Epping but I can recall no details, which seem rather scarce. I saw Vera from time to time and much liked her. The so-called break came after Michael was drowned: but it was really Vera insisting that Peter should not throw his whole life away etc. Heaven knows (I never really spoke about it) how painful the parting will have been: but Peter greatly helped save J.M.B.’s reason and from the moment he entered the book trade they obviously had an extra bit in common. Vera did not cut herself right out, in fact she illustrated many of the books that made Peter’s name as a publisher of exquisite taste if poor sales! Then of course Mary got married in 1926 and Peter was best man and six years later Peter utterly astounded me with the news that he’d got himself engaged to one of the Ruthven twins! Peter, of all people … utterly unsocial unlike me, in those days, and a Ruthven twin! Most social of all. I gave it a couple of months if they ever reached the altar. Could I have been more wrong. It was a marvellous marriage from every point of view: only spoilt by her leaning towards the melancholic side whereas he should have had someone to tell him to snap out of it.\n\nThere was, I’m pretty sure, NEVER any grudge from Peter’s side: a perpetual (?) grudge – against Vera, or God, or life i.e. NOT against Peter – from Uncle Jim’s.\n\nDid I quote you or Andrew from Gerrie’s letter to me? I think not. “I would welcome a visit from Andrew Birkin – particularly as Janet Dunbar’s book about J.M.B. rankled in small ways, and I couldn’t bear anything to out on T.V. that didn’t do justice to you all.” I don’t know what rankled! But she will be eager to see you both. And may well throw open a hidden door somewhere. She’ll give you Timmy’s birthday: Looking at Mackail (p. 563) it looks very like synchronising with Michael’s drowning. Don’t ask Gerrie too much about Mary Hodgson!\n\nThe du Mauriers will also welcome you. Perhaps I should write first to Angela: I said a word or two to Daphne on the telephone and I know they’ll each do their best to help. I don’t think Jeanne is ‘necessary’ a bit young for useful dope, but of course she’d love to come along if Angela or Daphne think it useful.\n\nAnne Fleming I would say NO interest before 19??.\n\nI would say Barrie was such a consummate actor that he could hide his ‘very great’ sorrows from children – and grown-ups – 19 times out of 20. He really loved children, I think, and it was as if a sort of switch was turned on and the light came forth, irrespective of ears and eyebrows. There was no routine. Different apparently each time, tho’ the same jokes would reappear like the single false tooth cracking against the wall, or by throwing a stamp up to the ceiling. On the whole I would say he treated children if not like adults, as adolescents, as – anyway – a bit older than they really were which would go to the heads of most children.\n\nI don’t think he would ever come out with a funny story to lift either boy or man out of sorrow. He would be a little short of a ‘master’ at getting on to a subject of interest to his listener… if an amusing incident connected with this subject occurred to him he would know if/how/ when to bring it out. But even by being sad with you, he made you that little bit less sad. (…) He had a glorious, but very different, humour.\n\n(PS) Leave Peter’s sons until we meet. I think only the eldest, Rivvy, could be ‘desirable’… don’t know where the others are just as now. Maybe best if I write.\n\nSG to NLD 12/2/1976\n\n(…) I got a lovely letter from Gerrie this morning offering us her help. (…) As you very kindly suggest writing an introduction to Angela before I contact her and Daphne I thought I would aim to drop them a letter towards the next week. (…)\n\nAlso, I got very nice letters this morning from Lord Boothby and Sir Roger Chance – I’ll give them both a ring tomorrow, they both live in Eaton Square so we can really call round and see them any time. My fourth letter was from Sir John Masterman: “Michael Llewelyn Davies made a wonderful impression as an undergraduate of what a lively young man could be but more than that I cannot say. … I knew both him and his unlucky companion and of course Edward Marjoribanks who was devastated by that tragedy… I doubt if I can dredge up anything from my memory which would really help you, except the belief that it is quite uncertain which of the two was attacked by cramp and which tried to save the other.” Who was Edward Marjoribanks – the name rings rather a large bell but I can’t seem to find where I’ve heard it before? Do you the might be worth trying to contact, if he’s still alive? And then, of course, your letter. What a wonderful post!\n\nI would be most grateful if you could drop a note to Rivvy and/or Peter’s other children. I do feel that it is important that they are in the picture, even if they feel they have nothing more to contribute.\n\nI do know what you mean about the Sinead Cusack look. I rather thought that myself at the time, but I do agree with Andrew that Mia does so have that ‘happy’ yet ‘haunted’ look – ‘the most heart-rending and heart-piercing expression that you had ever seen’ (p.271 Mackail). It’s certainly a very good thought to keep in mind. Yes, I saw Trilby and enjoyed it very much, I also enjoyed Daphne’s very good letter.\n\nSo, having given you our news to date, may I now ask you one or two things (…). Firstly, would it be possible to give us some sort of description of a typical afternoon’s cricket with Barrie and any amusing incidents related to this that you might be able to think of. We’re very anxious to get this ‘cricket background’ accurate.\n\nAndrew has been to Campden Hill Square (…) and when we spoke today there were one or two things that he mentioned that I said I would include in this letter as I was sitting down to write to you. No. 23 is being redecorated at the moment but he did manage to have a look round and there was a settle there, practically identical to the one from the Adelphi which is now in the Kirriemuir museum. The owner of 23 said that it came with the house – is it possible that this had been Barrie’s at one time (I had rather got the impression that all the furniture from 23 had been put into storage until it was sold)? They are reconditioning one of the beams and on it was found to be written something about ‘beauty is truth, truth is (something), (something) is love’ – I don’t think I’ve quoted that properly, but does it happen to ring any bells? From Peter’s notes we understand that you and Mary lived at 22 for many years. How badly bombed were those houses – i.e. they look as if they are still very much as they were in 1910, could this be possible. The local vicar who happened to be wandering around at the time, told Andrew that there was an “ancient custom” in Campden Hill Square connected with Barrie – on Christmas eve, or thereabouts, all the houses put lighted candles in their windows and it is something to do with Wendy. Does this mean anything to you? His final observation was – how did you manage to play cricket in the Gardens there, with the terrific slope? (That ‘his’ being A. not the vicar!)\n\nI thought the ‘you cad’ story was marvellous – but it does seem an incomprehensible reaction’ on the part of Barrie. Could there have been any sort of ‘emotional attachment’ on the part of Barrie, towards ‘Miss Adams’? We rather had the impression that she was very much “Frohman’s” actress.\n\nHow common was it for actresses to call in and see Barrie socially at the flat (e.g. the story of Pauline Chase calling in to show him her wedding dress) and were you boys often witnesses to these visits? If so, was the talk ‘business’, or if not, what sorts of other subjects would tend to come up. I realise this would depend on the individual, but perhaps there might be some people you could associate with certain subjects of conversations, and I suppose I’m not only thinking of actresses now.\n\n(…)\n\nNLD to SG 17/2/1976\n\nI’ve just written to Angela, so she should be ready to ‘answer’ you: saying you were vaguely thinking of around the weekend of 6 March. I’ll write later to Rivvy and suggest he tells his brothers: and that if he’d like & see you that you’d be very pleased to see him, but I doubt if he’d make a move in that direction. (I could be wrong!)\n\nI was particularly glad you had a nice letter from Gerrie. It should be well worth asking Gerrie which of her (attractive) furniture came from 23 C.H. Square. I’m pretty sure they got most of it. I don’t think I got any! I think Gerrie has at least one of the sofas out of the drawing room tho’ whether or not the one I flung myself into after ‘you cad’ I can’t remember!\n\nAnd also delighted that Boothby & Chance are playing up. Boothby I’ve only met the once and he wouldn’t remember; but Roger you must certainly give my love to … (…) I vividly remember walking some 5 or 6 miles from Amhuinnsuidh Castle, with George, to meet Roger as he arrived for a short fishing holiday in 1912. And I published a book by him shortly before I retired… we lunched quite frequently. And I was of course very interests in Sir J. Masterman’s comments and quite understand his not being able further to help.\n\nEdward Marjoribanks. Very clever. Q.C. or K.C. I fancy. Became celebrated as an author particularly his brilliant Life of Marshall Hall: followed by Carson which he didn’t finish editing or ‘correcting’ as he – Marjoribanks committed suicide. Shame how many of that age – the clever ones – did. I think there may have been a girl in the story, but he was of the stuff that suicides are made of. ‘Clarence” he was known as. Captain of the School at Eton, best friend of Michael’s, half-brother of the present Hailsham – also brilliantly clever ‘Capt of the School’ as Hogg. (…)\n\nCampden Hill Square. I’m sure NO furniture remained in the house from our day. I can’t remember if you know that Mary and I returned to 22 – next door – Oh yes, I see this is ‘mentioned in Peter’s notes’. No bells ring with ‘Beauty is truth’ etc. They may have been installed by the artist who lived there when Mary & I ‘returned’: Sir Harold Speed. [I think he was ‘Sir’]. We knew them quite well, and several times went in 23. He had made our drawing room, his studio. We were very friendly. The bomb was terrible: 21 August 1944. I saw it as I was emerging from the Dorchester after lunch. I was stationed at Leconfield House in London District at the time and part of my job was locating all the VI’s: I was on duty that night, and living at home, and my journey back for bath and supper became a nightmare you may imagine. I won’t go on with this part of it now. I don’t know how badly 23 was damaged – about the same as us maybe tho’ 23 was a tidge nearer the bomb. Our top storey had to go, & be replaced. I don’t think 23 was quite as smashed as this and suppose something ‘protected’ I think our top storey was well put back: and I don’t think there were any awful replacements anywhere along the top – all that ruins it today is of course the endless cars. All empty then in our happy days – both 1907 and 1937. The Christmas Eve candles have nothing whatsoever to do with Peter and Wendy! So do stories grow!! The idea came from a dear American lady called Mrs Fletcher who lived at No 52, the house where Fraser lives and opposite which the bomb went off the other day. I think it’s an American custom – tho it could originate from Germany. This never happened up to 1918 but when Mary & I came back in 1937 and thence on, every Christmas Eve we had these candles. Really rather attractive and wonderful on a nice night – helped with a cocktail or sherry or two! Still, let’s let the local vicar continue to wander.\n\nCricket in the square. The hill is say North to South (or rather South to North, looking down): our wooden charts were East (bat) facing West (bowler)! As often as not the ball (probably tennis) went into the bushes or beds and the bat rushed between the chairs while the fielder (probably the bowler himself) hunted into the bushes! Always played toward the bottom of the square. If anything could be called vital about the J.M.B. cricket I suppose it’s that he was left-handed! Where his keenness really I can’t tell you … presumably in Scotland yet this is hardly the place. Perhaps when he came up (or down) as far as Nottingham. He was always fascinated by it, and by cricketers, I can’t tell you why. But great cricketers and knowledgeable ones came to love him from Macartney & Carus to you-name-him. This love of cricket seemed to grow, and I’m sure I had a closer view of this than George who was the most successful of us at Lords with a very fine 59. But his letters, particularly to Turley Smith and his reaction to my knowledge of how to lift him from the depths never waned in cricket interest. Have I told you of his final hat trick with the last three balls he bowled in 1924? Or of his own verdict on the very slowness of his own bowling?\n\nBack to ‘You Cad’. No – I’m sure no emotional attachment to Maude Adams, but a great admiration. The best way I can attempt to ‘explain’ it would be his ‘over-proper’ (non-existent!) knowledge of ‘how to behave’ i.e. ‘Miss Adams’ with a little bow, and maybe, one hand behind the back … only the street-cads would say Maudie or Glad or Share! He was sort of out Etonianing the believed Etonian Gentleman! You don’t blow your nose, without a handkerchief, over the ? skirt – you don’t say How’s Maudie! Something like that, I fancy.\n\nMost actresses would only come in reply to a suggestion they might discuss some future part etc. I doubt if any came in without an introduction unless they by chance heard of a possibility of a revival of, say, Quality Street: but even then I would bet they would get an introduction rather than invite themselves. I’ve met several there, but then of course always after an invitation to lunch or something. The ‘subject’ would most largely depend on Uncle Jim’s mind at the moment – unless it was mine! Which 9 times out of 10 he would follow up with enthusiasm.\n\nSG to NLD 21/2/1976\n\n(…)\n\nAndrew and I made a quick trip to Hampstead Church Yard this afternoon. It looks a very likely spot for a quick bit of location filming. If I may ask a morbid question, whose decision was it that Michael was buried while your parents had been cremated? Any idea where Trixie was buried, we couldn’t find her with the du Mauriers? (…)\n\nI think it might be an idea for me to put on paper (…) a few thoughts on the Boothby theme! All evidence would point towards Oxford not being a happy time in Michael’s life. I read, very quickly, the chapter in Hugh Macnaughten’s book on ‘Michael Davies” – I might be getting a bit confused but is it true that Michael actually resigned, as it were, from Oxford and then was kindly let back? If this is the case, were you aware of the turmoil, or what triggered it off? Andrew, I believe, is going to send you a copy of my Boothby Notes. There is, I’m sure, a great deal of ‘possessiveness’ in what Boothby says. He is an extreme of opinion which I’m very glad that we have registered nevertheless. I must say I admired his honesty – I did feel that he was trying to be ‘honest’, i.e. he believed very much in what he was saying. To me, the simplest breakdown of what he said is: a) he sensed that Michael’s death was not accidental b) he had hated, later called it ‘feared’, Buxton c) he therefore blamed B. for M’s death. On ‘a’, I think we would all agree that it is an open question. When we said to Boothby, “would you think it could possibly have been a mutual suicide pact” he thought it was very likely. (…)\n\nI must try and follow the Buxton thing up, though, even if I traced ‘family’ they are hardly likely to throw any light. From what you knew of Buxton, would you have described him as ‘daredevil’? It’s a word that has just come to mind. Knowing nothing, the picture I have is of a dark-haired (from Boothby’s ‘sinister’ theory), attractive, intelligent, dominating sort of person who, I would think, would attract the intellectual fragility of Michael. This is, I hasten to say, only a passing thought, one more idea for the pile, but perhaps Michael, frightened of water, was trying too hard for Buxton’s sake – a sort of ‘of course you’re not afraid, Michael, you can do it”. Enough of that.\n\nHow I wish Senhouse was still alive. The few notes I have of his on the ‘Letters’ merely tease.’ Jealous’ crops up – seems to be about J.M.B. towards Michael’s friends (on p. 184 ‘supposed conversation with self’). From Boothby’s inglenook story, and Senhouse’s odd notes, there seems to have been a sense of strain between Barrie and Michael’s friends. (…)\n\nI am right, am I not, in thinking that there had been some sort of rift between Barrie and Michael at, or just after, Shona:\n\nLetter to Elizabeth Lucas, p. 96: ‘It was nice of you to have that talk with Michael and I have no doubt that for the time at least it had a steadying effect. All sorts of things do set him “furiously to think” and they seem to burn out like a piece of paper. He is at present I think really working well at Oxford and has at any rate spasms of happiness out of it, but one never knows of the morrow. I think few have suffered from the loss of a mother as he has done.’\n\nAnd then, the following Feb., ‘(Michael) is working hard and really enjoying his life at Oxford for the present at least. He has the oddest way of alternating between extraordinary reserve and surprising intimacy. No medium. In his room at Oxford lately he suddenly unbosomed himself marvellously. One has to wait for those times, but they are worth while when they come.’\n\nThis may well have been something that you were not aware of. I rather get the impression that both Barrie and Michael were the sort of person who tends to try and keep such problems to themselves.\n\nI begin to wonder whether Senhouse ever wrote anything on Michael and Barrie – his copy of the Letters was certainly re-indexed at the front re; Michael in a seemingly ‘professional’ way! Who would have inherited the job of clearing up Senhouse’s papers etc? I’m sure, though, that everything’s been destroyed.\n\nOn a similar vein – what ever happened to Bernard Freyberg, I wonder.\n\n(…)\n\nNLD to SG 24/2/1976\n\n(…)\n\nI’ve had an excellent, and surprising time – to me – answer from Rivvy, Peter’s son. ‘Surprising’ because he’d like to help all he can…! “Of course I should very much like to meet Andrew Birkin and Sharon Goode, and may even be able to contribute something of the overall story. Papa talked a lot about that period – indeed I think it was always on his mind - & I can remember quite a bit, helped no doubt by recently published books of the letters [he presumably refers to Janet Dunbar]. Please put them in touch.” (He continues with his conviction that Peter’s Letters should now be published… Anyway do get in touch with him – you’ll like very much; his brothers are in America and Australia and momentarily out of touch. Rivvy [Ruthven Llewelyn Davies] writes from 11-15 Arlington Street, London S.W.1 – which I think you should ring and introduce yourself; his home address is 4 Crescent Grove, London SW4, but as his poor dear wife suffers from – of all things – multiple sclerosis I think the office address is the one to aim at.\n\nAngela du M. A splendid long letter from her, much looking forward to seeing – even if she doubts how much she & Daphne can really help – you and Andrew. She writes “we hope that they will be able to manage the 8th (a Monday) to lunch at Daphne’s and I’ll be there as neither Sat 6th or Sunday is any good to either of us.” [Jeanne, correctly in my view, thinks she couldn’t help, so you can ‘forget’ her much as we all love her!] Your letter says that Gerrie also is no good for that week-end. Anyway as soon as you hear from Gerrie give Angela a ring at POLRVAN 365 or write to her at Frayside, Bodinnick by Fowey, Cornwall. You’ll love both her & Daphne. There’ll be much laughter, and I’d recommend Andrew to be wearing his To Die “T” shirt! Which, in cyclamen (?), our granddaughter was thrilled with this last week-end. (…)\n\nNow. The Hampstead Churchyard. However much deceitful a bitch memory undoubtedly is, I would swear that Father & Mother were buried in the large grave rather than cremated. Their bones (in my belief) have been joined certainly by Peter’s ashes, probably Jack’s daughter Jane’s… I had a lot to do with changed, or additional, wordings after Peter’s death and know I have left room for the youngest son to be ‘remembered’ but NOT to have his ashes interred. I could talk better about this, but I feel sure there was no 1907 or 1910 cremation in so far as Ll.D’s were concerned. Trixie – no knowledge -but I would guess near Boxmoor or Felden in Herts: I could find out if you like from her grandson (my godson) Oliver Millar but I doubt if it is more than a passing interest: equalling what of Aunt May? Is she there? (What I ought to know, and what I don’t!)\n\nBoothby. I’m greatly interested in both your and Andrew’s obvious ‘sympathy’ with Boothby’s sincerity or character or whatever. I don’t know him at all… met him once… have always been fascinated by his T.V. personality but more or less always thought him too large for life, so to speak. Funny in many ways that I (a) never heard of him at Eton (b) never knew of his friendship with Michael (c) never met him… This does not mean I disbelieve him, I promise you. But until I find another person who admits to having regarded Rupert as sinister etc. I shall think that Bob Boothby is/was distorted (?) in some way. I mentioned the name of Clive Burt to Andrew in my last letter: I don’t know if you’re trying to see Sebastian Earl: (…) but I’ve thought of another possibility in Sir Geoffrey (or Mr Justice) WRANGHAM who is/was an exact twin of Michael’s = 16 June 1900 for birthday: Eton and Oxford an exact contemporary, had a terrific opinion of Michael (they ALL did!): my interest, now, is did he know [must have] and what did he think of Rupert? Would you like me to write and ask him? Or would you like to tackle him yourselves. I agree with Mary you must be more than replete!\n\nMy own, extremely limited, memories of Rupert I have written off to Andrew. Certainly no suggestion of daredevil. Nor of sinister. Darkhaired and attractive yes. But I cannot see him as any more dominating than Michael. The word ‘fragility’ is way-off to any thinking of Michael, but what is a three-year younger brother in his teens to know about such things. Michael was always so strong, athletic, active, whatever as well as so quick of mind and brilliant of intellect. He was NOT a person to bow under anyone’s influence in my very sure opinion. (None of us were!)\n\nI think you may be interested in a letter I have just unearthed from Roger Senhouse to me after Peter’s death (on 5 April 1960): there will be bits you won’t quite understand to do with tuggery & gowns (collegers at Eton!) but in general it has its interests. To me it is inconceivable that Roger should never have spoken to me pejoratively of Rupert & there were anything in Boothby’s comments. I also enclose a line from Michael to me – presumably emanating from some(?) I had had expecting to be elected to Pop! But there’s a nice line here of these and a bit of proof (not that you need it) that we were a close-knit family.\n\nAnd I would swear there was NO rift between J.M.B. & Michael. Arguments were there of course: and I’m very sure much of Michael’s 19-20 year old worries would be difficult = impossible to JMB fully to comprehend. Can only be guesswork for as what Michael’s worries were. He like myself, and – it must be admitted – many who have been successful at Eton, found Oxford a place of infinitely less attractive than Eton. I was lucky enough to fall in love (with Mary!) which brought me, non-working, through Oxford. He, for a time, couldn’t settle. ‘I’d better go to Paris or Germany, some continental university etc.’ Of course I’ve no idea about what the ‘unbosoming’ was: if I had to guess it would be more his brilliant mind searching for the best means of expansion – function rather than any physical i.e. body-work. Certainly, so far as I am concerned, neither Michael nor Uncle Jim ever put such a problem in my lap, or in my ear.\n\nBernard Freyberg was the strangest figure in Uncle Jim’s, in our life, I could talk at some length about him. I can’t remember when he died but it was a ‘straightforward’ death: he really loved Uncle Jim and vice versa – yet they were poles apart in pretty well every way. The ‘death watch’ of PD, Bernard & myself was unforgettable: So was a day of ?? we three had to Maggie Winter’s funeral. Many’s the time I used to go swimming with him in the R.A.C. or some club: he – and other greater swimmers (but failed by a few yards the Channel) all covered in 12 or 13 war-wounds. But he, as Capt. Scott, is one of the most difficult-to-understand man who truly worshipped J.M.B.\n\nWhat I would like to stress and stress again to you and Andrew is that surely I would have been aware (however dimly) of an antagonism between Uncle Jim & Michael at some time? I never was. Oh yes, a disagreement, a burst out of the room or whatever, but never for an hour. I wasn’t all that ‘distant’ from either of them: particularly of course Michael… I very frequently was with Michael and one of the other brothers… never a second's talk of what a strain, what a silly little man, *[except from Jack!], nothing except what fun… I realise how much less interesting this makes any story but it’s the truth.\n\nI feel I should sign off as Pontius Pilate!\n\nSG to NLD 27/2/1976\n\nI was very interested in both the Michael letter and the Senhouse one. When I used ‘fragility’ about Michael, I wasn’t thinking of physical fragility, rather mental. (Is Marjoribanks right in stating at inquest that Michael suffered "
