The effect is often successful at communicating \"unpopular\" ideas, as most Establishment types take materials meant to be satirical in nature at face value, and don't get the real point.\n\nSatire is meant to point out shortcomings in powerful people, famous people, or society at large. When these shortcomings are clarified, the audience is invited to choose to reform their own opinions on these topics, or may even be spurred into pushing for reform in society. There are two forms of satire, both named for Roman poets: Horatian satire, which uses a lighthearted, cheerful touch to cajole those being satirized; and Juvenalian satire, which is more hard-hitting and unforgiving in its portrayal of vice and folly.[3]\n\nOne of the great literary satirists in English is Jonathan Swift, the author of Gulliver's Travels and a pamphlet titled A Modest Proposal.[note 2] His Tale of a Tub is immensely difficult, to the point where it was one of the first books to be published in an edition featuring extensive notes, but immensely rewarding, providing what may be the crowning satire on Christianity as well as learning in general.\n\nClaims of satire are also used by white nationalists, including the owner of The Daily Stormer,[4] to deflect any and all criticism — one could call this sort of bullshit 'pseudo-satire'.\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nFake news\n\nThe Onion — a prominent modern satirical publication\n\nBabylon bee — A conservative knockoff version of The Onion\n\nPoe's Law — where people cannot tell the difference between satire and genuine insanity\n\nVoltaire — the original rational satirist\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Too Stupid for Satire: How The Media Branded Me as a Racist\": A Cracked.com blogger discusses how one of his attempts at satire was taken literally.\n\nNotes[edit]"
