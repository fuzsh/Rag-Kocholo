        "text": "Historical definitions\n\nThe terminological difficulty is pointed up by a phrase of the Roman rhetorician Quintilian: “satire is wholly our own” (“satura tota nostra est”). Quintilian seems to be claiming satire as a Roman phenomenon, although he had read the Greek dramatist Aristophanes and was familiar with a number of Greek forms that one would call satiric. But the Greeks had no specific word for satire, and by satura (which meant originally something like “medley” or “miscellany” and from which comes the English satire) Quintilian intended to specify that kind of poem “invented” by Gaius Lucilius, written in hexameters on certain appropriate themes, and characterized by a Lucilian-Horatian tone. Satura referred, in short, to a poetic form, established and fixed by Roman practice. (Quintilian mentions also an even older kind of satire written in prose by Marcus Terentius Varro and, one might add, by Menippus and his followers Lucian and Petronius.) After Quintilian’s day, satura began to be used metaphorically to designate works that were satirical in tone but not in form. As soon as a noun enters the domain of metaphor, as one modern scholar has pointed out, it clamours for extension, and satura (which had no verbal, adverbial, or adjectival forms) was immediately broadened by appropriation from the Greek satyros and its derivatives. The odd result is that the English satire comes from the Latin satura, but satirize, satiric, etc., are of Greek origin. By about the 4th century ce the writer of satires came to be known as satyricus; St. Jerome, for example, was called by one of his enemies “a satirist in prose” (“satyricus scriptor in prosa”). Subsequent orthographic modifications obscured the Latin origin of the word satire: satura becomes satyra, and in England by the 16th century it was written satyre.\n\nElizabethan writers, anxious to follow Classical models but misled by a false etymology, believed that satyre derived from the Greek satyr play: satyrs being notoriously rude, unmannerly creatures, it seemed to follow that the word satyre should indicate something harsh, coarse, rough. The English author Joseph Hall wrote:\n\nThe Satyre should be like the Porcupine,\n\nThat shoots sharpe quils out in each angry line,\n\nAnd wounds the blushing cheeke, and fiery eye,\n\nOf him that heares, and readeth guiltily.\n\n(Virgidemiarum, V, 3, 1–4)\n\nThe false etymology that derives satire from satyrs was finally exposed in the 17th century by the Classical scholar Isaac Casaubon, but the old tradition has aesthetic if not etymological appropriateness and has remained strong.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Hall boasts:\n\nI first adventure: follow me who list,\n\nAnd be the second English Satyrist.\n\nBut Hall knew the satirical poems of Geoffrey Chaucer and John Skelton, among other predecessors, and probably meant that he was the first to imitate systematically the formal satirists of Rome.\n\nInfluence of Horace and Juvenal\n\nBy their practice, the great Roman poets Horace and Juvenal set indelibly the lineaments of the genre known as the formal verse satire and, in so doing, exerted pervasive, if often indirect, influence on all subsequent literary satire. They gave laws to the form they established, but it must be said that the laws were very loose indeed. Consider, for example, style. In three of his Satires (I, iv; I, x; II, i) Horace discusses the tone appropriate to the satirist who out of a moral concern attacks the vice and folly he sees around him. As opposed to the harshness of Lucilius, Horace opts for mild mockery and playful wit as the means most effective for his ends. Although I portray examples of folly, he says, I am not a prosecutor and I do not like to give pain; if I laugh at the nonsense I see about me, I am not motivated by malice. The satirist’s verse, he implies, should reflect this attitude: it should be easy and unpretentious, sharp when necessary, but flexible enough to vary from grave to gay. In short, the character of the satirist as projected by Horace is that of an urbane man of the world, concerned about folly, which he sees everywhere, but moved to laughter rather than rage.\n\nJuvenal, more than a century later, conceives the satirist’s role differently. His most characteristic posture is that of the upright man who looks with horror on the corruptions of his time, his heart consumed with anger and frustration. Why does he write satire? Because tragedy and epic are irrelevant to his age. Viciousness and corruption so dominate Roman life that, for someone who is honest, it is difficult not to write satire. He looks about him, and his heart burns dry with rage; never has vice been more triumphant. How can he be silent (Satires, I)? Juvenal’s declamatory manner, the amplification and luxuriousness of his invective, are wholly out of keeping with the stylistic prescriptions set by Horace. At the end of the scabrous sixth satire, a long, perfervid invective against women, Juvenal flaunts his innovation: in this poem, he says, satire has gone beyond the limits established by his predecessors; it has taken to itself the lofty tone of tragedy.\n\nThe results of Juvenal’s innovation have been highly confusing for literary history. What is satire if the two poets universally acknowledged to be supreme masters of the form differ so completely in their work as to be almost incommensurable? The formulation of the English poet John Dryden has been widely accepted. Roman satire has two kinds, he says: comical satire and tragical satire, each with its own kind of legitimacy. These denominations have come to mark the boundaries of the satiric spectrum, whether reference is to poetry or prose or to some form of satiric expression in another medium. At the Horatian end of the spectrum, satire merges imperceptibly into comedy, which has an abiding interest in human follies but has not satire’s reforming intent. The distinction between the two modes, rarely clear, is marked by the intensity with which folly is pursued: fops and fools and pedants appear in both, but only satire has a moral purpose. And, although the great engine of both comedy and satire is irony, in satire, as the 20th-century critic Northrop Frye claimed, irony is militant.\n\nNicolas Boileau, Dryden, and Alexander Pope, writing in the 17th and 18th centuries—the modern age of satire—catch beautifully, when they like, the deft Horatian tone. However, satire’s wit can also be sombre, deeply probing, and prophetic, as it explores the ranges of the Juvenalian end of the satiric spectrum, where satire merges with tragedy, melodrama, and nightmare. Pope’s Dunciad ends with these lines:\n\nLo! thy dread Empire, Chaos! is restor’d;\n\nLight dies before thy uncreating word:\n\nThy hand, great Anarch! lets the curtain fall;\n\nAnd Universal Darkness buries All.\n\nIt is the same darkness that falls on Book IV of Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, on some of Mark Twain’s satire—The Mysterious Stranger and “To the Person Sitting in Darkness”—and on George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-four and, in a more surrealist vein, Joseph Heller’s Catch-22."
