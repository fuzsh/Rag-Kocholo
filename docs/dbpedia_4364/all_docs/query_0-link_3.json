        "text": "What do you get when you cross a loud, angry Pentecostal preacher from Oklahoma and stand-up? You get a dude who goes on stage and, as Bill Hicks said, “not in any way ask the audience to like him.” Kinison even got the honor of being described as “savagely misogynistic,” by Stephen Holden (any Stephen Holden fans out there?). So let’s ask the question no one gives enough of a shit to ask and we all already know the answer to: does Sam Kinison hold up decades later?\n\nWell, one of the first major bits is about how he cheated on his wife, she found out, said she forgave him, then put a loaded .38 in his suitcase for when he was travelling and then he screams about how she’s a bitch and a whore. Kinison does have one great quality to his stand-up, and that’s just because we get to answer the question: is a dude angrily yelling angrily into a microphone funny? Shocking no one, the answer is no. It isn’t funny now, and the only reason I can imagine it was funny then is the people who were laughing were laughing because they knew he shouldn’t be saying some of the stuff he was saying, but he was doing it anyways. He didn’t need or want the audience to like him. The “comedy” was the supposed persona of Kinison’s personality on stage, but the personality isn’t funny, it’s just a piece of shit. There’s no touches of satire. It never feels purposefully indulgent or like there’s any calculation behind the madness, something you can actively feel when you watch someone like Hicks, instead Kinison just said a bunch of shit I feel like I would hear if I worked in the kitchen of a sport’s bar in Oklahoma. I never want to work that job. I don’t care to hear any of those things. He gleefully talks about how when he gets married he’s gonna fuck all her friends and leave her in debt. He’s so misogynistic it’s honestly astounding at times. There’s a bit about how Hollywood is the “pycho bitch headquarters of the entire world.” Then there’s a bit where Hugh Hefner is in the audience and Kinison thanks him for giving man sex education because no one in the country teaches men about sex. His singular complaint is no one teaches men how to perform cunninilingus, and he’s mad because women will never try and help the guy get better at going down on her. Kinison’s dream is explicitly not for world peace, but instead for every guy to leave his show “like an Oriental lick master from the Far East.” His suggestion is just to lick the alphabet. That’s it. That’s what Kinison says will make you the “darkest chapter in her sexual history.” All of this happens before he even moves on to an extended segment of how he doesn’t understand gay people. Kinison talks about AIDS and says “thanks for giving us the black plague of the 80s.” It’s just homophobic. It isn’t enjoyable.\n\nMy main issue with older comedy like this (besides all the sexism, homophobia, and racism) is there’s no real questioning or challenge to any form of thinking. Nothing feels investigated. Kinison goes on stage and gives his opinions on wives, religion, sex, and other over discussed topics, but there was no point where it felt like Kinison said something that actually had any weight to it. Anything interesting to it. I don’t care about Jesus angrily calling people a fucking bitch when he comes back from the dead. Maybe if I was in 1987 I would think this was funny, but I hope not. Kinison’s comedy feels hollow. There’s no real substance. His material is immaterial. You watch Kinison for the character of Kinison. Unfortunately the character of Kinison is the worst part of watching Kinison.\n\nI didn’t laugh a single time while watching Breaking the Rules. I suggest Kinison to no one but people who are running out of stand-up to watch and need to watch a stand-up special everyday. And honestly, even then, just go watch Hicks.\n\n1/5 mics"
