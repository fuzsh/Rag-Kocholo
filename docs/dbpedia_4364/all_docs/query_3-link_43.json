        "text": "PART of the current generation of screaming performers, Sam Kinison does his act in white sneakers, a tweedy beret and a dumpy overcoat, looking for all the world like the neighborhood flasher. That's his more likable side. Claiming to have once been an evangelist preacher, Mr. Kinison is still another comedian determined to shock paying customers. He has been shouting his way threateningly through such television formats as ''Saturday Night Live'' for the last year or so. Now he has his own pay-cable special on Home Box Office. Taped at the Roxy Theater in Los Angeles, ''Sam Kinison: Breaking the Rules'' had its original debut date postponed so as not to offend viewers during Easter week. Additional late-night showings can be seen this Wednesday and May 4, 7 and 9.\n\nUsing a hand-held microphone, Mr. Kinison paces restlessly on stage, stopping every once in a while to scream his key points in a hostile, high-pitched whine. He is a kind of unleashed, stalking id, using some of the oratorical techniques of the soapbox preacher, but putting them into the service of the darker forces swirling about the world. For Mr. Kinison, it is a world of lies and hypocrisy, a world in which he must constantly confront the wily manipulations of women, homosexuals, the Reagans and fellow preachers. ''If I've learned one thing,'' he says, referring to human relationships, ''it's don't tell the truth. Lies keep you together.'' For those of his fans who seem to get a special high from calculated outrageousness, Mr. Kinison doesn't disappoint on this occasion, produced by Elliot Abbott and directed by Walter C. Miller. He excoriates his brother evangelists, especially the ones who insist that the Lord told them to get a television satellite (and this was before the evangelist scandals began making headlines).\n\nFrom there he offers some of his more unorthodox views on Jesus and those of his followers who stood around and watched Him die on the cross. A simple ladder and a pair of pliers could have easily changed that story, he says (for the how-times-have-changed record, there was a public outcry a few decades ago when George S. Kaufman made a harmless, offhand crack about Christmas carols). And this leads to concepts of hell, with Mr. Kinison's shrieking that after being married for two years, hell for him would be like a Club Med.\n\nAs for women, the comedian admits that he is attracted to heartbreakers, the kind who seem determined to seduce all his friends. Wonderful women, on the other hand, scare him. ''What are you going to do,'' he says, shrugging malevolently, ''give sheep the vote?'' It is around this point that Hugh Hefner, sitting in the audience, stands to take a bow. Tell me who your friends are, as my grandmother used to say, and I'll tell you who you are."
