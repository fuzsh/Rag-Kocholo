        "text": "Ten minutes of audio from shock-comic Sam Kinison‘s final recorded performance, captured a few days before a drunk driver killed him in April 1992, is now available to stream. The comedian makes fun of the election that year, jokes about homicidal disgruntled postal workers and serial killers, among other topics, and interlaces it all with his signature, take-no-prisoners (read: extremely offensive) profanities. The clip comes via SiriusXM, which obtained it for its Comedy Greats channel.\n\nThe Comedy Greats channel (number 94) will also air a new audio documentary about the comedian’s career featuring commentary by Andrew Dice Clay, Josh Gad, Kevin Hart, Marc Maron, Louie Anderson, Jackie Martling and others. The show is set to air at 3 p.m. on August 12th and will be followed by a full version of the newly discovered audio.\n\nTrending\n\nThe documentary precedes the release of the Kinison box set The Definitive Comedy Collection, due out in September.\n\nWhen the entertainment imprint Comedy Dynamics, which distributed the audio to SiriusXM, announced the box set earlier this year, it said it would include a new video documentary that includes seldom-seen archival footage from the Kinison family vault. It will also contain three of his comedy specials and another documentary, Brother Sam, that aired on the Playboy Channel in 2002."
