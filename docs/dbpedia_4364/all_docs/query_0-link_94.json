        "text": "I grew up on George Carlin, Bill Hicks, Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor, Sam Kinison, Denis Leary, Andrew Dice Clay, Richard Jeni, Bob Saget (who I just saw live last week!), and a host of others who are varying levels of offensive. I watched every episode of South Park and Team America: World Police. Heck, I watched John Waters' \"Pink Flamingos\" voluntarily.\n\nI don't speak for anyone but myself, and this whole speech thing becomes a sticky wicket. The American right [I'd say conservative, but that would imply valuing the rights of the individual to be free from the religion of others and have autonomy and the government to leave decisions to individuals] for all the complaints fails to recognize that by virtue of the fact that whatever is the outrage case of the day becomes boilerplate talking points by sundown, there's not much successful suppression of speech. Also, there's no one to blame but themselves, as bowing and scraping to corporations and killing Net Neutrality allowed the very online environment that exists. You can't cancel a person, you can only vote with your dollars, your feet, through letters to leaders and organized protest, and at the ballot box.\n\nThe marketplace of ideas is going to contain things you don't like. Certain platforms are going to use their 1st Amendment right and the contract you agreed to as terms of service to remove harmful content, disinformation, misinformation, propaganda, etc. Killing Net Neutrality gave the big players and the large media corporations the clout to control the largest anticompetitive platforms and getting rid of Section 230 will just guarantee that only curated speech gets through. That would be a massive overnight censorship issue as if you make platforms liable for the content, the only safe option is to only allow curated content that isn't controversial.\n\nPeople have the right to get mad, and reactionary attitudes are not new, they just move faster in the digital age. I will say that there's an attempt to prioritize identity over message and the vast swath of people are turned off by the very vocal fringes to the point that they don't assert rationality into the debate.\n\nSafe comedy fails because comedy is either something inappropriate happening in an unlikely situation or something mundane occurring in an inappropriate setting. It's identity, social views, satire, demographics, politics, philosophy, and it has the ability to demand change and create a dialogue and it challenges the deeply held views of some.\n\nI think the distinction is between controversial and malicious, and at the end of the day in a free marketplace of ideas what survives is what the market will bear. We don't get the right to force private companies to allow us to say whatever we want and we don't have the right to force them to get rid of anything we don't want to hear. But, if you're an abysmal human and suddenly you are losing viewership and revenue because your attitudes don't align with your fan base, that's capitalism.\n\nMy suggestion? If you don't like it, don't support it with your views. The comedians I mentioned early on were all dirty, and a lot were offensive. But, through comedy and its uncomfortable relationship with the status quo, it has brought a lot of societal good. It takes a lot less effort to make someone angry than to be truly funny, and grievance politics are tearing apart families and friendships and communities. If you don't like Chapelle, watch something else. You're paying Netflix maybe $20ish a month, they don't owe you a slate of sanitized content. You are ultimately in control, and you can cancel at any time.\n\nAnd, most importantly, let's all try not to be assholes about everything. The past couple of years have been a disaster, and we've had way too much time to be stuck in our cellphones worrying about what one dude said rather than our immediate needs and mental health. We should be focusing on ourselves first, and realize that saving the world from offensive jokes is not our solemn obligation."
