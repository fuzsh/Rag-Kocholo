        "text": "What is satire?\n\nSatire is a device and literary genre that employs humor and ridicule to expose a fault in society or humanity. While often political, satire generally critiques the human condition, focusing on the negative aspects of behavior.\n\nLiterary devices such as irony, hyperbole, and understatement help in the development of satire:\n\nIrony: Highlights the difference between belief and reality\n\nHyperbole: Exaggerating a single characteristic or element of the subject of the satire steers the audience's attention\n\nUnderstatement: Understating an aspect of what is being satirized can help develop a humorous response\n\nAncient Greeks and Romans like Aristophanes, Horace, and Juvenal wrote satire centuries ago in Greek and Latin. Satirical literary works in English became popular in the 18th century with writers such as Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift.\n\nWhat is the purpose of satire?\n\nThe function of satire is to create awareness and motivation.\n\nAwareness: Satire can expose flaws in society and human behavior by providing social commentary or criticism. It entertains the audience and pushes them to think more deeply about the given subject. In exposing these faults, satirists hope to promote awareness of an issue and motivate others to change.\n\nMotivation: By providing a satirical reflection of society, authors/speakers allow their audience to experience empathy for those included in the satirical work. Creating an emotional connection could allow the audience to reflect on their behavior and beliefs, motivating them to change in some capacity.\n\nTypes of satire\n\nThere are three types of satire: Horatian, Juvenalian, and Menippean.\n\nHoratian: Horatian satires (named for Roman satirist Horace) are comical and provide commentary that humorously presents various social issues. They evoke a comedic response by pinpointing peculiar aspects of human behavior. This type of satire is considered the mildest form and entertains by poking fun at absurdities and follies rather than trying to induce societal change.\n\nLiterary Examples\n\nPride and Prejudice by Jane Austen\n\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain\n\nPop Culture Examples\n\nMonty Python's Life of Brian\n\nThe Simpsons Movie\n\nJuvenalian: Named for Roman satirist Juvenal, Juvenalian satires avoid humor and provide a dark, foreboding tone meant to motivate others to confront those in a position of power. Their goal is to expose hypocrisy and the indiscretion of governments, organizations, and leaders.\n\nLiterary Examples\n\nBrave New World by Aldous Huxley\n\nA Modest Proposal by Jonathan Swift\n\nPop Culture Examples\n\nDistrict 9\n\nElysium\n\nMenippean: Menippean satires primarily cast moral judgment on certain beliefs, such as racism or classism. These can either be presented as comedic (Horatian) or ominous (Juvenalian). They typically focus on critiquing a specific human fault.\n\nLiterary Examples\n\nAlice in Wonderland by Lewis Carrol\n\nFinnegan's Wake by James Joyce\n\nPop Culture Examples\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\nJojo Rabbit\n\nSatire examples\n\nSatire in literature\n\nThe following include examples of satire found in literature and American popular culture:\n\nHoratian\n\nLiterature: In The Importance of Being Earnest, Oscar Wilde satirizes the rigid cultural norms of marriage and love in the Victorian Age. He details a character who deviates from these norms to criticize how the upper class views the institution of marriage.\n\nPop Culture: Saturday Night Live satirizes major aspects of society, such as politics and Hollywood, to humorously criticize current day issues in the world. While primarily used to create humor, SNL also uses political satire to provide insight into the absurd aspects of serious issues.\n\nJuvenalian\n\nLiterature: In Animal Farm, George Orwell satirizes communism by using a farm and animals to represent the major people and groups involved in the Russian Revolution. He demonstrates the corrupt nature of power and influence on others.\n\nPop Culture: The movie District 9 utilizes the story of aliens stuck on Earth to satirize issues stemming from racism, classism, and unemployment. By incorporating the background of South Africa, the movie uses aliens to reflect the treatment of individuals after the end of apartheid.\n\nMenippean"
