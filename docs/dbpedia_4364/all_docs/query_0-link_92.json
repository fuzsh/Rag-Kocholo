        "text": "Ramblings:-->SNL Season 2/Episode 8 -&- Sam Kinison\n\n\"I used to be a preacher, had a good life.\n\nI had a wonderful family...\n\nAlways tried to do right.\n\nWhen I saw her in church\n\nI knew she didn't come to stay.\n\nShe looked at me and said, \"I got a confession.\n\nDon't tell anyone but I'm the backdoor to heaven.\"\n\nSam Kinison (courtesy of Leslie West)\n\nSeason 2/Episode 8 may have been the greatest SNL episode of all time. It certainly was the definitive episode that handed the ...\"Torch of Total Coolness\" to SNL. It was \"Must-Watch\" television at its best.\n\nObservations:\n\nChevy Chase is gone from the cast...but makes a cameo.\n\nStill, no Bill Murray...though he is mentioned as part of the cast.\n\nGuest Host Paul Simon famously sings 1st verse of \"Still Crazy After All These Years\" in a turkey costume.\n\nPaul Simon performs \"50 Ways To Leave Your Lover\".\n\nPaul Simon shyly introduces George Harrison and perform \"Here Comes The Sun\" & \"Homeward Bound\". Each share a verse. George has Paul Simon totally pleased with his guitar ending of \"Homeward Bound\". Simon is obviously honored to share the stage.\n\nSimon introduces a short film by Eric Idle...starring George Harrison. It is what we now call a music video. \"Crackerbox Palace\" by Harrison.\n\nPaul Simon sings one of his underrated songs...\"Something So Right\".\n\nAnother music video. George Harrison singing \"This Song\". A comment on his questionable plagiarism lawsuit.\n\nFinally, Paul Simon sings \"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\" solo.\n\nThe SNL comedy sketches intermixed were top-notch. Commercials about...\"Puppy-Uppers\" and \"Doggy-Downers\". And \"Quarry Cereal\".\n\n\"Update\" is Jane Curtain's puppy...and this was the best one so far.\n\nDan Ackroyd nails talk show host Tom Snyder in a sketch with Paul Simon.\n\nA great parody of movie...\"Billy Jack\"...with Paul Simon dead-on as the main character.\n\nAmong stars in the audience...Art Garfunkel and teenage Jodi Foster.\n\nSimon & Harrison. A classic. Wait for the end and watch Simon's face\n\nwatching Harrison finish his song with a tasty guitar lick. Priceless.\n\nFrom this show forward...SNL had musical guests lining up wanting to perform.\n\nEpisode 8/season 2 perfectly defined the show.\n\nAND ANOTHER THING:\n\nFlipping through some of my CDs, I came across Sam Kinison and was reminded of how excited I would get when finding out he was going to be on the tube. He was always so...in your face and spontaneous with the directions he would take on stage.\n\nSam Kinison was voted #20 in Comedy Central's 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time...but he was a flaming candle that burned out way too soon.\n\nWhat I also enjoyed was when Sammy K would let his Rock-n-Roll demons out and slay one well known rocker after another with his over-the-top tonsils. These were vocals meant to ride over heavy drums and lightening guitars and thumping bass.\n\nHe'd take on AC/DC or Cheap Trick...or maybe an old '60s rocker...it didn't matter. Sammy's energy raised whatever song he was doing to a whole other level.\n\nBelow is Sam Kinison performing \"Wild Thing\".\n\nSammy K and a few rockers work out...\"Wild Thing\".\n\nThat's Jessica Hahn in the ring.\n\nOn \"Leader Of The Banned\"...Kinison wails on four rockers flailing on his Stratocaster...while also including some of his biting comedy.\n\nSam rounded up Leslie West (Mountain) and C.C. DeVille (Poison) to help him nail a perfect parody of the Mountain classic...\"Mississippi Queen\"...poking fun at televangelist Jim Bakker and Jessica Hahn.\n\nSam Kinison, RIP.\n\nGood Stuff!CaseySam Kinison:-->\"Mississippi Queen\" (Leader Of The Banned) (1990) (Own It)"
