        "text": "Discover More\n\nExample Sentences\n\nOver the years, Francis has deepfaked politicians like Boris Johnson and celebrities like Kim Kardashian, all in the name of education and satire.\n\nThere are currently no real guidelines on how to label deepfakes, for example, or where the line falls between satire and misinformation.\n\nThus far, most professionalized deepfakes have been based on famous people and made with clear, constructive goals, so they are legally protected in the US under satire laws.\n\nGood political satire that responds to the tumult of the times is possible.\n\nFrom Vox\n\nArt does not have to be political satire to help us reckon with the world.\n\nFrom Vox\n\nAnd the fact that satire unnerves the intolerant is evidence of its positive power.\n\nThe 289-page satire follows Morris Feldstein, a pharmaceutical salesman who gets seduced by a lonely receptionist.\n\nThe premise was simple: satire is devastating against tyrants.\n\nWe prefer to wave away the warning signs; like The Interview, Mulholland Drive was comfortably downplayed as over-the-top satire.\n\nBut now, the controversy surrounding the political satire has gotten serious.\n\nHe was judge of the admiralty court of Pennsylvania; his writings abound with wit, humor and satire.\n\nFrom Project Gutenberg\n\nOther caricatures of the period more justly include ministers in their satire.\n\nFrom Project Gutenberg\n\nPage after page—full of caustic satire, humorous sally and profound epigram—fairly bristles with merriment.\n\nFrom Project Gutenberg\n\nAs the drink takes effect our parlour customers attempt satire, and their efforts are always of a strongly personal nature.\n\nFrom Project Gutenberg"
