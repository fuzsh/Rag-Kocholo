See ‘Meaning & use’ for definitions, usage, and quotation evidence.\n\nHow common is the noun satire?\n\nAbout 4occurrences per million words in modern written English\n\n17509.217609.317701217801117901318001218101218209.518308.518407.218506.818606.818707.118807.518907.719007.019107.019206.919306.819406.619506.519606.719706.019804.919904.020003.720103.6\n\nHow is the noun satire pronounced?\n\nBritish English\n\nSAT-igh-uh\n\nU.S. English\n\n/ˈsæˌtaɪ(ə)r/\n\nSAT-igh-uhr\n\nWhere does the noun satire come from?\n\nThe earliest known use of the noun satire is in the early 1500s.\n\nOED's earliest evidence for satire is from 1509, in the writing of Alexander Barclay, poet and clergyman.\n\nsatire is of multiple origins. Either (i) a borrowing from French. Or (ii) a borrowing from Latin.\n\nEtymons: French satire; Latin satira, satura.\n\nNearby entries\n\nEtymology\n\nSummary\n\nEither (i) a borrowing from French. Or (ii) a borrowing from Latin.\n\nEtymons: French satire; Latin satira, satura.\n\n< (i) Middle French satire, satyre (French satire, †satyre) poem in which prevailing immorality or foolishness is ridiculed or denounced (1355 in a translation of Livy; the specific senses ‘satirical…\n\n< (i) Middle French satire, satyre (French satire, †satyre) poem in which prevailing immorality or foolishness is ridiculed or denounced (1355 in a translation of Livy; the specific senses ‘satirical writing’ and ‘mockery’ are not paralleled until later than in English: 1663 and 1690 respectively), or its etymon (ii) classical Latin satira, variant of satura literary composition consisting of a miscellany of prose and verse on various topics (Quintilian, Aulus Gellius), poem in which prevailing immorality or foolishness is ridiculed or denounced, of uncertain origin. Compare Spanish sátira (1417), Italian satira (a1308); also German Satire (1540).\n\nNotes\n\nClassical Latin satura is probably a specific application of satura medley. According to the grammarians satura is short for lanx satura (literally ‘full dish’; < lanx dish (see launce n.1) + satura, feminine of satur full: see saturate v.), which is alleged to have been used for a dish containing various kinds of fruit, and for food composed of many different ingredients. It has also been suggested that classical Latin satura denoting a literary composition is a different word, possibly of Etruscan origin, and that the association with satura ‘medley’ reflects popular etymology. The word was formerly often associated in English with satyr n., from the common view (found already in some ancient grammarians) that classical Latin satira was derived from ancient Greek σάτυρος satyr n., in allusion to the chorus of satyrs which gave its name to the Greek ‘satyric’ drama. This association is reflected by the α forms; it is likewise found in French, where the spelling †satyre is common until the mid 18th cent., and was the headword form in the French Academy dictionary until its 1740 edition. Sense II.4, which is not paralleled in Latin or any of the Romance languages, shows a specific use probably resulting from association with satyr n.\n\nMeaning & use\n\nQuotations\n\nHide all quotations\n\nContents\n\nEarlier version\n\nsatire, n. in OED Second Edition (1989)\n\nI.\n\nA literary composition, and related senses.\n\nI.1.a.\n\nA poem or (in later use) a novel, film, or other work of art which uses humour, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize prevailing immorality or foolishness, esp. as a form of social or political commentary.
