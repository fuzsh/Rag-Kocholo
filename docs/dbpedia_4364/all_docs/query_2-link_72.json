        "text": "Exposing people's stupidity.\n\nThat's the definition of satire in the Oxford Dictionary.\n\nCharlie Hebdo used it to mock political figures, religion and celebrities. It may have cost 12 people their lives in an attack on the magazine's Paris headquarters.\n\nIn 2006 some Muslims were angered when Charlie Hebdo reprinted cartoons of the Prophet Muhammed. They had originally appeared in a Danish paper.\n\nBut the magazine hasn't just made jokes about Muslims - it recently poked fun at the Pope and the Catholic church as well as Jewish leaders.\n\nIn the UK, there's no direct equivalent. The best known satirical magazine is Private Eye.\n\nIt uses cartoons to mimic political issues. Even if you don't buy Private Eye, satire is something you probably see every day.\n\nThere are thousands of channels dedicated to satire on YouTube.\n\nIt is often seen as controversial because it challenges people's perceptions on reality.\n\nMany writers and comics hope this style of journalism can encourage the groups it highlights to change.\n\nRecent Sony film The Interview was pulled from most cinemas after the company received hacking threats.\n\nThe movie depicted North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un as a small, sheltered leader who cries when he hears Katy Perry songs."
