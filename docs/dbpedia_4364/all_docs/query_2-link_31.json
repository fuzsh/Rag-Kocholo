        "text": "By the mid-20th century, film began to exceed theatre in its satirical ambitions, not least because the makers of movies exploded an ancient doctrine having to do with principles of decorum in the use of satire and ridicule. The English novelist Henry Fielding was reflecting centuries of tradition when, in the preface to Joseph Andrews (1742), he spoke of the inappropriateness of ridicule applied to black villainy or dire calamity: “What could exceed the absurdity of an Author, who should write the Comedy of Nero, with the merry Incident of ripping up his Mother’s Belly?” Given this point of view, Adolf Hitler seems an unlikely target for satire, yet in The Great Dictator (1940) Charlie Chaplin managed a successful, if risky, burlesque. (Chaplin wrote, however, that, determined as he was to ridicule the Nazi notions of a superrace, if he had known of the horrors of the concentration camps, he could not have made the film.)\n\nStanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove; or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) denies all limitation; through some alchemy, Kubrick created an immensely funny, savagely satirical film about the annihilation of the world. A combination of farce and nightmare, Dr. Strangelove satirizes military men, scientists, statesmen—the whole ethos of the technological age—in the most mordant terms; it shows the doomsday blast, yet leaves audiences laughing. “You can’t fight in here,” says the president of the United States as doom nears, “this is the War Room.” The film’s tone is less didactic than in most powerful satire—the mushroom cloud carries its own moral—yet satire’s full force is there.\n\nAt about the same time, television was showing itself erratically receptive to satire. That Was the Week That Was, a weekly satirical review started in England in 1962, had remarkable success for a time but succumbed to a variety of pressures, some of them political; when a version of the program was attempted in the United States, it was emasculated by restrictions imposed by sponsors fearful of offending customers and by program lawyers wary of libel suits. Yet by the mid-1970s, when Saturday Night Live launched on NBC in the United States, the atmosphere had changed. The pointed irreverence of the show’s early seasons, combined with its commercial success, influenced a generation of television programs, and its satirical spirit reached something like an apotheosis with The Daily Show as hosted by Jon Stewart (1999–2015) and Stephen Colbert’s The Colbert Report (2005–14) in the United States and with Rick Mercer’s The Rick Mercer Report (begun 2004) in Canada. Jonathan Swift said that he wrote to vex the world rather than divert it; by the 21st century, Stewart, Colbert, Mercer, and others had discovered that vexation could attract large passionate audiences.\n\nVisual arts\n\nThe critique that is satire may be conveyed even more potently in the visual arts than by way of the spoken or written word. In caricature and cartoons (and, specifically, the political cartoon), artists since the Renaissance have left a wealth of startlingly vivid commentary on the people and events of their time. These artists include: in England, William Hogarth, Thomas Rowlandson, Sir John Tenniel, and Sir Max Beerbohm; in France, Charles Philipon (whose metamorphosis of King Louis-Philippe into a poire—that is, “fathead,” or “fool”—is classic) and Honoré Daumier; in Spain, Francisco Goya, and out of Spain, Pablo Picasso; and among 20th-century political cartoonists, Sir David Low, Vicky (Victor Weisz), Herblock (Herbert Block), and Paul Conrad.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nFrench literature: Satire, the fabliaux, and the Roman de Renart\n\nThe favourite medium of such individuals is a print in which the satirical attack is pointed up by a brief verbal caption. The social impact of their art is incalculable. Dictators recognize this all too well, and in times of social tension political cartoonists are among the first victims of the censor."
