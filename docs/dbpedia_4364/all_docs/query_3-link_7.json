        "text": "\"Sam Kinison was absolutely fearless. He was like a comedy combination of Chuck Yeager and Evel Knievel. Most people go to the edge and then stop. Not Sam. He'd see the edge and then just keep going. And I think that scream he was famous for was just the sound he made on the way down.\" - Robin Williams\n\nKinison's life was bookended by automotive tragedy. He was hit by a truck when he was three years old - an accident causing him per­manent brain damage - and he died in a car crash in 1992 at the age of 38. In the years in between he went from being a Pentecostal preacher to one of the most original and acclaimed comics in America. In the Eighties he was a true sensation, one of the first comics to take the \"comedy of hate\" to serious arena-sized heights.\n\nHe was the man who inspired Bill Hicks to push his own envelope, a stand-up comedian who indulged his passions for alcohol, drugs and women. He was the frat-house Lenny Bruce, a white Richard Pryor, the most rock'n'roll comic to ever fill an auditorium. He was the high-school dropout raised on the Bible who delivered sleaze with sledgehammer subtlety.\n\nI'd like to congratulate Sam Kinison on being the first pig ever to introduce a rock'n'roll show (Elton John)\n\nHe certainly walked on stage like a rock star. I saw him for the first time in the spring of 1987, at the Comedy Store on LA's Sunset Strip. And he was ferocious. He ambled on stage like Bob Dylan with a grievance, surly and snarky before he'd even opened his mouth. I was sitting close to the stage, and I remember feeling terrified in case he decided to pick on me. The only other time I've been scared in the presence of a comedian was when I saw Sandra Bernhard in London in the Nineties, I was sitting in the front row just hoping she wasn't going to notice my tie (loud, unnecessarily self-regarding).\n\nKinison, though, was something else. This was the sort of come­dian you would have expected to play the Roxy or the Vortex during the London punk years, if punk had ever entertained comedy, that is. Kinison's stage presence was strictly on/off. With him there was no dimmer switch. He would shout, he would scream, and then he'd do it all again, louder. And there was nothing the audience could do apart from capitulate. Because the audience was his bitch. And we never knew where to look.\n\nFor starters he looked like a child molester. He wasn't what you would call a typical comic, nor a typical rock star come to that. He was pudgy - he was short and weighed more than 14 stone - and looked like a chubby Che Guevara, or a deranged Muppet. He'd wear baggy T-shirts, a billowing flasher's coat and a beret, looking more like a beggar than a gold-rated comic.\n\nKinison was a slash-and-burn comedian with a potty mouth and a megaphone for a larynx. His stand-up routines were characterised by an OTT style that was out of kilter with the popular stand-ups of the early Eighties, a \"fire and brimstone\" style based on his Pentecostal preachings, and always punctuated by what became known as his trademark scream. He would start singing what appeared to be straightforward versions of songs, and then go off on mad tangents, ranting and raving with extraordinary precision; he did this once on The Tonight Show, during a performance of Elvis Presley's \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\", terrifying the audience in the process.\n\nTo judge from his rants, you could be forgiven for think­ing that Kinison lived in an emotional world that mirrored Bruegel's \"Triumph Of Death\", one of his portraits of extravagant human suf­fering. Most of his material was the result of his disastrous first two marriages, to Patricia Adkins (1975-1980) and Terry Marze (1981- 1989). These relationships were responsible for so much material it could often fill up an entire performance. When I saw him at the Comedy Store almost the entire set was based around this, a vehe­ment litany of disaster, attrition and hate. \"I don't worry about terrorism,\" he'd say during this time. \"I was married for two years.\"\n\nAfter he and his first wife were divorced, he abandoned preaching and took up comedy as a profession. \"I have lived a carnal life,\" he'd cry, moving around the stage like a prize fighter, swaying from side to side, ever keen to make his point. \"My view of life is, 'If you're going to miss heaven, why miss it by two inches? Miss it!' I don't have to go through the thing of paying for it in the next life. I know I'm screwed in the next life.\"\n\nHis scream soon became Kinison's trademark, his calling card, his \"thing\". It stemmed from the relationship with his wife Terry. They'd been arguing for three days, and on the third day he was due to appear at the Comedy Store, and he went on stage in a complete rage. Right down the front, there was a couple, cuddling, kissing, publicising their love. Looking at this picture of young love, Kinison suddenly snapped, and started addressing them from the stage. \"Do you love her?\" he asked the guy. \"I don't know - we're just dating,\" said the man.\n\nKinison said: \"Look at her. This is the best it's ever going to be. Look at her. If you ever decide you want to marry her, and you want to have a little house with the white picket fence, I want you to remember this face.\"\n\nBill Kinison [Sam's elder brother] was in the audience that night: \"He got down and he just screamed in the guy's face. Only, Sam's mad. It's not a joke to him. He is so p*d off this couple is sitting there, like they're going to live blissfully ever after, and he was living in s. It happened to end up being his niche - that scream.\"\n\nI've lived a carnal life. My view is: if you're going to miss Heaven, why miss it by two inches? Miss it! I don't have to go through the thing of paying for it in the next life. I know I'm screwed in the next life\n\nKinison would pace the stage, telling all about the latest in a pro­cession of women who had taken his money, his apartment, his records, his clothes, his time, his heart. He would walk on stage to an ovation that could have been heard three states away. \"If I get married again, I want a guy there with a drum to do rimshots during the vows. You fing whore!!! * You used me! You never loved me! I hope you slide under a gas truck and taste your own blood!Die! Die! Die!I want my records back! I want my f*ing records back!\" \"I don't think there's anyone working in comedy over the age of 30 who doesn't know who Sam Kinison is,\" said James Corden, as he was being photographed for GQ's Comedy Issue. \"Like the best stand-up comedians, he was incredibly honest, and you always felt like he was leaving a bit of himself on the stage. Those are the co­medians who you absolutely fall in love with... or hate. And the truth is, the best comedians in the world, the ones who have an actual legacy, are the people who some people absolutely can't bear, and he was one of them. He just had such passion on stage. I also see it in Billy Connolly; it's a similar thing. Sometimes his jokes become rants, but for some reason you're still just enthralled by it; it's just one stream of consciousness. One long stream of rage.\"\n\nKinison's jokes didn't need unpacking - they were in your face.\n\nThe various iterations of his act included sideswipes at Christianity, the Bible, and any evangelical scandal that caught his eye (and there were a lot during the Eighties). Of course, it was ironic that a former Pentecostal preacher built an entire career around telling jokes about sex and God. He was a preacher who made comedy-club audiences his congregation, treating his sets as protracted sermons. He didn't just re-purpose his preaching style, he re-purposed his material, too. One of his favourite tricks was recounting the argument Jesus has with his wife following his return home after the Resurrection.\n\nJesus' wife: \"And where have you been for the past three days, Mr Winemaker?\"\n\nJesus: \"It's OK, I'll tell you... Not that it's important or anything, but I was dead!!! I'm in a fin' grave outside of town! I'm fightin' death, Hell, decompo­sure! I'm changin' spiritual form, about to enter the Kingdom of God, and I go, 'Wait a second! I gotta go back because she doesn't know where I've been!' \"Hell? I was married for two f**ing years. Hell would be like Club Med!\"\n\nHe would go to places other comics avoided. For instance, his routine about starvation in Ethiopia usually went like this: \"You want to help world hunger? Stop sending them food. Don't send them another bite, send them U-Hauls [rented trucks]. Send them a guy that says, 'You know, we've been coming here giving you food for about 35 years now and we were driving through the desert, and we realised there wouldn't be world hunger if you people would live where the food is! You live in a desert!! Understand that? You live in a fing desert!!! Nothing grows here! Nothing's gonna grow here!Come here. You see this? This is sand. You know what it's gonna be 100 years from now?It's gonna be sand. You live in a f*ing desert! * We have deserts in America, we just don't live in them, assholes!'\" \"He even had a routine about [Operation] Desert Storm,\" said Bill. \"He was talking about how, in 20 years from now, these guys are going to walk into VFW [Veterans of Foreign Wars] and they're going to go, 'Hey, I was in World War Two, man, what war were you in?' and they'd go, 'I was in Desert Storm. Yeah, that was a hell of a weekend!' I've had parties that lasted longer than that war.\"\n\nPerhaps predictably, for one so aligned with all things long-haired and metal, he hated rap, just didn't understand it, and went out of his way to disparage it: \"Fin' album sold two million records with a song called 'Suck My D'! Like the guy got up one morning and went, 'You know, today I wanna write a song.\n\nToday I want to write a love song. I want to write a song that tells how a woman and a man feel when they meet each other for the first time and they fall in love; I want to put into words feelings that men have always had, but they've never been able to express.\n\nAll right, I think I'll call this song... \"Suck My D***\".'\"\n\nThere was a longer routine, too... \"Not that I want to put the entire rap music style down - I just don't like it. And I know some­where there's gotta be another guy like that. There's gotta be a guy just like that - just like me. There's gotta be somebody, some­where... Maybe, maybe an assassin type. Maybe a man who, oh, after he came home from the war, wasn't accepted by the country he fought for. And still has some of the military weapons and some of the arma­ments that he came home with - and he's home alone, unemployed, has nothing to do, and he watches MTV waiting for a rock video, and all he sees is rap videos. Now let's just say - let's just say - this guy decides to become a serial killer. Far be it from me to implant that into somebody's mind. I don't want people to think, 'Sam, you're putting a subliminal thought in a dangerous person's mind' - no! I'm just saying if you're gonna be a serial killer, *pick somebody interest­ing to be a serial killer for! Take out rappers! Shoot 'em! * If you're gonna do something like that - if you're gonna take life - be the rapper killer!\"\n\nCelebrity, John Updike famously said, \"is a mask that corrodes the face.\" Sam Kinison's was corroding long before he became famous. When he was a kid, he was fascinated with horror figures, and making dummies. He liked to dress in black, and had a cruel sense of humour.\n\nSamuel Burl Kinison was born on 8 December 1953, in Yakima, Washington, to Marie and Samuel Kinison, both Pentecostal preachers. He lived for much of his childhood in Peoria, Illinois, along with his three broth­ers, Richard, Bill and Kevin, all of whom eventually followed in their parents' foot­steps by becoming preachers. While his elder brothers preached, initially Kinison would be larking about in the wings, or at the back of the stage.\n\nHe'd get in the back of the church, behind everyone, and pull down his trousers. Or else he'd hijack the piano and instead of playing hymns play Scott Joplin's \"The Entertainer\".\n\nHis parents divorced when Sam was eleven, splitting the family in two. \"I went with my father, and Sam felt my father and I had abandoned him,\" said Bill. \"He wanted to go with my dad too. We all kind of idolised our dad. To him, we abandoned him. Even though I lived, you know, five miles away and basi­cally saw him every day, and eventually moved back after a couple of years. So Sam got kinda angry.\" It was around this time Sam began listening to comedy albums, especially those by fellow Peorian Richard Pryor, enjoying the outspoken nature of his rou­tines. He started displaying classic signs of the wayward teenager and, worried he was about to flunk his exams, he was sent to Pinecrest Bible Training Center in upstate New York. His father died soon after, which was when the ministry became a fait accompli. He used to say he had a \"Julian Lennon thing\", and he had to start preaching to please \"Dear old Dad\".\n\nOddly, considering that his stand-up routine was so obviously designed to be outrageous, he wasn't an especially good preacher, and even though he did it for seven years, from the age of 17 to 24, he wasn't as popular as he ought to have been. Bill said that he was always too concerned with making his sermons informative rather than entertaining. \"Ironically he had no stage presence. He never had one year that he made more than $5,000 being a minister.\n\nYet, my brother Richard and I, there were some nights where we made more than what he made in an entire year.\"\n\nKinison started thinking about alternative careers - including comedy - but then the decision was made for him. \"I got divorced, which was not a good thing for a revivalist minister,\" he said. \"It did not go down well.\" So he decided to try stand-up. \"I'd already been banned from a couple churches for my jokes. So one day I woke up and decided it was time to start living for myself.\"\n\nThe legendary Hollywood producer Sam Spiegel once said about himself: \"I have to believe in myself, because if I didn't, who would?\" And you can say the same thing about Kinison. After all, why would anyone bet on a failed preacher making it as a comic? Sam Kinison began his second career in Texas. His mother had remarried - another preacher - and had moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma. And so Sam started playing the comedy circuit in cowboy country. He moved to Houston, a town he knew, and went to the Comedy Workshop, a recently converted strip club. And as he would later tell\n\nRolling Stone, after years of trying to sell God, he found it relatively easy to put across his jokes. He thought that as he'd made people laugh in church, he could do it in a club. Kinison considered himself a believer but he said Jesus wasn't coming back; he was already inside you. \"You can deliver yourself,\" he told audiences.\n\nThere was a group at the Comedy Workshop known as the Texas Outlaw Comics, that was comprised of Bill Hicks, Riley Barber, Ron Shock, Steve Epstein, Jimmy Pineapple, and Kinison. The first night Bill Hicks saw Kinison on stage, in 1979, Kinison stretched a pair of red knickers over his head and screamed, \"Call me Mr Lonely!\" before jumping into the audience and simulat­ing intercourse with a man in the front row. \"There were nights when he would drive the entire room out the door,\" said Hicks, \"and the other comics would be rolling on the floor as the last person out would be screaming,\n\n'This is horrible!'\" Kinison was a huge influence on Hicks: \"What I learned from Sam was this. He was the first guy I ever saw to go on stage and not in any way ask the audience to like him. That gave me confidence because then I knew you could just be yourself.\"\n\nSam Kinison's greatest asset was that he just didn't give a s***.\n\nHe just didn't care. To walk out onto a stage and go, 'I don't care if these people don't like me; in fact, I'll be quite happy if a lot of them don't' - that really takes something.\"\n\nAt the same Houston club a few months earlier, he had exploded with rage when a stool collapsed after he'd sat on it. He was already self-conscious about his ballooning weight, and when the stool broke he started shouting. \"What is this cheap piece of s***?\" he screamed, throwing the stool to the floor. Then he picked up one of the heavy wooden and vinyl chairs in the audience and threw it at the wall, causing a huge gash in the process. He stared at the wall for a few moments, said, \"Well, I can't follow that.\n\nGood night,\" and walked off, nearly causing a riot in the process.\n\nThe next day the club owner suspended him for two weeks. The following evening Kinison arrived at the club in a rented limo, and held a mock crucifixion across the street, wearing nothing but a dirty towel and the contents of a ketchup bottle.\n\nNo one should have been surprised. The licence plate on his car read \"EX-REV\".\n\nNow ensconced in Texas, he met Terry Marze. This would lead tothe \"marriage from hell\" that inspired his first gut-wrenching roar. Inevitably the saga was turned into a routine: \"I married her just to p*** another woman off, man. Very stupid, dumb, high, drunk thing to f***ing do.\"\n\nIn 1980, Kinison moved to LA, in the hope of finding work at the Comedy Store. Once there, he started living like an aspiring rock star, and developed a penchant for cocaine, learning to freebase almost immediately. He had a prodigious appetite, and could hoover up five or six grams a night. His material changed, too. \"The best pitch I ever heard about cocaine was back in the early Eighties,\" he'd say, \"when a street dealer followed me down the sidewalk going, 'I got some great blow, man. I got the stuff that killed Belushi.'\" Or, \"Folks, I've been straight for 17 days... Not all in a row...\"\n\nAlternatively, \"Boy, detox... $13,000 for three weeks. First of all folks, if you can come up with $13,000, you don't have a problem yet. You're not in serious shape yet. S***. Thirteen f***ing grand, yeah that would sober me up.\"\n\nHis brother Bill was sending $500 every month, until he came out to visit him and found out he was sleeping on bar tables and using coke.\n\nIn no time at all he established a rapport with the rock'n'roll fra­ternity. He was funny, he was foul, he liked drugs and enjoyed staying up till dawn. Sam Kinison and LA were made for each other. \"Sam never had a drink until he was 25 years old and got into comedy,\" said Bill. \"So, to hear him getting up, using, 'F***,' and talk about licking p****... Afterwards, he asked me, he said, 'What do you think?' I said, 'Dude, you don't have to use that language to be funny.' He reminded me - and he reminded me many times af­terwards as I was managing him - 'We're not in church now.' It was quite a shock. What I was really happy about was to see Sam doing something that he was good at. My mother, it took her quite a bit longer. We didn't play our hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma - where she lived - until 1990, out of respect to her, and the church. She got used to it. Of course, that was after he bought her a Mercedes and a $30,000 ring.\"\n\nTheir father had always said, \"Sam will get in trouble, and Bill will get him out.\" And that was how the scenario began to play itself out. Sam had been in LA for five years before his brother came out to rescue him, and rescue him is what he did, by becoming his manager. Tired of preaching, and wanting to help his brother, he became his professional guardian. \"He had an addictive personality,\" said Bill. \"When he started drinking, he had to drink all the time; when he started doing cocaine, he didn't do a little bit - he had to be there until all the coke was gone. That was his personality, and I knew that unless somebody came out and managed and took care of his business, he was never going to be anything.\n\nHe was a doorman at the Comedy Store for five years. I came out here think­ing, 'I've got a couple of years that I can afford to do this, let's see what we can do.'\"\n\nBill now lives in the small dormitory town of Upland, 40 miles east of Los Angeles, most of which looks like the small town in Back To The Future. He is 62 (five years older than Sam would have been), and though he has dabbled in management, film production, the church and local politics in the 20 years since his brother's death, his passion for much of this time has been Upland's Grove Theatre, a folksy auditorium next to a small dry-cleaners, a small antiques shop and an even smaller grocery store. His biography *Brother Sam * has also just been optioned as a movie. \"I was a minister for 15 years, just about the polar opposite of Sam,\" he told me, as we sat in a noisy trattoria around the corner from the Grove. \"Sam and I had a relationship that was more like a father-son. I basically raised my brothers. When he came and told me he was getting divorced, I said, 'I want you to forget about your family, your friends, and look down in your heart and see what you always wanted to do. Well, he took about three seconds, and said he'd always wanted to be a stand-up. I said, 'Set a date. No matter what happens, you're never going to go back to preaching.'\"\n\nBill didn't see it coming - the comedy - but in hindsight he isn't surprised. \"He was always a funny child. Sam was always unpredictable. He got hit by a truck when he was three years old, and it totally changed his personality. He went from being a very docile, quiet child to being this loud, outrageous, always-in-trouble kind of kid. Never in serious trouble, but we got to know the police on a first-name basis at our house. Out of that accident, he had 40 per cent brain damage. He had grand mal epilepsy - he didn't have any seizures, but they thought around the age of 40, he would do. Obviously, he didn't make it [to 40], but he was always concerned with that. The interesting thing about it is, that was held totally within the family - not even his wives or girlfriends ever knew.\"\n\nThe full extent of Sam's brain damage and epilepsy was only made public after he died. (Tragically, the eldest Kinison boy, Richard, was born with severe learning difficulties and, though he graduated from high school, was the youngest emotionally of all of them.) \"With Sam, what you saw was what was there,\" said Bill. \"He didn't exaggerate for the stage. You had two different people: you had Sam off-stage and you had Sam on-stage. They were both the same person. But, when he was on stage, that was a licence to get up and say whatever he wanted about anything to a big group of people.\n\nOff-stage, he'd still be very opinionated about how he felt. A crude example was when he was talking about the 'ABCs' when having oral sex with a woman. Well, he was dating a bisexual girl, and one night she told him, 'You don't have a clue about eating p****, so I'm going to tell you,' and he just goes up on stage and says that:\n\n'I got a girlfriend, and I didn't know what I was doing, but I'm going to help every one of you tonight, and you're going to lick the ABCs, A... B... C...' [outlining the letters with his tongue].\n\nThose were his life experiences. And when it came to the political stuff, that was his viewpoint. Was he angry on stage? Most of the time he was.\"\n\nBill learned all the management stuff as he went along, discover­ing how to negotiate with promoters, union leaders and landlords, while also trying to keep his charge out of prison. \"The last seven years in the ministry was in civic centres and city arenas - where Sam eventually played. So, I knew the stage venues, which was kind of comical 'cause I would come in, and they would go, 'Hey, Reverend Kinison!' and I'd go,\n\n'Yeah, we've got a different message this time.'\"\n\nKinison got his break on an HBO Rodney Dangerfield special in 1984, although it was his performance on Late Night With David Letterman a year later that really brought him public recognition, due in part to Letterman's introduction: \"Brace yourselves. I'm not kidding. Please welcome Sam Kinison.\"\n\nHe made his film debut in Dangerfield's 1986 filmBack To School, playing a short-tempered professor, but it didn't lead to anything resembling a career. Kinison was simply too odd looking, and too unpredictable. He pinballed from disaster to disaster, and after one bust-up too many, was dropped by his agency CAA. The same year, granted a stand-up spot onSaturday Night Live,Kinison ignored censors and imitated Jesus screaming as he was nailed to the cross. \"I got so many f***ing rumours on me, man,\" he said once in an interview. \"About drugs, I carry guns, I'm out here with two 16-year-olds sucking on a base pipe waiting for my heart to stop.\n\nIf you say you don't do it, it sounds like you're hiding, so you just go, 'Yeah, whatever, I did it all, I do it all.'\"\n\nAt the height of his popularity, Kinison was performing with some of the biggest rock acts in the world, including Mötley Crüe and Ozzy Osbourne. He was such the quintessential rock'n'roll comedian that in 1988 he appeared in the video for Bon Jovi's \"Bad Medicine\" single. The same year he recorded a novelty version (could there be any other in 1988?) of \"Wild Thing\" by the Troggs, which appeared on his album Have You Seen Me Lately? The video was a huge MTV hit, featuring cameos from Billy Idol, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry from Aerosmith, Slash and Steven Adler from Guns N' Roses, Steve Vai, Ratt, Dweezil Zappa, Tommy Lee, Richie Sambora, and even the model Jessica Hahn (whom Kinison dated, and who is probably best known for a sex scandal involving TV evangelist Jim Bakker while she was employed as a church secretary).\n\nJudy McGrath was the chairwoman and CEO of MTV from 2004 to 2011. \"The 'hair metal bands' loved MTV and they had a huge number of fans. But their videos promoted the objectification of women.\n\nThere were years here when it was hard to be a woman. I had a conversation with [Warner Bros executive] Jeff Ayeroff about the Sam Kinison video for 'Wild Thing'. He said, 'I understand that you have to play it. But did you have to make it a hit?'\" \"Sam Kinison's 'Wild Thing' was the nastiest video I ever made,\" said its director Marty Callner. \"That was the misogynist, evil side of rock'n'roll. I loved it.\"\n\nKinison drank well, had an eye for an ankle, and rarely refused the use of a rolled-up dollar bill. But the bigger he became, and the more his fame spread, so his act became rather reductive, and his material got broader. He'd have entire routines about homosexuality that were designed to appeal to a young male crowd, but which were not just borderline offensive, they were infantile. He would occasionally apologise to gay groups for some of his controversial AIDS material, but the contrition didn't really ring true.\n\nKinison would later regret using any AIDS material, and a lot of it was so offensive that when he insisted on including it on one of his comedy albums, the record company reacted in kind, putting a sticker on the cover: \"Opinions expressed in this recording do not reflect the views of Warner Bros Records.\" The gay community went to war with him too. When Elton John appeared on the 2nd Annual International Rock Awards on ABC in 1990, which was being hosted by Kinison, he leant into the mic and said, \"I'm doing this show under protest. I'd like to congratulate Sam Kinison on being the first pig ever to introduce a rock'n'roll show.\" Elton had drawn a line in the sand, Kinison was humiliated, and it was this moment that forced him to later evaluate what he was actually shouting about in his AIDS rants.\n\nIt was around the time of \"Wild Thing\", also, that his behaviour became increasingly erratic, and it was during this period that he is alleged to have fathered a daughter with the wife of his former best friend, the comedian Carl La Bove.\n\nBill was on the road with his brother 280 days of the year. He had to make sure he caught planes and trains, and wherever they went, he'd have drug dealers arrested. It was continual. After five years of madness, he finally forced his brother to come clean, or at least try to get clean. Bill found a rehab centre in Malibu called the Log Cabin (he said it was \"Like going to church, except Ozzy Osbourne was there\") and Sam started to kick the dope and the booze. In the 18 months before he died, Sam was relatively clean.\n\nEvery two or three months he'd fall spectacularly off the wagon, but at least it wasn't every night. \"There were times that I would go find him, and I didn't know if he was going to make it,\" said Bill. \"Finally, the breaking point was about a year and a half before he got killed. We came back from a disaster in Vegas on New Year's Eve - we refunded $42,000 on the show, he was drunk, out of control and people walked out and demanded their money. That month of January, right after that, he had three wrecks from drink-driving. At the end of the month, we sat down with the money manager and business manager, and they basically told him, 'You're broke,' and I was sitting there and I told him, 'Dude, I can't do this any more. I'm done.' I ended up in divorce - I ended up with shingles on my face, from the stress.\"\n\nA salient problem was getting rid of the liggers. \"Sam liked to surround himself with 'yes' people - I call them leeches. Sam could go, 'I want to get on stage tonight and just s*** right in the middle of the stage!' And these fricking idiots would all be going,\n\n'That's great man, that's great!'\"\n\nBy the time of Sam's death, Bill thought his brother was about to go back to preaching. Not by abandoning comedy, but as a way of fusing his two worlds. He never felt like he had to reconcile any­thing with God, never felt like he lost his relationship with God. But he had become lost.\n\nOn 10 April, 1992, five days after he married his 27-year-old girlfriend Malika Souiri in a typically shambolic Kinisonian service (\"Yeah, I'm going to do it like a tattoo, man,\" Sam told his brother Bill. \"I'm going to get drunk, I'm going to do it, and in the morning, I'm going to get up and go, 'I did what?'\"), Kinison died after his white 1989 Pontiac Trans Am was hit by a pickup truck on Route 95 near Needles, California. He was on his way to Laughlin, Nevada, to perform at a sold-out concert. The 17-year-old boy driving the truck had been drinking, although not as much as Kinison had; the autopsy found that as well as booze, the comedian had cocaine, painkillers and tranquillizers in his bloodstream. Kinison wasn't wearing a seat belt, and he hit the windshield with his head. He was taken to the Needles Desert Community Hospital, and those who were there thought he stood a good chance of surviving. \"None of us knew he was dying,\" said Bill. \"He was speaking clearly, his eyes were clear. But, near the end, it was like he was telling somebody, 'I don't want to die.' Like he was negotiating - it wasn't fearful. It was like someone was telling him, 'It's time for you to go,' and he was like, 'I don't want to die.' Second time, he went, 'I don't want to die.' And the third time he went,\n\n'OK, OK, OK,' and he was gone. That was it.\" When he died, Kinison had a fractured skull, a broken neck, a torn heart and a torn stomach.\n\nKinison was buried in the Memorial Park Cemetery in Tulsa.\n\nInscribed on his grave are the following words: \"In another time and place he would have been called prophet.\" \"Some people seem almost disappointed that Sam didn't die from his excesses,\" said Howard Stern, fondly, some time later. \"Anyone who writes the guy off as the Fatty Arbuckle of the Eighties - some wild, partying maniac with zero talent - is just completely missing the point.\""
