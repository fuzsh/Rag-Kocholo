        "text": "Yugoslavia National Team List of Results - Introduction Page\n\nIntroduction for 1920-1999\n\nIntroduction for 2000-2009\n\nMatch Details Files\n\n1920-29|1930-39| 1940-49|1950-59| 1960-69|1970-79| 1980-89|1990-99| 2000-09\n\nMatch Overview Files\n\nYugoslavia 1920-1992\n\nBosnia-Herzegovina| Croatia| Macedonia| Slovenia| Yugoslavia/Serbia and Montenegro (Serbia|Montenegro)\n\nIntroduction for 1920-1999\n\nThe South Slavs (or Yugoslavs) are one of the five major ethnic groups of the Balkan Peninsula, incorporating the Serb, Croat, and Slovene peoples. Although the movement for political unification of these people dated back to at least the early 19th century, the South Slavs had historically been separated and controlled by various neighboring powers, such as Turkey, Italy, Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria. Political entities in the period leading up to World War I (1914-1918) included the independent states of Serbia (including teritory of FYRM, but without Vojvodina) and Montenegro, mainly inhabited by Serbs, with some Turk and Albanian minorities; Bosnia and Herzegovina under the sovereignty of Austria-Hungary, inhabited by Serbs, Croats, and Turk decendents (given the status of muslem nation in Tito's era); Croatia and Slavonia, a semiautonomous dependency of Hungary and later an Austrian crown land, inhabited by Croats with Serbian, Hungarian, and German minorities; and Dalmatia, a possession of Austria, mainly inhabited by Croats, with some Italians and Serbs. But despite these divisions and profound ethnic and cultural differences among the South Slavs, the desire for statehood remained strong. The assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria by a Serb nationalist Gavrilo Princip touched off World War I, as Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia in 1914. Occupation of Serbia by the Central Powers coalition during World War I and the subsequent formation, by South Slavs in exile, of a committee for national unity paved the way for creation of the Yugoslav state. The political principles for unity were enunciated in the Corfu Declaration in 1917, signed by representatives of the committee and of the Serbian government in exile. Essentially, the declaration provided for the establishment of a federated constitutional monarchy under the Karadjordjevic line of Serbian kings. The disintegration of the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary in the final months of World War I gave tremendous impetus to the South Slav independence movement. In October 1918 representatives from the various South Slav dependencies under Austrian and Hungarian sovereignty assembled at Zagreb. After organizing a provisional government, the delegates approved a resolution for union with Serbia. The national assembly of Montenegro took similar action in November. Alexander, Prince of Serbia, pending recovery of his ailing father, King Peter I Karadjordjevic of Serbia, accepted the regency of the provisional government on December 1, 1918. The new state, officially titled the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, was then proclaimed. Subsequently, Football Federation was founded in 1919, even though the first club had been founded in Subotica in 1901: FK Backa. The club was presented to the public in a friendly game against Hungarian side TK Mohacs. In 1903 Beograd and Zagreb got their first football babies: Soko (Seagull) and HA?K (Hrvatski Akademski ?portski Klub - Croatian Academic Sport Club). Football gained a lot of popularity, so clubs were founded in Ljubljana (Ilirija), Kragujevac (?umadija), Novi Sad (NAK), Sarajevo (Gradjanski), Varazdin (VG?K), Split (Hajduk), Beograd (BSK, Jugoslavija, BASK...), Zagreb (Gradjanski, Concordia, Akademija, PNI?K)... Yugoslav national team played its first international game at Olympic Tournament in Antwerp in 1920. Two heavy defeats and last place at the tournament, followed by moderate plays at Olympics in Paris and Amsterdam, did not discourage football pioneers. National team kept playing friendlies and local tournaments (Balkan Cup, Neoghoring Countries Cup), and in 1930 participated at First World Cup in Uruguay. First national championship took place in 1923 and the winners were Gradjanski Zagreb. Until World War II, Gradjanski and BSK Beograd won five titles a piece and provided major backbone for national team. In 1929, the headquarters of FSJ (Fudbalski Savez Jugoslavije - Yugoslav Football Federation) were moved from Zagreb to Beograd. Antagonism between Serbian and Croatian officials erupted twice. First in 1930, when Croatian clubs prohibited their players to play for national team, and then in 1933 when championship was not held, since the clubs could not agree on competition system. During World War II, there was no national competition or international games. Semiautonomous Croatia played some games with their nazi allies: Germany, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. Communist authorities were looking for an affirmation through football as well. Hajduk Split (converted to National Army team) played some friendlies with English allies and visited Italy and Egypt. Some famous players joined Serbian Royal Army (Chetniks), communsists or Croatian Ustashi, and lost their lives. The most famous football victim was Milutin Ivkovic, 1930 World Cup hero, who had earned 39 caps for national team. After World War II, majority of clubs had to change their names or ceased to exist. Among the survivors, Hajduk Split, Vojvodina, and BSK were the most prominent sides. Gradjanski, Concordia and HA?K Zagreb unofficially merged to Dinamo Zagreb, Crvena zvezda started playing at the gound of SK Jugoslavija, Yugoslav Army founded Partizan Beograd. Most of newly founded clubs had politically correct names: Sloboda (Freedom), Napredak (Progress), Metalac (Metal worker), Radnik (Laborer), Radnicki (Workers' Club), Buducnost (Future), Proleter (Communist), Rudar (Miner), Zeljeznicar (Rail worker)... Yugoslavia hosted European Championship finals in 1976. Czechoslovakia surprisingly won it, leaving Germany F.R., Netherlands and Yugolsavia behind. Crvena zvezda stadion, the biggest stadium in the country, built in 1964, hosted the final game, as well as European Champions Cup final in 1973, when Ajax defeated Juventus. Although Yugoslav national team has always had very respected players and coaches, the greatest achievement at World Cup came in 1930. Even though majority of European football forces did not bother participating, the victory over Brazil and third place shared with USA, remained the greatest success in World Cup history. Due to high insurances requested by Croatian clubs, national team ended up fielding all players from Beograd clubs with two professionals playing in France. One Croat, though, was one of the best scorers of the tournament. It was Ivan Bek. The squad could have definitely used some help from some important players (goalkeeper Maksimilijan Mihelcic, central defender Danijel Premerl and forward Antun Bonacic) from Croatian clubs. Aleksandar Tirnanic, Milorad Arsenijevic, Milutin Ivkovic and Blagoje Marjanovic were the legends of Yugoslav football at that competition. Yugoslavia participated at nine final tournaments and reached semi-finals again in 1962. Drazen Jerkovic was the joint topscorer of the tournament, and Dragoslav ?ekularac (\"Enfant Terrible\") was elected in the best team of the championship. Four more times, \"Plavi\" (the \"Blues\") reached 1/4 finals (1954, 1958, 1974, and 1990), failing to qualify to the second round just twice (in 1950 and 1982). Yugoslavia had more success at European Championships. They reached finals twice (in 1960 and 1968), and semi-finals once, in 1976. Yugoslavia played Soviet Union in 1960 finals, and lost in overtime. Eight years later, Dragan Dzajic was the topscorer of the tournament in Italy. His free kick against world champions England put Yugoslavia through to the finals for the second time. Host country Italy needed two games (and some help from Swiss referee, according to some sources) to overcome \"Plavi\" at Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Fourth place at 1976 championship, played in Beograd and Zagreb was considered a disaster. Yugoslavia had a comfortable 2:0 lead over rulling European and World champions, but within last 15 minutes Germans managed to come back and eliminate Yugoslavia in overtime. Brightest moments for Yugoslav football came in Olympic Games. Yugoslavia won Olympic tournament in Rome in 1960, and reached finals three more times (1948, 1952, and 1956). One bronze medal (1984) and fourth place (1980) make Yugoslav total of five Olympic medals equal to Hungary and Soviet Union. Until 1972, there was no segregation between Olympic and A team. Since then, they operate as two different selections. Yugoslav U-21 team won the Youth World Cup in Chile in 1987 (known as \"Cileanci\" - Chile boys). Their rise at full international level was stopped by civil war in 1991. Undoubtedly best generation of Yugoslav football was banned from international competition in the eve of Euro'92. They returned to France'98, but some of them were already out of the peak of their careers. Savicevic, Mijatovic, Jugovic, and Mihajlovic missed major international competitions while playing the best football of their careers in Milan, Real Madrid, Sampdoria, Roma and other leading European clubs. Suker, Boban, Prosinecki, Jarni and Stimac, on the other hand, started playing for their new homeland - Croatia. At club level, Yugoslav teams started playing important role in European football at the very beginning of European club competitions. In only second edition of European Champions Cup in 1957, Crvena zvezda reached the semi-finals. More successes arrived in the sixties. Dinamo Zagreb (founded as HA?K, today known as Croatia Zagreb), won Fairs Cup in 1967 and reached the finals in 1963. Great players like Drazan Jerkovic, Vladimir Markovic and Slaven Zambata showed their class in international competitions and at national team, but could not win a domestic title. It was the era of Partizan Beograd, who reached European Champions finals in 1966. Partizan could easily field two lineups of players who played for national team. Goalkeeper Milutin Soskic, defenders Fahrudin Jusufi and Velibor Vasovic, and striker Milan Galic were the best players of the generation. In seventies, Crvena zvezda lost to Borussia Mönchengladbach in 1979 UEFA Cup finals. Non-typical Yugoslav team, who did not base its strength on fine technical skills, but rather on team play, discipline, energy, speed and stamina (they were always behind and three times their winning goal was scored in last three minutes). Midfield captain Vladimir Petrovic and prolific striker Dusan Savic were the leader of that generation. After some moderate results in eighties (three UEFA Cup semi-finals, Radnicki Nis in 1982, Hajduk Split in 1984 and Zeljeznicar Sarajevo in 1985), Crvena zvezda Beograd won European Champions Cup and Intercontinental Cup in 1991. Club with major Serbian stars Savicevic, Mihajlovic and Jugovic, enforced by likes of Romanian Serb Belodedici, Croatian Prosinecki, Bosnian Sabanadzovic, and Macedonians Pancev and Najdoski, swept through the competition without a defeat. Since 1920, Yugoslavia had 23 coaches and 13 coaching commissions (see the list of national coaches). Aleksandar Tirnanic was on national team bench for record 125 times (from 1946 to 1967, independently, or as a member of various commissions). Dragan Dzajic played record 85 games for national team, from 1964 to 1979 (see the list of players with most caps). The best scorer in the history of Yugoslav national team is Stjepan Bobek, with 38 goals (see the list of players with most goals). Yugoslav players earned call-ups to various international selections. In 1953 England played \"The Rest of Europe\" on behalf of ninetieth anniversary of English Football Association. Zlatko Cajkovski, Branko Zebec, Bernard Vukas, and Vladimir Beara were selected in European team. After them, Vujadin Boskov, Milutin Soskic, Dragan Dzajic, Enver Maric, Josip Skoblar, Petar Krivokuca, Miroslav Pavlovic, Josip Katalinski, Dragan Pantelic, Safet Susic, Vladimir Petrovic, Nenad Stojkovic, Vahid Halilhodzic, Ivica Surjak, Velimir Zajec, and Slavisa Jokanovic played in numerous selections over past several decades. While playing for Olympique Marseille, Josip Skoblar became first Yugoslav player to win Golden Boot award in 1971. Darko Pancev, topscorer of Crvena zvezda golden generation, scored record 34 goals in 1990/91 season. Dragan Dzajic was placed third at France Football's \"European Footballer of the Year Award\" in 1968. In 1991, Dejan Savicevic and Darko Pancev were tied for second place with Lotthar Matthäus, and in 1997, Predrag Mijatovic was placed second. Same weekly gave Yugoslavia \"European Team of the Year\" award in 1979. Six straight victories and gold medal at Mediterranean Games in Split helped them achieve that award. Today, former Yugoslavia is divided into five countries: F.R. Yugoslavia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and F.Y.R. Macedonia. They are separate countries, separate football associations, separate leagues, separate national teams. The future of football organization in Bosnia-Herzegovina is still undetermined. Republika Srpska (Serbian part of Bosnia-Herzegovina) and Herceg-Bosna (Croatian part) have their own separate leagues, but no national teams. Best players tend to play for Yugoslav and Croatian teams respectively. The only Bosnian Serbs who played for Yugoslav national team are Zaragoza strike Savo Milosevic and occasional starter Risto Vidakovic, while Mario Stanic is irreplaceable member of Croatian national team.

However, as far as I know, players were awarded caps for that match. The friendly against the Hong Kong League in 2000 was also unofficial and players were not awarded caps for that match.
