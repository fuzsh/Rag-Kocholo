Six fixtures were also held there during the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nAny Dortmund fan will tell you that the highlight of this stadium is the Yellow Wall, which is one end of the stadium where Dortmund fans congregate in great numbers to parade their famous yellow and black flags.\n\nDusseldorf: Dusseldorf Arena\n\nCapacity: 47,000\n\nInauguration: 2004\n\nFixtures:\n\n⚽ 17/06: Austria vs France (19:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 21/06: Slovakia vs Ukraine (13:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 24/06: Albania vs Spain (19:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 01/07: Round of 16 (16:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 06/07: Quarterfinal (16:00 GMT)\n\nOpened in 2004, Dusseldorf Arena is one of the few Euro 2024 stadiums not used during the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe arena, more commonly known as the Merkur Spiel-Arena, will host five Euros fixtures, culminating in a quarterfinal on July 6.\n\nHome to the second division Fortuna Dusseldorf, and situated close to the Rhein River, the arena is one of the most architecturally impressive sports venues in Europe, with a nifty retractable roof, a heating system for those cold mid-winter matches and an aesthetically pleasing and symmetrical stadium design.\n\nFrankfurt: Frankfurt Arena\n\nCapacity: 47,000\n\nInauguration: 1925\n\nFixtures:\n\n⚽ 17/06: Belgium vs Slovakia (16:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 20/06: Denmark vs England (16:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 23/06: Switzerland vs Germany (19:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 26/06: Slovakia vs Romania (16:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 01/07: Round of 16 (19:00 GMT)\n\nDespite its nearly 100-year history at this site, the Frankfurt Arena, also known as the Waldstadion, is a fantastic example of an evolving stadium concept with the most recent remodelling incorporating a futuristic retractable roof and updated stadium seating suitable for the demands of the modern football age.\n\nThe stadium is home to title-contending Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt, who finished the 2023/24 season in sixth place on the ladder.\n\nAn absolute highlight of a visit to Frankfurt Arena is the retractable roof that folds into a giant scoreboard.\n\nFrankfurt Arena will host five matches at Euro 2024, including a prized Germany home fixture against Switzerland on June 23.\n\nGelsenkirchen: Arena AufSchalke\n\nCapacity: 50,000\n\nInauguration: 2001\n\nFixtures:\n\n⚽ 16/06: Serbia vs England (19:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 20/06: Spain vs Italy (19:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 26/06: Georgia vs Portugal (19:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 30/06: Round of 16 (13:00 GMT)\n\nAt 225,000, Gelsenkirchen is the smallest of the 10 Euro 2024 cities, but it more than makes up for it with some of the country’s most die-hard football supporters, who regularly pack out the 50,000 Arena AufSchalke, otherwise known as the Veltins-Arena.\n\nDespite being relegated to the German second division in 2021, home club FC Schalke 04 continuously draws sold-out crowds to the venue – and the stadium is one of the most modern and best multiuse facilities in Europe, featuring a retractable roof and a retractable pitch.\n\nArena AufSchalke hosted the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final and staged five matches at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIt will host four matches at Euro 2024, including the blockbuster Group B clash between Spain and Italy on June 20.\n\nHamburg: Volksparkstadion Hamburg\n\nCapacity: 49,000\n\nInauguration: 2000\n\nFixtures:\n\n⚽ 16/06: Poland vs Netherlands (13:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 19/06: Croatia vs Albania (13:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 22/06: Georgia vs Czechia (13:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 26/06: Czechia vs Turkey (19:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 05/07: Quarterfinal (19:00 GMT)\n\nThe Volksparkstadion opened in 2000 with the stadium hosting – like several other Euro 2024 venues – multiple matches during Germany’s 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe stadium is home to Hamburg SV, which is one of the Bundesliga’s founding clubs. The club was demoted to the second division in 2018.\n\nFor the 2023/24 UEFA Champions League, Volksparkstadion also served as the home stadium for Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk, who are unable to play at their normal home stadium due to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nVolksparkstadion will host five UEFA Euro 2024 matches, including four group stage fixtures and a quarterfinal.\n\nLeipzig: Leipzig Stadium\n\nCapacity: 42,000\n\nInauguration: 2004\n\nFixtures:\n\n⚽ 18/06: Portugal vs Czechia (19:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 21/06: Netherlands vs France (19:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 24/06: Croatia vs Italy (19:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 02/07: Round of 16 (19:00 GMT)\n\nLeipzig Stadium, or Zentralstadion, is the largest football arena in the former East Germany, with a crowd capacity of just over 40,000 for international games.\n\nAlso known by its corporate ownership name as the Red Bull Arena, the venue is home to Bundesliga club RB Leipzig, which, in 2010, took over the club naming rights following Red Bull’s takeover of the former Leipzig team, SSV Markranstadt.\n\nThe stadium is still referred to as the Zentralstadion by many fans.\n\nIn 1956, the first Zentralstadion opened and was one of the biggest stadiums in Europe at the time, holding more than 100,000 spectators.\n\nThe revamped Zentralstadion, finished in 2004, hosted five games for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nFor Euro 2024, the stadium will host four games, including the much-anticipated Netherlands vs France contest on June 21, and a round of 16 fixture.\n\nMunich: Munich Football Arena\n\nCapacity: 66,000\n\nInauguration: 2005\n\nFixtures:\n\n⚽ 14/06: Germany vs Scotland (19:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 17/06: Romania vs Ukraine (13:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 20/06: Slovenia vs Serbia (13:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 25/06: Denmark vs Serbia (19:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 02/07: Round of 16 (16:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 09/07: Semifinal (19:00 GMT)\n\nMunich Football Arena is Germany’s most famous modern stadium because of its eye-catching plastic panel shell exterior that spectacularly changes colour for night matches.\n\nBetter known as Allianz Arena, the venue is home to Germany’s richest and most successful club, Bayern Munich.\n\nIt was the only German stadium chosen for the COVID-delayed Euro 2020, which was co-hosted by 11 European nations.\n\nFor Euro 2024, Munich Football Arena will host a total of six games, including the tournament opener between host Germany and Scotland on June 14, as well as a semifinal on July 9.\n\nStuttgart: Stuttgart Arena\n\nCapacity: 51,000\n\nInauguration: 1933\n\nFixtures:\n\n⚽ 16/06: Slovenia vs Denmark (16:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 19/06: Germany vs Hungary (16:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 23/06: Scotland vs Hungary (19:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 26/06: Ukraine vs Belgium (16:00 GMT)\n\n⚽ 05/07: Quarterfinal (16:00 GMT)\n\nThe original stadium opened at this site in 1933 and has been rebuilt several times.\n\nStuttgart Arena has a long international footballing history, hosting matches in the 1974 FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Euro 1988 and the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nBundesliga club VfB Stuttgart calls this place home – and they used the stadium to good effect, performing brilliantly all season and finishing second behind Bayer Leverkusen in the 2023/24 season.\n\nGermany will play one of its three group matches here against Hungary on June 19. Stuttgart Arena, which is also known as the MHP Arena, will host one of the Euro 2024 quarterfinals."
