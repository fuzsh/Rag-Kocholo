        "text": "“It was an enormous surprise – we went to Munich and played an open game.” The quote is not from a Paris-Saint Germain player fresh from Wednesday’s Champions League victory at the Allianz Arena. Rather it is from Miodrag Belodedici, a member of the Red Star Belgrade side who 30 years ago, on 10 April, beat Bayern Munich 2-1 in a European Cup semi-final en route to winning the trophy.\n\nIt is worth seeking out the YouTube footage of Red Star’s first goal, a breakaway involving attacking talents such as Robert Prosinečki, Dejan Savičević and scorer Darko Pančev.\n\n“We played offensively,” Belodedidici, the former Romanian international, continues. “We had a lot of confidence and didn’t lose a single game. The coach [Ljubomir Petrović] said to us, ‘I’m going to talk you just about defending’.\n\n“Attacking-wise, it was just do what you know with players like [Sinisa] Mihaijlović, Pančev, Savičević, [Vladimir] Jugović and Prosinečki.”\n\nRed Star’s case is worth considering given the Champions League reforms, set to be announced this month, which critics fear will make the gulf even greater between Europe’s current elite and those teams with a proud past but comparatively few pennies.\n\nWhen Belodedici joined old colleagues at the Red Star-Bayern Champions League fixture in November 2019, the nostalgia of “a lap of the stadium with the trophy” was offset by a 6-0 drubbing.\n\n“They were saying getting to the group stage was like winning the European Cup before,” he adds, and given Serbia’s top flight has a TV deal which one source estimates as being worth €5m for five seasons, it is little wonder. The league’s general secretary, Darko Ramovš, considers Red Star’s four straight European group-stage participations – two in the Champions League, two in the Europa League – as “an incredible success for Serbian football”.\n\nGeopolitics must be mentioned too. That 1991 triumph came just before the break-up of Yugoslavia, whose competitive league featured Red Star, Belgrade rivals Partizan and the Croatian pair of Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split in a ‘Big Four’. State backing of sport was significant, as Belodedici well knows as the only player to have won the European Cup with two teams from the old Eastern Bloc.\n\nBefore defecting to Yugoslavia, he had triumphed in 1986 with Steaua Bucharest, the favourite team of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu’s son, Valentin. It was far from a perfect world – Ceauşescu Jr once ordered Steaua players’s off the field after they had a late goal disallowed in an abandoned Cup final against Bucharest rivals Dinamo – but there was a strong youth structure and opportunities to test themselves against Europe’s finest.\n\n“These were countries who before could fight to win trophies like the European Cup and UEFA Cup,” says Belodedici, now a Romanian FA ambassador.\n\n“They had strong teams that everyone in those countries wanted to play for. Now they’ve no chance of winning anything. They started to privatise, to bring in players from other countries, but not good players.”\n\nRamovš adds: “Europe has changed so much from that period. We’ve had major crises that weren’t of a football nature but in the last few years we’ve been trying to raise the quality of all clubs.”\n\nHence, like many others in the European Leagues Association, he is unhappy that two of the four new places in the enlarged Champions League are expected to go to clubs from the big western European nations – by virtue of their coefficient – rather than “more possibilities for the best clubs from the medium and small leagues”.\n\nAs a Slovenian who grew up in the former Yugoslavia, UEFA’s president Aleksander Čeferin has previously expressed his concerns about competitive balance at a time Europe’s top 30 clubs are already estimated to be responsible for over half of the continent’s top-flight club revenues.\n\nWhile UEFA sources point to opportunities afforded by the Europa League – where Slavia Prague, who held Arsenal in their quarter-final first leg on Thursday, have shone this term – and the creation of the Conference League, which starts next season, it was the Champions League that Čeferin was referring to when he said last year that “the vast majority of clubs know that football can develop only if everyone has access”. Political realities – with the threatened breakaway of the so-called ‘superclubs’ – may have dictated otherwise.\n\nThe Champions League’s distortion of domestic competitions is a problem for countries in eastern Europe as much as if not more than for bigger leagues like Serie A. Just set the tiny shared TV pot for Serbia’s SuperLiga against the £22.3m earned by Red Star for their last Champions League campaign. With a 12-point lead over Partizan, they are poised for a fourth successive title. (Over the border in Croatia Dinamo Zagreb have won 14 of the last 15.) “There’s a big gap between Red Star and other clubs,” Ramovš acknowledges. “We’re doing everything to reduce that gap by forcing other clubs to be better.”\n\nIn the meantime, next month brings the 30th anniversary of Red Star’s final triumph over Marseille. The celebrations in Belgrade are something that Belodedici recalls fondly: “With Steaua, it had been very official – we were the military club and there were generals and ministers and a piano playing. With Red Star it was more like a fiesta in Brazil. The stadium was completely full. Everyone was singing and there was music playing and people dancing on the pitch.” A last dance, as it turned out to be.\n\nMore on Football"
