        "text": "Unthinkable. Allowing more teams than the champions of each league? Impossible, it wouldn't be fair. The European Cup is a tournament meant for champions. Yes, the early rounds might be a bore for the big teams, facing little difficulty in qualifying, scoring heavily, and with few surprises. But at least they serve to warm up and reach the final rounds with the necessary competitive tension to win.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nDuring the last decade, due to the fact that I couldn't play as many videogames as much as I wanted, I 'created' a system using dices, probabilities and weighted factors to 'simulate' football matches, so the best teams are more likely to win. And I've been playing and running my own leagues in Google Sheets just for fun, creating narratives around those games, etc. I mostly used this system to fictional leagues where I 'play God', but I thought of running some 'scenarios' with real information from real life and I've been satisfied with the result, it feels real as there is a balance between realistic/expected outcomes and surprises. I would like to share this scenario here, let's see.\n\nThe POD here is that UEFA keeps the European Cup format until the present day, and no Champions League is created. This means the format stays the same: only the winners of the national leagues can compete (and the defending champions if they didn't win their league) and there are no group stages: only KO rounds until the final. I'll start with the 1991/92 season, where I only had to simulate a couple rounds (so I respected the qualifying stage results, etc), but in future editions I've drawn the matches of the qualifying stage myself.\n\nThe rules that I will apply will be:\n\nI'll use legit Elo ratings of the clubs that were supposed to participate in my European Cup for each year, draw the matches and simulate them with my system.\n\nI'm going to restrict my thread to only the European Cup. So no UEFA Cup, no Cup Winners Cup, etc. I know this limits a bit the narrative, because this means the UEFA Cup would have more prestige than nowadays and it'd affect the timeline. If you think that only the winners go to the European Cup, this would've mean that teams like Sevilla or West Ham would'nt have won European titles, because it's most likely to have Real Madrid or Manchester City or Liverpool winning some of them in recent years if they don't qualify for the Champions League. So I will avoid mentioning that.\n\nI'm going to respect the original winners of the different leagues and try to justify via narrative some things that could sound weird. Basically everything stays the same as in real life, the only thing is that only one team per country qualifies for the European Cup. Then, the dice will dictate the fate of the teams.\n\nI'll post two seasons now and I'll add more soon, as I have played until 2006 or so.\n\n1991-92: Benfica\n\nSven-GÃ¶ran Eriksson completes his magnum opus with Benfica at Wembley. In his second stint with the club, the Swedish coach leads the Lisbon team to win their third European Cup.\n\nSays Wikipedia: \"Eriksson had to rebuild the team after the departures of Ricardo Gomes and Valdo to PSG. After two seasons as a substitute, Paulo Madeira played a notable role alongside William. To replace Valdo, the Swedish coach opted for the young Rui Costa, 19 years old, who had just returned from a loan spell at Fafe. Benfica also signed the Soviet internationals Vasili Kulkov and Sergei Yuran.\" â€‹\n\nWith the experience of being continental runners-up in 1990 (and before, in 1988 under Toni Oliveira), Eriksson's Benfica reaches Wembley after eliminating Sampdoria in the semifinals. There, they face Johan Cruyff's Barcelona, who arrive optimistically after a comeback at Camp Nou against Dynamo Kiev. The final is a true spectacle, where Benfica levels a two-goal deficit to finish 3-3 at the end of regulation time and 4-4 after extra time. In the penalty shootout, Barcelona is haunted by the ghosts of Sevilla against Steaua. Neno becomes the hero by saving the first penalty of the shootout, taken by the Catalans, and Benfica wins 5-3 to break, finally, the curse of Bela Guttman.\n\n1992-93: Milan\n\nPSV Eindhoven, led by Romario, eliminates the reigning champion Benfica. The Dutch team is sent packing in the quarterfinals after suffering a scandalous defeat against Milan at San Siro, who look truly invincible. The Rossoneri are coached by Fabio Capello, who successfully completes the transition after the departure of Arrigo Sacchi and the arrival of high-profile signings such as Papin, Savicevic, or Lentini, along with Dutch trio of Van Basten, Rijkaard, and Gullit. In the semifinals, Milan easily fulfills expectations and defeats CSKA Moscow with a double 7-0, allowing them to go to the final in Munich as the favorite. The Russians, by the way, have eliminated Barcelona after a surprising victory at the Camp Nou in the previous round.\n\nIn Athens, the Italians face the best Rangers of all time. Walter Smith's players have eliminated Leeds, GÃ¶teborg, and Olympique de Marseille (via penalty shoot-out) on their way to the final. Englishman Trevor Steven, who played from Marseille the previous season, plays a vital role in the midfield alongside the goals of Ally McCoist. The Glasgow team has already conquered the league and the league cup, and they will win the Scottish Cup just a few days after the final against Milan.\n\nOnly Capello's team prevents Rangers from achieving a historic title sweep. The Scots take the lead in the 20th minute, but Milan comes from behind before halftime, and they score a third goal in the second half to culminate a great season, which they will cap off with a triumph in Serie A.\n\nThis looks amazing! Can't wait for 1994/95 when my club Hajduk Split appears. Their 2001/02 season might also be respectable, but now I am digging in way too deep haha. Definitely looking forward to what's next!\n\nLet's see I'll upload the next couple seasons hopefully tomorrow or the next day.\n\nAs long as as Panathinaikos beats Ajax in the semifinals in 1996. Also winning the cup optional ðŸ˜œ\n\nWe'll see. The thing is the path will likely be different in this timeline: since there is no group stage, it's possible that they meet in a different round, or they never face each other at all. KO rounds could get us into a different scenario.\n\nGood luck with that TL. And i'll admit, i think i might have been a bit too generous in my winners list for the UEFA and Cup Winners Cup in my own world. Then again, considering in my TL, that the foreign player limit is still there, expanded to 5 on the pitch at all times, and measures are taken to ensure parity and also different circumstences, then the chances of a smaller club winning trophies are higher, so it is justified.\n\nanyways, wonder if to keep an even playing field, that the bosman ruling would be different, cause if it follows as OTL, then the European Cup would be pretty boring to watch.\n\nI'll have a look at your TL, I'm curious. And yeah, to make things easier for me I kept the Bosman ruling in. Which kind of makes sense as well. But yes, the initial stages could be a bit 'boring' for the big clubs unless they're paired with another giant.\n\n1993-94: Spartak\n\nMilan is the clear favorite to conquer the European throne for the second consecutive year, but the Rossoneri fall just short of reaching the final. Capello's team, which secures Serie A with a superb defense, struggles more than expected against theoretically inferior opponents, such as Anderlecht (whom they defeat in extra time) and Spartak Moscow. The Russians cause a catastrophe at San Siro by thwarting Milan's comeback and qualifying for the grand final with a goal from Onopko. It is the first time that a Russian club reaches a European Cup final!\n\nIn Athens, Barcelona awaits them after a becoming sort of comeback specialists. Like last year, they again overcome Dynamo Kyiv at Camp Nou, a performance they repeat in the quarterfinals against Porto. These efforts contrast with the apparent ease shown by the Blaugranas against Monaco, whom they crush 6-1 in the first leg of the semifinals to have an easy second leg and secure a spot in the final. Cruyff's team had strengthened with Romario this season, and the attacking duo formed with Stoichkov propels Barcelona to also conquer the league.\n\nBut the Catalans struggle in the final, perhaps feeling the nerves from the lost final in 1992. The final is ugly and boring, and only a goal from Karpin in the 60th minute gives the victory to the team led by Oleg Romantsev, very solid in defense. The Moscow-based team celebrates four times in total during 1994: alongside victories in the national league and cup and the triumph in the European Cup, they also add the CIS Cup at the beginning of the year.\n\nOh, i don't have a TL. It's all on the Alternate Football Wikis Thread:\n\nAlternate Football Wikis\n\nA thread where anyone can make their own wiki of a specific football team or competition\n\nThis looks nice Maybe I can add there some specific scenarios that I had in mind (like Spain playing in 1960 vs the URSS or the World Cup in 1954)"
