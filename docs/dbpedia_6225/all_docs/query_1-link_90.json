        "text": "There were occasions when they used to play the Sportsnight theme tune for European nights, so may have gone with that... and Liverpool's European games in the 90s on the BBC had a unique theme tune also.\n\nIf I remember correctly, the final back then may not have been part of the Champions League contract - certainly the first couple of finals had different graphics to the uniform ones seen earlier in the competition.\n\n94 was the last final on the BBC - it had been rotated prior to that.\n\nBut I'm sure there's someone who will be able to give a more defintive answer....\n\n0\n\nIf I remember correctly, the final back then may not have been part of the Champions League contract - certainly the first couple of finals had different graphics to the uniform ones seen earlier in the competition.\n\nI'm pretty sure that's why the Beeb were able to show it, as you say the Champions League was exclusive to ITV at the time but the European Cup Final continued under the old deal for a bit where it rotated. I did originally think that ITV had sub-licenced the rights to the Beeb as they already had the Cup Winners Cup Final live, which Arsenal was in, so they offered that to the Beeb as it had no British teams in it and they wouldn't have to show football two weeks running. But seemingly not.\n\n0\n\nhttp://www.inthenews.co.uk/news/itv-retain-champions-league-rights-for-three-more-years-$1214373.htm\n\nITV have shown Champions League games since the tournament was introduced in 1992.\n\nI don't think the attached broadcast sponsorship would work on the BBC, every broadcaster worldwide shows it even outside Europe like in the US (with some local changes regarding alcohol sponsorship like in France, they simply replace Heineken with one of the other partners promos).\n\nThe BBC considered bidding a few years ago but I am sure UEFA told them to beat it because of their demands on losing the sponsorship that we are all familiar with.\n\n0\n\nBBC Scotland have shown several Champions League qualifiers featuring Scottish clubs but these games were not part of the main contract.\n\nIndeed, I have noticed that recenty even qualifiers are packaged the same as the main competition with the same attached sponsorship and stadium advertising, and the pre match 'music', you know the one!\n\nTeams never used to wear the Champions League 'starball' badge on their shirts for qualifiers but they do now so perhaps they are also considered part of the main competition, or at least the final qualifying round do anyway. Spurs final qualifying round matches certainly did. In the past Liverpool's didn't so sadly the BBC will probably not be able to shows these games anymore.\n\n0\n\nTo paraphrase Rafa, these are facts -\n\n- The European Cup went to a league format in 1991-92 - highlights were shown on the BBC, as was the final, live at Wembley\n\nOf course, that league format for the later rounds in 1991/2 would have got much more attention in the UK had Arsenal, the first English team in the tournament since Heysel, qualified for it, rather than going out against Benfica (managed by Sven-Goran Eriksson). Had they done so, I wonder which broadcaster would have covered their matches? In the first and second rounds, ITV had shown them live.\n\nITV did actually show live football two weeks running in the spring of 1994 - the AC Milan-Barca final the BBC showed was played two weeks after the Cup Winners' Cup final, but the week before the CWC final ITV showed the AC Milan-AS Monaco semi-final live. On 2nd March 1994, ITV showed the Torino-Arsenal CWC quarter-final live with a 5.30 kick-off, the Sheff Wed-Man Utd League Cup semi-final live at 8.00 (which had been postponed from the previous week) after a quick break for Coronation Street, and some time after midnight they had highlights of the original incarnation of the Champions' League - which that year had no representation from either England or Scotland, so again little interest here. However, HTV actually opted out of the live Arsenal match because they'd relaunched their regional news, moving it to 6.25, that week, and didn't want to just do five minutes on the third day. They were supposed to show the Arsenal match in full at 10.40, heaven knows what they actually did.\n\n0\n\nIndeed, I have noticed that recenty even qualifiers are packaged the same as the main competition with the same attached sponsorship and stadium advertising, and the pre match 'music', you know the one!\n\nTeams never used to wear the Champions League 'starball' badge on their shirts for qualifiers but they do now so perhaps they are also considered part of the main competition, or at least the final qualifying round do anyway.\n\nThe play-off round (as the last qualifying round is officially, though not commonly, known) of the CL has, since 2009/10, been part of the main competition for broadcasting purposes - i.e. ITV with one live game on Wednesday and all the others on Sky via whichever means.\n\nIn 2009/10, when Arsenal were drawn against Celtic, ITV could only show the second leg because the first leg was on a Tuesday, so had to show Panathinaikos v Atletico Madrid which got one of ITV1's lowest audience figures ever. In 2010/11, when Celtic had already been eliminated before the play-off round, they showed Spurs' second leg against Young Boys live on ITV1 (which was more of a match than it might have been because of course Spurs went 3-0 down in Switzerland and only made it 3-2 there quite late on), and were able to show their chosen first leg match, Braga v Sevilla, on ITV4 in exchange for showing Liverpool's Europa League play-off round first leg against Trabzonspor live on ITV1 the following night.\n\n0\n\nWith regards to the sponsorship issue, I remember a UEFA or Cup Winners Cup final from the mid 90s on the BBC where Des Lynam had to mention the sponsors (memory says Nissan) in a similar way to 'The FA Cup sponsored by Littlewoods' was. They also played an ident/whatever with the logo of Nissan on, though again, this is from memory.\n\nThe verbal reference to sponsors is par for the course, MOTD get's the name of a certain bank mentioned about 100 times an episode! The Nissan point you raise is interesting though, I can't recall that myself but I don't remember much about those games if i'm honest.\n\nBut when I have been on my travels and watched UCL matches the broadcast sponsorshp is exactly the same as here, except for markets that have alcohol advertsing restrictions but rather than run Heineken promos they use another like Sony or MasterCard. When Liverpool were sponsored by Carlsberg they removed the logo when playing in France but once they put 'probably' on their shirt but supposedly got told off and never did it again!. When I visited my brother in Germany I seem to remember they used the Maestro promo's more than MasterCard but the presentation package is identical wherever it is broadcast.\n\nI couldn't see how the BBC could run such promotion as that's how the UCL works these days, it dosen't have a single sponsor like the PL that can get a plug so UEFA wouldn't be happy. They did try and get a package a few years ago but couldn't reach an agreement.\n\n0"
