        "text": "Such is the way with Champions League finals of the last decade: you can come up with the perfect plan, create chances and control the great players on the opposition side and then, when the crunch comes, Real Madrid win it anyway.\n\nSo it was for Borussia Dortmund, who capped a fine performance at Wembley with the kind of defeat that would have felt like a surprise were it not for Carlo Ancelotti’s side’s record in this competition. There is no better team in the world at disguising a historic win as a mediocre performance and so it proved again for Real who, with an economy of effort that has become their trademark, needed just 20 minutes to win a Champions League final.\n\nThey did so with the finest individual player in this final, and perhaps now all of Europe. The great young Brazilian, Vinicius Junior, carried his side through the most difficult periods, and then when it came to the small moments that made the difference, he delivered them. The first was an exquisite nutmeg on the full-back Julian Ryerson that won the corner for Dani Carvajal’s goal – and then nine minutes later Vinicius scored the second that brought it all to an end.\n\nIt was that finish, an outcome so inevitable that Jude Bellingham celebrated it before the ball had been struck, that scored a final line through Dortmund’s hopes for this final. Vinicius was watched from the Wembley hospitality boxes by the great Brazilian talent of the 2000s, Ronaldinho, whose touch and craft was, like the younger man, so good that he too seemed impervious to the uncertainties of lesser mortals.\n\nThis was Vinicius’ second Champions League title and the 23-year-old departs for the Copa America as the best player in Europe and a prime contender for the Ballon d’Or this year. For Bellingham, another likely candidate, this was not the best night although at 20 he now has his first Champions League title and a great career has been launched. A new Real era has been launched and Bellingham and Vinicius will likely find themselves joined at Real by Kylian Mbappe in the weeks to come. Even so, the great Frenchman will do well to match the previous decade..\n\nThis was Real’s 15th European Cup, its sixth Champions League in the last 11 seasons and it elevated four of the players onto a new plane of achievement. Carvajal, Luka Modric, Nacho and Toni Kroos all now have six of these trophies to take them alongside the great Paco Gento who won the first six with Real between 1955 and 1966. Kroos was substituted before the end in this, his last club game, celebrating wildly in front of the Real fans even with ten minutes to play. This was his fifth Champions League at Real and the sixth of his career.\n\nAncelotti now has seven Champions League titles himself – five as a manager and two as a player. In terms of the titles won, he is so far out ahead of the rest that his record will surely be beyond even Pep Guardiola of the current generation of coaches. Ancelotti changed the game with his decisions at half-time to control the Dortmund counter-attacks that had made it so difficult for Real in the first half.\n\nThe same had been the case with the Joselu comeback in the semi-final second leg against Bayern Munich, or the long battle to keep out Manchester City in the Etihad in the previous round. To beat Real it feels like an opponent really has to demolish them, as City did in the Champions League semi-final second leg last season.\n\nOtherwise one simply risks them chiselling their way back into contention. In the game’s decisive moments – when legs tire and the shape of a team starts to disintegrate – so it becomes Real’s game. They operate best in those periods of uncertainty.\n\nDortmund had many chances themselves, in what Carvajal would later describe as a “really bad” first half for Real. In that period, the striker Niclas Fullkrug struck the post and forced another good save from Thibaut Courtois and there had been others too. Dortmund had preyed on an uncertainty in the Real defence, that seemed rather slow, to say the least, about the ball played in behind and the runners chasing it.\n\nThe great Champions League club of the last decade finished the first half without a single attempt on target on Dortmund’s goal. It was the case that Vinicius had burst past Ryerson on more than one occasion. But the great Brazilian was also on a yellow card for crashing into Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel as he tried to break up a careful passing build-up from a goal-kick.\n\nOn one occasion Dortmund managed a counter-attack of six yellow shirts against three in white chasing back. Karim Adeyemi had been played in behind by Mats Hummels’ pass on 21 minutes but he was so expertly shepherded away by Courtois and then Carvajal. Later Julian Brandt would put Adeyemi, playing on the left, in on goal again and Courtois would save brilliantly with his left hand. Fullkrug hit the post after Ian Maatsen robbed Eduardo Camavinga.\n\nWembley held its breath and – in front of the Dortmund end – the ball bounced back out. Jadon Sancho had a good first half on the right, and the Manchester United man skipped past Kroos on one occasion.\n\nMarcel Sabitzer, another ghost from United’s past, hit a good shot that was the second save of the first half from Courtois. Ancelotti would later say that he and his players had discussed the changes required at half-time. He made it sound very simple.\n\n“I didn’t need to get angry,” he said. “I needed to clarify a few things because it was pretty clear how Dortmund wanted to play. We lost our balance a bit and we needed to manage their transition. We lost many balls and we felt we needed to change the system. We brought [Federico] Valverde back to join Camavinga and Kroos and that worked better for us in the second half.”\n\nGradually Real turned the screw. Bellingham failed to connect with a Vinicius cross. Then the Brazilian took it to a level that Dortmund could not live with. First the skill to win the corner for Carvajal’s goal, then the second himself. Dortmund had fallen into the same trap as all the others."
