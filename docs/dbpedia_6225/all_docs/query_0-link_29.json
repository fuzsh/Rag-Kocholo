        "text": "Jo-Ryan SalazarSenior Analyst I\n\nPower Ranking the 1956-2010 UEFA Champions League Finals\n\n0 of 55\n\nOne of Europe's showcase football events, the UEFA Champions League final, never ceases to impress.\n\nWith the 2011 UEFA Champions League Final between FC Barcelona and Manchester United soon to take place in less than three weeks, Bleacher Report has taken the time to rank the finals that came before.\n\nA solid UEFA Champions League final lends itself to production, production, production. Great goals and great skill, a testament to excellent play, separate good finals from great finals, and great finals from legendary finals.\n\nLet's take a look at the 55 UEFA Champions League Finals that have already taken place. A side note: the European Cup is the precursor to the UEFA Champions League, so those finals have been added to this ranking.\n\n55. 1985-86: Steaua Bucuresti 0-0 FC Barcelona (Steaua Win on Penalties 2-0)\n\n1 of 55\n\nOne of the most uninteresting finals came in 1986, when Steaua Bucuresti defeated Barcelona in a penalty shootout 2-0 at the Estadio Ramon Sanches Pizjuan in Seville, a.k.a. La Bombonera de Nervión.\n\nGoalkeeper Helmuth Duckadam saved all four penalties by Barcelona, earning him the honor of \"The Hero of Seville.\"\n\nThe victory would go on to become the only moment of glory for any Romanian club in the history of the competition.\n\n54. 2002-03: AC Milan 0-0 Juventus (AC Milan Win on Penalties 3-2)\n\n2 of 55\n\nIn 2003, Serie A rivals AC Milan and Juventus battled at Old Trafford in Manchester for the prize.\n\nAfter battling to a scoreless draw through 120 minutes, the match went down to a penalty shootout that saw some questionable tactics from Juventus keeper Gianluigi Buffon and Dida of Milan.\n\nNonetheless, Andriy Shevcheko scored the deciding spot kick to give AC Milan their sixth European championship.\n\n53. 1990-91: Red Star Belgrade 0-0 Marseille (Red Star Win on Penalties 5-3)\n\n3 of 55\n\nThe 1991 European Cup Final was another one that limited production at the Stadio San Nicola in Bari, Italy. After 120 minutes of action, the match would be determined on penalties.\n\nMarseille's Manuel Amoros's miss would prove to be crucial, as Red Star Belgrade was perfect from the spot.\n\n52. 1987-88: PSV 0-0 SL Benfica (PSV Win on Penalties 6-5)\n\n4 of 55\n\nThe 1988 European Cup Final, contested at the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart, featured PSV Eindhoven and SL Benfica.\n\n120 minutes could not separate these two sides, and so the contest would have to go down to penalties.\n\nPSV were perfect from the spot, and it took a miss from Benfica's Antonio Veloso to give Eindhoven the treble of the Dutch Cup, the Eredivisie and European Cup titles.\n\n51. 1978-79: Nottingham Forest 1-0 Malmo FF\n\n5 of 55\n\nThe first of Forest's two European crowns came in 1979, when they took on Sweden's Malmo FF at Munich's Olympiastadion.\n\nThe hero of the match was Trevor Francis, who coincidentally played his first-ever European club game in the final after having to sit out three months due to UEFA regulations.\n\nIn the 45th minute, John Robertson whipped in a cross to Francis, which beat Malmo keeper Jan Moller.\n\nThe victory marked the conclusion of a Cinderella season for Brian Clough's Forest side, a then-unhealded English provincial outfit that now put itself on the map for good.\n\n50. 1979-80: Nottingham Forest 1-0 Hamburg\n\n6 of 55\n\nThe second of Nottingham Forest's two European titles came the following year, when they faced Hamburg at the Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid.\n\nThis time, the hero for Forest was John Robertson. His 21st minute shot escaped the reach of Hamburg's Rudolf Kargus.\n\nNottingham Forest went on to become the first team to win the European title more times than the Football League First Division (the precursor to the Premier League).\n\n49. 1977-78: Liverpool 1-0 Club Brugge\n\n7 of 55\n\nIn 1978, Liverpool took on Belgium's Club Brugge at the old Wembley Stadium in a rematch of the 1976 UEFA Cup final, won by the Reds 4-3 on aggregate.\n\nIn the 65th minute, Kenny Dalglish scored the winner off the delivery from Graeme Souness. A chance by Brugge's Jan Sørensen to equalize late was cleared by Ray Clemence and Phil Thompson of Liverpool to secure their second European crown.\n\n\"It takes two teams to make a game into a spectacle and Bruges only seemed to be concerned with keeping the score down,\" said Liverpool manager Bob Paisley following the match, according to the Guardian. \"Bruges didn't come at us much—apart from one mistake in our defence, they never looked like scoring. But they were well organised at the back and it was a case of breaking them down. We controlled the game from start to finish.\"\n\n\"Liverpool seemed only a shadow of the side we played in the UEFA Cup final two seasons ago,\" remarked Club Brugge manager Ernst Happel. \"I was disappointed with them, but they deserved their victory although we were handicapped by injuries to two players.\"\n\n48. 1991-92: FC Barcelona 1-0 Sampdoria\n\n8 of 55\n\nIn 1992, FC Barcelona faced UC Sampdoria at the old Wembley Stadium. This match marked the last time the competition would be named the European Cup.\n\n90 minutes could not separate these two teams, and so it the match went into extra time. In the 11th minute, a free kick from Ronald Koeman gave Barça their first European championship.\n\n47. 1981-82: Aston Villa 1-0 Bayern Munich\n\n9 of 55\n\nThe 1982 European Cup saw Aston Villa take on Bayern Munich at De Kuip in Rotterdam.\n\nIn his first season as manager, Tony Barton saw Villan win the title in the 67th minute thanks to a goal from Peter Withe in the 67th minute.\n\nThe victory was the last in a streak of English dominance in the competition dating back to the 1976-1977 season.\n\n46. 1975-76: Bayern Munich 1-0 Saint-Etienne\n\n10 of 55\n\nNearly 55,000 turned out at Hampden Park in Glasgow for the 1976 European Cup Final between Bayern Munich and Saint-Etienne.\n\nOne of the players on that Bayern team was a certain Franz Beckenbauer. Ja. Der Kaiser.\n\nIn the 57th minute, a free kick from Beckenbauer found another Franz in Franz Roth to give Bayern the three-peat.\n\nFranz and Franz fools France. Try saying that three times fast.\n\n45. 1992-93: Marseille 1-0 AC Milan\n\n11 of 55\n\nAt the Olympiastadium in Munich, Olympique de Marseille and AC Milan took part in the final of the now-renamed UEFA Champions League.\n\nThe 1993 Final would go on to be France's only moment of glory in the competition. Basile Boli's goal in the 43rd minute gave Marseille their only UEFA Champions League title.\n\nAdding to the misery was the fact that later on, Marseille would be relegated to Ligue 2 due a match-fixing scandal. Since then, OM has bounced back to be a relevant threat in Ligue 1 and the UCL.\n\n44. 1989-90: AC Milan 1-0 SL Benfica\n\n12 of 55\n\nAnother European Cup final which ended 1-0 took place at Vienna's Praterstadion between AC Milan and SL Benfica.\n\nIn the 68th minute, Alessandro Costacurta and Marco van Basten teamed up to deliver a through ball to Frank Rijkaard.\n\nMilan, to this day, are the only team to have successfully defended their European Cup/UEFA Champions League title. Since 1990, a different European club has hoisted the trophy.\n\n43. 1982-83: Hamburger SV 1-0 Juventus\n\n13 of 55\n\nIn 1983, Hamburg earned their only European Cup against Juventus before a crowd of 75,000 at the Olympic Stadium in Athens.\n\nAn eighth-minute goal from Felix Magath was enough to defeat a Juventus side that featured players like Dino Zoff, Marco Tardelli, Paolo Rossi and Michel Platini.\n\n42. 1964-65: Inter Milan 1-0 SL Benfica\n\n14 of 55\n\nTime for a little old school. In 1965, Internazionale and Benfica met at the San Siro in Milan in front of what was a partisan crowd of 85,000 strong.\n\nThe 42nd minute saw Jair de Costa score the only goal in the match. Inter went on to become the third club to successfully defend their European Cup.\n\n41. 1994-95: Ajax 1-0 AC Milan\n\n15 of 55\n\nAjax of Amsterdam is the Netherlands's most accomplished European club, with four titles to their credit. Their most recent title came in 1995, against AC Milan at Vienna's Ernst-Happel-Stadion.\n\n85 minutes of scoreless football was broken by former Milan stud Frank Rijkaard, who delivered a ball to Patrick Kluivert to give Ajax a 1-0 victory.\n\nOne of the players on that Ajax side was a young goalkeeper by the name of Edwin van der Sar, who will be competing for Manchester United in the 2011 final against FC Barcelona.\n\n40. 1972-73: Ajax 1-0 Juventus\n\n16 of 55\n\nThe 1973 European Cup final completed the three-peat for Ajax, who defeated Juventus 1-0 before a crowd of nearly 90,000 at the Red Star Stadium in Belgrade.\n\nA right winger by the name of Johnny Rep scored in the fourth minute of play, allowing Ajax to become the second club to keep the European Champion Clubs' Cup permanently, after Real Madrid.\n\n39. 1980-81: Liverpool 1-0 Real Madrid\n\n17 of 55\n\nIn 1981, the era of dominance under Bob Paisley continued for Liverpool as they took on Real Madrid at the Parc des Princes in Paris.\n\nThe 82nd minute saw Alan Kennedy break the deadlock in what was a tenacious affair from start to finish.\n\n38. 1997-98: Real Madrid 1-0 Juventus\n\n18 of 55\n\nReal Madrid are Europe's most accomplished football club, with nine continental titles to their credit among their stash.\n\nIn the 1998 UEFA Champions League title, Los Blancos took on Juventus and won their seventh title to the tune of 1-0 at the Amsterdam Arena.\n\nPredrag Mijatović was the hero for Real, who scored in the 67th minute of play.\n\n37. 1984-85: Juventus 1-0 Liverpool\n\n19 of 55\n\nThe Old Lady earned her first-ever European title in May 1985, when Juventus took on Liverpool at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels. Early on in the contest, 39 fans were killed and hundreds were injured when Liverpool's supporters charged against those fron Juventus crushing many against a wall.\n\nMichael Platini scored in the 56th minute on a penalty, but the game would permanently be scarred what is now known as the Heysel Stadium disaster.\n\n36. 1958-59: Real Madrid 2-0 Stade De Reims\n\n20 of 55\n\nBack in the day, Real Madrid was the talk in the town. No, they were the talk of all Europe, as they won five straight European Cups in the 1950's, when the competition first started.\n\nStade De Reims is currently a side lingering near the depth of Ligue 2, but in their day, they were one of the strongest clubs in France.\n\nThe 1959 European Cup Final between Real and Reims took place at Stuttgart's Neckarstadion before a crowd of 80,000 strong.\n\nEnrique Mateos scored in the second minute for Los Blancos, while celebrated Real star Alberto Di Stefano made it 2-0 in the 47th minute of play.\n\nThe victory marked Real Madrid's fourth straight European Cup.\n\n35. 1974-75: Bayern Munich 2-0 Leeds United\n\n21 of 55\n\nIn the 1975 final, Bayern Munich and Leeds United took to the pitch at the Parc des Princes. Goals from Franz Roth in the 71st minute and Gerd Muller in the 81st minute paced Bayern to a successful title defense.\n\nHowever, Leeds fans felt slighted by the decision-making by the officials, who seemed to be influenced unduly by Franz Beckenbaueur after a would-be goal by Leeds's Peter Lorimer in the 62rd minute was disallowed due to offsides. Riots would break out after the decision was reversed.\n\nHard tackling also dictated this contest. An example of this was the tackle of Leeds's Frank Gray on Bayern's Uli Hoeness, which would end his footballing career prematurely.\n\nNonetheless, the victory was part of a three-peat for Bayern in the 1970's.\n\n34. 1956-57: Real Madrid 2-0 AC Fiorentina\n\n22 of 55\n\nReal Madrid defended their European title in 1957 when they took on Fiorentina at the Santiago Bernabeu before a partisan crowd of 120,000 strong.\n\nThe match was a tenacious affair and the deadlock would only be broken in the 69th minute when Alberto De Stefano scored a penalty kick. Francisco Gento added an insurance goal in the 75th minute of play to assure Real of their second straight European title.\n\n33. 1995-96: Juventus 1-1 Ajax (Juventus Win on Penalties 4-2)\n\n23 of 55\n\nJuventus and Ajax went the distance in the 1996 UEFA Champions League Final, held at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.\n\nFabrizio Ravanelli opened the scoring in the 12th minute, but Ajax's Jari Litmanen would equalize in the 41st minute of play.\n\nThe second half and extra time would see no further production, and so the match would go to penalties. Edgar Davids and Sonny Silooy could not convert their spot kicks, while Juventus's Vladimir Jugovic sealed revenge for the 1973 final, which Ajax won.\n\nThe victory would also mark Juventus's last UEFA Champions League triumph.\n\n32. 1983-84: Liverpool 1-1 AS Roma (Liverpool Win on Penalties 4-2)\n\n24 of 55\n\nThe Stadio Olimpico in Rome has been known for seeing some electrifying UEFA Champions League Finals go the distance. Another of those marathon finales came in 1984, when Liverpool took on home side AS Roma.\n\nPhil Neal scored in the 13th minute for Liverpool, while Roberto Pruzzo equalized in the 42nd minute.\n\nLike the 1996 final, no further goals would be scored in the second half and extra time, and so the match would go to penalties.\n\nWhile future New England Revolution manager Steve Nicol missed his spot kick for the Reds, Neal, Graeme Souness, Ian Rush and Alan Kennedy would convert theirs, the latter sealing Liverpool's fourth European title.\n\nReds goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar would be immortalized for his spaghetti legs antics in the shootout.\n\n31. 2000-01: Bayern Munich 1-1 Valencia (Bayern Munich Win on Penalties 5-4)\n\n25 of 55\n\nBayern's last UEFA Champions League title came in 2001 at the San Siro in Milan, when they faced Valencia. The match would end up as a contest determined by spot kicks, both in regulation, and the penalty shootout following extra time.\n\nGaizka Mendieta opened the scoring in the second minute converting his penalty, while Stefan Effenberg equalized in the 50th minute.\n\nNeither side was able to break through afterwards, and so the match went to a shootout.\n\nThomas Linke's spot kick would be the eventual decider, as Mauricio Pellegrino's conversion was saved by Bayern goalkeeper oliver Kahn.\n\n30. 1970-71: Ajax 2-0 Panathinaikos\n\n26 of 55\n\nIn 1971, Ajax won their first-ever European Cup when they took on Greek powerhouse Panathanaikos at the old Wembley Stadium.\n\nThere would be no comeback for Panthanaikos, who defeated Red Star Belgrade in that fashion in the second leg of their semifinal. Goals from Dick van Dijk in the fifth minute and Arie Haan in the 87th minute sealed the Dutch side's first title in this competition.\n\n29. 1971-72: Ajax 2-0 Inter Milan\n\n27 of 55\n\nAjax continued their dominance of the early 1970's when they faced Inter Milan at De Kuip in Rotterdam for the 1972 European Cup.\n\nThe hero of that match? Mr. Total Football, Johan Cruyff.\n\nCruyff scored goals in the 47th and 78th minutes to pace Ajax to their second straight European championship 2-0, which was won with domination of possession, forcing Inter to defend for their lives..\n\n28. 2007-08: Manchester United 1-1 Chelsea (Man United Win on Penalties 6-5)\n\n28 of 55\n\nManchester United's most recent UEFA Champions League crown came in 2008, when they faced Premier League rivals Chelsea at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring in the 26th minute off a cross from Wes Brown but in the 45th minute, Frank Lampard equalized off a keeper mistake from Edwin Van Der Sar.\n\nNo further goals came to pass in the second half and extra time, and so the match went to penalties.\n\nRyan Giggs's conversion proved to be enough, as Nicolas Anelka's spot kick was saved by Van Der Sar, a redemption of the goal given up late in the first half.\n\nThe victory marked the Red Devils' third European crown, and the defeat Chelsea sparked riots between Chelsea fans and police soon afterwards.\n\n27. 2009-10: Inter Milan 2-0 Bayern Munich\n\n29 of 55\n\nLast year's UEFA Champions League Final was one to remember for Jose Mourinho's Internazionale, who defeated Bayern Munich 2-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid.\n\nDiego Milito was the hero for Inter Milan, with goals in the 35th and 70th minutes. A series of successive counter-attacks preserved the shutout victory.\n\n26. 2008-09: Barcelona 2-0 Manchester United\n\n30 of 55\n\nPepe Guardiola's FC Barcelona would pip Fergie's Red Devils at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome to the tune of 2-0.\n\nXavi Hernandez was a key component in Barça's victory, which was paced by goals from Samuel Eto'o in the 10th minute and Lionel Messi in the 70th minute. Eto'o's goal came from a delivery from a sequence of passes between Xavi and Andres Iniesta, while the Messi goal came off a Xavi cross.\n\nBoth Barcelona and Manchester United will be dueling in a rematch of this final on May 28, 2011 at the new Wembley Stadium.\n\n25. 2003-04: FC Porto 3-0 Monaco\n\n31 of 55\n\nIn the 2004 UEFA Champions League final, held at the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, FC Porto rolled to a comprehensive 3-0 victory over AS Monaco.\n\nCarlos Alberto opened the scoring in the 39th minute, man of the match Deco made it 2-0 in the 71st minute of play and Dmitri Alenichev in the 75th minute put this final out of reach for the French side.\n\nThis contest put manager Jose Mourinho on the map, as he would take his trade to Chelsea soon afterwards.\n\n24. 1965-66: Real Madrid 2-1 Partizan\n\n32 of 55\n\nAfter six years in the wilderness, along with a couple of close calls in 1962 and 1964, Real Madrid returned to dominance in 1966 when they faced Partizan Belgrade and won their sixth title to the tune of 2-1 at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels.\n\nVelibor Vasovic made it 1-0 Partizan in the 55th minute of pay, but just when Los Blancos were going to be consigned to runners-up a third time, they made their comeback.\n\nAmancio Amaro equalized in the 70th minute and Fernando Serena scored the go-ahead goal in the 76th minute of play.\n\n23. 2001-02: Real Madrid 2-1 Bayer Leverkusen\n\n33 of 55\n\nThe most recent moment of glory for Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League came in 2002, when they faced Bayer Leverkusen at Hampden Park in Glasgow.\n\nZinedine Zidane was the hero for Los Blancos, with the game-winner in the 45th minute of play to give Real Madrid their ninth Champions League crown.\n\nRaul opened up the scoring for Real in the eighth minute of play, while Lucio equalized in the 13th minute for Bayer Leverkusen.\n\n22. 1962-63: AC Milan 2-1 SL Benfica\n\n34 of 55\n\nIn 1963, AC Milan won their first-ever European Cup in the first-ever final contested at the old Wembley Stadium.\n\nBenfica featured a famous Portuguese star in Eusebio. He opened up the scoring in the 18th minute of play. But it would be a brace from Milan's Jose Altafini that would determine the outcome.\n\nAltafini scored goals in the 58th and 66th minutes secured the win for the Rossoneri.\n\n21. 1999-2000: Real Madrid 3-0 Valencia\n\n35 of 55\n\nIt was a battle of La Liga clubs in the land of Ligue 1.\n\nAt the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, Real Madrid rolled to a comprehensive 3-0 pasting of Valencia before a crowd of over 78,759.\n\nSteve McManaman became the first Englishman to win a UEFA Champions League with a foreign club. He made it 2-0 in the 67th minute of play.\n\nFernando Morientes opened the scoring in the 39th minute of play, and Raul wrapped it up in the 75th minute. The title also marked Vicente Del Bosque's first Champions League title as a manager.\n\n20. 1969-70: Feyenoord 2-1 Celtic\n\n36 of 55\n\nBefore Ajax ran the tables to become Holland's most dominant team in European Cup/UEFA Champions League...there was their rivals.\n\nFeyenoord of Rotterdam had their only taste of European Cup victory in 1970, when they faced Celtic at the San Siro.\n\nCeltic's Tommy Gemmell opened the scoring in the 30th minute, but Rinus Israel equalized two minutes later. The match would go on to extra time, and it was the heroics of Ove Kindvall in the 117th minute that gave Feyenoord the Cup.\n\n19. 1966-67: Celtic 2-1 Inter Milan\n\n37 of 55\n\nIn 1967, Celtic battled Internazionale for the 1967 European Cup at the Estadio Nacional in Lisbon. The Bhoys would forever be known as the \"Lisbon Lions\" for becoming the first British club to win the European title.\n\nInterestingly at the break, Celtic were 45 minutes away from that possibility being dismissed.\n\nSandro Mazzola scored a penalty in the seventh minute to give Inter Milan a 1-0 halftime lead.\n\nTommy Gemmell would equalize in the 62nd minute of play and Stevie Chalmer would score the game-winner in the 85th minute to give Celtic their only European Cup in their long history.\n\n18. 1986-87: FC Porto 2-1 Bayern Munich\n\n38 of 55\n\nFC Porto put themselves on the map in 1987 when they took on Bayern Munich and Lothar Matthaus at the Praterstadion in Vienna. Both teams were coming in under-prepared, with Porto's Fernando Gomes injured and Bayern's Klaus Augenthaler suspended, and both Roland Wohlfarth and Hans Dorfner both injured.\n\nStill, in spite of Bayern being more understrength, Ludwig Kogl made it 1-0 in the 25th minute to give them a 1-0 lead at the half.\n\nPorto's Rabah Madjer equalized in the 77th minute and four minutes later, Juary scored the game-winner in the 81st minute of play.\n\n17. 2006-07: AC Milan 2-1 Liverpool\n\n39 of 55\n\nMilan's most recent UEFA Championship came in 2007, when they took on Liverpool in the Olympic Stadium in Athens. They earned their payback for their demise two years ago with a 2-1 victory.\n\nThe hero of the match was Filippo Inzaghi, with a brace in the 45th and 82nd minutes. Dirk Kuyt pulled one back in the 89th minute of play, but it would not be enough, as Milan rolled to their seventh UEFA Champions League crown.\n\nInterestingly, UEFA President Michel Platini, who played for Juventus, presented the trophy to Milan captain Paolo Maldini, who made his professional debut with the Rossoneri when Platini was wrapping up his playing career.\n\n16. 2005-06: FC Barcelona 2-1 Arsenal\n\n40 of 55\n\nBarcelona won their second UEFA Champions League crown in 2006, when they took on Final debutantes Arsenal at the Stade de France.\n\nArsenal's Sol Campbell put the Blaugrana in a bind with a goal in the 37th minute of play. But Barça would rebound late in the second half. In the 76th minute, a delivery from Henrik Larson found Samuel Eto'o to make it 1-1.\n\nJuliano Belletti scored the game-winner five minutes later off a cross from Larsson.\n\nArsenal were forced to play a man down after Gunners goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was sent off in the 18th minute of play\n\n15. 1998-99: Manchester United 2-1 Bayern Munich\n\n41 of 55\n\nThe Camp Nou in Barcelona was home to an electrifying UEFA Champions League final in 1999, when Manchester United took on Bayern Munich. United were looking to secure the Treble of winning the Premier League, the FA Cup, and the Champions League.\n\nAll hope for that seemed to be fading away in the closing seconds of stoppage time, with Mario Basler's sixth-minute goal minutes away from standing. But one of the most dramatic comebacks in UEFA Champions League history would take place.\n\nTeddy Sheringham scored off the initial miss from Ryan Giggs on the corner in the 91st minute to make it 1-1. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer completed the comeback in the 93rd minute of play off a chance from Sheringham.\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" said then-UEFA President Lennart Johansson. \"The winners are crying and the losers are dancing.\"\n\nAnd the Red Devil faithful would be dancing in the streets of Manchester for quite a while, as Alex Ferguson became knighted for his efforts.\n\n14. 1976-77: Liverpool 3-1 Borussia Monchengladbach\n\n42 of 55\n\nIn 1977, Liverpool took on Borussia Monchengladbach at the Stadio Olimpico and went on to win their first-ever European club title to the tune of 3-1.\n\nTerry McDermott opened the scoring for the Reds in the 28th minute.
