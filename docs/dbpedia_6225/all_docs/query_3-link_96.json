        "text": "Manchester United are one of the most iconic names in the game owing to their enviable success in domestic and continental football.\n\nHowever, in recent times, United have fallen from the standards set throughout much of their existence, with the Premier League and Champions League having eluded them since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.\n\nAnd their Champions League draught will be extended for one more season at least, with Erik ten Hag’s men having finished bottom of their group in the 2023/24 season.\n\nLet’s take a look at when Manchester United last won the Champions League and their recent history in the famous competition.\n\nWhen did Manchester United last win the Champions League?\n\nManchester United last won the Champions League in the 2007/08 season.\n\nThe Red Devils beat Chelsea 6-5 on penalties following a 1-1 draw after extra-time at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo had put United ahead in the 26th minute, before Frank Lampard levelled things up on the stroke of half-time.\n\nJohn Terry had the opportunity to win it for Chelsea but a slip whilst taking his penalty saw the shootout head to sudden death.\n\nNicolas Anelka’s effort was saved by Edwin van der Sar to ensure the iconic trophy headed to Manchester.\n\nHow many times have Manchester United won the Champions League?\n\nManchester United have won the Champions League three times in their history.\n\nTheir first triumph came in 1967/68 under Matt Busby, beating Benfica 4-1 in the final in Wembley.\n\nTitle number two arrived in the most dramatic of circumstances in 1998/99.\n\nHaving fallen behind early on against Bayern Munich at Camp Nou, Teddy Sheringham equalised for Sir Alex Ferguson’s side in the first minute of second half injury time – before Solskjaer popped up with the winner two minutes later.\n\nThe win in Moscow handed United their third Champions League title, making them the second most successful English team in the history of the competition behind Liverpool (6).\n\nUnited have also won the Cup Winners’ Cup (1990/91) and the UEFA Super Cup (1991).\n\nWhat is Manchester United’s recent record in the Champions League?\n\nSince reaching the final of the Champions League in 2010/11, Manchester United have only won two knockout round ties.\n\nThe Red Devils beat Olympiacos in the Round of 16 in 2013/14 under David Moyes before losing to Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals.\n\nUnited then memorably recovered from 2-0 down from the Round of 16 first leg to beat PSG 3-1 in the second leg during the 2018/19 season, with a late penalty from Marcus Rashford sealing the victory in Paris.\n\nUnited went on to lose both legs of the quarter-final against Barcelona en-route to a 4-0 aggregate defeat.\n\nSince the appearance in the final 12 years ago, United have failed to even qualify for the Champions League on three occasions (2014/15, 2016/17, 2019/20).\n\nTheir appearances in the Europa League during that time period has seen them win the competition in 2016/17 and finish as runners-up in 2020/21.\n\nMORE : When did Manchester United last win the Premier League?\n\nMORE : Donny van de Beek speaks out on ‘new chapter’ after Manchester United exit\n\nFollow Metro across our social channels, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram\n\nShare your views in the comments below"
