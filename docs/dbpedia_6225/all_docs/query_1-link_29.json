        "text": "With 32 teams competing, the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup is set to be the biggest tournament to date.\n\nThe ninth edition of the competition is being joint-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, with the opening match taking place on July 20, 2023. The 32 participants will eventually be whittled down to just two for the showpiece final in Sydney on August 20.\n\nAt its conclusion, only one name will be added to the illustrious list of previous winners, going back to the first final some 32 years ago.\n\nWomen's World Cup\n\nLionesses 'come to an agreement' with FA over player bonuses - Bright\n\n21/09/2023 at 16:07\n\n1991 – USA take first title\n\nThe first Women’s World Cup final took place at a packed Tianhe Stadium in Guangzhou, China.\n\nA brace from Michelle Akers-Stahl helped the United States to a historic 2-1 win over Norway to become the first women’s world champions.\n\n1995 – Norway go one better\n\nNorway would get their revenge against the USA four years later, courtesy of a 1-0 semi-final win, earning them a place in the final against Germany.\n\nThe Rasunda Stadium in Solna, Sweden was the venue as goals from Hege Riise and Marianne Pettersen secured victory for the Norwegians.\n\n1999 – USA Spot-on against unfortunate China\n\nAmerica was the venue for the 1999 final as an incredible 90,000 people inside a sold-out Rose Bowl in Pasadena saw the host nation lift the World Cup for a second time.\n\nChina pushed them all the way however, with the showpiece match ended 0-0 and requiring penalties.\n\nBrianna Scurry in the US goal denied China’s third taker Liu Yang – the only player to fail to score – before Brandi Chastain dispatched the decisive spot-kick for the win. Chastain's celebration would later be immortalised with a statue at the venue.\n\nBrandi Chastain\n\nImage credit: Eurosport\n\n2003 – Germany’s golden girls\n\nChina was set to host the first tournament of the new millennium, but a severe outbreak of SARS saw the host nation switch to America.\n\nThe hosts couldn’t repeat their heroics of four years earlier however and were beaten by a rampant Germany side who met Sweden in the final.\n\nDespite having won all their matches leading to the final, the Germans had to come from behind after the Swedes took the lead. ultimately requiring extra time where Nia Kunzer netted the golden goal to secure the trophy.\n\n2007 – Back-to-back German glory\n\nThe tournament finally arrived in China four years later and the Hongkou Football Stadium in Shanghai saw South America’s first-ever representatives in the final.\n\nAn impressive Brazil stormed through the competition but fell at the final hurdle when they came up against the defending champions.\n\nGoals from Birgit Prinz and Simone Laudehr saw Germany become the first team to retain the World Cup.\n\n2011 – Japan shock the world\n\nThe sixth Women’s World Cup was held in Germany and following China’s efforts in 2009, saw Asia’s second-ever finalists in Japan who, against all odds, found themselves in the final in Frankfurt against the USA.\n\nAlex Morgan’s goal looked to have set the US on their way to a third title until Aya Miyama forced extra time. Abby Wambach’s header put the favourites in front again, but Homare Sawa’s equaliser sent the game to penalties.\n\nUnbelievably, USA failed to score their first three penalties, ultimately allowing Saki Kumagai to score the decisive spot-kick for a shock Japan win.\n\nThe team of Japan celebrates with the cup after winning the FIFA Women's World Cup Final match between Japan and USA at the FIFA World Cup stadium Frankfurt on July 17, 2011 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
