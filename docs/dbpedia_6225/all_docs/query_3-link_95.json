        "text": "The date was May 18, 1991 and little did Gary Mabbutt know but he would become the last Tottenham Hotspur captain to lift the FA Cup for at least 26 years.\n\nThe key moments of that Wembley final against Nottingham Forest are etched into Spurs' fans memories. Gazza's terrible tackle on Gary Charles that not only gave Stuart Peace the chance to rattle home a free-kick but also tore his own cruciate ligaments in the process.\n\nGary Lineker had a goal ruled out for offside and then saw his later penalty saved by Mark Crossley. It wasn't until the second half when Gazza's replacement Nayim found Paul Stewart to drill home the equaliser.\n\nThe match went into extra-time. Paul Walsh sent a header against the crossbar and Pearce put the ball out for a corner. Nayim sent the subsequent flag kick into the box and Des Walker beat Mabbutt to the ball to turn it into his own net.\n\nThe 13 Spurs players who featured that day were Tottenham's last FA Cup heroes, but where are they now?\n\nErik Thorstvedt\n\nThe big goalkeeper, dubbed 'Erik the Viking', is fondly remembered at Spurs and played more than 200 times for the club before back problems forced him to retire. He worked as a goalkeeping coach for the national team before taking up punditry and was eventually given his own football show in Norway called Matchball Mandag.\n\nJustin Edinburgh\n\nPerhaps his better known cup final appearance was the 1999 League Cup final when he was sent off for a minimal slap on Robbie Savage (he was only doing what many other had and have since wanted to do). Not the most gifted of players but has gone on to become a well-regarded manager, working his way up from non-league before impressing with Gillingham until he was sacked this year and joined Northampton Town.\n\nPat Van Den Hauwe\n\nBorn in Belgium, but raised in London, the defender spent four years at Spurs and notably never managed to score a goal for the club. Was known as 'Psycho Pat' with all the trouble he'd get into on and off the pitch and his autobiography is not for the faint of heart. Moved to South Africa for 20 years, and admits he battled with depression, but is now working with Everton and their Walking Football team.\n\nSteve Sedgley\n\nWon the FA Cup twice, once with Coventry City (yes that final) and then with Spurs. After giving up football he moved to Barbados and set up a watersports shop, but returned to Britain after some problems in a car park (look it up). He managed Kingstonian before doing some coaching for Luton and is now a managing director of a construction company.\n\nDavid Howells\n\nOne of Spurs' own, spending almost 20 years at the club before winding his career down elsewhere. Has been involved with sport ever since, whether through soccers schools or sports agency work and is now the Director of Football at Charterhouse School in Surrey.\n\nGary Mabbutt\n\nIt's easy to forget that Spurs' Captain Fantastic started at Bristol Rovers so synonymous is he with Tottenham. He played almost 500 games for the Lilywhites and after retiring has done plenty of ambassadorial roles, whether it be for diabetes, the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and still works in a such a role for Spurs and the FA.\n\nPaul Stewart\n\nPlayed for plenty of clubs but was a popular team member at Spurs after being signed by Terry Venables. One of very few players to appear in a north London derby, a Manchester derby, a Merseyside derby and a North east derby. Remained out of the public eye on the whole until his recent admission that he had been a victim of sexual abuse as a young footballer in the game, which led to him struggling with drink and drugs.\n\nPaul Gascoigne\n\nThere is little in Gazza's life that hasn't been documented. He was one of Spurs' most gifted players but was arguably never as good on a football pitch after that injury against Forest and has rather too publicly struggled with his demons in recent years.\n\nVinny Samways\n\nAnother to come through the Spurs youth system. He would later forge a career in Spain, both as a player and a coach. Now settled in Spain, he reportedly runs several businesses including a bar and bookmakers.\n\nGary Lineker\n\nWorld class footballer turned crisps seller and TV presenter in his underpants. Everybody knows what Gary is up to nowadays.\n\nPaul Allen\n\nClive Allen's cousin - spent eight years at Tottenham after moving from West Ham. Once his career ended after a string of other clubs, he went on to work for the PFA.\n\nSubs\n\nPaul Walsh\n\nOnce of the long flowing locks, Walsh spent four years at Spurs before playing for Portsmouth and Manchester City until a cruciate ligament injury ended his career. Can now be seen as a pundit on Sky Sports without the bulk of that lovely hair.\n\nNayim\n\nWhat did he do after leaving Spurs? Scored THAT goal of course, for Real Zaragoza in the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final to crush Arsenal's dreams. Also became a coach in Spain, but did we tell you he scored THAT goal?"
