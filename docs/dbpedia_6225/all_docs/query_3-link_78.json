        "text": "Manchester United continue to progress under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer since he took charge at the end of 2018 - but the United boss is still lacking silverware to bolster his winning credentials.\n\nUnited have enjoyed their best season since 2018 by finishing second in the Premier League - albeit a distant second behind rivals Manchester City.\n\nBut the former Red Devils' striker is yet to win a major trophy during his time in the Old Trafford hotseat, and he can put that right when his side take on Villarreal in the Europa League final on Wednesday evening.\n\nIt's not quite the European nights United, or even Solskjaer, aspire to, with the Norwegian helping the club win the Champions League in 1999 before the Red Devils triumphed again in the competition nine years later for the second time under Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nBut even Fergie had to start somewhere, and his first European trophy with the club came back in 1991 with the now defunct European Cup Winners' Cup that provided a springboard for United to dominate the 1990s.\n\nEurope's new third trophy in the European Conference League has been mildly received at best by many fans in England. But the Cup Winners' Cup was considered the second most prestigious piece of European silverware behind the European Cup, with the UEFA Cup (Europa League) a strong third before UEFA put all their eggs in the Champions League basket through the 1990s and beyond.\n\nFerguson's team qualified for the competition by winning the 1990 FA Cup - his first trophy at Old Trafford - and in truth their run to the final could hardly have been easier. Dare I say it, Tottenham might actually face more difficult sides in the Conference League next term.\n\nUnbeaten across their four ties of two-legged matches, they saw off Hungarian outfit Pecs, Wrexham (who qualified after winning the Welsh Cup), Montpellier and Legia Warsaw to set up a final with Barcelona.\n\nBarca's run was a little less straight forward after defeating Trabzonspor and Icelandic side Fram. In the quarter-finals they defeated Dynamo Kiev before they survived a second leg defeat by Juventus to book their place at Feyenoord's stadium in Rotterdam.\n\nBarca were favourites on the night, even though they were without No 1 goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta and maverick Bulgaria striker Hristo Stoichkov.\n\nUnder Johan Cruyff, Barca had won the Spanish league title (which they would go on to do for the following three years) and featured current manager Ronald Koeman, Danish star Michael Laudrup and current even Manchester City director of football Txiki Begiristain.\n\nTo further prove their credentials, they would go on to win the European Cup a year later at Wembley.\n\nUnited meanwhile didn't grace as many star names for the era but were a team who knew how to battle. The likes of Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister, captain Bryan Robson and Paul Ince held the middle of the park well and soaked up Barcelona's first half pressure.\n\nWithin United's ranks was Mark Hughes, who had only left Barcelona three years earlier following a miserable year at the Nou Camp and a loan spell at Bayern Munich, having initially joined from Old Trafford.\n\nHughes had a point to prove and after a Barcelona first-half onslaught, United led by the Welshman came out firing in the second period.\n\nThey took the lead in the 67th minute when Robson's high ball into the box was headed towards goal by Bruce, where Hughes helped it over the line.\n\nWith technology to decide goals still just a figure of the imagination in 1991, Hughes was credited with the one-yard tap-in.\n\nThere was no doubting his role in scoring the second goal seven minutes later, impressively taking the ball around keeper Carles Busquets (indeed, the father of modern day Barca star Sergio) before, from an ever decreasing angle, using the outside of his foot to steer the ball into an empty net.\n\nThe cup looked destined for United but Barca led a credible fightback, with Koeman's 35-yard free-kick creeping in at Les Sealey's near post. The game became more end-to-end from that point but it was Barca who nearly salvaged an equaliser, with Clayton Blackmore crucially making a goal line clearance.\n\nUnited held on to claim their first continental silverware since winning the 1968 European Cup under legendary manager Matt Busby.\n\nThe FA Cup previously arguably saved Ferguson's job, but the European breakthrough put United among the front runners again.\n\nThe next season they narrowly missed out on the league title to Leeds United, before then going on to win the newly formed Premier League, leading to two decades of near Fergie dominance.\n\nSolskjaer will be hoping he is treading in similar footsteps when he also faces Spanish opposition in Gdansk on Wednesday."
