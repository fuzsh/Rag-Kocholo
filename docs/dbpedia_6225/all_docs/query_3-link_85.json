        "text": "“I’m not going to say the player’s name,” says Roger Milford, a referee who will always be synonymous with FA Cup final day. “But there was a player from Tottenham Hotspur who I knew very well. He came up to me afterwards and said, ‘Roger, he was gone, absolutely gone, even before the game’.”\n\nMilford is reminiscing about the day at Wembley for which his own career will forever be remembered. It was the day that changed Paul Gascoigne’s life and, as it turned out, caused irreparable damage to the most talented English footballer of his generation.\n\nAnd Milford has never forgotten that conversation he had, in private, with one of Gascoigne’s team-mates.\n\n“This person said to me, ‘He was on a high’. Not a high, as in drugs, but a high, nonetheless. This was going to be Gascoigne’s last game for Tottenham. He was going to Italy to join Lazio and it had been in the newspapers that he was going to get kicked to death in the Italian league.\n\n“I think he went into that FA Cup final to prove he could give it as well as take it. There was a band playing on the pitch, the Grenadier Guards, before kick-off. And Gazza was out there with a football trying to knock the Busbies (caps) off the top of their heads.”\n\nIt has been 30 years since a pumped-up Gascoigne announced his presence in what was, at the time, football’s showpiece occasion with a studs-up, chest-high assault on Nottingham Forest’s Garry Parker that could conceivably still qualify as the worst challenge ever seen in an FA Cup final.\n\nBut it was what Gascoigne did a few minutes later, in his wild lunge at Gary Charles, that did the most damage. Gascoigne was so intent on scything down the Forest full-back, he mangled his own knee in the process. His career never fully recovered and his life, as everybody knows, spiralled. Everything always goes back to that flailing, self-destructive, X-rated tackle on Charles.\n\n“People always want to talk about the Gascoigne incident,” Milford says. “What I say to them is, ‘Did the game go to extra time or was it 90 minutes? Was there a penalty? Who took it? Who scored the winning goal?’ But no, the first question people ask me is always the same, ‘Should you have sent Gascoigne off?’”\n\nIf that sounds slightly defensive, it is because Milford has had three decades of people — fellow referees, football fans, strangers — wanting to hear his side. Why did he not send off Gascoigne for the first challenge, never mind the second one? Might Gascoigne have calmed down if he had been booked for the Parker offence? And what about the impact those decisions had on Tottenham’s opponents that day?\n\nFor Gascoigne, it was a personal tragedy. But there were also consequences of a sporting context for Brian Clough given that a red card would, in theory, have helped his Forest side hold onto a 1-0 lead (Stuart Pearce had scored the free kick awarded for the Charles offence, with Gascoigne playing on long enough to be in the beaten wall).\n\nInstead, Tottenham brought on Nayim to replace the stricken Gascoigne immediately after Pearce’s goal and Terry Venables’ team turned the game in their favour. Despite Gary Lineker having a penalty saved by Mark Crossley, Paul Stewart drew Spurs level before Des Walker’s own goal, in extra time, meant the FA Cup remained the one major domestic trophy to elude Clough.\n\nThe game’s 30th anniversary is this coming week — and that makes it an opportune moment, perhaps, for Milford to explain what it was like to be in that position.\n\nWas it a mistake on his part not to send Gascoigne off? Did compassion take over? And how, all these years later, does he reflect on Clough criticising him for “copping out of his responsibility”?\n\nIt turns out that Milford, like many referees of that era, had previous with Gascoigne.\n\n“Me and Gazza, honestly, we used to have a laugh,” he says. “He was a nice kid. Everybody got on with Gazza.\n\n“On one occasion I said to him, ‘Look, Gazza, that’s your last chance. Next time you’re going in the book — that’s the second time you’ve fouled someone’. He was always up for it. ‘Wrong’, he said, ‘that’s the fourth time!’\n\n“We had this sort of rapport. It was the same with Vinnie Jones, Mark Hughes, Ian Wright. We used to have a right fracas on the pitch but, in those days, it was done that way.\n\n“Players, years ago, had a certain amount of respect for referees. If I heard a player saying something to me which I didn’t like, I didn’t immediately reach for a card. I’d bring him over and say, ‘Excuse me, that was my deaf side. Would you like to repeat what you have just said?’\n\n“Today, though, it’s different. I used to go to places like Torquay United and have a lovely time having some banter with the crowd. But when you go to Premier League games now, you can’t have the banter.”\n\nMilford started refereeing in 1978 and worked his way through the divisions before the call arrived from the Football Association, three-quarters of the way through the 1990-91 season, to check that he was available on the third Saturday in May.\n\nBeing awarded the FA Cup final was the biggest honour a referee could have. And the Bristolian never imagined a Spurs-Forest final, bringing together two of the more attractive sides in the country, would be remembered for one of the players being out of control.\n\n“I felt lucky, because I had two good football teams,” he says. “If you get a game where there are going to be people punching and kicking and jumping all over the place, it’s going to be a hard one. If you get one where they play football, you’re lucky. I had Tottenham and Forest… it wasn’t going to be like trying to referee the Crazy Gang.”\n\nWhat Milford had not envisaged was that Spurs had a player who, in the final’s opening exchanges, lost control in a manner that might have been considered excessive even for that notorious Wimbledon team of the same era.\n\nAs Gascoigne wrote in his autobiography: “I was a bit revved up, even before I got on the pitch.”\n\nMilford says he did not see Gascoigne’s studs connect with Parker’s rib cage and that, without microphone link-ups in a pre-VAR era, there was no real communication with the linesman other than a “sort of shake of the head” to get the message that, yes, it was a bad one.\n\nHe did see the second one, though, and what he said at the time is what he says now: that it would have been wrong to send off a player who had just been badly injured. “I went over to Paul on the ground and my hand was going into my pocket to get out a card. I then saw the pain on his face and the (Spurs) trainer, Dave Butler, looked up at me and said, ‘He’s finished’. That settled it for me. What would people have said had I stuffed a card under his nose while he was being carried off?”\n\nThis is the part that will always divide opinion when a referee’s job is to apply the rules, regardless of the circumstances. But Milford seems entirely comfortable with his version of events.\n\n“You referee with your heart,” he explains. “A few years before, the referee (Peter Willis) sent off a Manchester United player, Kevin Moran, in the cup final. It was in the papers that, ‘the referee ruined the cup final’.\n\n“I hadn’t forgotten that. And I was thinking, ‘Blimey. It’s the cup final, somebody was sent off a few years ago and it ruined the cup final. Did you see what happened clearly? Was it really that bad?’ There was a long delay while Gascoigne was being treated on the pitch. And when they said he was going off they were doing me a favour.\n\n“What would it have looked like to send him off while he was on a stretcher?\n\n“I felt for Gazza. I was thinking, ‘The poor bugger is going off. He doesn’t want to go off with a card, whether it is yellow or red’. People say to me, ‘Would you change your mind now?’ And I say, ‘No. What I thought on the day was correct. I would do exactly the same again’.”\n\nIt was always one of Clough’s golden rules never to criticise referees. If any of his players spoke out of turn to match officials, they risked being substituted and publicly embarrassed. It was one of the reasons referees enjoyed taking charge of Forest matches.\n\nClough did not even mention in his autobiography that Spanish referee Emilio Guruceta Muro had accepted a bribe from Belgian opponents Anderlecht to cheat Forest in a 1984 UEFA Cup semi-final.\n\nBut the two-time European Cup-winning manager, who died in 2004, did break his own rule by criticising Milford in the same book. Gascoigne, Clough said, had behaved like a “hooligan” and a “demented bull”— and his son, Nigel, was even more condemnatory a few years ago.\n\nClough Jr was playing for Forest that day and, judging by a 2014 interview with The Guardian, he has never forgiven Milford for his failure to reduce Spurs to 10 players. “Roger Milford, that’s my memory,” he said. “If the referee had done his job properly, he might also have saved Paul Gascoigne’s career. Instead, poor old Gazza goes off on a stretcher, after two of the worst tackles you will ever see, and without receiving so much as a yellow card.\n\n“To this day, I’m still absolutely flabbergasted.”\n\nMilford’s response is cutting.\n\n“Nigel’s not half the man his father was,” he says.\n\n“Brian was absolutely superb. He’d come into the dressing room after games and say, ‘Well done’.\n\n“I would not say one bad word about Mr Clough. He was a lovely man. In those days you used to go into the dressing room to check the players’ studs. ‘Right lads’, he’d say, ‘put your feet up’. Then he’d turn to me. ‘Any trouble this afternoon, Roger, give me a shout and I will pull them off’.\n\n“He came into my dressing room at Chelsea once and said, ‘Best referee I’ve seen for years, mate, you’ll go far’. So I couldn’t care a damn what Nigel says. Nigel’s not the most liked man by referees.”\n\nMilford certainly does not sound like he has any regrets. He continued refereeing at the highest level until 1994, being assigned a total of seven matches at Wembley, and he names Kevin Keegan, Joe Royle and Alex Ferguson among the managers with whom he had a good relationship. “Alex and I got on like a house on fire. Everyone says Alex was awful with referees. But guess who sent me the first letter when I retired.”\n\nDespite everything, Milford also has fond memories of his one shot at an FA Cup final, in particular, the walk up the old stadium’s tunnel behind the east goal, then the roar as the teams emerged into the arena. He has his medal. His conscience, he says, is clear.\n\n“He ruined his career,” he says of Gascoigne. “I didn’t ruin it for him. If I’d sent him off, it would have made no difference.\n\n“It was a good final. It had everything you wanted to talk about — penalties, extra time, you name it. You just hope in a cup final it goes well. That one, for me, went well… apart from what happened to Gazza.”\n\nIt helps, of course, that referees tend to have thick skin. “Was I right to give a penalty? Yes. Nobody mentions that. What about the own goal Des Walker scored? Was that my fault as well? All people want to talk about is that (Gascoigne) incident. Which is wrong. There was a 90-minute game, plus 30 minutes of extra time.”\n\nAnd now he is chuckling.\n\n“I coach referees now, at a local level,” he says. “They come up to me sometimes and say, ‘Hey, what did you think…?’ And that’s when I say, ‘Don’t even think about it!’ Listen, I laugh about it. I wouldn’t say it’s famous — it’s more infamous than famous — but it happened and I tell people I would not change it for the world.”\n\n(Top photo: Getty Images/design: Sam Richardson)"
