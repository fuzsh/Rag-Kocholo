        "text": "Jose Mourino has led his Roma side to the first-ever Europa Conference League final, but Mourinho himself has managed in four different major European finals as well as three Super Cups across his long career, so we've decided to go through each one and analyse how his teams fared.\n\nIn his earlier career, he was regarded as a master of winning trophies, and while that reputation has been damaged over the course of the last five years he undeniably has the pedigree to deliver Roma their first trophy since the Copa Italia in 2008.\n\nIf he does so, it will be their first major European trophy, despite the fact they have won the much sought-after Inter-Cities Fairs and Anglo-Italian cups.\n\nThat's despite the fact they've reached two big European finals, losing the European Cup on penalties to Liverpool in 1984 and to Italian rivals Inter in the UEFA Cup over two legs in 1991.\n\nMeanwhile, Mourinho has featured in a lot more than that, across four different clubs. The Portuguese coach has never lost a major European final, although he's never won the Super Cup, surprisingly enough.\n\nSo, here are all seven of his previous appearances in chronological order, and how he and his teams fared.\n\nPorto, UEFA Cup 2003\n\nMourinho's first European final, and his announcement on the main stage that he was going to be something special.\n\nIn a run that perhaps epitomised the old UEFA Cup, Mourinho's Porto had to go through Lens, Turkish side Denizlispor, Panathinaikos, and Lazio before facing Celtic in the final at the Estadio Olimpico in Seville.\n\nIt was a superb match, with a Henrik Larsson brace seeing him twice level for Celtic to force extra-time where a silver goal (yes, a silver goal) from Brazilian striker Derlei gave Mourinho his first taste of European glory.\n\nYou know who to thank when you win your football pub quiz now.\n\nPorto, Super Cup 2003\n\nWith a UEFA Cup back in the north of Portugal, Porto headed to Monaco to face off AC Milan in the Super Cup.\n\nJust a few legends in the Milan side. Paolo Maldini, Gennaro Gattuso, Andrea Pirlo, Clarence Seedorf, Andriy Sevchenko and Filippo Inzaghi. Oh, and there was Rivaldo on the bench. And Cafu. Managed by Carlo Ancelotti.\n\nPorto? Benni McCarthy leading the line. We're surprised they lost 1-0 too.\n\nPorto, Champions League 2004\n\nPorto were priced at 50-1 to win the 2003-04 Champions League, but if Mourinho was a betting man we reckon he would have stuck a fair bit on him doing it anyway.\n\nAnd then he actually went and did it.\n\nIt was a strange Champions League season, with Bayern and Manchester United (defeated by Porto, insert iconic celebration here) knocked out in the Round of 16 and Real and AC Milan taken care of in the quarters.\n\nThat left a final four of Deportivo, Porto, Chelsea (who were the newly rich boys back then), and Monaco.\n\nAt that point, Mourinho would have been confident. He had reason to be; a professional, classic 1-0 over to legs job on Depor was followed by a 3-0 thumping of Monaco in the final to win Porto the Champions League, the first time in 17 years a Portuguese side had done so.\n\nIf no one was taking notice of Mourinho before, they were now. He was everywhere, and soon he would be in West London signing for Chelsea.\n\nInter Milan, Champions League 2010\n\nPorto was special, and so were Mourinho's teams in Chelsea although they never quite managed to lift the European Cup.\n\nBut Inter? That was different gravy. Or different pasta sauce. Or different *inset some Italian alternative here*.\n\nHe completely man-handled Louis van Gaal's Bayern Munich in the final, with a brace for Diego Milito, yet it was the semi-final that was perhaps his crowning managerial glory.\n\nBasically kicking every ball himself and winning every 50-50 with his echoing touchline shouts, Mourinho's Inter contained Pep's Barcelona. 3-1 in the San Siro was impressive, but limiting Barca to 1-0 back at the Camp Nou was even more so.\n\nBravo, Signor Mourinho.\n\nChelsea, Super Cup 2013\n\nPep Guardiola vs Jose Mourinho in a European final? Oh yes.\n\nThe pair's rivalry whilst at Barcelona and Real Madrid was the stuff of legend, so of course fate conspired to see them meet early on in their first new jobs since they were Clasico foes â in the UEFA Super Cup, surprisingly the only European final Mourinho contested across his two stints as Blues boss.\n\nMourinho returned to Chelsea after burning his bridges at the Bernabeu while Guardiola inherited Jupp Heynckes' treble-winners Bayern Munich after his year-long sabbatical.\n\nThe game itself was a cracker. Reigning Europa League champions Chelsea gave Bayern a proper test, and twice took the lead â first through Fernando Torres and then via Eden Hazard.\n\nBut an injury-time Javi Martinez equaliser took the tie to penalties, and Guardiola's Bayern lifted the trophy after a missed spot-kick from a 20-year-old Romelu Lukaku.\n\nManchester United, Europa League 2017\n\n14 years on from his UEFA Cup triumph, Mourinho set his mind on updating his trophy cabinet with the newly named Europa League trophy which, of course, is not a league.\n\nFavourites from the outset, Mourinho's men certainly bided their luck at times on the way to the final but against Ajax they had no issues, winning 2-0. Mourinho insisted that the Charity Shield, League Cup and Europa League counted as a treble. Yes, the worst in history.\n\nManchester United, Super Cup 2017\n\nWas the Europa League a sign of the exciting, battling Mourinho team United would become on the way to the Premier League title? No. Would they at least win a solitary Super Cup against Real Madrid to give fans hope? Also, no.\n\nIn Skopje, a single goal from new signing Romelu Lukaku failed to spark a comeback and Madrid won 2-1 in the Macedonian capital.\n\nMourinho post-match was his usual self.\n\nâWe were playing against a team of fantastic players and we discussed the result until almost the end, not the end but almost the end,â he said after the game.\n\nâAlmost the end because when Cristiano Ronaldo is coming, the referee decided to show the respect for this amazing player, and then game over because every time Cristiano wanted a free-kick the game was stopped.â\n\nHow United fans wish that was the same now."
