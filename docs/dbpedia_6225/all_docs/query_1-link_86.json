        "text": "The Premier League has a long tradition of being an elite soccer league of the highest quality. The Premier League is a powerhouse of elite teams with many great players, both young and old. It’s not just go-getting billionaires that make it so special, it’s also the history of players at each club, from past champions to fan favorites and national team stars.\n\nThe First Division’s clubs left to establish the Premier League in 1991, which is currently widely regarded as the greatest league in the world. The Premier League has been full of surprises and clubs that have succeeded against the odds in its three decades of existence.\n\nSo, let’s take a look at that past and see which Premier League teams will be the oldest in 2022.\n\n14. Newcastle United Football Club\n\nphoto source: wikiwand.com\n\nNewcastle United Football Club is a top-tier English football team that is situated in Newcastle upon Tyne and competes in the Premier League. By combining Newcastle East End and Newcastle West End, the club was established on December 9, 1892.\n\nNewcastle East End and Newcastle West End, two more established Tyneside clubs, merged to form the new club. The newly combined club was given the moniker Newcastle United to denote the union.\n\nAs of May 2022, the club has spent 90 seasons in the Premier League, having been a part of the league for all but three of its existence. Since joining the Football League in 1893, the team has never finished lower than the second division of English football.\n\nNewcastle has won the ninth-most trophies of any English team, including four League crowns, six FA Cups, an FA Charity Shield, the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1968–1969, and the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2006.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nA game of football was first noted on Tyneside on March 3, 1877, at the Elswick Rugby Club. Tyne Association, Newcastle’s first football club, was founded later that year.\n\n13. Liverpool Football Club\n\nphoto source: aa.com.tr\n\nAn English professional football team Liverpool Football Club is situated in Liverpool. The club plays in the Premier League, the top division of English football.\n\nIn order to create a new club, Liverpool FC, John Houlding famously resigned from the Everton board on March 15, 1892. The club was legally recognized by the Board of Trade on June 3, giving that day its birthdate.\n\nThe team has amassed a record nine League Cups, eight FA Cups, nine League championships, and sixteen FA Community Shields at home. The club has won six European Cups, three UEFA Cups, four UEFA Super Cups—all English records—and one FIFA Club World Cup in international tournaments.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nLiverpool plays Middlesbrough Ironopolis in their first-ever Football League match on September 2, 1893.\n\n12. Brentford Football Club\n\nphoto source: skysports.com\n\nProfessional football team Brentford Football Club is situated in Brentford, West London, England. At the conclusion of the 2020–21 Championship season, they were promoted via the playoffs to play in the Premier League, the top division of English football.\n\nThe Brentford Local Board’s decision to build a new recreation ground in the town is responsible for the establishment of the Brentford Football Club in 1889.\n\nThe Team finished sixth in their inaugural season in the premier division, better than any other London club and ahead of Chelsea and Arsenal.\n\nBrentford’s most prosperous period began in 1926 with the hiring of Harry Curtis as manager, and it culminated with the club’s first-ever promotion to the top division of English football in 1933 and 1935.\n\nBrentford was one of the premier teams in England thanks to three straight top-six performances in the First Division, but a slide that started in 1938 resulted in the team’s relegation back to the Third Division South by 1954.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nWhen Borough Road College students attended a game in the 1890s and screamed the school’s mantra, “buck up Bs,” in support of their buddy and then-Brentford player Joseph Gettins, they unwittingly coined the moniker.\n\n11. Arsenal Football Club\n\nphoto source: theathletic.com\n\nIn Islington, London, England, there is a professional football team called the Arsenal Football Club. In addition to 13 league titles, the squad has won a record 14 FA Cups, two League Cups, sixteen FA Community Shields, one European Cup Winners’ Cup, and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.\n\nArsenal has sort of been a recurring bridesmaid in recent years. The team was among the favorites to win the league, but they would undoubtedly lose ground in the title race due to a spate of serious injuries and/or disappointing losses.\n\nArsenal has now become the most successful club in the history of the FA Cup thanks to the three more trophies won in 2005, 2014, and 2015, which serve as a type of consolation gift for the club’s supporters.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nWith the employees being blacksmiths who made cannons, Arsenal Football Club began as a works team called Dial Square in 1886. This is how the club got its moniker, the Gunners.\n\n10. Southampton Football Club\n\nphoto source: sportzcraazy.com\n\nIn the Premier League, Southampton Football Club represents England as a professional football team which is situated in Southampton, Hampshire. Prior to 2001, when they moved to St Mary’s Stadium as their home stadium, they were headquartered in The Dell.\n\nDue in part to their close proximity and their respective maritime histories, Southampton and Portsmouth have a long-running South Coast derby rivalry.\n\nIn 1885, St. Mary’s Church members founded the club. As indicated by its most well-known moniker, The Saints, the club’s roots in the church still play a significant role in who they are.\n\nBefore being selected to join the Football League Third Division as a founding member in 1920, Southampton won the Southern League six times and lost in the FA Cup finals in 1900 and 1902.\n\nSports Republic purchased a majority share in Southampton Football Club on January 4, 2022, therefore acquiring ownership of the team. Mr. Gao’s ownership in the club was acquired by an investment company in the sports and entertainment sector, while Katharina Liebherr kept her minority ownership.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe club had previously utilized the city’s emblem, which was designed in its initial iteration in the 1970s. The logo underwent a change in the 1990s.\n\n9. Leicester City Football Club\n\nphoto source: premiereleague.com\n\nThe East Midlands city of Leicester is home to the English professional football team Leicester City Football Club. Former students of Wyggeston School created the club in 1884 under the name Leicester Fosse.\n\nBefore landing on Filbert Street in 1891, Leicester played at five different venues. Filbert Street would serve as their home stadium for the following 111 years.\n\nThe wait for Leicester City’s first FA Cup victory, which had lasted 137 years, ended in May.\n\nThe Foxes met Chelsea in the 2021 FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium on May 15, 2021, after defeating Stoke City, Brentford, Brighton & Hove Albion, Manchester United, and Southampton earlier in the competition.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe Premier League title won by Leicester City Football Club from 2015 to 2016 was their first and only championship to date.\n\n8. Tottenham Hotspur Football Club\n\nphoto source: hotspurshq.com\n\nIn 1882, a group of grammar school students from All Hallows Church created Tottenham Hotspur FC. The team was originally known as Hotspur, but the name was quickly changed to Tottenham Hotspur to prevent confusion with an earlier organization known as Hotspur FC.\n\nThey played St. Albans in the London Association Cup in 1885 for their first-ever competitive game. Spurs won 5-2, and the light blue and white parts became the new colors. Nine shillings are owed on the initial credit balance.\n\nThe sixteen years Nicholson spent in charge of Tottenham are widely regarded as the best in the club’s history.\n\nDuring his tenure, Tottenham won the League title in 1961, three FA Cups in 1961, 1962, and 1967, two League Cups in 1971 and 1973, one Cup Winners’ Cup in 1963, and the first-ever UEFA Cup in 1972.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTottenham Hotspur Football Club has crowned the FA Cup and Football League Champions in 1961. Since Preston North End and Aston Villa did it in 1889 and 1897, respectively, they were the first club to complete the “Double.”\n\n7. Manchester City\n\nphoto source: guardian.ng\n\nArthur Connell, the rector of St. Mark’s Church, and his daughter Anna Connell came up with the idea to start the club, which eventually took the name St. Mark’s. They would change their name to Manchester City in 1894 after going by Gorton FC and Ardwick AFC for briefer times.\n\nManchester City faces Spurs in the 100th FA Cup final in 1981. One of the most thrilling Cup finals in history was played at Wembley after a 1-1 draw on the previous Saturday.\n\nAfter a historic Ricky Villa goal, City was narrowly defeated 3-2, but for City supporters, Steve Mackenzie’s 30-yard volley was the superior shot.\n\nManchester City wins the League Cup for the fourth time straight and wins the Premier League for the third time in four years in 2021. After fierce competition with Liverpool in 2022, City defeats Aston Villa in a thrilling final-day victory to win the Premier League for the fourth time in five years.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe Blues were the first Manchester team to win a significant trophy in 1904 when they defeated Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup final at Crystal Palace.\n\n6. Fulham Football Club\n\nphoto source: fulham-fc.co.uk\n\nSince its founding in 1879, Fulham Football Club has held the title of the oldest professional football club in London. The Club was established when a schoolteacher and a churchwarden organized a team for neighborhood youths.\n\nFulham won the Southern League in the seasons 1905–06 and 1906–07, and the following year they were admitted to the Football League’s Second Division.\n\nAfter winning the play-off finals in 2018 and 2020, Fulham was demoted, and after winning the 2021–22 Championship, they are once again playing in the Premier League. This is Fulham’s fifth consecutive season at a different level.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nEven though cricket originally took precedence, the squad won its first trophy, the West London Amateur Cup, seven years later after defeating St Matthew’s 2-1.\n\n5. Manchester United Football Club\n\nphoto source: forbes.com\n\nThe Newton Heath L&YR Football Club was the original name of the organization that would subsequently change its name to Manchester United Football Club. L&YR stands for Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, where the team member was employed.\n\nManchester United has won a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, five League Cups, and a record 21 FA Community Shields. They have each taken home a single trophy from the FIFA Club World Cup, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and Intercontinental Cup.\n\nThe European Cup and UEFA Champions League have each been won by them three times.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nCristiano Ronaldo was transferred to Real Madrid in 2009 for a sum of £80 million.\n\n4. Everton Football Club\n\nphoto source: yogonet.com\n\nThe St. Domingo Church Sunday School was responsible for founding the Everton Football Club. St. Domingo’s FC’s name was changed to Everton after two years to honor a neighborhood in Liverpool.\n\nThe football team Everton FC swiftly became one of the best of its time. They were one of the first twelve teams that made up the Football League, the world’s first professional football league.\n\nTheir first experience with a trophy came in 1891 when the team dominated to claim its first League crown. They make it to their first FA Cup final in 1893.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe nicknames “Evertonians” or “Blues” are used to refer to the club’s fans.\n\n3. Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club\n\nphoto source: sportzcraazy.com\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers, along with eleven other teams, were founding members of the Football League when it was formed in 1877. It was the first domestic football league in history and is now known as the English Football League.\n\nThe team known as Wolves has won 17 significant trophies during its history, including 11 league championships, four FA Cups, and two League Cups.\n\nNuno Espirito Santo became the team’s manager in May 2017 after Fosun purchased it in 2016. In Nuno’s first year in command, the Wolves were relegated from the Premier League and then promoted.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers defeated Everton 1-0 in the FA Cup final at Fallowfield, Manchester, in 1893 to claim the trophy for the first time.\n\n2. Aston Villa Football Club\n\nphoto source: birminghammail.co.uk\n\nAston Villa is a legendary name in English football, with a strong history that includes being one of the first Football League clubs in 1888.
