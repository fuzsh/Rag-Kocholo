        "text": "It’s the last official match in the European season and is widely regarded as the biggest club game in Europe. The Champions League final is a special event, even for those who are not that much into the sport, as the excitement it brings goes far beyond any other match.\n\nThe Champions League, known as the European Cup until 1992, when FC Barcelona won the title against Sampdoria, is the continent’s most prestigious tournament.\n\nBorussia Dortmund and Real Madrid collided in this year’s final on Saturday, with Los Blancos winning 2-0to claim a record-extending 15th European title. Late goals by Dani Carvajal and Vinícius Júnior earned the Spaniards their latest continental crown, which leaves them eight tournament wins ahead of the European Cup/Champions League’s next-most decorated club, AC Milan.\n\nDortmund and Madrid met at the 90,000-seat Wembley Stadium, which has hosted eight finals in its history, three of which have come since the ground’s renovation in 2007. The Germans also featured in the previous final hosted at the iconic venue, with the Black and Yellow losing 2-1 to domestic rivals Bayern Munich in 2013.\n\nWhere is the 2025 Champions League final?\n\nThe Champions League final will travel from England to Germany in 2025. The last round of the tournament will be held at Bayern Munich’s Allianz Arena.\n\nThe Bavarian stadium will host a second major soccer event in less than a year. It’s one of the arenas that will stage Euro 2024 matches this summer, as Germany is the competition’s host nation.\n\nIt will be the second time the 75,000-seater Allianz Arena has hosted the UCL final. The arena was the setting for the showpiece event in 2012, when Bayern lost to Chelsea. The teams were level at 1-1 after 90 minutes and extra time, so the match went to a penalty shoot-out, with the Blues edging it 4–3 to clinch their first Champions League title."
