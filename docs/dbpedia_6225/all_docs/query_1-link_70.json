        "text": "This rant follows on from Part 1. Follow Follow. I will Follow. Yup – it’s yet another Rangers-U2 mash-up …\n\nRuination Day Part II\n\nWe’d defeated Bohemians of Dublin, narrowly, in the preceding round. On the pitch for Inter that night was Liam Brady. We had a lot to apologise to him for that evening – I remember the saliva being directed his way when the Eire international attempted to take a corner. He’d have been under no illusions about Glasgow life when he became Celtic manager seven years later.\n\nBut the main Irish connection for me was my contemporary obsession with U2. They too were playing Glasgow that night. A group of school friends had booked us seats on a bus to the Barrowlands. Owning every album so far and every single they’d released (except, ironically, A day without me) I was assured a ticket for the gig. I’d more or less been the only person at school who’d caught the UK screening of their seminal open air concert at Red Rocks, Colorado and had spread the word, with the album, among my peers. I was also assured my seat on the Stevenston Masonic Rangers Supporters Club bus. My aunt and uncle – more into Bowie – had my other ticket.\n\nThis game, Rangers v Internazionale in the UEFA Cup, didn’t mark the moment I took the road less travelled. It decided the route I’d travel farthest along. U2 were the best U2 would ever be that night, in one of their most legendary gigs – they blew the minds of everyone there. I would have loved it. But I took Rangers at their lowest ebb, against Inter in a rut, in a game sensational only to me. I saw The Smiths about a year later and that was all I really needed in terms of concert-going. Maybe I’d have felt the same about European football if my first experience had been the Real Madrid – Eintracht Frankfurt final of 1960. But Rangers Under a Blue and Black Sky rocked my world because it gave a strong but not overpowering taste of what both clubs, and European competition itself, had been and could be. It left oh so much to still be desired\n\nHad I gone to that U2 concert on 7th November 1984 I’d probably never have met that Interisti [sic?] in November 1994 [See! You have to read Part 1] who was at the first leg in the San Siro ten years previously … which I saw on the telly and was depressed by. And he would have watched RAIUNO’s coverage of the second leg and been at least temporarily worried. And that let me share something far more bloody interesting than anything Bono had to say.\n\nI saw Inter draw 1-1 with Milan at the San Siro in 1994. And, just to book-end their place in my European evolution, 21 years and one month after my first taste, I next saw Inter at Ibrox the night Rangers finally qualified for the knock-out stages of Champions League. This time Inter wore white and we wore blue. I was in the top deck of the Govan Stand this time. All the seats in Ibrox were blue now. It was my season ticket seat but I know entry to this game cost me more than a fiver and that I’d have paid ten times what I did to be there.\n\nAdriano of Brazil scored for Inter after half an hour and we thought we were out. But they were already through, and a draw could suit us, and Denmark’s Peter Lovenkrands levelled eight minutes later, and there were no more goals. Letting us have our night again. That Italian pragmatism again. Herrera again.\n\nBut at the final whistle we still needed to know Porto had drawn at Artmedia Bratislava. Everyone knew they were still playing injury time in Slovakia, everyone knew it was 0-0 over there and everyone stayed behind at Ibrox, watching the big Jumbotron screens for the final scoreline from central Europe, to find out if we could celebrate. Everyone stayed, including the Inter fans. That mutual respect again. The first meeting, in the San Siro was behind closed doors because of trouble at Inter’s Champions League semi against Milan the previous season; We were the first side ever to be prevented from defending a European trophy – because of crowd trouble. Not nice but an embarrassment shared. In December 2005 Inter and Rangers both went through to the next round and we cheered each other’s good news.\n\nI couldn’t have asked for more fitting guests at one of the most significant European moments in my Rangers-supporting life. Celtic were the first British team to win the European Cup, Rangers were the first British team to play in the Champions League proper – and now we were the first Scottish club ever to get out of a Champions League Group. The Inter fans were also in a different spot from where they were in 1984, and they were again five years away from ending their most pressing lack – this time lifting the Champions League. I watched from above as blue fans in both white and black, near my 1984 seat, exchanged scarves and applause with our visitors. I wondered if there was a bloke in that wee visitors corner of Ibrox thinking about two Scots munching snacks on the Corso Buenos Aires.\n\nMario Corso. He played in all three of Buenos Aires-born Herrera’s European Cup final teams. The plaques on the walls of the ramps up to the seats in the San Siro screamed the glory of European football, gave UEFA finals a veneration only Italians can manage (this is a country where bus drivers look more regal than a Royal Navy admiral of the fleet). In 1994, my mate and I sat in that bona fide football palace, close to the Milan curva, again with Inter the away team. The atmosphere was more aesthetically charged but not as audibly violent as an Old Firm game. The presence of so many tourists like ourselves created a huge non-partisan buffer. But the deluge of rockets and flares created spectacle and drama (and the odd stoppage while wee blokes with buckets of sand did their bit).\n\nHere I was, ten years after seeing Inter at my team’s house, watching them visiting their own. The San Siro is, of course, officially named the Giuseppe Meazza, after a Milanese-born World Cup legend of the Mussolini years who played for both tenants but, most spectacularly, for Inter. So while Milan have won more European trophies, it’s kinda apt that only I Nerazzurri have contested European finals at their shared home. This concrete and steel behemoth, with its largely useless but spectacular roof and extra height added for the 1990 World Cup, is the scene of so much Inter glory – scene of four of their European finals:\n\nJoy, in the 1965 European Cup final against ten man-Benfica under Herrera – arguably the nadir of catenaccio; Horror in the 1997 UEFA Cup final 2nd leg against Schalke under Hodgson – arguably the nadir of respect for the manager after Herrera’s cult of personality. And, in-between times, two UEFA Cups secured officially or effectively in the San Siro leg of the final:\n\nInter sat back and defended a 1-0 lead against an injury-ravaged Benfica in 65, in front of 80,000 of their own punters. Their fans and players abused Hodgson physically and verbally after losing to the Germans on penalties 33 years later. But in 1991’s all-Italian final, a 2-0 lead over AS Roma sustained the subsequent 1-0 loss in the capital’s Olympic Stadium.\n\nAnd, when I was in the Giuseppe Meazza, in November 1994, Inter were again the UEFA Cup holders. In the final they’d defeated Casino Austria Salzburg in Vienna’s Ernst Happel Stadium, scene of their first European Cup final, their 3-1 defeat of Real Madrid in 1964. They beat Salzburg 1-0 for a second time in the return leg, at the scene of their second – and last – European Cup win.\n\nThe night I visited the San Siro, Inter drew their local derby 1-1. I would have loved it anyway. But the fact Milan, that night, were also the Champions League holders, shifted the whole experience into the realms of the tectonic. Twice in the game – and I was counting – the rival captains, Franco Baresi and Giuseppe Bergomi, contested 50-50 balls. They won one a-piece and neither head-on collision could have been more shudderingly iconic if they’d smacked each other with the relevant UEFA trophy while they were at it.\n\nIn 1988-89, Two seasons after Rangers broke the championship duck they were enduring on my first night of European club competition, Inter reclaimed Lo Scudetto. I immediately went to Woolies and bought 110 Goals Italia Style, a video compilation of that season’s Serie A highlights, all from Sky. VHS tapes opened a new way into European football for us voyeurs. Inter had two new Germans. Lothar Matthäus and Andreas Brehme finished off what Rummenigge started – watching the footage only made me want more.\n\nI watched BBC and Channel 4 highlights of Inter’s two UEFA Cup wins in the early 1990s and saw the clips of Inter’s Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano trying to punch Hodgson in 97 (or in the face). Zenga, Baresi and Bergomi – who’d gone on to lose to Real Madrid in the semis of that 1984-85 edition – featured in one or all of those finals. But they were all gone by 1998 when Inter won that coppa yooayfa, in Paris, in a one-off final , destroying Lazio in the middle of my own university finals. I was on at least one exam per day for a week. A mature student in name only, such trivia wouldn’t distract me from Inter live on the telly.\n\nAnd in May 2010, two weeks after my nephew was born, Inter won the Champions League in the first ever Saturday European Cup final. I was an uncle for the first time and the month was topped by the club my own aunt and uncle once took me to see. Of course I immediately explained to my nephew, as I would have to Constable Junior, the difference between football and painting.\n\nThe game doesn’t provide a blank canvas, but we can render our own imaginings on top of it almost limitlessly. TV shows us the original, but in neither the most violent of its realisms nor the most frenzied of our romanticising. The Hay Wain is The Hay Wain. It’s not a cart in a puddle in a Suffolk field. You can see it as such if that’s enough for you but, if not, it offers all sorts of depths to explore. Similarly, Inter at Ibrox in 1984 is fixed only in the time it was rendered. I’d forgotten just how physically brutal the Rangers players had been that night but I’d also unimagined just how brilliant our performance was.\n\nA moribund Rangers gave an even bigger institution a night to forget and me one I’ll always remember. Those two teams decided how I wanted to spend my midweek leisure time for the rest of my life. The match ticket is framed on my wall and now, in 2018, my club is owned by Rangers International PLC – that’s Inter Rangers to you and me.\n\nA few hours before the first Champions League final played during his life, I gave my nephew’s mum, who once lived and worked in Milan and has a degree in Italian, the official UEFA commemorative badge I bought when attending the 2002 Champions League final (To “keep for the wee man”, ye know?). I should really have given her a petrol cap.\n\nI did eventually see U2. I saw them at the SECC in 1987, about a month after I finally saw Rangers winning the league. The Joshua Tree tour – the tour of the last piece of their music I ever bought or ever remotely cared about.\n\nI did eventually get to the Glasgow Barrowlands. I saw the Charlatans there in October 1999. Having a drink in The Rock Garden pub before catching a taxi to the gig, I watched Henrik Larsson break his leg playing for Celtic in Lyon. But the best concert I ever saw there was Gillian Welch, in July 2004. Alternative Country indeed.\n\nOne of my favourite Welch songs is April the 14th Part I. Along with Ruination Day Part II it tells the story of when she first wished she “played in a rock ’n roll band”. She casually happens upon an unspectacular, dishevelled, world-weary group, in a far from full-house, with an incapable lead singer, working their way through their set as best they can. But they have a life-changing effect on Welch.\n\nIt’s clear throughout both versions of the story – the former embodying the pathos of the show, the latter the dramatic personal effect on Welch – that the lack of hype or expectation around the mythical gig is what allowed her to feel she had that group, that night, to herself. It worked on her so powerfully, transformed her life, because it was the kind of concert where “No-one showed from the local press”. As far as I know, RAIUNO aren’t from Govan.\n\nGillian Welch remembers the date of that gig. Her April the 14th is my November 7th.\n\nYou’ve been amazing – thankyouverymuchgoodnight."
