        "text": "The month of May is when legends come to life on Your World of Champions, SuperSport brings you unbeatable football with seven Cup finals to savour.\n\nIt’s Squeaky-bum-time in the splendour of HD as we bring you three African cup finals and four European titles all in two weeks.\n\nThree down, four more to go!\n\nEUROPA CONFERENCE LEAGUE\n\nDate: May 25\n\nTime: 21H00 CAT\n\nThe first Uefa Europa Conference League final, between Jose Mourinho’s Roma and Feyenoord, will be played in Tirana, Albania. Roma have yet to win a major European trophy – they were European Cup runners-up in 1984 and beaten in the 1991 Uefa Cup final by Inter Milan. Meanwhile, Feyenoord won the Uefa Champions League trophy when it was still the European Cup in 1970, and picked up the Uefa Cup, now the Uefa Europa League, in both 1974 and 2002. Roma will go into this one as favourites as they are coached by Jose ‘Special One’ Mourinho who has four European club titles to his name.\n\nNEDBANK CUP\n\nDate: May 28\n\nTime: 18H00 CAT\n\nRoyal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg will host this year’s final between Mamelodi Sundowns and ‘defending champions’ Marumo Gallants. Sundowns go into this final looking to wrap up a rare treble as they have already won the MTN8 and the DStv Premiership title, which was their fifth in succession. Sundowns qualified for the final with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Royal AM while Marumo Gallants beat Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) 1-0 in a lively Limpopo derby played at Thohoyandou Stadium.\n\nUefa CHAMPIONS LEAGUE\n\nDate: May 28\n\nTime: 21H00 CAT\n\nLiverpool and Real Madrid will battle it out in the 2021/22 Uefa Champions League final at the Saint-Denis's Stade de France. Built to stage games at the 1998 Fifa World Cup, the Stade de France was also the venue for the 2000 and 2006 Uefa Champions League finals, as well as the Uefa EURO 2016 showpiece. Four years may have passed since Madrid beat Liverpool in the 2018 final, but for Mohamed Salah, the memories are fresh and he tweeted simply: “We have a score to settle”.\n\nCAF CHAMPIONS LEAGUE\n\nDate: May 30\n\nTime: 21H00\n\nChannels: GSL2 / PSL / VR4A/LIYU / Maximo 1/Maximo 360\n\nDefending champions Al Ahly will face Wydad Casablanca in the Caf Champions League final in Morocco on Monday 30 May.\n\nThe clash of Ahly and Wydad will be a repeat of the 2017 Champions League final, which was won 2-1 on aggregate by the Moroccan side.\n\nPitso Mosimane’s Red Devils are chasing an unprecedented third successive Caf Champions League title – and a record extending 11th overall.\n\nFA CUP\n\nChampions: Liverpool\n\nRunners-up: Chelsea\n\nLiverpool held their nerve to win the FA Cup for the first time since 2006 after a dramatic penalty shootout against Chelsea as the quadruple chasers kept their history bid alive on Saturday.\n\nJurgen Klopp's side won 6-5 on penalties at Wembley as Greek defender Kostas Tsimikas was the unlikely hero with the decisive kick after Alisson Becker kept out Mason Mount's effort.\n\nEUROPA LEAGUE\n\nChampions: Eintracht Frankfurt\n\nRunners-up: Rangers\n\nEintracht Frankfurt defeated Rangers 5-4 on penalties to win the Europa League on Wednesday after the final in Seville finished 1-1 at the end of extra time.\n\nAaron Ramsey missed for Rangers in the shoot-out after coming on as a substitute with only three minutes left of extra-time, before Rafael Borre struck the winning shot to complete Frankfurt’s remarkable triumph.\n\nBorre was the hero of the night, after already cancelling out Joe Aribo's opener for Rangers as Frankfurt won their first European trophy since 1980 and booked their place in next season’s Champions League.\n\nCAF CONFEDERATION CUP\n\nChampions: RS Berkane\n\nRunners-up: Orlando Pirates\n\nRS Berkane defeated Orlando Pirates 5-4 on penalties following a 1-1 draw in the CAF Confederation Cup final at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Nigeria on Friday night.\n\nTherefore, the Oranges were crowned champions of the Confederation Cup for the second time following an entertaining encounter which saw Thembinkosi Lorch cancel out Youssef El Fahli's opening goal.\n\nMoroccan clubs continued their dominance of Africa's secondary club tournament as Raja Casablanca won last season's title having defeated Pirates in the quarter-finals. Berkane had clinched the ?2019-20? edition."
