        "text": "The new domestic season is just around the corner after a summer of international football at the Olympics, Euro 2024 and the Copa America - and for one Premier League team in Chelsea, a new start under a new boss also means a new competition.\n\nThey’ll be taking part in the newly rebranded Uefa Conference League - formerly the Europa Conference League - after finishing sixth in the top flight last season. That would have seen them sneak into the Europa League, but Manchester United’s FA Cup victory instead bumped them down into the third Uefa competition.\n\nEnzo Maresca has had a tricky start to life as boss after switching from Leicester in summer and he’s still yet to take charge of a top-flight game, but now knows he’ll need to beat either Braga or Servette to take Chelsea through into the group stage in Europe.\n\nFollow the live blog below for the full play-off round draw reaction and Chelsea’s draw:\n\nEuropa and Conference League play-off draws - LIVE\n\nHearts to face FC Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih or FC Viktoria Plzen\n\nChelsea face Braga or Servette in Conference League play-off\n\nUefa Conference League play-off draw LIVE\n\n13:32 , Karl Matchett\n\nThat’s all from us, just a final run-down of the opponents for the British teams:\n\nEuropa League\n\nFC Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih (UKR) / FC Viktoria Plzen (CZE) v Heart of Midlothian FC (SCO)\n\nQarabag FK (AZE) / PFC Ludogorets 1945 (BUL) v FC Petrocub (MDA) / The New Saints FC (WAL) (if TNS win)\n\nConference League\n\nChelsea FC (ENG) v SC Braga (POR) / Servette FC (SUI)\n\nFK Panevezys (LTU) / Maccabi Tel-Aviv FC (ISR) v FC Petrocub (MDA) / The New Saints FC (WAL) (if TNS lose)\n\nFC Dinamo Minsk (BLR) / Lincoln Red Imps FC (GIB) v FC Ballkani (KOS) / Larne FC (NIR)\n\nSt Mirren FC (SCO) / SK Brann (NOR) v CS Corvinul 1921 Hunedoara (ROU) / FC Astana (KAZ)\n\nF.C.

Well, not exactly the same, we’ve got bright green Conference branding instead of orange Europa.\n\nAnyway, again, we have several Groups already set out and the fixtures for the play-off are drawn from seeded and unseeded teams within each Group.\n\nChelsea are in Group 3.\n\nUefa Conference League play-off draw LIVE\n\n12:56 , Karl Matchett\n\nWe are just about ready to go with the Conference League draw, then.\n\nA reminder that along with Chelsea, we’ve got Kilmarnock, St. Mirren, Larne FC and St. Patrick’s Athletic involved from the British and Irish contingent.\n\nUefa Conference League play-off draw LIVE\n\n12:50 , Karl Matchett\n\nLast year in the still-then-named Europa Conference League, it was Olympicos who triumphed in the final to beat Fiorentina and become the first Greek side to win a European trophy.\n\nThey are into the Europa League this term as a result while Fiorentina are back and hoping for third time lucky, having lost the final two years in a row now.\n\nA few returning faces might well be seen, but not Aston Villa - they reached the semis of this competition last year, losing to Olympiacos having already seenoff Ajax and Lille, but Villa qualified for the Champions League for 24/25.\n\nOn the other side of the draw, Fiorentina knocked out Club Brugge in the semis.\n\nUefa Conference League play-off draw LIVE\n\n12:40 , Karl Matchett\n\nHere are all the dates you need to know if you happen to support Chelsea... or perhaps Kilmarnock, or indeed Fiorentina or Tromso or anyone else involved, really.\n\nGroup stage match dates\n\nMatchday 1: 3 October 2024\n\nMatchday 2: 24 October 2024\n\nMatchday 3: 7 November 2024\n\nMatchday 4: 28 November 2024\n\nMatchday 5: 12 December 2024\n\nMatchday 6: 19 December 2024\n\nKnockout match dates\n\nKnockout round play-offs: 13 & 20 February 2025\n\nRound of 16: 6 & 13 March 2025\n\nQuarter-finals: 10 & 17 April 2025\n\nSemi-finals: 1 & 8 May 2025\n\nFinal: 28 May 2025\n\nDates for each round’s draws\n\nFirst qualifying round: 18 June 2024\n\nSecond qualifying round: 19 June 2024\n\nThird qualifying round: 22 July 2024\n\nPlay-offs: 5 August 2024\n\nLeague phase: 30 August 2024\n\nKnockout round play-offs: 20 December 2024 (tbc)\n\nRound of 16, quarter-final, semi-final: 21 February 2025\n\nUefa Conference League play-off draw LIVE\n\n12:30 , Karl Matchett\n\nTime to focus entirely on the Conference League then. Here are all the key details for the 24/25 season:\n\nIt’s a single 36-team league this year in line with changes to the other Uefa competitions, with each side playing three home and three away fixtures against six different opponents.\n\nThe top eight go through to the last 16, ninth to 24th go into a play-off knockout round, with the eight winners from those games progressing to the last 16 and it’s a straightforward two-legged knockout from that point.\n\nThis year’s final is being held in Wroclaw, Poland.\n\nEuropa League and Conference League play-off draw LIVE\n\n12:20 , Karl Matchett\n\nThat concludes the play-off path draw for the Europa League - in 45 minutes it’s the turn of the Conference League which Chelsea are in, along with the likes of Kilmarnock.\n\nReminder of the upcoming games for British and Irish sides after this first draw:\n\nQarabag FK (AZE) / PFC Ludogorets 1945 (BUL) v FC Petrocub (MDA) / The New Saints FC (WAL)\n\nMalmo FF (SWE) / PAOK FC (GRE) v NK Celje (SVN) / Shamrock Rovers FC (IRL)\n\nFC Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih (UKR) / FC Viktoria Plzen (CZE) v Heart of Midlothian FC (SCO)\n\nEuropa League play-off draw LIVE\n\n12:16 , Karl Matchett\n\nEuropa League play-offs Group 3\n\nFC Midtjylland (DEN) / Ferencvarosi TC (HUN) v KI Klaksvík (FRO) / Borac Banja Luka (BIH)\n\nMolde FK (NOR) / Cercle Brugge KSV (BEL) v HNK Rijeka (CRO) / IF Elfsborg (SWE)\n\nSC Braga (POR) / Servette FC (SUI) v Trabzonspor A.S (TUR) / SK Rapid Wien (AUT)\n\nFC Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih (UKR) / FC Viktoria Plzen (CZE) v Heart of Midlothian FC (SCO)\n\nThere’s the draw for one of the Scottish Premiership sides involved today and the only one in the Europa League play-off draw today. Hearts head to either Ukrainian or Czech opposition.\n\nEuropa League play-off draw LIVE\n\n12:12 , Karl Matchett\n\nEuropa League play-offs Group 2\n\nLASK (AUT) v AC Sparta Praha (CZE) / Fotbal Club FCSB (ROU)\n\nUE Santa Coloma (AND) / FC RFS (LVA) v SK Slovan Bratislava (SVK) / APOEL FC (CYP)\n\nFK Panevezys (LTU) / Maccabi Tel-Aviv FC (ISR) v FK TSC Backa Topola (SRB)\n\nMalmo FF (SWE) / PAOK FC (GRE) v NK Celje (SVN) / Shamrock Rovers FC (IRL)\n\nEuropa League play-off draw LIVE\n\n12:09 , Karl Matchett\n\nSo TNS are off to Macedonia first and if they win, it’s off to Azerbaijan or Bulgaria in the first leg of the play-off.\n\nIn Group 2 we’ve got Shamrock Rovers from Ireland involved. On we go.\n\nEuropa League play-off draw LIVE\n\n12:09 , Karl Matchett\n\nEuropa League play-offs Group 1\n\nFC Dinamo Minsk (BLR) / Lincoln Red Imps FC (GIB) v RSC Anderlecht (BEL)\n\nJagiellonia Bialystok (POL) / FK Bodø/Glimt (NOR) v Panathinaikos FC (GRE) / AFC Ajax (NED)\n\nQarabag FK (AZE) / PFC Ludogorets 1945 (BUL) v FC Petrocub (MDA) / The New Saints FC (WAL)\n\nFK Partizan (SRB) / FC Lugano (SUI) v Besiktas JK (TUR)\n\nEuropa League play-off draw LIVE\n\n12:06 , Karl Matchett\n\nGroup 1 coming up: Ajax, Besiktas and Anderlecht are among the bigger names here. The New Saints FC are the Welsh representatives awaiting their fate.\n\nEuropa League play-off draw LIVE\n\n12:04 , Karl Matchett\n\nTom Barlow, the Uefa senior competitions manager is speaking now ahead of the draw:\n\nFirst legs on 22 August, second legs on 29.\n\nWe then embark on a ludicrous coefficient-based explanation of why there are so many teams, where they come from and why they are already split into draws. Not sure too many care any more, these get longer and longer.\n\nAnyway, the seeded and unseeded sides from each Group are in separate bowls, one from each is plucked and dropped into a new bowl, then they are shuffled and picked again to determine home and away in each leg.\n\nChelsea await Uefa Conference League draw\n\n12:01 , Karl Matchett\n\nNot that it affects today’s draw too much but a reminder of the national pairings who are kept apart by Uefa:\n\nArmenia – AzerbaijanGibraltar – SpainKosovo – Bosnia-HerzegovinaKosovo – SerbiaKosovo – Russia*Ukraine – Russia*Ukraine – Belarus\n\nRussia, in any case, remain prohibited from competing from Uefa competitions, including Russian club outfits.\n\nChelsea await Uefa Conference League draw\n\n11:52 , Karl Matchett\n\nSo the Europa League draw is up first of course, starting in around 10-15 minutes. Chelsea’s Conference League draw will follow that from 1pm.\n\nThe last time they were in a third-tier European competition was 1998/99, when they were in the old Uefa Cup Winners’ Cup and reached the semi-finals, losing to Mallorca before Lazio in turn beat the Spanish side in the final.\n\nSince then they’ve won the 2012 Champions League, the 2013 Europa League, the same competition again in 2019 and the 2021 Champions League.\n\nBit of a fall over the last couple of years since then, highlighting the job Maresca has on his hands.\n\nChelsea await Uefa Conference League draw\n\n11:45 , Karl Matchett\n\nNew Chelsea signing Marc Guiu reveals reasons behind Barcelona exit\n\nChelsea’s new striker Marc Guiu says his move to England was all about playing in the Premier League and not about money. The 18-year-old joined from Barcelona after the Blues triggered a £5m release clause in his contract, a move he described as a dream.\n\n“I’ve always dreamt of playing in the Premier League and Chelsea is a great club with a lot of history,” he said.\n\n“It was a tough decision but it was an amazing opportunity, so I had to go for it.”\n\nThe Spaniard has made four appearances for Chelsea during their preseason tour of the USA, scoring once in the 3-0 win over Club America - and he believes he is ready to make a name for himself in the Premier League.\n\nNew Chelsea signing Guiu reveals reasons behind Barcelona exit\n\nChelsea await Uefa Conference League draw\n\n11:35 , Karl Matchett\n\nEnzo Maresca hasn’t had an easy start to what is not an easy job, clearly.\n\nChelsea drew with Wrexham and lost to Celtic as well as Man City, though they have beaten Club America. Here’s what the head coach has said about his team’s summer form:\n\n“I have no doubts about the progress this team is making in this moment. Mistakes are part of the process.\n\n“I have known City for many years and even in friendly games, they don’t concede possession to the opposition, don’t concede many chances and they have long [spells of] possession. Thinking about the first half, I don’t remember them making six or seven passes in a row, so that was good from us off the ball.\n\n“On the ball, we had many long [spells of] possession, some good chances and – I don’t know but I think – we had about 60 per cent possession in the first half.\n\n“It doesn’t matter that it was a friendly game and they didn’t have six or seven of their starting players missing, this is the analysis of this moment.\n\n“In any game, if you concede two goals [early on], it is not good.”\n\nChelsea await Uefa Conference League draw\n\n11:25 , Karl Matchett\n\nSo this is one the more long-winded and quite absurd Uefa processes for these draws, involving teams from different paths and indeed different competitions, some of which are not yet known.\n\nBut the Groups are already set and seeded teams from each group therefore know they’ll be facing one of the unseeded options from that collection, meaning Chelsea’s options are thus:\n\nMaribor (Slovenia) or FK Vojvodina (Serbia)\n\nSpartak Trnava (Slovakia) or Wisla Krakow (Poland)\n\nPaksi FC (Hungary) or Mornar (Montenegro)\n\nSt Patrick's Athletic (Ireland) or Sabah (Azerbaijan)\n\nBraga (Portugal) or Servette (Switzerland)*\n\nNow, while that’s fairly straightforward for the most part, the top four fixtures listed there are Conference qualifying ties, so it would be Chelsea vs the winner of whichever they are drawn against.\n\nIf they are drawn against Braga or Servette, however, they will play the loser of that tie - as it’s a Europa League qualifier, so the loser drops down into the Conference play-off instead.\n\nChelsea await Uefa Conference League draw\n\n11:15 , Karl Matchett\n\nChelsea are the big British club involved of course, but not the only one today. Also featuring from the UK and Ireland in the two draws will be...\n\nEuropa League:\n\nThe New Saints FC (WAL) - unseeded Group 1\n\nShamrock Rovers FC (IRL) - unseeded Group 2\n\nHeart of Midlothian FC (SCO) - unseeded Group 3\n\nConference League:\n\nKilmarnock FC (SCO) - unseeded Group 1\n\nSt Mirren FC (SCO) - unseeded Group 2\n\nChelsea FC (ENG) - seeded Group 3\n\nSt Patrick’s Athletic (IRL) - unseeded Group 3\n\nChelsea await Uefa Conference League draw\n\n11:05 , Karl Matchett\n\nWe’ll explain shortly the entire draw procedure but for now you need to know Chelsea are seeded in Group 3, along with the following sides:\n\nSeeded\n\n1. Chelsea (ENG)\n\n2. FC Iberia 1999 Tbilisi (GEO) / İstanbul Başakşehir (TUR)\n\n3. FK Mladá Boleslav (CZE) / Hapoel Beer-Sheva FC (ISR)\n\n4. Ilves Tampere (FIN) / Djurgården (SWE)\n\n5. Molde FK (NOR) / Cercle Brugge KSV (BEL)\n\nUnseeded\n\n6. NK Maribor (SVN) / FK Vojvodina (SRB)\n\n7. SC Braga (POR) / Servette FC (SUI)\n\n8. FC Spartak Trnava (SVK) / Wisła Kraków (POL)\n\n9. Paksi FC (HUN) / FK Mornar (MNE)\n\n10. St Patrick’s Athletic (IRL) / FC Sabah (AZE)\n\n09:42 , Karl Matchett\n\nChelsea will discover their Europa Conference League play-off opponents on Monday when the draw is made in Nyon, Switzerland.\n\nThe Blues have endured a tough start to pre-season, with defeat to Manchester City on Saturday. And there is an early test in their 2024/25 campaign as qualifying for the Europa Conference League begins.\n\nAfter Manchester United’s victory over Manchester City in the FA Cup final in May secured Erik ten Hag’s side a place in the Europa League, the Blues dropped into the Europa Conference League.\n\nAnd their first match in the competition starts later this month, handing new boss Enzo Maresca, who was recruited from Leicester to replace Mauricio Pochettino, an early challenge.\n\nChelsea will be in the Main Path of the play-off round and will sit as one of the seeds, meaning a tie against one of the unseeded sides over two legs. Uefa will release full seedings, any groupings and the procedure for the draw on Monday morning.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know:"
