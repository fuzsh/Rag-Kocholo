        "text": "Football Ground Map > Articles > The 91 Biggest Football Stadiums in Europe\n\nEurope has a long and illustrious association with the beautiful game. It's where the sport of football was invented, has hosted the most World Cups and its nations have also won the most World Cups.\n\nThe major European leagues are broadcast around the globe and some of the world's finest football stadiums are found on the continent.\n\nHere we'll run through the 91 largest stadiums in Europe, each with a capacity of over 40,000. All of the stadiums below can be found on our exclusive European Football Stadiums Poster, which allows you to tick off the grounds you have visited from all across Europe. It's the perfect gift for European groundhoppers and a great educational resource for kids too.\n\nThe list is broken up into sections, by capacity:\n\nGrounds with a capacity of 40,000+\n\nGrounds with a capacity of 50,000+\n\nGrounds with a capacity of 60,000+\n\nGrounds with a capacity of 70,000+\n\nGrounds with a capacity of 80,000+\n\nYou can also view the complete list of largest stadiums in Europe.\n\nSo, without further ado, let's get started on our run down of the biggest football stadiums in Europe...\n\nThe 91 biggest stadiums in Europe\n\n91. RCDE Stadium (Espanyol)\n\n40,000 capacity - Barcelona, Spain\n\nWe start our list of the largest grounds in Europe in the beautiful city of Barcelona. Also known as the Estadi Cornella-El Prat, Espanyol's RCDE Stadium was opened in 2009 at a cost of €60m.\n\nThe ground is located around 5 miles west of the city centre and is considerably smaller than Espanyol's previous home, the 60,000 capacity Estadio Olimpic Lluis Companys where they played between 1997 and 2009.\n\nEstadi Cornella-El Prat (RCDE Stadium) 40,000 capacity • 935 visits logged •\n\n90. Metalist Stadium (Metalist Kharkiv)\n\n40,003 capacity - Kharkiv, Ukraine\n\nOriginally opened in 1926 as Tractor Stadium, the ground is built on the site of an old cemetery which was used in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nIt hosted all 3 of the Netherlands' disastrous Euro 2012 campaign, with the Dutch losing to Denmark, Germany and Portugal on their way to finishing bottom of group B.\n\nThe stadium was shared with Shakhtar Donetsk between 2017 and 2020, due to the War in Donbass.\n\nOblasny SportKomplex Metalist 40,003 capacity • 270 visits logged •\n\n89. Senol Gunes Stadium (Trabzonspor)\n\n40,782 capacity - Trabzon, Turkey\n\nFirst opened in 2016 at a cost of around £25m, the Senol Gunes Stadium is named after former goalkeeper and manager Senol Gunes who played over 400 games for the club.\n\nThe stadium forms the centerpiece of a large sports complex which also contains a number of training pitches. It is located right next to the coast on land reclaimed from the sea around 5 miles west of the city centre.\n\nSenol Gunes Stadium 40,782 capacity • 16 visits logged\n\n88. Stamford Bridge (Chelsea)\n\n40,834 capacity - London, England\n\nOpened in 1877, Stamford Bridge was originally used by London Athletics Club until Chelsea were formed in 1905. The ground was originally offered as a new home to Fulham, but they turned it down. The landowners then decided to create their own football team and Chelsea FC was born.\n\nFun fact: in 1984, an electric fence was erected around the edge of the stands in an effort to combat hooliganism. It was never turned on and dismantled at the council's request.\n\nFun fact #2: the original terraces used material excavated from building the nearby Piccadilly Line for the London Underground.\n\nStamford Bridge 40,834 capacity • 69,754 visits logged •\n\n87. Vodafone Park (Besiktas)\n\n41,188 capacity - Istanbul, Turkey\n\nBesiktas' new Vodafone Park was opened in 2016 at a cost of €110m. It is built on the site of the former Inonu Stadium which was first opened in 1947 and was also home to Galatasaray and Fenerbahce.\n\nIn December 2016, 46 people were killed and 136 injured after 2 bombs exploded after Besiktas' Super League match with Bursaspor.\n\nThe stadium hosted the all-English 2019 UEFA Super Cup where Liverpool beat Chelsea on penalties. The match made history for being the first men's European match to be refereed a female ref.\n\nFun fact: the stadium was originally known as Vodafone Arena, but was changed to Vodafone Park in 2017 after the Turkish President ordered teams to stop using the term \"arena\", due to him disliking the word.\n\nVodafone Park 41,188 capacity • 175 visits logged •\n\n86. Allianz Stadium (Juventus)\n\n41,507 capacity - Turin, Italy\n\nOpened in 2011 at a cost of €155m, the Allianz Stadium is built on the site of the former Stadio delle Alpi which Juventus shared with rivals Torino.\n\nThe Stadio delle Alpi was notoriously unpopular with Juve fans due to its size and running track around the perimeter - both of which contributed towards a poor experience for fans.\n\nThe new stadium was built to bring fans much closer to the action and has been well received by supporters. It hosted the 2014 Europa League final where Sevilla beat Benfica on penalties, and is due to host the Women's Champions League final in 2022.\n\nFun fact: the stadium's first match was a friendly against Notts County - the world's oldest professional football club and the team which Juventus takes its famous black and white stripes from.\n\nAllianz Stadium (Juventus Stadium) 41,507 capacity • 1,174 visits logged •\n\n85. Stadion Energa Gdansk (Lechia Gdansk)\n\n41,620 capacity - Gdansk, Poland\n\nPreviously known as the Baltic Arena, Stadion Energa Gdansk was first opened in 2011 at a cost of €200m.\n\nThe stadium facade is coloured amber, designed to reflect the local area's history for producing the gemstone. The original seating designs were various tones of yellow and orange to further enhance the theme. However, the architects faced a backlash from Lechia fans as these are the colours of their local rivals Arka Gdynia. The seats inside the stadium were changed to Lechia's traditional colour of green.\n\nThe stadium was built for Euro 2012, where it hosted 4 matches, including all of Spain's group games and Germany's 4-2 victory over Greece in the quarter final.\n\nIt was scheduled to host the 2020 Europa League final, but will now host the 2021 event, due to the Covid 19 pandemic.\n\nStadion Energa Gdansk 41,620 capacity • 283 visits logged •\n\n84. Stade Geoffroy-Guichard (Saint-Etienne)\n\n41,965 capacity - Saint-Etienne, France\n\nNicknamed \"the cauldron\" and \"green hell\", the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard was first opened in 1931. It is named after the founder of retail business Casino Group, which originally created the club for its workers.\n\nThe stadium hosted 2 matches at Euro 84 and 6 games at the 1998 World Cup including England's infamous penalty shoot out defeat to Argentina - including \"that\" goal from Michael Owen and \"that\" red card for David Beckham.\n\nMore recently, it also held 4 matches at Euro 2016, including England's 0-0 draw with Slovakia and Poland's penalty shoot out victory over Switzerland in the round of 16.\n\nFun fact: Saint Etienne's first match at the stadium was a 9-1 defeat to AS Cannes.\n\nStade Geoffroy-Guichard 41,965 capacity • 1,994 visits logged •\n\n83. Konya Buyuksehir Stadium (Konyaspor)\n\n42,000 capacity - Konya, Turkey\n\nBuilt in 2014, the stadium is part of a much larger project 5 miles north of the city centre which includes a sports complex, recreation areas and housing.\n\nThe roof of the stadium is designed to resemble the wheels of a bike, a nod to Konya's reputation as a cycling city.\n\nThe stadium is also used by the Turkish national team and its record attendance was set in 2015 when they faced the Netherlands in front of 41,007 fans.\n\nKonya Buyuksehir Stadium 42,000 capacity • 16 visits logged\n\n82. Weserstadion (Werder Bremen)\n\n42,100 capacity - Bremen, Germany\n\nWerder Bremen have been using the Weserstadion since it was opened in 1947. The stadium is located on the banks of the river Weser, around half a mile from the city centre.\n\nThe ground was completely rebuilt between 2008 and 2011 with a new facade, new roof and two stands completely demolished and rebuilt closer to the pitch. The cost of these renovations was €77m.\n\nWeserstadion 42,100 capacity • 2,294 visits logged •\n\n81. Matmut Atlantique (Bordeaux)\n\n42,115 capacity - Bordeaux, France\n\nOfficially known as the Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux, the stadium opened in 2015 at a cost of €183m.\n\nIt was built for Euro 2016 where it hosted 6 matches including Germany's penalty shootout victory over Italy in the quarter finals.\n\nIn 2018, it hosted the French League Cup final where PSG beat Monaco 3-0. It is also one of the six venues which will host football at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nNouveau Stade de Bordeaux (Matmut Atlantique) 42,115 capacity • 802 visits logged •\n\n80. Red Bull Arena (RB Leipzig)\n\n42,558 capacity - Leipzig, Germany\n\nRed Bull Arena is the largest stadium in East Germany. The current ground was opened in 2004 and is built on the site of the original Zentralstadion which was opened in 1956 - at that time, it was the largest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 100,000.\n\nIt hosted 5 matches at the 2006 World Cup including Argentina's 2-1 extra time victory over Mexico in the round of 16.\n\nThe club's recent success on the pitch has led to talks of expanding the stadium to over 54,000 in the next couple of years.\n\nRB Arena 42,558 capacity • 918 visits logged •\n\n79. Villa Park (Aston Villa)\n\n42,785 capacity - Birmingham, England\n\nVilla Park has been Aston Villa's home since they were formed in 1897. The famous old ground has hosted 55 FA Cup semi-finals - more than any other club ground in the country.\n\nThe original stadium cost £17,000 to construct - the equivalent of £25m in today's money.

Nearby Leazes Park had been put forward as a possible site, but plans were dropped due to the small size and housing around the ground.\n\nThe stadium was used in the film Goal! The Dream Begins.\n\nHistorically, the site was a place where executions took place. The last public hanging took place in 1844.\n\nSt James' Park 52,354 capacity • 63,631 visits logged •\n\n43. Rajko Mitic Stadium (Red Star Belgrade)\n\n53,000 capacity - Belgrade, Serbia\n\nThe first stadium on the site originally opened in 1927. The version we see today was rebuilt and opened in 1963 as Red Star Stadium. It is by far the largest stadium in Serbia - not far off double the size of the second largest (Partizan Stadium) which is located just a couple of hundred yards away.\n\nIt is known locally as the \"European Maracana\" after the famous stadium in Brazil. The highest official attendance was 108,000, set for a Belgrade derby vs Partizan in the new stadium's opening year. However, many reports suggest this record was passed in the 1975 Cup Winners' Cup semi final when an estimated 110,000 saw the 2-2 draw vs Hungarian side Ferencvaros.\n\nThe stadium was renamed in 2014 after club legend Rajko Mitic who played over 550 games for Red Star.\n\nThe ground has hosted 2 major finals - the 1973 European Cup final where Ajax beat Juventus 1-0 and the Euro 1976 final where Czechoslovakia beat West Germany on penalties. At that time only 4 teams contested the finals. It was the first time the Euros had been decided on penalties.\n\nIn 2012, the club announced plans to completely rebuild the ground into a modern 50,000 capacity superstadium. The project is expected to cost up to €600m, if it goes ahead.\n\nRajko Mitic Stadium 53,000 capacity • 763 visits logged •\n\n42. San Mames (Athletic Bilbao)\n\n53,289 capacity - Bilbao, Spain\n\nBuilt in 2013, new San Mames is the largest stadium in the Basque region of Spain. The €211m ground was initially opened as a 3-sided 35,000 capacity stadium, with the 4th side opening a year later.\n\nThis was due to it being constructed right next to the old San Mames, built in a similar way to the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The stadium's roof was extended in 2016 after complaints that some seats were getting rained on.\n\nThe San Mames will host all 3 of Spain's group games at Euro 2021 and one round of 16 knockout match.\n\nThe stadium was also the venue for a Copa de la Reina match between Athletic Bilbao and Atletico Madrid in 2019 - the attendance of 48,121 set a record for a women's match in Spain.\n\nSan Mames 53,289 capacity • 1,301 visits logged •\n\n41. Borussia-Park (Borussia Monchengladbach)\n\n54,057 capacity - Monchengladbach, Germany\n\nBorussia Park was first opened in 2004 as a replacement for Monchengladbach's old Bokelbergstadion. The €85m stadium makes use of 16,000 standing places to take the overall capacity to just over 54,000. Internationals are limited to just over 46,000 due to UEFA's rules on standing for national games.\n\nDespite its size, the stadium missed out on hosting the 2006 World Cup. However, it did host 3 matches at the 2011 Women's World Cup including USA's 3-1 semi final victory over France.\n\nBorussia-Park 54,057 capacity • 2,133 visits logged •\n\n40. Anfield (Liverpool)\n\n54,074 capacity - Liverpool, England\n\nUndoubtedly one of the most famous and recognisable stadiums in world football, Anfield has been Liverpol's home ground since they were formed in 1982.\n\nHowever, in 2002 Anfield's future hung in the balance as the club announced plans for a new 60,000 stadium at Stanley Park. These plans were shelved in 2010 by the new owners who decided to redevelop Anfield instead.\n\nThose redevelopment plans are still ongoing, with the Anfield Road end due to be rebuilt soon. This latest modification will take the stadium's capacity up to 61,000.>\n\nFun fact: Whilst Anfield has been home to Liverpool since they were formed in 1892, it was originally home to arch rivals Everton. The Toffees played at Anfield for 7 years (from 1884-1891) before they moved to Goodison after a dispute with the club president.\n\nAnfield 54,074 capacity • 79,676 visits logged •\n\n39. Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena (Dinamo Tbilisi)\n\n54,139 capacity - Tbilisi, Georgia\n\nDinamo Stadium is the biggest football ground in Georgia, almost twice as big as the second largest, Lokomotivi Stadium which is also found in the capital Tbilisi.\n\nThe current stadium was opened in 1976 with a capacity of almost 75,000. Although the stadium's record attendance is an unconfirmed 110,000 for Dinamo's 3-0 European Cup victory over Liverpool in 1979.\n\nThe ground hosted the all-Spanish 2015 Super Cup where Barcelona beat Sevilla 5-4 after extra time. It also plays host to the Georgian national football and rugby teams.\n\nFun fact: Cardiff City were the visitors for the stadium's first ever game with Dinamo winning the match 3-0.\n\nBoris Paichadze Dinamo Arena 54,139 capacity • 352 visits logged •\n\n38. Merkur Spiel-Arena (Fortuna Dusseldorf)\n\n54,600 capacity - Dusseldorf, Germany\n\nOpened in 2004 at a cost of €240m with an original capacity of 51,500. It was extended to the current 54,600 in 2010 when some of the seating areas were converted into safe standing.\n\nDespite its capacity, the stadium wasn't used for the 2006 World Cup - which underlines how many superstadiums there are in Germany.\n\nIt has, however, hosted international friendlies for Germany and two Portugal matches, beating Saudi Arabia and losing to Greece.\n\nAway from football it played as the home stadium for the Rhein Fire NFL Europe team until they folded in 2007. It has also hosted boxing events, with heavyweight superstar Wladimir Klitschko fighting at the stadium on several occasions.\n\nThe stadium's retractable roof makes it a popular music venue, with the ground hosting many concerts as well as the Eurovision Song Contest in 2011.\n\nMerkur-Spiel Arena 54,600 capacity • 1,712 visits logged •\n\n37. Stadio San Paolo (Napoli)\n\n54,726 capacity - Naples, Italy\n\nThe Stadio San Paolo was first opened in 1959 and has been Napoli's home over since.\n\nThe stadium hosted 5 matches at the 1990 World Cup, including Argentina's penalty shootout victory over Italy in the semi finals.\n\nThe Stadio San Paolo would have appeared much higher on our list if it weren't for modernisation work which took place for the 2019 Summer Universiade athletics tournament which took the capacity down from over 60,000 to the current 54,726.\n\nFun fact: Naples City council requested permission from the Italian government to name the stadium after Maradonna who helped Napoli win the Serie A title in 1987 and 1990. The Italian government refused as Italian law dictates that a public building can not be named after someone who had been dead for less than 10 years.\n\nStadio Diego Armando Maradona 54,726 capacity • 1,553 visits logged •\n\n36. Johan Cruyff Arena (Ajax)\n\n54,990 capacity - Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\nFormerly known as the Amsterdam Arena, the Johan Cruyff Arena is now named after the Ajax legend who passed away in 2016.\n\nThe stadium was opened in 1996 at a cost of €140m. A new stadium for Ajax has been planned for some time, but it could have looked much different to what we see today, had the city of Amsterdam won the rights to host the 1996 Olympic Games.\n\nAs well as being Ajax's permanent home, the retractable roof stadium also hosts most of the Netherlands national team's matches and will host all 3 of their group games at Euro 2021 as well as a round of 16 knockout match.\n\nThe Amsterdam Arena hosted 5 matches at Euro 2000 including the co-hosts' penalty shoot-out defeat to Italy in the semi finals.\n\nThe Amsterdam Arena was also the venue for one Champions League final and one Europa League final. Real Madrid beat Juventus 1-0 in the 1998 Champions League final and Chelsea beat Benfica 2-1 thanks to an injury time winner from Branislav Ivanovic in 2013.\n\nThe stadium was also the home ground for the Amsterdam Admirals American football team until they folded in 2007. They played in front of an average attendance of around 15,000 fans.\n\nJohan Cruyff Arena (Amsterdam Arena) 54,990 capacity • 11,543 visits logged •\n\n35. Mestalla (Valencia)\n\n55,000 capacity - Valencia, Spain\n\nThe Mestalla stadium was first opened in 1923 with an original capacity of just 17,000. After being used as a concentration camp in the Spanish Civil War, it was heavily renovated in the 1950s with the capacity dramatically increased to 60,000.\n\nIn 1969 its name was changed to the Estadio Luis Casanova after the club's president. The name was changed back to Mestalla in 1994.\n\nThe stadium has hosted 10 Copa del Rey finals. It also hosted all 3 Spanish group games in the 1982 World Cup as the hosts struggled with a 1-1 draw against Honduras and 1-0 defeat to Northern Ireland.\n\nIt was also the venue for 8 matches at 1992 Barcelona Olympics, including Spain's semi final victory over Ghana.\n\nThe famous old ground's days may be numbered though, with the club currently constructing a new stadium, nicknamed the Nou Mestalla. Funding has been an issue though, with construction halted for the best part of a decade.\n\nMestalla 55,000 capacity • 4,650 visits logged •\n\n34. Etihad Stadium (Manchester City)\n\n55,097 capacity - Manchester, England\n\nOriginally known as the City of Manchester Stadium, the Etihad was first built as a 41,000 seater stadium for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.

Stadio San Nicola (Bari)\n\n58,270 capacity - Bari, Italy\n\nIf we asked people to name the biggest stadiums in Italy, not many people would put Bari's Stadio San Nicola 3rd.\n\nBuilt for the 1990 World Cup, it hosted 5 matches including the 3rd place play off match where Italy beat England 2-1.\n\nIt was also the venue for the 1991 European Cup final where Red Star Belgrade beat Marseille on penalties.\n\nIf you're thinking of visiting the Stadio San Nicola, getting a ticket should be easy - the club are currently languishing in the lower leagues of Italian regional football.\n\nStadio San Nicola 58,270 capacity • 585 visits logged •\n\n29. Groupama Stadium (Lyon)\n\n59,186 capacity - Lyon, France\n\nLyon's Groupama Stadium is also known as the Parc Olympique Lyonnaise.

London Stadium (West Ham United)\n\n60,000 capacity - London, England\n\nThe London Stadium was originally built in 2012 for the London Olympic Games at a cost of £468m. The 80,000 seater stadium was used as the main venue for the track and field events as well as hosting the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nThe original plans after the Games were to turn it into a 25,000 seater athletics venue, but this was changed when West Ham and Spurs expressed their interest in becoming tenants. After much deliberation, controversy and several legal challenges, West Ham were awarded a 99 year lease.\n\nA further £274m was spent converting it to a football stadium, which the Hammers moved into in 2016. This caused controversy as well, with many West Ham fans unhappy at leaving Upton Park for a stadium whose seats are so far away from the pitch.\n\nThe full sporting capacity is actually 66,000, however West Ham's lease only allows a reduced capacity of 60,000 to attend. The club are planning on increasing the terms of the lease to 63,000 and then 66,000 to make it the largest club ground in London.\n\nLondon Stadium can also be configured for use by other sports. It is still used for athletics meets, has hosted rugby matches and was also the venue for the first European MLB game in 2019 when Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees played a 2 game series.\n\nLondon Stadium (Olympic Stadium) 62,500 capacity • 11,954 visits logged •\n\n27.

It has also hosted 20 Scotland internationals - the most of any stadium other than Hampden.\n\nIf things had been a little different, Celtic Park may no longer be standing. Back in 1993, the club was granted planning permission for a new 52,000 seater £100m stadium at Cambuslang to the south of Parkhead. A lack of funds and change of ownership at Celtic led to the being cancelled.\n\nCeltic Park 60,411 capacity • 15,692 visits logged •\n\n26. Mercedes-Benz Arena (VfB Stuttgart)\n\n60,441 capacity - Stuttgart, Germany\n\nStuttgart's Mercedes-Benz Arena has been known under a number of names. It was originally opened in 1933 as the Adolf Hitler Kampfbahn - understandably it was renamed after World War II, first as Century Stadium, followed by Neckarstadion, Gottlieb Daimler Stadion and then finally the Mercedes-Benz Arena. The last 2 names related to the Mercedes-Benz car company whose headquarters are located nearby.\n\nThe record attendance of 97,533 was set for a match between West Germany and Switzerland in 1950 - the first international match in Germany after the Second World War.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Arena also hosted the first Germany international match after reunification in 1990, also against Switzerland.\n\nAs well as football, the stadium used to host other sports including athletics and the Eurobowl (American football), before it was converted to a football only stadium in 2008.

Emirates Stadium (Arsenal)\n\n60,704 capacity - London, England\n\nOpened in 2006, Arsenal's new Emirates Stadium took 2 years to build at a cost of £390m - which looks a steal when you consider that Spurs' new stadium cost over £1bn.\n\nThe club had been looking to move away from Highbury for a number of years after capacity was cut in the mid 1990s.\n\nIn 1998, the club put forward an official bid to buy Wembley Stadium, before purchasing some land close to Highbury and developing the new stadium just after the turn of the Century.\n\nThe Brazil national team has adopted the Emirates at their unofficial \"home\" ground in the UK, having played 8 matches there, winning 7.

Originally known as the Estadio de la Exposicion, the opening match saw Spain beat rivals Portugal 5-0.\n\nThe stadium was used as a military base during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) and was rebuilt and renamed Estadio Municipal Heliopolis shortly after.\n\nThe stadium was used for 2 group games in the 1982 World Cup including Brazil's 4-1 victory over Scotland. The ground also regularly hosted Spanish national team matches in the 1980s and 1990s.

Fans were understandably not happy at the stadium until the track was removed and replaced with seats closer to the pitch in 1985.\n\nIt is one of the few stadiums on this list where the capacity has increased over recent years, with the current figure of 67,394 the biggest the stadium has ever been.\n\nStade Velodrome 67,394 capacity • 4,418 visits logged •\n\n18. Gazprom Arena (Zenit St Petersburg)\n\n67,800 capacity - St Petersburg, Russia\n\nThe Krestovsky Stadium is also known as the Gazprom Arena, due to a sponsorship agreement with the multinational energy provider, who are based in St Petersburg.\n\nThe stadium cost 43 billion Russian Rubles (around £500m) and was opened in 2017 for Confederations Cup, where it was known as the St Petersburg Stadium, due to FIFA's restriction on sponsorship names.\n\nIt hosted 7 games at the 2018 World Cup including France's semi final victory over Belgium and Belgium's subsequent 3rd place play off victory over England.\n\n2021 will be a big year for the stadium when it is due to host 4 games at Euro 2020 including one of the quarter finals.

Estadio Wanda Metropolitano (Atletico Madrid)\n\n68,456 capacity - Madrid, Spain\n\nAtletico Madrid's Wanda Metropolitano is the third largest stadium in Spain and the second largest in the capital Madrid.\n\nAlthough Atletico have only used it for a couple of years, a stadium has existed on the site since 1994 when the city of Madrid failed in a bid to host the 1997 World Athletics Championship. The football club took control of the site after the city's bid to host the 2016 Olympics was also unsuccessful.\n\nThe original 20,000 capacity stadium was torn down and rebuilt into the 68,000 capacity stadium we see today. The cost of the project was €240m, which is pretty cheap for the size of the stadium.\n\nAs well as being Atletico's new home, the ground also hosted the 2018 Copa Del Rey final in which Andreas Iniesta made his final appearance for Barcelona. A year later it hosted the 2019 all-English Champions League final between Liverpool and Spurs.\n\nFun fact: the stadium holds the world record attendance for a women's club match, set in 2019 when 60,739 saw Atletico Madrid Women play Barcelona Women.\n\nEstadio Wanda Metropolitano 68,456 capacity • 1,079 visits logged •\n\n16.

NSC Olimpiyskiy (Dynamo Kiev)\n\n70,050 capacity - Kiev, Ukraine\n\nOpened in 1923, the Olimpiyskiy Stadium plays host occasional matches for both Dynamo Kiev and the Ukraine national team, with Dynamo mainly using the ground for their Champions League matches (their usual ground being the much smaller Valeriy Lobanovski Dynamo Stadium).\n\nWhilst Ukraine may have never hosted the Olympics, the ground was used for 7 football matches in the 1980 Olympics Games, back when it was part of the Soviet Union.\n\nMore recently, the stadium also hosted 5 matches at Euro 2012 including Spain's 4-0 victory of Italy in the final.\n\nThe stadium's record attendance of 102,000 was set in a European Cup game when Dynamo Kiev played Bayern Munich in 1977.\n\nNSK Olimpiyskiy 70,050 capacity • 1,362 visits logged •\n\n13. Stadio Olimpico (Roma, Lazio)\n\n70,634 capacity - Rome, Italy\n\nFirst opened in 1932 as the Stadio dei Cipressi, the current Stadio Olimpico has been home to both Lazio and Roma since 1953.\n\nIt wasn't known as the Stadio Olimpico until the 1960 Olympics where it hosted the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nThe stadium was closed in the late 1980s where it was entirely demolished and rebuilt in time for the 1990 World Cup. It hosted 5 matches at the tournament including the final where West Germany beat Argentina 1-0.\n\nThe stadium was also used for Euro 1980, hosting several matches including West Germany's 2-1 victory over Belgium in the final.\n\nIt has also hosted 4 European cup finals, including 2 wins for Liverpool in 1977 and 1984. The 1984 triumph was against stadium tenants Roma - Liverpool won 4-2 on penalties.\n\nStadio Olimpico 70,634 capacity • 8,294 visits logged •\n\n12. Millennium Stadium (Wales)\n\n73,931 capacity - Cardiff, Wales\n\nCardiff's Millennium Stadium was opened in 1999, originally built for rugby World Cup hosting 7 matches including the final.\n\nDespite its focus as a rugby venue, the stadium has hosted numerous football events, particularly in the early 2000s when it served as home for the Welsh national team and most of English club football's major matches whilst Wembley Stadium was being rebuilt. Matches played there include FA Cup finals, League Cup finals and Play-Off finals.\n\nThe £121m stadium was also used as one of 6 venues for football at 2012 Olympics and hosted the 2017 Champions League final where Real Madrid beat Juventus 4-1.\n\nThe Millennium Stadium (Principality Stadium) 73,931 capacity • 46,282 visits logged •\n\n11. Olympiastadion (Hertha Berlin)\n\n74,475 capacity - Berlin, Germany\n\nOne of the oldest grounds on the list, the Olympiastadion in Berlin was built for the 1936 Olympic Games and has been home to Hertha Berlin since 1963.\n\nIts column design and 1930s architecture make it structurally different to most stadiums, although redevelopment work in the early 2000s gives it a very modern feel.\n\nThe stadium is the largest all-seater arena in Germany and capacity can be expanded to over 76,000 with the addition of a temporary stand over the Marathon Arch. This temporary seating was last used for a Hertha v Bayern Munich game in 2014.\n\nAs well as the 1936 Olympics, the stadium has hosted a number of other events including 3 matches at the 1974 World Cup and 6 games at the 2006 World Cup, including the final where Italy beat France on penalties.\n\nIt is also the home of the German Cup final, played host to the 2011 Women's World Cup final and the 2009 World Athletics Championship where Usain Bolt broke both the 100m and 200m world records.\n\nFun fact: the 2011 Women's World Cup final was better attended than the 2006 Men's final (73,680 vs 69,000).\n\nOlympiastadion Berlin 74,475 capacity • 7,330 visits logged •\n\n10. Old Trafford (Manchester United)\n\n74,879 capacity - Manchester, England\n\nDesigned by renowned architect Archibald Leitch, Old Trafford has been Manchester United's home since it was opened in 1910. With a current capacity of 74,879 it is the largest club ground in England and 2nd largest in the UK.\n\nWhilst the club has played at the \"Theatre of Dreams\" since 1910, Man Utd did spend the majority of the 1940s at Maine Road after Old Trafford was extensively bombed during the Second World War.\n\nThe stadium has hosted many top matches including games from the 1966 World Cup, Euro 96, the 2012 Olympic Games and the 2003 Champions League final. It has also hosted two Rugby League World Cup finals.\n\nFun fact: the largest attendance ever recorded at Old Trafford did not feature Man United - a crowd of 76,962 watched Wolves play Grimsby in an FA Cup semi-final in 1939. Despite averaging attendances in the mid-70,000s, Man Utd have never reached this figure.\n\nOld Trafford 74,879 capacity • 102,853 visits logged •\n\n9. Allianz Arena (Bayern Munich)\n\n75,024 capacity - Munich, Germany\n\nThe Allianz Arena was first opened in 2005, as one of the new stadiums constructed for the 2006 World Cup. It hosted 6 matches at the finals including 2 Germany matches and France's 1-0 victory over Portugal in the semi final.\n\nBuilt at a cost of €340m, it originally served as the home to both Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich, until the latter left and returned to their old stadium in 2017.\n\nBucking the modern trend, the Allianz Arena is one of the few stadiums which has actually grown in capacity - from 66,000 when it first opened to the current 75,000.\n\nFun fact: it is the first stadium in the world to feature a full colour changing exterior. The stadium emits so much light that in a clear night, it can be seen in the Austrian mountains - some 50 miles away.\n\nAllianz Arena 75,024 capacity • 6,258 visits logged •\n\n8. Ataturk Olympic Stadium (Turkey)\n\n75,145 capacity - Istanbul, Turkey\n\nThe Ataturk Olympic Stadium is the largest stadium in Turkey, located on the outskirts of the capital Istanbul. It was opened in 2002 at a cost of around £100m. The name \"Olympic Stadium\" is from the country's failed bid to host the 2008 Olympic Games.\n\nThe capacity at opening was 80,597, but this has been gradually reduced to the current number of 75,145. The record attendance of 79,414 was set in 2002 when Galatasary hosted Greek side Olympiacos.\n\nThe stadium is currently home to the Turkish national team, but has been used by several local club sides over the years including Galatasaray, Istanbul Basaksehir, Kesimpasa and Besiktas.\n\nAtaturk Olympiyat Stadyumu 75,145 capacity • 866 visits logged •\n\n7. San Siro (Milan, Internazionale)\n\n75,923 capacity - Milan, Italy\n\nThe largest shared ground in Europe is used by Italian giants Inter and AC Milan. It was originally built in 1926 and owned by AC until 1935 when it was sold to the Municipality of Milan, with Inter moving into the stadium in 1947.\n\nThe stadium's name was changed to the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in 1980. He won 2 World Cups with Italy and played for both teams in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.\n\nThe San Siro has hosted numerous prestigious matches including games at the 1934 World Cup, 1990 World Cup, Euro 1968, Euro 1980 and 4 European Cup finals.\n\nHowever, despite its heritage, the city of Milan is looking to build a new stadium and the Giuseppe Meazza's days are numbered. On the plus side, if you want to go, neither side currently gets close to selling out, so tickets are easy to come by.\n\nFun fact: the opening game in 1926 saw Inter beat Milan 6-3. This was the time when it was AC's stadium, with Inter still playing across town.\n\nSan Siro (Stadio Giuseppe Meazza) 75,923 capacity • 12,837 visits logged •\n\nStadiums over 80,000\n\n6. Luzhniki Stadium (Russia)\n\n81,000 capacity - Moscow, Russia\n\nFirst opened in 1956 as the Central Lenin Stadium, the Luzhniki is the largest stadium in Russia. It's name roughly translates as \"the meadows\" thanks to its location close to the banks of the winding Moskva River.\n\nThe stadium has a rich sporting history, having hosted a UEFA Cup and Champions League final as well as the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1980 Olympic Games and 7 matches at the 2018 World Cup, including the final.\n\nIn the past it has served as temporary home to 3 of Moscow's big teams with CSKA, Spartak and Torpedo all having used the stadium. At present, it is home to the only the Russian national team and domestic cup finals.\n\nIn October 1982, the stadium was the site of the Luzhniki Disaster, where 66 people were killed in a stampede at the UEFA Cup tie between Spartak Moscow and Dutch side HFC Haarlem.\n\nThe stadium's all-time record attendance of 102,538 was set in October 1963 when the Soviet Union hosted Italy.\n\nLuzhniki Stadium 81,006 capacity • 847 visits logged •\n\n5. Santiago Bernabeu (Real Madrid)\n\n81,044 capacity - Madrid, Spain\n\nReal Madrid's Estadio Santiago Bernabeu is the largest in the Spanish capital, but only the second largest in Spain, with a capacity of 81,044.\n\nNamed after former player, manager and club president, that stadium was opened in 1947 originally as Estadio Real Madrid Club de Futbol. The stadium was opened with a friendly against Portuguese minnows Os Belenenses. The record attendance of 129,690 was set in 1956 for a European Cup tie against Milan.\n\nThe Bernabeu has hosted many prestigious matches including 4 European Cup finals, 2 games for Euro 1964 and 4 games at the 1982 World Cup, including the final. It also hosted the 2nd leg of the 2018 Copa Libertadores final (the South American Champions League) after crowd trouble forced the game to be played on another continent. River Plate beat fierce rivals Boca Juniors 5-3 on aggregate, after extra time.\n\nThe stadium is currently undergoing extensive reconstruction work with the club spending over €500m modernising the stadium, including totally changing the facade and introducing a retractable roof. Capacity will remain unchanged, but with Real averaging less than 70,000 in recent years, they probably don't need any extra seats.\n\nSantiago Bernabeu 81,044 capacity • 11,140 visits logged •\n\n4. Stade de France (France)\n\n81,338 capacity - Paris, France\n\nWith a capacity of over 80,000, the Stade de France is the largest stadium in France. Located just north of Paris city centre, the stadium was built for the 1998 World Cup and replaced PSG's Parc des Princes as the home stadium of the French National team.\n\nIt opened in January 1998, with French legend Zinedine Zidane scoring the first goal at the ground. 6 months later, France won the World Cup trophy, beating Brazil to claim their first ever title. 18 years later, France made the final of Euro 2016, but lost against Portugal.\n\nBuilt at a cost of €290m, the stadium also serves as the home of the French rugby union team and has occasionally hosted matches for local sides Stade Francais and Racing 92. The city's love affair with egg chasing is a constant theme in our Paris football stadium guide.\n\nIn 2015, the stadium was the focus of a terrorist attack during a friendly match against Germany. The attacker attempted to gain entry to the stadium, but was held off by security and detonated an explosive outside. Although the detonation was heard inside the ground, fans thought it was a firecracker and the match continued.\n\nStade de France 80,698 capacity • 7,373 visits logged •\n\n3. Signal Iduna Park (Borussia Dortmund)\n\n81,365 capacity - Dortmund, Germany\n\nGermany's biggest stadium is one that's on many people's bucket list. Traditionally known as Westfalenstadion (Signal Iduna is a German financial services company), the stadium can hold 81,365 fans including the famous \"yellow wall\" terrace behind the goal - which is the biggest standing terrace in Europe.\n\nThe ground was originally built for the 1974 World Cup where it hosted 4 matches. It was also used for the 2006 World Cup, hosting 6 games, including Germany's semi-final defeat to Italy.\n\nFun fact: In a different world, the stadium may have never been built - Dortmund was not on the original list of host cities for the 1974 World Cup and only stepped in and built a new stadium when Cologne was forced to withdraw.\n\nWestfalenstadion (Signal Iduna Park) 81,359 capacity • 6,645 visits logged •\n\n2. Wembley Stadium (England)\n\n90,000 capacity - London, England\n\nThe new Wembley Stadium was opened back in 2007 at a cost of almost £800m. It sits on the site of the old stadium, with its distinctive arch replacing the old twin towers.\n\nAs well as being the home of the England national football team, it was also the home ground of Tottenham Hotspur between 2017 and 2019 whilst their new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was being built. During this time, it set the record for the largest ever Premier League attendance when 83,222 saw Spurs beat local rivals Arsenal 1-0.\n\nThe highest ever football attendance was set in the 2008 FA Cup final when 89,874 saw Portsmouth beat Cardiff 1-0. That's nowhere near the old Wembley Stadium though whose record was set in the very first event - the 1923 FA Cup final when an official figure of 126,047, although estimates put the unofficial figure closer to 300,000. If true, this would have been the largest football attendance ever recorded.\n\nWembley Stadium 90,000 capacity • 39,307 visits logged •\n\n1. Nou Camp (Barcelona)\n\n99,354 capacity - Barcelona, Spain\n\nAs well as being the biggest ground in Europe, the Camp Nou is arguably the most famous as well as the most visited overseas ground by members of footballgroundmap.com. Add to that the fact that it is the 3rd biggest football stadium in the world, and it's obvious to see why it is seen by many as the jewel in Europe's crown.\n\nLocated in the beautiful city of Barcelona, the stadium has been home to FC Barcelona since 1957. It has hosted many prestigious matches including two European Cup finals, two UEFA Cup Winners' Cup finals, five matches at the 1982 World Cup and the football final of the 1982 Olympic Games.\n\nAt its peak, the stadium could hold over 120,000 spectators, with the record attendance set as recently as 1986 when Barca hosted Juventus in a European Cup quarter final.\n\nQuirky fact: the ground was officially called the Estadi del FC Barcelona until the year 2000, when a poll of the club's fans saw 68% in favour of changing it to the popular nickname of \"Camp Nou\".\n\nThere are plans to expand the capacity to 105,000, with work due to be completed by 2024. Don't be surprised if it isn't though - the plans have been in the works since 2007!\n\nIf you're planning a trip to the Nou Camp, make sure you check out our groundhopping guide to Barcelona - whilst the Camp Nou might be the biggest, it's certainly not the only ground worth visiting in the region.\n\nNou Camp 99,354 capacity • 27,764 visits logged •\n\nThe complete list of Europe's biggest football stadiums\n\nA complete list of the 91 biggest football stadiums in Europe, as found on our European Football Stadium poster.\n\nAbout the Author: Rob Clarkson\n\nRob is the owner of footballgroundmap.com.
