        "text": "I've seen better match schedules, to be honest.\n\nAs has become normal, there are too many rest days. Obviously teams don't all need to rest on the same days, there should be matches every day from the opener to the QFs. The QFs should run over four days, not two.\n\nKick-off times won't be announced until after the draw. That shows the usual disregard for fans. For sure there are a lot of times this won't matter much, but if you're aiming to arrive in Germany on a match day or relocate from one city to another this can seriously stuff up your planning.\n\nTo be fair though, it will help fans that are following their teams that the group phase has been regionalised a bit. Groups A C E are playing their games in the South - Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Cologne (which is further North but with the best rail links) plus an odd game in each of Gelsenkirchen and Dusseldorf. Groups B D F are in the North - Hamburg, Berlin, Leipzig, Dortmund, plus 2 games in each of Gelsenkirchen and Dusseldorf. Most itineraries look fairly mild, and if there is a particularly long journey between two of the games then the third one compensates (e.g. team C3 plays in Gelsenkirchen, then Munich twice).\n\nIn this house planning has begun!\n\nPlanning also beginning in this house, albeit slowly at this stage. I like how there are 4 stadiums within an hour drive from each other. That's also one part of Germany I've never been to so I might make my main 'hub' somewhere around there (or is it too industrial / bleak?). Well, never been to Hamburg either. Looks amazing but at least 4 hours from the other venues that I'd consider going to, so a bit isolated. But I'm highlighting the Hamburg quarterfinal nonetheless.\n\nOn the schedule, I never minded the off days because, for e.g., I can watch 2 QF matches by only taking one day off from work. Plus playing the round of 16 across six days is too strung-out IMO, as some of those matches aren't going to be very appealing.\n\nIt was similar for the World Cup, and I was based in Cologne which was great. (Frankfurt also is easy by train from there.) I'd stay there again except for the fact I should go somewhere else. The only other place in Germany I've spent much time is Munich, so there are still plenty of interesting options, including Hamburg like you say.\n\nRest days for the half-hearted who are watching from home? Out of the question! And there's no excuse for missing any of the R16 either, pull your socks up man. (But it could be final group games that move to fill the void instead.)\n\nHallo!\n\nI have only ever went to 1 Euros game and that was through a Sponsor Ticket.\n\nSo this will be my first time buying tickets for the Euros.\n\n-What type of Ticket products are offered by UEFA? Is there anything like a TST offered by FIFA which guarantees a Final Ticket?\n\n-Is there a Ballot and FCFS both?\n\n-Will there be a Domestic portal?\n\nApologies for too many questions at once but I couldn't find anything on the UEFA Website. Perhaps its too early to update all this.\n\nExcited as the Final will be taking place in the city I reside in (as it stands haha). Can't wait!\n\nIt's usually roughly similar to the FIFA world cup process. Usually begins about a year before the tournament kicks off with a \"blind\" lottery phase where people apply for certain matches before they know who is playing in them. That's followed by a number of FCFS and additional lottery phases. But I doubt we will know the details until next Spring.\n\nAlso for these Ruhr venues (Dortmund, Gelsenkirchen, Düsseldorf, Köln), a 15:00 kickoff (assuming 15:00, 18:00, 21:00) can be easily reached from The Netherlands and back in a day. I've done it many times to watch club football that kick off at 15:30 on a Saturday for example - catching one of the first trains in, and last trains back. Enough time to have some beer on the train, look around the square/city, have a few more beers somewhere with a big lunch, and get to the stadium, enjoy it, and comfortably go back home that evening.\n\nAlthough Holland's qualifying group is a little treacherous being drawn with France and then Ireland (nightmares of 2001), if we qualify for the tournament proper I hope we get to play in the West. There are only a few draw combinations where we would play most of our group games \"far away\" in say Berlin, Munich etc., but of course let's at least qualify first (which seems to be a challenge half the time).\n\nPersonally I've tried to avoid some of these big German stadiums as possible in the last few years with an eye to Euro 2024. Never visited Stuttgart before, so would love to go there. It's all set up to be a true summer football tournament."
