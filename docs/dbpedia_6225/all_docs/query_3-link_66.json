        "text": "Liverpool and Chelsea will be contesting in the first all-English UEFA Super Cup final on Wednesday night in Istanbul - live on talkSPORT.\n\nThe showpiece match is the season opener for European competitions as the winners of the Champions League and Europa League go head-to-head.\n\nAtletico Madrid are the reigning champions after beating LaLiga rivals Real Madrid in Tallinn last season.\n\nHowever, there will be no Spanish team competing in this year's final for only the second time since 2008.\n\nThe Premier League has not had a Super Cup champion since Liverpool beat CSKA Moscow in 2005, but that will change this week - when an English side will get their hands on the trophy for the eighth time.\n\nWith a particular focus on this year's finalists Liverpool and Chelsea, talkSPORT.com looks at how English sides have fared in the Super Cup over the years.\n\nLiverpool\n\nThe Reds currently have three wins to their name in this fixture, having featured five times in the competition.\n\nThey won in 1977 (vs Hamburg) and 2005 (CSKA Moscow) as European champions and in 2001 (vs Bayern Munich) as UEFA Cup holders.\n\nLiverpool have also lost 1978 (vs Anderlecht) and 1984 (vs Juventus).\n\nChelsea\n\nThe Blues will be competing in their fourth UEFA Super Cup final match this week, and will be looking to add to their solitary win against Real Madrid in 1998.\n\nGus Poyet's late goal was enough to settle the encounter in Monaco.\n\nFrank Lampard, twice a losing finalist as a player with the Blues in 2012 (vs Atletico Madrid) and 2013 (vs Bayern Munich), will be hoping he can lift his first silverware as Chelsea head coach if they can overcome their domestic rivals in Turkey.\n\nEnglish teams' record\n\nAs previously mentioned, this will be the eighth time an English team has reigned triumphant in this fixture.\n\nNottingham Forest, Aston Villa, Manchester United and Chelsea have all registered one victory in the competition, in addition to Liverpool's trio of wins.\n\nUnder the stewardship of the late, great Brian Clough, Forest got the better of Barcelona in the two-legged 1979 final.\n\nThe Midlands outfit took a 1-0 lead to the Camp Nou courtesy of Charlie George, before Kenny Burns scored the decisive goal in Spain to secure the Midlands outfit further silverware.\n\nAston Villa were another English side who got the better off Barcelona to secure Super Cup glory in 1982.\n\nVilla suffered a 1-0 defeat in the first leg at the Camp Nou, before winning the reverse fixture 3-0 at Villa Park after extra time to secure a 3-1 aggregate win.\n\nMeanwhile, Manchester United's first taste of the competition came in 1991.\n\nAfter defeating Barcelona in the Cup Winners' Cup, they faced European champions Red Star Belgrade in the 1991 Super Cup final.\n\nDue to Yugoslavia's unstable political climate, it was decided the encounter would be settled over one leg.\n\nBrian's McClair strike was enough to hand United a 1-0 win and Sir Alex Ferguson his third trophy at the time.\n\nMemorable finals\n\nBarcelona 5-4 Sevilla (aet) - August 11, 2015\n\nThe 2015 final was a memorable one as ​Barcelona equalled ​AC Milan's record of five UEFA Super Cup wins in a nine-goal thriller with Sevilla.\n\nEver Banega put Sevilla ahead after just three minutes with a free-kick, but a quick-fire double from Lionel Messi soon after swung the ascendancy back in the LaLiga giants' favour.\n\nRafinha and Luis ​Suarez added Barca's third and fourth to put the game seemingly out of sight, but the late Jose Antonio Reyes pulled a goal back to give Sevilla hope.\n\nAnd after Kevin Gameiro converted a penalty with 18 minutes remaining, the comeback was remarkably complete when Yevhen Konoplyanka equalised for Sevilla just before full-time.\n\nHowever, Barcelona would yet again get themselves ahead, with Pedro capitalising on a rare Messi miss 15 minutes into extra-time to deliver more trophy glory for Barcelona.\n\nBayern Munich 2-3 Liverpool - August 24, 2001\n\nA crowd of only 13,824 were in attendance to see Liverpool secure their second Super Cup success in Monaco.\n\nJohn Arne Riise and Emile Heskey were on target in the first half to give the Reds a comfortable 2-0 leading into the break.\n\nMichael Owen, who produced a man-of-the-match display in the encounter, made it 3-0 to the visitors shortly after the interval.\n\nHasan Salihamidzic and Carsten Jancker replied for Bayern, but Liverpool held out to pick up their first piece of silverware of the 2001/2002 season following a successful UEFA Cup campaign the previous year."
