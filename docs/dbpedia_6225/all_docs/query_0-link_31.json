        "text": "The 2024/25 UEFA Champions League will look a little different to recent seasons, as European football's governing body rolls out its expansion plan.\n\nNext season's tournament will follow what's become known as a Swiss model, in which the initial group stage is replaced by a \"league phase\" comprising 36 teams instead of the customary 32. That first round of the tournament will see each team play eight matches as they bid to be ranked in the top eight places to earn a spot in the knockout phase (or a two-legged playoff tie for those in 9th to 24th spot in the standings).\n\nFrom there, we enter a more traditional elimination phase of the competition, with two-legged matchups in the Round of 16, quarterfinals and semifinals, all before the final at the end of the European club season.\n\nThat title match will be staged in Germany in 2025, marking the first time the country has hosted the Champions League final since 2015 when Barcelona beat Juventus 3-1 in Berlin.\n\nMORE: Who is the most successful manager in UEFA Champions League history?\n\nWhere and when is Champions League final 2025?\n\nThe 2025 UEFA Champions League final will be at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany. The stadium is the home of Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich and was the stage for the 2012 final, when Chelsea defeated Bayern on penalties.\n\nThe match is scheduled to take place on Saturday, May 31, 2025.\n\nA kickoff time has not yet been decided, but it is likely to follow recent tradition and begin at 9 p.m. CEST, which is 3 p.m. ET.\n\nMORE: Which teams from the Premier League have qualified for the Champions League next season?\n\nWhere are the next Champions League finals?\n\nUEFA normally selects final venues in 2-3 year blocks, with the 2026 final having already been confirmed as taking place in Budapest, Hungary.\n\nThe 2026 title decider is set for the Puskas Arena, which holds a capacity of just over 67,000.\n\nThe decision for the 2027 Champions League showpiece has been delayed, with UEFA waiting for information from the Italian Football Federation over refurbishment plans for the San Siro stadium in Milan.\n\nChampions League final host venues"
