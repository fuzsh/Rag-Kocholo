        "text": "The NFL’s Baltimore Ravens have shown off recent renovations to M&T Bank Stadium at a soccer match between FC Barcelona and AC Milan.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens said renovations started right after the 2023 season and spanned the entire offseason. This is the first stage of a three-phase renovation that will cost a projected $430 million in total and be finished in 2026.\n\nThe unveiling was also an opportunity for the stadium’s new concessionaire, Levy, to showcase some of its new food offerings.\n\nSr. Vice President of Marketing Brad Downs said, “Today’s an exciting day to be able to show off some of the finished 2024 projects.\n\n“That’s really what it’s all about, is having a wide range of opportunity through these three years of renovations that each phase there’s a new opportunity for fans.”\n\nOne of the biggest additions this season is the Miller Lite Gatehouse and Roof Deck Bar. Both areas are accessible to all fans, and the space has the potential to be used for other events such as away game watch parties.\n\nA gateway to M&T Bank Stadium, the Miller Lite Gatehouse offers two levels of social space for fans to experience before, during and after every home game.\n\nWith a sports bar vibe, fans can enjoy drinks and socializing on the main floor while surrounded by video screens, or they can take in sights from the rooftop deck and gather “Baltimore style” under string lights while taking in a city view.\n\nThe Gatehouse is located on the stadium’s east side just outside of Gate B. Features include: Over 5,000 sq ft on both levels; Each floor accommodates 350-400 people; Dedicated restrooms on each floor.\n\nThe Ravens also unveiled The Blackwing, a luxury area that includes 10 premium suites with club access. The Blackwing replaced the previous press box location, and the new press box has been relocated to the suite level.\n\nThe Blackwing feels like a throwback to a speakeasy bar and lounge. The experience includes concierge service, high-end food and beverage options, mixologists at the bar, featured cocktails, a special selection of bakery items from a pastry chef and more.\n\nMembers of The Blackwing will have access to the exclusive club on non-gamedays, as well. Features include: Parking service; Concierge service; All-inclusive food & beverage in lounge & suites; Private restrooms in each suite; Fully enclosed balcony with retractable glass.\n\nThe club level was also renovated, and 136 new field level seats were added along the northwest and southwest corners of the field.\n\nRavens President Sashi Brown said: “We wanted to honor the stadium, honor Baltimore in the renovations. Not try to transform and make it something different but really take what has been a great gameday and fan experience and enhance that. And we think we’ve really done that.”\n\nThere are further renovations to come at the venue including:\n\nWest End Zone Club (2025)\n\nThis field-level space offers a new club experience to fans who want to add a premium option to their gameday through an End Zone Club membership. The club will be home to two featured bars, with premium food and beverage. The club will operate both before and after the game, giving members a chance to heat up, cool down or relax following a Ravens’ victory.\n\nFeatures include: All-inclusive food & beverage; Premium bar experience; Access to Club restrooms throughout the game; Club can accommodate up to 500 guests.\n\nWest End Zone Suites (2025)\n\nSuite holders can take in the game from two rows of seating directly on the field in the west end zone of M&T Bank Stadium. Guests will not only have access to the West End Zone Club, but they’ll be able to enjoy a social suite experience with a private suite, as well as access to a members-only social area outfitted with bar and food service stations before, during and after the game.\n\nFeatures include: Exclusive field-level seating; All Inclusive food & beverage; Includes parking; Pre-game & post-game access to suites; Concierge service.\n\nAlso in 2025, concourses on the Upper Level of M&T Bank Stadium will expand in multiple areas, providing fans in “The Perch” additional space to enjoy unique food offerings and pre-game parties, while enjoying the best views of Charm City on gameday. New clubs will also be added.\n\nContinue to follow Coliseum for latest updates on venues business news.
