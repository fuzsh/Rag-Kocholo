Originally proposed as a contest between the winners of the European Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup, the inaugural 1972 final, where Ajax faced Rangers, was deemed unofficial by UEFA due to the latter's European competition ban. Despite this setback, Ajax emerged victorious, winning 6–3 on aggregate.\n\nOfficial recognition from UEFA came the following year, with Ajax once again triumphing, this time against AC Milan, in the first officially recognized Super Cup final in 1973. The tournament retained a two-legged format until 1997, but single-match decisions were made in 1984, 1986, and 1991 due to scheduling conflicts or political issues. Additionally, the Super Cup wasn't contested in 1974, 1981, and 1985 due to various circumstances.\n\nIn the 1992–93 season, the advent of the UEFA Champions League saw a name change for the European Cup, and subsequently, the Super Cup began featuring the Champions League winner against the Cup Winners' Cup victor. Following the renaming of the Cup Winners' Cup to the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1994–95, the Super Cup became the UEFA Super Cup.\n\nThe discontinuation of the Cup Winners' Cup after the 1998–99 season led to the inclusion of UEFA Cup (renamed UEFA Europa League in 2009) winners in the Super Cup. Since then, the Super Cup has been contested between the winners of the Champions League and the Europa League.\n\nNotable milestones include Chelsea contesting the Super Cup in 2013 as holders of all three UEFA club honors, and the relocation of the match from Stade Louis II in Monaco to various stadiums from 2013 onwards. Additionally, changes in scheduling, such as moving the match from late August to mid-August starting in 2014, have been implemented.\n\nIn 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Super Cup final faced logistical changes, with the venue shifted to Puskás Aréna in Budapest, Hungary, and the match serving as a pilot event allowing a reduced number of spectators.\n\n1BoxOffice: Your Premier Destination for Super Cup Final Tickets 2024\n\n1BoxOffice proudly stands as the top platform for purchasing Super Cup Final Tickets 2024 and experiencing the pinnacle of European club football.
