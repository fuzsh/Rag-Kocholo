        "text": "The first ever European Cup final at Wembley featured the champions of Italy against the champions of Portugal.\n\nIt was the third final in a row for Portuguese giants Benfica. Milan were making their first ever final appearance.\n\nThe 'Eagles' had won the two previous finals, and with star striker Eusebio up front, were expected to complete a hat-trick of victories.\n\nEusebio opened the scoring for the Portuguese side in the 19th minute. The âBlack Pantherâ would go on to score 57 goals in 75 games in Europe for Benfica, during a glittering career.\n\nMilan had their own goal machine up front. Striker Jose 'Mazzola' Altafini hit back with two second half goals to give the Italians a first European success.\n\nA young Giovanni Trappatoni patrolled the midfield for Milan on that day.\n\nâIl Trapâ would later go on to become one of Italyâs most successful coaches, managing Milan and Juventus to European Cup glory.\n\nBenfica were back at Wembley again in 1968 for their fifth final.\n\nManchester United were appearing in their first.\n\nUnited thumped Benfica 8-3 two years previously in the quarter final.\n\nA young George Best scored two goals in the away leg of that tie, earning the name El Beatle on his return to England.\n\nBobby Charlton, a World-Cup winner with England at Wembley in 1966, opened the scoring with a header.\n\nBenficaâs Jaime GraÃ§a would level the scores in the 79th minute â sending the game into extra-time.\n\nBest put United back in front with a brilliant solo goal, just two minutes into the first period of extra-time.\n\nTwo minutes later, Brian Kidd, who was celebrating his 19th birthday, extended the lead to put the English side a 3-1 up.\n\nAjax, were managed by Rinus Michels, often hailed as the architect of Total Football.\n\nOn the pitch they were led by the young genius Johan Cruyff.\n\nPanathinaikos were managed by European cup legend Ferenc Puskas. The Hungarian scored four goals in the 1960 final which Real Madid won 7-3 against Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nHe would score another treble in the 1962 final which Madrid lost 5-3 to Benfica.\n\nDirk van Dijk gave Ajax the early lead with a goal in the 5th minute.\n\nArie Haan would double the Dutch sideâs advantage in the 87th minute.\n\nAjax would win their first European Cup 2-0.\n\nVictory in 1971 was the first of three European Cup final victories in succession for Ajax, who would go on to dominate the European stage in the early 70âs.\n\nThe 1992 European Cup Final would be the last one before it was rebranded to the UEFA Championsâ League.\n\nIt would also be the last European Cup final played under the twin towers of the old Wembley Stadium.\n\nBarcelona were appearing in their third final, having lost the previous two in 1961 and 1986."
