        "text": "The UEFA Europa League represents an annual competition organized by UEFA since 1971 for European soccer clubs. Based on their results in their national leagues and cup competitions, teams qualify for the yearly tournament.\n\nIt is the second-tier European club soccer competition, which ranks a rank below the UEFA Champions League. The UEFA Cup Winners' Cup was discontinued in 1999 and it was merged with the UEFA Cup.\n\nThus, it was previously named the UEFA Cup. However, after a format change in the 2009-10 season, the tournament was renamed as the UEFA Europa League. The UEFA Cup and UEFA Europa League are considered the same competition, with the change of name being merely a re-branding.\n\n28. Manchester United – 1 title\n\nManchester United lift the 2017 UEFA Europa League trophy. (Getty)\n\nManchester United have featured in only one Europa League final and they managed to lift the title afterward. They faced Ajax in the 2017 UEFA Europa League Final on May 24, 2017, at the Friends Arena in Solna, Sweden. The final score was 2-0 for the Red Devils, as Paul Pogba and Henrikh Mkhitaryan got their names on the scoresheet.\n\nThrough this success, they became the fifth team to have won all three main European trophies (European Champion Clubs' Cup/UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League, and the now-extinct Cup Winners' Cup), following the footsteps of Juventus, Ajax, Bayern, and Chelsea.\n\n27. Shakhtar Donetsk – 1 title\n\nThe Valencia team gathered around the trophy in the 2004 UEFA Cup Final. (Getty)\n\nShakhtar Donetsk also have one title, which they won at the 2009 UEFA Cup Final. They met with Werder Bremen in the final which was contested at the Sukru Saracoglu Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, on 20 May 2009.\n\nThis was the first time that the UEFA Cup Final was contested in Turkey, followed by the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final, contested at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul. The Ukrainian club were the better side against Werder Bremen, thanks to an extra-time strike by Jadson. Thus, Shakhtar won 2-1.\n\n26. Zenit Saint Petersburg – 1 title\n\nZenit Saint Petersburg players celebrate after winning the 2008 UEFA Cup Final. (Getty)\n\nZenit Saint Petersburg have one UEFA Cup/Europa League trophy so far in their history. The Russian side have played in one final, the 2008 UEFA Cup Final.\n\nThey clashed off with Rangers on May 14, 2008, at the City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester, England. Igor Vladimirovich Denisov opened the score in the 72nd minute, and Konstantin Zyryanov scored a late goal to give Zenit their first European title ever.\n\n25. CSKA Moscow – 1 title\n\nCSKA Moscow after winning their first UEFA Cup. (Getty)\n\nCSKA Moscow faced Sporting Lisbon in the 2005 UEFA Cup Final. The game was played at the Estadio Jose Alvalade in Lisbon, Portugal, on May 18, 2005. During this season, the structure of the tournament was modified from the previous seasons, with the effect that an additional qualification stage and a group round after the first round were added.\n\nSporting’s Rogero opened the score in the 29th minute. However, his strike was canceled by Aleksei Berezutskiy in the 56th minute, followed by Yuti Zhirkov, who added another one nine minutes later. It was Vagner Love who scored the final goal of the game. Thus, CSKA won 3-1.\n\n24. Valencia – 1 title\n\nThe Valencia team gathered around the trophy in the 2004 UEFA Cup Final. (Getty)\n\nValencia featured in the 2004 UEFA Cup Final where they met Marseille on the opposite side. The match was contested on May 19, 2004, at the Ullevi in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nIt was Vincente who scored the first goal for the Bats in the 45th minutes after a successful penalty-kick. Then, in the 58th minute, Mista closed the game as he bagged his club’s second goal, which proved to be the second and final goal of the game as well. Valencia won 2-0.\n\n23. Galatasaray – 1 title\n\nGalatasaray celebrate after beating Arsenal in 2000 UEFA Cup Final. (Getty)\n\nInterestingly enough, Galatasaray met with Arsenal in the 2000 UEFA Cup Final. They faced off at the Parken Stadium in Copenhagen, Denmark, on May 17, 2000. Both sides were equally strong and didn’t manage to beat the other club’s goalkeeper after 120 played minutes.\n\nAs a result, the winner had to be decided after a session of penalty-kicks. The Galatasaray players converted all of their penalties, while Davor Suker and Patrick Viera missed theirs. The Turkish outfit won 4-1 on penalties.\n\n22. Schalke 04 – 1 title\n\nSchalke 04 players celebrate title vs Inter. (Getty)\n\nGerman side Schalke 04 and Italian club Inter went head-to-head in the two-legged 1997 UEFA Cup Final. Schalke won 1-0 in the first leg which was played on May 7, 1997, at the Parkstadion in Gelsenkirchen, thanks to a goal by Marc Wilmots.\n\nOn the other hand, the second match belonged to Inter, as the Nerazzurri triumphed 1-0 two weeks later, at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in Milan. Ivan Zamorano scored the only goal of the game in the 84th minute, so the winner had to be decided on penalties. Schalke won 4-1 on penalties.\n\n21. Bayern – 1 title\n\nBayern players and the 1996 UEFA Cup. (Getty)\n\nThe two-legged 1996 UEFA Cup Final saw Bayern come up against French outfit Bordeaux. In the first game, which was played on May 1, 1996, at the Olympiastadion in Munich, Bayern triumphed 2-0. Thomas Helmer and Mehmet Scholl scored the two goals.\n\nTwo weeks later, the two sides met in the second leg, at the Stade du Parc Lescure in Bordeaux. Bayern won again, this time 3-1. Mehmet Scholl, Emil Kostadinov, and Jurgen Klinsmann netted for the Bavarians, while Daniel Dutuel scored the lone goal for the Frenchmen.\n\n20. Napoli – 1 title\n\nSSC Napoli celebrate their victory with the trophy during the UEFA Cup Final Second Leg. (Getty)\n\nNapoli were the better side against Stuttgart in the 1989 European Cup Finals. Back then, two games were played to determine the winner. Napoli won the first leg 2-1, played on May 3, 1989, on their home ground.\n\nThen, in the second leg, which was played in Germany, the two sides drew 3-3. However, Nthe Partenopei won 5–4 on aggregate to lift their first and only UEFA Cup.\n\n19. Bayer Leverkusen – 1 title\n\nBayer Leverkusen celebrating with the UEFA Cup trophy. (Getty)\n\nBayer Leverkusen faced Espanyol in the 1988 UEFA Cup Finals. In the first leg, played on May 4, 1988, at the Estadi de Sarria in Barcelona, Spain, the Spanish side won 3-0.\n\nThen, the Spaniards were shocked by Bayer as the Germans won the second leg with an equal result of 3-0. The second leg was played 14 days later, at the Ulrich-Haberland-Stadion in Leverkusen, Germany. It was 3-3 on aggregate but Bayer Leverkusen won 3-2 on penalties.\n\n18. Ipswich Town – 1 title\n\nThe Ipswich Town team pose together for a team photograph with the UEFA Cup trophy. (Getty)\n\nIpswich may currently be playing in League One, the third tier of the English soccer league system, but they used to rule the UEFA Cup at the beginning of the ‘80s. In the 1981 UEFA Cup Finals, they faced AZ Alkmaar for the Netherlands.\n\nOn May 6, 1981, they beat AZ 3-0 in the first leg at the Portman Road in Ipswich, England. Then, to their surprise, Az Alkmaar didn’t give up without a fight. The Dutch outfit managed to beat them 4-2 in the second leg. However, that was not enough as Ipswich Town won 5–4 on aggregate.\n\n17. Eintracht Frankfurt – 1 title\n\nEintracht Frankfurt celebrating with the UEFA Cup trophy. (Getty)\n\nEintracht Frankfurt met with their fellow German side, Borussia Monchengladbach in the battle to lift the 1980 UEFA Cup trophy. On May 7, 1980, the two clubs faced off at the Bokelbergstadion in Monchengladbach.\n\nMonchengladbach were the superior side in the first leg and they celebrated a 3-2 victory. Then the second leg, Eintracht Frankfurt got back into the game thanks to a 1-0 win. It was 3-3 on aggregate but Frankfurt won on the away goals rule.\n\n16. PSV Eindhoven – 1 title\n\nPSV Eindhoven celebrate winning the UEFA European Cup in 1978. (Getty)\n\nPSV Eindhoven featured in the 1978 UEFA Cup Finals alongside French side SC Bastia. Bastia are currently playing in Championnat National, French soccer's third division. The first leg was played on April 26, 1978, at the Stade Armand Cesari in Bastia.\n\nIt ended in a disappointing 0-0 draw for both sides.
