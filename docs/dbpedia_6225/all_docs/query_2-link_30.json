        "text": "Berlin Olympic Stadium, stadium built for the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, part of a sport complex originally called the Reich Sports Field (German: Reichssportfeld), that is now used for international football matches.\n\nThe Nazis were determined to make the 1936 Berlin Olympics a memorable showcase for Aryan physical superiority, and with this in mind the architect Werner March was commissioned to build the massive stadium (Olympiastadion), the centerpiece of Reich Sports Field in the Grunewald forest to the west of Berlin. In addition to the central Olympic stadium, there was a vast athletics field, the Mayfield (Maifeld), with a capacity of some 75,000; the Waldb√ºhne amphitheater, which held 25,000 spectators; and more than 100 other buildings to accommodate the various Olympic sports.\n\nWork on the Olympic stadium began in 1934 and was completed in time for the Games in the summer of 1936. Taking the symmetrical form of a large oval, it was built in the monumental Neoclassical style favored by the Nazis and was capable of holding 110,000 spectators. The structure was partially dug into the ground so that the field itself was some 40 feet (12 m) below ground level. Its sheer scale was intended to impress the world and inspire awe, and in this it succeeded. Although Germany topped the medals table, the 1936 Games were most memorable for the performances of American athlete Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals in the track-and-field events and, because he was Black, completely undermined the myth of Aryan superiority."
