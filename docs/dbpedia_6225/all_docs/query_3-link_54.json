        "text": "The 69th edition of Europe’s premier club competition, the 32nd since it was renamed the Champions League is edging ever closer to the grand finale. The group stage, 32 teams split into eight groups of four which completed at the end of the year, provided us with the fixtures in the round of 16, which gets underway on Tuesday 13 February.\n\nThis, as you may know, is the last time that the tournament is being played in its current format. Back in July 2023, UEFA announced a new, expanded competition which will feature 36 teams starting from the 2024/25 season.\n\nWhere and when will the 2024 Champions League final be played?\n\nBefore we look too far ahead, let’s stay focused on the here and now. The 2023/24 final will be held at Wembley, in London on Saturday 1 June 2024. The historic English ground has held a grand total of seven European Cup/Champions League finals - five of those at the original stadium and the two most recent (2011 and 2013) at the rebuilt venue, which opened in 2007.\n\nUEFA announced the various locations back in 2021.\n\nWembley had originally been slated to host the 2023 final but due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final during the Covid-19 pandemic, all of the final hosts were shifted back a year. That meant that last year’s final between Manchester City and Inter Milan was played at Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul with London instead readied to host the 2024 final."
