Only Valencia have played three finals in a row, from 1962 to 1964, winning the first two clashes against Barcelona and Dinamo Zagreb, and losing the third to Real Zaragoza.\n\nOther clubs that made it to the finals in successive seasons include Leeds United (1967 and 1968), Borussia Mönchengladbach (1979 and 1980), Anderlecht (1983 and 1984) and Inter Milan (1997 and 1998), all of them winning and losing once.\n\nLast season Sevilla defeated Middlesbrough by 4-0 in Eindhoven and if they repeat the success on May 16 in Glasgow, they will become only the fourth team to hold the trophy for two successive seasons. Only Spanish teams have managed that: Barcelona did it in 1958 and 1960, Valencia in 1962 and 1963 and Real Madrid in 1985 and 1986.\n\nIn the other tie, Espanyol broke the curse that has haunted them for 19 years. In the match against Werder Bremen, the second Barcelona team held on to their 3-0 advantage, which had proven insufficient in the 1988 finals against Bayer Leverkusen. On that occasion, Espanyol were beaten by 3-0 in 120 minutes before losing 3-2 on penalties.\n\nThe finals in Glasgow will be the fourth between Spanish clubs in the UEFA/Fairs' Cup and the first in 41 years. In the previous Spanish-only finals, Barcelona came from behind to overpower Real Zaragoza by 4-3 on aggregate.\n\nItalian clubs also met four times in single-nation finals, while the English and German sides produced a fratricidal final game once each.\n\nUEFA Cup 2006-07 Quarterfinal results\n\n1st 2nd\n\nSevilla – Tottenham 2-1 2-2\n\nBayer – Osasuna 0-3 0-1\n\nAZ Alkmaar - Werder 0-0 1-4\n\nEspanyol – Benfica 3-2 0-0\n\nUEFA Cup 2006-07 Semifinal results\n\n1st 2nd\n\nOsasuna – Sevilla 1-0 0-2\n\nEspanyol – Werder 3-0 2-1\n\nSingle-nation UEFA/Fairs' Cup finals\n\n1962 Valencia – Barcelona 6-2 1-1\n\n1964 Zaragoza – Valencia 2-1\n\n1966 Barcelona – Zaragoza 0-1 4-2\n\n1972 Tottenham – Wolverhampton 2-1 1-1\n\n1980 Eintracht (F) – Borussia (M) 2-3 1-0\n\n1990 Juventus – Fiorentina 3-1 0-0\n\n1991 Inter – Roma 2-0 0-1\n\n1995 Parma – Juventus 1-0 1-1\n\n1998 Inter – Lazio 3-0\n\n2007 Sevilla – Espanyol"
