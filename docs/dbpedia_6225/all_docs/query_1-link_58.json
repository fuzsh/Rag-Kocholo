        "text": "Mikel Merino’s goal celebration against Germany was more than meets the eye.\n\nOn Friday, the Real Sociedad midfielder came off the bench for Spain to knock in a stunning game-winning header to oust Germany — the 2024 European Championship hosts — in the quarterfinal round, and in celebration of the strike and win, Merino gave a nod to his father, Angel.\n\nHe sprinted over to the corner flag, ran around it, and threw his head up to the sky while screaming victoriously as Spain solidified a spot in the semifinals.\n\nThirty-three years ago, Angel, who was a former La Liga player, did the exact same celebration in MHPArena during the 1991 UEFA Cup.\n\nAgainst Stuttgart, the elder Merino made it 2-0 during the second round, and his team went on to win the match, 3-2.\n\n“I’m dead. The adrenaline is taking its toll on me. It was a unique moment,” Mikel after the win, per The Sun.\n\nThe moment adds to the younger Merino’s already special relationship with the stadium after he made his Spanish national team debut in a 1-1 draw against Germany in 2020.\n\n“It was a goal in the 119th minute, but there is a collective effort behind it. Being tied in the 90th minute is a blow, but we deserved it,” Merino added. “It was the match we were all waiting for, between two of the best in the world. It could be a Euros or World Cup final.\n\n“We know how to suffer, we have a great team. There’s something about this stadium that makes us lucky. My father also scored here and I made my debut.”"
