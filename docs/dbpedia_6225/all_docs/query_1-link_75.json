        "text": "correct, jwdd27. Nicely done.\n\nDynamo Kyiv won the CWC in 75 and 86; Valencia in 1980, to join their 1961 and 62 Fairs Cups and 2004 UEFA Cup. Before clinching the big-eared one in 83 (after losing the 1980 final), HSV, after losing the 68 final to Milan, won the CWC in 1977, denting Anderlecht's dominance in probably the most twisted spin on that competition's \"no-one shall retain\" jinx ...\n\n... and, like Valencia with their two losing Champions League finals (one on pens), HSV probably feel their losing 1982 UEFA Cup final (albeit they were comprehensively thrashed at home by IFK in the second leg) would historically justify them popping out the blue to complete the treble next season.\n\nBut, really, most of HSV's European history was a bolt from the blue itself - playing in all three finals, one of them twice, in the space of six years.\n\nIf PSG (who followed CWC protocol by losing the 97 final, to a Ronaldo penalty for ... Barca!!! [yeah, kids] in Rotterdam, after winning it in 96 with an N'Goty deflected free-kick against Rapid Wien in Brussels) won the Champs League this season and Kyiv the Europa League, then they swapped places next season, it would also take two off our list of clubs to have hosted the European Cup/Champions League final but never won it themselves ... but that's another list we've already put to bed.\n\nJUST ONE MORE TO GO ON THIS ONE.\n\nPSG, Man City, HSV, Dynamo Kiev, Valencia, Everton, Arsenal, Lazio and ...\n\nAye - and they probably saved the CWC with those three straight finals, all in or close enough to Brussels for their fans to fill the stadiums - and their team to delight the TV audiences. A kind of Ajax Lite of that era.\n\nThey also lost the 1990 CWC final to Sampdoria, who put the final twist on the CWC's \"holders losing the final\" jinx by winning it the year after they lost the final - against the only other club to do the same thing.\n\nAnderlecht win this season's Champions League, it'll be a miracle turnaround of form but it'll also mean they've completed the European treble. So they're one of the answers for question 1.\n\nJust need one more answer for question 2. There's one club left who could theoretically have amassed all three European competitions by the end of next season.\n\nGod - so tempted to say \"all three European trophies\". But that would throw this thread into a world of pain only equated by anyone discovering Racing Jet de Bruxelles were resident at the Heysel during any of the European Cup finals it hosted ...\n\nIt was the wee ground behind the Heysel. Wasn't it ... WASN'T IT??!!\n\nYup. That's why there's nine answers to the second question and Sporting Clube de Portugal is the one no-one else got. Well done, Ursus. Knew you'd get it (now please stop thinking about this question because you're the very man who'll come up with another club I hadn't thought of and watching Chelsea-Man City won't be self-flagellation enough for me tonight).\n\nWinning the 1964 CWC (after a replay) and losing the 2005 UEFA Cup final at home to CSKA, Sporting hate that \"the five violins\" era arrived just before the European Cup did. They hate that Benfica and Porto have won the big one and they haven't. But it would go a long way to wiping out all that pain if they became the second green-and-white-hooped shirt to win the the big one and the first to win the Fairs/UEFA Cup/Europa League. By the end of next season.\n\nNot gonnae happen but - hey - it's all about the theory. And, of course, that theory has to factor in a Europan Cup-Winners' Cup on the roll of honour.\n\nAs we've already established, the likes of Parma, 1FC Magdeburg and Real Zaragoza can't do it because of the domestic tier they currently occupy. The likes of Slovan Bratislava, Rangers and Aberdeen could have if they hadn't fucked up in the qualifying rounds this season. The likes of Fiorentina and West Ham can't do it coz they didn't qualify for Europe this season.\n\nSo, as of yesterday, Friday 29 September 2017, ...\n\n(1) one or two from Milan, Borussia Dortmund, Tottenham, Anderlecht and Atletico Madrid could join the elite list of clubs to have won all three of the main European club competitions by the end of the current season and, in addition ...\n\n(2) ... one or two from PSG, Man City, HSV, Sporting CP, Dynamo Kiev, Valencia, Everton, Arsenal, Lazio could join that same list by the end of next season.\n\nWell done, all. Teamwork.\n\n[Rather than the likes of Sporting or Dynamo Kiev pulling it off by the end of next season, I think it'd actually be more of a shock if PSG won the current Champions League then dropped into the Europa League next winter]\n\nSatchmo, that's not a question so much as a Let's Fuckin Have It.\n\nThat's not an enquiry about European soccer history as much as it's walking into a village pub for the first time, as the local XV start their drinking games amid the eighth stop on a nightclub bouncers pub crawl, and shouting \"Hoh! Wurzel! Pint of your warmest pisswater as soon as you've served these hen nights!\".\n\nIt's not a query. It's a wad of hundreds so thick it can be slammed on the Ladbrokes cashier's Formica-finished counter but can't be squeezed down into the little stainless steel, coin- and pen-scratched underpass through the Plexiglass screen as you bellow \"Favourite, Two thirty, Newbury\" ... and it's 7 Furlongs ... and it's 29 minutes and 40 seconds past two.\n\nIt's the biggest bench-press in the gym, the flashiest move on the dance-floor, the loudest engine down the promenade - a piss-stain at knee height ... on the inside of the trousers.\n\nWhat a fucking question.\n\nPut it another way; I don't know the answer. And I'm embarrassed I'd never really thought about it before.\n\nOnly one that jumped to mind for me was Mechelen, who didn't win much but they won the Belgian Cup to win the Cup-Winners' Cup by the most honest route. And the Belgian league title around the same era.\n\nBut a question like that demands I respond with something equally Freudian. I can't give you an answer but I can whip out my big, long list of every club who has ever won a European trophy ... and we can take it from there:\n\nReal Madrid\n\nBenfica\n\nMilan\n\nInter\n\nCeltic\n\nMan United\n\nFeyenoord\n\nAjax\n\nBayern Munich\n\nLiverpool\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nAston Villa\n\nHSV\n\nJuventus\n\nSteaua Bucharest\n\nPorto\n\nPSV\n\nRed Star Belgrade\n\nBarcelona\n\nOlympique Marseille\n\nBorussia Dortmund\n\nChelsea\n\nFiorentina\n\nAtletico Madrid\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nSporting Clube de Lisbon\n\nWest Ham\n\nSlovan Bratislava\n\nMan City\n\nRangers\n\n1FC Magdeburg\n\nDynamo Kiev\n\nRSC Anderlecht\n\nValencia\n\nDynamo Tbilisi\n\nAberdeen\n\nEverton\n\nKV Mechelen\n\nSampdoria\n\nWerder Bremen\n\nParma\n\nArsenal\n\nReal Zaragoza\n\nPSG\n\nLazio\n\nRoma\n\nFerencvaros\n\nDinamo Zagreb\n\nLeeds United\n\nNewcastle United\n\nBorussia Moenchengladbach\n\nEintracht Frankfurt\n\nIpswich Town\n\nIFK Gothenburg\n\nBayer Leverkusen\n\nNapoli\n\nSchalke 04\n\nGalatasaray\n\nCSKA Moscow\n\nSevilla\n\nZenit St Petersburg\n\nShakhtar Donetsk\n\nI'll have missed someone - or repeated someone - but spotting the mistakes is half the fun. Yet, in typing them out I can't see anyone I can think of who's had a domestic trophy drought to match Newcastle's.\n\nI'd invite everyone else to have glance and see if they can \"beat\" Newcastle.\n\nThing is, Newcastle won their last major domestic trophy, the FA Cup, on 7th May 1955 - in London. And the first goal in European club competition as we currently understand it, was scored less than one month later, by Charlton's Eddie Firmani, for the London XI, away to Basle in the Inter City Fairs Cup.\n\nCourse, that's the European trophy Newcastle later won - but, to my pattern-and-coincidence-addled belief system, that's a pretty strong case for saying European football itself has jinxed Newcastle's domestic life. You win the FA Cup, European football itself COMMENCES four weeks later ... and you haven't won another major English trophy since? Come on. This is Béla Guttmann-esque.\n\nAnd they've been trying the witch doctoring too.\n\nFive of their previous managers have played in winning European Cup/Champions League teams - at one point three successive Newcastle managers were European Cup final scorers. But now they have a guy in charge who's managed two UEFA Cup/Europa League-winning teams and one Champions League-winning team, maybe they'll break that domestic jinx."
