        "text": "AS Roma, the Serie A club owned by American businessman Dan Friedkin, have reached the final of a European tournament for the first time in 31 years.\n\nOn May 25 in Tirana, Albania, Roma will face Dutch side Feyenoord in the decisive game of the UEFA Europa Conference League (UECL), the newly-born European competition and third most important tournament behind the UEFA Europa League and UEFA Champions League.\n\nLifting a European trophy would not only boost the international reputation of the Roma brand but also provide financial reward to a club that suffered heavy financial losses at the hands of the pandemic.\n\nMuch of the credit for Roma’s achievement is due to their manager Jose Mourinho, who is in his first season at the helm of the Giallorossi.\n\nThe 59-year-old Portuguese head coach, known as the “The Special One” in the soccer community, is one of the most acclaimed managers at the international level. He boasts, among other things, two UEFA Champions League trophies and an unforgettable treble during his stint as the Inter Milan boss.\n\nConsidering Mourinho’s highly-successful resume, Roma made a financial effort to sign him last May. Per Gazzetta dello Sport estimates, Mourinho’s €7 million/year ($7.3m) paycheck is currently the largest for a head coach in Italy, with only Juventus’s Massimiliano Allegri matching this kind of salary.\n\nForged by the winning mentality and charisma of their manager, the Giallorossi have been outstanding in the UECL knockout phase, where they managed to go past Vitesse, Bodo/Glimt and, most notably, English Premier League side Leicester City FC.\n\nEarning access to the UECL final represents an incredible accomplishment for the Roma fans, who had been waiting over three decades to see their favorite team reach such a prestigious stage at the European level.\n\nThe last time that Roma featured in a European final dates back to 1991, when the Giallorossi lost to Italian rival Inter Milan in the final round of the UEFA Cup, the tournament that would later be rebranded as UEFA Europa League.\n\nIn its inaugural edition, the UECL has set aside €235m ($248m) to be distributed among the participating teams, UEFA explains. The trophy winners will pocket about €20 million ($21m), while the runners-up will collect a little more than $18m.\n\nThese figures are the result of a combination of four factors: starting fees, which are awarded to teams for making the tournament’s group stage; fixed amounts, that is prize money granted to teams according to their performance throughout the tournament; coefficient-based amounts, which depend on a team’s ranking over a 10-year period; and finally, market pool, a share of money that varies according to each club’s television market."
