        "text": "By Peter Mann\n\nThey are the club that had it all, reached the summit of European football, and then, in the heat of greed, managed to throw it all away. You could, however, say it was fun whilst it lasted, it just could have lasted for so much longer.\n\nThe football club in question is that of French giants, Olympique Marseille, a club based in the Mediterranean port city in the south of France and were one of the twenty, inaugural members of National (the forerunner of Ligue 1) for the 1932/33 season.\n\nA little over half-a-century later, and having claimed five league titles already whilst also being runners-up on a further five occasions – the seventies were particularly enjoyable – Marseille would find themselves under the guidance of French businessman, Bernard Tapie, who replaced the previous incumbent Jean Carrieu, who held the post in the early eighties.\n\nBefore that, under that of Marcel Leclerc, the south of France side would enjoy their time in the seventies sunshine, but under Tapie, in the late eighties and early nineties, would be built one of France’s most successful ever teams, but that success would ultimately come at a cost.\n\nThat cost, initially, could have quite easily been the managerial hot-seat, and hot it was. Tapie employed seven different managers over ten differing spells throughout his ownership. The Belgian, Raymond Goethals, would take the helm on three separate occasions and Gerard Gili twice whilst, in 1990, there was a brief spell for the German great, Franz Beckenbauer.\n\nResiding at their Stade Velodrome home since the late thirties, it has also played host to other competitions/sporting events including matches at the European Championships and World Cup finals of 1938, 1960, 1984, 1998 and 2016, plenty of action for fans in the Med and beyond.\n\nOne of those tournaments would play a key role in the rebuild of Marseille, Tapie’s Marseille, when, after France had been successful at their own tournament in the ’84 Euros, the Velodrome itself hosting the five-goal, extra-time, semi-final thriller between France and Portugal before nations headed to Mexico two years later for the World Cup.\n\nAlthough it was a tournament won by Argentina, who defeated Germany 3-2 in the final at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. The French finished in third place following a 4-2, extra-time victory over Belgium at the Estadio Cuauhtemoc in Puebla – where Marseille’s new president was watching with serious intent.\n\nTwo of the early signings of the Tapie era at the Velodrome were to be the French international pairing of Alain Giresse and Jean-Pierre Papin, both of whom would go on to be instrumental in the rise of the French national team on the world stage, both of whom were tasked with aiding Marseille into the European elite.\n\nBoth Giresse and Papin were among a dozen signings Tapie sanctioned ahead of the 1986/87 campaign as Gerard Barride took the helm for the first two seasons, the south of France side emerging from the shadows of previous campaigns to finish as runners-up to champions Bordeaux, finishing four points away, a stark contrast to their previous twelfth place finish.\n\nThat first season under Tapie would also see Marseille finish runners-up in the Coupe de France for the second successive year, again losing out to Bordeaux, as they had done the season before – their instantaneous success would see them qualify for the now-defunct, European Cup Winners’ Cup, bringing European football to the Velodrome for the first time in a decade.\n\nAlthough OM would drop to sixth the following season, a good eleven points adrift of champions Monaco, the club did enjoy a semi-final run on the continent as victories over Lokomotiv Leipzig, Hajduk Split, and Finnish outfit RoFS were witnessed before they were eventually halted by the Dutch powerhouse, Ajax Amsterdam. The seeds, however, were already firmly sown and in 1989, under Gerard Gili, they reached the top of the pile, at home at least, for the first time since the early seventies, when they won back-to-back titles in 1971 and 1972.\n\nImpressively led from the front by their talisman, Papin, his 22-goal haul would fire OM to the Ligue 1 championship, finishing three points clear of runners-up Paris Saint-Germain; of their thirty-eight league games, twenty were won and thirteen drawn, whilst fifty-six goals were also netted.\n\nThat title success saw them enter the European Cup for the time since the 1972:73 season, one that would see them fall in the first round to Juventus but by now, the rollercoaster was starting on its upward trajectory.\n\nAlongside the title, OM would also claim victory, their last, in the Coupe de France when, in early June they would see off Monaco having dismissed the challenges of Sporting Toulon in the quarter-finals and Auxerre in the semi-finals.\n\nFor all the semi-final success over Auxerre was a tame affair, the final with Monaco was from it, a seven-goal thriller in fact. Marcel Dib (2) and a late penalty from defender, and future Marseille player, Manuel Amoros, gave the principality side hope, but it wasn’t enough, as Papin bagged himself a hat-trick with Allofs adding a fourth shortly before the hour mark, Marseille emerging victorious 4-3, and Papin’s hat-trick would see him finish as the competitions top scorer.\n\nIn 1990, when they successfully defended their title, they would go on to reach the semi-finals of the European Cup, Papin would bag thirty goals throughout another productive campaign, OM narrowly seeing off the challenge presented by Bordeaux and Monaco to take Ligue 1, finishing just two points ahead of the former.\n\nMeanwhile in the European Cup, further enjoyment was had as Brondby, AEK Athens and CSKA Sofia were handsomely dismissed before they narrowly fell to Portuguese stalwarts, Benfica, losing on away goals in the semi-finals as the tie finished 2-2 on aggregate.\n\nBut what of their iconic goal machine, Jean-Pierre Papin, OM’s only Ballon D’Or winner. Born in Boulogne-Sur-Mar in the early sixties, Papin would embark on a varied playing career that would begin at Valenciennes prior to a spell in Belgium, with Club Brugge. A six-year masterclass in Marseille then ensued before spells in Germany with Bayern Munich, and Italy with AC Milan, before wrapping up his career back home with Bordeaux, Guingamp, and, either side of the millennium, Saint-Pierroise.\n\nPapin would also go on to earn over fifty caps for the French national team, leading them to third place at the 1986 World Cup.\n\nA trophy-laden career would see him lift six league titles, four national cups, a Champions League and UEFA Cup winners’ medal whilst in ’91, he claimed that Ballon D’Or as Europe’s premier footballer, the only Frenchman to do so whilst playing for a French club (Michel Platini won it three times and Zinedine Zidane once, both whilst in Italy with Juventus – Zizou the last Frenchman to take that prize). Papin currently manages Championnat National 2 outfit, C’Chartres Football, having had spells in charge of Strasbourg, Lens, Chateauroux and FC Bassin.\n\nBack to OM now. Having won Ligue 1 the previous season, they strengthened with the signings of goalkeeper Pascal Olmeta, defenders Bernard Casoni and Basile Boli, Dragan Stojkovic (an attacking midfielder to give competition for the mercurial Chris Waddle), and, after a brief spell at the helm by Beckenbauer, the erstwhile Belgian, Goethals, took over for the first of his three spells at the club within a couple of years.\n\nAs the legendary Papin continued to bulge the opposition’s net, the new campaign would see OM reach the promised land of the European Cup final for the first time, before narrowly missing out on lifting the holy grail. At home, in Ligue 1, OM would claim a second successive championship, by four from runners-up, Monaco, and by seven from Auxerre.\n\nIn Europe, after a previous best of semi-finalists in previous seasons in both the Cup Winners’ Cup and European Cup, that 1990/91 campaign would see them go all the way to the Stadio San Nicol, in Bari, Italy, eventually succumbing to significant underdogs, Red Star Belgrade.\n\nHaving started out at the Velodrome in September 1990, OM would emphatically dismiss Albanians Dinamo Tirana, Papin netting a hat-trick in a 5-1 victory with their other scorers being that enigmatic Frenchman, Eric Cantona, and Philippe Vercruysse, before shutting up shop in the second leg in Tirana.\n\nThe second round would see the now French giants involved in a twelve-goal thriller with Polish outfit, Lech Poznan, OM progressing 8-4 on aggregate thanks mainly to a rampant 6-1 home win in the second leg. This time, Vercruysse scored three after Papin had opened the floodgates, French legend Jean Tigana, in the swansong of his career, adding a fifth, and Basile Boli the sixth.\n\nItalian giants AC Milan were the opponents in the quarter-finals, the Rossoneri embarking on their own, golden era. Following a somewhat even first leg in the San Siro – Ruud Gullit and Papin netting in a 1-1 draw – in the return leg, OM won amidst controversy.\n\nLeading through Chris Waddle’s 75th minute effort, and heading into the closing minutes with that lead intact, the Velodrome suffered partial floodlight failure, forcing Swedish referee, Bo Karlsson to call a temporary halt to proceedings. The match however would be abandoned, Milan were punished, and OM awarded a 3-0 victory, progressing to the semis on the back of a 4-1 aggregate victory, where they would oppose the Russian side, Spartak Moscow.\n\nHaving narrowly edged past Napoli in the second round themselves, Moscow then defeated the mighty Real Madrid in the quarters after a famous 3-1 win in the Bernabeu. Marseille, though, were one step too far for the Muscovites, as they lost both legs, crashing out 5-2 on aggregate, Papin with a brace in the first leg whilst Abedi Pele and Boli netted in the second to send OM to the final for the first time in their history.\n\nOpposing a similarly free-scoring side in Red Star Belgrade, who had defeated Grasshoppers 5-2, Rangers 4-1, Dynamo Dresden 6-0, and Bayern Munich 4-3 en-route to the final; nobody, however, would have contemplated the rear-guard action the Yugoslav’s deployed on that May night in Bari.\n\nGoalless after ninety, and then a hundred-and-twenty minutes, both Dejan Stovanovic (RSB) and Pascal Olmeta (OM) proving unbeatable between the sticks throughout the contest. And so, it was on to penalties, and, although Casoni, Papin and Mozer netted for OM, that first miss, from Manuel Amoros, proved costly and gave the French side a mountain to climb. Darko Pancev netting the deciding spot-kick to crush Marseille dreams.\n\nBetween the years of 1991 and 1993, OM owner Bernard Tapie, and that axe of his, rose and fell with unerring regularity as first Goethals departed, being replaced by Tomislav Ivic, before the Belgian maestro returned between late ’91 and early ’92 before Jean Fernandez had a brief spell at the helm. Goethals then headed back to the Velodrome for third time lucky, aiming to finish the job he started when on the road to Bari, his road eventually leading, in the summer of ’93, to the Olympiastadion in Munich.\n\nAgain that, Ligue 1 championship was to be successfully defended and again, Papin finished as the top-scorer. In the European Cup, it would be a second round exit, on away goals, at the hands of Slavia Prague, Papin netting a brace in the first leg that would eventually prove insufficient.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ligue 1, it was to be a six point victory over runners-up Monaco, and eleven clear of PSG in third; as for the Coupe de France, it was to be an outcome tinged with disaster.\n\nIn reaching the semi-finals of the 1991/92 competition, the game between SC Bastia and OM, shortly before kick-off, would be postponed due to the catastrophic collapse of what was a temporary stand at the Armand Cesari Stadium, the collapse would kill eighteen spectators, and injure over 2,300 more.\n\nBecause of that incident, the final of the 75th Coupe de France was not played and the trophy was not awarded. Monaco, who had won the other semi-final, would qualify for the Cup Winners’ Cup whilst OM, having won the league, were on their quest for eternal glory and that 1993 European Cup.\n\nAlthough they would claim the Ligue 1 championship for a fifth consecutive season – the last of their triumphs would be stripped from them due to an OM player, Jean-Jacques Eyedelie, and the OM Board of Directors embroiling themselves in a match-fixing scandal. Involving that of their final match-day opponents, Valenciennes, and a trio of their players Jorge Burruchaga, Christophe Robert, and Jacques Glassman.\n\nHaving been relegated themselves, finishing third bottom and a solitary point behind Lille, Valenciennes were bribed, through Eyedelie, to throw that last game of the season with OM, to go on easy on them due to the upcoming appearance in the European Cup final – their second crack at the holy grail in three years.\n\nOnto that European adventure, and that road to Munich began in Glentoran, Northern Ireland in the mid-September. the French side comfortably winning both legs and wrapping up an 8-0 aggregate victory.\n\nIn the second sound it wasn’t quite as routine, following a goalless first leg in Romania, hosts Dinamo Bucaresti putting on a rear-guard action that would hold out until half an hour into the Velodrome second leg, Alen Boksic then notch a brace which would send the South of France powerhouse into the first ever European Cup group phase.\n\nPaired with Club Brugge, CSKA Moscow, and Rangers, OM would embark upon an unbeaten group run that would see them finish a point ahead of second place Rangers, winning three and drawing three of their six matches, netting fourteen times, and conceding just the four.\n\nOn the other side of the draw, Italian giants AC Milan progressed with a 100% record, winning six from six, seeing off IFK Goteborg, FC Porto, and PSV Eindhoven in the blink of an eye, Milan’s scorers being that of Marco Van Basten, and a certain Jean-Pierre Papin.\n\nThe 1993 European Cup final, in Munich, would therefore be between Olympique Marseille and AC Milan, the highlight of then manager Goethals’ illustrious career, alongside his taking his country, Belgium, to third place at the 1972 European Championship.\n\nMeanwhile in Munich, a tournament that had seen two OM players, Sauzee and Boksic, alongside Milan’s Papin, finished as joint-second scorers behind PSV Eindhoven’s Romario. It would be Goethals and Marseille who’d bring the silverware back to France, still the only French side to win the trophy.\n\nAfterwards, Goethals said of Marseille’s success: “It was a victory for our tactics. After the problems we had in the opening stages we were better organised and had a clearer idea of our tactics”. Not many can say that when opposing that Milan side of the early nineties.\n\n“I’m delighted for Mr. Tapie. There’s been a lot of misunderstanding about the way he works. Tapie has great ambitions, but he has to be hands on in every project he undertakes. I am the coach. I have my specific role in the club. Tapie is president. He believes he has a role to play in everything.”\n\nOnly one goal would settle it as well, a header from the Ivorian-born defender, Basile Boli, two minutes before the interval proving the difference-maker as he, alongside other Marseille players, etched themselves into history.\n\nIn the July 1993 issue of World Soccer magazine, legendary journalist, Keir Radnedge, opened his report of that night, with the headline ‘Marseille the Masters: Tapie wins the presidential duel as Milan get it all wrong on the night’:\n\n“Marseille brought the Champions Cup full circle as one presidential ego overtook another in Munich.\n\n“Bernard Tapie had not spent anywhere near the €35 million which Silvio Belusconi invested last summer on his own Dream Team concept at Milan. But Tapie, controversial businessman, politician and champagne socialist, had thrown all his personal resources into achieving that ultimate soccer ambition of bringing to France its first European trophy of any shape or form.\n\n“Tapie’s methods are all his own. Marseille have always been steeped in controversy; even their greatest success was achieved in the shadow of match-fixing allegations concerning a game at Valenciennes.”\n\nWhilst later in the report, Keir adds: “Home-coming Rudi Voller – whose career began in Munich with the 1860 club – kept the great sweeper Franco Baresi, too busy to indulge in his influential dashes forward; the right-wing technique of Abedi Pele tied down the raiding danger of Paolo Maldini; Didier Deschamps and Frack Sauzee, playing with admirably tight discipline, permitted Milan no space in midfield; and Boli not only scored the decisive goal but eventually drove Milan into the humiliation of substituting even Marco Van Basten.”\n\nOf French sides in European competition, any European competition, Marseille apart, only Paris Saint-Germain have brought silverware back to France, winning the European Cup Winners’ Cup three years after OM’s success. Though, both of those sides have been runners-up on three further occasions apiece. Marseille, in the UEFA Cup/Europa League, fell at the final hurdle three times to Parma in 1999, Valencia in 2004 and then Atletico Madrid in 2018.\n\nSo, all told, a quarter-of-a-century has now elapsed since a French side last claimed European glory and, with major powerhouses across the continent seemingly pulling away, what price on that spell being broken any time soon?\n\nBy Peter Mann\n\nFeatured Image: PKFoot"
