        "text": "Similar to the World Cup held every 4 years, the UEFA European Championship is also contested after every 4 years amongst the top national teams associated to Europe and UEFA.\n\nSoviet Union and West Germany participated in the tournaments till the 1988 edition and prior to the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991. Thus we have a list of Champions from the past, starting from the 1960s when the tournament was known as the European Nations’ Cup final to the last edition held in Ukraine known as the UEFA Euro Cup 2012.\n\n1. UEFA European Championship 1960\n\nWinner – The Soviet Union\n\nRunners up – Yugoslavia\n\nFinal Score – Soviet Union 2-1 Yugoslavia (After ET)\n\nThe first ever European final went to extra time after a 1-1 draw in the first 90 minutes. Viktor Ponedelnik scored a header to win it for the Soviet Union in the second half of extra time. The final was played at the Parc Des Princes, Paris.\n\n2. UEFA European Championships 1964\n\nWinner – Spain\n\nRunners up – The Soviet Union\n\nFinal Score – Spain 2-1 Soviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union was just six minutes away from defending the title after 4 years and after reaching the final in the 1964 edition. But Spain’s Marcelino scored the eventual winner after the first 90 minutes to break the deadlock on 1-1.\n\n3. UEFA European Championships 1968\n\nWinner – Italy\n\nRunners up – Yugoslavia\n\nFinal Score – Italy 2-0 Yugoslavia\n\nThe final in this tournament finished 1-1 between the hosts Italy and Yugoslavia. Though the semi-final draw was decided after a toss, this one needed a re-match. The re-match ended 2-0 in Italy’s favor giving them their first European title.\n\n4. UEFA European Championships 1972\n\nWinner – West Germany\n\nRunners up – Soviet Union\n\nFinal Score – West Germany 3-0 Yugoslavia\n\nA brace from Gerd Muller and another goal from Herbert Wimmer demolished the Soviet Union side which featured in a European Cup final for the 3rd time. The performance of the German team was much superior and that reflected in the result.\n\n5. UEFA European Championships 1976\n\nWinner – Czechoslovakia\n\nRunners up – West Germany\n\nFinal Score – Czechoslovakia 2-2 W. Germany (5-3 on penalties)\n\nThe most entertaining final since the inception of the European Championships, this one went to the nerves as the Germans equalized in the last minute to force the game to extra time. The extra time score remained 2-2 and eventually Czechoslovakia won it 5-3 on penalties. Uli Hoeneb was the German to miss in the shootouts.\n\n6. UEFA European Championships 1980\n\nWinner – West Germany\n\nRunners up – Belgium\n\nFinal Score – W. Germany 2-1 Belgium\n\nThe third final for West Germany gave them their second title after two quick goals from Horst Hrubesch downplayed any advances from the young Belgium side in the final. Rene Vandereycken successfully converted a penalty for the Belgians but that wasn’t enough on the night.\n\n7. UEFA European Championships 1984\n\nWinner – France\n\nRunners up – Spain\n\nFinal Score – France 2-0 Spain\n\nFrance totally dominated the contest with Michel Platini scoring a brace and reaching a record breaking 9th goal. The 9th goal also gave France a 2-0 lead in the final and ultimately prized them with their first title.\n\n8. UEFA European Championships 1988\n\nWinner – Netherlands\n\nRunners up – Soviet Union\n\nFinal Score – Netherlands 2-0 Soviet Union\n\nThis tournament saw veterans Soviet Union take on the Dutch but is remembered more for Marco Van Basten’s stunning volley to score the second for the Netherlands. The Dutch had their first winners medal in their first ever final.\n\n9. UEFA European Championships 1992\n\nWinner – Denmark\n\nRunners up – Germany\n\nFinal Score – Denmark 2-0 Germany\n\nThe Danish side in this tournament eliminated the then defending champions Netherlands in the semi-finals and blanked the Germans in the final. The unified German team was looking too strong but a first half shot by John Jansen gave Denmark the lead and they extended it right before half time to win 2-0.\n\n10. UEFA European Championships 1996\n\nWinner – Germany\n\nRunner up – Czech Republic\n\nFinal Score – Germany 2-1 Czech Republic (After extra time – golden goal)\n\nGermany pushed aside their loss in the finals four years ago to take the tie into extra time. Then German midfielder Olivier Bierhoff scored the first golden goal of the European Championship’s history giving Germany the title.\n\n11. UEFA European Championships 2000\n\nWinner – France\n\nRunners up – Italy\n\nFinal Score – France 2-1 Italy (Extra time- golden goal)\n\nFrance came after winning the World Cup in 1998 and was looking at their second major European trophy in as many years. The French side was lucky to slide past a late equalizer to bring the game to 1-1 after normal time.\n\nDavid Trezeguet scored the golden goal winner 13 minutes into the extra time to secure the trophy for Les Blues.\n\n12. UEFA European Championships 2004\n\nWinner – Greece\n\nRunner up – Portugal\n\nFinal Score – Greece 1-0 Portugal\n\nGreece reached the final after just two previous entries into the competition and played hosts Portugal who were clear favorites to win the title. But to everyone’s disapproval, a shocking 1-0 win gave the title to minnows Greece.\n\nAngelos Chariestas scored the only goal of the game for the Greeks.\n\n13. UEFA European Championships 2008\n\nWinner – Spain\n\nRunners up – Germany\n\nFinal Score – Spain 1-0 Germany\n\nThe Spanish side with the likes of Casillas, Ramos, Puyol, Senna, Xavi, Iniesta and Torres went unbeaten in the whole tournament and faced Germany in the final.\n\nA 33rd minute strike from Fernando Torres was enough to win the trophy in 2008. The final was held in Vienna, Austria.\n\n14. UEFA European Championships 2012\n\nWinner – Spain\n\nRunners up – Italy\n\nFinal Score – Spain 4-0 Italy\n\nSpain successfully defended their European crown in Ukraine as they thrashed Italy 4-0 in the final. This was the biggest winning margin in a European Cup final much to Italy’s embarrassment.\n\nThe score was already 2-0 in the first half when Thiago Motta’s injury brought the Italians to 10 men. 2 more goals from David Villa and Juan Mata made it 4-0 and Spain became the only country to defend a Euro Cup title successfully."
