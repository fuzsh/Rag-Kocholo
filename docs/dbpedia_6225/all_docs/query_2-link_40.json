        "text": "Ancelotti's team possess superstars in the form of Jude Bellingham and Vinícius Júnior, world-class players such as Toni Kroos and Antonio Rüdiger and experience throughout the squad.\n\nMidfielder Julian Brandt is Dortmund's star player, and they have top-class experience in Mats Hummels and Marco Reus, but they have also reached this stage because they have gambled on the loan signings of Jadon Sancho and Ian Maatsen from Manchester United and Chelsea respectively, and benefited from the astute signing of Marcel Sabitzer from Bayern.\n\nAncelotti will be chasing a record fifth Champions League title against a coach who has won just one trophy on his résumé -- the German Cup in 2021.\n\nEverything points to Madrid having the edge.\n\nWhat are the teams' strengths and weaknesses?\n\nOnly Man City (28) have scored more goals than Madrid (26) in this season's competition, so the attacking threat posed by Ancelotti's team is clear.\n\nVinicius, Rodrygo and Joselu have all scored five goals, while Germany centre-forward Niclas Füllkrug is Dortmund's leading scorer with three.\n\nMadrid can score goals, they have the ability to control games from midfield with Kroos, Eduardo Camavinga and Federico Valverde. In defence, Rudiger has been arguably the outstanding defender in the competition this season.\n\nBut despite their many strengths, Madrid have conceded eight goals in six games during the knockout stages, so Dortmund will have chances to score. A big dilemma facing Ancelotti is whether to restore fit-again goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois following a season-long injury absence or stick with Andriy Lunin, the penalty-saving hero of the semifinal win against City.\n\nDortmund are all about work rate and the team ethic. Terzic has developed a team that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nAccording to official UEFA stats, no team have made more tackles (207) than Dortmund and they also top the charts in terms of balls recovered (529). Dortmund also lead the way in tackles won (108) and clearances (251), while their six clean sheets is two more than the next best (Arsenal, Internazionale, Real Sociedad, Bayern.)\n\nDortmund are not free-scoring, so if Madrid take the lead at Wembley, it will be a test of their ability to create opportunities.\n\nKey players and battles\n\nBellingham left Dortmund for Madrid last summer in a €103 million transfer and the England midfielder has already established himself as their most-important player.\n\nAlthough the 20-year-old's incredible early season form has levelled off, he has still scored 22 goals in 39 appearances in all competitions and registered 10 assists. His performances in his first season at the Bernabeu have marked him out as a leading candidate to win the Ballon d'Or.\n\nMadrid have key players throughout the team. Rudiger is the rock of Ancelotti's back-four while Kroos dictates the tempo with his unflappable temperament and passing range. The pace, skill and goals of Vinicius give them a cutting edge capable of hurting any side in the world.\n\nDortmund have relied on their team collective to reach the final, but 35-year-old defender Hummels has been outstanding at the back. The Germany international lacks pace, but his reading of the game ensures he remains a crucial element of Terzic's team.\n\nBrandt's creativity, in tandem with the energy, composure and reliability of Sabitzer, give Dortmund strength in midfield, while Füllkrug offers an old-school threat as a classic No. 9 and his battle with Rudiger will be a fascinating sub-plot.\n\nSancho has rediscovered his best form on Dortmund's right flank and given the team an unpredictable attacking threat.\n\nDortmund will need Sabitzer to nullify Kroos, and Hummels to keep it tight at the back when Real attack from all angles. From Madrid's perspective, they need to ensure that they have a plan to counter Dortmund's aerial threat at set pieces.\n\nThe fairy-tale ending?\n\nEveryone loves a sporting fairy tale, right? Good, because both Madrid and Dortmund have players in their team who will complete a remarkable journey if they lift the trophy.\n\nFor Dortmund, it is all about Sancho rebuilding his career back at his former club after spending the first half of this season training on his own at Man United following a public dispute with manager Erik ten Hag. United loaned Sancho back to Dortmund in January, 2½ years after signing him in a €85m deal, with little expectation that the 24-year-old would end the season in a Champions League final.\n\nBut Terzic has coaxed Sancho back to his best and Sancho now has the chance to end what looking like being the worst season of his career with a winners' medal.\n\nThe romantic story in the Madrid camp centres around Joselu, the two-goal hero of the semifinal win against Bayern.\n\nTwo years ago the 34-year-old former Stoke City forward watched Madrid beat Liverpool in Paris as a fan before signing for Espanyol later that summer, following the expiry of his contract at Alaves.\n\nDespite Joselu scoring 16 goals, placing him third behind Barcelona's Robert Lewandowski and Madrid's Karim Benzema in the scoring charts, Espanyol were relegated. But after losing Benzema as a free agent, Madrid bolstered their attacking options by signing Joselu on loan as cover for their more celebrated forwards.\n\nYet he now ends the season as a Madrid hero, one win from ultimate glory for Los Blancos.\n\nPrediction\n\nEverything points to Real winning their 15th European Cup/Champions League. It will take the performance of their lives for Dortmund's players to overturn the odds. They have a fighter's chance and will be backed by some of the most passionate supporters in Europe.\n\nBut Real Madrid are the kings of the Champions League, and it's almost impossible see anything other than white ribbons on the trophy once again.\n\nReal to win 3-0."
