THE FOUR UEFA CUP FINALS IN INTER'S HISTORY

UEFA CUP 1990/1991 - Inter 2-0 Roma; Roma 1-0 Inter

From one European capital to another. From Vienna to Rome. The Nerazzurri’s joiner in the 1990/91 UEFA Cup started with a defeat and ended with a defeat, but they still lifted the trophy at the end. Trapattoni’s team lost their first game 2-1 away at Rapid Vienna, starting their love for European comebacks. After extra time in the second leg at San Siro, Inter won 3-1 thanks to a vital Berti brace. They then saw of Aston Villa: 2-0 loss in Birmingham but then a magnificent 3-0 win in the home leg. They then beat Partizan Belgrade and Atalanta, before knocking out Sporting CP in the semi-final: 0-0 away, 2-0 at San Siro. The final took place over two legs, it was a tense affair against Italian rivals Roma. Matthäus and Berti gave the Nerazzurri the lead after the first leg at San Siro and a goal from Rizzitelli at the Olimpico wasn’t enough for the Giallorossi to overturn the result. Beppe Bergomi lifted Inter’s first ever UEFA Cup trophy in Rome. A historic win.

It had been a wonderful ride until the final, which deserved a trophy at San Siro in front of the home crows. From the 3-0 win away at Guingamp, with Ganz straight away looking a talent - he finished the season as the competitions top scorer. Inter needed extra time and penalties to get past Casino Graz, but the quarter-final against Boavista was a relative walk in the park. We eliminated Anderlecht in the quarters and Monaco in the semi-final, with a 3-1 win in the first leg and 1-0 in the second. Thus, we made it to the final, the last ever to be played over two legs.

UEFA Cup 1997/1998 - Lazio 0-3 Inter

As soon as the 1998 UEFA Cup is mentioned, you immediately remember those timeless images, which have gone down in Inter history. The horizontal stripes, Ronaldo’s goals in the freezing cold of Moscow, the perfect game at the Parc des Princes. The Boys of 98, as they still call each other, the figures in that win, in the form of Gigi Simoni, to whom we said goodbye not long ago. Ronaldo was unstoppable. Neuchatel were the first victims, then the comeback against Lyon. Another French side and another comeback: 2-0 defeat in Strasbourg, historic 3-0 at San Siro thanks to Ronaldo, Zanetti and Simeone. The quarter-final saw a rematch of the 1997 final. This time, Schalke bowed out to West's goal in extra time. In the semi-finals, Ronaldo painted one of his most beautiful masterpieces, in the mud in Moscow. In Paris, in the final (the first played as a single game), it was Inter's domain: against Lazio, the goals from Zamorano, Zanetti and Ronaldo gave Inter their third UEFA Cup win and the first trophy of the Moratti era.
