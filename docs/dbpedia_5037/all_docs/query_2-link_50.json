Thermally powered refrigeration technologies are classified into two categories: thermo-mechanical technology and sorption technology (open systems or closed systems). This paper provides a detailed review of the solar closed sorption (absorption and adsorption) refrigeration systems, which utilise working pairs (fluids). After an introduction of the basic principles of these systems, the history of development and recent advances in solar sorption refrigeration technologies are reported. The adsorption cooling typically has a lower heat source temperature requirement than the absorption cooling. Based on the coefficient of performance (COP), the absorption systems are preferred over the adsorption systems, and the higher temperature issues can be easily handled with solar adsorption systems. The thermodynamic properties of most common working fluids, as well as the use of ternary mixtures in solar-powered absorption systems, have been reviewed in this study. The paper also refers to new approaches to increase the efficiency and sustainability of the basic adsorption cycles, such as the development of hybrid or thermal energy storage adsorption systems. This research shows that solar-powered closed sorption refrigeration technologies can be attractive alternatives not only to serve the needs for air-conditioning, refrigeration, ice making, thermal\n\nSolarChill - a solar PV refrigerator without battery\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nPedersen, P.H.; Poulsen, S.; Katic, I. [Danish Technological Inst., Taastrup (Denmark)\n\n2004-07-01\n\nA solar powered refrigerator (SolarChill) has been developed in an international project involving Greenpeace International, GTZ, UNICEF, UNEP, WHO, industrial partners and Danish Technological Institute. The refrigerator is able to operate directly on solar PV panels, without battery or additional electronics, and is therefore suitable for locations where little maintenance and reliable operation is mandatory. The main objective of the SolarChill Project is to help deliver vaccines and refrigeration to the rural poor. To achieve this objective, the SolarChill Project developed - and plans to make freely available a versatile refrigeration technology that is environmentally sound, technologically reliable, and affordable. SolarChill does not use any fluorocarbons in its cooling system or in the insulation. For domestic and small business applications, another type of solar refrigerator is under development. This is an upright type, suitable for cool storage of food and beverages in areas where grid power is non-existent or unstable. The market potential for this type is thus present in industrialised countries as well as in countries under development. The unique feature of SolarChill is that energy is stored in ice instead of in batteries. An ice compartment keeps the cabinet at desired temperatures during the night. The paper describes the product development, possible SolarChill applications and experience with the two types of solar refrigerators, as well as results from the laboratory and field test.

These machines have already proved their capability in laboratory or in space refrigeration. Previous studies have also demonstrated the possibility of using concentrated solar energy as thermal energy sources for low power heat driven thermoacoustic refrigerators. As other solar refrigeration systems, even if the cooling demand generally increases with the intensity of the solar radiation, one of the major difficulties is to insure a frigorific power supply when there is no, or low, solar radiation. The aim of this work is to study a kW scale solar thermoacoustic refrigerator capable to reach temperatures of the industrial refrigeration domain. This refrigerator is combined with a latent cold storage in order to guarantee a sufficient cooling capacity to face to refrigeration loads in spite of the production fluctuations. A description of the studied prototype is done and the model developed to describe the transient behaviour of the main components of this machine is introduced. The results obtained with a simulation of one week with real solar radiations are presented and the behaviour and the energetic performances of the entire system are analysed. Finally the impact of the sizing of the cold storage system is discussed. With the best storage design, the system is capable to supply a cooling power of 400Â W at a temperature equal or lower thanÂ â20Â Â°C with an average Coefficient Of Performance of the solar thermoacoustic refrigerator equal to 21%\n\nThe performance of the first Jordan Badia's solar powered refrigerator\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMohammed Awwad Al-Dabbas\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe are facing a significant challenge in Jordan's Badia region. Such challenge present us given that it will be environmentally protected with easy access to the refrigeration process to food and medical vaccines keeping at a reasonably and economical low cost. Solar cooling method that is generated from the sun as a substitute for batteries or electrical power is characteristic of its kind to store a power system for continued use. A pilot project of solar refrigerator was tested to collect technological data on a standard basis so the method control tests are accurate and precise. Solar refrigerator does not require electricity, which utilizes a combination of heat conduction and convection. In addition, it can be made from readily available material such as cardboard, sand, and recycled metal. It is constructed from two cylinders: an inner metal cylinder, fitted inside, and an outer cylinder that can be made of wood or plastic, etc, and organic material such as (sand, wool, or soil) placed in the left space between the two cylinders which is then saturated with water. As heat from the sun evaporates the water, the inner chamber is cooled to reduce and maintains the temperature at (6 degree C).

The question remains: Can solar refrigerators provide value where electrical outages are less frequent? Using a HERMES-generated computational model of the Mozambique routine immunization supply chain, we simulated the use of solar versus electric mains-powered refrigerators (hereafter referred to as \"electric refrigerators\") at different locations in the supply chain under various circumstances. At their current price premium, the annual cost of each solar refrigerator is 132% more than each electric refrigerator at the district level and 241% more at health facilities.

Our study supports WHO and Gavi guidelines. In fact, solar refrigerators may provide savings in total cost per dose administered over electrical refrigerators when electrical outages are less frequent.

Hand-held or carried in vehicle can be powered by solar energy in places without power. In the evenings or rainy days, it is powered by storage battery, and it can be directly powered by alternating current (AC power supply if available, and the storage battery can be charged full as a backup supply. The proposed system was tested by the alternation of solar irradiance 550 to 700âW/m2 as solar energy and 500ml ambient temperature water as cooling load. After 160 minutes, the proposal refrigerator can maintain the temperature at 5â8Â°C, and the coefficient of performance (COP of NH3-H2O absorption refrigeration system is about 0.25. Therefore, this system can be expected to be used in remote areas for refrigeration of food and beverages in outdoor activities in remote and desert areas or long-distance road transportation of food or low temperature refrigeration of vaccine to avoid the deterioration of the food or the vaccines.\n\nNumerical approach to solar ejector-compression refrigeration system\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nZheng Hui-Fan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available A model was established for solar ejector-compression refrigeration system.

It is known that activated alumina shows a higher adsorption capacity when it is tested in the laboratory using a constant radiation heat flux. In this study, solar-powered adsorption refrigeration cycle with generator filled by different adsorbents has been tested by exposing to solar radiation in Medan city of Indonesia. The generator is heated using a flat-plate type solar collector with a dimension of 0.5Â mÃ0.5Â m. Four cases experiments of solar-powered adsorption cycle were carried out, they are with generator filled by 100% activated alumina (named as 100AA, by a mixed of 75% activated alumina and 25% activated carbon (75AA, by a mixed of 25% activated alumina and 75% activated carbon (25AA, and filled by 100% activated carbon. Each case was tested for three days. The temperature and pressure history and the performance have been presented and analyzed. The results show that the average COP of 100AA, 75AA, 25AA, and 100AC is 0.054, 0.056, 0.06, and 0.074, respectively. The main conclusion can be drawn is that for Indonesian condition and flat-plate type solar collector the pair of activated carbon and methanol is the better than activated alumina.\n\nExperimental study of refrigeration performance based on linear Fresnel solar thermal photovoltaic system\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSong, Jinghui; Yuan, Hui; Xia, Yunfeng; Kan, Weimin; Deng, Xiaowen; Liu, Shi; Liang, Wanlong; Deng, Jianhua\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThis paper introduces the working principle and system constitution of the linear Fresnel solar lithium bromide absorption refrigeration cycle, and elaborates several typical structures of absorption refrigeration cycle, including single-effect, two-stage cycle and double-effect lithium bromide absorption refrigeration cycle A 1.n effect absorption chiller system based on the best parameters was introduced and applied to a linear Fresnel solar absorption chiller system.

Among the main done currently research is the use of free source to make operate system of refrigeration. following a bibliographic study on the absorption cycles, the utilized couples absorbents-refrigerating fluids and the capture of the solar energy, an unit refrigeration using an improved solar absorption cycle of ammonia has been conceived and studied. The simulation results in permanent regime concerned the determination of the variation of the performance criteria mainly according to the operatives kept for this study. The obtained results showed, that the improved mono pressure absorption cycle of ammonia is suitable well for the cold production by means of the solar energy and that with a simple plate collector we can reach a power, of the order of 900 watts sufficient for domestic use.(Author)\n\nDevelopment of a Battery-Free Solar Refrigerator\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEwert, Michael K.; Bergeron, David J., III\n\n2000-01-01\n\nRecent technology developments and a systems engineering design approach have led to the development of a practical battery-free solar refrigerator as a spin-off of NASA's aerospace refrigeration research. Off-grid refrigeration is a good application of solar photovoltaic (PV) power if thermal storage is incorporated and a direct connection is made between the cooling system and the PV panel. This was accomplished by integrating water as a phase-change material into a well insulated refrigerator cabinet and by developing a microprocessor based control system that allows direct connection of a PV panel to a variable speed compressor. This second innovation also allowed peak power-point tracking from the PV panel and elimination of batteries from the system. First a laboratory unit was developed to prove the concept and then a commercial unit was produced and deployed in a field test. The laboratory unit was used to test many different configurations including thermoelectric, Stirling and vapor compression cooling systems. The final configuration used a vapor compression cooling cycle, vacuum insulation, a passive condenser, an integral evaporator/ thermal storage tank, two 77 watt PV panels and the novel controller mentioned above. The system's only moving part was the variable speed BD35 compressor made by Danfoss. The 365 liter cabinet stayed cold with as little as 274 watt-hours per day average PV power. Battery-free testing was conducted for several months with very good results. The amount of thermal storage, size of compressor and power of PV panels connected can all be adjusted to optimize the design for a given application and climate. In the commercial unit, the high cost of the vacuum insulated refrigerator cabinet and the stainless steel thermal storage tank were addressed in an effort to make the technology commercially viable. This unit started with a 142 liter, mass-produced chest freezer cabinet that had the evaporator integrated into its inner walls\n\nStructure optimization and performance experiments of a solar-powered finned-tube adsorption refrigeration system\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJi, Xu; Li, Ming; Fan, Jieqing; Zhang, Peng; Luo, Bin; Wang, Liuling\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ New-structure finned-tube adsorption bed for enhancing heat and mass transfer. â¢ Temperatures on different parts of the adsorption tubes differ little. â¢ Maximum COP of 0.122 and maximum daily ice-making of 6.5 kg are achieved by experiments. â¢ Cooling efficiency of system with valve control higher than that without valve control. - Abstract: A large-diameter aluminum-alloy finned-tube absorbent bed collector was designed and optimized by enhancing the heat and mass transfer in the collector. The collection efficiency of the adsorbent bed collector was between 31.64% and 42.7%, and the temperature distribution in the absorbent bed was relatively uniform, beneficial to adsorption/desorption of the adsorbate in the absorbent bed. A solar-powered solid adsorption refrigeration system with the finned-tube absorbent bed collector was built. Some experiments corresponding to the adsorption/desorption process with and without a valve control were conducted in four typical weather conditions: sunny with clear sky, sunny with partly cloudy sky, cloudy sky and overcast sky. Activated carbonâmethanol was utilized as the working pair for adsorption refrigeration in the experiments. The experiments achieved the maximum COP of 0.122 and the maximum daily ice-making of 6.5 kg. Under the weather conditions of sunny with clear sky, sunny with partly cloudy sky, and cloudy sky, ice-making phenomenon were observed. Even in the overcast-sky weather condition, the cooling efficiency of the system still reached 0.039 when the total solar radiation was 11.51 MJ. The cooling efficiency of the solar-powered adsorption refrigeration system with a valve control in the adsorption/desorption process was significantly higher than that without a valve control\n\nSome comments about the comparison between a conventional and a solar powered absorption refrigeration system\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCorbella, O.D.; Garibotti, C.R.\n\n1983-08-01\n\nTwo statements about the performance of solar refrigeration systems are discussed.

Refrigerant molecules are adsorbed on the high surface area of the nanostructural material while the material is at a relatively low temperature, perhaps at night. During daylight hours, when the nanostructural materials is heated by the sun, the refrigerant are thermally desorbed from the surface of the aerogel, thereby creating a pressurized gas phase in the vessel that contains the aerogel. This solar-driven pressurization forces the heated gaseous refrigerant through a condenser, followed by an expansion valve. In the condenser, heat is removed from the refrigerant, first by circulating air or water. Eventually, the cooled gaseous refrigerant expands isenthalpically through a throttle valve into an evaporator, in a fashion similar to that in more conventional vapor recompression systems.\n\nIEA SHC Task 38 'Solar air-conditioning and refrigeration'.

The water/LiBr machine satisfies the air-conditioning needs along the day. The refrigerator performances were simulated regarding a dynamic model. For the solar driven absorption machines, two applications could be distinguished. The sun provides the thermal part of the useful energy. In this case, it is necessary to use additional energy as the electric one to activate the pumps, the fans and the control system. On the other hand, the sun provides all the necessary energy. Here, both photovoltaic cells and thermal concentrators should be used. The simulation in dynamic regime of the cycle requires the knowledge of the geometric characteristics of every component as the exchange areas and the internal volumes. Real characteristics of a refrigerator available at the applied thermodynamic research unit (ATRU) at the engineers' national school of Gabes are notified. The development of the thermal and matter balances in every component of the cycle has permitted to simulate in dynamic regime the performances of a solar absorption refrigerator operating with the water/LiBr couple for air-conditioning needs. The developed model could be used to perform intermittent refrigeration cycle autonomously driven.

The biggest potential for savings is in the peripheral components, as well as in the operating cost and especially in servicing. Cost reduction must have priority if solar refrigeration is to be successful in the market. In the context of the European research project ''Reduction of costs of Solar Cooling systems'' (Rococo), a team of scientists from France, Spain and Austria investigated existing systems. (orig.)\n\nCost-effective and reliable design of a solar thermal power plant\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAliabadi, A.A.; Wallace, J.S.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA design study was conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of solar thermal power generation in a 50 kWe power plant that could be used in a remote location. The system combines a solar collector-thermal storage system utilizing a heat transfer fluid and a simple Rankine cycle power generator utilizing R123 refrigerant. Evacuated tube solar collectors heat mineral oil and supply it to a thermal storage tank. A mineral oil to refrigerant heat exchanger generates superheated refrigerant vapor, which drives a radial turbogenerator. Supplemental natural gas firing maintains a constant thermal storage temperature irregardless of solar conditions enabling the system to produce a constant 50 kWe output. A simulation was carried out to predict the performance of the system in the hottest summer day and the coldest winter day for southern California solar conditions. A rigorous economic analysis was conducted. The system offers advantages over advanced solar thermal power plants by implementing simple fixed evacuated tube collectors, which are less prone to damage in harsh desert environment. Also, backed up by fossil fuel power generation, it is possible to obtain continued operation even during low insolation sky conditions and at night, a feature that stand-alone PV systems do not offer.

S.; Singh, Dharmendra; Gupta, Pankaj Kumar\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe solar photovoltaic (PV) panel driven refrigeration system employs solar PV panel and play a vital role when combined with storage batteries. The variation in performance of solar PV panel driven refrigeration system has been experimentally investigated in this paper. The change in battery voltage is analyzed with respect to panel size. Different series and parallel combinations have been applied on four solar PV panels of 35W each to get 24V. With the above combination a current in the range of 3-5 ampere has been obtained depending upon the solar intensity. A refrigerator of 110 W and 50 liters is used in the present investigation which requires 0.80 ampere AC at 230 V. The required current and voltage has been obtained from an inverter which draws about 7 ampere DC from the battery bank at 24V. The compressor of the refrigerator consumed 110W which required a PV panel size of 176 W approximately. It is important to note that the compressor consumed about 300W for first 50 milliseconds, 130 W for next five seconds and gradually comes to 110 W in 65 seconds. Thus panel size should be such that it may compensate for the initial load requirement.\n\nExperimental System of Solar Adsorption Refrigeration with Concentrated Collector.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYuan, Z X; Li, Y X; Du, C X\n\n2017-10-18\n\nTo improve the performance of solar adsorption refrigeration, an experimental system with a solar concentration collector was set up and investigated. The main components of the system were the adsorbent bed, the condenser, the evaporator, the cooling sub-system, and the solar collector. In the first step of the experiment, the vapor-saturated bed was heated by the solar radiation under closed conditions, which caused the bed temperature and pressure to increase. When the bed pressure became high enough, the bed was switched to connect to the condenser, thus water vapor flowed continually from the bed to the condenser to be liquefied. Next, the bed needed to cool down after the desorption. In the solar-shielded condition, achieved by aluminum foil, the circulating water loop was opened to the bed. With the water continually circulating in the bed, the stored heat in the bed was took out and the bed pressure decreased accordingly. When the bed pressure dropped below the saturation pressure at the evaporation temperature, the valve to the evaporator was opened. A mass of water vapor rushed into the bed and was adsorbed by the zeolite material. With the massive vaporization of the water in the evaporator, the refrigeration effect was generated finally. The experimental result has revealed that both the COP (coefficient of the performance of the system) and the SCP (specific cooling power of the system) of the SAPO-34 zeolite was greater than that of the ZSM-5 zeolite, no matter whether the adsorption time was longer or shorter. The system of the SAPO-34 zeolite generated a maximum COP of 0.169.\n\nOptimization of a solar driven absorption refrigerator in the transient regime\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHamed, Mouna; Fellah, Ali; Ben Brahim, Ammar\n\n2012-01-01\n\nHighlights: âº Dynamic behavior of a solar absorption refrigerator endoreversible model. âº Using the principles of classical thermodynamics, mass and heat transfers. âº Minimizing heat exchange time to reach maximum performances. âº Major influence of the collector temperature on the modelâs characteristics. âº Analogous effects of both the thermal load and the thermal conductance. -- Abstract: This contribution deals with the theoretical study in dynamic mode of an absorption refrigerator endoreversible model. The system is a cold generating station driven by solar energy. The main elements of the cycle are a refrigerated space, an absorption refrigerator and a solar collector form. A mathematical model is developed. It combines the classical thermodynamics and mass and heat transfers principles. The numerical simulation is made for different operating and conceptual conditions. A global minimizing time optimization is performed in view to reach maximum performances. Appropriate dimensionless groups are defined. The results are presented in normalized charts for general applications. The collector temperature presents major influence on the conceptual and functional characteristics compared to the stagnation temperature influence. On the other hand the thermal load in the refrigerated space and the thermal conductance of the walls has analogous effects, therefore important to be considered in actual design. As a result, the model is expected to be a useful tool for simulation, design, and optimization of solar collector based energy systems.\n\nSolar Power System SPS - A small-scale 10 kWe solar thermal pilot power plant - Phase 5. Annual report 2003; Solar Power System SPS - Projet d'une mini-centrale pilote electro-thermo-solaire de 10 kWe - Phase 5. Rapport annuel 2003\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGiroud, P.-A.; Gay, B.; Favrat, D.\n\n2003-12-15\n\nThis illustrated annual report for the Swiss Federal Office of Energy reports on the development of components for a 10 kW electric solar thermal mini power plant. The concentrating solar collector is designed as an extra-flat compound parabolic collector without any evacuated component. The solar collector performance measurements are described. The results obtained with this collector prototype are disappointing. Further improvements in the collector construction are needed. A computer simulation model has been developed for this purpose. In another development the instrumentation built in the pilot power plant has been modified in order to be able to characterize the thermal performance of the heat exchangers in the thermodynamical cycle, to measure the oil fraction in the refrigerant and to test the performance of the R245fa refrigerant used instead of the R123. Finally, a new pump has been developed for the circulation of the refrigerant. This pump is mounted on the same axis as the the turbine. Special technologies and materials were required.\n\nDevelopment of a battery-free solar refrigerator\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nEwert, Michael K; Bergeron, David J. III [Houston, TX (United States)\n\n2000-07-01\n\nRecent technology developments and a systems engineering design approach have led to the development of a practical battery-free solar refrigerator as a spin-off of NASA's aerospace refrigeration research. Off-grid refrigeration is a good application of solar photovoltaic (PV) power thermal storage is incorporated and a direct connection is made between the cooling system and the PV panel. This was accomplished by integrating water as a phase-change material into a well-insulated refrigerator cabinet and by developing a microprocessor-based control system that allows direct connection of a PV panel to a variable-speed compressor. This second innovation also allowed peak power-point tracking from the PV panel and elimination of batteries from the system. First a laboratory unit was developed to prove the concept and then a commercial unit was produced and deployed in a field test. The laboratory unit was used to test many different configurations including thermoelectric., Stirling and vapor compression cooling systems. The final configuration used a vapor compression cooling cycle, vacuum insulation, a passive condenser, and integral evaporator/thermal storage tank, two 77 watt PV panels, and the novel controller mentioned above. The system's only moving part was the variable-speed BD35 compressor made by Danfoss. The 365 liter cabinet stayed cold with as a little as 274 watt-hours per day average PV power. Battery-free testing was conducted for several months with very good results. The amount of thermal storage, size of compressor, and power of PV panels connected can all be adjusted to optimize the design for a given application and climate. In the commercial unit, vacuum insulation and the stainless steel thermal storage tank were not used in order to reduce cost and make the technology commercially viable. This unit started with a 142 liter, mass-produced chest freezer cabinet that had the evaporator integrated into its inner walls. Its compressor\n\nExergy analysis, parametric analysis and optimization for a novel combined power and ejector refrigeration cycle\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDai Yiping; Wang Jiangfeng; Gao Lin\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA new combined power and refrigeration cycle is proposed, which combines the Rankine cycle and the ejector refrigeration cycle. This combined cycle produces both power output and refrigeration output simultaneously. It can be driven by the flue gas of gas turbine or engine, solar energy, geothermal energy and industrial waste heats. An exergy analysis is performed to guide the thermodynamic improvement for this cycle. And a parametric analysis is conducted to evaluate the effects of the key thermodynamic parameters on the performance of the combined cycle. In addition, a parameter optimization is achieved by means of genetic algorithm to reach the maximum exergy efficiency. The results show that the biggest exergy loss due to the irreversibility occurs in heat addition processes, and the ejector causes the next largest exergy loss. It is also shown that the turbine inlet pressure, the turbine back pressure, the condenser temperature and the evaporator temperature have significant effects on the turbine power output, refrigeration output and exergy efficiency of the combined cycle. The optimized exergy efficiency is 27.10% under the given condition.\n\nDevelopment of a solar-powered residential air conditioner: Screening analysis\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n1975-01-01\n\nScreening analysis aimed at the definition of an optimum configuration of a Rankine cycle solar-powered air conditioner designed for residential application were conducted. Initial studies revealed that system performance and cost were extremely sensitive to condensing temperature and to the type of condenser used in the system. Consequently, the screening analyses were concerned with the generation of parametric design data for different condenser approaches; i. e., (1) an ambient air condenser, (2) a humidified ambient air condenser (3) an evaporative condenser, and (4) a water condenser (with a cooling tower). All systems feature a high performance turbocompressor and a single refrigerant (R-11) for the power and refrigeration loops. Data were obtained by computerized methods developed to permit system characterization over a broad range of operating and design conditions. The criteria used for comparison of the candidate system approaches were (1) overall system COP (refrigeration effect/solar heat input), (2) auxiliary electric power for fans and pumps, and (3) system installed cost or cost to the user.\n\nSolar driven air conditioning and refrigeration systems corresponding to various heating source temperatures\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWang, R.Z.; Xu, Z.Y.; Pan, Q.W.; Du, S.; Xia, Z.Z.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ Modular silica gelâwater adsorption chiller was designed and tested. â¢ Single/double effect LiBrâwater absorption chiller was operated and tested. â¢ 1.n effect LiBrâwater absorption chiller was proposed, designed and tested. â¢ CaCl_2/ACâammonia adsorption refrigerator was introduced and tested. â¢ NH_3âH_2O absorption ice maker with better internal heat recovery was introduced. - Abstract: Solar driven air conditioning systems can cope with solar collectors working in a wide range of temperatures. Sorption systems, including absorption and adsorption refrigeration systems, are among the best choices for solar cooling. Five systems including modular silica gelâwater adsorption chiller, single/double effect LiBrâwater absorption chiller, 1.n effect LiBrâwater absorption chiller, CaCl_2/AC (activated carbon)âammonia adsorption refrigerator, and the waterâammonia absorption ice maker with better internal heat recovery were presented. The above five sorption chillers/refrigerators work under various driven temperatures and fulfill different refrigeration demands. The thermodynamic design and system development of the systems were shown. All these systems have improvements in comparison with existing systems and may offer good options for high efficient solar cooling in the near future.\n\nIntermittent Solar Ammonia Absorption Cycle (ISAAC) refrigeration for lesser developed countries\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nErickson, Donald C.\n\n1990-02-01\n\nThe Intermittent Solar Ammonia Absorption Cycle (ISAAC) refrigerator is a solar thermal technology which provides low cost, efficient, reliable ice-making to areas without ready access to electricity. An ISAAC refrigeration system consists of a compound parabolic solar collector, two pressure vessels, a condenser, a cold box or refrigerated space, and simple connective piping -- no moving parts or electrical components. Most parts are simple construction or plumbing grade materials, locally available in many remote areas. This technology has numerous potential benefits in lesser developed countries both by providing a cheap, reliable source of ice, and, since manufacture requires only semi-skilled labor, a source of employment to the local economy. Applications include vaccine storage for health care clinics; fish, meat, and dairy product storage; and personal consumption. Importantly, this technology increases the quality of life for people in lesser developed countries without depleting fossil fuel resources or increasing the release of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and chlorofluorocarbons.\n\nPower Consumption in Refrigeration Systems - Modeling for Optimization\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHovgaard, Tobias Gybel; Larsen, Lars F. S.; Skovrup, Morten Juel\n\n2011-01-01\n\nRefrigeration systems consume a substantial amount of energy. Taking for instance supermarket refrigeration systems as an example they can account for up to 50â80% of the total energy consumption in the supermarket. Due to the thermal capacity made up by the refrigerated goods in the system...... there is a possibility for optimizing the power consumption by utilizing load shifting strategies. This paper describes the dynamics and the modeling of a vapor compression refrigeration system needed for sufficiently realistic estimation of the power consumption and its minimization. This leads to a non-convex function...... with possibly multiple extrema. Such a function can not directly be optimized by standard methods and a qualitative analysis of the systemâs constraints is presented. The description of power consumption contains nonlinear terms which are approximated by linear functions in the control variables and the error...\n\nThermodynamic, Environmental and Economic Analyses of Solar Ejector Refrigeration System Application for Cold Storage\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÄ°brahim ÃÃGÃL\n\n2009-02-01\n\nFull Text Available The refrigeration processes have been widely applied for especially in cold storages. In these plants, the systems working with compressed vapour cooling cycles have been used as a classical method. In general, electrical energy is used for compressing in these processes. Although, mainly the electricity itself has no pollution effect on the environment, the fossil fuels that are widely used to produce electricity in the most of the world, affect the nature terribly. In short, these refrigeration plants, because of the source of the electricity pollute the nature indirectly. However, for compression an ejector refrigeration system requires one of the important renewable energy sources with negligible pollution impact on the environment, namely solar energy from a thermal source. Thermodynamical, environmental and economical aspects of the ejector refrigeration system working with solar energy was investigated in this study. As a pilot case, apple cold storage plants widely used in ISPARTA city, which 1/5 th of apple production of TURKEY has been provided from, was chosen.

For the typical building cooling load, the system can handle the zone cooling load (mainly sensible) by radiant cooling with the chilled water from absorption refrigeration, while the ventilation load (largely latent) by desiccant dehumidification. This hybrid system utilizes solar energy for driving the absorption chiller and regenerating the desiccant wheel. Since a high chilled water temperature generated from the absorption chiller is not effective to handle the required latent load, desiccant dehumidification is therefore involved. It is an integration of radiant cooling, absorption refrigeration and desiccant dehumidification, which are powered up by solar energy. In this study, the application potential of the solar hybrid cooling system was evaluated for the high-tech offices in the subtropical climate through dynamic simulation. The high-tech offices are featured with relatively high internal sensible heat gains due to the intensive office electric equipment. The key performance indicators included the solar fraction and the primary energy consumption. Comparative study was also carried out for the solar hybrid cooling system using two common types of chilled ceilings, the passive chilled beams and active chilled beams. It was found that the solar hybrid cooling system was technically feasible for the applications of relatively higher cooling load demand.

However, its negative impact on the environment have forced the energy research continuity to seriously consider renewable sources of energy. Solar energy, in particular, has been the main focus in this regard because it is a source of clean energy and naturally available. This study presents the design and analysis of a solar powered absorption refrigeration system modified to increase its coefficient of performance (COP). The modifications include recovering of waste heat from a dephlegmator and utilization of a refrigerant storage unit. The simulation results indicate an increase of 10% in the COP of the conventional design using dephlegmator heat recovery and an increase of 8% in the COP of the conventional design due to the use of a refrigerant storage. The analysis for the combined effect of modifications indicates an increase of 18% in the COP compared to conventional design. Calculated values of coefficient of performance indicate a very good agreement with the ones obtained based on measurement\n\nComparative Study on Solar Collectorâs Configuration for an Ejector-Refrigeration Cycle\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRaffles Senjaya\n\n2008-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Solar collectorâs configuration plays important role on solar-powered refrigeration systems to work as heat source for generator. Three types of solar collector consisting of flat plate, evacuated tube, and compound parabolic solar collectors are compared to investigate their performances. The performances consist of the behavior of heat which can be absorbed by the collectors, heat loss from the collectors and outlet temperature of working fluid at several slopes of the solar collectors. The new accurate analysis method of heat transfer is conducted to predict the performance of the solar collectors. The analysis is based on several assumptions, i.e. sky condition at Bandung is clear and not raining from 08.00 until 17.00 and thermal resistance at cover and absorber plate is negligible. The numerical calculation results confirm that performance of the evacuated tubes solar collector at the same operating conditions is higher than the others. For the case of an evacuated-tubes solar collector system with aperture area of 3.5 m2, the maximum heat which can be absorbed is 3992 W for the highest solar intensity of 970 W/m2 at 12.00 and horizontal position of the solar collector. At this condition, the highest outlet temperature of water is 347.15 K with mass flow rate 0.02 kg/s and inlet temperature 298 K.\n\nParametric analysis and optimization for a combined power and refrigeration cycle\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWang Jiangfeng; Dai Yiping; Gao Lin\n\n2008-01-01\n\nA combined power and refrigeration cycle is proposed, which combines the Rankine cycle and the absorption refrigeration cycle. This combined cycle uses a binary ammonia-water mixture as the working fluid and produces both power output and refrigeration output simultaneously with only one heat source. A parametric analysis is conducted to evaluate the effects of thermodynamic parameters on the performance of the combined cycle. It is shown that heat source temperature, environment temperature, refrigeration temperature, turbine inlet pressure, turbine inlet temperature, and basic solution ammonia concentration have significant effects on the net power output, refrigeration output and exergy efficiency of the combined cycle. A parameter optimization is achieved by means of genetic algorithm to reach the maximum exergy efficiency.

Vieira\n\n1997-09-01\n\nFull Text Available This work presents the principles of operation of a solar refrigerator with the following basic components: a reactor, a set of evacuated tube solar collectors, a condenser, a heat exchanger, and an evaporator. During the heating phase, solar radiation is collected and transferred to the reactor for desorption by a vapor thermal siphon loop. During the cooling phase, heat from the reactor is released to the ambient by a second water vapor loop. Ambient data collected daily during a period of 18 years were divided into hourly values and used to simulate the temperatures of the reactor, which uses salt impregnated with graphite and ammonia, during the adsorption / desorption processes. The results show that the refrigerator operates well in Fortaleza and that better results are expected for the countryside of the state of Ceara. It is concluded that only a high efficiency collector set can be used in the system\n\nPerformance Analysis of Solar Combined Ejector-Vapor Compression Cycle Using Environmental Friendly Refrigerants\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA.

This work aims at studying the thermodynamic mechanism of the hybrid refrigeration cycle. Two fundamental concepts have been proposed, which are the ultimate refrigerating temperature (or the ultimate temperature lift) and the behavior turning. On the basis of that, the interaction mechanism of compressor pressure increasing with other key-parameters and the impact of compressor pressure increasing on the cycle performance have been investigated. The key-parameters include the concentration difference, the circulation ratio of working fluid, etc. The work points out that the hybrid refrigeration cycle performance varies with the change of compressor outlet pressure and depends on which one achieves dominance in the hybrid refrigeration cycle, the absorption sub-system or the compression sub-system. The behavior turning point during parameters changing corresponds to a maximum value of the heat powered coefficient of performance. In this case, the hybrid refrigeration cycle performance is optimal because the low-grade heat utilization is the most effective. In addition, to validate the theoretical analysis, a solar hybrid refrigeration cycle with R134aâDMF as working pair was simulated. The PengâRobinson equation of state was adopted to calculate thermophysical properties when the reliability assessment of the prediction models on the available literature data of R134aâDMF system had been\n\nInter-cooler in solar-assisted refrigeration system: Theory and experimental verification\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nZheng Hui-Fan\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available An inter-cooler in the solar-assisted refrigeration system was investigated experimentally and theoretically, and the theoretical prediction was fairly in good agreement with the experimental data. The influence of pipe diameter, tooth depth, and spiral angle of inter-cooler on the performance of the refrigerant system was analyzed.

However due to the environmental regulations, the use of classic refrigerants: F-gases is limited by international agreements. Therefore the combined compression-adsorption hybrid cycle with natural liquids: water/carbon dioxide working as the energy carriers is a promising solution. This allows to utilize the solar or waste energy for the refrigeration purpose. In this paper application of the solar collectors as the energy source for the adsorption cycle, coupled with the low temperature (LT refrigerating carbon dioxide compression cycle is shown. The control of the system is an essential issue to reduce the electric power consumption. The control of the solar heat supply and water sprayed cooling tower, for the adsorption cycle re-cooling, is presented in this paper. The designed control system and algorithm is related to the LT compression cycle, which operates according to the need of cold for the refrigeration chamber. The results of the laboratory investigations of the full system, showing the reduction of the energy consumption and maximum utilization of the solar heat for different control methods are presented.\n\nExperimental study on a resorption system for power and refrigeration cogeneration\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJiang, L.; Wang, L.W.; Liu, C.Z.; Wang, R.Z.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEnergy conversion technologies, especially for power generation and refrigeration technologies driven by the low temperature heat, are gathering the momentum recently. This paper presents a novel resorption system for electricity and refrigeration cogeneraion. Compared with adsorption refrigeration system, resorption refrigeration is characterized as safety and simple structure since there is no ammonia liquid in the system. The cogeneration system is mainly composed of three HTS (high temperature salt) unit beds; three LTS (low temperature salts) unit beds, one expander, three ammonia valves, two oil valves, four water valves and connection pipes. Chemical working pair of MnCl 2 âCaCl 2 âNH 3 is selected. Since scroll expander is suitable for small type power generation system, it is chosen for expansion process. 4.8Â kg MnCl 2 and 3.9Â kg CaCl 2 impregnated in expanded natural graphite treated with sulfuric acid (ENG-TSA) are filled in the cogeneration system. Experimental results show that maximum cooling power 2.98Â kW is able to be obtained while maximum shaft power is about 253Â W with 82.3Â W average value. The cogeneration system can be utilized for the heat source temperature lower than 170Â Â°C.

Under the tight coupling conditions, we have calculated the universal COP bounds under the Ï figure of merit in different operating regions. When the refrigerator operates in the region with lower external flux, we obtained the general bounds (0 present large values, compared to a relative small loss from the maximum cooling power. If the cooling power is the main objective, it is desirable to operate the refrigerator at a slightly lower cooling power than at the maximum one, where a small loss in the cooling power induces a much larger COP enhancement.\n\nInvestigation on an innovative cascading cycle for power and refrigeration cogeneration\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJiang, Long; Lu, Huitong; Wang, Ruzhu; Wang, Liwei; Gong, Lixia; Lu, Yiji; Roskilly, Anthony Paul\n\n2017-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ A novel cascading cycle for power and refrigeration cogeneration is proposed and investigated. â¢ Pumpless ORC and sorption refrigeration cycle act as the first and second stage. â¢ The highest power and refrigeration output are able to reach 232 W and 4.94 kW, respectively. â¢ The exergy efficiency of heat utilization ranges from 30.1% to 41.8%. - Abstract: In order to further realize efficient utilization of low grade heat, an innovative cascading cycle for power and refrigeration cogeneration is proposed. Pumpless Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) acts as the first stage, and the refrigerant R245fa is selected as the working fluid. Sorption refrigeration cycle serves as the second stage in which silica-gel/LiCl composite sorbent is developed for the improved sorption characteristic. The concerning experimental system is established, and different hot water inlet temperatures from 75 Â°C to 95 Â°C are adopted to investigate the cogeneration performance. It is indicated that the highest power and refrigeration output are able to reach 232 W and 4.94 kW, respectively under the condition of 95 Â°C hot water inlet temperature, 25 Â°C cooling water temperature and 10 Â°C chilled water outlet temperature. For different working conditions, the total energy and exergy efficiency of the cascading system range from 0.236 to 0.277 and 0.101 to 0.132, respectively. For cascading system the exergy efficiency of heat utilization ranges from 30.1% to 41.8%, which is 144% and 60% higher than that of pumpless ORC and sorption chiller when the hot water inlet temperature is 95 Â°C.\n\nAn optimal power management system for a regenerative auxiliary power system for delivery refrigerator trucks\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMohagheghi Fard, Soheil; Khajepour, Amir\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ A new anti-idling system for refrigerator trucks is proposed. â¢ This system enables regenerative braking. â¢ An innovative two-level controller is proposed for the power management system. â¢ A fast dynamic programming technique to find real-time SOC trajectory is proposed. â¢ In addition to idling elimination, this system reduces fuel consumption. - Abstract: Engine idling of refrigerator trucks during loading and unloading contributes to greenhouse gas emissions due to their increased fuel consumption. This paper proposes a new anti-idling system that uses two sources of power, battery and engine-driven generator, to run the compressor of the refrigeration system. Therefore, idling can be eliminated because the engine is turned OFF and the battery supplies auxiliary power when the vehicle is stopped for loading or unloading. This system also takes advantage of regenerative braking for increased fuel savings. The power management of this system needs to satisfy two requirements: it must minimize fuel consumption in the whole cycle and must ensure that the battery has enough energy for powering the refrigeration system when the engine is OFF. To meet these objectives, a two-level controller is proposed. In the higher level of this controller, a fast dynamic programming technique that utilizes extracted statistical features of drive and duty cycles of a refrigerator truck is used to find suboptimal values of the initial and final SOC of any two consecutive loading/unloading stops. The lower level of the controller employs an adaptive equivalent fuel consumption minimization (A-ECMS) to determine the split ratio of auxiliary power between the generator and battery for each segment with initial and final SOC obtained by the high-level controller. The simulation results confirm that this new system can eliminate idling of refrigerator trucks and reduce their fuel consumption noticeably such that the cost of replacing components is recouped in a\n\nExperimental study on a prototype of heat pipe solar water heater using refrigerant R134a as a transfer fluid\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSitepu, T.; Sembiring, J.; Ambarita, H.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nA prototype of a solar water heater by using refrigerant as a heat transfer fluid is investigated experimentally. The objective is to explore the characteristics and the performance of the prototype. To make heat transfer from the collector to the heated fluid effectively, refrigerant R134a is used as a transfer. In the experiments, the initial pressure inside the heat pipe is varied. The prototype is exposed to solar irradiation in a location in Medan city for three days of the experiment. Solar collector temperatures, solar radiation, water temperature, and ambient temperature are measured. The efficiency of the system is analyzed. The results show that temperature of the hot water increases as the initial pressure of the working fluid increase. However, the increasing is not linear, and there must exist an optimum initial pressure. For the case with the refrigerant pressure of 110 psi, the maximum hot water temperature and maximum thermal efficiency are 45.36oC and 53.23%, respectively. The main conclusion can be drawn here is that solar water heater by using refrigerant R134a should be operated at initial pressure 110 psi.\n\nParametric analysis for a new combined power and ejector-absorption refrigeration cycle\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWang Jiangfeng; Dai Yiping; Zhang Taiyong; Ma Shaolin\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA new combined power and ejector-absorption refrigeration cycle is proposed, which combines the Rankine cycle and the ejector-absorption refrigeration cycle, and could produce both power output and refrigeration output simultaneously. This combined cycle, which originates from the cycle proposed by authors previously, introduces an ejector between the rectifier and the condenser, and provides a performance improvement without greatly increasing the complexity of the system. A parametric analysis is conducted to evaluate the effects of the key thermodynamic parameters on the cycle performance. It is shown that heat source temperature, condenser temperature, evaporator temperature, turbine inlet pressure, turbine inlet temperature, and basic solution ammonia concentration have significant effects on the net power output, refrigeration output and exergy efficiency of the combined cycle. It is evident that the ejector can improve the performance of the combined cycle proposed by authors previously.\n\nExergoeconomic Assessment of Solar Absorption and AbsorptionâCompression Hybrid Refrigeration in Building Cooling\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYue Jing\n\n2018-02-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper mainly deals with the match of solar refrigeration, i.e., solar/natural gas-driven absorption chiller (SNGDAC, solar vapor compressionâabsorption integrated refrigeration system with parallel configuration (SVCAIRSPC, and solar absorption-subcooled compression hybrid cooling system (SASCHCS, and building cooling based on the exergoeconomics. Three types of building cooling are considered: Type 1 is the single-story building, type 2 includes the two-story and three-story buildings, and type 3 is the multi-story buildings. Besides this, two Chinese cities, Guangzhou and Turpan, are taken into account as well. The product cost flow rate is employed as the primary decision variable. The result exhibits that SNGDAC is considered as a suitable solution for type 1 buildings in Turpan, owing to its negligible natural gas consumption and lowest product cost flow rate. SVCAIRSPC is more applicable for type 2 buildings in Turpan because of its higher actual cooling capacity of absorption subsystem and lower fuel and product cost flow rate. Additionally, SASCHCS shows the most extensive cost-effectiveness, namely, its exergy destruction and product cost flow rate are both the lowest when used in all types of buildings in Guangzhou or type 3 buildings in Turpan. This paper is helpful to promote the application of solar cooling.\n\nA passive solar heater-refrigerator\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nD'Isep, F.; Sertorio, L.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nIn this paper it is studied the nonequilibrium thermodynamic steady-state behaviour of a model system representing a core surrounded by an envelope in which the envelope interacts with the solar radiation and with an external bath having a given temperature profile. The heat flow between core and envelope can be controlled by varying the thermal conductivity of their interface. It is shown that this system acts as a passive heat pump raising the core average temperature with respect to the average equilibrium value corresponding to a fixed value of the interface conductivity, at the same time flattening its oscillation in time. By changing the time dependence of the conductivity the system vice versa acts as a refrigerator. It is shown how the limits of this performance depend on the passive parameters such as surfaces, conductivities, heat capacities.

Holistic saving of CO{sub 2} at a private bank; Die groesste solare Kaelteanlage der Schweiz. Ganzheitliche CO{sub 2}-Einsparung bei einer Privatbank\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSchmid, Wolfgang\n\n2011-07-01\n\nSince June 2008, the Swiss private bank Pictet and Cie. (Geneva, Switzerland) operates the largest solar refrigerant plant of Switzerland. The solar generated heat is used all over the year for heating up of drinking water, seasonally for room air conditioning and in the summer for driving of three absorption refrigerators with a refrigerating capacity of totally 210 kW. This is sufficient in order to keep the office space of nearly 4,000 m{sup 2} at a moderate temperature by means of cooling ceilings.\n\nUtilizing Solar Power Technologies for On-Orbit Propellant Production\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFikes, John C.; Howell, Joe T.; Henley, Mark W.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe cost of access to space beyond low Earth orbit may be reduced if vehicles can refuel in orbit. The cost of access to low Earth orbit may also be reduced by launching oxygen and hydrogen propellants in the form of water. To achieve this reduction in costs of access to low Earth orbit and beyond, a propellant depot is considered that electrolyzes water in orbit, then condenses and stores cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen. Power requirements for such a depot require Solar Power Satellite technologies. A propellant depot utilizing solar power technologies is discussed in this paper. The depot will be deployed in a 400 km circular equatorial orbit. It receives tanks of water launched into a lower orbit from Earth, converts the water to liquid hydrogen and oxygen, and stores up to 500 metric tons of cryogenic propellants. This requires a power system that is comparable to a large Solar Power Satellite capable of several 100 kW of energy. Power is supplied by a pair of solar arrays mounted perpendicular to the orbital plane, which rotates once per orbit to track the Sun. The majority of the power is used to run the electrolysis system. Thermal control is maintained by body-mounted radiators; these also provide some shielding against orbital debris. The propellant stored in the depot can support transportation from low Earth orbit to geostationary Earth orbit, the Moon, LaGrange points, Mars, etc. Emphasis is placed on the Water-Ice to Cryogen propellant production facility. A very high power system is required for cracking (electrolyzing) the water and condensing and refrigerating the resulting oxygen and hydrogen. For a propellant production rate of 500 metric tons (1,100,000 pounds) per year, an average electrical power supply of 100 s of kW is required. To make the most efficient use of space solar power, electrolysis is performed only during the portion of the orbit that the Depot is in sunlight, so roughly twice this power level is needed for operations in sunlight\n\nDesign, installation and operating experience of 20 photovoltaic medical refrigerator systems on four continents\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHein, G.

The effect of a phase change material, in this case ice, on a vapour compression refrigeration system powered by solar panels is discussed. The battery and solar panels were sized to allow the system to function as an autonomous unit for a minimum of 12 hours. It was concluded that the presence of a phase change material in the refrigeration system caused a considerable increase in both the on and off time of the compressor. The ratio by which the on time increased was greater than the ratio by which the off time was increased. There was a 219% increase in the on time, a 139% increase in the compressor off time and a 3.5% increase in compressor work accompanied by a 5.5% reduction in COP. Thus, under conditions where there is enough load in the system to cause the initial on and off times of the compressor to be comparable, the presence of a phase change material may result in a greater on period than an off period for the compressor.\n\nIEA SHC Task 38 'Solar air-conditioning and refrigeration'.

To improve ejector performance, this study proposes a variable throat ejector (VTEJ) and analyzes its performance using CFD simulations. The following conclusions can be drawn. An ejector with a greater throat area and larger solar collector allows a wider operating range of generator temperatures, but may be overdesigned and expensive. Conversely, decreasing the throat area limits the operating range of generator temperatures. Thus the ejector with a fixed throat area may be unsuitable to use solar energy as a heat source. For a VTEJ, this study derives a curve-fitting relationship between the optimum throat area ratio and the operating temperatures. Using this relationship to adjust the throat area ratio, the ejector can consistently achieve optimal and stable performances under a varying solar heat supply. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.

The confirmation can be the fact that number of published research is on rise. Adsorption appliances may turn out to be an alternative to compression-type coolers. They use ecological chemical agents instead of substances which are aggressive and harmful to the environment. For regeneration of adsorptive refrigeration systems one can use cheap energy in a form of: industrial waste heat, energy of solar radiation and cheap electric power. The paper presents principles of operation as well as advantages and disadvantages of adsorptive refrigeration systems.

Using a binary ammonia-water mixture as the working fluid, this combined cycle produces both power and refrigeration output simultaneously by employing only one external heat source. In order to achieve the highest possible exergy efficiency, a secondary turbine is inserted to expand the hot weak solution leaving the boiler. Moreover, an artificial neural network (ANN is used to simulate the thermodynamic properties and the relationship between the input thermodynamic variables on the cycle performance. It is shown that turbine inlet pressure, as well as heat source and refrigeration temperatures have significant effects on the net power output, refrigeration output and exergy efficiency of the combined cycle. In addition, the results of ANN are in excellent agreement with the mathematical simulation and cover a wider range for evaluation of cycle performance.\n\nComputational tool for simulation of power and refrigeration cycles\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCÃ³rdoba Tuta, E.; Reyes Orozco, M.\n\n2016-07-01\n\nSmall improvement in thermal efficiency of power cycles brings huge cost savings in the production of electricity, for that reason have a tool for simulation of power cycles allows modeling the optimal changes for a best performance.
