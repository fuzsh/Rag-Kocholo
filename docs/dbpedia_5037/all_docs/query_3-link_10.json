        "text": "Nader Guirat (نادر قيراط) (born May 16, 1986) is a Tunisian pop-rock singer-songwriter-musician. Nader won the title of Star Academy on the 5th season of the reality talent show. He became the first winner in the show’s history who primarily performed a non-Arabic repertoire of songs interpreting varied genres of Pop, Rock, House, acoustic and variété Française (French variety) in English, French, Italian, Spanish as well as Arabic. He sang Tina Arena, Chris De Burgh, Alessandro Safina, Cheb Khaled, Akram Sedkaoui, Amel Bent, Nadia, Yves Larock, Karl Wolf, Massari, Hot Banditoz and Ahmed Al-Sherif.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nNader Guirat was born on May 16, 1986, in the coastal city of Sousse, in Tunisia, to Nejib Guirat, a business man and Raoudha Boukthir. The eldest child of the couple, his younger siblings are sister Nahed and brother Zied.\n\nGuirat first public performance was at the age of five in nursery school, where he performed songs of late veteran Egyptian singer Abdul Halim Hafiz. In an interview with a local Tunisian magazine Le Temps, Nader describes when he first defied himself to become a singer, while watching TV with his father he spurted out that \"One Day You Will See Me Out There\".\n\nGuirat realized that acoustic and pop rock genres were more of his style when he learnt guitar at 14. Though his attention was still split between music and sports, trying his hand at martial arts, soccer and tennis, he formed his first band, ‘Hypnos’ at age 15, and recorded his first demo, singing lead and produced his first album with the band with songs in French and English.\n\nMusic career[]\n\nStar Academy (2008)[]\n\nIn 2008 Guirat auditioned for the 5th season of the show Star Academy which is the Arab World's version of the French show with its namesake [tar Academy (France) based in Lebanon.

After 4 months Guirat reached the show's grand finale with two others. Guirat won that seasons' title with the highest percentage of votes from global viewers.

The show launched Guirat's music career.\n\nL'Ange Perdu (2009)[]\n\nIn 2009 Guirat released his début single ‘L’Ange Perdu’ (The Lost Angel), a reprise of an Arabic score by singer/composer Marwan Khoury, performed in French. The lyrics which he co-penned with fellow countryman Ayman Jouadi echo a story from Guirat’s childhood. He financed the project and collaborated with music arranger Michel Fadel and ‘The National Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine’, where the song video was shot. \"L’Ange Perdu\" received best song of the year award from Tunisian radio station Jawhara FM.\n\nCrimea Music Fest (September 2011)[]\n\nIn 2011 organisers of the first international music festival in the Ukraine, Crimea Music Fest, invited Guirat to participate at the festival as a performer and contestant representing his country Tunisia.

The song sends a message to all Tunisian people to unite as ‘one’ for the future of their country and to set aside their political and religious differences, explains Guirat in an interview with Tunisian ‘Al-Chourouk’ newspaper. The song is a music compilation of rock with an added oriental flare showcased in the use of instruments such as the Middle Eastern flute, Ney and Oriental drum, Darabuka.\n\n'The Jasmine’s Calling' is composed by Guirat, lyrics by Canadian lyricist Ramona, arrangement by fellow Tunisian Elyes Bouchoucha, orchestration and mix at Studio Event, Tunisia and music mastering at Color Sound Studio, Paris, France.\n\nPromoting ‘The Jasmine’s Calling’ on Tunisian Radio station, Jawhara FM Guirat talked about his future plans of moving to Paris, France which is to be his new permanent residence.
