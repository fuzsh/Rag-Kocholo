        "text": "This study aims at offering a general interpretation of the tophet-phenomenon in the light of present knowledge. Direct as well as indirect sources are reexamined, and the hypothesis of the tophet as child-necropolis is excluded. On the contrary, it is analysed as a cult-place where newborn or very young children (and lambs and kids) were sacrificed to the gods as a consequence of a vow, made by a single, a family or a collectivity. To be sure, ritual infant killings were not the only ceremonies carried there, but archaeological evidence testifies that the very core of the rites was the child-sacrifice. As a consequence, an interpretive model is proposed, based on the vowing-dynamics: if a vow (ndr) was made, and the prayer was fulfilled by the gods, the promise must be kept at all costs. This interpretation matches with all our sources and can explain both the votive character of the inscriptions and the eventual (even if rare) presence of foetuses in the urns, i.e. children vowed to the gods already before the birth, and dead during the pregnancy, but carried to the tophet, sacrificed and burnt to the gods all the same.\n\nStudies of the object marker *ʾyt in Northwest Semitic have been largely concerned with its origin and etymology, but the function of the object marker has been poorly understood. While the use of the object marker may be optional, the typological research on Differential Object Marking (DOM) shows that the distribution of object marking in Northwest Semitic is not erratic. Object marking clearly correlates to the definiteness and animacy scales, with objects that fall higher on these scales more likely to be marked. Further, the identifiability of the referent of the object phrase also correlates to the use of the object marker as the majority of marked objects have either been mentioned previously in the text or are available in the immediate situation of the audience. Finally, comparison of the DOM systems in the individual Northwest Semitic languages indicates that Hebrew and Moabite use more developed systems than Phoenician and Aramaic, lending support to the conclusion that the presence of object marking is a result of areal diffusion through language contact.\n\nAbstract: The aim of the present text is to re-examine the basic sources informing us about the miqim elim, a particular type of cult personnel mentioned in the Phoenician-Punic inscriptions. While there have been significant studies on the office or function, as it has been connected with some of the most appealing themes of the history of ancient Mediterranean religions, its nature is still a matter for discussion. The intention of this contribution, after briefly reviewing the internal and external available data, is to analyse in some depth the relevant epigraphic information coming from the culture under study, in an attempt to provide, confirm or refute any facts about its character and its possible position within Phoenician and Punic society in the period documented. Keywords: Religion; Cult; Priesthood; Society; Epigraphy; Inscriptions."
