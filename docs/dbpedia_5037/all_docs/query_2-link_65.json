These processes include electron tunneling through quantum dots, as well as interactions between multiple quantum dot structures. In order to unambiguously determine these evanescent fields, appropriate boundary conditions have been developed to connect the electronic solutions interior to the semiconductor quantum dot to exterior vacuum solutions. In standard envelope function theory, the interior wave function consists of products of band edge and envelope functions, and both must be considered when matching to the external solution. While the envelope functions satisfy tractable equations, the band edge functions are generally not known. In this work, symmetry arguments in the spherically symmetric approximation are used in conjunction with the known qualitative behavior of bonding and antibonding orbitals to catalog the behavior of the band edge functions at the unit cell boundary. This physical approximation allows consolidation of the influence of the band edge functions to two simple surface parameters that are incorporated into the boundary conditions and are straightforwardly computed by using numerical first-principles quantum techniques. These new boundary conditions are employed to analyze an isolated spherically symmetric semiconductor quantum dot in vacuum within the analytical model of Sercel and Vahala [Phys. Rev. Lett. 65, 239 (1990); Phys. Rev. B 42, 3690 (1990)]. Results are obtained for quantum dots made of GaAs and InP, which are compared with ab initio calculations that have appeared in the literature.\n\nQuantum teleportation via noisy bipartite and tripartite accelerating quantum states: beyond the single mode approximation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZounia, M.; Shamirzaie, M.; Ashouri, A.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nIn this paper quantum teleportation of an unknown quantum state via noisy maximally bipartite (Bell) and maximally tripartite (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)) entangled states are investigated. We suppose that one of the observers who would receive the sent state accelerates uniformly with respect to the sender. The interactions of the quantum system with its environment during the teleportation process impose noises. These (unital and nonunital) noises are: phase damping, phase flip, amplitude damping and bit flip. In expressing the modes of the Dirac field used as qubits, in the accelerating frame, the so-called single mode approximation is not imposed. We calculate the fidelities of teleportation, and discuss their behaviors using suitable plots. The effects of noise, acceleration and going beyond the single mode approximation are discussed. Although the Bell states bring higher fidelities than GHZ states, the global behaviors of the two quantum systems with respect to some noise types, and therefore their fidelities, are different.\n\nQuantum mean-field approximation for lattice quantum models: Truncating quantum correlations and retaining classical ones\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMalpetti, Daniele; Roscilde, Tommaso\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe mean-field approximation is at the heart of our understanding of complex systems, despite its fundamental limitation of completely neglecting correlations between the elementary constituents. In a recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 130401 (2016), 10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.130401], we have shown that in quantum many-body systems at finite temperature, two-point correlations can be formally separated into a thermal part and a quantum part and that quantum correlations are generically found to decay exponentially at finite temperature, with a characteristic, temperature-dependent quantum coherence length. The existence of these two different forms of correlation in quantum many-body systems suggests the possibility of formulating an approximation, which affects quantum correlations only, without preventing the correct description of classical fluctuations at all length scales. Focusing on lattice boson and quantum Ising models, we make use of the path-integral formulation of quantum statistical mechanics to introduce such an approximation, which we dub quantum mean-field (QMF) approach, and which can be readily generalized to a cluster form (cluster QMF or cQMF). The cQMF approximation reduces to cluster mean-field theory at T =0 , while at any finite temperature it produces a family of systematically improved, semi-classical approximations to the quantum statistical mechanics of the lattice theory at hand. Contrary to standard MF approximations, the correct nature of thermal critical phenomena is captured by any cluster size. In the two exemplary cases of the two-dimensional quantum Ising model and of two-dimensional quantum rotors, we study systematically the convergence of the cQMF approximation towards the exact result, and show that the convergence is typically linear or sublinear in the boundary-to-bulk ratio of the clusters as T â0 , while it becomes faster than linear as T grows. These results pave the way towards the development of semiclassical numerical\n\nCalculating Resonance Positions and Widths Using the Siegert Approximation Method\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRapedius, Kevin\n\n2011-01-01\n\nHere, we present complex resonance states (or Siegert states) that describe the tunnelling decay of a trapped quantum particle from an intuitive point of view that naturally leads to the easily applicable Siegert approximation method.

Here, we review recent progress in diagrammatic extensions to dynamical mean-field theory for ab initio materials calculations. We first recapitulate the quantum field theoretical background behind the two-particle vertex. Next we discuss latest algorithmic advances in quantum Monte Carlo simulations for calculating such two-particle quantities using worm sampling and vertex asymptotics, before giving an introduction to the ab initio dynamical vertex approximation (AbinitioDÎA). Finally, we highlight the potential of AbinitioDÎA by detailing results for the prototypical correlated metal SrVO3.\n\nEfficient free energy calculations of quantum systems through computer simulations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAntonelli, Alex; Ramirez, Rafael; Herrero, Carlos; Hernandez, Eduardo\n\n2009-03-01\n\nIn general, the classical limit is assumed in computer simulation calculations of free energy. This approximation, however, is not justifiable for a class of systems in which quantum contributions for the free energy cannot be neglected. The inclusion of quantum effects is important for the determination of reliable phase diagrams of these systems. In this work, we present a new methodology to compute the free energy of many-body quantum systems [1]. This methodology results from the combination of the path integral formulation of statistical mechanics and efficient non-equilibrium methods to estimate free energy, namely, the adiabatic switching and reversible scaling methods. A quantum Einstein crystal is used as a model to show the accuracy and reliability the methodology. This new method is applied to the calculation of solid-liquid coexistence properties of neon. Our findings indicate that quantum contributions to properties such as, melting point, latent heat of fusion, entropy of fusion, and slope of melting line can be up to 10% of the calculated values using the classical approximation.

In a fundamental point of view, however, evolution of quantum systems by the laws of quantum mechanics is more restrictive than classical systems, identified to a specific form of dynamics, that is, unitary transformations and, consequently, positive and completely positive maps to subsystems. This also characterizes classes of disallowed transformations on quantum systems, among which positive but not completely maps are of particular interest as they characterize entangled states, a general resource in quantum information processing. Structural physical approximation offers a systematic way of approximating those non-physical maps, positive but not completely positive maps, with quantum channels. Since it has been proposed as a method of detecting entangled states, it has stimulated fundamental problems on classifications of positive maps and the structure of Hermitian operators and quantum states, as well as on quantum measurement such as quantum design in quantum information theory. It has developed efficient and feasible methods of directly detecting entangled states in practice, for which proof-of-principle experimental demonstrations have also been performed with photonic qubit states. Here, we present a comprehensive review on quantum information processing with structural physical approximations and the related progress.

These calculations are useful because they provide highly accurate information on the dynamics of chemical reactions which can be compared in detail with experimental results. They also serve as quantum mechanical benchmarks for testing approximate theories which can more readily be applied to more complicated reactions. This review includes theories for calculating quantities such as rate constants which have many important scientific applications.\n\nQuantum corrections of the truncated Wigner approximation applied to an exciton transport model.\n\nPubMed\n\nIvanov, Anton; Breuer, Heinz-Peter\n\n2017-04-01\n\nWe modify the path integral representation of exciton transport in open quantum systems such that an exact description of the quantum fluctuations around the classical evolution of the system is possible. As a consequence, the time evolution of the system observables is obtained by calculating the average of a stochastic difference equation which is weighted with a product of pseudoprobability density functions. From the exact equation of motion one can clearly identify the terms that are also present if we apply the truncated Wigner approximation. This description of the problem is used as a basis for the derivation of a new approximation, whose validity goes beyond the truncated Wigner approximation. To demonstrate this we apply the formalism to a donor-acceptor transport model.\n\nCalculating TMDs of a large nucleus: Quasi-classical approximation and quantum evolution\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nKovchegov, Yuri V.; Sievert, Matthew D.\n\n2015-12-24\n\nWe set up a formalism for calculating transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) of a large nucleus using the tools of saturation physics. By generalizing the quasi-classical GlauberâGribovâMueller/McLerranâVenugopalan approximation to allow for the possibility of spinâorbit coupling, we show how any TMD can be calculated in the saturation framework. This can also be applied to the TMDs of a proton by modeling it as a large ânucleus.â To illustrate our technique, we calculate the quark TMDs of an unpolarized nucleus at large-x: the unpolarized quark distribution and the quark BoerâMulders distribution. Here, we observe that spinâorbit coupling leads to mixing betweenmoreÂ Â» different TMDs of the nucleus and of the nucleons. We then consider the evolution of TMDs: at large-x, in the double-logarithmic approximation, we obtain the Sudakov form factor. At small-x the evolution of unpolarized-target quark TMDs is governed by BK/JIMWLK evolution, while the small-x evolution of polarized-target quark TMDs appears to be dominated by the QCD Reggeon.Â«Â less\n\nApproximate Locality for Quantum Systems on Graphs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOsborne, Tobias J.\n\n2008-10-01\n\nIn this Letter we make progress on a long-standing open problem of Aaronson and Ambainis [Theory Comput. 1, 47 (2005)1557-2862]: we show that if U is a sparse unitary operator with a gap Î in its spectrum, then there exists an approximate logarithm H of U which is also sparse. The sparsity pattern of H gets more dense as 1/Î increases. This result can be interpreted as a way to convert between local continuous-time and local discrete-time quantum processes. As an example we show that the discrete-time coined quantum walk can be realized stroboscopically from an approximately local continuous-time quantum walk.\n\nAccurate quantum chemical calculations\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBauschlicher, Charles W., Jr.; Langhoff, Stephen R.; Taylor, Peter R.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nAn important goal of quantum chemical calculations is to provide an understanding of chemical bonding and molecular electronic structure. A second goal, the prediction of energy differences to chemical accuracy, has been much harder to attain. First, the computational resources required to achieve such accuracy are very large, and second, it is not straightforward to demonstrate that an apparently accurate result, in terms of agreement with experiment, does not result from a cancellation of errors. Recent advances in electronic structure methodology, coupled with the power of vector supercomputers, have made it possible to solve a number of electronic structure problems exactly using the full configuration interaction (FCI) method within a subspace of the complete Hilbert space. These exact results can be used to benchmark approximate techniques that are applicable to a wider range of chemical and physical problems. The methodology of many-electron quantum chemistry is reviewed. Methods are considered in detail for performing FCI calculations. The application of FCI methods to several three-electron problems in molecular physics are discussed. A number of benchmark applications of FCI wave functions are described. Atomic basis sets and the development of improved methods for handling very large basis sets are discussed: these are then applied to a number of chemical and spectroscopic problems; to transition metals; and to problems involving potential energy surfaces. Although the experiences described give considerable grounds for optimism about the general ability to perform accurate calculations, there are several problems that have proved less tractable, at least with current computer resources, and these and possible solutions are discussed.\n\nProduct-State Approximations to Quantum States\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrandÃ£o, Fernando G. S. L.; Harrow, Aram W.\n\n2016-02-01\n\nWe show that for any many-body quantum state there exists an unentangled quantum state such that most of the two-body reduced density matrices are close to those of the original state. This is a statement about the monogamy of entanglement, which cannot be shared without limit in the same way as classical correlation. Our main application is to Hamiltonians that are sums of two-body terms. For such Hamiltonians we show that there exist product states with energy that is close to the ground-state energy whenever the interaction graph of the Hamiltonian has high degree. This proves the validity of mean-field theory and gives an explicitly bounded approximation error. If we allow states that are entangled within small clusters of systems but product across clusters then good approximations exist when the Hamiltonian satisfies one or more of the following properties: (1) high degree, (2) small expansion, or (3) a ground state where the blocks in the partition have sublinear entanglement. Previously this was known only in the case of small expansion or in the regime where the entanglement was close to zero. Our approximations allow an extensive error in energy, which is the scale considered by the quantum PCP (probabilistically checkable proof) and NLTS (no low-energy trivial-state) conjectures. Thus our results put restrictions on the possible Hamiltonians that could be used for a possible proof of the qPCP or NLTS conjectures. By contrast the classical PCP constructions are often based on constraint graphs with high degree. Likewise we show that the parallel repetition that is possible with classical constraint satisfaction problems cannot also be possible for quantum Hamiltonians, unless qPCP is false. The main technical tool behind our results is a collection of new classical and quantum de Finetti theorems which do not make any symmetry assumptions on the underlying states.\n\nGeneral theory for calculating disorder-averaged Green's function correlators within the coherent potential approximation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhou, Chenyi; Guo, Hong\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe report a diagrammatic method to solve the general problem of calculating configurationally averaged Green's function correlators that appear in quantum transport theory for nanostructures containing disorder. The theory treats both equilibrium and nonequilibrium quantum statistics on an equal footing. Since random impurity scattering is a problem that cannot be solved exactly in a perturbative approach, we combine our diagrammatic method with the coherent potential approximation (CPA) so that a reliable closed-form solution can be obtained. Our theory not only ensures the internal consistency of the diagrams derived at different levels of the correlators but also satisfies a set of Ward-like identities that corroborate the conserving consistency of transport calculations within the formalism. The theory is applied to calculate the quantum transport properties such as average ac conductance and transmission moments of a disordered tight-binding model, and results are numerically verified to high precision by comparing to the exact solutions obtained from enumerating all possible disorder configurations. Our formalism can be employed to predict transport properties of a wide variety of physical systems where disorder scattering is important.\n\nApproximation of Quantum Stochastic Differential Equations for Input-Output Model Reduction\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-02-25\n\nApproximation of Quantum Stochastic Differential Equations for Input-Output Model Reduction We have completed a short program of theoretical research...on dimensional reduction and approximation of models based on quantum stochastic differential equations.

Starting with the symmetrized version of the correlation function expressed as a discretized path integral, we introduce a change of integration variables often used in the derivation of trajectory-based semiclassical methods. In particular, we transform to sum and difference variables between forward and backward complex-time propagation paths. Once the transformation is performed, the potential energy is expanded in powers of the difference variables, which allows us to perform the integrals over these variables analytically. The manner in which this procedure is carried out results in an open-chain path integral (in the remaining sum variables) with a modified potential that is evaluated using imaginary-time path-integral sampling rather than requiring the generation of a large ensemble of trajectories. Consequently, any number of path integral sampling schemes can be employed to compute the remaining path integral, including Monte Carlo, path-integral molecular dynamics, or enhanced path-integral molecular dynamics. We believe that this approach constitutes a different perspective in semiclassical-type approximations to quantum time correlation functions. Importantly, we argue that our approximation can be systematically improved within a cumulant expansion formalism. We test this approximation on a set of one-dimensional problems that are commonly used to benchmark approximate quantum dynamical schemes. We show that the method is at least as accurate as the popular ring-polymer molecular dynamics technique and linearized semiclassical initial value representation for correlation functions of linear operators in most of these examples and improves the accuracy of correlation functions of nonlinear operators.\n\nAn open-chain imaginary-time path-integral sampling approach to the calculation of approximate symmetrized quantum time correlation functions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCendagorta, Joseph R.; BaÄiÄ, Zlatko; Tuckerman, Mark E.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe introduce a scheme for approximating quantum time correlation functions numerically within the Feynman path integral formulation.

Quantum geometry effects modify the weight associated with each path so that the effective measure on the space of paths is different from that used in the Wheeler-DeWitt theory. These differences introduce some conceptual subtleties in arriving at the WKB approximation. But the approximation is well defined and provides intuition for the differences between loop quantum cosmology and the Wheeler-DeWitt theory from a path integral perspective.\n\nAccuracy of the adiabatic-impulse approximation for closed and open quantum systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTomka, Michael; Campos Venuti, Lorenzo; Zanardi, Paolo\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe study the adiabatic-impulse approximation (AIA) as a tool to approximate the time evolution of quantum states when driven through a region of small gap. Such small-gap regions are a common situation in adiabatic quantum computing and having reliable approximations is important in this context. The AIA originates from the Kibble-Zurek theory applied to continuous quantum phase transitions. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism was developed to predict the power-law scaling of the defect density across a continuous quantum phase transition. Instead, here we quantify the accuracy of the AIA via the trace norm distance with respect to the exact evolved state. As expected, we find that for short times or fast protocols, the AIA outperforms the simple adiabatic approximation. However, for large times or slow protocols, the situation is actually reversed and the AIA provides a worse approximation. Nevertheless, we found a variation of the AIA that can perform better than the adiabatic one. This counterintuitive modification consists in crossing the region of small gap twice. Our findings are illustrated by several examples of driven closed and open quantum systems.\n\nSlow-roll approximation in loop quantum cosmology\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLuc, Joanna; Mielczarek, Jakub, E-mail: joanna.luc@uj.edu.pl, E-mail: jakub.mielczarek@uj.edu.pl\n\nThe slow-roll approximation is an analytical approach to study dynamical properties of the inflationary universe. In this article, systematic construction of the slow-roll expansion for effective loop quantum cosmology is presented. The analysis is performed up to the fourth order in both slow-roll parameters and the parameter controlling the strength of deviation from the classical case. The expansion is performed for three types of the slow-roll parameters: Hubble slow-roll parameters, Hubble flow parameters and potential slow-roll parameters. An accuracy of the approximation is verified by comparison with the numerical phase space trajectories for the case with a massive potential term.moreÂ Â» The results obtained in this article may be helpful in the search for the subtle quantum gravitational effects with use of the cosmological data.Â«Â less\n\nQuantum scattering beyond the plane-wave approximation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKarlovets, Dmitry\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWhile a plane-wave approximation in high-energy physics works well in a majority of practical cases, it becomes inapplicable for scattering of the vortex particles carrying orbital angular momentum, of Airy beams, of the so-called SchrÃ¶dinger cat states, and their generalizations. Such quantum states of photons, electrons and neutrons have been generated experimentally in recent years, opening up new perspectives in quantum optics, electron microscopy, particle physics, and so forth. Here we discuss the non-plane-wave effects in scattering brought about by the novel quantum numbers of these wave packets. For the well-focused electrons of intermediate energies, already available at electron microscopes, the corresponding contribution can surpass that of the radiative corrections. Moreover, collisions of the cat-like superpositions of such focused beams with atoms allow one to probe effects of the quantum interference, which have never played any role in particle scattering.\n\nA harmonic adiabatic approximation to calculate highly excited vibrational levels of ``floppy molecules''\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLauvergnat, David; Nauts, AndrÃ©; Justum, Yves; Chapuisat, Xavier\n\n2001-04-01\n\nThe harmonic adiabatic approximation (HADA), an efficient and accurate quantum method to calculate highly excited vibrational levels of molecular systems, is presented. It is well-suited to applications to \"floppy molecules\" with a rather large number of atoms (N>3). A clever choice of internal coordinates naturally suggests their separation into active, slow, or large amplitude coordinates q', and inactive, fast, or small amplitude coordinates qâ³, which leads to an adiabatic (or Born-Oppenheimer-type) approximation (ADA), i.e., the total wave function is expressed as a product of active and inactive total wave functions. However, within the framework of the ADA, potential energy data concerning the inactive coordinates qâ³ are required. To reduce this need, a minimum energy domain (MED) is defined by minimizing the potential energy surface (PES) for each value of the active variables q', and a quadratic or harmonic expansion of the PES, based on the MED, is used (MED harmonic potential). In other words, the overall picture is that of a harmonic valley about the MED. In the case of only one active variable, we have a minimum energy path (MEP) and a MEP harmonic potential. The combination of the MED harmonic potential and the adiabatic approximation (harmonic adiabatic approximation: HADA) greatly reduces the size of the numerical computations, so that rather large molecules can be studied. In the present article however, the HADA is applied to our benchmark molecule HCN/CNH, to test the validity of the method. Thus, the HADA vibrational energy levels are compared and are in excellent agreement with the ADA calculations (adiabatic approximation with the full PES) of Light and BaÄiÄ [J. Chem. Phys. 87, 4008 (1987)]. Furthermore, the exact harmonic results (exact calculations without the adiabatic approximation but with the MEP harmonic potential) are compared to the exact calculations (without any sort of approximation). In addition, we compare the densities of\n\nOn the validity of microscopic calculations of double-quantum-dot spin qubits based on Fock-Darwin states\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChan, GuoXuan; Wang, Xin\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe consider two typical approximations that are used in the microscopic calculations of double-quantum dot spin qubits, namely, the Heitler-London (HL) and the Hund-Mulliken (HM) approximations, which use linear combinations of Fock-Darwin states to approximate the two-electron states under the double-well confinement potential. We compared these results to a case in which the solution to a one-dimensional SchrÂ¨odinger equation was exactly known and found that typical microscopic calculations based on Fock-Darwin states substantially underestimate the value of the exchange interaction, which is the key parameter that controls the quantum dot spin qubits. This underestimation originates from the lack of tunneling of Fock-Darwin states, which is accurate only in the case with a single potential well. Our results suggest that the accuracies of the current two-dimensional molecular- orbit-theoretical calculations based on Fock-Darwin states should be revisited since underestimation could only deteriorate in dimensions that are higher than one.\n\nTemporal Planning for Compilation of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm Circuits\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nVenturelli, Davide; Do, Minh Binh; Rieffel, Eleanor Gilbert; Frank, Jeremy David\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe investigate the application of temporal planners to the problem of compiling quantum circuits to newly emerging quantum hardware. While our approach is general, we focus our initial experiments on Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) circuits that have few ordering constraints and allow highly parallel plans. We report on experiments using several temporal planners to compile circuits of various sizes to a realistic hardware. This early empirical evaluation suggests that temporal planning is a viable approach to quantum circuit compilation.\n\nAtomistic Modeling of Nanostructures via the BFS Quantum Approximate Method\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBozzolo, Guillermo; Garces, Jorge E.; Noebe, Ronald D.; Farias, D.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nIdeally, computational modeling techniques for nanoscopic physics would be able to perform free of limitations on the type and number of elements, while providing comparable accuracy when dealing with bulk or surface problems. Computational efficiency is also desirable, if not mandatory, for properly dealing with the complexity of typical nano-strucured systems. A quantum approximate technique, the BFS method for alloys, which attempts to meet these demands, is introduced for the calculation of the energetics of nanostructures. The versatility of the technique is demonstrated through analysis of diverse systems, including multi-phase precipitation in a five element Ni-Al-Ti-Cr-Cu alloy and the formation of mixed composition Co-Cu islands on a metallic Cu(III) substrate.\n\nCharge noise in quantum dot qubits: beyond the Markovian approximation.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYang, Yuan-Chi; Friesen, Mark; Coppersmith, S. N.\n\nCharge noise is a limiting factor in the performance of semiconductor quantum dot qubits, including both spin and charge qubits. In this work, we develop an analytical formalism for treating semiclassical noise beyond the Markovian approximation, which allows us to investigate noise models relevant for quantum dots, such as 1 / f noise. We apply our methods to both charge qubits and quantum dot hybrid qubits, and study the effects of charge noise on single-qubit rotations in these systems. The formalism is also directly applicable to the case of strong microwave driving, for which the rotating wave approximation breaks down. This work was supported in part by ARO (W911NF-12-0607) and ONR (N00014-15-1-0029), and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nApproximating quantum many-body wave functions using artificial neural networks\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCai, Zi; Liu, Jinguo\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we demonstrate the expressibility of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in quantum many-body physics by showing that a feed-forward neural network with a small number of hidden layers can be trained to approximate with high precision the ground states of some notable quantum many-body systems. We consider the one-dimensional free bosons and fermions, spinless fermions on a square lattice away from half-filling, as well as frustrated quantum magnetism with a rapidly oscillating ground-state characteristic function. In the latter case, an ANN with a standard architecture fails, while that with a slightly modified one successfully learns the frustration-induced complex sign rule in the ground state and approximates the ground states with high precisions. As an example of practical use of our method, we also perform the variational method to explore the ground state of an antiferromagnetic J1-J2 Heisenberg model.\n\nChallenges in large scale quantum mechanical calculations: Challenges in large scale quantum mechanical calculations\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRatcliff, Laura E.; Mohr, Stephan; Huhs, Georg\n\n2016-11-07\n\nDuring the past decades, quantum mechanical methods have undergone an amazing transition from pioneering investigations of experts into a wide range of practical applications, made by a vast community of researchers. First principles calculations of systems containing up to a few hundred atoms have become a standard in many branches of science. The sizes of the systems which can be simulated have increased even further during recent years, and quantum-mechanical calculations of systems up to many thousands of atoms are nowadays possible. This opens up new appealing possibilities, in particular for interdisciplinary work, bridging together communities of different needs andmoreÂ Â» sensibilities. In this review we will present the current status of this topic, and will also give an outlook on the vast multitude of applications, challenges and opportunities stimulated by electronic structure calculations, making this field an important working tool and bringing together researchers of many different domains.Â«Â less\n\nQuantum correlations of helicity entangled states in non-inertial frames beyond single mode approximation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHarsij, Zeynab, E-mail: z.harsij@ph.iut.ac.ir; Mirza, Behrouz, E-mail: b.mirza@cc.iut.ac.ir\n\nA helicity entangled tripartite state is considered in which the degree of entanglement is preserved in non-inertial frames.

S. L.; Harrow, Aram W.; Horodecki, MichaÅ\n\n2016-09-01\n\nWe prove that local random quantum circuits acting on n qubits composed of O( t 10 n 2) many nearest neighbor two-qubit gates form an approximate unitary t-design. Previously it was unknown whether random quantum circuits were a t-design for any t > 3. The proof is based on an interplay of techniques from quantum many-body theory, representation theory, and the theory of Markov chains. In particular we employ a result of Nachtergaele for lower bounding the spectral gap of frustration-free quantum local Hamiltonians; a quasi-orthogonality property of permutation matrices; a result of Oliveira which extends to the unitary group the path-coupling method for bounding the mixing time of random walks; and a result of Bourgain and Gamburd showing that dense subgroups of the special unitary group, composed of elements with algebraic entries, are â-copy tensor-product expanders. We also consider pseudo-randomness properties of local random quantum circuits of small depth and prove that circuits of depth O( t 10 n) constitute a quantum t-copy tensor-product expander. The proof also rests on techniques from quantum many-body theory, in particular on the detectability lemma of Aharonov, Arad, Landau, and Vazirani. We give applications of the results to cryptography, equilibration of closed quantum dynamics, and the generation of topological order. In particular we show the following pseudo-randomness property of generic quantum circuits: Almost every circuit U of size O( n k ) on n qubits cannot be distinguished from a Haar uniform unitary by circuits of size O( n ( k-9)/11) that are given oracle access to U.\n\nQmeQ 1.0: An open-source Python package for calculations of transport through quantum dot devices\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKirÅ¡anskas, Gediminas; Pedersen, Jonas Nyvold; KarlstrÃ¶m, Olov; Leijnse, Martin; Wacker, Andreas\n\n2017-12-01\n\nQmeQ is an open-source Python package for numerical modeling of transport through quantum dot devices with strong electron-electron interactions using various approximate master equation approaches. The package provides a framework for calculating stationary particle or energy currents driven by differences in chemical potentials or temperatures between the leads which are tunnel coupled to the quantum dots. The electronic structures of the quantum dots are described by their single-particle states and the Coulomb matrix elements between the states. When transport is treated perturbatively to lowest order in the tunneling couplings, the possible approaches are Pauli (classical), first-order Redfield, and first-order von Neumann master equations, and a particular form of the Lindblad equation. When all processes involving two-particle excitations in the leads are of interest, the second-order von Neumann approach can be applied. All these approaches are implemented in QmeQ. We here give an overview of the basic structure of the package, give examples of transport calculations, and outline the range of applicability of the different approximate approaches.\n\nFirst principles calculation of thermo-mechanical properties of thoria using Quantum ESPRESSO\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMalakkal, Linu; Szpunar, Barbara; Zuniga, Juan Carlos; Siripurapu, Ravi Kiran; Szpunar, Jerzy A.\n\n2016-05-01\n\nIn this work, we have used Quantum ESPRESSO (QE), an open source first principles code, based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials, along with quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) to calculate the thermo-mechanical properties of thorium dioxide (ThO2). Using Python programming language, our group developed qe-nipy-advanced, an interface to QE, which can evaluate the structural and thermo-mechanical properties of materials. We predicted the phonon contribution to thermal conductivity (kL) using the Slack model. We performed the calculations within local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the recently proposed version for solids (PBEsol). We employed a Monkhorst-Pack 5 Ã 5 Ã 5 k-points mesh in reciprocal space with a plane wave cut-off energy of 150 Ry to obtain the convergence of the structure. We calculated the dynamical matrices of the lattice on a 4 Ã 4 Ã 4 mesh. We have predicted the heat capacity, thermal expansion and the phonon contribution to thermal conductivity, as a function of temperature up to 1400K, and compared them with the previous work and known experimental results.\n\nA molecular-field approximation for quantum crystals. Ph.D. Thesis; [considering ground state properties\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDanilowicz, R.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nGround-state properties of quantum crystals have received considerable attention from both theorists and experimentalists. The theoretical results have varied widely with the Monte Carlo calculations being the most successful. The molecular field approximation yields ground-state properties which agree closely with the Monte Carlo results. This approach evaluates the dynamical behavior of each pair of molecules in the molecular field of the other N-2 molecules. In addition to predicting ground-state properties that agree well with experiment, this approach yields data on the relative importance of interactions of different nearest neighbor pairs.\n\nQuantum correlations of helicity entangled states in non-inertial frames beyond single mode approximation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHarsij, Zeynab; Mirza, Behrouz\n\n2014-12-01\n\nA helicity entangled tripartite state is considered in which the degree of entanglement is preserved in non-inertial frames.

On a simple example of a classically chaotic system with two degrees of freedom we demonstrate that this Gaussian state approximation is accurate for significantly smaller field strengths and longer times than the classical one. Applying this approximation to matrix quantum mechanics, we demonstrate that the quantum Lyapunov exponents are in general smaller than their classical counterparts, and even seem to vanish below some temperature. This behavior resembles the finite-temperature phase transition which was found for this system in Monte-Carlo simulations, and ensures that the system does not violate the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound Î»L < 2ÏT, which inevitably happens for classical dynamics at sufficiently small temperatures.\n\nWave packet and statistical quantum calculations for the He + NeHâº â HeHâº + Ne reaction on the ground electronic state.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoner, Debasish; Barrios, Lizandra; GonzÃ¡lez-Lezana, TomÃ¡s; Panda, Aditya N\n\n2014-09-21\n\nA real wave packet based time-dependent method and a statistical quantum method have been used to study the He + NeH(+) (v, j) reaction with the reactant in various ro-vibrational states, on a recently calculated ab initio ground state potential energy surface. Both the wave packet and statistical quantum calculations were carried out within the centrifugal sudden approximation as well as using the exact Hamiltonian. Quantum reaction probabilities exhibit dense oscillatory pattern for smaller total angular momentum values, which is a signature of resonances in a complex forming mechanism for the title reaction. Significant differences, found between exact and approximate quantum reaction cross sections, highlight the importance of inclusion of Coriolis coupling in the calculations. Statistical results are in fairly good agreement with the exact quantum results, for ground ro-vibrational states of the reactant. Vibrational excitation greatly enhances the reaction cross sections, whereas rotational excitation has relatively small effect on the reaction. The nature of the reaction cross section curves is dependent on the initial vibrational state of the reactant and is typical of a late barrier type potential energy profile.\n\nDiffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations of SrFeO 3 and LaFeO 3\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nSantana, Juan A.; Krogel, Jaron T.; Kent, Paul R. C.; ...\n\n2017-07-18\n\nThe equations of state, formation energy, and migration energy barrier of the oxygen vacancy in SrFeO 3 and LaFeO 3 were calculated in this paper with the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) method. Calculations were also performed with various Density Functional Theory (DFT) approximations for comparison. DMC reproduces the measured cohesive energies of these materials with errors below 0.23(5) eV and the structural properties within 1% of the experimental values. The DMC formation energies of the oxygen vacancy in SrFeO 3 and LaFeO 3 under oxygen-rich conditions are 1.3(1) and 6.24(7) eV, respectively. Similar calculations with semi-local DFT approximations formoreÂ Â» LaFeO 3 yielded vacancy formation energies 1.5 eV lower. Comparison of charge density evaluated with DMC and DFT approximations shows that DFT tends to overdelocalize the electrons in defected SrFeO 3 and LaFeO 3. Finally, calculations with DMC and local density approximation yield similar vacancy migration energy barriers, indicating that steric/electrostatic effects mainly determine migration barriers in these materials.Â«Â less\n\nResumming the large-N approximation for time evolving quantum systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMihaila, Bogdan; Dawson, John F.; Cooper, Fred\n\n2001-05-01\n\nIn this paper we discuss two methods of resumming the leading and next to leading order in 1/N diagrams for the quartic O(N) model. These two approaches have the property that they preserve both boundedness and positivity for expectation values of operators in our numerical simulations. These approximations can be understood either in terms of a truncation to the infinitely coupled Schwinger-Dyson hierarchy of equations, or by choosing a particular two-particle irreducible vacuum energy graph in the effective action of the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis formalism. We confine our discussion to the case of quantum mechanics where the Lagrangian is L(x,áº)=(12)âNi=1xË2i-(g/8N)[âNi=1x2i- r20]2. The key to these approximations is to treat both the x propagator and the x2 propagator on similar footing which leads to a theory whose graphs have the same topology as QED with the x2 propagator playing the role of the photon. The bare vertex approximation is obtained by replacing the exact vertex function by the bare one in the exact Schwinger-Dyson equations for the one and two point functions. The second approximation, which we call the dynamic Debye screening approximation, makes the further approximation of replacing the exact x2 propagator by its value at leading order in the 1/N expansion. These two approximations are compared with exact numerical simulations for the quantum roll problem. The bare vertex approximation captures the physics at large and modest N better than the dynamic Debye screening approximation.\n\nApplication of the N-quantum approximation to the proton radius problem\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCowen, Steven\n\nThis thesis is organized into three parts: 1. Introduction and bound state calculations of electronic and muonic hydrogen, 2. Bound states in motion, and 3.Treatment of soft photons. In the first part, we apply the N-Quantum Approximation (NQA) to electronic and muonic hydrogen and search for any new corrections to energy levels that could account for the 0.31 meV discrepancy of the proton radius problem. We derive a bound state equation and compare our numerical solutions and wave functions to those of the Dirac equation. We find NQA Lamb shift diagrams and calculate the associated energy shift contributions. We do not find any new corrections large enough to account for the discrepancy. In part 2, we discuss the effects of motion on bound states using the NQA. We find classical Lorentz contraction of the lowest order NQA wave function. Finally, in part 3, we develop a clothing transformation for interacting fields in order to produce the correct asymptotic limits. We find the clothing eliminates a trilinear interacting Hamiltonian term and produces a quadrilinear soft photon interaction term.\n\nQuantum close coupling calculation of transport and relaxation properties for Hg-H2 system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNemati-Kande, Ebrahim; Maghari, Ali\n\n2016-11-01\n\nQuantum mechanical close coupling calculation of the state-to-state transport and relaxation cross sections have been done for Hg-H2 molecular system using a high-level ab initio potential energy surface. Rotationally averaged cross sections were also calculated to obtain the energy dependent Senftleben-Beenakker cross sections at the energy range of 0.005-25,000 cm-1. Boltzmann averaging of the energy dependent Senftleben-Beenakker cross sections showed the temperature dependency over a wide temperature range of 50-2500 K. Interaction viscosity and diffusion coefficients were also calculated using close coupling cross sections and full classical Mason-Monchick approximation. The results were compared with each other and with the available experimental data. It was found that Mason-Monchick approximation for viscosity is more reliable than diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, from the comparison of the experimental diffusion coefficients with the result of the close coupling and Mason-Monchick approximation, it was found that the Hg-H2 potential energy surface used in this work can reliably predict diffusion coefficient data.\n\nRealizing various approximate quantum cloning with XY-type exchange interactions of flux qubits\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Na; Ye, Liu\n\n2014-03-01\n\nIn this paper, we realize all kinds of 1 â 2 approximate quantum cloning, including optimal 1 â 2 symmetric (or asymmetric) universal quantum cloning (UQC) and phase-covariant cloning (PCC), symmetric economical phase-covariant cloning (EPCC) and real state quantum cloning, with the XY-type exchange interactions of the flux qubits which are coupled by dc superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). It is shown that our schemes can be realized with the current experimental technology.\n\nCalculating Potential Energy Curves with Quantum Monte Carlo\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPowell, Andrew D.; Dawes, Richard\n\n2014-06-01\n\nQuantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a computational technique that can be applied to the electronic SchrÃ¶dinger equation for molecules. QMC methods such as Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) have demonstrated the capability of capturing large fractions of the correlation energy, thus suggesting their possible use for high-accuracy quantum chemistry calculations. QMC methods scale particularly well with respect to parallelization making them an attractive consideration in anticipation of next-generation computing architectures which will involve massive parallelization with millions of cores. Due to the statistical nature of the approach, in contrast to standard quantum chemistry methods, uncertainties (error-bars) are associated with each calculated energy. This study focuses on the cost, feasibility and practical application of calculating potential energy curves for small molecules with QMC methods. Trial wave functions were constructed with the multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) method from GAMESS-US.[1] The CASINO Monte Carlo quantum chemistry package [2] was used for all of the DMC calculations. An overview of our progress in this direction will be given. References: M. W. Schmidt et al. J. Comput. Chem. 14, 1347 (1993). R. J. Needs et al. J.

T.; Karplus, M.\n\n1970-10-01\n\nA quantum mechanical study is made of reactive scattering in the (H, H{sub 2}) system. The problem is formulated in terms of a form of the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) suitable for collisions in which all particles have finite mass. For certain incident energies, differential and total cross sections, as well as other attributes of the reactive collisions, (e.g. reaction configuration), are determined. Two limiting models in the DWBA formulation are compared; in one, the molecule is unperturbed by the incoming atom and in the other, the molecule adiabatically follows the incoming atom. For thermal incident energies and semi-empirical interaction potential employed, the adiabatic model seems to be more appropriate. Since the DWBA method is too complicated for a general study of the (H, H{sub 2}) reaction, a much simpler approximation method, the ?linear model? is developed. This model is very different in concept from treatments in which the three atoms are constrained to move on a line throughout the collision. The present model includes the full three-dimensional aspect of the collision and it is only the evaluation of the transition matrix element itself that is simplified. It is found that the linear model, when appropriately normalized, gives results in good agreement with that of the DWBA method. By application of this model, the energy dependence, rotational state of dependence and other properties of the total and differential reactions cross sections are determined. These results of the quantum mechanical treatment are compared with the classical calculation for the same potential surface. The most important result is that, in agreement with the classical treatment, the differential cross sections are strongly backward peaked at low energies and shifts in the forward direction as the energy increases. Finally, the implications of the present calculations for a theory of chemical kinetics are discussed.\n\nApproximation method for a spherical bound system in the quantum plasma\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMehramiz, A.; Sobhanian, S.; Mahmoodi, J.\n\n2010-08-15\n\nA system of quantum hydrodynamic equations has been used for investigating the dielectric tensor and dispersion equation of a semiconductor as a quantum magnetized plasma. Dispersion relations and their modifications due to quantum effects are derived for both longitudinal and transverse waves. The number of states and energy levels are analytically estimated for a spherical bound system embedded in a semiconductor quantum plasma. The results show that longitudinal waves decay rapidly and do not interact with the spherical bound system. The energy shifts caused by the spin-orbit interaction and the Zeeman effect are calculated.\n\nInformation-theoretic limitations on approximate quantum cloning and broadcasting\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLemm, Marius; Wilde, Mark M.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nWe prove quantitative limitations on any approximate simultaneous cloning or broadcasting of mixed states. The results are based on information-theoretic (entropic) considerations and generalize the well-known no-cloning and no-broadcasting theorems. We also observe and exploit the fact that the universal cloning machine on the symmetric subspace of n qudits and symmetrized partial trace channels are dual to each other. This duality manifests itself both in the algebraic sense of adjointness of quantum channels and in the operational sense that a universal cloning machine can be used as an approximate recovery channel for a symmetrized partial trace channel and vice versa. The duality extends to give control of the performance of generalized universal quantum cloning machines (UQCMs) on subspaces more general than the symmetric subspace. This gives a way to quantify the usefulness of a priori information in the context of cloning. For example, we can control the performance of an antisymmetric analog of the UQCM in recovering from the loss of n -k fermionic particles.\n\nMulti-million atom electronic structure calculations for quantum dots\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUsman, Muhammad\n\nQuantum dots grown by self-assembly process are typically constructed by 50,000 to 5,000,000 structural atoms which confine a small, countable number of extra electrons or holes in a space that is comparable in size to the electron wavelength. Under such conditions quantum dots can be interpreted as artificial atoms with the potential to be custom tailored to new functionality. In the past decade or so, these nanostructures have attracted significant experimental and theoretical attention in the field of nanoscience. The new and tunable optical and electrical properties of these artificial atoms have been proposed in a variety of different fields, for example in communication and computing systems, medical and quantum computing applications. Predictive and quantitative modeling and simulation of these structures can help to narrow down the vast design space to a range that is experimentally affordable and move this part of nanoscience to nano-Technology. Modeling of such quantum dots pose a formidable challenge to theoretical physicists because: (1) Strain originating from the lattice mismatch of the materials penetrates deep inside the buffer surrounding the quantum dots and require large scale (multi-million atom) simulations to correctly capture its effect on the electronic structure, (2) The interface roughness, the alloy randomness, and the atomistic granularity require the calculation of electronic structure at the atomistic scale. Most of the current or past theoretical calculations are based on continuum approach such as effective mass approximation or k.p modeling capturing either no or one of the above mentioned effects, thus missing some of the essential physics. The Objectives of this thesis are: (1) to model and simulate the experimental quantum dot topologies at the atomistic scale; (2) to theoretically explore the essential physics i.e. long range strain, linear and quadratic piezoelectricity, interband optical transition strengths, quantum confined\n\nMolecular Model of a Quantum Dot Beyond the Constant Interaction Approximation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTemirov, Ruslan; Green, Matthew F.

Stefan\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe present a physically intuitive model of molecular quantum dots beyond the constant interaction approximation. It accurately describes their charging behavior and allows the extraction of important molecular properties that are otherwise experimentally inaccessible. The model is applied to data recorded with a noncontact atomic force microscope on three different molecules that act as a quantum dot when attached to the microscope tip. The results are in excellent agreement with first-principles simulations.\n\nA new class of ensemble conserving algorithms for approximate quantum dynamics: Theoretical formulation and model problems.\n\nPubMed\n\nSmith, Kyle K G; Poulsen, Jens Aage; Nyman, Gunnar; Rossky, Peter J\n\n2015-06-28\n\nWe develop two classes of quasi-classical dynamics that are shown to conserve the initial quantum ensemble when used in combination with the Feynman-Kleinert approximation of the density operator. These dynamics are used to improve the Feynman-Kleinert implementation of the classical Wigner approximation for the evaluation of quantum time correlation functions known as Feynman-Kleinert linearized path-integral. As shown, both classes of dynamics are able to recover the exact classical and high temperature limits of the quantum time correlation function, while a subset is able to recover the exact harmonic limit. A comparison of the approximate quantum time correlation functions obtained from both classes of dynamics is made with the exact results for the challenging model problems of the quartic and double-well potentials. It is found that these dynamics provide a great improvement over the classical Wigner approximation, in which purely classical dynamics are used. In a special case, our first method becomes identical to centroid molecular dynamics.\n\nQuantum-chemical Calculations in the Study of Antitumour Compounds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLuzhkov, V.

Preparations whose action involves alkylating and free-radial mechanisms, complex-forming agents, and antimetabolites are considered. Modern quantum-chemical methods for calculations on biologically active substances are described.

Close coupling calculations were complemented by coupled states studies at high energies and provide about 10200 two-body state-to state cross sections from which the needed one-body cross-sections may be obtained. For such temperatures, convergence has to be thoroughly analyzed since such conditions are close to the limit of current computational feasibility. This has been done using complementary calculations based on the energy corrected sudden formalism. Agreement of these quantum predictions with experimental data is good, but the main goal of this work is to provide a benchmark relaxation matrix for testing more approximate methods which remain of a great utility for complex molecular systems at room (and higher) temperatures.\n\nConnection between the regular approximation and the normalized elimination of the small component in relativistic quantum theory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFilatov, Michael; Cremer, Dieter\n\n2005-02-01\n\nThe regular approximation to the normalized elimination of the small component (NESC) in the modified Dirac equation has been developed and presented in matrix form. The matrix form of the infinite-order regular approximation (IORA) expressions, obtained in [Filatov and Cremer, J. Chem. Phys. 118, 6741 (2003)] using the resolution of the identity, is the exact matrix representation and corresponds to the zeroth-order regular approximation to NESC (NESC-ZORA). Because IORA (=NESC-ZORA) is a variationally stable method, it was used as a suitable starting point for the development of the second-order regular approximation to NESC (NESC-SORA). As shown for hydrogenlike ions, NESC-SORA energies are closer to the exact Dirac energies than the energies from the fifth-order Douglas-Kroll approximation, which is much more computationally demanding than NESC-SORA. For the application of IORA (=NESC-ZORA) and NESC-SORA to many-electron systems, the number of the two-electron integrals that need to be evaluated (identical to the number of the two-electron integrals of a full Dirac-Hartree-Fock calculation) was drastically reduced by using the resolution of the identity technique. An approximation was derived, which requires only the two-electron integrals of a nonrelativistic calculation. The accuracy of this approach was demonstrated for heliumlike ions. The total energy based on the approximate integrals deviates from the energy calculated with the exact integrals by less than 5Ã10-9hartree units. NESC-ZORA and NESC-SORA can easily be implemented in any nonrelativistic quantum chemical program. Their application is comparable in cost with that of nonrelativistic methods. The methods can be run with density functional theory and any wave function method. NESC-SORA has the advantage that it does not imply a picture change.\n\nComparison of cross sections from the quasi-classical trajectory method and the j(z)-conserving centrifugal sudden approximation with accurate quantum results for an atom-rigid nonlinear polyatomic collision\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchwenke, David W.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nWe report the results of a series of calculations of state-to-state integral cross sections for collisions between O and nonvibrating H2O in the gas phase on a model nonreactive potential energy surface. The dynamical methods used include converged quantum mechanical scattering calculations, the j(z) conserving centrifugal sudden (j(z)-CCS) approximation, and quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations. We consider three total energies 0.001, 0.002, and 0.005 E(h) and the nine initial states with rotational angular momentum less than or equal to 2 (h/2 pi). The j(z)-CCS approximation gives good results, while the QCT method can be quite unreliable for transitions to specific rotational sublevels. However, the QCT cross sections summed over final sublevels and averaged over initial sublevels are in better agreement with the quantum results.\n\nIncreasing the efficiency and accuracy of time-resolved electronic spectra calculations with on-the-fly ab initio quantum dynamics methods\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVanicek, Jiri\n\n2014-03-01\n\nRigorous quantum-mechanical calculations of coherent ultrafast electronic spectra remain difficult. I will present several approaches developed in our group that increase the efficiency and accuracy of such calculations: First, we justified the feasibility of evaluating time-resolved spectra of large systems by proving that the number of trajectories needed for convergence of the semiclassical dephasing representation/phase averaging is independent of dimensionality. Recently, we further accelerated this approximation with a cellular scheme employing inverse Weierstrass transform and optimal scaling of the cell size. The accuracy of potential energy surfaces was increased by combining the dephasing representation with accurate on-the-fly ab initio electronic structure calculations, including nonadiabatic and spin-orbit couplings. Finally, the inherent semiclassical approximation was removed in the exact quantum Gaussian dephasing representation, in which semiclassical trajectories are replaced by communicating frozen Gaussian basis functions evolving classically with an average Hamiltonian. Among other examples I will present an on-the-fly ab initio semiclassical dynamics calculation of the dispersed time-resolved stimulated emission spectrum of the 54-dimensional azulene. This research was supported by EPFL and by the Swiss National Science Foundation NCCR MUST (Molecular Ultrafast Science and Technology) and Grant No. 200021124936/1.\n\nAmortized entanglement of a quantum channel and approximately teleportation-simulable channels\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKaur, Eneet; Wilde, Mark M.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis paper defines the amortized entanglement of a quantum channel as the largest difference in entanglement between the output and the input of the channel, where entanglement is quantified by an arbitrary entanglement measure. We prove that the amortized entanglement of a channel obeys several desirable properties, and we also consider special cases such as the amortized relative entropy of entanglement and the amortized Rains relative entropy. These latter quantities are shown to be single-letter upper bounds on the secret-key-agreement and PPT-assisted quantum capacities of a quantum channel, respectively. Of especial interest is a uniform continuity bound for these latter two special cases of amortized entanglement, in which the deviation between the amortized entanglement of two channels is bounded from above by a simple function of the diamond norm of their difference and the output dimension of the channels. We then define approximately teleportation- and positive-partial-transpose-simulable (PPT-simulable) channels as those that are close in diamond norm to a channel which is either exactly teleportation- or PPT-simulable, respectively. These results then lead to single-letter upper bounds on the secret-key-agreement and PPT-assisted quantum capacities of channels that are approximately teleportation- or PPT-simulable, respectively. Finally, we generalize many of the concepts in the paper to the setting of general resource theories, defining the amortized resourcefulness of a channel and the notion of Î½-freely-simulable channels, connecting these concepts in an operational way as well.\n\nDielectric response of periodic systems from quantum Monte Carlo calculations.\n\nPubMed\n\nUmari, P; Willamson, A J; Galli, Giulia; Marzari, Nicola\n\n2005-11-11\n\nWe present a novel approach that allows us to calculate the dielectric response of periodic systems in the quantum Monte Carlo formalism. We employ a many-body generalization for the electric-enthalpy functional, where the coupling with the field is expressed via the Berry-phase formulation for the macroscopic polarization. A self-consistent local Hamiltonian then determines the ground-state wave function, allowing for accurate diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations where the polarization's fixed point is estimated from the average on an iterative sequence, sampled via forward walking. This approach has been validated for the case of an isolated hydrogen atom and then applied to a periodic system, to calculate the dielectric susceptibility of molecular-hydrogen chains. The results found are in excellent agreement with the best estimates obtained from the extrapolation of quantum-chemistry calculations.\n\nMultiple environment single system quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (MESS-QM/MM) calculations. 1. Estimation of polarization energies.\n\nPubMed\n\nSodt, Alexander J; Mei, Ye; KÃ¶nig, Gerhard; Tao, Peng; Steele, Ryan P; Brooks, Bernard R; Shao, Yihan\n\n2015-03-05\n\nIn combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) free energy calculations, it is often advantageous to have a frozen geometry for the quantum mechanical (QM) region. For such multiple-environment single-system (MESS) cases, two schemes are proposed here for estimating the polarization energy: the first scheme, termed MESS-E, involves a Roothaan step extrapolation of the self-consistent field (SCF) energy; whereas the other scheme, termed MESS-H, employs a Newton-Raphson correction using an approximate inverse electronic Hessian of the QM region (which is constructed only once). Both schemes are extremely efficient, because the expensive Fock updates and SCF iterations in standard QM/MM calculations are completely avoided at each configuration. They produce reasonably accurate QM/MM polarization energies: MESS-E can predict the polarization energy within 0.25 kcal/mol in terms of the mean signed error for two of our test cases, solvated methanol and solvated Î²-alanine, using the M06-2X or ÏB97X-D functionals; MESS-H can reproduce the polarization energy within 0.2 kcal/mol for these two cases and for the oxyluciferin-luciferase complex, if the approximate inverse electronic Hessians are constructed with sufficient accuracy.\n\nCoherent states, quantum gravity, and the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. I. General considerations\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStottmeister, Alexander, E-mail: alexander.stottmeister@gravity.fau.de; Thiemann, Thomas, E-mail: thomas.thiemann@gravity.fau.de\n\n2016-06-15\n\nThis article, as the first of three, aims at establishing the (time-dependent) Born-Oppenheimer approximation, in the sense of space adiabatic perturbation theory, for quantum systems constructed by techniques of the loop quantum gravity framework, especially the canonical formulation of the latter. The analysis presented here fits into a rather general framework and offers a solution to the problem of applying the usual Born-Oppenheimer ansatz for molecular (or structurally analogous) systems to more general quantum systems (e.g., spin-orbit models) by means of space adiabatic perturbation theory. The proposed solution is applied to a simple, finite dimensional model of interacting spin systems,moreÂ Â» which serves as a non-trivial, minimal model of the aforesaid problem. Furthermore, it is explained how the content of this article and its companion affect the possible extraction of quantum field theory on curved spacetime from loop quantum gravity (including matter fields).Â«Â less\n\nOnsets of hierarchy truncation and selfâconsistent Born approximation with quantum mechanics prescriptions invariance\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nZhang, Hou-Dao; Yan, YiJing, E-mail: yyan@ust.hk; iChEM and Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026\n\n2015-12-07\n\nThe issue of efficient hierarchy truncation is related to many approximate theories. In this paper, we revisit this issue from both the numerical efficiency and quantum mechanics prescription invariance aspects. The latter requires that the truncation approximation made in SchrÃ¶dinger picture, such as the quantum master equations and their selfâconsistentâBornâapproximation improvements, should be transferable to their Heisenbergâpicture correspondences, without further approximations. We address this issue with the dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM), which is a unique theory for the dynamics of not only reduced systems but also hybrid bath environments. We also highlight the DEOM theory is not only aboutmoreÂ Â» how its dynamical variables evolve in time, but also the underlying dissipaton algebra. We demonstrate this unique feature of DEOM with model systems and report some intriguing nonlinear Fano interferences characteristics that are experimentally measurable.Â«Â less\n\nInfinite variance in fermion quantum Monte Carlo calculations.\n\nPubMed\n\nShi, Hao; Zhang, Shiwei\n\n2016-03-01\n\nFor important classes of many-fermion problems, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods allow exact calculations of ground-state and finite-temperature properties without the sign problem. The list spans condensed matter, nuclear physics, and high-energy physics, including the half-filled repulsive Hubbard model, the spin-balanced atomic Fermi gas, and lattice quantum chromodynamics calculations at zero density with Wilson Fermions, and is growing rapidly as a number of problems have been discovered recently to be free of the sign problem. In these situations, QMC calculations are relied on to provide definitive answers. Their results are instrumental to our ability to understand and compute properties in fundamental models important to multiple subareas in quantum physics. It is shown, however, that the most commonly employed algorithms in such situations have an infinite variance problem. A diverging variance causes the estimated Monte Carlo statistical error bar to be incorrect, which can render the results of the calculation unreliable or meaningless. We discuss how to identify the infinite variance problem. An approach is then proposed to solve the problem. The solution does not require major modifications to standard algorithms, adding a \"bridge link\" to the imaginary-time path integral. The general idea is applicable to a variety of situations where the infinite variance problem may be present. Illustrative results are presented for the ground state of the Hubbard model at half-filling.\n\nLow rank approximation in G 0W 0 calculations\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nShao, MeiYue; Lin, Lin; Yang, Chao; ...\n\n2016-06-04\n\nThe single particle energies obtained in a Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculation are generally known to be poor approximations to electron excitation energies that are measured in tr ansport, tunneling and spectroscopic experiments such as photo-emission spectroscopy. The correction to these energies can be obtained from the poles of a single particle Greenâs function derived from a many-body perturbation theory. From a computational perspective, the accuracy and efficiency of such an approach depends on how a self energy term that properly accounts for dynamic screening of electrons is approximated. The G 0W 0 approximation is a widely used techniquemoreÂ Â» in which the self energy is expressed as the convolution of a noninteracting Greenâs function (G 0) and a screened Coulomb interaction (W 0) in the frequency domain. The computational cost associated with such a convolution is high due to the high complexity of evaluating W 0 at multiple frequencies. In this paper, we discuss how the cost of G 0W 0 calculation can be reduced by constructing a low rank approximation to the frequency dependent part of W 0 . In particular, we examine the effect of such a low rank approximation on the accuracy of the G 0W 0 approximation. We also discuss how the numerical convolution of G 0 and W 0 can be evaluated efficiently and accurately by using a contour deformation technique with an appropriate choice of the contour.Â«Â less\n\nA quantum relaxation-time approximation for finite fermion systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nReinhard, P.-G.; Suraud, E.\n\n2015-03-01\n\nWe propose a relaxation time approximation for the description of the dynamics of strongly excited fermion systems. Our approach is based on time-dependent density functional theory at the level of the local density approximation. This mean-field picture is augmented by collisional correlations handled in relaxation time approximation which is inspired from the corresponding semi-classical picture. The method involves the estimate of microscopic relaxation rates/times which is presently taken from the well established semi-classical experience. The relaxation time approximation implies evaluation of the instantaneous equilibrium state towards which the dynamical state is progressively driven at the pace of the microscopic relaxation time. As test case, we consider Na clusters of various sizes excited either by a swift ion projectile or by a short and intense laser pulse, driven in various dynamical regimes ranging from linear to strongly non-linear reactions. We observe a strong effect of dissipation on sensitive observables such as net ionization and angular distributions of emitted electrons. The effect is especially large for moderate excitations where typical relaxation/dissipation time scales efficiently compete with ionization for dissipating the available excitation energy. Technical details on the actual procedure to implement a working recipe of such a quantum relaxation approximation are given in appendices for completeness.\n\nTime-dependent quantum wave packet calculation for nonadiabatic F(2P3/2,2P1/2)+H2 reaction\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Yan; Xie, Ting-Xian; Han, Ke-Li; Zhang, John Z. H.\n\n2003-12-01\n\nIn this paper we present a time-dependent quantum wave packet calculation for the reaction of F(2P3/2,2P1/2)+H2 on the Alexander-Stark-Werner potential energy surface. The reaction probabilities and the integral cross sections for the reaction of F(2P3/2,2P1/2)+H2 (v=j=0) are computed using time-dependent quantum methods with the centrifugal sudden approximate. The results are compared with recent time-independent quantum calculations. The two-surface reaction probability for the initial ground spin-orbit state of J=0.5 is similar to the time-independent result obtained by Alexander et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 113, 11084 (2000)]. Our calculation also shows that electronic coupling has a relatively minor effect on the reactivity from the 2P3/2 state but a non-negligible one from the 2P1/2 state. By comparison with exact time-independent calculations, it is found that the Coriolis coupling plays a relatively minor role. In addition, most of the reactivity of the excited state of fluorine atom results from the spin-orbit coupling.\n\nHarmonic-phase path-integral approximation of thermal quantum correlation functions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRobertson, Christopher; Habershon, Scott\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe present an approximation to the thermal symmetric form of the quantum time-correlation function in the standard position path-integral representation. By transforming to a sum-and-difference position representation and then Taylor-expanding the potential energy surface of the system to second order, the resulting expression provides a harmonic weighting function that approximately recovers the contribution of the phase to the time-correlation function. This method is readily implemented in a Monte Carlo sampling scheme and provides exact results for harmonic potentials (for both linear and non-linear operators) and near-quantitative results for anharmonic systems for low temperatures and times that are likely to be relevant to condensed phase experiments. This article focuses on one-dimensional examples to provide insights into convergence and sampling properties, and we also discuss how this approximation method may be extended to many-dimensional systems.\n\n'Quantum interference with slits' revisited\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRothman, Tony; Boughn, Stephen\n\n2011-01-01\n\nMarcella has presented a straightforward technique employing the Dirac formalism to calculate single- and double-slit interference patterns. He claims that no reference is made to classical optics or scattering theory and that his method therefore provides a purely quantum mechanical description of these experiments. He also presents his calculation as if no approximations are employed. We show that he implicitly makes the same approximations found in classical treatments of interference and that no new physics has been introduced. At the same time, some of the quantum mechanical arguments Marcella gives are, at best, misleading.\n\nMultiple Environment Single System Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanical (MESS-QM/MM) Calculations. 1.

This new method is applied to inelastic transport in various semiconductor nanodevices. Detailed benchmarks with exact NEGF solutions show (1) a very good agreement between approximated and exact NEGF results, (2) a significant reduction of the required memory, and (3) a large reduction of the computational time (a factor of speed up as high as 150 times is observed). A non-recursive solution of the inelastic NEGF transport equations of a 1000 nm long resistor on standard hardware illustrates nicely the capability of this new method.\n\nThe Nature of Infinity in Quantum Field Calculations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKriske, Richard\n\n2011-05-01\n\nIn many textbooks on Quantum Field Theory it has been noted that an infinity is taken a circle and the flux is calculated from the A field in that manner. There are of course many such examples of this sort of calculation using infinity as a circle. This author would like to point out that if the three dimensions of space are curved and the one dimension of time is not, in say a four space, infinity is the horizon, which is not a circle but rather a sphere; as long as space-time is curved uniformly, smoothly and has positive curvature. This author believes the math may be in error, since maps of the CMBR seem to indicate a ``Swiss-Cheese'' type of topology, wherein the Sphere at infinity (the Horizon of the Universe), has holes in it that can readily be seen. This author believes that these irregularities most certainly have a calculable effect on QED, QCD and Quantum Field Theory.\n\nRecovering a full dimensional quantum rate constant from a reduced dimensionality calculation: Application to the OH+CO{r_arrow}H+CO{sub 2} reaction\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDzegilenko, F.N.; Bowman, J.M.\n\n1996-08-01\n\nTwo reduced dimensionality theories are used to calculate the thermal rate constant for the OH+CO{r_arrow}H+CO{sub 2} reaction. The standard theory employs energy-shift approximations to extract the full six degree-of-freedom quantum rate constant for this reaction from the previous two degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) quantum calculations of Hernandez and Clary [M.I. Hernandez and D.C. Clary, J. Chem. Phys. {bold 101}, 2779 (1994)]. Three extra bending modes and one extra {open_quote}{open_quote}spectator{close_quote}{close_quote} CO stretch mode are treated adiabatically in the harmonic fashion. The parameters of the exit channel transition state are used to evaluate the frequencies of those additional modes. A new reduced dimensionality theorymoreÂ Â» is also applied to this reaction. This theory explicitly addresses the finding from the 2-DOF calculations that the reaction proceeds mainly via complex formation. A J-shifting approximation has been used to take into account the initial states with non-zero values of total angular momentum in both reduced dimensionality theories. Cumulative reaction probabilities and thermal rate constants are calculated and compared with the previous quasiclassical and reduced dimensionality quantum calculations and with experiment. The rate constant from the new reduced dimensionality theory is between a factor of 5 and 100 times smaller than the statistical transition state theory result, and is in much better agreement with experiment. {copyright} {ital 1996 American Institute of Physics.}Â«Â less\n\nEfficient Calculation of Exact Exchange Within the Quantum Espresso Software Package\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBarnes, Taylor; Kurth, Thorsten; Carrier, Pierre; Wichmann, Nathan; Prendergast, David; Kent, Paul; Deslippe, Jack\n\nAccurate simulation of condensed matter at the nanoscale requires careful treatment of the exchange interaction between electrons. In the context of plane-wave DFT, these interactions are typically represented through the use of approximate functionals. Greater accuracy can often be obtained through the use of functionals that incorporate some fraction of exact exchange; however, evaluation of the exact exchange potential is often prohibitively expensive. We present an improved algorithm for the parallel computation of exact exchange in Quantum Espresso, an open-source software package for plane-wave DFT simulation. Through the use of aggressive load balancing and on-the-fly transformation of internal data structures, our code exhibits speedups of approximately an order of magnitude for practical calculations. Additional optimizations are presented targeting the many-core Intel Xeon-Phi ``Knights Landing'' architecture, which largely powers NERSC's new Cori system. We demonstrate the successful application of the code to difficult problems, including simulation of water at a platinum interface and computation of the X-ray absorption spectra of transition metal oxides.\n\nQuantum Approximate Methods for the Atomistic Modeling of Multicomponent Alloys.
