        "text": "Open Access: https://journals.openedition.org/genrehistoire/4983 Cet article examine les stratégies de genre et les stratégies sexuelles dans la Tunisie du début du XIX e siècle, en particulier les rituels de guérison pratiqués par les populations de la diaspora sub-saharienne et les tentatives des érudits et religieux musulmans pour les discipliner. Il s'appuiera sur une analyse approfondie de la naṣīḥa de 1808 écrite par le clerc d'Afrique de l'Ouest Aḥmad b. al-Qāḍī al-Timbuktāwī, dans laquelle il est demandé aux gouvernants tunisiens de bannir les pratiques religieuses des populations sub-sahariennes-essentiellement des esclaves-jugées non islamiques. En plus d'analyser de près la naṣīḥa, je la contextualise et la compare avec d'autres textes, littéraires ou non, de manière à « dévoiler » non seulement le discours de al-Timbuktāwī, mais aussi l'histoire des populations sub-sahariennes asservies et, plus largement, l'histoire sociale, culturelle et politique de la Tunisie du début du XIX e siècle. Je soutiens en effet que la demande de al-Timbuktāwī de bannir certains rituels était justifiée par des motifs religieux, mais qu'elle avait aussi pour but d'empêcher l'autorité et l'intimité sexuelle que ces rituels étaient censés favoriser, et je me demande dans quelle mesure ces pratiques liées au genre et au sexe étaient (ou n'étaient pas) perçues comme troublant l'ordre social et sexuel dans les familles tunisiennes. This article examines the gender and sexuality politics in early nineteenth-century Tunisia, with particular reference to the healing rituals performed by the diasporic sub-Saharans and the attempts at disciplining them by Muslim religious scholars. It does so through an in-depth analysis of a 1808 naṣīḥa penned by the West African scholar Aḥmad b. al-Qāḍī al-Timbuktāwī, where the Tunisian rulers are urged to ban the religious practices of the sub-Saharan populations—mainly slaves—which are deemed un-Islamic. In addition to close-reading the naṣīḥa, I contextualise and compare it with other texts and literature to ‘unveil’ not only al-Timbuktāwī’s discourse but also the history of enslaved sub-Saharans and the larger social, cultural and political history of early nineteenthcentury Tunisia. I argue that al-Timbuktāwī’s request to ban the rituals was religiously motivated, but it also aimed at preventing the leadership and sexual intimacy which the rituals allegedly promoted, and I investigate whether such gender and sexual practices were perceived as disrupting the domestic Tunisian social and sexual order (or not).\n\nInternational Workshop Margins, Marginality, Marginalization and Contestation in North Africa and Middle East, Paris 8 University I will focus on the aspect of the class composition connected to this event and raise questions around many terms that can be employed to refer to the pioneers of this revolutionary movement. In doing so, my intention is to connect a specifically Tunisian lineage of resistance – one that weaves together the politics of the anti-colonial fellaga, of the defiant mobility of the harraga and of the segregated communities of the houmani – with some reflections on the political relevance of instances of collective action originated from spaces of marginality. Each of the terms I will be exploring is intended to shed light on a particular feature of the revolutionary body. My reflection will start from Philip Rizk’s theorization of the Lumpenprecariat (Rizk, 2014) and the thematisation of the politics of the poor in the practice of the Ahl Al Kahf and Zwewla collectives. Furthermore, I will analyze the term underclass in order to start the reflection on the category, which finds itself outside of the working class in terms of formal labor. Aradau and Huysman’s revisited concept of mob (Aradau & Huysmans, 2009) will account for the centrality of the mobility practices, for the criminalization and, more importantly, for how these people have fearlessly stretched the margins of the political. I will then develop the idea of vanguard in direct connection to the 2016 Kasserine protests, based on a critique of vanguardism and on the concept of vanguard-function (Nunes, 2013; 2014). Joshua Clover’s work on the surplus population and riot (Clover, 2016) will then introduce the reflection on the contemporary reserve army and the conflicts between capital and labor through the lens of the struggles around production as opposed to the struggles around circulation, such as the riot. Finally, Sylvia Wynter’s liminal (Wynter, 1992; 2003) will help me imagine the nature of the collective invention that this revolution was a result of, by illustrating the specific type of knowledge that the liminal is a depositary and a constant innovator of; and by stressing out the importance of a highly dynamic “counter-world” ramified in between the articulations of the hegemonic. With this reflection on terms, for which I will draw from all these different knowledge practices, my aim is to avoid a teleological view of politics, and to rather underline the specificity of contemporary political collectivities and of their ongoing resistance practices.\n\nThe rights of Tunisian women have been safeguarded in the aftermath of Tunisia's popular uprising, despite initial and widespread fears of the contrary following the democratic victory of the Islamist Ennahdha party. Article 46 of the new constitution not only reinforces 'les droits acquis' of Tunisian women, but also seeks to expand them. The post-uprising preservation of women's rights can be explained by the persistent hegemony of the image of the professional, modern and emancipated 'Femme Tunisienne' – since independence presented as a role model for women to live up to – and its crucial role in the truth regime of Tunisian modernist identity ('Tunisianité'). In order to understand the (dis)continuities of this imaginary after the overthrow of Ben Ali, the paper traces the origins of the hegemonic yet ambiguous 'Femme' and discusses the role of Tunisia's women's movements in its reconstruction since the uprising.\n\nAfter the Protectorate ended in Tunisia, ethnography, a discipline disowned by local academics for being too primitive to analyse the fast-changing nature of the country, was recuperated in the mid-1960s by the Centre d’Arts et Traditions Populaires (CATP), the governmental body in charge of managing vernacular culture. Within the Centre, ethnography was used by researchers to serve the developmentarist paradigms supported by the Bourguiba government at the time. But this was not all. In a period which bore the stigma of colonialism and extreme modernisation, ethnography also assumed an important role of self-objectification and introspection. Its ambiguous status, as an emancipating tool developed in the colonising West, led to important interrogations within the CATP itself that echoed larger debates regarding the status of the social sciences in the postcolonial Arab World."
