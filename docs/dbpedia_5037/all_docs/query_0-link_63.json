        "text": "Tunisia 2 - 2 Saudi Arabia\n\nJaziri 22, Jaidi 90; al-Khatani 56, al-Jaber 84\n\nClick refresh for the latest updates, or use the energy emailing gemma.clarke@guardian.co.uk\n\nGemma Clarke\n\nWednesday June 14, 2006\n\nRandom facts about Tunisia\n\nTunisia gained independence from France in 1956, whereupon President Habib Bourguiba established a strict one-party state and ruled for 31 years.\n\nThe main sources of agriculture are olives, olive oil and grain. Military service is compulsory.\n\nThey were the first African side to win a game at the World Cup when they beat Mexico 3-1 in 1978. But it was a false dawn because they havent won a game at the tournament since.\n\nRandom facts about Saudi Arabia\n\nAbd Al-Aziz bin Abd al-Rahman Al Saud captured Arabia in 1902 and renamed it Saudi Arabia. One of his sons rules the country today as, according to basic law, the throne must remain in the hands of the aging sons and grandsons of the kingdom's founder.\n\nSaudi women are forbidden from attending any stadium unless they are completely segregated. Football was banned in the kingdom until 1951, although nobody really knows why.\n\nDont expect too many crazy celebrations if they win: Saudi striker Said al-Owairan, who scored a wonder goal at USA 94 against Belgium, was later spotted out on the town boozing and chatting up girls and subsequently jailed for a year.\n\nAt the last World Cup, Saudi Arabia conceded 12 goals and scored none. They lost 8-0 to Germany in their opening match\n\nThe teams:\n\nTunisia: 1-Ali Boumnijel; 6-Hatem Trabelsi, 18-David Jemmali, 3-Karim Haggui, 15-Radhi Jaidi; 20-Hamed Namouchi, 13-Riadh Bouazizi (c), 12-Jawher Mnari , 14-Adel Chedli; 9-Yassine Chikhaoui, 5-Ziad Jaziri\n\nSubs: Subs: Ayari, Ben Saada, Essediri, Ghodhbane, Gmamdia, Kasraoui, Melliti, Nafti, Nefzi, Saidi, Santos, Yahia.\n\nSaudi Arabia: 21-Mabrouk Zaid; 2-Ahmed Dokhi, 3-Redha Tuker, 4-Hamad Al Montashari, 13-Hussein Sulaimani (c); 6-Omar Al Ghamdi, 8-Mohammed Noor, 16-Khaled Aziz, 18-Nawaf Al Temyat, 14-Saud Khariri; 20-Yasser Al Qahtani\n\nSubs: Al Anbar, Al Bahri, Al Daeyea, Al Harthi, Al Jaber, Al Qadi, Al Shlhoub, Ameen, Khathran, Khojah, Massad, Mouath.\n\nReferee: Mark Shield (Australia)\n\nTeam news\n\nIt's the last of the first games!\n\nTunisias star striker, naturalised Brazilian Francileudo dos Santos, is out of the starting line-up after knacking his shin in a warm-up game.\n\nEr, I cant tell you any Saudi team news but I can tell you that theyve kept just three clean sheets in their last 17 friendly matches  against Palestine, Yemen and Togo.\n\nThe first email:\n\nReginald Bullock (honestly) thinks I've drawn the short straw in covering this match because, frankly, no one cares. What? It's the Arab derby people! As the Vengaboys once sang using computerised, nasal voice-enhancement: 'Let's have some fun!'\n\nThe punditry:\n\nThe ITV team are talking about Gary Neville and crabs. The crustaceans, obviously.\n\nThe second email:\n\n\" I care!\" sreams Jon Attaway. \"Mainly due to the immense misfortune of drawing Saudi Arabia in the office sweepstake.\"\n\nThe pre-match pride:\n\n'Defenders of the Fatherland' - the national anthem of Tunisia. It's a pretty catchy, trumpety number.\n\nNot to be outdone, the Saudi anthem is just as upbeat - and all the players are singing along very loudly.\n\nNick Hughes is pretty excited: \"It's games like this\n\nthat separate the true fans from the Johnny Come Lately Once Every Four Years World Cup Bandwaggon Hoppers!\" he roars.\n\n1 min: We're off! The Carthage Eagles against the Soldiers of the Desert. Tunisia have a goal kick already.\n\n2 mins: Tunisian defender Hatem Trabelsi displays his on-the-ball skills but then slips up, showing why he's always linked with a move to the Premiership but hasn't yet got one.\n\n4 mins: Ziad Jaziri takes a theatrical tumble wide on the right but the ref gives a throw-in to the Saudis.\n\n5 mins: Some more interesting facts about Saudi Arabia from Abbie Hudson:\n\n\"In Saudi Arabia, a woman reportedly may divorce her husband if he does not keep her supplied with coffee. Camel's milk is the most popular milk consumed in Saudi Arabia.\"\n\n7 mins: Some nice movement from the Tunsisian's, a little back-heel from Adel Chedli no less.\n\n8 mins: Corner to Tunisia, Chedli takes. Karim Hagni heads it down but it bounces wide. Alan Cooper wonders: \"Is this the first match between predominantly Muslim countries at a World Cup Finals?\"\n\n13 mins: Rob Hawthorne thinks it might be a good idea to crowbar in the phrase: 'Sheik Djibouti'. But that would be lame.\n\n15 mins: Al Temyat is bundled over - free-kick to the Saudis.\n\n16 mins: A good spell of pressure for the Saudis. Yassine Chikhaoui gives away a needless corner.\n\n17 mins: \"They do like a short corner, Saudi Arabia,\" intones ITV pundit Jon Champion as al-Tenyat gives the ball away by the corner flag. A snake charmer is busy playing his flute in the background.\n\n19 mins: al-Tenyat hoofs in a free-kick from the left but Trabelsi clears and continues up the field at pace. \"He likes nothing more than going forward,\" says Champion of the Tunisian DEFENDER.\n\n22 mins: GOOOOOAL! 1-0 Tunisia! Zied Jaziri volleys in after Redha Tukar haplessly heads against his own player. Horrific defending...\n\n26 mins: Jaziri is causing the Saudi defence all sorts of problems. \"To answer Alan Cooper's question,\" scoffs Alan Singleton. \"Morocco played Saudi Arabia in 1998.\"\n\n28 mins: David Ellis has piped up with some Tunisia trivia: \"You can only stand for the Tunisian Parliament if you are born to a Tunisian father.\" That's interesting.\n\n30 mins: Whistles from the crowd urge Saudi Arabia to attack. al-Doukhi whips in a cross but the keeper claims. Wasn't really worth whistling for, was it?\n\n32 mins: \"Folowing on from Sheikh Djibouti,\" Oliver Bullough says: \"Might it be a good idea to accuse some one of loitering within tent on the edge of the area?\" No, Oliver. It might not.\n\n34 mins: al-Khatani nearly heads the ball goalwards, but cannot get past sturdy defensive stalwart Trabelsi.\n\nKarim Haggui is booked for a foul on al-Temyat. Free-kick to the Saudis.\n\n36 mins: Bouazizi is booked for charging down the free-kick and the referee orders a retake. Redha Tukar hoicks in a curling ball but Boummjel claims easily.\n\n38 mins: Tukar prevents Radhi Jaidi from getting a clear header on target and concedes a corner. The keeper comes out, arms flailing, but the corner is too long and drifts into touch.\n\n41 mins: Another outstanding Tunisia fact, courtesy of Andrew Baker: \"In Tunisia there are 26 TV stations, with 76 reporters.\" Does anyone have anything better?\n\n44 mins: The debate about Muslim countries meeting in the World Cup rages as al-Tenyat's 25-yard effort curls wide. \"Morocco and Saudi Arabia did not meet in 1998,\" says James Davies. \"They were seeded in different groups and neither got past the group stages.\" But they did meet in 1994, when the Saudis won 2-1.\n\n45 mins: Mohammed Noor earns a free-kick as the half draws to a close. In fact, they were so slow in taking it, the ref blows the whistle.\n\nHalf-time team talk: To sheild you from the half-time chuckling of Ally McCoist, lets seek out some interesting comments. The ITV team are talking about Gary Neville again anyway.\n\nProfessor Alan Cobley claims Tunisia is the only country to be named after a fish. I guess that makes it a pretty unique plaice.\n\nRoeland Hidding claims that: \"Saudi diplomats are said to have 367 outstanding parking fines in Britain.\" But he could have made that up. We'll never know.\n\nAnd Kevin Gibsin was disappointed by a poor first-half performance from the Saudis, \"I was hoping they would Mecca game of it.\"\n\n45 mins: \"Another security lapse!\" Jon Champion huffs as a pitch invader with Tunisian flag escapes from the stands.\n\n45 mins: And we're under way again. The Saudis have possession.\n\n47 mins: Noor squanders an excellent chance, toe-poking the ball into Boummjel's arms. \"He was just too slow,\" Jim Beglin explains.\n\n49 mins: The Saudis have started brightly in the second half. Bouazizi handballs it and the Saudis have a free-kick.\n\n51 mins: al-Tenyat thumps it over the bar and Tunisia regain possession.\n\n54 mins: No cut-away shots to the players' wives as yet.\n\n56 mins: GGGGGGGOAL! The most expensive footballer in Saudi history draws the Saudis level. Noor sets it up for al-Khatani to cleverly flick the ball over Zaid.\n\n58 mins: It's Saudi Arabia's first goal from open play in the World Cup since 1994 donchaknow.\n\n61 mins: Apparently, says Andrew Bliss: \"In Tunisia, to bring a guest through the kitchen door is humiliating to the house owner. Worse would be if the guest sees the house owner eating a cactus fruit.\" So, there you go. Even more offensive is being pegged back in a World Cup match.\n\n63 mins: al-Khatani's shot blocked, the follow up from al-Tenyat is held by Boummjel. Tunisia are losing their shape like a big, shapeless thing.\n\n66 mins: Birmingham midfielder Medhi Nafti came on for Tunisia skipper Bouazizi by the way.\n\n66 mins: \"Could you detail the Saudi goal celebration?\" asks Tom McDonnell. Yes, it was big, jubilant bundle.\n\n68 mins: Tunisian substitution: Chedli comes off for Ghodbane, then has a little strop.\n\n70 mins: Tunisia are passing the ball around quite nicely but the final ball is nowhere to be seen.Stephen Lenthall quite rightly asks: \"Has Professor Alan Cobley never heard of Sardinia?\"\n\n72 mins: Goalkeeper Zaid has gone down clutching his foot. Jon Champion is keen to point out that his potential subsitute Al Daeyea is the most capped player in the world. The physio has given him a bottle of water - isn't that against the rules?\n\n75 mins: Some Saudi substitutions: al-Hawsawi comes on for al-Temyat and Mohammed Noor is replaced by Mohammed Ameen.\n\n77 mins: But wait, \"Sardinia is not a country but merely a region,\" adds Navraj Singh Ghaleigh.\n\n79 mins: The referee thrusts a yellow card at Chikhaoui. I don't know what for. Neither do the ITV commentators.\n\n80 mins: Another Saudi sub? 'The veteran' Sami al-Jaber is coming on for the goalscorer al-Khatani.\n\n82 mins: It's al-Jaber's 161st cap. He once played for Wolves under Colin Lee in a league cup defeat at Grimsby.\n\n83 mins: Jon Champion has just informed all that Tunisia are celebrating the 50th anniversary of their independence - where was that fact, eh people?\n\n84 mins: GOAAAALLL! Incredible stuff! Within seconds of coming on al-Jaber has put the Saudis ahead in his fourth World Cup\" Tunisia were caught on the break and al-Jaber took advantage with an excellent finish.\n\n86 mins: Roger LeMerre looks miffed.\n\n88 mins: The substitue Godbhan just came fist-clenchingly close for Tunisia. An excellent strike from the edge of the box but it sailed narrowly over the bar.\n\n91 mins: Erik Fossen informs us of some Swedish commentary: \"Hvilket innhopp, said the Swedish tv commentator. Which means \"what an entry!\" Oof, Sulimani's free-kick is palmed past the post by Zaid.\n\n93 mins: GGGGGOOOOAAALLL!!!! It's 2-2! Would you Adam and Eve it? Radhi Jaidi becomes the first Bolton player to score at a World Cup since 1954 with a header down in the box from Jaziri's testing cross.\n\n94 mins: It's all over! How exciting was that?"
