        "text": "North Africa\n\nNorth Africa is undergoing major transformations; it is an area where business is booming and where vibrant civil societies are emerging. This region, which lies alongside the Mediterranean, has acquired strategic signiﬁcance not only for North Africans themselves, but also for Europe, a close neighbor, and the United States, the world hegemonic power. However, despite the substantial, positive changes taking place, the region remains dominated by despotic regimes unwilling to allow genuine democratic transitions. This book addresses salient aspects of contemporary developments in the Maghreb region (Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia, as well as developments concerning the Western Sahara conﬂict). The contributors, all leading scholars in their respective ﬁelds, provide thorough understanding of the evolution of those countries and the problems, such as terrorism, Islamism, migration, political oppression, and the socioeconomic imbalances, which have delayed the development of each nation. With proﬁles of individual countries and regional issues, such as migration, gender, integration, economics, and war in Western Sahara, as well as a section dealing with international relations and the Maghreb, including US and EU foreign policy and security issues, North Africa: Politics, Region, and the Limits of Transformation is a major resource for all students of Middle Eastern Studies and North African Politics.

Quandt\n\nAt a time when Middle East crises—Iraq, Iran, Palestine, and Lebanon— are front-page news every day, many may be surprised to learn, as this volume makes clear, that one signiﬁcant part of the Arab world, the Maghreb, is engaged in the mundane tasks of development without exceptional turmoil or violence. With a population of around 85 million, this region provides relief from the horriﬁc events of the eastern Arab world, while nonetheless reminding us of how challenging the processes of economic and political reform can be. This is a region where slow strides forward are being made, but there are no dramatic success stories as in Southeast Asia. But then again, no disasters seem to be looming on the horizon either. And, with the holding of democratic elections in Mauritania in spring 2007, one might even say that the least developed of the Maghreb countries is well ahead of many others in the Arab-Islamic world. A snapshot taken in early 2007 would show that the three key Maghreb states of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia are engaged in long-running efforts to deal with a host of political, economic, and social problems. My own take on these three cases—I will not comment very much on Libya or Mauritania, since I know less about them—is that Morocco has probably done the best in recent years to overcome some of its historical deﬁcits. But, according to the UNDP, it is clearly Tunisia that has outdistanced the others in terms of overall human development. According to the 2006 Human Development Report, Tunisia ranked 87th in the world, followed by Algeria at 102 and Morocco at 123. (The index is a composite of measures of per capita income, education, literacy, and longevity. Mauritania ranks near the bottom, at 153; Libya, largely due to oil wealth, is listed at 64). Under the late King Hassan II, Morocco enjoyed stability, but we now know that the cost in terms of human rights was high. The current monarch, King Mohammed VI, widely considered something of a lightweight at his accession, has won considerable support among Moroccan citizens by opening the doors of prisons, by shining a light on abuses of the past, and by introducing fairly progressive legislation concerning the status of women. In addition, he travels around the country meeting with people and distributing some of the regime’s largesse. On balance, the economy has been\n\nxviii\n\nWilliam B. Quandt\n\ngrowing at a fairly good rate in recent years, which also enhances the regime’s popularity. The monarch’s devotion to water sports has earned him the title Sa MaJetSki, and Moroccans today do not seem to be afraid of poking a bit of fun at their rulers. Despite these positive developments, Morocco still faces a huge gap between rural and urban areas, between rich and poor, between educated and illiterate. But the country seems to be on the move. As Gregory White correctly notes in his chapter on Morocco, the upcoming parliamentary elections in September 2007 will be a real test for the liberalizing tendencies within the regime. The PJD (Parti de la Justice et du De´veloppement) stands poised to do well in the elections, and many believe the regime will think twice before allowing an Islamist party—even a supposedly moderate one—to win a free election. Of course, even if the PJD does win, there is a precedent for the King to retain control of key security ministries, so there might be an outcome that preserves a large measure of power in the hands of the monarch. Stay tuned. I, for one, am fairly hopeful that Morocco will move steadily along a promising path. Algeria is a harder case to summarize than Morocco, in part because of the ‘‘black’’ and ‘‘red’’ decades of the 1980s and 1990s, respectively. If one were to have looked at Algeria from the perspective of the mid-1990s, the picture would have been very grim indeed. After a period of gradual liberalization in the 1980s, that had done little to address the underlying socioeconomic problems, there had been countrywide demonstrations in October 1988 calling for a change of policies and of regime. The response was surprising. In 1989, Algeria revised its constitution, allowed new political parties to form, as well as civil society groups and a relatively free press. For the next two years Algeria seemed to be the pace setter for democratic reforms in the Middle East and North Africa. But this all came to an end with the legislative elections of December 1991–January 1992. With the ﬁrst round of the elections showing that the Front Islamique du Salut (FIS) was well ahead of the historic nationalist party, the Front de Libe´ration Nationale (FLN), the military stepped in to depose the president, to cancel the elections and to ban the FIS. Before long, radical Islamists had begun to take up arms, and by the mid-1990s Algerians were dying in political violence between the regime and the Islamists at the rate of at least a 1,000 per month. Some observers placed most of the blame on the FIS and its offshoots, others on the regime. From either perspective, the reality was shocking, especially in a country that had already paid such a high price for achieving its independence. If we now jump forward to early 2007, the picture looks considerably better, although not without troubling signs. First, the level of violence has dropped dramatically. One still reads about the occasional incident, usually in remote parts of the country, but on the whole life has returned to normal. The end of the insurgency came in several stages. First, toward the end of the 1990s, the military reached a truce with one of the largest Isla-\n\nForeword\n\nxix\n\nmist factions, the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS). Most of the ﬁghters laid down their arms in return for amnesty. Over the next several years, the amnesty was extended to other groups, and the military intensiﬁed its operations against militant holdouts. The remaining insurgents of the Salaﬁ Group for Predication and Combat (GSPC), now calling themselves al-Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb, are thought to number a few hundred at most. From the time of independence in 1962, the Algerian military had always played a central role in the nation’s politics. The crisis of the 1990s seemed to deepen the power of the military and security services. When Abdelaziz Bouteﬂika was elected president in 1999, he was clearly the candidate of the military. In fact, on the eve of the day of balloting, all other candidates withdrew, charging fraud. This was hardly an auspicious sign for those who hoped to see Algeria move in a democratic direction. But Bouteﬂika, who had earlier served as Algeria’s foreign minister (1963–79), was determined not to be just a ﬁgurehead. He set about trying to establish his own legitimacy by ending the conﬂict that had been tearing the country apart. His major initiative in his ﬁrst years in power was a somewhat controversial offer of near-blanket amnesty. Algerians voted overwhelmingly for the idea in a referendum held in September 2005. With a measure of domestic security restored, Bouteﬂika set about reinforcing his own power base. This involved regaining control over the FLN, which had become an opposition party, and then gradually freeing himself of the inﬂuence of key military ﬁgures—many of whom were forced to retire. As of 2007, he had made considerable progress along these lines, although close observers could still argue that key military and security ofﬁcials played an excessively powerful role in the political and economic life of the country. When he ran for re-election in 2004, Bouteﬂika actually won a contested election by a large margin without overt support from his former military patrons. Also on the plus side of the ledger is the relative openness of the Algerian press, one of the most impressive gains from the liberalization of the early 1990s. In recent years, the Internet and mobile phones have made rapid inroads in Algeria, all of which gives ordinary Algerians much more access to information than they have ever had before. This same phenomenon can also be seen in Morocco. A mixed blessing for Algeria has been its rentier economy, marked by an extremely high dependence on earnings from oil and gas exports (more than 90 percent). In recent years, when the world price of energy soared, this meant that Algeria’s revenues skyrocketed, so that by early 2007 the country had surplus reserves of over $80 billion, and much of its foreign debt had been repaid, totaling currently less than $5 billion, down from nearly $30 billion. Algeria was now able to contemplate major infrastructure investments that had long been deferred. But great wealth for the government does not always translate into improved living standards for ordinary Algerians. Instead, many complain\n\nxx\n\nWilliam B. Quandt\n\nthat they see little in their daily lives to reﬂect the windfall proﬁts that have come to Algeria. This leads to suspicions that those with power are misusing the country’s wealth and the charge of corruption in high places is readily heard. The availability of surplus revenues also reduces the pressure on the government to carry out reforms that might eventually strengthen the productive sectors of the economy. And, great wealth in the hands of the government has the effect of undermining opposition political parties and civil society, a setback for real hopes of democratization. Algeria entered 2007 with a number of question marks about the future. Some wonder about Bouteﬂika and a possible third mandate. According to the constitution, he is only allowed to ﬁnish his current second term. But there has been talk of amending the constitution to allow him to run again. At the same time, there have been rumors that his health is not so good, and that may make a third term less likely. One also has reason to wonder about which other political forces might come to the fore in the near future. The Islamist current seems to have lost momentum, but it is not at all clear who might step in if a political vacuum were to open up. One also must wonder what would happen if oil prices declined, as they did in the mid1980s. The underlying socioeconomic fabric of the country is still not so robust that it could easily stand major shocks. Over the next several years, most of the so-called ‘‘revolutionary generation’’ that has dominated Algeria’s political life will pass from the scene. We simply do not know what the new generation will be like. Many seem to share the modernist/nationalist views of their elders, but not all do. The educational system has a very mixed record. It has provided some degree of education for the masses, including hundreds of thousands of students now crowded into universities. But the quality of the education provided is open to question, and Algeria risks falling behind unless it can do something soon to improve the quality of instruction given to its students. So, Algeria still faces many challenges, but the path ahead is much brighter today than it was just ten years ago. Tunisia is the country of the Maghreb that seemed to be on its way to setting the standard for being a progressive social democracy. Indeed, many authors from an earlier era were conﬁdent that Tunisia, with its relatively small, homogeneous, and educated population, with its moderate early nationalist leadership, and with its progressive social and educational policies would indeed be a model of sorts. And, to a certain extent, that has been true. Many look at the social policies, the status of women, the level of literacy, the rate of economic growth, and the relatively egalitarian social structure and they conclude that Tunisia is doing well. What, then, is missing from the picture? Pick up a newspaper in Tunisia and you will be struck by how much less free it is than comparable publications in Morocco and Algeria. In fact, the political system as a whole remains quite closed to competition. While not quite a one-party state, Tunisia certainly ﬁts the mold of an authoritarian,\n\nForeword\n\nxxi\n\ndominant-party state. Part of the rationale for the limitation on political freedom is the fear that radical Islamists will take advantage of any political opening, as occurred in neighboring Algeria. Tunisia presents itself as the counter to the Algerian case, one of gradual movement on the political front, combined with serious efforts to advance in the social and economic arenas. Some talk of following the Chinese model, and there are some parallels, although China’s economic performance has far outstripped that of Tunisia. While there is much to admire in the Tunisian case, many observers also feel that it is time for the regime to open up, to allow more genuine contestation, and to prepare for an eventual transition to a fairly elected government. President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali has been in power for 20 years. As Larbi Sadiki argues in this book, Ben Ali has favored national unity over democracy, but in the Tunisian case one feels that more of the latter would pose little risk for the former. There is, of course, much more to say about the contemporary Maghreb. In its diversity, it presents us with a variety of models of development. Compared to the eastern Arab world, where the Arab–Israeli conﬂict and now Iraq have troubled the surrounding countries, the Maghreb seems less adversely affected by external inﬂuences.

I continue to believe that many of the trends in the region are positive and they may eventually result in relatively well-developed societies, in both the political and economic sense. William B. Quandt University of Virginia\n\nPreface\n\nThe rationale for producing this edited volume emerged during a discussion that Yahia H. Zoubir and Haizam Amirah-Ferna´ndez held in San Francisco in November 2004, while attending the Middle East Studies Association annual meeting there. The two of us felt that books on the Maghreb were lacking and that no major publication on the region had appeared in English since Zoubir’s edited volume, North Africa in Transition: State, Society, and Economic Transformation in the 1990s (University Press of Florida, 1999). We concluded that a sequel to that book was necessary; we thought that people interested in the Maghreb would be keen on learning about the major changes that have taken place in the region since the close of the 1990s. We shared our idea with Michael J. Willis, a contributor to this book, who enthusiastically supported it. During a meeting in Madrid in spring 2005, Michael provided some input as to the themes that we should include in the volume. Subsequently, we invited what we believe are some of the best specialists in Maghrebi studies. Our objective was to bring together scholars from the Maghreb region itself, Europe, and the United States. Despite our persistent attempts, we, unfortunately, did not succeed in getting a native Moroccan scholar either in Morocco or living abroad, to contribute a chapter. Nevertheless, we were pleased to secure the contribution of Gregory White, a leading Morocco scholar. We were also not fortunate to have more women contributors, despite several attempts; most of them already had other commitments and thus could not join us. Obtaining the commitment of leading scholars to contribute to an edited volume is not an easy task, especially when the chapters have to be original or have not been part of conference proceedings. We are truly privileged to have brought together 16 Maghreb experts for this volume. They have worked with us since summer 2005 and always abided by the deadlines that we set for them. They have revised their respective chapters, always taking into account the recent changes and our comments. They also followed our guidelines as well as the questions that we asked them to address. They made sure to consider the suggestions and criticisms the blind reviewers made. Three chapters in this volume are revised articles that have been published elsewhere. John P. Entelis’ chapter is a thoroughly revised and upda-\n\nPreface xxiii ted version of his, ‘‘The Democratic Imperative vs. the Authoritarian Impulse: The Maghrib State Between Transition and Terrorism,’’ published in The Middle East Journal, vol. 59, no. 4, fall 2005, pp. 537–58. We would like to thank The Middle East Journal for granting Dr. Entelis permission to republish the article, albeit in a different version. Larbi Sadiki’s chapter is a revised version of his article ‘‘The Search for Citizenship in Bin Ali’s Tunisia: Democracy versus Unity,’’ published in Political Studies, vol. 50, no. 3, 2002, pp. 497–513. We thank Political Studies for granting Dr. Sadiki permission to republish the article as a chapter in this volume. We felt that some of the other chapters (e.g., Entelis, Henry) contained sufﬁcient information regarding developments in various areas in Tunisia that we did not require Dr. Sadiki to follow the same guidelines as the other authors in Part I. We also thank Elcano Royal Institute for granting permission to republish a revised version of the working paper by Gonzalo Escribano and Alejandro V. Lorca, titled ‘‘Economic Reform in the Maghreb: From Stabilization to Modernization.’’ We cannot stress enough the fantastic collaboration that we have obtained from the contributors. We sincerely thank them for their promptness in making the changes we asked from them and in returning the revised versions to us in a timely fashion. We would also like to thank the blind reviewers whose comments have been extremely helpful in improving the quality of the manuscripts. Our thanks go as well to the President, Director, and Deputy Directors of the Elcano Royal Institute in Madrid for having supported this project from the beginning and for the Institute’s ﬁnancial support. We extend our sincere thanks to James ‘‘Joe’’ Whiting, Acquisitions Editor at Routledge, for his support and encouragements and to Natalja Mortensen for her patience and guidance. Stephen J. Thompson provided outstanding help during the production process. We are also thankful to Judith Oppenheimer for her skilful copy-editing of the manuscript, to Lindsey Williams for her meticulous proofreading, to Susan Boobies for doing the index, and to Imogen Crowle for diligent work on the bibliography. Jessica A. Eise provided valuable research and editorial support and Marisa Figueroa efﬁcient administrative assistance. Producing an edited volume is always arduous, and without the moral support of a number of people it would be an impossible task. Zoubir would like to thank his wife, Cynthia, for her incessant moral support and encouragement. This acknowledgment is no compensation for the missed weekends together but is a modest recognition of deep gratitude to her. He also wishes to thank his children, Nadia, Jamel, and Malek, who give him many reasons to be proud of them. Their unconditional support has been invaluable. Special thanks go also to his friend and co-editor for enduring the nagging but also for making him discover the wonderful Spanish cuisine during breaks from work in Madrid! Amirah-Ferna´ndez would like to dedicate this volume to Hisham, Isabel, Nadia, and Dina for their love and for\n\nxxiv North Africa being there always. A special thanks to Velina for being such a supportive and consistent person and to Jesu´s M. de Miguel for his constant encouragement and friendship. Many thanks go to Lucı´a for her inspiration and to those friends at Cafe´ Comercial who cheer up his mornings! Last, but by no means least, Amirah-Ferna´ndez would like to acknowledge that this book would not have been possible without the experience and patience of his coeditor and, above all, friend.\n\nIntroduction Yahia H. Zoubir and Haizam Amirah-Ferna´ndez\n\nThe Maghreb countries Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia have experienced important events and transformations since the 1980s. The ﬁve countries founded in 1989 the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), which aimed at regional integration. This union was triggered by domestic and international events. The most noteworthy domestic events have had important consequences for subsequent developments within each of these countries: popular uprising in Algeria in October 1988; liberalization process in Algeria and Morocco; rise of radical Islamism in Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and more recently in Morocco; and, socioeconomic difﬁculties in Morocco and Mauritania. External events, too, played a critical role in compelling the countries in the region to seek some sort of union to resolve and confront collectively their domestic problems: the lack of resolution of the Western Sahara conﬂict; the collapse of the Soviet bloc; the wave of democratization in Central and Eastern Europe; the rise of the United States to sole superpower status; Libya’s confrontation with the United States and the United Nations and US-imposed sanctions on Libya; and the European Union’s focus on the emerging markets in Eastern Europe rather than on the southern Mediterranean countries also played a critical role in inﬂuencing the Maghreb countries to seek unity in order to face the new challenges. However, due to their numerous differences (e.g., Algeria and Morocco’s disagreement over the conﬂict in Western Sahara, among other issues) this resulted in paralysis of the AMU. In the 1990s, the Algerian state was on the brink of collapse due to the armed conﬂict between security forces and radical Islamists, which ended only recently—though some terrorist groups still commit atrocities, albeit on a very small scale. While it has succeeded in stamping out the Islamist threat so far, the Tunisian regime has resorted to the most repressive measures to maintain one of the ﬁercest dictatorships in the Arab world. Libya suffered unbearable costs due to the sanctions (1992–2004), which led to discontent throughout the country and to a potential alliance between Islamists and the disgruntled military to weaken the authoritarian regime. Morocco has not been spared from such gloomy developments; the passing away of King Hassan II in July 1999 did not bring about the hoped-for\n\n2\n\nYahia H. Zoubir and Haizam Amirah-Ferna´ndez\n\nreforms under the rule of his son, Mohammed VI. For its part, Mauritania witnessed a coup on 3 August 2005. Clearly, the Maghreb is undergoing major changes. Positive or negative, such changes have had their limits. Furthermore, the regimes in place have yet to genuinely open up the political space and allow authentic democratization to take place. Even if the Algerian and Moroccan regimes have allowed some degree of democratization, they have not relinquished their tight grip on power. Thus, democratization moves at a much slower pace than what occurred in the former Communist bloc in Central and Eastern Europe. This volume deals with various salient aspects of contemporary developments in the Maghreb region. In order to cover the most signiﬁcant issues, the book, which brings together some of the leading experts in their respective ﬁelds, is divided into three sections: 1) The Maghreb states: the limits of transformation, 2) Regional issues in the contemporary Maghreb, and 3) Strategic and security relations of the Maghreb. In general, the authors in the ﬁrst section have reviewed the major developments that have taken place within each of the ﬁve Maghrebi countries and analyzed the ways through which the regimes have sought to resolve the challenges they have faced. The contributors have also addressed a number of issues and concentrated on the major transformations that occurred in the last decade. They have also analyzed political (elections, human rights, democratization, authoritarianism, Islamism) and economic (debt, integration into the WTO, negotiations with the US, Free Trade Zones with the EU and/or the United States, energy) developments and other salient issues, such as the role of the armed forces in politics, and freedom of the press. The ﬁrst section starts with an assessment of the dynamics that affect democratization and authoritarianism in the Central Maghreb. John P. Entelis points out that demands for democracy, political pluralism, and improvements in living standards continue to make themselves felt both within and outside society in the region. However, he argues that there is no reason to believe that the Maghreb’s robust authoritarianism will dissolve anytime soon. According to Entelis, continued state intransigence in the Maghreb makes it unlikely that necessary conditions currently exist for a democratic transition in which independent political parties can emerge. Ahmed Aghrout provides an overview of the major developments that Algeria has witnessed since the end of the 1980s and how they have inﬂuenced the political, economic, and social life of the country. He shows that there are signs of a gradual return to normality after the decade-long civil conﬂict, such as renewed institutional legitimacy, reduced levels of violence, and improved stability and security. However, the lack of progress in the socioeconomic and political reforms, despite the healthy ﬁnancial position boosted by rising oil prices, is causing large segments of Algerian society to become disillusioned. Aghrout believes that it remains to be seen how the Algerian regime will press ahead with this process of change while taking in\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nhand the deteriorating living standards in order to test its commitment to the democratic process. Over the past few years, Libya has re-established diplomatic and commercial relations with the rest of the world after having been an international outcast for more than a decade. Ronald Bruce St John analyzes Libya’s rehabilitation and the current reform process. He argues that the Libyan regime is interested in attracting new foreign investments, particularly in the hydrocarbons sector, and that the reform policy can be expected to follow a dual path, with reform proceeding much faster in the hydrocarbons sector than in other areas of the economy. St John does not expect economic reform to be accompanied by political liberalization. Mohameden Ould-Mey examines recent developments in Mauritania, a country that has not received much attention in the academic literature. He assesses Mauritania’s process of democratization in light of the ﬂuctuation between contested elections and military coups d’e´tat in the context of the country’s delicate geopolitical positioning. He points out the serious challenges that Mauritania faces in balancing geopolitics, improving political stability, strengthening social cohesion, and reducing poverty. Gregory W. White explores the developments that have taken place in Morocco since the accession to the throne of King Mohammed VI in July 1999. Despite important steps taken to pursue economic and political reforms in the early years of the new king’s reign, White argues that Morocco’s measured opening began to recede by 2002 and that crucial elements of the current reign have sustained the rudimental components of the Moroccan political system. He also argues that the discontent about the slow pace of change in Morocco’s society and the persistence of social problems continue to draw the appeal of radical Islamist groups and politicians. The last chapter in the ﬁrst section provides a critical assessment of Tunisia’s ‘‘democratic’’ gains and reverses nearly 20 years after Ben Ali’s bloodless coup d’e´tat of 7 November 1987. Larbi Sadiki considers that the regime has power but still lacks the required ﬂexibility to create a genuine democratic breakthrough. He places Tunisia in the Maghrebi context to conclude that stability has come at the expense of political pluralism and that ethnic homogeneity and national unity are not sufﬁcient conditions for genuine democratization. The section on regional issues is divided into ﬁve major themes. The ﬁrst theme focuses on the economies of the Maghreb. Gonzalo Escribano and Alejandro V. Lorca concentrate on the Maghrebi economies. Of particular interest is their handling of such issues as micro- and macroeconomic reforms, privatization, state control, parallel economies, Free Trade Zones, unemployment, external trade, deﬁcits, foreign debt, and intra-Maghrebi trade. Michael Collyer examines migration and the Maghrebi immigrant communities in Europe. Inevitably, the focal point is on the economics of migration, the policies on both sides of the Mediterranean, the effects of the\n\n4\n\nYahia H. Zoubir and Haizam Amirah-Ferna´ndez\n\nbrain drain, the consequences for the home states, and state relations with the immigrant communities. This is certainly an important topic, especially since it was mostly Maghrebi immigrants who committed the bombings in Madrid on 11 March 2004 that left almost 200 people dead and hundreds wounded. Miguel Hernando de Larramendi deals with intra-Maghrebi relations, particularly the status of the AMU, trade relations, and security affairs. He has also evaluated the cost of no-Maghreb (i.e., of the absence of regional integration) in an era when regionalization plays a key role in alleviating some of the negative impact of globalization. Hernando de Larramendi argues that the Maghrebi integration project does not constitute a priority in the diplomatic agenda of states in the region and analyzes the responses of the actors to the blockage of the integration project, as well as the strategies of accommodation of the regional actors to the new international context. Louisa Dris-Aı¨t-Hamadouche’s chapter deals with women in Maghrebi societies. She looks at the legal reforms, the formal representation of women, high-proﬁle women, as well as the role of feminist NGOs. She also points out the limits of women’s representation in the Maghrebi political systems, demonstrating that these limits are linked to both cultural and political reasons. She identiﬁes some prejudices found in Islamist discrimination against women, indicating that though all the political parties (liberal and conservative, government and opposition) speak about promotion of women’s role in the society, they do not abide by those promises. Michael J. Willis tackles the sensitive Berber question, which has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. He scrutinizes the World Berber Congress, the Kabylie events in Algeria and their spillover, the Royal Commission in Morocco, the dialogue between organized Berber groups and the states, Berber movements and parties and their relations with other parties be they secular or Islamist. The third part of the book deals with the strategic and security relations of the Maghrebi states; it, too, has been divided into a number of themes. In the ﬁrst chapter in this section, Cherif Dris deals with security issues: NATO and its relations with the Maghrebi states, intra-Maghrebi security, external menace, and intra-regional threats. He also tackles the debates on multilateralism in the security domain and how this applies to the region. He shows the structural and circumstantial obstacles, stressing the role of history, states’ perception of threats and national interest, and external factors. He demonstrates that the regional environment is not only encouraging Maghrebi cooperation but also in which way it is imposing it upon them. Furthermore, Dris focuses on increasing European and American concerns about illegal immigration, drug trafﬁcking, and terrorism and examines the similarities and differences between the ‘‘South’’ and the ‘‘North’’ in eradicating these threats. Yahia H. Zoubir analyzes US relations with the Maghreb in the pre- and post-9/11 periods. He focuses on the political, economic, and security\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nrelations as well as on the way the US has sought to balance its relationships with the two rivals in the region, Algeria and Morocco. The chapter also examines the US push for democratization in the Arab region and the question of Islamism in the Maghreb and how these are thwarted by security considerations, which seems more important in US eyes than promotion of democracy. Clement M. Henry’s chapter examines how the regimes of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia took advantage of new opportunities offered by the Bush Administration’s ‘‘Global War on Terror’’ (GWOT) while minimizing the risks. He argues that increased US assistance and military cooperation bolster the regimes’ coercive capabilities but distance those regimes further from their respective population. Henry also discusses how the GWOT has redeﬁned the region’s ‘‘strategic rents’’ and indicates how the US government might reassess them if advancing democracy were really at the heart of the strategy of the GWOT. George Joffe´ concentrates on the EU’s relation with the Maghreb. His primary focus is on the Euro–Mediterranean Partnership (EMP), European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), trade, and policymaking process toward the Maghreb. The European initiatives in the Mediterranean have created a new dynamic in the EU’s relationship with the southern Mediterranean states, made up mostly of the Maghreb region. Joffe´ looks at how these dynamics and initiatives have affected transatlantic ties. Jean-Franc¸ois Daguzan deals with France’s multifaceted relationship with the Maghreb. He shows how France seeks to develop a constantly renewed approach to its political relations with each country in order to preserve the special ties as well as trying to push the Maghrebi governments toward modernization at the economic and political levels. Daguzan also describes how France attempts to circumvent the European Union to avoid tackling certain ‘‘hot topics,’’ such as democracy, that could lead to direct confrontation with its European allies. He believes that the weight of colonization is strong and remains a sensitive issue and thus has an impact on France’s policy formulation toward the region. Haizam Amirah-Ferna´ndez focuses on Spain’s role in the region and analyzes how Spain has sought to balance its relations in the Maghreb, where it has considerable interests. He compares policies under different Spanish governments and their inﬂuence on Spain’s relations with its southern neighbors. Amirah-Ferna´ndez concentrates on economic interests, migration/immigration issues, territorial disputes (Western Sahara, the Parsley Islet crisis, and Ceuta and Melilla), and drug trafﬁcking, as well as recent developments in Spanish–Moroccan relations on the one hand and Spanish–Algerian relations on the other. Clearly, this book deals with the various facets of the Maghreb and practically all the challenges that Maghrebi states and societies are facing. It is a sequel to the book that Yahia H. Zoubir edited in 1999, titled, North Africa in Transition: State, Society, and Economic Transformation in the\n\n6\n\nYahia H. Zoubir and Haizam Amirah-Ferna´ndez\n\n1990s (Gainesville, FL: University Press of Florida, 1999). The stakes in the Maghreb for Europe and the United States, and for the local populations themselves, are tremendous, especially since the Algerian tragedy in the 1990s, the events of 9/11 in New York and Washington, and more recently the bombings in Casablanca in May 2003, Madrid in March 2004, and London in July 2005. This explains our decision to produce such a book. The editors take pride in having succeeded in bringing together scholars from Europe, the United States, and the Maghreb who endeavor to provide in-depth knowledge of the region. We gave authors a choice either to cover the Central Maghreb (Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia) or to expand their analysis to the ﬁve countries that make up the AMU, that is, the Central Maghreb plus Libya and Mauritania. The chapter on Tunisia is more theoretical in scope; however, given its pertinence and the fact that numerous contributors discussed current events in Tunisia, we thought that we should include the chapter as it is. Marseille and Madrid September 2007\n\nPart I\n\nThe Maghreb States The Limits of Transformation\n\n1\n\nDemocratic Desires and the Authoritarian Temptation in the Central Maghreb1 John P. Entelis\n\nAlgeria, Morocco, and Tunisia (as well as Libya and Mauritania, the two other members of the Arab Maghreb Union) stand at a crucial crossroads in their political evolution as they face simultaneous challenges from domestic, regional, and global forces. Despite all surface appearances to the contrary, all three central Maghrebi states are governed autocratically. As such, they will be unable to meet the upcoming threats to their political stability, social cohesion, cultural integrity, and economic viability. One result will be increased domestic, regional, and global tensions as militant forces seep through these sociopolitical fault lines, ﬁnding support from and identiﬁcation with similarly discontented co-religionists living in Europe. Terrorism is the most extreme manifestation of this diffused discontent made ‘‘legitimate’’ through an Islamic idiom of martyrdom. The demands for political pluralism, democracy, and transparency continue to make themselves felt both within and outside society.2 The Broader Middle East and North Africa Initiative3 is but one important and highly visible such effort originating from Washington, but similar appeals derive from diverse sources including international human rights organizations, NGOs, domestic political opponents both secular and Islamist, multilateral lending institutions, and regional groupings like the Arab League, which has produced three scathing reports, co-published with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), on the absence of political freedoms in all of the Arab world.4 Economically and socially as well, the demands for visible improvements in living standards and the quality of life cut across diverse social classes and occupational groupings. Despite repeated promises by ruling elites of signiﬁcant improvements in macro- and microeconomic performance through accelerated structural adjustments, expanded privatization efforts, increased foreign direct investment, implementing transparency and the rule of law, rooting out corruption and nepotism, and creating an overall environment conducive to productive human effort, the full potential of all three Maghrebi economies remains unrealized. These combined failures in the political and socioeconomic spheres have impacted negatively on migration ﬂows and levels of foreign remittances.\n\n10\n\nJohn P. Entelis\n\nSuch disruptions in critical ﬁnancial life-lines have disoriented co-religionists on both sides of the Mediterranean as Maghrebis surviving precariously in ghetto-like suburbs outside large, prosperous European cities mirror the situation of many of their Arab brothers and sisters living in the ‘‘homelands.’’5 Such conditions of political oppression, social marginalization, economic deprivation, and cultural alienation, whether perceived or real, have created a wide-ranging landscape of disaffected young people ever ready to engage in militant activity often catalyzed by religious invocation and Islamist appeal, inspiring, among the most fanatical of them, a sense of martyrdom justifying the use of terror, including suicide bombing.6 Thus, there now exists a complex and intricate web of interrelated forces connecting autocratic political orders with anemic levels of socioeconomic development impacting most directly on a broad swathe of alienated and angry youth at home and abroad who ﬁnd salvation in the cathartic appeals of a puritanical Islam communicated in the militant language of the urban mosque and the charismatic imam.7 To the extent that the West in general and the United States in particular are perceived as deeply implicated in the maintenance of this ‘‘unjust’’ system based on ‘‘oppression’’ and ‘‘exploitation,’’ they will be the natural targets for terrorists and terrorism. If this cycle of violence rooted in a complex interdependency is to be broken, it must begin with political change in the Maghreb itself. This chapter’s principal ﬁnding sees no fundamental political change taking place in any of the three North African countries in the near or intermediate future.8 Indeed, rather than ‘‘transitions to democracy’’ occurring, as many have suggested and even more have hoped, a ‘‘robust authoritarianism’’ has been maintained. At the same time, however, a vibrant civil society is also emerging which potentially can serve as the natural challenge to the autocratic state and thereby facilitate the evolution of a political society within which democracy can be nurtured, liberal or otherwise.9 Yet, to date, the state has succeeded in manipulating, co-opting, or coercing civil society’s most politically potent organizations—mass-based political parties both secular and Islamist.10 Despite the current preoccupation among academics and analysts with ‘‘democratic transition’’ in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), no such transition has taken place anywhere in the region, if only because the necessary precondition—the collapse of authoritarianism—has yet to take place.11 Save for the fully democratic election of non-state actor Mahmoud Abbas as president of the Palestinian Authority on 9 January 2005, and the relatively democratic election of Abdelaziz Bouteﬂika in 2004,12 no Arab leader has ever arrived to national-level power democratically. It is thus premature to assess the conditions for either democracy’s emergence or its eventual consolidation when political power remains ﬁrmly in the hands of the authoritarian state best represented by the tripartite pillars of control\n\nDemocratic Desires and the Authoritarian Temptation\n\n11\n\nand coercion—the military, the business technocracy, and the executive, whether presidential or monarchical. To be sure, the system’s harshest features have been softened through the establishment of so-called ‘‘liberal autocracies,’’ ‘‘illiberal democracies,’’13 or ‘‘quasi-democracies’’ involving ‘‘guided pluralism, controlled elections, and selective repression’’14 as currently in evidence, for example, in Jordan, Morocco, Yemen, Kuwait, Algeria, and Egypt. Yet, in the ﬁnal analysis, and despite a multitude of separate and overlapping domestic pressures and external incentives for substantive democratic change, power remains as it always has—in the hands of the unaccountable few governing over the unrepresented many.\n\nThe Authoritarian Impulse Michael Hudson’s prescient observation about Arab politics made 30 years ago is still fully applicable: ‘‘The central problem of government in the Arab world today is political legitimacy. The shortage of this indispensable political resource largely accounts for the volatile nature of Arab politics and the autocratic . . . character of all present governments.’’15 Numerous scholars have sought to explain this legitimacy deﬁcit and the concurrent durability of authoritarianism in the Arab world by identifying a number of overlapping causal and contributing factors. These conditions revolve around several broad categories of interpretation—economic explanations,16 cultural causes,17 political determinants,18 patterns of societalstate formation,19 the role of religion,20 and gender-based factors.21 Despite the current appeal of culturally based explanations for the authoritarian impulse, most analysts privilege more complex dynamics ‘‘involving economic growth and stagnation, social-structural transformation, state formation and institutional inertia, and ideological transformation.’’22 The strength, coherence, and effectiveness of the state’s coercive apparatus serve to highlight the ‘‘robustness’’ of authoritarianism. It is this robustness that provides the most useful framework of analysis in attempting to explain North Africa’s enduring authoritarianism. What are the broader comparative and theoretical assumptions about state capabilities, and will they help explain the sustainability of the security establishment (mukhabarat) in the face of internal challenges and external pressures? Focusing on the enabling capabilities of the national security state, Eva Bellin identiﬁes the following determinative conditions: the status of a country’s ﬁscal health, including access to rentier income in the form of oil and gas resources, geostrategic utility, and control of crucial transit facilities; the level and kind of international support networks; the degree of institutionalization of the military and whether it operates according to legal– rational criteria or patrimonial ones; the existence of popular political mobilization; and the use of perceived or real threats to state security.23\n\n12\n\nJohn P. Entelis\n\nThese do not encompass the full universe of possible reasons why North African authoritarianism remains so robust but they do identify critical structural factors that transcend issues of culture, history, personality, or religion that have often been invoked by analysts trying to explain MENA’s non-democratic ‘‘exceptionalism.’’24 One researcher has usefully summarized this overall pattern by stating that a set of interdependent institutional, economic, ideological, social, and geostrategic factors has created an adaptable ecology of repression, control, and partial openness. The web-like quality of this political ecosystem both helps partial autocracies to survive and makes their rulers unwilling to give up ﬁnal control over any strand of the whole.25 Each of the variables identiﬁed above applies to the Maghreb.\n\nFiscal Health It has been shown from experiences in Africa and elsewhere that there is a direct link between the state’s coercive capabilities and the maintenance of ﬁscal health. The mukhabarat cannot long endure if it lacks the ﬁnancial resources to pay its soldiers, purchase arms, upgrade equipment, maintain supplies, and acquire externally gathered intelligence data. When presumedto-be-strong states began to collapse in Africa, for example, as Bellin reminds us, it was because prolonged ﬁscal crisis had ‘‘hollowed out’’ the coercive apparatus of the state.26 In North Africa, while economies underperform and human and material resources are underutilized, the overall ﬁscal health of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia is sufﬁciently robust to sustain more than adequate expenditures on security apparatuses. In fact, the Maghreb ranks noticeably above average in the proportion of gross national product (GNP) spent on security, approaching 5 percent in 2000 as compared to the global average of 3.8 percent. Rentier income derived from such critical resources as oil and gas enables strong states to sustain elaborate coercive structures even if a country’s overall economic health is poor, as the case of Algeria so clearly demonstrates. While Morocco and Tunisia may lack these valuable resources in large enough quantities to make a ﬁnancial difference, other strategic rents such as foreign aid, tourism revenues, remittances from abroad, and so forth serve the same function of insuring that the state will pay itself ﬁrst, including covering the costs of maintaining bloated military and security forces.27 It should be noted that ‘‘strong’’ states are being deﬁned in a narrow coercive sense not as possessing enduring political legitimacy. Indeed, Ayubi’s distinction between a ‘‘strong’’ state and a ‘‘ﬁerce’’ state applies directly to the North African situation. As with the rest of the Arab world, the Maghreb state ‘‘is not a natural growth of its own socio-economic history or its own cultural and intellectual tradition.’’28 Instead, the North\n\nDemocratic Desires and the Authoritarian Temptation\n\n13\n\nAfrican state can better be understood as ‘‘ﬁerce’’ since, in order to preserve itself, it resorts to the use of raw power as its default function. It is not ‘‘strong,’’ because the Maghreb state ‘‘lacks the infrastructural power that enables [it] to penetrate society effectively through mechanisms such as taxation. [It also] lacks ideological hegemony (in a Gramscian sense) that would enable it to forge a historic social bloc that accepts the legitimacy of the ruling stratum.’’29 The state’s ‘‘ﬁerce’’ attributes are reinforced by its rentier status that enables the country’s ﬁscal health to remain disconnected from society’s productive economic forces, yet directly tied to the international political economy with its critical hydrocarbon lifeline. The connection between abundant oil rents and the aggrandizement of the authoritarian state, at the expense of an autonomous civil society, cannot be overemphasized. Sadiki summarizes this relationship accurately when he writes: [T]he huge returns from external oil rent have contributed primarily to aggrandizement of the state . . . This aggrandizement applies to both oil producers and non-producers. The former directly accrue billions of petrodollars from external oil rent. The latter . . . proﬁt from the Arab oil boom. . . . This latter group has become partly rentier economies. They rent labor, skills, and expertise to the scarcely populated Arab oilproducing states and thereby earn billions of dollars in remittances. Transfers of millions of Arab petrodollars either in the form of aid or investment are another factor in the equation. Petrodollars have endowed the Arab state with an independent resource to cement and reproduce itself.30 The current situation in Algeria best supports the observation Sadiki makes in the passage cited above. The huge hydrocarbon revenues in recent years have strengthened the authoritarian regime’s repressive capabilities. They have also helped the regime elicit the international support that it had lacked throughout the 1990s.\n\nInternational Support More than any other world region, the MENA’s sustained authoritarianism has been shaped by the successful maintenance of international support networks. While the Middle East portion of MENA has exploited these networks more extensively than the Maghreb, the latter has become a critical staging area in the ﬁght against Islamic terrorism. Representative examples of terrorist activities occurring in or originating from the region include the prolonged bloodletting taking place in Algeria since 1992,31 the terrorist bombing in Djerba in April 2002, the Casablanca suicide attacks in May 2003, the deadly explosions in Madrid in March 2004, and the murder of controversial Dutch ﬁlm-maker Theo van Gogh in November 2004 in\n\n14\n\nJohn P. Entelis\n\nAmsterdam by a Moroccan militant with ties to al-Qaeda. The war against global terrorism has signiﬁcantly raised the Maghreb’s geopolitical proﬁle, especially in American eyes. In so doing, ﬁghting terrorism has joined access to reliable oil and gas supplies as two key concerns justifying intense foreign involvement with existing army-backed regimes in Algeria, Morocco,32 and Tunisia. Among the unintended consequences of increased US and other international military, political, and economic assistance to all three Maghrebi countries has been a clamp-down on press freedoms, increased violations of human rights through random arrests of hundreds if not thousands of socalled Islamic terrorists in Morocco, and a general deterioration of political and civil rights.33 It is within such a degraded political environment that terrorism ﬁnds its most willing recruits. As Bellin has pointed out, in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and parts of Africa, the withdrawal of international backing for authoritarian states ‘‘triggered both an existential and ﬁnancial crisis for the regimes that often devastated both their will and capacity to carry on.’’34 Not only are such international withdrawals highly unlikely in the Maghreb but, as reported above, the region enjoys a unique position in the international arena that, given the importance of access to hydrocarbons and meeting the continuing challenge of Islamic terrorism, seems destined to be maintained into the indeﬁnite future.\n\nPatrimonialism The Maghreb security apparatuses are shot through with patrimonial inﬂuences seriously compromising their rational–legal, professional, and institutionalized pretensions.35 While Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia possess ‘‘professional’’ security forces, they are organized along patrimonial lines in which stafﬁng decisions are often ruled by cronyism, the distinction between public and private mission is blurred, leading to ﬂagrant corruption and abuse of power, and discipline is maintained through exploitation of primordial cleavage. The terrorist challenge confronting the region has worked to enhance state security resources through increased domestic expenditures for the military and expanded foreign arms assistance. Rather than forcing a further professionalization or institutionalization of the security apparatus, however, such increases have deepened patrimonial privileges to the advantage of state authority and at the expense of civil society. In all three Maghrebi countries the mukhabarat constitute the state’s most advantaged institution, serving as the bastion of elite privilege and guardian of regime interests. Even Tunisia’s security apparatus, once modest by Arab world standards, has ballooned under President Ben Ali, himself a military man.36 The decade-long civil war in Algeria and Morocco’s 30-year struggle in Western Sahara have further empowered the armed forces of both states.\n\nDemocratic Desires and the Authoritarian Temptation\n\n15\n\nIt seems unlikely that the authoritarian state will soon wither away or voluntarily relinquish power as long as the security apparatus, the linchpin of state survival, is permeated with patrimonial inﬂuence in which personalism pervades stafﬁng decisions, political reliability supersedes merit in promotions, intercorp and intracorp discipline is maintained by relying on balanced rivalry between primordial groups, the distinction between public and private is not scrupulously observed, and the military continues to serve as a major path to personal enrichment.37\n\nPopular Mobilization In other situations and in different world regions, the authoritarian state’s ability to maintain itself in power has been shaped by the degree to which it faces a high level of popular mobilization. Violently repressing or killing thousands of people in order to maintain authority carries huge political costs for the regime and is thus not used lightly or regularly. What is astonishing, but common, in the Maghreb is how infrequently and limitedly such popular mobilization has taken place in the modern period. Either society remains eerily passive, as in present-day Tunisia, or it erupts into civil war, as in Algeria. This is not to suggest that North Africa has not experienced or does not continue to experience sporadic social unrest, labor strikes, student demonstrations, or even anarchic outbursts as in the Berber uprising of 1980 and the October riots of 1988 in Algeria. Yet such public expressions of social discontent are rarely rooted in organized political movements reﬂecting ideological coherence and political purpose that would serve serious notice to state incumbents that the people’s wants and demands are to be taken seriously.38 Nowhere in North Africa, and indeed throughout the Arab world, for example, ‘‘do mammoth, cross-class coalitions mobilize on the streets to push for reform,’’ thus making the costs of repression relatively low for the regime.39 Only among Islamists have popular forces been capable of being mobilized in large numbers sufﬁcient to force incumbent regimes to think seriously about political reform, including the possibility of legitimizing a democratic transition.40 Yet, in every instance where political Islam has posed such a challenge in the Arab world, as in the cases of Jordan, Yemen, Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, and Morocco for example, the state has ultimately decided either to violently suppress such movements (Algeria, Egypt, Syria) or apply a combination of harsh legal constraints and political co-optation to delimit the movement’s inﬂuence, as in Jordan and Yemen (Tunisia has utilized both force and legal constraints). Where coercive measures have been applied, all three countries of North Africa have found external support, either directly or indirectly, for their actions. France and the US, for example, were virtually silent when the army staged a coup d’e´tat against an impending Islamist parliamentary victory in Algeria in January 1992.41\n\n16\n\nJohn P. Entelis\n\nAs long as civil societies exhibit a variety of socioeconomic and cultural cleavages and remain seriously divided along religious–secular, urban–rural, male–female, modern–traditional, literate–illiterate, and indigenous–global lines, it will be difﬁcult for high levels of popular mobilization to develop, thus facilitating the state’s ability to repress political reform and choose coercion over compromise when such challenges do emerge. It seems highly unlikely, for example, that what successfully transpired in Iran under the Islamic revolution will be duplicated anytime soon in the Maghreb. Indeed, the Iranian experience has served as an object lesson of what incumbent regimes need to do to insure that neither revolution nor democracy erupts in the Arab world.\n\nThe Question of Palestine Probably no single issue has so mobilized state and society in the Arab world as the question of Palestine. The conﬂict between Israel and Palestine touches virtually every emotional and political chord among Arabs, serving as the touchstone of Arab identity, integrity, and importance. To be sure, the military threat posed by Israel can serve as additional fodder for regimes seeking to further empower the security apparatus. Yet, as one researcher has accurately observed, ‘‘the arc of authoritarianism in the [MENA] region far exceeds the ﬂy-zone of the Israeli air force; that is, countries far removed from the epicenter of the [Palestinian–Israeli] conﬂict still share the region’s propensity for robust coercive apparatuses.’’42 Thus, the Palestinian issue in the Maghreb is less about enhancing security to protect against ‘‘Zionist aggression’’ than it is about further advantaging the state in its ability to stand up to the ideological, political, global as well as military challenge that Israel represents to the Arab world. The continuous suffering taking place in Palestine, as communicated daily on national and satellite television, serves to antagonize and anger vast majorities of Maghrebi peoples. Yet, rather than being transformed into an effective agent of popular mobilization against authoritarian rule, such anger is co-opted by incumbent regimes to further justify robust state power. Like Islamism, the question of Palestine has been effectively integrated into the political language of the state as a way to disarm and delegitimize potential opponents. This tactic of ideological co-optation of key symbols of popular mobilization such as Islamism and Palestine has undercut the ability of autonomous groups to develop a truly democratic if not liberal Islam while making compromise on the Palestinian issue more difﬁcult to achieve. As one observer has correctly pointed out, ‘‘the greatest obstacle to democracy is posed not by Islam but by military and intelligence organizations unaccountable to democratic authority.’’43 The result is a robust authoritarian state secure in the knowledge that neither domestic, regional, nor international forces can fundamentally alter its autocratic practices\n\nDemocratic Desires and the Authoritarian Temptation\n\n17\n\nwhich, in any case, have increasingly been repackaged as experiments in ‘‘democracy,’’ ‘‘liberalism,’’ and ‘‘reform.’’\n\nState–Society Dynamics Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia confront serious political, security, and socioeconomic challenges that only political reform and institutionalized democracy can help solve. Yet, in all three cases, robust authoritarianism rather than effective reform dominates regime policies. As reported above, several interrelated variables help explain this condition of enhanced state authority in the face of challenges from an increasingly animated civil society. Yet one wonders how long such inherently conﬂictive conditions can be maintained without causing further problems, some leading to the kind of extremist politics currently evident both within and outside the region. This chapter has argued that terrorism is one outcome of the failure to fundamentally reform and restructure Maghrebi political orders. It is no accident that despite widely varied socioeconomic conditions all three countries remain politically autocratic. Tunisia, for example, represents an exceptional case of a very successful albeit incomplete economic and social transformation. Tunisia Over the past years, signiﬁcant progress has been made in the country’s overall development. Tunisia today is a fully modern country with impressive quantitative and qualitative indicators supporting such a conclusion. It is common for a visitor to be particularly impressed by the level of political awareness and consciousness among society’s educated classes and their ability and willingness to talk openly about sensitive political issues albeit in private gatherings, yet in public places. Given this high level of socioeconomic development, cultural consciousness, and political sophistication it is that much more striking to observe the continued maintenance of a security state with all the trappings of police surveillance and intimidation.44 The widening gap between society’s material prosperity—nearly 75 percent of Tunisians own their own home— and its political primitiveness is reaching crisis proportions. Despite its draconian security measures, for example, the regime was unable either to stop terrorists from attacking a Jerba synagogue in April 2002 or to prevent scores, maybe even hundreds, of Tunisian nationals living in Europe and elsewhere from participating in terrorist activities, including involvement in the train bombings in Spain in March 2004.45 The pattern of state-led oppression has been maintained through a fused system of social liberalization on the one hand and political subjugation on the other. Yet this framework of control and coercion is operationalized through a democratic fac¸ade intended to convey a sense that democracy is\n\n18\n\nJohn P. Entelis\n\nalive and well in Tunisia. One such exercise in political manipulation took place with the October 2004 presidential and legislative elections, further reinforced by the May 2005 municipal election results in which the ruling Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD—Rassemblement Constitutionnel De´mocratique) party gained 4,098 seats out of the 4,366 being contested in the 269 communal electoral districts. To the surprise of no one, on 24 October 2004 Tunisians turned out in record numbers—91.5 percent of the country’s 4.6 million eligible voters— to re-elect President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali to a fourth consecutive ﬁveyear term. Voters also gave his ruling party, the RCD, an overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections held on the same day. The election results were never in doubt once Ben Ali had pushed through a constitutional amendment, approved in a landslide referendum in May 2002, which eliminated the three-term limit for presidents. Intentionally or not, Ben Ali seems to be following in the footsteps of his predecessor, Habib Bourguiba, whom he overthrew in a ‘‘constitutional coup’’ on 7 November 1987, partially in response to Bourguiba’s self-designation as ‘‘president for life.’’ The early optimism that the post-Bourguiba era would see the arrival of political pluralism if not democracy has been all but extinguished in the last 15 years as the president and his ruling party have come to dominate the political scene while eradicating all sources of opposition, secular or religious. To be sure, the regime has been enormously successful in pursuing progressive social policies as regards women’s rights and in advancing economic development—the country’s GNP per capita tops $3,500. But this success has simply added to the discontinuity that deﬁnes the Tunisian paradox in which enhanced material well-being coexists alongside a robust political authoritarianism. In part to offset a negative political proﬁle among actual and potential foreign allies and investors, the regime has contrived a carefully crafted but thoroughly transparent pseudo-democracy predicated on a tightly controlled political pluralism and predetermined electoral outcomes. The October 2004 elections were one manifestation of this political ploy. Determined to solidify his ‘‘democratic’’ credentials among his own people and his supporters in Europe and the United States, Ben Ali permitted three non-threatening candidates to contest his re-election, as compared to two competitors in 1999 and none in 1994 and 1989. Of these challengers, only Mohamed Ali Halouani, head of the Ettajdid Party (exCommunist) and representing a bloc of independent politicians under the ‘‘Democratic Initiative’’ label, publicly decried the results after obtaining just 0.95 percent of the vote. Mohamed Bouchiha, secretary-general of the Popular Unity Party (PUP—Parti de l’Unite´ Populaire), who also happens to be related to Ben Ali’s wife, received 3.78 percent,while Mounir Be´ji of the Liberal Social Party (PSL—Parti Social Libe´ral) obtained 0.79 percent.\n\nDemocratic Desires and the Authoritarian Temptation\n\n19\n\nNone of these government-approved candidates has a signiﬁcant political following nor does any challenge the President’s personality or policies. In the view of regime supporters, Ben Ali’s ‘‘modest’’ 94.48 percent victory, down from his previous highs of 99.7 percent, 99.6 percent, and 99.4 percent in 1989, 1994, and 1999 respectively, highlights the ‘‘contested’’ nature of the presidential election. The outcome of the parliamentary election paralleled that of the presidency. While not constitutionally mandated, four-ﬁfths of the legislature’s seats are effectively reserved for the ruling party while the remaining 20 percent are contested by the country’s seven ofﬁcially sanctioned opposition parties. Thus, of the total 189 seats in the unicameral parliament, the RCD won 152, and the remaining 37 seats were distributed among the Social Democratic Movement (MDS—Mouvement des De´mocrates Socialistes), the PUP, the Union of Democratic Unionist (UDU—Union De´mocratique Unioniste), Ettajdid, and PSL. The ruling party is especially proud of its commitment to make at least 25 percent of its candidates women. RCD women won 39 seats, compared to 20 in the previous parliament. Overall, 43 of the 189 newly elected deputies are women, one of the highest levels in the world. Unfortunately, for both men and women legislators, the Chamber of Deputies plays a marginal political role and its inﬂuence over national policy is virtually nil. None of the opposition parties represented in parliament challenge the regime’s hegemony or the absolute power of the presidency. The ‘‘real’’ opposition is banned, imprisoned, or harassed. It includes the still-popular Islamist party, An Nahda, headed by Rachid Ghannouchi, who lives in selfimposed exile in London. Modernist and secular ﬁgures representing a broad spectrum of political tendencies from liberal democrats (Moncef Marzouki) to communists (Hamma Hammami) to progressive socialists (Nejib Chebbi) have all decried the blatantly manipulative character of the political process. Outspoken journalists, human rights activists, academics, lawyers, and other public personalities have joined them in condemning the oppressive nature of political life where the media are tightly controlled, the Internet is monitored, and freedom of political expression is all but banned. Marzouki’s description of Ben Ali’s three-pronged policy accurately reﬂects the way this leader is perceived by these and other democratically inclined groups: ‘‘To remain indeﬁnitely in power, to remain indeﬁnitely in power, to remain indeﬁnitely in power.’’46 Morocco Morocco faces greater and potentially more lethal challenges as its socioeconomic performance remains modest at best and its political opening tepid and uneven. The Casablanca attacks of 16 May 2003 exposed the country’s vulnerabilities and the degree to which Moroccan nationals have been deeply implicated in a global network of loosely interrelated terrorist\n\n20\n\nJohn P. Entelis\n\ngroups.47 Interviews conducted in Spain with European and Moroccan respondents, for example, revealed the intensity of commitment to ‘‘militant Islam’’ as compared to the monarchy’s attempt to project a ‘‘moderate Islam.’’ Much of Morocco’s militancy has been self-induced. A radical interpretation of Islamic belief has become increasingly appealing to those frustrated by the failure of secular policies to deal with poverty, inequality, and corruption. In addition, Wahhabism has been propagated by preachers from Saudi Arabia and has won adherents, particularly among the marginalized classes of the urban areas. Wahhabi clerics were allowed to carry on their work because Saudi Arabia has been an important source of investment and ﬁnancial aid for Morocco, and the Moroccan and Saudi royal families have long had close ties. Prior to the Casablanca suicide bombings, the authorities had arrested members of radical Islamist groups active in the poorer neighborhoods of major Moroccan cities that had used violence to enforce their vision of Islam. They also began to shut down unauthorized mosques, and ban bookshops and itinerant booksellers peddling radical and inﬂammatory Islamist texts and prerecorded tapes. However, these measures did not prevent the 2003 suicide attacks, and, indeed, may even have helped to provoke them. The current wave of Islamic militancy in Morocco has spread across the globe, with evidence that Moroccan radicals, some with military training in Afghanistan, are deeply involved in terrorist activities. Moroccans have been implicated in terrorist networks involved in the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, the attacks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in May 2003, and the suicide bombings in Madrid, Spain in March 2004. According to intelligence reports, the Madrid bombers belonged to the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group (GICM, Groupe islamiste combattant marocain), formed in Afghanistan with links to Salaﬁa Jihadia (Salaﬁyya Jihadiyya, or Jihad for Pure Islam), a Moroccan extremist Islamist movement accused by Rabat of carrying out the Casablanca suicide bombings. One of those arrested in Spain is Jamal Zougam, who is reported to have links with both Mohamed Fizazi, the founder of Salaﬁa Jihadia currently in jail serving a 30-year sentence, and Amer Azizi, a Moroccan charged in 2003 with belonging to an alQaeda cell that helped to plan the September 11 attacks.48 Evidence provided by investigatory journalists, intelligence services, and government ofﬁcials in Morocco and Spain provides a chilling portrait of how frustrated, discontented, and deeply angry Moroccan youth living in poor quarters of big cities, especially in the north, have been recruited to militant activities, with some receiving training in Afghanistan, and then transformed into human explosives prepared to commit suicide in the name of some primordial interpretation of Islam that guarantees instant salvation through martyrdom. Many of these Islamists returning from Afghanistan have also found recruits among wealthier Moroccans who span two worlds\n\nDemocratic Desires and the Authoritarian Temptation\n\n21\n\nbut, frustrated by their secondary status in Europe, discovered a purpose in political Islam. ‘‘My brothers were not like this when they left Morocco,’’ said Jamal Benyaich, scion of a rich Tangier family whose eldest brother, Abdelaziz, has emerged as a central ﬁgure in the Moroccan militant network. Jamal’s other brothers, Salaheddin and Abdullah, both became Islamic ﬁghters, too. ‘‘They became Islamists in Europe,’’ he said. ‘‘All of them lived a very European life in Morocco but came back with a new personality.’’49 This is not to suggest that the European experience has been determinative in transforming beurs into jihadists.50 But one insider’s account of his Algerian ‘‘assassin brothers’’ does present a complex interaction of diverse experiences involving the workings of a jihadist cell, the radicalizing effects of exile from the Algerian civil war, and the challenges for a Western democracy (France) of assimilating Muslim immigrants.51 Although focusing speciﬁcally on Algerian militants in France, the making of a jihadist terrorist described by Sifaoui applies broadly across the Maghreb. The depth of terrorist activity involving Moroccans both in Europe and in Morocco itself was highlighted in a 25 July 2004 article in El Paı´s, Spain’s largest and most widely read newspaper, which reported the results of a government investigation into the Madrid bombings. According to Spanish investigators, Moroccan authorities had informed Madrid that it had lost track of 400 of the 600 Moroccans known to have trained in terrorist camps run by al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. The article also reported that Morocco had told Spanish ofﬁcials that it had more than 2,000 Islamic militants within its borders. Of the roughly 60 men suspected to be connected to the 11 March 2004 train bombings in Madrid, 40 are from Morocco, the article said. According to the Spanish judge heading the investigation into alQaeda’s presence in Spain, ‘‘the most serious problem that Europe has right now with this type of terrorism is in Morocco.’’52 In a separate but related terrorist investigation, Spanish authorities in October 2004 charged and jailed 33 Moroccans and Algerians involved in an alleged plot to slam a truck carrying 1,100 pounds of explosives into Madrid’s National Court, which is overseeing Spain’s anti-terror investigation related to the Madrid bombings of March 2004.53 The ideological and operational fusion of in-country and overseas Moroccan militants has raised the stakes for the government, whose survivalist strategy has led it to further limit rather than expand political and civil rights. Since the passage of a tough new anti-terrorism law that was rushed through the parliament in 2003 following the Casablanca bombings, thousands of terrorism suspects have been arrested. Numerous trials of arrested Islamic radicals have taken place, with severe sentences meted out to many. The result has been a return to some of the regime’s worst authoritarian excesses as practiced under Hassan II, including ﬂagrant abuses of human rights, like arbitrary arrest, torture, and unfair trials.54\n\n22\n\nJohn P. Entelis\n\nThe monarch’s July 2004 decision to build 20 new mosques throughout the country to operate under tight government supervision as a means by which to counter the plethora of unofﬁcial mosques in which self-appointed imams preach radical Islamic precepts reﬂects the regime’s basic incomprehension of the nature of the challenge it faces, which remains, at bottom, fundamentally political. In October 2006, Morocco canceled compulsory military service out of fear of radical activities within the barracks, but also the fear of providing martial training to potential terrorists. This came shortly after the dismantling of the Ansar Al Mahdi’ cell, led by an ofﬁcer in the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces.55 Algeria In Algeria, political liberalization in the form of relatively free, albeit controlled, presidential elections seems to be taking hold without necessarily, however, compromising the state’s ultimate command and control of polity and economy.56 President Bouteﬂika’s resounding electoral victory on 8 April 2004, when he secured 85 percent of the registered vote, provides the Algerian leader with another ﬁve years to try to overcome the country’s dismal socioeconomic conditions.57 As discussed earlier, a country’s ﬁscal health works to enhance the position and power of the security apparatus. With oil prices above the $60 per barrel range in 2006, Algeria’s macroeconomic proﬁle has improved. This has done little, however, to ameliorate the country’s microeconomic condition, which still ﬁnds ordinary Algerians struggling with the basic necessities of life. In the absence of a thorough and unambiguous democratic transformation of political life, and not withstanding the resignation in July 2004 of General Mohammed Lamari, the army’s most inﬂuential ﬁgure,58 most Algerians still believe that Bouteﬂika’s election serves merely to consolidate the power of the shadowy military elite that has held sway in one form or another since independence in 1962. In the Algerian press, robust and independent-minded by Arab standards,59 commentators have drawn parallels between Bouteﬂika and Ben Ali of Tunisia, accusing him of seeking to emulate the centralization of power achieved by his autocratic neighbor who, as discussed above, successfully amended the constitution so that he could run for a fourth term in October 2004 following his 99+ percent victories in 1989, 1994, and 1999.60 However, Bouteﬂika did not carry out his project in 2006; the planned referendum on the constitution was postponed, but has been put back on the agenda of the government following the legislative elections held in May 2007. While daily violence has declined and terrorist attacks are reduced, including the killing and capture of leading GSPC ﬁgures,61 the Algerian government’s human rights record as reported by numerous human rights monitoring organizations remains poor to very bad. Arbitrary arrests, prolonged incommunicado detentions, excessive use of force, extrajudicial\n\nDemocratic Desires and the Authoritarian Temptation\n\n23\n\nkillings, reported cases of torture, and ofﬁcial impunity have all been identiﬁed as routine practices of the regime. Similarly, deprivations of basic human and civil rights have taken place in the areas of speech, assembly, and political activity. Even Al-Jazeera’s Algiers bureau was forced to close following critical reports of the country’s security laws that have led to increases in short-term disappearances of prisoners deemed ‘‘threats to national security.’’ To be sure, until the armed insurgency and its expanding links to alQaeda’s jihad are completely squelched, the Algerian ‘‘crisis’’ will continue. Yet more decisive will be the need to resolve the system’s fundamental constitutional questions—‘‘the armed forces’ political role, presidential prerogatives, judicial independence, and, more generally, the problem of establishing law-bound government.’’62\n\nThe Democratic Imperative North Africa’s authoritarian impulse has sabotaged, at great human cost, all efforts to advance the region’s developmental goals. Rentier-based economies have empowered ‘‘the mukhabarat state with its military and police apparatuses. It continues to be able to reproduce itself and perfect its coercive capacity.’’63 Only a successful transition to a democratic system of rule involving, at minimum, application of Dahl’s dual polyarchical requirements of public contestation and the right to participate64 can overcome the current condition of political stasis, economic stagnation, social atrophy, and cultural discontinuity. Yet the one social class capable of animating civil society in its challenge to the authoritarian state remains remarkably indifferent, if not hostile, to pluralistic politics. Moore’s dictum of ‘‘no bourgeoisie, no democracy’’65 seems not to have taken hold in the Maghreb, where the professional middle class functions, at best, as ‘‘contingent democrats’’66 or ‘‘reluctant democrats.’’67 The potentially powerful and inﬂuential business communities in each of the three countries seem to want ‘‘money even more than they want political participation. If they can ﬁnd non-democratic ways to protect economic interests, they can live with that. [In the ﬁnal analysis,] businessmen, interested primarily in proﬁt, are more concerned with a regime’s effectiveness than with its openness: they want a state weak enough to loot but strong enough to be worth looting.’’68 The only social movements in Maghrebi countries insistent on democratic change, government ac"
