It analyzes the extent to which economic migration is figured in these texts as a form of exile, and considers the ways in which the relationship between \"home\" and \"exile\" is represented and manipulated in these narratives.\n\nI will consider in this article figurations and representations of exile in novels by three writers who in the 1990-2000 period published texts in Italian relating to their migration from their countries of birth to Italy. The novels are Immigrato (1990), by Salah Methnani (Tunisian), who co-wrote his novel with Italian writer, Mario Fortunato; Pantanella (1992), by Mohsen Melliti (also Tunisian); and Va e non torna (2000), by Ron Kubati (Albanian). Clearly, I am considering exile in an unconventional way, in a way perhaps contrary to that in which it is considered in other articles in this volume. The peculiarity of the types of exile I am examining can be described in various ways, which will be explored in the course of my discussion, but, as a preliminary step, I will enumerate some of the salient singularities of the notion of exile in texts in Italian by immigrant writers. (1) First is the issue of will: the writers I will concentrate on were none of them banished from their home country to Italy by means of a specific political edict; rather, they chose to emigrate. And yet the level to which this \"choice\" was suggested, encouraged, or even enforced by political, economic, and cultural circumstances is a complex and particularly interesting one, which I will discuss at greater length shortly. A second singularity in the types of exile I am considering is that Italy is the place to, rather than from, which the individual writer is exiled in these texts. Italy is the place of estrangement and exclusion, and the place which the reader, too, is led to read as strange, foreign, hostile, restrictive. Linked with this singularity, and shifting in the direction of specifically textual issues, is the fact that the Italian language in these texts is also a medium which is not only used to express estrangement, but which also in its very use voices an estrangement, a necessary adoption of an unfamiliar mode of expression. Finally, continuing in the same direction, we can identify these texts as a minority literature within the Italian tradition: a body of writing in part in exile within, or on the edges of, the Italian canon. (2)\n\nReturning first to the question of to what extent these authors are in exile, the Concise Oxford Dictionary defines exile as \"(state of) being expelled or long absence from one's native land.\" Already then, the possibility is offered of a voluntary displacement, but the difference between voluntary and involuntary departure from one's homeland is not a simple one: there are various shades of willingness and coercion between these two positions. The term exile in the contemporary context is perhaps most readily associated with artists and intellectuals, and has acquired historical, even romantic connotations. Edward Said comments on this, in his essay, \"Reflections on Exile\" (173-86). He describes some individual exiled poets and writers, and then continues:\n\nFrom them, it is apparent that, to concentrate on exile as a contemporary political punishment, you must therefore map territories of experience beyond those mapped by the literature of exile itself. You must first set aside Joyce and Nabokov and think instead of the uncountable masses for whom UN agencies have been created. You must think of the refugee-peasants with no prospect of ever returning home, armed only with a ration card and an agency number (175-76).\n\nSaid describes two extremes here: individual, dead, white, male intellectuals, and hordes of present-day, \"third-world,\" displaced persons. In order to understand the extent to which Albanian and Tunisian writers in Italy are exiles, it is helpful to break down Said's dichotomy. Individuals who, in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, are specifically and individually forced to leave their home countries for political or ideological reasons are most readily referred to not as exiles but as asylum-seekers. The penalty for not emigrating is often, in their case as in traditional concepts of exile, death. Those who find it necessary to emigrate, probably in larger numbers, because of critical political, economic or environmental conditions, are likely to be termed refugees. The alternative for them, too, is probably death. Those who find it, if not necessary, at least infinitely preferable, to emigrate, because of adverse political and economic conditions, are normally termed economic migrants. Their alternative is not death but severely curtailed personal freedom, due to political and/or economic constraints. The writers I discuss here fall largely into the latter category. (3)\n\nSo are they exiles? The answer must be yes, because even if they choose to leave their homeland, this choice is heavily weighted by circumstances. More to the point, however, and more interesting from the point of view of an analysis of exile in literature, is that the ways in which they are exiles point out that exile is not so much about the act of being banished or removed from one's home community, but about the condition of displacement. As Said rightly, I think, points out, exile is first and foremost \"a condition of terminal loss\" (173). In other words, whilst the initial move away from the home country may be willed and even longed for, prolonged absence brings with it regret, nostalgia, and the longing to return. Implicit in this process is a reversal: the desire to leave, once fulfilled, turns into the desire to return. And this is perhaps where the crucial difference lies between exile as conventionally perceived, particularly in literature, and the sort of exile experienced by the writers I shall discuss here: it is not so much a question of voluntary or involuntary migration--an act of will--as a complex operation of desire, with all the personal and collective illusions, deceptions, and distortions which the term suggests. This is not to say that conventional notions of exile exclude the operations of desire; of course, the condition of being exiled is dominated by the desire to regain the home territory and all it encompasses psychologically and emotionally. However, in the case of the writing I shall consider, there is a doubling and, again, a reversal of this desire, in the sense that the act of emigrating is itself the product of a desire for an elsewhere which is as yet unknown but vividly constructed in the imagination. And yet, as I have said, when this unknown is encountered in reality, the desire tends to turn back and take as its object the place of departure, vividly re-constructed by the operations of memory and nostalgia.\n\nIt is precisely this interplay of desires that makes the condition of exile as experienced by recent migrants to Italy singular and interesting, particularly when reflected and explored in writing. Its effects in the text are both thematic and structural: the condition of exile informs and underlines both what is being expressed in the texts and the ways in which it is expressed. All of the texts I shall discuss, and many others by italophone migrant writers (see bibliography), are imbued with a sense of another place, and of another story attached to that place. The texts in part work to mediate between past and present, home and exile, in an attempt to determine, or at least to delineate in inchoate form, a future predicated upon the experience of both places. In so doing, they voice a displacement or disjuncture which lends them something which I am reluctant to describe as an essential quality, but which certainly goes some way to establishing a common concern and a common form, and so approaches the formation of a genre. As my hesitancy demonstrates, the territory of genre definition and canon formation, especially in the case of marginal or minority writing, is a minefield which I have no wish to enter. However, I think that it is important at this stage of the development of migrant writing in Italian to start to identify common movements and patterns in order to explore in a more informed and nuanced way the texts that are emerging, rather than treating a vast range of texts as a single literary phenomenon according to their lowest common denominator of being texts in Italian by migrants whose first language is a different one. To avoid the mines, however, I will now look in specific detail at the representations and effects of exile in the three novels I have selected.\n\nThe interplay of past and present \"homes\" in these novels is governed in large part by the structure of each narrative. In this area, Immigrato, by Fortunato and Methnani, is clearly different from the two other novels. Any discussion of this novel is complicated by the fact of its co-authorship; the present discussion is particularly complicated by the fact that this co-authorship involves one author who is \"exiled\" in Italy and one author who is \"at home\" there. Whilst the publication details of the novel credit both authors equally, the authors themselves give contradictory accounts of the writing of the text; each more or less claims that he wrote it. (4) To comment on which account is correct is not my concern here (in any case, it would be an exercise of dubious value to establish where such correctness would lie). In order to discuss the figurations of exile in the text, it is mostly sufficient to consider the text to contain Methnani's story, parenthesizing the issue of ownership of the textual version of it. He lived the experiences described (apart from one or two episodes which both authors acknowledge to be fabricated), the io narrante is presented as Methnani, he is the immigrato. I say mostly sufficient, because there are implications for the exile theme in the novel which derive from its collaborative nature, and these are connected with Fortunato's own understanding and representation of exile around the text, if not specifically within it. Fortunato describes a strong identification with Methnani, based largely on two factors: his own experiences of travelling in North Africa, and his own experiences of growing up in the south of Italy. In other words, familiar to Fortunato and recognized by him, both in Methnani's story and in the collaborative text of the story, are the ways in which an \"other\" place is invested with desire. The concept of exile in this novel cannot, therefore, be treated simply as deriving from the consciousness of the displaced author; it is partially overlaid with the migratory consciousness of the placed one.\n\nBoth authors concur that one major contribution by Fortunato to the novel was its structure. The titles of the chapters of the novel constitute a simple list of names of eight Italian cities, which traces a loop between the opening and closing chapters situated in Tunisian cities, whose names in the titles are preceded by the preposition a, denoting a sense of placement, to contrast with the relentless displacement of the narrator's life in Italy. This structure works to embed the migrant's exile in Italy firmly within the chronological and yet circular context of before and after, at home. Home thus frames the place and experience of exile in the novel, creating the sense of a stable reference point, a sense consolidated by the association of home with the father, who encourages the narrator to emigrate and listens to the report of this experience on his return. However, the relationship between the places of home and exile is more unstable than this description suggests, and this instability is marked by the text of the novel. The return to the city of Kairouan rather than Tunis, where the story began, points out a dislocation in the loop of the narrative; the fixed reference point has shifted. The name Kairouan, the reader is told, derives from the Arabic word for encampment, and the narrator arrives back there on market day, when the provisionality of the settlement is accentuated by the mobility of the people and structures which temporarily inhabit it. The narrator has not returned to stay, but rather will depart again on a further journey. In this way, the conclusion of the novel is disrupted in order to underline a point, to be discussed below, which is made also in the other novels I have selected, in other works of italophone migrant writing, and in many conventional texts about exile: the impossibility of return.\n\nFortunato's placing of the story in Italy within the frame of the story in Tunisia stands in contrast to the ways in which narratives of home and abroad are structured in the novels of Melliti and Kubati. The latter have in common the maintenance of an interplay between home and the place of exile, producing the effect of an explicit narrative, taking place in the present day and the present country, and behind it an implicit narrative, ongoing in the past and the home country, which both commentates and generates the main story. The effects in both novels are similar, but the means of creating and sustaining the double narrative differ. In Melliti's text, the Ur-narrative expresses itself largely by means of alternative narrative voices, one of the most powerful of which is silence. The silences which occur amongst the multi-ethnic group of migrants in Rome who inhabit the Pantanella building, a disused warehouse, are often the opportunity for reflection on the past and on the experience of emigration. The telling of individual stories of the past gives way to silences during which each listener assimilates the testimonianza just given, comparing it to his own experience (the inhabitants all seem to be male), and so, under the impetus of\n\nthe story and with the mediation of silence, making the transfer between present and past, exile and home. It is interesting that the process shifts from the tellable to the untellable: stories of the past can be recounted, but for the individual to revisit his past, there must be a passage through and beyond verbalization. This at once signals the painfully private and incommunicable quality of the loss which exile represents, and also suggests that expression, narrativization is somehow compromised by the condition of exile. Certain things cannot be said in a language which the teller does not possess, in an environment in which he is not at home.Connected with this block in expression is a cognitive block. Silences occur in the narrative predominantly at night-time, and in this way, silence seems to accommodate an alternative form of cognitive activity, connected to dreaming. It is as if, whilst passing beyond narrative into non-verbalizable reconstruction of past experience, the exile must also pass beyond rational thinking into non-logocentric reproduction of past experience. Home is represented as literally unthinkable and untellable in the place of exile, whilst at the same time it is clearly the metaphorical centre and source of all cognitive activity and of all self-representation. In this way, the two narratives of the novel are constituted: the literal, readable narrative of the present and the metaphorical narrative of the past which must be traced between the lines of the text.\n\nSilence is not the only alternative narrative voice in this novel. Narrated predominantly in the third person, and predominantly through the consciousness of a single, central individual--a young, highly educated migrant named Ahmad--the narrative voice periodically shifts. Often, the central voice is simply that of another migrant, who tells his own story in the ways discussed above, but it also shifts to less identifiable positions, such as the collective, choral voice of the migrant community, or the voice of an overseer or god, addressing the entire community as voi. These latter, ineffable voices have a quality of timelessness and spacelessness which links them to the silence so prominent in the narrative, and so to the past, and to the home culture and community. Again, they contribute to constructing the past and home as a metaphorical space, and even a mystical one. Exile is the speakable, thinkable, real experience of the present, but true identity seems to lie in the unspeakable, unthinkable figurative experience of the past.\n\nBy means of structural strategies similar to those used by Melliti in Pantanella, Elton, io narrante of Kubati's Va e non torna, is repeatedly transported back, metaphorically, from Italy to Albania. These excursions into the past and into the home country occur when an event in the present triggers a memory of the past, and so the past is re-visited. Occasionally, this occurs in dreams, and so has affinities with the night-time psychological excursions which take place in the Pantanella building, although a major distinction in Kubati's novel is that this is always an individual experience, rather than a collective one. An example of the transfer from present to past, Italy to Albania, is a phone call Elton receives from a former girlfriend at home, Iris. She is phoning to tell him that a mutual friend has been injured in a car accident, but the emotions inspired in Elton by her call focus not on the friend, but on Iris, and on her context, i.e., the past, in Albania. In a short paragraph transcribing Elton's thoughts following the phone call, \"i bei tempi andati\" are evoked three times (114-15). This powerful surge of nostalgia leads into a narrative of the past, and of his relationship with Iris, which constitutes an entire chapter of the novel (116-26). This structural diversion in the narrative thus demonstrates the power and the proximity of the past. It takes little to hijack the journey in the new country and force a diversion back to the old one, and here lies an irony which undermines the title of the novel: prominent is a sort of metaphorical return, underlining the impossibility of not always returning, psychologically and emotionally at least, to the point of departure.\n\nThis concept is underscored structurally by the final chapter of the novel, in which the narrative returns literally to the point and the moment of departure--the port of Durazzo. In this way, the destination of the narrative comes to be the point of departure of the individual, and the story of exile ends at the moment of exile. Less than a return to the beginning, however, this represents in narrative terms the juncture of two endings (which are also beginnings), in the sense that, in narrative time, it marks the end of the story of Elton's life in Albania (opening towards the beginning of a new one in Italy), and, in \"real\" time, the end of the story of his life so far in Italy (opening towards the future in Italy). In this way, this closure points out that the narrative excursions into the past have not been as unprogrammatic as they appear to be, even if they are prompted by seemingly random occurrences in the present. They have, in fact, recounted piecemeal a narrative of Elton's life before his life in Italy, and so have constructed a background narrative, or, as in Melliti's novel, an Ur-narrative, which runs in parallel to the foreground narrative in the text, and acts as its index. The implication is that the experiences of the exile cannot be understood, cannot be narrated fully, without reference to the past and the home country.\n\nThe suggestion that any narrative of the self must ultimately derive from home, must recognize and play out its own state of exile, is structurally reinforced by the central section of this novel (pages 83-100 in a text of 193 pages), where there is an italicized section recounting the conversations of prisoners in jail in Albania, who are about to be released due to an amnesty. Its central position, and the fact that it is printed in italics, make this section both the fulcrum of the novel and an excursion into a different reality--or unreality, beyond reality. Not only does this section encapsulate the Ur-text which home and the experience of political exile constitute; it also establishes a nucleus of significance in which story-telling, exile, and political commitment are conjoined. This is confirmed at the end of the section, when the reader is told that the italicized section is part of a novel Elton is writing. There seems thus to be a confirmation that the act and practice of writing are embedded within past experience and within the home culture, and that exile is a formative experience not only in that it forms personal and political attitudes, but also in that it forms, and informs, writing.\n\nStructural similarities and differences in these novels are reflected in the ways in which the notion of exile is deployed and explored in them. In all, exile is figured as a condition of loss and of nostalgia, and, as already indicated, return is seen as impossible, in the literal sense at least. The issue of the extent to which migration in these instances is voluntary is again raised by the extent to which the home country is figured as central, fundamental, and yet necessarily a point of departure rather than of destination: these themes are treated very differently in each of the novels under discussion. Immigrato is distinctive in stressing, as well as the impossibility of return, the impossibility of belonging--anywhere. The particular pertinence of the return to the displaced father (having moved from Tunis to Kairouan) is that he is a shifting reference point throughout the narrator's life, as it is recounted to us. Home is never figured as something stable or constant in this novel; rather, individual human experience is represented as essentially dislocated, essentially exilic. We are told in the first chapter that the narrator and his sister were sent to be educated at a boarding school distant from their home when their parents divorced, and he comments: \"Ci sentivamo in una specie di esilio, in un limbo\" (9).Later in adolescence, the narrator describes clearly the mechanisms by which he personally, and his generation collectively, mythologized the \"west,\" but most immediately Italy, on the basis of fantasies of material and sexual plenty fuelled by media images of European society and encounters with European tourists. For the narrator, this is an intensely personal and private process, concerned predominantly with exploring the Italian language, but for the wider public, the focus is consumer goods and material wealth. Whilst recognizing the same processes of myth construction in himself and in others, the narrator differentiates himself starkly, claiming he had no interest in acquiring the money and clothes and attitude to become a \"fighetto occidentale\" (12), and thus underlining again his sense of estrangement from his environment, even at \"home.\" In fact, he is not \"at home\" at home, and in this novel perhaps more than in the others discussed here, departure from home is seen more as a personal evolution than as a breach.\n\nThis almost universalizing of the concept of exile in this novel might appear to stretch the significance of it to the point of meaninglessness, and yet there is a specificity to the sense of estrangement in the novel brought about by physical, geographical displacement. As my comments so far demonstrate, this is a text which might readily be described as a discussion about identity. The process of self-questioning, which is begun in childhood and adolescence in Tunisia, is accelerated and accentuated once the narrator has migrated to Italy, and this is largely owed to the confrontation between a number of images and identities both formed from the inside and attributed from the outside. Whilst one powerful sense of displacement derives from a contrast between himself and the Italian environment (\"Per strada, mi guardo intorno come un pesce fuor d'acqua\" 18), when he has recourse to fellow North African migrants, even fellow Tunisians, to provide some source of identification, he is still left feeling estranged. During his early days in the south of Italy, he encounters several times a migrant named Jabari, whom he first sees stealing in a shop, and who later recommends to him homosexual prostitution as the only secure way to make a living in Italy as a migrant. These encounters trouble the narrator deeply, offering as they do images of the North African migrant with which he desperately does not want to identify, images which lurk mockingly and threateningly behind the self-images he has been nurturing of a cultured graduate building a new life abroad. He comments: \"Non riesco a fare a meno di ripensare al nordafricano che rubava. Non so perche, ma il fatto mi da fastidio, come se anch'io rubassi con lui. Chissa se era tunisino. Dall'accento, direi di no. In ogni caso, preferirei non lo fosse\" (17-18). The repetitions here of the negative (\"no,\" \"non\") and the short periods vivify the persistent return of this particular repressed and the insistent efforts to deny the possibility of recognition which Jabari offers. On a subsequent encounter, he faces his anxiety more directly: \"Forse, semplicemente, ho timore di scorgere nelle sue parole, nei gesti, qualcosa di me, della mia storia\" (22). Ultimately, however, he forces himself to use the source of identification that Jabari represents, instead, as a tool for differentiation, and thus for affirmation of his own, superior identity: \"Ma io, ne sono sicuro, sono diverso da lui. Non finiro in carcere, e non vendero mai il mio corpo. Se Jabari sta tornando indietro, io riusciro ad andare avanti: ho una laurea, sono giovane, e non sono un delinquente\" (27).\n\nReturning to Said's distinction between the individual, intellectual exile of the past and the mass, political-economic exiles of the present, we can see in the figure of the immigrato-narrante in this novel a clash between the two, as he struggles to mould himself an identity as an intellectual displaced in an ultimately positive way, and so to differentiate himself from the nameless masses of immigrants. Exile does not in this case lead to an exaggerated and idealized identification with home and with all traces of it, as perhaps convention would have it, but rather aggravates an itching need to peel off the uncomfortable and unsightly associations of home, its community, its culture: a need underscored by the sense of impatience to move on which dominates in the closing chapter of the novel, when home is revisited. This rejection of home is expressed in the middle of the novel: \"Io stesso, il colore della mia pelle, la mia lingua, il modo in cui ho preso a vestirmi: tutto fa parte di un paesaggio che comincio a odiare, e che e il mio paesaggio\" (44). The last phrase of this quotation points out the equivocal nature of the rejection of the identity formed in the home country: it is at once a recognition and a rejection. The search for a new identity in the adopted country fails in Immigrato, since the tension between pride in the home culture and the impulse to reject it, between desire for a new identity fashioned in a European country and the impulse to reject the culture of that country or continent, is never resolved. But, as the quotation indicates, with its references to skin colour, speech, and clothing, the rejection of the home identity is a rejection of it as perceived by an outsider rather than experienced as an insider. It is the result of the io narrante seeing himself from the outside, in the role of the immigrato of the title, and starting to assimilate that role, in a distorted type of integration. The search for a redefined identity which the novel represents as being the significance of emigration for the individual results ultimately in a sense of self-estrangement.\n\nSelf-estrangement also figures as an inevitable factor of migration in Melliti's Pantanella, though here it is not part of a discussion about identity formation, but rather part of a larger examination of the process of mythologization of other places. Like Fortunato and Methnani, Melliti examines the constructions of \"here\" and \"there\" and the operations of desire within these constructions, but he explores further into the psychological and cognitive processes of myth construction, problematizing particularly any fixed relationship between home and place of exile. He does this by means of a recurrent image in the text, \"l'altra sponda,\" exploiting fully the mobility and fluidity of the notion of \"other\" and of the shore as a place of both arrival and departure, and a place which is constantly changing its form and shifting. When used with reference to Ahmad himself, the \"other shore\" appears to be a cognitive rather than a geographical locus:\n\nSi fece notte. C'era la luna, e il vento. Allora Ahmad fuggi lontano con i suoi ricordi lacerati dalla nostalgia, dal rimpianto e dal timore di un futuro ignoto. [...] Il silenzio si impadroniva di lui, e a volte nascondeva una lotta nel suo animo. [...] Gli sembrava di girare in un circolo vizioso. E le domande inquietanti che si poneva lo stancavano. Ogni giorno aveva l'impressione che la logica non fosse in accordo con il suo obiettivo. Non conosceva quale fosse il vero mezzo per passare dall'altra sponda. A volte fuggiva le domande che lo straziavano con alcune risate tristi. Oppure scriveva poesie.\n\n(19)\n\n\"L'altra sponda\" here is a place of understanding, a place where things make sense. In this way, exile starts to be figured in the text as a cognitive dislocation as well as a physical and emotional one: it seems that Ahmad's capacities of comprehension are incapacitated in the place of exile, and can only be restored to normal functioning by means of a return to the home of thinking. It is interesting, too, that here, a link is made between home, cognitive activity, and creative writing. The recourse to poetry composition as a way of avoiding the torment of unanswerable questions suggests that the act of writing in or about exile is both an escape (back to the \"other shore\") and a constructive attempt to bridge the gap between home and exile.\n\nThe equation of the \"other shore\" with understanding, and of exile with cognitive disruption, is made explicit in a later passage in the novel in which, again, it is Ahmad who evokes the image whilst thinking, at night, alone:\n\nLe domande gli rimbombavano in testa. \"Perche sono venuto? Cosa faro?\" Ecco l'esilio! Innanzitutto e l'esilio dell'anima e se la mente e presa da qualcosa, l'agitazione fa il suo lavoro e ti spezza dentro. \"Vivo una crisi o un problema?\" Cosi si chiedeva. Si sforzava di trovare una risposta affinche la realta lo liberasse da questo oceano in cui si dimenava, che non conosceva ancora, e chissa se avrebbe mai potuto raggiungere l'altra sponda sano e salvo.\n\n(68)\n\nMelliti thus explores the notion of self-estrangement, which Fortunato and Methnani also evoke, though here it is clearly a cerebral disruption, the effect of which is close to madness.\n\nWhere the image of \"l'altra sponda\" is used with relation to other characters in Pantanella, it is associated with the silence typical of this text, and with the individual testimonies of migrants. For example, Mustafa talks of his family at home, and then: \"Il silenzio regno per alcuni istanti e forse ognuno di loro disegno nella propria mente l'immagine di un vasto deserto. Si calmarono o forse fantasticavano lontano, dal centro di Roma all'altra sponda del Mediterraneo\" (16). Despite the ineffability suggested by the notions of silence and of the metaphorical desert, the \"other shore\" is here clearly marked as the southern shore of the Mediterranean, and therefore as home. However, when the image recurs at a moment when another migrant, Khaled, is thinking about his past, it has more a complex inflection:\n\nSotto l'effetto di questi pensieri e di queste sensazioni, le immagini cominciarono a confondersi, ad andare a zig zag e poi di nuovo dritte, danzando sulle acque del Mediterraneo. Il rumore assordante delle onde altissime e il flusso della marea lo [Khaled] riportavano sull'altra sponda.\n\n(20-21)\n\nThe processes of memory and nostalgia thus transport Khaled south. But at the end of the same page in the text, Khaled outlines his impressions and expectations of Italy, before he arrived there, and describes this country on the northern side of the Mediterranean as \"il paradiso terrestre, [...] l'altra sponda del Mediterraneo\" (21). This shift effectively exploits the metaphorical potential of the circular sea to be spun through 180 degrees in order to demonstrate the interchangeability of north and south. More specifically, it illustrates the power of desire to construct other places as paradises, utopias, \"no-places,\" but also commonplaces: the target and object of individual and collective aspirations rather than real geographical and cultural locations with genuinely different properties and characteristics. Khaled's reversal of the image points out the reversibility of the experience of exile: what was the \"other shore,\" the paradise, before departure becomes, on arrival, the place of banishment, estrangement, imprisonment, and desire channels its energies back towards the place of departure, transforming it into the fabulous place of alterity.\n\nVa e non torna, unlike Immigrato and Pantanella, is not a narrative of the early experiences of migration--scraping together a living, finding temporary accommodation, the risks of exploitation, etc. The protagonist of Kubati's novel, Elton, is a student who appears to be well-established in the university community of the city where he lives; his studies are going well, he has a number of friends, mostly Italian, he has an apartment to live in, he has parttime jobs. (7) In short, any day-to-day difficulties in his life are those associated with being a student, rather than a migrant. However, his existence in Italy is deeply imbued with the experience of exile, and, in turn, the novel is hinged upon the notion of departure. The first of these statements is relatively easily illustrated: one of Elton's part-time jobs is as translator and interpreter for the police and judiciary, so he is in daily, intimate contact with the traffic in migrants between Albania and southern Italy, and with the lives of migrants once arrived. His work with the police predominantly involves him listening to and translating intercepted phone calls, and the transcriptions of these conversations in the text bring home very powerfully, at once to Elton himself and to the reader, the risks associated with migration of physical damage, of exploitation, of disillusionment. He hears, for example, men discussing the importation of women to work in the sex trade, although the women believe they are simply emigrating; he hears the broken conversations between migrants on small boats approaching the Italian coast, as one boat is lost from sight and appears to have capsized.\n\nElton's relatively comfortable and successful existence as an individual in his destination country is thus punctuated and punctured regularly by reminders of the multi-faceted problem of emigration from his home country. Similarly, in his second part-time job, Elton is a waiter in a pizzeria, a role which brings him directly into contact with the range of responses to immigrants played out in the host country. He is alternately treated as the lowest-level drudge and as a showcase employee, according to the way in which the restaurant manager chooses to pander to the attitudes of his customers. Prejudice is an issue which he faces every day, generally with good humour. In this way, Elton's life in Italy is again persistently related to the fact of his migration, and his two types of work construct a detailed but subtle tableau of the problems of migration, viewed both from the departure and destination sides.\n\nThe ways in which the novel is hinged upon the notion of departure are more complex. The title, of course, signals a departure with no prospect of return. This title is explained towards the end of the novel, where there is a brief excursion into Balkan folklore and its narrative conventions. The hero, we are told, inevitably arrives at a point in his journey at which he has three paths open to him: \"va e torna facilmente, va e torna con difficolta, va e non torna\" (186). The first two are never explored; nothing happens along those paths, and so from the point of view of narrativity, they are insignificant. The hero inevitably takes the third path, because along this path lie experiences and challenges: this is the path of life. Elton, as io narrante, in explaining this tradition to the reader, underscores not only the impossibility of return for him personally, but for all the migrants he remotely encounters in the course of his work and of his life in Italy. Rather than a sense of exile, the novel in this way is perhaps pervaded by the notion of exodus: an entire population, or rather, culture, since the references to folklore reach way beyond the national boundaries of Albania, appears to be abandoning its homeland with the desperate desire to find life elsewhere.\n\nOn the more personal level of this novel, though, it is exile which defines its tone and structure. Elton's existence and experience in Italy are consistently mapped onto his literally formative experiences in his home country, and exile is a condition which informs even life at home (there are affinities here with the representation in Immigrato of Methnani's sense of dislocation in Tunisia). Elton's father is exiled, in a more conventional sense, during the boy's childhood: he is arrested for political reasons, and incarcerated in a remote region of the country. Kubati explores the romantic quality of this particular exile, especially in the eyes of the boy, who to a certain extent enjoys the heroic glow which emanates from his father and illuminates favourably the son who must cope in his father's absence. Also, it is the occasion of the boy's first exile, since he is sent to stay with grandparents in Durazzo in order to avoid troubles at home following his father's arrest. In this way, his father's exile seems to predicate a life of exile for the son. Central to the narrative, though, is that this primary exile signifies that any sort of political commitment or activity is necessarily accompanied by estrangement; if an individual wishes to take a political stance, she or he must recognize that departure from home is intrinsic to that position. As the novel narrates, piecemeal, events in Tirana in 1990 and 1991, it develops a seemingly inevitable impetus towards departure.\n\nIn this way this novel proposes yet another shade in the spectrum of positions between voluntary and involuntary exile: the decision to leave home is not represented as one motivated by individual desire or will, but rather it seems to evolve in a historical process which brings a generation or nation collectively to the point of departure. Elton is convinced, by the experience of his father and by his own observations of politics in Albania, that there is no future for him in that country, and yet the steps which lead to his departure are part of a collective movement: protests, hunger strike, large-scale departures (as discussed above, exodus rather than exile). This is underscored as Elton's departure is narrated:\n\nRivoluzionari o immigrati, emigranti o ribelli perche giovani, oltre un regime, oltre il muro, oltre il mare, oltre il giorno, che rinchiudono, fissano, realizzano una realta che vogliamo cambiare o abbandonare, irresistibilmente attratti dal futuro dall'altra parte del muro, dall'altra parte del mare, di notte alla ricerca di un altrimenti che puo essere altrove, o di un altrove che e anche altrimenti, che comunque non si svelano che di colpo, senza preavviso, ad alba arrivata.\n\n(189)\n\nThe sense of moving beyond, to an other space, is figured, as in Melliti's Pantanella, not simply as a geographical move, but as a transfer to an existence which is entirely other, and entirely better. This vignette of mythologization is consolidated in the final chapter of the novel, when Elton and companions board a boat. It is interesting that the passive voice is persistently used: for example, the fishing boat moves without them rowing it, and the ship lets itself be boarded (191-92). There is almost a sense that a greater will (and a just will) is carrying them away from Albania, and this mythical quality is signalled by the name of the ship which they board, the Legend.\n\nKubati's novel thus brings my discussion back to its starting point: the question of willed or enforced absence from home. As the legendary quality of the narration of Elton's departure from Durazzo suggests, reinforced by the situation of this episode as the culmination of the entire narrative, there is a triumphant quality to his exile. In Immigrato and in Pantanella, departure itself is understated, and yet the exploration of sacred utopias, whether connected with Italy as seen from the south, or with home as seen from the north, lends the condition of exile a mythical status. It is possible to conclude, then, that in apparent contradiction of the distinctions between contemporary migrant writing and traditional literature of exile that I set out at the beginning of this essay, the two types of exile-related writing have in common the construction of departure and of absence as an epic journey. The act of creating a narrative of a difficult and, to various extents, unwilled life experience appears both to appropriate to the individual control over what is otherwise a situation out of his or her control, and to impart to a personal struggle the status of an essential collective experience. Said's distinction between individual intellectual exiles and \"the refugee-peasants with no prospect of ever returning home, armed only with a ration card and an agency number\" (176) does not take into account those modern-day migrants armed also with education and intellectual ambition, who aspire to use artistic representation of their particular kind of exile not only as a palliative or as a mode of rationalizing a disillusionment, but also as a means of making their experience signify, for themselves and for their readers.\n\nThe three novels discussed here, and others published recently in Italy by migrant writers, have in common that they take what appears to be a salient human characteristic, and perhaps weakness--the capacity to project one's desires so powerfully onto blank spaces that one creates cities, countries, continents of the mind which, when experienced, may turn out to be the places of madness rather than of tranquil understanding--and use it as the source of a narrative. The desire to migrate itself, the concomitant desire to return home, and the desire to tell stories are linked by the common impulse to create a coherent and fully-formed other, or alternative, place. In this way, italophone migrant writing can perhaps be seen as a re-visiting and re-exploration, contextualized within acutely contemporary Italian social and cultural changes, of the traditional literary topos of exile.\n\nUniversity of Warwick, U.K.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nConcise Oxford Dictionary. 7th ed.

Their positions both in Italy and with respect to the home country are different in many ways from the writers examined here, and cannot easily be accommodated within the scope of this analysis (see Parati).\n\n(4) In separate conversations with Fortunato and Methnani in March and November 2001 respectively, I was told by the former that he discussed Methnani's experiences in Italy with him regularly and at length, and then he (Fortunato) went away to the south of Italy and wrote the novel; by Methnani that he wrote diaries of his experiences as he moved around Italy, and then handed over the diaries to Fortunato, who structured them to make the novel, and corrected the Italian prose. The publishers' account is that the text was written by Methnani and \"rivisto dopo\" by Fortunato.\n\n(5) The inexpressibility of the loss of the homeland is underlined in the novel by the use of the Arabic word ghurba to describe the emotions of the migrants when they think of home. That the word cannot be translated in the text indicates that it is essentially of the home culture, and that the emotions it describes are incommunicable to someone not of that culture, and not experiencing exile. The word is explained in a footnote to p. 12 of the novel.\n\n(6) My references are to the first edition of the novel (1990).\n\n(7) The different social status and level of integration in Italian society which Elton experiences, together with the distancing of author from narrator (who is, nevertheless, a figure of the author), indicate that this novel, published a decade after Immigrato, represents a different stage in the development of italophone migrant writing, moving away from autobiographical testimonies of the hardships of migration towards narratives of individual experience connected with migration."
