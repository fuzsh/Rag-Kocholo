He embarks on a radical experiment in his own life and the lives of those connected to him: his practical economist husband; their twins; and even the authors he edits and publishes. One of those authors, a mysterious M. N. Opie, writes a story about a young academic involved in a car accident that causes her life to veer in an unexpected direction. Another author, an economist, describes how the gift of a cow to an impoverished family on the West Bengal–Bangladesh border sets them on a startling path to tragedy.\n\nTogether, these connected narratives raise the question: How free are we really to make our own choices? In a scathing, compassionate quarrel with the world, Neel Mukherjee confronts our fundamental assumptions about economics, race, appropriation, and the tangled ethics of contemporary life.\n\nNeel Mukherjee is the author of four critically acclaimed novels, including A Life Apart (2010), The Lives of Others (2014), shortlisted for the Booker Prize; and A State of Freedom (2017), a New York Times Notable Book. He divides his time between London, England, and Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he serves as Associate Senior Lecturer in Creative Writing at Harvard University.\n\nLimited copies of Choice will be sold at the event.\n\nRussia is the world’s fourth top migration destination. While most migrate to Russia from other post-Soviet countries, a small but highly visible group of the Russian-speaking diaspora has migrated from Europe and North and South America. Lauded in Russian media as “ideological migrants,” the Kremlin claims that they flee liberalism and oppression by the transnational elite. This presentation by Professor Lauren Woodard asks, what really motivates their migration? How do these so-called “ideological migrants” explain their decision to migrate to Russia, and what are their experiences once they are there? Drawing on ethnographic encounters with some of these migrants in Russia and the United States since 2016, Professor Woodard argues that it is possible to understand these migrants as engaging in a form of moral migration, an ethical attempt to align one’s values with where one lives. In this case, migration is motivated not by aspiration for a morally “good life” but driven by political disillusionment. Attention to moral migration has implications beyond Russia, including for understanding political polarization and migration activism, among other topics.\n\nDr. Lauren Woodard is an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. Her research focuses on migration, processes of racialization, borders, settler colonialism, political anthropology, multiculturalism, liberalism, climate change, Russia and the former Soviet Union. Her current book project based on ethnographic fieldwork in Moscow and Vladivostok, “Ambiguous Inclusion: Transforming Migrants into Compatriots on Russia’s Border with China”, examines how officials and migrants negotiate Russia’s migration and diaspora policies on Russia’s border with China.\n\nHer research has been supported by the Kennan Institute Title VIII Research Fellowship, the Wenner-Gren Dissertation Fellowship, and Fulbright research grants to Russia and Kazakhstan, and published in Cultural Anthropology and The Political and Legal Anthropology Review. She has also conducted research on international development and water politics in Central Asia.\n\nDuring the Bracero Program (1942–1964), the U.S. and Mexican governments collaborated to facilitate the temporary labor migration of millions of Mexican farmworkers to the U.S. Originally created to fill U.S. wartime agricultural needs, the Program continued after the culmination of World War II through bilateral agreements that institutionalized and scaled up the infrastructure of bracero migration. This large-scale movement of migrants left lasting legacies on agriculture and migration in the U.S., as well as on rural economic livelihoods, cultures of migration, and patterns of development in Mexico.\n\nAlthough the Program boasts a rich archive and historiography, one aspect that has remained relatively unexplored is the bracero contracting process in the Mexican interior. Seeking to address that gap, Eliza Kravitz interrogates the diverse meanings ascribed to the Bracero Program in 1950s Monterrey, Nuevo León, an industrialized city in northern Mexico that hosted a prominent bracero contracting center. As a key site of encounter between rural and urban dwellers, northern and southern Mexicans, and everyday citizens and the U.S. and Mexican governments, the Monterrey contracting center generated varied ideas about braceros’ identities and motives, the selection process, and the Bracero Program as a whole. Using a rich archive from varied local perspectives, Kravitz’s research reveals not only the humanitarian and local community struggles that emerged from the Monterrey contracting center, but also the ways in which local actors linked the Bracero Program to broader issues of rural disinvestment, the legacies of the Mexican Revolution, and mid-century Mexican politics at all levels, from the individual to the nation. Kravitz highlights points of contradiction and commonality among local actors, with import for historical understandings of the Program’s many contested meanings and the ideologies underlying its termination.\n\nEliza Kravitz is a senior at Yale University majoring in History and completing certificates in Spanish and Human Rights. She is interested in pursuing legal and historical work related to Latin American migration, and she has spent the past two summers working in legal and humanitarian aid near the Texas-Mexico border. On campus, she sings with the Yale Glee Club, interprets for Spanish-speaking immigration cases at New Haven Legal Assistance Association, and prepares taxes for low-income New Haven residents with Volunteer Income Tax Assistance.\n\nMichael Willrich, Leff Families Professor of History at Brandeis University, will present on his new book “American Anarchy: The Epic Struggle between Immigrant Radicals and the US Government at the Dawn of the Twentieth Century.”\n\nIn the early twentieth century, anarchists like Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman championed a radical vision of a world without states, laws, or private property. Militant and sometimes violent, anarchists were heroes to many working-class immigrants. But to many others, anarchism was a terrifyingly foreign ideology. Determined to crush it, government officials launched a decades-long “war on anarchy,” a brutal program of spying, censorship, and deportation that set the foundations of the modern surveillance state. The lawyers who came to the anarchists’ defense advanced groundbreaking arguments for free speech and due process, inspiring the emergence of the civil liberties movement. Drawing on sources including collections found at Yale’s Beinecke Library, “American Anarchy” tells the gripping tale of the anarchists, their allies, and their enemies, showing how their battles over freedom and power still shape our public life.\n\nAt Brandeis, Willrich teaches undergraduate courses and graduate seminars on American political and legal history (from the colonial period to the present), crime and punishment in U.S. history, the Gilded Age and Progressive Era, and the literature of American history. He is the author of two other books and a former journalist whose work has appeared in the New York Times, The New Republic, The Washington Monthly, Washington City Paper, and Mother Jones.\n\nIn 2008, China’s government cracked down on protests in Tibet. Amy Yee, then a journalist for the Financial Times, found herself covering a press conference with the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, his exile home in India. She never imagined a hug from the spiritual leader would be the start of a global, fourteen-year journey to spotlight the stories of Tibetans in exile.\n\nThis talk by Amy Yee will discuss her recent book ‘Far from the Rooftop of the World: Travels among Tibetan Refugees on Four Continents’, a nonfiction narrative and travelogue set in India - as well as Australia, Belgium and New York, where Tibetans emigrated overseas. It gives new insight into relationships between Tibetan and Chinese people, especially since Yee is herself Chinese American.\n\nWhile there are many books written about the Dalai Lama and Tibet, few focus on how ordinary Tibetans abroad are living and sustaining their identity and culture in exile. It focuses on ordinary but extraordinary Tibetans navigating between worlds. It also includes encounters with educators, community leaders, monks and nuns, and advocates, including Chinese pro-democracy activists, over the course of a decade.\n\nAmy Yee is an award-winning journalist, most recently with Bloomberg/CityLab and previously a Financial Times correspondent in India where she lived for seven years. She has written for the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, The Economist, NPR and 30+ media outlets.\n\nShe has won three awards from the United Nations Correspondents Association; four from the South Asian Journalists Association; and first place from the Association of Healthcare Journalists for analysis about reducing deaths of children in India and Bangladesh. In 2023, she won the Asian American Journalists Association’s award for reporting about protecting rights of immigrant voters, and a Society of Professional Journalists award for racial equity reporting. She has had four Notable Essays in the Best American Essays.\n\nYee is a MacDowell fellow and a graduate of Harvard Kennedy School, Columbia Journalism School, Wellesley and Hunter’s MFA program.\n\nThis presentation unveils the profound impacts of Nepali emigration, focusing on the often-overlooked narratives of women left behind. It investigates the narratives of Nepal women affected by familial emigration, contextualizing their responses within the broader macroeconomic conditions propelling Nepali emigration (the Nepali civil war and the rapid urbanization and globalization of Nepal). Engaging in a dialogue between societal conditions and familial experiences, the interviews conducted by Sadikshya Ghimire reveal the intertwined narratives of hopelessness, disrupted familial structures, and evolving gender roles. Despite a pervasive sense of hopelessness about Nepal’s conditions, these women showcase resilience in their individual lives, navigating transnational challenges with acceptance, improvisation, and resourcefulness. Their stories challenge the dominant narrative of victimhood, highlighting strength and agency. The resilience demonstrated by Nepali women offers a potential avenue for positive transformation, suggesting adaptive strategies to address underlying macroeconomic issues and redirect Nepal’s trajectory away from reliance on emigration.\n\nSadikshya Ghimire works at New Haven-based, immigration non-profit Elena’s Light as a Legal Advocacy Coordinator. She is an immigrant from Nepal, and her experiences have shaped her passion to advocate for migrant and refugee rights. She graduates from Yale in 2024 with a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science and Ethnicity, Race, and Migration. After Yale, she aspires to study immigration and human rights law.\n\nJoin the Yale African American Affinity Group for a conversation with Marlene Daut, professor of French and African American studies at Yale University, about her book Awakening the Ashes: An Intellectual History of the Haitian Revolution. Register by Friday, January 19th for your chance to win a free copy of the book!\n\nThe Haitian Revolution was a powerful blow against colonialism and slavery. As its thinkers and fighters blazed the path to universal freedom, they forced anticolonial, antislavery, and antiracist ideals into modern political grammar. The first state in the Americas to permanently abolish slavery, outlaw color prejudice, and forbid colonialism, Haitians established their nation in a hostile Atlantic World. Slavery was ubiquitous throughout the rest of the Americas and foreign nations and empires repeatedly attacked Haitian sovereignty. Yet Haitian writers and politicians successfully defended their independence while planting the ideological roots of egalitarian statehood.\n\nIn Awakening the Ashes, Marlene L. Daut situates famous and lesser-known eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Haitian revolutionaries, pamphleteers, and political thinkers within the global history of ideas, showing how their systems of knowledge and interpretation took center stage in the Age of Revolutions. While modern understandings of freedom and equality are often linked to the French Declaration of the Rights of Man or the US Declaration of Independence, Daut argues that the more immediate reference should be to what she calls the 1804 Principle that no human being should ever again be colonized or enslaved, an idea promulgated by the Haitians who, against all odds, upended French empire.\n\nThis event will take place both in person at the Sterling Memorial Library Lecture Hall, 120 High Street, and via Zoom.\n\nMovie screening Tuesday, February 20th, 2024 (in-person; 5:00pm; 40mn) followed after short break by Q&A session (hybrid; 5:45pm; 45mn); and\n\nThursday, February 15th, 2024 - Thursday, February 22nd, 2024 (on-demand film screening).\n\nSpeakers:\n\nJames Taing (co-director and co-producer)\n\nBunseng Taing (protagonist)\n\nModerator:\n\nQuan Tran (Yale University, Ethnicity, Race and Migration Department)\n\nGhost Mountain is the story of Bunseng Taing, a Cambodian refugee who made his way to Connecticut in 1980 after surviving both the Killing Fields during the Cambodian genocide by the Khmer Rouge and a second horror never before documented. He was among 45,000 refugees who managed to escape to what they believed was safety in Thailand, only to be forced back over the Cambodian border in an area heavily infested with landmines.\n\nIn its debut in 2019, “Ghost Mountain: The Second Killing Fields of Cambodia” came in third place in the short documentary category by audience voting at the Sedona Film Festival. Since then, it has been featured at ten other film festivals and won the Best Feature Documentary award at the Houston Asian American Pacific Islander (HAAPI) Film Festival in 2020. The film has also been showcased on CSPAN and is currently available for distribution on PBS. In 2023, Bunseng Taing, the protagonist of “Ghost Mountain,” has released his memoir, “Under the Naga Tail”, which was featured as one of the books to read for AAPI month on Goodreads in 2023 and received a Bronze medal in the Inspiration Nonfiction category at the Readers’ Favorite Book Awards.James Taing is the son of Bunseng and has been interviewing and documenting the principal characters for the last ten years. While starting the Preah Vihear Foundation in 2016, he worked in Risk Investment and Finance. He co-authored his father’s memoir, Under the Naga Tail (2023).\n\nThis event is sponsored by Program on Refugees, Forced Displacement, and Humanitarian Responses (PRFDHR), the Council on Southeast Asian Studies (CSEAS), and the Center for the Study of Race, Indigeneity, and Transnational Migration (RITM) at Yale.\n\nMigration from Central America has increased substantially since 2015. More migrants are coming from rural areas and family migration has replaced the migration of single adults as the largest category of migrants from the region. This is occurring as droughts related to climate change are increasing in frequency and intensity, with large impacts on food security for smallholder farmers in the region’s Dry Corridor. Professor Sarah Bermeo uses subnational data on both migration and agricultural stress for Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador from 2012-2019 to examine the impact of droughts related to climate change on migration decisions. Both rural location and agricultural stress are associated with substantial and significant increases in arrivals of family units from subnational areas at the U.S. southern border. The findings have implications for how to think about the relationship between climate change and migration. They also imply that current low levels of foreign aid to rural areas may partially explain why increasing aid has not been associated with declines in out-migration.\n\nSarah Bermeo is a political economist, associate professor of public policy and political science at Duke University, and co-director of the Duke Program on Climate-Related Migration.

Evans at Beinecke Library.” David Blight, Sterling Professor of History at Yale, will introduce Dr. Walter O. Evans, who will speak about his life as a collector. A reception will follow.\n\n“Douglass, Baldwin, Harrington,” on view from January 26-July 7, 2024, explores extraordinary materials collected by Walter and Linda Evans and now in the Beinecke’s care. Celebrating three towering figures of Black history, art and culture—Frederick Douglass, James Baldwin, and Ollie Harrington—this exhibition showcases how the Evans collections, taken together, bring political and cultural history into close engagement with arts and letters. These collections and the figures they feature demonstrate powerful ways creative work may serve as a form of social justice advocacy in ways that continue to inspire. “Douglass, Baldwin, Harrington” honors Walter and Linda Evans and their work advocating for, documenting, and celebrating Black arts in America. Their ongoing leadership in public dialogue about the need for more inclusive American arts and cultural heritage collections, and for greater public access to the work of Black artists, serves as an inspiration to all of us.\n\n4pm Remarks by David Blight and Walter O.

What is less understood is the project’s dependence on the labor of Black migrant women. The Silver Women argues that Black West Indian women made the canal construction possible by providing the indispensable everyday labor of social reproduction. They built a provisioning economy that fed, housed, and cared for the racially segregated workforce, in effect subsidizing the construction effort and its racial calculus. But while also subject to this discrimination, West Indian women found ways to subvert the legal, moral, and economic parameters imperial authorities sought to impose on Black migrant laborers. This talk tracks Black women’s important labor of social reproduction, while also excavating their strategies of claims-making, kinship, community building, and market adaptation that helped them navigate the contradictions and violence of U.S. empire.\n\nBio: Joan Flores-Villalobos is an Assistant Professor of History at the University of Southern California and received her Ph.D. from New York University in African Diaspora History. Her work focuses on gender, empire, race, and capitalism in Latin America and the Caribbean and has received support from the Ford Foundation and the Institute for Citizens and Scholars.\n\nIn the aftermath of the refugee crisis caused by conflicts in the Middle East and an increase in migration to Europe, European nations have witnessed a surge in discrimination targeted at immigrant minorities. Drawing from original surveys, survey experiments, and novel field experiments, Professor Sambanis will discuss his recent book with co-authors Donghyun Danny Choi and Mathias Poertner. They show that although prejudice against immigrants is often driven by differences in traits such as appearance and religious practice, the suppression of such differences does not constitute the only path to integration. Instead, the authors demonstrate that similarities in ideas and value systems can serve as the foundation for a common identity, based on a shared concept of citizenship, overcoming the perceived social distance between natives and immigrants.\n\nNicholas Sambanis is Professor of Political Science at Yale University. He writes on conflict processes with a focus on civil wars and other forms of inter-group conflict. Published work in these research areas has appeared in several journals, including the American Political Science Review, International Organization, American Journal of Political Science, World Politics, Science, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. With Michael Doyle, he co-authored Making War and Building Peace (Princeton University Press, 2006), the first book to analyze the impact of United Nations peace operations in post-conflict transitions; with Paul Collier and other colleagues, he co-authored Breaking the Conflict Trap: Civil War and Development Policy, one of the first quantitative studies of the causes of civil war around the world. In a two-volume book project, Understanding Civil War: Evidence and Analysis, he developed a nested, mixed-methods research design for the analysis of causes of civil war onset in a systematic comparative analysis of over 20 cases of civil war. Sambanis has taught at Yale and Penn. Topics of current interest are the effects of external intervention on peace-building after ethnic war; the analysis of violent escalation of separatist movements; conflict between native and immigrant populations; and strategies to mitigate bias and discrimination against minority groups. He studies these questions with a focus on the connection between identity politics and conflict processes drawing on social psychology, behavioral economics, and the comparative politics and international relations literatures in political science. Ongoing projects include research on the long-term legacies of violence exposure; the sources of ethnic and national identification among minority groups; the effects of integrative institutions in overcoming ethnic conflict; and on strategies to reduce bias and discrimination toward immigrants and refugees.\n\nThe talk investigates how the origins of Black performance can be ambiguous and move across the Atlantic. Focusing primarily on capoeira—an Afro-Brazilian combat game—I show how West African youth take up expressive forms in ways that question how Africans are positioned in the structure of diaspora. Far from representing a satisfying diasporic “return,” West African capoeira shows the disjointed process of Black performance repatriation that can reproduce social hierarchies. I argue that diaspora is both an aspiration and a framework for West Africans that can unexpectedly give way to renewed regional solidarities. I will then shift to the efforts of Black artists and activists recovering the African history of flamenco. This revival of Black origins in Spain coincides with the state’s attempt to control the “crisis” of African migration. Ultimately, I use capoeira and flamenco as two spaces that demonstrate how artistic heritage can be simultaneously problematic and a site of racial repair.\n\nBio: Celina de Sá is an Assistant Professor of Anthropology and an affiliated faculty member in the African and African Diaspora Studies Department, the Tereza Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies, and the Performance as Public Practice Program at the University of Texas at Austin.

Dr. de Sá’s first book manuscript, Diaspora Without Displacement: The Coloniality and Promise of Capoeira in Senegal, is currently under contract with Duke University Press.\n\nThis talk by Professor Farha Ternikar explores the significance of foodways for Muslim Indian immigrant women in the United States. As an Indian Muslim researcher, mindful of her insider-outsider status, she uses participant observation with Muslim South Asian American women in Tampa to do this research together in the community. Immigration continues to be a debated issue across the US, but especially in states like Florida, where food can be used to understand how Muslim South Asian women navigate community and identity. Challenging hegemonic understandings of Muslim women as often defined by hijab or modesty norms, this analysis, based on ongoing ethnographic research, takes a closer look at the importance of culinary placemaking. Commensality reveals important gendered, religious and political identities. And in turbulent times, food becomes an important site for resilience.\n\nDr. Farha Ternikar is Professor of Sociology and Director of Gender, Women and Sexuality Studies at Le Moyne College. Her most recent book, Intersectionality and Muslim Women: Beyond Hijab and Halal (2021), explores how food, fashion, and media are important modes of analysis for studying Muslim-American women. She is currently a visiting scholar at Chatham University, where she is working on a new manuscript using a transnational feminist framework in conversation with intersectional feminism to examine immigrant foodways. Dr. Ternikar is also working on a co-edited volume with Stephanie Y. Evans which brings together over a dozen female scholars of color who work on food. She has authored several articles on gender, race and religious identity in the Journal of Ethnic Studies, International Journal of Contemporary Sociology, and Sociology Compass.\n\nAll are invited to this one day display of collections material and a video screening about an essential story of New Haven in 1831: the visionary – and thwarted – proposal for a Black college that would have been America’s first historically Black college (HBCU).\n\nCome to the Beinecke Library on Sunday, September 10, 2023, between 12noon and 4pm, and learn more about the proposal – and about the town meeting held on the same date 192 years ago, September 10, 1831, that blocked the college with resolutions drawn up by top leaders of New Haven, many of them connected with Yale.\n\nThis event is co-sponsored by Beinecke Library and the Greater New Haven African American Historical Society.\n\nYou will be able to see original newspapers, pamphlets, and maps, from 1831 and that era on display in the library’s courtyard level reading room, along with facsimiles and some contemporary secondary sources about the story.\n\nThere will be multiple screenings of the short documentary film, “What Could Have Been,” produced by the library. The film is also on YouTube (https://youtu.be/gmXF3N62Olo). With a run time of about 25 minutes, the documentary will be screened in a library classroom on Sunday, September 10, beginning at 12:30pm and be screened again every half hour or so, with the last screening about 4pm.\n\nKindly note: all visitors who go to the reading room will need to check any and all bags, coats, and other personal belongings in secure lockers on the library’s ground floor before going to the reading room.\n\nParticipants are also encouraged to visit the Grove Street Cemetery, 227 Grove Street, nearby the library. The cemetery is the final resting place of many of the key figures who promoted and supported the Black college proposal and to many of its main opponents.\n\nJoin us at the first Yale Powwow since 2018!

Engaging with men as fathers is important for sustaining initiatives that seek to build cultures of peace, equity, and social inclusion. It is also important for designing interventions that enhance family cohesion, mental health, and child development. Yet in research and policy, the “father factor” has been all too often ignored. Professor Catherine Panter-Brick begins this talk with a policy brief that gives concrete examples of community-level interventions engaging with fathers to build social change. She then outlines current research with Syrian refugee families, undertaken in Jordan at the invitation of Taghyeer, a non-profit foundation focused on social entrepreneurship and education. Together with colleagues, they assessed the extent to which fathers engaged with their family and community, linked discrepancies in spousal reports to family dynamics, and evaluated family-level impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their work contributes to a small number of studies that have focused on men as fathers, their family-directed behaviors, and family-level pandemic impacts in refugee communities.\n\nCatherine Panter-Brick is the Bruce A. and Davi-Ellen Chabner Professor of Anthropology, Health, and Global Affairs at Yale University. She is an expert on risk and resilience, having spent three decades working with people affected by war, poverty, and marginalization. A medical anthropologist, Panter-Brick was trained in both human biology and the social sciences. She has extensive experience leading mixed-methods research, having directed over forty interdisciplinary projects in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, the Gambia, Jordan, Mexico, Nepal, Niger, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tanzania, the UK and the USA. For her work in humanitarian areas, she received the Lucy Mair Medal, awarded by the Royal Anthropology Institute to honor excellence in the application of anthropology to the active recognition of human dignity.\n\nOn the issue of resilience and mental health, Panter-Brick has been a keynote speaker at the United Nations, contributed to international media broadcasts, and presented at international iNGO dissemination events, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and the United States Institute of Peace. She leads research initiatives to develop effective partnerships between scholars, practitioners, and policymakers. Her work with Syrian refugee youth in Jordan is an example of scientific research evaluating the extent to which interventions can alleviate stress, boost resilience, and improve lives in war-affected communities. She publishes extensively in biomedical and social sciences journals, and has coedited seven books, most recently Medical Humanitarianism (Penn Press 2015) and Pathways to Peace (MIT Press, 2014).\n\nMovie screening (60mn) on Tuesday, March 29th, 2022 immediately followed by Q&A session (60mn).\n\nThis documentary examines the status of women during the transformation of Afghanistan from a totalitarian Taliban theocracy to a democratic country. It tells a story of Suraya Parlika, an Afghan woman who dared to enter public politics, which is eminently a territory of men. It also contains “black chronicle” of crimes from different provinces of Afghanistan, which was perpetrated by men against not only activists but also against women in their family, wives and daughters. Often just because they were determined to acquire a basic education.\n\nThe political arena either on the local or national level is a territory where the presence of active women, despite constitutional guarantees, is considered an oddity. Especially when brave women with unveiled face don’t remain silent, but try to stimulate an open discussion in public space: a discussion on disproportions between the laws and the (in)compliance with them in terms of everyday life, on an open and latent discrimination of women, or on particular crimes of men against the women who try to live their life more dignified.\n\nSahraa Karimi is an Afghan film director and the first woman to head the Afghan Film Organization (Afghan Film). She has directed 30 short films, 3 documentary features and one fiction film “Hava, Maryam, Ayesha (2019), which had the world premiere at the 76th Venice Film Festival in the same year.

Moderated by Ana de la O (Political Science).\n\nAlthough it is not perfect, democracy is the system that best consolidates a just and fair form of government, which gives a voice to all people so that they can exercise their rights and freedoms safely. However, in recent years we have witnessed how democracy has been threatened. From elected leaders who have gradually subverted the democratic process to increase their power to manipulating elections through misinformation and fake news, the democratic system has become progressively weaker and more fragile. This has led to increasingly polarized societies, not only politically, but socially. There appears to be more intolerance, discrimination and exclusion. Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the Organization of American States, is going to talk about the challenges facing democracies as well as what we can do to strengthen our and institutions so that they can stand up to corruption. He will also discuss how to fight social polarization and promote inclusion and equality.\n\nLuis Almagro was first elected as Secretary General of the OAS on March 18, 2015, with the support of 33 of the 34 member states and one abstention. He was re-elected for a second term on March 20, 2020.\n\nA career diplomat, he has extensive regional and international experience. Almagro was Uruguay’s foreign minister between 2010 and 2015. Under his tenure, Uruguay set new records in the growth of its exports. He also defined several landmark initiatives of President José Mujíca’s government that put the country on the global map. Uruguay welcomed former prisoners from Guantanamo, granted asylum to dozens of Syrian families who were victims of civil war, and secured the endorsement of the Group of Latin America and Caribbean Countries (GRULAC) for its election to a seat on the United Nations (UN) Security Council in January 2016.\n\nAlmagro was also ambassador to China for three years, after occupying senior diplomatic posts in his country’s foreign ministry and at its embassies in Germany and Iran. In addition, he was elected as a senator in Uruguay’s national elections in October 2014.\n\nAlmagro is a lawyer by profession and has seven children. Apart from Spanish, he speaks English and French.\n\nWith a record number of refugees moving across the globe, there is much debate among policymakers and academics on how best to provide for refugees’ humanitarian needs while also ensuring the stability of host countries’ political and economic institutions and preventing radicalization among affected groups. As a result, many non-profits and intergovernmental organizations have come together to implement programs that support both refugees and host communities. The Syrian Refugee Life Study (S-RLS) uses a randomized control trial to evaluate the effectiveness of one such specific, scalable program — the Norwegian Refugee Council Jordan’s Urban Shelter Program. This evaluation estimates the direct and spillover effects of shelter assistance on beneficiaries, their children, and their host communities. The study will pair this novel RCT with long-term longitudinal data collection in one of the first systematic efforts to survey a large, representative refugee sample and follow that sample over time. The talk will present initial findings from this ongoing study.\n\nEdward Miguel is the Oxfam Professor of Environmental and Resource Economics at the Department of Economics and Faculty Director of the Center for Effective Global Action at the University of California, Berkeley.

He is the author of three books: Transparent and Reproducible Social Science Research, Economic Gangsters: Corruption, Violence and the Poverty of Nations, and Africa’s Turn? Professor Miguel has received numerous awards for teaching at U.C. Berkeley and has served on numerous doctoral dissertation committees.\n\nA Teach-In featuring faculty from Yale’s African American Studies department and the program in Ethnicity Race and Migration.\n\nSpeakers will contextualize these events and the erosions of democracy in the US by examining the revitalization of democratic ideals by the excluded, marginalized, and oppressed.\n\nMass mobilization in response to government malfeasance is a core component of democratic politics. In the 2020 election, Black organizers registered, educated, and mobilized voters in response to policies intended to disenfranchise Black voters (such as curtailing early voting, requiring ID at polling places and ending same-day voter registration), and “swung” Georgia on January 5th.\n\nThe democratic practice of protest can also be captured and subverted for antidemocratic ends as we saw with the mobilization of Trump supporters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6th. The disturbing images of an angry, violent mob roving through the inner chambers of the Capitol sent shockwaves around the world. In this teach-in, faculty contextualize these events and the erosions of democracy in the US by examining the revitalization of democratic ideals by the excluded, marginalized, and oppressed.\n\nJoin webinar on “The Intersectional Vulnerabilities that COVID Lays Bare” w/Kimberlé Crenshaw and Professor Dan Martínez HoSang\n\nApril 8, 8pm EST\n\nHosted by Kimberlé Crenshaw and the African American Policy Forum. This is the third in a series of wide-ranging conversations that have featured scholars including Dorothy Roberts, Naomi Klein, and other organizers, artists and writers.\n\nTonight’s session will feature speakers describing Covid’s impact in Puerto Rico, Hawaii, in Navajo country and other indigenous communities, and New Orleans, among other places. I will be talking about anti-Asian racism amidst the pandemic, and its connection to widespread and long-standing forms of white supremacy.\n\nAll of the webinars and an associated series of podcasts are archived here.\n\nREGISTER HERE: bit.ly/aapf-covid3\n\nDescription: The past several weeks have prompted unprecedented levels of turmoil and unpredictability due to rising alarm over COVID-19. While American society has taken precautionary measures to counter the spread of the virus, those most vulnerable to societal neglect remain most impacted. Coronavirus did not create the stark social, financial, and political inequalities that define life for so many Americans, but it has made them more strikingly visible than any moment in recent history. Unfortunately, some of the intersectional dimensions of these structural disparities remain undetected and unreported.\n\nAs we witness this unprecedented moment, some of us from home and some of us from the front lines, we want to take the opportunity to gather together and share a piece of what we’re each seeing and experiencing. Join us on April 8th at 8:00 p.m. EST (5:00 p.m. PST) as thought leaders around the country discuss the current crisis, explore how we can move forward together to protect and uplift the most vulnerable among us, and imagine the world we hope to see emerge on the other side.\n\nHosted by Kimberlé Crenshaw.\n\nPinelopi Koujianou Goldberg, Chief Economist of the World Bank Group, will deliver the 30th Annual Kuznets Lecture “Poverty Reduction in the Era of Waning Globalization,” presented by the Yale Economic Growth Center.\n\nTime: Thursday, February 27, 2020, 4:00 to 5:30pm\n\nLocation: 101 Luce Hall, 34 Hillhouse Avenue\n\nGlobalization, for all its faults, has been good to many poor people living in developing countries. Millions in East Asia have escaped the threat of hunger by leaving the fields to work in factories producing manufacturing goods to sell in the West.\n\nWhat happens to the prospects of the world’s poor when the West stops buying?\n\nPinelopi Koujianou Goldberg, Elihu Professor of Economics at Yale, currently on leave serving as Chief Economist of the World Bank Group, will return to campus on February 27 to deliver the 30th annual Kuznets Lecture, presented by the Economic Growth Center. In her talk, “Poverty Reduction in the Era of Waning Globalization”, Professor Goldberg will consider the effects of rising protectionism on poverty, and discuss approaches to poverty reduction in an era of high inequality and waning globalization.\n\n4:30pm Advance book sales\n\n5:00—6:30pm Panel discussion, audience Q&A\n\n6:30—7:00pm Book sales and signing\n\nLocation: Robert L. Mcneil, Jr. Lecture Hall, the Yale University Art Gallery, 1111 Chapel Street, New Haven, CT, 06510\n\nCo-sponsored by the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition and the Yale University Art Gallery\n\nOrganized by the YUAG, the exhibition draws together nearly all of the known preparatory sketches and painted studies made by John Wilson for a powerful mural of a racial-terror lynching. Born in Massachusetts to immigrants from British Guiana, Wilson graduated in 1945 from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, earned a B.S. from Tufts University in 1947, and studied in Paris with the sculptor and painter Fernand Léger. Awarded the John Hay Whitney Fellowship, Wilson studied in Mexico from 1950 through 1956. Inspired by the social activism of Mexican muralists, Wilson painted “The Incident” in 1952, during a course at La Esmerelda, the national school of art in Mexico City.\n\nThis panel discussion uses John Wilson’s mural and the Yale University Art Gallery exhibition as a springboard for discussing representations of lynching and other racial violence, past and present. Lynching was and remains a public spectacle meant to challenge social and economic progress among black people and other people of color and reinforce white supremacist hierarchies. While many artists have opposed these grotesque acts of brutality using a variety of media, Wilson’s mural stands out for its size, the ephemerality of its form, and its representation of African American resistance and physical defense of their families. The panelists will discuss the role of the humanities and public art in grappling with this horrible aspect of U.S. history. Aesthetically, historically, and legally, how can we understand and confront legacies of racial terror in American life?\n\nModerator: David W. Blight (Director, Gilder Lehrman Center; Sterling Professor of American History, Yale University)\n\nPanelists:\n\n· Fitzhugh Brundage (William Umstead Distinguished Professor, Department of History, University of North Carolina- Chapel Hill)\n\n· Crystal Feimster (Associate Professor of African American Studies, History, and American Studies, Yale University)\n\n· Ken Gonzales-Day (Fletcher Jones Chair in Art at Scripps College, Claremont, California)\n\n· Jennifer Taylor (Senior Attorney, Equal Justice Initiative)\n\nJoin us for an afternoon talk and Q&A with Elizabeth Hoover, professor of American Studies at Brown University, where she serves as the faculty director for the Native American and Indigenous Studies initiative. Her presentation will focus on themes from her upcoming book, From “Garden Warriors” to “Good Seeds:” Indigenizing the Local Food Movement, which examines the definitions and practices of Native American food sovereignty as indigenous people across the country understand them. Through extensive interviews and research, she brings together the visions and work of seed-keepers, gardeners, farmers, and activists to compose a more complete portrait of the food sovereignty landscape.\n\nElizabeth Hoover is the Manning Professor of American Studies at Brown University. She studies environmental justice and health in Native American communities, and is the author of journal articles and the book The River is in Us; Fighting Toxins in a Mohawk Community. She served as an editor for the volume Indigenous Food Sovereignty in the United States: Restoring Cultural Knowledge, Protecting Environments, and Regaining Health. She is also a published photographer, with work appearing in cookbooks like The Sioux Chef’s Indigenous Kitchen and news outlets like Democracy Now.\n\nChewing the Fat is the Yale Sustainable Food Program’s long-standing speaker series. All events are free and open to the public. This event is hosted in collaboration with the Native American Cultural Center at Yale, and the Yale Center for the Study of Race, Indigeneity, and Transnational Migration.\n\nFrom chop suey to spam, curry to sushi, the connections between food and the histories of Asian America run deep, weaving together themes of identity, labor, immigration, and geopolitics. As part of the Asian American Cultural Center’s “Life After Yale” series, a panel of recent Yale alumni will speak on these issues for their own food careers. We invite you to join us, and our four distinguished panelists (Rupa Bhattacharya SY ’03, Lucas Sin DC ’15. Jaime Sunwoo SY ’14, and Latha Swamy FES ’16) for an evening conversation. Dinner will be provided.\n\nLatha Swamy FES ‘16 is Director of Food System Policy for the City of New Haven. She also serves as Senior Adviser in Planetary Health to the Former President of Mexico, Ernesto Zedillo, at the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization.

What are the conditions that make for this imagining, this fantasy or rather, demand of a new start point? In this piece I consider the world of settler colonialism, which demands this newness, and a world in which Native people and their claims to territory are whittled to the status of claimant or subject in time with the fantasy of their disappearance and containment away from a modern and critical present. This fantasy of a world without Indigenous people extends to a mode of governance that is beyond institutional and ideological but is in this study, deeply affective. In this piece I examine how the Canadian practice of settler governance has adjusted itself in line with global trends and rights paradigms away from overt violence to what are seen as softer and kinder, caring modes of governing but governing, violently still and yet, with a language of care, upon still stolen land. This piece asks not only in what world we imagine time to stop, but takes up the ways in which those that survived the time stoppage stand in critical relationship to dispossession and settler governance apprehend, analyze and act upon this project of affective governance. Here an oral and textual history of the notion of “reconciliation” is constructed and analyzed with recourse to Indigenous criticism of this affective project of repair.\n\nAudra Simpson is Professor of Anthropology at Columbia University.

From the advent of early colonial photography in the 19th century to contemporary social media and photographic art, photography has always played and continues to play an integral role in the maintenance of the political and social hegemony of “whiteness”. The technology of the camera is not innocent, nor are the images it produces or the people who make them.\n\nThis presentation and discussion engages the oppressive nature of whiteness, and highlights some of the crucial work contemporary photographic artists are doing to subvert and critique its image and its continuing power.\n\nPhoto Credit: Buck Ellison, The Prince Children, Holland, Michigan, 2019.

It shows that the figuration of Asian Americans has played a critical role in the legal-ideological project of despecifying black subjection and disavowing racial positionality in the U.S. social order, from Bakke to the present, and argues that a new ‘sociometry’ of race is necessary to help us understand and challenge persistent structures of racial power.\n\nThis event is part of the RITM Asian American Studies Speaker Series.\n\nProfessor Elizabeth Son and Professor Simeon Man, will discuss their recently published works: Soldiering through Empire: Race and the Making of the Decolonizing Pacific and Embodied Reckonings: “Comfort Women,” Performance, and Transpacific Redress.” The authors will situate their works within Asian American studies historiography and discuss future directions for research and critical inquiry.\n\nElizabeth Son is Associate Professor in the Department of Theatre at Northwestern University, with courtesy appointments in the Department of Performance Studies, Asian American Studies Program, and the Program in American Studies.

Komagata Maru left Hong Kong for Vancouver carrying 376 Punjabi migrants. Chartered by railway contractor Gurdit Singh, the ship and its passengers were denied entry into Canada and eventually deported to Calcutta. In this talk, Renisa Mawani retells the well-known story of the Komagata Maru. Drawing on what she terms “oceans as method”—a mode of thinking and writing that repositions land and sea—Mawani places the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans into conversation to track the circulating legalities that connected the Dominions, colonies, and territories; the shifting intensities of racial and colonial violence that joined indigenous dispossession, transatlantic slavery, and Indian indenture to so-called “free” migration; and the transoceanic repertoires of anticolonial critique that challenged the empire’s underlying racial, spatial, and temporal divides. By following the movements of a single ship and bringing these three oceans into sharper view, Mawani offers a novel method of writing colonial legal history.\n\nRenisa Mawani is Professor of Sociology and recurring Chair of the Law and Society Program at the University of British Columbia. She works in the fields of critical theory and colonial legal history and has published widely on law, colonialism, and legal geography. Her first book, Colonial Proximities (2009) details a set of legal encounters between indigenous peoples, Chinese migrants, “mixed-race” populations, and Europeans in late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century British Columbia. Her second book, Across Oceans of Law (Duke University Press, 2018), is a global and maritime legal history of the S.S. Komagata Maru, a British-built and Japanese-owned steamship. She is co-editor of “The Travels of Law: Indian Ocean Itineraries” published in Law and History Review (2014); and co-editor of Unmooring the Komagata Maru (2019); with Antoinette Burton, she is co-editor of Animalia: An Anti-Imperial Bestiary of Our Times. An award-winning scholar and instructor, she has just been elected to the Law and Society Association’s Board of Trustees (2019-2022).\n\nEVENT POSTER\n\nMiriam Ticktin is Associate Professor Anthropology at the New School for Social Research. She was Chair of Anthropology from 2016-2018, Co-Director of the Zolberg Institute on Migration and Mobility between 2013-2016 and Director of Gender Studies from 2012-2013. She received her Ph.D. in Anthropology at Stanford University and from the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris, France (as a co-tutelle), and an MA in English Literature from Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar.\n\nTicktin’s research has focused in the broadest sense on “the political”: what it is, how it is called into being, how inequalities are produced and challenged and how new political formations are imagined. Her earlier research asks what it means to make political claims in the name of a universal humanity, with a focus on human rights and humanitarianism; her current research is more interested in imagining and opening the way to new political formations. She uses a decolonial, feminist methodology, and the central lenses onto these questions are gender, race and migration. She is the author of Casualties of Care: Immigration and the Politics of Humanitarianism in France (University of California Press, 2011) and In the Name of Humanity: the Government of Threat and Care (co-editor with Ilana Feldman, Duke University Press, 2010), along with many other articles and book chapters.\n\nTicktin is currently at work on two related book projects: 1) a short book on innocence as a political concept, and how it produces an unending search for purity; 2) a book on the way border wall technologies travel, both transnationally and cross-species.\n\nEvent poster\n\nIs the discrimination faced by “mixed race” populations different from that faced by people of other races? How does various forms of racial difference get codified as law and in the built environment in the US, Latin America, and the Caribbean? Through their respective works on US Civil Rights Law and housing segregation in Puerto Rico, Dr. Tanya Hernandez and Dr. Zaire Dinzey-Flores approach these questions.\n\nDr. Hernandez, a legal scholar and author of the recently published “Multiracials and the Civil Rights” (NYU Press, 2018), shows how the law has targeted multi-racial people primarily because of their non-whiteness, and proposes that traditional civil rights laws built on strict traditional civil rights laws built on a strict black/white binary need to be reformed to account for cases of discrimination against those identifying as mixed-race.\n\nDr. Dinzey-Flores, a sociologist and author of the award-winning Locked In, Locked Out: Gated Communities in a Puerto Rican City (Penn, 2014), considers how “blackness” gets codified in residential spaces –like the caserio (projects) and the urbanizaciones (suburbs)– in Puerto Rico. Describing the complex role that gates played in protecting the wealthy and white, and criminalizing the poor and Black, Dr. Dinzey-Flores documents and analyzes segregationist policies characteristic of government initiatives in Puerto Rico since the 1990s.\n\nJoin a book reading and book talk with author Amitava Kumar, Professor of English on the Helen D. Lockwood Chair at Vassar College.\n\nAmitava Kumar is the author, most recently, of a novel Immigrant, Montana (2018, Knopf). An earlier version of the novel was recently published in India under the title The Lovers.\n\nKumar has written several works of literary non-fiction, including the prize-winning book A Foreigner Carrying in the Crook of His Arm a Tiny Bomb, described by the New York Times as a “perceptive and soulful” meditation on “the cultural and human repercussions” of the global war on terror. His other titles include Passport Photos, Bombay-London-New York, Husband of a Fanatic, A Matter of Rats: A Short Biography of Patna, and Lunch with a Bigot: The Writer in the World. Kumar’s first novel, Home Products, was short-listed for India’s premier literary award and republished in the US under the title Nobody Does the Right Thing.

She is also the primary investigator for Mapping Violence, a digital research project that documents histories of racial violence in Texas.\n\nEvent Abstract:\n\nMonica’s book, The Injustice Never Leaves You: Anti-Mexican Violence in Texas, delves into the killing of Mexican residents committed between 1910 and 1920 by vigilantes and law enforcement―including the renowned Texas Rangers. Mexican residents were killed with impunity. The full extent of the violence was known only to the relatives of the victims. Monica turns to the keepers of this history to tell this riveting and disturbing untold story.\n\nThis event is part of the Ethnicity, Race, and Migration 20th anniversary, Latinx Speaker Series.\n\nDr. Nolan L. Cabrera is an associate professor in the Center for the Study of Higher Education where he studies the racial dynamics on college campuses with a focus on Whiteness. He was also one of three expert witnesses on behalf of the plaintiffs in the Tucson Unified ethnic studies federal trial.\n\nEvent Abstract:\n\nWhite Guys on Campus is a critical examination of race in higher education, centering Whiteness, in an effort to unveil the frequently unconscious habits of racism among White male undergraduates. Nolan L. Cabrera moves beyond the “few bad apples” frame of contemporary racism, and explores the structures, policies, ideologies, and experiences that allow racism to flourish. This book details many of the contours of contemporary, systemic racism, while engaging the possibility of White students to participate in anti-racism. Ultimately, White Guys on Campus calls upon institutions of higher education to be sites of social transformation instead of reinforcing systemic racism, while creating a platform to engage and challenge the public discourse of “post- racialism.”\n\nMatthew Frye Jacobson, Ph.D., Brown University, 1992, is professor of African American Studies, History, and American Studies.\n\nHe is the author of What Have They Built You to Do?: The Manchurian Candidate and Cold War America, (with Gaspar Gonzalez, 2006), Roots Too: White Ethnic Revival in Post–Civil Rights America (2005), Barbarian Virtues: The United States Encounters Foreign Peoples at Home and Abroad, 1876–1917 (2000), Whiteness of a Different Color: European Immigrants and the Alchemy of Race (1998), and Special Sorrows: The Diasporic Imagination of Irish, Polish, and Jewish Immigrants in the United States (1995).

Join a candid conversation with Professor Laguna as he discusses his new book Diversion: Play and Popular Culture in Cuban America.\n\nEvent Description:\n\nIn an era of warming relations between the US and Cuba, this book updates the conversation about Cuban America by showing how this community has changed over the past 25 years. No longer a conservative Republican voting bloc, the majority of Cubans today want more engagement with the island instead of less. Laguna investigates the generational shifts and tensions in a Cuban America where the majority is now made up of immigrants who arrived since the 1990s and those born in the US.\n\nTo probe these changes, Laguna examines the aesthetic and social logics of a wide range of popular culture forms originating in Miami and Cuba from the 1970s through the 2010s. They include the stand-up comedy of performers like Alvarez Guedes and Robertico, a festival called Cuba Nostalgia, Miami morning radio shows, a form of media distribution on the island known as el paquete, and the viral social media content of Los Pichy Boys. This study illustrates the centrality of play in a community that has been described historically as angry, reactionary, and melancholic. Diversión contends that our understanding of the Cuban diaspora is lacking not in seriousness, but in play.\n\nBy unpacking this archive, Laguna explores our complex, often fraught attachments to popular culture and the way it can challenge and reproduce typical cultural ideologies—especially in relation to politics and race. In the wake of the largest migration wave to the US in Cuban history, Diversión and its focus on play is crucial reading for those who seek to understand not only the Cuban American diaspora, but cultural and economic life on the island.\n\nLunch will be served.\n\nThe Yale French North American Studies working group and the Yale Program in Ethnicity, Race, and Migration are pleased to welcome Leyla McCalla, a Haitian-American musician based in New Orleans, Louisiana, for a series of events including a free concert this Wednesday the 24!\n\nLeyla McCalla finds inspiration from a variety of sources, whether it is her Haitian heritage, living in New Orleans, or dancing at Cajun Mardi Gras. Both of McCalla’s parents were born in Haiti. Her father, Jocelyn McCalla, was the Executive Director of the New York-based National Coalition for Haitian Rights. Her mother, Régine Dupuy, is the daughter of Ben Dupuy, who ran Haïti Progrès, a New York-based Haitian socialist newspaper published in Florida, Haiti, New York, and Quebec.\n\nAs a teenager, Leyla relocated to Accra, Ghana for two years. Upon her return, she attended Smith College for a year before transferring to New York University, where she studied cello performance and chamber music. It was the move to New Orleans that signaled a journey of musical and cultural discovery for Leyla. “New Orleans always felt like home to me,” she recalls. “The more I learned about the history of Louisiana, its ties to Haiti, and French speaking culture, the more sense of belonging I felt and continue to feel.” Her critically acclaimed 2013 album Vari-Colored Songs is a tribute to Langston Hughes. Her most recent album, A Day For The Hunter, A Day For The Prey, features other Francophone artists, including Louis Michot of the Lost Bayou Ramblers.\n\nLeyla will perform in-concert on January 24, 2018 in the Davenport Common Room at 248 York Street, New Haven. Doors open at 7:30 PM. Concert is free and open to the public!

In the 1980s and 1990s, ten thousand of these refugees arrived in the Bronx, New York. Chronicling their unfinished odyssey, Unsettled tells the story of a refugee community’s survival and resistance amid the concentrated poverty of the Bronx. Scholar and organizer Eric Tang (University of Texas, Austin) locates the Bronx Cambodians and their “unclosed sojourn” within a longer history of war and displacement. In so doing he explores the relationship between refugee communities and African Americans as they experience common and distinct forms of state violence taking shape in America’s inner cities. Tang’s research sits at the intersection of two issues that define the current moment: the international refugee crisis and the resurgent movement against police violence in the urban United States.\n\nEric Tang is an Associate Professor in the African and African Diaspora Studies Department and faculty member in the Center for Asian American Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. He also holds a courtesy appointment in the Department of Sociology. He is CUNY’s 2016-2017 Thomas Tam Visiting Professor in Asian American Studies (Asian American/Asian Research Institute).

Her first novel Ghana Must Go (2013) is a tale of family drama and reconciliation, following six characters and spanning generations, continents, genders, and classes. Ghana Must Go is at once a portrait of a modern family, and an exploration of the importance of where we come from to who we are. In a sweeping narrative that takes us from Accra to Lagos to London to New York, the work teaches that the truths we speak can heal the wounds we hid.\n\nCo-Sponsored by the Public Humanities Program, Creative Writing, and ER&M at Yale\n\nIn recent years, we have witnessed a flourishing of cultural, scholarly, and activist work concerned with the entanglement of state-sanctioned violence in the United States and Israeli violence in the Palestinian territories. The history of this entanglement warrants careful elaboration. Drawing from his recent book, A Shadow over Palestine: The Imperial Life of Race in America, Keith P. Feldman examines the moment when U.S. civil rights and antiwar struggles, Israeli military and administrative occupation, and Palestinian narratives of dispossession, dispersion, and resistance were forged, felt, and thought together. As became increasingly evident, the dialectic of occupation (June ’67) and liberation (Global ’68) animated a slew of incisive cultural production, from novels and poetry, pamphlets to posters.\n\nKeith P. Feldman is Assistant Professor of Comparative Ethnic Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.

And yet, over time, they all became celebrated cultural icons and champions of truth, justice, and freedom. In short, they define what it means to be ULTRA-AMERICAN.\n\n“ULTRA-AMERICAN: A Patriot Act” is Usman’s newest creative project. The Chicago-based standup comedian’s one-man show is an exploration of the tensions and paradoxes surrounding national, cultural, and religious identity in an ever-polarizing world. The show is certainly funny, but also packs a serious intellectual firepower. It is NOT INTENDED for audiences who are easily offended, nor those uninterested in having their beliefs and biases questioned.\n\nCNN called Usman “America’s Funniest Muslim,” and Georgetown University identified him as “one of the 500 Most Influential Muslims in the World.” In 2010, standup icon Dave Chappelle–for whom Usman has opened over 50 times–commented “Azhar Usman is untouchable.” As the co-founder of the international comedy showcase “Allah Made Me Funny,” he has toured over 20 countries on five continents. His comedy has been profiled/reviewed by over 100 major world media outlets including The New York Times, The Economist, BBC, The Guardian, NPR, TIME Magazine, Al-Jazeera, USA Today, and Fox News. Most recently, he served as creative consultant on Hannibal Buress’ new Netflix comedy special, “Comedy Camisado,” and also appeared in Robert Smigel and Conan O’Brien’s “Triumph’s Election Special 2016” for Hulu.\n\nMin Jin Lee was born in Seoul and immigrated to New York in 1976 when she was seven years old.

It will delve into the political economy of the United States, as the core of the world system, to show how its solutions to grave crises emerge through the axes of defunding the social good and funding the security apparatus. Black Lives Matter, then, is not a choice, but a necessary outcome of the dynamic of contemporary policy making.\n\nVijay Prashad is Professor of International Studies at Trinity College.

At the same time, it is also in public schools where citizens continue to organize most passionately to limit the influence of this heterogeneity on our curricula and classroom culture.\n\nClassroom Wars explores how we got here. Focusing on California’s schools during the 1960s and 1970s, historian Natalia Mehlman Petrzela charts how a state and a citizenry deeply committed to public education as an engine of civic and moral education navigated the massive changes brought about by the 1960s, including the sexual revolution, school desegregation, and a dramatic increase in Latino immigration.\n\nIn California, where a volatile political culture nurtured both Orange County mega-churches and Berkeley coffeehouses, these changes reverberated especially powerfully. Analyzing two of the era’s most innovative, nationally impactful, and never-before juxtaposed programs – Spanish-bilingual and sex education – Classroom Wars charts how during a time of extraordinary social change, grass-roots citizens politicized the schoolhouse and family. Many came to link such progressive educational programs not only with threats to the family and nation but also with rising taxes, which they feared were being squandered on morally lax educators teaching ethically"
