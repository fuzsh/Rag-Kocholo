        "text": "2014 CAVB Coaches Commission\n\nCAVB Coaches Commission meets in Cairo for a new era\n\nAfrican Volleyball Confederation “CAVB” will meet in Cairo, Egypt on Wednesday April 9 to discuss the future projects for coaching in the coming years.\n\nThe meeting will be attended by CAVB President Dr Amr Elwani, Coaches Commission President Sherif El Shemerly and CAVB Executive Director Howyda Mondy.\n\nAmong other important points in the Agenda, the Commission discusses the 4th High Performance Seminar which is the peak annual developmental event dealing with the highest grades of coaches.\n\nThe African Instructor will be another project which will put the main criteria for the new coaches’ instructors who can fulfill the increasing demand for the courses in the different continental zones.\n\nOther topics are Coaches Scholarship, Grassroots Courses and Coaches Aid Programme.\n\nThe meeting will be followed by a 3 day seminar for coaches’ instructors which will be conducted by the FIVB Coaches Instructor Jivico Jetchev, where the top selected coaches will have the chance to gain the experience to be future instructors.\n\n“We have a condensed ambitious programme for the coming year after we succeeded to implement most of our programme last year,” El Shemerly said.\n\n“In 2014 we are looking forwards to a new era of our coaching activity and start a lot of programmes which will reflect positively for our sport.”\n\nCAVB web site: http://www.cavb.org Twitter: CAVB Tweets Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CAVBVolleyball\n\nYouTube: CAVB Video\n\nAgain the battle for supremacy between Nigeria and Egypt came to fore at the ongoing International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF)-sanctioned African Junior Championship as Team Nigeria clash against Team Egypt in the girls’ final.\n\nHowever, Congo Brazzaville prevented Nigeria from playing in the final of the boys’ event after the Congolese beat Olasunkanmi Oginni-led team to secure a spot ahead of Nigeria in the last four of the event.\n\nAlso in the boys’ cadet division, Nigeria failed to advance to the last four following the inability of the team to beat Congo Brazzaville in the group game concluded on Tuesday.\n\nUnlike their male counterpart, the trio of Tosin Esther Oribamise, Ajoke Ojomu and Alimot Ayinla ensured that their place in the final was not usurped as they defeated Algeria 3-0 in the semifinal after coming second behind Egypt in Group One. Egypt also walloped Tunisia 3-0 to set up another encounter against Nigeria in the final of the junior event.\n\nIn the girls’ cadet event, the Nigeria managed a 3-2 win over Algeria while Egypt had no problem beating Tunisia 3-0 to confront Nigeria in another final.\n\nMeanwhile, the doubles and singles events will commence on Wednesday, as all eyes will be on Egypt, Nigeria, Congo Brazzaville and Tunisia.\n\nFlying Eagles coach Manu Garba is considering starting with a new central defence pairing of Wilfred Ndidi and Zaharadeen Bello for Wednesday’s friendly against Morocco U20s.\n\nManu appeared to have settled with Aliyu Abubakar partnering stand-in captain Ndidi in the heart of the back four.\n\nBut in Monday evening’s training at the Wellness and Sport Center outside Casablanca, he paired Ndidi with Bello, who incidentally partnered Abubakar when the Golden Eaglets won a record fourth FIFA U17 World Cup last year.\n\nOtherwise, he has a settled starting XI with Adamu Abubakar in goal with Izu Omego at left back and Mustapha Abdullahi playing at right back.\n\nThe midfield has Akinjide Idowu, Abdullahi Alfa, Bernard Bulbwa and Ifeanyi Matthew, who shone like a million stars in the 12-0 spanking of Lugbe United last week.\n\nThe attack will be anchored by Taiwo Awoniyi and Alhassan Ibrahim aka ‘Mu-azam’ in Manu’s favoured 4-4-2 formation.\n\nHowever, Manu said he hopes to give all squad members a run out in Morocco as the Flying Eagles continue their buildup for next month’s AYC qualifier.\n\n“We want to win all our matches, whether they are friendlies, qualifiers or the World Cup. We must there take all the matches very seriously,” said the Flying Eagles handler.\n\nThe team will train on Tuesday by 11am.\n\nWednesday’s match is fixed for Rabat by 4pm, while the second game will be played on Friday from 11am in Casablanca.\n\nThe Flying Eagles are due back in Nigeria on Saturday.\n\nThe Flying Eagles will face amateur club Lugbe United in a test game Thursday morning to prepare for next week’s matches against Morocco U20s.\n\nTeam co-ordinator Sule Abubakar said that the test game will Area 3 sports ground in Abuja by 7am.\n\n“It will be a good opportunity to test our readiness for the matches in Morocco,” he said.\n\nThe Flying Eagles are expected to depart Abuja Saturday for Lagos for the early morning flight to Morocco on Sunday.\n\nThe Nigeria U20 team will play two matches against their Moroccan counterparts on April 9 and 11.\n\nIn the meantime, former Golden Eaglets skipper Musa Muhammed is expected from Turkish club Besiktas on Thursday, while Chidera Eze from Portuguese champions FC Porto is due to join the team on Saturday.\n\nTeam secretary Ali Auwal Ibrahim said English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur have cleared Musa Yahaya to join the country’s youth team.\n\nYahaya has since joined the team as a result.\n\nKenya will host Tanzania in a 2015 African Youth Championship qualifier this weekend in Nairobi with the overall winners facing Nigeria in early May in continuation of the qualifying tournament.\n\nLike the Flying Eagles, Morocco have been drawn bye to the second round, where they will slug it out with the winners of the match between Togo and Equatorial Guinea.\n\nThey left unannounced but when they got to Taipei City in Chinese Taipei, they wowed the whole world with their beautiful display despite their inexperience and lack of exposure.\n\nThe Team Nigeria nine-man team that featured at the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF)-organised Youth Olympics Qualifiers as well as the World Junior Championships returned to the country at the weekend from the Asian country with a lot of gains as well as challenges that prevented them from fulfilling their potentials at the competitions.\n\nThe team tutored by the Coach Jin Beom Kim, would remain grateful to the National Sports Commission (NSC) as well as the Director General of the commission, Gbenga Elegbeleye for facilitating the trip despite the short time to prepare.\n\nAt the WTF Youth Olympics Qualifiers, none of them advanced beyond the first round but at the World Junior Championships some of them won their first round fights, which was an improvement for the team.\n\nAlthough before the team embarked on the trip, Coach Jin Beom Kim never raised the hope of the team but he believed that the experience and exposure would count for the team in subsequent tournaments especially the forthcoming African Junior Championship holding in May in Botswana.\n\nImpressed by the team’s performance after the world taekwondo ruling body discovered that the entire team was making their debut in an international competition, WTF was inspired to give Nigeria a wildcard for the 2014 Youth Olympics holding in August in Nanjing, China.\n\nThe taekwondists who spoke after their arrival at the weekend admitted that the trip has afforded them the opportunity to learn the new techniques in the sport.\n\nOlushola Olowookere, who fought in the male -68kg of the World Youth Championships, said with the knowledge he acquired at the tourney, has boosted his morale\n\n“Attending this competition alone was indeed a great experience for me. I gained a lot in terms of the new styles as well as new moves. Although, I lost my fight but I was able to watch other top athletes fight so that I can use what I picked up from there to help myself in subsequent competitions. I want to express our sincere gratitude to NSC, DG as well as the Korean coach for this rare opportunity given to some of us,” he said.\n\nAbdullah Adegoke, who was one of the athletes that won his first round fight in the male -59kg, admitted that he was sure that going to Botswana in May, he has the wherewithal to clinch a medal.\n\nAlso, Adamu Abubakar Isa, who fought in the two events could not quantify the knowledge he gained from being part of the team, saying, “I think this would always remain with me and I look forward to breaking into the senior national team.”\n\nEsther Godwin and Ogeh Ogochukwu who fought in the female events never believed they could wear the colours of Nigeria but their dream became reality in Taipei when they both featured in the two events.\n\n“At least I was able to win one of my fights during the World Junior Championship and this alone has given me hope that with more training, I can conquer the continent in May before aiming to triumph over the world. I think my dream of winning medals for Nigeria in major competitions is getting closer,” Godwin proclaimed.\n\nLike Godwin, Ogochukwu, believes her first appearance at the world tournament has ignited her passion to aim high in the sport. “I never expected that I will represent Nigeria but with what I witnessed in Taipei, I am now sure that with more hardwork, I am destined to be among the first set of female medalists for Nigeria at the Olympics,” Ogochukwu said.\n\nHowever, two of the athletes are also expected to start their Senior School Certificate Examinations (SSCE) on Monday March 31, as they spent at least three hours a day during the competition to study for the examinations.\n\n2014 Men’s African Club championship- Final\n\nEsperance Club (Tunisia) claimed the 2014 Men’s African Club Championship title following their victory over Ahly (Egypt) 3-0 (25-19, 25-20, 25-14) in the competition final held at Olympic Hall in Sousse, Tunisia on Saturday to book FIVB Club World Championship ticket in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in May 5 to 11, 2014.\n\nDefending champions Sfax (TUN) defeated their compatriots Etoile du Sahel 3-1 (20-25, 25-15, 25-16, 25-21) to clinch the bronze medal.\n\nThis will be the second time for a team from Tunisia to take part in the FIVB Volleyball Men’s Club World Championship since the return back of its activity in 2009 after Sfax played last year in Brazil.\n\nEtoile du Sahel recorded their 4th title after 1994, 1998 and 2000, while Ahly stayed as all time record holders with 10 crowns under their name in 1980, 1983, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2010 and 2011.\n\nFinal\n\nEsperance (TUN) beat Ahly (EGY) 3-0 (25-19, 25-20, 25-14)\n\nEsperance started the match as the better side as they used the sharp hits of Elyes Karamosli from position 4 and Hichem ElKaabi from position 2. Ahly improved relatively before through their blockers to decrease the point deficit to 16-10 at the second TTO before Esperance maintained their dominance to win the set 25-19.\n\nAhly started the second set in a better performance with their big gun Ahmed Kotb sending his strong hits from position 2 as Ahly led 4-2 before Esperance controlled the match again with the skillful combinations of their setter Mahdi Ben Cheick. They continued their attacking action to win the set 25-20.\n\nEsperance motivations increased, while Ahly dropped acutely in the third set as the Tunisian controlled the net action regularly to win the set widely 25-14 and the match in straight sets.\n\nBronze Medal match\n\nSfax (TUN) beat Etoile du Sahel (TUN)\n\nDefending champions Sfax (TUN) took over Etoile du Sahel 3-1 (20-25, 25-15, 25-16, 25-21) to clinch the bronze medal.\n\nEtoile played their best in the first set to win 25-20 with their proper reception and good development of the attacks. Afterwards Sfax controlled the match and succeeded to win three successive set in their way to get the bronze medal.\n\n5th place match\n\nSetif (Algeria) beat Bourj Bouaririj (Algeria) 3-1(25-20, 21-25, 25-22, 25-21)\n\nSetif (Algeria) beat their compatriots Bourj Bouaririj 3-1(25-20, 21-25, 25-22, 25-21) in the fifth place match.
