NOTE ON ORTHOGRAPHY Transliteration of Arabic words complies with the system utilized by Cam- bridge's International Journal of Middle East Studies. This system is re- produced for reference purposes below. Place names rely on the French spelling (thus Oujdah, not Wijda), unless the name has been previously Anglicized (thus Fez, not Fés). Family names from sub-Saharan Africa are preserved as earlier represented in literature for the sake of continuity. Thus Niasse, Sy, and Cissé appear as they would on government passports and in earlier academic literature, rather than the Wolof spelling Naas, Sii, and Seesay or the Arabic transliteration Anyās, Sih, and Sisi. I have otherwise opted for the Arabic transliteration of first names in most cases (thus Tijani rather than Tidiane, Hasan rather than Assane, Ahmad rather than Amadou). All dates mentioned in the text have been converted to “Common Era\" (CE). Translations from Arabic and French into English are my own, unless otherwise indicated.

But for followers of the nascent Tijāniyya in late eighteenth-century North Africa, verification, realization, or actualization (tahqīq) of Islamic religious identity appears at the center of their search for knowledge. To a student of Islamic learning, al-Tijānī thus wrote, “May God . . . cause us to seek the way of realization (tahqīq) and sincerity (sadād), and may He allow us to die on the religion pleasing to Him.” For al-Tijānī, the establishment of his own *Muhammadan spiritual path” (Tarīqa Muhammadiyya) was the means to share the realization of human potentiality, exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad, at a time when humanity was perceived to be distant from God. The Tijānī Muhammadan path (or Tijaniyya) emphasized the individual self's acquisition of divine satisfaction by following the external and internal example of the Prophet Muhammad. Verification of the external Muhammadan law (Sharī a) thus paralleled verification of an enduringly important prophetic spiritual pres- ence. The resultant activation of the Muhammadan essence at the core of human identity made an individual the recipient of divine grace, even in a perceived age of social and political corruption. Such realization of the human condition (tahqiq al-insaniyya) was not unique to al-Tijānī and his followers. But even if the Tijānī version of the Tariqa Muhammadiyya drew upon similar articulations within an eighteenth-century global scholarly network, the Tijāniyya developed a dis- tinctive rendition of this concept. Al-Tijanr's notion of the consummation, I 2 INTRODUCTION perfection, or “sealing” of the Muhammadan path in the Tijāniyya both responded to regional Maghrebi intellectual and social currents and fa- cilitated the global spread of the order in a manner perhaps unrivaled by contemporary articulations. With a vibrant and growing presence in West and North Africa, the Middle East, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Mus- lim minority communities in Europe and the Americas, the Tijāniyya has certainly become one of the world’s most widespread Sufi orders. The Tyaniyya came with nothing new in relation to earlier Islamic and Sufi ideas: adherents conceived their affiliation to the “way of Muhammad” as the fullest actualization of a very old and basic concept. In most Arabic dictionaries, the meaning for haqqaqa or tahgīg is to “act according to the truth,” or to “verify; confirm.” To make tahgigq is thus to put knowledge into practice, or confirm a religious truth through its performance. The notion of actualization as a form of knowledge beyond rational verifica- tion was associated with Sufism in opposition to Hellenistic philosophy at least since the thirteenth-century formulations of the Andalusian Ibn al-‘Arabi and his Anatolian disciple Sadr al-Dīn al-Oūnawī.* According to William Chittick: Sufi teachers frequently spoke of the goal of the Islamic tradition as “realization” (tahgīg), a word derived from the same root as the Divine Name a/-Hagg, the Real, the Right, the True, the Appropriate. Grammatically, realization means to actualize truth (haqq) and reality (haqīqa), and in Sufism it came to designate the end result of following the path to God. To achieve realization means to reach the Real, to see and understand all things in light of the Real, and to act rightly and appropriately in all situations. This demands the transformation of the very being of the seeker.* A muhaqqiq is thus one in whom truth has become manifest: he is the living proof of the truth's verification. The spiritual claims of the Tijaniyya—that al-Tijàni was the Seal of Saints, that the \"stamp\" of the Tijaniyya is over all other Sufi paths till the end of time, for example—is best understood through the concept of tahgīg. Sufi actualization was part of a more general accent on scholarly verifica- tion for al-Tijani. According to al-Tijanr's close disciple ‘Ali Harazim: Among his concerns was verification (tahqīq) and scrutiny (tadqiq) in everything, large or small, in order to establish the real truth. By this, The Tijāniyya and the Verification of Islamic Knowledge 3 he departed from the yoke of imitation (taglīd) and (blind) acceptance (tasdīg) ... until he came to encompass all of the official sciences (al- ‘ulum al-rasmiyya), with verification, investigation, understanding, and contemplation; solving problems and enigmas. He became the imam of all types of knowledge. People sought him out for his expla- nations, for he was knowledgeable of the cause, judgement, sources, branches, derivative issues, understandings, pronouncements, abro- gating and abrogated matters [in all fields of learning]. He plunged into the depths of all transmitted and official learning . . . just as [he did in] the knowledge of divine reality. In other words, the appeal of eighteenth-century scholar-saints such as Ahmad al-Tijani was their perceived ability to offer a comprehensive re- alization of an Islamic religious identity. These exemplars were guides to the truth in a time of confusion. “The true scholar,” al-Tyani said, “gives form to what is clear, and clarifies what is ambiguous, from the strength of his knowledge, the breadth of his understanding, the soundness of his spiritual vision (nazr) and his verification (tahqiq).”’ Al-Tijani’s Sufi claims are illegible without an appreciation of this vibrant discourse on the veri- fication and realization of Islamic knowledge, by which scholars justified their prominence in the eighteenth-century Muslim world. Al-Tijānī's Tarīqa Muhammadiyya, allegedly gifted directly by the Prophet in a waking encounter to al-Tijānī, was thus meant to verify the essence of all Sufi paths. The shaykh's own realization of paradigmatic sainthood was articulated as simply the reflection of his spiritual proximity to the Prophet Muhammad as the source of all divine realization. While such claims to saintly authority were no doubt controversial to an exter- nal audience, they were certainly not illegible. Sufi saints, and premodern Islamic religious authority more generally, were “presences” thought to be inscribed not only with the knowledge they taught, but with the aspira- tions of their students and followers. Without saints, there is no Sufism,” a prominent historian of Sufism observed.’ But too often observers have decontextualized the spiritual claims of saints from disciple investiture in sainthood as a participatory medium.’ “Tf the greatest of the perfected saints (agtab) came to know what has been given to our companions,” al- Tijānī assured his disciples, “they would cry to God and say, ‘Our Lord, you have given us nothing.\" \"? In partial explanation, the shaykh reported the Prophet Muhammad's words to him: \"Anyone who loves you is the 4 INTRODUCTION beloved of the Prophet, God's blessing and peace on him, and he will not die until he becomes a saint.\" For followers of the Tijaniyya, the rank of their shaykh was thus a medium to actualize the Prophet’s own invitation to get closer to God. The Eighteenth-Century Islamic World The Tijaniyya emerged at the end of the intellectually vibrant eighteenth century. New research on this period in the Muslim world concurs in over- turning an earlier orientalist and Islamic modernist assumption of scholarly stagnation in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. “It was a period,” John Voll observes, “of major developments in key aspects of the Islamic tradition, providing both a culmination for the first millennium of Islamic history and the foundation for many dynamic aspects of Islam in the mod- ern world.” Ahmad Dallal makes a similar observation in his overview of Islamic intellectual history in the period: “The Islamic eighteenth century was a period of great intellectual vitality comparable in its scope, intensity, and quality to the cultural activities of the classical period. Intellectuals from virtually all the regions of the Muslim world systematically attempted to scrutinize the epistemological foundations of inherited knowledge and to reformulate the traditional Islamic disciplines of learning.” Such scru- tiny shares much, then, with an emphasis on “verification” (tahgīg) that Khaled El-Rouayheb locates in the seventeenth century,\" but which argu- ably blossomed as the eighteenth century progressed. Researchers have focused on different aspects of scholarly renewal: Voll on chains of prophetic narrations (hadith) and juristic interpretations (ijtihād), Dallal on juristic methodology (usa al-fiqh) and evaluation of hadith transmissions (usil al-hadith), and Rouayheb on theology (kalam) and Sufism, for example. Understandably, the exercise of tahqig employed different epistemological strategies for different intellectual disciplines: transmission (‘i/m al-naq!) for hadith and jurisprudence (figh), rational proof (\"Im al-'agl) for theology and legal methodology, and experien- tial witnessing (kashf, ma‘rifa) for the spiritual realities referenced in Sufism.’ Verifying transmitted knowledge prioritized the search for al- ternative sources of narrations, authenticating existing hadith literatures through the “science of transmitters\" (\"ilm al-rijal), and the acquisition of the shortest possible chain of knowledge transmission (sanad) from li- censed scholars.'° Verifying theological premises or legal theory required The Tijāniyya and the Verification of Islamic Knowledge 5 \"rational demonstration\" and the ability to \"critically assess received views,” most particularly, for Dallal, through a “consistent historiciza- tion” of legal thought: the eighteenth-century scholar’s observation of the inherited intellectual tradition’s ability to respond to historically diverse circumstances, but also the necessity for contextualizing received opin- ions in their own time and place.\" Verifying spiritual realities required the direct experience of the unseen: “In a Sufi context, ‘verification’ typically denoted the mystical-experiential authentication of the truths to which ordinary believers—including exoteric theologians—abstractly assent.” This overview does not mean to collapse significant distinctions be- tween studies of the eighteenth century. Researchers have disagreed most notably on how widely ideas were shared, and whether or not global schol- arly exchanges have any relevance in understanding the local formulation and reception of diverse scholars. Even so, such differences can risk exag- geration. According to John Voll, “these connections [between scholars] can be overstated as well as underestimated, and it is important to set a balance. The eighteenth century Muslim world was . . . [not] composed of totally separate and isolated parts.” Elsewhere, Voll adds, “there is enough interaction among revivalists in the eighteenth century” to con- clude that “revivalist movements . . . did not emerge in isolation.”*! Ahmad Dallal’s emphasis on understanding local and regional contexts over global exchanges, while critical of Voll’s work on networks, nonetheless concedes, “none of these movements was totally detached from outside intellectual currents of the Muslim world.”” The foundation of the Tijaniyya is a key case study, only superficially referenced in earlier research on eighteenth-century intellectual history, that emphasizes the importance of verification or realization of knowledge. It also suggests both the significance of global scholarly exchanges and the importance of regional historical context in understanding the reception of eighteenth-century Islamic scholarship. Ahmad al-Tijani traveled through- out North Africa and the Middle East and had meaningful connections with Arab, Kurdish, and Indian scholars in Egypt and the Hijaz. But clearly, his teachings responded to regional historical developments in Algeria and Morocco in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The spread of the Tyaniyya during his life and around the world today may have much to do with al-Tijānī's ability to make the inherited intellectual tradition speak to a perceived new historical era of unprecedented corruption. The emphasis on realization or authentication provides a useful lens through 6 INTRODUCTION which to understand scholarly exchange, local context, and perception of historical specificity at the foundation of the Tijāniyya. Al-Tijānī in fact emphasized the same aforementioned tahgīg in all three epistemological strategies—transmission, rational proof, and spiritual experience—in pro- moting Islamic religious revival. Even if Sufism remained, for al-Tijani as for al-Ghazali, the privileged method of verifying the truth of religion, the foundational sources ofthe Tijaniyya give important insight into the ways in which the disciplines of hadith, legal theory, theology, and Sufism interfaced and mutually supported one another in eighteenth-century scholarship. The Tarīga Muhammadiyya As suggested above, al-Tijanr's notion of the “Muhammadan Way” was useful in focusing Islamic learning on individual religious realization. For the shaykh, the Tarīga Muhammadiyya was the Prophet's own chosen path for the actualization of divine knowledge. Such external and internal emulation of the Prophet necessitated both the learning of the Prophet's transmitted behavior (Sunna) and the emulation of his spiritual state in the presence of God. The Tijānī Sufi path thus presupposed a degree of legal and theological knowledge, though it certainly accentuated the meth- odology of the self’s purification in order to experience unseen realities. In this, the Tyaniyya was no different than most Sufi orders. Indeed, the Tijaniyya's most visible distinguishing characteristic—the waking encoun- ter with the Prophet and the claim to Seal of Sainthood—do not result from any ideological or practical innovation. Al-Tyant perceived his own “Muhammadan Way” as nothing new, only the ultimate fulfillment of Su- fism’s promise to connect the worshipper to God. But Rtidiger Seesemann’s analysis of nineteenth-century Tiani literature is instructive here: “even if the ‘old-hat-argument’ holds true, we still need to consider the possibility that the same idea (or text) can assume a different meaning or relevance in a different context.” Al-Tijānī was not the first to employ the terminology of the Tarīga Muhammadiyya, nor was he the first to claim the waking vision of the Prophet or the Seal of Muhammadan sainthood. While the proliferation of self-proclaimed 7ariqa Muhammadiyya movements in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries certainly suggests shared influences, there is little shared coherence to the term to indicate a globally transmitted *Muham- madan Way\" in the period. Discussion of shared influences and global The Tijāniyya and the Verification of Islamic Knowledge 7 intellectual currents invoking the concept is useful to understand the con- text and later reception of the Tijaniyya, particularly in Africa. But there is nothing in Tijant primary sources to substantiate the notion that the Tyaniyya was part of a global “movement” or network of Tarīga Muham- madiyya scholars visibly distinct from the larger Sufi tradition. Nonethe- less, the Tijāniyya drew on the intellectual resources of eighteenth-century thought—themselves the crystallization of earlier ideas—and offered its own version of the Tarīga Muhammadiyya as having particular relevance to Muslims of the period. Ahmad al-Tijānī (1737—1815) and the Tijāniyya Ahmad b. Mahammad b. Mukhtar al-Tijānī al-Hasani** was born in the southwestern Algerian oasis of ‘Ayn Madi and traveled throughout North Africa and the Hijaz before taking up permanent residence in Fez, Mo- rocco, in 1798. Before leaving ‘Ayn Madi at age twenty-one, he completed the standard curriculum of Qur’an memorization and study of jurispru- dence, theology, prophetic traditions, Qur'an exegesis, and Arabic litera- ture. His travels in search of further knowledge (mostly prophetic narra- tions and Sufi training), led him to stays in several North African centers of knowledge, such as Fez, Tlemcen, Tuwat, and Tunis. During these years, he received initiation into various branches of the Shadhiliyya, the Qadiriyya, and the Khalwatiyya. He accomplished the pilgrimage to Mecca in 1774. During this trip, he received initiations from prominent Khalwatt shaykhs Mahmūd al-Kurdī (d. 1780) in Cairo and Muhammad al-Samman (d. 1775) in Medina, as well as an Indian Sufi, likely of the Naqshbandiyya, Ahmad al-Hindi (d. 1774) in Mecca. His combination of Islamic learning and Sufi knowledge eventually distinguished him as \"one of the greatest imams of his time,” according to Tijānī sources.” While making spiritual retreat (k^alwa) in the Algerian town of Abii Samghün in 1781—82, he experienced his first waking encounter with the Prophet Muhammad. AI-Tijani reported that the Prophet told him to leave aside his previous Sufi initiations and gave him the distinctive litany (wird) of the Tijaniyya Sufi path.”° The claimed direct involvement of the Prophet Muhammad in the establishment of the Tyaniyya, as well as the disciple’s constant visualization of the Prophet’s enduring spiritual presence, meant that followers of the Tyaniyya considered the Prophet Muhammad to be the ultimate Sufi shaykh of their “Muhammadan way.” 8 INTRODUCTION Upon his final establishment in Fez, al-Tijani joined Sultan Mawlay Su- layman's council of scholars and initiated several prominent Moroccan figures into the Tyaniyya, such as the jurist and theologian Hamdin b. al- Hajj, several government ministers, and perhaps even the sultan himself. The most comprehensive biographical dictionary of Moroccan scholars re- lating to the period, Muhammad al-Kattani’s Sal/wat al-anfas, describes al- Tijani as “the grounded gnostic,” “the rope of the Sunna and the religion,” and the “comprehensive saintly pole” before continuing: “He was among the scholars who put his knowledge into action, the imams of independent scholarly opinion (al-a`imma al-mujtahidīn), among those who combined the nobility of origin with the nobility of the religion, the nobility of knowl- edge, action, certainty, divine spiritual states (ahwa/) and lofty saintly sta- tions (maqamat).\"\" Such descriptions, although not uncontested, suggest al-Tijani's reception among elements of both general and elite audiences. A number of Moroccan sultans have since maintained close relations with the Tijāniyya, most recently funding the restoration of al-Tijanr's final burial place and main lodge (zawiya) ofthe Tijaniyya in Fez, as well as al-Tijani's original house in the city, the “House of Mirrors,” that Mawlay Sulayman gifted to al-Tyani upon his arrival in Fez. The Tyaniyya first spread primarily in North and West Africa. By the early twentieth century, it had become the most popular Sufi order in Mo- rocco.?* By the nineteenth century, it had made significant inroads among established clerical lineages of Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, and Nigeria; and by the mid-twentieth century, under the leadership of the Tijānī reviv- alist Ibrahim Niasse (d. 1975, Senegal), had displaced the Qadiriyya as the dominant Sufi order in West Africa.” It is today found all over the Muslim world and beyond, with notable Tijani communities (besides North and West Africa) in Indonesia, Singapore, India, Turkey, Palestine, Arab Gulf states, Egypt, Europe, and North and South America.? If the Tyaniyya has become one of the Islamic world’s most popular Sufi orders, it is certainly a testimony to the success of eighteenth-century Islamic scholarly revival. The lack of serious academic consideration of the Tijāniyya in historical overviews of Sufism, or its place in eighteenth- century revivalism, is an astounding oversight in both fields. In elaborating the notion of the “Hidden Pole” (al-gutb al-maktūm), the Tijānī tradition seemed unconcerned by such opacity: “The secret with me,” al-Tijānī said, “is locked in a house whose doors are shut and whose key has been lost.’””! But full understanding of the shaykh’s secret knowledge is not necessary The Tijāniyya and the Verification of Islamic Knowledge 9 to appreciate the rapid spread of the order and the dynamic intellectual production it inspired. Literature and Sources on the Tijāniyya Generalist studies of Sufism or of eighteenth-century intellectual his- tory have undoubtedly been limited by incomplete or problematic prior research on the Tijāniyya. The primary English monograph on the Ti- janiyya, Jamil Abun-Nasr's The Tijaniyya: A Sufi Order in the Modern World (1965), framed an otherwise notable exposition of primary source material with an uncritical belief in the inevitable “demystification” of the modern world. For Abun-Nasr, the Tijāniyya was an example of Sufism's incompatibility with modern, postcolonial Muslim rationalized sensibil- ities. “Their story is,” Abun-Nasr noted in accusing the Sufi orders and the Tijaniyya in particular with colonial collaboration, “that of adjustment and reconciliation, which would have enabled them to survive politically had it not been that the doctrines which they preached and the functions which they performed were no longer suited to modern times.”” Themes of colonial collaboration, political posturing, and intellectual irrelevance remained consistent refrains for subsequent mentions of the Tyaniyya, as they did for African Sufi communities more broadly. A later introduction to a series of conference papers on the Tijaniyya remarks on the order's “theological arrogance” and its “long ‘concubinage’ with French colonial power” permitting it to become “one of the greatest beneficiaries of the colonial period.” And unlike other orders, the Tyaniyya “remains exclu- sively African—this is another one of its characteristics.”** Generations of later scholarship thus appear to have remained beholden to Abun-Nasr’s reading of the Tijāniyya. My 2003 master’s thesis, “On the Path of the Prophet: Shaykh Ahmad Tijani and the Tariqa Muhammadiyya,” was later published (2005) without peer review. It hoped to recontextualize Tijani primary source material within the intellectual history of the eighteenth century. The work stands, I believe, as a useful introduction to the Tijaniyya, but is limited by a surface-level reading of primary source material and an exaggeration of the Tarīga Muhammadiyya as an intellectually coherent scholarly network. In any case, the book has received some academic attention, with two reprints and a French translation reflecting its apparent usefulness to non-academic audiences and the undergraduate classroom.*4 IO INTRODUCTION The only other published academic monograph to narrate the history of the Tijaniyya (in a European language?) is Jilali El Adnani's La Tijāniyya, 1781—1861.5 While Adnani recognizes the significance of the Tijaniyya in the modern history of Morocco, his utilitarian focus on shaykh-disciple relationships at the foundation of the order reduces Sufi affiliation to a form of false consciousness. Like Abun-Nasr, Adnani's citation of primary source material focuses on provocative statements to substantiate an ap- parent narrative of Tijani heterodoxy, failing to balance such citations with others that might allow him to read these statements differently. Adnani thus concludes, \"the rehabilitation of Ahmad al-Tijānī resided in the rein- forcement of his superior rank over his disciples, something impossible without recourse to miracles and magic . . . testimony to a strategy destined for the masses, which was much more receptive to invisible actors than to Sufi erudition.”*” Alexander Knysh has usefully bracketed such under- standings of Sufi communities based on crude power dynamics: “ ‘Power’ is too general a concept to account for construction, justification, and performance by Sufi masters of their claims to knowledge and guidance across centuries. Commanding respect and awe, being listened to in silence by a captive and respectful audience without necessarily ‘dominating’ or ‘exploiting’ it, is a motivation that does not fit neatly into the narrowly conceived grid of power relations envisioned by neo-Marxian sociologists of various stripes? Knysh concludes that such an understanding “fails to do justice to the complexity of human aspirations.\" Abun-Nasr's and Adnani’s apparent reduction of the religious identities of millions of Tijānī adherents may fit various instrumentalist understandings of the Tyaniyya’s social and political role in Africa from the nineteenth century, but their dis- missal of the intellectual contributions of al-Tyani and his early disciples has left a void in more general overviews of Sufi thought and history. This tendency to selectively ignore formative teachings from primary sources, in preference for decontextualized controversial statements, necessitates a more balanced narration of one of the Islamic world’s most important Sufi orders. It must be admitted, however, that the works of Abun-Nasr and Ad- nani provide a window into intriguing polemical debates surround- ing Sufi doctrine and practice in modern contexts. Some of these debates—such as the implications of seeing the Prophet—appear specific to the Tyaniyya, but most are more general to Sufism (the hier- archy of saints or the power of Sufi prayers, for example) and perhaps to The Tijāniyya and the Verification of Islamic Knowledge II \"traditional Islam” broadly defined (the authority of scholars, the enduring spirit of the Prophet beyond the grave, or the present-essence of God, for example). Full exploration of such polemics, and the voluminous literature they have produced, deserve a separate and more focused inquiry that is beyond the scope of this work. However, I hope that the disciplined situa- tion ofthe Tijaniyya's emergence in eighteenth-century Islamic intellectual history can provide a more stable foundation for such further explorations. In addition to the problematic decontextualization of primary sources in earlier academic accounts, a new history of the Tijāniyya is also warranted from the perspective of newly available or edited Arabic source material. While Ahmad al-Tijānī, like many Sufi shaykhs, left few writings himself, there are a number of central primary sources written or collected by his disciples. Foremost among them is the “Pearls of Meanings and Obtainment of Hopes in the Spiritual Floods of Sayyidi Abü l- Abbas Ahmad al-Tijanr\" (hereafter referenced as Jawahir al-maānī) written by al-Tijani's closest disciple, Alī Harāzim al-Barrāda (or al-Barāda, d. 1804), and completed in 1798. The work contains al-Tijanr's biography, his interpretations of var- ious Qur'àn verses and sayings of the Prophet, and responses to a variety of questions from disciples. In writing the book, Harazim recycled short, formulaic sections from an earlier Moroccan Sufi text, Abd al-Salam b. al-Tayyib al-Qadirr's (d. 1699), Kitab al-maqsad al-Ahmad, concerning the seventeenth-century Shadhili saint Ahmad b. Abdallah Man al-Andalūsī (d. 1708).? While Abun-Nasr concludes that the fact that Harazim “drew heavily\" on this earlier text constitutes an \"act of plagiarism,\"\" close com- parison between published versions of the Jawahir al-maānī and the 1932 publication of Kitab al-maqsad reveal that Harazim borrowed roughly 2.5 pages of al-Maqsad's formulaic introduction: a few of the introductory paragraphs, and a few of the poems probably themselves recycled from past writings.” Considering the roughly 680 pages of the 2011 publication of the Jawahir, this borrowing (03 percent) hardly qualified as plagiarism by the standards of the classical Arabic textual tradition,? but it nonethe- less became part of a Salafi-inspired attack against the Tijaniyya in early twentieth-century Morocco. In any case, the Jawahir al-maānī has en- joyed unrivaled authority in the Tijāniyya, due to Harazim’s designation as al-Tijanr's \"greatest deputy\" (al-khalifa al-a'zam) and on account of the Prophet's appearance to al-Tijani to order the book's compilation: \"Pre- serve it,\" Harazim records the Prophet's words to al-Tijant, “in order to benefit the saints after you\"? Elsewhere, al-Tijant was reported as saying, I2 INTRODUCTION “The Prophet ordered me to collect the Jawahir al-ma' àni, and he told me, ‘This is my book,and it is I who authored it””** There are significant divergences among published copies of the Jawahir al-ma ani, and some Tijani scholars claimed that earlier publications dat- ing to the beginning of the twentieth century departed from the origi- nal manuscript.” But the claim of interpolation is difficult to substanti- ate: divergent publications appear to be primarily the result of various manuscript versions penned by ‘Alt Harazim himself, or prominent early Tijant scholars from Harazim's work. The Moroccan Tijani scholar Radi Kanūn's 2012 republication of the Jawahir al-maani identified no fewer than four original manuscripts of the text in Harazim’s handwriting: one held in ‘Ayn Madi, two located in Tlemcen (Algeria), and one found in Kaolack, Senegal.** This latter version had already been published in 2011 by the Senegalese shaykh Tijānī b. ‘Alī Cissé, based on the manuscript his grandfather Ibrāhīm Niasse had obtained from his father Abdallāh Niasse, who was gifted the copy in Fez in I911 by al-Tijānī's descendant Bashīr b. Muhammad b. Ahmad al-Tijani.? While Kanūn privileges the ‘Ayn Madi manuscript as the “mother” text, the “Kaolack” manuscript arguably de- serves precedent recognition: this was the copy kept in al-Tijānī's posses- sion, from which he read, for the last sixteen years of his life.? The initial page contains al-Tijanr's handwritten testimony: “Everything written in this manuscript (al-kunndsh), each letter appearing from the beginning to the end, I have authorized.”*! While Kaniin’s recent publication presents a useful comparison between various versions of the Jawāhir, the amalgam- ated text he published does not reproduce any one version of a manuscript original.” For these reasons, I primarily rely on Cissé’s 2011 edition from the original Jawāhir al-ma ānī kept in al-Tijānī's possession during his life for all citations. Another disciple, Muhammad b. al-Mashrī (or Mishrī) al-Sā ihī (d. 1809), left two separate collections of al-Tijānī's teachings that re- mained unpublished until 2012. The first is “The Garden of the Annihi- lated Lover in what has been transmitted from our Shaykh Abi |-‘Abbas al-Tijant” (hereafter Rawd al-muhibb), written around 1792.? The second is “The Collection of the Pearls of Knowledge overflowing from the Seas of the Hidden Pole” (hereafter al-Jami `), completed in 1804 It is clear Harazim and Ibn al-Mashri shared notes between them, for much of the three books contain similar passages and sometimes share organizational features. However, Ibn al-Mashri’s texts add much to our understanding The Tijāniyya and the Verification of Islamic Knowledge I3 of al-Tijanr's intellectual contributions beyond the Harazim's Jawahir al- ma àni, particularly in regard to theology and jurisprudence. To prove the point that Ibn al-Mashrī's writing contained value in its own right, a later Tijānī scholar published a separate book collecting everything from the Jami‘ not contained in the Jawahir.* Primary sources written by direct disciples of al-Tijant also include a collection of the shaykh’s sayings, collected by the scholarly disciple al- Tayyib al-Sufyant (d. 1843, Fez), “The Ahmadan Blessing for the Aspirant of Eternal Happiness\" (hereafter al-/fada al-Ahmadiyya), and gathered shortly after the shaykh's passing in 1815.7 There is also the “Book of Di- vine Guidance” (Kitab al-irshadat al-rabbaniyya), al-Tijani’s commen- tary on al-Busayrr's (d. 1294, Alexandria) poem in praise of the Prophet (al-Hamziyya) dictated to ‘Alt Harazim.? The significant collections of the Moroccan Tijānī scholar Ahmad Sukayrij (d. 1944) detailing the biog- raphies of al-Tijānī's students should also be considered as foundational primary sources. Sukayrij’s “Removal of the Shroud” (Kashf al-hijaby* and his expanded “Raising the Veil” (Raf' al-nigāb)*? include rare source material, such as letters between al-Tijānī and various disciples, treatises, poetry, and prayers composed by the shaykh's students, and meticulously researched oral narrations concerning al-Tijanr's relationship with his com- munity of students. A later descendant of al-Tijani collected all of his an- cestor's letters found in various other collections and published a separate volume, the “Selected Letters” (Mukhtàrat min rasa il al-shaykh), that also serves as a useful primary source. Other later Tijani scholars published Arabic source materials that played important roles in the explanation and spread of the Tijaniyya. Some of these sources that inform this book include the “Lances of the Party of the Merciful” (Rimāh) of the nineteenth-century West African Umar Fūtī (Tal),*! the “Fulfillment of Beneficience” (Bughyat al-Mustafid) of the nineteenth-century Moroccan scholar al-‘Arabr b. al-Sa’ih,” and the “Re- moval of Confusion” (Kashif al-ilbds) of Ibrahim Niasse.® While these varied published sources were certainly written with different audiences and historical contexts in mind, they nonetheless form an impressive trove of information from which to reconstruct the intellectual history of the early Tijāniyya. Many years of field research have afforded access to other manuscript sources still unpublished and unknown to previous academic research. The most notable is a forty-nine-page untitled “travel notebook” (hereafter I4 INTRODUCTION referred to as Kunnāsh al-rihla) written in al-Tijānī's own handwriting* The work collects various prayers al-Tijānī received from scholars he vis- ited while traveling in North Africa and Arabia. The date of this compila- tion is unknown, but it appears from most of the scholars mentioned that it was written during his pilgrimage east in the years 1773 and 1774, or shortly thereafter upon his return to the Maghreb. A second important manuscript is the Mashahid (“spiritual encounters\") of 'Ali Harazim, a 212-page ac- count detailing Harazim's own spiritual training and experiences at the direction of al-Tijani, written in 1799 or 1800, soon after the completion of the Jawáhir al-ma'ani? Other various notebooks of secrets” (sing. Kun- nash) attributed to al-Tiyani, to which the contemporary Senegalese shaykh Tijani Cissé granted me access in his personal archive,** also inform my understanding of al-Tyant’s scholarly influences and breadth of knowledge, especially in the field of esotericism. There are a few Arabic sources, external to the Tyaniyya, that tan- gentially reference al-Tijānī and the early Tijaniyya, most notably Abū l- Qasim al-Zayant’s (d. 1833) al-Tarjumana al-kubra, Ahmad al-Nasiri’s (d. 1897) al-Istigsā li-akhbār duwal al-Maghrib al-agsā (completed 1894), and Muhammad Ja'far al-Kattānī's (d. 1927) Salwat al-anfas (completed 1887). I make reference to these external perspectives, but the fact is that external sources on the Tijaniyya are simply too sparse to rely on to the same de- gree as internal sources. The false equivalence between the secondhand, often contradictory reports in external sources, and firsthand internal nar- ratives—the historical value of which can be too easily dismissed as imag- ined hagiography—is an oversight, I believe, that has limited prior research on the Tyaniyya. This question of historiography is sometimes addressed by Sufi communities themselves, notably by Ibrahim Niasse in his first en- counter with a French historian. Niasse said, “I heard you mentioned me in your book. I have also written many books, but I never mentioned you. Do you know why? Because I do not know you.” Of course, external narra- tives are indispensable; the point is simply that internal accounts cannot be immediately dismissed as providing unreliable historical data. Just as Ibn Khaldün's observations of Muslim societies cannot be discounted simply because he was a practicing Muslim, so too must historians take seriously the internal narratives of Sufi communities despite the fact their authors were practicing Sufis. Alternately, clearly defined genres of Sufi writing— such as hagiography, advice on etiquette or spiritual training, and prayer manuals—certainly have audiences other than critical historians in mind. The Tijāniyya and the Verification of Islamic Knowledge I5 Nonetheless, several internal sources clearly cross disciplinary boundar- les: the multivolume biographical dictionaries of Ahmad Sukayrij, for ex- ample, contain critically researched oral traditions cross-referenced with alternative narrations and textual references. This book situates internal sources within the context of externally established historical narratives but focuses more on exploring the process of religious realization captured in internal sources, than it does on reconciling or disproving every external fragment. This is a story of religious identity in historical context; I make no claim to writing the definitive history of the Tijaniyya. The spread of the Tyaniyya, particularly in vibrant scholarly contexts of nineteenth-and twentieth-century Mauritania, Mali, Senegal, and Nige- ria, produced a veritable explosion of Arabic literature.” Full analysis of this literature,\" which includes treatises, letters, and poetry both for and against the Tyaniyya, is not attempted in this book. Nonetheless, this lit- erary production, including the controversies it preserves, should be more systemically considered in accounting for the later spread of the Tijaniyya. Charismatic Sufi authority, as Rüdiger Seesemann observes in the later Tijanr community of Ibrahim Niasse, sometimes consciously risked pub- lic censure to provide spiritual realization to greater numbers of people. *His most important task consisted of finding a balance between attracting followers and controlling their experiences. The internal sources leave no doubt that he [Niasse] was up to the task, but apparently not all of the deputies were. Yet if some ofthe latter were less successful in walking the tightrope between captivating the followers and curbing their enthusiasm and talkativeness, the resulting attacks of the deniers helped to reinforce the cohesion of the community. This very mechanism eventually drove the large-scale expansion.”” Such controversies arguably played a role in the expansion of the Tijāniyya from its foundation. But as I argued in relation to the community of Ibrahim Niasse,” I believe that polemics surrounding the teachings of al-Tijani are the later reflection of an underlying appeal, not the generative mechanism for spread of the Tijaniyya by themselves. Lia- bilities of the polemical frame include an ahistorical reading of later polem- ics into the foundational sources, or an overemphasis of polemical sources, most often marginal to lived experiences of most disciples, to the exclusion of more central preoccupations. This book thus concerns the ideal of reli- gious actualization that attracted disciples to al-Tijani in a late eighteenth- century North African context and leaves the (mostly) later controversies that this ideal produced, or failed to produce, to other researchers. 16 INTRODUCTION Structure of the Book This work begins with situating the emergence of the Tijāniyya in a broader eighteenth-century intellectual context. While I hope to avoid generalizing across divergent local contexts and scholarly articulations, much of Ahmad al-Tijānī's teachings clearly responded to currents of global exchange in the Muslim world. Topics such as independent scholarly reasoning (ijtihad), the verification of divine oneness (tawhid), or the Sufi's privileged con- nection to the Prophet were all ideas in wide circulation, even if scholars had different understandings of these ideas. This chapter summarizes new research on the eighteenth-century Muslim world, but I also make direct recourse to the primary sources of this period, including the writings of seminal figures like Ibrahim al-Küranr, Mustafa al-Bakrī, Abd al-Ghani al-Nābulusī, Muhammad al-Sammān, and Mahmūd al-Kurdī. Discussions of eighteenth-century intellectual history freguently privilege the Middle East and India, with only marginal reference to North or West Africa. Here I consider intellectual developments in North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and India as all playing a role in the shared scholarly dis- courses that informed the emergence of the Tijāniyya. The second chapter considers Ahmad al-Tijānī's formation as a Muslim scholar in eighteenth-century Algeria and Morocco. While al-Tijani was of course primarily remembered as a Sufi, his scholarship was imprinted by a long engagement with the broader scholarly tradition, including Qur'an and hadith study, Islamic law, theology, and esotericism or “talismanic sciences.\" Sources for this discussion include the core primary sources of the Tijaniyya, but read from the perspective of specific Islamic disciplinary specialization. I also consider al-Tijanr's opinions on esotericism from the vantage point of previously unavailable manuscript sources. Chapter 3 returns more explicitly to the notion of actualization or tahgīg, but this time with a pronounced emphasis on the realization of humanity (tahqiq al-insaniyya). 1 argue that the reflection on the human condition evident in primary sources of the Tijaniyya is what informed conceptions of witnessing the unseen world, particularly the experience of seeing the Prophet Muhammad. Perhaps most significant, this actualization of human potentiality was not restricted to the shaykh alone but included his disciples in sometimes surprising ways. In chapter 4, I take up the challenge of understanding Ahmad al-Tijani's claims to spiritual authority and the asserted preeminence ofthe Tijaniyya The Tijāniyya and the Verification of Islamic Knowledge 17 over other Sufi orders. As reflected in primary sources themselves, these claims raised difficult questions in al-Tijanr's early community: did the shaykh mean to confirm or to abrogate the earlier Sufi tradition? How could disciples be warned against spiritual complacency while being assured of the new order's ascendant value? Such dynamic tensions deserve balanced analysis to comprehend the reception and continued meaning the Tijaniyya has had for millions of Muslims. The final chapter considers the question of historical context in both practical and philosophical terms. Ahmad al-Tyani, like many others in the late eighteenth century, perceived his time as being one of unprecedented sinfulness and corruption. The Tyaniyya was thus conceived as a cure for the ailing Muslim community, giving hope to those who had despaired of obtaining divine grace in such a time. Not surprising, such an under- standing has had heightened meaning for subsequent generations of Tyani adherents, who perhaps cannot help but observe increased corruption and an enduring need for God’s bountiful grace in their own diverse historical contexts. The conclusion reflects on the remarkable spread of the Tijaniyya as a testimony to the intellectual vibrancy of the eighteenth century. CHAPTER ONE Sufism and Islamic Intellectual Developments in the Eighteenth Century HE IDEAS THAT BECAME CENTRAL to the Tijāniyya had wide cur- rency in the Muslim world by the late eighteenth century. Such ideas were sometimes sourced in texts, but more often they were transmitted through personal investiture, accompanied by texts or without. Itis no accident, then, to find al-Tijani personally connected to those whose ideas were later integrated in the Tijāniyya. This is not to suggest a static continuity between teachers and students across generations and vast geo- graphical space. But it does suggest that personal connections cannot be ignored in the sharing of ideas between scholars. The eighteenth century represented the culmination of centuries of Is- lamic scholarly prestige in the Muslim world. Later generations witnessed the rise of the modern state and its confiscation of the endowments (awqaf) that gave financial independence to the scholarly class and the promotion of Western-influenced schooling that created new intellectuals who dis- placed traditional scholars as teachers, writers, and bureaucrats. But before this state-centric (and often colonially inspired) modernization, scholars confidently asserted their ascendant rank over sultans in best ensuring the Islamic authenticity of their societies. “In Muslim society vox ‘ulama’ is legally vox dei,” wrote an historian of eighteenth-century Egypt, “and prac- tically vox populi for they had it in their power to rouse or placate public opinion.\"! Global scholarly exchange gave intellectuals the opportunity to hear new ideas, access new textual sources, and invest themselves with “heightened” (shorter) chains of knowledge transmission. These events usually occurred when individuals accomplished their pilgrimage rites in the Hijaz, often stopping in other scholarly centers, such as Cairo, along the way. It may be IS Sufism and Islamic Intellectual Developments in the Eighteenth Century 19 true that the culmination of such activities in the eighteenth century even- tually caused regional scholarship to assert its sufficiency from continued travels in search of knowledge.’ But it is also true that global scholarly exchange after the eighteenth century was limited by European colonial occupation: non-Muslim authorities generally began to restrict and surveil the travels of Muslim scholars even during the pilgrimage season.* Global networks of Muslim scholars were well established on the eve of colonial conquest, and intellectual exchanges figured prominently in the biogra- phies of scholars written during the period even if such exchanges were less pronounced in later generations. It was primarily the desire for verification (tahqiq) that motivated the intellectual vibrancy of the eighteenth century. Verification or religious ac- tualization took on different meanings depending on the field of knowledge involved, whether jurisprudence (figh), theology ('aqida, ‘ilm al-kalam), or Sufism (tasawwuf).* In Islamic law, tahgīg meant ascertaining the re- lationship between a definitive sacred text (nass)—usually a saying of the Prophet (hadith)—and a scholarly opinion (jtihad) from the schools of law (madhhab, pl. madhāhib). Much has been made about transmission of hadīth and calls for ijtihād in the period, but these can arguably be catego- rized as renewed discussions of legal theory (usül).? In theological terms, tahqiq meant the verification of God's oneness (tawhid) and the eradication of hidden idolatry (shirk al-khafī). Of course, the “Muhammadan” Sufis of the eighteenth century had different under- standings of this process than did the nascent “Wahhabi” movement of central Arabia: namely the purification of the heart from other than God in order to experience tawhīd, versus a form of Protestant-style confes- sionalism. But the shared intention to cleanse the belief of Muslims is undeniable in eighteenth-century scholarly networks, and theology was a primary preoccupation of most of the era's scholars. The tahgīg of Sufism meant the endeavor to connect Sufi practices and understandings with the spiritual path of the Prophet (Tariqa Muhammad- iyya). Even the followers of Muhammad b. ‘Abd al-Wahhab were quick to assert that they never suggested this purified Sufism was blameworthy or that they denied the miracles of the saints,’ and Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab insisted in his letters, “I know of nothing that makes a person closer to God than the spiritual path (fariqa) of God's Messenger\"? Once again, the students of the eighteenth-century scholarly networks shared similar aspi- rations, even if the understanding of the *Muhammadan Sufism\" or Tariqa 20 CHAPTER ONE Muhammadiyya diverged sharply between mainstream scholarly Sufism of the time and radical outliers. Ahmad al-Tijānī's own interjections in the verification of legal opin- ions, theology, and Sufism comprise later chapters of this book. But here itis useful to outline the knowledge circulation within eighteenth-century scholarly networks, particularly as they related to al-Tijānī. Such superficial descriptions are suggestive at best, and no one book, whatever its preten- sion, can delve into the intellectual content of all eighteenth-century schol- ars with any meaningful depth. This chapter thus limits itself to discussing the teachings of al-Tijani's most significant scholarly contacts within these networks, and the broader spectrum of ideas out of which al-Tijanr's Tarīga Muhammadiyya emerged. Scholarly Networks Most, if not all, prominent eighteenth-century scholars were connected with each other through person-to-person chains of knowledge transmis- sion. This highly ritualized form of knowledge investiture and authoriza- tion, represented in the personalized ijaza/sanad/silsila model, emphasized the internalization of learning and the formation (or recognition) of exem- plary disposition.? However, students, especially those with a variety of learned influences, rarely reproduced the exact practice or doctrine of their teachers. Rather such networks shared a common discourse loosely based on verification through heightened connection to the Prophet. *Some think sharing a discourse means that people are part of a homogenous organi- zation. But a community of discourse is not an organization, and people within that community of discourse can disagree strongly even though they utilize the same discourse\"? With such caution in mind, the following summarizes the remarkable constellation of scholars who shared teacher-student relationships during the period. Our particular focus here is the situation of al-Tijānī within these networks, so these summaries are far from definitive. The particu- lar traditions with which al-Tijānī connected include: the “Muhammadan” Sufism of the North African Shadhili master Muhammad b. Nasir (d. 1674, Tamagrut, Morocco) and his student Hasan al-Yüsi (d. 1691, Marrakesh); the West African Shart'a-based, visionary Sufism emerging in scholarly centers such as Timbuktu by the sixteenth century; the Haramayn (Mecca and Medina) hadith and ijtihād transmitters emerging from the “school” of Sufism and Islamic Intellectual Developments in the Eighteenth Century 21 Ibrahim al-Kurani (d. 1693, Medina); the renewal of the Khalwatiyya Sufi order in Egypt under the leadership of the Damascene Mustafa al-Bakri (d. 1748, Cairo); and the Indian Shattariyya and Naqshbandiyya networks transmitting the teachings of Muhammad al-Ghawth (d. 1563, Ahmedabad). The Tijaniyya was an heir to all of these often-overlapping traditions. Its later global spread, especially in West Africa, reflects the resonance of the Tijaniyya with prior traditions as much as it does the unprecedented divine grace it claimed to transmit. Shadhilt Sufism in North Africa Of the several branches of the Shadhiliyya in North Africa, the Nasiriyya and Wazzaniyya both stand out for their similarity to the later emergence of the Tyaniyya. These branches, as opposed to the initially antinomian Darqawiyya,\" were distinguished by their good reputation in scholarly cir- cles for societal involvement and orthodoxy. Muhammad b. Nasir, who established his following as the Nāsiriyya in seventeenth-century south- ern Morocco, cautioned against extreme acts of renunciation as well as music and dance in Sufi practices, balancing an emphasis on “the Islamic sciences, respect for the Sunnah and scrupulous imitation of the Prophet’s example on the one hand, with initiation and mystical knowledge on the other.” He stressed the importance of having a spiritual guide to actualize one’s Muslim identity: “If you do not have a shaykh, Iblīs [Satan] must be near to you, and if Iblis is near to you, you are not a true Muslim.\"? The shaykh offered his own path as a remedy: “My path is easy, and the benefits large.” Later Nasiri followers would claim that initiation gave the aspi- rant salvation in the afterlife.^ For these reasons—and due to the order's success in facilitating trade—the Nasiriyya seems to have been the most popular Sufi order in North Africa by the late seventeenth century. Ibn Nāsir's close disciple, al-Hasan al-Yūsī, was arguably Morocco's most famous scholar of the seventeenth century. He advocated the scholar's active verification of Islam’s central theological doctrine of divine oneness (tawhid) to obtain certainty (yaqin), although methodologically he favored rational proofs according to the Ash arī theological school as opposed to the mystical experience of the “unity of being” (wahdat al-wujūd).* A1- Yüsr's treatment of the visionary experiences claimed by Sufis reflects a sober balance between the verification provided by such experiences and the fact that such experiences were themselves subject to verification. 22 CHAPTER ONE Al-Yüsi argued that, because saints were not immune to error, they could misinterpret spiritual unveilings. While waking visions were more reliable than dreams or states of spiritual intoxication, they could also be subject to delusion. A person should test his own visions, as well as what he hears from others, on the basis of their scholarship and character: *He should not be deluded by every prattler, nor think poorly of every Muslim. Such recondite matters can only be grasped by the intelligent and those blessed with guidance, and it all must be explained with the assistance and guid- ance of Exalted God.” True visions should be concealed to avoid causing discord, unless the vision could bring benefit to others or unless the vision- ary was ordered by his teacher to reveal the vision.\" The Nasiriyya thus came to be associated with a sober, shari a-compliant Sufism that rearticulated the importance of saintly authority and schol- arship in the verification of knowledge and spiritual states. By the late eighteenth century, the Nasiriyya remained a predominate religious force in North Africa and beyond. The Moroccan sultan Mawlay Sulayman (r. 1792—1822) was initiated into the order, and it became established within the circles of scholarly renewal in the Middle East, probably after the pilgrim- age east of Hasan al-Yüst in the late seventeenth century. The Indian scholar resident in Cairo, Murtada al-Zabidi (d. 1791), had been initiated into the order while studying hadith in Medina, Arabia, and would later pass knowl- edge authorizations to the head of the Nāsiriyya who visited him in Cairo.\" The Wazzaniyya was less known outside of Morocco,” but similar to the Nasiriyya, enjoyed good relations with the Moroccan political and schol- arly establishment. This branch of Shadhiliyya, founded by ‘Abdallah b. Ibrahim al-Idrist (d. 1678) in the northwestern Moroccan town of Wazzan, differed little from Shadhiliyya-Jazüliyya into which the Sharif ‘Abdallah had been initiated? As such, it emphasized the saint's role in social and soteriological intercession, the notion of the Sufi path as a “universalistic spiritual path in which the authority of the Sufi shaykh was based on an explicit analogy between the saint and the Prophet Muhammad,” and the paradigmatic sainthood of one who had become “the veritable personifi- cation of the Messenger of God.””! The early Jazüliyya also made specific reference to the notion of the Tariqa Muhammadiyya, although the associ- ation meant to emphasize the Sufi saint’s social obligations rather than the direct inspiration of his path from the Prophet.? ‘Abdallah al-Idrist him- self did not publicly teach his version of the Shadhiliyya until being given permission by the Prophet directly. Indeed, al-Idrist’s own Jazuli shaykh Sufism and Islamic Intellectual Developments in the Eighteenth Century 23 Alī Sarsī (d. 1628) had once declared, “If we are unable to visit him (the Prophet), he will come to us in our place.\"? The Jazuliyya's imprint on the Wazzaniyya was perhaps best reflected in the person of the third Wazzani shaykh Mawlay al-Tayyib (d. 1767), under whose leadership the town of Wazzan became an established center of religious learning and economic development, seeing the Wazzaniyya further spread throughout Morocco and Algeria.” Ahmad al-Tijani received initiation in both the Nasiriyya and Wazzani- yya during his travels to Morocco prior to the foundation of his own Tariqa Muhammadiyya. His earliest Sufi affiliation, “the first whom he met among the distinguished masters,” was Mawlay al-Tayyib of the Wazzaniyya, “the famous axial saint\" (al-qutb al-shahir), whom he visited in Wazzan on his way to Fez sometime around 1760.” Still in his early twenties, al-Tijant was apparently surprised to receive, along with initiation, an immediate authorization to initiate others (ijaza fi l-taqdim). His reaction was to “ab- stain” from practicing the order’s litanies “in order to work on (purifying) himself?\"* A disciple of al-Tijani later asked, ^Why did you leave his litany (wird) when he was one of God's saints (awliya')?\" Al-Tijant responded, “I did not (then) know the spiritual states (a/rwal) of the saints, and when I saw him in a (certain) state, I thought that a saint could not be in such (a state)?\" This is likely a reference to the reputed worldly wealth of the Wazzānī shaykhs by the eighteenth century.** Nonetheless, he would later attest to the high spiritual attainment of the Wazzani tradition, declaring that five Wazzani shaykhs had obtained axial or paradigmatic sainthood (gutbāniyya), including Mawlāy al-Tayyib.” Al-Tijānī took the litany (wird) of Ibn Nasir through Muhammad b. Ab- dallāh al-Tuzānī (d. 1778). Al-Tuzani, whose grave remains a site of pious visitation (ziyāra) in northeastern Morocco, had initiation through his fa- ther, from his uncle, from Ibn Nasir’s son Ahmad, with the uncle having a separate initiation in the Nasiriyya from Hasan al-Yust.*” Al-Tijānī did not practice the Nasiri wird long, but he continued to commend, consistent with Nasiri litanies, the recitation of al-Jazūlī's Dala il al-khayrat long after the establishment of the Tijaniyya.*' The legacy of the North African Shadhiliyya thus was clearly a significant background to the emergence of the Tyantyya. Although he claimed the ascendency of his Sufi path over the Shadhiliyya, al-Tijani encouraged the respect for past Shādhilī masters and continued to practice much of the devotional supplications of the Shadhiliyya.? 24 CHAPTER ONE Muhammadan Sufism and Scholarly Verification in Sub-Saharan Africa Aside from the Nasiriyya and the Wazzaniyya, another central influence on Moroccan Sufism in the eighteenth century was the teachings of 'Abd al- ‘Aziz al-Dabbagh (d. 1719, Fez), collected by his disciple in the widely cir- culated book “Pure Gold” (Dhahab al-ibriz).? Al-Dabbagh, whom al-Tijant referred to as the “axial saint” (qutb) of his time,” claimed to be in frequent visionary communication with the Prophet and emphasized the superior- ity of taking knowledge from the Prophet directly.” Although he never used the term 7ariqa Muhammadiyya himself, he transmitted his own Sufi path inspired in part by prayers given to him by the guide of Prophet Moses (Khidr), with the express purpose of joining with the presence of the Prophet Muhammad.?6 A formative influence on al-Dabbagh was a sub-Saharan African scholar named ‘Abdallah b. ‘Abd al-Jalil al-Burnawr, who appeared in Fez in order to train him to experience the waking vision of the Prophet Muhammad. Al-Burnawi then departed from him, saying: “O Sayyid ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, before today I was afraid for your sake. But today since God the Sublime, through his mercy, has united you with the lord of creation—God’s blessing and peace upon him—my heart feels safe and my mind is assured. I therefore leave you in the hands of God the mighty and glorious.\" Despite his departure from Fez, al-Dabbagh remained in spiritual contact with al-Burnawi after he returned to Bornu. Al-Dabbagh was spiritually informed of the day Burnawi died, saying, “When Sayyid ‘Abdallah al-Burnawi died, I inherited the secrets he possessed. This example points to the important role sub-Saharan African scholars played in the scholarly exchanges culminating in the eighteenth century. But there is much more to the story, in both the particulars of al-Burnawi here, and the general portrait of African Muslim scholarship in the pe- riod. While the /briz appears to subtly exoticize al-Burnawi's sudden ap- pearance (“behold there was a black man at the gate. He began to stare at me.\"?^), other sources, such as al-Kattani's Salwat al-anfās, give depth to al-Burnawr's scholarly background. Here, I follow Bobboyi’s sugges- tion that the al-Burnawi who appeared to al-Dabbagh was a post-mortem apparition of ‘Abdallah b. 'Abd al-Aziz al-Burnawi (d. 1677), who had established an influential Sufi community at the northern frontier of the Bornu empire. Soon after al-Dabbagh's al-Burnàwi left Fez, another of al-Burnāwī's more ordinary students appeared in the city: the traveling Sufism and Islamic Intellectual Developments in the Eighteenth Century 25 Sudanese-Yemeni scholar Ahmad al-Yamanī (d. 1712, Fez).*! Al-Yamanī, who had studied with al-Burnawi in the central-western African kingdom of Bornu before arriving in Fez, referred to his shaykh as \"the master of his time\" (sahib waqtihi) and the wonder of his age\"? Al-Burnawi, according to another contemporary account, Rihdn al-qulub, was sometimes in a state of spiritual ecstasy (majdhüb), but nonetheless the “pole of the Sufi way\" (qutb al-tariqa) who was in constant contact with the Angel Isrāfīl.** He was also an accomplished scholar of the exoteric sciences: he had knowl- edge of theology, Qur'an exegesis, and linguistics. He had a photographic memory, taught an Arabic grammatical work, the A/fiyya of Ibn Malik, and “gave commentary on the Qur'an like the exegesis of the great scholars.\" Al-Burnāwī claimed nonetheless that all his knowledge was a result of his friendship with God (walaya): *God does not make a saint (publicly) man- ifest, except that He supports him with knowledge.\"? Al-Burnàwi' por- trait thus emerges here in more detail than in the /briz. Taken as a whole, this African intellectual appeared in Fez as an eminent scholar-saint who emphasized the scholar's direct connection to the Prophet Muhammad, the importance of Sufi training under a shaykh, and the balance between Sufism and the sacred law. But al-Yamani had more to say about African scholarship than his tes- timony of al-Burnāwī. Al-Yamanī came to Fez from East Africa across the Sahel. According to Salwat al-anfas, “He spent a long time in the land of the blacks (bildd al-stidan).” Aside from al-Burnawi, he studied with other African scholars, such as Ahmad al-Tarikay (\"the Tuareg\"), from the town of Agades (Adkaz), allegedly of the Suhrawardiyya Sufi order.^* This is no doubt a reference to al-Yamani's contact with the legacy of the sixteenth-century West African scholar Sidi Mahmüd al-Baghdadi, another alleged \"axial saint\" of his age,\" who may have been the first to introduce a recognizable Sufi order in black Africa. According to H. T. Norris, the “Mahmidiyya” Sufi order was probably a combination of the Suhrawardi- yya and Khalwatiyya (and perhaps Qadiriyya) Sufi orders but came to be identified with “an original Muhammadiyya tariqa, a theory in vogue at a much later date.\" 5 Sidi Mahmüd's teachings were collected by a Tuareg scholar Ahmad b. Uways in the book a/-Qudwaá, written between 1670 and 1680. This author was undoubtedly the same Ahmad that served as al-Yamanr's teacher in Agades. Here is the Qudwa's description of the pre- eminent Tariqa Mahmüdiyya: 26 CHAPTER ONE The meaning of AA al-Tariqa al-Mahmüdiyya is \"those who call upon the people of Allah to a clarity of vision.\" A clarity of vision and of awareness is the gift which was brought by him [the Prophet]—the blessing and peace of Allah be upon him—to teach mankind about Allah. It was his sunna and the word of his Lord. As for the Tarīga of Sīdī Mahmūd, it is the original path and the other paths have borrowed from it. It is the way of the sons of the world to come, in canonic law, in mystical discipline, and in ultimate truth. All else is but the follow- ing of a wayward fancy.” Interesting here is the notion that the preeminent, “original” Sufi order would teach the knowledge of God as a gift from the Prophet in order to “clarify” or verify the religion of Islam. There is no specific mention that the Prophet Muhammad appeared to Sidi Mahmid to teach him the Tarīga Mahmüdiyya. But the Qudwa elsewhere asserts that Sidi Mahmüd claimed the Sufi circles of remembrance in the “western lands” (thus those of Sidi Mahmūd) were “organized and made ready by the Prophet.\" According to Norris, al-Yamanī likely brought a copy of the Oudwā with him to Fez after studying it in Agades.” If so, the idea of a transcendent Tariqa Muhammadi- yya that defined the purest form of Sufism, as a gift from the Prophet, had an earlier resonance in sub-Saharan Africa and may have influenced the idea’s popularization in Fez with ‘Abd al-Aziz al-Dabbagh andAhmad al-Tijānī.” Moreover, the Tarīga Mahmūdiyya was not the only sub-Saharan African-based Sufi order to make an appearance in Fez. There was later a muqaddam of the Kuntiyya-Qadiriyya from Mukhtar al-Kunti (d. 1811), a resident of Fez, a certain Sharif Muhammad b. al-Hadi al-Dabbagh (d. 1867).? Several of al-Kunti's students were active participants in the eighteenth-century scholarly circles, and al-Kunti himself corresponded with Murtada al-Zabīdī in Cairo.** Al-Kuntī's discussion of saintly mir- acles privileged the waking encounter with the Prophet Muhammad, and he claimed that the Algerian Qadiri Abd al-Karim al-Maghili (d. 1505, Tuwat), who allegedly brought the Qadiriyya to the Kunta people south of the Sahara, was in constant communication with the Prophet Muhammad. West African scholars thus clearly saw themselves as equal participants in the global scholarly exchanges ofthe eighteenth century, particularly when it came to the idea of the Tarīqa Muhammadiyya. The popularity of “Muhammadan Sufism” in West Africa is further sub- stantiated by analysis of the Timbuktu chronicles, which detail scholarly Sufism and Islamic Intellectual Developments in the Eighteenth Century 27 life in this key center of scholarship from the fifteenth century. Although these sources do not mention the presence of any Sufi order in West Africa prior to the eighteenth century, the strict Mālikī scholars described therein are frequently associated with Sufi gnosis (ma rifa), sainthood (walaya), and visionary encounters with the Prophet Muhammad. The renowned fifteenth-century scholar Yahya al-Tadillisi, whose mosque still stands in the center of Timbuktu,” was known as “the jurist and scholar, the qutb, the Friend of God Most High\"** who experienced nightly visions of the Prophet.” Of particular note is the Aqit lineage that provided Timbuktu’s most eminent scholars, such as Ahmad Baba (d. 1627). In the late sixteenth century, several Aqits had close relations with the Egyptian saint Muham- mad al-Bakri (d. 1585), the transmitter of seminal Tyani “Prayer of Open- ing” (salāt al-fātih). Al-Bakri attested to the sainthood of the Aqit scholars of his time,“ and both hosted these scholars in Egypt on their way to Mecca and visited them in Timbuktu.” Al-Bakrī's apparent role as a “spiritual mentor for the scholars of Tim- buktu\"* and his influence on the Tijaniyya suggest a degree of intellectual continuity between the Islamic scholarship of Western Africa and later reception of the Tijaniyya. Muhammad b. \"Alī al-Bakrī was a shaykh at Azhar University and one of the most renowned scholars of sixteenth- century Egypt. Al-Bakri was so named because his family claimed de- scent from the Prophet's companion Abü Bakr Siddiq. Al-Sha'rani referred to his contemporary al-Bakri as the “reviver” (mujaddid) of the sacred law and esteemed his famous collection of Sufi prayers, the hizb al-bakri. © Al-Sa'adī's Ta rīkh al-stidan describes al-Bakri in several places as “the friend of God” (wali-Allah) and the “axial saint” (qutb) of his time “who had great affection for the scholars of Timbuktu.’ Intellectually, al-Bakri emphasized the Sufi’s involvement in society, the study of the law from a variety of madhhab perspectives, and the possibility of direct spiritual unveiling, particularly in relationship to the spirituality of the Prophet. He was also interested in the writings of Ibn al-‘Arabi, although he dis- tanced himself from the external meaning of \"the unity of being” (wah- dat al-wujüd), suggesting, \"The unity is experiential, not ontological.\"6 Al-Bakrī's role in the unveiling of salat al-fatih is discussed later in this book, but the Tijāniyya’s popularization of al-Bakri's most valuable secret would have certainly made an impression on a West African scholarly leg- acy that had, at least in Timbuktu, earlier associated itself with al-Bakrr's reputation. 28 CHAPTER ONE African scholars had other subseguent contacts with Arab counterparts that played key roles in eighteenth-century intellectual exchange. A certain Ahmad Bābā (named after the more famous Ahmad Bābā al-Massūfī who died in 1627) from Timbuktu met the Syrian Nagshbandī Shaykh Abd al- Ghanī al-Nābulusī in Medina in 1694. At the Timbuktu scholar's request, al- Nabulusi composed a commentary on the versified rendition of al-Sanüsi's (d. 1490, Algeria) Agida al-sughra by the Timbuktu student of the original Ahmad Baba, Muhammad Baghri‘u.” The contact between Ahmad “al- Timbuktī” and Nabulusī is significant, as the latter's ideas on the Tarīga Muhammadiyya, transmitted through a book on the subject and his student Mustafa al-Bakri (d. 1749), helped define many eighteenth-century artic- ulations of the concept, including those of Mahmūd al-Kurdī, the later initiator of al-Tijānī in Cairo. Another African scholar, Muhammad al-Kashnawi, became well known in Egypt as the teacher of Hasan al-Jabarti, the father of the fa- mous Egyptian historian ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti. Al-Jabartr's formative Sufi shaykh was Mahmūd al-Kurdī. Al-Kashnāwī is mostly known for his authorship of an important treatise on the esoteric sciences: al-Durr al- manzüm wa khulāsat al-sirr al-maktūm fi l-sihr wa l-talasim wa l-nujüm.9 While certainly known as an esotericist in Egypt, he received comprehen- sive scholarly training in central west Africa before leaving Katsina around 1730. Among his teachers were Muhammad al-Walī al-Burnāwī and possi- bly Muhammad Fūdī, the father of Uthmān b. Fudi.” Al-Wali (flourished during the late seventeenth century) was among the most famous scholars of Kanem-Bornu. Aside from his writings on Ash'ari theology, his legal opinions prohibiting smoking made him one of the few Mālikī scholars of his age to take such a stance,” anticipating the prohibition of tobacco by several eighteenth-century scholars,including al-Tiant himself.” Al-Kashnawt’s disposition toward the esoteric sciences appears to res- onate with later Tijānī articulations: he accepted their role in the actu- alization of religious knowledge, but he cautioned against their misuse. Al-Kashnāwī was hesitant to teach students his esoteric knowledge, having been warned previously: “If I reached the countries of the East and espe- cially the Haramayn, I should not reveal to any of their inhabitants that I know something of those letter-based sciences, and what resembles them of the sand-based sciences, on account of their prevalent [mis]uses in these countries for causing corruption, tribulations and dissension [among peo- ple], in plain sight of those of discerning minds.””? Al-Kashnawi’s book is Sufism and Islamic Intellectual Developments in the Eighteenth Century 29 thus not merely a collection of esoteric sciences, but a moral pronounce- ment on the “virtues and misuses of the secret sciences.”” He laid out twelve preconditions for practicing such secrets, ranging from initiation, concealment, seriousness of need to the fear of God.” This was no doubt important advice: by the eighteenth century, the esoteric sciences were studied throughout Egypt by “leading members of the establishment.” The appearance of a sub-Saharan African scholar in Cairo as a foremost teacher and moral guide to the use of esoteric sciences in Cairo demon- strates once again that Africans in the Middle East were central figures to the intellectual debates of their age. Salih al-Fullani, a Fulani scholar from Futa Jallon (modern-day Guinea), came to reside in Medina and garnered a wide reputation for Islamic schol- arship. The later Indian scholar, Muhammad 'Azimabadi (d. 1905), referred to al-Fullānī as the scholarly “renewer” (mujaddid) of his age,\" and his legacy has been variously appropriated by India’s Ah/ al-Hadith move- ment as well as Arab Salafism. But al-Fullānī was also the hadith teacher of Muhammad al-Hafiz al-Shingītī (d. 1830), the student of al-Tijānī, and famous propagator of the Tijāniyya into the Sahara, as well as of the Mo- roccan Tijàni scholar Hamduün b. al-Hajj (d. 1817)? Al-Fullani was also an associate of al-Tyani’s Khalwati Shaykh in Medina, Muhammad al- Samman.? While several of al-Fullanr's students no doubt rejected the Sufi orders and the schools of law (madhahib), perhaps influenced by their teacher’s stance against \"following the schools of law with zeal and narrow-mindedness,” others remained defenders of such institutions. Al- Fullanr's prominent Mauritanian student, Imam ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Ahmad al-Shinqiti (d. 1809), established himself in Morocco as a prominent Malik jurist and later accepted the Tijaniyya, confirming al-Tijanr's scholarly cre- dentials to countrymen like Mihammad al-Hafiz. “By God,” Imam ‘Abd al-Rahman swore of al-Tijani, \"there is no one more knowledgeable on the face of the earth than him.\"* Indeed, al-Fullani’s argument for ijtihad by reading established textual sources (nass) in dialogue with scholarly opin- ion was similar to al-Tijani’s own legal methodology, although al-Tyani himself otherwise remained a practicing Maliki.” Al-Fullant exemplifies the ability of African scholars to situate themselves at the center of ijtihad and hadith renewal networks that were often closely related to an accent on “Muhammadan Sufism.” Rather than reading Fullani’s stance on ijtihad as evidence of his influence by Salafi-Wahhabism, he in fact evidenced a critical West African engagement with the madhāhib that dates at least 30 CHAPTER ONE back to Ahmad Bābā al-Massūfī and the scholars of Timbuktu, who had earlier criticized the Moroccan scholars' fanatical attachment to the Maliki school. Such a stance was formative for eighteenth-century currents of scholarly verification. While al-Tijani had no direct links to the African scholars mentioned here, their ideas clearly influenced the eighteenth-century scholarly net- works to which al-Tijānī was connected. As al-Dabbāgh's relationship with Shaykh al-Burnāwī indicates, the scholarly atmosphere of eighteenth- century Fez was infused with references to Islamic scholarship south of Morocco. A collection of nine biographical dictionaries of Moroccan schol- ars, mostly concerning the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, present no fewer than nineteen separate Saharan scholars, with the designation “al- Shinqitt,” residing in Morocco.* AI-Tijant himself left Fez in the later years of his life to visit the Saharan oasis town of Tuwat, where he exchanged knowledge with scholars there, perhaps of the Kunti-Qadiriyya scholarly lineage, originating farther south, which had an established presence in the town by the late eighteenth century. If such references were lost on later generations of Moroccans, sub-Saharan Islamic scholarship certainly remembered its long-standing dialogue with Moroccan intellectual history, and with eighteenth-century revivalism more broadly. The reception of the Tijāniyya south of the Sahara must be seen as the continuation of this earlier trend. Egypt and the Hijaz in the Eighteenth Century Shaykh Ahmadal-Tijānī arrived in Medina, the city of the Prophet, in 1774. After “God fulfilled his longing” in accomplishing the pious visitation (zi- yāra) of the Prophet's grave,* al-Tijani sought out Muhammad al-Samman (d. 1775), the holder of the keys to the Prophet’s tomb, whom al-Tyani had been informed was the axial saint of the age (gutb al-zamān). Al-TijānT's companionship with al-Samman demonstrates his connection to two over- lapping scholarly networks in the Middle East in the eighteenth century. The first was the “school” of Ibrāhīm al-Kūrānī: al-Samman had studied with Muhammad Hayat al-Sindi (d. 1750), who studied with his country- man also resident in Medina, Muhammad Sindi (d. 1727), who studied with Ibrāhīm al-Kūrānī. This was the same knowledge network—emphasizing in varying degrees hadith study, scholarly reasoning outside of the madhhab (ijtihād), and the Sufism of Ibn al-‘Arabi—that included the likes of Shah Sufism and Islamic Intellectual Developments in the Eighteenth Century 31 Walī-Allāh, Uthmān b. Fūdī, Ahmad b. Idris, Muhammad al-Shawkant, and (perhaps more tangentially) Muhammad b. ‘Abd al-Wahhab.*’ The second was with the Khalwatiyya as taught by the Syrian shaykh Mustafa al-Bakri (d. 1749): Muhammad al-Sammān was initiated by al- Bakrī, and his primary Sufi affiliation remained the Khalwatiyya. Al- Bakri’s students in Egypt had helped to spread the order throughout Egypt and North Africa. Although al-Bakri stressed exclusive allegiance to the Khalwatiyya, he himself was one of only two fully authorized students of Abd al-Ghanī al-Nābulusī. Al-Sammān, like al-Nābulusī, authored a major treatise on the notion of a Tariqa Muhammadiyya. Al-Tijanr's own teachings often reference the scholars and ideas of these Middle East net- works associated with al-Küranr and Mustafa al-Bakri. I attempt here, therefore, to briefly explore the primary sources relevant to the scholars of the *Kürant school\" and the Khalwatiyya with particular reference to ideas shared by al-Tijànt. My point here is not that al-Tijani simply reflected the teachings of his initiators in the Middle East, but that these teachings provide an important context to al-Tyani’s own articulations later on. The Legacy of Ibrāhīm al-Kūrānī By most accounts, Ibrahim b. al-Hasan al-Kūrānī al-Kurdī —one of the towering figures of seventeenth-century Sufism”** and known as the “seal of verifiers\" (khatimat al-muhaqqiqin)?— was a central influence on the intellectual dynamism of the eighteenth century. Al-Kūrānī and his stu- dents “dominated hadith scholarship and its chains of authority”* during the period. His teaching of hadith—as evidenced from al-Küranr's recently published (2013) commentary on the Prophet’s words, “Actions are by in- tentions”—invoked dense theological discussions (free will versus pre- destination), debates among legal schools (what constitutes the formation of intention), and Sufism (sincerity and the heart’s purity as the prereq- uisite of all action).?' While hadith certainly constituted a foundation for his teaching, al-Kürani's most influential writing was in the disciplines of theology and Sufism. The latter was mostly associated with the defense of Ibn al-‘Arabi, particularly in articulating the controversial notion of “the oneness of being” (wahdat al-wujüd). Many eighteenth-century scholars celebrated their connections to al-Kürani in their own teaching of Ibn al- \"Arabi, such as the Indian revivalist Shah Walr-Allah (d. 1762)? and the Ye- meni legal theorist Muhammad al-Shawkani (d. 1839).? Al-Tijani himself 32 CHAPTER ONE would defend the concept of wahdat al-wujūd despite the conspicuous ab- sence of prior reference in Moroccan texts such as the /briz, and the more skeptical stances of Moroccan Shadhili scholars like Hasan al-Yüsi or of the Timbuktu students of Muhammad al-Bakrī. It is thus useful to con- sider al-KūrānTs bold articulation of the concept, as it likely informed al- Tijanr's teachers in the Middle East. Similar to the writings of al-Nābulusī, al-Kūrānī's work went beyond a selective restatement of the idea,” but presented a masterful exploration, ending with the concept of divine man- ifestation (tajalla) that may have influenced al-Tyani’s own understanding. Al-Kürani argued that wahdat al-wujüd was reconcilable to orthodox Ash ari theology since God, whose quiddity and existence are identical, 1s both distinct from all contingent quiddities and manifests Himself in them.” Newly published treatises of al-Kürant on the subject, “The Boun- tiful Ascension in the Verification of Divine Transcendence in the Oneness of Being\" (Matla' al-jüd f1 tahqiq al-tanzih fi wahdat al-wujüd) and “The Splendorous Insight into the Persistence of Divine Transcendence with God's Manifestation in Created Forms\" (Jalā al-nazr fī bagā al-tanzīh maa LĻ-tajallī fī I-sūr),”* permit further exploration. Al-Kürani tasks him- self with explaining several mysterious statements of Ibn al-'Arabi, such as “Glory to Him who made things manifest, while He is their essence (‘ayn),” or “The Real, Most High, is present (mawijiid) in His Essence (bi-dhatih), for His Essence (li-dhdatih).”*’ He presents the logical precept, “The world exists through God (bi-Llāh) and not through itself, nor for itself: (all) exis- tence is bound (muqayyad) to the existence of the Real,\"?* and cites a poem: “Surely the creation is an illusion (khayal); only real in the (divine) reality.” The nonreality of creation, or its lack of reality except in God, is due to its inescapable state of transition (istihala).”? The creation, however, does not encompass God, for He is beyond comprehension (ta'aqqul) or specifica- tion (ta 'ayyun).\"? What manifests from specified entities, when they appear in a state of fixation and unscented with the “fragrance of divine being,” is not divine appearance but rather God’s rules (ahkām) and effects (athār) specific to that entity. It is the concept of divine manifestation (tajalla), al-Kürani suggests in the conclusion of both texts (Matla' al-jüd and Jala’ al-nazr), which permits a person to grasp the simultaneous omnipresence and transcendence of God: the divine manifests in any manner He chooses without compromis- ing His transcendence.'” The manifestation of the sun's light on the moon, al-Kürani cites Ibn al-'Arabi to say, does not mean that the moon has the Sufism and Islamic Intellectual Developments in the Eighteenth Century 33 light of the sun “in” itself, nor has the sun moved to join its identity (dhat) with that of the moon. Divine manifestation thus represented neither the fu- sion between God and creation (ittihad), nor the incarnation (hulu!) of God in creation.\"? The obvious conclusion here is that divine manifestation is not the act of God \"coming down\" (tanzil) upon a created entity, or moving from one place to another: it is when the veils of a creation's dependent (or nonessential) reality disappear before the presence of God's ultimate being (al-wujüd al-muftlag). This witnessing is subjective (shuhüdt), because few perceive divine manifestation; but it is also ontological (wujiidi), because nothing has intrinsic reality except God’s ultimate being. As demonstrated later in this book, al-Küranr's explanation closely anticipated that of al- Tijānī in late eighteenth-century Maghreb. While later inheritors of the \"Kūrānī school,” such as the Medina- based Indian hadith scholar Muhammad Hayat al-Sindi, may not have transmitted the depth of al-Kürant's commitment to the teachings of Ibn al- ‘Arabi, neither were they entirely untouched by it. Al-Sindi, a Naqshbandi Sufi who taught hadith behind the Prophet’s tomb in Medina,\"* wrote a number of Sufi works, including a lengthy commentary on a seminal text of the Sufi tradition, the Hikam of Ibn ‘Ata-Allah (d. 1309, Alexandria).!°° In explaining Ibn ‘Ata-Allah’s aphorism, “You are only veiled from the suns of gnosis by the clouds of effects,” al-Sindi wrote: “As for the gnos- tics (al- arifün), they see secrets in [God's] effects (@thar), the witnessing of which increases them in illumination, until witnessing created beings does not prevent them from witnessing the Creator. Rather they see effects as reflections of the Sovereign Lord of effects, as if they were Him, except that in reality they have no attribution to Him. Exalted is God beyond that. So understand the secret of this matter if you are its custodian (a//).”%% Elsewhere, al-Sindī is emphatic in his denial that such knowledge entails God's fusion (ittihad) with or indwelling (hulül) in the creation.\"\" But al- Kürani, as mentioned above, was no less insistent that the idea of wahdat al-wujiid did not mean blasphemous denial of God’s transcendence. Al- though he did not so openly endorse the concept, al-Sindi was clearly not opposed to wahdat al-wujüd. His open discussion of Sufi gnosis necessi- tates reframing the alleged reformist impulse he supposedly shared with Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab.\"* He was certainly not the proto-Wahhabi who transmitted the extreme theology of the earlier Kadizade movement to Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab.\"? Indeed, al-Sindr's shaykh in the Naqshbandiyya, the Yemeni scholar of Medina 'Abd al-Rahman al-Saqqaf Ba- Alawi (d. 1713), 34 CHAPTER ONE claimed to only initiate Sufi aspirants with the permission of the Prophet, saying, \"There is no veil remaining between me and the Prophet.”' There is no doubt, then, that al-Sind1’s gnostic understandings were the result of his Sufi training at the hands of a consummate Sufi shaykh. Muhammad al-Sammān and Ahmad al-Tijānī, and not Muhammad b. Abd al-Wahhāb, were most certainly the clearer mirrors of al-Sindī and eighteenth-century Medinan scholarship. Mustafa al-Bakri and the Egyptian Khalwatiyya Al-Tijanr's most significant Sufi initiation in the Middle East was the K hal- watiyya, obtained from Muhammad al-Samman and Mahmid al-Kurdi, who were the students of Mustafa Kamal al-Din al-Bakri (d. 1749, Cairo). While the extent of al-Bakri’s identification with an eighteenth-century Khalwati revival has been debated,\" he initiated significant numbers of Muslims into the Khalwatiyya, including the head of Egypt’s Azhar Uni- versity Muhammad al-Hifni (d. 1767), and was indisputably “one of the most prominent Khalwatt Sufis of the eighteenth century.”'’ Al-Bakri’s spiritual genealogy in the Khalwatiyya passed through ‘Alt Qarabash (d. 1686, Edirne), who emphasized the practice of a regular litany, the wird al-sattar, and vigilant combat against the lower self through fasting and periodic retreat (khalwa).'? But al-Bakri had previously been initiated into the Nagshbandiyya, connecting him to the Indian rival of Ahmad Sirhindi, Taj al-Din 'Uthmani (d. 1640), through *the seal of hadith scholars” ‘Ab- dallah b. Salim al-Basrt (d. 1722, Mecca).'^ Al-Basrī was also the student of al-Kürani.^ As previously mentioned, al-Bakri was also only one of two students to receive full authorization (ijaza) from the noted Naqsh- bandi Sufi and scholar ‘Abd al-Ghanī al-Nābulusī (d. 1731), with whom he studied the works of Ibn al-‘Arabr.\"® Confirmed in his attachment to the Khalwatiyya by al-Nabulusi,\"” al-Bakri would later require his disciples’ exclusive attachment to the order.\" He experienced nineteen separate vi- sions of the Prophet, and three of Khidr—the latter who designated him as the “axial saint of the east.” His saintly authority allegedly extended to the spirit-world, and he initiated seven kings of the jinn into the Khalwati- yya.'? Al-Jabartī thus describes al-Bakrī: \"He was granted the keys of all sciences, so that the saints of his age and the seekers of the truth, east and west, submitted to him. He bound the chiefs of the jinns by compact and his help prevailed.” Once the Prophet appeared to al-Bakrī and asked him Sufism and Islamic Intellectual Developments in the Eighteenth Century 35 about his composition of prayers (presumably the wird al-sahar), *Where did you obtain this help?” He answered, “From you, O Messenger of God.” The Prophet nodded.\"? Although he may have focused more on training disciples than did al-Nābulusī, he was also a prolific writer, authoring some 220 works.\"! Al-Bakri’s teaching was characterized by the transmission of Sufi gno- sis within an enduring emphasis on shaykh-disciple relations. One of his more significant works appears to have been “The Epistle on Sufi Com- panionship” (a/-Risāla fī suhba), beginning with the words, “Praise be to God who made the companionship with the elect (akhiyār) the reason for success and happiness.”'”? When giving spiritual training to his designated deputy (khalifa) al-Hifni, al-Bakri stressed the importance of grateful com- panionship over individual exertions: “Give heed to what I say. If you wish to fast and pray, practice spiritual discipline and exercises, do so in your home country."
