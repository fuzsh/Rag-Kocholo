        "text": "The arrival of Captain Azubuike Egwuekwe and Josiah Maduabuchi arrival in Bizerte , Tunisia for the second leg tie with C.A.Bizertin was well celebrated by the players and Officials of Warri Wolves, with the sole aim of making it to the second round in spite of the fact that the first leg in Warri ended without a goal to show for it.\n\nAccording to the Media Manager Moses Etu, Azubuike who got married last weekend could not travel with the rest of the team while Josiah Maduabuchi was left behind due to paper works but both players have been training in Lagos under a Coach and arrived Bizerte successfully on Friday morning.\n\nSpeaking on the match, Azubuike expressed happiness that he has made it at last and vowed to use his experience to guide the team to victory.\n\nMeanwhile, Etu has advised his colleagues to always verify their story before it is published, saying that it is unfortunate that some people could publish lies all in a bid to paint the Club in a bad light.\n\nAccording to Etu, there is no truth in a story published by an online medium that the Club is owing players and that the Club travelled with 16 players to Tunisia without finding out why the Club travelled without two players who have since joined the team in Tunis.\n\n‘ It is unfortunate that people could go to the extent of trying to destabilize our arrangement to have a good outing in Bizerte by coming out with a false story when all hands should be on deck to see that the team qualifies for the next round. It is only Warri Wolves that has successfully paid the salaries and allowances of players and Coaches for last season and we have also paid the bonuses and allowances of players including the victory over Elkanemi in a our only league match. We are not bothered because nobody can tarnish our image as we are up to the task”\n\nEtu therefore urged all to disregard such report and pray for the team to scale through in the second leg of the CAF Confederation Cup in what promises to be explosive and exciting.\n\n2014 Men’s African Club championship\n\nThe African representative at the 2014 FIVB Men’s Club World Championship will be determined on Saturday when 10 time champions Ahly (EGY) battle it out against 3 time champions Esperance (TUN) in the 2014 Men’s African Club Championship final at the Olympic Hall in Sousse, Tunisia.\n\nWinners of the final will clinch the title and book a ticket to the FIVB prestigious event in Belo Horizonte, Brazil from May 5 to 10. The bronze medal match will take place between two Tunisian teams Sfax and Etoile du Sahel.\n\nAhly who own now the record of crowns to their name are now seeking their eleventh title after 1980, 1983, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2010 and 2011 with a relatively new line up having only 3 players kept from the squad that won the last title since 3 years.\n\nAhly led their preliminary pool D with 4 straight victories over Ahly Tripoli (LIB), Prisond (CMR), FAP (CMR) and Beau Vallon (SEY) dropping only a set against the Libyan side.\n\nThey then continued their victory rhythm after beating Algeria’s Bourj Bouarrirj in the quarterfinal before they passed the biggest obstacle in the semifinal after beating defending champions Sfax after an epic tiebreaker to claim a final spot.\n\nOn the other had Esperance (TUN) who won the Arab Club Championship last month are now seeking their fourth trophy after 1994, 1998 and 2000 to make the trio of the Tunisian, Arab and African championships.\n\nTheir line up 7 current national team players beside the Russian Alexander Sorokltove and now they want to regain the cup they didn’t gain since 14 years.\n\nEsperance led the preliminary Pool C with 5 straight victories over Ahly Benighazi (LIB), GSU (KEN), Port (CMR), Nemostars (UGA) and Mugher Cement (ETH) losing only a set in their way to the quarterfinal against the Libyan side. They took over Setif (ALG) in the quarters before they eliminated the organizers Etoile du Sahel in the semifinal.\n\nCAVB web site: http://www.cavb.org Twitter: CAVB Tweets Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CAVBVolleyball\n\nYouTube: CAVB Video 2014 Men’s African Club Championship page\n\nWarri Wolves have been denied by the host Federation two days after arriving Bizerte for their second leg Confederation Cup match with C.A.Bizertin and less than 48 hours contrary to CAF rules which says an away team must be allowed to train at least twice before any match.\n\nThe Warri based team had hoped that they will have access to the pitch on Friday afternoon but they were surprised to hear that they cannot make use of the place as the host said training there will affect the natural grass.\n\nWith that, Warri Wolves decided to make use of a training pitch belonging to a third division club based in Bizerte, an action which did not go down well with the players who had wanted to have a feel of the pitch.\n\nSpeaking on their action, Coach Okpodu said this will bring out the best from his boys as they are more desired to play against the boys whom they feel are not better than them.\n\n‘ The boys are not happy but they are not demoralized either because they know what is at stake. This will spur them the better because they believe they were unlucky at home and this is an opportunity to prove who is better. I only want to pray for fair officiating and it will be well’\n\nWarri Wolves Football Club arrived Bizerte on Wednesday evening to a very harsh weather as the team is kept in Corniche Palace Hotel, situated by the sea which has compounded the weather problem facing the players.\n\nApart from the harsh weather, the team could not train on Thursday morning because of a heavy down pour but the Coaches have decided to reschedule the training to 2.00 clock in the evening but the good news is that the Management led by Davidson Owumi is tackling what they called” psychological war” headlong by advising the players they have no choice but to deliver.\n\nOwumi who spoke with the players early Thursday morning told the players they just have to deliver, weather or no weather and that management will do everything to motivate them towards conquering the Tunisian side who held them to a draw in Warri last week.\n\nOwumi also told the players that Captain Azubuike who could not make the trip due to his marriage has decided to join alongside Josiah Maduabuchi who was left behind due to paper problem in Lagos.\n\nAccording to Owumi, both players will join the team on Friday morning with the sole aim of qualifying for the next round.\n\n” I want to thank all of you for your understanding and you all to know that this is another psychological war which must be won as you can see that we have been kept by the sea to make the weather worse for us. You can also see that the quality of the food wehqve been given is nothing to write home about but we must win this match for Nigerians. We will do our best to encourage you and you have no choice than to deliver” said Owumi who is not new to matters like this.\n\nMeanwhile, the match will come up on Sunday by 1.30pm (Nigeria time) with match officials coming from Sudan while the match Commissioner is from neighboring State, Morocco.\n\nIt would be recalled that the referees for the first leg in Warri came from Morocco, Tunisia neighbour which made it difficult for the Warri players to understand the conversation between the Tunisian players and the centre referee each time there was any complaint.\n\nA 30 man team of Warri Wolves will depart Nigeria on Wednesday by 6am for the second leg of the CAF Confederation Cup with Edo FA Chairman, Chief Abel Ehigie as head of delegation to be assisted by Emmanuel Adesanya from the Nigeria Football Federation.\n\nIn a brief statement released to the Press by the Media Manager of the Club, Moses Etu, the team is made up of 18 players and 12 Officials without Oghenekaro Etebo who is in Italy for trials and Captain Azubuike Egwekwe who got married last weekend.\n\nSome of the players who made the team include Okiemute Odah, Ike ThankGod, Oke Ogagotewho, Obaje Joshua, Josiah Maduabuchi, Ikechukwu Ibenegbu, Achibi Ewenike, Musa Najare and Goodluck Onamado.\n\nAccording to Etu, the team which arrived Lagos on Tuesday evening will board a Moroccan Airline to Morocco, spend the night before moving to Tunisia on Thursday morning for the crucial match which comes up on Sunday in Tunisia.\n\nEtu further said the team is well prepared to confront the Tunisians, hence, they have decided to go early to acclimatize before the make or mar encounter.\n\nHe therefore urged Nigerians to pray for them as the task of scaling through is not impossible.\n\n” We know that it will not be easy but we also know that nothing is impossible before God hence, our appeal to all Nigerians is to continue to pray for the team”.\n\nThe first leg of the tie between Warri Wolves and CA Bizertin was played in Warri over the weekend and it ended goalless\n\nWarri Wolves assistant Captain, Uche Ossai has assured Nigerians that the Club will win their next continental match against C.A.Bizertin from Tunisia for the sake of their Captain and Super Eagles defender, Azubuike Egwuekwe who is getting married to his heartthrob, Isioma in Abi Town, Ndokwa area of Delta State on Saturday, 24 hours before the encounter.\n\nAccording to Ossai who will not be able to attend personally as a result of the match said the only thing they can do for their Captain is to win convincingly for him and his wife to be.\n\nHe however said those of them who will not be playing on Sunday will be there to celebrate with the couple and wish him the best.\n\n” It is un fortunate some of us will not be there because of the match but we have all resolved to win this match for the new couple as that is the debt we owe him. He is an inspirational captain who has served this club well.\n\nHe deserves the best from us and by the Grace of God, we shall dedicate the victory to him. We know the match will be tough as the Tunisian Club parades old and experience players judging from their statistics but we are equal to the task”\n\nSpeaking on the marriage, Azubuike expressed gratitude to God for helping him to get somebody who really loved him and urged the players to win for him.\n\n” I want to really thank God as He has done much for me especially picking the right lady for me. I want to appeal to the players to play their heart out and give us victory as a gift. The only thing I want I want from them is victory and if they can do that, we will be happy” said Egwuekwe who was part of the team that won the Nations Cup last year.\n\nIn a related development, Athletique Bizertin Football Club of Tunisia failed to arrive Nigeria on Thursday and will now fly in on Friday Morning.\n\nHaving accomplished their mission in style, a delighted Tunisian men’s volleyball team posed for photos with their thumbs up.\n\nThe hosts of the final qualifying tournament on the African continent came through their four qualifying matches at the Palais des Sports hall in Tunis without dropping a single set to secure their ticket to the FIVB Men’s World Championship in Poland from August 30 to September 21.\n\nIn the deciding match, Tunisia superbly dispatched the previously unbeaten team from Congo Brazzaville 3-0 (25-11, 25-17, 25-17) in just 62 minutes. That performance alone demonstrated the superiority of the experienced North Africans.\n\n“Our team’s strength lies in its well-balanced collective,” said successful coach Fethi Mekaouer. “We will try to do Africa proud at the World Championship.” That will certainly not be an easy task for the men in red shirts: as the top African team in the FIVB rankings, Tunisia will be grouped along with defending champions Brazil, dark horse Germany, Korea, Finland and the second ranked team from NORCECA at the FIVB Volleyball Men’s World Championship finals. However, the world number 13 team does boast a wealth of experience at major events. This is the fourth time in a row, and eighth altogether, that the Tunisians have lined up against the best teams on the planet in the World Championship.\n\nThe Tunisian men ended the last championship in 2010 in 19th place, while the best result so far was a 15th place finish in 2006. Back then, they impressed with victories against South Korea, Kazakhstan and Puerto Rico en route to the second round. And the three African men’s teams – Egypt and Cameroon have also qualified for the Championship – are looking to challenge the world elite again this time around. “If the three African teams are well prepared going into this kind of event, then they can hold their own and even cause the odd upset,” said Cameroon’s coach Peter Nonnenbroich.\n\nTunisia’s men certainly have the perfect preparation for the highlight of the season. They will make their debut in the FIVB World League, where they will face top-class opponents like Cuba, Turkey and Mexico in the preliminary round. Tunisia is one of five debutants in a record-breaking season: the FIVB Volleyball World League heralds a new era in 2014.\n\nThe unique competition, which features the world’s top volleyball teams and has been thrilling fans around the world since 1990, will be bigger than ever for its 25th anniversary. Rather than the previous record of 18 nations in 2013, 28 teams will line up in this year’s event. And Tunisia is making its first appearance. “Playing teams with international experience will definitely help the team continue to develop,” said coach Mekaouer, whose team was also the only African outfit at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.\n\nThe qualifying tournament for the FIVB Volleyball Men’s World Championship Poland 2014 in its native Tunisia was not exactly a major challenge for the team, who with eight titles at the African Championship holds the continental record. Before beating Congo Brazzaville 3-0, the men in red had triumphed just as convincingly against Niger, Senegal and the Seychelles. The 25-19 score against the team from the Seychelles, which eventually finished third, was the closest set of the tournament for the dominant hosts.\n\nThis degree of dominance allowed coach Mekaouer to give all the players in his team, which is built around the experienced Hfaiedh Noureddine, a chance to gain experience. After securing the ticket to the FIVB Volleyball Men’s World Championship, the celebrations both in the hall and in the country’s newspapers were relatively low key – after all, they were expected to succeed.\n\nIn all 19 of the 24 teams for the FIVB Men’s World Championship Poland 2014 have now been confirmed: Bulgaria, Serbia, Germany, Belgium, Finland and France qualified at the beginning of this year. They are joined by hosts Poland, Olympic champions Russia and Italy from Europe. The four Asian vacancies were filled by Australia, Iran, China and Korea, while Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil took the three spots reserved for South America. More recently Egypt, Cameroon and Tunisia were the three Africa countries that qualified for the Championship.\n\nThe NORCECA confederation will hold four qualifying tournaments (each with four teams) scheduled to take place in Cuba (May 12 to 18), USA (May 13 to 19), Canada (May 14 to 20) and Puerto Rico (May 20 to 26). The FIVB Volleyball Men’s World Championship Poland 2014 NORCECA playoff which will take place either in Mexico or Puerto Rico from July 14 to 20 and will determine the last of the five NORCECA teams to book their place at the World Championships this year.\n\nTunisia can sit back and relax: the country’s volleyball teams have met their targets on two fronts. Just two weeks before the men, Tunisia’s ladies had also sensationally qualified for the first time in 28 years for the FIVB Volleyball Women’s World Championship that will be held from September 23 to October 12 in Italy. Tunisia joined Cameroon as the second African team in the pot at the Drawing of Lots that took place in Parma on Monday.\n\nWith the two African teams, 18 of the 24 teams for the FIVB Volleyball Women’s World Championship have now been decided. Beside Tunisia and Cameron, seven European teams had already come through their qualifying tournaments on the first weekend of 2014: the winners of the five third-round qualifying tournaments – Turkey, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Croatia, and Bulgaria – as well as the top two second-placed teams Serbia and the Netherlands. They joined hosts Italy, defending champions Russia and Germany from Europe, Brazil and Argentina from South America, and Japan, China, Thailand and Kazakhstan from Asia.\n\nThe NORCECA confederation will hold five qualifying tournaments (each with four teams) scheduled to take place in Cuba (May 12 to 18), USA and Dominican Republic (May 13 to 19), Canada (May 14 to 20) and Puerto Rico (May 20 to 26). The winner of each group will qualify for the FIVB Volleyball Women’s World Championship Italy 2014 while the runners-up will go through to a play-off for the fifth and final place from June 2 to 9 in Trinidad.\n\nCAVB web site: http://www.cavb.org Twitter: CAVB Tweets Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CAVBVolleyball\n\nYouTube: CAVB Video 2014 Men’s World Championship African qualifier"
