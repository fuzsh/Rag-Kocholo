For example, content security would enable you to turn off access to all JPEGs, thereby breaking many web pages, whereas content filtering would prevent users from accessing sites that host JPEGs that are inappropriate for a work environment, such as sports related sites.\n\n14 Content filtering databases\n\nDigital Arts InterSafe Optenet IWF WebWasher Proventia Smartfilter Websense SurfControl Clients Internet BlueCoat webfilter Your lists exceptions DRTR\n\n15 How We Secure the Web         Intranet Web Server\n\nPublic Web Server    Internal Network Public Internet   AAA: User logs onto network and is authenticated via NTLM, AD (Single-Sign-on), LDAP, Radius, Forms, local password.

Blue Coat Gateway Anti-Spyware scans for spyware signatures High-performance ProxyAV™ Web anti-virus appliance scans Web traffic for known spyware signatures using proven third party anti-virus scanning engines. The ProxyAV is the only solution capable of virus scanning Web traffic with low latency, leveraging cache intelligence logic to optimize performance. Blue Coat Gateway Anti-Spyware prevents spyware communications Blue Coat blocks client communications to known spyware and adware sources. Reporting features combined with on-proxy URL filtering identify Spyware “calling home” activity on the network. Communication attempting to reach a spyware domain is immediately terminated by Blue Coat’s ProxySG. The ProxySG supports five leading on-proxy URL filtering databases, plus custom categories, overrides and exceptions to advise, coach and enforce users. Blue Coat Gateway Anti-Spyware targets spyware infected systems for cleansing Blue Coat’s custom logging and reporting features enable administrators to target suspect systems and trigger spyware clean-up. Blue Coat will interoperate with InterMute’s SpySubtract solution for targeted cleansing and removal of spyware agents from desktops.\n\n23 How We Secure the Web               Intranet Web Server\n\nPublic Web Server    Internal Network  Public Internet     AAA: User logs onto network and is authenticated via NTLM, AD (Single-Sign-on), LDAP, Radius, Forms, local password.

A cleaver solution would be to use Content Filtering. BlueCoat now introduces Generation 3 of content filtering, BlueCoat Webfilter. 350 Million\n\n31 Generation 1 The first generation of content filters consisted of\n\nstatic manually managed lists of popular pornographic and unproductive websites. Very often retreived from access logs, popular bad sites where banned. The intended purpose was to save bandwidth and warn users that inapropriate behaviour was logged. People got together and distributed their lists in free lists compatible with proxies such as Squid. The distributed list where in the size of a million URL:s 1 Million 349 Million\n\n32 Generation 2 Corporations relised they could make money of a list\n\nand started to collect lists and logs from the web, manually rating these in larger scale. More categories where added to increase value. The systems started to collect URL:S autmatically and download new lists periodicly. Some of them even many times every day. Special categories where added for static security threats placed on known webservers, spyware phishing etc. Other than bad sites where added such as Economy, business, news etc. to present statistics of Internet usage. 15 Million 335 Million\n\n33 Generation 2 Number of URL:s was in the numbers of 10-20 millions.\n\nHitrates in logsystems presented was in the numbers of 50-80%. Regular expression on URL:s and other tricks sometimes gave a false picture of rating over 90%. But in fact less than 5% of the Internet was covered. 15 Million 335 Million\n\n34 Generation 3 The dynamics of internet and new security risks urged for a new way of categorizing the Internet, Dynamic rating of uncategorized websites can today rate most websites, the ones thats impossible to rate could be stripped down to present only html and images to reduce risk. The static URL database are constantly updated like any Generation 2 filter. This database is cached in some systems (ProxySG) to increase performance. The rest (95%) of the Internet is categorised using dynamic rating. 15 Million 335 Million\n\n35 Dynamic Real Time Rating\n\nDBR Servers Internet 44µs RS G2 DRTR language 1 language 2 language 3 language 4 language 5 language n Language detection To background rating HR DXD RS= Rating server DXD = ?

Director 2 Tell Director about new content Content Owners Edge Systems 3 Tell caches to update content We focus on not only the networking side of the CDN, but also the publishing experience. Our goal is to reduce their pain. First, the content owner publishes his content. Second, the publishing system tells Director that new content exists. We offer a family of tools to automate that process, from a no-touch scenario to full integration with an SDK. Third, Director tells the caches to update content. It controls the CDN, but does not sit in the data path to add additional points of publishing and failure. Fourth, the caches pull content from origin servers using native protocols (HTTP, MMS over HTTP, etc.) You can scale your web farm without scaling out the Director platform. Fifth, the caches deliver the content. Users 5 Deliver the content.\n\n80 Director GUI"
