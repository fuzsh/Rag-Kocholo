        "text": "Frequently asked questions about Robinwood\n\nBelow we have put together answers to the questions we are frequently asked by parents about the residential to Robinwood. We hope you find the information useful. If you have any further questions that have not been answered here, please feel free to contact the Year 6 teachers, who will be happy to help with any queries.\n\nWhat food do the children get at meal times?\n\nDo I need to send them with any other food?\n\nYou certainly do not need to send your child with any food; the food is good and there is plenty of it! Robinwood aim to provide healthy meals that will appeal to the children in order that they get the energy intake they need to fuel their three days at Robinwood.\n\nBreakfast - the children can have toast and cereals and they can also have a full cooked breakfast.\n\nLunchtime - the children have the option of a sandwich or jacket potato with a choice of fillings such as tuna, cheese or baked beans. There is sometimes an option to have soup and they will also get some fruit and yoghurt.\n\nEvening Meal – the children get a hot cooked evening meal; there is always have a choice of meal such as pasta Bolognese or pizza and it is always followed by a tasty dessert.\n\nWith all the meals there is always a vegetarian option.\n\nBreak time snacks - Robinwood provide fruit that the children can access throughout the day if they need a snack. The children also get a flapjack during the middle day. There is also juice for the children so they can get a drink when they need one.\n\nBedtime - Before bedtime the children enjoy a cup of hot chocolate and a biscuit.\n\nMy child requires a special diet, can this be accommodated for?\n\nYes, based on our previous experiences, Robinwood are fantastic at ensuring that any special diets or specific requirements can be catered for as long as they are notified in advance. Nearer the time of going, parents will be sent a form to complete that asks about any medical needs and special diets so please compete this and send it back to school- we will share any necessary information with Robinwood. If any parents have any concerns or just want a chat about any special diet requirements, please contact the Year 6 teachers.\n\nHow are the children supervised outside of activity times?\n\nChildren attending Robinwood are supervised by Robinwood staff throughout their stay; whether this is during activity sessions, break times, meal times or night times. The Robinwood staff organise things so that when the children not sleeping they’re are kept busy all the time. Most of the time that means taking part in activity sessions, but in-between activity sessions the group leaders get the children involved in games, puzzles, songs and a variety of different challenges which are a key part of the whole Robinwood experience. Break times are also spent reviewing experiences and getting children kitted out for their next activity session.\n\nHow are the children supervised at night time?\n\nRobinwood Night duty staff supervise overnight assisted at relevant times by bedtime staff and wake-up staff. All dormitories have a call assistance button that can be pressed by the children, if they need a member of the Robinwood team overnight. Whilst it is the Robinwood staff who supervise the children over night, the bedrooms for our school staff are located close to the children so they are hand to help and support if needed.\n\nHow are the sleeping arrangements organised?\n\nChildren sleep in dormitories with all bedding provided and toilet facilities close by. A couple of weeks before we go to Robinwood, the children will be allocated the dormitory they are going to be sleeping in. We always let the children choose who they share a room with. We know that some children may feel nervous about being away from home and so sharing a room with friends can help they feel more comfortable.\n\nDo the children have showers whilst they are away?\n\nYes they do. Showers are timetables in for all the children usually following on from activities where the children may get wet or dirty (e.g. Nightline and Piranha Pool). The children need to pack a towel, shower gel etc. The group leaders ensure good standards of cleanliness are maintained.\n\nCan the children take a mobile phone with them and call home whilst they are away?\n\nNo we don’t allow the children to bring their mobile phone with them or call home whilst they away. There are exceptional circumstances when we have allowed a child to phone home but this is not the norm and would have been pre-arranged with school staff (E.g. once a parent was having an operation whilst we were away so the child did phone home to check their parent was ok). The main reason we do not children to call home is that if they hear their parent’s voice, they are likely to get upset or feel homesick whereas if they don’t speak to their parents, they are fine! Parents will have a school mobile number to contact if necessary and if there was an emergency school staff would always contact parents.\n\nHow is security managed at Robinwood?\n\nAll adult visitors to Robinwood have to sign in as part of their safeguarding procedures. At night-time, Robinwood Night Staff are constantly moving around the buildings. All the dormitory building are alarmed and these alarms are activated once the children go to bed. If the outside door is opened from the inside or outside at any time during the night, the alarm sounds (directly to devices that the Robinwood staff carry) and within seconds they are at the door to check who has either gone in or come out of the building.\n\nHow do Robinwood ensure all the activities are carried out safely?\n\nRobinwood have carried out detailed risk assessments of all aspects of a Robinwood course, including activity sessions and other areas. They review and update these assessments on a regular basis and ensure that children are not placed in risk situations. Copies of their risk assessments are given to the school prior to our visit; parents are welcome to view the risk assessments on request. They ensure that there are good levels of supervision from a high quality staff team. The level of supervision on activity sessions is appropriate to the nature of the activity taking place. For most activity sessions the group leader takes charge of their activity group, of between 9 and 13 children, without assistance from other Robinwood staff. For certain activity sessions including zip wire for example a second, appropriately qualified, member of the Robinwood team is timetabled to work with the group leader. As well as all the Robinwood staff there are the school staff who accompany children on a trip to Robinwood.\n\nWill my child be forced to do an activity that they do not want to do?\n\nBeing challenged and overcoming fears is all part of the Robinwood experience but no child will be forced to do an activity that they do not want to do. Some children get nervous or a bit scared when faced with activities such as the zip wire or trapeze and so the Robinwood and school staff will encourage the child to have a go. In some cases, success will mean that a child has managed to climb the first few steps of the trapeze when their initial reaction was not even to try. We tend to find that the vast majority of children manage to overcome any fear, once they have seen other children complete the activity and they then have a go themselves. The sense of achievement is huge if they completed an activity that they thought they couldn't. Pleased be assured that whilst encouragement and support are all part of the process, no child would be forced to do something they really didn't want to do."
