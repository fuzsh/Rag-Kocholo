        "text": "This is a bottle from March 21. I think it's been open almost a year (if not longer) and review is with a few drops of water to a 30ml pour.\n\nNose - where to begin ... Tyres, twiggy peat, mild antiseptic cream, damp dish-cloth, hay, something chalky and mineralic (you know what I mean :), wet soot, barley sugars and a hint of oak in the background. Yet, for all that, ultra clean and fresh - which seems to defy logic.\n\nTaste - perfectly sweet and sour. Lots of lemons and some type of smoked, over-ripe tropical fruit. Chalky and sooty as it develops with some sushi ginger.\n\nFinish - med - long. Chalky, again, (I love that note) with more rubber. Crisp and drying with some barley sugar residue.\n\nHonestly, I could sit down on another evening and write very different notes, but that's the beauty of this one - it's so complex for a ten year old and every pour and every sip captivates you. And what more can one say about such a well-loved and sought after whisky? Perhaps just agree with the consensus that this is about as good as it gets these days for a standard house bottling.\n\nBeing someone who dabbles with older bottles, it's also reassuring that this stuff is made, and, so I gather, tastes much like it was back in its heyday. I'll raise a toast to Springbank.\n\nCheers!\n\nAs promised (threatened in fact to be more accurate), my humble meandering thoughts over a dram of Springbank 10...\n\nLe couleur -\n\nFreshly cut hay, with a tint of… green!? A tone of gold, ripe wheat waving in the wind. Quite an unusual pantone, yet a lusterous sheen Ok, I was gonna write the whole review in rhyme… … but that’ll take to long. I rescind...\n\nThe nose is of freshly cut grass. Honeycomb, in fact beeswax? A whiff of sweet, but not sugary. Hard to pin, quite elusive. Peel of an oven-baked red apple… sweet yet with a sour tang. Maybe it's my lack of experience, but compared to other expressions that are more 'in your face' I really need to close my eyes and concentrate over 3-4 inhalations to be able to pick the nose of this one apart.\n\nThe palate. A certain sweetness hits first of all carried through from the nose, but it's not crunchy sugar, or plum, or cake or PX os something that's so easy (for me) to pinpoint. If anything, I'm thinking of air-light caster sugar thrown into the air. It's viscous… not to say oily and thick. Wow, I like this! It invites you to ‘chew’ on it for quite a while, which I'm more than happy to do with this palate. And still, at 46% there's no bite at all, it's just inviting and very round. I could eat this.\n\nThe Finish is subtle, yet somehow it lingers on… I think I can perceive a slight taste of metal and minerals, like sucking on a copper 2p coin (not recommended as a general way to pass time). After a while it seems to be transforming into a slightly waxy aftertaste. Hmm... I'm not sure I like that last element. After about 10min of setting down the glass I'm getting a second wave of finish, with wet chewing tobacco. Hey, that was unexpected!\n\nWith a drop of water, a clear citrus / fruity component appears in the nose. Maybe even some tangy sourness, like a pomelo. I think I like the nose even more with a drop of water in fact. It's fresh and inviting. On the palate, a drop of water brings out some more powder sugar sweetness on the attack, but it’s not overpowering (I e.g. don't take so well to the sugar-sweetness of Glendronach's younger expressions). The H2O also appears to give it some more alcoholic bite on the attack (which I suppose is rather counter intuitive...? Can lesser alcohol have more bite?). Having added water, I feel it accentuates the waxy element in the finish, almost gives it a drying characteristic… ok, that’s was not so nice. I think I'd like to have my nose and palate with water, but the finish without - thank you, please.\n\nThere’s quite a lot to get my head around in this one – I don’t know if one may call a 10 year old ‘complex’, but I have the impression that there's quite a bit to explore in here. Not least do I note that it keeps evolving and rolling on into different guises for quite a bit since a first sip. That's fun! Maybe it's a 'complexity' more reminiscent of a semi-intoxicated dialogue with a teenager full of complicated curiosities and ideas rather than a well traveled alderman of 21 or 30yrs, but who cares - it's still rather enjoyable and inviting.\n\nI bow and politely thank you for encouraging me to get this one. It's a very well invested £41.95 I'd say!\n\nSpringbank distillery was established in 1828 by the Reid family and is located on the southern Kintyre peninsula. In 1837 it was sold to John and William Mitchell, in-laws of the Reids. In 1897 the distillery was incorporated as J. & A. Mitchell & Company Ltd who still are the owners. The distillery was closed on a number of occasions during its history, such as during both World Wars, between 1926 and 1933, as well as most of the time between 1979 and 1989. In 1992, Springbank decided to restore its floor maltings that had been ceased in 1960. It remains the only distillery in Scotland where the entire process is conducted on site from floor malting to bottling. The current 10-year old expression was first launched in 2000 and is based on a mixture of both bourbon and sherry cask matured whisky.\n\nThe nose is lightly smoky at first, then turns quite fruity with pears and apples coming to the fore. Later on there is salt and a hint of lemon.\n\nThe palate is medium-bodied, oily and smoky. There are now flavours of black pepper, nuts, and malted barley, followed by a touch of brine. The salty element is back, accompanied by vanilla and cinnamon.\n\nThe finish is long and warming. Flavours of brine and vanilla sweetness round this off.\n\nThis is an absolutely cracking malt that ticked all the right boxes with me. I liked all its facets: the superbly balanced fruity and smoky nose, the oily and salty palate, as well as the long and sweet finish. A great piece of craftsmanship and a brilliant introduction to the modern Springbank core range!\n\nIt seems fitting to write about my favorite reasonably priced whisky for REVIEW 100 ON WHISKY CONNOSR!\n\nThat's right, this review is Number One Hundred! It's hard to believe I've written that many reviews for this fine website's review database.\n\nThen again, I harbor a strong passion for scotch whisky, and I rarely find myself short on words (or opinions) . . . so perhaps it's not so surprising that I've broken through the barrier of double digits, pushing onward into realm of Triumph Triples.\n\nRecently, I posted a video on Youtube of a Springbank 10 Year review at Bar Bar (Mississippi Studios) in Portland, Oregon.\n\nHere it is: www.youtube.com/watch\n\nSPRINGBANK 10 YEAR, TASTING NOTES Appearance: Au naturel, no artificial coloring or fake caramel added. NOT CHILL FILTERED. Lovely rich gold hue, not unlike the look of the air in late summer if one find's oneself in northern latitudes when the sun's angles of incidence must past through more and more atmosphere (and, often, more pollution).\n\nSmell: Pine resin, sea salted caramel, old dry sawdust, industrial creosote, slightly phenolic (although not as much as a few years ago), ocean mist, slightly waxy.\n\nTaste: Pleasantly viscous on the tongue, toffee, cardamom (hints almost of ginger), hardwood smoke, and a lovely balance of phenols cradling the sweeter notes on the palate.\n\nDelivery: A gentle embrace of alcohol stimulates the sides, back, and front of the tongue, but not the middle. Mingled in the mix there comes a really slight waxy-lemony note that hangs back and adds definition, tempering the sweetness with just the right amount of faint bitterness to keep it from becoming too cloying and sickly.\n\nFinish: Toffee, delightfully sensuous peat, slight hint of lemon zest, burning oak, burning dried moss, persimmon, wet clay, cracked pepper corns, allspice.\n\nAffect: This particular dram gently lures one into a very comfortable \"buzz.\" I know some would disagree, but I do feel that different whiskies (and types of alcohol) \"feel\" different in the system. My predominantly Northern European constitution purrs happily on a few drams of Springbank 10.\n\nCondition/age of exposed whisky: there were two fingers left in the bottle, so it was quite oxygenated, to be sure. Bar Bar most likely does not sell a great deal of Springbank because it is a brand of scotch that is not well known (and under appreciated) in Portland, Oregon, USA--a city which, incidentally, drinks a great deal of Ardbeg scotches of all sorts. Yes, Portlanders are not \"whisky heathen\" by any stretch, but they are woefully ignorant of The Power and the Glory that is Springbank! Then again, in all fairness, the crowd at Bar Bar is fairly young to understand good whisky beyond a few simply recognizable brand names and monikers.\n\nA WORD ON BOTTLING CODES Lately, I've discovered that year/day info on bottling can be seen relatively easily on the Springbanks. It's hand stamped on the back of the front label. Peer through the bottle to see the date stamp. The bottle that I have just reviewed was stamped as follows: \"12 / 142.\" This means it was bottled on the 142nd day of 2012.\n\nHISTORICAL REFERENCE So, how does a mid-2012 bottling compare with earlier bottlings of the Springbank 10, particularly circa 2009?\n\nWell, the bottle I tasted has a bit less \"wet wool\" and a bit less of what one might call \"farmy\" characteristics. Still, an amazing bargain in most stores, and a really fine ten year. I sincerely hope that Springbank distillery keeps up the tradition of making a quality ten year offering.\n\nJust to attest to how fanatical I have become, yesterday, I drove all over Portland (visiting six liquor stores over two hour's time) to locate a 2012 bottling. My persistence paid off: I was able to find two bottles that were bottled on the precise day and year as the one that I tasted at Bar Bar on Mississippi Ave. Persistence sometimes does pay off! Thank you, 2012 / 142!!!!\n\nANY REGRETS? I, for one, feel a pang of regret that I was not able to taste the legendary Springbank 10 Year 100 Proof bottled circa 2010 at 57% (Hint, hint, anyone out there care to send me a sample?). I am told that this particular bottle closely paralleled the Broras/Clynelishes back in the day that weren't aged much beyond 10-15 years but radiated \"barnyardy bravado.\" Hang on, I'm getting teary-eyed. Okay, I'm fine now.\n\nThank you for reading my 100th Review on Whisky Connosr! To the Living Waters that we love! Cheers!\n\nAnd if you caught my allusion to the old Graham Greene novel in the title of this review, pour yourself a dram of Springbank 10. Well done!\n\nI picked this up around the same time last year (November) up along side the Glendronach 12 year old as a start into the \"non-chill filtered\" world of scotch. With that being said, this review will be based on my first encounter with a non-chill filtered whisky and equally important to note - a whisky that doesn't have any E 150 (colour) added. This whisky sticks to the core \"root\" of whisky making and keeps the process as pure as possible from start to finish. Can ya tell I'm excited?!\n\nNose: A really huge smack in the face of pungent honey glazed orangey peat. Massive amounts of citrus going on here. The nose on this is huge. Like a plum of oranges and tangerines coming at me. The peat in the back is literally fighting to stay alive, and somehow it does, yet very faintly. This is quite fruity and now I'm getting a hint of smoke. Extremely timid. Dropping in some water brings out a little more wood and tames the citrus.\n\nPalate: Syrupy, oaky, woody, oily, spicy, sweet, salty, thick, WOW! Explosive and rich in nature. This is chewy scotch. A very, very faint hint of smoke, but not enough to really talk about. The prominent flavours here are a fruity, yet full-bodied salty-sweetness (perhaps sherry in this case) that bounces off the wood and light honey glazed peat that's extremely enjoyable. This is soooo good I can't stress that enough.\n\nFinish: A nice peppery and peaty roll off, with hints of honey, salt and….. I'm gonna have another pour thank you very much. The finish on this one lasts awhile and the sweet-oak-wood note lurks around for quite some time. Excellent.\n\nConclusion - A robust and complex dram. Are all non-chill filtered scotches this good? I sure hope so, I'll definitely be looking into the 15 year old from Springbank. I'm sold.\n\nI decided to wait with this bottling (longer than usual, i guess, for most). But upon tasting it now through the spring and summer i must say, at least i maid myself sure i was ready. For the reasons you shall see.\n\nNose: Apples&Apple peels, with ornage and lemon rind. Some coastal, salty and tangy malt makes a bold entry with a whiff of smoke and peat. Some salted mango, coco and cardamom tea round of the nose.\n\nPalate: The coastal, tangy malt makes a bold&juicy entry with some smoky peat. The peat is very discreet (this is not a peaty dram, there is just a hint of it). As a sidenote to the peat, this is a perfect dram for somebody in his 2nd or 3rd year as a whisky taster with a preference for Highland Park. This could even be a good step up from your Highland Park 12, although i would advise to wait a bit. Albeit the two drams have more than one thing in common.\n\nThe smoky coastal malt character then leaves to set the scene for some of the mango we witnessed on the nose, but almost like salted mango with some bitter dark chocolate. Then some coco with a bold malt note hanging on through the whole developement and finish. The malt defines the malt (heey!) because this is a very tangy malt, or in other words very rich in its taste and texture The malt takes on a medium thick form which doesn't glide over the palate but slowly creeps over, it's a thick but juicy malt, the quality most certainly makes it's presence felt through this impression on the form&palate.\n\nThe salty tangy malt comes back to round of with some oak and black pepper (alongside a heat rush, due to circumstance) and after a while when you think the finish has had it's say, a mint note makes a final encore. Pepper-mint then Spear-mint.\n\nThis malt then is, as most might already know and others already have predicted, not one for beginners. I would say to get the most of it at least 5-10 whiskies have to be sampled to try and get the most out of it. And as word of warning, i really don't say this a snob or elitist, it is simply stating the character of the malt, this one needs your time and attention for you two to get along. It won't simply bulge and deliver a flashy arrival, decent developement and that's it, this is substantial scotch single malt.\n\nIf you could pardon a video game analogy: Glenfiddich 15, Glenmorangie 10 and Highland Park 12 is level 2 on the sidescroller, whereas this Springbank 10 is not \"level\" 2 but \"World 2\" if u get my drift.\n\nTo quote my favorite scot from the movies, and from my favorite movie trilogy ever: \"You have taken your first in a larger world\"\n\nHappy Dramming!\n\n[Reposted from my Blog: See Profile]\n\nSpringbank is a composite of rarities. It is one of the very few distilleries that performs the entire distillation process from malting on-site (its own floor maltings) to bottling in its private bottling plant. In fact, it is the only fully self-sufficient distillery in Scotland. Located in Campbeltown on the lyrical Mull of Kintyre, it is also one of the few surviving distilleries (of three, with Glen Scotia and Glengyle) from a once-great region of Scotch distillation. In 1887 there were 21 distilleries in Campbeltown, and it was sometimes called \"The Whisky City.\" Hard times and a self-perpetrated degradation in quality (and thence, reputation) during the American period of Prohibition scoured the region, putting most distillers out of business.\n\nSpringbank claims that hand-turned floor maltings (as opposed to pneumatic or machine-aerated commercial maltings), while labor-intensive, yield a malt that is better because it germinates more slowly. The distillery uses traditional worm tubs, a cast-iron mash tun, and employs mechanical 'rummagers' (to prevent a buildup of burnt deposits) in the copper stills, which are heated with a combination of steam and direct oil fire. Springbank uses three stills to create a 2.8-time (not triple) distillation. For a and in-depth guided tour of Springbank distillery (and a good explanation of the 2.8-distillation thing), be sure to check out Ralfy's video tour at his website: January 2011 archive (scroll down).\n\nSpringbank also makes Longrow (a peated malt) and (new in 2006) Hazelburn (unpeated, truly triple-distilled). These, along with the distillery's flagship Springbank bottlings, are all non-chill-filtered, have no caramel coloring, and are reduced to bottling strength on-site with the same water used to produce the whisky. The water, like all Campbeltown whiskies, comes from the Crosshill Loch in the hills above the town, and is supplemented by a private well from a borehole drilled deep into the rock beneath the town.\n\nNose: Oily, non-smoky peat, hints of tar and woodchar, spicy and mossy. Salt breeze, almost savory, like the air outside a Teriyaki joint. A dash of water brings out a lot of barleywine and fresh fruit scents, dulling some of the peat.\n\nFlavor starts with smoked meats, vanilla, big wet earthy peat but no campfire. Saltiness continues with mid-palate cerealy sweetness... Complex and spicy, a bit vegetal. Water brings out a sweetness like refined white sugar, but covers up some of the eccentric meaty flavors. Definitely savory.\n\nFinish is long and complicated, more spices, salted fish, boggy peat. Evolves as it fades.\n\nSummary: This is eccentric and nuanced, challenging and satisfying. Great stuff - I can't wait to come back and discover more!\n\nNote: Noticed some black particles swirling around the glass (which I purchased at a bar). At the time I guessed barrel char that had escaped through the barrier filtering process. When I asked on twitter, I got the following response from @Springbank1828: \"More than likely is barrel char. Sometimes these wee bits manage to escape through the filter so it isn't unheard of.\"\n\nThe Springbank Distillery in Campbeltown was established in 1828 and is, together with Auchentoshan, the only distillery to employ triple distillation (although according to the Springbank website, it's two-and-a-half-times distillation). Apart from the Springbank whisky, they also produce the Longrow and Hazelburn here.\n\nThis was my first whisky from Campbeltown (one of three distilleries, together with Glengyle and Glen Scotia).\n\nThis Springbank 10 Year Old with an ABV of 46%, is a mixture (marriage?) of dram from ex-sherry casks and ex-bourbon casks.\n\nThe nose is a nice mix of tropical fruit, dried grass and wonderful peat, some vanilla and a tad of seasalt. The peat dominates more prominently than I anticipated.\n\nThis is a full bodied dram, coating your tongue and mouth in a very pleasant way. The smokiness remains and is emphasized with some notes of nutmeg and chili peppers. The oak dries your mouth. The saltiness remains as well, albeit somewhat in the background.\n\nThe finish reminds me of the kind of chalk teachers used to write on blackboards with. It's only medium lenght but very nice. Sweetness and saltiness go hand in hand.\n\nFor a whisky of only 10 years of age, there is a lot going on. A rather complex dram, very much worthy of your attention. A little masterpiece."
