        "text": "1. Carl Heastie\n\nAssembly Speaker\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul has quickly learned that while she may be the chief executive, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and his state Senate counterpart, Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, are a formidable bloc not to be trifled with. Heastie maintains a strong hold on his large caucus and is a tough negotiator. The Assembly’s 100th speaker is the body’s fourth-longest serving leader and is in a position to serve as long as he likes. The former boss of the last broadly successful, traditional county party in New York City, Heastie still has Bronx firmly in his grasp.\n\n2. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n\nMember of Congress\n\nDespite declining opportunities for higher office, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has one of the largest bully pulpits in American politics. Locally, she is weighing in on New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams’ budget policies and has emerged as a vocal critic of Mayor Eric Adams. She announced $15 million in federal funding for her Bronx/Queens district, including $205,500 to create a literacy program, $1 million for Westchester Square Plaza traffic safety and $845,026 to expand social and mental health services to victims of violent crime.\n\n3. Jamaal Bailey\n\nState Senator and Chair, Bronx Democratic Executive Committee\n\nHolding onto the coalitions that make up the Bronx Democrats is no easy task, but state Sen. Jamaal Bailey has been up to the task since taking over the chairmanship in 2021. Backed by Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, Bailey has succeeded in stabilizing and, to an extent, democratizing the Bronx machine, even as bids to oust nonaligned progressives have fallen short. He remains close to Gov. Kathy Hochul, having reportedly been a lieutenant governor runner-up – and as the only state Senate Judiciary Committee Democrat to vote for Hector LaSalle for state chief judge.\n\n4. Rafael Salamanca Jr.\n\nChair, New York City Council Land Use Committee\n\nAs chair of the New York City Council Land Use Committee, Rafael Salamanca Jr. has overseen some of New York City’s most consequential development decisions in recent memory, from the Bruckner Boulevard rezoning and the approval of the massive Innovation QNS project in Astoria, to the failed (but not yet dead) Harlem One45 project. A powerful voice behind the push to remodel office space into residential housing, Salamanca’s reach is expanding: His longtime chief of staff, John Zaccaro Jr., joined the Assembly earlier this year.\n\n5. Darcel Clark\n\nBronx District Attorney\n\nWhen Gov. Kathy Hochul came to New York City to highlight the bail law changes she secured in the state budget, Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark stood at the governor’s side with several of her counterparts. But no other city district attorney fought harder for the changes and other revisions to the criminal code like discovery – although those specific efforts ultimately fizzled this year. Even as progressives mount a primary challenge, Clark is all but certain to secure her third term later this year.\n\n6. Ritchie Torres\n\nMember of Congress\n\nRep. Ritchie Torres is unafraid to forge his own path as a young outspoken progressive from the Bronx. Torres, a staunch supporter of Israel, carved out niches in cryptocurrency policy and teamed with Brooklyn/Manhattan Rep. Dan Goldman to file an ethics complaint against embattled Long Island Rep. George Santos and introduce the Santos Act. Despite angered progressives, Torres has little to worry about as an incumbent in one of the bluest districts in the country where his predecessor served for 30 years.\n\n7. Gustavo Rivera\n\nState Senator\n\nState Sen. Gustavo Rivera is a survivor. After redistricting left him as a man without a district, Rivera beat back a challenger supported by the Bronx Democrats, Reps. Adriano Espaillat and Ritchie Torres, Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz and hundreds of thousands in super PAC money that went toward digital ads, mailers, phone banks and polling. The outspoken progressive and veteran reformer uses his gavel on the state Senate Health Committee to push for broader health policies, including universal health care.\n\n8. Vanessa Gibson\n\nBronx Borough President\n\nIn the two years since Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson won a tough, fractured Democratic primary, she’s worked with stakeholders from U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and New York City Mayor Eric Adams to public defenders and cannabis entrepreneurs to build a better future for the borough. She believes cannabis could be an “economic engine” for the Bronx, formed task forces to assist crime victims and improve the health of the state’s unhealthiest county. And she has an outside shot of helping secure what her predecessors were unable to for nearly 30 years: a purpose for the Kingsbridge Armory.\n\n9. Adriano Espaillat\n\nMember of Congress\n\nWhile the majority of Rep. Adriano Espaillat’s district is in Upper Manhattan, few in the Bronx can match the influence and power he and his organization wield. Beholden to no one but himself, Espaillat is a key ally of New York City Mayor Eric Adams, the central figure behind Dominican political power in the city, a champion of Latino representation in the state and an influential member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who brings the concerns of immigrants to the ears of President Joe Biden.\n\n10. Jamaal Bowman\n\nMember of Congress\n\nRep. Jamaal Bowman’s star has only grown since beating longtime incumbent Eliot Engel in 2020. He pushed back against TikTok ban proposals and aligned himself with the Tennessee Three. He’s gone viral yelling at a Republican colleague about gun control in the halls of Congress and drowning out Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene outside former President Donald Trump’s arraignment in Manhattan. A brash progressive critical of the Biden administration over policy differences, Bowman is perfectly capable of working with Democratic leadership, offering high praise for House Democrats’ new leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries.\n\n11. George Alvarez, Michael Benedetto, Kenny Burgos, Jeffrey Dinowitz, Chantel Jackson, Latoya Joyner, Karines Reyes, Amanda Septimo, Yudelka Tapia, John Zaccaro Jr.\n\nAssembly Members\n\nAssembly Speaker Carl Heastie of the Bronx is the most influential lawmaker in his legislative chamber, but he isn’t the only important Bronxite serving in the Assembly. Among Heastie’s allies in his home borough are Assembly Member Latoya Joyner, who chairs the influential Labor Committee, Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz, who chairs the Codes Committee, and Assembly Member Michael Benedetto, who chairs the Education Committee. Assembly Members Kenny Burgos, a rising star in the Democratic Party, and Karines Reyes have also made their marks as policymakers, with Reyes now chairing the Puerto Rican/Hispanic Task Force. Among the newer Assembly members from the borough are Amanda Septimo, Chantel Jackson and Yudelka Tapia, who all took office in 2021, as well as John Zaccaro Jr. and George Alvarez, who were first elected last fall.\n\n12. Stanley Schlein\n\nAttorney\n\nPoliticians come and go, but Stanley Schlein remains. Eighteen years ago, The New York Times dubbed him the “Power Behind Several Thrones,” but many who held the thrones in that article have little relevance today. Yet, there Schlein was in December, needling Republican Lester Chang on behalf of Assembly Democrats. And there he is, in lobbying filings, collecting tens of thousands a month from the Yankees, Dominion Voting Systems and casino operators. And there he is again, in campaign finance filings, bringing in thousands and thousands more from candidates up and down the ballot, from civil court judge to mayor.\n\n13. Randy Levine\n\nPresident, New York Yankees\n\nThe New York Yankees’ political might matches their baseball prowess pouring tens of thousands into the gubernatorial campaigns of both Gov. Kathy Hochul and Lee Zeldin at Randy Levine’s direction. Levine led the Bronx Bombers, worth billions, in the effort to bring back their latest historical – and literal – giant, Aaron Judge, keeping him in the borough for the next nine years. And Levine took a seat on the board of AC Milan, one of Europe’s most successful and wealthy soccer clubs, after the Yankees bought a minority stake last year.\n\n14. Betty Rosa\n\nCommissioner, State Education Department\n\nThe leader of New York’s education system, Betty Rosa has waded into some of the most high-profile education debates in the state and country, from opposing charter school expansion and demanding New York City to conclude its yearslong investigation into yeshivas, to banning Native American school mascots and pushing back on Rep. Elise Stefanik’s claim that the state was providing instruction on critical race theory. Looking ahead, Rosa has called for the state to provide more funding for early childhood education and create vocational schools.\n\n15. Philip Ozuah\n\nPresident and CEO, Montefiore Medicine\n\nDr. Philip Ozuah helms one of the Bronx’s most important institutions, Montefiore Medicine, which employs, cares for and educates thousands of people in the Bronx. He’s so far successfully navigated a wave of unionization efforts and a dayslong nurses strike, securing an agreement in the latter case. In May, Ozuah, a pediatrics professor at Montefiore-affiliated Albert Einstein College of Medicine, was named to the board of directors for The Cigna Group, the multibillion-dollar health care conglomerate.\n\n16. Diana Ayala, Eric Dinowitz, Amanda Farías, Oswald Feliz, Kevin Riley, Pierina Sanchez, Althea Stevens, Marjorie Velázquez\n\nNew York City Council Members\n\nOne of the perks that comes with serving in the New York City Council is the traditional veto power over major land use projects or rezonings within a district. Yet, when New York City Council Member Marjorie Velázquez gave the green light last fall to the Bruckner Boulevard rezoning in Throggs Neck, her late-breaking support for the controversial plan to pave the way for more affordable housing may have been to save face – and save the practice known as member deference. Like several of her Bronx colleagues, Velázquez took office just last year, although Council Member Kevin Riley, who won a special election at the end of 2020, and Council Members Eric Dinowitz (the son of Assembly Member Jeffrey Dinowitz) and Oswald Feliz, who both won spring 2021 special elections, all have just a little more seniority. Among the borough’s first-term City Council members, Althea Stevens picked up a nice assignment chairing the Youth Services Committee, Pierina Sanchez chairs the key Housing and Buildings Committee and Amanda Farías leads the Economic Development Committee. New York City Council Member Diana Ayala resides in East Harlem, but part of her district extends into the South Bronx. Ayala, who’s in the council leadership as deputy speaker, has rejected arguments that the Bronx portion of her district is overlooked. She has also served as co-chair of the Bronx delegation.\n\n17. Adolfo Carrión Jr.\n\nCommissioner, New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development\n\nAs New York City Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul try to work with lawmakers to address New York’s housing woes, it’s up to Adolfo Carrión Jr. to manage the city’s affordable housing stock as commissioner of the city Department of Housing Preservation and Development. A former Bronx borough president, onetime independent mayoral candidate, inaugural director of the Obama-era White House Office of Urban Affairs and former federal housing official, Carrión’s story is far from over, but his latest chapter could be his most consequential yet.\n\n18. Phillip Grant\n\nCEO, Hunts Point Produce Market\n\nEveryone from New York City Mayor Eric Adams to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg wants to help Hunts Point Produce Market expand. The produce market’s CEO Phillip Grant has seen his vision for renovating and expanding the market receive $100 million from Adams and $110 million from Buttigieg. The funds will implement Grant’s vision for a 1 million-square-foot facility with 800,000 of refrigerated space and a new intermodal transportation facility.\n\n19. Paloma Izquierdo-Hernandez\n\nPresident and CEO, Urban Health Plan\n\nAs president and CEO of Urban Health Plan, Paloma Izquierdo-Hernandez runs one of the Bronx’s largest health care providers and employers. In November, an Urban Health Plan partnership with two local development corporations won a $10 million grand prize in a state clean transportation contest for The Bronx is Breathing: Reimaging a Cleaner Hunts Point project. The project will help to alleviate pollution in the South Bronx by investing in electric vehicles, a charging hub and new worker-owned trucking business with a zero-emission fleet.\n\n20. José M. Serrano & Luis Sepúlveda\n\nState Senators\n\nOpting not to run for the congressional seat vacated by his father, the longtime Rep. José E. Serrano, state Sen. José M. Serrano has established himself as the Senate’s point person on the arts. He chairs the majority conference and the state Senate Cultural Affairs, Tourism, Parks and Recreation Committee. He is often found pushing for environmental stewardship and promoting the state’s artistic and cultural offerings. He chaired the New York City Council’s Cultural Affairs Committee before becoming the longtime top Democrat on the Senate’s arts panel.\n\nState Sen. Luis Sepúlveda weathered a domestic violence allegation (which was ultimately dropped) to find himself back in the good graces of Democrats, only to again anger his colleagues for embracing Dominican politics despite not being of Dominican descent. But the lawmaker, who was granted Dominican citizenship at the country’s presidential palace last year, has soldiered on, advocating for Dominican New Yorkers and forging ties with leaders from the Dominican Republic. His international friendships are not restricted to the Western Hemisphere: He has developed a close relationship with Japanese officials.\n\n21. Nathalia Fernandez\n\nState Senator\n\nState Sen. Nathalia Fernandez has kept busy since leaving the Assembly and winning the Senate seat vacated by Alessandra Biaggi. In Albany, she has been a prolific bill writer during her first year in the Senate, which she joined as part of the chamber’s first all-women freshman class. As chair of the Alcoholism and Substance Use Disorders Committee, Fernandez has advocated for new policies to tackle addiction and overdoses, including the funding and approval of overdose prevention centers.\n\n22. Meisha Porter\n\nPresident and CEO, The Bronx Community Foundation\n\nThe first Black woman to lead the nation’s largest school district, New York City’s former schools Chancellor Meisha Porter, a longtime Bronx educator, is now the inaugural president and CEO of The Bronx Community Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to producing more equitable and just outcomes for the often ignored borough. Recent initiatives include a partnership with The Bronx Defenders to launch The Bronx Cannabis Hub and funding on-the-ground organizations working with asylum-seekers.\n\n23. Daniel J. Kane Jr.\n\nPresident, Teamsters Local 202\n\nIn perhaps a sign of what was to come as the United States entered a new era of union-building, Teamsters Local 202 President Daniel J. Kane Jr. led his workers on their first strike since the 1980s in 2021 and successfully secured their biggest pay increase in over 30 years. A little over a year after the strike, the fourth-generation Teamster was named an international trustee of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which has over 1.2 million members in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n24. Fernando Delgado\n\nPresident, Lehman College\n\nGuiding the Bronx’s largest public college, Fernando Delgado has helped bring in funding to expand Lehman College’s offerings, including launching a new business school and a partnership with nearby Albert Einstein College of Medicine to launch a master’s program in biological sciences. The CUNY college has drawn international attention as well, after visits in the last year from the Lviv National Philharmonic Orchestra of Ukraine and the Duke of Gloucester, a first cousin of the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n25. Justine Olderman\n\nExecutive Director, The Bronx Defenders\n\nPublic defenders in New York City are woefully underfunded compared to prosecutors, but The Bronx Defenders Executive Director Justine Olderman is working to level the playing field. She, along with her counterparts in other boroughs, are pushing for a combined $125 million in the city budget to combat attrition and manage caseloads, including 20,000 a year in the Bronx. A frequent critic of Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Olderman signed onto a statement calling the bail reform rollbacks in the state budget “unconscionable” and “disturbing.”\n\n26. Christopher Mastromano & Christopher Roker\n\nCEO; Chief Growth Officer, NYC Health + Hospitals/Jacobi and NYC Health + Hospitals/North Central Bronx; NYC Health + Hospitals/Lincoln\n\nThe Bronx’s public hospitals are as vital, if not more so, than their private counterparts to the health outcomes for the borough’s residents. Christopher Mastromano oversaw the merging of Jacobi and North Central Bronx Hospitals under unified leadership and manages a nearly billion-dollar budget with over 4,000 employees. Christopher Roker, NYC Health+Hospitals/Lincoln chief growth officer, manages operations at Lincoln Hospital, a more than 175-year-old institution that has among the busiest Level 1 trauma centers in the Northeast.\n\n27. Marcos Crespo & Ruben Diaz Jr.\n\nSenior Vice President of Community Affairs; Senior Vice President of Strategic Initiatives, Montefiore Medical Center\n\nSome may leave elective office but never really leave. Montefiore Medical Center is not the only thing keeping former Bronx Democratic Party Chair and Assembly Member Marcos Crespo and former Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. in the borough’s political game. Gov. Kathy Hochul pulled Diaz out of retirement to boost Hector LaSalle’s state chief judge nomination. Both men dabble in lobbying, for Montefiore and other clients. Diaz has advocated for Charter Communications with the firm Actum and Crespo has helped casino operator Bally’s Corp. in a push to build a casino atop former President Donald Trump’s Throggs Neck golf course.\n\n28. Lisa Sorin\n\nPresident, Bronx Chamber of Commerce\n\nAs if leading the charge for Bronx businesses wasn’t enough, Bronx Chamber of Commerce President Lisa Sorin has taken on the region’s mass transit system and redistricting. Sorin was appointed to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board by Gov. Kathy Hochul and by Mayor Eric Adams to the commission that redrew New York City Council districts. In her day job as an advocate for the Bronx business community, Sorin has aligned herself with Rep. Ritchie Torres as a believer in the power of cryptocurrency to revitalize the borough.\n\n29. Lorraine Cortés-Vázquez\n\nCommissioner, New York City Department for the Aging\n\nA former New York secretary of state, Lorraine Cortés-Vázquez was originally selected by former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to lead the city Department for the Aging, a job Mayor Eric Adams asked her to keep. She signed onto the Latinos for LaSalle effort backing Gov. Kathy Hochul’s first pick for state chief judge, Hector LaSalle, organized by political consultant Luis Miranda Jr., who pushed Hochul to consider Cortés-Vázquez to replace former Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin last year. She is a CUNY trustee and a former MTA board member.\n\n30. Lourdes Zapata\n\nPresident and CEO, South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corp.\n\nA former state chief diversity officer, Lourdes Zapata is entering her fourth year as president and CEO of the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corp., where she oversees the creation of affordable and special needs housing, as well as youth and workforce development programming. In March, SoBro joined forces with Maddd Equities to purchase a $44 million, seven-story former warehouse containing hundreds of thousands of square feet of recently remodeled office and retail space, for possible use for community groups, medical offices or the arts.\n\n31. Tania Tetlow\n\nPresident, Fordham University\n\nThe first woman and layperson to lead the Bronx’s largest and most storied university has worked to preserve Fordham University’s legacy while embracing its future. Tania Tetlow has embraced social justice as a central plank of her presidency and is not afraid to buck the Catholic Church when she believes it's in the best interest of Fordham University. In April, she interviewed U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a Bronx native, for a Fordham University School of Law event.\n\n32. Don Eversley\n\nExecutive Director, Greater Hunts Point Economic Development Corp.\n\nWith Hunts Point in the crosshairs of policymakers and Bronx stakeholders looking to transform the borough into a healthier, more livable place, Don Eversley is at the forefront of the effort to revitalize the neighborhood. He helped author the “Hunts Point Forward” plan backed by a $40 million promise from New York City Mayor Eric Adams and called for the closure of the Vernon C. Bain Center prison barge, the repurposing of city-owned vacant land, job creation, ending food deserts and improving traffic in the heavily polluted neighborhood.\n\n33. Mark Stagg\n\nFounder and CEO, Stagg Group\n\nAs he’s built thousands of affordable housing units in the Bronx and Westchester over the decades, Mark Stagg has become a friend to the communities he works in – by handing out thousands of turkeys on Thanksgiving or donating compost to Mosholu Parkland – and to local elected officials – by pouring tens of thousands into their coffers. Ritchie Torres, Ruben Diaz Jr., Eliot Engel, Letitia James, Andrew Cuomo, Rob Astorino, Mark Gjonaj and Joe Crowley are some of the New York politicians who have benefitted from his generosity. He’s also a former associate of Adolfo Carrión Jr., a former Bronx borough president who’s now a top housing official at City Hall.\n\n34. Monica Medina, Robb Menzi & John F. Calvelli\n\nPresident and CEO; Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President; Executive Vice President of Public Affairs, Wildlife Conservation Society\n\nThe Wildlife Conservation Society, best known for running the Bronx Zoo, has been undergoing a leadership transition over the last year. Fresh off a stint as the nation’s top oceans, environment and science diplomat, Monica Medina is now the Society’s new president and CEO, succeeding Robb Menzi, who has been interim president and CEO over the last year. Menzi returns to his role as chief operating officer and executive vice president. Medina’s road to the Bronx included stops as a Pentagon adviser on ending sexual assault in the military, as principal deputy undersecretary for oceans and atmosphere at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a U.S. commissioner of the International Whaling Commission and as deputy associate U.S. attorney general, overseeing the Environment Division. Rounding out the Society’s top team is John F. Calvelli, the organization’s longtime public face, who represents the Society to city, state and federal policymakers to grow support for issues ranging from the Bronx Zoo to managing conservation programs in almost 60 countries.\n\n35. Susan R. Burns\n\nPresident, College of Mount Saint Vincent\n\nIn her third year at the helm of the 175-year-old Riverdale Catholic college, Susan R. Burns has overseen a period of growth and accomplishment. Then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stopped by for a town hall alongside Rep. Jamaal Bowman last year, the college launched the Bronx’s first physician assistant program, and Burns secured $2.8 million in federal funds to serve the College of Mount Saint Vincent’s Hispanic student population, which makes up one-third of undergraduates.\n\n36. Daisy Cocco De Filippis\n\nPresident, Hostos Community College\n\nHelmed by President Daisy Cocco De Filippis as it enters its 55th year, Hostos Community College continues to serve the South Bronx’s Hispanic and Black communities, who make up 95% of the student population. Enrollment was up more than 7% in 2023, and the school has garnered the support of billionaire MacKenzie Scott, who gave the school $15 million to fund scholarships and a new research center. Cocco De Filippis also serves on the “New” New York Panel formed by Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Eric Adams.\n\n37. Miguel Fuentes\n\nPresident and CEO, BronxCare Health System\n\nIn the Bronx, health issues have always been significant – and nonprofit health providers like BronxCare Health System play a vital role. BronxCare boasts 859 beds and more than 4,500 employees across two hospital divisions, a large outpatient network, a 10,000-square-foot cancer facility and other programs, serving nearly 1 million people a year. Miguel Fuentes’ teaching hospital system avoided a nurses strike earlier this year, coming to an agreement with the union as other private hospitals failed to.\n\n38. Carlos Naudon\n\nPresident and CEO, Ponce Bank\n\nAfter the recent banking scare, Carlos Naudon felt something was missing from the conversation about “systemically important” banks, a discussion of what Naudon calls “systemically critical banks.” Among these overlooked financial institutions is Naudon’s Ponce Bank, which focuses on underserved communities. His bank’s clientele are largely Latino New Yorkers. In April, the U.S. Department of Treasury gave the bank $3.7 million to help low-income communities and designated it a Community Development Financial Institution, providing access to additional federal funding set aside for communities who traditionally struggle to get capital and services from major financial institutions.\n\n39. Larry Scott Blackmon\n\nFounder and CEO, The Blackmon Organization\n\nLarry Scott Blackmon, the New York politics journeyman, took his talents to FreshDirect nearly a decade ago as their vice president of public affairs to help present their agenda in the Bronx and beyond to stakeholders, while also leveraging his position and relationships to help feed a borough struggling with food insecurity. During the first few years of the COVID-19 pandemic, Blackmon helped distribute over 6 million pounds of food to needy New Yorkers. He also heads up his own firm, The Blackmon Organization.\n\nEditor’s note: Larry Scott Blackmon is a member of City & State’s advisory board.\n\n40. Mychal Johnson\n\nCo-Founder, South Bronx Unite\n\nThe policies Mychal Johnson, the co-founder of South Bronx Unite, has been pushing for years to help alleviate the pollution and oppressive infrastructure plaguing the South Bronx is gaining support from U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Rep. Ritchie Torres. Johnson and his allies in the Bronx environmental movement are pushing to cap the Cross Bronx Expressway, curb truck traffic and build more green spaces in the South Bronx. Schumer has announced $12.5 billion in federal infrastructure dollars to help cover the cost of this project.\n\n41. Nilka Martell\n\nFounder and Director, Loving the Bronx\n\nLoving the Bronx Director Nilka Martell knows the risks of the Cross Bronx Expressway’s pollution well, having rushed her infant son to the hospital after his lips turned blue – and then learning he had asthma. Years later, she is still fighting for clean air, and $12.5 billion in federal funding has been provided to begin the process of capping the highway. The project will take years to complete and, in the meantime, Martell joined Rep. Ritchie Torres to warn that congestion pricing in Manhattan threatens to increase pollution in the Bronx.\n\n42. Sandra Lobo\n\nExecutive Director, Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition\n\nKnown for their fervent advocacy for tenants rights, among other progressive policies, the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition and their Executive Director Sandra Lobo are playing a key role in mapping the future of the Bronx. They have moved to acquire land as part of a community land trust to build affordable housing on abandoned properties. Lobo is also leading a working group alongside New York City Council Member Pierina Sanchez to map a path forward for the long-vacant Kingsbridge Armory that Lobo also wants to be community-owned.\n\n43. Jason Laidley\n\nSenior Vice President of Government Relations, Moonshot Strategies\n\nA longtime Bronx Democratic playmaker, Jason Laidley served as state Sen. Jamaal Bailey’s chief of staff, worked as a special assistant to state Attorney General Letitia James during her run for New York City public advocate and served on Mayor Eric Adams’ transition team. These days, while still chipping in during campaign season, Laidley works as senior vice president of government relations for Moonshot Strategies and lobbies through his own firm, London House, on behalf of clients like Charter Communications and Grubhub.\n\n44. Daniel Reingold\n\nPresident and CEO, RiverSpring Living\n\nAs the years go on, Daniel Reingold and RiverSpring Living, the parent organization of the storied senior care facility Hebrew Home at Riverdale, continues to innovate. A nationally recognized leader in senior care who made headlines for the Hebrew Home’s sex-positive policies and usage of medicinal cannabis, as well as his pioneering role in the creation of elder abuse shelters, Reingold’s latest initiative is a cogeneration power plant that captures the heat produced by making electricity, to be reused instead of wasted.\n\n45. Ramon Tallaj\n\nFounder and Chair, Somos Community Care\n\nDr. Ramon Tallaj is many things, a doctor, a community leader and the star of an Emmy award-winning documentary. The founder of Somos Community Care, Tallaj’s work during COVID-19 was the centerpiece of the documentary, “Doctor Tallaj: The Hispanic Who Faced COVID-19 in New York.” Somos Community Care, headquartered in the Bronx, is a network of over 2,600 culturally competent health care providers. His leadership during the pandemic, providing 1.5 million people with free testing, earned him a spot as co-chair on New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ COVID-19 Recovery Roundtable and Health Equity Task Force.\n\n46. Rosa Gil\n\nFounder, President and CEO, Comunilife\n\nFounded by Rosa Gil in 1989, Comunilife provides housing, health care and culturally sensitive support services to New York City’s Latino community, specifically to homeless New Yorkers, new immigrants and people living with HIV/AIDS or mental illness. Comunlife’s portfolio includes over 3,000 units of housing, most recently adding 148 units of affordable housing at a Morrisania development praised by Gov. Kathy Hochul. Gil’s influence spreads to banking and economic policy as a member of the board of directors for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\n47. Wilma Alonso\n\nPresident and CEO, Fordham Road Business Improvement District\n\nAfter serving nearly two decades as executive director and now as president and CEO of the Fordham Road Business Improvement District, Wilma Alonso remains a force in the neighborhood’s business community, fighting for existing small businesses even as she welcomes major chains like Target and Five Below. Public safety is one of Alonso’s chief concerns. She joined Bronx business leaders last year to demand changes to the state’s bail laws and helped organize private security for businesses in her district.\n\n48. Gordon F. Tomaselli\n\nDean, Albert Einstein College of Medicine\n\nAmong the country’s premier medical schools, the Montefiore-run Albert Einstein College of Medicine received a major boon in March: a $100 million contribution from an anonymous donor, the largest in the college’s history. The donation capped Dr. Gordon F. Tomaselli’s five-year tenure as dean, one that will end this summer and cemented his legacy as a fundraiser. In 2022, Tomaselli led the college in receiving $202 million from the National Institutes of Health\n\n49. Plinio Ayala\n\nPresident and CEO, Per Scholas\n\nA born and bred Bronxite, Plinio Ayala has grown Per Scholas as president and CEO for the last 20 years, expanding the technology workforce development nonprofit’s footprint in the Bronx and beyond.
