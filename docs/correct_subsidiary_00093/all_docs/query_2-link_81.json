        "text": "I’ve been delaying this review for quite some time, not because I lacked the desire to do it, but because I felt a profound responsibility to do justice to such a revered brand. Springbank is a distillery that stands amidst a whirlwind of hype, accolades, contentious secondary market pricing, and relentless pursuit by enthusiasts. Yet, at its heart, it remains a bastion of tradition, holding steadfast to time-honoured, handmade techniques. This brand is woven into the tapestry of Campbeltown, an integral part of its rich heritage.\n\nSpringbank, Scotland’s oldest independent family-owned distillery, boasts a heritage that traces its roots to an illicit still and a passion for the art of distillation. The Mitchell family, pioneers of Springbank, arrived in Campbeltown in the 1660s, having migrated from the lowlands. Among their ranks were individuals skilled in the craft of malting. In 1828, Archibald Mitchell embarked on a historic journey by establishing Springbank Distillery, thereby earning distinction as the 14th licensed distillery in Campbeltown—over 150 years after his family’s settlement in the town.\n\nOver the ensuing years, Springbank’s reputation, along with Campbeltown malts as a whole, experienced a meteoric ascent. Campbeltown itself earned a distinguished reputation as the most prosperous town in Britain, boasting its wealth. Springbank’s whiskey, like the distillery itself, weathered the tests of time admirably. As the years passed, a growing number of distilleries attempted to take shortcuts, ultimately causing customers to lose faith in Campbeltown and seek more reliably consistent malt elsewhere. Alongside evolving palates, these factors led to the unfortunate closure of many long-established distilleries in the region.\n\nYet, Springbank stood resilient amidst this shifting landscape. Although its production became sporadic, it remained one of the rare stalwarts that persevered, determined to uphold its commitment to quality and tradition. Fast forward to the present, and Springbank stands as one of just three operational distilleries in Campbeltown. The torch of heritage is carried forward not only by Springbank but also by Glengyle, also owned by J&A Mitchell and Co, and Glen Scotia. These three distilleries safeguard the rich history of a bygone era when over 30 distilleries thrived in Campbeltown during the 19th century.\n\nSpringbank distinguishes itself as the only Scottish distillery that carries out the entire production process entirely on its own premises. In an age where automation prevails, Springbank champions traditional techniques, preserving the use of the likes of worm tub condensers and direct-fired stills—methods that have become increasingly rare within the industry, which is possibly why they are so popular. Moreover, their production yields are so painfully scarce that Springbank-hunting has become the hottest, most sought-after hobby since collecting invisible unicorn horns. Consequently, the secondary market has seen an inflationary trend, with Springbank bottles commanding prices that often exceed double their initial value.\n\nToday, I have the pleasure of reviewing three of their renowned releases. I’ve managed to secure a bottle of the Springbank 10 for review. Additionally, I will also review the Springbank 11 Local Barley and the Springbank 10 PX, both of which were kindly provided as samples by the generous Phil Crawford, aka on Instagram as @causewaywhiskey. It’s worth noting that Phil is something of a Springbank aficionado, often referred to as the “Springbank king.” Although my attempts to coax him into writing a review for The Water of Life have thus far been unsuccessful, I’ll do my best to deliver a credible assessment based on his generous contributions.\n\nSpringbank 10-year-old 2023 Release\n\nABV: 46%\n\nPrice: £49.99….good luck Springbank hunting…\n\nNose: you’re immediately greeted with big notes of rum and raisin ice cream. A luscious, syrupy essence of prunes lingers, accompanied by a subtle touch of nuttiness and the subtleness of orange peel. Beneath it all, there’s an intriguing earthiness, akin to damp wood or freshly cut wet hay. Hints of brown sugar and a delicate trace of marzipan.\n\nPalate: The texture of this is something else. It begins with a comforting warmth, like ginger snaps, cinnamon, and a gentle note of black pepper. Then, a delightful fusion of light orange and abundant milk chocolate takes centre stage. There’s even a subtle note of caramel, enhancing the whiskey’s viscosity and adding an element of indulgent sweetness. A touch of smokiness adds a decent level of depth .\n\nFinish: Once more, the whiskey wraps you in a blanket of warmth, accompanied by butterscotch sauce, amplified by the cinnamon spice. A menthol-infused finale leaves a refreshing and memorable mark on the palate.\n\nScore: 9/10\n\nSpringbank 10-year-old PX\n\nABV: 55%\n\nPrice: £100….good luck Springbank hunting…\n\nNose: a lovely medley of fruits, with dark cherries, plums, and abundant figs. Complementing this fruit medley is the presence of syrupy prunes and a hint of spice, primarily in the form of cinnamon. Lots of raisins and sultanas, reminiscent of a Christmas cake, is generously soaked in the nose. Turkish delight makes an appearance in the background.\n\nPalate: Upon the first sip there’s an intriguing combination of flavours. Flat cherry coke meets a subtle kick of spice, with cinnamon and nutmeg leading the way. Remarkably, despite its richness, there are no overwhelming traces of an overpowering cask influence. The palate continues with more stoned fruits, stewed plums and an abundance of maraschino cherries.\n\nFinish: The finish is warming and spicy. Cinnamon and nutmeg emerge victorious once again, accompanied by a resurgence of cherry coke. This whiskey’s balance of flavours and its delightful, lingering spice is delightful.\n\nScore: 6/10\n\nSpringbank 11 Local Barley\n\nABV: 55.1%\n\nPrice: £110….good luck Springbank hunting…\n\nNose: On the nose, this whiskey greets you with a burst of spice, dominated by the unmistakable aroma of aniseed and a touch of clove. Hints of wood add a pleasant depth to the nose, with notes of sawn cedar and pencil shavings making an appearance. Underneath it all, there’s a subtle sweetness, evoking notes of giant strawberries and unripe bananas.\n\nPalate: As you take a sip, the warmth spreads through your mouth, but it’s refined, and doesn’t overpower. The spice from the nose returns with a vengeance, with cinnamon and clove taking the lead this time. The sweetness is more pronounced now, reminiscent of sticky toffee pudding drizzled with cinnamon sugar. The texture is velvety and luxurious, with a beautiful viscosity that coats your tongue.\n\nFinish: long and satisfying, with the warmth lingering on your palate. As it begins to fade, the whiskey takes on a creamy character, with hints of milk chocolate and a subtle hint of chili.\n\nScore: 7.5/10\n\nSummary\n\nWell, that was a quality mix of Springbanks. It is easy to understand why it is so sought after and why people are chasing it so devotedly.\n\nLet’s begin with the entry core expression. Remarkably, this 10-year-old whisky defies its age. It showcases a massive spectrum of flavours and textures that are unprecedented. Within its flavour profile, you’ll discover a beautiful mixture of sweetness, spice, and just the perfect hint of smokiness. The texture is nothing short of fantastic.\n\nThe ‘Local Barley’ represents an annual tradition, crafted from barley nurtured in Campbeltown. Every year, a dedicated local farmer takes on the mission of cultivating barley to sustain this ‘grain to glass’ limited edition. This release serves as a resounding tribute to their passion and craftsmanship, a fact evident in every sip. What consistently stands out in the vast array of Springbanks I’ve had the pleasure of tasting is their exceptional balance, and ‘Local Barley’ is no exception. It offers a perfect blend of sweetness, spice, and depth that pervades the palate.\n\nWith the PX 10, it showcased the most sensational nose which made me really look forward to what seemed like a quality PX maturation. However, the palate, whilst still good, didn’t quite reach the zenith set by its nose. It carried a delightful sweetness that consistently lingered, but I feel it may have fallen slightly short in terms of flavour profile and profound depth unlike the other two. Nonetheless, it is still a good example of a PX-matured whisky.\n\nAnd there you have it, three quality Springbanks that have left a mark on my palate, leaving me yearning for more. While I may not have considered myself one of those ardent Springbank chasers/hunters before, I am now re-evaluating my stance. These whiskies serve as a shining testament to the dedication that goes into their whiskies, offering a truly exquisite example of masterful craftsmanship."
