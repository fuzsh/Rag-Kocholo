        "text": "Global Swift Current\n\nMeet the Moose Jaw & Swift Current Area Manager\n\nCurtis PereverzoffArea Manager, Moose Jaw & Swift Current\n\nCurtis brings an honest, demanding, but fair approach to coaching. He pushed his players to be the best version of themselves on and off the ice. Curtis believes the best results and growth as a person and player are achieved outside their comfort zones. Curtis was born in Kamloops, BC and grew up in Nelson. He currently lives in Moose Jaw, and has his Bachelor of Education from the University of Victoria. Curtis strives to help move player to Junior hockey and to always be a contact for past players, whether its a university or work reference and supports the journey during and life after sport. He leads his coaching style with encouraging players to have a plan and goals. The plan can continue to change and be altered, but challenges youth-athletes to make sure everything is done in a meaningful way and with purpose.\n\nHelping student-athletes build successful futures inSPORTACADEMICSLIFE\n\nProgram Details:\n\nGrade 5-8 Hockey Program\n\nApplicable to All Saints Catholic Elementary School students\n\nLocation: All Saints Catholic Elementary / iPlex Arena / Various off-site locations\n\nCadence: Half-time program\n\nStudent-athletes attend Global every other day throughout the school year\n\nOn the days that Global occurs, Global will take up the last two periods of the day from 1:40pm-3:05pm\n\nTransportation is provided one way from the school to the arena on the days we are on the ice (families will be required to pick up their student-athletes from the arena)\n\nEquipment storage at the arena is available\n\nMandatory apparel package of $300 + TAX is applied to Registration Fees\n\nPricing: $3,360+ TAX\n\nProgram Breakdown\n\nSport-Specific Training Hours\n\n45+\n\nAthletics/Training Hours\n\n35+\n\nLeadership Education Sessions\n\n10\n\nCommunication, Advocacy & Reporting\n\n3 Report Cards\n\n2 Parent/Coach Meetings (one per semester in person or video call)\n\n5 Athlete interim reports to parents\n\n~20 Bi-weekly general update communications\n\nSeptember\n\nAs our student-athletes enter the school year, we focus on integrating the group with each other, introducing multi-sport athletics, and begin our leadership training and personal development in courses that could include; Leadership Fundamentals, Coaching and Officiating, Building your Personal Brand, Healthy Relationships and more.\n\nOctober - April\n\nFrom October - April, Global Sport Academy delivers sport-specific, on-ice hours integrated with continued multi-sport and training sessions.

But from the first ice time the kids were constantly moving, getting lots of puck touches and having fun. Luke always leaves global with lots to talk about, whether its new drills, different skills or telling us about how much fun he had. We are firm believers in skill development and this program provides the opportunity to develop your skills and challenge yourself against others. We would definitely recommend this program to others, who have like minded players who want to put the effort in and who want to get better.\"\n\n\"Our sons first year with Global Sport Academy has been nothing but a positive experience. Our son loves the afternoon sessions. He has grown so much as an individual and as a leader under Curtis’s guidance. With Curtis as the area manager and his team’s head coach this has been the best year of hockey for our son and for us as parents. We would recommend this program to any athlete who wants to take their game to the next level.\"\n\n\"As a family, our interaction with the Global Sport Academy program has been very positive. We have been so impressed with the time and effort that all facilitators have put into planning and developing activities, both on and off the ice. Every attempt has been made to create a program that is not only focused on the core values but is also *fun* for the athletes. It is very obvious that all staff involved genuinely care. We see this in both the hockey aspect of the academy, but also the schooling and academic aspect.\"\n\nKey Outcomes\n\n1\n\nPREPARE\n\nOur aim is to assist students and graduates in preparing for the next stage of their lives, in and out of sport.\n\n2\n\nPASSION\n\nYoung athletes who possess a genuine passion, a diverse range of experiences, and the skills to navigate and promote themselves within the post-secondary system are likely to encounter exceptional opportunities.\n\n3\n\nACCESS\n\nWe do everything we can to support and connect athletes seeking opportunities in Men's and Women's University and Collegiate Athletic programs across Canada and the USA, including Varsity Division 1, Division 3, and Club Teams. Additionally, we provide access to NCSA\n\n4\n\nLIFE AFTER SPORT\n\nThe journey with Global Sport Academy and Village Sports leads to the creation of a comprehensive toolbox for life.\n\nFAQ's\n\nIf I am injured, am I still part of the program?\n\nAbsolutely. The focus will shift to accommodate and work with your injury and recovery.\n\nCan I take one Semester and not the other?\n\nNo. You must ensure you plan your timetable and academic plan with the counsellors to allocate the designated period for Global. Global is designed as a full-year program.\n\nWhere do I find all of the registration information as I have questions?\n\nClick on the Button within FAQ called, \"Program Registration Policy & Refunds\".\n\nCan I do French Immersion and Global?\n\nYou will need to meet with a counsellor at the school to determine if that is a viable option.\n\nAre all Global schools and programs identical?\n\nPrograms are not identical due to things like facilities and other variables. We do the best we can though to create parallel programs that are very close.\n\nCan students be in Global and on the school teams?\n\nAbsolutely, and in fact we strongly encourage them to do so.\n\nHow elite does my child have to be in order to be eligible to participate in Global?\n\nElite is a mis-leading concept. The most important ingredients we look for in young student athletes is passion, character and determination. Our team looks at every student on an individual basis to assess if they have foundation to be successful in the program on all levels (sport, academics, leadership). Most of our students do excel and play in the upper echelons of their sport.\n\nDoes Global happen during the school day?\n\nYes, it does. The exception is within Golf whereby students are picked up at the golf course on certain days.\n\nIs transportation provided to and from schools?\n\nNo. We only transport students during the day from facilities to the schools when necessary. This transportation is fully insured.\n\nWhat if my student wants to switch sports from one year to the next?\n\nThat is feasible as people’s journey in sport and life change. A meeting would be required with Global leadership to see if this is a feasible option for you and for Global.\n\nWhat if my student wants to switch sports mid-year?\n\nThis is not feasible as the program is designed within an annual timetable and vision.\n\nDoes my student need to be at the honours level to be accepted into Global?\n\nNo. We are looking for students who are achieving personal bests in the classroom. If you have comments that reflect disruptive in class, work not completed, distracted easily then it will be very difficult to be accepted into the program.\n\nI heard Global is jammed and that most programs are full?\n\nYes, many of the programs will be full with wait lists. As a result, it is important you take time on your application to ensure you have the best opportunity to be accepted.\n\nDoes Global take away from other core academic competencies?\n\nNo it does not. Good planning in conjunction with the guidance departments ensure a constructive academic plan is created that will meet the needs of the student in their academic pursuits. There are exceptions and if this poses a challenge the counsellors and families work towards a solution.\n\nCan I play in another school academy program and participate in Global?\n\nNo, this is not feasible and you must pick one option only."
