In 1996 \"CacheFlow\" (later renamed \"Blue Coat Systems\") created the \"CacheOS\" to drive proxy server Web acceleration appliances. This microkernel architecture was chosen for its process efficiency. In 2002, a policy engine was added and the OS name changed to \"SGOS\" (for “secure gateway”). SGOS’ hardened architecture are in no way based on Microsoft Windows, Unix or Linux code. SGOS later passed certifications from NIAP Evaluation Assurance Level 2, FIPS 140-2, and ICSA.\n\nFinancial history\n\nBlue Coat was founded in 1996 as CacheFlow, with Web acceleration from its Web cache as the primary offering. CacheFlow went public in November 1999 at $26 per share and closed at $126 the first day. CacheFlow was among the top-ten price jumps in IPO history. In 2001 the telecom recession caused CacheFlow to downsize and redesign its products. In the summer of 2002 the company changed its name to ‘Blue Coat Systems, Inc.’, and added policy control and security capability to Blue Coat appliances. In late 2006 Blue Coat went back to its roots in accelerating applications, and added a focus on WAN Optimization, a fast growing market segment, and by mid 2007 gained enough market share to be ranked 1st in market share of WAN Application Delivery by IDC [ [http://internetcommunications.tmcnet.com/topics/broadband-mobile/articles/18039-idc-blue-coat-leads-wan-application-delivery-market.htm IDC Market Share Numbers 1H07 WAN Application Delivery Market] ] .\n\nAcquisitions\n\n* 1996 - Scalable Data Systems\n\n* 2000 - Springbank Networks\n\n* 2000 - Entera\n\n* 2003 - Ositis Software\n\n* 2004 - Cerberian\n\n* 2006 - Permeo Technologies\n\n* 2006 - NetApp's NetCache product line\n\n* 2008 - Packeteer, Inc.
