        "text": "For other uses of \"Springbank\", see Springbank (disambiguation).\n\nRural community in Canada\n\nSpringbank is a rural community in southern Alberta in Rocky View County. It is located immediately west of the City of Calgary, east of Highway 22, south of the Bow River and north of the rural community of Elbow Valley. Both the Trans-Canada Highway and Lower Springbank Road (north of Highway 8) connect Springbank to Calgary.\n\nSpringbank consists mostly of country residential acreages developed with estate homes and features the Springbank Airport. The adjacent rural communities of Bearspaw to the north, across the Bow River, and Elbow Valley to the south, across the Elbow River, also consist mostly of country residential acreages. The urban community of Harmony is adjacent to the Springbank Airport to the west.\n\nEastern portions of Springbank have been annexed by Calgary since the early 1980s.[1] These portions are now developed with the Calgary neighbourhoods of Springbank Hill, Aspen Woods, West Springs, Cougar Ridge, Crestmont and Valley Ridge.[2]\n\nSpringbank is named after Springbank Creek which flows southeast into the Elbow River. The descriptive name for this creek was first applied to the municipal district in 1918 (MD of Springbank). It was first given as a school district name on July 11, 1887[3] because of the numerous springs breaking out of the sides of the lesser coulees all over the district. Most of the early settlers located near the springs.\n\nAttractions[edit]\n\nCalaway Park, an outdoor family amusement park, is located in Springbank.\n\nGolf courses in Springbank include the Pinebrook Golf Club, Glencoe Golf and Country Club, Springbank Links Golf Course and Elbow Springs Golf Course.[citation needed][4][5][6][7]\n\nTransportation[edit]\n\nThe Springbank Airport is located within Springbank. It was the 12th busiest airport in Canada in 2011 in terms of total aircraft movements.[8]\n\nClimate[edit]\n\nEducation[edit]\n\nSchools located in Springbank, operated by Rocky View Schools, include:[10]\n\nElbow Valley Elementary School (kindergarten to grade 4);\n\nSpringbank Middle School (grades 5 to 8); and\n\nSpringbank Community High School (grades 9 to 12).\n\nThe high school is located within the Springbank Park For All Seasons, which also includes an ice arena and a curling rink.[11]\n\nPrivate schools in the area are Webber Academy, Rundle College, and Edge School for Athletes.[12]\n\nShopping[edit]\n\nSpringbank has a business park and shopping area located along the Trans-Canada Highway south of Highway 1 between Range Roads 32 and 35. The area has a few businesses including a bottle recycling depot, a seasonal farmers market, pet hospital, truck/RV repair shop and some commercial offices.\n\nNotable residents[edit]\n\nJann Arden, musician\n\nLanny McDonald, former professional hockey player[13]\n\nDarryl Sutter, head coach of the Calgary Flames\n\nRoman Turek, former professional hockey player\n\nReferences[edit]\n\nKaramitsanis, Aphrodite (1992).
