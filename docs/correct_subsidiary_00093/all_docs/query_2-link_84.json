        "text": "Don't worry, it's not new make a.k.a. British Plain Spirit that would have been delivered to me by private jet early this morning (though I would have loved that, ha-ha-ha). Right, that Springbank we're mentioning was indeed distilled on this very day, the 31st of December, but fifty-six years ago if my math is good. However, before we taste it, let's first have a small aperitif to prepare our nose and palate, then a few other very high-quality Springbanks.\n\nColour: mahogany. Nose: can you say 'Samarolian'? Sherry and distillate are playing it Page and Plant, Laurel and Hardy, or Miles and Trane here. Or Santana and Shrieve. Roasted chestnuts, biltong, Maggi sauce, gravy, coffee, balsamico, walnut wine, coal tar, old white burgundy, horse saddle, cigars, dried parsley, black truffles (vividly), hoisin, venison, very old PX, heavier honeys and molasses, maple syrup, black nougat, liquorice, Corinthian raisins, roasted pecans, walnut stain, potting soil, Spanish ham, pipe tobacco… And so many other aromas. With water: truffle soup or morel soup? Some metallic touches appearing, metal polish, old tools, copper coins, old stove, all that… Classic development. Mouth (neat): have you called the Anti-Maltoporn Brigade yet? Because it's even grander on the palate. Exceptional nougats and turons, sweet tobaccos, bananas flambéed, bouillons and broths, coffee and chocolate, dried fruits of all kinds (figs and dates first), some kind of mint-and-honey sauce, liquorice… The huge salinity, which was not this common in older Springbanks in my experience, tends to come to the front of the stage, which is extremely impressive. Right. With water: very tiny soapy touch (saponification with water) that's soon to disappear, then just everything we've already listed, while the whole is getting tarrier and more on bitter marmalade. Impressive. Finish: the smoke chiming in, more minerals, more gravies too, and just myriads of other, well, 'things'. Comments: imagine it's genuinely a ten-year-old, and not one of those young whiskies from the past that were boosted by much older whiskies because they weren't selling anyway! Well, we're going to light a candle in the hope that we might see such greatness again, but that would require the use of real sherry casks, meaning casks that have housed, even if only for a year or even a few months (transport casks), quality old sherries that one would sip with huge pleasure. Anyway, you see what I'm getting at. SGP:663 - 96 points.\n\nBy the way, the sad fate of Whitney Houston reminds us that alcohol can become our worst enemy if we don't control our intake. I'm well aware that some Whiskyfun sessions may suggest that we indulge daily and that we lead almost the life of a country priest or a MP from the last century, but rest assured that this is not the case and that we ensure we only consume the strictly necessary quantities for the writing of our humble little tasting notes."
