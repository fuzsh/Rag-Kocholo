A large ammount of these conatain information you don’t want in your organisation. A cleaver solution would be to use Content Filtering. BlueCoat now introduces Generation 3 of content filtering, BlueCoat Webfilter. 350 Million\n\nGeneration 1 The first generation of content filters consisted of static manually managed lists of popular pornographic and unproductive websites. Very often retreived from access logs, popular bad sites where banned. The intended purpose was to save bandwidth and warn users that inapropriate behaviour was logged. People got together and distributed their lists in free lists compatible with proxies such as Squid. The distributed list where in the size of a million URL:s 1 Million 349 Million\n\nGeneration 2 Corporations relised they could make money of a list and started to collect lists and logs from the web, manually rating these in larger scale. More categories where added to increase value. The systems started to collect URL:S autmatically and download new lists periodicly. Some of them even many times every day. Special categories where added for static security threats placed on known webservers, spyware phishing etc. Other than bad sites where added such as Economy, business, news etc. to present statistics of Internet usage. 15 Million 335 Million\n\nGeneration 2 Number of URL:s was in the numbers of 10-20 millions. Hitrates in logsystems presented was in the numbers of 50-80%. Regular expression on URL:s and other tricks sometimes gave a false picture of rating over 90%. But in fact less than 5% of the Internet was covered. 15 Million 335 Million\n\nGeneration 3 The dynamics of internet and new security risks urged for a new way of categorizing the Internet, Dynamic rating of uncategorized websites can today rate most websites, the ones thats impossible to rate could be stripped down to present only html and images to reduce risk. The static URL database are constantly updated like any Generation 2 filter. This database is cached in some systems (ProxySG) to increase performance. The rest (95%) of the Internet is categorised using dynamic rating. 15 Million 335 Million\n\nSSL Proxy\n\nInternet InternalNetwork Apps SSL SSL User SSL Proxy: Policy Enforcement • Control web content, applications, and services…regardless of encryption • Block, allow, throttle, scan, accelerate, insert, strip, redirect, transform … • Apply the same policies to encrypted traffic as to normal traffic • Stops/controls rogue applications that take advantage of SSL • Protect the enterprise from SSL-borne threats • Stop spyware and secured phishing • SSL-secured webmail and extranets – virus transmissions • SSL-borne malicious and inappropriate content • Accelerate critical applications • Enables a variety of acceleration techniques (e.g., caching) Policy\n\nInternet TCP TCP SSL User Flexible Configurations • Initial checks performed • Valid user, valid application • Valid server cert • User/application traffic passed through after initial checks • No cache • Visibility and context of network-level info, certificates, user, and applications • Can warn user, remind of AUP, and offer opt-out Option 2 Control Apps\n\nInternet TCP TCP SSL SSL User Flexible Configurations • Initial checks performed • Valid user, valid application • Valid server cert • User/application traffic proxied after initial checks • Full caching and logging options • Visibility and context of network-level info, certificates, user, applications, content, etc. • Full termination/proxy • Can warn user, remind of AUP, and offer opt-out Option 3 Control Apps\n\nReverse Proxy\n\nReverse Proxy Policy Logging Authentication URL-rewrite Internet Clients Servers AV SSL/Certificate Caching\n\nPROTECTS Web Servers • Secure, object-based OS • Controls access to web apps • Web AV scanning • ACCELERATES Web Content • Intelligent caching • Compression and bandwidth mgt. • TCP & SSL offload Users • SIMPLIFIES Operations • Scalable, optimized appliance • Easy policy creation & management • Complete logging & reporting Secure & Accelerate Web Applications Reverse Proxy WebServers ProxySG Firewall Internal Network Public Internet Users\n\nHTTPS Termination • HTTPS Termination (Client  ProxySG) • Off-load secure website or portal • HTTPS Origination (ProxySG  Server) • Secure channel to content server for clients • Man-in-the-Middle (Termination & Origination) • Allows caching, policy and virus scanning • Secure credential acquisitions • SSL Hardware Acceleration Cards • 800 RSA transactions per second per card • SSL v2.0, v3.0, and TLS v1 support • Off-load web application servers to improve performance\n\nExample Scenarios for Reverse Proxy • Secure and Accelerate Public Websites • Improves content delivery with integrated caching • Services legitimate users while resisting DoS attacks • High-performance SSL • Secure Corporate Webmail • Securely isolates Web servers from direct Internet access • Proxy authentication for additional layer of protection • Plug-n-play SSL • Scanning Uploaded Files for Viruses • Simple integration with ProxyAV™ • Real-time scanning of uploaded content • Protects Web infrastructure from malware\n\nAccelerate Applications – All Users – All Locations\n\n+ Increased application traffic + Inefficient application protocols + Highly distributed users + Narrow bandwidth links = Poor Application Performance Recipe for Branch Performance Problems Server Consolidation\n\nComplete Solution Requires More Minimum for Application Acceleration • Optimize use of existing WAN bandwidth • Reduce latency associated with applications • Improve the efficiency of application protocols • Prioritize the applications that matter most • Re-use and compress data where possible • Accelerate File Sharing, Email, and browser-based enterprise applications\n\nFile Services (CIFS), Web (HTTP), Exchange (MAPI), Video/Streaming (RTSP, MMS), Secure Web (SSL) Platform for Application Acceleration Multiprotocol Accelerated Caching Hierarchy Bandwidth Management Protocol Optimization Object Caching Byte Caching Compression"
