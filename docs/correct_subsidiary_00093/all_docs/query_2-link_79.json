        "text": "Springbank is one of the few surviving Campbeltown whiskies, which was once the dominant whisky producing region of Scotland. The distillery, which does it’s own maltings, puts out three different whiskies — the triple-distilled Hazelburn, the cult favorite Longrow, and the popular Springbank, which Michael Jackson’s Guide to Single Malt Scotch (5th) says is “made from medium-peated malt, with a trajectory that amounts to two-and-a-half times distillation.” I’m not quite sure how to interpret that. Not mentioned by Michael Jackson is that Springbank is non-chill filtered.\n\nMichael Jackson scored the Springbank 10 at an 83, calling it an “elegant youngster.” A bottle will run you about $59 in the states.\n\nSpringbank 10\n\nABV: 46%\n\nColor: Golden\n\nNose: Spice and raisins.\n\nTaste: More spice. A peatiness that is only faintly smoky. It’s there in the background, but never dominant like in an Islay whisky, and the longer I drink, the more it fades into the background. The finish is lightly fruity, but not citrusy. Like pears or honeydew."
