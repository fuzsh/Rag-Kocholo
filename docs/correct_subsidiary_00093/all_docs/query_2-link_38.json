        "text": "It has been some time since I last reviewed Springbank 10 year (see my old review here), and since the packaging has changed in the meantime I thought I’d give it another go. I think it’s valuable, once in awhile, to revisit whiskies from your past. They may have changed, true, but YOU may also have changed. Tastes evolve, as does your perception, both subjectively (ability to compare to a wider range of experiences) and objectively (improved ability to interpret sensory inputs).\n\nI also now know, thanks to a reader, that Springbank is in an odd category of single malts: products whose US importer heaps on an unreasonable markup. A 700ml bottle of Springbank 10 ran me $46 US after currency exchange rates when ordered from the UK (plus a whole lot in shipping, but it was in a large batch of orders, so that spread out the cost a bit). A 750ml bottle of the US edition of Springbank 10 runs $69 at my local store. Ordering Springbank, specifically, from the UK is a no-brainer… 50 fewer milliliters notwithstanding.\n\nSpringbank 10 is classic stuff. Aged 10 years (It even says it on the bottle! How old-fashioned!), not chill-filtered and bottled at 46% ABV without artificial coloring. Springbank does things the “old way” and is unapologetic about it. On-site floor maltings, worm tubs, and even (some) direct-fired stills. They also do a crazy “2.8-time” distillation and the malt is partially peated. Why? Because that’s how they’ve always done it. These days with all of the marketing and media stunts, all of the computerization and homogenization, and the false grasping at “tradition” and “legacy” as though they were solely corporate buzzwords and not the valuable result of actual time and actual effort, it’s nice to be able to enjoy whisky made this way. Here’s hoping it continues to last.\n\nNose: Green apple, lime juice, juicy green pear. Delectable, but with limited peat presence.\n\nPalate: Thin but silky body. Mild tongue burn. Drying vegetal (grassy) tannins with a bit of resinous (piney) peat. The overall impression is still fruity. Some charcoal.\n\nFinish: A lot of charcoal, but not too bitter. Green apple skins. Cucumber water. Fades quickly, but lingers with that pine-flecked peat.\n\nWith Water: A few drops of water brighten up the aroma but don’t add anything new. Palate texture is unaffected, although the burn is tamed. Water optional."
