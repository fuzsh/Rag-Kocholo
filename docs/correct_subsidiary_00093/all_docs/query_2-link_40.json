        "text": "The Springbank 1919 50 Year Old is one of the oldest vintage whiskies still available on the market. Distilled more than 100 years ago and first bottled in 1970 the Springbank 1919 is an enigma that can sell for both £100,000 and £10,000—in the same month!\n\nThere are two versions of the Springbank 1919 50 year old. They were both distilled in the same year and originally it was all bottled in 1970, at the same strength from the same cask (or casks I’m not sure of release numbers). The market at the time was not strong for single malt, but in the 1980s there were a few distilleries looking to change that perception and increase sales of single malt whisky outside of Scotland. Around this time Springbank decided to rebottle the remaining 24 bottles of their 1919 50 year old, and thus began the strange duality of this incredible whisky.\n\nIn November 2023 both versions of the Springbank 1919 whisky sold, the rebottling for £100,000 and the original for £10,000. But what is it that causes the striking difference in value between two bottles that contain the same whisky?\n\nThe Remarkable Survival Of A Technically Unremarkable Whisky\n\nSpringbank was founded in 1828, and was the fourth licenced distillery in Campbeltown. By 1885 there were 21 distilleries and renowned whisky historian Alfred Barnard dubbed the town “Whisky City” in his accounts. In 1919 when this whisky was distilled, Springbank was at the center of the whisky world and part of a booming industry. Alas, politics, greed and a shift in taste away from the heavily peated whisky style the area was known for, meant by 1934 the once thriving region had just two distilleries.\n\nProhibition was declared in 1920 and America’s love-hate relationship with alcohol was the balance on which scotch whisky was weighed. Distilleries such as Laphroaig boomed thanks to illegal smuggling. Campbelltown by contrast was a victim of its own success; many of the distilleries sacrificed quality to meet demand, and eventually closed as a result.\n\nBy the time prohibition was repealed Springbank—who as early as 1900 had shifted to a less peated finish to match evolving tastes—was one of just two distilleries that had survived in the Campbelltown region.\n\nBy all accounts much of the whisky distilled in Campbelltown’s distilleries around 1919 ended up being chucked in the Loch. But likely that was lower quality scotch from lesser distilleries, those that sacrificed quality for quantity; something Springbank has never been known to do. Nevertheless, it’s likely the whisky was an unremarkable cask of many produced at the time, forgotten in a warehouse, but the fact that it survived to 1970 is remarkable in itself.\n\nThe fact that it was bottled and released as a single malt is a downright miracle!\n\nThe First Release: A Whisky Before It’s Time\n\nThe first iteration of the Springbank 1919 50 year old was in the distinctive pear shaped bottle. For some markets it’s labeled as 66.3 Proof, and for others as 100% Pure Malt—presumably some kind of suggestion of it being cask strength despite it not being at 70 proof. Laws at the time meant under 40% was fine, and so it was released to market; more than likely the oldest vintage whisky available at the time.\n\nThe pear shaped bottle made iconic by this release was reserved for a select few bottlings of single malt released in the 1970s and 1980s, which have become collectors icons and a mini series in their own right. Despite being truly ahead of their time in terms of releases, Springbank could not fully endure the effects of what’s known as the “whisky loch”, a period of downturn around the 1980s that followed on from overproduction in the 1970s.\n\nThe Second Release: The Tall Bottle 37.8%\n\nIn 1980 the legal measure of volume and alcohol strength on spirits changed from imperial to metric and after this all bottles of scotch whisky had to be labeled as 75cl and strength given in ABV. This means that the rebottling of the 1919 whisky was almost certainly after 1980, as it is labeled 75cl and 37.7%.\n\nThe rebottling was a strictly limited release of just 24 hand numbered bottles, presented with a handwritten style label and a striking presentation box reminiscent of a pagoda. Otherwise it is the exact same whisky as its pear shaped younger brother, and yet the record paid for the rebottling stands at over £266,000, compared to just £23,000 for the original.\n\nWhy No One Cares About Whisky\n\nWe love whisky and plenty of other people love whisky too. But as a society we have been trained to impart values to things beyond what can be explained tangibly. These two bottles are a good example of the phenomena of being willing to pay more for something in more attractive packaging, and it works for everything from the cheese you buy in the supermarket, to the car you choose and the whisky you buy.\n\nThe only difference between the two whiskies we’re discussing here, is packaging, and how that packaging conveys the contents within to the potential consumer. To whisky geeks (like myself) both are amazing, because we understand both as products of their time. But to the casual collector, or more importantly to the high-net-worth collector after status bottles, it’s the rebottling that has the umph to shine in a collection. The rebottling has the presence, the case and possibly most importantly, the proud proclamation of the uber-exclusivity of this release, to carry the quarter million price tag.\n\nA Thought Experiment On Release Numbers\n\nIf you’re wondering if either bottle is worth their price tags, think about this. There’s a good chance this was just a single cask in the first place. For a butt at standard rates of evaporation we’re looking at between 60 and 180 liters remaining after 50 years. But at that ABV we would expect it to have had a relatively high evaporation rate, so be at the lower end of the spectrum. So perhaps between 60 and 160 bottles, although half that if it was a hogshead. We know only twenty 24 bottles made it to the rebottling, which gives an estimate of from 36 to—a probably bit generous—136 of the pear shaped bottles. And while this is all a thought experiment, let's just remember that the £2 million, most expensive whisky in the world, is one of 40.\n\nCombined there have been less than 50 sales of these bottles recorded since 2010.\n\nAnd with that thought to dwell on, I’ll just finally mention that this is not the only scotch whisky to experience this phenomena. There are other examples of rebottling by Bowmore (Black Bowmore DB5 versus Black Bowmore Final) and numerous by Macallan, perhaps the most famous being the Fine and Rare version of the 1926 60 year old."
