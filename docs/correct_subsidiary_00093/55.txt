11 Platform for Application Acceleration

Multiprotocol Accelerated Caching Hierarchy Bandwidth Management Protocol Optimization Object Caching Byte Caching Compression File Services (CIFS), Web (HTTP), Exchange (MAPI), Video/Streaming (RTSP, MMS), Secure Web (SSL)

12 MACH5 Techniques Work Together

Object Caching Caches repeated, static app-level data; reduces BW and latency Byte Caching Caches any TCP application using similar/changed data; reduces BW Compression Reduces amount of data transmitted; saves BW Bandwidth Management Prioritize, limit, allocate, assign DiffServ – by user or application Protocol Optimization Remove inefficiencies, reduce latency

13 Remote Users Are Getting Left Behind

Poor performance No control or security No business continuity Inconsistent devices and networks Application delivery must be extended to ALL remote users

14 Requirement: Acceleration to Desktop

Acceleration client for laptops and desktops necessary Improve performance of file access, client-server apps, , etc. (latency, bandwidth issues, packet loss) Transparently work across VPNs and WANs Easy to deploy and administer No changes to end user behavior

15 The Solution: Blue Coat SG Client

Client software that extends Mach5 acceleration capabilities to the desktop Improves performance of , client-server applications and file services Accelerates traffic between SG appliance and end user machine Transparent to IPSec VPNs No changes to end user experience  apps and file downloads are just faster!

16 SG Client Features & Benefits

CIFS acceleration Client Side Object Caching CIFS protocol optimization Significant improvement to wide area file service delivery, improving end user productivity GZIP compression Improves utilization of bandwidth for TCP applications Policy-based acceleration Granular control of when to accelerate traffic Centralize management of client software and configuration Minimizes cost to deploy and maintain the solution Load balancing across clients Fail over to other concentrators Real time client-side statistics Graphically display acceleration results and benefits

17 WAN traffic reduction for CIFS

Example: CIFS Reports Most active servers, clients, files WAN traffic reduction for CIFS
