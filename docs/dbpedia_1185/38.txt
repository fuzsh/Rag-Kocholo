Bill Belichick appeared to be in great spirits aboard a February 2021 flight with his now-girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, according to a photo of their initial encounter published Tuesday by TMZ.

The ex-Patriots head coach, 72, whose romance with the former cheerleader, 24, was revealed earlier this month, could be seen wearing a Rutgers sweatshirt beside a smiling Hudson, who sported a white shirt.

Belichick was taken with Hudson’s philosophy project at the time of their first exchange, according to TMZ, with the six-time Super Bowl-winning coach for the Patriots even autographing a copy of her textbook, “Deductive Logic.”

“Jordon, Thanks for giving me a course on logic! Safe travels!” Belichick wrote before signing his name.

He also listed the Super Bowls he won with the Patriots: 36, 38, 39, 49, 51 and 53.

Belichick’s relationship with Hudson turned romantic following his breakup with longtime girlfriend Linda Holliday.

Page Six reported in September 2023 that Belichick and Holliday had “been involved in a drawn-out, back-and-forth breakup for nearly a year.”

Months later, Belichick and the Patriots parted ways after 24 seasons, the final of which was a dismal 4-13 campaign.

He interviewed for the Falcons’ head coaching vacancy this past cycle, with the job eventually going to Raheem Morris.

Belichick’s post-Patriots tour included a pit stop at Gillette Stadium last week, where he celebrated former quarterback Tom Brady, who was inducted into the team’s Hall of Fame and had his No. 12 jersey retired.

The legendary duo won six titles together before Brady, 46, departed for Tampa Bay after the 2019 season.

“To coach Belichick, thank you for your tireless commitment to develop and push me to be my very best,” Brady said during his Patriots’ Hall of Fame induction this month. “It wasn’t me, it wasn’t you, it was us.”

Hudson also attended the festivities honoring Brady, according to images shared on social media.
