        "text": "The 2024 Golden Globes left viewers with a lot to talk about: historic wins, jaw-dropping looks—and an Ali Wong and Bill Hader romance?\n\nYes, that’s right, the Beef star and the Saturday Night Live alum are dating, and they put their love front and center for the world to see at the big award show.\n\nWhile it is unclear how the two met, they have been acquainted for quite a few years, having worked together as voice actors on the 2016 animated film The Angry Birds Movie. Their current romance marks a second try, as they also briefly dated in 2022.\n\nBefore finding (and refinding) each other, the comedy pair were both previously married—Wong to businessman Justin Hakuta from 2014 to 2022, with whom she shares eight-year-old daughter Mari and six-year-old daughter Nikki; and Hader to actor-producer-director Maggie Carey from 2006 to 2017, with whom he shares 14-year-old Hannah, 11-year-old Harper, and nine-year-old Hayley Clementine. The Barry co-creator and star was later romantically linked to Rachel Bilson, in 2019 and 2020, followed by Anna Kendrick, whom he quietly dated for nearly two years.\n\nRead ahead for everything we know about Wong and Hader’s relationship so far.\n\nApril 1, 2024: They go on a Central Park date.\n\nThe pair look so in love as they hold hands during a walk in New York City’s Central Park. For the sunny day out, Wong wears a fuzzy white sweater with black trousers and a cozy long navy coat; she accessorizes with large gold-rimmed shades and small hoop earrings. Hader coordinates in a bright blue hoodie, beige khakis, and a brown utility-inspired jacket.\n\nThe two are later seen grabbing food on the Upper West Side.\n\nJanuary 15, 2024: They attend the Emmys together.\n\nHader and Wong attend the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles together. In one especially sweet moment, Hader cheers on Wong when she wins for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie.\n\nJanuary 14, 2024: They go to the Critics Choice Awards.\n\nAs award season continues, Hader and Wong attend the Critics Choice Awards in Los Angeles, as dates. For the occasion, Wong wears a green off-the-shoulder gown with a floral print, while Hader wears a classic black tux.\n\nJanuary 7, 2024: They share a passionate kiss at the Golden Globes.\n\nThe star pair execute the hardest of hard launches, kissing on camera before Wong goes up to accept her Golden Globe for Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Limited Series, for her role in Beef.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, however, she shouts out her ex-husband, saying, “I really need to thank the father of my children and my best friend, Justin, for all of your love and support. It’s because of you that I’m able to be a working mother.”\n\nAsked about the shout-out by Entertainment Tonight, Wong says, “Yeah, that’s right—I like to keep it peaceful and grateful and amicable.”\n\nIn March 2023, Wong opened up to The Hollywood Reporter about maintaining a healthy, loving relationship with Hakuta. “We’re really, really close. We’re best friends,” she said. “We’ve been through so much together. It’s a very unconventional divorce.”\n\nApril 19, 2023: They celebrate Wong’s 41st birthday with a PDA-filled hike.\n\nWong and Hader are captured in photos obtained by Page Six looking so in love on a celebratory birthday hike in Los Angeles. In the pics, the comedy couple are all smiles as they hold hands and share a kiss before enjoying a romantic night out a few hours later.\n\nApril 16, 2023: Bill sparks rekindled dating rumors.\n\nWhile promoting season four of Barry, Hader references his “girlfriend” in an interview with Collider.\n\n“I need to take a vacation,” he says. “My girlfriend and I were talking, and she brought it up that I haven't had a vacation in 10 years, so I think I need to go.”\n\nShortly after, Hader’s rep confirms that Wong is indeed the girlfriend in question, telling Entertainment Tonight, “Bill Hader and Ali Wong are dating again.”\n\nFall 2022: They briefly date.\n\nMultiple sources tell Page Six in December 2022 that Wong and Hader dated for a brief period before calling it quits.\n\n“They’re no longer dating. They dated very briefly,” an insider tells the outlet. “They’re just super busy with things, but [the split] was certainly amicable. They’re certainly friends.”"
