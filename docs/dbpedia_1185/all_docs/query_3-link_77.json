        "text": "Bill Burr has drawn upon life with his wife, Nia Renée Hill, for much of his comedy.\n\nThe Unfrosted star and the actress have been married since 2013 and share two children. Over the years, Burr has praised Hill while doing press for his 2024 tour, Bill Burr Live, and discussed their marriage during his stand-up acts. Hill has also made the occasional appearance on Burr's Monday Morning Podcast.\n\nIn October 2023, the couple celebrated a decade of marriage.\n\n\"20 years together, 10 years married, 2 children, 1 beautiful life. Happy Anniversary @wilfredburr,\" Hill wrote on Instagram alongside a video montage of the couple.\n\nSo, who is Bill Burr's wife? Here's everything to know about Nia Renée Hill and her relationship with the Emmy-nominated actor.\n\nShe is an actress, writer and producer\n\nBurr isn't the only entertainer in the family. Hill is also an actor, appearing on Netflix's Santa Clarita Diet and HBO's Crashing. She also voiced the roles of Georgia Roosevelt and Nia Roosevelt on the animated series F Is For Family, which Burr starred in and created.\n\nIn addition to her acting career, Hill is also a writer and founded the production company Tenderheaded Films.\n\nShe met Burr through comedy\n\nHill worked as a talent coordinator on the first season of Chappelle's Show in 2003. Burr appeared on the show in 2004, but she didn't officially meet the comedian until a year later when he guest-starred on Tough Crowd With Colin Quin, as Hill later revealed on Twitter in 2019. They dated for nearly a decade before tying the knot in September 2013.\n\nDuring a March 2024 appearance on The Breakfast Club, Burr said that the first time he met his wife, he was with her dad, Ben Hill, a comedy manager who was booking talent at the Apollo. Then, their paths crossed again when he was a guest on Tough Crowd with Collin Quinn, the Comedy Central talk show she was working on.\n\n\"I remember, I just kept asking her out and she just kept being a jerk,\" he said.\n\nBut one night, everything changed. They were hanging out and he asked if they could split a cab home, telling her it was \"because I want to kiss you.\"\n\nShe and Burr attended the same college — but at different times\n\nLike Burr, Hill is a Massachusetts native. Born in Boston in 1978, she was raised in Atlanta before returning to Boston to attend Emerson College. Burr, who was born in 1968, was raised in the Boston suburb of Canton and attended Emerson a decade earlier than his future wife, earning his bachelor's degree in radio in 1993.\n\nHill graduated in 2000 with a degree in media arts.\n\nShe shares two children with Burr\n\nHill and Burr welcomed their first child, daughter Lola, in January 2017. Their son was born in June 2020, and the couple have not publicly revealed his name.\n\nDuring a March 2022 episode of the podcast The Scroll Down, Hill opened up about her daughter's personality, explaining, \"She reminds me a lot of myself at her age. She's a little bit more combative ... I was a little more low-key — she is half her father.\"\n\nThat half seemingly extends to comedy as well.\n\nIn September 2020, Hill tweeted: \"Bill told our daughter that he was going out to tell jokes. She asked me what that meant. I told her it means Daddy makes people laugh. She said, 'I wanna tell jokes too!' Pray for me, y'all.\"\n\nShe supports Burr's career\n\nThroughout his career, Burr has faced public backlash and scrutiny for his comedy. In 2020, his opening monologue on Saturday Night Live sparked controversy and mixed reactions as he made several jokes about cancel culture, White women and Pride Month.\n\nHowever, Hill has always supported her husband.\n\n\"Hey, listen, he's not everyone's cup of tea, but he is mine,\" she said on The Scroll Down.\n\nHill has given Burr shout-outs on Twitter for his new projects and attended his movie and TV show premieres with him.\n\nIn February 2023, the couple attended the season 3 premiere of Disney's The Mandalorian, on which Burr plays Migs Mayfeld. Hill later shared a photo from the night on Instagram on March 2 with the caption: \"Date night with Migs 💫.\"\n\nShe's got her own comedy chops\n\nHill has been an occasional guest on her husband's podcast, even roasting him. On one occasion, Burr referenced how he's now \"making some money,\" in which Hill jokingly responded, \"It's not like you're walking around dripping in diamonds and Rolex watches and stuff and driving a Porsche and read 'I have money.'\"\n\nShe continued, \"You're walking in there with one of 50 Boston-related T-shirts that you have with your socks pulled up and your old man shorts on. You look like the f------ Little League coach! You're not exactly screaming 'sexy money guy.'\"\n\nHill has also carved her own place in comedy, co-creating the comedy web series You Welcome! with comedian Marcella Arguello. She has her own funny friends, including Chelsea Peretti and Michelle Buteau.\n\nShe's a Sopranos superfan\n\nBurr and Hill made a joint appearance on a 2020 episode of Drea de Matteo and Chris Kushner's Sopranos rewatch podcast, Made Women. During the episode, de Matteo, who starred on the hit HBO series as Adriana La Cerva, admitted in the intro that Hill might know more about the show than she did."
