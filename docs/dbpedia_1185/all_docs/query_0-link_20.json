        "text": "Ex-Patriot's coach Bill Belichick was spotted with his 24-year-old girlfriend for the first time since their relationship was made public – enjoying the sunshine on his boat in Nantucket on Wednesday, DailyMail.com can reveal.\n\nBelichick, 72, took his young squeeze for an early morning spin on his $225,000 powerboat, named VIII Rings for his eight Super Bowl titles (six as head coach in New England and the two he previously won as the New York Giants' defensive coordinator).\n\nThe former NFL head coach is reported to have been dating Jordon Hudson since at least 2022, after his 16-year relationship with Linda Holliday, 62, broke down.\n\nExclusive photos show Hudson and Belichick looking relaxed in each other's company as they climbed off the vessel, with the former cheerleader clutching nautical buoys.\n\nShe checked her phone as she chatted to her boyfriend, and another male companion, before they piled into a car together.\n\nBelichick kept his head down as he carried a blanket and a bag, donning a blue baseball cap, polo shirt and shorts.\n\nHudson looked chic in an off the shoulder black top, with white lacy shorts, paired with glasses and sandals for their morning on the water.\n\nFootage of Belichick sneaking out of his girlfriend's home two months before the relationship became public was revealed by DailyMail.com earlier today.\n\nThe couple, who have a 48-year age gap, had been keeping a low profile since reports of their relationship made headlines last week.\n\nBut DailyMail.com can reveal that the pair have been hunkering down in one of the legendary NFL coaches lavish properties in his 'compound' on Nantucket.\n\nBelichick and Hudson have been staying in one of his seven lavish properties that he owns on the exclusive island, with an estimated value of $3,064,800.\n\nThe former Patriots coach also recently purchased a $4.8million home closer to the main cobbled street in Nantucket.\n\nHe currently owns at least seven properties on the island, with six of them close to each other making up a complex in Siasconset, worth in total $15.7million.\n\nBelichick and Hudson have been enjoying the sunny weather at the three-bedroom and three-bathroom property, which offers privacy from every angle.\n\nIt isn't the first time that Hudson has visited the island, posting on social media from the exclusive enclave in May.\n\nThe couple are currently holidaying with Belichick's son Brian, his wife Callie, and their young child.\n\nHis daughter-in-law Jennifer Schmitt is also staying at the complex with her young children, though it is unclear if her husband Steve has joined the family.\n\nBoth Brian and Steve married their spouses on the island, with Callie posing for pictures in front of one of the properties.\n\nBelichick originally bought a home on the island in 1979 and has spoken of his love for the upscale enclave.\n\nSpeaking to N Magazine in 2017 he said: 'The island is spectacular. The people are great, fishing, bike paths, the lighthouses, the beach, the history — I mean it's got it all.\n\n'The baked goods there are pretty hard to resist, especially their muffins or cookies.'\n\nIt comes after DailyMail.com revealed footage of Belichick sneaking out of his girlfriend's home in 2023 – months before their relationship was revealed.\n\nLegendary quarterback Tom Brady mocked Ring footage of the football coach doing a bare-chested walk of shame at his roast in April.\n\nBrady, who joked about his beloved coach doing the walk of shame on his Netflix roast, seemingly had no clue the home belonged to Belichick's new girlfriend.\n\nSeemingly unbeknownst to Tom - and his Netflix audience of millions - Belichick, 72, has been dating Hudson since 2022 after the pair met on a flight from Boston to Florida in 2021, as reported by TMZ.\n\nThe pair are said to have bonded over a philosophy project that Hudson - a student-athlete as well as an entrepreneur - had been working on at the time.\n\nOn Tuesday, the couple were pictured in an unearthed selfie taken during their first encounter in February 2021, TMZ reported.\n\nThe two posed for a photo during their reported first meeting aboard a 2021 flight from Boston to Florida where Belichick reportedly struck up a conversation about the book she was reading.\n\nIt was on that flight that Belichick also purportedly autographed a 'Deductive Logic' textbook that Hudson, then a 21-year-old student at Bridgewater State University, was studying.\n\nBoth had been keeping their relationship under wraps after his long-drawn-out break up with his ex-girlfriend Linda Holliday.\n\nThe Ring footage, believed to be from November last year shows the New Haven legend shirtless, opening the front door of Hudson's $800,000 Massachusetts property in the early hours of the morning.\n\nBelichick, who has won a total of eight Super Bowls, grimaced at his former star player and looked uncomfortable during the show.\n\nHe spent 23 seasons as head coach of the New England Patriots, taking charge of the team in the same year his current girlfriend was born.\n\nNeither Belichick nor Hudson have commented on their relationship, though she attended Brady's Patriots Hall of Fame induction ceremony this week.\n\nBelichick was spotted rooting her on at a cheerleading competition in March, and posed for a picture with her during a work trip to Croatia on a boat.\n\nThe couple kept in touch after their airline meet cute, discussing the former Bridgewater State University student's schoolwork and cheerleading routines.\n\nThey initially kept things lowkey and were only briefly spotted on rare occasions, but TMZ claims Hudson secretly visited Gillette Stadium to support her man during the 2022 and 2023 seasons with the Patriots.\n\nHudson is even understood to have been helping Belichick with his business endeavors of late.\n\nPage Six broke the news that the all-time great NFL coach - who called time on his legendary Patriots tenure earlier this year - had broken up with Holliday last September after a drawn-out, back-and-forth breakup for nearly a year.'\n\nAfter bidding an emotional goodbye to the Patriots, Belichick failed to land another NFL job ahead of the 2024-25 season.\n\nHe is instead set to become a regular fixture on ESPN's Monday Night Football with Peyton and Eli Manning, before potentially returning to coaching when a vacancy opens up."
