        "text": "It Takes Two…\n\n… and for decades, these were the two that it took: the late Frances Reid and MacDonald Carey as Alice and Tom Horton.\n\nNow and Forever\n\nNever mind how it ended and ended and ended again between these two; this is the way we like to remember Hope Williams (Kristian Alfonso) and Bo Brady (Peter Reckell) — as happy as they were on the day of their first wedding.\n\nIs It Hot in Here…\n\n… or was it just the early days in the romance of Carrie Brady (Christie Clark) and Austin Reed (Patrick Muldoon)? Nothing, it seemed, could come between them. Nothing except…\n\nWho’s That Guy?\n\nNew Austin — Austin Peck — same old chemistry. Whew.\n\n‘There, There, Dear’\n\nIn 1966, Diane Hunter (Coleen Gray) did her best to assure daughter Susan (Denise Alexander) that bows were sure to come back in fashion. One day. Maybe.\n\n‘Tanks’ a Lot\n\nAll Lucas Roberts (Bryan R. Dattilo) is missing in this late-1990s portrait is the other members of his dreamy boy band.\n\nHere Comes the Bride\n\nNothing could stand in the way of Joshua Fallon (Scott Palmer) marrying Jessica Fallon (Jean Bruce Scott). Well, unless you count her relationship with the Salem Strangler and her alternate personality.\n\nBo-Tied\n\nIn 1992, Robert Kelker-Kelly wasn’t just a new beau for Dr. Carly Manning (Crystal Chappell), he was a new Bo Brady for us all.\n\nThree’s Company?\n\nEh, it was really more of a crowd for a jealous Ben Weston (Robert Scott Wilson), girlfriend Abigail Deveraux (then Kate Mansi) and her true love, Chad DiMera (Billy Flynn), in 2015.\n\nFriends and Lovers\n\nLooking back, gamblin’ man Neil Curtis (Joe Gallison) and sad songstress Liz Chandler (Gloria Loring) probably would’ve been better off as strangers.\n\nAll Hail the Phoenix\n\nIf only the late, great Joseph Mascolo’s Stefano DiMera could rise yet again…\n\nGroundbreakers\n\nIn the mid-1970s, David Banning (Richard Guthrie) and Valerie Grant (then Tina Andrews) — aka Eli Grant’s parents — became Days of Our Lives’ first interracial couple.\n\nTo Thine Own Elf Be True\n\nIn 2004, Mickey Horton (the late John Ingle) was torn between naughty Bonnie Lockhart (Judi Evans) and nice wife Maggie (Suzanne Rogers).\n\nLet’s ‘I Do’ It\n\nBillie Reed (Lisa Rinna) and Bo (Kelker-Kelly here) were as fond of one another as their portrayers infamously weren’t.\n\nNunsense\n\nSister Mary Moira was but one of the secondary characters that former headwriter James E. Reilly created for Days of Our Lives’ original Kristen DiMera, Eileen Davidson.\n\nLean On Me\n\nNothin’ to see here. Just Hope and Bo (Reckell again) sharing a warm moment while chilling in 1996.\n\nAll’s Fair\n\nIn 2003, somebody just needed to tell Belle Black (Kirsten Storms; now Maxie, General Hospital), Cassie Brady (Alexis Thorpe), Rex Brady (Eric Winter) and Mimi Lockhart (Farah Faith) that the camera was over here. Over here, kids.\n\nIt’s Complicated\n\nThere’s really no other way to describe the tortured relationship between Carly and Lawrence Alamain (Michael Sabatino, who married his leading lady in 1997).\n\nSo Happy Together\n\nWell, at least Sami Brady (Alison Sweeney) was happy anytime she and Austin (Peck here) were together. He, on the other hand, was generally ambivalent. At best. Maybe it shows?\n\nOpposites Attract\n\nDespite his checkered past and despite how brightly her halo glowed, Jack Deveraux (Matthew Ashford) and Jennifer Horton (Melissa Reeves) discovered that they were perfect for one another.\n\nTurtlenecking\n\nThey say that when couples have been together for a while, they start to look alike. Or is it dress alike? Julie Williams (Susan Seaforth Hayes) and husband Doug (real-life spouse Bill Hayes) might be able to shed some light on this subject.\n\nSkin Is In\n\nFor some reason, EJ DiMera (James Scott) and sometime missus Sami looked as if we were interrupting them during this 2006 bedroom shoot. We’ll just let ourselves out…\n\n‘How *You* Doin’?’\n\nJohn Black (Drake Hogestyn) turns his bedroom eyes up to “seduce.”\n\nWhat, They Had a Groupon?\n\nIn 1986, sometime stripper Pete Jannings (Michael Leon) married Melissa Horton (Lisa Trusel) in a double-wedding ceremony with her adoptive parents, Mickey (then the late John Clarke) and Maggie.\n\nYoung and Restless\n\nShawn Brady (then Jason Cook) and Belle (then Storms) were just whippersnappers when they fell in love.\n\nOlder and Wiser\n\nHey, how come when Shawn and Belle grew up — and began being played by Brandon Beemer and Martha Madison — they remained just as pretty as they always were? That hardly seems fair.\n\n’Tanks’ Again\n\nLucas would stop at nothing to prove to people that there was nothing up his sleeve. Including eschewing sleeves altogether.\n\nA Match Made in Hell\n\nSure, they were troublemakers to the core, but Vivian Alamain (Louise Sorel) and Victor Kiriakis (John Aniston) certainly showed us a devil of a good time.\n\nAlice in Wonderland\n\nIn an early publicity shot, Reid strikes such a pensive pose, you’d swear she was auditioning for Dark Shadows.\n\nBad Boys… Whatcha Gonna Do?\n\nIn 2015, Chad, Stefano and Tony — or was that André (Thaao Penghlis, either way)? — managed to fit three generatuons of DiMeras into one frame.\n\nMixed Doubles\n\nWe get why the Bradys — Shawn (the late Frank Parker) and Caroline (the late Peggy McCay) — would be together in this 1996 promotional photo. But sweet Maggie and the dastardly Stefano? Mystifying.\n\nA Hopeless Case\n\nTom tried to reach Susan, but her troubles were usually so great, even his wise words couldn’t help. She was probably daydreaming about her old bows. “They’re coming back in style,” she told herself.\n\nThey’ll Always Have Paris\n\nAbe Carver (James Reynolds) made the last days of lost love Lexie (Renée Jones) ones that she — and “oui” — would always remember.\n\nYou Don’t Know Jack\n\nUnless you know Mark Valley, who spelled usual portrayer Ashford in the role from 1994-97. Then OK, you might know Jack. (Don’t get us started on Steve Wilder, though.)\n\n#Awkward\n\nDoug gave only the subtlest of signs to gold digger Lee DuMonde (the late Brenda Benet) that was he was slightly more into Julie. Do ya think she noticed?\n\nBlue Steel\n\nThere would be no pulling focus from Lucas in 1999. Not at this photo shoot, anyhow.\n\nHope Springs Eternal\n\nDays of Our Lives vet Alfonso may have left the building, but we’ll always have our memories of her iconic character. And also amazing images like this one. What was up there? Cobweb? Good lighting? We can’t help but wonder.\n\n‘So… How About That Weather, Huh?’\n\nGiven the history between Sami, Austin (Peck here, as if you didn’t know), Lucas and Carrie, this had to be one of the more fraught double dates in history.\n\nThe Way They Were\n\nWhen John married Isabella Toscano (Staci Greason) in 1992, he thought that it was for keeps. If only, pal. If only.\n\nLove On the Rocks\n\nIf this wasn’t Jack and Jennifer’s engagement photo, it should’ve been. For real, yo.\n\nTrigger-Unhappy\n\nAs this 2013 scene shot suggests, mercurial Kristen (original flavor Davidson) had a tendency to go off half-cocked.\n\nThe Ice Woman Cometh\n\nSo frosty a presence is Vivian that she gives herself the chills even in a sweater. Now that’s cold.\n\nBro, No You Don’t\n\nAustin (Peck again) and half-sibling rival Lucas never failed to make a splash when they tried dipping into the same dating pool a, um, toe.\n\n‘I Do’ Two\n\nAfter solving the Salem Stalker case, Roman Brady (then Wayne Northrop) made a missus of Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall) in 1983.\n\nBo My God!\n\nIn the early 1990s, Kelker-Kelly’s do-gooder had it bad for both Hope and Billie. Can ya blame him?\n\nAgainst All Odds\n\nBy 2018, Ben had totally sold Days of Our Lives’ audience on his feelings for Ciara Brady (Victoria Konefal).\n\nLand Shark!\n\nUnbeknownst to them, back in 2001, Philip Kiriakis (Jay Kenneth Johnson), Chloe Lane (Nadia Bjorlin), Shawn Brady (Cook) and Belle (Storms) were actually looking at seaweed; they’d been in the sun for a long time.\n\nHell, Yeah!\n\nIn 1995, Marlena ran afoul of a demon that was even more troublesome than Kristen. Maybe you heard a little something about it?\n\nThe Eyes Have It\n\nFoolishly, the first doctor who treated Marlena for possession had just prescribed Visine.\n\n’Rock, Paper, Scissors, Anyone?’\n\nIn the grip of an otherworldly fiend, Marlena seemed seriously opposed to letting John — or anyone — borrow her office supplies.\n\nGoing Up?\n\nWe’d love to say that we didn’t know what possessed her. But c’mon, we knew. We all knew.\n\nHot Under the Collar\n\nIn the end, Kristen (still Davidson) didn’t have a prayer of holding onto John.\n\nOh, *Hell* No!\n\n“Her!” cried Kristen. “There are too many pictures of her and her damn possession in this photo album!” Fine. We’ll move on.\n\nToo Close for Comfort\n\nNope. This is just about normal for Doug and Julie. They dance cheek to cheek even when standing still.\n\nAustin Who?\n\nDr. Mike Horton (Roark Critchlow) did the near-impossible: He made us forget that we always thought that Austin was endgame for Carrie.\n\nNo Shirt, No… Uh, Problem\n\nBut then Austin (pec again… er Peck) would show up looking like this, and all bets would be off.\n\nA Foregone Conclusion\n\nUltimately, Austin (you know which one) just kept taking clothes off until Carrie said, “Fine, you can have your favorite pillow back.”\n\nSpirit of ’76\n\nWhen Doug and Julie tied the knot for the first time… well, in looking back, they really should’ve double-tied it. Salem ain’t an easy town in which to maintain a marriage.\n\nDouble Trouble\n\nAs evil twins are wont to do, Samantha Evans (Andrea Hall-Gengler) — aka the sibling rival with which sister Marlena was saddled — stole the shrink’s life out from under her. Briefly.\n\nTrue Confessions\n\nIn 2012, Nicole Walker (Arianne Zucker) felt that Eric Brady (Greg Vaughan) really, really needed to know how often she’d watched The Thorn Birds.\n\nLooks Can Be Deceiving\n\nAbe’s relationship with Paulina Price (the inimitable Jackée Harry) was not the endless party that this photo makes it look like. There weren’t even balloons most of the time.\n\nBad News\n\nAlice could see it written all over the face of her son, Mickey (Clarke here). And she’d told him not to write on his face so many times already.\n\nSuitable for Framing\n\nOh, who are we kidding? You’d never have to frame Kate Roberts (Lauren Koslow) or Sami — they commit plenty enough crimes on their own.\n\nHell’s Belle\n\nGiven the state of the chompers on a zombified Charlie Dale (Mike C. Manning) in 2021, we’re gonna risk eternal damnation by guessing that the devil doesn’t offer its minions much in the way of a dental plan.\n\nFunny Business…\n\n… was always on tap whenever daytime’s kookiest supercouple — Calliope Jones (Arleen Sorkin) and Eugene Bradford (John de Lancie) — was on screen.\n\nVisiting Hours\n\nJohn didn’t want for company in the hospital before the age of social-distancing.\n\nVicious Cycle\n\nKate and Vivian fought tooth and nail over Victor — to the point that the latter had her rival’s embryo implanted in her. Like, “Damn, girl! That’s commitment.”\n\nWet ’N’ Wild\n\nBo (Reckell here) gave Carly an enviable pick-me-up in 1991.\n\nHired Guns\n\nSomehow Kelker-Kelly got viewers to accept him in Reckell’s old role. Pictured: somehow.\n\nMother Knows Best\n\nEh, as Chanel Dupree (Raven Bowens) would be quick to tell ya, that isn’t necessarily true when one’s mother is the irrepressible Paulina.\n\nRed-Hot Mama\n\nDown-to-earth Caroline could glam it up with the best of ’em. Was she on her way to a Dynasty viewing party?\n\nOut Standing in Her Field\n\nAlso outstanding in her field. That’s Emmy winner Davidson milking the role of Susan Banks for all it was worth in 1998.\n\nThe Odd Couple\n\nAnd they said it wouldn’t last. Oh. Right. It didn’t. But Days of Our Lives nonetheless flirted with the idea of pairing Shane Donovan (Charles Shaughnessy) and sister-in-law Kayla.\n\nWait Just One Second…\n\nOdd enough that in this 1986 wedding portrait, Marlena thinks that her groom is Roman (when he’s actually John). But among the groomsmen is Chris Kositchek, played by Josh Taylor… who’d eventually end up playing Roman. Wild, right?\n\nThe Thin Line Between Love and Hate\n\nOnce Gabi Hernandez (Camila Banus) and Stefan DiMera (Brandon Barash) crossed it, there was no turning back.\n\n*Very* Casual Friday… and Saturday… and…\n\nAfter Ben and Ciara were given the rare happy ending, his portrayer was given a new character to play. Thankfully, Alex Kiriakis was also a clothing-optional kinda guy.\n\nScandalous\n\nPeter Blake (Jason Brooks) not only entangled Jennifer (then Stephanie Cameron) in his arms but in his web of lies.\n\nUh-Oh\n\nIf Stefano was smiling, you just knew he was up to no good. Also: if he wasn’t smiling. He was pretty much always up to no good.\n\nHe Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother\n\nOK, technically, we don’t know if Abe ever picked up brother Jonah (Thyme Lewis) to know how much he weighed.\n\nRead the Room\n\nWe’re no experts, Hope — OK, maybe we are — but it looks to us like you’re in serious danger based on the daggers romantic rival Megan Hathaway (Cheryl-Ann Wilson) is shooting your way. And Nurse Kate Honeycutt (Elinor Donahue) looks like she’s living for it, whatever “it” turns out to be.\n\nWho Wore It Best?\n\nIn 2019, Brady Black (Eric Martsolf) and Nicole were shocked — shocked, we tell ya — to discover that a mask had convinced him that Kristen (by then Stacy Haiduk) wasn’t Kristen at all. Yeah, it was a heckuva mask!\n\nBride and Gloom\n\nTony was the last to realize that Kristen (Davidson again) just wasn’t that into him.\n\nTwo of a Kind\n\nOn the flip side, Tony and Anna (Leann Hunley) made the ultimate scheme team.\n\nAs Luck Would Have It\n\nIt was during soap legend Flannery’s 1960s-70s run as Days of Our Lives’ Laura that she met the late William J. Bell, the headwriter who’d eventually cast her as Stephanie Forrester, the queen bee of The Bold and the Beautiful.\n\nCold Feet, Hope?\n\nNah, as she attempted to remarry Bo, the bride was more likely just concerned that Salem weddings rarely go off without a hitch.\n\nCostume Drama\n\nClearly, Rafe Hernandez (Galen Gering) and Hope were just on their way to the grocery. Out of Pop Tarts again.\n\nTough and Tender\n\nSteve and Kayla brought out the best in each other.\n\nFamily Ties\n\nSigh. Back in 2011, Sonny Kiriakis (Freddie Smith) and dad Justin (Wally Kurth) hadn’t the faintest idea of how cruelly the former’s mom and latter’s wife, Adrienne (Judi Evans), would be taken from them.\n\nOnce More, With Feeling\n\nWhen Doug and Julie remarried in 1981, on hand were her son, David Banning (Gregg Marx), Tom, Alice and Maggie to… well, not to put too fine a point on it, make the couple look very, very short.\n\nSea-Worthy\n\nWant passion? Just add water to Hope and Bo.\n\nShore Thing\n\nDamn, they even dry sexily.\n\nThe Kids Are All Right\n\nThat’s Cameron Davis (Schuyler Yancey), Abigail (Mansi here), Melanie Jonas (Molly Burnett), Chad DiMera (Casey Deidrick), Gabi, Will Horton (Chandler Massey) and Sonny… um, posing for a Benetton ad? Starring in their class’ production of 90210: The Musical?\n\nShirts or Skins?\n\nWhen it comes to reformed scoundrel Xander Kiriakis (Paul Telfer), that’s a rhetorical question. Besides, what better way for him to reassure folks that he doesn’t have any tricks up his sleeve?\n\nHopeful Romantics\n\nIn 1983, Days of Our Lives viewers thrilled to every new chapter in the love story of Marlena and Roman (then Northrop).\n\nLove Wins\n\nWill and Sonny gave Days of Our Lives its first gay supercouple. May they not be its last.\n\nDidn’t We Almost Have It All?\n\nAdrienne and Justin had the world on a string in 2011. They should have tried affixing it to, say, a cord; string is not known for its strength.\n\nIt’s a Boy!\n\nYears after Days of Our Lives saddled John with the saddest backstory ever, history was rewritten to give the beleaguered hero a new and improved dad in special guest star Dick Van Dyke’s Timothy Robicheaux.\n\nWait, *Denim* Is the New Black?\n\nIt was anything-goes during Days of Our Lives’ 2016 babes-behind-bars-storyline.\n\n‘Shouldering’ the Burden…\n\n… of bringing the glamour in the ’80s was Anna. Side note: Is that the Titanic jewel?\n\nLove in Bloom\n\nIn 2020, Lani Price (Sal Stowers) and Eli Grant (Lamon Archey) became the first — yes, unbelievably, the first — Black couple ever to tie the knot on screen on Days of Our Lives.\n\n’’Sup, Bro?’\n\nIn the early 1990s, heads were turned — fine, mostly ours — by the Scofield siblings, sensible Brian (Robert Mailhouse) and rebellious Tanner (Michael Easton, who’s now Finn on General Hospital).\n\nPurple Reign\n\nJones brought to life Abe’s true love, Lexie, for just shy of two decades. We’ll still give her credit for 20 years, though.\n\nChristmas ‘Presence’\n\nIn 2015, Claire Brady (Olivia Rose Keegan), perhaps guessing that she was on Santa’s naughty list, seemed to watch her chances of receiving gifts float away while Gabi, daughter Arianna (then Harper Udell) and JJ Deveraux (Casey Moss) took altogether different approaches to their holiday portrait.\n\nSeeing Triple\n\nAh, yes — the one thing that’s better than a photo of “Jarlena” getting their romance on: three photos of “Jarlena” having a love-in.\n\nThree’s a Crowd\n\nLovers Chanel and Allie Horton (Lindsay Arnold) had to learn that one the hard way, after they and Alex participated in daytime’s first-ever mé·nage à trois.\n\nNeed a Lift?\n\nAs far as Bo (Kelker-Kelly again) was concerned, son Shawn (then Scott Groff) was head and shoulders above the rest. Literally.\n\nFor Better or Nurse\n\nIn 2004, the incorrigible Jan Spears (Heather Lindell) went to extremes to, um, “captivate” Shawn (then Cook).\n\nPutting the ‘Don’ in ‘Don Juan’\n\nForecast be damned, in 1979, a head-over-heels-in-love Marlena tied the knot with Don Craig (Jed Allan) armed with a parasol.\n\nDear Abby…\n\nIn 2017, Stefan (then Tyler Christopher) liked sister-in-law Abigail (Marci Miller here), but he really liked her alter ego, “Gabby.”\n\nOne Wife to Leave\n\nThe honeymoon was over for Gwen Rizczech (Emily O’Brien) before it even began in 2023. Groom Dimitri Von Leuschner (Peter Porte) agreed that Leo Stark (Greg Rikaart) was the best man — in particular, the best man for him!\n\nCheeky\n\nIn 1996, Hope turned away from the kiss of true love Bo… but in the hottest way possible."
