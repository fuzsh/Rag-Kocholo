        "text": "With beautiful old Joshua Trees and acres of land to explore, Rimrock Ranch is a little more remote than some Joshua Tree wedding venues. It has so much to offer that you’ll want to spend your whole wedding weekend enjoying the vintage desert atmosphere.\n\nA Rimrock Ranch Wedding\n\nDo you love those dreamy wedding photos that look like couples are truly in the middle of nowhere in the desert? Rimrock Ranch is the perfect place to create those wedding portraits. The venue sits on over 35 acres of land outside Joshua Tree National Park. In the spring, you can catch flowering cacti with the mountains stretching in the distance.\n\nPart of what makes Rimrock Ranch such a great wedding venue is that it includes so many accommodations. Lodgings include a renovated Airstream, a Midcentury Modern house, and 1940s cabins furnished with beautiful hardwood. Because Rimrock Ranch was originally built for movie stars to retreat from filming in Pioneertown, it’s comfortable. You get the rugged beauty of the desert without feeling like you have to rough it.\n\nA wedding at Rimrock Ranch includes a ceremony between the Joshua trees. Being a little more remote makes weddings feel more intimate. There are fewer distractions from being present with your people. It’s also easier to get gorgeous desert photos. You can find a vintage truck and horses on the property to add to the Old West ambiance.\n\nA Joshua Tree Wedding Venue"
