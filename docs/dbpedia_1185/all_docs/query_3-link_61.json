        "text": "You don't need to exit Miami to see some stars. Bill Sadowski Park is homebase for the Southern Cross Astronomical Society, which oversees the D'Auria Observatory onsite. On Saturdays, they open to the public for free stargazing, where their expert members can walk you through every constellation imaginable from sunset until about 10pm. They also may open during the week in the case of lunar eclipses, meteor storms, comet watches or super moons. 17555 SW 79 Ave\n\nSet the mood: Want to couple your stargazing with some culture? Deering Estate is just a five minute drive away, and they host plenty of evening events, from moon viewing to seasonal night hikes.\n\nLocated inside Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, The Cleat is the blissfully laidback yet chic waterfront bar Key Biscayne was missing. Whether you’re stationed at the gorgeous terrazzo bar or slung back on an Adirondack chair with your toes in the sand, it's an idyllic spot to feel like you and your partner have traveled to the end of the earth together without actually leaving Miami.\n\nSet the mood: Every seat is the best seat in the house to enjoy panoramic ocean views with ice-cold drinks in hand, especially the top-notch piña coladas during sunset. No Name Harbor, Key Biscayne\n\nPaint me like one of your French girls – or just sketch me like one, anyway. Raw Figs is a live figure drawing class that pops up all around Miami around twice a week. The locations are pretty unique – museums, book stores, nature centers – making it a really cool way to both up your artistic skills and explore the city. Not much of a drawer? That's ok – this is about the community and experience more than anything else. The events are usually free, however donations are encouraged.\n\nSet the Mood: Want to really become your partner's muse? Apply to be one a model for a live figure drawing class. Sessions can be either nude or minimally clothed, so make sure you're comfortable baring a bit or all.\n\nFairchild comprises a verdant 83 acres of rare tropical plants—including palms, cycads, flowering trees, and vines—plus a 25,000-square-foot butterfly house, the American Orchid Society, and rotating art exhibits that cycle each December. When it’s time to escape the chaos and grit of the city and return to nature, there’s no place quite as sprawling or enchanted to indulge your senses and get grounded with your boo.\n\nSet the mood: For your sweet-toothed sweetheart, Fairchild hosts the Festival of Chocolate each January, featuring artisan samples, cooking demos and lectures on all things cocoa.\n\nIn an act of heartbroken desperation, Latvian-American eccentric Edward Leedskalnin embarked on a lifelong quest to construct this massive oolite limestone structure after his true love dumped him a day before their wedding. Comprising 1,100 tons of stones in the form of walls, carvings, furniture, a castle tower and various metaphysical curiosities, Coral Castle has been featured on History Channel’s Ancient Aliens and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\n\nSet the mood: Schedule your visit on the first Saturday of the month when palm and tarot readers descend on the site to get some clarity on your relationship.\n\nAdjacent to the New World Center (where you can also catch the renowned Miami Symphony Orchestra perform), SoundScape Park is a 2.5-acre multiuse oasis that marries art and nature with its elegant, architectural landscaping and state-of-the-art “WALLCAST” live-streaming capabilities.\n\nSet the mood: SoundScape Park hosts free weekly movie and live concert screenings from October through May. Bring along a blanket, pack a wine picnic and soak up some culture under the stars, all in the heart of South Beach.\n\nDotted with rock waterfalls, fountains, footbridges and koi ponds, Schnebly Winery is nestled on a picturesque property that also houses Miami Brewing Company. (Tours are available for both.) With an array of wines made from ingredients like passion fruit, lychee, coconut and avocado, it’s a great way to sample Miami’s local flavors while also getting a nice, tingly buzz with bae.\n\nSet the mood: Their events calendar is brimming with things to do almost every night of the week, from salsa dancing on Saturdays to live music on Sundays, but Friday's are decidedly \"Date Night,\" and feature evening tours, tastings by the waterfalls and dining alfresco. Plus, you get free access to country night at Miami Brewing Co.\n\nA Turkish-style hammam, aroma steam room, Roman waterfall hot tub, Finnish sauna, arctic plunge and infinity pool are just a few of the amenities at this ultra-Zen hotel spa that’s consistently ranked among the world’s best. With a holistic approach that aims to unite mind, body and spirit, it’s an enclave of relaxation located a quick walk, bike or drive away from the bustling core of SoBe. And while you could opt for a spa day, catch the sunset and opt for a spa night – you'll be surprised at how buzzy this place can be after 9pm.\n\nSet the mood: Keep it sensual and satisfying by treating yourselves to the K.I.S.S. 90 body treatment. Begin in the hamam for some warm-up time. Then receive a 60-minute Standard Massage followed by a complete lathering with a Turkish Hamam Rub and Scrub. ($334 per person)\n\nOccupying the southern tip of Key Biscayne, Bill Baggs’ is one of Miami's most popular state parks. Its wide beaches regularly make the national top ten lists, but this is more than just a place to catch some rays: you and your boo will find history, wildlife and plenty of activities too. Shoreline fishing, ocean kayaking, windsurfing, cycling and in-line skating are all on the menu here. Snag a table on the water at Whiskey Joe’s on your way back to the mainland.\n\nSet the mood: Sneak some smooches at the top of the famous Cape Florida Lighthouse—Miami-Dade County’s oldest standing structure and the park's most famous attraction. Constructed in 1825, it guided mariners off the Florida Reef, which starts just near Key Biscayne.\n\nBuilt between 1914 and 1922, Vizcaya was the winter home of American industrialist James Deering, who modeled the estate in the extravagant image of a centuries-old European Villa. Inside, it’s a repository of Gilded Age design with a collection of decorative and fine art spanning more than 2,000 years. Outside, it boasts some of the city’s most stunning backdrops for those Insta-perfect snapshots with your S.O.\n\nSet the mood: Check their calendar for Vizcaya’s nighttime events, such as Roaring ’20s-themed bashes and moonlit walks in the garden, which offer a different, more idyllic way to experience the mansion.\n\nIt's a cliché for a reason: Clay is a soft, earthy material and using your hands to work it into various curvy shapes is about as sensual as you can get with your partner without actually touching each other. This ceramics studio inside a charming Wynwood Airbnb offers several classes and workshops throughout the month, from beginner wheel throwing to glazing and pottery painting.\n\nSet the mood: Check their Instagram for the latest workshops, which often feature romantic themes like Bossa Nova and jazz music or astrological signs. 124 NE 22 St.\n\nPay homage to your partnership’s feminine side at Margot, a petite, blush-toned Downtown wine bar inspired by the fairer sex. Helmed by Bar Lab, the team behind the nationally acclaimed cocktail bar Broken Shaker, Margot specializes in low-intervention and natural wine, offering about 75 different bottles, as well as low-ABV cocktails.\n\nSet the mood: Want to feel like you've been transported to Spain? Pair your curated varietals with tapas by Chef Jimmy Lebron (of 27 Restaurant), who created a small menu of wine-friendly bites to pair.\n\nThere’s nothing like a little adrenaline to bring you and your S.O. closer together. Rent bikes onsite or bring your own to Shark Valley, a scenic loop and observation tower located in the heart of the Everglades National Park’s freshwater marsh (entrance is $30 per vehicle). Get up close and personal with nature: The paved loop is wide enough to keep a safe distance from the abundant wildlife, including dozens of gators that spend their days catching rays along the trail’s edge.\n\nSet the mood: After all that adventure, calm your nerves and quell your lover’s appetite with—what else?—Cuban food. A stop at Miami staple Islas Canarias on your way back into the city will be just the trick.\n\nBall & Chain Saloon opened its doors in 1935 and has danced its way through many iterations since. The eclectic Calle Ocho venue lives up to its storied roots today by playing host to some of the best live salsa and jazz in Miami, usually without a cover. Boasting live entertainment every night of the week (much of which occurs inside an adorable pineapple-capped stage), Ball & Chain is Little Havana’s premier spot for live music of the hip-moving variety.\n\nSet the mood: Need to brush up on your moves? They host free salsa and bachata lessons several days a week. Check the website for an up-to-date schedule.\n\nFormerly known as the Versace Mansion, the Villa Casa Casuarina Hotel remains a flashy (obv) three-story Italianate palace built in 1930 and supposedly modeled on Christopher Columbus’s home in Genoa. Apart from its spine-tingling history as the murder scene of the famed fashion designer, this members-only country club/hotel draws guests with its decadent restaurant, Gianni’s. But even with the bloodstains long gone, its front steps are still the most photographed spot in town.\n\nSet the mood: For the full experience, book a couple’s holiday at the hotel. The Romantic Escape package (check website for pricing and availability) includes a three-course dinner for two at the on-site Gianni’s Restaurant and one bottle of red or white house wine.\n\nLarge organizations and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service send animals in need of extra care to this privately owned sanctuary, where they’re rehabilitated and domesticated to thrive in controlled environments. If you and your boo dig animals, this lush spot nestled unsuspectingly in the ’burbs offers unparalleled opportunities to get up close and personal. Pre-book one of several interactive encounters for an additional cost and spend time holding, cuddling and learning about these remarkable creatures.\n\nSet the mood: Ready to take the next step and try out coparenting with your lover? For a $4,000 initial fee and $800 a month for maintenance (hey, still cheaper than having an actual kid), you two can become the proud adoptive parents of a Bengal tiger, a two-toed sloth or any number of other ZWF residents, allowing you up to 50 visits with your baby.\n\nMiami’s got plenty of options when it comes to waterfront dining, but for this quintessential romantic experience, you don’t have to travel off the mainland. A staple in the Miami food scene since before there was one, chef Michael Schwartz serves up elevated, Latin-inspired fare in a gorgeous multi-level bayfront venue. Minutes from Wynwood, downtown and the historic MiMo district, Amara is in a sweet spot for any occasion.\n\nSet the mood: Too nervous for a full meal? Grab a sunset drink and a snack on the breezy, first-come-first-served rooftop, offering panoramic sunset views of the bay. You’ll quell the butterflies and get some eyelashes batting.\n\nThere’s something inherently sexy about working up a sweat before cooling off in the salty waters of Biscayne Bay. At this sprawling North Miami state park featuring over a thousand acres of wilderness bike trails and rivers, take your pick of a kayak, canoe or paddle boards, weave through the mangroves and venture out to the Haulover Sandbar, where sun-seeking revelers park their vessels and hang out all day long.\n\nSet the mood: Each full moon, Oleta guides a moonlit kayak tour during which you’ll learn about local history and wildlife. Expect to stop several times throughout the tour for water breaks and a light snack.\n\nThe longstanding Le Bouchon in Coconut Grove has all the trappings of a cozy French bistro: wooden tables, checkerboard flooring, dim lighting and warm, familiar service. Serving up the cuisine of Lyon with a splash of Miami, it’s the ideal date-night spot if you’re in the mood for a bit of classic romance in the form of fresh, gooey cheese and decadent foie gras.\n\nSet the mood: You’ll likely leave Le Bouchon feeling like a couple of stuffed bries, so why not walk it off? One of Miami’s most charming and pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, the Grove is an ideal spot for a moonlit stroll, and you can stop for coffee at Panther or ice cream from Salt & Straw before calling it a night."
