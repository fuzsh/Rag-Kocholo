        "text": "October 19, 2023\n\nOmg I can't wait for this one!!!\n\nALSO LIZ CONFIRMED BOOK 5 IS RIO'S IN AN INTERVIEW. I'M FREAKING OUT!!!\n\nEdit:\n\nBOOK 4 IS GONNA BE ISAIAH AND KENNEDY YOU GUYS!!! (yet to be confirmed by liz)\n\nBook review:\n\nJust finished reading this one and OMG!!!! I'm still processing my thoughts. Liz raises the bar everytime when she releases a new book.\n\nKai and Miller are such a dream couple. The first half of the book made me cry because of their banter and the last twenty percent made me a crying mess. I can still feel my eyes burning.\n\nThis is such a long book but I flew through this one. The story is so captivating. Loved seeing the previous couples and also the future couples whose story we are yet to see.\n\nI love Miller and Kai to bits but I gotta say that Max stole the show.\n\nAlso that little spoiler for the next book??? Heck yeah!!! Can't wait for Isaiah and Kennedy to have the spotlight!!!\n\nJuly 13, 2024\n\nThey had me giggling & kicking my feet so much I cannot wait to start the next one 🏃🏻‍♀️ 💨\n\nOctober 19, 2023\n\n4 🌟\n\nOMGGGG KAI IS EVERYTHINGGGGG WHATTTT\n\nI literally loved this dynamic so much, also do not usually love a single parent trope because I am bot a huge fan of kids in books but why was this one so adorable, every interaction with Max just had mt heart melted\n\nKai was literally one of my fav book bf's I have read this year, like the constant thoughtfulness and how he could just read her 🫠\n\nI also loved miller buttttt I hate the whole 'I am not getting attached to you because I am leaving but I am totally getting attached and we both know it but I am just using it as an excuse for a 3rd act conflict' STOP that whole plot made me so mad but I still loved this book! and I can not wait for there next in the series!!\n\nOctober 20, 2023\n\nLet me tell you this love confession in this book was one of the most beautiful love confessions I’ve read in a long time. I was losing it\n\nOctober 13, 2023\n\nIt’s a five star read. I know it. You know it. Everybody knows it.\n\nYOU GUYS!!!!! This book deserves more than 5 stars. I feel like I am not doing this book justice by giving it just 5 stars!!!!!! Liz has out done her self. This book is so amazing and so beautiful and so cute and so hot and so funny and wow. I cried, I laughed, and at the end I just stared at my ceiling with tears rolling down my face because it ended and I didn’t want it to end. Mile high was my top fave of Liz’s books but Caught Up tops it. I just. I’m speechless. Also can I just say her playlists are ALWAYS top tier and I don’t even listen to them often but hers always gets me.\n\nOctober 19, 2023\n\nin liz tomforde we trust 🫂\n\nJuly 10, 2024\n\n2.5/5\n\nThis book should be about Miller's dad, Monty. He was the daddy here. On my knees for this man.\n\nOctober 8, 2023\n\nthe audacity to write a book that somehow rivals the right move??????\n\nOctober 13, 2023\n\n“ I simply stopped running when the two best boys I know caught me.“\n\ni’m so disappointed and kind of sad that i didn’t love and enjoy this book as much as i wanted to. all the right ingredients were present to depict the perfect romance and with author’s writing i had no doubt that i would literally devour this story. my problem is; i felt no spark between the protagonists, no chemistry or alchemy. i didn’t root for them. i didn’t hate them but i didn’t love them either. everything felt bland for at least the first 70% of the plot but the 30% left got me all the feels and i wish it was sufficient to say i enjoyed this book.\n\nhowever i have some complaints :\n\ni don’t understand why the opening scene of the female protagonist’s point of view was about how she got harassed at her workplace and then why another female —kennedy— (working with the baseball team) had the exact same treatment with being sexualized in her work environment EVERYDAY by the mmc’s brother —Isaiah— -should act like it’s simple playfulness. the double standard is standarding.\n\nand it’s obvious that the next book is about these two which is making me really uncomfortable.\n\n\"there’s not a guy on the team who doesn’t think she’s the best athletic trainer we have, but my brother can’t not flirt with her even if his life depended on it.”\n\nso him begging her to rub and massage his dick whenever she has to give him a professional massage after a game is \"flirting\" huh, okay.\n\nbest part:\n\n•the last 30%-20% of the book were gem. i loved every minute of them.\n\n•Max —the kid— was the highlight of the book and i wish he talked more.\n\n•the bond between the fmc and max was really precious.\n\n•i wish the book was about the fmc’s dad or hope he’ll have his own book and his happily ever after. the man dropped everything including his promising career as a professional baseball player at 25yo when his girlfriend died and adopted her daughter—fmc— and treated her like his own. I NEED HIS OWN BOOK, HE DESERVES A HAPPY END.\n\n“you just took a bite of one of those little cucumber sandwiches, looked her square in the eye, and said, ‘this is my dad.’ It was the first time you had ever called me that, and after the tea party I cried in your school’s bathroom for a solid thirty minutes.”[…]\n\n“ It was one of the best days of my life. one of the scariest too, because that name holds so much weight. so much responsibility. and all I wanted to do was live up to it.“\n\n•this cute moment and detail about Rayan and Indy’s weeding when they shared their vows got me literally sobbing.\n\n“ Ryan and Indy speak with both their voices and their hands the entire time as well.”\n\n———\n\nIT’S FINALLY HERE!! so excited\n\nOctober 30, 2023\n\nKai is the blueprint and I’m obsessed with Miller 😭 Wow wow wow it’s been awhile since I’ve given a book like this 5 stars, but when it makes me laugh, cry, and smile, it’s very deserving. Loved it so much.\n\nNovember 27, 2023\n\n3.75 ☆\n\n\"I simply stopped running when the two best boys I know caught me.”\n\nThis was one of my most anticipated reads as Liz is a go-to author for me, but this one just didn't hit like I wanted or thought it would. This had so much potential, but there were just some moments that I couldn't agree with. Those moments are what made me give this a lower rating than what I wanted. I, however, still enjoyed it mostly. I just wanted and expected more.\n\nCaught Up is the third book in the Windy City series. It is a single dad/nanny, he falls first and harder, forced proximity, found family baseball sports romance with banter that had me laughing, tension, and moments of tears from sadness and happiness both.\n\nMalaki \"Kai\" Rhodes plays baseball for the Chigago Windy City Warriros and is having a hard time balancing between being a single parent and his career so much so that he has contiplated early retirement on many occasions. He has fired the latest nanny for his 15 month old son Max, another that didn't work out. It's then that his coach Monty has come up with an idea for his daughter to be the new nanny. That's where Miller Montgomery comes in. She has just quite her job as a pastry chef deciding to take a break and travel with her dad and will return back to work at the end of summer. Will Miller work out, or will he fire her too? And will she be able to leave them when summer comes to an end?\n\n“Maybe he should loosen up every once in a while. He’s got a cute- ass kid and an even cuter smile when he shows it.”\n\nI had the biggest smile plastered on my face the moment that the other couples appeared from the previous books. I ate up the moments that we got more of Ryan and Indy. I loved the moments with Rio and his humor. We do meet some new side chatacters. Monty, who is Miller's dad, I loved this man, and he deserves the world and his own happy ending in a book. We also met Isiah, who is Kai's younger brother and Kennedy, one of the teams trainers. I didn't care much for Isaiah with how he treats her. He sexually harasses her, and it's portrayed as being okay and is most definitely not. Then there is Max, who is the cutest little boy, and I adored every minute we got with him. He was a little show stealer that also stole my heart. The found family that is portrayed with not just Kai, Max and Miller but with all the previous couples, the new characters, and the entirety of the baseball team was so beautiful and I was living for it!\n\n“You flirting with me, Montgomery?” “Have been since we met. You gonna start flirting back?”\n\nTheir chemistry is there until it's not. I'm not sure if that makes sense. It felt like it was strong when Miller put her guard down, but then she would pull away, and it felt like it faded away for her more for her at least. It happened when she would give the reminders that she is leaving at the end of summer. It was during these times that she annoyed me. I also had a love-hate relationship with her nickname for Kai \"Baseball Daddy\" because at first I loved it but then felt it was overused. Other than that, she is a strong woman who is just trying to make her dad proud with her accomplishments. I absolutely loved how she was with Max. Their times spent together were so precious. Especially the moments when she lets him help her bake. I fell for Kai right from the start he is stable, responsible, sweet, and the best dad who only wants the best for his son. He is the calm to Millers chaos. One of my favorite moments showcasing how sweet he is had me swooning. He helped Miller get her makeup off and applied her skincare before bed because she had gotten drunk with the girls. This just melted my heart.\n\n\"I’d fall in love with you all over again. I’d break my heart all over again because loving you was one of the two greatest surprises of my life.”\n\nThere is a third act breakup, but it's not unnecessary. I say that because we know it's coming. The premise around it was known throughout between both Kai and Miller. The last 20% of this hit so hard, but I loved it so much. I felt the emotions and heartbreak that they were both going through so deeply, making me a crying mess on multiple occasions. On a final note, I wish that we were getting Rio's book next, but we're getting Isaiah and Kennedy's, and I'm not sure how I feel about that yet.\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\nThe way I want to drop my cr and read this RN! Maybe I'll take a break from my spooky season reads and read it next 🤭🤭\n\nMay 22, 2024\n\nbook so boring it put me in a slump 😪\n\nafter the phenomenal experience that was The Right Move , i had huge expectations from our rich hot single daddy clark kent of baseball. this was one of my most anticipated reads this year and to say i am disappointed might be an understatement. caught up SUCKS. like eating a boiled egg with a ketchup SUCKS.\n\nHOW CAN YOU GO FROM RYAN SHAY AND INDY IVERS TO THIS!?!?\n\ngod the urge to dnf this book was so strong but just because this is written by liz tomforde, i held myself back. dear lord, don't test me like that again 🙏\n\nme asf the entire book:\n\nhello liz?? where did you forget the chemistry????\n\nnothing happens for the majority of this book. this was such a draaaaaaag fucking hell get these authors a decent editor.\n\nmiller. miller. miller. miller \"i'm leaving in 2 months\" miller. miller \"i don't do attached\" miller. miller \"i don't wanna get settled\" miller. i don't even understand what's such a big deal with her. she refuses to settle down. she is so adamant about forming relationships. at first i found her attachment issues relatable, but then it got annoying pretty quickly. not to belittle anyone's struggles and experiences, but i found her reason to be a nomad so dumb. trust me, i get her guilt of being successful because her father gave up his own career for her, you go girl do your thing!! BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE FRIENDS OR BE IN A RELATIONSHIP?? \"the high end style of the restaurant does not allow chefs to settle down\"- what!? i'm pretty sure gordan ramsey has a wife and kids out there. and i'm pretty sure you don't have more work hours than a doctor, who faces no issue in settling down. this reason is so stupid omfg.\n\nALSO, there's a thing called long distance relationship babe, in case you were unaware 😃😃😃😃😃\n\nand then she was whining about not being able to keep up with the pressure of pleasing the critics, okay i get it. happens to the best of us. she does not want to work in someone else's restaurant, she wants to make the dishes she pleases to, for the people she loves- OKAY BIG FUCKING DEAL OPEN YOUR OWN GODDAMN PATISSERIE OR A RESTAURANT AND MAKE YOUR OWN NAME!! OWN YOUR OWN DISHES!! that doesn't make you any less of a chef. all the highly acclaimed chefs run their own restaurants. her bitching and moaning felt so senseless at one point that it started grating on my nerves LIKE GIRL IT AIN'T THAT DEEP FFS 💢\n\nIsaiah gets me:-\n\n“You and Miller, you both do things out of guilt and it’s annoying. You, because you didn’t want me to feel the effects of Mom dying and Dad leaving. And Miller because she’s trying to do all these big things to make up for Monty not being able to.”\n\nthis woman is so corny and for what? she has been dropping sexual comments on her BOSS since their first interaction. and ofc our sweet celibate kai, who hates nannies in general and who doesn't even think of anyone else except his kid max is BEWITCHED by her right in first look🙄 guess pretty privilege definitely takes you a long way cuz my ass would have been fired straight away.\n\ni'm all about filthy witty banters but theirs was just corny. i like my romances with decent development and a sweet burning build up. if y'all are fuck-flirting since your first interaction, very well knowing how in contrast that is to the mc's character, it doesn't make your banter hot, it makes it cringe.\n\nHands in my pockets, I nod towards the opposite side of the house. “Come.”\n\n“God,” she moans, head falling back. “I can’t wait to hear you say that in the bedroom.”\n\noooooohh she's so unhinged, she's such a badass, she's so bold 🤡🤡🤡🤡\n\nthis was only her second proper interaction WITH. HER. BOSS. LIKE???????? HOW DO YOU NOT CRINGE???????? WAS THIS THE PART WHERE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HOOT AND WHISTLE???????? cuz i promise u i didn't get the memo\n\nmax is repellant to every woman but the very first time he meets miller he's throwing himself to her and kai is mesmerized by it bcz his son has never liked a woman before except miller, like how cliché can this get🙄\n\ntheir \"meet cute\" was him firing another nanny and her walking into the elevator double-fisting two bottles of corona at 9am in the morning. but yeah kai, the overprotective dad who has fired far too many nannies that deems concerning atp, has no problem hiring this unqualified, inexperienced woman whose first impression was being a reckless alcoholic as his kid's nanny well because... she's our fmc 🤷‍♀️\n\nright in the first chapter, we see miller getting sexualised by her workmate and how she quits her job because of it and the next chapter we see kai's entire teaming hooting \"hot nanny\" and behaving like a bunch of fucking cavemen who haven't seen a patch of skin in decades, but it's supposed to be sexy because 1. it's kai's team 2. it's a bunch of hot athletes.\n\nkai rhodes. yawn 🥱. he's too bland to be called the clark kent of baseball. i get all the grumpy single dad attitude but bro the least you can do is not be boring 🥱\n\npoint to be noted, i don't hate either of the mc's, i just found them to be too bland and boring for my taste. and whiny too.\n\ni failed to connect to either of their struggles. i feel their relationship could've been sorted out so easily only if they sat down, opened up about their feelings and sorted out a solution like normal mature adults. people with different career choices date all the time and they are no different. but NO we had to go through all the \"this is just a fling\", \"let's not get attached\", \"let's not be in a relationship\", \"let's not do intimate moments\" and then a fucking third act breakup all this to lead to a cheesy ass ending.\n\ni did get all mushy and sappy at some parts, especially when max called her mama🥺 i love this kid sfm😩😭 i loved all his moments with miller, monty and the rest of the team. isaiah and kennedy are next in the series, and although they haven't gripped much of my attention but i'm still eager to read their book.\n\nand the love confession dear lord 😫🤌\n\n“Miller, you’re not just another person.” He won’t look at me, his attention locked on the ground, and I catch the first tear fall from under his glasses, hitting the floor. “You put me first when I forgot how to. You reminded me what it felt like to be important, to be chosen first. I know you wanted this to be easy and detached, but you’re fucking in here.” His fingers meet his chest, tapping it a couple of times, blue eyes meeting mine, and full of pain. “You’re everywhere, and when you leave tomorrow, I’ll still see you everywhere. In this kitchen. In Max’s room. In my bed. There’s nothing about us that’s easy. This is fucking miserable, Miller, knowing there’s a clock counting down the seconds until I don’t have you anymore, but I’d do it all over again. I’d fall in love with you all over again. I’d break my heart all over again because loving you was one of the two greatest surprises of my life.”\n\nthe typical liz tomforde effect. she's so good at writing over-sentimental scenes😩\n\n“Miller,” he says, making sure my attention is on him. “If you ever decide to stop running and make a home . . . Make it with me.”\n\nAt the end of the day, i'm just a girl 👉👈🎀\n\nJuly 28, 2024\n\n4.75 stars\n\n“With my name on her back and my son in her arms, Miller stands in the center of the field, looking like mine.”\n\nI am finding my happy and comfort place in this series. Each new book in this series brings so much warmth, joy and contentment in my life. It's like being wrapped up in your favourite worn out cozy blanket on chilly autumn days and it's the best feeling ever.\n\nLiz Tomforde and men written by her have a special place in my heart. She truly writes the best contemporary romances filled with swoon-worthy moments, wholesome and emotional found family moments, a hopeful and beautiful romantic story giving us all the soulmatism vibes. She is the queen of writing green flags and I am mesmerised by her ability to create characters like Ryan Shay and Kai Rhodes, who are the definition of gentlemen. This series is one of the healthy ones I have ever read.\n\n“You think you can keep this casual, Mills?” I nod frantically, hoping to convince both of us. His laugh is silent but rumbles against me. “Best of luck to you with that.”\n\nLiz portrayed unexpected responsibilities in life and how sometimes some people completely change the axis of your whole life, in this case it was Max and how him coming in Kai's life was the biggest yet the best thing to ever happen in such a realistic manner. To see their father-son relationship and how they have support, love and care from everyone around them was everything. I love it when kids in books are an essential part of the story and Max is one of most important part of Miller and Kai's story. He is the one who brought them together and deepened their emotional bonding. Their mundane and special family moments together were everything, especially, those baking lessons. I have a serious baby fever because of this book now because Max is the cutest and funniest kid ever.\n\n“This wild woman is my son’s calm. And in a lot of ways, I think I might be hers.”\n\n➸ Miller Montgomery is struggling in her career due to the burnout so she decided to become a nanny for Kai's son, Max, and to stay close with her dad. I love Miller's character so much. She is a badass woman, the life of the party, has witty banter skills and a reckless and wild side that just made me love her even more. But mostly she is compassionate for the people she loves and she'd do anything to protect them. And the way she fell in love with Max and Kai at the time? It was everything. I love her relationship with Max and it was sweet to see her develop this motherly bond with Kai's son when all she ever wanted was an unattached life but little did she know that she was about to be caught up by two boys who'll become her whole world.\n\n“I have a new dream now. You and Max are my dream.”\n\n➸ Kai Rhodes is my dream man. Single dads are my kryptonite and Kai is the definition of a dad and a gentleman. The man who loves with every fiber of his being. The way he is raising his son is commendable, and though he has his self-doubts and fears, he always tries his best for Max. Kai never felt enough since he became a dad, he was always the one who helped others and it was hard for him to ask for help from others and to see him get help from Miller without asking her because she's just amazing like that just made my heart swell. I liked how he came out of his 'I am just a dad' zone and remembered who he is as a person with Miller's help. The confident and self-assured man with a thoughtful and kind personality. And the things he did for Miller? How he was always so supportive of her career and how he helped her with her recipes. I couldn't help but love him in this book.\n\n“If she’d let me have her, she’d be mine. I love the girl, and I try to show her through my actions, but if she ever gave me the green light, I’d tell her too.”\n\n: ̗̀➛ Kai and Miller\n\nKai and Miller are soulmates for sure. Two people crossing paths for a two short months and discovering the meaning of love and family together. Kai who always felt alone in his responsibilities and Miller who is always striving for next goal in her life but never felt enough but they reminded each other how important and loved they are with flaws and all. They found something special and their own together and it was amazing to see them explore their growing love and grow together as a family. How Miller helped Kai feel more than just a dad and how Kai made sure Miller realised that she is loved and cherished and that her worth is not derived just from her career and goals. Also, the angst and impending decisions related to Miller's career only heightened the tension and connection between them. I love seeing them fall for each other but mostly I loved how Miller fell in love with Max and treated him as his own child all the time. I loved how they both showed and accepted each other's vulnerable facets of life and helped each other in figuring out their lives.\n\n“Miller,” he says, making sure my attention is on him. “If you ever decide to stop running and make a home . . . Make it with me.”\n\nTheir romance is a balance of wholesome, spicy, vulnerable and emotional moments. It was exceptional and beautifully crafted with one of my favourite tropes of all time, single dad. The found family arc that is weaved in the core of this story giving it a very nostalgic and home like feeling. The slow-burn is exquisitely builded-up with the tangible and effervescent sexual tension and growing emotional intimacy and vulnerability between the main characters. To simply say, it was pure perfection.\n\n“You’re my favorite person, Miller, and for once I had someone for me. I had someone taking care of me. After being alone for so long, I finally had someone looking out for me.”\n\nThis review won't be complete without me writing about Monty because this man is perfect! I need Liz to write his book because he deserves his own love story. He is the inspiration for all the dads in the world because he raised his girlfriend's daughter all by himself and even though he made many sacrifices he never stopped working hard for her and raised Miller with so much love and care. It takes love and efforts to be a dad.\n\n“She’s not my blood, but she’s my girl,” Monty says from beside me. “And she looks at your boy, who is not her blood, in the same way I look at her.”\n\nTheir love confession is one of my favourite chapter because it was so beautifully written. The epilogue was perfect. Liz writes one of the best epilogues ever. I am so excited for Isaiah's book though I was not his biggest fan in this book. But accidental marriage in Vegas is a delicious trope and in Liz Tomforde we believe. She can do wrong in my eyes.\n\n———————\n\nUpdating my rating bcs i cannot stop thinking about Malakai Rhodes and this damn book 🤭\n\nMalakai Rhodes can wife me up any time🧎🏽‍♀️ this world will be a better place if only all the men were written by Liz Tomforde. RTC\n\n——————\n\nme 🫂 single dad romances\n\nalso mmc named kai never disappoints 😗\n\nOctober 12, 2023\n\nAre you looking for a 500 page book where the h pushes the H away for 465 pages (aka 91%), where they finally get together on page 485 (95% aka the end of the chapter before the epilogue)? Well then I’m happy to announce that this is the book for you!!\n\nAs someone who loves long books, I can honestly say, this book had no reason to be as long as it was. There was no character development with Miller and it was just the same thing every chapter of her pushing him away and reminding him she’s leaving and won’t consider staying.\n\nMiller LITERALLY pushed the H away the ENTIRE book. I couldn’t find anything really sweet about this book because she always felt the need to remind that she was leaving and would not consider staying. And she did leave. Only convinced to go back (at 90 fucking something percent) by some random person. I actually hated miller. I don’t understand all the reviews that loved her because she just got under my skin with how she was so unbendable about being with Kai and max.\n\nKai was cool-ish but I felt bad that he was stuck with someone like miller.\n\nMiller ruined what was my most anticipated book of the year. She was unbearable. After going from reading Indy and Ryan’s book (one of my favorite books) where it felt like they actually liked each other, to THIS where Miller just absolutely refused to be with Kai, was very jarring\n\nJuly 5, 2024\n\nDNF @58% I just can't. Idgaf about these characters and I can't stand the FMC.\n\nNext up for contemporary romance/sports romance - I really hope Kai is as freaking delightful as Ryan.\n\nAyushi, Betty? Tea my loves? 🤭💖⚾\n\nOctober 10, 2023\n\nSHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN. CONSTANTLY RAISING THE BAR.\n\nUGH, this was so good. i am so obsessed with kai, miller, and their little family with max 😭\n\nkai is having a very tough time adjusting to life as a single dad while managing a professional baseball career. but his coach, monty, won’t let him waste his potential and retire so he does everything he can to accommodate max. when kai’s most recent nanny doesn’t work out, monty commissions his daughter, a gourmet pastry chef on sabbatical, to fill in for the summer.\n\ni honestly have no words for this story. i have too many words. ugh, i just loved it and them so so much. first, it starts out as a little grumpy sunshine because kai is so overprotective of his son and is VERY skeptical about miller’s abilities but over time, he falls head over heels and spends the rest of the time trying to convince her she has a place with them.\n\ntheir chemistry and banter was off the charts. their flirting had me giggling and kicking my feet the entire book. AND GOD, the relationships they both had with max. kai had one of my favorite single dad stories ever. i am such a sucker for an mmc who loves to take care of everyone. and miller was so skeptical that she’d be a good nanny but became the absolute best and i just can’t 😭 she has a tendency to run and kai just wanted him and max to be the home she could always have.\n\nliz’s spice is ALWAYS hot and you will be dying for these two to finally give in and when they do!!!!\n\nthere are so many amazing new characters in this book but also cameos and joyous future updates from our favorite couples. i’m DYING so isaiah and kennedy’s story. he was so so funny. but please, liz, god, mother nature, WHOEVER is listening, i NEED monty to have a story… preferably with me 🤪\n\nliz just manages to always write such special stories with the most amazing characters and caught up is no exception. you will love it.\n\nFebruary 5, 2024\n\n5 stars\n\n“Today was a good day.”\n\nCaught Up was the perfect book for me. It had so many things I love in it. Single parent and nanny, the cutest kid ever, sports romance, baking (one of my favorite hobbies after reading), and all the emotions I love and crave in romance. Liz Tomforde has not just one (The Right Move is my #1 favorite book of 2023) but two books in my top favorites of 2023 because this one will be high up on the list!\n\nMiller never planned to be a nanny. In fact, she is one of the top pastry chefs in her field, but she is burnt out and needs a break. She decides to go to Chicago to spend some time with her dad (who is a baseball coach) and that’s where she meets Malachi. Kai. Baseball Daddy.\n\nKai is a single dad and only wants the best for his son, Max. Because of that, he goes through nannies… one right after the other. He’s a pro baseball player and his team is supportive, but they need a nanny that will last the rest of the season. He’s skeptical when it comes to Miller Montgomery, but he loves Miller’s father so he gives her a try.\n\nMiller + Kai + Max = everything. The romance between the couple is perfect, the relationship between Kai and his son was the most beautiful and heartwarming, and don’t even get me started on the bond that Miller develops with Max. It’s the best thing ever. When Max finally gets her name out, and instead of Miller its Mama he’s trying to say… I bawled honestly this is everything I want in a romance. I’ll take no criticism with this book it’s as close to perfect as they come.\n\nI’m honestly obsessed with this book and this series as a whole. I have a feeling who the 4th book will be about (confirmed that Rio will be the 5th) and I’m stoked to keep reading about these characters. This is one of those books that I know I’ll find myself rereading time and time again!\n\n“They’re all going to be good days.”\n\nAudio book source: Audible\n\nStory Rating: 5 stars\n\nNarrators: Megan Wicks & Alex Kidd\n\nNarration Rating: 5 stars\n\nGenre: Sports Romance\n\nLength: 14h 50m\n\nRead\n\nOctober 11, 2023\n\ndnf 25%\n\nIncredibly bored.\n\nI don't understand what their relationship is meant to be. They aren't friends, they aren't enemies, they aren't even frenemies. The insta-lust was pretty much instantaneous, so they are stuck in this weird courting limbo where they flirt heavily but never do anything about it. And that would be fine if it didn't feel so fruitless, considering all they do is mentally fuck eachother all day but there is no tension to speak of.\n\nThis is so long and for what? If this is what it's gonna be like for the rest of the book, then Imma go ahead and listen to the wise words TJ had said to me:\n\n\"I'd recommend finishing it to most people but prob not you\" 🤡\n\nthank you bae, although I am mildly offended you were right.\n\nOctober 22, 2023\n\n4.5 ⭐️!!!!!!!!!\n\nmiller. wow. she was one of my favorite mc’s ever??? she was hilarious, witty, fun, but still had her issues that we got to see her work through!!! obsessed.\n\nand kai <333 oh baseball daddy. it took him so long to open up but when he did.. slay.\n\nand that ENDING??? i’m sobbing.\n\ni need the next book… and i need it IMMEDIATELY.\n\n“this was a good day.”\n\n“they could all be good days.”\n\nJanuary 6, 2024\n\n2024: Changing this to one star because people keep liking this review and it’s just a reminder of how much I hated this book.\n\n————————————————————————————\n\nDNF at 58%- life’s too short to put up with reading more of Miller Montgomery…\n\nI’m free of ever having to read the phrase “Baseball Daddy”! I prayed for times like this.\n\nBoth of the mc’s are way too dramatic for their own good. “Baseball daddy” was so cringe. Miller is just “not like other girls 🤪”. There’s just zero connection between these two characters.\n\n1 star for Monty and 1 star for Max. They made this book bearable for the amount that I read, idk what else to tell you…\n\nThis book did not, in fact, slap.\n\nMaybe I’ll pick up and try again but not anytime soon…\n\n————————————————————————————\n\nWe all know this book is gonna slap\n\nJuly 19, 2024\n\nI need Malakai like I need AIR!\n\nHow is it like every Kai in books is this swoon-worthy, it's not fair!!\n\n4 stars 🌟\n\n------------------\n\npre-read\n\ni feel left out that everyone is reading play along, so started this one!😂😭\n\nJanuary 11, 2024\n\n♾️⭐️\n\n133 highlights, 14 crying sessions, & plenty of laughs later….\n\nThis might be my favorite romance book…. Ever. I have literally never cried this much in a romance book (that’s technically not supposed to make you cry) if that makes sense 🥹\n\nI am absolutely blown away. Like this series is GOLD. But, this book KNOCKS the first two out of the water.\n\nI am in love with Kai and Miller. They are BOTH top tier mmc/fmc’s.\n\nI’m already planning a reread because this book is absolutely everything. The relationship between Miller and Monty. The relationship between Miller and Max 🥹🥹🥹 The LOVE and support from Kai for Miller. Like … omg I was a mess the entire book.\n\nDid I send a 9 minute video to my friends of me crying? YES. Am I planning to already reread this book sometime later this year? ALSO YES.\n\nSimply, in love. 💗\n\n✨sports romance, baseball\n\n✨single dad\n\n✨nanny\n\n✨forced proximity\n\n✨coaches daughter\n\n✨found family\n\nSpice: 3 / 5\n\nCry meter: 3.5 / 5\n\n“With my name on her back and my son in her arms, Miller stands in the center of the field, looking like mine.

I want her for a lot longer than she plans on being here, and if there's any part of her that'd be willing to want me in return, I'll be selfish as fuck and take her.\"\n\nFirst up we have Kai Rhodes, the starting pitcher for the Chicago MLB team. The Clark Kent hype is REAL!!! I am obsessed. Now now, before everything I want to clarify Evan Zanders and Ryan Shay are still top tier not even joking but Kai Rhodes has just joined the list people. I mean the way he cares for Max is everything and the protectiveness is so yummy I legit gobbled it all up!! Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed!!\n\n\"If you're going to start coming to my games, I better see Rhodes on your back and I'm not talking about my brother.\"\n\n\"If you're as terrible of a listener in the bedroom as you are in real life, Miller, I can promise you this, you wouldn't be allowed to come.\"\n\nAnd we have Miller Montgomery. Just getting this out of the way, we all knew it was coming. She can run over me with her green Mercedes van and I will replenish her whole makeup and skincare routine. PEOPLE SHE IS THAT GIRL!!! Does she have insecurities? Yes. Is she an overachiever? Yes. Did I legit sob at any and every scene she had with Monty? Absolutely! My heart broke for her and yet she was still a complete and utter badass and all of her quips, comebacks, and innuendos were everything!!! I am obsessed with her just as with Kai.

I cannot wait for this to come out. So excited for Kai’s story!!\n\n———————————————————————————\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Another masterpiece! Kai, Miller and Max have my heart! I will definitely cry my eyes out when this series comes to an end!\n\nNovember 25, 2023\n\nif “mr.responsible” was so responsible there wouldn’t be a ugly gremlin\n\n“You know, sometimes I look at him and get irrationally mad at you because you were with another woman before me. The audacity you had not to think of me then, you know?”\n\nthis sums up how i feel abt this and every other single dad book out there and yes it’s totally rational. only thing is unlike the fmc i wouldn’t go anywhere near that mess. unless it was put for adoption or something. she was too nice to them imo\n\nand isaiah’s book is next ? another whore who fucked around on his fmc right in front of her face?? for years ???? bc he couldn’t have her??? was two whores just not enough in this series??? liz you better make rio a virgin 🤨 better yet just skip straight to his book.\n\n- - - - -\n\ntasnia you better not abandon me on the buddy hate read. be sure to write it in your schedule 🫶🏻\n\nat this point my avoid shelf is looking like books to torture/trigger myself with for no good reason other than the fact that i’m a masochist\n\ni hope she actually listened to people’s criticisms this time about writing stories that aren’t hers to tell\n\n- - - -\n\ncant wait to see another woman end up providing free babysitting services and other forms of labor for a rich man aka the end of almost every single nanny+single dad trope. love to see it\n\nThe guy could be out partying every night, getting away with any and every thing, but instead, he’s at home taking care of his son as a single dad. here is his 🏅🎖️🎗️🥇🏆🏆 the bar for men 🥺it’s giving “i babysit my kids”\n\n“And who is this?” Kai’s eyes linger on the woman at my side… in a you’re one of the most beautiful women I’ve had the pleasure to lay eyes on way.\n\nthis isn’t the fmc btw\n\nHe takes her hand, shaking it, his eyes twinkling like he just found the future mother of his child. “I’m Kai, but you can call me Ace.” “Ace, huh? What’s with the nickname?” “Always been the best pitcher on the team. I’ve got good hands. The right touch. In case you were curious.” still not the fmc\n\n“You don’t have a kid. You have a baby.” Indy’s tone switches to soft and sweet, her smile beaming as she looks through Kai’s phone. “Yeah,” he sighs. “And he’s looking for a mom.”\n\nHe moved here last spring then found out his ex had his baby when she dropped him off at Kai’s doorstep and skipped town.” ig condoms/protection don’t work no more. i hope the gremlin isn’t his 🤞🏻 and she was cheating on him 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻\n\nOctober 13, 2023\n\nPlease, Lord, have mercy and grant me the strength to carry on after this book! I don't know how many times I can repeat it but I can't keep living without a grumpy DILF, I won't, I NEED one. Just one, I won't be greedy and ask for three 👀\n\nOkay, but seriously, I absolutely loved this book, it is by far my favorite in the series. I could not get enough of the characters, Kai and Miller were so perfect together and individually. I love how clever and funny Miller is, she has a comeback for everything. Don't even get me started on the banter and chemistry between Kai and Miller; the way they came together and slowly became a family was everything. I could write a whole review on Max alone, how is he literally the cutest?!?! The one fault I'll say I had with the book, is the length. I don't know why Liz Tomforde feels the need to make every book in this series so long, but I will say it again, contemporary romances do not need to be 400+ pages. I would have enjoyed this book substantially more if it was only 350 pages, I don't need 100 pages of filler.\n\nOctober 11, 2023\n\nI LOVE THIS BOOK WITH ALL OF MY HEART. I was so emotional when finishing because I just didn’t want it to end.\n\nI couldn’t put this book down. Kai and Miller have such a beautiful story and their dynamic with Max made my heart so happy. These three were meant to be a family and I absolutely adore them so much. The amount of times I cried while reading this book is embarrassing but it really hit me in the feels.\n\nI might’ve cried a lot but I was also smiling and kicking my feet during every cute scene. Obsessed would be an understatement. Kai is truly everything and more (and the fact that he wears glasses makes him even hotter). The way he talks about Miller and Max literally will make you swoon.\n\nIf you love:\n\n♡ single dad + nanny\n\n♡ baseball romance\n\n♡ coach’s daughter\n\n♡ one bed\n\n♡ he falls first\n\nYou need to immediately pick this book up! It exceeded my expectations and I hope you love it as much as I did.\n\n“Miller,” he says, making sure my attention is on him. “If you ever decide to stop running and make a home…Make it with me.” 😭🩷"
