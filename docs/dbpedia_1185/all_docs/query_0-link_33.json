        "text": "Comedy couples! Saturday Night Live may be known for bringing laughs to viewers, but it’s also brought tons of stars together.\n\nFrom old-school SNL veterans like Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray, to more recent stars such as Colin Jost and Pete Davidson, a ton of the late-night staple’s cast has met their significant others while working on the NBC show.\n\nAkroyd fell in love with Carrie Fisher on the set of the Blues Brothers after initially meeting on the sketch comedy series. The pair later got engaged but called off the romance in 1980. Following the Stars Wars actress’ death in December 2016, the Ghostbusters actor penned a heartfelt tribute to Fisher.\n\n“One of the most brilliant and hilarious minds of our eon, Carrie would say things like: ‘I love tiny babies. When they cry, they turn red and look like screaming tomatoes.’ OR ‘This romance is finished the second you let out even a threep. I’ll be sick for a year,’” he wrote in an essay for Empire magazine in January 2017. “AND ‘You have a jawline, hold your chin up otherwise you look like a tuna.’ From then on I would identify myself on the phone as Tuna Neck.”\n\nJost, for his part, was first linked to Scarlett Johansson in May 2017 after they were spotted at an SNL afterparty following the show’s season 42 finale. After getting engaged in May 2019, the Black Widow actress hosted the hit comedy series seven months later and gushed over her then-fiancé.\n\n“This place means so much to me,” Johansson said at the time. “I have so many friends here, and I met the love of my life here.”\n\nNearly a year later, the lovebirds tied the knot in an intimate ceremony amid the coronavirus pandemic. Meals on Wheels announced the couple’s marriage in October 2020, via Instagram. “We’re thrilled to break the news that Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost were married over the weekend in an intimate ceremony with their immediate family and love ones,” the organization wrote.\n\nWhile some SNL-born relationships have crashed and burned — including Fred Armisen and Elisabeth Moss and Jason Sudeikis and Olivia Wilde — others have remained unbreakable.\n\nScroll through to see which stars found love while starring on the sketch comedy series."
