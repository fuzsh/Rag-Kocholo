        "text": "Preview:\n\nKeanu Reeves and Chad Stahelski are involved in a new ‘John Wick’ TV series.\n\n‘John Wick: The High Table’ will continue the movies’ story.\n\n‘The Old Man’ co-creator Robert Levin is running the show.\n\nWhile Lionsgate’s bosses seem convinced that more ‘John Wick’ theatrical releases will be on the way, it appears that the main duo involved in the movies so far –– star Keanu Reeves and director/producer Chad Stahelski –– are focusing their immediate efforts on the latest small-screen incarnation of the story.\n\nAccording to Deadline, Lionsgate now has Stahelski and Reeves involved in a new series called ‘John Wick: The High Table’, which the company will produce.\n\nWhat’s the story of ‘John Wick: The High Table’?\n\nThe new series picks up directly after the end of ‘John Wick: Chapter 4’.\n\nJohn Wick has left the world of the High Table in a tenuous position and a collection of new characters will look to make a name for themselves while some of the franchise stalwart characters remain committed to the old-world order.\n\nA description of the new series promises to “combine new and old and thrust the ‘Wick’ universe into a new age.”\n\nRelated Article: Bill Skarsgård Talks 'John Wick: Chapter 4' and Working with Keanu Reeves\n\nWho else is working on ‘John Wick: The High Table’?\n\nWhile Reeves right now is only attached to produce, with no plans to appear (after all, his character dies… probably in ‘Chapter Four’), Stahelski is on board to direct the first episode.\n\nAnd the filmmaker’s involvement will be part of his big overall deal with Lionsgate, sealed in January, to oversee all aspects of the expanding Wick storytelling scene. He’ll produce via his 87Eleven Entertainment company.\n\nOn the creative front for the new show, Robert Levine, one of the co-creators of FX series ‘The Old Man’ (which certainly shared themes with ‘Wick’, is writing and running it.\n\nWhat else is going on with the ‘John Wick’ movie universe?\n\nThe new show is just the latest way that Lionsgate is looking to utilize the sprawling ‘Wick’-verse, and the next version to actually appear will be ‘Ballerina’, due on June 6th next, year. The movie, set between the events of the third and fourth movie, stars Ana de Armas as a young assassin out for revenge and has Len Wiseman directing.\n\nThere is also a movie spin-off focused on Donnie Yen’s character from ‘John Wick: Chapter 4’ in the works.\n\nWhen will the new ‘John Wick’ show be on screens?\n\nThough Lionsgate is producing the show, it is currently being shopped to networks. Peacock, of course, picked up the previous spin-off, prequel series ‘The Continental’, but the new show is up for grabs. So expect plenty of interest from the likes of Netflix and more.\n\nOther Movies and TV Shows in the 'John Wick' Franchise:\n\n‘John Wick' (2014)\n\n‘John Wick: Chapter 2' (2017)\n\n‘John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum' (2019)\n\n'John Wick: Chapter 4' (2023)\n\n'The Continental: From the World of John Wick' (2023)\n\n'John Wick Presents: Ballerina' (2025)"
