I'll be a poet, a writer, a dramatist. Somehow or other I'll be famous, and if not famous, I'll be notorious. Or perhaps I'll lead the life of pleasure for a time and then—who knows?—rest and do nothing. What does Plato say is the highest end that man can attain here below? To sit down and contemplate the good. Perhaps that will be the end of me too.\n\nAs quoted in In Victorian Days and Other Papers (1939) by Sir David Oswald Hunter-Blair, p. 122\n\nAnd he related also, with much gusto, how in a country-house he had told his host one evening that he had spent the day in hard literary work, and that, when asked what he had done, he had said, \"I was working on the proof of one of my poems all the morning and took out a comma.\" \"And in the afternoon?\" \"In the afternoon–well, I put it back again.\"\n\nQuoted in \"Oscar Wilde: The Story of an Unhappy Friendship\" (1905) by Robert Harborough Sherard,.

He used poetry as a medium for writing in prose.\n\nAnybody can make history. Only a great man can write it.\n\nThere is no mode of action, no form of emotion, that we do not share with the lower animals. It is only by language that we rise above them, or above each other—by language, which is the parent, and not the child, of thought.\n\nEvery great man nowadays has his disciples, and it is always Judas who writes the biography.\n\nTruth, in the matters of religion, is simply the opinion that has survived.\n\nOh! journalism is unreadable, and literature is not read.\n\nPuritans cannot destroy a beautiful thing, yet, by means of their extraordinary prurience, they can almost taint beauty for a moment. It is chiefly, I regret to say, through journalism that such people find expression. I regret it because there is much to be said in favour of modern journalism. By giving us the opinions of the uneducated, it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community.\n\nI am but too conscious of the fact that we are born in an age when only the dull are treated seriously, and I live in terror of not being misunderstood.\n\nThe one duty we owe to history is to rewrite it.\n\nIt is well for his peace that the saint goes to his martyrdom. He is spared the sight of the horror of his harvest.\n\nAction ... is the last resource of those who know not how to dream.\n\nThere is much to be said in favor of modern journalism. By giving us the opinions of the uneducated, it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community. By carefully chronicling the current events of contemporary life, it shows us of what very little importance such events really are. By invariably discussing the unnecessary, it makes us understand what things are requisite for culture, and what are not.\n\nAs for modern Journalism, its not my business to defend it. It justifies its own existence by the great Darwinian principle of the survival of the vulgarest.\n\nIt is through art, and through art only, that we can realize our perfection; through art and art only that we can shield ourselves from the sordid perils of actual existence.\n\nMan is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.\n\nA little sincerity is a dangerous thing, and a great deal of it is absolutely fatal.\n\nIt is to do nothing that the elect exist. Action is limited and relative. Unlimited and absolute is the vision of him who sits at ease and watches, who walks in loneliness and dreams.\n\nAs long as war is regarded as wicked, it will always have its fascination. When it is looked upon as vulgar, it will cease to be popular.\n\nIt is chiefly, I regret to say, through journalism that such people find expression. I regret it because there is much to be said in favour of modern journalism. By giving us the opinions of the uneducated, it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community. By carefully chronicling the current events of contemporary life, it shows us of what very little importance such events really are. By invariably discussing the unnecessary, it makes us understand what things are requisite for culture, and what are not.\n\nTo be good, according to the vulgar standard of goodness, is obviously quite easy. It merely requires a certain amount of sordid terror, a certain lack of imaginative thought, and a certain low passion for middle-class respectability.\n\nThere is no sin except stupidity.\n\nAh! Don't say you agree with me. When people agree with me I always feel I must be wrong.\n\nThis also appears in Lady Windermere's Fan (1892), Act II\n\nEngland has done one thing; it has invented and established Public Opinion, which is an attempt to organize the ignorance of the community, and to elevate it to the dignity of physical force.\n\nA dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight, and his punishment is that he sees the dawn before the rest of the world.\n\nOne is tempted to define man as a rational animal who always loses his temper when he is called upon to act in accordance with the dictates of reason.\n\nonline text\n\nThe chief advantage that would result from the establishment of Socialism is, undoubtedly, the fact that Socialism would relieve us from that sordid necessity of living for others which, in the present condition of things, presses so hardly upon almost everybody. In fact, scarcely any one at all escapes.\n\nJust as the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it, and understood by those who contemplated it, so, in the present state of things in England, the people who do most harm are the people who try to do most good.\n\nCharity creates a multitude of sins.\n\nIt is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property.\n\nDisobedience, in the eyes of any one who has read history, is man's original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has been made, through disobedience and through rebellion.\n\nSometimes the poor are praised for being thrifty. But to recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting. It is like advising a man who is starving to eat less.\n\nAs for begging, it is safer to beg than to take, but it is finer to take than to beg.\n\nMisery and poverty are so absolutely degrading, and exercise such a paralysing effect over the nature of men, that no class is ever really conscious of its own suffering. They have to be told of it by other people, and they often entirely disbelieve them.\n\nAgitators are a set of interfering, meddling people, who come down to some perfectly contented class of the community, and sow the seeds of discontent amongst them. That is the reason why agitators are so absolutely necessary. Without them, in our incomplete state, there would be no advance towards civilisation.\n\nFor the recognition of private property has really harmed Individualism, and obscured it, by confusing a man with what he possesses. It has led Individualism entirely astray. It has made gain not growth its aim. So that man thought that the important thing was to have, and did not know that the important thing is to be. The true perfection of man lies, not in what man has, but in what man is. Private property has crushed true Individualism, and set up an Individualism that is false. It has debarred one part of the community from being individual by starving them. It has debarred the other part of the community from being individual by putting them on the wrong road and encumbering them.\n\nNow, nothing should be able to harm a man except himself. Nothing should be able to rob a man at all. What a man really has, is what is in him. What is outside of him should be a matter of no importance.\n\nWith the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true, beautiful, healthy Individualism. Nobody will waste his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for things. One will live. To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.\n\nWherever there is a man who exercises authority, there is a man who resists authority.\n\nThe note of the perfect personality is not rebellion, but peace.\n\nIt will be a marvellous thing--the true personality of man--when we see it. It will grow naturally and simply, flowerlike, or as a tree grows. It will not be at discord. It will never argue or dispute. It will not prove things. It will know everything. And yet it will not busy itself about knowledge. It will have wisdom. Its value will not be measured by material things. It will have nothing. And yet it will have everything, and whatever one takes from it, it will still have, so rich will it be. It will not be always meddling with others, or asking them to be like itself. It will love them because they will be different. And yet while it will not meddle with others, it will help all, as a beautiful thing helps us, by being what it is. The personality of man will be very wonderful. It will be as wonderful as the personality of a child.\n\n'Know thyself' was written over the portal of the antique world. Over the portal of the new world, 'Be thyself' shall be written.\n\nDon't imagine that your perfection lies in accumulating or possessing external things. Your perfection is inside of you. If only you could realise that, you would not want to be rich. Ordinary riches can be stolen from a man. Real riches cannot. In the treasury-house of your soul, there are infinitely precious things, that may not be taken from you. And so, try to so shape your life that external things will not harm you. And try also to get rid of personal property. It involves sordid preoccupation, endless industry, continual wrong. Personal property hinders Individualism at every step.\n\nThere is only one class in the community that thinks more about money than the rich, and that is the poor.\n\nThe things people say of a man do not alter a man. He is what he is. Public opinion is of no value whatsoever.\n\nAll modes of government are failures. Despotism is unjust to everybody, including the despot, who was probably made for better things. Oligarchies are unjust to the many, and ochlocracies are unjust to the few. High hopes were once formed of democracy; but democracy means simply the bludgeoning of the people by the people for the people.\n\nAll authority is quite degrading. It degrades those who exercise it, and degrades those over whom it is exercised.\n\nWhen private property is abolished there will be no necessity for crime, no demand for it; it will cease to exist.\n\nThe fact is, that civilisation requires slaves. The Greeks were quite right there. Unless there are slaves to do the ugly, horrible, uninteresting work, culture and contemplation become almost impossible. Human slavery is wrong, insecure, and demoralizing. On mechanical slavery, on the slavery of the machine, the future of the world depends.\n\nA map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which Humanity is always landing.\n\nA work of art is the unique result of a unique temperament. Its beauty comes from the fact that the author is what he is. It has nothing to do with the fact that other people want what they want. Indeed, the moment that an artist takes notice of what other people want, and tries to supply the demand, he ceases to be an artist, and becomes a dull or an amusing craftsman, an honest or a dishonest tradesman. He has no further claim to be considered as an artist.\n\nArt is the most intense mode of individualism that the world has known. I am inclined to say that it is the only real mode of individualism that the world has known. Crime, which, under certain conditions, may seem to have created individualism, must take cognisance of other people and interfere with them. It belongs to the sphere of action. But alone, without any reference to his neighbours, without any interference, the artist can fashion a beautiful thing; and if he does not do it solely for his own pleasure, he is not an artist at all.\n\nArt is this intense form of individualism that makes the public try to exercise over it an authority that is as immoral as it is ridiculous, and as corrupting as it is contemptible. It is not quite their fault. The public have always, and in every age, been badly brought up. They are continually asking Art to be popular, to please their want of taste, to flatter their absurd vanity, to tell them what they have been told before, to show them what they ought to be tired of seeing, to amuse them when they feel heavy after eating too much, and to distract their thoughts when they are wearied of their own stupidity. Now Art should never try to be popular. The public should try to make itself artistic.\n\nArt is Individualism, and Individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. Therein lies its immense value. For what it seeks to disturb is monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine.\n\nAn individual who has to make things for the use of others, and with reference to their wants and their wishes, does not work with interest, and consequently cannot put into his work what is best in him. Upon the other hand, whenever a community or a powerful section of a community, or a government of any kind, attempts to dictate to the artist what he is to do, Art either entirely vanishes, or becomes stereotyped, or degenerates into a low and ignoble form of craft.\n\nThey are always asking a writer why he does not write like somebody else, or a painter why he does not paint like somebody else, quite oblivious of the fact that if either of them did anything of the kind he would cease to be an artist.\n\nIf a man approaches a work of art with any desire to exercise authority over it and the artist, he approaches it in such a spirit that he cannot receive any artistic impression from it at all. The work of art is to dominate the spectator: the spectator is not to dominate the work of art. The spectator is to be receptive. He is to be the violin on which the master is to play. And the more completely he can suppress his own silly views, his own foolish prejudices, his own absurd ideas of what Art should be, or should not be, the more likely he is to understand and appreciate the work of art in question.\n\nThe one thing that the public dislike is novelty. Any attempt to extend the subject matter of art is extremely distasteful to the public; and yet the vitality and progress of art depend in a large measure on the continual extension of subject-matter. The public dislike novelty because they are afraid of it. It represents to them a mode of Individualism, an assertion on the part of the artist that he selects his own subject, and treats it as he chooses.\n\nIn Art, the public accept what has been, because they cannot alter it, not because they appreciate it. They swallow their classics whole, and never taste them. They endure them as the inevitable, and, as they cannot mar them, they mouth about them...A fresh mode of Beauty is absolutely distasteful to them, and whenever it appears they get so angry and bewildered that they always use two stupid expressions - one is that the work of art is grossly unintelligible; the other, that the work of art is grossly immoral.\n\nAnd it is only fair to state, with regard to modern journalists, that they always apologise to one in private for what they have written against one in public.\n\nIn old days men had the rack. Now they have the press.\n\nIn America the President reigns for four years, and Journalism governs for ever and ever.\n\nPeople sometimes inquire what form of government is most suitable for an artist to live under. To this question there is only one answer. The form of government that is most suitable to the artist is no government at all. Authority over him and his art is ridiculous.\n\nThere are as many perfections as there are imperfect men. And while to the claims of charity a man may yield and yet be free, to the claims of conformity no man may yield and remain free at all.\n\nThere are three kinds of despots. There is the despot who tyrannises over the body. There is the despot who tyrannises over the soul. There is the despot who tyrannises over the soul and body alike. The first is called the Prince. The second is called the Pope. The third is called the People.\n\nThe only thing that one really knows about human nature is that it changes. Change is the one quality we can predicate of it. The systems that fail are those that rely on the permanency of human nature, and not on its growth and development. The error of Louis XIV was that he thought human nature would always be the same. The result of his error was the French Revolution. It was an admirable result. All the results of the mistakes of governments are quite admirable.\n\nSelfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live.\n\nA man who does not think for himself does not think at all.\n\nFor what man has sought for is, indeed, neither pain nor pleasure, but simply Life. Man has sought to live intensely, fully, perfectly. When he can do so without exercising restraint on others, or suffering it ever, and his activities are all pleasurable to him, he will be saner, healthier, more civilised, more himself. Pleasure is Nature's test, her sign of approval. When man is happy, he is in harmony with himself and his environment.\n\nIt was a fatal day when the public discovered that the pen is mightier than the paving-stone, and can be made as offensive as the brickbat. They at once sought for the journalist, found him, developed him, and made him their industrious and well-paid servant. It is greatly to be regretted, for both their sakes. Behind the barricade there may be much that is noble and heroic. But what is there behind the leading-article but prejudice, stupidity, cant, and twaddle? And when these four are joined together they make a terrible force, and constitute the new authority. [1]\n\nIn the old days men had the rack. Now they have the Press. That is an Improvement certainly. but still it is very bad, and wrong, and demoralising. Somebody - was it Burke? - called journalism the fourth estate. That was true at the time, no doubt. But at the present moment it really is the only estate. It has eaten up the other three. The Lords Temporal say nothing, The Lords Spiritual have nothing to say and the House of Commons has nothing to say and says it. We are dominated by journalism. [2]\n\nIn America, the President reigns for four years, and journalism governs for ever and ever. Fortunately, in America journalism has carried its authority to the grossest and most brutal extreme. As a natural consequence it has begun to create a spirit of revolt, people are amused by it, or disgusted by it, according to their temperaments. but it is no longer the real force it was. It is not seriously treated. In England, journalism, except in a few well-known instances, not having been carried to such excesses of brutality, is still a great factor, a remarkable power. The tyranny that it proposes to exercise over people's private lives seems to me to be quite extraordinary. [3]\n\nHere we allow absolute freedom to the journalist and entirely limit the artist. English public opinion, that is to say, tries to constrain and impede and warp the man who makes things that are beautiful in effect, and compels the journalist to retail things that are ugly, or disgusting, or revolting in fact, so that we have the most serious journalists in the world and the most indecent newspapers. [4]\n\nThe fact is, that the public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything, except what is worth knowing. Journalism, conscious of this, and having tradesmanlike habits, supplies their demands [5]\n\nIt is absurd to divide people into good and bad. People are either charming or tedious.\n\nLord Darlington, Act I\n\nNowadays we are all of us so hard up that the only pleasant things to pay are compliments.

There is passion, enmity, worship, love, but no friendship.\n\nLord Darlington, Act II\n\nMy own business always bores me to death. I prefer other people's.\n\nCecil Graham, Act III\n\nGossip is charming! History is merely gossip. But scandal is gossip made tedious by morality.\n\nCecil Graham, Act III\n\nWe are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.\n\nLord Darlington, Act III\n\nIn this world there are only two tragedies. One is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it.\n\nMr. Dumby, Act III\n\nA man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.

We in the House of Lords are never in touch with public opinion. That makes us a civilised body.\n\nAct I\n\nLord Illingworth: The Book of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden.\n\nMrs. Allonby: It ends with Revelations.\n\nAct I\n\nLady Hunstanton: But do you believe all that is written in the newspapers?\n\nLord Illingworth: I do. Nowadays it is only the unreadable that occurs.\n\nAct I\n\nLord Illingworth: Women have become too brilliant. Nothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humour in the woman.\n\nMrs. Allonby: Or the want of it in the man.\n\nAct I\n\nLord Illingworth: Discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation.\n\nAct II\n\nGerald: I suppose society is wonderfully delightful?\n\nLord Illingworth: To be in it is merely a bore. But to be out of it simply a tragedy.\n\nAct III\n\nMen marry because they are tired; women because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\n\nLord Illingworth, Act III\n\nI am always astonishing myself. It is the only thing that makes life worth living.\n\nLord Illingworth, Act III\n\nModeration is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton. Nothing succeeds like excess.\n\nLord Illingworth, Act III\n\nThe only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past and every sinner has a future.\n\nLord Illingworth, Act III\n\nChildren begin by loving their parents.

It is very romantic to be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal. Why, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the excitement is all over. The very essence of romance is uncertainty.\n\nAlgernon, Act I\n\nDivorces are made in Heaven.\n\nAlgernon, Act I\n\nThe number of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous.

It is simply washing one's clean linen in public.\n\nAlgernon, Act I\n\nI hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief\n\nAlgernon, Act I\n\nI do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.\n\nLady Bracknell, Act I\n\nMy dear fellow, the truth isn't quite the sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl.\n\nJack, Act I\n\nThe only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her if she is pretty and to someone else if she is plain.\n\nAlgernon, Act I\n\nAh! That must be Aunt Augusta. Only relatives, or creditors, ever ring in that Wagnerian manner.\n\nAlgernon, Act I\n\nTo lose one parent may be regarded as a misfortune ... to lose both seems like carelessness.\n\nLady Bracknell, Act I\n\nAn engagement should come on a young girl as a surprise, pleasant or unpleasant as the case may be.\n\nLady Bracknell, Act I\n\nAll women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That's his.\n\nAlgernon, Act I\n\nJack: That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple.\n\nAlgernon: The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!\n\nAct I\n\nOften quoted as \"The pure and simple truth is rarely pure and never simple.\"\n\nI have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose.\n\nAlgernon, Act I\n\nIn married life, three is company, and two is none.\n\nAlgernon, Act I\n\nOf course the music is a great difficulty. You see, if one plays good music, people don't listen, and if one plays bad music people don't talk.\n\nAlgernon, Act I\n\nIt is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should read and what one shouldn't. More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn't read.\n\nAlgernon, Act I\n\nI have always been of opinion that a man who desires to get married should know either everything or nothing.\n\nLady Bracknell, Act I\n\nRelations are simply a tedious pack of people, who haven't got the remotest knowledge of how to live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die.\n\nAlgernon, Act I\n\nMothers, of course, are all right.

One should always have something sensational to read in the train.\n\nGwendolen, Act II\n\nThe home seems to me to be the proper sphere for the man. And certainly once a man begins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate, does he not?\n\nGwendolen, Act II\n\nI hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would be hypocrisy.\n\nCecily, Act II\n\nThe good ended happily, and the bad unhappily.

The butter would probably get on my cuffs. One must eat muffins quite calmly, it is the only way to eat them.\n\nAlgernon, Act II\n\nNever speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon. Only people who can't get into it do that.\n\nLady Bracknell, Act III\n\nTo speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.\n\nLady Bracknell, Act III\n\nThirty-five is a very attractive age. London society is full of women of the very highest birth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-five for years.\n\nLady Bracknell, Act III\n\nI've now realized for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.\n\nJack, Act III\n\nIf you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life.\n\nGwendolen, Act III\n\nThis suspense is terrible.

It is the only thing I know anything about.\n\nLord Goring, Act I\n\nWomen have a wonderful instinct about things. They can discover everything except the obvious.\n\nLord Goring, Act II\n\nLife is never fair, Robert. And perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that is is not.\n\nLord Goring, Act II\n\nMusical people are so absurdly unreasonable. They always want one to be perfectly dumb a the very moment when one is longing to be absolutely deaf.\n\nMabel Chiltern, Act II\n\nAll sins, except a sin against itself, Love should forgive. All lives, save loveless lives, true Love should pardon.\n\nSir Robert Chiltern, Act II\n\nFashion is what one wears oneself. What is unfashionable is what other people wear.\n\nLord Goring, Act III\n\nThe only possible society is oneself.\n\nLord Goring, Act III\n\nTo love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance.\n\nLord Goring, Act III\n\nHowever, it is always nice to be expected, and not to arrive.\n\nLord Goring, Act III\n\nOh, why will parents always appear at the wrong time? Some extraordinary mistake in nature, I suppose.\n\nLord Goring, Act III\n\nLord Caversham: No woman, plain or pretty, has any common sense at all, sir. Common sense is the privilege of our sex.\n\nLord Goring: Quite so. And we men are so self-sacrificing that we never use it, do we, father?\n\nAct III\n\nDo you really think, Arthur, that it is weakness that yields to temptation? I tell you that there are terrible temptations that it requires strength, strength and courage, to yield to.\n\nSir Robert Chiltern, Act III\n\nWomen are never disarmed by compliments. Men always are.\n\nMrs. Cheveley, Act III\n\nLord Goring: Now I'm gonna give you some good advice.\n\nMrs. Cheveley: Pray don't. You should never give a woman something she can't wear in the evening\n\nAct III\n\nFathers should be neither seen nor heard. That is the only proper basis for family life. Mothers are different. Mothers are darlings.\n\nLord Goring, Act IV\n\nWhen one pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people's time, not one's own.\n\nLord Goring, Act IV\n\nIf we men married the women we deserved, we should have a very bad time of it.\n\nLord Goring, Act IV\n\nI don't at all like knowing what people say of me behind my back. It makes me far too conceited.\n\nLord Goring, Act IV\n\nNow don't stir. I'll be back in five minutes. And don't fall into any temptations while I am away.\n\nMiss Mabel Chiltern to Lord Goring, just after accepting his proposal, Act IV\n\nI have said to you to speak the truth is a painful thing.

V, st. 30\n\nAlphabetized by author\n\nThe English writers who had a big influence on me during my adolescence were Sir Walter Scott, Jane Austen, the Brontë sisters, Charles Dickens, Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, James Joyce, D.H. Lawrence, and Virginia Woolf.\n\nIsabel Allende Interview\n\nFrom the beginning Wilde performed his life and continued to do so even after fate had taken the plot out of his hands.\n\nW. H. Auden, \"An Improbable Life,\" review of The Letters of Oscar Wilde (editor, Rupert Hart-Davis) in The New Yorker, (9 March 1963)\n\nDespite the number of his books and plays, Mr. Wilde was not, I think, what one calls a born writer. His writing seemed always to be rather an overflow of intellectual temperamental energy than an inevitable, absorbing function. That he never concentrated himself on any one form of literature is a proof that the art of writing never really took hold of him.\n\nMax Beerbohm, quoted in Saturday Review (8 December 1900)\n\nAn Assyrian wax statue, effeminate, but with the vitality of twenty men.\n\nMax Beerbohm, quoted in Cecil Beaton's diary (September 1953)\n\nThat sovereign of insufferables, Oscar Wilde has ensued with his opulence of twaddle and his penury of sense. He has mounted his hind legs and blown crass vapidities through the bowel of his neck, to the capital edification of circumjacent fools and foolesses, fooling with their foolers. He has tossed off the top of his head and uttered himself in copious overflows of ghastly bosh. The ineffable dunce has nothing to say and says it—says it with a liberal embellishment of bad delivery, embroidering it with reasonless vulgarities of attitude, gesture and attire. There never was an impostor so hateful, a blockhead so stupid, a crank so variously and offensively daft. Therefore is the she fool enamored of the feel of his tongue in her ear to tickle her understanding.\n\nThe limpid and spiritless vacuity of this intellectual jellyfish is in ludicrous contrast with the rude but robust mental activities that he came to quicken and inspire. Not only has he no thoughts, but no thinker. His lecture is mere verbal ditch-water—meaningless, trite and without coherence. It lacks even the nastiness that exalts and refines his verse. Moreover, it is obviously his own; he had not even the energy and independence to steal it. And so, with a knowledge that would equip and idiot to dispute with a cast-iron dog, and eloquence to qualify him for the duties of a caller on a hog-ranch, and an imagination adequate to the conception of a tom-cat, when fired by contemplation of a fiddle-string, this consummate and star-like youth, missing everywhere his heaven-appointed functions and offices, wanders about, posing as a statue of himself, and, like the sun-smitten image of Memnon, emitting meaningless murmurs in the blaze of women's eyes.\n\nHe makes me tired. And this gawky gowk has the divine effrontery to link his name with those of Swinburne, Rossetti and Morris—this dunghill he-hen would fly with eagles. He dares to set his tongue to the honored name of Keats. He is the leader, quoth'a, of a renaissance in art, this man who cannot draw—of a revival of letters, this man who cannot write! This little and looniest of a brotherhood of simpletons, whom the wicked wits of London, haling him dazed from his obscurity, have crowned and crucified as King of the Cranks, has accepted the distinction in stupid good faith and our foolish people take him at his word. Mr. Wilde is pinnacled upon a dazzling eminence but the earth still trembles to the dull thunder of the kicks that set him up.\n\nAmbrose Bierce in an unsigned comment from a column titled Prattle in the satirical magazine Wasp, San Francisco (31 March 1882)\n\nLeyendo y releyendo, a lo largo de los años, a Wilde, noto un hecho que sus panegiristas no parecen haber sospechado siquiera: el hecho comprobable y elemental de que Wilde, casi siempre, tiene razón.\n\nReading and re-reading Wilde throughout the years, I notice a fact that people who praise him apparently haven't in the very least: the basic and verifiable fact that Wilde is almost always right.\n\nJorge Luis Borges, Obras completas, Vol. II, p. 70\n\nComo Chesterton, como Lang, como Boswell, Wilde es de aquellos venturosos que pueden prescindir de la aprobación de la crítica y aun, a veces, de la aprobación del lector, pues el agrado que nos proporciona su trato es irresistible y constante.\n\nLike Chesterton, like Lang, like Boswell, Wilde is one of the happy few who do not need the approval of the critic, nor even, sometimes, the approval of the reader, for the pleasure they give us is constant and irresistible.\n\nJorge Luis Borges, Obras completas, Vol. II, p. 71\n\nWe see these insane practices reflected in the buy-outs and takeovers on Wall Street. It's the same thing: exchanging long-term security for short-term gain. You sacrifice a company for the immediate rewards. But you destroy what produces jobs and livelihoods and economic health. If you eat the seed corn, you won't have a crop to plant. Oscar Wilde once said, \"A cynic is someone who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.\" We look at the price, but we don't look at the value. Economics and profit drive everything. People forget that the soil is our sustenance. It is a sacred trust. It is what has worked for us for centuries, It is what we pass on to future generations.\n\nCesar Chavez 1989 article, anthologized in An Organizer’s Tale (2008)\n\nThe same lesson [of the pessimistic pleasure-seeker] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde. It is the carpe diem religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw.\n\nG.K. Chesterton, Heretics (1905)\n\nOscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets. We can pay for them by not being Oscar Wilde.\n\nG. K. Chesterton, Orthodoxy (1908)\n\nHe was a great artist. He also was really a charlatan. I mean by a charlatan one sufficiently dignified to despise the tricks that he employs. ... Wilde and his school professed to stand as solitary artistic souls apart from the public. They professed to scorn the middle class, and declared that the artist must not work for the bourgeois. The truth is that no artist so really great ever worked so much for the bourgeois as Oscar Wilde. No man, so capable of thinking about truth and beauty, ever thought so constantly about his own effect on the middle classes. ... One might go through his swift and sparkling plays with a red and blue pencil marking two kinds of epigrams; the real epigram which he wrote to please his own wild intellect, and the sham epigram which he wrote to thrill the very tamest part of our tame civilization.\n\nG. K. Chesterton, Daily News (19 October 1909)\n\nWilde himself wrote some things that were not immorality, but merely bad taste; not the bad taste of the conservative suburbs, which merely means anything violent or shocking, but real bad taste; as in a stern subject treated in a florid style; an over-dressed woman at a supper of old friends; or a bad joke that nobody had time to laugh at. This mixture of sensibility and coarseness in the man was very curious; and I for one cannot endure (for example) his sensual way of speaking of dead substances, satin or marble or velvet, as if he were stroking a lot of dogs and cats.\n\nG. K. Chesterton, The Victorian Age in Literature (1913)\n\nAm reading more of Oscar Wilde. What a tiresome, affected sod.\n\nNoël Coward, entry for 14 July 1946, in The Noel Coward Diaries, ed. Sheridan Morley and Graham Payn (1982)\n\nWilde's voice was of the brown velvet order — mellifluous — rounded — in a sense giving it a plummy quality — rather on the adenotic side — but practically pure cello — and very pleasing.\n\nFranklin Dyall, quoted in Life of Oscar Wilde by Hesketh Pearson\n\nOscar Wilde did not dive very deeply below the surface of human nature, but found, to a certain extent rightly, that there is more on the surface of life than is seen by the eyes of most people.\n\nJ. T. Grein, quoted in Sunday Special (9 December 1900)\n\nHe had first to free English speech from its weight of serious meaning. He had to win for prose, for measured sentence and paragraph, the license that his contemporaries would concede only to verse: the freedom to delight instantly, in virtue of form alone, and the right to forestall reflection by an explosion of felicity in phrasing. He used the epigram, as a literary form, very much as a ballet-master uses exercises at the bar.\n\nStuart Hampshire \"Adventurer\", The New York Review of Books (21 August 1969)\n\nNo, I've never cared for his work. Too scented.\n\nRudyard Kipling, quoted by Harry Ricketts in The Unforgiving Minute, (1999).\n\nNot the least of the twentieth-century phenomena that Wilde so uncannily anticipated was the cult of celebrity; and indeed, soon after deciding against a career as a classicist, he was making his first serious effort at courting international fame. During his 1882 tour of America, he was already showing a shrewd understanding of the uses to which that most Greek of literary forms, the epigram, might be put in the age of the telegram and the newspaper.\n\nDaniel Mendelsohn, Oscar Wilde, Classics Scholar, (The New York Review of Books, 11 November 2010)\n\nromantic, socialist author.\n\nChina Mieville 50 Sci-Fi & Fantasy Works Every Socialist Should Read\n\nThe reason Wilde did his best work after turning homosexual is that women simply reinforced his own feminine sentimentality. ... Heterosexuality inhibited his imagination because woman is physically and psychologically internal.\n\nCamille Paglia, Sexual Personae, (Vintage, 1990) p. 571\n\nWhen in doubt, I read Oscar Wilde.\n\nCamille Paglia, Sex, Art and American Culture: New Essays (Vintage, 1992) p. xi\n\nIf, with the literate, I am\n\nImpelled to try an epigram,\n\nI never seek to take the credit;\n\nWe all assume that Oscar said it.\n\nDorothy Parker in A Pig's-Eye View of Literature (1937)\n\nMen lived more vividly in his presence, and talked better than themselves.\n\nArthur Ransome, in Oscar Wilde, A Critical Study\n\nHe was never quite sure himself where and when he was serious.\n\nRobert Ross, letter to Adela Schuster (23 December 1900)\n\nHe (Jack London) wrote an essay called \"What Life Means to Me\" which takes its place with Kropotkin's \"Appeal to the Young\" and Oscar Wilde's \"The Soul of Man Under Socialism,\" and its closing sentence rings with his faith in the rise of the common man. \"The stairway of time is ever echoing with the wooden shoe going up, the polished boot descending.\"\n\nAnna Strunsky, \"Memoirs of Jack London\" in The Masses (July 1917)\n\nWhat has Oscar in common with Art? except that he dines at our tables and picks from our platter the plums for the puddings he peddles in the provinces. Oscar -- the amiable, irresponsible, esurient Oscar -- with no more sense of a picture than of the fit of a coat, has the courage of the opinions -- of others!\n\nJames McNeill Whistler in The World, 17 November 1886, in The Gentle Art of Making Enemies (1890)\n\n\"I wish I'd said that\"\n\n(by Wilde, to a witty remark by James McNeill Whistler), to which Whistler riposted:\n\n\"You will, Oscar.\"\n\nJames McNeill Whistler\n\nQuoted in James McNeil Whistler by Lisa N.
