        "text": "Scammers use romance, dating or friendship to get your trust and your money.\n\nNever trust that someone you only know online is who they say they are. Scammers work hard to trick you into thinking the relationship is real, then manipulate you to get your money. They can spend years building your trust.\n\nScammers use social media, dating or gaming apps and websites to find people looking for love and friendship. They create fake profiles, sometimes of famous people. They might also call or message a lot to make you feel special. This is sometimes called 'love bombing'.\n\nOnce you trust them, they might tell you about an urgent problem they need your money for. They might ask you to set up accounts or transfer money they give you. Or they might convince you to use cryptocurrency and invest in a fake scheme they say is real. Either way, the scammer steals your money and disappears, and you don't get it back.\n\nOn this page\n\nSigns it might be a scam\n\nThe relationship moves fast and they soon say they have strong feelings for you. They 'lovebomb' you, messaging or calling a lot and make you feel very special.\n\nThe scammer quickly tries to move your chat from a social media platform or online dating to a free messaging platform like GoogleHangouts, WeChat, Line or WhatsApp.\n\nOnce there's an emotional connection, the scammer encourages you to make money through different investments, often cryptocurrency. They may offer to spend time 'showing you' how to make 'easy money'.\n\nThey may tell you they have an emergency and urgently need your money, or ask you to set up accounts or transfer money they give you.\n\nThey want you to only trust them and keep things secret. They may try to cut you off from family and friends.\n\nThere always seems to be some reason they can’t meet in person or video chat. Often they say they're overseas, somewhere remote or their technology isn’t working.\n\nOther 'red flags' or signs to look for\n\nTheir online profile doesn’t match what they tell you about themselves.\n\nThey ask you for personal photos, videos or information that could be used against you in the future.\n\nThe scammer threatens you or gets angry if you ask questions or don’t do what they ask. They may say they'll end the relationship.\n\nProtect yourself\n\nLots of people look for friends and even find love online.\n\nJust remember that scams are very common.\n\nKeep yourself safe by staying updated on scams, and how to spot people who want your money or identity, not your love.\n\nNever send money to someone you haven't met\n\nIf they ask you for money, they're probably a scammer. Stop contact straight away and get support.\n\nNever send money, card or bank details, personal information or identity documents to someone you only know online, no matter how long you’ve been messaging.\n\nNever agree to transfer money for someone else. They may be involving you in a crime called money laundering, and you could be charged with a criminal offence.\n\nCheck who's really there\n\nTake things slowly when you meet new people online. Ask lots of questions and watch for things that don’t add up.\n\nSearch for the scammer’s name along with the word ‘scam’ in a search, and look for websites about romance scams in the results.\n\nIf you have a picture of them, do a reverse image search to find out if the same picture is online in different places, with different names or personal details.\n\nFind out more about different types of investment scams so you can spot red flags, or signs that something is a scam.\n\nBe careful of what you share (and what you don't)\n\nNever send nudes or sexually intimate photos or videos to people you don’t know. Scammers can use them to threaten and blackmail you.\n\nDon’t keep an online relationship secret. Tell people you trust about it. It can be easier for someone else to spot things that don't seem right.\n\nThink carefully about sharing information about your hobbies, job or family online. Scammers can use this to hurt you, or steal your identity.\n\nFind out how to stay safe on different social media platforms.\n\nFind out what to do if someone is using your personal information to scam others.\n\nHow to spot a fake profile\n\nThey usually have:\n\nphotos that look too professional\n\nphotos that are blurry or unclear\n\nvery little personal information\n\nfew or no connections to social media accounts\n\nfew comments, likes or shares on their social media from other people.\n\nIf you’ve been affected\n\nReal life stories\n\nIf you’ve only ever met online, you need to take extra precautions to protect yourself. Don’t let scammers take advantage of your better nature and steal your money."
