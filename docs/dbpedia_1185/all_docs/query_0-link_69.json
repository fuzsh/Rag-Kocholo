        "text": "Kelis and Bill Murray have reportedly decided to go their separate ways after just two months of dating.\n\nThe “Milkshake” singer, 44, was allegedly the one to call things off with the “Ghostbusters” star, 72, according to the US Sun.\n\n“Kelis and Bill were — and still are — very fond of each other but things just ran their course,” an insider told the outlet.\n\n“They both have busy schedules and after a whirlwind romance decided to go their separate ways. They hope to remain friends but also plan to get on with their lives”\n\nReps for Murray and Kelis did not immediately respond to Page Six’s requests for comment.\n\nBoth Kelis and the “Saturday Night Live” alum, who shares six sons with his ex-wives, kept mum about their romance for the duration of their relationship — until now.\n\nJust one day before the Sun broke the news of their split, the singer confirmed they were not an item.\n\nWhen asked by an Instagram user if she was “really dating Bill Murray,” Kelis quipped back, “ugh , no !”\n\nHowever, the singer sang a different tune when asked by fans to address the dating rumors in the months prior.\n\n“Ma’am would you care to address these Bill Murray allegations?!? Cuz damn! What he doing with all that?!?” a fan commented under one of Kelis’ bikini pictures in June.\n\n“lol no babe, I wouldn’t bother at all,” the mother of three replied, neither confirming or denying the report.\n\nThe musician-turned-farmer added in another reply that she and Murray are “both blessed, rich and happy.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThe twosome were first linked in early June after Murray was spotted supporting the “Bossy” singer at one of her shows in London.\n\nAt the time, sources close to the pair told the US Sun that they were staying together in a hotel and had been “getting close for a while” after first “hitting it off” in the US.\n\nThe pair also seemingly bonded over their grief. Kelis lost her second husband, Mike Mora, in March 2022 while Murray lost his older brother, Ed, and his estranged wife, Jennifer Butler, within the last few years.\n\n“They’ve also both shared relatively recent bereavements and have that common bond between them,” the insider shared at the time.\n\n“Whatever it is that has brought them together, and however unlikely it seems, they are both single and are having fun despite the fairly big age gap.”"
