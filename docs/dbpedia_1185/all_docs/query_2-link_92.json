        "text": "Bill Belichick currently has a relationship with 23-year-old Jordon Hudson, he is 72-years-old and has a 49-year gap with her. Needless to say, there are so many aspects of this relationship that have been criticized by the majority of people. A relationship with such a massive age gap is strange for the conventional point of view. But Jordon Hudson is sticking to her guns and she is defending her relationship with all her being. There is nothing anybody can do to stop her from dating the former New England Patriots coach. She is a consenting adult and she will do anything to stand by her desires. Just last week, the couple was spotted going out at night by paparazzi and they really don't seem to care about that age gap.\n\nJordon Hudson likes comment defending her relationship\n\nOn her social media activity, Jordon Hudson has decided to like a comment that defends Hudson after she was called a gold digger by someone who doesn't agree with her life choices. The comment is not that long and it is straight to the point. Hudson liked the comment, proving she is 100% on board with this crazy experiment. It's true, there is no reason for people to go after Jordon Hudson for dating Bill Belichick. Age of consent is the main reason this is completely allowed. However, the 49-year age gap is definitely strange for anybody who likes to think of themselves as \"normal\". But that word in itself is relative, is it not? But Hudson already knows what dating an older gentleman is like. Her past boyfriend is currently 64 years old.\n\nHere is what the comment responded to someone who called her a gold digger and disapproved of this relationship: \"Who are you to judge ? She's a legal adult last I checked 21 you become an adult. What is it then? Are you jealous because you haven't accomplished anything in life, and feel a need to insult someone you don't even know. The reason people like you get away with making disparaging comments is because you probably won't be called out on it in person , where if the playing field was fair you would catch a slap like you deserve.\"\n\nLet us know what you think, di you believe coach Bill Belichick is wrong for dating a 23-year-old at the tender age of 72?"
