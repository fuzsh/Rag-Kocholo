        "text": "Bill Belichick reportedly struck up a relationship with a much younger woman following his shock split from longtime girlfriend Linda Holliday.\n\nThe famed football coach reportedly started dating Jordon Hudson, who is 49 years his junior, shortly after his breakup from Holliday, a source close to the former cheerleader told TMZ.\n\nKeep scrolling to learn more about the eight-time Super Bowl champion’s reported new flame.\n\nThey Met on a Plane\n\nThe unlikely pair reportedly met on a flight in 2021 after bonding over a philosophy project the then-student was working on.\n\nThey exchanged numbers and, although their relationship was friendly at first, things turned romantic sometime in 2023, per TMZ.\n\nIn fact, the duo was first spotted together as early as January 2023, seven months before his breakup from Holliday was reported.\n\nHowever, they didn’t confirm their romance until news broke that Belichick was officially a single man, stepping out hand-in-hand in New Orleans.\n\nThis doesn’t appear to be just a fling for the former New England Patriots coach, as he reportedly started including Holliday in his business endeavors.\n\nCollegiate Cheerleader Career\n\nHudson was a competitive cheerleader at Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts and even won a national championship title with the squad in 2021.\n\nIn February, she acknowledged National Girls & Women in Sports Day by sharing the positive impact cheerleading had on her life.\n\n“I’d like to put out how grateful I am for the sport that kept me anchored through difficult seasons of adolescence and young adulthood, engrained resilience, discipline, and punctuality into my bones (thanks J$) and brought me lifelong friends,” she wrote.\n\nHowever, she also thanked all “the medical professionals” who helped her “in neurological damage rehabilitation as resulted from repetitive concussions.”\n\nShe graduated from BSU with a Bachelor’s degree in Philosophy in May 2022.\n\nHowever, she seemingly kept up with the sport post-grad as Belichick was spotted at the 2024 Coastal At The Capitol Cheer and Dance event in Maryland in March, where she reportedly competed.\n\nBeauty School Graduate\n\nWhile still enrolled at BSU, Hudson also completed cosmetology school at the New England Hair Academy (NEHA).\n\nAfter graduating beauty school in November 2019, she worked as a Henna Tattoo artist, per her Linkedin.\n\nHer makeup and hair skills have come in handy for her pageant work.\n\nPageant Queen\n\nIn March 2024, Hudson competed in the Miss Maine USA pageant. She was the first runner-up behind Anne Baldridge.\n\nThe New England native represented the town of Hancock, a coastal town with a population of less than 3,000, at the time.\n\nShe was also presented with the Pageantry Spirit Award at the Miss US of America Pageant in February 2021.\n\nNature Lover\n\nJust one look at Hudson’s Instagram shows she is obsessed with all things nature. Her bio states that she is a “Bird-er” and “Glamorous Girl Scout” — and her photos reflect it.\n\nHudon’s feed is full of photos of her posing with different birds and from her travels around the world, such as Costa Rica, Croatia, Germany and more.\n\nShe also owned a parrot named Mango, which she described as her “goofy, cuddly and colorful feathered bestie.” However, Mango died in April 2022."
