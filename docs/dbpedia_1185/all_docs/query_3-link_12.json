As guests soak in the ambiance and relax to the rhythms of the rails, a fresh five-course gourmet meal is prepared and served on white table linens in traditional rail style.\n\nOur menus change from late spring to summer to fall, so make plans to return and try a new variation of our seafood, beef, and chicken entrees. With three classes of service, you can select a new rail car to try on a return ride as well. More details about the menus and classes of service can be found in the tabs below.\n\nAdvance reservations are required. A five-course meal and three-hour train ride are included in the fare. Massachusetts Meal Tax is also included. Gratuity is NOT included.\n\nProper dinner attire requested. No jeans, denim shorts, or T-shirts. Khaki shorts and a golf shirt are ok. A full bar is available, and all beverages are sold separately."
