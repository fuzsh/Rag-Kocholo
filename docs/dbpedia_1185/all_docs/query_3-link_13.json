        "text": "Stay with Us!\n\nThree blocks from the Deschutes River, the wonderfully uncommon hotel and pub are year-round favorites.\n\nBack to school in Bend, Oregon!\n\nWalking Tour\n\nThe Old St. Francis School, conveniently located in downtown Bend, was transformed from 1936 Catholic schoolhouse to a hotel complete with classrooms-turned-hotel rooms, a pub, brewery, a movie theater, private meeting/event space, live music and a soaking pool that beckons day travelers, shoppers, hikers, skiers and outdoor adventurers alike.\n\nTwo additional buildings – the Art House & Ed house – bring our total number of guestrooms to 60. Optional amenities include patios, suites and kitchenettes, but all rooms have their own bathrooms.\n\nWe honor the property's former life by featuring extensive artwork that pays homage to the history of the school and the surrounding community. Photos, memorabilia, our artists' renderings and students' artwork adorn the walls, making the hotel a unique gallery of sorts. Take note of the unusual custom-made light fixtures and stunning tile mosaics that surround the soaking pool. And in the Art and Ed Houses, wander slowly to discover secret hallways, secret rooms and a secret bar!\n\nOld St. Francis School allows pets on the side patios and in hotel rooms for a fee.\n\nCheck-in is at 3pm; check-out is at 11am\n\nFor ADA rooms, please contact the hotel directly.\n\nEd House\n\nFeaturing 17 guestrooms, each pays tribute to the school's legacy of outstanding educators. Wander the hallways on the first and second floor, and see if you happen upon the secret rooms. Art House\n\nFeaturing 24 guestrooms, each celebrating the work of our McMenamins artists by offering a glimpse into our artists' inspirations and journeys with McMenamins. Find the mysterious secret doorways, and you'll be led to discover beacons of light and art. View the Room Names and Galleries.\n\nCheck-in is at 3pm; check-out is at 11am\n\nSame day reservations must be made by calling the hotel.\n\nLoyal Order of the Slumbering Bed Heads\n\nBed Head Login\n\nNew Name, Same Program\n\nThe Loyal Order of the Slumbering Bed Heads was once known as our Frequent Guest Program.\n\nStay at our historic hotels and earn free nights!\n\nQuestions about your existing points? See our FAQs.\n\nPlease note: We are unable to issue points for reservations made through Expedia and Booking.com. For best results, book directly through mcmenamins.com. Limit one room per guest per night.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nFirst, create or update your profile in our online reservations systemand follow the prompts to join the Bed Head Program; you'll receive monthly email reminders about the program! Keep an eye out for upcoming events, seasonal promotions and even occasional specials just for Bed Heads.\n\nStay with us! Points are automatically rewarded 24 hours after check out - you'll receive 100 points per night in rooms with a common bath, 150 points per night in rooms with a private bath and 50 points per night in Edgefield’s hostel rooms. Your accrued points can be viewed at any time in your online profile. Please note: points accrued during your stay are not available for immediate redemption.\n\nWhen you've accrued 900 points or more, search results on our online system will include a \"900 point\" rate for rooms (based on availability). Choose this rate to redeem your points. Add-ons, like our Romance Package, will still be available at regular prices.\n\nRules\n\nThis offer is for individual bookings only; the offer does not apply to contracted groups or conferences.\n\nAll of your qualifying nights must be booked under the same guest profile for points to accrue correctly.\n\nOnly 1 room per night is accruable.\n\nYou must be a member of the Loyal Order of the Slumbering Bed Heads to accrue points and redeem your complimentary stays.\n\nQualifying nights begin the day you sign up! Sorry, our program is not retroactive.\n\nThe Grand Suite at Grand Lodge, Family Suite and Parrish House at Old St. Francis, and Family Rooms at Edgefield are not available for redemption.\n\nBased on availability; blackout dates may apply.\n\nReward nights and free or sponsored promotional stays are excluded from earning points in the program.\n\nNo credit for \"no-shows” or cancellations within cancellation policy.\n\nRedemption must be booked prior to arrival and points cannot be redeemed upon check out.\n\nAny questions can be sent to loyalty@mcmenamins.com.\n\nPlease note: All rules are subject to change.\n\nImportant Information about Bed Head Points\n\nIn order to accumulate points, it is important that you use the same username and password every time you make a reservation. When guests create multiple profiles, points get scattered across them, making them difficult to use for free stays.\n\nNeed help aligning multiple user profiles or resetting your password? Contact us at loyalty@mcmenamins.com so we can merge your accounts into one or help with passwords.\n\nLodging Policies\n\nPolicies:\n\nRoom and package rates are the same for single or double occupancy.\n\nA credit card for authorization purposes and ID are required at check-in.\n\nDebit cards are accepted, however McMenamins is not responsible for overdrafts caused by holds on your account.\n\nAdd $25 per person after double occupancy.\n\nChildren age six and under stay free.\n\nFor ADA rooms, please contact the hotel directly.\n\nAdditional pet fee per pet, per day.

Join the Loyal Order of the Slumbering Bed Heads and earn a night on us!\n\nSurrounding Attractions\n\nWhile your intent may be to just relax on our property – enjoy some handcrafted ales, sit in the soaking pool, take in a movie – you'll miss out unless you explore downtown Bend and the beautiful surrounding region. Here are just a few ideas...\n\nOutdoor Recreation\n\nIf you are a skier, Bend is the place to be in winter. Mount Bachelor offers ten alpine lines, six of them high-speed, while Hoodoo Mountain Resort offers a variety of runs – and tubing – for the whole family.\n\nIf you are a golfer, Bend is the place to be in spring, summer and fall.

It was the realization of a long-held dream of parish priest Father Luke Sheehan.\n\nFather Luke, who hailed from County Cork, Ireland, had come to Bend in 1910 as part of a mission to the \"wilds\" of Oregon made by the Irish Capuchin order of Catholic priests. Father Luke established and cultivated the St. Francis parish, initially by trekking hundreds of miles on horseback or on foot, to meet with those first, widely dispersed parishioners. Among this pious group were many of the priest's countrymen, Irish immigrants who had converged upon the high desert mostly to work as sheepherders.\n\nFather Luke's nephew, Dominic O'Connor, was also a Capuchin priest, who like his uncle, came to Bend. Father Dominic, though, made quite a name for himself before coming to Oregon. In fact, in the annals of Irish history, Father Dominic O'Connor is heralded as a national hero. His deeds done in support of the Irish Republic are celebrated in text, verse and song. After coming to Bend in 1922, Father Dominic lived a much quieter life devoted to serving the St. Francis Parish, and more generally, the Baker Diocese. This service firmly established the Irish hero as an important figure within the history of Central Oregon.\n\nAll of the groundwork done by Fathers Luke and Dominic and their Capuchin brethren, laid a solid foundation allowing for the school's construction, which ironically came during the economically dire days of the Great Depression. The original brick school building contained four classrooms, with grades one through eight paired two to a room. That first year, there were 145 students enrolled. In years to come, that number soared to more than 300. To accommodate enrollment increases, additions were made to the school in the 1950s and '60s. The first add-on of two classrooms was done in 1953. Seven years later, four more rooms were constructed. Then, in 1968, a spacious new parish center was built along the school's north side to house a gym, stage, meeting rooms and cafeteria.\n\nBy all accounts, the nuns who taught at St. Francis, all of whom were of the Sisters of the Holy Names order from Marylhurst University campus south of Portland, were effective teachers; many were taskmasters, and most had a big heart (though some chose not to wear it on their sleeve).\n\nBeginning in the late 1960s, change was afoot. Student uniforms were no longer required and lay teachers began to fill the roster at St. Francis School, and the remaining nuns no longer wore habits. But while the formal look of the faculty and student body was relaxed, the focus on quality education remained constant.\n\nIn 2000, the St. Francis School relocated to a newly constructed modern campus on the northeastern section of the city. The old downtown property, which now included four old bungalow houses on the back end of the lot, passed to McMenamins, who renovated and reopened the landmark as the Old St. Francis School in November 2004.\n\nHold your Private Event at Old St. Francis School\n\nWeddings Meetings Social Events\n\nWe have indoor event spaces that accommodate up to 120 guests year-round – for your next meeting, a wedding, special celebration or function.
