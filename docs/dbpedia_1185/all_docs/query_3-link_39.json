        "text": "From the naturally blessed shores of Lake Como right down to Sicily's heart-melting capital Palermo, you could throw a dart anywhere on a map of Italy and land on one of the most romantic places in the world. It's spurred on much debate within the team but if we had to choose just one fuzzy-eyed spot in Italy, it's the Amalfi Coast. We're not alone in our admiration either. The Greeks, so taken by the area’s natural beauty, attributed it to a nymph who captivated the heart of Hercules. The towns of Amalfi Coast only add to the charm, with brightly hued houses dotted along the rocking hillside, each offering a unique outlook along with shops, restaurants and swimming spots that are up for discovery.\n\nWhere to stay: Pretty much all of the best Amalfi Coast hotels fit the bill for a honeymoon or romantic getaway. In terms of location, Borgo Santandrea in Amalfi is a winner, perched high in the cliffs and built into the rock face overlooking the sea. All rooms have floor-to-ceiling windows and sea views. Palazzo Avino in Ravello has equally knock-out views, especially from the top-floor Infinito Suite with its large living room and a bathroom with a hot-tub-style bath. For a stay that pulls out all of the stops, it doesn't get much better than Le Sirenuse, a Pompeii-style red and white building in the centre of Positano. The restaurant here, La Sponda, with its 400 candles and bougainvillaea-clad dining room, is quite possibly the most romantic in the region.\n\nFor going off-grid\n\nConfetti bursts of colourful tropical fish in gin-clear lagoons, freshly prepared breakfast spreads delivered to your private pool via floating trays, sipping a morning coffee while a manta ray soars underneath your feet – it's the stuff of honeymoon dreams and the much lauded reality of a trip to the Maldives. While there are plenty of family-friendly hotels in the Maldives, few places can compare to the archipelago country's innate sense for romance and adults-only stays. Boutique stays and lo-fi boltholes area rarity here, instead the best hotels in the Maldives are world class, spread out on their own private islands, nestling state-of-the-art spas and multiple restaurants amongst lush jungles, pristine beaches and house reefs.\n\nWhere to stay: Romance comes naturally to pretty much all of the hotels in this region. Some standout spots include Vakkaru, a lush coconut tree-covered island resort with a jungle cinema that guests can reserve for a private dinner and movie under the stars. For the latest shiny stay, Six Senses recently set up its second hotel in the Maldives, offering up a tip-top spa with an impressive couples' suite. In terms of aesthetics, it's hard to beat Gili Lankanfushi Maldives, where all villas are stilted over one of the most eye-wateringly beautiful lagoons in the country, keeping the island wild and the beaches on full dazzling display.\n\nSantorini is the knockout Greek island – the island with the best views, the best sunsets, and the best hotels. Combine all of these elements and it's a recipe for one of the most romantic spots in the world. Days are best spent out on the water, sailing to nearby islands and hopping between the best beaches in Santorini. But then again you could easily stay at one of the best hotels in Santorini – where private infinity pools boast the best seats in the house – and never want to leave.\n\nWhere to stay: For one of the best views on the island, check in to cliffside Nobu Hotel, where the 25 luxe rooms and suites come with uninterrupted views of the Aegean. Similarly Andronis Boutique Hotel offers up a series of traditional cave-style suites and villas with private infinity pools, cave pools and hot tubs, set right in the heart of Oía. For a private stay, this traditional cave house in Oia is one of top trending homes on Airbnb. The view is postcard worthy, made all the more romantic when admired from the semi-cave whirlpool and multi-level private terrace.\n\nFor a weekend break\n\nWhen it comes to a romantic city break it's hard not to have all eyes on Paris. The clichés can't help but ring true when exploring the city, from serene strolls along the Seine to a glass of wine with a view at one of the best rooftop bars in Paris. And then there are the hotels in Paris, amongst some of the best in the world, sublime in their views, old-world charm and effortlessly chic interiors.\n\nWhere to stay: Newcomer Le Grand Mazarin, in the enduringly romantic Le Marais, is one of the prettiest places to stay – all velvet pouffes, clashing prints and tapestry canopies over the beds. Nearby, Maison Proust has only 23 Belle Époque-style suites and a swoon-worthy Moroccan-style heated pool. To make a grand romantic gesture, reserve a room at St James Hotel in 16th arrondissement, Paris’s only officially designated château-hotel. This 11th arrondissement Airbnb also makes for a romantic stay, complete with fluffy bathrobes, sleek decor and a leafy private terrace.\n\nFor a winter sun escape\n\nWith Morocco’s year-round, bone-warming weather just a three-hour flight from London, Marrakech makes for a sunny romantic escape when all is gloomy at home. And while the buzz of the Old City's winding souks and the sight of cobras dancing out of baskets make for a fun adventure, there are other sides to Marrakech away from the noise of Jemaa el-Fna square and the tourists at the Jardin Majorelle. For a slower and more private pace, swap the medina for the Musée Yves Saint Laurent Marrakech, followed by a drink at Grand Café de la Poste, one of the most beautiful restaurants in the city.\n\nWhere to stay: When it comes to places to stay, the list of best hotels in Marrakech has grown rampantly in recent years, but our favourite – and by far the most romantic – is still La Mamounia. Set in 20 acres of gardens just inside the walls of the Old City, the hotel has retained the feel of a palace but added a contemporary theatricality to its accommodation (which now includes three three-bedroom riads with their own pools), plus four restaurants, five bars and a Salon de Thé. For a pretty riad stay, reserve a traditional room at Riad Sadaka and don't forget your swimming costume – the courtyard pool is simply stunning.\n\nThe spiritual getaway\n\nBali is beloved as the land of a million islands, misty, mythical mountainous stacks, and chilled-out beach clubs. It's also the land of some of the most beautiful places to stay in the world. No matter how many five-star hotels open up though, Bali is no homogenized island resort. It's a magical, spiritual place, which manages to retain its authenticity and culture, as well as its unspoilt beaches and green tropical landscapes. All essential ingredients for a romantic stay.\n\nWhere to stay: The list of fabulous Bali hotels is always expanding, but for something more down to earth, look to Sandat Glamping tents, set among bright-green rice fields close to Ubud. Cuddling under canvas is less lumpy groundsheets and roof leaks, more canopy beds and private decks. Newcomer Buahan, a Banyan Tree Escape, is a “no walls, no doors” resort with just 16 villas as well as a two-story central pavilion from which a dreamy, lounger-lined infinity pool protrudes into the valley.\n\nFor bohemian chic\n\nThe golden beaches of Mexico have long been a draw for couples, but one such spot is increasingly becoming the go-to for well-heeled couples seeking bohemian barefoot luxury. Just south of Cancun on the Yucatán Peninsula lies Tulum, the promised land of designer yoga, spiritual jungle journeys and ancient-temple-fringed sands. Plus some of the best hotels in Mexico.\n\nWhere to stay: Casa Malca is a former hacienda of Pablo Escobar’s, and now a boutique hotel highly curated by socialite art dealer Lio Malca. Down a dirt path and away from the scrums of man-buns and juiced-up goddesses, here beach suites face a quiet stretch of powder-white sand; all windows point to the Caribbean. The hotel itself is like one giant immersive art exhibition; the entrance has a huge door carved out of tree trunks, framed by curtains stitched from vintage wedding gowns, between which dangle two swings made of antique furniture. As Lio says, it’s about ‘connecting with yourself and the wild’ as well as ‘luxury and art’.\n\nFor the outdoorsy\n\nNature-lovers can’t help but fall for Big Sur, a wild and storied stretch of California’s central coast. Its bewitching blend of towering redwood forest, muscular green mountains and crashing ocean views has drawn everyone from bohemian writers (Henry Miller) to Hollywood heavyweights (Steve McQueen), seeking isolation in its eucalyptus-scented heart. Is there anything more seductive than hiking hand-in-hand to remote, wooded waterfalls or discovering your own dramatic, deserted beach?\n\nWhere to stay: Look to Alila Ventana, which sprawls across a Big Sur mountain meadow and where suites have a rustic-luxe, cabin-esque vibe. When you’ve finished gazing over the Pacific from your balcony hammock (roomy enough for two), try a couple’s treatment in a forest-facing spa cabana, plunge into the open-air Japanese baths, or take a dip in the clothing-optional communal pool.\n\nFor island indulgence\n\nThe world ‘oohs’ and 'aahs' about the Maldives but smart travellers know the Seychelles warrants just as much fanfare. Thanks to the islands' remoteness – 1,600km off the east coast of Africa – they have never been cheap to visit, or, for that matter, on any cruise-ship itineraries. And there in lies the appeal.\n\nWhere to stay: Only the best of the best can set up a hotel in the Seychelles. One such address is the Four Seasons Resort Seychelles, a remote hillside retreat overlooking the bay of Petite Anse on the south-west coast of Mahé. The 67 stilted villas and suites feel like tree houses, peeping out from the jungle canopy of coconut, mango, jackfruit and cinnamon trees. All the obligatory features of the luxury 'Robinson Crusoe' experience are in place – infinity-edged plunge pools, open-air showers, glass-walled bathrooms and expansive outdoor living areas – but taken to another level. At Six Senses Zil Pasyon, the villas are also more akin to super-smart, minimalist tree-houses, secluded amid rocks and pristine forest.\n\nIt may be a busy city, full of comings and goings and beeping traffic jams, but New York is no stranger to magical moments of romance. It usually hits the city when the first autumn leaves start to fall, blanketing the city in shades of auburn and ruby, crescendoing up until Christmas when leaves are swapped for twinkling lights. During this time one of the most romantic things to do in New York is to just take a walk, around Central Park, through Greenwich Village, along The High Line.\n\nWhere to stay: To lean into the romance of it all, play up to the old New York charms with a stay on the Upper East Side. There's The Lowell (pictured) on ritzy East 63rd Street, where bedrooms are the last word in elegance, with polished mahogany floors, Persian rugs and good, hand-made furniture. For pure relaxation amongst the chaos, check into the Aman in midtown, where the sprawling, three-floor spa and wellness centre has a 65-foot pool, plus not one but two spa houses – one centred around an Eastern European banya, the other a Moroccan hammam.\n\nFor island chic\n\nAs insiders will tell you, there's a lot more to Ibiza than meets the eye. Go off the beaten track even a fraction and you will discover a world of sleepy hill villages, wild forests, rambling orchards and crumbling farm houses. Time your visit to spring and a further surprise awaits: almond trees in full bloom, covering great swathes of the interior, with entire valleys exploding into glorious white and pink blossom. All this is complemented by an appealing combination of warm days and chilly nights.\n\nWhere to stay: Front-row seats for this extraordinary natural show are available at Cas Gasi, a 12-room property that spills down a hillside smothered in almond, fig and carob trees. Since opening in 1998, Cas Gasi has become known as one of the best hotels in Ibiza, particularly with high-profile guests who love its secluded location and low-key luxury. OKU Ibiza also has a privileged location that gives you access to the most beautiful beach spots on the island, along with wabi sabi–inspired design, two serene swimming pools, regular yoga sessions and fusion cuisine.\n\nFor romance by rail\n\nThere is something irresistibly romantic about luxury train travel. Add India to the mix and you've got an experience guaranteed to dazzle. In the heyday of the maharajas it was not unusual for royalty to travel with their furniture – four-poster beds, thrones, you name it. This is certainly the look the new Maharajas' Express is going for. One of the only luxury trains offering itineraries that cross India's state borders, 'Royal India' is a seven-day epic journey from Delhi to Mumbai, taking in Agra, Ranthambore, Jaipur, Bikaner, Jodhpur, Udaipur (pictured above) and Vadodara along the way.\n\nAmong the highlights is a decadent Champagne lunch on a hillock overlooking the Taj Mahal, a tiger-spotting jeep safari in Ranthambore National Park and elephant polo matches in Jaipur culminating in a Champagne dinner. Life on board is all about comfort. All the cabins and suites are wonderfully regal with huge windows, comfortable beds, LCD TV's and DVD players; but if your feeling particularly flush, book the two-bedroom Presidential Suite, which occupies an entire carriage and has a living room big enough for several comfortable sofas and a dining table. (The junior suite is also surprisingly roomy and much more reasonably priced.) Other treats include an observation carriage with its own bar, games table and club armchairs, and two fine-dining restaurants.\n\nThe spa retreat\n\nAccessed only by boat, the secluded, car-free private-island hideaway of Jumby Bay (pictured above), two miles off the coast of Antigua, offers the quintessential Caribbean experience. The standout for romance is the spa, set close to the beach and open to the elements, with five treatment rooms that open onto private terraces. The signature treatments use ingredients taken straight from the garden; one of the highlights is a treatment that involves lying in a soft, handmade hammock while a therapist focuses on pressure points in your head, back, hands and feet to release tension. You can then amble over to your thatched bohio (hut) on the beach, or to one of the many hammocks strung up between the palm trees. The resort is good for creative little extras: to help you enjoy the astonishing night sky, staff will pack a Champagne picnic dinner and send you off to star-gaze on Pasture Beach; there are also cookery classes for men, led by head chef Paolo Lovari, so while their partners indulge in spa treatments (not to generalise), they can learn how to make everything from ceviche to Caribbean lobster bisque.\n\nFor a hit to all the senses\n\nIn any line-up of the world’s most romantic cities, Venice has long been blazing a trail. This jewel-box city has an extraordinary ability to seduce every one of its visitors – whether it’s via the haunting cry of a gondolier bouncing off the city’s ancient stone walls; the awe and wonder of sighting a Caravaggio in a backstreet church, or the first sip of a perfectly sweet Bellini in a tiny cicchetti bar stumbled upon by chance. Skip the summer, when oppressive crowds steal much of Venice’s romance and come in winter instead – the city becomes intoxicatingly quiet, and you’ll get most of the big-ticket sites all to yourself. To dial up the romance, whoosh in on the Venice-Simplon Orient Express: it’s hands-down the most lavish train journey in the world, and guaranteed to whisk you straight back to the golden age of travel.\n\nWhere to stay: If you’ve got deep pockets, you can’t beat a stay at Aman Venice – the gilded ballrooms, Murano chandeliers and priceless frescoes were good enough for the Clooney’s wedding night. But if you want to flee the paparazzi, float across the lagoon to Belmond Hotel Cipriani, a little pocket of peace with romantic rose and hydrangea-filled gardens and an enormous pool with views across to St Mark’s Square. Slightly further afield but no less magical, Casa Burano offers a more laidback, affordable stay, squirrelled away in a string of candy-coloured fishermen’s houses on film-set pretty Burano. The island can get busy at times, but once the day-trippers vanish, there’s no better place to catch one of Venice’s famous fuchsia-pink sunsets.\n\nFor flinging on your dancing shoes\n\nBuenos Aires is often touted as South America’s answer to Paris. Yet there’s far more to the sultry Argentinean capital than it’s intoxicating collision of European and Latin American cultures. This enduringly sexy city is an endless love affair of tango, sizzling asado and big, full-bodied wines – and most definitely a place to get dressed up and stay out late. A crop of exciting young chefs is revolutionising the city’s thrillingly unpretentious food scene, and buzzy rooftop cocktail bars are slowly taking over the city. And of course, there’s no better way to get under Buenos Aires’ skin than by learning the art of the world’s most passionate dance – even better if it’s done at a traditional, dimly-lit milonga.\n\nWhere to stay: Palacio Duhau dominates Buenos Aires’ hotel scene – inside, it’s a feast of glittering chandeliers and marble floors, while the candlelit terrace at restaurant Los Salones del Piano Nobile is an unbeatable date night spot. For a more authentic experience in the heart of trendy foodie neighbourhood Palermo, Home is a hipsters’ hangout with a tiny pool flanked by blousy jacaranda trees and the smell of jasmine lingering in the air. The delightful staff are the hotel’s biggest asset – miraculously appearing exactly when you need them, but utterly tuned in to knowing when you just want to be left alone with your significant other.\n\nFor adventurous spirit\n\nIt's hard not to fall for Iceland’s awe-inspiring primal landscapes. The country delivers a hit of romance and adventure in equal measure, and in winter – when short days shout out for cosy nights snuggled by the fire, and there’s a decent chance of spotting the elusive Northern Lights dance across the eerily dark skies – there’s no better time to visit this Nordic superstar. To take it all in, hire a car and hit the 828-mile Ring Road route – wending its way along the country’s entire coastal region, it’s one of the world’s most romantic road trips, swishing past the glaciers, geysers and black sand beaches Iceland is so famous for.\n\nWhere to stay: There are plenty of cute cabins to book into along the way: we particularly like the look of this one, touching distance from Seljalandsfoss, one of Iceland’s most breathtaking waterfalls. To really hole up and hide away, book into Deplar Farm: deep in the ravishingly remote, bleak but beautiful Tröllaskagi Peninsula, this is one of Europe’s most isolated lodges – and a stay here truly is a once-in-a-lifetime treat. In Reykjavik, the Edition has warm and inviting rooms, with Italian furnishings made from ash wood and floor-to-ceiling windows that either frame the fjord and Mt. Esja or views of downtown.\n\nFor adventurous couples\n\nForget for a moment that the Whitsundays’ largest inhabited island is positioned right beside Heart Reef (exactly as it sounds: a perfectly heart-shaped coral reef). Because Hamilton Island isn’t for your typical doe-eyed duo – more for those possessing an affinity with the Australian fixation for flinging yourself into adrenalin-pumping stuff. The immaculate waters of the Great Barrier Reef offer world-class dive sites to discover together, while the island’s off-road trails provide a white-knuckle rush deep into the bush.\n\nWhere to stay: After a thrilling helicopter ride over this insanely Eden-esque landscape, daredevils can decompress at Qualia, a smart property on its own peninsula. It has 60 secluded one-bedroom, glass-walled pavilions, with private sundecks for gazing over the water – some with their own infinity-edged pool.\n\nThe off-grid escape\n\nWant to run away together? No one will find you at The Brando, an all-villa, super-exclusive hideaway on a private South Pacific island (30 miles north of Tahiti, but accessible only by six-seater plane). Marlon Brando bought Tetiaroa atoll in 1967 and, decades later, set about creating this sustainable, utopian spot, where nature alone provides both decoration and diversion. Smart, thatched dwellings tucked among coconut palms each have their own strip of sand, infinity pool and outdoor tub. The pristine lagoon and blindingly white beach are yours – all yours! – to explore. A hefty all-inclusive rate encompasses daily spa treatments, Champagne, food, excursions and more. (Be sure to make eyes at each other over French chef Guy Martin’s Michelin-grade feasts.) With only 35 villas on the entire island, intimacy comes guaranteed.\n\nFor old-school romance\n\nWe’ve got the likes of Cezanne, Renoir and Van Gogh to thank for parcelling up the pure timeless romance of Provence. A post-impressionist haze of higgledy-piggledy medieval hamlets, rolling olive groves and sunflowers lined up in serried ranks, Provence is the perfect setting for giddy sun-baked afternoons sipping rosé under the shade of a cypress tree, pedalling through lavender fields or hopping between vineyards.\n\nWhere to stay: There’s no shortage of romantic hotels to live out your Provençal fantasy in. Crillon Le Brave’s ramble of wisteria-tangled honey-stone buildings dominates an entire hilltop village; the best suites resemble private pieds-à-terre, with side-by-side rolltop baths and all-consuming views over the muted pastoral landscape. A little further south, Chateau Saint Martin is an ideal base for art lovers keen to explore gallery-laced St-Paul-de-Vence, brimming with pétanque-playing locals and home to the legendary family-run restaurant La Colombe d’Or. Back at the hotel, there’s a knockout spa (treatments can be taken in the rose garden on sunny days), and a Michelin-starred restaurant with neatly framed views of the glittering Cote d’Azur. Up here in the hills, you’re in proper fairy-tale Provence – and it’s the absolute antithesis to its see-and-be-seen coastal neighbour.\n\nFor getting up-close with nature\n\nTo see Africa at its beguiling best, head to Botswana. The government here has put sustainability at its heart, shunning a revolving door tourism model in favour of low-volume, high-value stays. It’s a brilliant ploy to prevent the country’s precious national parks from becoming overrun, and in turn, Botswana has become one of the most exclusive spots for a safari – perhaps best known for epic wildlife-spotting opportunities and plum stays in some of Africa’s finest and most intimate lodges. Sure, you might not tick off all of the Big Five while you’re here, but instead of sitting in a bottleneck of 4x4s, you can cruise silently through the Okavango Delta’s network of waterways in a dugout canoe, or quadbike across the arid wilderness of the Makgadikgadi salt pans. There’s something utterly hallucinatory about the silence and seclusion; serene hot air balloon rides stand in for gas-guzzling helicopter flights, while nights in billowing white tents are paired with G&Ts around firepits and sleepouts with your lover under the starry skies.\n\nWhere to stay: A little oasis in the middle of the Kalahari Desert, Jack’s Camp is one of Botswana’s smartest places to stay, and the camp’s mahogany furniture and four-poster beds smack of old-world glamour. If you prefer something a little more modern, Xigera Lodge is an ultra-sustainable, off-grid choice – and it's filled to the brim with specially-commissioned works from exciting young African artists. Most importantly, it’s so vast you’d never know you weren’t the only guests. If you’re seeking a bucket-list honeymoon, this is it."
