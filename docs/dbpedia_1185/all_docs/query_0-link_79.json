        "text": "For too long, The Bold and the Beautiful has underused the eminently watchable Don Diamond and his rascally character, Dollar Bill Spencer. Sure, the fake affair with crazy Sheila Carter was a fun bit of nonsense. And when he has scenes with Poppy Nozawa, the two of them spark like Roman candles on the Fourth of July. But for the most part, Diamont and Bill have been chilling on the backburner.\n\nWe’d like to change that.\n\nIf Bold & Beautiful doesn’t need Bill front and center at the moment, fine. Cross him over to The Young and the Restless (where it’s been years since Diamont played ill-fated lawnboy-turned-businessman Brad Carlton). There, he could be courted by Genoa City’s fashionistas for coverage in Eye on Fashion. And his trip could start as just that — a jaunt, a visit, a drive-by. But once he gets a gander at a certain redheaded local, all bets would be off.\n\nPhyllis would immediately become Bill’s reason for remaining in Genoa City. Getting to know her. Getting to be around her. Getting her to like him. He’d assume that accomplishing these goals would be no problem. “I’m told I’m pretty irresistible,” he could say, turning on the charm.\n\n“Awful, isn’t it,” she could reply, “the way people will lie right to your face.”\n\nBill could insist that he needs Phyllis’ help. He’s thinking of opening an Eye on Fashion office in Genoa City. Mm-hmm. Because when he thinks of haute couture, he thinks of Wisconsin. Anyway, she’d be the perfect person to be his local editor, he says, what with her having run Restless Style and all. “Oh my God,” she exclaims. “You’re trying to ask me out and hire me in the same breath. You’re basically calling me a hooker!”\n\nSlowly but surely, though, Phyllis would have to admit that Bill is kinda funny. And really handsome. And sorta dynamic. And unlike Danny, Bill doesn’t have the Bug attached to him like a thirsty mosquito. “Such as you are, it might be nice to go out with a guy who isn’t in love with someone else for a change,” Phyllis says. “Wait, you don’t have a wife waiting for you back in L.A., do you?”\n\n“A wife?” Bill replies. “Um, no.”\n\nHearing the “um,” Phyllis would demand that Bill come clean about his West Coast girlfriend — just in time for Poppy to walk through the doors of the Genoa City Athletic Club. “I got tired of waiting for you to come back,” she exclaims as she wraps her arms around her loverboy, “so I decided to come see you — surprise!\n\n“Who’s your pretty friend?” she adds, eyeing Phyllis suspiciously."
