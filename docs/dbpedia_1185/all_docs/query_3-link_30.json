If you’re in the mood for a hopeful story about friendship sprinkled with secrets and gorgeous waterside scenes, dive into The Summer of Songbirds by bestselling author Kristy Woodson Harvey. If atmospheric mysteries set in the Adirondack Mountains are more your style, look no further than God of the Woods by Liz Moore, which is being touted as “the mystery of the summer.”\n\nKeep scrolling for all of our summer camp novel recommendations — there is something for everyone!\n\nDad Camp by Evan S. Porter\n\nThis funny, heartwarming tale follows father-daughter duo John and Avery. John hopes that dragging his preteen daughter Avery away to a “father-daughter week” at a remote summer camp will finally get their relationship back to old times — when they were best friends who did everything together. But when they arrive, John realizes this place is far from the scenic, picture-perfect summer camp he had in mind. What follows is a story about growing up, love, family and friendship.\n\nWhat readers are saying: “Filled with beautiful, flawed characters doing their best and the camp nostalgia of our childhood, this is a book that will make you laugh out loud, nod along in solidarity and also shed a few tears.”\n\nWildfire by Hannah Grace\n\nThe latest in Hannah Grace’s Maple Hills series is another fun, swoon-worthy love story. Maple Hills college students Russ Callaghan and Aurora Roberts once met at a party…and ended up spending one steamy night together. Aurora doesn’t expect much from people or men in general, so she sneaks out before Russ could learn her name. So both are shocked when they bump into one another again at the first day of summer camp where they’re both counselors. What follows is a sweet, heart-fluttering story about two people searching for a place that feels like home and realizing that, sometimes, home is a person.\n\nWhat readers are saying: “As a girl who loves summer camp, I feel like so much of this book was made for me. From the nosy campers to the summer thunderstorms, evening activities and ‘camp goggles,’ I was transported back to my own summers as a counselor. The progression of Russ’ relationship with Aurora was picture perfect — and I loved how they made a conscious effort to avoid any miscommunications.”\n\nThe Summer of Songbirds by Kristy Woodson Harvey\n\nFilled with heartfelt emotion and endearing characters, this saga follows four women who reunite to save the summer camp that changed their lives. June and her niece, Daphne, and Daphne’s two best friends, Lanier and Mary Stuart, are all struggling with issues in their own lives. But they return to Camp Holly Springs and band together to save it. A celebration of friendship and sisterhood.\n\nWhat readers are saying: “My girlfriends mean everything to me — and I can never resist a good book about the power of female friendships,” says Patty Bontekoe, Woman’s World Executive Editor. “This was a feel-good read and witnessing the love among these women — despite their challenges — encouraged me to call up my own friends for a summer get-together.”\n\nOne Last Summer by Kate Spencer\n\nThis swoon-worthy love story follows Clara Millen as she jets off to her beloved Pine Lake Camp in a last-ditch attempt to turn her life around. But when she gets there and learns the property is being sold, Clara has no choice but to team up with her old camp nemesis Mack to try and save the day. A beautiful story glittering with hope and happiness.\n\nWhat readers are saying: “I loved the return to childhood camp setting! This is such a great summer read. The romance tie-in was seamless and this would be the best beach read — and that’s not to trivialize it at all. This story also has depth — between what to do with a quarter-life crisis and the gut punch of nostalgia. I don’t always go for summer fiction, but I felt so happy while reading this one.”\n\nThe God of The Woods by Liz Moore\n\nRiveting family drama and absorbing history meld in this fascinating page-turner. Camp Emerson is located in the Adirondack Mountains and owned by the Var Laar family. One August morning in 1975, a camp counselor uncovers an empty bunk where Barbara Van Lear was sleeping…and it’s not the first time a Van Laar child has gone missing. What follows is a nail-biting community search rife with secrets and, hopefully, second chances.\n\nWhat readers are saying: “As a former camp director of a summer camp in the Adirondacks, I could not wait to read this book. I loved it! Excellent story and beautifully written. Once I figured out the various timelines, it was easy to follow different storylines occurring at different times. Great characters! I will be thinking of TJ, Barbara, Judy and Tracy for days to come. Loved the ending. Just sorry that it is over. Highly recommended.”\n\nThe Clover Girls by Viola Shipman\n\nThis beautifully written dual POV tale follows Liz, V, Rachel and Emily, who met at summer camp as teens, spent four amazing summers together and swore they would be friends forever. But that didn’t happen, and most of them haven’t spoken in decades. Now in their 40s, Emily asks Liz, V and Rachel to reunite at camp and finally make amends. What follows is a battle of friendship, strength and summertime bliss.\n\nWhat readers are saying: “One of my favorite escapes is always through a good book — and this one was a direct ticket to warm, sunny days and summer nostalgia,” says Melissa D’Agnese, Women’s World Senior Editor. “I also enjoyed the heart-tugging themes of personal growth and friendship throughout.”\n\nYou Have a Match by Emma Lord\n\nFrom New York Times bestselling author Emma Lord comes another uplifting young adult saga. After signing up for a DNA service to get to the attention of her crush, Leo, high schooler Abby discovers a shocking piece of information: She has a younger sister named Savannah who also just happens to be Instagram-famous. Desperate to connect, Abby asks to meet her at a summer camp. What follows is a tender story neither one of them thought possible.\n\nWhat readers are saying: “As a fan of The Parent Trap this book had me grinning from ear to ear,” shares Carissa Mosness, Woman’s World Assistant Digital Editor. “Not only was the sibling relationship super sweet, but the camp setting made me want to escape into the woods for a week!”\n\nThe Interestings by Meg Wolitzer\n\nThis heartfelt and tender New York Times bestselling novel by Meg Wolitzer follows Jules, Ethan, Jonah, Ash and Goodman — five best friends who meet at a summer camp for artsy teens in 1974 and stay connected throughout their lives.\n\nWhat readers are saying: “Meg Wolitzer has created wonderfully complex, flawed characters whose lives we witness from adolescence through adulthood. I was taken with them in the beginning and could not let them go. I actually found myself at one point longing to be part of their tight-knit group, but wondered if I’d ever be considered interesting enough to be invited. Of course, it turned out that being an Interesting was not everything the young adolescents thought it would be.”\n\nThe Firelight Girls by Kaya McLaren\n\nThis beautiful story is an ode to summers gone by and the evolution of friendship. When 70-year-old former camp director Ethel finds out the summer camp she used to call home is facing an impending closure, she’s crushed. To make matters worse, she’s also nursing a broken heart. Then, the news of the camp on Lake Wenatchee reaches other women who grew up there: 40 year-old Shannon whose career just imploded, Laura who is having marital problems and Ruby, who betrayed Ethel many years ago. Jumping between the past and the present, the women must face hard truths from their pasts as they band together to save the summer camp of their youth.\n\nWhat readers are saying: “Kaya McLaren always tells a story of women’s friendships. Her characters may misunderstand one another and fall out, but in the end the power of their friendship helps them get through difficult times. The Firelight Girls is no exception. McLaren’s eye for human frailty is a backdrop to her compassionate and philosophical approach to life and relationships.”\n\nUntil Next Summer by Ali Brady\n\nSummer nostalgia, friendship and romance meld in Until Next Summer. Jessie and Hillary were best friends growing up and always looked forward to reuniting for the summer at Camp Chickawah — until their falling out. But years later when Jessie learns the camp will be sold, she plans a reunion and invites all past campers — including Hillary — for an “adult summer camp” experience before it closes. As Hillary and Jessie mend their relationship, they relive all the joy of past summers — only this time there are cocktails and romantic entanglements. Hillary agrees to a casual relationship with the camp chef while Jessie is drawn to a grumpy writer who rented a cabin to work on his novel. As they all embark on a summer to remember, Hillary and Jessie wonder if there’s still some way to save their beloved camp once and for all.\n\nWhat readers are saying: “Books about summer camp just make me feel some kind of way! I think it’s because we look back to those times through rose-colored glasses. And getting to escape into fictional stories about people revisiting their old stomping grounds and past summer camp memories is just beyond fun, nostalgic and heartwarming.”\n\nFor more summer book recommendations, keep reading!\n\n11 Captivating Summer Mysteries To Throw In Your Beach Bag!\n\n12 Best Audiobooks To Keep You Company This Summer, from Thrillers to Romance + More!"
