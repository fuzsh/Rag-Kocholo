This three hour workshop is strictly limited to 25 participants, so you can get the most out of the session.\n\nTalk\n\nBendigo Regional Archives Centre events\n\nBRAC provides a variety of events that showcase the history of the Bendigo region and the breadth of the region's archival collection. Events coming up include the August workshops 'Discovering History' and 'Handle with Care'.\n\nArticle\n\nCity views\n\nProfessor Andrew May's article examines the history of the construction of a scale model of Melbourne, made in 1838 for the 1888 Centennial International Exhibition. Reception of the model reveals that it held, at times, contradictory meanings for a variety of audiences and was a touchstone for nostalgic reflections about Melbourneâ€™s past, the progressive achievements observable in its present and uncertainties about urban development in its future.\n\nTalk\n\nTravelling to tomorrow\n\nJoin us for a history talk by Dr Yves Rees about the modern women who sparked Australia's romance with America. A celebrity decorator with blue hair. A single mother who advised JFK in the Oval Office. A Christian nudist with a passion for almond milk. Individually, they have extraordinary stories; together, they change the narrative of Australian history."
