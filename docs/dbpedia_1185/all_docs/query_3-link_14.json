        "text": "It's time to head back to school, and with every new school year comes a set of essentials to help you or your child get ready for class. In our increasingly connected world (laptops are a must for school now!) you've got to make sure you have all the tech goodies you need.\n\nWhen it comes to earbuds, Apple AirPods are massively popular. These crowd-pleasing earbuds pair easily with Apple devices (your iPhone can connect to them immediately) and sound great, too. Plus, they come in plenty of different form factors and sizes. If you're stocking up on everything you need for school now, you're in luck. There are several pairs of AirPods you can snatch up on sale right now.\n\nApple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation): $190 (24% off)\n\nSchool can mean grueling hours of classwork and studying. Your headphones should be able to keep up with you. With up to 30 hours of battery life via their charging case, the sleek Apple AirPods Pro 2nd Generation wireless earbuds deliver exceptional listening time, not to mention premium audio performance.\n\nThese upgraded earbuds surpass the original AirPods Pro in every way. An improved wireless chip and enhanced active noise cancellation give you an immersive listening experience, and their attractive curves make them even more pleasing to the eye.\n\nFor anyone who appreciates lengthy battery life and the very best sound quality, these are a fantastic choice. With all the upgrades over the previous model, including spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, the AirPods Pro 2nd Generation earbuds represent Apple's most advanced and best sounding wireless (Bluetooth) earbuds yet.\n\nThis version of the AirPods now comes with a USB Type-C charging case that also supports wireless charging. Another feature we love: the touch controls built into the stems.\n\nApple AirPods (3rd generation): $140 (17% off)\n\nDon't need the fanciest AirPods for school, but still want something new? Start the school year off with a pair of the third generation of the original AirPods. These are perfect for staying current and for everyday use -- without breaking the bank.\n\nThese AirPods come packed with features like spatial audio, Dolby Atmos support and longer battery life. They lack noise cancellation, however. You can get about 30 hours with the included MagSafe charging case, or up to six hours per charge on their own. They're not as advanced at the AirPods Pro 2nd Generation, but they generate really impressive audio.\n\nThese AirPods still receive regular Apple updates, so you'll get most of the new goodies the other newer models get. And of course, when you're using them with an Apple device, you get easy access to Siri and automatic pairing with each of your Apple devices as you switch between them.\n\nApple AirPods (2nd Generation): $80 (38% off)\n\nYou can't beat a pair of AirPods under $100. And if you want to send your kids or yourself back to school in style, budget-priced headphones are always a good idea. Especially when they perform this well.\n\nThese AirPods boast more than 24 hours total listening time (with the wireless charging case), a foolproof, one-tap setup for Apple device owners and a low-latency wireless connection (for full immersion when consuming movies and music). Plus, you truly can't beat the under-$100 price point.\n\nIf you want immersive audio from earbuds that carry the Apple name, opt for these affordable earbuds. They may not be the newest option on the market, but they're still every bit worth your cash, especially if your coffers are a bit empty after buying for the rest of the family this school year.\n\nApple AirPods Max: $400 (27% off)\n\nIf you want to indulge in a luxurious pair of premium quality headphones and you're already an Apple user, look no further than the AirPods Max. Not only are they great for students, but you might want to steal them away. These headphones look just as good as they sound. And in our coverage of the 11 best spatial audio headphones and earbuds for 2024, these were a top pick.\n\nWith lavish cushioned ear cups, booming audio, spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and absolutely fantastic active noise cancellation, the AirPods Max make a bold statement.\n\nPlus, transparency mode lets you tune into your surroundings when needed. And at 15 hours of playtime, these headphones keep your music flowing all day. Beyond performance, the AirPods Max make a fashion statement with five stylish color options.\n\nThese are the perfect option for Apple enthusiasts looking for a pair of excellent over-the-ear headphones. Currently, the Apple AirPods Max headphones are sale at Amazon for just $395 -- that's a whopping 28% off, but this deal is only available to Prime members."
