        "text": "Okay, so maybe ospreys are not an “emblem” of Long Island in any official capacity but, to those of us who spend a significant amount of time on the water, they are just that. As a south shore Long Islander, I can say they embody our ideals - majestic, loyal, unafraid, and a world class angler - and I often find myself stopping whatever I’m doing just to watch them.\n\nAs a species, they hold a special place in my heart and as such, I’ve written about them extensively here on ntvli.com. Rather than ask you to read more of my ramblings on how amazing they are, I spoke to several of my favorite photographers about why THEY love seahawks and asked them to share some of their favorite photos of this unique raptor.\n\nThank you to all who participated!\n\nLiana Jonas (@lianajonasphotography)\n\nIf you’re a Long Islander and wildlife lover like me, then you are quite familiar with ospreys. They are a harbinger of spring, and I eagerly await their arrival beginning in February. March 1st – my eyes are up to the sky and at our bodies of water. The date of my first spring osprey sighting is an annual ritual (March 10th this year)!\n\nAs a species, I love their undeniable fishing skills. Their laser vision spots prey in the murkiest of water. Ospreys weigh about three pounds. But their incredible strength allows them to plunge and immerse themselves into the water and catapult up and out, hauling a fish that could weigh almost as much as them. They are such devoted parents, as is illustrated in my submitted image. With gentleness, delicateness, and great care, they feed their broods bit by tiny bit, and behead the fish they catch to make it easier for the babies to eat.\n\nAs a photographer, who doesn’t love to photograph, “the catch,” that moment when an osprey lands a fish? The water action, the facial expressions of the fish, and the fierce look that only an osprey can give are exhilarating. Lastly, ospreys have an undeniable and endearing googly-eyed, bobblehead head and neck motion that make these fierce predators even more loveable. I am so grateful for all the conversation efforts that have helped these beautiful fish hawks make a comeback on the Island.\n\nBill Davis (@bd.rawvisuals)\n\nAs a wildlife photographer, I was immediately drawn to raptors, birds of prey. I find the osprey fascinating because this unique raptor has a diet unlike others that will prey on and eat nearly anything. The osprey is a piscivore feeding on fish 99% of the time, which as a photographer makes them easier to observe as they set out for their next meal. Find a body of water near where they nest and wait! They are fascinating to watch as they hunt. They have this beautiful display of flapping their wings as they “hover” above a body of water while using their keen eyesight to choose their prey just before diving at speeds up to 80 mph in pursuit of their next meal. Aside from their hunting behaviors, they are really fun to watch and capture while in the nest.\n\nOspreys almost always find their way back home as they migrate back to the same area on our island each year with the same mate and some even return to the same nest from the year before.\n\nAdrianna DeVillacian (@roamwithada)\n\nI enjoy spending mornings with the osprey every spring. The thrill of watching them dive for fish isn’t something I ever grow tired of. Like most birdwatching- it is always a spiritual experience. Perhaps the most interesting fact about Osprey are the stories that have inspired their names. The Osprey’s scientific name is Pandion Haliaetus. Pandion comes from the Greek mythology story of a brave Athenian king, descended from the Gods, and his children. Haliaetus comes from the Greek άλιάετος which translates to ‘fishing eagle.’ It is thought the word Osprey is derived from the Norman osprey and Medieval Latin avis prede (bird of prey). Grand stories exist throughout many cultures of a heroic bird that aided captains in braving the toughest storms through guiding them towards calmer seas often depict a bird that looks like the modern day Osprey. They are an ancient bird, born of legends and millions of years old as a species. Their intelligence is sharp, with a consciousness behind their eyes that intrigues all who study them. It’s perhaps why they are one of my favorite raptors.\n\nJR Aurature (@auraturewildlife)\n\nPhotographing osprey is always fun because of their expressive nature. For Long Islanders they are true harbingers of spring as they begin returning to their nesting sites in early/mid March from their wintering grounds in South America. What I admire most about these birds is that they are generally monogamous and typically mate for life. Both male and female play an important role in maintaining their nest from year to year, providing a safe haven for each year's offspring, a consistent diet and each playing an important role in their upbringing."
