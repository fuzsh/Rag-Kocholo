        "text": "In our modern world, finding love has stretched far beyond the bounds of meeting someone face-to-face. Dating apps have opened up a whole new realm of possibilities, connecting hearts across cities, countries, and even continents.\n\nBut, it's not all heart emojis and sweet nothings. Some people, hiding behind screens, aren't looking for love but are on the prowl for something more sinister: victims for their romance scams.\n\nLet's look at the numbers—they're pretty startling. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported that in 2022 alone, a whopping 70,000 Americans fell victim to these deceitful online romances. And the cost? An eye-watering $1.3 billion lost in 2022 to these heartless cyber swindlers. But believe it or not, this is just the tip of the iceberg in the world of online dating scams.\n\nSo, we've put together a list of 25 eye-opening statistics about this shady side of online romance, plus some crucial tips to help you ensure your \"love at first swipe\" is the real deal. Stay safe out there—your heart and your wallet will thank you!\n\nWhat is a romance scam (and what types are there)?\n\nA romance scam, also known as an online dating scam, is when a person gets tricked into believing they’re in a romantic relationship with someone they met online, when in fact their other half is a cybercriminal using a fake identity to gain enough of their trust to ask — or blackmail — them for money.\n\nSome of the most common internet dating scams include:\n\nFake dating sites: Scam dating sites claim to be legitimate but are actually filled with scammers or underpopulated. These websites are created to mine your information.\n\nPhoto scams: Scammers will convince their target to send their personal information in exchange for intimate photos.\n\nMilitary romance scams: The scammer will pose as a military member, likely deployed. They build trust by using military jargon and titles, then ask for money to cover military-related expenses, such as flights home.\n\nIntimate activity scams: The scammer connects with their target on multiple social media websites. Once they become closer, the scammer convinces them to undress and then threatens them with the recordings.\n\nCode verification scams: Scammers will send a fake verification code through email or text, posing to be a dating app or website. Once clicked on, it will ask for their personal information, including Social Security number and credit cards.\n\nInheritance scams: Scammers will make their target believe they need to get married in order to get their inheritance. In this case, they will ask them to help pay for something like airfare.\n\nMalware scams: Malware is also common on dating sites. In this case, the recipient will interact with a scammer who sends them a website that looks legitimate; however, it's a page that includes malware.\n\nSugar daddy scams: In this type of romance scam, a scammer will pose as a wealthy individual looking to send money to a younger person in exchange for online companionship. Once they build your trust, they'll ask for an upfront fee or personal information before sending your allowance.\n\nNow that you know the different types of romance scams circulating on the internet, let’s look at how they work.\n\nHow romance scams work\n\nOftentimes, a romance scammer starts on dating sites or apps. But scammers have increasingly started finding targets on social media, too.\n\nAfter connecting with someone through a fake profile, the scammer will strike up a conversation and start building a relationship by regularly chatting with them. Once they start to trust the romance scammer and believe they have a truthful relationship, the cybercriminal will make up a story, ask them for money, and vanish.\n\nWarning signs: Lies romance scammers tell\n\nHow can you identify a scammer? Well, you probably have a sense of what's considered normal behavior online. But it might be hard to see through an online dating scam when emotions are involved.\n\nIf you want to know how to tell if someone is scamming you online, here are some telltale signs a cybercriminal may be the one sweeping you off your feet.\n\nThey’re far, far away\n\nOne of the first giveaways of a romance scammer is their background. Fakers often pose as someone who is stationed abroad to create a reason for why they can't meet in person. Some common stories include:\n\nThey’re working on an oil rig.\n\nThey’re in the military and/or deployed overseas.\n\nThey’re a doctor in an international organization.\n\nThey’re working on a construction project outside the U.S.\n\nSince their story is so interesting, be sure to keep a close eye on any inconsistencies in it.\n\nTheir profile seems too good to be true\n\nA legitimate dating profile usually has plenty of photos of the person in different situations, with one or two that show the person's whole body, not just part of their face. The individual might also include links to their Instagram or Facebook accounts.\n\nIn contrast, a dating profile might be fake if the person doesn't list any details. Or maybe their interests and hobbies almost exactly match yours — the similarities might be too good to be true.\n\nThe relationship moves fast\n\nOnline dating scam artists want to act fast before their targets catch on to their tactics. For this reason, they like to gain your trust right out of the gate. Some common approaches include:\n\nThey profess their love to you surprisingly quickly.\n\nThey ask you to marry them.\n\nThey make a promise you will see each other.\n\nThey ask to move communications off the dating site — you aren't seeing other people anyway, right?\n\nMany online dating sites offer some safety features, and if you move your conversation to text messages or other chat options, you lose those features. Plus, the person will have your phone number, which could make it harder to cut communication.\n\nIn any event, it’s a good idea to pay attention to your conversations and consider the following red flags:\n\nThe person’s messages look like they could be copy-and-pasted into any conversation.\n\nThe conversation doesn't flow or make sense.\n\nGrammar and spelling are way off.\n\nThey come up with different excuses when asked to video chat.\n\nBut they break promises to visit\n\nRomance scammers want to keep their identities a secret. One way to keep you from questioning their identity is a promise to come visit. They may even have you pay for plane tickets or other travel costs. But they'll cancel at the last minute, providing an elaborate reason for why they can't see you after all.\n\nThey claim they need money\n\nIf your online love interest asks you for money and you haven’t even met them, beware. A romance scammer may ask you to send money for things like:\n\nTravel expenses like a plane ticket or visa.\n\nMedical expenses like surgeries.\n\nGambling debts.\n\nFamily or personal emergencies.\n\nAnd they usually have a sob story to back up their request.\n\nAn alternate money scam to watch for: They may send you money! This could rope you into a \"money mule\" scheme, whereby the scammer asks to deposit money into your bank account, distribute the funds to other people, or deliver packages. These requests could be tied to money laundering.\n\nAnd they ask for specific payment methods\n\nBe cautious if your cyber sweetheart asks you to send them money via:\n\nWire transfer\n\nPreloaded gift cards\n\nA newly established bank account in your name\n\nThese are ways to get cash quickly while remaining anonymous. Plus, the transactions are hard to reverse. Once you send a little bit of money, they might even ask for more. If you say no, their messages may get desperate and aggressive.\n\n10 tips to avoid romance scammers and protect yourself\n\nOnline dating site scams often end with people losing money and, in some cases, even being pulled into criminal activity. Besides the financial costs, there may be emotional costs, too. You may feel heartbroken, depressed, or embarrassed after someone you trusted scammed you.\n\nThat's why it's important to know how to outsmart a romance scammer and how to act fast if you think you’ve been scammed.\n\n1. Be aware of the warning signs\n\nSimply knowing how a romance scammer operates can help you identify and avoid one. Remember some of the red flags and lies online romance scammers tell:\n\nThey’re far, far away.\n\nTheir profile seems too good to be true.\n\nThe relationship moves fast.\n\nThey break promises to visit.\n\nThey claim they need money.\n\nThey ask for specific payment methods.\n\n2. Evaluate your online presence\n\nA few basic cybersecurity best practices can help protect you against internet scams. The more you share, the more dating site scammers know about you — and know how to lure you.\n\nFor this reason, consider keeping your online dating profiles anonymous by using different usernames on sites or even different emails to protect your privacy. Also, be careful what you make public on social media.\n\n3. Approach online relationships slowly\n\nThe internet can be an incredible place for community, developing friendships, and sometimes even relationships. But it’s always important to take these relationships slowly, vet your new companions thoroughly, and be wary if answers don’t add up.\n\n4. Set up a phone or video chat early\n\nSeeing someone’s face can be a surefire way to determine whether they’re real or fake. For this reason, set up a phone or video chat early on in your communications with an online love interest. If they dodge the opportunity, they may be a romance scammer.\n\n5. Don’t send compromising pictures\n\nIt's important to protect yourself online, so never send compromising photos or videos of yourself to someone, especially if you haven’t met them in person. These could be used as blackmail later.\n\n6. Do your own snooping, like a reverse image search\n\nIn the age of social media and online dating, everyone has a digital presence waiting to be viewed. Do your homework on your cyber sweetheart by viewing their social media profiles. If their profile is bare or they have no connections, take it a step further with a reverse image search to see if their photos are on other sites. To do this:\n\nRight click an image of the person.\n\nClick “Copy.”\n\nVisit images.google.com and paste the image.\n\nGoogle will show you the websites where the image appears online. If it shows up on a stock photo site or seems to belong to someone else entirely, then it could be part of a scam.\n\n7. Never pay someone you haven’t met, especially someone online\n\nDon't give out your financial information, top off a cash reload card, or send gifts or money to someone you haven't met face to face. Never wire money to a stranger or pay anyone with gift cards.\n\n8. If they ask you for help, refer them elsewhere\n\nEspecially if your other cyber half is located outside of the U.S., be sure to refer them to a U.S. consulate or embassy if they ask for help or money. It’s a reasonable response, since authorities would be able to provide better help, especially if you just met them.\n\n9. Ask someone you trust for a second opinion\n\nWhen your emotions run deeply with someone, it’s hard to face the reality that they’re not who you think they are. If you ever have an inkling that you’re caught up in an online dating scam, step back and ask a trusted friend or family member to give a second opinion about your relationship. They may see some warning signs of a romance scammer you didn’t.\n\n10. Stop communicating and report the incident\n\nIf you’re suspicious or sure that you’re being scammed, cut off communication immediately and report the activity. Always consider the possibility of it being a scam, even if you contacted them first.\n\nHow to report an online dating scam\n\nIt may be nearly impossible to recover money after you've been scammed. But reporting these incidents helps federal investigators look for commonalities and may help lead them to perpetrators.\n\nFor these reasons, take the following steps if you suspect you’ve been scammed:\n\nContact your bank right away if you’ve sent a romance scammer money.\n\nCollect any records you have of your online relationship, including conversations and transactions.\n\nFile a police report.\n\nReport the incident to:\n\nThe FTC\n\nThe FBI\n\nThe dating site if the scam started there\n\n20+ online dating scam statistics and trends\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that too many people have been part of a love story that never ends happily ever after. Some of the proof is in these online dating scam statistics.\n\nRomance scams on the rise\n\nBoth loneliness and the development of new technologies have contributed to the rise of online romance scams in recent years.\n\nIn the first six months of 2023, half of those who reported financial losses due to online romance scams indicated the fraud started on Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat.
