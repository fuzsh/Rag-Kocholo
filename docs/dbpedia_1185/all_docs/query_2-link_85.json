How many of these modern and classic picture books for children in the early years setting have you read?\n\nChildren learn to read pictures before they read words, and that’s why it’s so important to make use of picture books when reading with the youngest children.

Thanks.\n\nBooks for EYFS – what titles to recommend to children\n\nSelecting books for Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) involves choosing engaging and interactive titles that cater to the developmental needs of young children. Picture books with vibrant illustrations, simple narratives, and opportunities for interaction are ideal. Consider classics like “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” by Eric Carle, which introduces counting and days of the week, or “Dear Zoo” by Rod Campbell, offering a fun exploration of animals. Additionally, books like “Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?” by Bill Martin Jr. and Eric Carle support language development and color recognition. Focus on titles that encourage participation, stimulate curiosity, and lay the foundation for a lifelong love of reading.\n\nWhat does the National Curriculum say about reading in EYFS?\n\nThe National Curriculum emphasises the crucial role of reading in the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), recognising it as a foundational skill for a child’s overall development. The curriculum highlights the importance of creating a rich literacy environment that fosters a love for reading. In EYFS, children are encouraged to listen actively, engage with a variety of stories, rhymes, and poems, and develop early phonics awareness. The focus is on building language skills, comprehension, and communication through enjoyable and interactive reading experiences. The National Curriculum encourages educators to choose diverse and inclusive literature, ensuring that children are exposed to a broad range of cultures and perspectives from an early age. The goal is to lay a strong foundation for literacy skills that will support children’s learning across all subjects as they progress through their education.\n\nHow to read picture books with children aged 5 and under\n\nReading picture books with children aged 5 and under involves creating a captivating and interactive experience that nurtures their early literacy skills. Start by engaging them in a conversation about the book’s cover, title, and illustrations. Encourage them to predict what the story might be about. During the reading, use expressive voices, varying tones, and animated facial expressions to bring characters and events to life. Pause occasionally to ask open-ended questions, encouraging them to share their thoughts and make connections to their own experiences. Explore the illustrations together, pointing out details and asking them to describe what they see. After reading, discuss the story, characters, and their favourite parts. Foster a love for reading by making it a special time together, reinforcing positive associations with books and storytelling.\n\nFor more picture books for preschool and EYFS children, see our list of Books for Bedtime.\n\nFor more advanced books for your child, why not try our books for KS1 lists?"
