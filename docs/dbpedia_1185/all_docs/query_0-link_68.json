        "text": "FAIRLEA- In this edition of the State Fair Concert Series, we will look at the Turnpike Troubadours.\n\nWHO ARE THE TURNPIKE TROUBADOURS?\n\nHailing from Talequah, Oklahoma and playing true, folksy country music are the Turnpike Troubadours. In 2007, they created their own imprint, Bossier City Records, and since that time have released six studio albums.\n\nThey appeal to a diverse group of fans and focus their lyrics mostly on rural American living. Their first album, ‘Bossier City’ was released in 2007 and their sophomore album, ‘Diamonds and Gasoline, came five years later in 2010.\n\nIt was another five years, in 2015, when they released their self-titled album. Their hits ‘Easton and Main’ and ‘Bossier City’ were re-recorded for that record and were successful once again.\n\nIn 2017, their fourth album, ‘A Long Way from Your Heart, came out and peaked at no. 3 on the Country Billboard Chart. The band went through some rough times in 2018 when band member Evan Felker appeared intoxicated at some of TT’s shows in late 2018. They immediately cancelled their next 12 shows following the bad string of performances and it continued off and on until the next year and put the band’s future in serious jeopardy.\n\nHowever, in November of 2021, the band made a positive post on their social media page that read “Coming Soon 2022” and in April of that year, they began performing live again and Felker has since found his sobriety making the Turnpike Troubadours a comeback success story.\n\nWHY SHOULD YOU\n\nBUY TICKETS?\n\nThe Turnpike Troubadours relate to a lot of everyday people kind of like their State Fair performing counterpart Oliver Anthony. They play an old school style with some folk music and Cajun tunes mixed in. They are known to put on a great show especially since they have been back on tour and Felker has been healthy and thriving. Their fair show will undoubtedly be a memorable one.\n\nThey will hit the stage on opening night of the fair, Thursday, Aug. 8 and the Band of Heathens will open for them."
