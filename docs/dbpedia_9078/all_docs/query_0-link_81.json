        "text": "It‚Äôs Back-to-School season y‚Äôall! Whew Chile! It‚Äôs been over a decade since I‚Äôve been a student and I have learned and am still learning a LOT in life! In 2009, I graduated from a small private predominately white high school and in 2013 I graduated from a historically black college, Fort Valley State University. These two totally ‚Äúdifferent worlds‚Äù and school experiences have shaped who I am and who I am becoming. I wanted to share my knowledge of being a former student leader for freshman year students. Listen or watch the podcast below and check out the list of advice below. Do you have any advice you‚Äôd give a new college student?\n\nADVICE FOR FRESHMAN YEAR:\n\n1. Establish rules and communicate early on with your roommate(s). Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt have to be best friends, but you live together now so respect people‚Äôs things and have boundaries.\n\n2. Please be yourself and talk to people you don‚Äôt already know.\n\n3. If you‚Äôre feeling down and need someone to talk to go seek out your university‚Äôs infirmary and seek free counseling if available.\n\n4. I know it‚Äôs a new environment, but try not to go home every weekend and try not to stay in your dorm all day.\n\n5. If you have a car make sure to get a parking decal asap!\n\n6. If you have a car make sure you‚Äôre not being used by others who won‚Äôt even give you gas money or say thank you for giving them a ride.\n\n7. There‚Äôs pros and cons to everything. In my opinion if you‚Äôre not a morning person don‚Äôt take an 8 A.M. class or maybe you are a morning person, so take the class and get it over with and have the rest of the day to yourself.\n\n8. Check out websites like Chegg and Google other book rental sites before going to the bookstore.\n\n9. When dealing with advisors, professors, financial aid, etc. make a copy of everything they give you. Keep your receipts and emails!\n\n10. Figure out what campus activities or clubs fit your personality.\n\n11. If you are interested in a historically black fraternity or sorority do not tell everybody. Focus on your grades and community service.\n\n12. Be careful about what you post on social media. There is life after college and future employers look at that.\n\n13. If you have an online class or have to upload an assignment online upload it early because sometimes depending on where you are or what time of day it is the WiFi won‚Äôt be as strong.\n\n14. If you don‚Äôt understand something or need extra help seek out a tutor and go to your professor during their office hours to ask questions or get clarity on something you didn‚Äôt understand during the lecture.\n\n15. Try to call or text your parent(s) at least once every few weeks and not only when you need or want something.\n\n16. Focus on your required classes before permanently choosing a major. So if you choose to change majors you won‚Äôt lose so many credits.\n\n17. Talk to your academic advisor. This person is vital in helping you know what classes you need to take in order to graduate on time.\n\n18. Go to class and try your best to sit up front and take notes.\n\n19. Get a part time job. It‚Äôs nice to have money in your pockets and good to have work experience.\n\n20. Take advantage of free things your campus may offer.\n\n21. Invest in a good umbrella and get some rain boots because when it rains on campus at FVSU it poured down!\n\n22. I know the cafeteria has various food options, but try to eat healthy when you can. Don‚Äôt forget to try to get at least 6 to 8 hours of sleep a night.\n\n23. Get involved in the community and city your college is in.\n\n24. Go to the library and study there.\n\n25. Study Hard, but Play Hard. Enjoy your college years and cherish the moments!\n\nüïäÔ∏èAaliyah Dana Haughton 1/16/1979‚Äì8/25/2001\n\nI often think about where triple threat singer, dancer, and actress, Aaliyah would be in 2024 if she were still alive. Even though it‚Äôs been twenty three years since her death and final album she is still so relevant. There‚Äôs no doubt about it that Aaliyah had a major impact on millennials and her legacy for us ‚Äô80‚Äôs and ‚Äô90‚Äôs babies is unforgettable. From her signature sleek and straight hair and swoop, shades, leather outfits, ombre hair, makeup, music videos and Tommy Hilfiger outfits, to her dancing and acting she was a standout and admired star whose influence can even be seen in various Pop and R&B artists today. Everyone from Normani, Tink, Drake, Jeezy, and Chris Brown have sampled her.\n\nBack on July 7, 2001, I was just 10-years-old and excited about Aaliyah‚Äôs self-titled third album dropping. I use to watch 106 & Park with hosts Free and AJ on BET faithfully as a young tween and Aaliyah was on the show promoting her album. I also remember MTV had a show called ‚ÄúDiary‚Äù where they would go behind-the-scenes with certain artists and I couldn‚Äôt wait for Aaliyah‚Äôs episode to air.\n\nThe 106 & Park Aaliyah Interview is available to watch here)\n\nThe MTV Diary episode is currently available to watch here)\n\nAnyway, I really wanted Aaliyah‚Äôs CD, but I remember my mom said that it was ‚Äútoo grown‚Äù for me to get. Little did we know it would be her final album and she would pass weeks later in a tragic plane crash in the Bahamas after filming the music video for the sensual single ‚ÄúRock the Boat.‚Äù\n\nI remember MTV News and the radio announced that the singer passed and I just couldn‚Äôt believe it. I was so hurt about the death of someone I had never even met. My Dad eventually purchased the CD for me and said it was a classic and would be a collectible and he was right. It took years, but Aaliyah‚Äôs musical catalog is now available on streaming sites. I‚Äôm not sure of the all the legalities or exact reasons why Blackground Records and Aaliyah‚Äôs Estate have issues when it comes to royalties etc., but at least younger and older generations can now listen and have access to her music.\n\nI was re-listening to Aaliyah‚Äôs self-titled album through my 2024 adult ears and it just resonated and hit different! There are so many tracks in her musical catalog that could‚Äôve been singles and sound like they came out recently instead of years ago. The self-titled genre bending album combined, Rock on tracks like ‚ÄúI Can Be‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat If‚Äù, Flamenco on songs like ‚ÄúRead Between The Lines‚Äù, Pop, R&B, and Hip-Hop, with lead singles ‚ÄúWe Need a Resolution‚Äù and ‚ÄúMore Than A Woman‚Äù, and spoke of a young woman in her early 20‚Äôs singing about pleasure ‚ÄúRock The Boat‚Äù, pain and abuse ‚ÄúNever No More‚Äù and ‚ÄúI Refuse‚Äù, relationships and life lessons and love on ‚ÄúThose Were The Days‚Äù, ‚ÄúExtra Smooth‚Äù, ‚ÄúU Got Nerve‚Äù, ‚ÄúI Care 4 U‚Äùand ‚ÄúTry Again‚Äù. That album template is now the norm, but was ground-breaking for a 20-something young woman in 2001 to combine different moods and genres. One line that always stuck out to me was the lyric ‚ÄúSpeak your heart don‚Äôt bite your tongue. Don‚Äôt get it twisted. Don‚Äôt misuse it.‚Äù- Aaliyah ‚ÄúWe Need a Resolution‚Äù feat. Timbaland. I feel like every track and lyric had a purpose or mood that was fitting.\n\nOne underrated track in my opinion was the electronic and futuristic sounding ‚ÄúLOOSE RAP‚Äù, which is the second track on Aaliyah‚Äôs self-titled album. Produced by Key Beats and written by the late Stephen ‚ÄúStatic Major‚Äù Garrett, who also penned other songs in Aaliyah‚Äôs musical catalog, is a fusion of experimental synthesized beats, ad-libs, and echoes. ‚ÄúWe got something for all the fools it ain‚Äôt just rhythm and blues.‚Äù Aaliyah declared that her musical sound and image were not just limited to an R&B music box that speaks of her unique sound, image, and artistry.\n\nBack in 2001, Aaliyah was not only singing and dancing, but she started to branch out into different musical genres on her third album and acted in films such as ‚ÄúQueen of the Damned‚Äù and ‚ÄúRomeo Must Die.‚Äù Aaliyah and Static Major may have passed on, but their presence left a mark and the duo sure didn‚Äôt lose our attention in loose rap. Throughout the song Static Major and Aaliyah declare their annoyance, confidence, and competitive nature in various aspects of life, love, and the music and entertainment industry.\n\nIn the introduction, Aaliyah‚Äôs voice echoes ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick and tired of the loose rap‚Äù while Static Major states, ‚ÄùFor the ‚Äô01 I know you can come better come better than that so you can kill all your loose rap.‚Äù On the Aaliyah: Behind the Scenes segment on the posthumous album and DVD ‚ÄúI Care 4 U‚Äù Aaliyah said that her name is Arabic ‚Äúmeaning the highest most exalted one.. the best and I really wanted that name to carry the project.‚Äù From the origins of her name to the album‚Äôs title, and the third verse on ‚Äúloose rap‚Äù: ‚ÄùIf you just quit trying to compete, yeah, No telling what you could be, might even be doper than me‚Ä¶I doubt it.‚Äù Aaliyah addresses her adversaries and exudes a confidence and self-assuredness, talent, and an incomparable uniqueness to the point where her influence and impact are still present in music and fashion decades later.\n\nAdditionally, on the posthumous album and DVD ‚ÄúI Care 4 U‚Äù there is an ‚ÄúAaliyah: Behind the Scenes‚Äù segment where Aaliyah gives her opinion on certain tracks off her third album. In regards to this particular song she stated, ‚ÄúI love it so much because if you listen to it this is how I listen to it how I take this song it tells three different stories and it‚Äôs just really about people come up to you with a whole lotta smack and weak rap and it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt wanna hear any of your loose rap.‚Äù The first verse whether it be a guy or girl being a little bit jealous of you and you saying I know what you talk smack behind my back but I don‚Äôt care because I know you‚Äôre just speaking ‚Äúloose rap.‚Äù The second verse is about a guy coming to me kickin‚Äô game tryna be my guy and I‚Äôm like your game is a lil‚Äô weak, but I might give you a chance even though you‚Äôre kicking loose rap, and the third verse speaks about my crew, Tim and everybody all of us and the music we make our creativity and people being a little bit jealous of that and really trying not to feel it but it‚Äôs okay because everything you say is just loose rap so it tells 3 different stories and I think it‚Äôs really just hot.‚Äù The song is one of those tracks that isn‚Äôt wrapped up in yesteryear. Twenty-one years later this song and the rest of the album still sounds current and wrapped and layered with synths that can ride the waves of time.\n\nClick here to listen Back in May of 2022, I spent almost two weeks in Israel, Jordan, and Egypt. It was a spiritual and emotional awakening and a breath of fresh air for me. Seeing The Middle East and North Africa for myself has been amazing. The pandemic and life itself have been a LOT to deal with, so this trip has been a reset. I have traveled overseas before years ago while I was in college I studied abroad in various Italian cities and have vacationed in London, England, Paris, France, and Athens and Santorini, Greece. Yet, this trip just feels different to my soul and was my first international trip since 2016! Also, my mother traveled back in the 80‚Äôs to Israel and other places and my maternal grandmother traveled years ago to the Holy Land too, so it‚Äôs in my blood to explore!\n\nI went by myself with the Go-Ahead travel group,(click the underlined link for more info.) which consists of various cultures and types of people from across the U.S.A. The tour company also has payment plans and take care of everything like flights, tours, local tour guides and translators, security,and transportation for you and was worth it to me! I was also happy I went with a travel group and not alone because it was a LOT of pick pocketers and people that prey on tourists, so I am grateful for the local tour guides and the security we had on the charter bus in The Middle East/North Africa. Also, to see the touristy sites be prepared to wake up early or go earlier in the day when it‚Äôs cooler and less crowds or research the better time of year to go. This is a major factor for a religious region with different holidays. Seeing places that I‚Äôve only read about in The Bible or National Geographic or heard about from Westernized media has been very eye opening. My heart goes out to the people in the area who have been at war for decades.\n\nTraveling and learning more about the three Abrahamic Religions‚úùÔ∏è‚ò™Ô∏èüîØ(Christianity, Islam, and Judaism) and this Holy Land for myself has expanded my mindset on religion and spirituality and politics. The people in Jordan were so kind, yet very curious about me and some Jordanian teens and small children came up to me out of curiosity and intrigue wanting to take pictures and interact with a darker skinned Black American like me.\n\nI felt like a celebrity or something with all the stares in Amman and Aqaba, Jordan. The culture here in the Middle East & North Africa is different. Not as many people were looking down at devices all day as much and actually talk to one another or make do with so much less and women dress much more conservatively in beautiful fabrics and coverings (hijabs)and have beautiful eye brows and makeup. Some of the Jewish men in Israel wear yamakas on their head. There is internet-WiFi at the hotels I stayed in, but not many English speaking options to watch and very censored and dubbed media outlets. In Israel the people primarily speak Hebrew, English, and other languages. In Jordan and Egypt, the people primarily speak Arabic and English and other languages too. So far the top highlights so far of my trip have been in Israel floating in The Dead Sea with no swimming or floating device!\n\nI can swim and love the water, but The Dead Sea is so salty and the pull of gravity below sea level literally makes you float on your back and the sea salt water and oil makes your skin feel like you have been at the spa! So cool! Then riding on camels in the Wadi Rum desert in Jordan was amazing. The scenery literally looks like a screen saver or movie set, but this is nature! This is real life! I had to pinch myself and after taking so many pictures put my phone up and just absorb the environment. I am in amazement with the people of the Bedouin tribe with NO GPS and being in the middle of the desert with no lights etc. they navigate the land by camels and star gazing and looking at the mountains.\n\nReminiscent of the wisemen in The Bible Story of the Nativity of men following the stars to find Jesus, Mary, and Joseph to give them gold, franksense, and mur. Also, the camel‚Äôs hide feels like soft carpet! As a believer of Jesus seeing the places in Jerusalem and Bethlehem and going to the places where Jesus walked and performed miracles was chillingly moving. Going to the Western/Wailing Wall to say a prayer and put a prayer in the wall in Israel was powerful and going to the Garden of Gathsemene where Jesus prayed the night before he was crucified gave me chills.\n\nI was also in awe seeing the pyramids and sphinx in Giza, Egypt and The Nile River and I immediately thought of Moses and the book of Exodus in the Bible and the film ‚ÄúThe Prince of Egypt.‚Äù\n\nThe ancient ruins and wonders of the world have stood the test of time! I also thought of Michael Jackson‚Äôs Egyptian themed ‚ÄúRemember the Time‚Äù music videos. Also, it was eye opening going to the Holocaust Museum and memorial in Israel. It was heart breaking seeing the remnants of such evil. Out of respect I did not take pictures inside of the Holocaust Museum.\n\nIt was also interesting and so beautiful looking at the ancient places, architecture, and ancient ruins in Jarash, Jordan or Al-Khazneh (the treasury) in Petra, Jorda, which was also featured in ‚ÄúThe Indiana Jones‚Äù Movie series and have stood the test of time. Also seeing the Upper Room where Jesus and his disciples ate At The Last Supper and where King David was buried in was intriguing too.\n\nGoing through the border control to leave Israel and enter Jordan and seeing the walls that divide the Holy lands and the political, religious, and repercussions it has on the people in the area were eye-opening. In Israel, young men and young women must join the military at 18 and it was interesting seeing them patrol the streets and holy sites with rifles. Whereas in Jordan and Egypt I didn‚Äôt see as many weapons just a greater police presence. My heart goes out to both Palestine and Israel and the people in the regions who have been at war for decades fighting over Holy Land. Israel, Jordan, and Egypt there really aren‚Äôt a lot of pork food options due to the religious aspects of the area.\n\nHowever the grilled lamb, fish, chicken, hummus, pita bread, potatoes, rice, fruit, and vegetables were so fresh and good and people drink lots of hot tea. I don‚Äôt think there are the same preservatives there are in the food as in the USA.\n\nAlso, the time change is about 6-7hours difference. So when it‚Äôs afternoon or evening here it‚Äôs early morning or middle of the day or night back home in the USA. Soccer and Basketball are major international sports so it was cool seeing people enjoy that. There is so much more I can say, but overall this has been a trip of a lifetime. I will forever cherish these moments. Thank you, God!\n\nI moved away from my hometown in Columbus, Georgia for a job in South Carolina back in August of 2019. Then BOOM THE PANDEMIC! If you would have told me that a global pandemic would happen and that by the end of 2020 I would actually be back in my hometown due to the office closing due to remote work and then becoming a caregiver for my Dad I probably would not have believed ya!\n\nThere is nothing like having an opportunity, getting out of your comfort zone, and moving to a different city with No close friends or family there. Whew Chile! It‚Äôs been an emotional journey. These past 4 years have shown me how to stop relying on myself so much and to rely on God more, and trust His plan and not my own.\n\nStarting a new job position in the middle of August 2019 and having to quickly find a nice affordable apartment in a more expensive city AND moving all within a two-week time span, to meeting new people, making new friends, and adjusting to life in a new city and state, then moving back has been a lot. On top of all this back in October of 2019 I was in a car accident that totaled my car. I was fortunate enough to walk away without any physical trauma, and I was able to quickly get another vehicle. Praise God!\n\nI feel like I‚Äôve gotten a little bit closer to God and am becoming an even stronger person that is blossoming into more.\n\nSometimes it takes going elsewhere to really see what you‚Äôre capable of. It makes you more appreciative of certain things that ‚Äúhome‚Äù offers like never having to use a GPS device or always having somebody nearby if an emergency happens and oddly you see who really is your ‚Äúfriend‚Äù when you are away in a different phase of life. I also see how certain people are your friends for reasons, seasons, and life times.\n\nThank God for technology like text messages and video chat apps like iPhone‚Äôs FaceTime and the ‚Äúold school‚Äù phone call. Sometimes living in a different city is a fresh start for better and more opportunities and a new chapter in the book of life for lots of people. I‚Äôve never been afraid to explore or go on adventures, but it‚Äôs a difference between visiting a place for a short time for a vacation versus living there.\n\nSome already have their groups and cliques in smaller cities and if you‚Äôre new or have a different mindset or life it can be a challenge to fit. Some take the cost of living or having a village for granted though. Having a network of people or connections are vital, especially in smaller cities where its more so who you know and not what you know.\n\nYears ago I went to college in-state at Fort Valley State University, which is only an hour away from my hometown. While I was a senior in college I studied abroad through a scholarship award in various Italian cities. After graduating from undergrad I‚Äôve traveled to different U.S. cities and European cities and not speak the language, but to up and leave everything I know to go elsewhere has been exciting, scary, lonely, and fulfilling all at once. Living in a smaller city like Columbus, GA all my life things were in my comfort zone.\n\nI am NOT bashing my hometown or the people there because it‚Äôs helped in shaping who I am and who I am becoming, but consider that sometimes certain cities lack certain industries or scenes for people of certain age brackets, and more or better opportunities for better salaries or different mindsets exist elsewhere.\n\nOf course, if all you do is go home and to work and never do any activities outside of that or try to go places or participate in things or make the place better or do things that interest you then ANY city you‚Äôre in will be boring or easy to complain about.\n\nThere are pros and cons to anything in life, and so many creative, talented, smart individuals from smaller cities and towns leave because they may feel limited or want better for themselves or maybe they‚Äôre tired of running into the same people they had middle school math with at the grocery store or the same people or cliques running things and doing the same things all the time.\n\nYou get my drift. Overall moving was beneficial for me and I would recommend anyone whoever has a good opportunity to go! I know it‚Äôs scary, but life is so much bigger than your town and you can always visit or even move back like I did.\n\nSo many people live in regret, but you only get one life. Never forget or be ashamed of where you come from and as The Notorious B.I.G. said: ‚ÄúStay far from timid, only make moves when your heart‚Äôs in it and live the phrase sky‚Äôs the limit.‚Äù"
