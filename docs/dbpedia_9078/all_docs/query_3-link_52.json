        "text": "Age/Sex/Location Tour kicks off Jan 26th\n\nFollowing the release of her highly anticipated sophomore album, Age/Sex/Location, Grammy nominated, and Platinum recording artist Ari Lennox announces her Age/Sex/Location Tour 2023. Produced by Live Nation, the 27-city tour kicks off on January 26th at House of Blues in Las Vegas making stops across the US in Los Angeles, Houston, Atlanta and more before wrapping up in her hometown at Howard Theatre in Washington, DC on March 28th.\n\nPresales are underway with the general on sale starting Friday, November 18th at 10 am local via Ticketmaster.\n\nThe heiress to the raw and real giants of soul music, Ari Lennox is here to stay. The DC-born singer-songwriter catapulted to success in 2019 through her debut album, Shea Butter Baby. The project, now with over 1.3 billion global streams, spawned major hits, including the RIAA Platinum-certified title track, featuring Dreamville label head and marquee artist, J. Cole, the fan-favorite, gold-certified singles “BMO” and “Whipped Cream,” and “Up Late.” The album also reached certified gold status with the RIAA. Awards recognition capped off the debut era, with nominations at the Grammys for her contribution on Dreamville’s album, Revenge of the Dreamers III, three 2019 Soul Train Awards, and two 2020 NAACP Awards.\n\nIn 2021, she introduced her second chapter with the R&B throwback, “Pressure,” produced by legendary hitmakers Jermaine Dupri, Bryan Michael Cox and Johnta Austin. It generated the best results of Lennox’s career yet, becoming her first solo Billboard Hot 100 hit and dominating radio airwaves – flying to No. 1 on the magazine’s Adult R&B Airplay chart and No. 2 overall at R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay – all while racking up over 128 million global streams.\n\nFollowing the torrid release of her RIAA-certified gold record “Pressure,” Lennox released her slow-burning single “Hoodie,” alongside Isaiah Rashad — who made a cameo in the latest video release. “Hoodie” along with “POF” received visual treatments and reside on her critically-acclaimed sophomore album Age/Sex/Location. The album has entered the best album of 2022 conversation, courtesy of Lennox’s brilliance and unbridled passion to bring soul back into the forefront of music.\n\nAri Lennox Age/Sex/Location 2023 Tour Dates:"
