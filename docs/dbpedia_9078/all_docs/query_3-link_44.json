        "text": "Jonn Hart has been shaking things up with his track \"Who Booty,\" which has been hitting airwaves throughout the country. Mr. Hart talks about having a new brand of \"R&Bay,\" a fusion of R&B influences and the influences of his hometown, The Bay (San Francisco). Singersroom had the opportunity to sit down and talk about what makes this new R&B artist tick.\n\nBuilding That Buzz … I have been doing a lot of promo shows and interviews. I have shows like every week. I am also working on my mixtape.\n\nCrushing On You … I am single. I actually have a show for Valentine’s Day. But I like a woman that takes care of herself. I like when woman take care of their hair … it could be long or short. She doesn’t have to be drop dead gorgeous. I like when a female has her own swag and is doing her own thing. I like her to be independent. I been grinding and I want someone that has her grind and hustle going also. It could be doing whatever, once she is doing it to the fullest. She has to be cool. I like chicks that don’t complain all the time and just go with the flow. It has to be someone who is willing to try new and different things. I had a crush on Kim Kardashian, but Kanye got her pregnant now. I used to love Beyonce, but Jay-Z wifed her up. Rihanna too but she’s back with Chris Brown. I still do like Christina Milian. She’s bad!\n\nFor The People … I bring a fan up every time I’m on stage. My performances are very interactive on stage. I look to bring out that energy. I bring two background dancers and I have a hype man that gets the crowd excited. Its all about having a good time on stage and making sure the people enjoy themselves. I also will do something acapella at the end of the show.\n\nCool Gentleman That Can Listen … I’m a real laid back person and I’m not too hard to get along with. People always say that I'm real cool. I also am a great listener so when someone has a bad day they usual talk to me. I think that I’m easy to get along with. I’m a gentleman at a time when men don’t do those extra things for the ladies especially these days. I'll open the door for you and pull out your chair. Cats out here are worrying about not tricking on females. I take my girl to eat. I treat her how I want to be treated. I do what I do behind closed doors. LOL I like to have fun too … traveling and doing somethings you never thought of.\n\nDairy of An Ex-Girlfriend … My ex-girlfriends might say I can get a little stubborn especially if it’s something that I believe in and I'm passionate about. They would also say I always think I’m right.\n\nThings I Don't Like … I do not like brats, my ex-girlfriend always wanted things her way.\n\nR&Bay … I like to say I been using the term hybrid when it comes to explaining my sound. I'm a R&B dude at heart, but I'm not one of those singers that just will sing ballads. I don’t like doing the old school Jodeci runs, but at the same time I'm not a rapper. \"Who Booty\" has that hard hitting 808 beat and that is something you will find on a rappers song. I came on top of that beat with melodic vocals. That is my sound heavy beats with my melodies I call it R&Bay. I feel like my sound is something new.\n\nIn My Ipod … I listen to 2 Chainz, Big Sean, Trey Songz and Miguel. Miguel has been killing it. Meek Mill and the whole MMG has been doing their thing also. I listen to all genres from Hip Hop, R&B, Pop, Rock and Country … everything. I don’t wear cowboy hats, but I do enjoy country music like Taylor Swift and Carey Underwood. Taylor Swift is a dope writer.\n\nMaking A Singer … The first time I stepped in a booth at my step dad's studio I realized I wanted to be a singer. I been doing it for seven years. My younger brother had a triton and I jumped on the microphone. But the minute I stepped into that booth that is when I realized singing was for me. Ever since then I've been doing it and I've been chasing that feeling … I been chasing that high ever since. If I couldn’t do music, I would still be chasing it. There is nothing else I would want to do. This is it!\n\nHard times … I wouldn’t want to fast forward anything in my life. Each part of my life I want to cherish. I think a hard time for me was when my parents got divorced. It probably has had deep psychological effects on my relationships. It makes me think of marriage differently. It changes the dynamic of your relationships.\n\nFavorites\n\nInstrument – Drums … percussion.\n\nPast time – basketball and football\n\nFootball – 49ers I’m from the Bay. I’m a Bay area fan.\n\nMovie – Action; Dramas I like everything.\n\nDance – Bumping and Grinding & the Dougie\n\nCandy – Snickers\n\nSneakers – Jordan retros 11's\n\nRestaurant – Crustashons in San Francisco and LA"
