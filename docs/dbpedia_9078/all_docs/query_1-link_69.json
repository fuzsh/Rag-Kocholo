        "meta_description": "\"Everytime tha Beat Drop\" is a song by American recording artist Monica from her fifth studio album The Makings of Me (2006). It was written by Johnta Austin, Jermaine Dupri, Robert Hill, Charles Hammond, Deangelo Hunt, James Phillips, and rap group Dem Franchize Boyz, while production was hemled by Dupri, with additional credits by LRoc. Musically, the downbeat uptempo track was greatly influenced by crunk and snap music, incorporating beats of rapper Nelly's 2005 song \"Grillz\" and containing a vocal sample of Dem Franchize Boyz' \"Lean wit It, Rock wit It\" (2006).",
