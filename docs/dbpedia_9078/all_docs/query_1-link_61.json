It was written by Johnta Austin, Jermaine Dupri, Robert Hill, Charles Hammond, Deangelo Hunt, James Phillips, and rap group Dem Franchize Boyz, while production was hemled by Dupri, with additional credits by LRoc. Musically, the downbeat uptempo track was greatly influenced by crunk and snap music, incorporating beats of rapper Nelly's 2005 song \"Grillz\" and containing a vocal sample of Dem Franchize Boyz' \"Lean wit It, Rock wit It\" (2006). A lyrical and musical departure from Monica's previous singles, \"Everytime tha Beat Drop\" was released as the album's leading single in the United States in July 2006, gaining generally mixed to negative reviews by music critics who called it \"untypical\" and \"avoidable.\" A moderate success on the charts, it became Monica's tenth top twenty entry on Billboards Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, but failed to reach the top forty on the official Hot 100, becoming her least successful lead single since 2002's \"All Eyez on Me.\" \"Everytime tha Beat Drop\" was performed along with Dem Franchize Boyz on several television, such as The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Late Show with David Letterman, MTV's Total Request Live, and BET's 106 & Park. An accompanying music video for the song, directed by Ray Kay, was filmed in Monica's hometown Atlanta, Georgia. The singer later voiced her remorse towards her record company bosses for subsequently deciding to release \"Everytime the Beat Drops\" as a single, wishing for a more typical record to be released as the first single instead, and dismissed the song as a wrong interpretation of her artistical status. \"Everytime tha Beat Drop\" was written by Johnta Austin, producer Jermaine Dupri, and rap group Dem Franchize Boyz members Maurice \"Parlae\" Gleaton, Jamal \"Pimpin'\" Willingham, Bernard \"Jizzal Man\" Leverette, and Gerald \"Buddie\" Tiller."
