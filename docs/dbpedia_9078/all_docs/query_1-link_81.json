        "text": "New Monica music is officially on the way! Over the weekend, the R&B singer alluded to releasing either new music or a new album. Monica shared a jail themed photo. Wearing an orange jump suit, she posing for her mugshot, staring directly at the camera. She captioned the post,\n\nRelease 4-15\n\nMonica’s most recent album, Code Red, was released in 2015, by RCA Records and coincided with the twentieth release anniversary of her debut album Miss Thang (1995). For the project, Monica reteamed with her cousin Polow da Don, who had co-executive produced her previous album New Life (2012). The pair enlisted a variation of producers and songwriters to work with her, including Danja, DJ HardWork, Fatboi, Keyzbaby, Pop & Oak, and Timbaland – in addition to longtime collaborators such as performers Missy Elliott and Akon, and songwriters Crystal Nicole and Johntá Austin.\n\nThe music news comes amidst reports that the 38-year-old singer and her 33-year-old husband Shannon Brown were divorcing. Monica reportedly filed for divorce last month in her hometown of Atlanta. The former couple got married back in 2010 and share one child together, 5-year-old Laiyah, while Monica has two sons from her prior relationship with rapper Rocko.\n\nRumors have been swirling for months that the were separated, but Monica shut the speculation down—although some fans noticed that she stopped wearing her wedding ring in photos on her Instagram page.\n\nJust before the news, Brown posted a few cryptic messages that seemed to possibly reference the split. In one of them, he gets quite specific about what might be going on. The message read:\n\n“God won’t allow you to go thru what you can’t come out of. As a matter of fact He the one who is putting you thru it. Pay attention while you’re going thru tho. The people that are around you will show you who they really are and what they really all about. Then it’s up to you to act and move accordingly. You also gotta figure out what part you’ve played in the f**kery. Don’t lie to yourself, protect yourself at all times and don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself and fight back. #WarReady #FreeGame”\n\nThe other message is a little more vague, but still alludes to some issues:\n\n“Once you find that peaceful place it’s up to you to protect it at all cost. Don’t allow yourself to get out of character and misplaced. #PEACEFULLYWARREADY”\n\nYou may remember that Monica and Shannon’s marriage was plagued with infidelity rumors in the past. Back in 2016, rumors were running rampant that Brown was cheating on Monica with multiple women, however they seemed to work through it at the time and remained together.\n\nReportedly, the divorce documents are unsealed, meaning that details about child support and/or spousal support are likely to be revealed at some point."
