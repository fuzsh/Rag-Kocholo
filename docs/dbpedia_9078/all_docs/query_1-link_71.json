        "text": "Dreamville-backed emcee JID recruited some big names for his The Forever Story. The album’s tracklist features a mixture of Hip Hop legends and contemporary performers.\n\nYasiin Bey (formerly known as Mos Def) will appear on JID’s “Stars” track along with the Canadian band BadBadNotGood. Young Money’s Lil Wayne and Atlanta rapper Kenny Mason show up on “Just in Time.”\n\nFellow Dreamville acts EarthGang (“Can’t Punk Me”) and Ari Lennox (“Can’t Make U Change”) have features on The Forever Story as well. JID also called on his cousin, Johnta Austin, for the “Better Days” song.\n\nThe 32-year-old former Hampton University student further highlights his hometown of Atlanta by putting 21 Savage and Baby Tate together on “Surround Sound.” Chicago’s Lil Durk contributes to “Bruddanem.”\n\nJID shared the official visualizer for “2007” on YouTube. He reportedly planned to use the song as the closer for The Forever Story before releasing it as a loosie. “2007” followed the “Dance Now” music video which landed on August 9.\n\nChristo executive produced JID’s The Forever Story. The studio LP drops on Friday, August 26 via Dreamville Records/Interscope Records. Previously, JID released The Never Story in 2017 and DiCaprio 2 in 2018.\n\nPlus, his catalog contains several projects by Spillage Village, the music collective also made up of EarthGang, 6lack, and others. Earlier this year, JID scored the biggest Hot 100 hit of his career when “Enemy” with Imagine Dragons peaked at #5.\n\nJID’s The Forever Story Tracklist:"
