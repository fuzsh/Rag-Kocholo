The album was certified gold in the United States in October 2007. Retitled Wait for You, the album was released in Japan in May 2008 and certified gold in that country in September 2008.\n\nYamin also released two Christmas collections: Sounds of the Season: The Elliott Yamin Holiday Collection in October 2007 and My Kind of Holiday in October 2008.\n\nYamin's second album, titled Fight for Love, was released on May 5, 2009. The album's first single, \"Fight for Love\", premiered on AOL Music on February 13, 2009.\n\nHis third album, Gather 'Round was released in Japan in 2011.

Previous to the album release, a video for the single \"Katy\" was released on late October 2015. Yamin travelled to Japan to promote the album in early November.\n\nBiography[]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nYamin was born in Los Angeles, California, to father Shaul Yamin, an Israeli Jew of Iraqi Jewish descent, and mother Claudette Goldberg Yamin (d. March 31, 2008, age 65), a Jewish American of Ashkenazi descent and former professional singer known for her \"fiery spirit\" and for receiving the \"Golden Idol for Proudest Family Moment Award\" from Ryan Seacrest during her son's American Idol competition. His family relocated to Richmond, Virginiawhen Yamin was 11, and his parents divorced when he was 14, his father returning to Los Angeles. Yamin went to school in Richmond at Tuckahoe Middle School, and later, Douglas S. Freeman High School. Dropping out of high school in his sophomore year, he later achieved a high school GED while working at Foot Locker (in their management program), a pharmacy, and as an on-air disc jockey for local R&B radio station WCDX/Power 92 FM, using the name E-Dub before auditioning for American Idol. Yamin has an older half-sister on his mother's side, Jodi Queen, a married mother of two children and a younger brother, Scott Yamin, in pharmacy school at Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina.\n\nA history of ear infections as a child and eardrum replacement surgery at 13 left Yamin with 90% hearing loss in his right ear. He was diagnosed with Type I diabetes at the age of 16 and wears an insulin pump to help him manage his diabetes. Yamin is 5'6\" tall.\n\nYamin first discovered his vocal talent while singing karaoke in his late teens. Although he had not been musically trained, he sang in a local jazz band and in amateur performance forums emulating Stevie Wonder, Whitney Houston, and Donny Hathaway.\n\nAmerican Idol[]\n\nYamin auditioned in Boston, Massachusetts, singing Leon Russell's \"A Song for You\", but his audition was not aired (it was later aired on October 24, 2009, as part of the American Idol Rewind – season 5 show). He performed the song again in front of the judges during Hollywood rounds, as well as Rascal Flatts's \"Bless the Broken Road\". During the group auditions, Yamin and his group performed \"It's In Her Kiss\" (aka \"The Shoop Shoop Song\") from Betty Everett; Simon Cowell disliked the group performance, but Randy Jackson said Yamin was the best one in his group, and Paula Abdul said it was a good thing she could look past two left feet, in a way of saying he did not dance well but he could definitely sing. He was sent through by the judges and made it through to the finals of the competition.\n\nDuring one weekly rehearsal, guest coach Stevie Wonder told Yamin that he should definitely pursue a career in music. Simon Cowell stated that he thought Yamin was \"potentially the best male vocalist\" in five seasons on American Idoland later, after Yamin's \"A Song for You\" performance, he declared that it was a \"vocal masterclass\". His performance of \"A Song for You\" ranked third on Entertainment Weekly's countdown of the 16 best American Idol performances in the series history.\n\nOn the May 10, 2006, results show Yamin, Taylor Hicks, and Katharine McPhee were announced as the top three finalists. All three returned to their respective hometowns for a day of festivities in their honor. Yamin's homecoming visit included radio and television interviews; performing \"Home\" for more than 4,000 fans, capped by Mayor Douglas Wilder presenting the key to the city; and meeting Governor Tim Kaine, whom Yamin greeted with a hug. Yamin threw out the first pitch before a sold-out crowd at The Diamond for a Richmond Braves game and sang a verse a cappella of \"A Song for You\". Video highlights were shown on the top three results show.\n\nYamin was eliminated from American Idol on May 17, 2006, after the tightest race; each of the three top contestants received an almost exactly equal percentage of the viewer votes necessary for advancement to the remaining two spots.\n\nAfter Idol[]\n\nYamin appeared on several talk shows, including The Tonight Show, Live with Regis and Kelly and the Fox News Channel program, Dayside. On June 11, 2006, he performed the national anthem a cappella at Game 2 of the NBA finals.\n\nHe also appeared in the annual Pop Tart-sponsored national American Idols LIVE! Tour between July and September 2006. The tour included a sold-out show at the Richmond Coliseum in Yamin's hometown.\n\nOn October 8, 2006, Yamin performed at the Virginia State Fair as the closing act. He was the first contestant from Season 5 to have his own solo concert. His backup band was the Little Memphis Blues Orchestra. There was no new material featured in the concert; instead, he sang nine cover songs.\n\nOn December 8, 2006, Yamin sang the national anthem, Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On?\" and his newly released single, \"This Christmas\", as part of the 2006 Genworth Children's Advantage Classic (sponsored by the Genworth Foundation) at the Alltel Pavilion at the Virginia Commonwealth University's Stuart C. Siegel Center in Richmond. Proceeds from the tennis event, which featured James Blake, Andre Agassi, Lindsay Davenport, and Steffi Graf, benefited local programs for disadvantaged youth.\n\nMusic career[]\n\nIn 2005, Yamin was featured on three tracks (\"Sound Doctrine\", \"Song of Hope\", and \"Whatchacomeherefoe?\") of Richmond, Virginia gospel musical artist Big Planz's album Sound Doctrine. Four renditions of another song he recorded with Big Planz, \"The Storm\", were released on iTunes.\n\nIn December 2006, Yamin announced a music publishing contract with Sony/ATV Music Publishing. On January 25, 2007, Yamin signed a record deal with Hickory Records, a Sony/ATV-owned imprint set up as a \"virtual label\",[1] with distribution handled by RED Distribution. Yamin has stated that \"Sony invested in [him] as a partner\" as part of a 50/50 deal, which means that \"[they] both stand or fall\".\n\nAs a teaser, Yamin released the song \"Movin' On\" from his self-titled debut album on AOL's First Listen and iTunes in February 2007. His first radio single, \"Wait for You\", was released on March 13, 2007.\n\nElliott Yamin was released on March 20, 2007, debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 chart with sales of 90,000 copies in its first week.

He also signed CDs at the New York Times Square Virgin Megastore across from the TRL studio and at Circuit City in his hometown, Richmond, Virginia, where the line went around the building.\n\nDuring April and May 2007, Yamin embarked on a radio tour which included interviews and acoustic in-studio performances, accompanied by guitarist Russel Ali. Mark Gorlick (VP Artist Development & Marketing, Sony/BMG RED) emphasized the importance of this type of promotion: \"We put together a five-week promo tour across the country, and just worked it...When programmers saw that the Elliott in person was consistent with the Elliott they saw on television that was huge.\"\n\nOn May 16, 2007, Yamin performed his hit single, \"Wait for You\", on the American Idol Season 6 Top 3 results show. The song jumped 60 spots on iTunes in a few hours as well as from 80 to 31 on the Billboard Hot 100. Following the performance, sales of his self-titled album increased, jumping 47 spots on the Billboard 200, from 67 to 20.\n\nYamin toured North America during May and June 2007, with pop/R&B singer Josh Hoge opening for him. The tour continued in October and November 2007, again with Hoge opening and adding the rock band The Last Goodnight. Fellow American Idol 5 alumnus José \"Sway\" Penala was added to Yamin's band to provide backing vocals.\n\nYamin performed in Washington, DC, at the country's biggest Independence Day celebration, \"A Capitol Fourth\", televised live on PBS on July 4, 2007, singing \"In Love with You Forever\" and \"America the Beautiful\".

He also appeared as himself on the television soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful (aired August 24) and the television drama Lincoln Heights (aired September 20), performing \"Wait for You\".\n\nYamin visited the Philippines in September 2007 for a free mall concert tour of the Ayala Malls to promote his self-titled album. During his press conference at the Glorietta Activity Center, Yamin expressed his excitement at being a part of the \"warm and friendly...Filipino culture\" and his desire to return with his full band for a concert tour.[2]Following his TriNoma show on September 21, members of his fan group Yaminoys presented him with a \"mini-me\" Elliott doll. During the last concert held at the Alabang Town Center, Yamin accidentally stepped on the cord of his microphone while performing \"Wait for You\", inadvertently unplugging his microphone from the cord. A video of this can be seen on YouTube.\n\nOn December 1, 2007, Yamin performed at the Live & Loud 07 Music Festival in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he was the opening act for one of his personal idols, Whitney Houston. However, he did not meet Houston.\n\nElliott Yamin placed on four-year-end Billboard charts for 2007, ranking at number 3 on the Independent Albums chart and at number 114 on The Billboard 200 chart, as well as ranking at number 39 on the Independent Albums decade-end chart (2009). \"Wait for You\" placed on six-year-end Billboard charts for 2007, ranking at number 11 on the Pop 100 Airplay chart and at number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs chart. \"Wait for You\" was honored as one of the most performed songs in the ASCAP repertory during 2007; Yamin performed it at the 25th Annual ASCAP Pop Music Awards on April 9, 2008, at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles.

Footage of the pair distributing mosquito nets to villagers as part of the Malaria No More program was shown on the American Idol Season 7 Top 11 results show (March 19, 2008). Fantasia sang \"Amazing Grace\" and, following the local custom of naming a newborn after a visitor, a baby boy was named \"Elliott\", which reduced Yamin to tears. Yamin attended but did not perform on the Idol Gives Back show, broadcast on April 9, 2008.\n\nOn April 16, 2008, Yamin performed on the American Idol Season 7 Top 7 results show – dedicating the song \"Free\" to his late mother, Claudette Yamin (See Personal Life).\n\nA Japan edition of Yamin's debut album was released on May 21, 2008, by Avex Trax.
