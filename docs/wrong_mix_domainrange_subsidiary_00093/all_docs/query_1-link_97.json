        "text": "Security and privacy are paramount concerns in information processing systems, which are vital to business, government and military operations and, indeed, society itself. Meanwhile, the expansion of the Internet and its convergence with telecommunication networks are providing incredible connectivity, myriad applications and, of course, new threats.\n\nData and Applications Security XVII: Status and Prospects describes original research results, practical experiences and innovative ideas, all focused on maintaining security and privacy in information processing systems and applications that pervade cyberspace. The areas of coverage include:\n\n-Information Warfare,\n\n-Information Assurance,\n\n-Security and Privacy,\n\n-Authorization and Access Control in Distributed Systems,\n\n-Security Technologies for the Internet,\n\n-Access Control Models and Technologies,\n\n-Digital Forensics.\n\nThis book is the seventeenth volume in the series produced by the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) Working Group 11.3 on Data and Applications Security. It presents a selection of twenty-six updated and edited papers from the Seventeenth Annual IFIP TC11 / WG11.3 Working Conference on Data and Applications Security held at Estes Park, Colorado, USA in August 2003, together with a report on the conference keynote speech and a summary of the conference panel. The contents demonstrate the richness and vitality of the discipline, and other directions for future research in data and applications security."
