Hit them up with questions along the way. Class sizes are limited to keep the learning more personal.\n\nInteractive learning scenarios and sandboxes\n\nThere’s no better way to learn Kubernetes, Docker, Python, Bash, and more than just diving in and using it. Now you can, with guided interactive scenarios in a live dev environment you can access through your browser. Or get into a sandbox with a technology and write, run, or edit code to really understand how it works.\n\nExpert playlists to guide you through nearly any topic\n\nFor over 40 years, O’Reilly experts have kept our clients ahead of the tech curve. They’ve handpicked the exact content that’s best for you to learn about nearly any technology or business approach.
