With this synchronization, you can correlate events to the time that system logs were created and the time that other time-specific events occur. An NTP server must be accessible by the client switch.\n\nNTP uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as its transport protocol. All NTP communication uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is the same as Greenwich Mean Time. An NTP network usually gets its time from an authoritative time source, such as a radio clock or an atomic clock that is attached to a time server. NTP distributes this time across the network. NTP is extremely efficient; no more than one packet per minute is necessary to synchronize two machines to within a millisecond of one another.\n\nNTP uses a stratum to describe how many NTP hops away a machine is from an authoritative time source. A stratum 1 time server has a radio or atomic clock that is directly attached, a stratum 2 time server receives its time from a stratum 1 time server, and so on. A machine running NTP automatically chooses as its time source the machine with the lowest stratum number that it is configured to communicate with through NTP. This strategy effectively builds a self-organizing tree of NTP speakers.\n\nNTP has two ways to avoid synchronizing to a machine whose time might be ambiguous:\n\n• NTP never synchronizes to a machine that is not synchronized itself.\n\n• NTP compares the time that is reported by several machines and does not synchronize to a machine whose time is significantly different from the others, even if its stratum is lower.\n\nThe communications between machines running NTP, known as associations, are usually statically configured; each machine is given the IP addresses of all machines with which it should form associations. An associated pair of machines can keep accurate timekeeping by exchanging NTP messages between each other. However, in a LAN environment, you can configure NTP to use IP broadcast messages. With this alternative, you can configure the machine to send or receive broadcast messages, but the accuracy of timekeeping is marginally reduced because the information flow is one-way only.\n\nCisco's implementation of NTP does not support stratum 1 service; it is not possible to connect to a radio or atomic clock. We recommend that you obtain the time service for your network from the public NTP servers available on the IP Internet.\n\nIf the network is isolated from the Internet, Cisco's NTP implementation allows a machine to be configured so that it acts as though it is synchronized using NTP, when it actually has determined the time using other methods. Other machines synchronize to that machine using NTP.\n\nDefault NTP Configuration\n\nTable 39-1 shows the default NTP configuration.\n\nConfiguring NTP on the Switch\n\nThe following sections describe how to configure NTP.\n\nEnabling NTP in Broadcast-Client Mode\n\nEnable the switch in NTP broadcast-client mode if an NTP broadcast server, such as a router, regularly broadcasts time-of-day information on the network. To compensate for any server-to-client packet latency, you can specify an NTP broadcast delay (a time adjustment factor for the receiving of broadcast packets by the switch).\n\nTo enable NTP broadcast-client mode on the switch, perform this task in privileged mode:\n\nThis example shows how to enable NTP broadcast-client mode on the switch, set a broadcast delay of 4000 microseconds, and verify the configuration:\n\nNTP Broadcast Client mode enabled\n\nNTP Broadcast delay set to 4000 microseconds\n\nCurrent time: Tue Jun 23 1998, 20:25:43\n\nTimezone: '', offset from UTC is 0 hours\n\nSummertime: '', disabled\n\nLast NTP update:\n\nBroadcast client mode: enabled\n\nBroadcast delay: 4000 microseconds\n\nClient mode: disabled\n\nNTP-Server\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nConsole> (enable)\n\nConfiguring NTP in Client Mode\n\nConfigure the switch in NTP client mode if you want the client switch to regularly send time-of day requests to an NTP server. You can configure up to ten server addresses per client.\n\nTo configure the switch in NTP client mode, perform this task in privileged mode:\n\nThis example shows how to configure the NTP server address, enable NTP client mode on the switch, and verify the configuration:\n\nNTP server 172.20.52.65 added.\n\nNTP Client mode enabled\n\nCurrent time: Tue Jun 23 1998, 20:29:25\n\nTimezone: '', offset from UTC is 0 hours\n\nSummertime: '', disabled\n\nLast NTP update: Tue Jun 23 1998, 20:29:07\n\nBroadcast client mode: disabled\n\nBroadcast delay: 3000 microseconds\n\nClient mode: enabled\n\nNTP-Server\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n172.16.52.65\n\nConsole> (enable)\n\nConfiguring Authentication in Client Mode\n\nAuthentication can enhance the security of a system running NTP. When you enable the authentication feature, the client switch sends time-of-day requests only to trusted NTP servers. The authentication feature is documented in RFC 1305.\n\nYou can configure up to ten authentication keys per client. Each authentication key is actually a pair of two keys:\n\n• A public key number—A 32-bit integer that can range from 1-4,294,967,295\n\n• A secret key string—An arbitrary string of 32 characters, including all printable characters and spaces\n\nTo authenticate the message, the client authentication key must match the key on the server. Therefore, the authentication key must be securely distributed in advance (the client administrator must get the key pair from the server administrator and configure it on the client).\n\nTo configure authentication, perform this task in privileged mode:\n\nThis example shows how to configure the NTP server address, enable NTP client and authentication modes on the switch, and verify the configuration:\n\nNTP server 172.20.52.65 with key 879 added.\n\nNTP Client mode enabled\n\nNTP authentication feature enabled\n\nCurrent time: Tue Jun 23 1998, 20:29:25\n\nTimezone: '', offset from UTC is 0 hours\n\nSummertime: '', disabled\n\nLast NTP update: Tue Jun 23 1998, 20:29:07\n\nBroadcast client mode: disabled\n\nBroadcast delay: 3000 microseconds\n\nClient mode: enabled\n\nAuthentication: enabled\n\nNTP-Server Server Key\n\n---------------------------------------- ----------\n\n172.16.52.65\n\nKey Number Mode Key String\n\n---------- --------- --------------------------------\n\nConsole> (enable)\n\nSetting the Time Zone\n\nYou can set a time zone for the switch to display the time in that time zone. You must enable NTP before you set the time zone. If NTP is not enabled, this command has no effect. If you enable NTP and do not specify a time zone, UTC is shown by default.\n\nTo set the time zone, perform this task in privileged mode:\n\nThis example shows how to set the time zone on the switch:\n\nTimezone set to 'Pacific', offset from UTC is -8 hours\n\nConsole> (enable)\n\nEnabling the Daylight Saving Time Adjustment\n\nFollowing U.S. standards, you can have the switch advance the clock one hour at 2:00 a.m. on the first Sunday in April and move the clock back one hour at 2:00 a.m. on the last Sunday in October. You can also explicitly specify start and end dates and times and whether the time adjustment recurs every year.\n\nTo enable the daylight saving time clock adjustment following the U.S. standards, perform this task in privileged mode:\n\nThis example shows how to set the clock that is adjusted for Pacific Daylight Time following the U.S. standards:\n\nSummertime is enabled and set to 'PDT'\n\nConsole> (enable)\n\nTo enable the daylight saving time clock adjustment that recurs every year on different days or with a different offset than the U.S. standards, perform this task in privileged mode:\n\nThis example shows how to set the daylight saving time clock adjustment, repeating every year, starting on the third Monday of February at noon and ending on the second Saturday of August at 3:00 p.m. with a 30-minute offset forward in February and back in August.\n\nConsole> (enable) set summertime recurring 3 mon feb 3:00 2 saturday aug 15:00 30\n\nSummer time is disabled and set to ''\n\nstart: Sun Feb 13 2000, 03:00:00\n\nend: Sat Aug 26 2000, 14:00:00\n\nOffset: 30 minutes\n\nRecurring: yes, starting at 3:00am Sunday of the third week of February and ending 14:00pm Saturday of the fourth week of August.\n\nConsole> (enable)\n\nTo enable the daylight saving time clock adjustment to a nonrecurring specific date, perform this task in privileged mode:\n\nThis example shows how to set the nonrecurring daylight saving time clock adjustment on April 30, 2003, at 4.30 a.m., ending on February 1, 2004 at 5:30 a.m., with an offset of 1 day (1440 min):\n\nConsole> (enable) set summertime date apr 13 2003 4:30 jan 21 2004 5:30 50\n\nSummertime is disabled and set to ''\n\nStart : Thu Apr 13 2000, 04:30:00\n\nEnd : Mon Jan 21 2002, 05:30:00\n\nOffset: 1440 minutes (1 day)\n\nRecurring: no\n\nConsole> (enable)\n\nDisabling the Daylight Saving Time Adjustment\n\nTo disable the daylight saving time clock adjustment, perform this task in privileged mode:\n\nThis example shows how to disable the daylight saving time adjustment:\n\nSummertime is disabled and set to 'Arizona'\n\nConsole> (enable)\n\nClearing the Time Zone\n\nTo clear the time zone settings and return the time zone to UTC, perform this task in privileged mode:\n\nThis example shows how to clear the time zone settings:\n\nTimezone name and offset cleared\n\nConsole> (enable)\n\nClearing NTP Servers\n\nTo clear an NTP server address from the NTP servers table on the switch, perform this task in privileged mode:\n\nThis example shows how to clear an NTP server address from the NTP server table:\n\nNTP server 172.16.64.10 removed.\n\nConsole> (enable)\n\nDisabling NTP\n\nTo disable NTP broadcast-client mode on the switch, perform this task in privileged mode:\n\nThis example shows how to disable NTP broadcast-client mode on the switch:\n\nNTP Broadcast Client mode disabled\n\nConsole> (enable)\n\nTo disable NTP client mode on the switch, perform this task in privileged mode:\n\nThis example shows how to disable NTP client mode on the switch:\n\nNTP Client mode disabled"
