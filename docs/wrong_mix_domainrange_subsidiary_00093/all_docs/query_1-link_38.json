The sets are attached automatically to any new device or link that is added to the map. For existing devices or links, the settings you make here affect all but those devices and links that have been set manually to use another set of notifiers.\n\nFor existing installations, Set devices to alarm on link down is set by default in the Device Thresholds panel of the Server Settings window.\n\nYou can now identify down interfaces by adding ifAlias to notifier message fields.\n\nNew check boxes have been added to Ignore Error/Discards for better clarity.

You can change both device and link notifiers in a map.\n\nIntermapper now uses TLSv1.2 (required)\n\nIntermapper and Intermapper Remote Access now require TLSv1.2. For a list of supported ciphers, see:\n\nChart Data Preserved When Map is Deleted\n\nChart data is now moved to a Chart Data/Deleted folder when its associated map is deleted. Through this mechanism, you can recover a deleted map and its associated chart data, which, while possible, was considerably less straightforward in previous versions.\n\nEnhancements\n\nAdmin-level users can now set or change notifier delay options for all devices or links on a server, rather than per-map.\n\nIgnore Errors/Discards options have been expanded in the Interfaces window to include Ignore Transmit Errors, Ignore Receive Errors, Ignore Transmit Discards, and Ignore Receive Discards.\n\nInterface tables now have three new fields that you can export/import called IgnoreErrors, IgnoreDiscards, and IgnoreUtilization.\n\nifAlias is now available in the Notifier Message window field list.\n\nWhen you delete a map from Server Settings > Enabled Maps, the charts associated with the map get moved to a new Chart Data/Deleted directory.\n\nThe term severity has been changed to status in the Alert Acknowledgement dialog.\n\nFixes\n\n32-bit Windows versions are no longer supported.\n\nAlarmpoint notifiers now send alerts even when no device notifier is enabled for the device, but one or more notifier is enabled for interfaces.\n\nWhen running Intermapper Flows for the first time with different versions of Intermaper server and client, Flows now runs properly.\n\nYou can now edit a device or link acknowledgment comment by reopening the Acknowledge dialog and editing the current comment.\n\nJune 2019\n\nVersion 6.3.2\n\nThe self-signed certificate installed with Intermapper now uses no domain name instead of helpsystems.com. This removes an issue with Intermapper's security score.\n\nDevice notifiers no longer send an Up notification when the device goes down but comes back up before the expiration of a delay setting.\n\nA problem with initialization of the Intermapper Data Center database has been fixed.\n\nA problem with slow startup caused by chart data repairs has been fixed.\n\nStopping the Intermapper Reports server no longer results in warning entries in the Intermapper database log.\n\nIf you shut down the Intermapper server with Intermapper Remote Access client connected with a map open, and that map is subsequently removed, Intermapper now starts cleanly and handles the situation gracefully.\n\nFebruary 2019\n\nVersion 6.3.1\n\nEnhancement\n\nYou can now set parameters including delay and repeat values (using Alt-click or Cmd-Click) for all notifiers in the Link Notifier view.\n\nThe Knowledgebase article describing chart file structures has been updated to include old and new chart file structures. It is available at https://community.helpsystems.com/knowledge-base/intermapper/chart/chart-file-format/.\n\nOther Fix\n\nYou can now use a command-line to open Intermapper or Intermapper Remote Access with multiple maps using multiple --map arguments.\n\nWhen using Intermapper Remote Access as a read-only user, you can now access on-demand tables when the SNMP Table viewer probe is used.\n\nNotifiers now send OK status correctly.\n\nYou can now open Intermapper or Intermapper Remote Access from a command line using multiple --map arguments.\n\nAn issue that prevented the Star arrangement from working on 64-bit Windows systems has been fixed.\n\nAn issue with large detection maps that prevents Intermapper server from starting up has been fixed.\n\nLink notifiers now send OK status properly when the previous status was Critical.\n\nCorrected the display of negative 32-bit data values in charts, web server charts, and reports.\n\nWhen unpacking the Red Hat distribution, the ReadMe file is now named correctly.\n\nJanuary 2019\n\nVersion 6.3\n\nNew Features\n\nIntermapper integration into Insite\n\nIntermapper is now available as module of Insite. For this release, the following new features are available:\n\nAdd Connection - add a network connection from Insite to one or more Product Name servers.\n\nHome - view a list of connected Intermapper servers, with summary info about each connection.\n\nDashboard - Add widgets to view various information about the devices on an Intermapper server, as well as the server itself.\n\nWidgets - create widgets to view the Device list, a summary of device status, or widgets that plot device status or server resource statistics over time. Select from a variety of chart styles.\n\nEnhancement\n\nIf you are denied access to a map for some reason, the error window now shows the map name, not just the map ID.\n\nOther Fix\n\nIntermapper now supports Windows Server 2016, Debian 9, and Ubuntu 18.04.\n\nNote: Debian 9/Ubuntu 18.04 users must manage Intermapper's 32-bit library dependencies a little differently from previous versions. For more information, see the Debuntu ReadMeFirst file available from the download page, and included with the download package.\n\nIn certain circumstances, UP and DOWN notifications did not match, and Okay notifications did not match corresponding non-Okay notifications. These have been fixed.\n\nOctober 2018\n\nVersion 6.2.3\n\nEnhancement\n\nA new probe, the Cisco Firepower Threat Defence ASA probe, has been added. It monitors Firepower clusters, with each device appearing on the map.\n\nOther Fix\n\nAn issue with editing device notifiers for multiple devices in Linux installs has been fixed.\n\nThe UPS Autodetect probe now loads correctly. Note: This is true for fresh installations only.\n\nA note about Layer 2 scan reliability has been added to Mapping with Layer 2 Knowledgebase article .\n\nUnchecking the Use Server Defaults for all three types of Interface Thresholds no longer causes the map to appear to be corrupted.\n\nAn issue that required closing and re-opening a map to continue editing has been fixed.\n\nNotifications for a device's UP and OK status are now sent only if a prior DOWN or non-OK notification was sent.\n\nIntermapper server no longer requires availability of TLS 1.0 for client connections. Both TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 can now be disabled in the ssl.conf file.\n\nThresholds are now displayed correctly in Japanese-localized installations.\n\nJuly 2018\n\nVersion 6.2.2\n\nEnhancement\n\nA check box has been added to the Graphics pane of Intermapper Preferences. It allows the label color, which normally controls the color of the outline for built-in shapes (rectangle, oval, wire, and cloud), to control the color of the shape's text.\n\nA new probe has been added. The Cisco Catalyst Switch probe monitors various configurations of fixed, modular, and stacked Cisco Catalyst switches. It has been tested with Catalyst 2960, Catalyst 3560, Catalyst 3750, Catalyst 3750X, and Catalyst 3850 switches.\n\nOther Fix\n\nChart data now displays consistently at the correct start times.\n\nWhen used by many devices, the SNMP Comparison Probe no longer fails intermittently.\n\nThe descriptions for probes now use a consistent format.\n\nLink notifiers now send an \"OK\" notification whenever one or more non-OK link notifications have been sent. This fixes some circumstances where the \"OK\" was not sent.\n\nLinks initially displayed as dotted lines are now updated promptly to their current state.\n\nUpdated the Command-Line Example topic to use a simpler and more current example.\n\nLinks are now updated in a timely manner, improving display of traffic animations.\n\nA number of fixes have improved stability.\n\nA number of improvements increase stability of interactions between Intermapper Server and Intermapper Remote Access while reducing system resource usage.\n\nIntermapper no longer creates unnecessary chart files for the Detection Map.\n\nRemoved some memory leaks that resulted in reduced responsiveness of Intermapper Server over time.\n\nIntermapper now correctly identifies the operating system for Windows 8.1, 10, Server 2012 R2, and Server 2016.\n\nDocumentation for editing and attaching Notifiers has been updated to match the current functionality.\n\nReduced the number of link update checks to improve performance.\n\nDocumentation now includes information about how to set all controls in a column to the same value using Alt-click (or Ctrl-click).
