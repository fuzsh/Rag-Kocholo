In setting my watch the other services may only run the time for about 30 seconds and certainly not enough time to reset ones watch. S3-0846 time announcement every ten seconds S3-0847 Solar flare alerts at special times if the flare warrants them. S3-0848 \"How about a screensaver that shows the world map with night and day and the current time in my time zone?

S3-0855 I would like to hear more about the leap seconds. S3-0856 given the increasing importance of GPS: consider digital status of the satellites continuously broadcast. S3-0857 Doing pretty good as is. S3-0858 Radio controlled clock. Very convenient S3-0859 Hmmmm..... S3-0860 present service meets my needs S3-0861 The local time clock S3-0862 An internet service that provided the time through a finger request would be useful. S3-0863 All of my bases are covered - great job! I used to use your phone service to get the correct time. Now I mostly use the www.time.gov web site. S3-0864 \"im not very creative, sorry :-)\" S3-0865 software to automatically set time on local computers S3-0866 It's wonderful to be able to log on and get the exact time and know that you've got the exact time.

S3-0889 \"GPS, I OWN 2 GPS RECEIVERS, TIME FUNCTION IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR COMPUTERS AND AVIATION.\" S3-0890 Version numbers on the download page would be helpful so downloading the application isn't required to check the version. S3-0891 \"More time zones, as I'm in Australia. THe ability to select a displacement from UTC by drop-down menu on the web page?\" S3-0892 Java display applet for the web site that could continuously display the time. It could be programmed to measure network propagation display and correct for it and correct for the computer clock's drift and jitter.

It's basically all we use anymore. S3-0911 \"internet time is the most useful to me, and better wireless capability of some would be great. Perhaps celluar packet service of some type would be nice.\" S3-0912 Happy with the way things are now. S3-0913 Software to synchronize the computer's clock with a WWV transmission by means of a receiver hooked to the audio input of the computer. S3-0914 Clock display for computer screens that is small. And can be run continuouly. Ability to use official time in other programs. Capture the time. S3-0915 Web page S3-0916 DTMF tone code for time encoding would be nice so I can build master clock systems for my stations that are easy to build and cheap to construct. S3-0917 EXCELENT SERVICE AS IS S3-0918 I think that a global time-zone map (maybe even an applet calculator showing the current time elsewhere) would be very useful S3-0919 none S3-0920 ? S3-0921 \"Maybe additional S2 servers for cities over 100,000 people. Penetrating time signals from GPS type satellites.\" S3-0922 The service I use the most is NTP via the internet and I also have several WWV clocks. S3-0923 My needs are met by current services.

S3-0938 US/Canada severe weather alerts (non marine) S3-0939 I hate daylight savings time- can't stand it getting dark at 4:30 here on the east coast.

I used to use the short -wave signals, but now with the net am very pleased with this on-line service.\" S3-0957 \"A service much like WWVB, but designed for reliable timecode detection. As it is, there's no really error checking (other than basic client side sanity checks) to verify the timecode was received correctly.\" S3-0958 No comment S3-0959 I would like to be able to use the web page to update the clock on my computer. S3-0960 improve the internet synch to try to better account for the network delay -- perhaps run a series of pings and take the average delay time into account.
