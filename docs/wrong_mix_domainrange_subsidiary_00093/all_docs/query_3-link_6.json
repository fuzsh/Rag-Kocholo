Referenced by WS-Security specification.\n\nSpecifies XML digital signature processing rules and syntax. Referenced by WS-Security specification.\n\nFor Securing RESTful Services use the OAuth standard.\n\nEasier to implement than SAML Token Profile. Suitable for service to service interactions only.
