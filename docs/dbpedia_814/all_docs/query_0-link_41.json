        "text": "In a historic first, the 2019 winners of America's three biggest beauty pageants are all black women.\n\nNia Franklin, 25, became Miss America in September, followed last week by Kaliegh Garris, 18, as Miss Teen USA and Cheslie Kryst, 28, as Miss USA.\n\nThe wins are particularly meaningful given the competitions' decades-long history of racism and bias.\n\nVanessa Williams was the first black woman to win a top pageant in 1983.\n\nAfter Ms Williams was crowned Miss America, it took until 1990 for another black woman to win a major pageant.\n\n\"Mine is the first generation to have that forward-looking mindset that has inclusivity, diversity, strength and empowered women,\" Ms Kryst said in her acceptance speech on Thursday."
