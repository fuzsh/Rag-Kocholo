Garcelle Beauvais of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” will be joined by E! News‘ Keltie Knight as co-hosts of this year's pageant.\n\nA wide variety of celebrities and notables made up the 2024 judging panel including Vanderpump Rules star Scheana Shay and Anastasia Beverly Hills CEO Anastasia Soare. Singer Gavin DeGraw, Miss USA 1990 Carole Gist, motivational speaker Natasha Graziano, and Miss USA 1994 Lu Parker\n\nHow Miss USA Is Chosen .\n\nContestants are required to be at least 18 and, with new recent rule changes, there is no longer any age limit to enter the cmpetition. Each contestant from all 50 states and the District of Columbia are judged in three categories: swimsuit, evening gown and interview, Equally important judging critiera includes character, poise, confidence and personality. There is no talent portion of the competition.\n\nHalle Berry (Miss Ohio) competed\n\nin the 1986 Miss USA pageant.\n\nMiss USA Fun Facts\n\n• The Miss USA pageant was conceived in 1950 when Yolande Betbeze, winner of the rival Miss America pageant, refused to pose for publicity pictures while wearing a swimsuit. Pageant sponsor Catalina decided to pull their sponsorship, and create their own competition.\n\n• The first Asian American woman to win Miss USA was Macel Wilson in 1962; the first Hispanic was Laura Martinez-Herring in 1985; the first African-American was Carole Gist in 1990; and the first Miss USA of Middle-Eastern descent was Rima Fakih in 2010.\n\n• Hollywood actress Halle Berry was introduced to the world as Miss Ohio, who was the first runner-up in the Miss USA contest in 1986 (Miss Texas, Christy Fichtner, was crowned that year). However, Berry's movie career was launched by the publicity she received as a Miss USA contestant.\n\nMiss USA Controversies\n\nKataluna Enriquez, Miss USA's\n\nfirst transgender contestant.\n\nTara Elizabeth Conner captured the Miss USA title in 2006. Months later, however, she was under threat of losing her crown due to \"inappropriate behavior\" amid reports she had visited New York City bars when she was not yet 21.\n\nDays of speculation about her fate ended in a much-publicized Donald Trump press conference on December 19, 2006 when he announced that Conner would be allowed a second chance to keep her crown.\n\nA year later, Miss Nevada Katie Rees was offered no second chance at keeping her crown after compromising photos of her in various states of undress which instantly went viral around the Web. She was officially dethroned in January 2007\n\nMiss USA 2009 was also not without controversy when Miss California, Carrie Prejean, was asked a question on gay marriage. Fumbling for words, the beauty queen stated that she was in favor of the \"opposite\" of same sex unions, resulting in a mixed audience response of cheers and catcalls. Prejean, later admitted that the response may have cost her the Miss USA crown.\n\nMost recently, pageant traditionalists were sent into a tailspin when it was revealed that Miss Nevada, Kataluna Enriquez, would become the first transgender MIss USA contestant ever in 2021. The announcement came in June, Gay Pride Month, when Enriquez messaged her Intagram following: \"My win is our win. We just made history. Happy Pride.”\n\nalso see -> Miss America\n\nMore about Miss USA around the Web:\n\nMiss USA 2024 - The place to be for everything you always wanted to know, featuring behind-the-scenes at the Miss USA Pageant, related trivia, history, info on past shows, a past-winners' photo gallery and media contact and registration info.\n\nMiss USA - Brief history, a list of winners dating back to 1952 and related pictures, links to current pageant contestants & bios, a comprehensive schedule of events leading up to the pageant, interesting trivia, links to further information from Wikipedia."
