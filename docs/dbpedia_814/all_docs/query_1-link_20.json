        "text": "Just three days after Mississippi’s Addie Carver was named Miss Teen USA, another queen was crowned live on The CW via the 2024 Miss USA Pageant.\n\nOnce again broadcast from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, this year’s ceremony was jointly presented by The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Garcelle Beauvais, E! News host Keltie Knight, 2022 Miss USA winner Morgan Romano and make-up guru Patrick Starrr.\n\nMore from TVLine\n\nMiss Teen USA 2024: The Winner Is...\n\nSuperman & Lois EPs Promise Satisfying Returns in Final Season, Tease a Fresh Take on Jimmy Olsen\n\nSuperman & Lois Video: How Did Bitsie Tulloch Feel About Having Her Real-Life Husband Direct 'Lovey-Dovey' Scenes With Tyler Hoechlin?\n\nFifty-one women from across the United States convened on stage for a two-hour competition that end with just a handful of hopefuls desperately waiting to hear their name read aloud. Preferably last.\n\nFollowing a swimwear competition, an evening gown portion and more dramatic eliminations than an episode of RuPaul’s Drag Race, here’s how things shook out for the final five:\n\nFIFTH PLACE | Macy Hudson (Miss Ohio)\n\nFOURTH PLACE | Christell Foote (Miss Tennessee)\n\nTHIRD PLACE | Danika Christopherson (Miss Oklahoma)\n\nSECOND PLACE | Connor Perry (Miss Kentucky)\n\nAnd just like that, Michigan’s Alma Cooper is the winner of Miss USA 2024. She will go on to represent the United States in the 2024 Miss Universe Pageant.\n\nCooper received her crown from last year’s runner-up, Hawaii’s Savannah Gankiewicz; last year’s winner, Utah’s Noelia Voigt, resigned from the title of Miss USA in May.\n\n“In life, I strongly value the importance of making decisions that feel best for you and your mental health,” Voigt said at the time. “As individuals, we grow through experiencing different things in life that lead us to learning more about ourselves.”\n\nSeveral days after Voigt returned her crown, the winner of Miss Teen USA 2023, New Jersey’s UmaSofia Srivastava, followed suit. “After careful consideration, I’ve decided to resign as I find that my personal values no longer fully align with the direction of the organization,” she wrote in an Instagram post.\n\nVoigt and Srivastava’s mothers appeared on Good Morning America later that month, alleging that their daughters — who were unable to speak out because of confidentiality clauses in their contracts — were “ill-treated, abused, bullied and cornered” by the pageant organization.\n\nFamiliar names on this year’s selection committee included Scheana Shay, star of Bravo’s Vanderpump Rules; Anastasia Soare, CEO of Anastasia Beverly Hills; Gavin DeGraw, singer of the One Tree Hill theme song; Carole Gist, winner of Miss USA 1990; and Lu Parker, winner of Miss USA 1994, among others.\n\nDid you come away with any strong feelings from the 2024 Miss USA Pageant?
