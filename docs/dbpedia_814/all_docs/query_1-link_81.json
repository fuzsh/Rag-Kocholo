        "text": "It all began with a beauty pageant. There were multiple outfit changes, from evening gowns to bathing suits to national costumes. There were behind-the-scenes looks at the contestants’ lives. There were question-and-answer periods. And by the end of the 2023 Miss Universe competition last month, Sheynnis Palacios of Nicaragua emerged victorious.\n\nPeople celebrated in Nicaragua’s streets, singing the national anthem and waving the country’s blue and white flag. It was the first time a contestant from the Central American nation of nearly seven million people had claimed the Miss Universe crown.\n\n“It was as if someone had won the World Cup,” said Gioconda Belli, a well-known Nicaraguan poet and novelist.\n\nIn what has felt like a script from a television drama, the authoritarian government claimed that the director of the Miss Nicaragua contest, which had chosen Ms. Palacios to represent the country at the global competition, was part of an “anti-patriotic conspiracy” to overthrow President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo.\n\nBoth the director, Karen Celebertti, and Ms. Palacios, 23, had taken part in large anti-government protests in 2018 that the Ortega government viewed as a challenge to its rule and which led to a brutal crackdown. Ms. Celebertti’s husband, Martín Argüello, was also involved in the 2018 protests.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
