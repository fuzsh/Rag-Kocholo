        "text": "With all due respect to Miss Michigan Elizabeth Ivezaj, a core of St. Joseph County residents will likely have an allegiance toward Miss Indiana during Sunday’s Miss USA pageant.\n\nMekayla Diehl, a 2007 graduate of White Pigeon High School, will represent the Hoosier state during the 51-candidate competition, to be televised live on NBC starting at 8 p.m.\n\nA resident of Bristol, Ind., Diehl said conditions of her participation in the pageant include no media interviews until after the contest. She deferred to Ashley Swathwood, her pageant mentor. Swathwood is owner of Elkhart-based Ashely Rene’s, a pageant and prom dress store where Diehl works as a buyer.\n\nSunday’s three-hour pageant takes place at River Center in Baton Rouge, La.\n\nSwathwood said Diehl has been on a whirlwind tour since capturing the crown of Miss Indiana in November in Indianapolis. Diehl, 25, has since made a number of public appearances at fundraisers and special events throughout the state.\n\n“Mekayla has shared her inspiring, personal story with a lot of people as Miss Indiana,” Swathwood said. According to her contestant bio on the Miss USA website, Diehl is a victim of child abuse and was adopted.\n\nShe is also the first Native-American to represent Indiana in the Miss USA pageant.\n\nSwathwood said she and Diehl arrived in Louisiana’s capital Memorial Day weekend, and Diehl has been engaged in pageant-related activities ever since. The itinerary has been extensive.\n\nDiehl has been rooming with Miss Pennsylvania, Valerie Gatto. Swathwood said Diehl has experienced a solid camaraderie with many of the other contestants. Although they are vying for the same prize, the contestants have a lot in common as lifelong pageant participants. That in itself gives them a common bond, Swathwood said.\n\n“Like any other large gathering, you find the people you have a lot in common with and you just hang out and establish a bond,” Swathwood said. “The nice part about this week building up to the pageant is Mekayla has made 50 new friends and if she ever needs a place to stay or she has a layover at some airport somewhere, she can call any of the other contestants and she’ll have a place to stay or someone to meet with for dinner … it’s just that kind of a common bond they all have, like they’re members of the same club, for example.”\n\nDiehl is a graduate of Albion College, where she played volleyball, track and was on its dance team. She was in one of the final classes to attend Baldwin Prairie Elementary School before going to White Pigeon Middle School in the 1990s.\n\nHer rise to fame in the world of pageants was a meticulously traveled route.\n\n“It started at the Cass County Fair when I was in eighth grade and I enjoyed the experience,” she said during a November interview with the Journal. “It was my first time and I had a lot to learn, but I saw scholarship potential, and that kept my interest.”\n\nA native of the Cass County community of Union, Diehl subsequently immersed herself in the pageant circuit, which included a series of competitions such as Miss Michiana, Miss Cass/St. Joe, and after her family moved, the Elkhart County Fair and Bristol Homecoming pageant.\n\nDiehl, who stands 5-foot-8, is an ardent supporter of Habitat for Humanity, as well as a Goshen-based home for troubled youth and the Susan G. Komen Foundation.\n\nShe said much of who she is today can be attributed to growing up in a small community and attending a tight-knit school district.\n\n“I was probably one of the first students enrolled in the Little Chiefs Village Young 5s program and as I look back, I have such an appreciation for the chance to have gone to school in White Pigeon,” she said last year. “I went to the final Tomahawk football game a few years ago up in Constantine and it brought back so many memories of good times from my high school years.”\n\nSwathwood said Diehl has enjoyed being spoiled in the Deep South, the past two weeks, where she and her peers attended a governor’s tea, paid a visit to a local children’s hospital and have received royal treatment.\n\nWin or lose, Diehl has already made a request.\n\n“She told me the day after the pageant, even if she wins and she would be flying to New York the next morning, she doesn’t want to leave Baton Rouge without having a milk shake and a beignet,” Swathwood said. “She has worked very hard to get to this point, but she will spoil herself just a little bit when it’s done.”\n\nOnline: www.missuniverse.com/missusa"
