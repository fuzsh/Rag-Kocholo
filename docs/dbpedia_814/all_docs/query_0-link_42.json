        "text": "The newly crowned Miss USA is a 26-year-old Army officer from the District of Columbia who gave perhaps the strongest answer of the night when asked about women in combat.\n\n“As a woman in the United States Army, I think … we are just as tough as men. As a commander of my unit, I’m powerful, I am dedicated,” Deshauna Barber said. “Gender does not limit us in the United States.”\n\nAs the winner of Sunday’s 2016 Miss USA competition held at the T-Mobile Arena off the Las Vegas Strip, Barber will go on to compete in the Miss Universe contest.\n\nBarber is the first-ever military member to win Miss USA. In a press conference following the event, the 26-year-old lieutenant from Northeast DC said she plans to take a break from the Army Reserves and had already discussed with superiors the possibility of going inactive for a couple of years should she win the title. She said she currently serves two days per month.\n\n“My commander should be watching right now,” Barber said. “Two days a month is definitely not active duty. It is an obligation that I signed up for but they are very flexible in the United States Army Reserves.”\n\nBarber said she plans to use the pageant’s spotlight and her title to support veteran’s causes and tackle the issue of suicide and post-traumatic stress disorder among military members. When asked what message she had for the presidential candidates — including former pageant owner and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump — Barber said they should focus more on veteran’s issues, including the backlog at veterans hospitals.\n\n“I think that a lot of the topics that they discuss isn’t as important,” she said in a glittering gold gown.\n\nComing in second was Miss Hawaii, who punted during the question-and-answer segment when asked who she would vote for among the likely presidential candidates, Democrat Hillary Clinton or former pageant owner Donald Trump, a Republican.\n\nChelsea Hardin acknowledged that there was no way to correctly answer the question during the beauty pageant. The question was framed with Clinton’s likely status of being the first woman nominated by a major political party for the White House. Hardin responded that gender doesn’t matter when deciding the next commander-in-chief. The 24-year-old college student from Honolulu simply said the new president should push for what’s right for the country.\n\nIncidentally, the Miss USA pageant was previously owned by Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe question drew boos from the crowd (which applauded her answer) and raised eyebrows among some viewers on Twitter:\n\nThe other women in the top five were asked about voting rights, income inequality and the recent death of sports icon Muhammad Ali.\n\nFan-favorite Miss California, Nadia Grace Mejia, had stumbled and paused when answering a question about social and economic inequality. Mejia was widely mocked on social media after stumbling, closing her eyes and pausing when answering the question Sunday about economic inequality.\n\n“I think that the rich need to be able to be giving and I think the poor need to work hard and I think the middle class need to come together and find an in-between,” she eventually said.\n\nMejia answered her critics on Instagram, writing that she was praying to God for the right words and he answered, “It’ll take longer than 30 seconds to answer that babe.” She also posted a video of her singing “I don’t know about the economy” to the tune of the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way.”\n\nThe 20-year-old model is the daughter of 1990s one-hit-wonder singer Gerardo, known for “Rico Suave.”\n\nThe Fox network carried the three-hour broadcast. Last year, the show aired on cable’s Reelz network.\n\nThe beauty pageant organization is bouncing back from a series of controversies last year, including a breakup with Trump and the mistaken crowning of Miss Universe.\n\nAt the start of Sunday’s show, Steve Harvey made a cameo in a video to poke fun of the Miss Universe crowning that he botched in December.\n\nHarvey was hosting that event, also held in Las Vegas, and had mistakenly named Colombia’s Ariadna Gutierrez Arevalo the winner before correcting himself on the stage. Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach of the Philippines was then given the crown. Officials later said it was due to human error. The talk show host said he had re-read the card and noticed it said “first runner-up” next to the Colombia contestant’s name before clarifying with producers his mistake.\n\nAs for Trump — who didn’t appear at Sunday’s Miss USA pageant — the presumptive Republican presidential nominee wasn’t forgotten by viewers on social media.\n\nPerhaps as polarizing as his policy views were the reactions to the Miss USA show on Twitter. Some commented that the event was less campy and more boring than previous years without the brash billionaire’s involvement, while others said they were glad to take in the guilty-pleasure show without supporting the businessman turned politician.\n\nA year ago, Trump set off an ugly breakup with The Miss Universe Organization, then co-owned by Trump and NBCUniversal. Trump offended Hispanics last June when he made anti-immigrant remarks in announcing his bid for the White House.\n\nNBC, which had aired the pageant since 2003, quickly cut business ties with Trump and refused to carry the 2015 show it had already scheduled. The Spanish-language network Univision also pulled out of the broadcast for what would have been the first of five years airing the pageants.\n\nTrump then sued both Univision and NBC.\n\nHe settled with NBC in September. Trump’s $500 million lawsuit against Univision claimed his First Amendment rights were violated, as well as claiming a breach of contract. That dispute was eventually settled, too.\n\nThe talent management company WME/IMG then acquired The Miss Universe Organization."
