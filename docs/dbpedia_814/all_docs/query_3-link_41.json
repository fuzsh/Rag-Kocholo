        "text": "Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nAhmitara is a dynamic and inspiring individual whose journey reflects her diverse aspirations. Fluent in Japanese, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Anyuak, and French, her pageant career began at age four when she won her first title and set the stage for her future achievements. A first-generation college graduate, she earned a degree in Political Science with a minor in Sociology from Winona State University. She advocated for lowering student tuition, speaking before the Minnesota House of Representatives, and served as a Trustee for the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System. Professionally, Ahmitara is employed by Avera Medical Group and serves as a marketing specialist for ROSS Leaders. She also volunteers with Habitat for Humanity. Her varied interests include video editing, cooking, gardening, and reading. Her favorite recipe, a spicy traditional Ethiopian stir-fry of peppers and jalapenos, reflects her rich cultural heritage. Despite her many achievements, Ahmitara remains deeply connected to her roots. Most of her family still resides in Gambella, Ethiopia, where her parents escaped a war in the early 1990s. Their journey to safety motivates her to succeed and to give back. Her lifelong ambition is to become a successful ambassador, maintaining the integrity of international relations and contributing to global peace and understanding. Ahmitara's story is a testament to perseverance, cultural pride, and the pursuit of dreams, embodying the values of hard work, resilience, and hope for a better future."
