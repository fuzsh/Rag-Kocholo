        "text": "Bullying can affect everyone—those who are bullied, those who bully, and those who witness bullying. Bullying is linked to many negative outcomes including impacts on mental health, substance use, and suicide. It is important to talk to kids to determine whether bullying—or something else—is a concern.\n\nKids Who are Bullied\n\nKids who are bullied can experience negative physical, social, emotional, academic, and mental health issues. Kids who are bullied are more likely to experience:\n\nDepression and anxiety, increased feelings of sadness and loneliness, changes in sleep and eating patterns, and loss of interest in activities they used to enjoy. These issues may persist into adulthood.\n\nHealth complaints\n\nDecreased academic achievement—GPA and standardized test scores—and school participation. They are more likely to miss, skip, or drop out of school.\n\nA very small number of bullied children might retaliate through extremely violent measures. In 12 of 15 school shooting cases in the 1990s, the shooters had a history of being bullied.\n\nKids Who Bully Others\n\nKids who bully others can also engage in violent and other risky behaviors into adulthood. Kids who bully are more likely to:\n\nAbuse alcohol and other drugs in adolescence and as adults\n\nGet into fights, vandalize property, and drop out of school\n\nEngage in early sexual activity\n\nHave criminal convictions and traffic citations as adults\n\nBe abusive toward their romantic partners, spouses, or children as adults\n\nBystanders\n\nKids who witness bullying are more likely to:\n\nHave increased use of tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs\n\nHave increased mental health problems, including depression and anxiety\n\nMiss or skip school\n\nThe Relationship between Bullying and Suicide\n\nMedia reports often link bullying with suicide. However, most youth who are bullied do not have thoughts of suicide or engage in suicidal behaviors.\n\nAlthough kids who are bullied are at risk of suicide, bullying alone is not the cause. Many issues contribute to suicide risk, including depression, problems at home, and trauma history. Additionally, specific groups have an increased risk of suicide, including American Indian and Alaskan Native, Asian American, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth. This risk can be increased further when these kids are not supported by parents, peers, and schools. Bullying can make an unsupportive situation worse."
