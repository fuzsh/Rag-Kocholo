        "text": "Bravo-lebrities Lala Kent, Scheana Shay, and Garcelle Beauvais glammed up to attend the 73rd annual Miss USA Pageant, which was held at the Peacock Theater in downtown LA on Sunday.\n\nLala (born Lauren Elyse Burningham) showcased her bourgeoning baby bump in a clingy white maxi-dress, featuring a halter design and single right sleeve, along with a matching pair of peep-toe heels.\n\nThe expecting 33-year-old is scheduled to give birth on September 1 - the day before her 34th birthday - and she'll co-parent the baby girl (whose name begins with 'S') with her live-in mother Lisa Burningham.\n\n'I'm surprised I've kept [her name] a secret for this long,' Lala - who famously conceived via intrauterine insemination - marveled during her Amazon Livestream last Friday.\n\n'Although at Sutton [Stracke's] show, the Green Label show that I went to last week, Erika [Jayne] goes, \"Do you have a name?\" And I have not told anybody, you guys, and I just blurted it out to her. And she was mic'd! There are some people who just get things out of me.'\n\nKent continued: 'No one's guessed [her name]. That's the best part about it. And it's, like, how do I reveal it? Do I post a picture of the baby with the name? Or do I reveal the name after I've finished breastfeeding and I get the [name] tattooed?
