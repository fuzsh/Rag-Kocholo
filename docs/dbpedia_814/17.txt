Miss USA 1990

All posts tagged Miss USA 1990

25 years ago, Norway captured its first-ever Miss Universe crown courtesy of Mona Grudt (who eventually went on to become a judge in Miss Universe 1994 held here in Manila). Her First Runner-Up then was the tall Carole Marie Gist who is also looking at celebrating her Silver Anniversary as Miss USA. FYI, she is the first African American woman to ever win the national crown.

Letâ€™s now watch their triumph as the last two women standing during the 1990 Miss Universe held at the Shubert Theater in Los Angeles, California.
