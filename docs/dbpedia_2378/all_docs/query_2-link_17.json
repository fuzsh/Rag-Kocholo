National museums negotiate conflicts and contradictions and entrain the community sufficiently to obtain the support of scientists and art connoisseurs, citizens and taxpayers, policy makers, domestic and foreign visitors alike. National Museums and Nation-building in Europe 1750-2010 assess the national museum as a manifestation of cultural and political desires, rather than that a straightforward representation of the historical facts of a nation. National Museums and Nation-building in Europe 1750-2010 examines the degree to which national museums have created models and representations of nations, their past, present and future, and proceeds to assess the consequences of such attempts. Revealing how different types of nations and states--former empires, monarchies, republics, pre-modern, modern or post-imperial entities--deploy and prioritise different types of museums (based on art, archaeology, culture and ethnography) in their making, this book constitutes the first comprehensive and comparative perspective on national museums in Europe and their intricate relationship to the making of nations and states\"-\n\nThe important role museums played in the construction of nation-states in the late 18th century and in the 19th century generated an abundant literature. In today’s word, these institutions of knowledge are unanimously recognized as lieux de mémoire, capable of generating publics and, more or less successfully, self-identifying (mostly national) collectives. The present chapter intends to analyze how two history museums are projecting a questioning a sense of belonging and its problematic relation to a common present through the celebration of a common past. In particular, we are interested in how supra-national identities are negotiated through these traditionally national agencies of culture in the exhibition C’est notre histoire!, held in 2007–2008 at the Musée de l’Europe in Bruxelles and at the National Museum of Australia, opened in Canberra in 2001. The National Museum of Australia will be regarded as an example of recent negotiations and dissents on an alternate post-national identity construction. It can allow us to revisit the idea of Europe’s museums made of new uses, practices and discourses on multiple identities and groups who were traditionally forgotten in or excluded from a clear-cut national identity. It will also allow us to examine the scenographic representations of a European identity which can not be summarized as the juxtaposition of fixed national narratives and artefacts.\n\nIn recent years it has been asked whether it is time to move ‘beyond the national museum’. This article takes issue with this assertion on the grounds that it misunderstands not only museums as cultural phenomenon but also the ways in which globalization, nationalism, and localism are always enmeshed and co-constitutive. The article begins by considering theories of globalization, postnationalism, and cosmopolitanism and their relevance for national museums in the European context. Specific theories of cosmopolitanism are subsequently further explored in relation to two museum examples drawn from the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh and the Museum of European Cultures in Berlin. In different ways both examples demonstrate the potential for museums to engage visitors with ideas of cosmopolitanism, globalization, and postnationalism by revisiting, reframing, and reinterpreting existing national collections and displays. In the process the article makes the case for the merits ...\n\nLocated in leisure economies, subjected to state politics, dedicated to the demotic, demarcated by social distinction, committed to the civics of multiculturalism, endorsed by an ethics of reconciliation, determinedly focused on “the cutting edge”, enduringly concerned with preservation, the cultural politics of contemporary museums are, to say the least, complex in their effects and challenging in their analysis. The central aim of this edition of New Zealand Sociology is to critically engage with this multifaceted terrain by focusing on developments in the Antipodes. As complex sites of meaning making, museums in Aotearoa New Zealand and Australia are contingent on distinctive interplays between global flows, nationally specific institutions and locally meaningful narratives. The contributors to this volume analyse antipodean museums in relation to the historical legacy of settler colonialism and the current regimes of globalisation by exploring how these interplays are represented in particular museum practices, and how such cultural institutions attempt to account for the effects of this cultural traffic.\n\nIn December 2015, the Turnbull government announced in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) a three per cent increase to the efficiency dividend towards federally-funded GLAM institutions, which constituted a cut of $36.8 million. Considering these current events, this dissertation will address the issue of politicisation of federally-funded GLAM institutions by reviewing Australia’s two most powerful national museums, the National Museum of Australia (NMA) and the Australian War Memorial (AWM) as case studies. In the case of the NMA, the ideological conflicts firstly relate to the influence of the economic policies in relation to the funding of its creation under the Hawke government; direct political involvement in relation to the creation of the Museum’s strategic vision by Keating; and the Museum taking a role in the developing identity politics under Howard. The second case study relates to the AWM, which is a very different and older institution to the NMA, whose governance has been primarily shaped by the military owing to the legislation surrounding its Council and through the Returned and Services League (RSL). Fulfilling the function of both a traditional national museum and a site of ceremonial ritual within the revised Anzac legend, the AWM is immediately affected by any politics relating to Australian identity as wrought under both Labor and Coalition governments. These two case studies provide essential background for the third chapter which focusses on how the politicisation of these two federally-funded institutions has influenced funding decisions. In Australia, cultural policies are becoming increasingly intermeshed with the identity politics used by political parties, and as such, a review of how the funding of the NMA and the AWM might be influenced is of interest given the importance of funding to all museums."
