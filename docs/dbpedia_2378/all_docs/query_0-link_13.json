Rare and fascinating objects which illustrate the complex origins of the Australian continent and nation have been collected for the past 20 years and are the focus for the Museum's wide range of stoires and exhibitions. State of the art technology and exhibition design present these stories in an exciting and inventive manner, including the use of muti-media, live performances and hands-on activities, to appeal to a wide range of audiences. There are three themes: Land, Nation, People."
