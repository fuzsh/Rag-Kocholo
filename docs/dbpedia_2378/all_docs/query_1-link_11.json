        "text": "As the national capital, Canberra is packed with cultural and arts institutions. Whether you’re a budding historian or just interested in deepening your understanding and appreciation of the city and Australia, you’ll find something in Canberra’s galleries, museums and exhibitions to satisfy you.\n\nHere are our top 10 places to broaden your arts and cultural knowledge in Canberra.\n\nOverview\n\nCanberra is home to many significant institutions like the National Library of Australia and the Museum of Australian Democracy.\n\nThere are also plenty of local and national galleries in Canberra with fascinating art and cultural heritage collections.\n\nMany Canberra galleries also run special events throughout the year.\n\n1. National Library of Australia\n\nPerfect for finding a quiet spot in the lead-up to exams, the Main Reading Room of the National Library of Australia will surround you with cultural and literary history. The building itself contains architectural works of art and then there are the exhibits of items from the library’s collection.\n\nEnjoy the free wi-fi and hunker down to study. Or wander through art and photographic exhibitions in your spare time. The library also runs a number of events, including author talks, lecture series, poetry readings, and more – and has one of Canberra’s best bookshops.\n\n2. National Museum of Australia\n\nThe National Museum is an intriguing place to discover more about the remarkable history of Australia. Located on the shore of Lake Burley Griffin, its historical collection contains over 210,000 objects and offers innumerable opportunities to learn and connect with the history of Australia, including with the rich culture of our First Nations peoples, across different time periods.\n\nSome exhibitions are permanent while others are temporary, so watch the website to discover what’s on.\n\nThe National Museum of Australia Entrance and Loop.\n\n3. ANU Drill Hall Gallery\n\nThe Drill Hall Gallery is located on the ANU campus. Initially built during the Second World War as a training ground for Australian soldiers, it is now a display space for a range of contemporary art and museum exhibitions throughout the year.\n\nIt also acts as a venue for live music performances, lectures and debates.\n\nThanks to the academics, collectors and critics who frequent the Drill Hall Gallery, it has developed a reputation for producing significant scholarly publications in connection with the exhibitions and events. Admission is free and the gallery is open from Wednesday to Sunday.\n\nBrowse the exhibitions at the Drill Hall Gallery.\n\n4. Old Parliament House\n\nOnce home to Australia’s parliament, the Museum of Australian Democracy is nestled among beautiful rose gardens on the south side of the lake. Between 1927 and 1988, when politicians governed from there, the building saw some of Australia’s most significant political events, debates and decisions.\n\nThe Old Parliament House building that houses the museum is a noteworthy heritage site in its own right. Many of its original rooms are preserved and open for visitors to walk through, including the Prime Minister’s suite (Bob Hawke AC GCL was the last prime minister to use it) and the House of Representatives chamber.\n\nNow, several visiting and permanent exhibitions call Old Parliament House home and focus on Australia’s political and social heritage – including a gallery dedicated to the art of political cartoonists.\n\n5. Questacon\n\nWith its emphasis on fun, interactive and relevant learning, visiting Questacon will never be boring. Aiming to engage all visitors in the exciting and ever-growing world of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), Questacon uses a range of exhibitions, interactive events, displays, workshops and shows to pique your interest. And it’s not just for kids.

Australian War Memorial\n\nA national memorial to all members of Australia’s armed forces, both past and present, and a military museum with an extensive collection of objects and artworks, the Australian War Memorial is a place to remember, reflect and discover.\n\nWhen it was first opened in 1941, the building was a memorial to those who had participated in the First World War, but its significance grew by the 1940s and the outbreak of the Second World War, when more names, conflicts and peacekeeping missions were added to its walls.\n\nExplore the exhibitions, beautiful and sombre Memorial Courtyard, the Hall of Memory and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, as well as the extensive sculpture garden and forecourt outside.\n\nThe view from the War Memorial down Anzac Parade also holds significant links to the Australian and New Zealand armed forces, with a series of monuments and memorials dotting the avenue in remembrance of soldiers, nurses, horses and conflicts.\n\n7. ANU Classics Museum\n\nYou don’t have to be a student of archaeology or history to appreciate a visit to the ANU Classics Museum on campus. Initially built in the 1960s as a space for teaching students about Greek and Roman archaeology, the museum’s collection now spans the Mediterranean, including objects and artworks from ancient Egypt, the Near East and classical civilisations. Open every weekday, it’s worthwhile to wander through the ancient past on a self-tour between classes. If you’d like to gain more in-depth knowledge, join a monthly guided tour.\n\n8. National Gallery of Australia\n\nHome to the world’s largest collection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artworks and objects in Canberra, the National Gallery of Australia also contains some exceptional examples of French Impressionism, Surrealism, Pop Art, Abstract Expressionism and of other more recent art movements.\n\nOpen every day with free admission, you can surround yourself with artworks from the collection that engage, challenge and inspire.\n\nWalk through the Aboriginal Memorial which consists of 200 dupun (hollow log coffins) from central Arnhem Land.\n\n9.

You’ll also find collections around aspects of Australian culture like surfing or food – and, for something more obscure – a collection of feature films and home movie footage of vintage dogs or Cadbury chocolate advertisements.\n\nKeep an eye on the website for what’s on and tickets. Events running throughout the year can include jazz performances to film screenings and much more."
