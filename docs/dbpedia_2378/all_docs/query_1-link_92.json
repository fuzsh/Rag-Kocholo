        "text": "It may sound strange to have saved our most anticipated family day out for nearly six months but, as I have written before, there really is so much to do in Canberra.\n\nBut all this time, ever since our plane’s wheels first touched down here, discussions of every CBRbound clan day out have been punctuated regularly with a single interjection from the kids: “Questacon.”\n\nThis is not some form of tourist attraction Tourettes. It’s just that during our research trip here two years ago, the science and technology fun palace that is Questacon made such an impression upon the kids that they have been begging to return ever since.\n\nA nondescript concrete block on the shore of Lake Burley Griffin — the stunning architecture of the National Museum appears to taunt its dull exterior — Questacon more than makes up for its unambitious exterior with a spectacular interior and staff that every kid on Earth would want as their science teacher.\n\nThere are eight distinct zones to Questacon, each exploring a different aspect of the sciences, and if that sounds dull because you remember school trips from a bygone era, suffice to say that this is science education with an injection of Disney-like imagination that had both CBRbound kids rapt from arrival to reluctant departure.\n\nGravity is demonstrated with a jump-suited free-fall wall and slide, the inner workings of the brain via visual and sensory illusions and hands-on demonstrations that had them shrieking and whooping with delight. And then there are the talks.\n\n“Who wants to go to one of the science talks?” I asked the kids.\n\nNo takers.\n\n“Come on. They’ll be good,” I tried, perhaps overselling them, I thought.\n\nSo we went.\n\nWe saw a 30-minute presentation on mummification which featured enough references to gore and goo to satisfy the most ardent fan of zombie movies, and a session on how rockets work that fired the kids’ imaginations like you wouldn’t believe and had them feigning Russian accents for two days.\n\n“What was everybody’s favourite thing?” I asked at the end of the day.\n\n“The talks,” came the reply from two young voices.\n\nQuestacon was just as big a hit second time around as it was the first. As a result, we signed up for a family membership which means we can return again and again for a whole year.\n\nIt’s true that Canberra has so much to see and do that you could do something different every weekend, but some things bear repeating and Questacon has been installed as our family favourite for the next 12 months at least."
