        "text": "Why are Australian museums, libraries, archives, and galleries asking people to donate their placards, t-shirts, badges, and banners from the “Yes” and “No” campaigns, even before the vote has been held? And why is it right that they do this?\n\nWhat are the ethical challenges faced by national cultural institutions in identifying which materials to collect — or exclude — from contentious or current-day political issues, especially when an outcome is unknown?\n\nThe obligations of curating\n\nAustralia’s museums, libraries, and archives are charged with collecting, preserving, and exhibiting historical material relevant to the Australian nation. Collecting materials from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament referendum and the “Yes” and “No” campaigns is perhaps most relevant for the Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House, which presents itself uniquely as a living museum of social and political history.\n\nCollecting from referendums is consistent with the strategic objectives outlined in the federal government’s new National Cultural Policy, which promotes “putting First Nations first”, “creating a place for every story”, recognising the importance of “strong cultural infrastructure”, and “engaging the audience”.\n\nDespite this alignment, an obvious challenge for cultural institutions in collecting from current political campaigns is the perception of political interference — especially for any that have received funding from the government to deliver education campaigns about the Voice to Parliament.\n\nWhile direct political interference is a greater concern in other parts of the world, problems of human bias and systemic institutional bias continue to be relevant to all museums. These concerns can extend to criticisms about which mass movements are included in collections and if “all sides” of debate are fairly represented.\n\nThe Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House in Canberra. (Photo by Lisa Maree Williams / Getty Images)\n\nMuseums, libraries, galleries, and archives around the world recently gained experience in collecting from an acute and changeable social situation throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Some institutions set up “rapid response” collecting initiatives, and all had to grapple with the difficult issues of managing divergent political views. A typical challenge was whether they should collect samples of misinformation and disinformation circulating in the community, even though this could risk the impression that they condoned scientifically discredited positions.\n\nThe experience of collecting during the pandemic drew attention to other challenges of contemporary collecting. There was a tendency to collect everything (anything) and not always consider how many masks or homemade window signs one collection might, for example, need in the future. It was, moreover, difficult to assess the monetary value of collected materials. Which items would end up having more value for future storytelling? Which could end up being prohibitively expensive if purchased later? Working on the fly meant it was difficult to fully consider exclusions that were being built into the collection, and to consider the consequences that the act of collection was having — on everyone involved.\n\nThis point was astutely made by a particular tweet written during the pandemic:\n\nContemporary collecting isn’t about reacting the fastest to events ... Curating means taking care. Do all you can to ensure you and others are safe as they can be physically and mentally.\n\nMuseums must learn from this experience and ensure that their top priority in collecting referendum materials is to work according to an ethic of care. Sectoral organisations have codes of ethics, but individual institutions need to work with First Nations knowledge holders and guides to understand the specific ways that the debates about the Voice are affecting the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and think about any harm their actions could create.\n\nThe interests of history\n\nTargeted collecting of paraphernalia from contemporary election campaigns started in earnest in the 1960s when curators from the National Museum of American History began attending campaign rallies and events. They acquired homemade and novelty hats as well as mass-produced badges, T-shirts and the like that spruiked presidential candidates and their slogans.\n\nThese collections were designed to represent the social and collective experiences of political participation of everyday Americans. They became a popular and important counterpart to the National Museum’s traditional political history collections of official Presidential portraits and ephemera, gavels and legislative documents, and First Ladies’ gowns.\n\nA collection of impeachment buttons from during the Nixon presidency, held by the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution. (Photo by Andre Chung for The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nGrass-roots collecting practices evolved to inform collections that later came to define the collective direct actions of the 1960s across the Western world. Museums started to build small collections around historically defining civil rights, sexual politics, nuclear power and the environment, the war in Vietnam and Indigenous land rights movements.\n\nPopular items tended to be disposable, cheap, either mass-manufactured (such as badges), mimeographed flyers, or handmade items (like T-shirts and posters) often made in collective DIY workshops.\n\nTruth-telling\n\nCollecting materials from current political events gives museums a reason to speak to the public about the role they play in producing historical narratives. It emphasises the obligations they, along with all other democratic institutions, have in documenting human experience truthfully.\n\nThis point is particularly important for Australian museums. Despite being highly rated as trusted sources of information by the general community, museums are, says Larissa Behrendt, “often viewed suspiciously by First Nations people due to their colonial past”.\n\nCollecting the referendum materials and the stories that accompany them gives a platform for museums to have “uncomfortable but necessary” conversations with people about the history of museums themselves. It inserts museums into discussions about accountability in a nation that is still reckoning with its histories of colonisation and dispossession.\n\nHow to collect, not simply what\n\nWe cannot always anticipate the moment when suddenly an issue that seemed marginal becomes a mass social movement. Naomi Klein calls these “suddenly everybody moments”. She nominates Occupy Wall Street in 2011 and the racial justice moment following the murder of George Floyd in 2020 as prime instances. The COVID-19 pandemic and the anti-government causes that coalesced with the 6 January 2021 attack of the US Capitol also fit this category.\n\nIn contrast to these event typologies, we do know when a referendum (or election) will be held. They provide museums with a unique opportunity to engage citizens in conversation about political participation. What issues are influencing their vote? Are they reacting positively or negatively to campaign strategies? Which imagery is resonating for them?\n\nCollecting materials — physical objects as well as oral or video recording, plus social media posts — that represent how people form a decision is more important for understanding a national corpus than is the outcome of the vote. It is more important to ask “how” to collect rather than “what” to collect.\n\nUndertaking this work in real time requires preparation as well as practice and policies —covering everything from interpersonal communication techniques to logistical requirements such as an ownership and use agreement and appropriate storage provisions. It also requires strong social networks beyond the museum.\n\nRecording the museum’s own role in this process is an important part of the historical narrative, as is producing effective cataloguing methods so the archive can be easily accessed and used by current and future users. This work requires transparency in justifying institutional requirements and communicating directly with the public who, in contemporary collecting, should be seen as partners in the production of historical records rather than just sources.\n\nIf museums want people to talk to them — honestly — and donate their materials, they must be open about letting the public in on the role they play in producing history. This means thinking about whose voices they record, and how to represent dissenting opinions.\n\nIn the end, involving the public in collecting materials from the “Yes” and “No” Voice campaigns will reinforce to voters that their decision-making will have consequences far beyond than the usual three-year electoral cycle. It also helps to show the role that museums play in educating Australians about the current political system."
