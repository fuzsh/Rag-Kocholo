        "text": "As we bid farewell to the incredible voyage of Titanic: The Artefact Exhibition I am filled with immense pride and gratitude. A momentous occasion to commemorate, it has been wonderful to welcome over 300,000 visitors to this experience since opening at Melbourne Museum in December 2023. Included in that huge swathe of visitors were 100,000 international, interstate and regional Victorian guests, including 42,000 children. What a wonderful way to fuel their curiosity and teach valuable lessons from the past. Together – we marvelled at the 200 artefacts recovered from the wreck, while the majestic Grand Staircase became a cherished backdrop for thousands of selfies and numerous romantic wedding proposals. We even followed the journey of real Titanic passengers with our own boarding passes - complete with gripping narrative and the ultimate resolution - who survived? Who wouldn’t be moved by such an experience? Throughout this incredible journey, many milestones have been reached and expectations greatly surpassed. The world-class blockbuster exhibition was an Australian exclusive, direct from a sold-out season in Paris. Sessions were extended and sold out again and again, making it the most popular touring exhibition at Melbourne Museum since 2016. I’d like to personally thank our partners, the Experiential Media Group, RMS Titanic, Inc. and Visit Victoria, whose support was pivotal. Special recognition also to the The Fresh Collective for enhancing our guests’ experience serving over 10,000 exquisite High Teas reminiscent of the Titanic’s 1912 splendour. I especially commend the dedicated staff at Museums Victoria whose tireless efforts have been the keystone of this exhibition’s success. The overwhelming success of Titanic: The Artefact Exhibition is a tribute to its enduring legacy. The remarkable interest and engagement from audiences showcases the breadth, depth, and diversity of connections between Museums Victoria and the communities we serve. These interactions generate significant economic and social value for Victoria and Victorians. As Titanic sets sail for new shores, we await the much-anticipated arrival of the 66 million-year-old fossil of Victoria the T.rex. The upcoming exhibition features one of the largest and most complete Tyrannosaurus rex fossils in the world, marking the first time a real T. rex has been displayed in Victoria. This transition from the oceans of the Atlantic to the Cretaceous period is more than a change of exhibits – it is a continuing promise to bring wonderous, unparalleled experiences to our audiences."
