        "text": "Danielle Meddemmen\n\n2 November 2021: The University of Canberra has re-signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Questacon this week, strengthening its already collaborative relationship with the interactive science facility.\n\nThe original MoU was signed by both organisations in December 2017 and has seen a host of placement interchange opportunities, as well as the exchange of specialist knowledge between the institutions.\n\nThe University’s Vice-Chancellor and President, Professor Paddy Nixon, and the Director of Questacon Professor Graham Durant signed the MoU in a virtual ceremony on 1 November, extending the relationship for a further three years.\n\nProfessor Nixon said he was excited to see the collaborative relationship between the two institutions continue.\n\n“It’s my pleasure to sign this MoU with Questacon and continue the collaboration my predecessors have been building over the years,” he said.\n\n“Partnerships play an important role in the growth of our institution, and the sector, and I couldn’t think of a better way to do that than with one of Canberra’s leading organisations.”\n\n“Questacon is delighted to continue our collaboration with the University of Canberra,” Professor Graham Durant added.\n\n“We have been working together for more than 20 years to deliver inspirational learning experiences across a broad range of disciplines and professional workshops for future STEM teachers. We are excited to build upon the success of our previous collaborations, to see what this partnership will bring for STEM education and engagement in the future.”\n\nThe University’s Associate Professor in Robotics and Art Dr Damith Herath has experienced the benefit of the collaboration first-hand, after participating in a partnership for the development of robotics exhibition Born or Built? in recent years.\n\n“UC researchers collaborated with the Questacon design team on the project, which afforded a unique opportunity to integrate an interactive robotic artwork by the internationally-renowned performance artist, Stelarc, and construct a unique research platform and program around the exhibit,” he said.\n\n“Though the COVID-19 pandemic hampered realising the project's full potential, the ensuing work resulted in multiple research publications, an international award in robotic design and, shortly, a Master's degree in Human-Robot Interaction.\"\n\nProfessor in Water Science at the University, Dr Ross Thompson, was the Mind-in-Residence at Questacon in 2018.\n\nThe program sees experts collaborate with Questacon in their fields of research, for continual improvement within the organisation.\n\n“My time as Mind-in-Residence at Questacon provided an opportunity to share with the organisation how to more effectively engage with the research space, and for me to understand how Questacon works,” Professor Thompson said.\n\n“UC and Questacon are highly complementary, with the University both carrying out high quality research and being one of Australia’s leading universities in the area of science and technology education.”\n\nThis week’s MoU signing, which will expire in November 2024, builds on the long relationship between the two institutions and hopes to encourage further collaboration opportunities and mutually beneficial activities."
