        "text": "The travelling Empathy Museum (UK), the Virtual Empathy Museum (Australia) — designed for Health Care professionals — and the research by The Toledo Museum in visual language (US) are a few examples of the growing interest of the museum world in Empathy.\n\nAs a former Ph.D. researcher, teacher, museum staff, and current coach, I have investigated and practiced the power of art learning for over 20 years. Empathy was one of my research interests and the foci of my coaching.\n\nThe following 3 examples discuss three different Empathy-related workshops that addressed children, museum staff, and health professionals respectively. I hope these can contribute to the discussion about the learning of Empathy. Can we train our professionals to be empathetic? Is empathy the answer to raising awareness? Can Empathy help us understand the past?\n\nBut first: What is Empathy?\n\nEmpathy is a complicated process. It involves emotional and cognitive responses, and the ability to understand social and cultural contexts.\n\nEmotional Empathy involves:\n\nAffective Response: Immediate, subconscious reactions\n\nAffective Mentalizing: Mentally visualizing somebody’s state. Occasionally this causes physiological reactions.\n\nCognitive Empathy involves:\n\nSelf-other awareness\n\nPerspective-taking\n\nEmotion regulation\n\nSocial Empathy:\n\nUnderstanding of systemic barriers\n\nMacro Perspective Taking: Understanding their views as part of these contexts.\n\nAs neuroscientists Segal et al (2017) explain, if we can navigate through affective responses whilst achieving cognitive responses, we can reach the full scope of empathy. Social empathy is a crucial component of reaching cognitive empathy.\n\nEmpathetic History (St Fagans Open Air Museum, Wales, UK)\n\nMy PhD on How the National Curriculum for Wales and The National Museum of Wales construct understandings of history (2011) pointed out that all workshops for Key Stage 2 children (Ages 7–9) at St Fagans, National History Museum (currently National Museum of History) promoted Empathetic History. For example, children pretended to be pupils in the Victorian era (c. 1820–1914). The facilitator was a strict teacher, she used a cane etc. This is a very popular activity in UK museums.\n\nHowever, Stockley (1983:61) argues that empathy should be regarded as part of an already- developed scheme of historical skills, which could be further developed through empathy. This agrees with the most recent neuroscientific studies like the one mentioned above and my study. The pupils used their emotions to make sense of a historical period. This led to misconceptions: for example, they were confused about who was rich and who was poor. After the children were ‘caned’ in the classroom, they played Victorian games, which confused them as to whether the Victorian children were happy or sad. Empathy, in our case, was not helpful to develop historical understanding.\n\nUnderstanding Eye Conditions (Cardiff Story Museum, Wales, UK)\n\nAs a member of the Front of House team at the Cardiff Story Museum (2011- 2013), we had diverse training in Inclusivity. One of our sessions was dedicated to understanding blindness. During the session, we wore different goggles that simulated different eye conditions. We also went through devices that make a blind person’s life easier. At that time, I was impressed! However, I soon realized that understanding the condition is only one part of understanding disability. What happens beyond the physical aspect of a condition? Are there different experiences of blindness? In our case, identifying just the condition led to sympathy, not empathy.\n\nEmpathy workshop with Health Care workers (Online, 2022, UK)\n\nIn 2022 I did a series of online Empathy training sessions for healthcare professionals, using Art experiences. Most healthcare professionals focused on the fact that Empathy is a complicated issue. They were afraid that it may lead to compassion fatigue. With one exception, all of them found Art a very interesting tool to start thinking about how other people feel. They were intrigued when we took up the role of a portrait when they sharpened their observation skills by looking at a painting, relaxing through slow looking, or taking the singer’s perspective. However, due to the team’s lack of time and the one-off character of our seminars, I didn’t thoroughly discuss daily scenarios and the nature of work — something that I always do with my clients. In this case, the training was an introduction to Empathetic skills.\n\nSo… Can museums teach Empathy?\n\nYes! Here are five areas we could focus on:"
