I recently was lucky enough to win a double pass to Color Run through APOD which gave my sister and I a wonderful day together.â\n\nâAPOD, not only offers the ‘Best’ discount site but it also recognises the sacrifice made by our veterans and their families.â\n\nâOur family recently needed new tyres for the car. I managed to shop around and negotiate the best price which I was pretty pleased with. I then remembered I could use my APOD membership and saved a further $70. This more than re-payed for my membership. Thanks APOD for such a great program, and for putting money back into our families pocket!!â\n\nâI really think that this project is up there with the best I have seen since I joined up with the Navy in 1956. Well done for all the work that you have put in.â\n\nâAmazing value! I saved an additional $300 (on top of the sale price) at Angus & Coote the very first time I used my APOD membership.â\n\nâGreat website and so easy to use. Plus the APOD discount was applied easily at the end. Great range. With 9 children to buy this Xmas I will definitely be shopping here. Thanksâ\n\nâThis is a great project for us old ex-service persons, finally someone is recognising our service by offering discounts. Thanks to all the sponsors.â\n\nâI was lucky enough to win a Double pass to The Colour Run in Melbourne which was today Beautiful day for it Positive Atmosphere Kind Happy People Great vibes Awesome day all round with heaps of colour. Thank you again for the tickets I loved every minute of today. Keep up the Fabulous work. High 5 all the wayâ"
