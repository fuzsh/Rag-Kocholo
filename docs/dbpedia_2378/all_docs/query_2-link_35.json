        "text": "We are part of a community of institutions in Scotland undertaking research to explore imperial and colonial histories and legacies, including the topic of Scotland’s historic connections with the transatlantic slave trade.\n\nBaggage and Belonging: Military Collections and the British Empire\n\nIn 2017, we were awarded a major grant by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) (AH/P006752/1) to examine the material legacies of late 18th and 19th-century British military campaigns in United Kingdom military museum collections.\n\nBaggage and Belonging: Military Collections and the British Empire is a collaborative research partnership with the National Army Museum which reappraises motivations for military colonial collecting.\n\nIn particular it investigates cultures of collecting within the British armed forces while on campaign and garrison duty in Africa and India, tracing collections and their histories through archival and material evidence.\n\nRead about the project or buy the book.\n\nImage above: Miniature portrait of Begum Sahiba Zeenat Mahal, wife of the last Mughal Emperor, taken by Surgeon Valentine McMaster, 78th Regiment, Indian Uprising, 1857-8.\n\nDoctoral research on Tibetan collections in Scotland\n\nResearch into the provenance and nature of the Tibetan collections in Scottish museums was undertaken by Inbal Livne between 2009 and 2013 through a Collaborative Doctoral Award (CDA) funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Titled ‘Tibetan Collections in Scottish Museums 1890-1930: A Critical Historiography of Missionary and Military Intent’, the project was a joint initiative between National Museums Scotland and the University of Stirling.\n\nUsing museum collections across Scotland and archives, the research revealed the colonial and imperial contexts of British-Tibetan encounters, and explored major sources of collecting, including military campaigns, colonial postings and missionary work.\n\nRead more about the project\n\nThe Matter of Slavery\n\nThe Matter of Slavery in Scotland was a collaborative project with the University of Edinburgh, supported by the Royal Society of Edinburgh, which explored ways of working with collections to integrate the history of slavery into museum displays and public history narratives.\n\nThe project considered historic and contemporary objects, together with buildings, monuments and paintings to identify and explore layered and often conflicting stories of Scotland’s slavery past. Leaping across time periods, the role of that past in shaping the country today was an important focus.\n\nDuring 2018-19 workshops and events brought together university researchers, curators, teachers, and charities to examine objects from Scottish collections.\n\nRead more about the project\n\nReview of galleries, labels and panels\n\nAcross our museums, we are reflecting on how we represent imperial and colonial pasts to our audiences. In our galleries, we are making changes to displays and labels to address historical bias.\n\nAs part of this, our Collecting Stories Gallery has been reviewed and changes made to panels and interpretive text to better reflect how the objects displayed came into our museums, including as legacies of imperial and colonial history. We have also introduced new content bringing different perspectives and stories into the gallery with the involvement of communities of interest.\n\nOther work in this area includes updated displays in the Scotland galleries and Grand Gallery. In Industry and Empire, an existing display on Scottish involvement in transatlantic slavery has recently been altered to include new material. In Scotland Transformed, a display on the tobacco trade now includes slavery-related objects and highlights the centrality of enslaved people and their labour to the Scottish economy during the 18th century. We have also recently revised the interpretation for the statue of James Watt in the Grand Gallery foregrounding his family’s involvement in the transatlantic slave trade alongside the more commonly known story of his contribution to the Industrial Revolution.\n\nWe invite you to comment on this and other aspects of our work by emailing input@nms.ac.uk.\n\nLegacies of Empire exhibition\n\nLegacies of Empire examines the histories of objects brought back from colonial military service by the armed forces of the British Empire.\n\nThe exhibition explores the motivations, codes and conventions behind the acquisition of objects, and their museum afterlives, whether taken as loot and trophies, preserved as relics and memorials, received as diplomatic gifts, or collected privately by officers stationed overseas.\n\nThe exhibition was on at the National War Museum from 2020 to 2023 and was one of the outputs from the Baggage and Belonging research project.\n\nLegacies of Empire exhibition\n\nWe partner with communities who have historical and contemporary connections with objects in our care to share and grow knowledge and provide greater access to collections and their associated information for all our audiences.\n\nConcepts Have Teeth\n\nSince December 2020 we have partnered with the AHRC funded project 'Concepts Have Teeth, And Teeth That Bite Through Time: digital imaging and Blackfoot material culture in UK museums'. This project aims to connect Blackfoot people living in North America with their cultural heritage held by museums in the UK.\n\nDirected by knowledge holders from Kainai, Piikani, Siksika, and Amskapipiikani nations, the project is a collaboration between Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, artists, archaeologists, museum professionals and students.\n\nThe project uses digital imaging techniques, art-based public engagement and spatial web technologies. These tools will improve the ability of Blackfoot people to interact with their historical objects and recover and shape their own narratives surrounding them. At National Museums Scotland the project is focusing on collections of Blackfoot quillwork.\n\nThe outputs include 3D digital models of museum objects, an online digital platform, an exhibition, and a publication on digital imaging in archaeology and cultural heritage.\n\nEntangled Knowledges\n\nNational Museums Scotland is a partner on the Australian Research Council funded project 'Entangled Knowledges: Kaartdijin, Science and History in the Robert Neill collection' (2021-2024). The project aims to highlight Menang Nyungar knowledge embedded in a historical fish collection held at National Museums Scotland, returning this knowledge to the Menang community in Western Australia.\n\nBy working in a cross-sector, collaborative and Indigenous-governed team, the project will enrich and re-frame the understanding of this collection in the Museum. It will unearth Indigenous taxonomic practices, produce new histories of biocultural collections and develop a model for participatory cross-cultural collaborations.\n\nIn 1841, Scottish-born British Army officer Robert Neill made a collection of fish specimens, sketches and Menang objects that are now held at National Museums Scotland and the Natural History Museum. Workshops held on Indigenous land will produce content to bring the collection together digitally. This will be used by museum partners to ensure wide cross-sector and community engagement with the project outcomes.\n\nThe outputs will include an online digital platform to reassemble the collections, a public lecture and symposium, and a co-edited book.\n\nPanjab Connections project\n\nBetween January 2015 and April 2016 we worked in partnership with the Young Sikh Leaders Network at the Guru Granth Sahib Gurdwara in Glasgow. The project was supported by the National Lottery Heritage Young Roots Fund.\n\nIn this collaborative project, young Sikhs uncovered the historic and contemporary connections between Panjab and Scotland through the life of Maharaja Duleep Singh. The last ruler of Panjab, Maharaja Duleep Singh was deposed from the throne by the British and exiled to Great Britain in 1854.\n\nJewellery once belonging to Maharaja Duleep Singh, and now in the national collections, inspired the young people’s creativity. In their own films, stills photography and jewellery they expressed their values and views on the entangled Sikh-Scottish history.\n\nRead more about the project\n\nHistory and heritage of religions in Scotland: NKS South Asian community project\n\nWe are supporting the delivery of a project led by Networking Key Services, an organisation who champion the inclusion of South Asian women and families living in Edinburgh.\n\nThis National Lottery Heritage Funded project aims to develop community understanding of the history, diversity and changing nature of religion in Scotland over the last 100 years.\n\nSouth Asian women's groups have visited the museum to explore objects connected to Scottish belief and religion, researched a range of religious buildings in Edinburgh, and recorded their findings and processes through photography and film for an exhibition hosted at the Scottish Storytelling Centre in 2021. Other partners include the National Library of Scotland, the Scottish War Memorial and Media Education.\n\nEgypt's Dispersed Heritage\n\nSince late 2019, we have partnered with the AHRC-funded project Egypt’s Dispersed Heritage, which explores the legacies of British archaeological practice in Egypt, including during the colonial period, and creates opportunities for dialogue around this history.\n\nThe project is sharing information about how artefacts were excavated and exported, as well as amplifying the voices of modern Egyptians through a programme of interventions co-designed and delivered with them. The project also hopes to transform awareness in the UK of modern Egyptian interest in its heritage.\n\nThrough this project, we have shared collections and collecting histories with contemporary Egyptian communities, using online engagement to foster dialogue. We have contributed to collaborations with Egyptian artists, whose creative outputs have transformed and re-Egyptianised narratives around these collections. Some of these are featured on our project webpage, which is also available in Egyptian Arabic.\n\nIn early 2020, we hosted a public event, ‘Egypt, Past and Present in Dialogue’, which is now available online as a podcast.\n\nRead more about the project\n\nBenin Dialogue Group and Digital Benin\n\nIn February 1897, Britain undertook a punitive expedition against Benin, a kingdom located in what is now Nigeria. The invasion was presented as retaliation for the killing of British colonial officials who had entered the kingdom uninvited earlier that year.\n\nBritish soldiers looted thousands of objects of immense cultural value from the royal city, many of which were sold to pay for the venture. Today, most of these objects are in European and American museums.\n\nThere are 74 objects in the collection of National Museums Scotland which are believed to be connected to the 1897 expedition.\n\nAs a member of the Benin Dialogue Group, we are committed to sharing information and knowledge and working towards a major reunion of the Benin works of art in Benin City. We are also working with the Digital Benin project to understand and share more about the provenance of the Benin objects in our care.\n\nThe Benin Dialogue Group is a collaborative working group that brings together museum directors and delegates from Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom with representatives of the Edo State Government, the Royal Court of Benin, and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments, Nigeria.\n\nScotland's relationship with the Caribbean\n\nWe are collaborating with Lisa Williams, Director of the Edinburgh Caribbean Association and Honorary Fellow in the department of History, Classics and Archaeology at the University of Edinburgh to explore what museum collections reveal about Britain’s and Scotland’s role in the Transatlantic slave system and the experiences of enslaved people. Lisa offers her perspective on the stories of some of the objects in the collection in an article on Scotland and the Caribbean."
