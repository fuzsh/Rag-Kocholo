        "text": "Collections are our cultural memory and creative future\n\nCAMD museum collections include well over 56 million objects which range from early animal specimens through to the latest tablet computer.\n\nThese collections encapsulate a nation’s past knowledge, its changing attitudes, advancing technologies and its interactions with the world.\n\nCollections encompass and protect our ‘cultural memory’, which can be understood as the wisdom and understandings of past cultures transmitted from one generation to the next.\n\nThe objects within collections can also provide us with reference points from the past and springboards for new ideas and new forms of cultural expression and innovation.\n\nNational Treasures/National Collections\n\nMuseums hold their collections in trust for the nation. These collections are highly valuable and contain many irreplaceable specimens and objects.\n\nThe larger part of Australia and New Zealand’s national cultural and natural science collections, are in State/Territory or regional museums, many of which were established in the 19th or earlier 20th centuries. More recently, exemplary national museums have also been established. Together these organisations represent the distributed national collections of each country.\n\nMuseums and Schools\n\nMuseums today are an integral part of the education system. They work side by side with governments, schools and communities to complement formal education classes and the informal learning done outside the schoolroom.\n\nOver the last decade, 23 million students and their teachers have sought to deepen the learning process through a school group visit to a CAMD museum.\n\nMuseums appeal as sites of learning because they:\n\noffer unique learning experiences;\n\nare trusted, authoritative sources;\n\nutilise ‘real’ objects from collections – their genuine character ever more valued in an increasingly ‘virtual’ age;\n\nallow visitors to experience great ‘hands-on’ learning experiences that excite all five senses; and\n\nare also exciting spaces, incorporating cutting-edge design and the use of multi-media technologies.\n\nMuseums are still places that can invoke excitement and wonder amongst young and old alike.\n\nWhen relationships with an international power are important, often it is through an exchange of ‘stories’ that connection and mutual understanding is explored.\n\nForeign dignitaries visiting Australia or New Zealand, are invariably taken by their hosts to one or more leading museum. Museums play a significant role in this type of public diplomacy as they provide a site of great symbolism where a nation’s history, environment and culture can be shared and ‘national stories’ exchanged.\n\nMuseums often build up special relationships with other countries over many years as has been the case, for example, with the Australian National Maritime Museum and the USA; Questacon – the National Science and Technology Centre and Japan; and the Western Australian Museum and the Dutch Government, amongst many others.\n\nMuseums are amongst the most democratic of cultural institutions. They tell our national stories, memorialize our triumphs and tragedies, preserve our traditions, encourage a thirst for knowledge about others and knit together different generations and cultures.\n\nThe major museums within CAMD work with and celebrate the diverse cultural groups which make up 21st-century Australia. This partnership contributes to building vibrant and cohesive communities.\n\nCelebrating Indigenous Culture\n\nCAMD museums work closely with Indigenous groups to protect and promote understanding at home and abroad of the rich cultural practices, beliefs and aspirations of Indigenous people in the Australasian region.\n\nThe major museums have worked for some time with local Indigenous communities to develop policies for the display and care of Indigenous cultural materials. In some cases, Australian museums incorporate Keeping Places and New Zealand institutions have Maori Marae within their walls.\n\nResearch\n\nMuseums and their collections provide a critical research resource that generates ground-breaking in-house research projects and collaborations with other research agencies and academies.\n\nThese interactions occur across the sciences and humanities and in nationally and globally significant areas such as climate change, bio-security, biodiversity, cultural identity and resource management.\n\nIn 2013-14, CAMD museums participated in and generated new knowledge through over 266 grant-funded research projects worth more than $18m (AUD).\n\nIn the same period, museum scientists and researchers made close to 785 presentations and released more than 1,000 scholarly publications.\n\nInnovation and Design\n\nMuseums provide inspirational sources and nurture the development and application of innovative ideas. This occurs not only in scientific research but in the cultural sphere.\n\nThe lines along which creativity and innovation proceed are anything but linear; they involve immersion in ideas and research across institutions and disciplines, opportunities to sample information and objects from a wide spectrum and the freedom to use and adapt the knowledge gained.\n\nMuseums provide a hugely important resource for the artists, designers, inventors and craftspeople working in traditional mediums and the digital arts. This reflects their role as sources of ‘cultural memory’. They offer exhibitions that generate and celebrate new work. A number of CAMD museums also offer themselves as sites for further education, training and networking in the creative arena.\n\nThe attraction of such programs, particularly for the young, can be seen, for example, in the thousands attending talks, markets, workshops and exhibitions staged by the Powerhouse Museum during the Sydney Design Festival each year."
