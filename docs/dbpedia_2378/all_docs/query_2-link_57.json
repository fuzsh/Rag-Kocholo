        "text": "Executive summary\n\nThis is the fourth Museum Partnership Report and covers the reporting period 2020/21. The purpose of this report is to understand the extent of partnership activities undertaken by the national museums and the impact of these in the UK and internationally. As with the 2018/19 and 2019/20 reports, the national museums have been surveyed on their collection sharing activities. However, this year the survey has been expanded to include a broader range of partnership activities similar to the inaugural report covering 2017/18. The museums were asked questions on the following areas of partnership work:\n\nThere are natural crossovers in many of these areas. For example, a project aimed at developing skills may also have positive impacts on learning and education, or on participation. Or a digital project developed in response to the pandemic may have had impacts on the health and wellbeing of participants. The museums were asked to input activities into the area which they felt most represented the purpose of the project. With that in mind, the numbers quoted in this section of the report should be seen as indicative rather than comprehensive given that some projects could in principle fit into several sections. Further details of how partnership projects can contribute to multiple outcomes are explored further in the case studies. Returns were received from all 22 museums surveyed. However, the National Museum of the Royal Navy was not able to submit the second part of the survey (covering other partnerships, not collections based) this year.\n\nKey findings for 2020/21, unsurprisingly, show that most activities were impacted by the pandemic in some way. In particular, sharing collections activities were affected and many exhibitions were cancelled or postponed. Therefore the numbers are significantly lower than in previous years for these activities. In 2020/21 the national museums undertook 1,214 loans (both long and short term) of 19,150 objects in the UK. There were 346 loans of 4,997 objects lent internationally. This gives a total of 1,560 loans out (a 32% decrease on 2019/20) of 24,147 objects (a 66% decrease on 2019/20). However, numbers reported for other types of partnership activity that could be pivoted more easily to online provision are more or less on par with the 2017/18 report. The museums also reported significant numbers of partnerships developed during the pandemic in response to audience needs - many with the aim of encouraging participation and targeting issues around health and wellbeing.\n\nMap and list of national museums\n\nFigure 1: The 75 sites of the 22 national museums included in this report\n\nSee an interactive map of Figure 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nPartnership activities by their nature can be particularly vulnerable to external events. The reporting year 2020/21 saw extreme disruption to the usual activities of museums caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. National lockdown measures legally came into force on 23 March 2020 and lasted until 4 July . There were subsequent regional lockdowns and restrictions followed by a second national lockdown in the Autumn of 2020 with a third national lockdown announced on 4 January 2021. Restrictions eased in the spring of 2021. During periods of reopening, museums were also severely impacted by capacity restrictions and reduced staffing levels due to furlough, isolation or sickness. Therefore activities held during the entirety of this reporting period have been impacted to some extent.\n\nEqually the capacity of partners or potential partners to enter into projects was highly impacted in similar ways - due to national and regional lockdowns, capacity restrictions and reduced staffing levels. Where projects were able to go ahead, they were often adapted for online presentation or conducted locally to manage risks associated with potential travel disruption for participants, as well as difficulties and delays in the transport of objects depending on the situation in the various partner countries.\n\nNaturally the data collected for this year should not be considered as ‘usual’ and comparisons with previous reporting years are somewhat academic due to the impact on museums’ operations. Delivery on the same scale and in the same formats as seen in previous years would be impossible. However the data collected for this year still has value, and not just in evidencing the impact of the pandemic. The case studies in particular demonstrate how museums not only changed the delivery method of pre-planned programmes, but developed new projects in response to audience needs. The types of partnerships reported also demonstrate how the national museums target programming to meet the specific needs of audiences, and the efforts made to include groups that in general tend to interact with museums less frequently.[footnote 1]\n\nSharing collections\n\nSharing collections is one of the key ways in which the national museums partner with other museums and organisations in the UK and across the world. Sharing collections enables more people to enjoy and learn from the national collection and furthers research and scholarship. It was anticipated that this area of museum work would be highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns. Many exhibitions in the UK and abroad were cancelled or postponed during the reporting year and significant disruption to travel meant that many international loans in particular did not go ahead as planned. When museums and exhibitions were able to open, numbers of visitors were restricted to enable social distancing. Despite these challenges, at least 5.9 million people, in the UK and abroad, saw the national collection on display in 2020/21.\n\nFigure 2: Number of loans out\n\nSee chart of total numbers of loans out in 2020/21.\n\nNumber of loans Total Total number of loans out (long and short loans, UK and international) during 2020/21 1,560 Total number of objects on loan (long and short loans, UK and international) during 2020/21 24,147 Total number of research loans out during 2020/21 6,179 Total number of objects on research loan 139,980\n\nThe table below summarises the total number of loans out reported annually since the inaugural report which covered the financial year 2017/18:\n\n2017/18 (17 museums surveyed) 2018/19(22 museums surveyed ) 2019/20 (22 museums surveyed 2020/21 (22 museums surveyed) % Difference from previous year No. of objects lent out by national museums for display (UK + International, long and short term loans) 69,501 68,049 71,205 24,147 -66% No. of venues that national museums lent to for display (UK + international, long and short term loans) 2,110 2,049 2,290 1,560 -32% No. of people that have seen loans out for display (UK + international) 32.9 million 32.8 million 35.7 million 5.9 million -83% No. of objects lent out by national museums for research (UK + international) 370,982 316,064 499,973 139,890 -72% No. of institutions that national museums lent to for research (UK + international) 6,777 6,314 6,423 6,179 -4%\n\nThe table above demonstrates that where numbers on the whole had been increasing or remaining at a similar level between 2017/18 and 2019/20, there were significant falls for 2020/21 as expected. There was a 32% drop in loans out for display purposes, and an 83% drop in reported visitor figures.\n\nFunding\n\nAs seen in previous years, the majority of collections sharing activities are funded by the museums themselves. Costs are incurred by both borrower and lender including transportation, packing, conservation, display and courier costs. Some additional support was reported for touring exhibitions, for example, the Dorset Foundation supported the British Museum’s ‘Nordic by Nature: modern design and prints’ exhibition.\n\nA total of 60 projects (outgoing and on site exhibitions) were reported as being supported using Museums and Galleries Exhibitions Tax Relief. The aim of this tax relief is to encourage museums and galleries to develop high quality new temporary, touring and permanent exhibitions and galleries and to display their collections to a wider audience, supporting British culture across the UK. As part of the Government’s continued support for current and future projects within museums and galleries, the Exhibitions Tax Relief saw a significant temporary increase in tax relief for all upcoming exhibitions commencing from 27th October 2021. In addition to the temporary uplift, the sunset clause was also extended until 31 March 2024. The uplift is a core part of the government’s support for the recovery of the sector and it is hoped that future partnership reports will indicate that museums across the sector have made full use of these extensions.\n\nSharing collections in the UK\n\nThe museums reported that at least 1.3 million people saw their collections on display outside of their permanent sites in the UK in 2020/21. Visitor figures were reported for 9% of long loans out and 72% of short loans out (including touring exhibitions) so as with numbers reported in previous years, the real figure is likely to be much higher. However this still represents a significant drop (94%) from the just over 22 million visitors reported in 2019/20. This is not unexpected considering the impact of national lockdowns and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe national museums reported 421,449 visitors to their outgoing touring exhibitions in the UK during 2020/21. A total of 29 unique exhibitions or displays travelled to 42 venues in the UK during 2020/21. The projects ranged in size and scale from a single object to over 400. Touring exhibitions take time and often have significant costs in development. Partner venues sometimes pay a fee in order to host them. With that in mind, cancellation is likely to be a last resort for all partners concerned. This may explain why the numbers for this sort of exchange might seem quite high considering the circumstances. By comparison, in 2019/20 the national museums toured 35 unique exhibitions to 74 venues in the UK.\n\n49 short loans out were reported to have travelled to new partners (organisations to which the national museums had not previously lent) and five long loans out were reported as travelling to new partners. Eight touring exhibitions travelled to partner organisations the organising national had not partnered with before. This gives a total of 62 new partners out of 1,214 partners reported - 5.1%. This shows that the majority of loans in the UK travel to museums or organisations with which the national museum has an existing relationship and that loans are often repeated between partner museums once a relationship has been established.\n\nThere were 76 loans out reported (74 long and two short) for which no postcode data was returned. In many instances the data was simply omitted from the survey although in some cases, in particular with loans from the military museums, the loan travelled to military offices or is even situated on board a naval vessel for which a postcode was either not available or inappropriate to supply.\n\nThe table below compares total numbers of loans out reported in 2020/21 to 2019/20.\n\nTotal short loans out (including touring exhibitions)UK 2020/21 Total short loans out (including touring exhibitions)UK 2019/20 Total long loans out UK 2020/21 Total long loans out UK 2019/20 185 641 1,029 893\n\nThe table below compares total numbers of objects on loan reported in 2020/21 to 2019/20.\n\nTotal number of objects on short loan out (including touring exhibitions) 2020/21 Total number of objects on short loan out (including touring exhibitions) 2019/20 Total number of objects on long loan out 2020/21 Total number of objects on long loan out 2019/20 3,236 9,517 15,914 50,353\n\nWho borrowed from the national museums in 2020/21?\n\nThe chart below shows the types of organisations which borrowed from the national museums (on both long and short term loan) during 2020/21:\n\nType of museum Long-term 20-21 Short term 20-21 Total Independent museum 261 59 320 Local authority museum 196 41 237 National museum 124 52 176 Military 115 2 117 Other* 95 2 97 National Trust 55 0 55 Heritage railway 40 0 40 University 39 25 64 Government 32 1 33 English Heritage 26 0 26 HRP 15 0 15 Historic Environment Scotland 6 0 6 Private 6 2 8 School 6 0 6 Cadw 4 0 4 Hospital 4 0 4 Library and archive 3 1 4 Religious 1 0 1 Royal Collection 1 0 1\n\n*‘Other’ includes loans to businesses, charities, trusts, societies and associations not described in other categories.\n\nThe data shows that independent museums were the most frequent borrowers from the national collections, followed by local authority museums and then the national museums lending to each other. This breakdown mirrors what we have seen in previous years, and is likely to reflect the fact that independent museums are the largest subset of museum type in the sector. Military museums, sites and individuals also receive a significant portion of loans, no doubt reflecting the inclusion of the MOD funded museums in the survey.\n\nShort loans out\n\nIn 2020/21 there were 185 short loans out of 3,236 objects in the UK. Out of these totals, 42 projects were touring exhibitions consisting of 1,765 objects. As the tables above demonstrate, this is a significant drop from 2019/20 as to be expected.\n\nFigure 6: Total short loans out received by region 2020/21\n\nSee an interactive map showing short loans out received by UK region.\n\nRegion Total number of loans Percentage of total London 76 41 Scotland 13 7 South East England 20 11 South West England 15 8 North West England 14 8 Yorkshire and the Humber 8 4 East of England 7 4 Wales 4 2 West Midlands 8 4 East Midlands 3 2 North East England 10 5 Northern Ireland 5 3\n\nThe map and table above describe the number of short term loans received by region in the UK. Although the total number of short loans out during 2020/21 was far lower than in the previous years, it is interesting to note that the regions in receipt of the greatest percentage of the total remain the same: Greater London, followed by South East England. This is possibly due to there being an overall larger number of museums in these areas, and the national museums supporting each other through loans. In 2019/20 North West England was in receipt of the third highest number of short loans out. However in 2020/21 it is South West England by a narrow margin (15 loans out to South West as opposed to 14 to North West).\n\nLong loans out\n\nIn 2020/21 the national museums reported 1,029 long loans out in the UK, totalling 15,914 objects. These totals seem unusual in that the number of total loans appears to have grown but the total number of objects on loan significantly decreased. Only five long loan partners were identified as being new for 2020/21 so it is unlikely that there has been a significant increase in loans out. It is more likely that loans that were otherwise due for return were extended due to the pandemic, and discrepancies in the reporting.\n\nFigure 7: Total long loans out received by region 2020/21\n\nSee an interactive map of long loans out received by region.\n\nRegion Number of long loans out Percentage of total London 228 22 Scotland 141 14 South East England 107 10 South West England 90 9 North West England 74 7 Yorkshire and the Humber 59 6 East of England 48 5 Wales 53 5 West Midlands 39 4 East Midlands 45 4 North East England 31 3 Northern Ireland 38 4\n\nOrganisations in Greater London (22%) are in receipt of the highest number of long loans out, followed by Scotland (14%) and then the South East (10%).\n\nLoans in\n\nThe national museums frequently borrow from other museums, organisations and individuals in the UK for their own exhibitions. In 2020/21 144 short term loans in were reported, totalling 1,533 objects. The majority were reported to originate from Greater London, followed by North West England and Scotland. It is worth noting that 11 short term loans totalling 395 objects were reported as ‘unknown’ in origin. This is because they were from private lenders whose data cannot be shared.\n\nSharing collections internationally\n\nDespite the significant travel disruption caused by the pandemic, the national museums still undertook 243 short loans out internationally in 2020/21. 63 of these loans were reported as having travelled to new partner organisations the museum had not worked with previously, representing 26% of the total. They reported 103 international long term loans out. Germany received the highest number of short term loans out (39) followed by France (36) and the USA (26). The USA was in receipt of the highest number of international long term loans, followed by Ireland. However it should be noted that many of these loans were already in place prior to the start of the reporting period so are less impacted by the pandemic. Again the data appears to show an increase in the overall numbers of long term loans out. This could also partially be due to existing loans out being extended as a result of travel restrictions.\n\nFigure 8: International loans out (long and short) during 2020/21\n\nSee an interactive map of international loans out (long and short) during 2020/21\n\nCountry (not including UK) Number of long-term loans Number of short-term loans Australia 6 6 Austria 5 Bahrain 1 Belgium 8 11 Botswana 1 Canada 4 3 Channel Islands 7 China 8 Czech Republic 1 Denmark 2 7 Finland 1 3 France 7 36 Germany 5 39 Greece 1 Hungary 1 India 4 Ireland 15 8 Israel 1 Italy 1 20 Japan 1 12 South Korea 1 Luxembourg 1 Netherlands 8 15 New Zealand 2 4 Norway 1 Oman 2 Poland 1 Portugal 1 Qatar 1 1 Russia 4 South Africa 3 Spain 3 15 Sweden 3 Switzerland 8 United Arab Emirates 1 USA 19 26 Zimbabwe 1 Total 103 243\n\nNational Museums NI: Willie Doherty: Where/Dove\n\nIn 2019, following on from an Italian networking opportunity facilitated by the British Council as they prepared for their UK/Italy 2020 Season, National Museums NI began working on a major new exhibition in partnership with Fondazione Modena Arti Visive (FMAV). Willie Doherty: Where/Dove was to be one of the most extensive and ambitious exhibitions to date dedicated to the work of Willie Doherty (b. Derry, 1959), Northern Ireland’s foremost contemporary artist. The exhibition, focussing on the theme of borders, was due to open first in Modena in 2020 and then in Belfast in early 2021, as part of the wider ‘100 Years Forward’ programme marking the centenaries of the partition of Ireland and the creation of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic then intervened, and as the exhibition development process became more challenging and uncertain, the exhibition theme took on new relevance and urgency. Co-curated, remotely and during a time of pandemic, and coinciding with the UK leaving the European Union, it represented a coming together of Northern Ireland and Italy, a valuable collaboration across borders. Such collaboration was tested through multiple rescheduling and the trials of navigating the post-Brexit processes for the movement of artworks as they apply to Northern Ireland. Bringing together loans from across the island of Ireland, Italy and Switzerland, and responding to and encouraging us to think deeply about recent and current events both at home and abroad, the exhibition was a truly international endeavour, and a celebration of the importance of promoting artistic achievement and partnerships across borders.\n\nInternational touring exhibitions\n\nThere were 59 international touring exhibitions reported for 2020/21 totalling 3,442 objects. 19 of these travelled to venues that the museum had not worked with before, representing 32% of the total. This is a higher proportion of new partners when compared with the UK data as described above. However, the international market for loans and touring exhibitions is much larger than in the UK. Not all of these touring projects involved traditional collection sharing; demonstrating the different approaches museums can take to tour exhibitions. For example, nine international venues received Science Museums Group’s Blueprint Touring Packs.This method of touring shares the Science Museum Group’s content, concept, designs and intellectual property in a way that allows other venues to reproduce their exhibitions without having to borrow any objects. These are usually contemporary science exhibitions. So although technically not sharing collections, this approach still enables partnership working and sharing of ideas and concepts internationally. Similarly, images from the Natural History Museum’s popular Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition travelled to 18 international venues. Over 2.5 million people visited a touring exhibition created by the national museums internationally in 2020/21.\n\nInternational loans in\n\nThe national museums also borrowed objects from abroad to supplement their own exhibitions and displays. They reported 31 short term loans in of 258 objects and 188 long term loans in of 2,633 objects. As previously stated, the majority of long term loans were already in situ and were not subject to the same disruption as short term loans due to the pandemic.\n\nSharing collections for research\n\nResearch loans out 2020/21 Research loans out 2019/20 Research loans out total object numbers 2020/21 Research loans out total object numbers 2019/20 6,179 6,423 139,890 499,973\n\nThere were 6,179 research loans out of 139,890 objects in 2020/21. 99.5% of these loans originated from the Natural History Museum. There were 892 loans out totalling 72,973 objects within the UK and 5,287 loans of 66,917 objects were international. This is on par with previous reporting years, reflecting that research loans were not impacted by the pandemic in the same way as display loans. This is largely due to the fact that they are usually not intended for public display and therefore have less demanding requirements for travel, conservation and storage. In addition, the Natural History Museum also lent 1,702 digital surrogates to organisations around the world for the purposes of research.\n\nAs seen in previous years, the geographical spread of research loans is wider than that of display loans. In 2020/21 a total of 79 countries outside of the UK received research loans from the national museums, whereas 40 countries received display loans. This echoes the data from 2019/20 where 85 countries received research loans as opposed to 49 countries receiving display loans. As stated in previous years, the reasons for this are likely to lie in the less onerous display and transport requirements for research loans.\n\nFigure 10: Research loans out during 2020/21\n\nSee interactive map of research loans out during 2020/21.\n\nCountry Number of loans Argentina 43 Armenia 3 Australia 213 Austria 80 Belarus 3 Belgium 145 Bolivia 1 Brazil 202 Bulgaria 11 Canada 133 Chile 3 China 72 Colombia 4 Costa Rica 5 Croatia 1 Czech Republic 392 Denmark 77 Ecuador 1 Egypt 1 Estonia 6 Finland 51 France 253 Georgia 3 Germany 545 Greece 5 Guyana 5 Hungary 58 Iceland 1 India 28 Indonesia 8 Iran 2 Ireland 28 Israel 18 Italy 186 Japan 138 Kenya 1 South Korea 30 Latvia 8 Lithuania 8 Luxembourg 2 Macedonia 2 Malaysia 10 Malta 3 Mexico 59 Netherlands 110 New Zealand 67 Nigeria 1 Norway 65 Oman 1 Pakistan 6 Panama 2 Papua New Guinea 2 Peru 3 Philippines 2 Poland 176 Portugal 22 Qatar 1 Romania 12 Russia 144 Saudi Arabia 2 Singapore 54 Slovakia 14 Slovenia 2 South Africa 106 Spain 133 Sri Lanka 1 Sweden 175 Switzerland 97 Taiwan 20 Thailand 16 Tunisia 1 Turkey 8 Ukraine 11 UK 892 USA 1163 Uruguay 2 Venezuela 10 Vietnam 2 Zimbabwe 1 Unknown 7\n\nThe countries in receipt of the highest number of research loans in 2020/21 were as follows:\n\nUSA 1,163 Germany 545 Czech Republic 392 France 253 Australia 213\n\nAcquisitions\n\nThe national museums supported 59 acquisitions of over 189 objects during the reporting period. Their roles ranged from acting in an advisory capacity to administrating specific acquisition funds. In addition, The British Museum supported the acquisition of objects via the treasure process during 2020/21.[footnote 2] Details are included in the Treasure Annual Report, which is published online. There is a time lag on treasure acquisitions data due to the complexity of the process and to allow for museums to apply for grants or raise funds through public appeals for example. So complete data for 2020/21 will not be available until 2023.\n\nShared services\n\nThis section of the survey was added for this reporting period. The purpose of this question is so that we can better understand how the national museums work together and with others to make best use of limited resources. Unlike the other questions in the survey, this question is not aimed necessarily at public facing activities but aims more to uncover how partnerships can support museum infrastructure and operations. Examples could include shared storage spaces, contracts for services such as catering or museum transport or even staff or contractors that work across sites. Sharing services can benefit museums by spreading costs between partners, enabling the sharing of expertise and making more efficient use of resources.\n\n16 instances of shared services were reported. The majority (six) were shared storage - all with other national museums. There were five instances where the national museums reported sharing access to specialist staff (e.g. a conservator) and five instances where the shared service was categorised as ‘other’. Activities reported under ‘other’ included shared transport and security contracts for the Blythe House decant, shared use of equipment for conservation analysis and for the production of digital resources.\n\nSharing knowledge\n\nThe national museums are centres of expertise for the collections in their care. Museum and collections-based research is interdisciplinary, spanning the arts and humanities, sciences, digital technology, and conservation and heritage science. They are also sector leaders in many of the aspects of museum management and operations. The national museums engage in a variety of activities designed to share, develop and expand upon that knowledge. 11 national museums hold Independent Research Organisation (IRO) status, recognising their role in generating new knowledge and giving them access to research council funding in the same way as universities.\n\nMuseums undertake a variety of activities with the aim of sharing knowledge. For the 2020/21 survey, the museums were asked to report on networks, training and development and academic partnerships.\n\nNetworks\n\nThere are many formal and informal networks which support the museum sector, contributing to the sharing of knowledge, skills and expertise. The national museums were asked to report on networks in which they participated in a formal capacity - as leaders, founders and institutional members. Networks enable the sharing of knowledge, ideas and best practice amongst members. It is worth noting that many museum staff participate in networks as part of their individual professional development, which is beyond the scope of this survey.\n\nThe national museums reported instances of participating in 438 networks in total in 2020/21. In 2017/18 The national museums reported 326 instances of being members, founders, and leaders of groups and networks which support the museum sector so this number represents an increase of 26%. The table below shows the types of network the national museums most frequently participate in.\n\nGrand Total 438 Other 136 SSN 112 Working group 75 Advisory board 54 Type not reported 36 Informal 25\n\nThe national museums participate in a range of networks in different capacities. Examples of networks reported under ‘Other’ range from participation in membership organisations such as the Museums Association or the UK Registrars Group to specialist networks that are not official Subject Specialist Networks (SSN). Almost 26% of the total number of instances of participating in networks reported were Subject Specialist Networks, 112 in total. SSNs cover a wide range of subject areas and provide guidance about collections, acquisitions, preservation, access, and research. The national museums report participation in SSNs ranging in scale and subject matter- from in excess of 700 members to around 20 and covering a wide range of topics including videogame heritage, scientific instruments and the decorative arts.\n\nOther examples of the types of networks participated in by the national museums include working groups, advisory boards, round tables and steering groups. A variety of funding sources for networks were reported, including support from funding bodies such as Arts Council England, AHRC/UKRI and Art Fund or through membership subscriptions. It is worth noting that the survey captures formal networking, however the national museums also often provide informal advice to other organisations on a variety of subjects. The museums were asked to report on any disruption caused by the pandemic to their network activities. Many reported activities moving online, however some activities were postponed or stopped completely.\n\nTraining and development\n\nSharing expertise and delivering projects aimed at supporting professional development is one way in which the national museums support the sector more widely. In this section of the survey, the museums were asked to report on staff secondments (internationally and within the UK) and on training sessions and programmes, workshops, sector-facing conferences and study days they had offered to external participants from the museum and adjacent sectors (for example heritage, conservation science etc) to develop skills. The museums were also asked to report on the number of apprenticeships they had hosted during the reporting period.\n\nStaff secondments enable the sharing of institutional knowledge and expertise, as well as presenting a development opportunity for individuals. However the data shows that most of the planned staff secondments for the reporting period were cancelled or postponed due to the pandemic. Most secondments are of a residential nature and difficult to replicate online, so this is not surprising.\n\nExamples of training provided fared much better, largely due to the ability to pivot to online provision and the museums reported a number of workshops, lectures, talks and training courses they were able to deliver in 2020/21. Some reported a small charge for participants but the majority were reported as being free. Over 110,000 people participated in these events during 2020/21. Arguably, delivering such sessions online overcame some barriers to participation such as travel time and cost and space limitations of lecture halls or training rooms. However online provision can be problematic for specific collections or conservation based training that is best delivered in person with access to objects and some instances of training of this type were reported as being cancelled or postponed.\n\nThe National Army Museum runs a training programme specifically for Regimental and Corps Museums in the UK. They work with over 140 museums and collections to provide relevant training in museum best practice.\n\nBy hosting apprenticeships, the national museums support the talent pipeline, encourage entry into the sector and provide career development opportunities for participants. There are over 700 apprenticeship standards with a number of different areas relevant to museum work. Data shows that overall, the number of people starting apprenticeships in England during 2020/21 fell. However, 15 of the national museums reported supporting a total of 66 apprenticeships or traineeships across their sites during 2020/21. This is on par with numbers reported in 2017/18 which is perhaps surprising given the wider context for 2020/21 where many museums had to furlough or reduce staff to deal with the financial impacts of the pandemic. In many instances, the museums report having to adapt programmes to account for home working and restricted access to libraries and research materials.\n\nFigure 11: Apprenticeships and traineeships 2020/21\n\nSee chart showing areas of museum work the apprenticeship or traineeship was intended to support\n\nCategory Number of apprenticeships supported FOH 18 Curatorial 10 Collections management 5 Conservation 5 HR 5 Leadership 5 Business administration 2 Data analysis 2 IT 2 Libraries and archives 2 Operations 2 Other 2 Publishing 2 Development 1 Digital 1 Finance 1 Marketing 1\n\nThe data above shows the total number of apprenticeships supported in each category. The data shows that the majority of apprenticeships and traineeships hosted by the national museums in 2020/21 were aimed at developing customer service/ front of house skills. However, curatorial skills were also well represented. Apprenticeships also covered ‘back of house’ topics like HR and management/leadership.\n\nAcademic partnerships\n\nMuseums are a key part of research infrastructure for the arts and humanities in the UK, and they often collaborate on research projects with universities, higher education institutions, research organisations and other museums. This research develops collection knowledge and feeds into a multitude of outputs including publications, lecture series and exhibitions. 11 of the museums surveyed have IRO (Independent Research Organisation) status. This status enables them to access research funding which other museums are unable to access directly. By working in partnership and collaborating with other organisations, the museums can ensure that this support for research and development is spread more widely across the sector. The museums were surveyed on their academic partnerships. They were asked to report on ​​research projects that they participated in with partners (e.g., with other universities, libraries, museums or research organisations) and the number of doctoral students they co-hosted.\n\nIn 2017/18 the national museums reported working with external partners on at least 1,325 active research projects and collaborations involving 348 UK partners and 1,404 international partners. In 2020/21 the national museums reported as having co-hosted 350 doctoral students through programmes such as collaborative PhDs or PhD placements. This shows an increase on the 2017/18 figures where they reported co-hosting 287 doctoral students. In 2020/21 the vast majority of university partners were in the UK, although there were 12 international collaborations reported. The overwhelming majority were funded through AHRC/UKRI — 87% of the total number of projects. Other sources of funding reported include the university partners and some trusts and foundations such as the Wellcome Trust.\n\nResearch projects covered a wider and varied range of topics. For example, Project Coral, led by the Horniman Aquarium, is a project with international partners to develop techniques to stimulate coral reproduction. The Wallace Collection is undertaking a multiyear project to research and conserve five of their famous Fragonard paintings and the Science Museum is participating in Move2Learn, a three year project with researcher-practitioner teams across six museum sites in the UK and USA. The project aims to investigate the links between ‘movement and learning’ at selected science exhibits designed for young learners.\n\nFigure 12: Funding\n\nSee chart showing how collaborative PhD projects were funded during 2020/21\n\nFunding Percentage of overall funding AHRC/UKRI 87% Other* 13%\n\n*‘Other’ includes trusts and foundations and directly from the university.\n\nAudience development and participation\n\nThe national museums engage in a wide range of partnership activities aimed at expanding audience participation. By partnering with organisations across sectors, they are able to target programming to attract new audiences and support social outcomes in their local communities and in the UK.\n\nIn 2017/18 the museums were able to report nearly 350 different partnerships that improve audience participation and social outcomes. For 2020/21 the museums reported a total of 324 projects with a total of 607 partners across the areas of participation, health and wellbeing, skills and careers and learning and education. As suggested in the 2017/18 report, the work the museums do in this area is broad, operating at many scales and in a range of contexts. Therefore these figures are representative rather than comprehensive.\n\nFigure 14: Types of partnerships\n\nSee chart of partnership types aimed at supporting audience participation and social outcomes.\n\nPartnership type Percentage of total partnerships Participation 43% Learning and education 36% Skills and careers 11% Health and wellbeing 10%\n\nParticipation\n\nThe national museums reported 140 projects aimed at improving audience participation, working with 270 partner organisations for 2020/21.\n\nThe majority of these partnerships were with community groups. Other partners reported were with local authorities, charities and social care organisations, demonstrating the extent to which museums partner across different sectors to address audience needs.\n\nFigure 16: Most commonly reported type of partner organisation for projects aimed at participation\n\nSee chart shows the most commonly reported type of partner organisation for projects aimed at participation.\n\nType of organisation Percentage reported Community groups 24% Other 23% Charities 15% Arts organisations 9% University 9% Social care organisations 6% Local authorities 5% Museums 5%\n\nMuseums were asked whether there was a specific target audience their project was intended to reach. The most commonly reported was local communities (25%) - meaning groups or individuals in the geographical location of the museum. 11% were reported as specifically targeting people identifying as black, Asian or minority ethnic and 7% as people with special educational needs and disabilities. Other projects reported were intended to engage young people and families, older adults, people experiencing loneliness or social isolation and people identifying as LGBTQI+. The museums reported that over 17,000 people participated in programming aimed at increasing audience participation during 2020/21.\n\nHealth and wellbeing\n\nResearch suggests that art interventions can have a positive impact on health and wellbeing. The national museums reported partnering with a range of organisations, including charities, hospitals, care homes and community groups to deliver activities, events and programmes aimed at improving the health and wellbeing of participants.\n\nThe national museums reported a total of 31 events, projects or activities with a total of 53 partner organisations aimed at improving health and wellbeing. Over 9,000 people are reported as having participated in these activities during 2020/21. The museums report that some activities were pre-planned and had to be adapted to be held online due to the pandemic. They also reported that some activities (almost 20%) were specifically developed in response to the pandemic. This is not surprising given the circumstances - with a spotlight on the work of healthcare providers across the country and concerns about the impact of lockdown on vulnerable groups. For example The British Museum report hosting online activities for local communities in Camden aimed at tackling social isolation during lockdown. Royal Museums Greenwich delivered online workshops for people with dementia and the RAF Museum organised museum-themed gift parcels for local families at Christmas.\n\nFigure 18: Percentage of health and/or wellbeing concerns reported\n\nSee chart showing the specific health and/or wellbeing issues and concerns the reported activities were designed to support\n\nHealth and/or wellbeing concern Percentage reported General health and wellbeing 38% Loneliness and social isolation 26% Dementia 15% Mental health 11% People in a care-giving environment (in-patients, care homes) 8% Carers 2%\n\nNational Museums Liverpool: On the Road\n\nThe Museum of Liverpool focuses on Liverpool’s social history and community heritage, its national and global significance. Through their pioneering dementia care programme House of Memories, in June 2021, they launched the world’s first immersive mobile museum experience On the Road, designed specifically for elders and people living with dementia. The initiative was developed in consultation with a diverse range of health, private and voluntary sector partners, and most importantly, the dementia community. The approach is of great value to museum and social care institutions and networks interested in cultural care methodology and the development of museum social prescribing.\n\nOn The Road provides an innovative virtual “front door” to the Museum of Liverpool’s collections. It is a unique digital museum experience, designed specifically to foster older people’s positive health and wellbeing. The programme’s content is co-created with stakeholders from across the dementia community and social care sectors. The process is centred around the person living with dementia; the design of digital activities is influenced and driven by their input and guidance; their lived experience is acknowledged throughout and an integral part of the continued development of the project.\n\nOn The Road takes the Museum of Liverpool into known disadvantaged neighbourhoods and settings across Liverpool to deliver an interactive museum experience designed to enable conversations about shared histories linked to the Museum and personal memories. It is a 30 sqm mobile space that opens into an interactive immersive cinema. Participants experience 3D immersive scenes, such as the Liverpool Overhead Railway, local streets and a 1950’s corner shop; where sound, visuals and smells evoke precious memories of days gone by. For example: the museum recreated a journey on the Liverpool Overhead Railway using moving images, film footage of the passing dockyards, sounds of the train wheels on the track, the horn and the guard’s voice. The experience is further enhanced through the use of physical props, such as the issuing of paper tickets and costume, and through access support to help with visual and hearing impairment needs, helping participants navigate the immersive experience. The target audience is people living with dementia and older people experiencing loneliness and social isolation.\n\nOn the Road presents new possibilities for museum engagement and healthy ageing in the heart of the community, through connecting digital museum collections and memories, artworks, music, community celebrations, and museum objects for meaningful activity that promotes living a culturally rich and happy life. From June-December 2021, they were able to visit a diverse range of care and community settings (despite continued pandemic isolation scenarios) and have plans to tour the city region on a weekly basis. Feedback from participants has been extremely positive.\n\nLearning and education\n\nLearning is at the heart of museums, with many museums identifying delivering education as their primary function. The national museums reported 117 projects aimed at supporting learning and education with 164 partners for 2020/21. Partners included schools, local authorities, universities, arts organisations and charities. They reported that over 95,000 children or young people participated in activities of this type, the majority of them online. Activities ranged from creating or providing resources on a range of curriculum subjects to the delivery of talks or specific activities. Funding came from a variety of sources including charities, trusts and foundations, corporate partners and partner organisations although the museums also reported funding or part funding at least 33 of the reported projects (28% of the total) from their core budgets.\n\nThe British Museum’s Samsung Digital Discovery Centre (SDDC) offers free digital activities for schools and families. The SDDC saw a huge growth in demand during 2020/21 hosting 605 virtual visits up from 68 in 2019/20.\n\nAs seen with other activities, some pre planned events were moved online whereas some activities were created specifically in response to the pandemic. For some events that were able to be hosted on site, some museums reported having to limit numbers to comply with social distancing guidelines.\n\nThe majority of activities reported were aimed at supporting children/young people in the local community (ie. local families, local schools). Others were specifically targeted at children/young people from a low socio-economic background, with special educational needs and disabilities or in a care-giving environment (including hospitals, social care, fostering). It should also be said that in addition the national museums entertain thousands of school visits annually across their sites. Data for the number of facilitated and self-directed visits to the national museums by visitors under 18 in formal education is collated for the DCMS sponsored museums annual performance indicators and is published online.\n\nSkills and careers\n\nThe national museums engage in activities designed to support people in developing skills and their careers, whether to help them enter the workplace or as professional development. There is some natural overlap between these activities and those designed to support museum sector skills as described above. However, the data shows that museums also support skills development in a range of areas beyond the sector. For example the museums report delivering events to support teacher training, small businesses, and to help people develop language skills. The museums reported a total of 36 projects, delivered with 120 partners for this section of the survey.\n\nThe Routes In network is hosted by Tate Young People’s Programme and brings together over 100 individuals from the cultural, education, youth and training sectors to share best practice around creating progression routes for young people into the creative and cultural industries.\n\nResponse to the pandemic\n\nThe 2020/21 survey has captured some of the ways in which museums responded to the pandemic and associated lockdowns. The survey responses show how many pre-planned projects were adapted for online presentation but also how specific activities were designed in response to the needs of local communities and audiences. In fact, the national museums reported a total of 90 new activities, events or initiatives that were not pre-planned, which were created in response to the pandemic during 2020/21. This is no small feat considering that many staff were furloughed or isolating.\n\nActivities undertaken by the national museums included creating downloadable resources to be used by teachers, parents or health practitioners. Some distributed printed activity packs to people’s homes. Many events, talks and workshops were streamed online. Some even developed online exhibitions, for example National Museums Liverpool created ‘Crypto Connections: Exploring the Personal’. This online collection was the outcome of a project which explored our relationship to our personal possessions and museum artefacts. Participants each chose both a personal possession and a museum object or artwork from National Museums Liverpool’s collection that they felt a connection to. This online exhibition presents these museum objects and the personal possessions of the participants.\n\nDigital events offered the opportunity to reach a vast, and possibly new or broader audience. For example, The National Portrait Gallery (prior to its closure for refurbishment) partnered with Classic FM to film four musicians in the Gallery in June 2020. They were filmed close to portraits of musicians or composers, often linked to the music they were playing, for example, Vaughan Williams. The films were shared on the NPG’s digital channels and by Classic FM and attracted 88,000 views on the NPG’s channels.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe data collected for 2020/21 demonstrates the resilience of some types of partnership, and the innovative ways in which the sector responded to unforeseen circumstances and pivoted to enable the delivery of public programming to audiences throughout the UK and internationally through different channels and methods.\n\nAs seen in the 2017/18 report, the national museums remain engaged in partnerships with wide ranging impacts — in research and innovation, in developing career opportunities, in supporting learning and education and in encouraging participation. Where activities could be delivered through digital platforms, numbers are similar to those reported in 2017/18. As well as adapting existing programming, the data shows that the museums developed specific partnership activities aimed at increasing participation and supporting audiences during lockdown.\n\nHowever, as could be expected, the data also shows that many areas of traditional museum programming were negatively impacted — in particular activities that rely on on-site delivery. The data shows that the number of short term loans were dramatically reduced for this reporting period, and many museums reported the cancellation and postponement of exhibitions. This is reflected in the total loan numbers which had previously been increasing overall year on year.\n\nLooking ahead and next steps\n\nPartnership work is integral to the delivery of programming across the portfolios of the national museums and enables them to make connections across sectors and to different audiences. Partnerships are also crucial for the resilience of the sector, and will have an important part to play in post-pandemic recovery and in supporting levelling up of regions across the UK. The national museums have a key role, as sector leaders, to initiate and support this work going forward as they themselves also start building back capacity. However, it is important to note that the national museums are but one part of a vibrant and varied museum sector in the UK. Many regional museums partner with the national museums on initiatives, but also with each other and with other organisations both locally, nationally and internationally.\n\nThe pandemic necessitated a number of changes in behaviours — both in how audiences engaged with museums and how museums facilitated that engagement. The shift to digital provision is perhaps the most notable change, however only time will tell whether we will continue to see a large proportion of online programming or whether activities will shift back to on site and in person in the absence of restrictions. Holding events online enabled museums to engage wider and larger audiences, and try new initiatives. However it should be noted that holding activities online may reduce opportunities for income generation that can be gained through on site visits (such as retail and catering) and that further data is likely to be required on the make-up of digital audiences before definitive conclusions can be made about improved diversity. It is also important to note that the shift to digital provision, within the national museums and elsewhere in the sector, is dependent on the presence of in-house skills, resources and infrastructure. The pandemic has raised questions in regards to digital capacity within the sector. It’s possible that further partnership work, for example, in collaboration with the digital and tech sectors, may help address this.\n\nPartnerships enable better sustainability within the sector by supporting museums to reach increased and more diverse audiences, to build financial resilience and to adapt and change to external circumstances. The data gathered for this reporting year cannot be seen as ‘usual’ and it is therefore difficult to compare to previous reporting years. Nonetheless, it has been useful to quantify the impact of the pandemic on partnership activity by comparing the data to previous reports.\n\nIt is anticipated that future iterations of this report will be useful in gauging sector recovery (by tracking numbers, types and impacts of partnerships) and in tracking any post-COVID behaviour changes or trends within the sector. Many of the loans that went ahead during this time, for example, were installed with virtual supervision rather than a traditional courier to accompany the object. Combined with wider concerns around carbon footprint and the increasing costs of mounting exhibitions, it is possible that this practice will continue and become more commonplace. As mentioned previously, digital programming may feature more heavily in forward plans and future connections and we are interested in recording its impact into the future.\n\nAppendix 1: List of images\n\nFigure 1: The 75 sites of the 22 national museums included in this report\n\nFigure 2: Chart showing total loans out for 2020/21\n\nFigure 3: Cats on the Page, A British Library Touring Exhibition, on display at the Atkinson in Southport, 12 September 2020 – 9 January 2021.©The Atkinson, Southport.\n\nFigure 4: Nordic table case: Kirkleatham Museum, Nordic by Nature: Modern design and prints, a British Museum Touring Exhibition, photo credit Kev Howard\n\nFigure 5: Chart showing the the types of organisation which borrowed from the national museums in 2020/21\n\nFigure 6: interactive map showing short loans out received by UK region\n\nFigure 7: interactive map of long loans out received by region\n\nFigure 8: map of international short term loans out during 2020/21\n\nFigure 9: Willie Doherty and Anne Stewart in ‘WILLIE DOHERTY WHERE’ at Ulster Museum\n\nFigure 10: interactive map of research loans out during 2020/21\n\nFigure 11: chart showing what areas of museum work the apprenticeship or traineeship was intended to support\n\nFigure 12: chart showing how collaborative PhD projects were funded during 2020/21\n\nFigure 13: Infographic © The Trustees of the Natural History Museum, London\n\nFigure 14: chart of partnership types aimed at supporting audience participation and social outcomes\n\nFigure 15: Map of programme partners © IWM\n\nFigure 16: This chart shows the most commonly reported type of partner organisation for projects aimed at participation\n\nFigure 17: Creation Stations at Tate Liverpool © Tate 2020/2021 Photographer Gareth Jones\n\nFigure 18: chart showing the specific health and/or wellbeing issues and concerns the reported activities were designed to support\n\nFigure 19: On the Road, Courtesy of National Museums Liverpool.\n\nFigure 20: Image used courtesy of Staffordshire Libraries and Arts Service\n\nFigure 21: Students from The Charter School North Dulwich see their work on display at the museum in Nov 21 after lockdown restrictions lifted, © Victoria and Albert Museum, London\n\nFigure 22: The National Library of Miniature Books © Axel Scheffler.\n\nFigure 23: Photo: Manchester Gateway Piccadilly © Ocean Outdoor\n\nAppendix 2: The 2020/21 Survey\n\nPart 1: Sharing collections\n\nThe museums were asked to:\n\nlist venues that you have loaned collections to and borrowed from on short term loan between 1st April 2020 and 31st March 2021\n\nlist venues that you have loaned collections to and borrowed from on long loan between 1st April 2020 and 31st March 2021\n\nlist details of touring exhibitions between 1st April 2020 and 31st March 2021\n\nlist any acquisitions made by other museums and institutions that you have supported between 1st April 2020 and 31st March 2021\n\nlist any shared services shared with other museums and institutions between 1st April 2020 and 31st March 2021\n\nPart 2: Other partnerships\n\nThe museums were asked to:\n\nlist the Subject Specialist Networks and other specialist groups that support knowledge exchange in the museum sector you are either an organisational member of or lead or chair\n\nlist any staff exchange programmes you have participated in both the UK and Internationally\n\nlist training sessions and programmes, workshops, sector-facing conferences or study days that you have offered to external participants from the museum and adjacent sectors to develop their skills\n\nlist any apprenticeships or traineeships that your organisation hosted\n\nlist doctoral students you have hosted\n\nlist research projects that you participated in with partners (eg with other universities, libraries, museums or research organisations)\n\nlist projects aimed at improving and diversifying participation which includes any partnerships that aimed to engage your audiences (eg through public programming)\n\nlist partnership projects delivering education to young people which includes both arts, culture, history as well as other forms of education (eg STEM learning)\n\nlist projects that had a specific aim of improving health and wellbeing for your audiences\n\nlist partnerships that aimed to support the development of professions/skills outside the sector (e.g business and language skills, teacher training)\n\nlist any digital partnerships that were developed both independently and in response to the pandemic\n\nlist any partnership activities (without a digital focus) that were not specifically planned, but were developed in order to overcome a barrier or challenge posed by the pandemic\n\nprojects relate to any partnership activities which do not fit into any of the previous categories\n\nBritish Library\n\nBorrowing collection items for public exhibition -
