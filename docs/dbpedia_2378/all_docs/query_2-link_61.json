        "text": "Museums in The Rocks & Circular Quay\n\nIf you're looking for a large number of world-class institutions in one place, it's hard to go past The Rocks and nearby Circular Quay. As an added bonus, there’s an endless parade of cafes, restaurants and bars to refuel at post-show.\n\nMuseum of Sydney\n\nOne of the dozen Sydney Living Museums venues helping celebrate NSW heritage, the Museum of Sydney was built around Australia's first government house to preserve the stories of one of the most pivotal locations in the country's early history. The state's founding governor, Arthur Phillip, called this location home, and for decades it hosted some of the most important legal events that shaped Sydney, NSW and Australia. Visitors can view original parts of the building as well as a rotating series of exhibitions and events that dive into the state’s colonial history, including a favourite based on the First Fleet ships.\n\nGetting there: Just steps from the Circular Quay train station, ferry wharf, light rail station and bus stops. Parking is limited in the area, so we suggest taking public transportation.\n\nJustice and Police Museum\n\nYou'll have no trouble respecting the authority of the Justice and Police Museum, which solves the mysteries of some of the state's darkest tales. One of the great Sydney history museums, it occupies the former home of the Water Police and the site of some of the biggest legal proceedings of 1800s NSW. The museum offers a peek into that past with everything from original holding cells to forensic evidence from notorious crimes. It’s also a great day out for kids, with plenty of eye-opening and educational activities for little ones.\n\nGetting there: As with the Museum of Sydney, the best way to get here is via public transport to Circular Quay – from here, it’s a short walk to the museum.\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art\n\nArchitectural style and art substance unite at the Museum of Contemporary Art, with a dreamy setting overlooking Circular Quay and the Opera House (for the best view, head to the rooftop cafe for coffee or a glass of wine). The permanent collection of art and artefacts is quite astounding; add to this is a dynamic schedule of blockbuster international exhibitions, and you have an all-round winner.\n\nGetting there: Public transport to Circular Quay is the most convenient option – it’s a short walk from here.\n\nMuseums in the City & Darling Harbour\n\nPowerhouse Museum\n\nThe Powerhouse Museum in Ultimo prides itself on having a contemporary focus on arts, science, innovation and design. There are several permanent exhibitions, complemented by changing temporary exhibitions and displays, many offering a deep dive into Australian culture. Look forward to regular tours, workshops, forums and other special events held throughout.\n\nGetting there:: Take the train to Central Station or light rail to Paddy’s Markets and walk down, or catch the 501 bus, which stops right outside the museum. Paid parking is also available in the area.\n\nPlease note: Powerhouse Ultimo is temporarily closed as it undergoes a significant heritage revitalisation that will deliver new and expanded spaces to showcase the museum's renowned collection and present exclusive international exhibitions. Powerhouse will continue to present programs at Powerhouse Castle Hill and Sydney Observatory during this time.\n\nAustralian National Maritime Museum\n\nSet sail for adventure at the beloved Australian National Maritime Museum, a pillar of Darling Harbour. There's always fun afloat with a range of rotating exhibitions, not to mention permanent fixtures and a fleet full of vessels to climb aboard and explore. An experience unlike other museum visits, this is a chance for the whole family to see what it's like to live, work, battle and explore on – and under – the high seas.\n\nGetting there: The museum is just a 20-minute walk from Town Hall Station, there’s a light rail stop across the road, the 389 bus stop just outside the door or there's paid parking nearby.\n\nAustralian Museum\n\nAs if the name didn't give it away, the Australian Museum is what many consider to be the crown jewel of the Sydney museum scene. The country's oldest museum (coincidentally located next to the country's oldest park) re-opened bigger and better than ever in late 2020 after major refurbishments. Today, it houses a staggering collection of more than 20 million pieces, including a sizeable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander collection celebrating our First Nations history and contemporary culture. Regular events and workshops are an added bonus.\n\nGetting there: Take a train or bus to Town Hall, St James or Museum stations, all of which are a short walk away. There are also several parking garages nearby, some with discounted parking for museum visitors.\n\nHyde Park Barracks Museum\n\nJust a short jaunt from the Australian Museum sits the Hyde Park Barracks Museum, which transports you back to the convict history upon which much of modern-day Australia was built. Set in an original building constructed to house convicts in NSW’s early colonial days, the museum offers an immersive, interactive tour that takes advantage of audio and video technology for a next-level museum experience.\n\nGetting there: St James and Martin Place stations are a short walk away, while bus stops on nearby Elizabeth Street and Macquarie Street are also good options. There is also a paid car park at the Domain.\n\nMuseums around the city\n\nSydney Jewish Museum, Darlinghurst\n\nSince opening in 1992, the Sydney Jewish Museum has been teaching visitors about the Holocaust and its long-lasting impacts through more than 12,000 artefacts and 1,000 testimonials. But its lessons don't stop there, as it also hosts extensive, detailed exhibits on the history of Judaism and Jewish involvement in Australia's military.\n\nGetting there: The 311 and 389 buses both stop close to the museum. Kings Cross Station is less than a 10-minute walk and Museum Station is a 15-minute walk. There's also limited metered street parking and the nearby St Vincent's Hospital car park.\n\nQtopia, Darlinghurst\n\nThe largest museum and cultural centre for queer history and culture in the world, this welcoming space is devoted to the memory, education and celebration of the LGBTQIA+ community, and hosts a program of events and performances. Housed in the heritage-listed former Darlinghurst Police Station, Qtopia opened in 2024 with 18 exhibitions, spanning five major themes: HIV/AIDS, human rights, sexuality and identity, media representation and First Nations stories.\n\nGetting there: Bus lines 200, 311, 333, 396 and 440 stop near Qtopia Sydney. The walk from both Kings Cross and Museum Stations is approximately 15 minutes in duration.\n\nSydney Cricket Ground Museum, Moore Park\n\nIt's hard to talk about Australian culture without mentioning the huge role sport plays in it. As the state's most historic sporting venue, the Sydney Cricket Ground has been the site of many of the country's greatest sporting triumphs. The SCG Museum, part of the SCG Tour, paints a picture of some of the most memorable athletic moments on Australian soil, with one-of-a-kind memorabilia and first-hand accounts of the people who lived it.\n\nGetting there: The Moore Park light rail stop is close to the gates and a number of buses also run past the SCG. Paid parking is also available.\n\nCamden Museum, Camden\n\nThe Camden Museum offers a deep dive into Australian Aboriginal history. Located at the intersection of three tribal councils, the story of Camden is intricately interwoven with that of the nation as a whole. Learn more about it through hundreds of documents and artefacts donated to the museum over the years."
