        "text": "The Australian National Maritime Museum is Australia’s national centre for maritime collections, exhibitions, research and archaeology.\n\nThe museum presents a changing program of stimulating exhibitions and events to share Australia’s maritime history and connect the stories, objects, people and places that are part of our country’s narrative. We welcome over 850,000 visitors annually including families, interstate and international tourists. Over 13,000 members support the museum and regularly enjoy special events and activities.\n\nCustodians of Floating Historical Vessels\n\nThe museum has one of the largest floating historical vessel collections in the world, featuring the renowned replica of Captain Cook’s HMB Endeavour, the replica Duyfken, the first known European vessel to visit the continent, the former Navy destroyer HMAS Vampire, the former Navy patrol boat HMAS Advance and former Navy submarine HMAS Onslow. Docked at our wharves, visitors can climb aboard to explore life at sea. More about our vessels.\n\nExhibitions and Permanent Galleries\n\nOur permanent and temporary exhibitions and our National Maritime Collection explore and represent Australia’s close links to the sea covering Indigenous Australian’s deep connection to ocean, early exploration, immigration, commerce, defence, adventure, sport, play and identity. From fascinating artefacts, thought-provoking exhibitions and fun activities for kids (and big kids), the museum gives local and international visitors a chance to connect to Australia’s maritime past and present in surprising ways. Learn more about hosting an exhibition or display.\n\nEducating School and University Students\n\nThe museum offers over 30 workshops and tours across a number of curriculum areas.

Our diverse touring exhibitions give regional communities the chance to view and learn more about the fascinating stories behind the National Maritime Collection.\n\nTrips on the Endeavour Replica\n\nThe Endeavour HMB regularly voyages around the Australian coast giving Australians and school children direct access to this important vessel. The Endeavour has visited many remote and regional Australian ports, even completing a 13-month circumnavigation of the country in 2012.\n\nCurators and Experts\n\nOur highly skilled team is made up of experts in many fields and includes conservators, curators, maritime archaeologists, registrars, administrators, shipwrights, designers, librarians and educational specialists. Our curators and experts also play a key role in the community, assisting smaller regional museums and community organisations to maintain regional maritime heritage collections around the country.

The scheme provides grants across a number of categories including collection management, conservation, presentation, development of education or public programs, and training for paid or unpaid workers of not-for-profit organisations in caring for maritime collections.
