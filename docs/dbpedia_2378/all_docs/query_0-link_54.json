        "text": "A government department could be fined up to $1.5 million after a child caught fire during a visit to Canberra science institution.\n\nThe nine-year-old was touching a plasma globe when their hands caught alight during a visit to Questacon in July 2022.\n\nThe child had used alcohol-based hand sanitiser provided by Questacon, an investigation by national safety authority Comcare found.\n\nWhen they came into contact with the globe, a spark ignited the hand sanitiser, causing burns to their hands and wrists.\n\nThe Department of Industry, Science and Resources, which oversees Questacon, has been charged with a criminal offence under the Work Health and Safety Act.\n\nThe National Science and Technology Centre could have eliminated risks by removing the plasma globes, limiting their use to trained Questacon workers, warning visitors of the ignition risks or provided non-alcohol-based sanitiser, Comcare found.\n\nThe government department will return to the ACT Magistrates Court on September 12.\n\nQuestacon is one of Canberra's biggest attractions, drawing more than 500,000 visitors every year including large groups of children on school excursions.\n\nIts galleries are filled with a variety of science exhibits and experiments, from a slide that emulates the weightlessness of space to an earthquake simulator.\n\nPlasma balls are often used in physics demonstrations and create lightning effects when users enter close proximity."
