This handy resource is designed to help students master the WHAT, WHY, and HOW of the process. Just one of the bonus freebies I shared in today’s ‘Cognitive Science in Education Conference’. Thanks to John Catt from Hodder Education for hosting.\n\nMaths, Physics, Physical Education, Science - did you know that schools around the world are incorporating VALD technology in the classroom? \"Being able to get real-time data in the form of force traces, jump heights, force outputs, and a range of other metrics is beneficial to the students in helping to embed what they are learning\". \"It speaks to the very core of what PE aims to achieve, which is learning 'through', 'in' and 'about' movement\". In this Q&A with Matt Johnson from Ignatius Park College - learn about the benefits of technology in the teaching environment, as well as some tips for implementing it: https://lnkd.in/gBcdr53J\n\nMaths, Physics, Physical Education, Science - did you know that schools around the world are incorporating VALD technology in the classroom? \"Being able to get real-time data in the form of force traces, jump heights, force outputs, and a range of other metrics is beneficial to the students in helping to embed what they are learning\". \"It speaks to the very core of what PE aims to achieve, which is learning 'through', 'in' and 'about' movement\".
