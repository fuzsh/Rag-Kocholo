Since 2005 a number of Australian and New Zealand museums have developed close relationships with museums in PNG and Pacific Island communities including Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands as part of the ICOM – Australia Museum Partnership Programme.

They often prove to be relationships that can endure even when formal Government to Government links have foundered."
