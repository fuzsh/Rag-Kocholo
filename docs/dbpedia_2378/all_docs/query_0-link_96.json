Professor Karoly is active in research on climate variability and climate change, including greenhouse climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion and interannual climate variations due to El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Recently, he has been studying the impacts of climate change on weather extremes and their impacts on human and natural systems. He was Chair of the Premier of Victoria's Climate Change Reference Group during 2008-09 and was invited to join the Australian Government's High Level Coordinating Group on Climate Change Science at the end of 2009. He is also a member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists and the Australian Academy of Sciences' National Committee on Earth System Science. Professor Karoly joined the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne in May 2007 after receiving a Federation Fellowship from the Australian Research Council. From 2003 to 2007, he was the Williams Chair Professor of Meteorology in the School of Meteorology at the University of Oklahoma. During 2001-2002, he was Professor of Meteorology and Head of the School of Mathematical Sciences at Monash University in Melbourne. From August 1995, he was Director of the Cooperative Research Centre for Southern Hemisphere Meteorology at Monash University until it closed in June 2000. In 1993, Professor Karoly received the Meisinger Award from the American Meteorological Society. In 1998, he received the Norbert Gerbier-Mumm International Award from the World Meteorological Organization for a joint research paper with ten international collaborators. In 1999, he was elected a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society for outstanding contributions to the atmospheric sciences over a substantial period of years.\n\nInternational Polar Year activities within Questacon’s programmes, as well as spearheading initiatives within the Asia Pacific (ASPAC) region. Graham is currently the convenor for Project IGLO, an International action on Global Warming, for the ASPAC region. In particular, Graham has been instrumental in organising discussions on the role of science centres in contributing to the knowledge and understanding of the community about global warming and climate change. He is taking an active role in the development of initiatives and best practice to ensure that science centres and museums are at the forefront of information dissemination and education for all age groups on important and controversial issues.\n\nmanagement and marketing, and social inclusion. Sandell was a fellow at the Smithsonian Institution during part of 2003-2005, pursuing research into the role that museums play in combating prejudice. In April 2008 he took up a Visiting Fellowship at the Humanities Research Centre, Australian National University, to pursue his research project, ‘Museums, Moralities and Human Rights’. In 2004 Sandell was invited to be an advisor to the American Association of Museums’ taskforce on Museums and Diversity. He was also invited to present findings of recent research to a Department for Cultural, Media and Sport (DCMS) seminar as part of the consultation on the policy ‘Understanding the Future: Priorities for England’s museums’, January 23 2007. Sandell is a frequent keynote speaker at international conferences, reflective of his innovations and authority in the field of museum equity, diversity and inclusion.\n\nlearning, Indigenous evaluation, as well as the strategic uses of audience research and new technologies in organisational change. She is happily obsessed with all things Web 2.0 and curious to see how this will change the world that museums operate within and the ways people learn. Lynda also administesr Museum 3.0, a social network site for museum professionals, with an active, global membership of over 2,000. In 2007 she completed her PhD in museum learning, and now that's finished she is looking forward to the adventures the new web world will bring. In 2010 her latest book, Hot Topics, Public Culture, Museums, co-edited with Dr Fiona Cameron, University of Western Sydney, will be released. Dr. Kelly has been Partner Investigator (PI) on five major collaborative Australian Research Council projects: Exhibitions as contested sites: the role of museums in contemporary society (2000-2004, University of Sydney); Increasing visitor frequency (2004-2007, University of Technology, Sydney); New Literacies, New Audiences (2005-2008, Queensland University of Technology); Engaging With Social Media in Museums (2008-2010, Swinburne University of Technology); Hot Science Global Citizens (2008-2011, University of Western Sydney). Her other research projects include Museums Actively Researching Visitor Experiences and Learning a University of Technology Industry Seeding Grant (2001) Measuring the Impact of Museums on their Local Communities a University of Technology Industry Seeding Grant (2003) and Identity based personalised mobile content with University of Sydney/Smart Services CRC (2009-2011).\n\nWayne LaBar is Vice President of Exhibitions and Theaters for the Liberty Science Center, NJ (USA). With 20 years of museum exhibition development/design experience, Wayne LaBar became Vice President of Exhibitions and Theaters for the Liberty Science Center in 1999. Liberty Science Center, in Jersey City, NJ is located directly across from lower Manhattan. Exploring how to use exhibits and science centers as a medium to engage the public in science and technological issues as well as exploring new roles that emerging technologies can take has been a focus for LaBar\n\nsince taking on a leadership role in the field. This project began in his capacity as Director of Exhibits/Exhibit Implementation at the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose, Ca. This was a new facility built to look at and explore the new technologies being developed in what is known as Silicon Valley. Wayne also heads an ambitious push to explore how new technology can encourage guests to interact with exhibitions. Examples are “Science Now Science Everywhere” or “SNSE” (www.snse.lsc.org), a unique cell phone application and the Exhibit Commons (http://www.lsc.org/interactive/exhibit-commons), an “open source” exhibit initiative that invites guests to contribute to the museum’s mutable exhibitions, presenting new information or divergent points of view, building on the phenomena of social software. Through these efforts and others, Wayne and his fellow team members are currently exploring how to use new advances in technology and their resultant social changes to advance the exhibition field. Their latest project is Cooking an exhibition where anyone can participate in its development at the site: http://cookingexhibitchefs.ning.com/\n\nCarolyn Meehan (B.Ed., M.En.Sc) is Manager Visitor Advocacy at Museum Victoria in Melbourne. She has worked in the evaluation and visitor research fields since 1994 and in the museum industry since 1987.
