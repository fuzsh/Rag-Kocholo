        "text": "The National Gallery of Australia holds Australia’s national art collection, representing the visual culture and spirit of the country. In A Feast of Icons, an expert guide reveals the stories of six renowned works from the gallery’s collection in an exclusive, after-hours tour. Following the tour, guests will enjoy a spectacular degustation dinner overlooking the lake. Each course is inspired by an artwork on the tour, creating an evening to remember.\n\nAt Sydney's Australian National Maritime Museum, embark on the Luxury Harbour Cruise experience onboard Edwardian Steam Yacht, Ena, to go back in time as you step into the shoes of society’s elite 100 years ago. The four-hour private tour includes a delicious gourmet meal paired with fine Australian wines.\n\nTo sail on one of the rarest ships in the world – a stunning replica of the first European ship to reach Australia in 1606 – look no further than the Sail on Duyfken experience. Expert crew will share their knowledge about the Duyfken’s unique history of merchant trade expeditions and 400-year-old tall ship sailing technology.\n\nFor a behind-the-scenes glimpse of legendary artefacts including the 1602 Blaeu celestial globe and Batavia shipwreck, the Hidden Gems and Ancient Artefacts tour won’t disappoint. Along with laying your eyes on momentous items unavailable to the public, you’ll also get a sneak peek of the museum’s conservation lab and restoration work.\n\nNo trip to Sydney is complete without witnessing a live performance in its most famous building, the Sydney Opera House. It’s your moment to shine when you book your exclusive Opera Australia: Star at the Sydney Opera House experience. The excitement starts with a wig and costume fitting two days prior to the performance and culminates with entry through the stage door of the Sydney Opera House for a once-in-a-lifetime, walk-on role with the chorus of Opera Australia.\n\nOr if you really want to surprise the love of your life, Opera Australia can help you propose on stage at Sydney Opera House. Ride the romantic momentum of a night at the opera with a proposal that’ll truly knock their socks off. Up on stage, under the lights, you get down on one knee for a Not So Modest Proposal.\n\nThe Sydney Opera House is Australia’s most-recognised cultural institution and a celebrated community meeting place. See just what it takes to put on a show in this iconic venue with the Sydney Opera House: A Taste of Opera. You’ll embark on a private, first-hand look behind the curtain into the venues, fascinating history and insider stories of this iconic building. Plus, meet with the singer and pianist and enjoy an exclusive opera recital.\n\nAustralia’s national airline, Qantas, was founded in Longreach in outback Queensland in 1920. The Qantas Founders Museum tells the airline’s story with interpretive displays, interactive exhibits, replica aircraft and genuine artefacts. The ‘Spirit of Australia’ Platinum Tour starts with a three-hour guided tour of the two Boeings during which you’ll get the chance to see the black box flight recorders, learn how to ‘arm the doors', sit in the pilot's seat, inspect the cargo hold and take a walk on the wings of both Boeing aircraft.\n\nMona is Australia’s largest privately-owned gallery and museum, and is curated on the themes of sex and death. Experience an afternoon of art and pleasure with Rockstar Afternoon. You’ll be greeted with an Absinthe cocktail, continuing right through to a VIP degustation with premium wines at the museum’s Faro Bar and Restaurant. After you’ve eaten, you’ll experience a feast of the senses with exclusive access to James Turrell artworks in Unseen Seen and Weight of Darkness.\n\nWith an impressive collection of light artist James Turrell’s artwork to experience, consider booking in for The Full-On Turrell. With this package you’ll enjoy a 24-hour immersive look at his works along with expert knowledge from one of Mona’s expert art invigilators.\n\nFor a truly unique way to experience Mona’s art collection, see it through the eyes of the museum’s founder, David Walsh. Dinner with David is a two-day luxury experience that includes private jet transfers, VIP museum tour, two night’s accommodation at Mona Pavilions and a lavish private degustation at Source Restaurant where you’ll be joined by David himself.\n\nFor a ladies-only affair, why not head to the Mona's Ladies Lounge, created by artist and curator Kirsha Kaechele, for High Tea for Two. Indulge in decadent nibbles, fancy tipples and other ladylike pleasures – all hosted by the fabulous butler. And as is always the case with Kirsha's dinners and feasts, you are a participant in what she sees as the art itself, part of a living installation.\n\nPort Arthur Historic Site is the best-preserved convict settlement in Australia and among the most significant convict era sites in the world. Put yourself into the shoes of some of Port Arthur’s most notable individuals with The Wheel of Fate experience. You’ll get the exclusive opportunity to see where they worked, slept and ate by going behind the bars to explore 19th century life in this infamous prison settlement. Afterwards, you’ll sample the Tasman Peninsula’s finest produce in a dinner prepared by Port Arthur Historic Site’s head chef as night falls within the walls of this World Heritage-listed site.\n\nThe National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) is the oldest and most-visited gallery in Australia. Get ready for an evening of art, music, fine dining and wine with the Private Gallery Dinner at NGV in Melbourne: The Banquet of Cleopatra. You’ll enjoy exclusive access to the gallery, meeting at the iconic waterwall entrance before being escorted on a private tour of the highlights of the NGV’s international art collection. The evening also includes intimate live music performances and an indulgent dinner set in front of the NGV’s revered masterpiece, Giambattista Tiepolo’s The Banquet of Cleopatra.\n\nThe WA Maritime Museum symbolises Fremantle’s past, present and future as a coastal city and port. The Indian Ocean Experience allows you to experience Western Australia’s incredible maritime history. You'll hear personalised stories from a museum expert followed by dinner in the Australia II gallery under the famous America’s Cup winning yacht, Australia II. It’s hard to pick the highlight of the evening, however, there is something incredible about a sunset overlooking the Indian ocean accompanied by some of Australia’s finest classical string musicians."
