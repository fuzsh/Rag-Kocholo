Questacon is the national leader in engaging people in science and technology. The Centre in Canberra provides the base for our national and international operations. Questacon aims to make science fun and relevant for everyone by engaging people in making their own stimulating discoveries. Questacon combines education with entertainment in everything it does, including its interactive exhibits, travelling programmes and performances. Questacon is a national leader in designing, developing and delivering exciting exhibitions and programmes to communicate the relevance of science and technology in various ways. Questacon develops exhibitions and programmes for people of all ages, but mainly focuses on families and schools. Questacon is a major interactive science centre in world terms, and is the only full member of the Association of Science and Technology Centres from the southern hemisphere. Questacon has Website Manager, who monitors web content development, technical issues and controls the website's budget. The Questacon website's interactive content production is largely outsourced to MA@D Communications in Canberra. The site is hosted on a dedicated server at Macquarie Corporate in Sydney, and has been since May 2005. In the past the site was hosted by Hyperlink in Melbourne (November 2001 - April 2005), by Interact ACT (part of Asia Online) from mid 1999 and it was hosted by the Sunsite at ANU prior to that.
