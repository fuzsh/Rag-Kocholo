Questacon, the Australian National Science and Technology Centre, is a science museum located in Canberra. It combines science with entertainment, and includes a number of interesting exhibits, such as a house undergoing a simulated earthquake, and a play area for the 0–6 age bracket.

Questacon is open almost every day, and is one of Canberra’s major tourist attractions. However, it is not free. See the Wikipedia article and the museum website for more information.
