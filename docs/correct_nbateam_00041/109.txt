The Charlotte Bobcats have signed center Kwame Brown, reuniting the former first overall draft pick with team owner and Hall of Famer Michael Jordan.

Jordan, then a Washington Wizards executive, had made Brown the number one NBA draft pick in 2001. But Brown never lived up to his potential as a top pick and was traded in 2005.

After stints with the Los Angeles Lakers, Memphis Grizzlies and Detroit Pistons, the 28-year-old will get another chance to play for Jordan, who is the Bobcats' majority owner.

Brown averaged 3.3 points and 3.7 rebounds with the Pistons last season, well off the career-highs he set in each category in the 2003-04 season when he averaged 10.9 points and 7.4 rebounds while playing for the Wizards.
