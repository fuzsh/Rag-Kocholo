        "text": "Editor's note: An earlier version of this story included incorrect information on Kwame Brown. He was the first high school player taken No. 1 overall in the NBA draft.\n\nAs Michael Jordan knows better than anyone from his legendary playing days, one good season does not a reputation make.\n\nRespect and credibility are built over time, with one's career a compilation of the good, the bad and — as had been the case in Jordan's post-playing life as an owner and executive — the ugly.\n\nBut nearly 15 years after his management-ownership career began with the Washington Wizards, has Jordan finally become an effective boss? It's certainly starting to seem that way.\n\nThis goes beyond his then-Charlotte Bobcats' April playoff appearance and their emergence as one of the best defensive teams, ranked fourth in the league in average points allowed, though those achievements surpassed anything that unfolded in Jordan's ill-fated Wizards tenure. Recall his ill-fated decision to make Kwame Brown the first high school player to be taken first overall in the NBA when he was drafted by the Wizards in 2001.\n\nThis is about the subtleties of the last two summers, when the combination of Jordan's eternal gravitas and the plan employed by those he hired have proved quite powerful. Just as the signing of center Al Jefferson in July 2013 was a big boon for this team, the signing of former Indiana Pacers guard Lance Stephenson in July showed again that the perception of the team is changing for the better.\n\nJordan is less controlling, those who know will tell you, and more selective about when and where to make the most of the one-of-a-kind influence that comes with being MJ. And because he remains such a powerful part of today's basketball culture, it's enough to make you wonder where he can take it from here.\n\n\"He still has the No. 1 Q score (a rating that quantifies a celebrity's level of fame). Brand Jordan is selling over $2 billion (annually),\" his former longtime agent, David Falk, tells USA TODAY Sports. \"So my point is, he's still No. 1.\"\n\nYet that doesn't help when it comes to the high-wire act that is NBA team management. From picking the right front office folks and coaching staff to deciding how to maximize one's voice within that group, there's a delicacy to it that Jordan has been mastering of late.\n\n\"He was a great player from Day One, but he had to learn how to win championships,\" Falk says. \"So maybe you become a GM, or an owner, and it takes a while to understand the nuances of putting a team together. And having experienced it now, I think he's better.\"\n\nPOWER IN THE NAME\n\nThe decision to hire general manager Rich Cho in June 2011 has proved prudent. And Cho's sphere of influence grew over the summer when longtime Jordan friend Rod Higgins left the organization after Jordan had redefined his role, giving Cho more personnel power. The May 2013 hiring of coach Steve Clifford has paid big dividends, too, including his effective partnership with former New York Knicks great Patrick Ewing. Both previously were assistants with the Orlando Magic.\n\nClifford, who signed a three-year, $6 million deal with a team option for 2015-16, raves about his experience with Jordan.\n\n\"From the time I've been here, I think he's been motivated and aggressive to make our team better,\" Clifford tells USA TODAY Sports. \"And then aside from that ... he's valuable to me because he watches every game. ... He gives me good feedback on what he sees, and he's not afraid to tell me when there are things that he thinks we could be doing better or I could be doing better. But he's also extremely supportive.\"\n\nEwing, Jordan's longtime friend and associate head coach of the Hornets, comes with a clout all his own and a name that still resonates with today's generation of players. Jordan and Ewing represent the best of the old school bunch when it comes to trying to sway prospective free agents. It certainly helped them with Stephenson.\n\nAfter Stephenson and his agent, Alberto Ebanks, had failed to reach a deal with the Pacers, they met in Las Vegas with Jordan, Cho, Hornets vice chairman Curtis Polk, Clifford, Ewing and assistant general manager Chad Buchanan. Jordan wasn't the only member of his family at the meeting, either, as his brother and Hornets director of player personnel Larry Jordan was there, as was Hornets executive vice president of operations Ronnie Jordan. As Clifford remembers it, MJ and Ewing — the face of the Knicks during Stephenson's childhood — had everything to do with the three-year, $27million deal getting done a day later.\n\n\"The biggest part about the meeting was our owner,\" Clifford says. \"He's a fan of Lance. He loves his competitiveness, and he talked to him candidly about why we think he's such a good fit for our franchise and about things ... that (Stephenson) could control to get better. I thought that set the tone for the whole meeting.\"\n\nPHOTOS: THE CAREER OF MICHAEL JORDAN\n\nALL-OUT FOR HAYWARD\n\nThe Hornets weren't without their failures in this latest offseason, some of their own doing (former Bobcats forward Josh McRoberts signing with the Miami Heat) and others outside their control (seeing their max offer to restricted free agent Gordon Hayward matched by the Utah Jazz). Yet the tenets of good basketball business remained through it all.\n\nThe Hayward courting, specifically, was yet another sign this organization was in good working order with Jordan at the helm. Hayward was ecstatic at the prospect of heading for Charlotte. The candy awaiting him inside his hotel room on his visit to town didn't set a bad tone, either.\n\n\"Watermelon Sour Patch in some little bowls,\" Hayward tells USA TODAY Sports. \"Just little things like that.\n\n\"They went all out.\"\n\nAside from the four-year, $63 million offer to him, the Hornets went to great lengths to sell Hayward on the business and basketball side — even without Jordan in person. While with his infant twin daughters and wife, Yvette, Jordan joined the Hayward meeting by way of Skype.\n\n\"Just the fact that he took out 15 minutes to Skype with me showed a lot,\" Hayward says. \"His brand is legendary status, so no matter what he'll always be a basketball idol worldwide. ... Everybody is a fan of MJ. He's one of the best to ever do it.\"\n\nThe Haywards visited the team's practice facility, toured the neighborhoods and visited the homes of Cho and Jefferson.\n\n\"I didn't know what to expect ... but they blew me away with their presentation,\" Hayward says. \"They came in and did a whole analytical presentation too, which was really, really impressive. It spoke to the analytical part of me. I was a computer engineer and math major in college, so that was really impressive to see.\n\n\"It just showed that they're taking steps to try and become a next-level team and push toward trying to win a championship.\""
