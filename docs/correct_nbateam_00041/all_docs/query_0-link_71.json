        "text": "EL SEGUNDO -The Charlotte Bobcats have been in business for all of 2 1/2 seasons, compiling a 58-147 record in that time, while barely meeting the NBA’s minimum team salary of $39.85 million this season.\n\nYet it’s the Bobcats who have given the Lakers “hell” in the words of Kobe Bryant. They took down the Lakers 133-124 in triple-overtime at home on Dec. 29 and will be at Staples Center tonight for the rematch.\n\nIt will be a last stand of sorts for the Lakers, who have dropped more games to doormat teams than they care to remember. The past month has seen losses to Charlotte, Memphis and New Orleans, teams with a combined record of 41-84.\n\n“Our thing all year is we know we can play with the best teams,” Luke Walton said. “But to be one of the best teams, we’ve got to beat these sub-.500 teams. We’re aware of that and we’ve been talking about it, so we’ve got to start making it happen now.”\n\nLakers coach Phil Jackson borrowed from one of his players in describing the string of recent losses as “haunting” the team.\n\n“For us, it’s just going out there and playing hard all the time – all the time -and understanding that we’re trying to play for something bigger,” Bryant said. “If we can keep that in our mind’s eye, we should be OK.\n\n“But it’s always about effort when you play against teams like (Charlotte) because they’re going to come out and they’re going to bring it. In the NBA, any team can beat you on any given night if you’re not ready.”\n\nThe Bobcats now have beaten the Lakers twice in Charlotte and nearly won last season at Staples Center. Brevin Knight missed two free throws with 11seconds remaining and the Lakers escaped with a 99-98 victory.\n\nWhile the Bobcats could be down four big men tonight, the Lakers will welcome the return of Lamar Odom, who missed 21 games with a sprained knee ligament. The Lakers have given up 110 points per game this month without Odom or Kwame Brown.\n\nStar gazing: For the ninth time, Bryant has been selected to the All-Star Game. He received the third-most votes of any player (behind LeBron James and Yao Ming) and will start for the Western Conference in the Feb. 18 game in Las Vegas.\n\n“It’s going to be a lot of energy,” Bryant said. “All-Star weekend normally is a lot of energy, and then you put it in Vegas, it’s going to be through the roof.”\n\nBryant was asked if this might be the worst-played All-Star Game simply because of the late hours everyone will be keeping in Sin City.\n\n“It could be the best played,” Bryant countered, “just because you don’t want to have an All-Star Game in Vegas and go out there and have somebody wear you out.”\n\nBig bucks: The Lakers remain the second most valued franchise in the NBA after the New York Knicks, according to Forbes magazine’s annual report released Thursday. Forbes estimated the Lakers’ value at $568 million, up from $529 million last season.\n\nBy returning to the playoffs, the Lakers’ revenues were estimated at $167 million, only $3million shy of the estimated revenue from the 2003-04 season before the Shaquille O’Neal trade.\n\nAlso: Forward Ronny Turiaf missed practice Thursday to get a new visa. Turiaf lost his passport and was heading to Tijuana, Mexico, to re-enter the country, Jackson said.\n\nross.siler@dailynews.com\n\n(818) 713-3607"
