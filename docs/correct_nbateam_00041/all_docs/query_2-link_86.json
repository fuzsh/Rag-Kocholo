        "text": "Kwame Brown never really deserved the literal and metaphorical beatings he took during his disappointing NBA journeyman’s career. He didn’t ask to be the No. 1 pick in the 2001 Draft, and he certainly didn’t ask for the burden of expectation that came along with having to make front-office neophyte Michael Jordan look like a competent NBA executive.\n\nHis career was more or less doomed from the beginning, both by small hands (he might be the second-most maligned person after Donald Trump for that accident of genetics) and by the relentless psychological abuse he endured from the then Wizards president (and again later in Charlotte). Brown finally faded out of the league a few years ago, but according to a new report, it appears he’s trying to revamp his basketball career. According to the Interperformances website, Brown has signed on with their sports agency in hopes of landing another NBA gig. Hat tip to Pro Basketball Talk for the find:\n\nInterperformances is proud to announce that the NBA star Kwame Brown decided to sign with our agency. The #1 overall pick of the 2001 draft is ready for a new life. His comeback can be the road to glory for a team that believes in him. Kwame is back, physically healthy and ready to be the outstanding player he was on several NBA teams.\n\nA great intimidator that can block shots, rebound consistently and explode in devastating dunks. No longer the young man that entered the NBA, Kwame is now an experienced and mature player and man. And he’s back, for the love of the game.\n\nCalling Brown a “star” and an “intimidator” might be overselling it a bit, but we certainly can’t begrudge their enthusiasm. Here’s hoping Brown gets another shot at continuing his basketball career somewhere, although at this stage he’ll be a hard sell to most organizations around the league."
