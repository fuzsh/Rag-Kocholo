        "text": "The Charlotte Bobcats have announced today that the franchise has signed 28-year-old, 6'11\" center Kwame Brown to the NBA veteran's minimum of $1.3 million.\n\nThis transaction marks the fourth free agent signing that the Bobcats organization has partaken in throughout this offseason, with the recent acquisitions of Shaun Livingston, Dominic McGuire, and Sherron Collins, in corresponding order.\n\nThe agreement between both involved parties was made public yesterday, after Brown's agent Mark Bartelstein revealed his client's destination to ESPN. According to Bartelstein, majority owner and former NBA superstar Michael Jordan was a key element to the completion of the deal, as he really wanted to give Brown another opportunity.\n\nJordan is the one responsible for bringing Brown into the league, by selecting him first-overall in the 2001 NBA Draft—making him the first player out of high school to be taken with the first pick of the draft—during his tenure as the president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards.\n\nLast season, Brown averaged the marquee statistics of 3.3 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 0.5 assists in 13.8 minutes of playing time per game with the Detroit Pistons.\n\nThe Bobcats are the fifth NBA team that the nine-year veteran has been affiliated with, noting his past ties to the Washington Wizards, Los Angeles Lakers, Memphis Grizzlies, and Detroit Pistons. Bobcats General Manager Rod Higgins clarified that the addition of Brown was meant to add depth, strength, and size to the Bobcats' currently aging and unstable frontcourt rotation.\n\nThroughout his career, Brown has established himself as a satisfactory presence in the paint, recording career averages of 10.9 points and 7.4 rebounds in the 528 games he has participated in.\n\nThe Charlotte Bobcats completed the 2009-2010 NBA season with a 44-38 regular season record and were eliminated shortly after in the first round of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals by the Orlando Magic."
