This is more of a flow game that allows me to use quickness. I'm going to continue my defense and hopefully I can get some nice moves in the paint also.\"\n\nAdds Grizzlies Head Coach Marc Iavaroni:\n\n\"He said it's a lot different practice than in LA. The Bigs can actually lead the break here and he liked it. It's more demanding but I alos think it's gonna make him a better, more versatile player. It's also gonna help Darko's development and Darko will help his development.\"\n\nGrizz Top Draft Pick Mike Conley also returned to the practice floor Monday morning after sitting out the past week with a bruised chest.\n\nHe could be cleared to play in the Grizzlies next game Tuesday night against the Milwaukee Bucks at FedExForum."
