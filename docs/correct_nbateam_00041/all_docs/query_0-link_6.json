        "text": "ByReuters\n\nUpdated 24/08/2010 at 21:48 GMT\n\nThe Charlotte Bobcats have signed center Kwame Brown, reuniting the former first overall draft pick with team owner and Hall of Famer Michael Jordan.\n\nKwame Brown\n\nImage credit: Eurosport\n\nJordan, then a Washington Wizards executive, had made Brown the number one NBA draft pick in 2001. But Brown never lived up to his potential as a top pick and was traded in 2005.\n\nAfter stints with the Los Angeles Lakers, Memphis Grizzlies and Detroit Pistons, the 28-year-old will get another chance to play for Jordan, who is the Bobcats' majority owner.\n\nBrown averaged 3.3 points and 3.7 rebounds with the Pistons last season, well off the career-highs he set in each category in the 2003-04 season when he averaged 10.9 points and 7.4 rebounds while playing for the Wizards.\n\nNBA\n\nKevin Durant out indefinitely with foot injury\n\n21/03/2015 at 08:35\n\nNBA\n\nLeBron's Cavaliers offer Wiggins for Love\n\n19/07/2014 at 07:29\n\nNBA\n\nPau Gasol leaves the Lakers for the Bulls\n\n12/07/2014 at 21:39\n\nNBA\n\nLeBron James to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers\n\n11/07/2014 at 22:36\n\nJoin 3M+ users on app\n\nDownload\n\nScan me\n\nRelated Topics\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement"
