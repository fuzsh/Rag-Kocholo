With backup center Joel Przybilla also still out with a sore knee, Tyrus Thomas will start and tangle with Bogut in his return after missing two games with bruised ribs.\n\nThe Bobcats are expected to have forward Stephen Jackson despite him missing shootaround with an illness. Backup point guard Shaun Livingston is also slowed by a twisted ankle.\n\nThe Bobcats entered the night trailing eighth-place Indiana by one game for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference."
