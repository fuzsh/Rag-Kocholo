        "text": "Each weekday morning, BDL serves up a handful of NBA-related stories to digest with your sweet potato pancakes and honey cinnamon butter.\n\nTom Sorensen, Charlotte Observer: I believe people can change. We can't wake up and say, \"Hooray, I'm different.\" But if we make the decision daily, and over a period of time, we can be something other than what we were. Kwame Brown(notes) better hope so. Michael Jordan is aware that you signed Brown, right? \"Michael gave his blessing,\" Charlotte Bobcats general manager Rod Higgins says. Brown, 6-foot-11, is the newest Bobcat. He no longer is the skinny big man who came to the NBA straight out of Glynn Academy in Brunswick, Ga. He's a man now. His legs are massive. He weighs 275 pounds. He's 28. Jordan selected Brown with the first pick in the 2001 draft. The Bobcats was president of the Washington Wizards at the time. After adding the big man to the roster, Jordan joined him on the roster, coming out of retirement to play. But Jordan did not perform like Jordan and Brown did not perform like a No.1, or even a first-round, pick. Jordan has been ripped for selecting Brown. But in his defense, the draft was littered with busts such as Tyson Chandler(notes) (No.2), Eddie Curry (No.4) and the Charlotte 49ers' own Rodney White (No.9). There were exceptions, among them Pau Gasol(notes) (No.3) Joe Johnson(notes) (No.10) Gerald Wallace(notes) (No.25), Tony Parker(notes) (No.28) and Gilbert Arenas(notes) (No.31). But at the time, the choice appeared obvious - Brown, Chandler or Curry. Brown was not Jordan's worst pick. Adam Morrison(notes) was. Morrison, whom Jordan selected with the third pick in the 2006 draft, was worse because Jordan disdained obvious talent such as Brandon Roy(notes), who went No.6, and Rudy Gay(notes), who went No.8. Some players are one dimensional. Morrison is the rare player who has no dimensions. Brown, however, has imposing dimensions. After he completes his team physical Tuesday, he meets the media at Time Warner Cable Arena. There's a platform on which players usually sit. Brown is so big he might hit his head. So he sits in a chair on the floor. I ask him about his relationship with Jordan. \"A lot of people speculate about my relationship with Michael,\" says Brown, who speaks softly and is courteous. \"But obviously I'm here, so it can't be as bad as everybody says.\"\n\nJulian Benbow, Boston Globe: After swallowing his first \"Did Not Play - Coach's Decision'' since his rookie year, Rajon Rondo(notes) knew he was on the bubble as USA Basketball made its final roster decisions for the World Championships. So he decided to burst the bubble himself. The Celtics point guard withdrew from Team USA yesterday, sensing the writing on the wall as coach Mike Krzyzewski began to test different backcourt combinations minus Rondo. With its final exhibition game today against Greece and its first preliminary game Saturday in Turkey against Croatia, Team USA set its 12-man roster, going with Chauncey Billups(notes), Derrick Rose(notes), Stephen Curry(notes), Russell Westbrook(notes), and Eric Gordon(notes) at the guard spots. Also making the team were Kevin Durant(notes), Rudy Gay, Lamar Odom(notes), Danny Granger(notes), Kevin Love(notes), Tyson Chandler, and Andre Iguodala(notes). Rondo played poorly against Lithuania last Saturday (four turnovers in 14 first-half minutes) before being benched Sunday against Spain, but USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo gave the impression that Rondo departed because of outside factors. \"Rajon came to us and said he was going to withdraw from the team, that he had some family matters to attend to and some things to take care of before the NBA season,'' Colangelo said in a statement. \"He did an outstanding job during our training, we appreciate the effort and commitment he made to our program, and he completely has our support.'' Rondo missed a practice in New York earlier this month to attend the funeral of his uncle, but rejoined the team the next day. His brother William said he wasn't sure about the reason for Rondo's withdrawal, but said their uncle's passing took a toll. \"That's my mother's brother and we're a small family,'' William said. \"I'm not sure how you put it in words. The only person that talked to him was my mom. \"He was really close to my uncle. All of us were. Maybe it got overwhelming and he decided he needed to take some time away from basketball.''\n\nPhil Jasner, Philadelphia Daily News: The 76ers' Andres Nocioni(notes) is likely to play for his native Argentina against Germany on Saturday in its opening game of the FIBA World Championships in Turkey. We think. The Sixers' Andre Iguodala, as anticipated, will be part of the USA team that will open Saturday against Croatia. Iguodala has been one of the key men on the USA squad, and is a likely starter. The U.S. has one \"friendly\" remaining, today against Greece in Athens. Nocioni, a rugged 6-7 forward, did not play in his country's final \"friendly,\" a 93-89 overtime victory over Turkey, earning the Argentines the Efes Pilsen World Cup. Nocioni has been coming back from a left ankle sprain suffered July 31. He played 13 minutes in an 89-82 victory over Lebanon, sitting out after the first 5 minutes of the third quarter. \"I came out as a precaution,\" Nocioni told El Diario Ole de Argentina. Sixers coach Doug Collins said he has spoken with Nocioni several times. \"He told me [last] Saturday that he was feeling much better, and that he hoped to be ready for the game against Germany,\" Collins said. \"He assured me that he wouldn't do anything to hurt his ability to play for us this season. I'm counting on him to use good judgment.\"\n\nRic Bucher, ESPN: Former Phoenix Suns assistant general manager David Griffin turned down the Denver Nuggets' offer to be their next general manager, according to sources, and the team is expected to pursue Masai Ujiri, director of global scouting for the Toronto Raptors. Ujiri spent four years as the Nuggets' director of international scouting before joining the Raptors. Griffin turned down the offer, a league source said, in part because it was nowhere near $1 million a year, the median salary for recently hired GMs such as the Cleveland Cavaliers' Chris Grant, the New Orleans Hornets' Dell Demps and the Portland Trail Blazers' Rich Cho.\n\nMike Cranston, AP: The Charlotte Bobcats thought the answer to their depth problems at center was to waive Erick Dampier(notes) to clear salary-cap space and then re-sign him for less money. When Dampier wouldn't agree to a new contract, the Bobcats looked at the next-best option. It just so happened to be Kwame Brown, considered Bobcats owner Michael Jordan's worst move as an executive. Jordan signed off anyway, and now they're reunited-nine years after Jordan's much-criticized decision to draft Brown No. 1 overall when he was running the Washington Wizards. Charlotte's strange offseason continued Tuesday when Brown signed a one-year, $1.3 million deal, then met the media wearing shorts with Jordan's Jumpman logo on the side. \"We're always going to be linked, so why not come here, right?\" Brown said, smiling. Meanwhile, Bobcats general manager Rod Higgins says they'll try to trade Dampier-and his $13 million non-guaranteed contract-after Sept. 13 when he can be included in multiplayer deals. \"It's going to take a while,\" Higgins said. \"Now that we've got another center, waiving him for the sake of waiving him doesn't make a whole lot of sense for us. We're going to continue to talk to teams to try to improve our roster.\"\n\nA. Sherrod Blakely, NECN: \"I'm going to do whatever they ask me to do,\" Shaquille O'Neal(notes) said shortly after signing a two-year deal with the Boston Celtics this summer. If you're Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers, this is exactly what you want to hear during the season. But in August? Well, let's just say that as much as Rivers wants to believe the future Hall of Famer will keep his word, Rivers has been in this game long enough to know that things have a way of changing once you start adding and subtracting the minutes from a player who has grown accustomed to playing as much as his 7-foot-1, 345-pound body could handle. \"All players tell you what you want to hear in August,\" Rivers said in a radio interview with former Georgetown Hoyas coach John Thompson on ESPN 980 in Washington. Rivers then touched on some of the conversations he and the Celtics had with O'Neal leading up to him joining the C's. When asked if he would come off the Celtics bench, Rivers recalled O'Neal telling him, 'Absolutely coach.' And when asked if playing 10 or 15 minutes per game would suffice, Rivers remembered O'Neal responding, 'Oh yeah, absolutely coach.' Rivers added, \"That sounds great in August but when you're actually doing it, it's tough. Especially if you've been a guy with the ball in your hands.\"\n\nMarc Berman, New York Post: The Knicks, who obtained the draft rights to 7-foot center Jerome Jordan(notes) on Draft Night, will allow the Jamaican pivot to play in Serbia this season for Hemofarm. Jordan, out of Tulsa, was deemed a project by Mike D'Antoni after an erratic summer league in Las Vegas and the club decided he'd be best off with a year in Europe at least. The Knicks still maintain his rights and will monitor his progress. The Bucks drafted Jordan 44th and traded him to the Knicks for cash considerations, believed to be $1 million."
