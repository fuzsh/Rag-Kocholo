        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nWas athletic and fluid for a seven-footer. Showed nice footwork and good quickness for a center, and could be a skilled, short-range scorer and pretty good passer out of the post. Flashed moments of explosiveness and even dominance when on his game. Significantly injury-prone, he underachieved throughout his career in the NBA. Showed more finesse than power in the paint, as he was not overpoweringly physical as a rebounder or shot-blocker (in part because of relatively small hands). Was very streaky."
