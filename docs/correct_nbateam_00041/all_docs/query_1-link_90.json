        "text": "Did anybody else have a chance to catch the NBA Draft on\n\nThursday?\n\nWhat? No?\n\nWell, I don’t blame you. I watched the first 45 minutes\n\nand couldn’t take it any longer. My assignment, which I\n\nunwillingly chose to accept, was to watch the draft and see what\n\nimplications it had for former UCLA players.\n\nWhen I stopped watching at 5:15 p.m., the only connection I\n\ncould come up with was that Emeka Okafor is headed to the Charlotte\n\nBobcats to play with Jason Kapono, who used to play for UCLA and\n\nthe Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nPretty cool, huh?\n\nWhen I revisited the intelligent draft day commentary on\n\nESPN.com several hours after the draft’s conclusion, I was\n\nabsolutely shocked that no UCLA player was selected in the first\n\nround. No Trevor Ariza? No T.J. Cummings? But they played so well\n\nlast year for the Bruins.\n\nOK. So maybe I wasn’t shocked.\n\nAriza ended up being drafted by the New York Knicks with the\n\n43rd selection. Cummings went un-drafted. And there you have\n\nit.\n\nSo now what do you say? What can you say?\n\nTrevor Ariza is a fool. I guess that’s a decent place to\n\nstart. By deciding to leave UCLA and enter the NBA Draft, Ariza\n\nprobably made one of the most stupid decisions anyone could\n\nmake.\n\nBecause he was drafted in the second round he isn’t\n\nguaranteed a contract. Though the Knicks seem to like him ““\n\ndespite the fact he never even worked out for the team ““\n\nnothing is for sure.\n\nI didn’t understand it when he made the decision to leave\n\nschool. And I don’t understand it now.\n\nAriza could have gained so much by returning to UCLA for his\n\nsophomore season. He’s certainly an incredible player ““\n\nthere’s no denying that.\n\nBut he has a long way to go before he can make a real impact in\n\nthe NBA.\n\nAt Ariza’s press conference it was clear that coach Ben\n\nHowland, Ariza’s mother and almost everyone else had\n\nencouraged Ariza to stay in Westwood. Howland said college players\n\ntypically make their greatest strides as basketball players from\n\ntheir freshman to their sophomore seasons. Now Ariza won’t\n\nhave that luxury.\n\nCollege really is a luxury. You might not be making millions of\n\ndollars or rolling around in Cadillac Escalades, but it’s\n\nstill a pretty darn good time in one’s life. There are just\n\nso few things to worry about. My friend’s dad always asks him\n\nhow school is going with the question, “How’s your\n\nfour-year vacation?” The vacation must be even better if\n\nyou’re an athlete. For Ariza, the vacation is over.\n\nThere seems to be a general consensus that his draft stock would\n\nhave risen markedly ““ maybe even to lottery status ““\n\nhad he stayed another season in Westwood. He would have started,\n\nmost likely led the team in scoring, and benefited mightily from\n\nthe tremendous freshmen class Howland is bringing in.\n\nBut now he may or may not be in New York next season, spending a\n\nlot of his time on the bench. Well, good luck.\n\nAnd good luck to T.J. Cummings, who went about things the right\n\nway by staying in school. I actually kind of feel sorry for the\n\nguy, as I do for most seniors who are passed over in favor of young\n\nkids who have been determined to have a greater\n\n“upside.”\n\nSo now the draft is over, and teams will get to start looking at\n\ntheir talent ““ or lack thereof ““ and making decisions\n\nfor the coming NBA season, which will be boring as usual until the\n\nplayoffs come around.\n\nThe saddest part of such young kids’ being drafted into\n\nthe NBA ““ those “what-if” questions that always\n\nlinger. What if Kobe had gone to Duke? What if Kwame Brown had gone\n\nto college rather than ruining his life?\n\nCollege basketball, for whatever reason, is inherently better\n\nthan NBA basketball. Players care more, games are more exciting,\n\nand there is no better sporting event than the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThat’s why the NBA Draft depresses me. I see so many young\n\nkids going straight to the pros when they definitely could do\n\nsomething special in the college ranks. Ask Carmelo Anthony,\n\nbecause Dwight Howard doesn’t know what he’s\n\nmissing.\n\nSo what have we learned here today?\n\nWell, UCLA didn’t really shake things up in this\n\nyear’s draft. Its only player drafted is a fool for leaving\n\nschool. (Hey. That rhymes.) And I challenge anyone to watch all\n\nfour and a half hours of draft coverage next year. It’s not\n\nexactly compelling television."
