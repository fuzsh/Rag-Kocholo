CHARLOTTE, N.C. â€” The Charlotte Bobcats will be without starting center Kwame Brown against Andrew Bogut and the Milwaukee Bucks.

Coach Paul Silas says Brown left the team after shootaround Monday to go to Georgia to be with his sick daughter. With backup center Joel Przybilla also still out with a sore knee, Tyrus Thomas will start and tangle with Bogut in his return after missing two games with bruised ribs.

The Bobcats are expected to have forward Stephen Jackson despite him missing shootaround with an illness. Backup point guard Shaun Livingston is also slowed by a twisted ankle.

The Bobcats entered the night trailing eighth-place Indiana by one game for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
