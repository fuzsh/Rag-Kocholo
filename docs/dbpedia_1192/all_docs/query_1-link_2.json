        "text": "“Live My Life” is a song by American group Far East Movement from their fourth studio album Dirty Bass. It features vocals from Canadian pop singer Justin Bieber. The song was released on February 28, 2012 as the album's lead single. The song was produced by RedOne and De Paris.\n\nBackground[]\n\nFar East Movement met Justin Bieber through Snoop Dogg at the Billboard Music Awards. Snoop Dogg introduced them to Justin Bieber. They wanted to make a club song that bridges the gap between the young audience and their audience. When the song came out, Far East Movement played it for RedFoo from LMFAO and he wanted to do a remix.[1]\n\nMusic video[]\n\nA music video to accompany the release of \"Live My Life\" was first released onto YouTube on April 5, 2012 at a total length of four minutes and forty-three seconds. The video however, does not feature Justin Bieber, who is featured on the song. Redfoo of LMFAO appears on the video, even though he is not featured on the original song, but is on the remix.\n\nFar East Movement sent Bieber one of those party-favor cards saying, 'You are invited to the Far East Movement/Justin Bieber video shoot,' but he was working on his thing so he couldn't make it.[2]\n\nThey are seen throughout the video touring and dancing through the streets of Amsterdam in the Party Rock bus, was filmed in the Netherlands. They also perform a synchronized dance routine in a flash mob-style. Dutch singer Eva Simons cameos in the video, seen entering the party bus midway through the video, as well as Dutch DJs Sidney Samson, Sick Individuals and Quintino.\n\nTrack listing[]\n\nDigital download – single[]\n\nLive My Life (featuring Justin Bieber)\n\nDigital download – remix[]\n\nLive My Life (Party Rock Remix) (featuring Justin Bieber and Redfoo)\n\nCD single[]\n\nLive My Life (featuring Justin Bieber)\n\nLive My Life (Party Rock Remix) (featuring Justin Bieber and Redfoo)\n\nDigital download – EP[]\n\nLive My Life (featuring Justin Bieber)\n\nLive My Life (Party Rock Remix) (featuring Justin Bieber and Redfoo)\n\nLive My Life (Wideboys Full Club Remix) (featuring Justin Bieber)\n\nJello\" (featuring Rye Rye)\n\nLyrics[]\n\n[Intro - Justin Bieber]\n\nI’m gonna live my life\n\nNo matter what, we party tonight\n\nI’m gonna li-li-live my life\n\nI know that we gon’ be alright\n\n[Far East Movement]\n\nYo, hell yeah, dirty bass\n\nGhetto girl, you drive me cray\n\nHell yeah, dirty bass\n\nYo, yo\n\nThis beat make me go wow\n\nThis drink make me fall down\n\nI party hard like carnival\n\nLet’s burn this motha down\n\nThis bass make me go ache (go ache)\n\nThis girl circus so late\n\nYou’re that telly cake with a cali shake\n\nI got dough, who’s down to fake\n\nOh my, dirty bass\n\nOh you got it like that\n\nI can work that bad\n\nLet me get that\n\n(get your ass on the floor)\n\nOh my, dirty bass\n\nOh you got that small\n\nI can break that off\n\nLet me get that\n\n(get your ass on the floor)\n\n[Justin Bieber - Chorus]\n\nI’m gonna live my life\n\nNo matter what, we party tonight\n\nI’m gonna li-li-live my life\n\nI know that we gon’ be alright\n\nI’m gonna live my life\n\nNo matter what, we party tonight\n\nI’m gonna li-li-live my life\n\nI know that we gon’ be alright\n\nWo-oh oh, wo-oh oh,\n\nI know that we gon’ be alright\n\nWo-oh oh, wo-oh oh\n\nI know that we gon’ be alright\n\n[Far East Movement]\n\nYo, hell yeah, dirty bass\n\nGhetto girl, you drive me cray\n\nHell yeah, dirty bass\n\nNo matter where we be at VIP, or in the ceiling\n\nAll we need to start it is the speakers in my chit-chat\n\nI spot a couple hotties\n\nHolla, we’re the party, we that\n\nGirl move it like pilates\n\nPut your head where you knee at\n\nOh my, dirty bass\n\nOh you got it like that\n\nI can work that bad\n\nLet me get that\n\n(get your ass on the floor)\n\nOh my, dirty bass\n\nOh you got that small\n\nI can break that off\n\nLet me get that\n\n(get your ass on the floor)\n\n[Justin Bieber - Chorus]\n\nI’m gonna live my life\n\nNo matter what, we party tonight\n\nI’m gonna li-li-live my life\n\nI know that we gon’ be alright\n\nI’m gonna live my life\n\nNo matter what, we party tonight\n\nI’m gonna li-li-live my life\n\nI know that we gon’ be alright\n\n[Bridge]\n\nThis is my moment tonight\n\nHell yeah we doing it right\n\nSo get your hands up in the air\n\nLike we living your life\n\nThis is my moment tonight\n\nHell yeah we doing it right\n\nSo get your hands up in the air\n\nLike we living your life\n\n[Justin Bieber - Chorus]\n\nI’m gonna live my life\n\nNo matter what, we party tonight\n\nI’m gonna li-li-live my life\n\nI know that we gon’ be alright\n\nI’m gonna live my life\n\nNo matter what, we party tonight\n\nI’m gonna li-li-live my life\n\nI know that we gon’ be alright\n\nCredits[]\n\nCredits adapted from Tidal.[3]\n\nProducer: De Paris / RedOne\n\nComposer: Bilal Hajji / Jae Won Choung / James Hwan Roh / Jean Claude Sindress / Jonathan Maman / Justin Bieber / Kevin Michael Nishimura / NADIR KHAYAT / Nathan Lawrence Walker / Virman Coquia Pau / Yohanul Simon\n\nLyricist: Bilal Hajji / Jae Won Choung / James Hwan Roh / Jean Claude Sindress / Jonathan Maman / Justin Bieber / Kevin Michael Nishimura / NADIR KHAYAT / Nathan Lawrence Walker / Virman Coquia Pau / Yohanul Simon\n\nFeatured Artist: Justin Bieber"
