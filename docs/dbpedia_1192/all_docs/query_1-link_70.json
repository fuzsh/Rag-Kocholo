The Seerah Song is educational, emotional and soothing.\n\nBefore the song’s release, Zain Bhikha posted the following statement on his Instagram page, giving us a clue as to how big the Seerah song would be:\n\nIt’s been many years in the making and we’re finally ready to share a sneak peak with you!\n\nZain Bhikha\n\nInitial release of the Seerah Song had it split into many different parts, these came out towards the end of Ramadan 2021, while the full song released just after Eid Ul-Fitr in one part.\n\nBut what does Seerah mean?\n\nDefinition of Seerah:\n\nAs-Seerah an-Nabawiyyah (commonly shortened to Sīrah, and translated as prophetic biography, are the traditional Muslim biographies of Muhammad from which, in addition to the Quran and Hadiths, most historical information about his life and the early period of Islam is derived.\n\nWikipedia\n\nThe 25 minute song is about the biography of the prophet.\n\nLet’s take a look at the video and lyrics, before analysing the meaning behind the Seerah Song Nasheed.\n\nSeerah Song Music Video\n\nAnalysis of the Seerah Song Lyrics\n\nThe Seerah song brakes down into the following parts. Let’s discuss each part in more detail.\n\nThe Age of Ignorance\n\nThe Noble Birth\n\nHis Lineage\n\nInfancy and Youth\n\nCommissioning of Prophethood\n\nThe Call to Islam\n\nThe Early Meccan Period\n\nThe Late Meccan Period\n\nThe Great Migration (Hijra)\n\nThe Medinan Period\n\nThe Conquest Of Mecca\n\nThe Farewell Hajj & Final Illness\n\nLonging For The Prophet (Peace And Blessings Be Upon Him)\n\nJudgement Day And Beyond\n\nPraise For The Prophet\n\n1. The Age Of Ignorance\n\nIt had been 600 years since the earth had seen a guide\n\nFrom the time of the messiah who had not been crucified\n\nBut before he was raised up to bani’ Israel he said\n\nAfter me will come a messenger whose name will be Ahmed\n\nIn the centuries that followed humankind had gone astray\n\nFrom the message of the prophets and the pure and natural way\n\nThey had turned to man-made idols filled with ignorance and pride\n\nTaking Gods besides Allah so that his oneness was denied\n\nLet’s analyse the song lyrics to section one, the age of ignorance.\n\nBefore Islam, the people of Mecca would perform Hajj, gather around the Kaaba and worship a God they called Allah.\n\nSounds good right?… Wrong\n\nTheir Hajj was not the same as the one we perform today, their Kaaba was full of idols and while they believed in Allah they thought of him as a God of all Gods, rather than the one true God.\n\nIn short, the way they practised their faith was far from the original teachings of the previous prophets, such as Jesus, Moses and Ibrahim (Peace be upon them).\n\nReferences to Quran\n\nZain Bhikha makes reference to the Messiah (Jesus) as one who had not been crucified. A direct reference to the Quran:\n\nAnd for their saying, “Surely we killed the Masih, Isa son of Maryam, (The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary) the Messenger of Allah.” And in no way did they kill him, and in no way did they crucify him, but a resemblance of him was presented to them (i.e. the matter was made obscure for them through mutual resemblance)…\n\n(Quran 4:157)\n\nHe also mentions that Jesus prophesied the coming of the Prophet Ahmed (short for Muhammed). The coming of the Prophet Muhammed is mentioned in the Bible in many places, such as the Book of John.\n\n“There is so much more I want to tell you, but you can’t bear it now. But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he‘ll speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come. And He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you.\n\n(Bible – John 16:12-14)\n\nThe Quran also recorded his statement:\n\nJesus, son of Mary, said, ‘Children of Israel, I am sent to you by God, confirming the Torah that came before me and bringing good news of a messenger to follow me whose name will be Ahmad.’\n\n(Quran 61:6)\n\nAlready, the Seerah song is full of Quranic references and deep meaning. Let’s check out part two of the Seerah Song.\n\n2. Nobel Birth of the Prophet\n\nAll the weak ones oppressed and many wrongs were seen as right\n\nIn the darkness mankind wandered till Allah would send his light\n\nOn a blessed day in springtime in the year called ‘Aam al-Fil\n\nIn the desert town of Mecca was to come the final seal\n\nAbdullah the prophet’s father never lived to see his son\n\nAminah was honoured by Allah to bear the chosen one\n\nPraised in heaven and on earth he graced the world that Monday morn\n\nAlah’s mercy filled the universe when Muhammad was born\n\nThe prophet’s father’s name was Abdullah while his mother’s name was Amina.\n\nAbdullah means the slave of Allah, as mentioned previously the Arabs did believe in a God named Allah however their understanding of him was incorrect. This is the reason why we find references to Allah in pre-Islamic names.\n\nHis mother Amina’s name means Peace.\n\nIn fact it is believed that some of the Hindu scriptures prophesies the coming of the final messenger by stating the names of his parents.\n\nHere is an example:\n\nMuhammed’s Parents in Hindu Scriptures\n\nAccording to Kalki Purana, section 2, chapter 11, Kalki will be born from a woman called Sumâni and a man called Vishnubhagat. Vishnubhagat stands for the servant of Vishnu “slave of Allâh = ‘Abdullâh” (i.e. Muhammad’s father) and Sumâni stands for peace/calmness (i.e. the Arabic “Âminah” (i.e. Muhammad’s mother). The name of his father is mentioned in two other books too.\n\nSadly the prophet’s father passed away without having ever seen him, and his mother passed away when he was very young. Therefore the prophet Muhammed (PBUH) was raised as an orphan.\n\nThe Seerah Song then moves on to talk about the Prophet’s lineage in part three.\n\n3. The Prophets Lineage\n\nHe was son of Abdullah, who was Abdul Muttalib’s son\n\nSon of Hashim, then Abdu Manaf, the brave and handsome one\n\nThen Qusay, and then Kilab, then Murrah, then Ka’b then Lu’ay\n\nSon of Ghalib, son of Fi-hr, or Quraysh, as they would say\n\nTo Adnan, the father of the Arabs, trace his family tree\n\nFor it leads to Ibrahim, through Ismail, his progeny\n\nSo his light was passed from noble loins through home so chased and pure\n\nOnce it came into the world it would abide forevermore\n\nIf I asked you to name your Grandfather you probably could, perhaps even your great Grandfather. However, many modern day people would struggle to go beyond that point.\n\nDo you agree?\n\nIn fact the Arabs at the time of the prophet Muhammed (pbuh) would be able to trace their lineage all the way back to Adan. They placed great emphasis on their lineage and would understand which bloodline they descended were from.\n\nBelow is an idea of the Lineage of the prophet, take some time to ponder over this large family tree from Muhammed to Adam (pbut).\n\nZain Bhikha manages to get through 15 of these names in this part of the Seerah Song (including Muhammed). Who would have thought a song could be so educational?\n\nJust a thought. Many kids (and adults) know the name of at least 150 Pokemon. However there are only 147 names on this list. Perhaps we can learn the names of the Prophets and their fathers too?\n\n4. Prophet’s Infancy and youth\n\nAs an infant, he was suckled by Halima after birth\n\nTurned away by other wet nurses who did not know his worth\n\nThough the best of God’s creation seemed in front of them, helpless\n\nStill a day would come when they would turn to him in their duress\n\nAngels bathed his heart in zamzam and replaced it in his chest\n\nThose around him knew this blessed child was different from the rest\n\nRaised by uncle Abu Talib after both his parents died\n\nThough an orphan in his early years, Allah was by his side\n\nHe protected him and saved him from the evil and obscene\n\nSo trustworthy was he known to be, they called him al-Ameen\n\nClouds would race to shade him and the trees would bow down in respect\n\nThose bestowed with sacred inside knew that he was the Elect\n\nAs the prayer of prophet Abraham and Jesus’ good news\n\nHe was mentioned in the scriptures of the Christians and the Jews. He was\n\nNoblest in his lineage, in virtue, without peers\n\nHe was loved among his people till the age of 40 years\n\nWhile the people worshiped many Gods he knew Allah was one\n\nIn a cave he would pray to Allah not seen by anyone\n\nThe prophet Muhammed was given to a Bedouin family who lived in the dessert at a young age, as this was thought to be healthy for the child. Hamila was the name of his wet nurse or fostered mother.\n\nOne day, the Prophet was playing with a couple boys when the angel Gabriel approached him.\n\nCleaning his Heart\n\nThe angel opened his chest, washed his heart and put it back together.\n\nPhysically!\n\nThe prophet’s fostered family were shocked at what had happened and they sent the prophet back to his mother, who claimed that the prophet was a very special child. One of the reasons for this was because Amina had not experienced the usual problems associated with being pregnant when giving birth to Muhammed (pbuh).\n\nSadly his mother died when he was six years old and he was then looked after by his uncle Abu Talib.\n\nThe Cave\n\nThe prophet Muhammed (pbuh) was a good man. For example, he was known as the trustworthy, a man who never lied.\n\nHe never really believed in idol worship as the rest of his tribe did.\n\nAt night the prophet would travel to a cave known as the cave of Hira, where he would reflect on the purpose of life.\n\nAllah had revealed former books such as the Torah (old testament) and Injeel (new testament) and in them mentioned that there would be a messenger to come later in life, who would complete the religion for mankind. Although, Muhammed himself would live the first 40 years of his life without knowledge of the task ahead.\n\n5. Commissioning of Prophethood\n\nTill one night, there came upon him revelation from Allah\n\nJibril appeared before him as his heart was filled with awe\n\nThen enveloped by the angel he was squeezed, for breath, he fought\n\nWhen the angel said recite all he replied was I cannot\n\nOn the third time he was squeezed he asked “what shall I then recite”?\n\nAnd Allah’s eternal words came down, revealed to men that night\n\nThe Visit from the Angel\n\nThe song gets emotional. The drums slow down, so does the pace.\n\nZain Bhikha sings about the moment when the Angel spoke to Muhammed (pbuh) for the first time, in the cave of Hira.\n\nThe prophet Muhammed sat in the cave one night, and the Angel Gabriel came to him. The Angel squeezed the prophet and said ‘Iqra’ which means to read or recite.\n\nThe prophet was an illiterate man. He could not read nor write. As a result, the prophet replied ‘I cannot read’.\n\nThe Angel repeated the word Iqra again, and the same thing happened.\n\nOn the third occasion the Angel said ‘Read in the name of your lord who created you from an Alaq’. Alaq means a clot, leech like substance or something that clings. Here it is describing the human embryo in it’s early stages of development.\n\nRead, ˹O Prophet,˺ in the Name of your Lord Who created, created humans from a clinging clot, Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous, Who taught by the pen, taught humanity what they knew not.\n\n(Quran 96:1-5)\n\nAt this point the Seerah Song slows down and you might be misled into thinking the song has finished. However, this is not the case. Zain picks the song back up and continues singing about the life of the prophet, with part six focusing on the call to Islam.\n\n6. The Call to Islam\n\nAs the prophet left the cave distressed for home he made a start\n\nThere he found his wife Khatijah her support consoled his heart\n\nJibril would come to him with revelation crystal clear\n\nAs Allah’s beloved messenger he had nothing to fear\n\nSo first quietly then openly the prophet made his call\n\nThat the people leave their pagan ways and witness one and all\n\nThat there’s no god but Allah by his will alone I speak\n\nHe alone is who we worship and from him all aid we seek\n\nThe prophet had an amazing wife, Khatijah, who supported him after hearing his story of how the Angel approached him.\n\nThe prophet did not go out and preach in public in the early years, rather he would learn about Islam through the revelation being recited to him, and inform those who were closest to him.\n\nThe last lines of this section speak the Shahada (testimony of faith), which can be found in various places in the Quran:\n\nSo know, [O Muḥammad], that there is no deity except Allah and ask forgiveness for your sin1 and for the believing men and believing women. And Allah knows of your movement and your resting place.\n\n(Quran 47-19)\n\nThere is a big difference between the early and late Meccan period, in the prophet’s approach and instructions.\n\n7. The Early Meccan Period\n\nHe would call the people to Allah and day and night implore\n\nIf you love Allah then follow me he’ll love you even more\n\nOnce the pagans threw some waste on him as he bowed down in prayer\n\nThey were laughing while his daughter cried but he did not despair\n\nFor Allah with those people who put all their trust in him\n\nAnd the lord was with his prophet peace and blessings be on him\n\nOne by one the hearts began to turn towards the guiding light\n\nAs Islam rescued the downtrodden and gave to them their right\n\nThough Bilal was tortured in the Sun, Sumayyah put to death\n\nStill they held tight to their faith and they would say to their last breath\n\nThe first Quranic revelations focused on the core message of Islam.\n\nWhat is the core message of Islam?\n\nThe core message of Islam is to worship God alone without any partners.\n\nThose who followed the teachings started moving away from Idol worship and paying to God directly. But it was not easy. The non-Muslims tortured people for following Muhammed (pbuh) and some people were even killed.\n\nAs Islam grew in popularity so did the tension between the new Muslims and the Pagans.\n\n8. The Late Meccan Period\n\nAfter losing wife and uncle and the boycott of his clan\n\nAfter Ta’if, where they stoned him, came a gift from Al-Rahman\n\nAs he lay asleep beside the noble Kaaba in the night\n\nHe was woken by the angel and then taken up in flight\n\nRiding on Burak he made the journey that night called Isra\n\nTo the city of Jerusalem to Masjid Al-Aqsa\n\nThere he led the prophets in a prayer and chose milk over wine\n\nThen ascended to the heavens for a trust with the divine\n\nRaised beyond the seven sky so many wonderous sights he saw\n\nTill he crossed the furthest Lote-tree for his discourse with Allah\n\nSent back on that very night he brought a gift for his ummah\n\nOn the next day Muslims stood with him to pray their first Salah\n\nThe prophet travelled from Mecca to Jerusalem in one night, and then ascended to the heavens where he met several other prophets and Allah – known as The Night Journey.\n\nThe Story of the Night Journey\n\nOne night, the Prophet was sleeping in the semi-circle portion of the Kaaba, when the Angel came to him and cleaned his heart once again.\n\nJibril presented the prophet with a horse with wings, called Barak. Barak did not fly but took large steps, each step being as far as the eye could see.\n\nThe prophet reached Masjid Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem rather quickly. All prophets were present in Jerusalem (old city) and Muhammed led them in prayer.\n\nThe prophet then proceeded to the large rock which currently sits under the Dome of the Rock. It was from here he ascended into the heavens.\n\nThe prophet travelled from the first heaven all the way to the seventh, meeting prophets on the way. Firstly, he met Adam the father of mankind. Secondly, he met Jesus and John in the second heaven. A complete list below:\n\nSeven Heavens of the Night Journey\n\nThe prophet ascended from one heaven to the other, meeting the following prophets on the way:\n\nAdam\n\nJesus and John\n\nYusuf\n\nIdris\n\nAaron\n\nMoses\n\nIbrahim\n\nJibril escorted the Prophet towards the Lote-Tree, which is the gateway to Allah. Jibril cannot pass this point and therefore asked the prophet to proceed to Allah alone.\n\nReceiving 50 Prayers\n\nWhen the prophet returned, he descended back through the seven heavens and met Moses again along the way. Moses asked what Allah had given him, and Muhammed replied he had been given 50 prays a day.\n\nThat’s right… 50 prayers a day!\n\nMoses told him that his people will not be able to handle it and to ask for a reduction. So the prophet went back and asked for a reduction in the number of prayers. Allah reduced the prayers but Moses said it was still too much. Therefore, the process repeated itself until the number of prayers reduced to just 5.\n\nLook at it this way\n\nEach of the 5 prayers are worth 10 points, bringing the total to the original 50.\n\nSo, when you struggle to pray, remember that you are actually getting 10 for the price of one.\n\nThe Seerah Song now shifts focus from Mecca to the migration to Medina.\n\n9. The Great Migration (Hijrah)\n\nAt the time of Hajj the prophet shared Islam with every clan\n\nWhen the truth spread to Medina the Quraysh devised the plan\n\nAs they hatched the plot to kill him came Allah’s divine command\n\nFor the message to continue he would have to leave his land\n\nAnd then he and Abu Bakr left their cherished home on route\n\nTo Medina for the Hijrah with the pagans in pursuit\n\nAs they hid inside a cave one time a Pagen almost saw\n\nBut what do you think of two people when the third one is Allah?\n\nWith Islam spreading rapidly in Mecca, the Pagans had had enough, and devised a plan to Kill the prophet Muhammed (pbuh).\n\nAllah commanded the Muslims to migrate from Mecca to Yathrib.\n\nWhat is Yathrib?.. It’s the former name for Medina.\n\nThe Muslims left for Media with the Arabs in Pursuit. However, Allah protected the Muslims by ensuring they did not get caught.\n\nThe last line of this section is superb. It’s actually a reference to the following Hadith in which the Prophet says the same:\n\nThe Prophet ﷺ said, “What do you think O Abu Bakr of two people, whose third is Allah?”\n\n(Sahih al-Bukhari)\n\n10. The Medinan Period\n\nWhile the people were awaiting him at last the prophet came\n\nLight and joy filled all Medina it would never be the same\n\nThen from joining them in brotherhood and leading them in prayer\n\nHe made peace between the neighbours teaching them with love and care\n\nWhen at Badr they first met Quarysh the Angels came and fought\n\nThen at Uhud when mistakes were made some lessons would be taught\n\nThey would fight for truth and justice while upholding chivalry\n\nThey’d show strength when they were weak when strong they would show clemency\n\nIn the battle of the trench they chose to fight defensively\n\nAt the triumph of holder they used diplomacy\n\nSo the Muslim ummah grew with every test that it survived\n\nTill the time to liberate the town of Mecca had arrived\n\nThe Quranic verses Allah revealed in Medina are quite different to those revealed in Mecca.\n\nWhy?\n\nMuhammed (pbuh) was now a leader. He ruled people in a land and therefore Allah’s commandments focused on bringing rules and laws for him to implement.\n\nPreviously, the Muslims could not fight. However, Allah granted permission now that the Muslims were under threat. Muslims had permission to fight in battles but under strict criteria.\n\nConditions for War\n\nIn brief, war is permitted:\n\nIn self defence\n\nWhen other nations have attacked an Islamic state\n\nIf another state is oppressing its own Muslims\n\nand war is conducted:\n\nIn a disciplined way so as to avoid injuring non-combatants\n\nWith the minimum necessary force\n\nWithout anger\n\nWith humane treatment towards prisoners of war\n\nWithout cutting down plants or trees unless necessary\n\nMuhammed (pbuh) led his people in many battles, in some they were victorious while in others they did not succeed.\n\nAfter living in Medina, it was time for the prophet to move back to where it all began.\n\n11. The Conquest of Mecca\n\nMarching into Mecca unopposed the Muslims were now strong\n\nWhen the pagans saw the prophet they knew that they had been wrong\n\nFor so long they had oppressed him now they feared he would repay\n\nBut he said like prophet Yusuf there’s no blame on you today\n\nAs the idols at the Kaaba fell he said truth now appears\n\nAnd the falsehood has but perished falsehood always disappears\n\nThen the people came to truth just as the prophecy foretold\n\nFor Allah had sent Muhammad as a mercy to the world\n\nThe prophet and his now large army marched into Mecca, and conquered it.\n\nThe current inhabitants of Mecca panicked as they thought Muhammed (pbuh) would have them executed. However, that was not the case. Muhammed (pbuh) forgave them.\n\nMecca was now a Muslim city, and the Idols that once stood inside the Kaaba were removed.\n\nThe Farwell Hajj and Final Sermon\n\nBut the day was fast approaching that they all had thought was far\n\nFirst he told all his companions that this Hajj would be his last\n\nTo adhere to all the things that he had taught them in the past\n\nThen when seeing of a traveller these parting words he gave\n\nWhen you come next year you might find just my Masjid and my grave\n\nWhen the time to part came closer all the hearts were filled with fear\n\nWhat will happen if he leaves us in this world there’s none more dear\n\nIn his final illness Abu Bakr led the daily prayer\n\nFrom his room the prophet smiled giving one last look of care\n\nThen as our beloved prophet lay in Aisha’s arms he spoke\n\nGod you praise and fear Allah in how you treat your servant folk\n\nThen he gazed towards the heavens and begin to say softly\n\nAllah huma gather me into the highest company\n\nAnd with that the prophet left this world the universe shed tears\n\nAll the precious time they’d had with him had been the best of years\n\nThe prophet informed his companions that he would be performing his final Hajj.\n\nFriday the 9th of Dhu al-Hijjah 10 AH (6 March 632), the prophet gave his farewell sermon on top of mount Arafat during Hajj.\n\nFarwell Sermon\n\nThe last sermon was a powerful reminder of everything he had taught.\n\nSigns he will be leaving\n\n“O People, lend me an attentive ear, for I know not whether after this year, I shall ever be amongst you again. Therefore listen to what I am saying to you very carefully and take these words to those who could not be present here today.\n\nGeneral Rulings\n\nO People, just as you regard this month, this day, this city as sacred, so regard the life and property of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your Lord, and that He will indeed reckon your deeds. Allah has forbidden you to take usury (interest); therefore all interest obligations shall henceforth be waived. Your capital, however, is yours to keep. You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity. Allah has judged that there shall be no interest and that all the interest due to Abbas ibn Abdul Muttalib (the Prophet’s uncle) shall henceforth be waived…\n\nBeware of Satan, for the safety of your religion. He has lost all hope that he will ever be able to lead you astray in big things, so beware of following him in small things.\n\nTreatment of Women\n\nO People, it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women, but they also have rights over you. Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under Allah’s trust and with His permission. If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers. And it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve, as well as never to be unchaste.\n\nFive Pillars of Islam\n\n“O People, listen to me in earnest, worship Allah, perform your five daily prayers (salah), fast during the month of Ramadan, and give your wealth in zakat. Perform Hajj if you can afford it.\n\nNo to Racism\n\nAll mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black nor does a black have any superiority over a white, except by piety and good action.\n\nLearn that every Muslim is a brother to every Muslim and that the Muslims constitute one brotherhood. Nothing shall be legitimate to a Muslim which belongs to a fellow Muslim unless it was given freely and willingly. Do not, therefore, do injustice to yourselves.\n\nJudgement Day\n\nRemember, one day you will appear before Allah and answer for your deeds. So beware, do not stray from the path of righteousness after I am gone.\n\nSeal of the Faith\n\nO People, no prophet or apostle will come after me and no new faith will be born. Reason well, therefore, O People, and understand words which I convey to you. I leave behind me two things, the Quran and my example, the Sunnah, and if you follow these you will never go astray.\n\nDo Dawah\n\nAll those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again; and may the last ones understand my words better than those who listen to me directly. Be my witness, O Allah, that I have conveyed your message to your people”.\n\n(https://humanappeal.org.uk/news/2020/07/the-farewell-sermon-of-the-prophet-muhammad-pbuh)\n\n13. Longing for the Prophet (PBUH)\n\nHow I wish i’d met the prophet to touch his soft hands with mine\n\nOr to look upon his face from which prophetic light would shine\n\nOr to shield him when the rocks were thrown so they’d hit me instead\n\nBut my consolation comes in what Rasool Allah had said\n\nWhile my life was good for you, my death will be good for you too\n\nI’ll be shown your deeds so when I see you sin i’ll pray for you\n\nAnd he said oh people if you one day face calamity\n\nFind your strength by thinking of the pain you felt by losing me\n\nWhen he missed his brothers his companions asked then who are we\n\n“Friends” he said my brothers never saw me yet believed in me\n\nThe song switches its focus to longing for the Prophet now that he is gone.\n\nThe lyrics place emphasises on his importance even for people living in the 21st century.\n\nFor example, Zain Bhikha makes reference to a hadith in which the prophet said that he is brothers with those who believe in him, but have never seen him (i.e. us)\n\nAnas ibn Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “I wish I could meet my brothers.” The Prophet’s companions said, “Are we not your brothers?” The Prophet said, “You are my companions, but my brothers are those who have faith in me although they never saw me.”\n\n(Source: Musnad Aḥmad 12169)\n\n14. Judgement Day and Beyond\n\nIf you long to meet the messenger then patience is the key\n\nAt the start of the hereafter you will see him finally\n\nHe will be the leader of humanity on judgment day\n\nAfter all he was the messenger when Adam was still clay\n\nWhen the prophets on that day were only say Nafsi Nafsi\n\nHe will plead before Allah crying my ummah ummati\n\nHe will bow and praise Allah in words no one before has said\n\nHe’ll be granted intercession as he lifts his noble head\n\nHe will beg a lot to pardon us so sinner don’t despair\n\nHe won’t take his seat in heaven till his Ummah joins him there\n\nPeople will be running on the day of judgement, from one prophet to the other, asking for someone to ask Allah for their forgiveness.\n\nNafsi Nafsi = Myself Myself\n\nEven the prophets will be so concerned for themselves that they will not have time to focus on others.\n\nEach prophet will pass us onto another, until we reach Muhammed (PBUH), who will ask Allah to forgive us.\n\n15. Praise For The Prophet\n\nAllahhumma join us with your chosen prophet that day\n\nWhen the world is resurrected with the souls in disarray\n\nLet us gain his intercession when we take into account\n\nLet us quench our first forever when we meet him at his fount\n\nWhen a man once asked for heaven in the prophet’s company\n\nHelp me get you this he told him by prostrating frequently\n\nIf we fear that our good deeds are few and sins stacked high above\n\nOur last hope is as he told us you’ll be with the one you love\n\nBecause loving is believing and our faith is not yet whole\n\nTill we love him more than parent child and every single soul\n\nIn the final part of the song, Zain Bhikha places emphasis on praising the prophet Muhammed (pbuh), and meeting him in Paradise one day. Those who are lucky to meet him shall meet in a very special place.\n\nThe fountain in Jannah\n\nWe will meet him at a fountain and proceed to drink from it, after drinking from the fountain we will never be thirsty again.\n\nSahl ibn Sa’d reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “I will precede you at the Fountain. Whoever arrives at it and drinks from it, he will never feel thirst ever again. People will come to me and we will recognize each other, then a barrier will separate between us.”\n\n(Source: Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 7050, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 2290)\n\nZain Bhikha closes the song by encouraging us to love the prophet more than anyone else, including our own parents and children. Logically this makes sense, loving him means following him, which includes acts such as being good to elders and children.\n\nAnas ibn Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “None of you have faith until I am more beloved to him than his children, his father, and all of the people.”\n\n(Source: Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 15, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 44)\n\nThe Seerah Song continues with two additional verses about praising the prophet.
