        "text": "Marc Anthony version\n\nedit\n\n\"Vivir Mi Vida\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Viva la Vida.\n\nIn 2013, American singer Marc Anthony covered the Khaled song as a salsa tune titled \"Vivir Mi Vida\" (\"Live My Life\") for his studio album 3.0.[19] This version was produced by Sergio George and recorded at The Hit Factory Criteria in Miami, Florida.[20] Anthony performed it live at the 2013 Latin Billboard Music Awards.[21] The music video, directed by Carlos Perez of Elastic People, was released on September 10, 2013. \"Vivir Mi Vida\" won a Latin Grammy Award in 2013 for Record of the Year and holds the record for the second-longest run inside the top-five in the Billboard Latin Songs, with 51 weeks.[22] A \"Pop\" version was also produced using the instrumental of the original Khaled version and is included on the album.[23]\n\nIn 2017, Anthony's former wife Jennifer Lopez covered the song in her \"Spotify Session\" as a tribute to his late mother and her former mother-in-law. As of May 2021, the music video for Anthony's version of the song has received over 1 billion views on YouTube.[24]\n\nTrack listing\n\nedit\n\nChart performance\n\nedit\n\nCertifications\n\nedit\n\nHashem Melech\n\nedit\n\n\"Hashem Melech\"Single by Gad Elbaz and Beni ElbazReleasedJanuary 2013Music video on YouTube\n\nIsraeli singer Gad Elbaz created a new version of the song calling it \"Hashem Melech\" (in Hebrew ה' מלך) as a sort of contemporary Jewish worship song based on and adapted from \"C'est la vie\".[47]\n\nThe Israeli version released in January 2013 as a duet between Gad Elbaz and his singer father Beni Elbaz contains Hebrew and French lyrics, though the Hebrew lyrics are not related to Khaled's all-French original lyrics and more geared to religious content.[48] The chorus repeats the phrases (translation in parentheses and italics)\n\nHashem Melech (The Lord is King)\n\nHashem Malach (The Lord was King)\n\nHashem Yimloch (The Lord will be King)\n\nLe'olam Va'ed (Forever and ever)\n\nElbaz also released an all-Hebrew version of the song.[49] \"Hashem Melech\" was a minor hit in Israel and in Orthodox Jewish circles worldwide.\n\nThe Hebrew lyrics in the refrain are the same as those of a famous song also titled \"Hashem Melech\" by the well-known Jewish singer Yosef Karduner.\n\nIn September 2015, Elbaz released another limited version featuring additional vocals by the young Israeli child singer Yosef Chaim.[50][51]\n\nHashem Melech 2.0\n\nedit\n\n\"Hashem Melech 2.0\"Single by Gad Elbaz featuring NissimReleased2016Producer(s)Daniel FinkelmanMusic video on YouTube\n\nIn 2016, Elbaz teamed with Hasidic rapper Nissim (full name Nissim Baruch Black, born Damian Jamohl Black and a convert from Islam to Christianity and eventually to Judaism) to create a rap-infused version of the song now titled \"Hashem Melech 2.0\" to distinguish it from the original Elbaz version. The rap by Nissim is primarily English language, and is said to dominate the song, wrapping around and throughout the elements of the original \"1.0\" song.[52]\n\nStill a bilingual song, \"Hashem Melech\" now featured Hebrew and English lyrics instead. Elbaz' original French lyrics were dropped in favor of English in the new version, but his Hebrew lyrics were retained for the new version. Nissim's rap segments were all in English. The popularity of the second version far exceeded that of the first.\n\nDaniel Finkelman created a sophisticated, exuberant, multiracial dance video of the new version, set against the New York City skyline and streetscape. The New-York themed music video features Elbaz and Nissim dancing and delivering their religious message dancing joyously through the New York city streets and on skyscraper rooftops, amidst a changing New York skyline, encouraging listeners to believe in a better tomorrow.\n\nAli B version\n\nedit\n\nIn 2017, the Dutch rapper Ali B released the single \"Voy a Bailar\", largely an adaptation of the Khaled song but with adaptations from the Latin \"Vivir Mi Vida\" cover from Marc Anthony. Ali B added rap lyrics in Dutch. The release featured additional vocals by Boef, Rolf Sanchez and RedOne.\n\nCharts\n\nedit\n\nWeekly charts\n\nedit\n\nChart (2017) Peak\n\nposition Netherlands (Dutch Top 40)[53] 9 Netherlands (Single Top 100)[54] 13\n\nYear-end charts\n\nedit"
