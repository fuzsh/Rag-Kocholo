        "text": "~ ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ We‚Äôre at the start of June and it‚Äôs my first blogpost of 2022 üòÖ If you‚Äôre new here, I used to post regularly but writing about the topics I want to cover exhausts my emotional energy. Does anyone else also think this years gone by really fast? Life moves quickly sometimes. I have been busy and in short I‚Äôm occupied with Corporate; Charity and Creative work. There‚Äôs a lot I‚Äôve wanted to say about the Charity work in particular so if you‚Äôre interested or have specific topics in mind, leave a comment or get in touch üíö\n\nToday I‚Äôm sharing my reflections on The Lady of Heaven, what is described as an ‚Äúepic historical drama film‚Äù. The film interweaves a story focusing on the holy personality of Bibi Fatima s.a, the daughter of Prophet MuhammedÔ∑∫, with contemporary brutality of ISIS terrorists against Shia Muslims. The events of the film set in modern day Baghdad cleverly mirror the oppression faced by the Prophet Ô∑∫‚Äôs Shia following his death. It also overtly pays tribute to the suffering faced by Bibi Fatima s.a, as the start of the film hauntingly shows the murder of a mother named Fatima who was killed for being Shia. Ironically the actions of some Sunnis today now mirror the oppression and aggression showed in the film as they have been physically and verbally assaulting Shias and others who choose to support or watch it.\n\nFaces One of the primary causes of tension for the film is that it ‚Äúshows the face of the ProphetÔ∑∫‚Äù. I have a few points to make on this. I counted that a disclaimer specifying that holy faces were not physically shown came up on screen four or five times in total at the start and end of the screening. Refer to the 4th picture in the slideshow above that I captured whilst watching the film in cinema. For most of the scenes with the ProphetÔ∑∫ present, his face was angled away from the camera or there was light flowing from his face thus hiding his physical features. In some scenes a face was visible and this was achieved through CGI. A viral petition has been asserting that an actor was hired to play the ProphetÔ∑∫, but this is false. Some have even said that the face of Bibi Fatima s.a was shown in the film, but this is another false claim. Her face was never shown as her headscarf included a veil similar to a niqab. I‚Äôm certain that the people spreading these lies have not even seen the film. That being said I personally prefer for faces of holy figures to solely be represented through light and was a bit surprised when I saw the face of the ProphetÔ∑∫ and Imam Ali a.s. shown, albeit through visual effects. I recall a Shia who watched the film when it first screened in America saying a similar thing but that it wasn‚Äôt their biggest issue (we‚Äôll get onto that). Something else worth considering is that paintings of holy figures and religious personalities is accepted in some cultures. Showing the face of the ProphetÔ∑∫ seems to be an agreed ‚Äòno go‚Äô across the Western world (üá´üá∑üôÖüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è); however this is not the unanimous norm across the Middle East. In Iraq for example ‚Äìwhere the film was set‚Äì it is common for religious personalities to be honoured through artistic depictions such as paintings. This does in fact include the ProphetÔ∑∫. Take a look at the 7th photo above of an Iraqi painting of Imam Ali a.s for reference. In sum, the argument of the face is an issue of differing cultural norms and thus its understandable why it has been unsettling for some in the UK market. As someone who has actually seen the film, I would add that the difference between how the ProphetÔ∑∫ was portrayed here compared to what we have seen in the past in France for example comes down to respect. In France, Prophet MuhammedÔ∑∫ was literally illustrated as a caricature; whereas in the Lady of Heaven his face is only visible for a few brief moments and there is always glowing light present to symbolise his holy status.\n\nRacism The next point I thought was important to bring up was racism. My initial hesitation towards watching this film came from accusations of racism and because of this I lowered my expectations going in. Several of the antagonist‚Äôs including Abu Bakr and Aisha (who are father and daughter and thus share the same skin colour) were played by black actors which is where I believe the criticisms of racism stem from. My view now is that I don‚Äôt think the film is racist because there were other ‚Äòvillains‚Äô who were not played by black actors and there were positive and side characters who were also played by black actors. If it was revealed that the casting choices of the few antagonists who were played by black actors was indeed a conscious choice (*like in a typical Bollywood movie*) to evoke further negative feelings from the audience, then I would agree that the film is racist. The reason I am currently not siding with this view is because I lack the historical knowledge of whether or not Abu Bakr for example was actually black. If you do have this information then please pass it on and I‚Äôd be happy to make an edit and include it. Edit: Thank you to one reader who sent me a link evidencing that these figures were considered to be ‚Äúblack or very dark skinned‚Äù (photo 5). Someone else also told me that it would be unsurprising if they were black due to hijra (emigration).\n\nThe cloak I watched the film on its opening day with my mother by mere chance (photo 3) and some of my family watched it separately later the same day. Most of the rest of my (Sunni) family on the other hand are signing the petition to have the film removed. Those who watched it on June 3rd all agreed that one of the stand out scenes was of Hadith e Kisa. The story of the cloak was illustrated with simplicity and respect. Our highlight was the blue and white illuminated animation of angels in heaven who were shown to be looking down upon the household of the ProphetÔ∑∫ (with their faces not visible).\n\nTerrorism Another pro of the film is its exposure of ISIS. ISIS doesn‚Äôt need exposure in the sense of clout, we know who they are (if you don‚Äôt, it must be nice inside that bubble you‚Äôre in üò≥). Terrorism is a running theme in both time periods explored. In terms of ISIS, we witness their inhumanness up close and are exposed to things we may typically be sheltered from seeing. i.e. the cage of Shia men being burned to death. The film certificate does come with warnings for gore, and blood is shown but more so in the historical action scenes. I urge Sunnis to watch the beginning till when Fatima is murdered at least just to feel something about Shia deaths. In these six months alone far too many Shia lives have been lost to different terrorist attacks across the globe. Fatima could have been me; or my mother, and I‚Äôm sure other Shia viewers saw this too. We have absorbed so much grief that seeing it on screen was shattering and I think other people need to feel that as well. A different angle on exposure that was taken (minor spoiler warning) is when a little boy is forced to wear a suicide vest and bomb a mosque of Shias who were commemorating the martyrdom of Bibi Fatima s.a. This moving scene brings the helplessness of a little boy to the forefront. It highlighted that a lack of companionship is what may lead people to fall victim to ISIS as he laments that his friend ‚Äúleft‚Äù him the last time they met. Laith offers the boy a hug and he saves the worshippers. Laith later shares in a News interview that he hopes more people would learn the story of Lady Fatima s.a. I agree.\n\nActing Some people have said that the acting in the film was not too great. I thought it was generally fine but there was room for improvements. Laith (the son of Fatima who was murdered) for example was a bit stiff at times yet cute, but he‚Äôs only young so I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs fair. The pronunciation of certain names was a bit funny to me but I suppose it was intentional.\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once Allow me to make a digression for the sake of comparison and change of pace. ‚ÄòEverything Everywhere All at Once‚Äô (henceforth referred to as EEAO) is a film that came out last month but is only now dying down from its hype. It received high praise from movies goers and I saw many people say they were ‚Äúsobbing‚Äù whilst watching the movie. I enjoyed the film, but I wouldn‚Äôt be as eager to rewatch because there was too much going on visually for my liking. The film offered wonderful representation for the East Asian community and covered important themes such as acceptance for who you are, which is why I think it performed so well. The Lady of Heaven isn‚Äôt a film made for ‚ÄòShia representation‚Äô, however it offers that as a byproduct of the characters and themes. I did not shed a tear during EEAO, perhaps because I did not directly relate to it. My eyes did water at several points of The Lady of Heaven though. When the character Fatima was murdered and when Bibi Fatima s.a was physically attacked were notable moments. I brought up EEAO to say that it is a shame that Shia‚Äôs can‚Äôt have an ounce of the same representation and experience because people who dislike the film want to cause issues for those who don‚Äôt.\n\nDemographics With the previous point in mind, I am super curious to know the audience demographics. I was almost tempted to move to the stage when everything ended to take a quick survey and find out how many Shia/Sunni/non Muslims were in attendance. The screening I was in had five visibly presenting Muslims that I could see, besides myself and my mum. The majority of the crowd were middle aged white people who may or may not have been Muslim. The aura of the room felt respectful as heck and accepting. EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE ROOM STAYED TILL THE CREDITS FINISHED. That‚Äôs something out of the ordinary to me and we joked that people thought it was a Marvel film. Something else that struck me about this viewing was that people clapped at the end! I joined in out of confusion but it was quite sweet.\n\nRushed For what is quite a lengthy film my family pointed out that some bits felt a bit rushed. More context could have been given to certain events or personalities e.g. Aisha‚Äôs relationship with the ProphetÔ∑∫. I would have appreciated more time spent on the life of Bibi Fatima s.a. as the plot does of course cover chapters of her life, but the emphasis was more on her legacy and the application of the lessons from her life and death, rather a dedication to recounting her life story.\n\nProtests Saved the best till last (pls I‚Äôm kidding). Opposers of the film said it was made to cause disunity amongst muslims, but thats not true. The film did not mention Shia and Sunni, what it did was depict an account of history that some Muslims hold to be accurate. There is a petition circulating to have the film banned from the UK and it gained 84,000 signatures in a day. ‚ú®Coincidentally‚ú® some cinemas in Birmingham have already removed the film from their listings and it‚Äôs possible that others will follow suit. What I have seen in the two days since this film has been released is that it‚Äôs actually Sunni Muslims who have been causing divisions. Petitioning to remove a film because you dislike it is one thing, but chanting ‚ÄúShia kafir‚Äù (kafir = infidel) outside cinemas screening the film does not bode well with the camp of unity. A clip of a protester directly threatening the writer Yasser Al-Habib by name and saying that they will get the film banned in the UK was reacted to by Al-Habib himself and I can‚Äôt say he seems fazed. From my observation, those boycotting and protesting the film have caused more sectarian division than the film itself. Take a look at photos 8 & 9 in the commencing slideshow of a protest in Bradford, captured and kindly shared by a friend. My resounding thought after initially watching the film has been that the people protesting are those who should watch it. It really is so ironic that these ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù but not at all peaceful protests are taking place given the subject matter of the film. The universal message of Islam and any religion is of love and spreading peace is actually mentioned more than once in the film. In the speech given by Bilal at the request of the ProphetÔ∑∫ in Madina, the says that ‚Äúeveryone is free to practice their religion‚Äù. The Quran states that ‚Äúthere is no compulsion in religion‚Äù which is at odds with the actions of these protestors who mimic the extremist ‚Äòmy way or death‚Äô sentiment. It is again a shame that people who are checking up to hear each others verdicts of the film have to also ask if they were safe or ran into problems at the hands of protestors. Edit: Imam Qari Asim, Deputy Chair of the UK Government‚Äôs Anti-Muslim Hatred Working Group, has been stripped of his government positions due to his ‚Äúsupport for a campaign to limit free expression‚Äù as he publicly showed support for the protests. The letter linked above makes direct reference to ‚Äúanti-Shia hatred‚Äù which is a step in the right direction to expose the reality of anti-Shia discrimination in the UK.\n\n[Edit It‚Äôs been a week since I published this post and I‚Äôve had some new reflections I wanted to include. I planned to add this in sooner, but as you may guess from what I said at the start, I have not had the energy for it. I have added in more photos to the slideshow as well as a few additional comments to ‚ÄòFace‚Äô; ‚ÄòRacism‚Äô and ‚ÄòProtests‚Äô. The rest of my thoughts will be merged into this paragraph. Let‚Äôs begin by rewinding to the last line of the second paragraph in this post. The irony I mentioned is beyond ironic at this point. I‚Äôm deeply concerned by some of the things I have witnessed this past week. From open threats of murder against Shias (photo 12), to Sunnis refusing to take action in protecting Shias by taking a minute to report such heinous threats. The photo I just referenced is unfortunately one of many. As a Shia myself, I am not at all surprised at seeing such disgusting comments, however I decided to bring it to light on my Instagram for those who would be. I encouraged my followers to report people such as the boy in photo 12 because whilst Shias may be used to digesting prejudice on extreme levels, we can and need to change our reaction. ‚ÄòAllies‚Äô also need to step up because this is extremely draining for us to tackle alone. Although this example may have come from an immature boy who is hiding behind a keyboard, I personally cannot take the chance that he will not enact his threats. We cannot afford to not take this seriously. I will not become numb to Shias being killed by terrorists, and it alarms me that we live in a society where closet terrorists safely coexist amongst us. This is not a stretch as some people have actually been bringing photos of ISIS members along with them to protests. The police have made no arrests and I fail to understand why that is. I urge the police to investigate those making death threats against people who watch the film, or simply hold differing views to them. I also urge them to investigate the people who support these threats i.e. the people ‚Äòliking‚Äô, and ‚Äòretweeting‚Äô comments such as those shown in photo 12; which has since been removed from Twitter due to violating the website‚Äôs terms. It also saddens me that many Sunnis have chosen not to accept a basic call out to report potential terrorists. The link I had been sharing took the same amount of time to fill in as a the petition to ban the film. Hence why I am disappointed that I had to resort to convincing some of my own family members to file a report by stating that if we do not take action against such extremists today, they may claim my life tomorrow (photo 13). Call me an idealist, but I think the energy of those protesting would be better placed in calling out real oppression faced by the ummah. Or is it the case that the Shia portion of the ummah does not qualify for sympathy? Islam states that we are all equal but some still think they are ‚Äòmore equal‚Äô than others. Civilians in Afghanistan are facing daily persecution under Taliban rule, particularly Hazaras who are majority Shia. If more people speak about this we may be able to achieve some form of positive change. Something else I wanted to touch on is ‚ÄòShia akhlaq‚Äô because of a comment by a Shia Hazara I saw early last week. The comment suggested that Shias supporting the film have poor akhlaq; I disagree. If there are Shias who are showing support for the film by violently threatening those who oppose it (similar to the actions of some Sunnis) then I would definitely say that those groups have poor manners. Showing support in and of itself has nothing to do with akhlaq in my opinion. The film‚Äôs writer is a controversial figure (who I have no allegiance to) but supporting his film does not equate to supporting his personal views; if that is the angle implied in the person‚Äôs comment. If we talk about the film contents only as I have mostly focused on, Shias do hold the account of history given in this film to be true. That being the case, what is impolite about being in favour of a cinematic depiction of our version of history? Why are we trying to be respected by our oppressor? I will not water down my faith to appease the majority. Someone else told me that I cannot expect Sunnis to maintain positive relations with Shias as a consequence of this film being aired. Why? This film has just brought our religious differences to the big screen, I don‚Äôt think that validates the urge to be unpleasant towards those who do not share your view. Moreover I constantly witness slander against Shias and yet I‚Äôm able to maintain positive relations with Sunni Muslims. Yesterday happened to be the date of the latest protest in London. In the same way that I happened to watch the film on its release date due to being in the right place at the right time, I was also present at the location of yesterday‚Äôs protest when it was set to take place. When I was reminded of the protest (that ultimately seemed to have been cancelled) whilst I was already at its location, I decided to give a short interview for a Bengali News channel. This will be released if the channel decides to cover further developments surrounding the film as they had already covered a protest for it last week. The reporter initially tried to dissuade me from giving an interview as she explained that publicly sharing a view that opposes the overwhelming majority of the Bengali UK community would lead to my ostracisation. She advised me to be careful with this in mind and to stick to writing this blogpost which hides my face. I responded by telling her that I‚Äôm not scared of expressing my views because of potential bullies and I asked her to take a photo of me which I have now included in the slideshow (photo 18 üëãüèΩ). Before the reporter arrived I decided to visit the cinema to confirm whether the film was actually being screened. It was not. I asked one of the staff members for the reason for it being removed and they said it had ‚Äúdone its rounds‚Äù at that location. A typical film can stay in theatres for up to six weeks so I find it hard to believe that a film had run its course in just under one week. I followed up by asking if the protests had anything to do with it and they ‚Äòcould not comment‚Äô. Lastly I asked if the police who were present (photo 19) had anything to do with it and they confirmed that there ‚Äúmay be a protest‚Äù. On a different note related to cinemas, it turns out that the Executive Director of the film was present at the screening I attended. My mother and I noticed that he stood out because he was in a suit and socialised with some attendees, but I didn‚Äôt recognise him until now after having seen several of his recent interviews. He has been participating in News interviews and debates (the relevant portion in the linked video begins from the 23:12 timestamp) supporting the right of the UK public to watch this film. Since this film has been released in the UK, it quickly became a talking point across the country and was one of the trending topics on the internet (photo 10 & 11). The main point of discussion is surrounding freedom of speech as many non-Muslims have been saying that the actions of those getting a film banned (photo 14) because it offends them infringes on the rights of those who do wish to watch it (photo 15). Within a few days we went from people not being able to see the film because it was removed as a result of protests; to it being sold out in the remaining cinemas screening it (photo 16), and now it looks like the film is fully banned. After reading my blogpost a Sunni friend of mine wanted to watch the film with me, except I cannot find any available listings. Just this morning a friend of a friend went to watch the film in one of its remaining locations and hours later when I tried to plan a trip for my friends, I found that there were no viewings available (photo 17). It‚Äôs possible that no viewings were showing up as it was sold out, however it is far more likely that they were also removed due to protests. If it becomes possible then I will try to take them to watch the film. Let‚Äôs end this segment with some positivity. In Ramadhan I led an initiative to promote UK based Shia businesses on my social media through Instagram Guides. I‚Äôve grown fed up of only hearing of Shias when they have been killed and wanted to use my small platform to uplift a minority group. If you would like to show your support then take a browse through the various businesses I have showcased thus far and feel free to submit recommendations.]\n\nIf you were unaware or couldn‚Äôt tell by now, yes I am Shia (or trying to be because its an honour I don‚Äôt really deserve). You might be thinking its easy for me to say what I just said because of where I‚Äôm positioned in this situation. So lets switch the story. Let‚Äôs say that a film on the same topic was made by a Sunni production team (which, anyone is welcome to go ahead and do by the way) and it portrayed scenes that are at odds with my beliefs. What would I do? Well, I certainly wouldn‚Äôt make egregious statements describing the contents of the film before I have even seen it myself. I even refrained from commenting on this film until I saw it for myself as well so thats so I‚Äôd say thats standard procedure. After watching the film I probably would share my thoughts in personal or public circles, but would I viciously attack people who agree with the film with my words and actions? No. That goes against the ProphetÔ∑∫‚Äôs sunnah. As much as I might feel discomfort at watching a portrayal of things that contrast my personal beliefs in a film; I‚Äôm sure I would appreciate seeing a visual summary of events from the other side so I can better understand Sunni hadith. I invite Sunni Muslims to watch this film and take it as a starting point into understanding another view of history. You might learn something valuable in the process.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. I have said this before but please watch the film for yourself and form your own judgements, or take it as a chance to learn something new. This post is not an invitation to debate with me on politics/history/religion so respect both of our time and avoid trying.\n\nIf you want to watch a film without getting harassed, good luck ‰∏ñÁïå„ÄÇ\n\nÊ≠§Ëá¥Êï¨Á§ºÔºåÊ¨£Â¶ç ‚Äì From Nabeela.\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/nabblo\n\nŸÑÿß ÿ•ŸÑŸá ÿ•ŸÑÿß ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ±ÿ≥ŸàŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿπŸÑŸä ŸàŸÑŸä ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ŸàÿÆŸÑŸäŸÅÿ© ÿ±ÿ≥ŸàŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá\n\nUpdate: If you would prefer to access this post through audio, I have just uploaded a reading (with some commentary) on my podcast ‚û°Ô∏è https://bit.ly/3sxOLjF\n\nHello dear reader! It‚Äôs been a while (like 5 months oops) and as I may have said in the past, theres been loads I wanted to write about but it can be overwhelming when I have to plan out my thought process on heavy topics. I‚Äôm not one to force myself to do something at the detriment of my mental health, but I have been discussing some of these ‚Äòheavy‚Äô topics across my socials. If you have missed me (üòâ), I‚Äôve been pretty active on my Instagram and post regularly on my YouTube channel!~\n\nAs I explained in a previous post, the ‚Äòhijab‚Äô is a spiritual concept; whereas the headscarf is the physical covering a Muslim woman wears on her head. The hijab applies to all genders but for ease of understanding, I‚Äôll use the term hijab in place of headscarf seeing as though that‚Äôs how this story has been covered.\n\nIn March the French Senate passed an amendment to ban girls from wearing the hijab in public if they‚Äôre under the age of 18. The bill would also prevent mothers in hijab from participating in school trips; officially ban the burqini (a full body swim suit) in public swimming pools, and another amendment even proposes to ban hijabs in televised sports.\n\nWhen the news first broke I posted a short caption to my Instagram story, which was almost immediately removed without any warning or explanation. What‚Äôs more, the same thing happened to my friend Ibzmo. All I had said in my caption was that Islamophobia in France is nothing new, along with a short personal anecdote. It made me wonder, what happened to freedom of speech? In response to this strange occurrence I expanded on my point in an Instagram post. I will share the photo and caption below.\n\n*About a week ago* I shared a post about France to my story and wrote that the #Islamophobia in #France is nothing new. This got taken down without any clarification, and it alarms me to see that this happened to someone else too. Since then I disengaged with the topic completely, but I now reminded myself that that‚Äôs not me and I‚Äôll speak if I want to.\n\nThe first time I went to France was with my dad when I was aged 10. My parents worried that I might be treated badly for wearing a headscarf and so I didn‚Äôt wear it for my trip. When I shared this anecdote on my story, someone asked why I was even wearing it at a young age. Simple; because I chose to. Sure I was younger, but it was a choice then and it‚Äôs a choice now. The current situation in France is a continuation of the movement to suppress the right to choose. ALL women should have the right to choose how they dress. I CHOSE to wear a headscarf from a young age. I remember constantly asking my mum if I was allowed to wear my scarf when I was little and when she eventually said yes, I felt happy. Each Muslim has their own relationship with hijab and as time goes by this continues to develop for me. Yes I chose to wear a scarf when I was little, but I came to truly appreciate it when I turned Shia and learned more about it‚Äôs value. For instance, I heard of how Bibi Zainab s.a was humiliated when her scarf was taken from her and she was paraded through the streets without it. It emphasised the fact that this cloth; this flag; this crown, it can‚Äôt be taken lightly. If Bibi Zainab s.a was so distraught that her scarf was taken from her, how could I take mine for granted? 1400 years later and this same scarf is being taken away from women who feel empowered to wear it. It‚Äôs not okay.\n\nNot long after posting this, a friend I met from a creative programme forwarded a photography opportunity to me. I then participated in a photography project to amplify Muslim voices and share thoughts on the situation in France. The shoot was organised by Noor, a Muslim photographer from London who has been sharing the photographs along with a caption by the subject of the shot. The photo at the start of this post is one that she had taken of me and I will share some more below. You can find clearer versions of these photos in my latest instagram upload paired with this post.\n\nMy caption for her project is as follows: ‚ÄúThe situation in France is a farce. It‚Äôs hypocritical, but unfortunately not surprising. Why is it that a woman will be penalised for choosing to wear a headscarf as a religious piece of clothing; yet another woman can wear the same headscarf in the name of fashion with no problems? Muslim women are not being relieved from oppression (as if to say that is the true intention behind this), rather this bill enforces oppression by removing the right to choose how women dress. To the onlookers who may not recognise the gravity of the situation, just consider the ripple effects of this proposed legislation. France has a rich history of Islamophobia and if the government passes this bill it will only embolden more right wing people to openly carry out out their Islamophobic abuse and hate crimes.‚Äù\n\nFunnily enough, as soon as I sent over my caption for Noor‚Äôs project, a different friend told me my first post had inspired her to speak on the issue and invited me to take part in a different project. So the chances are, this will not be end of my public involvement in this dialogue. I‚Äôm humbled, but more than that I hope this makes an impact. What are we raising awareness for? I heard people say that in this day and age we‚Äôre well past the ‚Äòawareness‚Äô phase of social issues. It‚Äôs mostly true. In a lot of cases people choose to stay ignorant on issues, because it‚Äôs so easy to find information in the age of the internet. Instead, I hope that part of the impact of the trending #handsoffmyhijab tag is that posts such as these will reach Muslims in France (and other places in the world where its difficult to wear the hijab) and help them to feel less alone. I saw a Tiktok video in which a 17 year old Muslim in France partially removed her hijab on camera and instead put on the hood from her hoody. Do you see how that makes no sense? This was her coping strategy to maintain some form of physical hijab; but if she had kept on her scarf, that cloth would have caused an issue. I hope this conversation continues and does not end with France.\n\nAgain when it comes to coincidence of timing, the day that I took part in Noor‚Äôs shoot, I also received the completed piece for an International Women‚Äôs Day project I participated in. The ‚ÄòCelebrate Women‚Äô initiative is run by an Asian American who wanted to share diverse stories of women empowerment. For this project I did a self portrait and by chance decided to focus on the hijab for my accompanying caption. If you want to browse the full project and see other women who were involved as well as my own photo, you can view it here. See below for two images I did not submit to be used for the initiative and find my final photo on the site (note that my skin tone came out quite orange after the colours were touched up for the album). My caption can also be found below.\n\nI have always been a Creative by nature. I thrive when making things; taking something from one form and turning it into something else. Part of this shines through in the way that I dress, as my love for art is often reflected in my outfits. As a Muslim woman, I have dealt with comments where people have commended me for my bright outfits because it strays from the ‚Äònorm‚Äô of how a Muslim woman should dress. I‚Äôm here to say that people should never dictate any woman‚Äôs choice of clothing or expression. There is no standard ‚ÄòMuslim style‚Äô. Black or pink or any other colour are fine. I‚Äôm bold, I‚Äôm bright, and I‚Äôm not changing for anyone but myself.\n\nAs you can see, the timing at which I received the final ver seemed ironic because what I spoke about weeks prior in preparation for International Women‚Äôs Day also tied into the current conversation regarding France. All women should be given the freedom to choose how they wish to dress. Speaking of how Muslims are perceived though, the norm for any group of people is largely determined by the media that we consume. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if Muslims could be cast in more mainstream media projects? Oh and it would be superb if the narratives of those projects steer away from the characters‚Äô overt ‚ÄòMuslimness‚Äô; feeling at odds with their religion and cultural values; something to do with terrorism? How about a non-cringey show which champions minority people for just being people without exasperating their stereotypes and tired tropes? Perhaps this is a post for another day but before I close this thought for now, let me share something that may either make you chuckle or reflect, perhaps depending on where you sit.\n\nNot too long ago I attended an online talk by a man who works in VFX (visual effects used in video production). He began by sharing a group photo of his company and from my small phone screen I wasn‚Äôt sure if all I saw really was a sea of white. Later on he shared some video reels of projects he had worked on. One video had black actors and the background music had a loud refrain of ‚Äúmelanin‚Äù. I raised a question in the chat box asking how many people of colour worked for the company as the videos sparked my curiosity. My question was missed amidst the presentation so I asked it orally at the end. I commended the man on his achievements (he gave an overview of his resume at the start) and indeed for the reels. I then asked how diverse the company was as I noticed some of the casting choices and use of language in the materials shown, and that I see great strength in allowing people of colour to craft their own stories by putting them in positions of power. It was then that the man began to fumble. It was sad but somewhat amusing to watch how a white man could not give me a straight answer to a simple question on ‚Äòdiversity‚Äô. He couldn‚Äôt even tell me whether they had a brown person in the team to fill a quota. What he did eventually say though was that its a notoriously difficult industry for representation and he thinks thats terrible. -And also that he‚Äôs part of a diversity scheme. I was impressed at least by his honesty and read into the scheme in my own time. I then emailed him to find out more about it directly and sent my CV for any casual opportunities. Although VFX isn‚Äôt my main field of interest, he had mentioned that he‚Äôs keen to hear from people and all applications go straight to him. As you may have guessed, I still have not heard back.\n\nTo bring things back to the topic at hand I want to end on a recent post by Jada Pinkett Smith. In the two selfies linked in her name, Jada is seen posing in a light peach (looks cream to me) hijab. The post‚Äôs caption is ‚ÄúI really think the color peach in the Middle East ‚Ä¶ suits me‚ú®‚Äù. I saw a different photo of her in another hijab before seeing this Instagram post. I had just explained the France bill to a non Muslim friend and a day or so later he tagged me in Jada‚Äôs new Facebook upload. Let me share a screenshot of how the tag looked and the upload itself before I explain why I‚Äôm bringing this up.\n\nThe reason I‚Äôm critical of her in this instance is because she has a large and thriving platform where she discusses contemporary social issues. That is to say, she is socially and politically aware and makes efforts to share thoughts on pressing topics. But in this case these photos came across as tone deaf, to me personally and at least to another friend I saw speak on this. I feel that she really missed the chance to do something with her platform as it could have been a powerful statement of solidarity for her to have worn the hijab under the backdrop of such global tension. She wore it like an accessory and all she had to say was that she looked good in the colour peach. With her influence she could have worn it as a symbol to speak about the situation in France. Of course we have to respect her choice to not speak on this and focus on her ‚Äònon glamor glory‚Äô. The thing is I wouldn‚Äôt normally bash posts like this, but for someone who makes the effort to get entangled in important social issues, it seems privileged and inconsiderate to wear the hijab so casually and choose to make vanity the focus given the current climate.\n\nAs I said initially, the Islamophobia in France is nothing new. In 2011 France banned the niqab (face covering) and burqa (long dress). What‚Äôs strange is that a Muslim woman in France who chooses to wear a niqab will be met with a fine, but will also receive a fine if she does not wear a face mask due to Covid-19 protocols. A mask and niqab essentially cover the same portion of ones face. A few years later in 2016, several beaches in France banned the burqini from public beaches. I remember there was minor uproar from my personal circles when I spoke about the news back then. ‚ÄúA women should have the right to choose how she dresses‚Äù. I agree. So where are my fellow feminists now? I implore you to speak on issues such as this even if they do not affect you personally. If the fact that we‚Äôre discussing a piece of cloth is too much, I get it. But think of the violence this could allow. In the same way that the then President Trump called Covid-19 the ‚ÄòChina Virus‚Äô which caused mass violence and discrimination to East and South East Asians across the globe; the French government merely suggesting such an Islamophobic bill certainly paves the way for another rise of unnecessary violence towards Muslims, across the globe.\n\nThe bill in France is not anti-separatist, its Islamophobic.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a Muslim woman who chooses to wear the headscarf, good luck ‰∏ñÁïå„ÄÇ\n\nÊ≠§Ëá¥Êï¨Á§ºÔºåÊ¨£Â¶ç ‚Äì From Nabeela.\n\nFollow me on my other socials https://linktr.ee/nabblo üíñ\n\nLet‚Äôs begin this post with a positive thought for Aya Hachem, please recite a Surah Fatiha if you can.\n\n[Tw: Death, shooting.] A short summary: Aya Hachem was a 19 yr old Lebanese Muslim woman who was recently shot in Blackburn, UK (17th May 2020). She was on her way to Lidl (a chain supermarket) to buy groceries for her family when someone drove by and shot her. Following her death, and in the spirit of the holy month of Ramadhan in which zakat (charity) is encouraged, Muslims online launched fundraisers to build Mosques and wells in Aya‚Äôs name. A few days later it was made public that Aya was a Shia Muslim which caused a large number of Sunni Muslims online to denounce and retract the fundraisers for Aya due to her being Shia.\n\nI intend to write this post to inform you of the news concerning the death of Aya Hachem and hopefully not stretch too far beyond that. The details have been confusing to follow and so I hope to share all the relevant details for you on one page. The incidents that have transpired over the past few days have deeply upset me. It took me two days to try and write this because I found it so sad, particularly as a Shia Muslim. There is one point however that I‚Äôd like to begin with. Aya died at what Muslim‚Äôs would believe is one the holiest times of the year, Ramadhan. Not to mention it was two days after the death anniversary of Imam Ali (a.s) and around the date of Laylat al-Qadr. I want to try my best to preserve the sanctity of her death, given the religious significance of its timing. One day I shall try to share more about my personal reflections on the treatment of Shias; however for now I urge that we stick to the facts and the story when speaking of Aya, and out of respect try not to use her death as a point of political discussion.\n\nThe story:\n\nAya was a second year student at the University of Salford, and Vice-president of its law society. Her dream was to work in international law and she was also a young trustee for the Children‚Äôs Society. She and her family came to Britain approx 10 years ago to flee from conflict in Lebanon. As mentioned above, she was shot whilst on her way to the supermarket. The BBC has reported that ‚Äòeight people have been arrested on suspicion of murder while a further three suspects have been held on suspicion of assisting an offender. The suspects, who are aged 19 to 39, remain in police custody.‚Äô\n\nThe story has been lacking in mainstream media coverage, but as news had passed around (through social media channels at least), some people started fundraisers in Aya‚Äôs name for various charitable causes, such as building mosques, and wells. A few days later when it was revealed and spread that Aya was a Shia Muslim, many Sunni donors sought to withdraw their donations and remove their fundraisers. One social media account on Twitter (who I will avoid referring to directly as I do not plan to give them free advertisement) openly declared that they would be taking down a fundraiser they had started as they ‚Äúdid not know she was Shia‚Äù, and would offer refunds to the donors. This account seems to be what caused the issue to become part of wider public knowledge as it sparked outrage and debate from mostly Shia online users. I‚Äôll note that at present with the story getting more recognition online, there are of course a number of Sunni Muslims who are condemning the acts of the other groups.\n\nIt was only when I saw a Shia friend of mine share a screenshot of this person‚Äôs initial Tweets (in which they said they would be taking down the fundraiser due to finding out Aya was Shia) onto her Instagram story that I found out Aya was Shia. Did it matter that Aya was Shia? No. A person was shot, that‚Äôs really all that matters. Before then sharing it onto my own story, I did some research and found the Twitter account of the person in question. I observed that they were under a lot of pressure and vented that ‚ÄúShias and feminists‚Äù were coming for them and sharing screenshots of their Tweets ‚Äúfor clout‚Äú. It appeared that within a matter of hours they had put the fundraiser back up and also deleted their first Tweets. The following day I read an article in which an apology by this person was shared. If you want to read it for yourself, click here. I will refrain on commenting on the apology as I think it‚Äôs between Allah, the person and Aya‚Äôs family.\n\nOther thoughts:\n\nI can say with some certainty that if you don‚Äôt have at least one Shia person in your social circle, you probably wouldn‚Äôt have heard about Aya‚Äôs fundraisers being taken down when it had occurred two days ago. With each passing day I have become more patient and less anxious about this story. As I observe how things have been spreading on social media, it was only today that I saw several non-Shia Muslims whom I follow online share details of this case. I found it somewhat annoying in the past when people would express their anger for the lack of solidarity for a certain cause/people, as other issues pertaining to ‚Äòmore privileged‚Äô groups received far greater support only a short while prior. It was annoying because of all the noise, yet valid and true. Even though I have supported and related to a lot of the causes I thought about when writing the last two lines, I now have truly felt what it means to experience that lack of solidarity. It really shouldn‚Äôt be so easy to think of examples of recent atrocities, but lets just think about Arbery, or even Sudan. Where did all the noise go since then? What happened to the solidarity?\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the shooting was a racially motivated attack, (indeed the detectives working on the case are also of this thinking) and I doubt the killer(s) knew Aya was Shia. That is not what this post is implying at all. It is the case however that once her Shia background was revealed after her death, people took to online platforms to attack her and other Shias, and those who defend Shias.\n\nOne online user had this to say in response to the person receiving backlashing for retracting their fundraiser: ‚ÄúHey bro you have nothing to worry about. If she was a Shi‚Äôa, she deserves to het shot. Shi‚Äôa are not Muslim, they are enemies of Islam‚Ä¶‚Äù. This sentiment was not limited to this user but was in fact shared by many others who chose to publicly raise their disturbing views. Is it not ISIS mentality? The majority of ISIS victims are Shia Muslims by the way. This story is highlighting the very unfortunate state we are in. It‚Äôs so unfair that Shia people receive these levels of hate, but for the sake of this post I can‚Äôt say more than that.\n\nWhat really perplexes me is that its Ramadhan. By now I‚Äôm sure you know what it is or understand its significance for Muslims. For the Muslim readers especially, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard all the mighty talk of the tenets of a pious person whilst growing up. So of all the times of the year, why would those people choose now as the time to expose their hatred for Shia‚Äôs in this way. Where did the sunnah go? What happened to akhlaq? Yesterday I even saw someone share that violent and aggressive anti-Ahmediyya (another Muslim sect) hashtags have been trending on Twitter all the while it has been Ramdhan. I can‚Äôt speak further on this as it‚Äôs not something that I have researched myself as I do not wish to see those violent threads, but having supremacy over other sects surely is not in line with the teachings of the Prophet.\n\nOnly a week ago, a maternity ward in Afghanistan was under attack and amongst the deaths and casualties, babies that had only been alive for a few hours were killed. Again, people found out that the victims were Shia (they were targeted in a Shia district) a few days after the initial news had spread. To my knowledge this did not cause hate, but it felt like some people had lost interest in the story once this fact was revealed. Moreover few people chose to highlight that the victims were Shia once it was revealed. In this case as well, it‚Äôs not important that the victims were Shia. They were innocent people that were brutally killed. However in adding on the fact that they were Shia, we are able to highlight the injustices that Shia minorities do face. On a lighter note, since that attack many mothers have been offering to breastfeed and adopt the babies who were made motherless.\n\n*A message from Aya‚Äôs father, Ismail Hachem:\n\nAl Fatiha. ‚ÄúIndeed we belong to God, and unto God is our ultimate return. With great sorrow and heavy hearts, we present our lamentations to the Master of Our Time, Imam Mahdi (atfs), and to the Prophet of Islam, the Prophet of Mercy and Peace, Mohammed (pbuh) and His Progeny. My precious and compassionate daughter is sacrificed in your way. She is the martyr of science and knowledge, and being estranged from home. She is the martyr of hope, dreams, and the struggle for success. She is the martyr of fasting the Holy Month of Ramadhan, and yet she died oppressed and wronged. Killed by a hail of bullets fired from the gun of betrayal, exiting with wounds of frustration that bleed from our hearts. My strong daughter. A lawyer in the making. Aya. Ismail. Hachem. May God‚Äôs Mercy enshroud your pure soul. Oh you who broke your fathers back with your untimely departure, you were my every dream, the embodiment of love for knowledge and the pursuit of highest of morals and etiquette. You leave behind a mother who carried and delivered you into this world, patient despite all the difficulties of child birth. A mother so pure, always in the state of remembering The Almighty, always patient in times of difficulty, eternally placing her trust in whatever The Lord writes for us of trials and tribulations in this life. You left behind your elder brother Ibraheem whom you‚Äôve always known to be righteous unto his parents, always compassionate towards his siblings. Your younger sister Aseel misses you dearly, the bright and promising one who followed in your footsteps. And you left behind an infant brother, Amir. Amir whom you showered with your love, compassion and warmth. Oh Allah, give us patience in this difficult time, and give my daughter a place in the companionship of the Righteous ones in the company of Mohammed (pbuh) and His Family. Amen.‚Äù\n\n(*Apologies, I found this in an article online but have lost the original link for crediting)\n\nI wanted to explain the difference between Sunnis and Shias and explore the conversation of, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all Muslim, I wish there were no sects and we could just get along‚Äù, but I want to stick to my commencing intention of straying from ‚Äòpolitics‚Äô etc. If you would like me to discuss these things another time then let me know. In short though, [some] people have and will always antagonise that which they do not understand or find different to themselves. Rather than going about things in this way (i.e. regarding sectarian divide), I hope more people can show that it is possible to peacefully coexist despite having differences.\n\nIf you would like to donate to a fundraiser to build a school in the name of Aya Hachem, please follow this link.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. I would like to end by sharing a nasheed I used to listen to as a child as I think it‚Äôs very relevant to this discussion.

This is a UK and London focused post.\n\n[There will be a handful of links embedded in this post. Click the words in blue font to follow the links if you want to]\n\nBefore we begin, fear not. This post is not intended for scare mongering. I‚Äôve been seeing lists of ‚Äòthings you can do during quarantine/self-isolation‚Äô as a means of getting through the weird Corona Virus times we‚Äôre infected by. From the few lists I took a look at, a lot of the advice is the same. I think this shows that the advice is worth listening to, and so I‚Äôll repeat a few of those, but I also wanted to offer some more tangible(?) things! If you want a chill (fitting) song to listen to as you read, take a listen to Homebody by PH1.\n\n^TLDR: I‚Äôve been seeing lists of how to manage self isolation due to the virus, and whilst they are super helpful, they‚Äôre also quite repetitive and abstract so I wanted to add on some tangible things to the mix!‚ö°Ô∏è\n\nLet‚Äôs begin with a basic overview of how you might want to be spending time! Following the general advice I‚Äôm about to share, I will also list some more helpful resources below. Hopefully altogether you will have something quite comprehensive to follow and help you get through isolation time.\n\nPlease practice social distancing!üôè Listen to the advice of your government. Limit to your social media usage especially if you think it is harmful to mental Health. Try and do some exercise indoors. Take this as an opportunity to deep clean your house or to just de-clutter your space. Be mindful of your news intake and cautious of the validity of sources. Spend time focusing on yourself and understanding what your hobbies are. If you are religious, then this is a good time to pray and connect to your spiritual side. Be kind to yourself and patient to those around you and to the situation.\n\nWhen the isolation period started, I saw a lot going around the Internet where people were urging others to use this time for productivity. Saying this could be the time that ‚Äòyou finally complete orders tasks that you‚Äôd been meaning to tend to‚Äô, etc. I agree that it would be worthwhile to use this time to be productive; however, I think we‚Äôve been given such a great opportunity to recharge that we don‚Äôt need to be productive, all the time at least. So yes, my advice includes doing things that are practical and productive, however I‚Äôm also including self-care tips under productivity because I think its necessary. I think our focus shouldn‚Äôt always be fixated on trying to get things done as it harbours an unhealthy mindset that everything we do needs to have a specific outcome and amazing result. Sometimes we can just exist. Do things for the sake of it. Chill out, you know?~ So please consider all of the below a giant heap of some of the different forms of productivityüôè\n\nSelf Care:\n\nTry to stick to a routine, i.e. sleeping and waking up at a set time and not sleeping in.\n\nIf you find it helpful, get out of your sleepwear and get dressed to spend your day at home/online meetings and classes.\n\nReflect on how your year has been going so far and if there have been any changes in your personal growth since last year. Assess how your New Year‚Äôs resolution has been going if you made one and don‚Äôt be harsh on yourself if you‚Äôre still working towards it.\n\nAllow yourself to feel anxious if that‚Äôs how you feel about the situation.\n\nCassey Ho wrote a short post on her blog about ‚ÄòHow to Glow Up During Self Isolation‚Äô, basically a self care post.\n\nI know I‚Äôve mentioned Rituals before in a less positive light, but they have a calming section of their website you might enjoy browsing!\n\nIf you are working from home/attending classes, try to arrange a calming workspace for yourself.\n\nSet yourself a daily goal.\n\nMeditate.\n\nTalk to someone and reach out for help if the situation is having an adverse effect on your mental health.\n\nFitness:\n\nI‚Äôve been exercising a lot lately and I came across a YouTube channel the other day that posts short exercise routines to popular songs.\n\nChris Hemsworth has released a free 6-week trial for his online fitness programme.\n\nBlogilates (a brand by aforementioned Cassey Ho) is a great website and YouTube channelthat offers fun workout routines for a range of fitness levels. There are also free workout calendars and other fitness related thingson the website.\n\nFinance:\n\nAdvice from HSBC bank\n\nAdvice from Monzo bank\n\nMoney Advice Service\n\nTheres a Coronavirus Small Business Helpline, but the line seems to always be busy. Try your luck if you wish at: 0300 456 3565.\n\nYou can claim a refund on your TFL (Transport for London) season tickets! I‚Äôve gone and found the link for you, just check if it applies to the ticket you hold.\n\nHelping the Community:\n\nIf you wants to volunteer in some capacity to aid the NHS at the moment, you can register with Goodsam. All you‚Äôll need is an in date DBS certificate\n\nThis isn‚Äôt necessarily for the community, but I found a great site where you can bulk order fruit (which you could choose to distribute afterwards) from restertaunts that are unable to use them.\n\nThe ‚ÄòNextdoor‚Äô website/APP that allows you to connect with your (mostly immediate) community. i.e. By writing posts to share information with people in your neighbourhood.\n\nLook out for your neighbours. If there are elderly folk in your neighbourhood, try to reach out and offer your assistance (whilst maintaining a physical distance).\n\nDonate to local food banks if you are able to.\n\nResearchers are trying to better understand the virus and you can help them if you wish to by providing daily health updates on this app.\n\nMy borough is recruiting volunteers to transport food and talk to lonely people who are isolating over the phone, you can find out if your area is running a similar initiative.\n\nSome ways to pass time:\n\nTry out some of thefree online classes offered by Harvard University.\n\nIf the first point wasn‚Äôt enough, here‚Äôs 450 Ivy League courses you can take online for free.\n\nWatch YouTube videos! It‚Äôs free (like 90% of it) and there‚Äôs a so many genres of videos. Here‚Äôs a video I posted recently üëÄ ‰Ω†ËÆ¢ÈòÖ‰∫Ü‰πàÔºü\n\nRead a book!\n\nAn online page called the Corona Culture Festival 2020 has created a Google Doc has collated a collaborative list of things to do/read/watch etc.\n\nOf course you need to be especially smart with your food resources at the moment, but if you can then consider trying out some new recipes. It‚Äôs been really satisfying to see some people post step by step cooking photos on their Instagram stories (‚Ä¶and then never actually following themüòÖü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). I‚Äôm thinking of baking a cake for my birthday next week!üéÇü•≥\n\nLearn a new skill, or practice an old one. There‚Äôs a ton of resources out there on the Internet! You could try learning sign language for example.\n\nI‚Äôve been enjoying the Tonight Show Home Edition videos from time to time. They‚Äôre kind of endearing and I love for the dad jokes lol.\n\nOrganise your wardrobe/phone gallery/internet tabs/laptop desktop/email inbox etc.\n\nOpen your window!~\n\nBond with your family (if you‚Äôre isolating with them or through phone calls).\n\nGo through the videos/posts you ‚Äòsaved for later‚Äô (e.g. on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook).\n\nMemes/Photos:\n\nMy latest YouTube video is a vlog as I go on a short trip to the Pharmacy to pick up my mum‚Äôs medication.I did this to be part of digital historyüëÄü•≥Take a look if you want to pass more time or if you want to see how things are in the UK right now!~\n\nHave you ever wondered what a random person in the world may be doing? Have you ever stopped to think that someone out there is going about their day at the same time as you but neither of you have a clue of each others existence? As I typed that out it seemed like some old philosopher probably did think about it and wrote about it in a book somewhere, but I have thought about these things before. I just think its so cool that so much of the world is basically doing the same thing right now, even if it isn‚Äôt under the best circumstances. Even though everyone‚Äôs doing different things, a lot of us are connected right now, so many people in the world are literally stuck at home at the same time as you and me!! Separately we are still united in our isolation. Isn‚Äôt it crazy.\n\nThe chances are that if you‚Äôre reading this you‚Äôre in the privilege position of having at least the basic amenities of 21st-century life. You can quite literally kick your feet up and relax. And there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. But if you do think there is something wrong with that, well it‚Äôs not completely your fault. We are the product of a capitalist society of which the metric systemÔøºÔøº is based almost entirely on our outward utilityÔøº. Our worth is calculated by our productivity. For our whole lives we have been told to produce, to work, to exert our energies into building and maintaining the market. It has not been ingrained in our nature to rest. So now that we have this opportunity, of course some more privileged than othersÔøº, I hope you‚Äôll take some time to restÔøº. Another word for this of course is self-care. Self-care may be a keyword you‚Äôve seen spring around the Internet a lot these days, but what does that actually entail? You probably figured it out through the list I wrote above, but in short, it involves you looking after your mental and physical well-being in whatever shape or form that may be productive to you. For example, for some self-care may be having a bath, reading a book, singing, meditating, playing a game you‚Äôve been waiting to play. It can look like many thingsÔøº, so I hope you take this precious opportunity to explore itÔøº.\n\nI didnt want this to be a downer of a post but I am thinking of those who are anxious over this situation. Students are facing all kinds of uncertainties and many people are facing intricate problems. Reach out to people lend a hand where you can. Try to spare a thought for those who may be suffering without help because of this situation. Homeless people, those with low incomes, people with small businesses, freelancers, victims of abuse, young parents, people who are lonely. There are places that you can donate money and food to those who may benefit, research what‚Äôs available in your area. There are also Facebook/WhatsApp support groups whereby you can plan to help people in your local neighbourhood. Search for ‚ÄòCovid-19 Mutual Support Group‚Äô on Facebook and join a group based on your location.\n\nBtw the title was inspired by an old song I like, you can listen to it here üëÄ Also it looks like my birthday will also be during isolation (1st April). I didn‚Äôt have much in mind for celebrating this year but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm pleased by this turn of events. I‚Äôm now thinking of filming a new birthday themed cooking video instead, so subscribe to my YouTube channel if you want to see that mess when it comes outüòÇ I did capture cute moments from my birthday last year if you want to see that~\n\nAll in all I‚Äôd like to say that I believe this uneasy moment we‚Äôre going through will pass. People are finding this difficult for different reasons; some of us may have compromised immune systems or worry for loved ones who are suffering from the virus, others may be feeling anxious by the news or are finding that this situation is triggering their mental health issues. In this moment (similar to what I said earlier about the fact that so much of the world is isolating at the same time) I‚Äôm not too anxious over the current situation, I‚Äôd say its actually been improving my mental health slightly but I won‚Äôt go into the reasoning. I recognise that I‚Äôm in a privileged position to be able to say that I‚Äôm doing somewhat okay, but I hope you‚Äôll be okay too. This will be over soon and I look forward to seeing you on the other side~ üíú\n\nIf you try to share tips to help ease self-isolation, good luck ‰∏ñÁïå„ÄÇ\n\nÊ≠§Ëá¥Êï¨Á§ºÔºåÊ¨£Â¶ç ‚Äì From Nabeela. ‚ù§\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/GoodLuckNabs1\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/nabblo/\n\nINSüì∑: https://www.instagram.com/nabblo/"
