        "text": "GIVE YOU A SLICE OF HEAVEN WITH A POWERFUL LIVE VIDEO PERFORMANCE\n\nFor the first time in 10 years Atlanta vocalists Anthony David and Algebra Blessett reunite on record for a spine-tingling, uplifting & emotional reinterpretation of the huge BeBe & CeCe Winans Eighties hit “Heaven”.\n\nAnd now they celebrate the release with a powerful live video performance of the song\n\nfilmed at Atlanta’s Rock Steady lounge and directed by Kola Adetola. The featured musicians are Tavis Simmons on keys and Landon Jordan on guitar.\n\nBack in 2011 the two singers combined on “4 Evermore”, the biggest song that either of them have enjoyed in their careers – and also now a very popular wedding song in the US – which went Top 20 on the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart and reached #2 on the Billboard Adult R&B Airplay chart.\n\nAnthony David, Algebra Blessett – Heaven\n\nSays Anthony: “Algebra and I really enjoy working together, both on stage and in the studio. With us both living in Atlanta our paths are always crossing. We chose this song for our first duet in a long while because it’s a feel good classic we grew up on. I like songs that give a transcendent feeling. When deciding on the arrangement and production style, producer Eddie Stokes and I were looking to strip it down and still retain the deep emotion”.\n\nThe duo are now combining for more live dates, with upcoming performances in Philadelphia, Atlanta and Bethesda, MD.\n\nAnthony was born in Georgia and saw military service in the first Gulf War. Returning to the US, he moved from Savannah to Atlanta and began making his way in the music business. His first friend in the city was the then unknown India Arie, and he went on to co-write “Part Of My Life” for her hit debut album “Acoustic Soul”, also opening up for her on some of her early shows. After signing his own record deal in 2006 he duetted with India on “Words”, which became his first song to enter the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart. In addition to “4 Evermore”, he also teamed with Algebra on a second occasion with the song “Official” from his album “Love Out Loud”.\n\nAlgebra Blessett grew up in Atlanta wanting to be a dancer, but soon switched to take up singing. Her mother was a gospel singer and bass player so it was a natural career choice. She made her recording debut on ex-Motown president Kedar Massenburg’s label with an album “Purpose” which spent 14 weeks on the chart. In 2012 she sang with Esperanza Spalding on “Black Gold”, which she also co-wrote, from Spalding’s Grammy-winning album “Radio Music Society”, and she also sang alongside Anthony Hamilton on hip-hop violinist Miri Ben-Ari’s “She Was Just A Friend”."
