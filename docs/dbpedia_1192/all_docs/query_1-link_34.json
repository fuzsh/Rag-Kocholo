I changed so much after travelling, opened my mind, changed my character. You should live like the birds, I live like a traveller\n\nI was sitting on my own\n\nIn my beautiful home\n\nLots of people all around but I felt so alone\n\nI thought I had everything\n\nAll the dreams that I had dreamed\n\nBut the cleansing of a heart and soul\n\nDon’t come with material things\n\nSo I went to Istanbul\n\nTo the hammam of the sultan\n\nThe purest water they brought in\n\nTo wash away my sins\n\nBut before the clay had dried\n\nMy guilt had multiplied\n\nAnd despite how hard they tried\n\nI felt worse than when I walked in\n\nOh my Lord I need Salvation\n\nJust a piece of peace and a bit of happiness\n\nMy minds going crazy and I feel so lost\n\nCos I can’t get through to you\n\nSo I flew to Dubai\n\nEverything that money can buy\n\nBut faith ain’t such a fickle thing\n\nThat glitters like gold outside\n\nSo I went to the USA\n\nThey say the land of the free and the brave\n\nBut freedom don’t mean anything\n\nWhen your heart ain’t free within\n\nOh my Lord I need Salvation\n\nJust a piece of peace and a bit of happiness\n\nMy minds going crazy and I feel so lost\n\nCos I can’t get through to you\n\nI thought maybe Asia\n\nTo beautiful Malaysia\n\nThe people there were oh so nice\n\nI thought maybe I could stay here\n\nBut I needed some rest\n\nSo I went to Budapest\n\nI ate and ate cos I was hungry\n\nBut my soul was still restless\n\nOh my Lord I need Salvation\n\nJust a piece of peace and a bit of happiness\n\nMy minds going crazy and I feel so lost\n\nCos I can’t get through to you\n\nI thought I’d go back to my roots\n\nPut on those village boots\n\nTo a small town deep in India\n\nWhere my great grandparents stood\n\nI looked for someone I knew\n\nSomething for me to do\n\nThey said you look familiar son\n\nBut there’s nothing here for you\n\nOh my Lord I need Salvation\n\nJust a piece of peace and a bit of happiness\n\nMy minds going crazy and I feel so lost\n\nCos I can’t get through to You\n\nFrom London to Egypt Cairo, got my weapon everywhere that I go\n\nWas a gun that could take away life, now it’s on my tongue, this Quran I recite\n\nI had breakfast in Casablanca, now I’m back on this road again\n\nlike a journeyman, on this horse I ride, until the day my journey ends\n\nI’m just a traveller, traveller, traveller on these lands\n\nAllah blessed me in so many ways, none of this was ever in my plans\n\nCos I was a young boy, young boy, walking a lonely road\n\nfrom street to street, they say my life is my journey home\n\nOh my Lord I found Salvation\n\nA piece of peace and so much happiness\n\nMy mind was crazy and I felt so lost\n\nBut now I’m close to you\n\nSo back to my homeland\n\nBack to where it all began\n\nSame old faces and same old places\n\nBut I felt a change at hand\n\nFrom Panama to Japan\n\nNew Zealand to Vietnam\n\nHe’s closer than your own jugular vein\n\nJust call out Allah’s name\n\nWhere do you go to find God\n\nIt actually ain’t that hard\n\nHe’s always with you, wherever you are\n\nJust remember Him in your heart\n\nOh my Lord I found Salvation\n\nA piece of peace and so much happiness\n\nMy mind was crazy and I felt so lost\n\nBut now i’m close to you\n\nTrinkets and clothes and gold treasure troves\n\nThey don’t mean nothing if your heart stays closed\n\nOnly remembering brings you close, to Him\n\nRemember\n\nTrinkets and clothes and gold treasure troves\n\nThey don’t mean nothing if your heart stays closed\n\nOnly remembering brings you close, to Him\n\nTrinkets and clothes and gold treasure troves\n\nThey don’t mean nothing if your heart stays closed\n\nOnly remembering brings you close, to Him\n\nBrings you close to Him\n\nIn the Name of the Most Merciful\n\nfor Whom these words are said,\n\nWe recount the noble Seerah\n\nof His Prophet Muhammad\n\nIt had been six hundred years since the earth had seen\n\na guide,\n\nFrom the time of the Messiah, who had not been crucified.\n\nBut before he was raised up, to Bani Israil, he said,\n\n{After me will come a Messenger, whose name will\n\nbe Ahmad.}\n\nIn the centuries that followed, humankind had gone astray,\n\nFrom the message of the prophets, and the pure and\n\nnatural Way.\n\nThey had turned to man-made idols out of ignorance\n\nand pride,\n\nTaking gods besides Allah, so that His Oneness was denied.\n\nAll the weak ones were oppressed and many wrongs were\n\nseen as right;\n\nIn the darkness mankind wandered till Allah would send\n\nHis light.\n\nOn a bless-ed day in springtime, in the year called\n\n‘Aam al-Fil,\n\nIn the desert town of Makkah was to come the Final Seal.\n\nAbdullah, the Prophet’s father, never lived to see his son;\n\nAminah was honored by Allah to bear the chosen one.\n\nPraised in Heaven and on Earth, he graced the world that\n\nMonday morn;\n\nAllah’s mercy filled the universe when Muhammad was\n\nBorn\n\nHe was son of ‘Abdullah, who was ‘Abdul Muttalib’s son,\n\nSon of Hashim, then ‘Abdu Manaf, the brave and handsome\n\none;\n\nThen Qusay, and then Kilab, then Murrah, then Ka’b,\n\nthen Lu’ay,\n\nSon of Ghalib, son of Fi-hr, or Quraysh, as they would say.\n\nTo ‘Adnan, the father of the Arabs, trace his family tree,\n\nFor it leads to Ibrahim, through ‘Isma’il, his progeny.\n\nSo his light was passed from noble loins through wombs so\n\nchaste and pure;\n\nOnce it came into the world, it would abide forevermore\n\nAs an infant, he was suckled by Halima after birth,\n\nTurned away by other wet-nurses who did not know\n\nhis worth.\n\nThough the Best of God's Creation seemed in front of\n\nthem, helpless,\n\nStill a day would come when they would turn to him in\n\ntheir duress.\n\nAngels bathed his heart in Zamzam and replaced it\n\nin his chest;\n\nThose around him knew this bless-ed child was different from\n\nthe rest.\n\nRaised by uncle Abu Talib after both his parents died,\n\nThough an orphan in his early years, Allah was by his side.\n\nHe protected him and saved him from the evil and obscene;\n\nSo trustworthy was he known to be, they called him al-\n\nAmeen.\n\nClouds would race to shade him and the trees would bow\n\ndown in respect;\n\nThose bestowed with sacred insight knew that he was\n\nthe Elect.\n\nAs the prayer of Prophet Abraham and Jesus’s good news,\n\nHe was mentioned in the scriptures of the Christians and\n\nthe Jews.\n\nHe was noblest in his lineage, in virtue, without peers;\n\nHe was loved among his people till the age of forty years.\n\nWhile the people worshipped many gods, he knew Allah\n\nwas One;\n\nIn a cave, he would pray to Allah, not seen by anyone.\n\nTill one night, there came upon him revelation from Allah;\n\nJibra-il appeared before him as his heart was filled\n\nwith awe.\n\nThen enveloped by the angel, he was squeezed; for breath,\n\nhe fought.\n\nWhen the angel said,\"Recite!\"; all he replied was,\n\n\"I cannot!\"\n\nOn the third time he was squeezed, he asked, \"What shall I\n\nthen recite?!\"\n\nAnd Allah’s eternal Words came down, revealed to man that\n\nnight.\n\nAs the Prophet left the cave distressed, for home he\n\nmade a start.\n\nThere, he found his wife Khadijah; her support consoled his\n\nheart.\n\nJibra-il would come to him with revelation, crystal clear:\n\nAs Allah's beloved Messenger, he had nothing to fear.\n\nSo, first quietly, then openly, the Prophet made his call,\n\nThat the people leave their pagan ways and witness one and\n\nall:\n\nThat there’s no god but Allah, and by His will alone I speak;\n\nHe alone is whom we worship, and from Him all aid we seek!\n\nHe would call the people to Allah, and day and night implore:\n\n{If you love Allah, then follow me; He’ll love you\n\neven more…!}\n\nOnce, the pagans threw some waste on him as he bowed\n\ndown in prayer;\n\nThey were laughing while his daughter cried, but he did not\n\ndespair.\n\nFor Allah is with those people who put all their trust\n\nin Him;\n\nAnd the Lord was with his Prophet, peace and blessings\n\nbe on him.\n\nOne by one, the hearts began to turn towards the\n\nguiding light,\n\nAs Islam rescued the downtrodden and gave to them\n\ntheir right.\n\nThough Bilal was tortured in the sun, Sumayyah put to death,\n\nStill, they held tight to their faith and they would say till their\n\nlast breath…\n\nAfter losing wife and uncle and the boycott of\n\nhis clan,\n\nAfter Ta’if, where they’d stoned him, came a gift from al-\n\nRahman.\n\nAs he lay asleep beside the Noble Ka’bah in the night,\n\nHe was woken by the angel, and then taken up in flight.\n\nRiding on Buraq, he made the journey that is called Isra,\n\nTo the city of Jerusalem, to Masjid al-Aqsa.\n\nThere, he led the prophets in a prayer, and chose milk over\n\nwine;\n\nThen ascended to the heavens for a tryst with the Divine.\n\nRaised beyond the seven skies, so many wondrous sights\n\nhe saw,\n\nTill he crossed the Furthest Lote-Tree, for his discourse\n\nwith Allah.\n\nSent back on that very night, he brought a gift for his\n\nUmmah;\n\nOn the next day, Muslims stood with him to pray their\n\nfirst Salah!\n\nAt the time of Hajj, the Prophet shared Islam with every clan;\n\nWhen the Truth spread to Medinah, the Quraysh devised a\n\nplan.\n\nAs they hatched the plot to kill him, came Allah’s divine\n\ncommand:\n\nFor the Message to continue, he would have to leave his land.\n\nAnd then he and Abu Bakr left their cherished home enroute,\n\nTo Medinah, for the Hijrah, with the pagans in pursuit.\n\nAs they hid inside a cave one time, a pagan almost saw, [but]\n\n“What do you think of two people when the third one is\n\nAllah?”\n\nWhile the people were awaiting him, at last, the Prophet\n\ncame;\n\nLight and joy filled all Madinah; it would never be the same!\n\nThen from joining them in brotherhood and leading them in\n\nprayer,\n\nHe made peace between the neighbors, teaching them with\n\nlove and care.\n\nWhen at Badr they first met Quraysh, the angels came\n\nand fought;\n\nThen at Uhud, when mistakes were made, some lessons\n\nwould be taught.\n\nThey would fight for truth and justice, while upholding\n\nchivalry.\n\nThey’d show strength when they were weak; when strong,\n\nthey would show clemency.\n\nIn the Battle of the Trench, they chose to fight defensively;\n\nAt the triumph of Hudaybiya, they used diplomacy.\n\nSo the Muslim Ummah grew with every test that it survived,\n\nTill the time to liberate the town of Makkah had arrived.\n\nMarching into Makkah unopposed, the Muslims now were\n\nstrong;\n\nWhen the pagans saw the Prophet, they knew that they had\n\nbeen wrong.\n\nFor so long they had oppressed him, now they feared he\n\nwould repay;\n\nBut he said, like Prophet Yusuf, \"There's no blame on\n\nyou today.\"\n\nAs the idols at the Ka’bah fell, he said {Truth now appears,\n\nAnd the falsehood has but perished; falsehood always\n\ndisappears.}\n\nThen the people came to Truth, just as the prophecy foretold,\n\nFor Allah had sent Muhammad as a mercy to the world!\n\nThen he went back to Madinah, choosing life with his Ansar,\n\nBut the was time fast-approaching, that they all had thought was far.\n\nFirst, he told all his Companions that this Hajj would be\n\nhis last;\n\nTo adhere to all the things that he had taught them in the past.\n\nThen, when seeing off a traveller, these parting words he gave:\n\n“When you come next year you might find just my masjid and\n\nmy grave.”\n\nWhen the time to part came closer, all the hearts were filled\n\nwith fear;\n\nWhat will happen if he leaves us? In this world, there's none\n\nmore dear!\n\nIn his final illness, Abu Bakr led the daily prayer;\n\nFrom his room, the Prophet smiled, giving one last look of care.\n\nThen, as our beloved Prophet lay in Aisha's arms, he spoke:\n\n\"Guard your prayers, and fear Allah in how you treat your\n\nservant-folk!\"\n\nThen, he gazed towards the heavens and began to say softly:\n\n“Allahumma! Gather me into The Highest Company!” [x3]\n\nAnd with that, the Prophet left this world; the universe\n\nshed tears...\n\nAll the precious time they'd had with him had been the best of\n\nyears.\n\nSECTION 13: LONGING FOR THE PROPHET (PEACE\n\nAND BLESSINGS BE UPON HIM)\n\nHow I wish I'd met the Prophet to touch his soft hands\n\nwith mine,\n\nOr to look upon his face, from which prophetic light would\n\nshine!\n\nOr to shield him when the rocks were thrown, so they'd\n\nhit me instead!\n\nBut my consolation comes in what Rasul Allah had said:\n\n“While my life was good for you, my death will be good for you\n\ntoo:\n\nI’ll be shown your deeds, so when I see a sin, I’ll pray for you.”\n\nAnd he said, “O people, if you one day face calamity,\n\nFind your strength by thinking of the pain you felt by losing\n\nme.”\n\nWhen he missed his brothers, his Companions asked,\n\n\"Then who are we?\"\n\n“Friends,” he said, “My brothers never saw me, yet\n\nbelieved in me!”\n\nIf you long to meet the Messenger, then patience is the key;\n\nAt the start of the Hereafter, you will see him finally.\n\nHe will be the leader of humanity on Judgement Day;\n\nAfter all, he was the Messenger when Adam was still clay.\n\nWhen the prophets on that Day will only say, “Nafsi!

young\n\nBut little did they know that the orphan son\n\nwould grow one day to be the chosen one\n\nSo\n\nHe grew under the tutelage of his uncle\n\nOne day when they were travelling was spotted by a monk\n\nThe monk recognized\n\nThat he was prophesized\n\nHe looked into his eyes\n\nHe saw in him the signs\n\nand this was not astrology\n\nI’m talking Deuteronomy\n\nand so his personality\n\nwas quick to gain autonomy\n\ngrown to be known\n\nas honest and strong\n\nTrustworthy everybody loved him like they love they own\n\nfamily and happily at 25\n\nHe married Khadija a woman who would stand by his side\n\nbut as the days flew by\n\nquestions arise\n\nabout\n\nHow his people was living they lives\n\nPaganistic and ritualistic\n\nSo this caused him to meditate about his existence\n\nin many instances he would retreat to a cave\n\njust to contemplate\n\nWell\n\nAge 40\n\nCave was the scene\n\nAngel appears\n\ntells him to read\n\nRead\n\nWhat shall I read\n\nNever was a literate one so tell him what do you mean\n\nZain Verse 1:\n\nThe same moon, the same star\n\nGazed right down at Rasulullah\n\nThey saw him climb, down from Hira\n\nNow a Prophet, a Messenger\n\nAnd in the sky, was Angel Gibraeel\n\nHe said O’ Muhammad, O’ Rasulullah\n\nZain Chorus: Muhammed is, and always will be\n\nThe last and final Prophet of Allah\n\nHe was a mercy, unto the universe\n\nPeace and blessings be on Al-Mustafa\n\nRap 2: He fled the home and told his wife an such\n\nwas scared to death he thought his mind was touched\n\npossessed\n\nbut she relieved stress\n\nand confirmed\n\nthat he was indeed a Prophet\n\nIt was then he regained his consciousness\n\nrealized what had happened no time to rest\n\nArise at morn\n\ncall everybody and warn\n\nThe religion of Islam reborn\n\nNow the first test was his family and friends\n\nlend me your ear O’ people who I have known for years\n\nYou have\n\ntrusted me with your life’s possessions\n\nI come to you now with a holy directive\n\na better direction\n\naway from the sin of worshiping false IDOLS\n\nand mistreating your women\n\nand no human\n\ncan ever be judged\n\nby the color of his skin\n\nno instead what he or she does\n\nKhalil Chorus:\n\nMuhammad Peace be upon his soul\n\nMuhammad Islam was his only goal\n\nMuhammad Sallallah hu Alay Wasallam\n\nRap 3:\n\nThis is the belief that I bring to you cuz\n\nand I ask for it nothing but the worship and love\n\nFor the Creator , the Maker , the Merciful the Savior\n\nSubmit your desires and you will gain His favor\n\nWell can you guess what they answer was\n\nMost of his fam simply laughed it off\n\ntold him he was crazy and they cast him off\n\ntook him as a joke all they did was scoff\n\nBut a few returned to the truth\n\nthen another few and then another few\n\nthen\n\nbefore his family knew it he had a following\n\nthey laughs turn ta frowns see they really couldn’t\n\nswallow this threat to a power structure\n\nso corrupt\n\nAll he wanted was to love his brothers\n\nin return their was torture they would make him suffer\n\nMany died but they couldn’t stop Allah’s Qadr, so he would rise!\n\nKhalil Chorus:\n\nMuhammad Peace be upon his soul\n\nMuhammad Islam was his only goal\n\nMuhammad Sallallah hu Alay Wasallam\n\nRap 4:\n\nInvited to Medina\n\nThey saw he was a leader\n\nProtection they would lend him\n\nAnd he would be their teacher\n\nThe brotherhood would grow\n\nHis enemies would fold\n\nThe Muslims were outnumbered\n\nOnly fearlessness they showed\n\nTime has come to go back home\n\nIn his possession now the strength to wipe out his foes\n\nSee they had tortured him and plotted on his death\n\nYet he spared them and chose no bloodshed\n\nCuz he was so compassionate\n\nAll he wanted was the people to acknowledge that\n\nSubmission would wipe out sins\n\nThat giving charity and honoring your mother wins\n\nThat righteous deeds would be the key\n\nTo salvation of the soul and we could be happy\n\nand he would go down in history\n\nAs the Greatest of all time we send him peace\n\nZain Verse 2:\n\nSo from that cave, in Mount Hira\n\nTo the holy city of Medina\n\nIn life and death, he showed Islam\n\nOpened

some ball,\n\nHe was fast and tall, he surpassed us all,\n\nBut after a while I'd see him playing less and less,\n\nHe be looking more depressed and stressed at best\n\nSo one day after class, I took him aside,\n\nI said tell me what's going on, man are you alright?\n\nHe said I got some issues with my folks I cant resolve\n\nNo need to stress you out Bro, or get you involved\n\nSo I put it to him, have you started smoking weed\n\nAnd the answer that he gave me really made be grieve\n\nHe said yeah once in a while when I need to mellow out\n\nBut I'll be alright, I'm not the one to worry about\n\nYo we got to get you help before you ruin yourself\n\nYou got greatness ahead, you aint like everyone else\n\nHe said I promise I'll be fine and he gave me his hand\n\nSo I trusted him and hoped that he would soon understand\n\nCouple months went by and he be worse and worse\n\nLike he was thrown in a curse, I hoped that he would reverse\n\nthen one day, he asked me for a couple a bucks\n\nHe said he needs to pay a friend and right now he's stuck,\n\nI said I know you smoking crack now, confirmed that for a fact now\n\nI gotta get you help now, don't even try to back down\n\nGave him the money, he promised Monday he would meet me\n\nFriday got the call that would defeat me completely\n\nFayaz had died of a drug over dose\n\nIt was the saddest day ever - aint nothing comes close\n\nMan I hate those drugs, hate ‘em with all of my soul\n\nchokes the young and the old, till their bodies is cold\n\nSo I don't care if you're a player or a wanna-be thug\n\nDon't ever, ever come close to drugs\n\nChorus:\n\nIt's happening more and more each day\n\nThese drugs making my friends crazy\n\nI'm laying it down...\n\nDont bring it around...\n\nCos I aint nothing but Drug Free\n\nVerse 2:\n\nMonths later, was still mourning his death\n\nWas angry and sad that he fell in this mess\n\nA teacher who noticed how miserable my soul was, Came Over\n\nHe said I see your carrying a boulder\n\nI know that I'm older, but let me tell you something that I never ever told ya - Put my arms around his shoulder\n\nMy daughter, she was the pride of my heart\n\nAs a father, we were never far apart\n\nWas a popular girl, always on top of the world\n\nNever scared to try something new and give it a whirl\n\nBut she had low self-esteem, If you know what I mean\n\nAnd it only takes a moment, Yo, to devastate a dream\n\nShe started hanging with this girl from school\n\nHer Grades went down and she started breaking rules\n\nAnd it festered and festered - we didn't want to face it\n\nTil one day, she came home totally wasted\n\nThen friend told us she was close to being arrested\n\nWe put our foot down and we forced her to get tested\n\nShe tested positive for drugs, but there was something else\n\nThe doctor asked to do more tests to check up on her health\n\nAnd then came the news, that would totally defeat me,\n\nHer use of all the needles, she had gotten HIV\n\nI was livid, that moment and that feeling I will always live with it,\n\nMan It's still vivid\n\nShe died 5 years ago, nothing I could help\n\nMy Lord has helped me with this pain that I felt\n\nWith tears in me eyes, Yo I gave him a hug,\n\nMay God give you strength to keep away from drugs\n\n..keep away from drugs, ..keep away from drugs\n\nChorus:\n\nIt's happening more and more each day\n\nThese drugs making my friends crazy\n\nI'm laying it down...\n\nDont bring it around...\n\nCos I aint nothing but Drug Free"
