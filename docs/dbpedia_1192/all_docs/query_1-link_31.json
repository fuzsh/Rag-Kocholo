        "text": "Dubbed the “King of Latin Pop,” for nearly three decades, Enrique Iglesias has released music. His 1995 self-titled debut and earlier hits “Experiencia Religiosa” and “Si Tú Te Vas” helped capture an international fan base.\n\nThroughout his collaborations with Whitney Houston, Lionel Richie, Kylie Minogue, Jennifer Lopez, Pitbull, and Usher, among others, Iglesias continued writing his own collection of songs stretching across heartfelt ballads and dance floor tracks—from his 1999 hit “Bailamos” (“We Dance”) and “Hero” in 2001, to “Escape,” “Do You Know? (The Ping Pong Song),” and more.\n\n[RELATED: Enrique Iglesias, Fans Raise $350K for Save the Children]\n\nIglesias, who released his 11th album, Final (Vol. 1), in 2021, has sold more than 170 million records worldwide and is one of the best-selling Latin music artists of all time. He also holds the record for the most No. 1 songs on the Hot Latin Songs chart with 27 songs.\n\nIn the early aughts and 2010s, Iglesias also wrote a few songs that he didn’t record.\n\nHere’s a look at three songs Iglesias wrote for other artists.\n\n1. “The Way,” Clay Aiken (2003)\n\nWritten by Enrique Iglesias, Kara DioGuardi, David Siegel, Steve Morales\n\nAfter winning the second season of American Idol in 2003, Clay Aiken released his debut album, Measure of a Man, just five months later. The album hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and the single, “The Way,” co-written by Iglesias and former American Idol judge Kara DioGuardi, peaked at No. 4 on the Hot 100 and was certified platinum.\n\nSomething about the way you look tonight\n\nSomething about the way that I can’t take my eyes off you\n\nSomething about the way your lips invite. Maybe it’s the way\n\nThat I get nervous when you’re around, and I want you to be mine\n\nAnd if you need a reason why\n\nIt’s in the way that you move me\n\nAnd the way you tease me\n\nThe way that I want you tonight\n\nIt’s in the way that you hold me\n\nAnd the way that you know me\n\nWhen I can’t find the right words to say\n\n2. “First Day of My Life,” Melanie C (2005)\n\nWritten by Enrique Iglesias and Guy Chambers\n\nIglesias and Guy Chambers first co-wrote “Un Nuovo Giorno” as the lead single for Andrea Bocelli’s first pop album, Andrea, in 2004. The song was later translated into English as “First Day of My Life” and recorded by Spice Girl Melanie C for her 2005 album, Beautiful Intentions.\n\nSo I found a reason to stay alive\n\nTry a little harder see the other side\n\nTalking to myself\n\nToo many sleepless nights\n\nTrying to find a meaning to this stupid life\n\nI don’t want your sympathy\n\nSometimes I don’t know who to be\n\nHey what you’re looking for\n\nNo one has the answer\n\nThey just want more\n\nHey who’s gonna make it back\n\nThis could be the first\n\nDay of my life\n\n3. “Dance Again,” Jennifer Lopez, featuring Pitbull (2012)\n\nWritten by Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull, RedOne, Bilal Hajji, AJ Junior\n\nIglesias co-wrote the title track featured on Jennifer Lopez‘s first greatest hits album, Dance Again… the Hits, in 2012. The track marked J Lo’s third collaboration with Pitbull, following “Fresh Out the Oven” in 2009 and the 2011 hit “On the Floor.”\n\nNobody knows what I’m feeling inside\n\nI find it so stupid\n\nSo why should I hide\n\nThat I love to make love to you, baby\n\nSo many ways, wanna touch you tonight\n\nI’m a big girl, got no secrets this time\n\nYeah, I love to make love to you, baby\n\nPhoto by Scott Dudelson/Getty Images"
