        "text": "Peace, one and all…\n\nAs part of its regular spiritual practice, the Threshold Society offers monthly themes for contemplation. In recent months, these themes have been particularly helpful for me, helping my heart open to new ways of looking at things. The October theme was especially profound:\n\n‘Only when distress turns to remembrance and blame of others is erased, is pride extracted from our egos, humbleness settles in our hearts, and the door of grace opens’\n\n(Imam Ali, freely paraphrased by Shaykh Kabir)\n\nOne of the things I’ve struggled most with, in recent years, is how to cope with difficulty and stress. Of course, no life is without problems, but this poor one has not found it easy to deal with his burdens. This feeling of struggle has been fed by many things. The times that we live in, and the political context of my life in 21st century Britain, are not conducive to stress-free living. The ‘ordinary’ struggle to make ends meet, and to raise our children well is another responsibility that weighs heavily upon my shoulders. More inwardly, I worry about my ability to discharge my responsibilities fully. At times, I have felt that the wheels were just about to come off. The question I ask my heart is this: how do I shoulder my burdens without allowing them to get me down? How can I carry them beautifully? How can I allow my heart to be transformed by God through these difficulties? How do I allow distress to be transformed into remembrance?\n\nDuring early October, as I was sitting with these questions, I found myself listening to Turkish ilahis, as I often do. One in particular seemed to jump out at me. Entitled Dertli Dolap, this beautiful ilahi speaks of trouble, difficulty and sorrow. Although such a song might sound morbid, the more I listened to it, the lighter my heart began to feel. As with many such songs, there are numerous different versions in existence, each with slightly different lyrics. One particularly useful website, offered this very beautiful translation:\n\n“Endless Trouble” is my name / Benim adım dertli dolap\n\nLike rushing water my life flows away / Suyum akar yalap yalap\n\nThis is God’s command / Böyle emreylemiş Çalap (God)\n\nI know trouble, my brothers! / Derdim vardır inilerim!\n\nA tree of this mountain am I / Ben bu dağın ağacıyım\n\nNeither sweet nor bitter am I / Ne tatlıyım ne acıyım\n\nA petitioner of God am I / Ben mevlâya duacıyım\n\nI know trouble, my brothers! / Derdim vardır inilerim!\n\nOn the mountain they felled my trunk / Dağda kestiler hezenim\n\nAll my schemes come to ‘naught / Bozuldu türlü düzenim\n\nWithout shame a troubador I / Ben usanmaz bir ozanım\n\nI know trouble, my brothers! / Derdim vardır inilerim\n\nYunus laughs not at what comes of this / Yûnûs bunda gelen gülmez\n\nHis wish no one achieves! / Kişi muradına ermez!\n\nIn this fleeting existence no one remains! / Bu fânide kimse kalmaz\n\nI know trouble, my brothers! / Derdim vardır inilerim\n\nAs I listened, that sense of helplessness that our burdens can sometimes engender began to dissolve, and I felt that unhelpful sense of bitterness also begin to drain away, as though some inward wound had been cleansed and a great deal of unhealthy infection had been removed. The words of God’s friends are a healing. I don’t pretend that this marks a moment of completion. Rather, it marks a moment of necessary healing so that the real work can begin anew.\n\nWhat struck me as so beautifully important in this song was that, despite sorrow and trouble, Yunus Emre’s focus remains firmly on Allah, on Haqq, on affirming the beauty and meaning of life through difficulty. Struggle is not ignored, it is transcended! Suffering is neither meaningless nor random, it is a powerful means of return to Reality. Or, as Imam Ali (as) puts it: ‘Only when distress turns to remembrance and blame of others is erased, is pride extracted from our egos, humbleness settles in our hearts, and the door of grace opens’.\n\nAs I listened to a version performed by a group of Halveti-Jerrahi dervishes, under the direction of beloved Shaykh Muzaffer Ozak Effendi (qs), other facets began to come into view. There are two versions easily available on You Tube. The first begins in a slow fashion, and has an almost dirge-like quality. The second is faster and is a recording from a zikr gathering. What both have in common, however, is that they are the work of a community of lovers. Many hands play the bendir. Many voices sing in unison. Many hearts are joined in this communion. In other words, whilst there is much healing to be had within the silence of our own souls, we are only perfected together. God is there for us when we falter, and can use any means He chooses and yet, we are also meant to be a channel of grace for each other. We are also meant to help each other through difficulties. Harmony within loving community is a mighty blessing, and one that can powerfully aid us on our way home.\n\nThe Threshold Society theme for November reinforced this point in an especially beautiful manner, being a saying of the Prophet (as):\n\n‘The faithful in their mutual love, affection and compassion for one another are as one body’\n\nSpiritual community, spiritual brotherhood and sisterhood, helps us in our troubles, helps us take them to God, helps us remember and thus to re-member ourselves.\n\nAnd praise be to God who maketh it so!\n\nDolap niçin inilersin?\n\nDolap niçin inilersin?\n\nDerdim vardır inilerim,\n\nİllallah.\n\nBen Mevla”ya aşık oldum,\n\nBen Mevla”ya aşık oldum,\n\nAn”ın için inilerim,\n\nİllallah.\n\nSubhanallah, Sultanallah,\n\nSubhanallah, Sultanallah,\n\nHer dertlere derman Allah,\n\nİllallah.\n\nBen bir dağın ağacıyam,\n\nBen bir dağın ağacıyam,\n\nNe tatlıyam, ne acıyam,\n\nİllallah.\n\nBen Mevla”ya duacıyam,\n\nBen Mevla”ya duacıyam,\n\nDerdim vardır inilerim,\n\nİllallah.\n\nSalatullah, selamullah,\n\nSalatullah, selamullah,\n\nAleyke Ya Rasulallah,\n\nİllallah.\n\nYunus burda gelen gülmez,\n\nYunus burda gelen gülmez,\n\nKişi muradına ermez,\n\nİllallah.\n\nBu fanide kimse kalmaz,\n\nBu fanide kimse kalmaz,\n\nDerdim vardır inilerim,\n\nİllallah.\n\nSubhanallah, Sultanallah,\n\nSubhanallah, Sultanallah,\n\nHer dertlere derman Allah,\n\nİllallah.\n\nAsk olsun! May love increase!"
