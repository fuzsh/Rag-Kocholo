J1Mulla and A1orFundz join in, expressing their desire to dance the night away and have a good time. There is a mention of Yoshi, possibly referring to a person or a nickname. \"Good job, Sho!\" might be a shoutout to someone named Sho who did a good job.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nThe chorus highlights the idea that they are still young and not ready for serious commitments. A1orFundz and J1mulla mention that they don't want to dance because someone broke their hearts. The question arises whether they should still give that person a chance. They emphasize that they want to live their lives and enjoy themselves, indicating that their love alone is not enough for a lasting relationship. They mention being with the \"dargs,\" which could mean friends or a close-knit group.\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nJ1mulla and A1orFundz mention several girls' names, including Brenda, Latisha, Lisa, Tanisha, Nikki, Sophie B, and Athena. They imply that these girls played games with them, and their hearts have grown cold as a result. They make it clear that they don't need these girls, even though the girls may need them.\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\nA1orFundz reflects on the situation, asking \"Who's who?\" This suggests that he wants everyone to be themselves and not pretend to be someone else. He wants to focus on his own path and moves instead of getting entangled in other people's games.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nThe chorus is repeated, emphasizing the desire to dance the night away and live life to the fullest. The mention of being with the \"dargs\" is reiterated, indicating their loyalty to their friends or crew.\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nTion Wayne enters with his verse, mentioning the names Sabrina, Lucy, and Jesy Nelson. He talks about his experiences with different girls and how his popularity has grown. He references his nomination for a BRIT Award and implies that he is sought after by many girls. He mentions a young boy named Jackson who wants to be like him. The verse concludes with a reference to Jesy Nelson, a former member of the girl group Little Mix, suggesting that the girls love a \"bad man\" like Tion Wayne.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nThe chorus is repeated again, emphasizing the desire to dance, the realization that their love is not enough, and the loyalty to their friends or crew (the \"dargs\").\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nA1orFundz reflects on his age, stating that he has just turned sixteen but is already making waves in the charts. He mentions pending checks, indicating that he's waiting for payments, and mocks the girl's interest in his social media following. He states that he's still dropping viral vocals and is known worldwide but remains grounded and local.\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\nThe pre-chorus is repeated, emphasizing the importance of staying true to oneself and focusing on personal growth and success.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nThe chorus is repeated one final time, reiterating the desire to dance, the realization that love alone is not enough, and the loyalty to the \"dargs\" or friends.\n\n[Outro]\n\nJennifer Lopez concludes the song, reiterating the idea of dancing the night away, living life to the fullest, and staying young on the dance floor.\n\nOverall, \"Night Away (Dance)\" portrays a youthful desire for fun and enjoyment while highlighting the challenges and complexities of romantic relationships. The artists express their reluctance to commit and their focus on personal growth and success. The song encourages listeners to embrace their youth, have a good time, and stay true to themselves."
