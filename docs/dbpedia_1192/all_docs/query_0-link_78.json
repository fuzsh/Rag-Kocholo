        "text": "To help the readers grasp the spirit of Islam and some of its fundamental principles clearly articulated in the article regarding music, entertainment, and other methods of relaxation, I decided, with the approval of the author, to lay down some excerpts of important opinions of reputable and contemporary scholars before the article itself (please see below)\n\nThe opinion of the contemporary Islamic jurist Shaikh al Azhar Mahmud Shaltut, rector of Al Azhar University, the most prestigious academic religious institution and center of excellence of the Muslim World. Mahmud Shaltut has given his consent to music basing his approval on the following arguments.\n\nFirst, he maintains that listening to music or performing music, like tasting delicious foods, feeling soft cloths, smelling pleasant odors, seeing beautiful sights, or achieving knowledge of unknown, are all instinctive pleasure with which Allah has endowed man. They all have the effect of calming when one is disturbed, of relaxing when one is tired, of refreshment in mental or physical exhaustion and of rekindling the participant with energy. Allah, Mahmud Shaltut argues, has created these instincts in human beings for a good purpose, and, therefore, it may even be impossible for them to perform their duties in this life without the aid of such instincts and, pleasures which will help them reach their goals. He concludes that it is, therefore, impossible that the shariah be against these instincts and pleasures. Instead the shariah provides for disciplining the instincts for pleasure and channeling their use so that they can work constructively together to achieve the higher moral ends.\n\nHis second argument is that the shariah, law, as well as the Qur’an on which it is based, seek to prevent exaggeration both on no-use or over-use of music.\n\nProf. Qaradawi, another renowned contemporary scholar concurs, as follows:\n\n“Islam does not require of Muslims that their speech should consists entirely of pious utterances, that their silence should be a meditation, that they should listen to nothing except the recitation of the Qur’an, nor that they should spend all their leisure time in the mosque. Rather, it recognizes that Allah has created human beings with needs and desires, so that, as they need to eat and drink, they also need to relax and to enjoy themselves”.\n\nHe adds further: “Among the entertainments which may comfort the soul, please the heart, and refresh the ear is singing. Islam permits singing under the condition that it should not to be in any way obscene or harmful to Islamic morals. There is no harm in its being accompanied with music which is not exciting.\n\n“In order to create an atmosphere of joy and happiness, singing is recommended on festive occasions such as the days of Eid, weddings and wedding feasts, births, aqiqat (the celebration of the birth of a baby by the slaughter of sheep), and on the return of a traveler.\n\n“However, there are some limitations to be observed in the matter of singing:”\n\n“Those who are broadminded and religiously knowledgeable know that singing is not in conflict with the laws or moral code of Islam. The Muslim scholars are not against folk songs which are successful combination of religious, faith and moral code. The spiritual and moral qualities have intermingled in the folk songs.\n\nTaking all factors into consideration we can say that singing to the accompaniment of music is not forbidden. What is important is to strike a balance between entertainment and social-religious obligation.”\n\nMusic & Islam\n\nShah Abdul Halim\n\nMusic means the art and science of combining vocal and instrumental sounds or tones so as to form a wide variety of aesthetically and emotionally satisfying expression. It’s a universal language.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the people of Bangladesh are accustomed to listening to music. If we adopt a thoughtful approach, we will realize that the attraction of singing and a sweet singing melodious voice are in conformity with human nature. Mothers in Bangladesh chant songs and rhymes so that the suckling babies fall asleep. Sweet and appeasing rhymes are sung to stop babies from crying. The babies become busy listening to the nursery rhymes and forget about crying. Wet nurses make a habit of singing nursery rhymes to young children. Mothers are also of the habit of singing nursery rhymes while swinging their babies to sleep in their cradles. During the marriage ceremony women have been singing songs since the early days of Islam.\n\nThe muazzin makes adhan (call for salah - ritual prayer), five times a day, from the minaret of the mosque in a rhythmic tone. Muslims throughout the world recite the Qur’an in seven different qirah (styles). Even birds and animals are touched by sweet sounds and rhymes. The Arab Muslims since the early days have been singing songs known as huda to cheer up the camels to run quicker forgetting their heavy burdens and long distance as was done by the camel driver Anjashah of Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him.\n\nThe camels are so influenced by the rhythm of the songs of the caravan leader that even heavy loads seem light to them. In Bangladesh, before the introduction of mechanized farming, the cultivators used to chant hurra hurra so that the bulls run faster. During a country boat race, the boatmen sing and even use musical instruments like dhak, dhol, jhanjhor, kansa and ghanta. Musical instruments are used to enthuse the rowers, increase their strength and inspire them to row in a synchronized manner. The rowers chant heio, aro jore heio. Songs are now exclusively composed and sung on such occasions as the harvesting of the crops. Salesmen sing songs to push their commodities and products.\n\nIn the Bangladesh villages young boys use palm leaves, coconut leaves, mango shells and bamboo chips for playing music. Recently the Daily Prothom Alo, Dhaka, Bangladesh, quoting AFP, Telegraph and ABC News reported that a European concert group, the Vienna Vegetable Orchestra, is playing music with such vegetable items as carrot, cucumber, pumpkin, tomato, etc. With carrot they are playing guitar and with cucumber they are playing drum and they have been successful in completely enthralling the audience.1 The drums are being beaten by the soldiers from the early days of Islam.\n\nIf we look back at history we find the Muslim society has customarily shown great tolerance for music. Music is not included in the forbidden list and there is no prescribed or specific penalty in the shariah, the Qur’an and the authentic and well-established hadiths (the sayings, actions and the tacit approval of Prophet Muhammad) for playing music or enjoying music.\n\nThe Muslim history also does not mention any incident of penalty under tazir (administrative authority) by the rightly-guided Caliphs for playing or enjoying music. There is also no record in history that the Umayyad, the Abbasid and other Caliphates imposed penalty for playing or enjoying music.\n\nThe scenario being this, why in Bangladesh some ulama (Islamic religious scholars) are of the habit of making harsh comments on those who are associated with music? Why are all these controversies about music? It would have been wise if our ulama are always careful not to make sweeping comments on those associated with music or condemn music as such. Instead of using such words as haram (forbidden or prohibited), our earlier Islamic religious scholars while commenting on the playing and listening of music used such words as makruh (unfavorable, not encouraged) and mubah (allowed).\n\nImam Ibn Taymiyyah classified singing as muharam (forbidden), makruh (unfavored), mubah (indifferent), wajib (recommended) and mustahabb (commendable).2\n\nUnfortunately, the people of our time, without due consideration of the pros and cons of any matter and despite their lack of adequate knowledge of the subject under discussion, have been issuing verdicts. Considering the present state of mind of the ulama, an in-depth study on music is necessary to educate the ulama as well as the general public so that a balanced approach may be made concerning music. In this book the same issue has been repeated again and again for greater clarity quoting views of different scholars so that the findings in the book become more acceptable to the readers.\n\nHistory records that Islam and Muslims put restrictions only on the use of certain types of music, and supported and promoted other forms. There is, therefore, no question of outright rejection of music. The qirah or the recitation of the Qur’an is being performed for fourteen centuries. In this backdrop, it needs to be identified what is music and what is not music in Muslim culture and what sorts of music are not permitted by Islam. This will be clear from the following:\n\nCategory A\n\nFirst, the qirah (the recitation of the Qur’an) is performed in seven distinct rhythmic styles. There have been no oppositions to such recitations, for, the Qur’an states: … and recite the Qur’an in slow, measured rhythmic tones (Qur’an 73:4). Prophet Muhammad said: Adore the Qur’an by reciting it with your nice voice.3 Therefore, the pitched-sound rendition of the Qur’an is allowed.\n\nSecond, the adhan, (the call for ritual prayer) is made from the minaret of every mosque five times a day with its distinct rhythmic style like qirah. Prophet Muhammad asked his Companion Abdullah ibn Abd Rabbih when he narrated his dream as to how to call the people to salah (ritual prayer) the Prophet said that his dream is true and advised him to go to Bilal and ask him to make a call for prayer as the latter had the best voice among the Companions.4\n\nThird, the talbiyah or the chanting by the hajis during the annual pilgrimage.\n\nFourth, the eulogy chanting like hamd (poems eulogizing Allah) and naat (poems eulogizing Prophet Muhammad).\n\nFifth, the sher or the chanting of such poems which have noble themes; singing in rhythm at midnight during the month of Ramadan to awaken the people from sleep to take sahri.\n\nAll the above five types (under Category A) fall within such music that is acceptable in Islam. However, the qirah, the adhan, the talbiyah, the hamd, the naat and the sher are not considered music as such. The Muslim culture refused to identify these as music.\n\nCategory B\n\nSixth, music during family celebrations like wedding, aqiqat (the celebration of the birth of a baby by slaughtering sheep), birthday, circumcision of the child, welcome reception, festival on recovery from illness, reception for the hajis and return or arrival of the beloved ones like the arrival of Prophet Muhammad in Madinah when ansar children sang with daff, tambourine – á¹­ala‘a 'l-badru ‘alaynÄ min thaniyyÄti 'l-wadÄ‘ wajaba 'l-shukru ‘alaynÄ mÄ da‘Ä li-l-lÄhi dÄ‘ - the full moon has risen over us from the valley of Wada‘.\n\nSeventh, occupational music like caravan chants, shepherds’ tuning, workers’ songs, chorus in unison like singing during the casting of roof of a building or the lifting of heavy materials, singing on the occasion of the harvesting of new crops, etc. Labors who work in the construction of a building and carry heavy materials sing songs charged with enthusiasm to encourage themselves to exert their utmost efforts. During the Battle of Khandaq Prophet Muhammad along with his Companions sang while digging trenches around Madinah.5\n\nEighth, military band played by the soldiers during war and public celebrations.\n\nThese three types of music (six-seven-eight under Category B) are included among the halal (legitimate) group of the sound art expression.\n\nBut the Muslims do not regard these three as equal to the first five types of music (under Category A) namely the qirah, the adhan, the talbiyah, the hamd-naat and the sher.\n\nAll the above eight types (under Category A and Category B) are considered approved form of music.\n\nThe adhan, the talbiyah, the hamd-naat, music during family celebrations, wedding celebrations, occupational music and the brass and percussion music of the military bands have been supported by examples from the life of the Prophet Muhammad and his Companions.\n\nCategory C\n\nNinth, the rhythmic vocal and instrumental improvisation, favored by a large percentage of the population, though not universally approved as in Category A and Category B.\n\nTenth, the serious metered songs which is enjoyed and considered harmless by a sizeable percentage of society.\n\nThe above two types of music (nine-ten under Category C) are leveled controversial but have no doubt been popular among the Muslims in various parts of the world. Some people consider music under Category C as halal (legitimate), some others consider it mubah (legally indifferent or which is not prohibited and considered as allowed), and some other people consider it as makruh (not favored or disliked).\n\nHowever, in no circumstances the performance and enjoyment of music (nine-ten) under Category C is equal with music under Category A and under Category B.\n\nCategory D\n\nEleventh, sensuous music which is performed at the taverns, bars and such other places in association with condemned activities or which might incite such prohibited practices as consumption of drugs and alcohol, sex beyond marital bond, etc. to which Muslims have always been unwilling to accord their approval. Such kinds of music have all the time been considered to be outside the pale of approval by Muslims because of its associations with illegitimate practices and non-conformance with Islamic aesthetic and ethical norms.\n\nThe type of music at the level of sensuous music (eleven under Category D) that incite lust and abandonment of social and religious duties is at all times regarded with suspicion and disapproval by the protagonists as well as by the antagonists.\n\nIn addition to what has been discussed above (Category A, Category B, Category C and Category D) as to the legality and illegality of music, the Muslims throughout the world observe the following principles pertaining to music:\n\n* The more a certain type of musical expression draws for its musical and poetic inspiration from the Qur’an, the more it has been appreciated and legitimized. The more it drifts away from that model, the more vulnerable it is and likely to be exposed to pitfall. For example, the adhan, the talbiyah, the hamd, the naat and the poem’s eulogizing Allah and Prophet Muhammad and the chanting of such poems as have noble themes and eulogy chants have almost identical musical characteristics as those of the Qur’anic chanting. Much of the family and celebration music and occupational music are governed by similar characteristics. Even the solo vocal and instrumental improvisations as mentioned in Category C above have shown clear resemblance to the chanting of the Qur’an and won a considerable ratio of approval and acceptance.\n\n* The conformity of the characteristics of poetic and musical content and form become progressively weaker in each successive category as mentioned above (A then B then C and then D).\n\n* Category A (the qirah, the adhan, the talbiyah, the hamd, the naat and the sher that are not really considered music) has enjoyed the universal acceptance as well as respect of the Muslims. Category B (music during family celebration, occupational music and military band played by the soldiers during war and public celebrations) has also been accepted by most Muslims. As we descend from Category A (followed by Category B, then Category C and then Category D) the number of people who consider involvement with music completely acceptable decreases. Only a small minority accords approval to the sensuous music as mentioned in Category D above and all consider its performance or enjoyment in some degree problematic.\n\n* Category A and Category B have been regarded as capable of directing the hearers’ mind and soul to Allah and to Allah commanded duties, whereas the examples in the Category C and then Category D are successively less capable of producing that desired effect. At the bottom (Category D) is the sensuous music, which is associated with drugs, alcohol, sexual promiscuity leading to immoral life, and so it is widely rejected for its corruptive influence on the individual and the society.\n\nMusicians\n\nThe Muslim society is not univocal in its support for the musicians. Those who perform the qirah, the adhan and other forms of pitched-sound art as mentioned in Category A and Category B have been accorded unquestioned acceptance. Amateurs who perform at the controversial level as mentioned in Category C are also immune from social criticism and discrimination. Those who are professional performers and involved with the disapproved sensual music as mentioned in Category D have no doubt been regarded with suspicion and disdain. This is not because of the actual act of musical performance but because of moral laxity involved with the commercial pursuit of that profession. The professionals have always been the object of suspicion or even disdain in the Muslim society, whereas the non-professionals have been tolerated or even admired for their ability.\n\nAttitudes towards the musicians vary according to a number of circumstances. Imam al Ghazzali identified these factors as zaman, makan and ikhwan i.e. time, place and associates of the musical activity. 6\n\nZaman is an important factor for the obvious reason that if the performance or enjoyment of music interferes with the time for actualizing a higher Islamic goal – prayer or care for the family – it is certainly detrimental and need to be avoided. Life is a serious matter which allows little time for frivolous and playful entertainment. Imam al Ghazzali, therefore, argued that if a musician or listener devotes too much time to music, these activities become detrimental rather than making a positive contribution to life.\n\nMakan refers to another often expressed Muslim belief that the musicians are judged by the specific context of the performance, the surrounding situation and circumstance. The acceptability of the place and the occasion for musical performance has been of equal importance in judging the performing artistes as well as anyone who listens to them.\n\nIkhwan, the associates, the companions of the musical activity, if performing or listening to otherwise acceptable musical expression, puts one in the company of just and honorable companions, it is not to be considered a harmful activity. On the other, if performance or enjoyment of music caused the participant to interact with those who might lead one to the neglect of religious and social responsibilities or to moral degradation, it is a disapproved activity, regardless of the musical products involved.\n\nThe Muslim society used the above three factors (time, place and associates) as measurements to determine the approval or rejection of the activity, the art product, the performer, and even the participating listeners. In Muslim culture, these factors played a more important role in determining the approval or not of any performance than the characteristics of the music itself. Some scholars condemn the performance of a type of music in one context or under certain circumstances, while approving the same in another situation. The playing of daff, tambourine was regarded as halal by the early jurists when done by women in the wedding or other joyous celebrations, but condemned if used by men in some other contexts like mingling with homosexuals and getting involved with the associated crimes. The beating of drum or tambourine is acceptable for military music or the march but is often rejected in other contexts.\n\nEarlier scholars have made a clear distinction between those persons who are involved in music under permitted circumstances which have been outlined in Category A, Category B and Category C, and those who participate under religiously and socially disapproved circumstances as outlined in Category D. The musician becomes suspect not because he performs music but because he performs music in religiously-socially-culturally disapproved circumstances.\n\nInstruments and Instrumental Music\n\nThe general tendency among the Muslims is that instruments and instrumental music are somewhat less appreciated than the singing voice and vocal music. The playing of musical instrumental are avoided in areas mentioned in Category A namely, qirah, adhan, talbiyah, hamd, naat and sher; though they are generally approved for use in such areas as mentioned in Category B namely, music during family celebrations like wedding celebrations, occupational music like caravan chants, shepherds’ tunes, workers’ songs like singing during the casting of roof of the building, etc. and military band played by the soldiers during war or other formal practices and public celebrations. However, zaman, makan and ikhwan factors are the guiding principles of approval and rejection of instruments and instrumental music.\n\nImam al Ghazzali is of the opinion that those instruments which have nice sounds should not be forbidden but those instruments of music that are associated with wine, homosexuality and other prohibited things, their use must not be permitted. In other words, it is well-established that certain instruments are considered to be suitable for certain circumstances, while disapproved for others. We shall critically examine and discuss in the later part of the book whether or not any musical instrument is really prohibited at all.\n\nThe sayings of Prophet Muhammad (There will be people in my nation who will consider adultery, silk, intoxicant and al-maazef lawful) had created great misunderstanding among a section of earlier scholars as to the permissibility and impermissibility of music as one of the meanings of al-maazef is musical instruments. Later scholars, however, raised a very pertinent question as to whether aforementioned saying of Prophet Muhammad forbids al-maazef, even if we take it as a musical instrument, per se or forbids music as such or in association with adultery, silk and intoxicant.7\n\nNow let us look at the practice of instruments and instrumental music during the time of Prophet Muhammad and immediately afterwards by his Companions. Prophet Muhammad allowed Ibn Omar to listen music played on the pipe. The Companions of Prophet Muhammad even listened singing and music played on the tambourine when a caravan arrived while Prophet Muhammad was making a speech in the mosque leaving him standing. Imam al Ashokani considered singing to be permitted even if accompanied by lute and reed instruments. Others, namely Ibn Omar found nothing wrong with the lute, Abdullah Ibn Azzobayer was found sitting with the lute by his side, Ibn Jaar had a lute, Hassan Ibn Thabet heard poems sung on the lute, Malek Ibn Anas of Maleki School of Thought allowed singing with musical instruments and particularly permitted playing the lute, Assamaa Abu al Fadl Ibn Taher thought there was agreement among the people of Madinah that lute is allowed, Ibn Annahawi thought that there was a broad consensus of opinion in Madinah on allowing lute, Ibrahim Ibn Saad played lute, Shafi School of Thought allowed playing lute and Al Adfwi stressed the fact that playing lute is allowed.8 It was the consensus of the above-mentioned scholars that it is lawful to listen to music played with conventional musical instruments, Prof. Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi pointed out.9 Imam al Ghazzali thought that musical instruments like al duff, tambourine with jingling rings had been allowed.10\n\nImam al Ghazzali considered strings, wood wind instruments and koba drums (musical instrument that look like kettledrum) forbidden as it is used by alcoholics. These instruments are subject to the same law of forbidding intoxicants for three reasons: these instruments invite people to drinking, remind people of the illegal pleasure gathering and lastly people who gather around these instruments are sinful, Imam al Ghazzali opined.11\n\nEven now Nashad Groups in Malaysia use percussion instruments like kompang, gongs, rebana (single-headed drum) and drums, and they stay away from string and serunai instruments such as flutes, trumpets, saxophones, guitars and violins.12 The notable members of such groups are Raihan, Rabbani, Hijjaz, Brothers, Saujana, Jauhari, Diwani In-Team, Nowseeheart, The Zikir, Suara Firdaus, Usrah al Soff, Al Anwar Group, Solehah and Qatrunnada.13\n\nProf. Dr. Yusuf al Qaradawi, however, refutes the claim made by Imam al Ghazali and stressed that there is not a single authentic and clear-cut revealed Text which forbids those instruments as claimed by Imam al Ghazali. 14\n\nIf we look at the practice now in the Muslim World we find that during Ramadan in many Muslim countries a man walks in the streets tapping on a small drum to wake up people to eat sahri, the last meal before the sunrise. In Egypt, Mesaharati does the same job. In Egypt, the Mawal folklore is often sung to the accompaniment of reed pipe. Mawawil were also sung to the accompaniment of such musical instruments as organ. The Mawawils sang lyrics depicting the bravery of national heroes, words against injustice of the people and other issues as love, passion, longing and desertion. People used to gather to hear songs sung on Arrababa tune (Rebab is an Arab musical instrument with one or three strings) to the accompaniment of musical instruments.\n\nMurad Hofmann commented: While sexually arousing rhythmically hypnotizing music is condemned, morally elating ‘classical’ music, both Arabic and Western, is recognized as valuable. Moving Qur’anic recitation (tartil and tajwid) and highly aesthetic call to prayer (al adhan) are sounds – not music – of a spiritual nature, like melodious Sufi contemplation (as sama)”.15\n\nMusic and the sound art are the manifestation of the deepest convictions of people. Music is a universal language. It is a cultural phenomenon that can play an important role in the life of the Muslims. In fact, there is no Qur’anic passage that condemns the practice of this aesthetic pleasure directly. “There is no Qur’anic passage that condemns the sound arts generally or even those genres properly labeled as musiqa”.16\n\nSinging\n\nMusic opens the inner eye which sees the secret of nature. It creates a wonderful feeling in mind. Some sounds give pleasure, some pain, some bring sleep, some excite passions, some move the organs of the body. Mind becomes such as if the rings of songs sound in the innermost recess of the heart. Song is the food of the soul of a spiritual man.\n\nSongs are not as such unlawful for musical sounds but for other reasons. The reason of songs being unlawful is that they were connected with wine which made them unlawful. Nobody says that the sweet sounds of birds are unlawful. If sama is held unlawful, then to hear the sound of nightingale is also unlawful. If to hear the sound of nightingale is lawful, then will it not be lawful to hear the sweet and melodious sounds which have got wisdom and good meanings? When recitation of poetry without sound and rhythm is lawful, then to recite them with sound and rhythm are lawful. These are rational reasoning.\n\nImam al Ghazzali opined that songs sometimes become lawful and sometimes unlawful according to the circumstances of each case. Sometimes it becomes undesirable. It is unlawful for those youths whose sexual passions are strong as it increases their hidden vices in their minds. It is not illegal for those who enjoy good moral songs and it is commendable for those religious persons who are engrossed in Divine Love.17\n\nImam Ayatollah Khomeini remarked: One should decide which music is haram, prohibited for her or him by the way it affects her or him. Likewise (the permissibility and impermissibility of) using musical instruments depends on how these are used and by whom.18 Khomeini allowed the playing of classical music on the Iranian radio and television.19\n\nErudite Islamic scholar Abul Kalam Azad observed: I can always remain happy without the necessities of life, but I cannot live without music. A sweet voice is the support and prop of my life, a healing for my mental labors. Sweet music is the cure for all the ills and aliments of my body and heart.20\n\nProf. Dr. Yusuf al Qaradawi commented: Art is a source of emotional fulfillment. It refers to the creative and imaginative forms which can elevate the mind and emotions of man to new heights. Obscene, erotic and evil singing is unlawful, hence forbidden. Songs which include forbidden words are altogether unlawful, particularly when rhyme, rhythm and side effects work together to make the evil meanings attractive. Songs which do not arouse sexual feelings are lawful. A thing is not forbidden unless there is a clear Text of the Qur’an or the sunnah forbidding that.\n\nSinging makes one kind-hearted. Singing is simply one of the good and pure things which appeals to man. Man takes great pleasure in listening to songs. He finds spiritual and intellectual fulfillment with the tunes. Just as tasty food gives pleasure to the mouth, creative music gives pleasure to the ears. Similarly, picturesque settings give pleasure to the eyes and sweet smell gives pleasure to the nose. All good things in which man finds spiritual, physical, emotional or intellectual fulfillment are lawful.\n\nNot all forms of singing are allowed. Such rhymes as: The world is nothing without a glass of wine, obviously violates the teachings of Islam which deem all kinds of alcoholic drinks as abomination.\n\nSongs that describe the physical appearance of women are unlawful. It is also forbidden to sing words which describe the features and outward appearance of a particular woman describing her temple and cheeks before male audience for Allah has asked believing men to lower their gaze when fall on the opposite sex (Qur'an 24: 30-31).\n\nArtistes and performers must be properly dressed. The personality, dress, glamorous style of living and negative behavior of the artistes also contributes to the shaping of the perception of music. There is no value in entertainment if its performers have no morals, if the dress is near to nudity.\n\nIt also so happens that the text of a song is lawful but it may become unlawful if it is transmitted in an unbecoming style. The words presentation, performance, costume, light, location, zoom-in and out, the cast and the singer all together may be used to convey a message which may be otherwise offensive and undesirable, provoke human passion and tempt individuals in doing things not worthy. The singer, while on the stage, should not act as if, he or she, is drinking, he or she should not expose or display his or her body and beauty or propagate shamelessness. Listening to song while baijis (songstress-professional singing girls) sing and dance with a glass of wine in hand before the zamindars, landlords as in the sub-continent or in the cabaret and bar in the Western countries are also forbidden.\n\nProf. Dr. Yusuf al Qaradawi observed that the art of singing has a fundamental role in the religious and worldly life of the Muslims. People respond to it readily and instinctively. Those who are broadminded and religiously knowledgeable know that singing is not in conflict with the laws or moral code of Islam. The Muslim scholars are not against folk songs which are successful combination of religious, faith and moral code. The spiritual and moral qualities have intermingled in the folk songs.\n\nTaking all factors into consideration we can say that singing to the accompaniment of music is not forbidden. What is important is to strike a balance between entertainment and social-religious obligation. The way of Islam is siratul mustaqim, straight path (Qur’an 1:6) and we must maintain equilibrium in our activities, mundane or divine. Muslims are ummatan wasata, balanced community (Qur’an 2:143) and everything must be accomplished in due proportion as Islam even forbids excessiveness in worship.\n\nProphet Muhammad recommended enjoying lawful pleasures. The Muslim mind or the sense of hearing seems inclined towards sweet sounds. Rhythm and rhyme satisfy a basic need of man. There is music in the impressive tunes of religious supplications sung by sweet angelic voices.\n\nIslam is definitely not at war with human instincts. It does not aim at neutralizing its influence on man. Instead, it aims at refining and elevating man to a new height of perfection. The hearts get bored just as the bodies do; therefore, it is necessary to always provide the hearts with novel and useful pearls of wisdom. Amusement revives the heart and rids it of its burden. If the heart is overloaded it may be simply blinded. Diversions fuel it with enough energy and motivation. In fact, diversion is the antidote to ailment and monotony.\n\nIdle Tales. Vain Talks\n\nSome scholars are of the view that music and singing are not allowed in Islam. They quote the Qur’anic verse: Those who purchase idle tales, without knowledge to mislead men from the path of Allah and throw ridicule on the path (Qur’an 31:6). They also quote: And when they hear vain talk, they turn away there from (Qur’an 28:55). According to these scholars, lahwal hadith (idle tales) is, by extension, a reference to singing. The distinguished Islamic scholar of our time Prof. Dr. Tariq Ramadan, in this connection, pointed out: The interpretation of lahwa as singing is an abuse of interpretation (the word means useless and vain talk and by extension everything that is useless and without importance), and even if one accepts this meaning, one should understand that lahwa is to be avoided but it is not illicit (haram).21\n\nMoreover, there is no logic in interpreting “vain talks” (Qur’an 31:6 - And there are among people some who buy vain talks to lead men astray from Allah’s Way without knowledge, and to make mockery of it. For such there is humiliating chastisement) as singing as Prophet Muhammad and his Companions listened singing. Prophet Muhammad heard two slave girls singing and he did not scold them on the basis of its being forbidden. He even asked Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him to let them continue.22 There is also no scope for taking vain talks as singing as the words of the aforesaid verse humiliating chastisement waits only for them who make mockery. In fact, Allah intends to punish only the violators who are sinners i.e. who make mockery. He never criticized whoever buys vain talks for diversion and entertainment.\n\nScholars who are opposed to music also quote verse 28:55 of the Qur’an (And when they hear people speaking nonsense (vain talks or uttering useless talks) they avoid it) to justify that music is prohibited. Prof. Dr. Yusuf al Qaradawi refuting such logic viewed that even if for argument’s sake we accept that music is idle talk and is to be avoided, such avoidance is merely explicit announcement. That abstaining from it is preferred, even praised, and there is no direct forbiddance of singing.23 It is, therefore, evident that listening to useless songs per se is not forbidden provided that the time appointed for that purpose does not encroach upon the time appointed for carrying out a duty or a religious obligation. And the Qur’an states: Allah will not call you to account for thoughtlessness in your oaths but for the intention in your hearts (Qur’an 2:225 and Qur’an 5:89). Prof. Dr. Yusuf al Qaradawi opined that singing always does not come under the purview of speaking nonsense or uttering useless talks. Its usefulness and uselessness depends on the intention of the singer.24 One may listen to songs with innocent intention and refreshment so that one can be charged with the spiritual strength necessary for obedience to Allah. If one has neither intention of obedience or disobedience at heart while participating or listening to music, it comes within the category of nonsense or uttering useless talks which Allah forgives.\n\nProphet Muhammad said: What Allah has made permissible in His Book is permissible and what He has forbidden is unlawful and what He deliberately did not mention is forgiven.25 The Qur’an states: And your Lord is never forgetful (Qur’an 19:64). From this we can conclude that since singing and music are not in the forbidden list, these are lawful.\n\nOpinion of Shaikh al Azhar Mahmud Shaltut\n\nSo far various aspects of music and the use of musical instruments have been discussed. Now it would be appropriate to summarize the lessons of what has been discussed above before examining other aspects of the subject. For this purpose, we would quote the opinion of the contemporary Islamic jurist Shaikh al Azhar Mahmud Shaltut, rector of Al Azhar University, the most prestigious academic religious institution and center of excellence of the Muslim World. Mahmud Shaltut has given his consent to music basing his approval on the following arguments.\n\nFirst, he maintains that listening to music or performing music, like tasting delicious foods, feeling soft cloths, smelling pleasant odors, seeing beautiful sights, or achieving knowledge of unknown, are all instinctive pleasure with which Allah has endowed man. They all have the effect of calming when one is disturbed, of relaxing when one is tired, of refreshment in mental or physical exhaustion and of rekindling the participant with energy. Allah, Mahmud Shaltut argues, has created these instincts in human beings for a good purpose, and, therefore, it may even be impossible for them to perform their duties in this life without the aid of such instincts and, pleasures which will help them reach their goals. He concludes that it is, therefore, impossible that the shariah be against these instincts and pleasures. Instead the shariah provides for disciplining the instincts for pleasure and channeling their use so that they can work constructively together to achieve the higher moral ends.\n\nHis second argument is that the shariah, law, as well as the Qur’an on which it is based, seek to prevent exaggeration both on no-use or over-use of music.\n\nThirdly, like earlier Islamic scholars, Mahmud Shaltut is of the opinion that music is permitted whenever it has a suitable context, as it does when used as an accompaniment for war, weddings and Eid celebrations and, music is prohibited when attached to drinking of alcohol or indulgence in such practices as adultery. The prohibition is based on the context and associations, and is not a reaction against the music itself. Prophet Muhammad and his Companions had indeed listened to music and attended sessions of innocent performances. Mahmud Shaltut, therefore, concludes, as did many of the early scholars, that the prohibition does not result from condemnation of the music as such, but from its use under the wrong circumstances or with morally debilitating associations.\n\nFourthly, Mahmud Shaltut repeats the argument used by the earlier Islamic scholars. He has cautioned against the reckless forbidding of what Allah did not forbid (Qur’an 7: 32-33). He condemns as slander and falsehood such false attributions to Allah. Mahmud Shaltut thus concludes that the general rule is that music is permissible; its prohibition is the accident or exception caused by improper usage.26\n\nOpinion of Prof. Dr. Yusuf al Qaradawi\n\nProf. Dr. Yusuf al Qaradawi, Dean of the Faculty of Shariah and Islamic Studies, Qatar University, writing on singing and music, commented: “Islam does not require of Muslims that their speech should consists entirely of pious utterances, that their silence should be a meditation, that they should listen to nothing except the recitation of the Qur’an, nor that they should spend all their leisure time in the mosque. Rather, it recognizes that Allah has created human beings with needs and desires, so that, as they need to eat and drink, they also need to relax and to enjoy themselves”.27\n\nHe adds further: “Among the entertainments which may comfort the soul, please the heart, and refresh the ear is singing. Islam permits singing under the condition that it should not to be in any way obscene or harmful to Islamic morals. There is no harm in its being accompanied with music which is not exciting.\n\n“In order to create an atmosphere of joy and happiness, singing is recommended on festive occasions such as the days of Eid, weddings and wedding feasts, births, aqiqat (the celebration of the birth of a baby by the slaughter of sheep), and on the return of a traveler.\n\n“However, there are some limitations to be observed in the matter of singing:\n\n“1. The subject matter of songs should not be against the teachings of Islam. For example, if the song is in praise of wine, and it invites people to drink, singing or listening, it is haram, prohibited.\n\n“2. Although the subject matter itself may not be against the Islamic teachings, the manner of singing may render it haram, forbidden; this would be the case, for example, if the singing is accompanied with suggestive sexual movement.\n\n“3. Islam fights against excess and extravagance in anything, even in worship; how, then, can it tolerate excessive involvement with entertainment? Too much time should not be wasted in such activities; after all, what is time but life itself? One cannot dispute the fact that spending time in permissible activities consumes time which ought to be reserved for carrying out religious obligations and doing good deeds. It is aptly said, there is no excess except at the expense of a neglected duty.\n\n“4. Each individual is the best judge of himself. If a certain type of singing arouses one’s passions, leads one towards sin, excites the animal instincts and dulls spirituality, he must avoid it, thus closing the door of temptation.\n\n“5. There is a unanimous agreement that if singing is done in conjunction with haram, forbidden activities – for example, a drinking party, or if it is mixed with obscenity and sin – it is haram, forbidden”.28 Otherwise singing is lawful and within the purview of allowed recreational activities.\n\nNeglecting Music\n\nHowever, the practice of music is neglected in the Muslim society. The presentation of musical knowledge is never included in the agenda of any Islamic seminar. But this cannot be a positive outlook keeping in view the cultural changes taking place in the contemporary world and the unprecedented cultural interactions and alien influences on our life and culture. Unfortunately, the alien aesthetic influences today are much more pervasive than they were in earlier times. Contemporary technological advancement has a sound art invasion based on other ideologies into the most remote corner of the Muslim world. In fact, music is a significant defense against cultural alienation or annihilation and can protect Muslim cultural identity from erosion and obliteration. The rejection of certain types of sound art, therefore, should not be viewed as a cultural and religious prohibition of all types of music. We should be prepared to accept and appreciate those forms of music that are compatible with the ideology and ethos of Islam and in harmony with its customs and traditions. But the Muslims have generally been unable to understand the importance of singing and music. Instrumental music has now become an important tool to approach those who are reluctant to read important Islamic materials and also to hear a speech of a renowned Islamic scholar. Indeed it is one of the best mediums in educating young Muslims today as they can affect soul, stir emotion and instill fear and hope in the people.29\n\nIndeed, singing and music can be a tool for constructive entertainment and educating people and in conveying Islamic message. In Bangladesh, Nazrul sangit is popular among the people more than its lyric because of its melody, humming, jingling, sweet tremor and the magical power of its music to enthrall the listeners and make people forget their pain and sorrow.\n\nProf. Dr. Lois Lamya al Faruqi, a distinguished academician, commenting on the reasons of neglecting music or the sound art, observed: “Some Muslims have attempted, therefore, to erect an “iron curtain” around them, to isolate their families and children from those forms of sound art that might be instruments of de-Islamization. With the prevalence of modern communication technology in every town and village, such attempted isolation is rarely, if ever, successful. Others meet the challenge by trying to prohibit all the sound arts, regardless of their characteristics. In such cases, the resulting artistic vacuum is inevitably filled by non-Islamic forms of music, which invade the minds of the less thoroughly Islamized members of the community - its youth”.30\n\nMoreover, in the past listeners of music were compelled to go to the venue of the function and such listeners had no option but to observe everything, the singers and even the girl singers, the chorus that include both male and female singers and the musicians. Nowadays, a listener can just push a button and listen to music without requiring mixing with the chorus. Listeners can now avoid obscene channels, too. Therefore, positive songs with music cannot be considered to be forbidden.\n\nArtistes and Islamic Preaching\n\nThis being so, the natural question arises: Can artistes be involved in the diffusion of da’wah, the propagation of Islam by using this medium? If yes, how Islamic precepts are going to be applied to entertainment and arts. No doubt, it is possible and artistes can affect the soul, stir the emotion and instill fear and hope in the people. The lyrics of the songs must be pure and innocent and must keep within the moral bounds set up by Islamic teachings. No erotic or licentious lyric is allowed. It must be based on the Qur’anic principles so that it can ignite the imagination of the people. That da’wah or the preaching of Islam can be further advanced by using this medium will be clear from the six examples mentioned below:\n\nTala'al Badru\n\ná¹­ala‘a 'l-badru ‘alaynÄ\n\nmin

The reply is: Yes it can be as long as such recitation is within the limits of the rules of tajwid.54 The Qur’an can be related in a large sense to music. Qur’an can be recited in a beautiful melodious way and in an attractive vibrating quavering tone. Music has the power to affect the human spirit and penetrate the heart of man. It excites feelings and emotions and sometimes calms; music uplifts the sick, pacifies irritable children, and encourages armies to fight on the battlefield. Denying music completely, without reservation, is not reasonable or realistic, for music and harmony exist both in nature and in man himself. The palpitation of our heart is rhythmic and in perfect harmony. There is music in the flowing of water, in a bird’s singing, just as there is music in the crying of the baby and in the moaning of a patient. So it is impossible to separate music from man.\n\nProf. Dr. Seyyed Hossein Nasr, an eminent academician, commented: “The Qur’an itself in its traditional prosody is at once music and poetry, although traditionally it has not been classified as either but, being the Word of Allah, belongs to a category above all categories of human art. … The call to prayer (al-adhan) is almost always sung, as the Noble Qur’an whose chanting is the most nourishing of all music for the soul of the people of faith (muminun) although the chanting has never been technically called ‘music’, that is musiqa or ghina. Even now, during Ramadan, in some Islamic cities, one can observe the age old tradition of waking the people in time to eat before dawn and the beginning of the fast by means of chants, and sometimes trumpets. … Finally, it might be mentioned that the Muslim armies performing the holy war (al jihad) were accompanied from the earliest times by a type of music which intensified the qualities of bravery and courage within the hearts of soldiers. … Jalal al-Din Rumi often took songs from the taverns of Anatolia and converted them into vehicles for the expression of the most profound yearning for Allah. … The spiritual concert is permissible (mubah) for the lovers of Allah; it is forbidden (haram) for the ignorant.\n\nProf. Dr. Seyyed Hossein Nasr concluded: “Islam has banned music which leads to forgetfulness of Allah and has forbidden those Muslims from hearing it who would become distracted from the spiritual world and become immersed in worldliness through listening music. But Islam has preserved for the whole community music in its most exalting and yet sober aspect”. 55\n\nJalal al Din Rumi observed: Music is the food of lover of Allah … The fire of love is made keen inflamed by melodies … 56\n\nConclusion\n\nThe challenge before the Muslims today, therefore, is not only to close the door to obscene items of entertainment but to make available to the people positive programs so that the energy of the people could be diverted to constructive channels. The uppermost responsibility of those who work for social reform and renewal is to work in this direction. The scholars, intellectuals, cultural activists and ulama must remain ever vigilant and do their utmost to encourage those who can bring out the required transformation in the Muslim society by being proactive.\n\nArticle prepared on: 1st January 2011.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Music is not included in the forbidden list and there is no specific penalty, hadd, in the shariah, the Qur’an and the authentic and well established hadith, for playing music or enjoying music. Muslim history also does not illustrate any incident of penalty under tazir, administrative authority, by the rightly guided caliphs for playing or enjoying music. There is also no record in the history that Umayyad, Abbasid and other caliphates imposed penalty for playing or enjoying music. Allah has cautioned us against the reckless forbidding of what He did not forbid [Qur’an 7: 32-33]. Allah has prohibited singing and music is false attributions and slander against Allah and should be rejected outright. The general rule is that music is permissible; its prohibition is the accident or exception caused by improper usage. Islam has preserved for the whole community music in its most exalting and yet sober aspect. In fact music is a significant defense against cultural alienation or annihilation and can protect Muslim cultural identity from erosion and obliteration. In this book the same issue has been repeated again and again, which might not look academic and also be boring to some readers, for greater clarity quoting views of different scholars so that the findings in the book become more acceptable to the readers and the ulama, Islamic religious scholars.] #"
