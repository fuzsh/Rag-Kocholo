        "text": "MIDDLE GRADES\n\n52 Poems for 52 Weeks: A Lunar Year by Abdullah Mansoor\n\nThis isn’t the typical book I would review, but after spending some time in a middle school language arts classroom teaching this school year, I thought I should at least acknowledge the value a book like this can have in a classroom or homeschool curriculum, and that it shouldn’t be completely overlooked and dismissed. I… Read more: 52 Poems for 52 Weeks: A Lunar Year by Abdullah Mansoor\n\nA Bit of Earth by Karuna Riazi\n\nThis Secret Garden retelling mixes the heart of the original with a dash of modernity, the flavor of desi culture, and the lyricism of a good writer. Over 368 pages the slow plot but rich imagery will draw readers in, hold their attention, and leave them thinking about the characters they have been fortunate to… Read more: A Bit of Earth by Karuna Riazi\n\nA Galaxy of Sea Stars by Jeanne Zulick Ferruolo\n\nThis middle grade, 330 page book is an easy read that touches on concepts of change within friendships and families with the back drop of life in a coastal town, finding courage, and Islamaphobia. While early middle school readers might find the book a bit predictable and cliche’, the characters, lessons, and fluid storytelling would… Read more: A Galaxy of Sea Stars by Jeanne Zulick Ferruolo\n\nA Little Piece of Ground By Elizabeth Laird with Sonia Nimr\n\nThere are so few Palestinian middle grade books, so on that premise alone this 216 page book has a lot of value. Because I am not Palestinian, I do not live, nor have I ever lived under occupation, I can argue some of the concerns from a point of privilege, and I acknowledge that is… Read more: A Little Piece of Ground By Elizabeth Laird with Sonia Nimr\n\nA Long Pitch Home by Natalie Dias Lorenzi\n\nThe correlation between baseball and cricket provides the foundation for detailing the relationship of Bilal’s first year in America after having to leave Pakistan in a hurry: the same, but different. This 248 page book written on an AR 4.6 pivots around sports, but has a lot of heart as themes of family, friendship, and… Read more: A Long Pitch Home by Natalie Dias Lorenzi\n\nA Party in Ramadan By Asma Mobin-Uddin Illustrated by Laura Jacobsen\n\nThis is a great book that works on a variety of levels. Leena is fasting the whole day for the first time, but is also invited to a friends party. Her mom gives her the choice to fast or not as it is not yet mandatory at her age, and she decides to fast AND… Read more: A Party in Ramadan By Asma Mobin-Uddin Illustrated by Laura Jacobsen\n\nA Place at the Table by Saadia Faruqi and Laura Shovan\n\nThis fabulously fresh and honest book told in alternating OWN voices shows how two seemingly different 6th grade girls discover how much they have in common as they learn about themselves and their families along the way. Sarah is a Muslim Pakistani-American, and Elizabeth is Jewish and has an English immigrant mom, the two come… Read more: A Place at the Table by Saadia Faruqi and Laura Shovan\n\nA Pocketful of Stars by Aisha Bushby\n\nThis middle grades magic realism novel draws you in and pulls on your heartstrings pausing only to offer pointed commentary on friendship, self-awareness, and self acceptance. Oh sure there were parts that seemed a bit repetitive and parts I had to read again because the continuity was just off enough to have me confused, but… Read more: A Pocketful of Stars by Aisha Bushby\n\nA Tale from Turkey The Hungry Coat by Demi\n\nIt really bothered me that I didn’t love the version I read of The Parrot and the Turkey about Nasreddin Hodja, especially after finding out how entwined he is in Turkish culture, and reading some of his tales online. So, when I found that Demi had also rewritten and illustrated a tale from his collection I… Read more: A Tale from Turkey The Hungry Coat by Demi\n\nA Tale of Highly Unusual Magic by Lisa Papademetriou\n\nFor a book about magic, featuring a girl who admittedly knows very little about Islam, a surprising number of tidbits sneak through and work to introduce Islam and Pakistani culture to those unfamiliar, while similarly exciting Muslims readers who can see a major climax point a mile away and get to feel “in” on the… Read more: A Tale of Highly Unusual Magic by Lisa Papademetriou\n\nA Thousand Questions by Saadia Faruqi\n\nThis 320 page middle grade novel with alternating point of view chapters engulfs you like a warm genuine hug. It does not have a clear climax, it is predictable, and some characters and cultural touch points could have used more detail, but honestly, I couldn’t put it down. As a half American kid who spent… Read more: A Thousand Questions by Saadia Faruqi\n\nAccused: My Story of Injustice (I, Witness Series Book 1) by Adama Bah\n\nThis is the first book in a new middle grades nonfiction series and is Adama Bah telling her own story about being detained as a 16 year old and falsely accused of being a suicide bomber.

I’m not sure if it qualifies as OWN voice, being it has a female author, but the authenticity in the little religious and cultural… Read more: Ahmed Aziz’s Epic Year by Nina Hamza\n\nAlia’s Mission: Saving the Books of Iraq by Mark Alan Stamaty\n\nBased on the true story of Alia Muhammed Baker, the Basra librarian who saved 30,000 books in 2003 from the destruction during the Iraq War, this 32 page graphic novel, is an AR 3.9 and while it isn’t a chapter book and isn’t just a picture book, it works well for 2nd through 4th grade… Read more: Alia’s Mission: Saving the Books of Iraq by Mark Alan Stamaty\n\nAllies by Alan Gratz\n\nThis is the second Alan Gratz multi-perspective historical fiction novel I’m reviewing for its inclusion of a Muslim character. While in Refugee it seemed a natural choice to include a Muslim family, I was completely shocked that he would feature one in a WWII D-Day novel. With numerous storylines spread over 322 pages the book… Read more: Allies by Alan Gratz\n\nAmal Unbound by Aisha Saeed\n\nThis book was suggested to me and I was thrilled to find it at the public library so quickly after its May 8, 2018 release date. I love that it is an AR 4.2 and 226 pages about a girl standing up for her self, determined to be educated, and facing whatever society, and culture,… Read more: Amal Unbound by Aisha Saeed\n\nAmazing Muslims Who Changed the World: Extraordinary Stories of Incredible People by Burhana Islam illustrated by Reya Ahmed, Deema Alawa, Nabi H. Ali, Saffa Khan, Aaliya Jaleel and Aghnia Mardiyah\n\nThe 30 stories presented over 197 pages are inspiring, and this compilation so desperately overdue. The book is not chronological it is completely random, and at first I was confused, but as I made my way through the book, I actually grew to love not knowing who I would be reading about next. Yes, there… Read more: Amazing Muslims Who Changed the World: Extraordinary Stories of Incredible People by Burhana Islam illustrated by Reya Ahmed, Deema Alawa, Nabi H. Ali, Saffa Khan, Aaliya Jaleel and Aghnia Mardiyah\n\nAmina’s Song by Hena Khan\n\nThis middle grades companion book to Amina’s Voice, reads in much of the same way as a lot of Hena Khan books in that I feel she is presenting Pakistani Muslims in America to non Pakistani non Muslims in the west. In the first quarter or so of this 288 page book that takes place… Read more: Amina’s Song by Hena Khan\n\nAmina’s Voice by Hena Khan\n\nThis book really marked a shift in Islamic fiction for me and the genre. First of all I was waiting for the book to come out. I didn’t stumble upon it or hear about it from someone else. I knew when it was going to be released, and I knew I wanted to read it.… Read more: Amina’s Voice by Hena Khan\n\nAmir and the Jinn Princess by M.T. Khan\n\nThis 304 page middle grade fantasy book is a quick fun read. There is no religion in this Muslim authored book, jinn are not portrayed as creatures from Islamic doctrine, and with the exception of Quranic decorations hanging in a room and Zam Zam water being mentioned, once each, in passing, there is nothing hinting… Read more: Amir and the Jinn Princess by M.T. Khan\n\nAmira & Hamza: The War to Save the Worlds by Samira Ahmed\n\nMake sure you are sitting in a comfy spot when you crack open this middle grades fantasy adventure, because it hits the ground running from the very beginning and doesn’t let up over 368 pages.

Jalali\n\nI truly am glad I read this book. I love historical fiction, visiting Spain is on my bucket list, this book has a map, details about what is historical what is fiction, has Islam woven in to the heart and soul of the story and characters, and yet it was a hard read. The first… Read more: An Andalus Adventure by S.N.

I mean I understand that it was derived from stories the author told his children, and I’m guessing it was written to show similarities between Muslims and Christians, but I don’t understand how the 168 pages with lots of photographs and text from the Qur’an got published… Read more: Better Than a Thousand Months: An American Muslim Family Celebration by Hassaun Ali Jones-Bey\n\nBetty Before X by Ilyasah Shabazz with Renee Watson\n\nThis 248 middle grades (AR 4.9) fictionalized biography of Betty Sanders, later to be Betty X and then Betty Shabazz, is the early years of her life in Detroit during the 1940s and how she understood her place in her family, and in the community.

The characters at the beginning and their relationships with one another don’t read consistent… Read more: Call Me Al by Wali Shah and Eric Walters\n\nCinderella: An Islamic Tale by Fawzia Gilani illustrated by Shireen Adams\n\nI’ve seen this book countless times online and honestly have never given it a second glance. I mean Cinderella is a classic fairytale and I have a few different versions from around the world, but an Islamic one? It seemed like it would be awkward or overly preachy and forced. I should have given Fawzia… Read more: Cinderella: An Islamic Tale by Fawzia Gilani illustrated by Shireen Adams\n\nCity of the Plague Gods (Rick Riordan Presents) by Sarwat Chadda\n\nI was excited to hear that another Rick Riordan/ Rick Riordan Presents books featured a Muslim character and was anxious to see how the multi god genre would account for Islamic tenants.

Brandes illustrated by Katie Wood\n\nIt is great to see a beautiful hijabi on the front of a sports book, written by a non Muslim, published by a major publisher, and having the story have nothing to do with the cloth on her head, but rather the skills on the court.

Senzai\n\nEscape from Syria by Samya Kullab, Jackie Roche, and Mike Freiheit\n\nI have read a fair amount of fictionalized accounts of the war in Syria, the journey of refugees, and their resettling in various countries, but this was the first graphic novel on the subject that I have seen, and I was excited to wait my turn behind my kids to read it. My 7th and… Read more: Escape from Syria by Samya Kullab, Jackie Roche, and Mike Freiheit\n\nExtra Credit by Andrew Clements\n\nHaving seen this book a million times, I never paid close enough attention to realize that the boy on the cover is an Afghani boy and that half of the story is told from an American girl’s perspective and half from young Sadeed. My trusted librarian friend advised that the book is best taught through… Read more: Extra Credit by Andrew Clements\n\nFight Back by A.M. Dassu\n\nAt 384 pages, this middle grades book takes on hijab, terrorism, Islamophobia, finding your voice, and fighting back. At times the book was insightful and smoothly written, at other times the voice seemed childish and the writing directionless. The inconsistencies don’t ultimately make the book good or bad for me, but rather very forgettable. I… Read more: Fight Back by A.M. Dassu\n\nFloat Like A Butterfly by Ntozake Shange illustrated by Edel Rodriguez\n\nThis 40 page biography beautifully presents major events of the famous boxer’s life without going in to much explanation.

Many included were the… Read more: Game Changers: Stories of Hijabi Athletes from around the World by Charlene Smith illustrated by Natalya Tariq\n\nGirls Who Code by Stacia Deutsch and Michelle Schusterman\n\nI sadly think that it is safe to say that whenever you see a book that features a cast of characters meant to include multiple minority groups, certain representation is going to read more generic and formulaic than others. Translation: just because you see a hijabi on the cover, do not rush out to obtain,… Read more: Girls Who Code by Stacia Deutsch and Michelle Schusterman\n\nGrounded: A Novel by Aisha Saeed, Huda Al-Marashi, Jamilah Thompkins Bigelow and S.K. Ali\n\nOver the years I’ve read to a lot of kids, with a lot of kids, discussed books in classrooms, and in book clubs, so when reviewing I often share what kids think or what I imagine kids will think, and I usually acknowledge when I’m being overly critical as a reviewer, but this book I… Read more: Grounded: A Novel by Aisha Saeed, Huda Al-Marashi, Jamilah Thompkins Bigelow and S.K.

Written in… Read more: Invincible Abdullah: The Deadly Mountain Revenge by Haji Uthman Hutchinson\n\nIqbal and His Ingenious Idea: How a Science Project Helps One Family and the Planet by Elizabeth Suneby and Rebecca Green\n\nIt is a bit odd that this story is fiction, when it reads so much like a piece of nonfiction. It is a picture book, but has an AR level of 4th grade 4th month. So, while the story is great and highlights a country and culture, Bangladesh, not often seen, I don’t know that… Read more: Iqbal and His Ingenious Idea: How a Science Project Helps One Family and the Planet by Elizabeth Suneby and Rebecca Green\n\nIslamaphobia deal with it in the name of peace by Safia Saleh illustrated by Hana Shafi\n\nThis nonfiction book has given me pause. The information, the approach, the presentation, the importance, is all really well done, I just can’t really grasp how to use the book. It is broken up in to four sections: Islamophobia 101, The Believer, The Intolerant, and The Bystander.

This 176 page book flows… Read more: Khadijah: Mother of History’s Greatest Nation by Fatima Barkatulla\n\nKicked Out by A.M. Dassu\n\nThe first few chapters of this 336 page middle grade book were rough. It is a stand-alone companion novel, and I have read the previous works, so I don’t know if my expectation of myself to know the characters being introduced, was additionally muddled because the memories were faint, or as I actually suspect, the… Read more: Kicked Out by A.M. Dassu\n\nLailah’s Lunchbox: A Ramadan Story by Reem Faruqi illustrated by Lea Lyon\n\nAnother standout in a crowded field of Ramadan picture books, mashaAllah, Lailah’s Lunchbox works well even outside of Ramadan for Muslim and Muslim children alike.

The book is… Read more: Lala Comics: The Hilarious encounters of a Muslim Woman Learning Her Religion by Umm Sulayman\n\nLeila and the Sands of Time by Shirin Shamsi\n\nThis 127 page book has a lot of potential, but ultimately didn’t win me over. It is one of those that needs a good editor to encourage the author to flesh out the characters, take advantage of a potentially cathartic resolution, and fill the gaping holes in the story. Meant for ages 8-12 the tiny… Read more: Leila and the Sands of Time by Shirin Shamsi\n\nLetters from a Prophet by Zimarina Sarwar illustrated by Giorgio Bacchin\n\nI’m not a fan, as a general rule, of lift the flap books for toddlers (they just tear them), so imagine my delight when I was completely captivated with a lift the flap book for middle grade and up!

As adults we often cling to the ones with happy endings for our children and for ourselves, because the tragic ones are too numerous and overwhelming… Read more: Lost and Found Cat: The True Story of Kunkush’s Incredible Journey by Doug Kuntz and Amy Shrodes illustrated by Sue Cornelison\n\nLove by Matt de la Pena illustrated by Loren Long\n\nThis 40-page-book may have a simple title, but most of us know, there is nothing simple about love, and this book shows love in many forms from a child’s perspective as they grow.

Sometimes when picture books try to do more, the audience… Read more: Love by Matt de la Pena illustrated by Loren Long\n\nLowriders to the Rescue by Cathy Camper illustrated by Raúl Gonzalez III\n\nThis is my first Lowriders book, so admittedly there was a lot going on that I really don’t feel confident that I understood, but even with that, it was a sweet story of first love (crush), Arab and Latinx joy, humor, social activism, environmentalism, gentrification, and fun. I don’t know that the other books in… Read more: Lowriders to the Rescue by Cathy Camper illustrated by Raúl Gonzalez III\n\nLulu and the Very Big Meanies by Mac McGooshie illustrated by Alexis Hogwood\n\nI don’t know what is more frustrating: quality books that are poorly packaged (binding, illustrations, font, spacing, etc.) or beautiful books that miss the mark in storytelling and basic writing skills. Both are equally annoying, and while yes, a good story should be the basis, this book is really well written that the presentation of… Read more: Lulu and the Very Big Meanies by Mac McGooshie illustrated by Alexis Hogwood\n\nLuv Ya Bunches by Lauren Miracle\n\nA book about 5th grade friendships told from the perspective of four different girls in a variety of styles: instant messages, chatroom conversations, video scripts, and traditional text.

It is written on… Read more: Luv Ya Bunches by Lauren Miracle\n\nMagid Fasts for Ramadan by Mary Matthews illustrated by E. B. Lewis\n\nThe intent of this 48 page chapter book is good, however, a few things rubbed me the wrong way about how Ramadan and Islam are presented.

The beginning didn’t immediately grip me, but I told myself… Read more: Majdi Mansoor and the Book of Miracles by Anisa Bezak\n\nMalala’s Magic Pencil by Malala Yousafzai illustrated by Kerascoet\n\nI’m going to try my best to review a nonfiction autobiographical book and focus on the story, not on the author because yikes, Pakistanis have strong opinions about Malala, and I have no desire to get pulled in to an argument. I’m half Pakistani, I know the position of both sides. I have read both… Read more: Malala’s Magic Pencil by Malala Yousafzai illustrated by Kerascoet\n\nMansa Musa: The Lion of Mali by Kephra Burns illustrated by Leo & Dianne Dillon\n\nThis beautiful work of historical fiction/folklore is both moving and visually breathtaking. The 56 page book presents as a picture book, but with an AR 6.4 and the amount of text, it reads like a chapter book.

I don’t get paid,… Read more: Miss Never Pleased by Ayesha Marfani illustrated by Aisha Aamir\n\nMore to the Story by Hena Khan\n\nFor a book written by an accomplished author for 3rd to 7th graders focusing on a Muslim family, I was surprised at how despite wanting to absolutely love this book, I only kind of liked it. For the first 100 of 271 pages, I really kept hoping there was going to be more to the story. Luckily… Read more: More to the Story by Hena Khan\n\nMs. Marvel Stretched Thin by Nadia Shammas illustrated by Nabi H. Ali\n\nThis tween graphic novel of our favorite Muslim superhero is authored and illustrated by a new Muslim duo that share an OWN voice story over 110 pages about balancing life and priorities and making time for family.
