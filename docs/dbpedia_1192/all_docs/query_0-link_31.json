Through a lens of “loving correction” rather than mere critique, author adrienne maree brown helps us reimagine how to hold ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities accountable by setting clear boundaries, engaging in reflection, and nurturing honest relationships.\n\nAlong with allowing us more authentic access to ourselves and to each other, these “corrections” are intended to explore and break identity-based patterns including white supremacy, fragility, patriarchy, and ableism. brown also offers practical guidance on how to apologize and be accountable from our nuanced positions of power, history, and resources.\n\nadrienne maree brown grows ideas in public. She is a student of the works of Octavia E. Butler and Ursula K. Le Guin. Some of her books include Emergent Strategy, Pleasure Activism, We Will Not Cancel Us, and the speculative fiction trilogy, Grievers.

André uses their work to emphasize the experiences of marginalized communities while highlighting the repercussions of contemporary and historical discrimination. His art explores ideas of communal and personal identity, influenced by his direct experiences as a queer African American raised in Tennessee and Texas. Focusing on Black liberation, queer justice, and the reality of mental health, he aspires for his art to help bring power to the people.\n\nDuring this program, André discusses the relationship between raw emotion and image making. André has been a crybaby for as long as they can remember; from forgetting their homework as a kid to watching those cheesy videos of families reuniting as an adult, they’ve never been able to shake those tears! André is just an emotional-ass person. For a long time, they considered it a substantial weakness within their personhood. In reality, all that crying was coming from a person who cared deeply for the people he loved.\n\nToday, André channels their emotions into the themes behind their work. André uses his artwork to storytell, teach, and question ideas regarding historically marginalized communities–pushing these realities to the forefront of a world plagued by misogyny, anti-queerness, and white supremacy. During this Creativity Continues, André will share work from his mixed-media project BLACK SNAFU, investigating the reason he felt compelled to create the series and critique pop-culture, and why he believes it is important for people–especially marginalized people–to create from real, raw, doggone emotions.\n\nAt the end of their presentation, André takes questions from the webinar audience. A recorded segment of the live event will be available for all those registered.\n\nSelected for Silver Eye’s inaugural 2021 Silver List and a two-time Finalist for Photolucida’s Critical Mass (in 2020 and 2023), André has shown their work at various institutions across the United States, including the Tamarind Institute–Albuquerque, New Mexico, the Museum of Fine Arts Houston–Houston, Texas, Leon Gallery–Denver, Colorado, and FILTER Photo–Chicago, Illinois. He received his BFA from Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas, and his MFA at The University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nCreativity Continues is a program that collectively develops creative voices by offering connection and encouraging expression. Because the goal is to engage all within our creative community, we encourage you to extend invitations and share Santa Fe Workshops Creativity Continues events with anyone who expresses an interest.\n\nEVENT LINK: https://tinyurl.com/blessings-a-novel\n\nJuly 11th, 9:00pm-11:00pm, Virtual, Free\n\nCity Lights and Doubleday Books celebrate the publication of Blessings: a novel by Chukwuebuka Ibeh, published by Doubleday.\n\nMoonlight meets Purple Hibiscus in this searing debut of self-acceptance, sexual awakening, and first love set in a Nigeria on the verge of criminalizing same-sex relationships.\n\nObiefuna has always been the black sheep of his family—sensitive where his father, Anozie, is pragmatic, a dancer where his brother, Ekene, is a natural athlete. But when Obiefuna’s father witnesses an intimate moment between his teenage son and another boy, his deepest fears are confirmed, and Obiefuna is banished to boarding school. As he navigates his new school’s strict hierarchy and unpredictable violence, Obiefuna both finds and hides who he truly is. Back home, his mother, Uzoamaka, must contend with the absence of her beloved son, her husband’s cryptic reasons for sending him away, and the hard truths that they’ve all been hiding from. As Nigeria teeters on the brink of criminalizing same-sex relationships, Obiefuna’s identity becomes more dangerous than ever before, and the life he wants drifts further out of reach. Set in post-military Nigeria and culminating in the Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act of 2013, Blessings is an elegant and exquisitely moving story that asks how to live freely in a country that forbids one’s truest self, and what it takes for love to flourish despite it all.\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS:\n\nChukwuebuka Ibeh is a writer from Port Harcourt, Nigeria, born in 2000. His writing has appeared in McSweeneys, New England Review of Books and Lolwe, amongst others, and he is a staff writer at Brittle Paper. He was the runner-up for the 2021 J.F. Powers Prize for Fiction, was a finalist for the Gerald Kraak Award, and was profiled as one of the “Most Promising New Voices of Nigerian Fiction” by Electric Literature. He has studied creative writing under Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Dave Eggers, and Tash Aw, and is currently a an MFA student at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nfrancesca ekwuyasi is a is a learner, artist and storyteller born in Lagos, Nigeria.

Butter Honey Pig Bread placed second on CBC’s Canada Reads: Canada’s Annual Battle of the Books, where it was selected as one of five contenders in 2021 for “the one book that all of Canada should read.” francesca’s writing has appeared in the Malahat Review, Transition Magazine, Room Magazine, Brittle Paper, the Ex-Puritan, C-Magazine, Vol. 1 Brooklyn, Canadian Art, Chatelain and elsewhere. Her short story Ọrun is Heaven was longlisted for the 2019 Journey Prize. She co-authored Curious Sounds: A Dialogue in Three Movements (Arsenal Pulp Press, 2023), a multi-genre collaborative book with Roger Mooking.\n\nNamed one of USA Today, Esquire, & Cosmopolitan's most anticipated books of 2024\n\n“Chukwuebuka Ibeh’s writing has a certain delicacy to it, so wonderfully observant, and so beautiful.” —Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, author of Americanah and Purple Hibiscus\n\n“Blessings is a stunning and exceptionally moving story of love, shame, redemption and fierce familial bonds. In sublime, evocative prose and from alternating points of view, Ibeh tells the story of Uzoamaka and Obiefuna as mother and son come to transformative realizations about themselves and each other. Ibeh has an elegant and passionate way with language, from the depictions of the Nigerian cultural landscape and its tense reckonings with queerness to the gorgeous mundanities of the protagonists’ home lives and the various dynamics of religion, class, and schoolboyhood. I’m grateful that this beautiful book exists, and I will return to it again and again as if for the first time.” —Francesca Ekwuyasi, author of Butter Honey Pig Bread\n\n“Blessings is as raw and heart-wrenching as it is beautiful and delicate. A masterfully executed story about love, faith and sexuality that clenches your heart and doesn’t let go until the very last page. Ibeh is a once in a lifetime talent!” —Elvin James Mensah, author of Small Joys\n\n“A sublime coming-of-age tale… An extraordinarily composed and deeply felt debut.”\n\n—The Guardian\n\n“There is music to the way Chukwuebuka Ibeh writes. There is balance. Blessings pulled me into a world I’m extremely unfamiliar with, yet somehow made it comfortable, even resonant. The intimate storytelling, the powerful dialogue, and the well-paced narrative all made it one hell of a heartbreakingly joyous read. Each chapter of this debut novel enthralled me, pushing me to the next, eager to share the road with its unforgettable protagonist right up to the ending, which made me want to start from the beginning again. On top of it all, Ibeh has provided a meaningful representation of queer Nigerians—one that opens borders and breaks barriers. An opportunity for many not only to see what Obiefuna and his mother see, but also to feel what they feel. Run, don’t walk, to get this book.” —Danny Ramadan, author of The Foghorn Echoes\n\n\"Wow—what a debut! I was left feeling heartbroken yet hopeful. Chukwuebuka Ibeh is a beautiful writer.\" —Taylor-Dior Rumble, author of The Situationship\n\nEVENT LINK: https://tinyurl.com/virtual-hip-hop-homelands\n\nJune 26th, 8:00pm-9:00pm, Virtual, Free\n\nDance Artists Lotus Bomb & Janice Tomlinson expand on their 2023 work-in-progress collaborative project with \"Are You Having Fun?

Kuang (R.F. Kuang) as she chats with us about her New York Times bestselling novel, Yellowface. Yellowface grapples with questions of diversity, racism, and cultural appropriation, as well as the terrifying alienation of social media.\n\nIn Yellowface, Authors June Hayward and Athena Liu were supposed to be twin rising stars. But Athena’s a literary darling. June Hayward is literally nobody. Who wants stories about basic white girls, June thinks.\n\nSo when June witnesses Athena’s death in a freak accident, she acts on impulse: she steals Athena’s just-finished masterpiece, an experimental novel about the unsung contributions of Chinese laborers during World War I.\n\nSo what if June edits Athena’s novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Song—complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo? Doesn’t this piece of history deserve to be told, whoever the teller? That’s what June claims, and the New York Times bestseller list seems to agree.\n\nBut June can’t get away from Athena’s shadow, and emerging evidence threatens to bring June’s (stolen) success down around her. As June races to protect her secret, she discovers exactly how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves.\n\nWhite lies, dark humor, and deadly consequences await within the pages of Yellowface. With its totally immersive first-person voice, Kuang’s novel is timely, razor-sharp, and eminently readable. Register to join the conversation!\n\nAbout the Author: Rebecca F. Kuang is the award-winning, #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Poppy War trilogy, Babel: An Arcane History, and Yellowface. A Marshall Scholar, she has an MPhil in Chinese Studies from Cambridge and an MSc in Contemporary Chinese Studies from Oxford; she is now pursuing a PhD in East Asian Languages and Literatures at Yale, where she studies diaspora, contemporary Chinese literature, and Asian American literature.\n\nQuestions?

The film will be a documentary hybrid, drawing on Betty's extensive photo archive and footage shot with her over more than four years, but it will also include dramatic recreations with actors to depict pivotal moments in her life that were never documented. It centers on a secret she had kept for more than 50 years: her life as a singer-songwriter during the 1960s–70s, when she wrote autobiographical songs to process her experiences as the first Black family to move across the color line into Walnut Creek when it was racially segregated. Film director Bryan Gibel, who originally planned to document the story of Reid’s Records, encouraged her to bring out taped recordings of her music that had been buried in the back of a closet. He was blown away by their quality and shifted gears. Over the past six years he and his crew have been working with Betty and her family members to bring this documentary to completion while she can still enjoy it.\n\nThe evening's free program will include a 20-minute preview sample of the film; Q & A with director Bryan Gibel and other members of the team, including Betty's granddaughter Alyana Reid; and information about the crowdfunding campaign to support finishing the film. With luck, Betty herself will join us for at least part of the program.\n\nThe Zoom link for this online event will be emailed to you.\n\nFor more info about the film, please visit www.signmynametofreedom.com.

Comprised of intimate vignettes that take us through the author’s life journey as a youth in the late 1960s, a single mother, and a champion of Native nations, this book offers a fresh understanding of how poetry functions as an expression of purpose, spirit, community, and memory.\n\nHarjo insists the most meaningful poetry is birthed through cracks in history from what is broken and unseen. At the crossroads of this brokenness, she calls us to watch and listen for the songs of justice for all those America has denied. This is an homage to the power of words to defy erasure—to inscribe the story, again and again, of who we have been, who we are, and who we can be.\n\nAbout the Author: In 2019, Joy Harjo was appointed the 23rd United States Poet Laureate, the first Native American to hold the position and only the second person to serve three terms in the role. Harjo’s nine books of poetry include Weaving Sundown in a Scarlett Light, An American Sunrise, Conflict Resolution for Holy Beings, How We Became Human: New and Selected Poems, and She Had Some Horses. She is also the author of two memoirs, Crazy Brave and Poet Warrior, which invites us to travel along the heartaches, losses, and humble realizations of her “poet-warrior” road. She has edited several anthologies of Native American writing including When the Light of the World was Subdued, Our Songs Came Through — A Norton Anthology of Native Nations Poetry, and Living Nations, Living Words, the companion anthology to her signature poet laureate project. Her many writing awards include the 2022 Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award, the 2019 Jackson Prize from Poets & Writers, the Ruth Lilly Prize from the Poetry Foundation, the 2015 Wallace Stevens Award from the Academy of American Poets, and the William Carlos Williams Award from the Poetry Society of America. She is a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets, Board of Directors Chair of the Native Arts & Cultures Foundation, and is artist-in-residence for the Bob Dylan Center. A renowned musician, Harjo performs with her saxophone nationally and internationally; her most recent album is I Pray For My Enemies. She lives in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\n* T his is an online event hosted by the Library Speakers Consortium.
