        "text": "Watching \"The Far by Faith,\" I learned that the journey of African-Americans has been one of tremendous challenges, but also of faith and perseverance. The story that particularly moved me was that of Imam Wallace D. Mohammed, because he had the faith and courage to follow his true beliefs, even when it meant turning his back on his family. And in the end he built a spiritual community that has meaning for thousands of people. I actually never knew that most African-American Muslims are not part of the Nation of Islam.\n\nBeing a \"PK\" (pastor's kid), I grew up with certain expectations of \"faith,\" \"spirituality,\" and \"religion.\" In my twenties, I left my little bubble of protection (my parent's home) and was faced with the bigger realities of life. While there is obviously no comparison to the stories of oppression and discrimination depicted in the \"Faith\" series, I experienced racism and sexism and I often felt lost. I began to question God, I abandoned my religion and tuned my back on spirituality.\n\nNow, in my thirties, I've learned that with the help of my spiritual community family, friends and others who share my faith, I can better face the daily challenges of being a Latina woman. The \"This Far by Faith\" series reminded me how important that community is in order to overcome obstacles. Unfortunately, I think a lot of people in the US don't want to talk about faith in this way because it forces them to confront the fact that there is still racism in this country, and we still need our faith to overcome it.\n\nI watched on PBS 6/24/03.\n\nI never realized that there was freedom of slaves to worship ( even though it was called secret meetings).\n\nI'm sorry if this comes out to seem offensive to ANYONE, but if America is about freedom, this informed me that there was a straight point trying to be made to white people in slave times that they were the true Christians and their faith was to be recognized as the only way.\n\nIsn't 'OUR' God everyone's God? Countries have fought for years over such things.\n\nI am a woman who has challenges everyday to try and fit into a world of men( black, white, pink, blue,?) But I am free to worship my Lord!!!!! And He will provide . I would like to see a series on how Africa was constructed and why people who beleive in the true teachings of African faith are staying where they have to struggle in this country and not desiring/are they allowed?/and why not going to the place that gives them comfort. I want to just see us all be equal. I quess my whole point is...why continue to stir up what should be old news? To get rid of prejudice, I believe you must get rid of reports from groups that stress color, but only report human conditions. I know my spelling is bad! LOL\n\nIn my opinion, the struggle for identity continues. Much of our current struggle is within our own race. Many Blacks have lost focus. No longer do we strive for the ultimate goal of salvation. We have become side tracted by our own selfish motives to please our own super egos. The desire to become rich and powerful has taken priority over the immediate needs of our fellow brothers and sisters. To do the right thing in our religious community has taken a back seat to celebrating our leaders with large banquets in there honor. Our black communities have taken ten steps backwards, simply because we never really adopted the true concept of the American dream.Certainly we can vote, eat out, go to schools and colleges of choice etc., but what is the Black man or woman's American Dream? The church has always been a meeting place for blacks, but today many black churches are absent of black men and women. When churches do meet in conferences, the main focus is to raise money. There is no true measureable, proactive or intervention programs greared to teaching,encouraging,training, or developing the minds of young black men or women.\n\nMy personal goal is to plant seeds by sharing my skills with other Americans of all races in an effort to bridge gaps. Racism have caused black men and white men to miss out on the beauty of what it truly means to be an American. Black and White churches need to work together to bridges many gaps in our community.\n\n\"This Far by Faith\" is an exciting and informative program. I do have a few problems. For example, Henry Ward Beecher was not a Methodist minister. I also seriously doubt the anti-Black quote attributed to him. Among other things, he raised money from his pulpit to buy 'Beecher Bibles' - rifles - to arm anti-slavery people in Kansas, etc. His sister, of course, was Harriet Beecher Stowe. He was an avid abolitionist. There seems to be a tendency in some African-American circles to want to paint friends as enemies. Why is that? It merits a serious psychological study. I also felt some serious omissions - e.g., the establishment of most original Black colleges in the south by northern churches.\n\nA few of the commentators show evidence of reverse racism, understandable and perhaps forgiveable, but unfortunate and a bit alienating. Other things might have been noted, such as the schism between southern and northern Methodists over slavery. The countless northern whites who gave up their lives in battle as they sang 'John Brown's body', including ancestors of mine. Many Union soldiers were fired up by the issue of slavery as much as there seems to be an effort to minimize that reality in recent years. My great-grandfather volunteered at age 41, leaving his wife and six children on their Vermont farm, because of that. He named one of his sons, Sumner, after Congressman Sumner of MA, a major and early abolitionist. And I could go on and on and on.\n\nI guess I have some resentment of efforts to forget such brave and devoted people, seemingly only because they were white. A great-uncle all but starved to death in a southern POW camp, a member of the 1st VT Cav who was captured in MD while chasing Lee after Gettysburg. Their sacrifices should not be ignored or minimized.\n\nBut, back to my first point. It's an exciting and informative series and I look forward to the next four hours.\n\nFrom my viewpoint, I see .This Far by Faith. as an introduction to the spirituality of black America and the laying of the foundation of these United States. For me, the .Negro Spirituals. represent the pivotal point of the Faith of black America, and to some degree, of all America.\n\nMy fore-parents, the Children of Captivity and Slavery, were not allowed to bring anything with them from Africa beside their body, soul and spirit. Their bodies were enslaved and abused in the interest of free labour, while with their souls and spirits they lamented to God. Within the lyrics of the Negro Spirituals, may be found the identity, history, culture and spirituality of the slaves. Accompanied by a rhythmic dance, along with the clapping of hands and the tapping or stomping of feet, the slaves made their plight known and offered up their testimony against their oppressor.\n\nAt a time when the Supreme Court seems to recognize that the issue of .racism. is still a factor in our society, and that there is a need for racial tolerance and reconciliation, this PBS series could be very helpful. It is common knowledge that black people are very spiritual. By this I mean that there seems to be a greater sense of spiritual awareness (strength) among individuals possessing a high concentration of melanin. It is important to note that this .blackness. is everywhere throughout our universe, and is necessary for its harmony and efficiency.\n\nTo some of us, the physical world is but a shadow of the spiritual; yet it is a high honour to possess the ability to communicate between the two worlds with ease. Music and dance represent the language of an efficient creation, meaning that special ability of the creature to communicate with his/her Creator. And because it is such a high level communion, ordinary words cannot be used, indeed sometimes no words at all. This is the strength of the Chosen People, realized by the power of our Covenant, even enduring the affliction of our captivity. It is important to note that full appreciation of the Negro Spirituals is a very subjective matter. It is not an academic exercise, but it requires that the individual be in one accord with the same spiritual format in which the Negro Spirituals were expressed.This is true of any spiritual expression. However, these Spirituals are not only for black people. They represent an extremely significant source of early American history and culture for ALL people. In fact, the Negro Spirituals should be a required study in all schools, where American history and culture is taught. There is no other way that a full and accurate appreciation of all that is America may be realized.\n\nDr. Michael Hinds HEALING A NATION THE ISRAELITE HERITAGE CENTER ATLANTA, GA israel@mindspring.com\n\nI approached this program with much speculation and some hope. But I came away highly disappointed. What I saw merely perpetuated what people want to think about blacks here in the United States. What I mean is the reference to muslims and Islam in relation to W.D Mohammed and the black \"moslems\". Though it was mentioned in the beginning that many slaves were indeed muslim, the later references to Islam in the United States was limited to just those who were followers of W.D Mohammed. As a true muslim, I am offended by that reference. If you were to truly delve into the religions of a people, I think you should have also considered the many, many black people who are muslim and do not consider W.D. Mohammed credible in his assertion of Islam. I think that misperception, or oversight, needs to be corrected and your program did nothing in the way of correcting it. This assumption also perpetuates the ideology that black \"moslems\" are racist and intolerant and hate whites, etc. It also perpetuates the idea tha blacks who are muslim are poor, etc. Obviously, those are false and need to be corrected. You had an opportunity to do so, and yet did not.\n\n\"The faith of the human spirit\" that knows no creed or color as your program said, can be found in Islam. It was never a religion intolerant of others, but always taught tolerance and kindness. Many assume that muslims are all middle eastern, from Saudi Arabia, etc. But what a lot of people don' know is that there are so many Africans who are muslim, maybe even more than in the middle east. Why do you think Malcolm X became a true muslim and changed his belief about racism. He saw a religion that truly accepted people of all colors and nationalities. For those people who were offended when they found that their ancestors might have been muslim, you should consider how that makes you look; intolerant,\n\nFriends, I watched the segment on Faith tonight, June 26, and sobbed. The beauty, authenticity and poignancy of what the participants shared and how the journey was recorded and presented touched me beyond words. And I thank you, for in my resonance with the unspeakable pain of the black history I was made a better human being.\n\nI do understand, but I regret nevertheless that at the end of the Jo urney there were only black participants left, for it seems that the 'gap' between the black and white people was not bridged, or healed. I am white yet I must tell you that I am totally on the side of black people when there is any injustice in how they are treated. I always side with what is good and just and for the highest good of all concerned.... and I am sure that there must be many other white people who feel that way. Though slavery is certainly one of the worst crimes that one can commit against another human being, along with physical harm, murder, rape, racism and other forms of abuse we humans engage in, IT IS A MANIFESTATION OF A DEPRAVED HUMAN MIND AND HEART. I am white woman born in Croatia during the communist rule, who's lived much of her adult life outside of my native country (U.S., Australia, Italy and Canada). Upon seeing the program, I would like to express two regrets. One, that the Pilgrimage had not been more widely publicized and comprised many more people of all races, for the slavery of blacks is a deep wound that all humanity needs to heal, for aspects of it are still being perpetuated today throughout the world. The 'oppressor' has as much, if not more to heal than the 'oppressed', though the buried pain of the black people is immenseBeing a \"PK\" (pastor's kid), I grew up\n\nIt is clear that the one whose wound is the deepest will seek healing first, but I feel that hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. need to heal the issues that gave rise to slavery and that still sustain some degree of racism. It is my hope and desire that the next time such a noble healing journey is undertaken, you wil l invite many descendants of slave owners to join you, so they can weep over their ancestors horrendous wrongdoing, and through our collective and joint tears, may we all be healed. I send blessings of Love and Peace to all.....\n\nThe series was beautifully rich in penetrating the essence of individual journeys. However there could always be more pepper in the pot...I am an African American Jew and I belong to a Sephardic (Middle Eastern-Mediterranean) Orthodox congregation, I also teach Hebrew school there and another shul or synagogue. There is a growing volume of Black Jews...where were we? We are Black Hebrews, Black converts, Blacks who are born Jewish, Blacks who have been Jewish since the beginning of Jewish civilization and we've contributed to and been a part of the American spiritual landscape...Also, given my connections to the Yoruba and Akan communities, where was the discussion about their affect on empowering the mentalities and raising the consciousness of Black America?\n\nThere are 5 million followers of TAR--Traditional African Religions in the U.S. Five minutes wasn't enough to explore how Yoruba--which was called \"lost to enslavement and then recovered\" along with Vodun/Sevi Lwa, Lukumi, Palo, Akan, and honoring the Sengambian Raab have revolutionized how African-Americans have truly sought roots. In my case, as someone who draws on his Afro-Christian childhood, learns from and prays with followers of Traditional African religions, had Muslim mentors and follows the path of Sephardic Judaism and Kabbalah--I needed to see how different African-Americans were bridging gaps of faith with each other, healing universal riffs, coming to terms with identity, faith, and self and group \"location.\" I needed to see how the largely un-Christian formerly enslaved community assumed a Christian identity meanwhile covering older ancestral practices that were hidden from the \"mainstream\" world.\n\nWhere was the commentary on the rise in Black humanism as a response to spiritual dissolution? I came to the series not hoping or anticipating \"everything\", but that the series would as the Yoruba say, wa si wara--search continually and ceaselessly, that it would as you say in Hebrew, make \"hiddush,\" make a new idea about people of Africa descent in the New World and spirituality? Its not enough to talk about African-American faith, it is more to the point to talk about doing G-d's work and finding ways in which we embody the benefit of that work. Amen.\n\nI can oly imagine what trials and tribulations the creative team had to endure just to see a project like this to its completion. But as difficult as it had to have been, this was a story that had to be told in this way in order that many people could see these images and hear these stories.\n\nI am a lover of the documentary as a medium for getting relevant information of substance to people as an educational tool. I was greatly moved by the stories and by the different spiritual journeys that were represented. While I missed the first 3 hours, I did see the second three. I eagerly await a rebroadcast so that I can experience fully the vision of this project. I applaud the PBS, the Faith Project, and Blackside Productions for having the vision, courage and faith themselves to see this project through to its completion. With the state that our world is in, we need to understand how fundamental our faith is to our survival as a people now more than ever.\n\nI want to share that one of my greatest joys was di scovering and hearing the Rev. Prathia Hall talk about her journey. There was a presence with this woman that made me feel that I have known her for for a long time. My sadness was learning that she had passed before I could ever meet her. Her words of benediction from her pulpit and as she closes the final sigment still rings in my ears and resonanates on my heart. Oh what a brilliant light we have lost.\n\nThank you June Cross, for this wonderful experience. I pray that God will continue to use you and your gifts and graces to touch so many people, in ways that even you may not have thought possible. May God continue to bless you for what you have done, and for what you will do.\n\nWilliam Brown/div>\n\nUrbandale, IA\n\nIt is sad that so many people are using fear to further their agenda of hate, seperation, and divsion of people by monetary and materialistic levels. But when you really think about it, it is their fear of what the future might be that scares them. they fear that the advantage they now have will be wiped out. I mean how can you say we are fighting for freedom and democracy while at the same time attempt to abolish it here? I did not see the special, but I'll put how I see things in a poem.\n\n\"A LINE IN THE SAND\"\n\nHORROR, EXPLOSIONS, FLASHES OF LIGHT, NOT IMAGES OF DREAMS BUT VISIONS OF FRIGHT.\n\nBEFORE OUR VERY EYES THESE EVENTS HAVE OCCURED. HELPLESSLY WATCHING WE CANNOT STILL OUR NERVES.\n\nWOMEN AND MEN GASP AS CHILDREN SHIVER, HUDDLED IN OUR THOUGHTS WE KNOW IT'S NOT OVER.\n\nFOR THESE ARE THE TIMES WE LIVE IN I FRET. THESE ACTS OF BARBARISM IS NOTHING NEW I GUESS.\n\nFOR PEOPLE OF COLOR, THESE IMAGES WE'VE KNOWN, NOT FROM FOREIGN INVADERS BUT OUR VERY OWN.\n\nNOW ONCE AGAIN WE.RE EXPECTED TO ANTY UP EN MASSE. TO FIGHT FOR A PRECIOUS FREEDOM WE'VE NEVER QUITE HAD.\n\nWE WILL RALLY AROUND THE FLAG AND SACRAFICE WITH ALL, YET WHEN OUR BLOOD IS SHED WILL THAT OTHER FLAG FALL?\n\nWILL DISCRIMINATION AND RACISM STINK AS AN ABSESSED TOOTH? AS MARTYRS OF TALK RADIO NOURISH ITS VERY ROOT.\n\nDOES ALL THIS HOOPLA OF UNITED WE STAND, KEEP GREEDY CEO'S FROM PILLAGING THE LAND?<\n\nWHERE EMPLOYEE LOYALTIES ARE SWEPT OUT THE DOOR, TO FEED THE CALLOUS STOCKHOLDER.S GREED FOR MORE.\n\nTHERE ARE MANY EVIL FORCES WE NOW MUST FACE, SHIRTS AND TIES HAVE REPLACED THE SHEETS ONCE EMBRACED.\n\nFOR IF YOU REALLY MEAN WE FACE THE FUTURE TOGETHER, WHEN THE VOTES ARE COUNTED ARE YOU SURE OURS MATTER?\n\nWE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO CHANGE THE HISTORY OF BOOKS, TO SHOW THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ALL IS HOW IT SHOULD LOOK.\n\nSWITCH THE CLOUT OF OLD MONEY AND THE IDEALS OF NEW FOOLS, SO THEY.LL KNOW MONEY IS NOT A RELIGION BUT MERELY A TOOL.\n\nFOR YOU SEE FAITH IS CELEBRATED IN MANY FORMS, SOLIDIFY THE FOUNDATION FROM WHICH IT WAS BORN.\n\nT\n\nHERE ARE MANY MORE REASONS TO TAKE A STAND. WHERE WILL YOU DRAW YOUR LINE IN THE SAND?\n\nI prepared myself early each day to see \"TFBF\".The title itself has cosmic proportions,I felt I was in for a treat and PBS did not disappoint me.For a TV program in 2003,it was a \"mountaintop experience.\"I will absorb it again!I learned from a preacher that if I was to survive this century,I had to find what he called a \"though faith\".I am still on that journey.It is a continuos one.You surprised me when you did not include my ancestor,Brother Richard Allen.Years ago,historians told me MrAllen started the AME church in Philly because white folks ran him and others out.So he got his own.And I expected more on Harriet Tubman,Bethune,Attucks and others like that.Nevertheless,my biggest challenge as an individual and a member of the human race is accepting mediocrity.I am restless yet relentless in my struggle.I grapple with it everyday.\n\nFinally,I thank God for Mrs Lydia Jane McNeill,my maternal grandmother,born out of slavery circa 1898.Arrived in Baltimore,Md from Robeson County,NC after s elling 300 acres and Model T to come north to the Promised Land.She showed me,first hand,how to make a way out of noway.She would help family and strangers.Faith is a powerful tool.Other resources include Bennie McGee,Minnie Washington,MrPurnell,DrsCharlesDSanders,GossieHHudson,SamuelLBanks,BenjaminQuarles,AdaMoody,LeonHolsey,and my mother,MrsCoraleeBostick.I so love them and many more.Faith is not talked about because it offers freedom and independence,something Coan talked about.It allows God to operate in the human heart.And then it demands ACTION.America is not ready for prime time,not yet.\n\nIn closing, as I viewed \"TFBF\" I remembered my sojourns to Yuroba village in Buford,SC and when I touched down in Dakar,Senegal to visit Goree Island.I stood at \"The Door of No Return\" myself.It is an awesome feeling.It requires you to pay homage to your ancestors.I must believe there is some good in the worst because of my confidence in God.Thanks again.\n\nHello Everyone...Thank you for tuning in to this most amazing documentary...and Thank you to the creators! I too am a fellow Interfaith Pilgrim Walker. I helped to organize in the beginning and then I was fortunate enough to walk with the grims in Louisianna, and the Caribbean. And continue to help once I returned home. I am blessed to still be in contact with some of the most amazing and Faith filled human spirits out there. They have and continue to teach me everyday, simply by existing in this world and living in the unconditional love, light, exuberance and truth that they are, that they have come from and that they are continuing in their expansion of our human existence. They are guided truth seekers by their ancestors and have taught me to learn from mine and continue the path of human justice, love, honesty, and rights that are unconditionally equal to all of us. Hello my fellow brothers and sisters...\"seeing\" you all again was so fullfilling to my heart and I'm grateful for all the emotions th s documentary has stired within my being. I miss the presence of you all and I thank you for contributing in this every lasting journey of healing, faith and expansion. In much love and blessings, Amy E. Norman\n\nI reverted to Al-Islam in 1975. This was during the period when the Nation of Islam was being transitioned towards orthodox Islam by Imam W.Deen Mohammed. Adolescence for me was around 1965. And coming of age thru the mid 70's, I got my dose of black is beautiful, and say it loud, I'm black and proud,from the black pop culture. However, approaching adulthood, I became keenly aware of the social,political and economic status of the black race and how it measured when compared to the other ethnic groups. Though the reason for such disparaged status was widely known by the black populace, the process needed to improve it was not. Hence, the psychology of the Nation of Islam proved to be very useful.\n\nCoupled with Imam Mohammed's ability to debunk the mythologies taught in the Nation of Islam, and with what I'm totally convinced is his sincere desire to guide his community to Allah, the Qur'an, and Prophet Muhammed, a natural muslim community evolution is occuring within the larger black community and wit h universal appeal and support to and for greater America and the world.\n\nThe significance of this is that an evolving community with a muslim identity and an Islamic character being cultivated to filter out the ethnic and cultural influence that are many times passed to the world as being part and parcel to Al-Islam, will help defeat the lingering identity problem for the black community once and for all in America.\n\nWithout a doubt, there are many African Americans who are muslims, and have never ever been associated with the past or current efforts of Imam W.Deen Mohammed. The inclusion of his story was certainly apropos to what is recorded as the African American Faith Journey.\n\nUsually when faith is discussed in America, Islam is relegated to the pronouncements of Min. Farrakan, or to the nationalistic drivel being advanced by an immigrant who feels there's a bone to be picked with America.\n\nI applaud your honest attempt to outline the Faith Journey of Blacks in America.\n\nPlease give us more.\n\nI was happy this information was sent to me. It was not by accident.Ever since I was eleven, I searched for a religion that I could embrace. Today, I am a agnostic, and this information helps me, to not feel guilty about feeling this way.\n\nOur churches and public leaders do not emphasize enough our history. If they did, we could make an educated choice. I now understand why we as an origin of people feel so strongly about Christ. Acceptance is as powerful as the message you send. Our children must know the history of Africans and their journey to a new land, and why they have adopted christainity. The Bible has been rewritten hundreds of times, denominations created from the divisions of leaders disagreeing and moving forward in thier beliefs. Constantly separating us as a national origin of people. Because we are Americans with a land to identify and the history of those before our ancestors arrival, we desperately need not to forget ours. Instead, we condemn organizations that want to enact our history, en ertainment, such as; Brula, Amos and Andy. There is nothing shameful about our history. To be reminded of where you cameth and how you cameth, to what you've contributed is not shameful. I never heard our ancestors speak ill about seeing the face of a colored person making them laugh or out dancing and teaching one to dance and sing with passion. I participated this year in an educational program where I was invited to share my life experiences with young people from the ages of ten through thirteen. It was referred to as Intergenerational Day.\n\nI live in a self contained community where there is history of distinquished colored soldiers who serve in the civil war, Company E, and were called upon to protected the Capitol from being captured once again, this year was 1865. The community of Fort Lincoln. The school's name was changed to Thurgood Marshall, the cannon that rested in a gated area has been removed without any knowledge of the residents and homeowners. Other than the name Fort Lincoln, we have noth ng to honor the soldiers who had to drag that cannon for miles up the hill overlooking the capitol and to guard the entrance from this sector of the city. My point, the children new nothing of this history. The teachers were receptive and wanted the website for more information. The children did not know we were slaves in this country nor the inventions and contributions of our people. There were moments when I became very emotional because they did not know,and once they were prompted to respond and express their opinions about the pictures of slavery, it was rewarding to me that I made a difference that day. I do not profess to know much myself, but, I do know I made my contributions as a volunteer to intergrate the schools in the city where I was born and raised. I know that my community of educated people have become passive and content with their fine homes and cars. I know that they do not volunteer 10% of their personal time to help their community. What I do know and often hear is how well and clear y one will tell you I am a christain. In my opinion whatever you do to make contributions in a lifetime, you should start at home first, to include the community in which you live. To help preserve it, revitalize it and most importantly keep the history alive. Your history, our history. Fort Lincoln housed the colored soldiers during 1864-1865.\n\nWhere is our statue? Where is our Cannon? Where is our Hero's Plaza dedicated to these men of color and honor. My community is 95% African American and beginning to slowly change in a highly political city where votes should carry much leverage, but during election time, primary or not, only 50% vote. This is what I am ashamed to hear and take note when you see the statistics. Maybe, if we were continuously reminded like the jews never let their people forget, we could strengthen and inspire ourselves once again to rebuild the courage and kindness and generousity we shared as a people to one another, one time, long ago when we made our journey from Africa to America.\n\ni began watching the program at its end on wednesday. my six year old step-son and i were completely enthralled during the \"journey\". he asked loads of questions and we discussed why we as african-americans are diffrent complexions what sharecropping is and what it meant to our relatives. friday night i was able to watch the entire second half from W. Deen Muhammed to the \"journey\"'s conclusion.\n\nseveral things struck me about the series and the website. first i am profoundly impressed by the delicate balance of how islam and christianity were displayed and the buddist sensibilty that was shown.(side note i was very happy to see DR. Cornell West he is absolutely brilliant)Secondly as a woman whose skin is a pale shade of beige with two african american parents of similar coloring i wished the \"color\" issue had been taken on more. we forget sometimes one of the \"legacy's\" of slavery is the \"octaroon or quadroon\" coloring and myths of \"good hair\".\n\ni wish there had been a little more explor ation in how such \"le acy's\" led to intense self-hatred among our people. we still perpetuate these types of catagories on ourselves and each other. but i understand one program will not answer everyone's \"issues\". The fact that this program was so faith based helped to center the issues. I just want more truly conscious programming about or real issues with race, not just the affirmative action stories. we are multidimensional people not \"shananay\" or anyother characature. we are a people of faith but not just two faiths we are buddists and some of us freethinkers experiment in many ways of practicing our faith and giving GOD/JEHOVA/ALLAH/UNIVERSAL SPIRIT all praises.\n\nSO THANK YOU for showing several facets of who African American people are.\n\nAbsolutely wonderful series. This far by faith not only proved to be educational but also thought provoking and challeninging. I was especially intrigued by what James Cone had to say, being a Womanist Theologian and having read quite a bit of his work, especially hearing his view of the Black Church and its role in the Civil Rights Movement - a faith based, grass roots movement that made America stop and take notice is powerful to say the least.\n\nI was particularly empowered as I heard Cone speak about the Church taking the message to the world. This indeed reminded me of the fact that the Church still has the significant and monumental task of bringing its message to all people.\n\nThere are issues facing us even today to which the Church in general, the Black Church in particular must be the redeeming change agent who speaks loud and clear where there is injustice and oppresion. Just as the Civil rights Movement as a faith based movement highlighted, the Church must move outside of its four walls and speak in the prophetic voice declaring our God to be a God of righteousness and justice, and where ever these evil forces are present, we the people of god will not remain in our ceiled houses unconcerned but move and speak with the voice of authority. We will speak to any and all issues whether they be social, political, economical, humanitarian, theoloogical, just to name a few.\n\nWas greatful to see such a presentation of the spirituality of black folks. The diversity was absolutely amazing. For someone who was not as familiar with Islam, I found myself intrigued by some of the comments made by some of the persons featured on the presentation which made me realize -- as I felt -- that persons within the Christian and Islamic traditions have much in common if only we would take the time to listen to each other's story.\n\nBy the end of the series, I was ecstatic as I realized what faith meant to these various people, how they realized their faith, and when it seemed that all hope was lost, they still had their faith. Even their is not much civil unrest as in the days of my parents and grandparents, I am made aware of the prevailing sense of nihilism and narcissism which exists in our communities and our nation. Yet the presentation was challenging in how people -- in spite of their conditions and circumstances -- dared to believe in what appeared by rational and reasonable stand ards as impossible.\n\nThanks for including James Cone in your presentation. He indeed is an insightful fellow who is thought provoking and engaging.\n\nI personally want to thank my sister, Melissa, for the e-mail informing me that the program was going to be aired on the Public Broadcasting Station.\n\nPeace!\n\nITS IS A CONTINUITY THAT BISHOP MC NEAL TURNER SAID GOD IS A NEGRO, FATHER DIVINE SAID HE IS GOD. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD SAID GOD IS A MAN. THE FIVE PERCENTERS GREET EACH OTHER AS GOD. AND MYSELF. NOW IT HAS BEEN SUPPLANTED IN BLACK MALES MIND TO TURN THE WORD GOD AROUND AND CALL EACH OTHER DOG. ALSO BLACK PEOPLE AFTER SLAVERY REQUESTED LAND. THE NATION OF ISLAM, CHURCH OF THE BLACK MADONNA AS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY CALLED. THE NUWAUBIANS, OYOTUNJI VILLAGE AND PERHAPS OTHERS PURCHASED LAND EVEN IN THIS MODERN ERA, NOT TO MENTION THE BLACK HEBREW ISRAELITES WHO MIGRATED TO ISRAEL. SOJOURNER TRUTH AND OTHER MADE THEIR THOUGHTS KNOWN THAT BLACK PEOPLE OF AMERICA MUST HAVE LAND OF THEIR OWN. THE SOLUTION I SEE IS THAT THEIR SHOULD BE ANOTHER MIGRATION OF BLACK PEOPLE, THIS TIME FROM THE NORTH TO THE SOUTH AND OCCUPY SEVEN STATES IN OVERWHELMING NUMBERS, NAMELY FLORIDA, GEORGIA, ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA AND TENNESSEE. THEN WE WILL ELECT 7 GOVERNORS AND 14 SENATORS. WE WILL T HEN CLAIM THAT SPACE S OUR NATION.\n\nAS FAR AS RELIGION GO, ARABS CAN HAVE THEIR ISLAM. EVEN THROUGH THERE IS MUCH GOOD IN THE \"HOLY BOOKS OF THE KORAN, AND MUCH KNOWLEDGE STILL UNDER VEIL IN THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE, WHICH IS MISINTERPRETED BY LYING, CONNIVING, POWER MAD BLACK SLAVE PREACHER. WE CAN USE THE BIBLE BY REAL TRUTH TEACHER TO HELP EXPLAIN THE HUMAN CONDITION OF TODAY. HOWEVER THE WORDS IN VERSE OF THE UNIVERSE IS THE GREATEST BOOK TO READ. FOR THAT IS THE TRUE WORDS. THE SUN, OCEAN, EARTH, MAN HIMSELF. LIFE ITSELF IS A BOOK. MAN HAS BEEN AROUND MILLIONS OF YEARS. DO YOU THINK THAT THE TRUE RELIGIONS WAS ONLY REVEALED A FEW THOUSAND YEARS AGO. THERE HAS BEEN WORLDS UNKNOWN. WHAT ELIJAH MUHAMMAD UNVEILS IS MIND BLOWING. TO SAY THAT CAUCASIANS WAS MADE BY US. IN LIGHT OF THE NEW SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION OF CLONING, ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION AND SO ON. DOGS ARE WORSHIP IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH IS RUN BY THE POWER OF THE DOG. EVEN THE BIBLE SAID TO BEWARE OF DOGS. IT IS COMFORTING TO KNOW THAT WE WERE MENTALLY DEAD AND STILL MANAGE TO HOLD OUR OWN.\n\nJUST THINK WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE IN OUR RESURRECTION OF OUR RIGHT MIND. IT IS ALMOST UNIMAGINABLE. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT OUR WORLD IS ON THE HORIZON. OUR RELIGION OF ASAR, AMUN-RA, GEB, NUT, ISIS, HATHOR, HORUS, SETH, NETHY, ANUBIS AND SO ON IS SCIENTIFIC, HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN SUPPLANTED YEARS AGO WITH CRAZINESS SO THAT THE ESTEEMING OF ANIMALS WAS NOT PART OF THE ORIGINAL RELIGION. ALSO THERE IS LOT OF TALK ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE IN AMERICA DESCENDING FROM WEST AFRICA. HOWEVER, THERE WERE MILLIONS OF ORIGINAL \"EGYPTIANS IN EGYPT \" BEFORE THE INVASIONS OF THE WHITE \"ARABS\", TURKS, ROMANS, GREEKS AND SO ON. BUT THE POPULATION OF THE ORIGINAL \"EGYPTIANS\" DWINDLED DOWN TO A FEW MILLIONS AFTER THEIR INVASION. WHERE DID THEY GO. WELL, MANY ENDED UP IN THE AMERICAS.\n\nI thank you for this journey I pray that every black man, woman and child will have a chance to see the wonderful journey. And If our black people would take the time to understand what the black,s had and still have to go though we would not be so quick to jump in the bed with whites. We as a people will never have are as long as we disrespect ourselfs take our riches that we make and give it back to whites. Black men as well as black woman need to see if we don't get it together, we will never be as one. They did not like you then(whites) and they don't like you now.After all our forefathers and mothers went though and all the money we make today we still feel we have the whites appoval in order for blacks to feel a belonging. It seems that we will never get it.BLACK'S YOUR FOREFATHERS HUNG ON TREES just for looking at a so called white and now that you have a little money and a degree it's ok to sleep with the whites. We have also been brainwashed in thinking that we can't help who we fall in love wi h this is the biggest lie we could ever been told. We as Black need to get a grip, Please wake up and share the journey."
