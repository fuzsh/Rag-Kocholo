I am a reggae artist, so I am definitely keeping track of the reggae playlists and I also just followed yours.\n\nI have one reggae playlist that I compiled consisting of a mix of old and new reggae since there seems to be so many 20 and 30 year old songs dominating the playlists. There are still new reggae albums coming out like mine, which will drop on 20.8. It is called \"Rise Up\".\n\nI compiled a playlist called \"Chilled Reggae Grooves\". If you would like to subscribe, please do so. Here is the link: https://open.spotify.com/user/alansteward/playlist/76hABWmKO1G4PckGCjazS2?si=takXHvbhS3S6lj3P_9qhuA\n\nTake care,\n\nAlan"
