Background[]

Far East Movement met Justin Bieber through Snoop Dogg at the Billboard Music Awards. Snoop Dogg introduced them to Justin Bieber. They wanted to make a club song that bridges the gap between the young audience and their audience. When the song came out, Far East Movement played it for RedFoo from LMFAO and he wanted to do a remix.[1]

Music video[]

A music video to accompany the release of "Live My Life" was first released onto YouTube on April 5, 2012 at a total length of four minutes and forty-three seconds. The video however, does not feature Justin Bieber, who is featured on the song. Redfoo of LMFAO appears on the video, even though he is not featured on the original song, but is on the remix.

Far East Movement sent Bieber one of those party-favor cards saying, 'You are invited to the Far East Movement/Justin Bieber video shoot,' but he was working on his thing so he couldn't make it.[2]

They are seen throughout the video touring and dancing through the streets of Amsterdam in the Party Rock bus, was filmed in the Netherlands. They also perform a synchronized dance routine in a flash mob-style. Dutch singer Eva Simons cameos in the video, seen entering the party bus midway through the video, as well as Dutch DJs Sidney Samson, Sick Individuals and Quintino.
