Claudia Livia Julia was believed to be conceived around 13 BC and died on 31 AD, was the only daughter of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor and sister of the Roman Emperor Claudius and general Germanicus, and in this manner the fatherly auntie of the head Caligula and maternal extraordinary close relative of sovereign Nero. She was named after her grandma, Augustus' wife Livia Drusilla, and generally known by her family epithet Livilla ("little Livia"). She was conceived after Germanicus and before Claudius.

She was twice hitched to the potential successor in the Julio-Claudian dynasty, first to Augustus's grandson Gaius Caesar (died 4 AD) and later to Tiberius's child Drusus the Younger (passed on 23 AD). Professedly, she helped her significant other Sejanus in harming her spouse and died not long after Sejanus tumbled from power in 31 AD.
