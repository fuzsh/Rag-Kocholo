        "text": "“When Tiberius died and Gaius succeeded in March of 37, Agrippina’s fortunes underwent a complete change.”\n\n– Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars​\n\nsyllabus\n\n​Key features and developments, including:\n\nrole during the reign of Gaius (Caligula), including exile\n\nrole during the reign of Claudius\n\nrole and changing relationship with Nero during his reign\n\nrelationships with other members of the imperial court: Seneca, Burrus and imperial freedmen\n\nbasis of her power and influence, patronage\n\nimpact of her personality on her roles and public image\n\nattempts on her life\n\ndeath: motives, manner and impact of death\n\nrole during the reign of Gaius (Caligula), including exile\n\nAfter her family’s persecution under Tiberius, Gaius’s principate in 37CE signalled a new beginning for Agrippina. Unfortunately Gaius’s reign is perhaps the most badly documented principate of the Julio-Claudians with Tacitus’ lost books consisting of his reign. Instead we must rely on Suetonius and archaeological evidence to draw our conclusions.\n\n​\n\nThe first few months of 37CE were heralded as a new golden era, and Caligula immediately sought to shore up his position by promoting his Julian lineage through especially his mother and sisters. Also he began eliminating his rivals; Gemellus, the grandson of Tiberius, was the first victim in the family and the ancient sources point to many more deaths. Gaius had no son of his own to ensure the dynasty, and he was clearly promoting his sisters as possible mothers of the future princeps. Of these, Drusilla was his favorite. Agrippina and her sisters received unparalleled honours in Gaius’ court. They were given the rights of the Vestal Virgins such as the freedom to view public games from the upper seats in the stadium. Coins were issued depicting images of Caligula and his sisters. Roman coins like these were never issued beforehand. The coins depicted Caligula on one side and his sisters on the opposite. Caligula added his sister's names in loyalty oaths and consular motions. ​\n\nHe caused the names of his sisters to be included in all oaths: \"And I will not hold myself and my children dearer than I do Gaius and his sisters\"; as well as in the propositions of the consuls: \"Favour and good fortune attend Gaius Caesar and his sisters.\"\n\nSuetonius The Twelve Caesars ‘Life of Gaius’\n\nBITHYNIA. Apamea. Drusilla, Julia and Agrippina, sisters of Caligula (AD 37-41). Æ 33mm (13.35 gm, 12h). Struck AD 38. DIVÆ DRVSILLAE (Ds reverted) IVLIAEA AGRIPP-INAE, three female busts, draped, of Drusilla (left, facing right), Julia (center, facing) and Agrippina Jr. (right, facing left) / AGRIPPINA • C • CAESARIS • AVG • GERMANICI • MATER C I C, Agrippina Sr. seated left, veiled, holding patera in right hand\n\nGaius fell seriously ill at some time in 37. He appears to have left his sister Drusilla as his heir- thus leaving her the empire in some capacity, many have suggested this is a symptom of his ‘madness’ and that he intended to leave the role of princep to a woman! Susan Wood has suggested that within the context of Gaius having no heir, and having divorced Drusilla from her husband Longinus and married her to Gaius’s friend and favourite Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, he was making the only move available to him to appoint an heir. Wood thus relates that Lepidus would effectively be princep, his role legitimised through Drusilla. Without a son his only choices would be the sons of his sisters, and according to Barrett and Wood, Agrippina had not yet birthed Lucius (who was born on the 15th December 37AD). Again, Wood argues that Gaius’ choice would have to be one of his sisters' husbands as his heir, and by all accounts Ahenobarbus would have been a disastrous choice.\n\nThe motive behind Caligula’s public emphasis on his sisters was certainly to honour what was left of the family of Agrippina and Germanicus, and probably also to prepare the public to accept a child born to any of the four siblings as the heir to the principate...Had Drusilla outlived her brother and become his heir, as he intended at the time of his severe illness in 37, it would surely have been her husband M. Aemilius Lepidus, who ruled the empire...Caligula probably wished his immediate successor to be Marcus Lepidus rather than Agrippina’s first husband Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus...\n\n​Susan Wood\n\nAfter Gaius’ sickness in 37 the ancient sources tell us that he had an incestuous relationship with all of his sisters.\n\nHe lived in habitual incest with all his sisters, and at a large banquet he placed each of them in turn below him, while his wife reclined above.\n\n​Suetonius The Twelve Caesars ‘Life of Gaius’\n\nAccusations of incest between Caligula and his sisters are probably fuelled by the fact that they played the sort of public ceremonial role normally reserved for a wife.\n\nSusan Wood\n\nIn 38 Gaius’ beloved sister Drusilla died. Her death was untimely at only aged 22, and must have been a deep personal loss, as well as a dynastic disaster for Caligula, who was still childless and no yet remarried. Cassius Dio claims that Caligula remarried only a few days after Drusilla’s death suggests that he wished to lose no time in producing a son of his own. He did eventually produce a child of his own whom he legitimised in a hasty marriage to his final wife, Caesonia.\n\nexile\n\nIn 39CE Lepidus, Livilla and Agrippina were accused of being involved in a conspiracy to kill the princep. The sources are very vague about the nature of the conspiracy, often assumed because Gaius manufactured the event out of fear and suspicion. However, modern historians have come to new conclusions. ​\n\nThe rest of his sisters (Livilla & Agrippina) he did not love with so great affection, nor honour so highly, but often prostituted them to his favourites; so that he was the readier at the trial of Aemilius Lepidus to condemn them, as adulteresses and privy to the conspiracies against him; and he not only made public letters in the handwriting of all of them, procured by fraud and seduction, but also dedicated to Mars the Avenger, with an explanatory inscription, three swords designed to take his life.\n\nSuetonius The Twelve Caesars ‘Life of Gaius’ ​\n\nThe charges are likely to have had some basis, Lepidus, having come very close to imperial power only to lose his connection with the imperial family when Drusilla died, would surely have wished to marry one of the emperors other sisters, who in turn would naturally have vied to become Drusillas’ successor.\n\nSusan Wood\n\nThe involvement of Agrippina in this endeavour to re-craft a faction is significant. It indicates her total commitment to power. For her, Caligula’s folly was not a tragedy but an opportunity. Her relationship with Lepidus is important. Lepidus was close to the imperial family. In some temples his image was included with other members of the imperial family. Furthermore, Agrippina needed a male sponsor. A liaison between the two was inevitable. As Tacitus noted, her affair with Lepidus was grounded on the mutual need for power, and it was upon that rock that it shattered.\n\nBill Leadbetter, 1997, The Ambition of Agrippina the Younger\n\nThe result was that Agrippina and Livilla were exiled to the Pontian Islands and Lepidus was executed. Modern historian Baumann proposes that they intended to replace Lepidus as princep and Agrippina would be his wife, until Nero was old enough to rule. Agrippina was forced to carry the ashes of the executed Lepidus to Rome where they were scattered unceremoniously. ​\n\n​\n\nThe sister’s possessions and slaves were disposed of and associates of the conspirators were put to death. Nero was left in the care of Domitia Lepida, his fathers’ sister. Agrippina’s husband Ahenobarbus died in 40 CE. This would have left her as a rich widow, with Augustan blood and a son who was rival to the throne. Although in exile, she was next to nothing.\n\nThen his mother was banished too, and he was brought up at the house of his auntLepida almost in actual want, under two tutors, a dancer and a barber.\n\n​Suetonius The Twelve Caesars\n\nThus Agrippina’s first attempt at seizing power long predated her marriage to Claudius.\n\nBill Leadbetter, 1997, The Ambition of Agrippina the Younger​\n\nquestions\n\nWhat honours did Agrippina receive during her brothers’ principate?\n\nDescribe the three instances when the family of Germanicus have carried ashes through Rome.\n\nThere is a theory that Agrippina plotted with Lepidus to put her son on the throne. She was twenty-four at the time.\n\nWhat does it tell you about the strength of her family blood?\n\nWhat might have been Agrippina’s ambitions at this time? ​\n\nrole during the reign of Claudius\n\nAfter the death of Gaius in 41CE Claudius was proclaimed Emperor and he recalled his exiled nieces Livilla and Agrippina to Rome, and Agrippina was reunited with Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. Claudius was married to Domitia Lepida’s daughter Valeria Messalina and in February of 41 they had a son, at first called Germanicus, but later called Britannicus after Claudius’ successful conquest of Britain. Agrippina appears to have been searching for a husband.\n\nquestions\n\nHow old was Nero when Agrippina was exiled?\n\nHow old was Nero when Agrippina returned from exile?\n\nDraw up a family tree for Brittanicus going back to his great grandparents. ​\n\nMarriages: Passienus Crispus\n\nIn 41CE Agrippina married Sallustius Passienus Crispus, an extremely wealthy and influential man, but not from the old aristocratic families. Crispus had been a consul in 27 and was proconsul of Asia at the time of his marriage to Agrippina. He is most famous for his witticisms directed at the princeps themselves. Crispus had been previously married to Domitia, the sister of Ahenobarbus making him Agrippina’s brother–in-law. It was Claudius who arranged the divorce to his first wife so that he could marry Agrippina. Two of his most famous witty comments; when Gaius asked him if he had slept with his sister Domitia, Crispus replied ‘not yet’; when asked what he thought was the nature of the relationship between Tiberius and Gaius he replied ‘never has the world seen a better slave or a worse master’. He was consul again in 44.\n\n“It is likely that Agrippina’s family background would have made her feel at home in a setting of literate sophistication, although Passienus’ great wealth would have also been a considerable inducement”\n\n“…wit was combined with a lively sense of humour that could sometimes be outlandishly eccentric…much of his humour was dangerously directed against his imperial masters”\n\n“Passienus’ desire to conclude a political marriage for his own career advancement”\n\nBarrett\n\nCrispus' house in Rome next to the Mausoleum of Augustus\n\nIt appears on the face of it that Agrippina had married beneath herself, however when one takes into account that she may have been trying to avoid the jealous eye of Messalina her move makes much more sense. Messalina was at this time eliminating rivals to her son Brittanicus. Agrippinas remaining sister Livilla was re-exiled in 42 CE perhaps because she was an imperial widow, therefore a potential rival.\n\nThat Agrippina survived the years of Messalina’s dominance in Rome ways much for her political sagacity. She knew when to take a low profile...Agrippina not only survived this period, but prospered...Her strategy was to seek a safe marriage; one to a nobleman who was prominent enough to be worthy, but not worthy enough to be dangerous.... she settled on her own brother in law, C. Sallustus Passienus Crispus, the husband of Domitia Lepida and Nero’s foster father.\n\nBill Leadbetter, 1997, The Ambition of Agrippina the Younger\n\nLittle more is heard of her over the next 5 years, an educated guess inviting us to presume she may have accompanied her new husband (Crispus) to his proconsulship in Asia in 42. Annelise FreisenbruchThe first ladies of Rome.\n\nIn 47 an event occurred that might have put Agrippina and young Lucius in danger. At the Secular Games Claudius held in 47, Lucius received perceptibly more applause than Messalina’s son Britannicus when the two babes were presented to the people of Rome.\n\nBut when Claudius became emperor, Nero not only recovered his father's property, but was also enriched by an inheritance from his step-father, Passienus Crispus. When his mother was recalled from banishment and reinstated, he became so prominent through her influence that it leaked out that Messalina, wife of Claudius, had sent emissaries to strangle him as he was taking his noonday nap, regarding him as a rival of Britannicus. An addition to this bit of gossip is, that the would-be assassins were frightened away by a snake which darted out from under his pillow. The only foundation for this tale was, that there was found in his bed near the pillow the slough of a serpent; but nevertheless at his mother's desire he had the skin enclosed in a golden bracelet, and wore it for a long time on his left arm. But when at last the memory of his mother grew hateful to him, he threw it away, and afterwards in the time of his extremity sought it again in vain.\n\nSuetonius The Twelve Caesars\n\nCrispus died in 47CE and left Agrippina and Lucius a great mass of wealth. In 48CE Messalina was executed for bigamy and adultery.\n\nBritannicus, the son of Claudius. This rare Sestertius was likely struck in a local mint in Thrakia\n\nquestions\n\nWhat is so significant about this coin being minted?\n\nWhy do you think it appeared only in the provinces?\n\nWhy might Lucius get more applause than Britannicus?\n\nHow was Agrippina a threat to Messalina? ​\n\nThe death of Messalina opened a new chapter in Agrippina’s career. There is no suggestion that she had anything to do with her rival’s destruction, but the beneficial effect on her fortunes is clear. Not yet in quite the top rank as a politician, the eldest daughter of Agrippina and Germanicus would now come into her own, dominating the politics of her time as no member of the Domus, not even Livia, had ever done. In some respects she would be a worthy successor to Messalina, eliminating those who stood in her way with the same ruthless efficiency. She also shared Messalina’s indifference to conventional morality, except that she kept a tight rein on her passions. As Tacitus puts it, ‘She held honour, modesty, her body, everything, cheaper than sovereignty’. A strong tradition, which Tacitus finds it difficult to reject, has her offer herself to her son in order to retain her grip on power. She had one supreme ambition, to place her son Nero on the throne: ‘Let him kill me, but let him rule.’ But not far behind that was her determination to secure a position of unprecedented eminence for herself. She proposed coming as close as it was possible for a woman to come to a partnership in power; she would be, in fact though not in law, asocia imperii. The story of Agrippina in Claudius’ reign is the story of her successful realisation of both her objectives.\n\n​Richard Bauman, Women and Politics in Ancient Rome\n\nWithout a wife Claudius may have been a dangerous position. The attempted coup d'etat by Silius and Messalina had probably made Claudius realise the weakness of his position as a member of the Claudian but not the Julian family. A link to the Julii was a link to Augustus, and it was a link that legitimised the princep, and Claudius had none. This weakness was compounded by the fact that he did not have an obvious adult heir, Britannicus being just a boy. Agrippina was one of the few remaining descendants of Augustus, and her son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus was one of the last males of the imperial family. Within just three months the senate gave a special dispensation so that uncles could marry their nieces and Claudius married his niece Agrippinilla. She was 34.\n\nMarriages: Claudius\n\n...After a little he married his niece Agrippina, the mother of Domitius, who was surnamed Nero. For she was beautiful and was in the habit of consulting him constantly; and she was much in his company unattended, seeing that he was her uncle, and in fact she was rather more familiar in her conduct toward him than became a niece.\n\nCassius Dio ​​\n\nThe destruction of Messalina shook the imperial house; for a strife arose among the freedmen, who should choose a wife for Claudius, impatient as he was of a single life and submissive to the rule of wives. The ladies were fired with no less jealousy. Each insisted on her rank, beauty, and fortune, and pointed to her claims to such a marriage. But the keenest competition was between Lollia Paulina, the daughter of Marcus Lollius, an ex-consul, and Julia Agrippina, the daughter of Germanicus. Callistus favoured the first, Pallas the second. Aelia Paetina however, of the family of the Tuberones, had the support of Narcissus. The emperor, who inclined now one way, now another, as he listened to this or that adviser, summoned the disputants to a conference and bade them express their opinions and give their reasons.\n\nNarcissus dwelt on the marriage of years gone by, on the ties of offspring, for Paetina was the mother of Antonia, and on the advantage of excluding a new element from his household, by the return of a wife to whom he was accustomed, and who would assuredly not look with a stepmother's animosity on Britannicus and Octavia, who were next in her affections to her own children. Callistus argued that she was compromised by her long separation, and that were she to be taken back, she would be supercilious on the strength of it. It would be far better to introduce Lollia, for, as she had no children of her own, she would be free from jealousy, and would take the place of a mother towards her stepchildren.\n\nPallas again selected Agrippina for special commendation because she would bring with her Germanicus's grandson, who was thoroughly worthy of imperial rank, the scion of a noble house and a link to unite the descendants of the Claudian family. He hoped that a woman, who was the mother of many children and still in the freshness of youth, would not carry off the grandeur of the Caesars to some other house…But no difficulty seemed to be presented by the temper of a sovereign who had neither partialities nor dislikes, but such as were suggested and dictated to him.\n\nTacitus Annals ‘the Mother of Nero’\n\n‘To Claudius, not only did she represent the Julian wing of the dynasty, but he can hardly have been unaware of her political talents or for that matter, her ambitions...But Claudius’ choice of Agrippina was policy, not whimsy...It was good politics.’\n\nBill Leadbetter, 1997, The Ambition of Agrippina the Younger ​\n\nquestions\n\nWhy did Claudius need a new wife?\n\nWhat is Cassius Dio’s explanation for why Claudius married Agrippina? ​\n\nStatue of Agrippina Minor perhaps recut from a statue of Messalina, Marble, from Herculaneum, AD 41-59\n\nAgrippina acted as a partner with Claudius. According to the ancient sources, between her rise and Claudius' death in 54 AD, Agrippina systematically took control of the Imperial government while Claudius was left to appear as a figurehead in front of his wife's real power.She wore a military cloak at official state functions, greeted foreign embassies in the capacity of full imperial authority, appeared prominently on coinage and had her dictations recorded in official government documentation.\n\n‘Agrippina’s presence seems to have transformed the regime of her husband’.\n\nAnthony A Barrett\n\n‘No sooner was her marriage to Claudius consecrated than the seeds of her longing to exercise her political power on her own behalf began to germinate’\n\nAnnelise Freisenbruch\n\nAgrippina’s marriage to Claudius marks her ascendancy to real power in Rome...Agrippina then set about cementing her position, ensuring Nero’s, and enjoying her new status. Her most immediate requirement was powerful supporters... Her position was strengthened by the elimination of rivals. The political nature of her marriage was plain.\n\nBill Leadbetter, 1997, The Ambition of Agrippina the Younger\n\nThe Gemma Claudii. This cameo depicts Germanicus & Agrippina I facing Claudius & Agrippina II clearly attempting to solidify the family connection to the Claudian line. Agrippina the Younger is wearing the corona spicea two sheaves of grain and a poppy- attributes of the goddess Tyche the protector of cities.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Agrippina used her influence to surround and protect her position with men loyal to her and her son. Seneca, who despised Claudius but kept it in check, was recalled and installed as Lucius’ tutor. Back in Rome he used his brilliant political skill to influence the imperial court to Agrippina's wishes. Additionally, her own choice of Sextus Afranius Burrus was appointed as the all-important Praetorian Prefect and as a second tutor for Lucius, with the obvious ramifications that suggests.\n\nLucius was 4 years older than Claudius' natural son Britannicus and Agrippina convinced Claudius that adopting her son was better for the preservation of the principate. Thus, Lucius became Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus Caesar and would eventually be advanced over Britannicus as Claudius' heir. To further solidify that position, Agrippina had the fiance of Claudius daughter prosecuted in order to make her available to marry Nero. A potential rival marriage candidate for Claudius, Lollia Paulina, was driven to suicide, and Agrippina would exert such authority as to be declared an official living Empress (or Augusta). Only Livia and Antonia had been so before, and only after their deaths.\n\nMeanwhile the young Nero continued to be advanced as the heir to Claudius while Britannicus languished behind, virtually invisible compared to Nero. He was granted full imperial authority outside the city (where Claudius retained singular control in theory) addressed the Senate, appeared with Claudius at the games (obvious indication of his role as heir) and was inscribed as such on imperial coinage.\n\n…within two or three years of her marriage, Agrippina had virtually ousted Britannicus from the succession. She had forced an emperor whom she dominated completely to bypass his son in favour of an outsider.\n\nRichard Bauman, Women and Politics in Ancient Rome\n\nEqually vital and equally difficult was the task of persuading the public to accept the legitimacy of the new marriage to his own niece; these motives, presumably, prompted the swift conferral on Agrippina of the title of ‘Augusta’, the advancement of her son over his own son Brittanicus, and the aggressive emphasis in the public artistic media, such as coinage, on the new status of both Nero and Agrippina. The reappearance of the empress's mother and namesake in the bronze coinage of the same period may constitute one of the earliest invocations of her memory to legitimise the honours now conferred on her daughter.\n\nSusan Wood\n\nAs usual, coinage was the primary medium, and Agrippina became the latest imperial woman to set a new precedent here, with both hers and her husbands head featured together on the same coin.\n\nAnnelise Freisenbruch The first ladies of Rome.\n\nAs soon as Agrippina had come to live in the palace she gained complete control over Claudius. Indeed, she was very clever in making the most of opportunities, and, partly by fear and partly by favours, she won the devotion of all those who were at all friendly toward him. At length she caused his son Britannicus to be brought up as if he were a mere nobody. She made Domitius (Nero) the son-inlaw of Claudius at this time and later brought about his adoption also. She accomplished these ends partly by getting the freedmen to persuade Claudius and partly by arranging beforehand that the senate, the populace, and the soldiers would join together in shouting their approval of her demands on every occasion. Agrippina was training her son for the throne and was entrusting his education to Seneca. She was amassing untold wealth for him, overlooking no possible source of revenue, not even the most humble or despised, but paying court to everyone who was in the least degree well-to-do and murdering many for this very reason.\n\nCassius Dio\n\nquestions\n\nWhy does Cassius Dio say that Claudius married Agrippina?\n\nHow did Agrippina get what she wanted?\n\nWhat is it that Agrippina wanted according to Cassius Dio? ​\n\ndemonstrations of power\n\nRelationship with Pallas\n\nPallas recommended Agrippina II as Claudius wife\n\nAgrippina took Pallas, one of Claudius’ closest freedmen as her lover\n\nHad access to the treasury through him\n\nAdvanced members of his family into powerful positions - his brother Felix as procurator of Judea\n\nRelationship with Seneca\n\nIn 49, Agrippina used her influence over Claudius to recall Seneca from exile and give him the position of praetor\n\nShe wanted him to tutor her son. “had designs on him [Seneca] as a distinguished tutor for her young son…” (Tacitus) ultimately to increase power and elevate him to the role of princeps. “Agrippina was training her son for the throne and entrusting his education to Seneca” (Cassius Dio)\n\nSeneca did follow Agrippina’s instructions until he realised that being an amicus princepis (friend of the princeps) to Nero gave him even greater powers\n\nRelationship with Burrus\n\nEnsured her support from the Praetorian Guard Burrus was made sole praetorian prefect in 51CE\n\nBurrus, according to Tacitus, was “fully aware whose initiative was behind his appointment” and the power Agrippina wielded due to this relationship ultimately facilitated Nero’s rise to power.\n\nRelationship with Octavia\n\nAgrippina wanted Nero to marry Claudius’ daughter Octavia. However, she was betrothed to Iunius Silanus. Agrippina managed to get this betrothal cancelled on the grounds that Silanus had committed incest with his sister, Junia Calvina. Behind this was Vitellius, the man who had managed to legalise Agrippina’s marriage to her uncle. Nero was betrothed to Octavia.\n\nAD 50 – Nero was formally adopted by Claudius. However, now he and Octavia were technically brother and sister, so Agrippina arranged for Octavia to be ‘adopted out’. Nero was now given precedence in the succession over Claudius’ natural son, Britannicus\n\nPromoting Nero\n\nIn 51, Nero was elected consul, the post to be taken up when he had reached the age of 19.\n\nVarious other honours were bestowed upon Nero. He was made Prince of Youth and granted proconsular imperium outside of Rome. He was placed into various priesthoods.\n\nAgrippina tried to isolate Britannicus by removing his tutors and replacing them with men loyal to her, e.g. Seneca.\n\nIn 53, Nero and Octavia were married. He was now lined up to finally take over from Claudius.\n\nRemoving Rivals\n\nLollia Paulina was accused of dabbling with astrology and forced to suicide.\n\nClaudius’ favourite mistress, Calpurnia, was banished after Claudius’ casual comment on her beauty. “Agrippina also banished Calpurnia, one of the most prominent women – or even put her to death, according to one report – because Claudius had admired and commended her beauty.” (Dio Cassius)\n\nShe feared Domitia Lepida’s closeness to Nero. She accused her of various black magic offences and was put to death.\n\nNarcissus, who had supported Domitia Lepida, was sent to Sinuessa, imprisoned, tortued and eventually forced to suicide.\n\nMilitary powers\n\nThe Praetorian prefects Geta and Crispinus were removed, and replaced by her man Afranius Burrus.\n\nAppeared in a golden military cloak at the Draining of the Fucine Lake\n\nHonours\n\nshe was given the right to ride in the Carpentum\n\nShe was given the title ‘Augusta’, making her the first living consort of a living emperor to receive such an honour.\n\nA colony in Germania where she was born was named after her – Colonia Claudia Augusta Aggripinensium.\n\nShe was allowed to meet foreign dignitaries - and received king Caractacus when he and his wives and daughters surrendered and were brought to Rome to surrender to Claudius personally.\n\nIn some statues of her from this time, she was depicted wearing a diadem, an exceptional honour usually reserved for goddesses.\n\nColossal statue of her at Pompeii\n\nA Sebasteoin relief from the city of Aphrodisias depicts Agrippina standing next to Claudius and clasping his hand, a typical gesture to express both Concordia and marital affection - Agrippina is holding a corn stalk in her left hand, a symbol of the prosperity of the Roman empire.\n\nProvincial powers\n\nIn Judaea, there was a dispute between the Jews and the Samaritans, the latter supported by Roman governor Cumanus. Agrippina sided with the Jews and was able to have Cumanus removed and replaced by her own pro-Jewish candidate, Felix, brother of the freedman Pallas. (Josephus)\n\ncoins minted in Ephesus with Agrippina’s face jugate (behind Claudius’ on the Obverse of the coin\n\nBuilding projects\n\nThe construction of the Domus Tiberiana highlights the role of both her and Claudius in running the state. “The author of the Domus Tiberiana (expresses) Agrippina’s grandiose concept of the role of herself and of Claudius in the overall scheme of things.” (Barrett).\n\nDraining the Fucine Lake\n\nAgrippina and Claudius and an unknown senator from the reliefs at Aprodisias Annelise Freisenbruch states about the image: “Claudius was wreathed in laurel as befitted the successful military ruler and Agrippina wore the corn ears crown associated with the goddess of fecundity and maternal love, Ceres. ... For in visual terms, it placed the emperors‘ wife on a form approaching equality with the emperor.”\n\nStill Agrippina did not yet dare to attempt her greatest scheme, unless Lusius Geta and Rufius Crispinus were removed from the command of the praetorian cohorts; for she thought that they cherished Messalina's memory and were devoted to her children. Accordingly, as the emperor's wife persistently affirmed that faction was rife among these cohorts through the rivalry of the two officers and that there would be stricter discipline under one commander, the appointment was transferred to Burrus Afranius, who had a brilliant reputation as a soldier, but knew well to whose wish he owed his promotion. Agrippina, too, continued to exalt her own dignity; she would enter the Capitol in a chariot, a practice, which being allowed of old only to the priests and sacred images, increased the popular reverence for a woman who up to this time was the only recorded instance of one who, an emperor's daughter, was sister, wife, and mother of a sovereign.\n\n​Tacitus Annals ‘The Mother Of Nero’\n\nAureus minted under Claudius in 51-54AD, Reverse shows Agrippina Augustae wearing a crown of corn ears\n\nNo one attempted in any way to hinder Agrippina; indeed, she had more power than Claudius himself and used to greet in public all who desired it, a fact that was entered in the records. She possessed all power, since she dominated Claudius and had won over Pallas…\n\nCassius Dio\n\nquestions\n\nWhy did Agrippina remove the Praetorian Prefects Geta and Crispinus?\n\nWhat honours did Agrippina receive at this time? ​\n\nIn 50 AD Claudius adopted Lucius as his own son. Lucius was given the name ‘Nero’. In the same year, Agrippina was given the name ‘Augusta’ a name that had been previously conferred upon Livia in 14 CE in Augustus’ will, and Antonia Minor in 41CE after her death by Gaius. No woman had received the title while she was still alive and it translated to the populace as a title that indicated a kind of equality with the emperor. The adoption of Lucius over Claudius’s own son Brittanicus has been an issue of debate among historians both in ancient times and modern.\n\nHowever, the emperor received formal thanks, and still more elaborate flattery was paid to Domitius. A law was passed, adopting him into the Claudian family with the name of Nero. Agrippina too was honoured with the title of Augusta. When this had been done, there was not a person so void of pity as not to feel keen sorrow at the position of Britannicus. Gradually forsaken by the very slaves who waited on him, he turned into ridicule the ill-timed attentions of his stepmother, perceiving their insincerity. For he is said to have had by no means a dull understanding; and this is either a fact, or perhaps his perils won him sympathy, and so he possessed the credit of it, without actual evidence.\n\nTacitus\n\nFor Agrippina was leaving no stone unturned in order to make Nero popular with the masses and to cause him to be regarded as the only successor to the imperial power. In consequence of this he became a person of importance and his name was on everybody's lips, whereas in the case of Britannicus many did not know even whether he was living, and the rest regarded him as insane and an epileptic; for this was the report that Agrippina gave out. And he (Nero) married Octavia at this time — another circumstance that caused him to be regarded as having at length come to manhood.\n\nCassius Dio\n\nquestions\n\nWhat is Agrippina’s motive in having Nero adopted, according to each of the ancient writers?\n\nHow do the ancient writers make you feel for Britannicus? ​\n\nRead the modern writers interpretations below and compare them to the ancient writers perceptions.\n\nNor was the principate yet hereditary: the Senate was free to choose whoever it wished. True, so far it had chosen members of the Augustan family, but only because it was easier to find there persons who were known and respected, who had the admiration of the soldiers in distant regions, and who had received preparation for the difficult duties of their office. This was why Augustus and Tiberius had always prepared more than one youth for the principate, so that the Senate might have some choice, and so that there might be one reserve. So for Agrippina to persuade Claudius to adopt Nero does not mean that she wanted Britannicus set aside. It merely proves that she did not want the family of Augustus to lose power, so she prepared two possible successors to Claudius, just as Augustus had for a long time trained both Drusus and Tiberius. When Claudius adopted Nero in AD 50, Claudius was already 60. Britannicus was 9. Nero was 14. It would have been most imprudent to designate a 9-year-old boy as Claudius' only successor. Octavia, daughter of Claudius and Messalina, was chaste, modest, patient, gentle and unselfish - all the virtues which the ancient Roman nobility had valued. By betrothing her to Nero, Agrippina had tried to make a couple to serve as an example.\n\nGuglielmo Ferrero\n\nOf Agrippina's many contributions to the history of the reign [of Claudius] one that is often neglected is her abandonment of that Julian article of faith, the divine blood of Augustus. Once Nero became a Claudian by adoption, Agrippina threw herself wholeheartedly into promoting the new link, and redoubled her efforts when she herself was given the title of Augustus'. Although technically this did not make her a Claudian – she was not adopted as Livia had been by Augustus (in his will) – it did strengthen the bond. In a certain sense she was simply returning to her origins, since her father had been a Claudian until his adoption by Tiberius and the latter’s interlocking adoption by Augustus. Having forged a Claudian link to her son’s advantage, Agrippina reinforced his position (and also her own) after his accession by springing to the defence of Divus Claudius, the god who was now Nero's father… In spite of her many unpleasant qualities, one cannot help feeling a certain admiration for Julia Agrippina, the last of the really great Julio-Claudian matrons.\n\nRichard Baumann\n\nNo one doubted that Agrippina was deeply ambitious for her adolescent son, Nero from the start.\n\nAs Nero’s’ start rose so too did his mothers. She was endowed with the usual seating privileges at the theatre, the right to ride in her own mule drawn carriage, and other distinctions that had by now become fairly common place for leading imperial women, but the coup de grace was the conferral upon her in 50AD of Livia’s old cognomen ‘Augusta’ the title that Claudius had vetoed for Messalina. …No woman before Agrippina had received it (Augusta) while she was the consort of the reigning emperor…\n\n​Annelise Freisenbruch\n\nquestions\n\nList Ferrero’s reasons why Nero was adopted.\n\nHow does this change your feelings for Britannicus? ​\n\nAureus circa 50-54, AV 19 mm, 7.40 g.

There are various accounts by the ancient writers all implicating his wife, Agrippina.\n\nClaudius was deified by the Senate shortly after death. His will was suppressed and never read. Claudius had changed it shortly before death to either recommend Nero and Britannicus jointly or perhaps just Britannicus, who would assume the toga vilrllius in a few months. Agrippina had sent away Narcissus shortly before Claudius' death -the last act of this secretary of letters was to burn all of Claudius' correspondence- but on his arrival back in Rome Agrippina had him murdered.\n\nThat Claudius was poisoned is the general belief, but when it was done and by whom is disputed. Some say that it was his taster, the eunuch Halotus, as he was banqueting on the Citadel with the priests; others that at a family dinner Agrippina served the drug to him with her own hand in mushrooms, a dish of which he was extravagantly fond.\n\nSuetonius\n\nThereupon, Agrippina, who had long decided on the crime and eagerly grasped at the opportunity thus offered, and did not lack instruments, deliberated on the nature of the poison to be used. The deed would be betrayed by one that was sudden and instantaneous, while if she chose a slow and lingering poison, there was a fear that Claudius, when near his end, might, on detecting the treachery, return to his love for his son.\n\nTacitus\n\nHe would not endure her behaviour, but was preparing to put an end to her power, to cause his son to assume the toga virilis, and to declare him heir to the throne. Agrippina, learning of this, became alarmed and made haste to forestall anything of the sort by poisoning Claudius.\n\nCassius Dio\n\nIt has been alleged that he (Claudius) was poisoned by Agrippina’s own hand, avoiding the many elaborate security measures. Most such accusations rest on fairly flimsy evidence. In this case, the evidence is persuasive. His death was remarkably convenient. The sources are remarkably precise. Nero is said to have quipped that mushrooms were surely the food of the gods since his father became a god through a mushroom.\n\nAgrippina had planned Nero’s accession with care, and it seems likely that it was the mere possibility that Nero might have a rival that brought a sudden end to Claudius’ life.\n\nRichard Alston\n\nThe charge of poisoning is frequently levelled during the Julio Claudian period especially against women.\n\nAnthony A Barrett\n\nquestions\n\nDescribe the events surrounding Claudius’ death.\n\nHow do the accounts of Claudius’ death differ?\n\nWhat are the reasons given for Agrippina to have poisoned Claudius?\n\nBronze statue of Agrippina from the theatre at Herculaneum.\n\nNero and his circle wasted no time vilifying Claudius; Nero even criticised him in his eulogy. Most of Claudius' laws and edicts were annulled, under the reasoning that he was too stupid and senile to have meant them. This opinion of Claudius, that he was indeed an old idiot, remained the official one for the duration of Nero's reign. Eventually Nero stopped referring to his deified adoptive father at all, and realigned with his birth family.Later in Suetonius’ Life of Vespasian he mentions that the emperor began work on the temple of the divine Claudius that had been started by Agrippina but destroyed by Nero.\n\nrole & changing relationship with Nero\n\nThe inability to reconcile maternal and political instincts was her one crucial failing.\n\n-Barrett​\n\nRelief from the Sebasteion at Aphrodisias depicting Agrippina crowning Nero. Annelise Freisenbruch says of this releif: ‘It is the first known visual representation of one member of the imperial family crowning another, let alone of a mother stage-managing her son’s coronation. .....For some ancient observers, such women epitomised an aberrant category of female described in roman literature as a dux femina (a woman general) an oxymoron of title that implied an unnatural combination of male and female characteristics. There are in fact, only five or so images like this from this period that depict someone else crowning an emperor...see https://journals.openedition.org/syria/1915\n\nAt first Agrippina managed for him all the business of the empire; and she and her son went forth together, often reclining in the same litter, though more commonly she would be carried and he would walk beside her. She also received the various embassies and sent letters to peoples and governors and kings.\n\n-Cassius Dio\n\nStill every honour was openly heaped on Agrippina, and to a tribune who according to military custom asked the watchword, Nero gave \"the best of mothers.\" The Senate also decreed her two Lictors, with the office of priestess to Claudius, and voted to the late emperor a censor's funeral, which was soon followed by deification.\n\n-Tacitus The Annals\n\nAgrippina's memory seems to have been invoked by her daughter, the younger Agrippina, as a precedent for her own political ambitions. Agrippina the Younger is known to have sought not only to exercise the powers of a regent in the early years of the reign of Nero, but to have her role officially recognized. Her mother's images thus played a role in one of the very rare efforts, perhaps the only one, by a Roman woman to establish herself as a head of state.\n\n-Susan Wood\n\nIn 54CE, Claudius was dead and Agrippina’s only child, Nero, was proclaimed Princeps. Under Nero, Agrippina may have seen the height of her power. She was able to control the empire as though she were the empress at this time and the sources even paint a picture of good administration during the first years – Quinquennium Neronis - of Nero’s principate. The quinquennium finishes October 59 exactly, only months after Agrippina’s death.\n\nHowever there are indications that she was opposed at least by Nero’s advisors even at the outset of his reign. In his speech to the senate (composed by Seneca) on his accession Nero condemned some of Claudius’ policies and habits, promising not to interfere in the senates’ role and not to let freedmen get too powerful. He even allowed the senate to reverse some policies of Claudius. All of these slights on the principate of Claudius were also slights on Agrippina, who had been a partner in that power.\n\ndemonstrations of power under Nero\n\nAgrippina’s privilege would have served to elevate her in the public mind to the status of a woman who had a quasi-official share in the administration of the principate\n\n-Barrett.\n\nNero’s first act was to appear at the Guards camp, where he gave a speech. The password he gave to the Praetorian sentry on duty on the day of his accession was optima mater, ‘the best of mothers’ (Suetonius).\n\nWith Seneca and Burrus she formed an unofficial triumvirate forming government\n\nThe great honour enjoyed by Agrippina at the beginning of Nero’s reign can be seen in the sculptured relief of the two of them from the Sebasteion relief from Aphrodisias -she crowns him.\n\nPriestess:\n\nWhen Claudius was deified, she became priestess of his cult.\n\nShe was granted two lictors carrying the official emblems of public office – the fasces – who walked before magistrates to clear a path through the crowd so that they could pass.\n\nPropaganda\n\nEvidence of her exceptionally high statues can also be seen in the gold and silver coins minted in the first year of Nero’s reign.\n\nSenate:\n\nIn late 54, there was an attempt at the Senate to change some laws which had been passed during Claudius’ reign. In her role as ‘priestess of the cult of the divine Claudius’ Agrippina fought this – unsuccessfully. However, she attended a session of the senate, being a curtain, while the laws were being debated – exceptional example of influence: “the amending laws were passed, but Agrippina had achieved the unthinkable; she had attended a meeting of the senate” Bauman\n\nquestions\n\nFrom the timeline at the front of the booklet, outline the events, which marked her progressive fall from power.\n\nWhat incidents in the timeline could indicate that Agrippina still commanded a great deal of respect from elements of Roman Society?\n\nagrippina's victims\n\n47 CE\n\nPassienus Crispus Agrippina’s 2nd husband poisoned (suet.)\n\n49 CE\n\nLollia Paulina as she was a rival for Claudius’ hand in marriage as proposed by the freedman Callistus.

Links to both predecessors through Agrippina are stressed. There is also an allusion to the fact that Agrippina had an official position as priestess of the deified Claudius It is the first time a living imperial woman appeared together with the ruling emperor on the obverse of a coin. The combination of 2 imperial portraits on the obverse was very rare, nor had an emperor ever been so closely identified with his mother rather than his father. These coins are more than a simple reflection of political standing. They are striking evidence for the degree to which Nero’s claim to authority depended on the figure of Agrippina.\n\nThe ascendancy she enjoyed after her sons Nero’s accession coincided with the finest period of his administration, and her final departure from the scene seems to have removed the restraining check to his descent into erratic tyranny.\n\n-Anthony A Barrett\n\nquestions\n\nWhat date would you give to the height of Agrippina’s power and why?\n\nDuring the first few years of Nero’s principate reign as a golden age like the time of Augustus, what does this tell you about Agrippina’s government? ​\n\nrelationships with members of the imperial court: seneca & burrus\n\nThe standard view is that Agrippina’s influence began to diminish after 55 CE as a result of Seneca and Burrus’ growing power over the emperor. Dio and Tacitus place the ‘Armenian incident’ around 54CE which clearly emphasises Agrippinas’ eclipse by the two advisors.\n\nWhen this had been going on for some time, it aroused the displeasure of Seneca and Burrus, who were at once the most sensible and the most influential of the men at Nero's court. They seized the following occasion to put a stop to it: an embassy of Armenians had arrived and Agrippina wished to mount the tribunal from which Nero was talking with them. The two men, seeing her approach, persuaded the young man to descend and meet his mother before she could get there, as if to extend some special greeting to her. Then, having brought this about, they did not re-ascend the tribunal, but made some excuse, so that the weakness in the empire should not become apparent to foreigners; and thereafter they laboured to prevent any public business from again being committed to her hands…\n\n-Cassius Dio\n\nHe kept his promise and many matters were decided by the senate. No one was to be paid a fee or given a present for pleading a case; there was to be no requirement for the quaestors-elect to put on gladiatorial shows. Agrippina opposed this, on the grounds that it overturned a law of Claudius; however, the proposal was passed by the senators who used to be called to the palace, so that she might stand near a door built behind them, where she was hidden behind a curtain which stopped her being seen, but did not stop her hearing what was said. When envoys from Armenia were having an audience with Nero, she was getting ready to walk up onto the raised area and sit next to him. She would have done so, if Seneca, while everyone stood there amazed, had not told Nero to go down and greet his mother as she came up. This display of a son’s concern prevented the scandal.\n\n- Tacitus\n\nThis, it is asserted, was a masterpiece in tact. It was nothing of the sort. It was a public demotion.\n\n-Bill Leadbetter\n\nThe sources relate that as Agrippina lost her power to other women in Nero’s life, she reasserted her potestas (power) by initiating incest.\n\nThat he even desired illicit relations with his own mother, and was kept from it by her enemies, who feared that such a help might give the reckless and insolent woman too great influence, was notorious, especially after he added to his concubines a courtesan who was said to look very like Agrippina. Even before that, so they say, whenever he rode in a litter with his mother, he had incestuous relations with her, which were betrayed by the stains on his clothing.\n\n-Suetonius\n\nFabius Rusticus tells us that it was not Agrippina, but Nero, who lusted for the crime, and that it was frustrated by the adroitness of that same freed-girl. Cluvius's account, however, is also that of all other authors, and popular belief inclines to it, whether it was that Agrippina really conceived such a monstrous wickedness in her heart, or perhaps because the thought of a strange passion seemed comparatively credible in a woman, who in her girlish years had allowed herself to be seduced by Lepidus in the hope of winning power, had stooped with a like ambition to the lust of Pallas, and had trained herself for every infamy by her marriage with her uncle.\n\n-Tacitus\n\nAgrippina could only have risked the moral condemnation of society if she had felt sure of gaining political power by her unnatural union. Official recognition as her son's partner in Imperial power was, infact, the sum total of her desires.\n\n-H. G. Mullens\n\nThe relationship between Nero and Agrippina began to decline and Agrippina threatened that she would present Britannicus to the praetorians. In 55 CE a day before he was due to assume the toga virilis, Nero had Britannicus poisoned. Agrippina responded by trying to befriend Nero’s young wife Octavia and increase her own patronage. The conflict between the two grew more as Nero had more serious affairs with other women, first Acte, an oriental freedwomen from Asia Minor (Turkey) and then Poppaea Sabina the once wife of general Galba. Seneca and Burrus encouraged these unions to draw the young princep away from the influence of his mother and Agrippina opposed both unions, thus distancing herself from her son.\n\nAnd when Nero had thus obtained the government, he got Britannicus to be so poisoned, that the multitude should not perceive it: although he publicly put his own mother to death, not long afterward. Making her this requital, not only for being born of her, but for bringing it so about by her contrivances, that he obtained the Roman Empire. He also slew Octavia, his own wife, and many other illustrious persons, under this pretence, that they plotted against him.\n\n-Josephus Antiquities of the Jews, Book XX, Chapter 8\n\nAgrippina gradually began to lose her influence for a number of reasons. Firstly, Seneca and Burrus, perhaps resenting such power in the hands of a woman and wanting more themselves, began to undermine her control by removing her main supporter Pallas.\n\n-Cassius Dio\n\nHe certainly came to conceive the liveliest hatred for her so that he determined to put an end to her ambitions forever.\n\n-Edward Togo Salmon\n\nThe Romans…saw the elevation of women like Agrippina as an inversion of the natural order, and the preoccupation of the ancient writers with the evils of female ambition all but blinded them to any admirable qualities they might have possessed.\n\n-Anthony A Barret\n\nquestions\n\nUsing the sources, analyse why Agrippina’s power and influence declined. In your answer include:\n\nThe role of Seneca and Burrus\n\nHer relationship with Nero\n\nOther members of the Imperial court\n\nAfter the poisoning of Britannicus, Agrippina had only few clients left who were still loyal to her. She had been betrayed by Seneca and Burrus, her son had turned against her, Pallas was dismissed from court, and she had no male relations. Her situation was precarious. It is at this point that the sources indicate that Agrippina began to look for a male to support her, or indeed, one that she could support as a rival heir to Nero.\n\nShe seemed to be looking round for a party and a leader for it.‘I will take Britannicus to the Praetorians’ camp. Let them listen to Germanicus’ daughter pitted against the men who claim to rule the whole human race…Burrus and Seneca!’ (At this point, Tacitus tells us that a former intimate friend, Junia Silana, saw a chance of exacting revenge on Agrippina. She put up two of her dependents. They…) …. hinted that it was her (Agrippina’s) purpose to encourage in revolutionary designs Rubellius Plautus, who his mother's side was as nearly connected as Nero with the Divine Augustus; and then, by marrying him and making him emperor, again seize the control of the State.\n\n-Tacitus\n\nHe put to death Antonia, daughter of Claudius, for refusing to marry him after Poppaea's death, charging her with an attempt at revolution; and he treated in the same way all others who were in any way connected with him by blood or by marriage. Among these was the young Aulus Plautius, whom he forcibly defiled before his death, saying \"Let my mother come now and kiss my successor,\" openly charging that Agrippina had loved Plautius and that this had roused him to hopes of the throne.\n\n-Suetonius\n\nBut when she found herself accomplishing nothing she took it greatly to heart and said to him ‘it was I who made you emperor’ just as if she had the power to take away sovereignty from him again. To the Praetorians he gave money, evidently to inspire in them the hope that many such crimes would be committed; and to the senate he sent a letter in which he enumerated the offences of which he knew she was guilty, and charged also that she had plotted against him and on being detected had committed suicide....Sabina on learning of this persuaded Nero to get rid of his mother, alleging that she was plotting against him.\n\n-Cassius Dio\n\nTacitus and Suetonius claim that Agrippina was searching for a male that she could marry and support, which is a legitimate threat to Nero’s power. Tacitus relates that Agrippina’s enemy Silana hinted that the male that Agrippina had decided on in 55CE was Gaius Rubellius Plautus, who was descended from Tiberius and whose lineage made him a direct rival to Nero.\n\n​\n\nPlautus was married already and had his own children, and although Nero seems not to have persecuted him at this time, Nero did have Plautus and his entire family killed in 66CE after rumours that Plautus was involved in negotiations with eastern general Corbulo who was also executed.\n\nSuetonius implicates Aulus Plautus as a once lover of Agrippina, although whether or not he was considered by her to place in the office of Princeps is uncertain. Aulus Plautus was the son of a general by the same name who led the successful conquest of Britain under Claudius. Aulus Plautus Major was married to a woman called Pomponia Graecina who was Tiberius’ first wifes (Vipsania) granddaughter to another husband. He was therefore distantly related to the imperial family, though not in a significant way. In this sense he would have had the respect of the army. Agrippina appears to be proposing that she is the one who can make and unmake emperors.\n\nquestions\n\nWhat is the evidence that Agrippina was involved in a plot?\n\nWhat might Agrippina have hoped to achieve? ​\n\nAgrippina's lovers\n\nGaius her brother (Dio)\n\nAemilius Lepidus her sisters husband (Tac.

In 54CE Nero became princep, and there is a case to be made that her power was opposed immediately. The year of the beginning of her fall from poser is generally considered to be 55CE, in 59CE she was assassinated by Nero with the help of Seneca and Burrus.\n\nThe over-watchful, over-critical eye that Agrippina kept on whatever Nero said or did proved more than he could stand.\n\n-Suetonius\n\nSo she (Poppaea) nagged and mocked him incessantly. He was under the guardian’s thumb, she said - master neither of the empire nor of himself....\n\n“If Agrippina can only tolerate daughters-in-law who hate her son, let me be Otho’s wife again!”\n\n- Tacitus\n\nPoppaea Sabina was destined to achieve what the professional politicians of two reigns had not been able to do, namely the complete and final destruction of Agrippina.\n\n-Anthony A Barrett\n\nIn 59 Nero decided to kill his mother. We know too little about Nero’s psychological state to explain adequately the motivation for such a momentous act (which surely demands a psychological rather than a political explanation). It was a crisis, perhaps a turning point for the regime. One can only speculate that Nero was finding his mother an embarrassment: he could not restrain her political activities, nor fend off her interference and perhaps he feared her disapproval of his relationships.\n\n-Richard Alston\n\nmotives, manner and impact of her death\n\nSuetonius and Tacitus relate the details of Agrippina’s death. These are our primary sources for the incident. Consider them carefully.\n\nAt last terrified by her violence and threats, he determined to have her life, and after thrice attempting it by poison and finding that she had made herself immune by antidotes, he tampered with the ceiling of her bedroom, contriving a mechanical device for loosening its panels and dropping them upon her while she slept. When this leaked out through some of those connected with the plot, he devised a collapsible boat,to destroy her by shipwreck or by the falling in of its cabin. Then he pretended a reconciliation and invited her in a most cordial letter to come to Baiae and celebrate the feast of Minervawith him. On her arrival, instructing his captains to wreck the galley in which she had come, by running into it as if by accident, he detained her at a banquet,and when she would return to Bauli, offered her his contrivance in place of the craft which had been damaged, escorting her to it in high spirits and even kissing her breasts as they parted.\n\nThe rest of the night he passed sleepless in intense anxiety, awaiting the outcome of his design. On learning that everything had gone wrong and that she had escaped by swimming, driven to desperation he secretly had a dagger thrown down beside her freedman Lucius Agermus, when he joyfully brought word that she was safe and sound, and then ordered that the freedman be seized and bound, on the charge of being hired to kill the emperor; that his mother be put to death, and the pretence made that she had escaped the consequences of her detected guilt by suicide.\n\nTrustworthy authorities add still more gruesome details: that he hurried off to view the corpse, handled her limbs, criticizing some and commending others, and that becoming thirsty meanwhile, he took a drink. Yet he could not either then or ever afterwards endure the stings of conscience, though soldiers, senate and people tried to hearten him with their congratulations; for he often owned that he was hounded by his mother's ghost and by the whips and blazing torches of the Furies.\n\n-Suetonius\n\nAnicetus then surrounded the house with a guard, and having burst open the gates, dragged off the slaves who met him, till he came to the door of her chamber, where a few still stood, after the rest had fled in terror at the attack. A small lamp was in the room, and one slave-girl with Agrippina, who grew more and more anxious, as no messenger came from her son, not even Agerinus, while the appearance of the shore was changed, a solitude one moment, then sudden bustle and tokens of the worst catastrophe. As the girl rose to depart, she exclaimed, ‘Do you too forsake me?’ and looking round saw Anicetus, who had with him the captain of the trireme, Herculeius, and Obaritus, a centurion of marines. ‘If’, said she, ‘you have come to see me, take back word that I have recovered, but if you are here to do a crime, I believe nothing about my son; he has not ordered his mother's murder’. The assassins closed in round her couch, and the captain of the trireme first struck her head violently with a club. Then, as the centurion bared his sword for the fatal deed, presenting her person, she exclaimed, ‘Smite my womb’, and with many wounds she was slain.\n\nSo far our accounts agree. That Nero gazed on his mother after her death and praised her beauty, some have related, while others deny it. Her body was burnt that same night on a dining couch, with a mean funeral; nor, as long as Nero was in power, was the earth raised into a mound, or even decently closed. Subsequently, she received from her slaves, a humble sepulchre on the road to Misenum, near the country house of Caesar the dictator, which from a great height commands a view of the bay beneath. As soon as the funeral pyre was lighted, one of her freedmen, surnamed Mnester, ran himself through with a sword, either from love of his mistress or from the fear of destruction. Many years before Agrippina had anticipated this end for herself and had spurned the thought. For when she consulted the astrologers about Nero, they replied that he would be emperor and kill his mother. ‘Let him kill her’, she said, ‘provided he is emperor’\n\nHe even revived the charges of a period long past, how she had aimed at a share of empire, and at inducing the praetorian cohorts to swear obedience to a woman, to the disgrace of the Senate and people; how, when she was disappointed, in her fury with the soldiers, the Senate, and the populace, she opposed the usual donative and largess, and organised perilous prosecutions against distinguished citizens. What efforts had it cost him to hinder her from bursting into the Senate-house and giving answers to foreign nations! He glanced too with indirect censure at the days of Claudius, and ascribed all the abominations of that reign to his mother, thus seeking to show that it was the State's good fortune which had destroyed her. For he actually told the story of the ship wreck; but who could be so stupid as to believe that it was accidental, or that a shipwrecked woman had sent one man with a weapon to break through an emperor's guards and fleets?\n\n-Tacitus\n\nquestions\n\nList the attempts made by Nero on his mother’s life.\n\nHow did the soldiers, senate and people of Rome respond to her murder and what does this tell us about her?\n\nTacitus relates that when Nero’s lover Poppaea Sabina taunted him about his mother's domineering influence over him he finally decided on murdering his mother, and she no longer held any power over him. However modern historian A. T. Barrett asserts that even when she was removed from the palace and had been abandoned by her friends she was still powerful to have her opponents punished. And she commanded influence over the imperial guard right up to her death as in 59 when Nero makes his final move to kill her he is obliged to use men from the imperial fleet as the praetorians are still loyal to Germanicus' daughter.\n\nAfter her death:\n\nThere is little physical memory of Agrippina beyond representations on coins, the occasional cameo, statues and the occasional relief such as the Sebasteion at Aphrodisias.\n\nNo political groups were formed to resurrect her reputation after her death.\n\nSubsequent emperors, such as Vespasian (AD 69-79) made no efforts to commemorate her life and achievements. Roman writers merely succeeded in blackening her name.\n\nThe only evidence we have of Agrippina being remembered can be found during the reign of Trajan (AD 98-117). A head of Agrippina was discovered in Trajan’s forum. This may have been put in place to support Trajan’s claims to honour family members.\n\nWhen she died she was still powerful and the writ of her patronage ran far and wide...This was the ultimate legacy of her death. In the end Nero could neither rule with her nor without her.\n\n-Bill Leadbetter, 1997, The Ambition of Agrippina the Younger\n\nimpact of her personality on her roles & public image\n\nPublic image is the way in which someone is perceived - much of this image can be cultivated through coins, busts, statues and edicts, however in the case of Agrippina her public image probably suffered damnatio memoriae at a number of points in her life:\n\nDuring her family's public persecution at the instigation of Sejanus and Tiberius\n\nAt her exile under Gaius in 39CE\n\nIn the period of her downfall from 55CE and after her assassination in 59CE\n\nHowever, throughout her life and career Agrippina cultivated a public image for herself not just as an appendage of a significant male in her life but also independently based on her own personality. The sheer number of coins, busts, statues and reliefs of Agrippina from Rome and the empire reflect her high profile in the Julio Claudian period.\n\nGaius:\n\nAgrippina first appeared on the reverse of a coin minted during the reign of her brother Gaius –she was portrayed as a personification of Securitas – Rome’s security and stability\n\nClaudius:\n\nShe was noticeably absent from affairs in the period after her recall by Claudius until after the death of Messalina\n\nAfter her marriage to Claudius, she was shown with her head draped, a symbol of piety, or wearing a crown of wheat, an association with Demeter/ceres, goddess of fertility, prosperity and abundance.\n\nHer official portraits and busts resemble Germanicus (Susan Wood)\n\nThe Gemma Claudia reinforces her links to Agrippina and Germanicus\n\nIn the latter part of Claudius’ reign, Agrippina appeared on the obverse of coins together with Claudius, symbolising her partnership with him.\n\nThe title of Augusta appeared in the legend of some of her coins.\n\nShe appears in the Sebasteion Reliefs as Claudius’ partner​\n\nClaudius mint- Dupondus. 42CE.
