        "text": "In this twelve-part series based on the novels I, Claudius and Claudius The God by Robert Graves, the aging Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus, fourth emperor of the Roman Empire, writes his memoirs recalling his life as a member of the imperial family during the reigns of the first three emperors—his grandfather Augustus, his uncle Tiberius, and his nephew Caligula—and how he finally became emperor himself, in spite of his stammer, tics, lameness and reputation as a half-wit and a fool. This guide contains short synopses of the episodes, along with remarks concerning the series, the novels from which the series was adapted, as well as discussions of the history on which the overall story is based.\n\nThe Episodes\n\nEp. 1: “A Touch of Murder” Ep. 2: “Waiting In The Wings”\n\nEp. 3: “What Shall We Do About Claudius?” Ep.4: “Poison Is Queen”\n\nEp. 5: “Some Justice” Ep. 6: “Queen of Heaven”\n\nEp. 7: “Reign of Terror” Ep, 8: “Zeus, By Jove!”\n\nEp. 9: “Hail Who?” Ep. 10: “Fool’s Luck”\n\nEp. 11: “A God In Colchester” Ep. 12: “Old King Log”\n\nGeneral remarks on the novel, the series and the historical background\n\nThe imperial family / Robert Graves / Dramatizing I, Claudius / Other dramatizations / Is I, Claudius history? / The historical Claudius / Suggestions for further reading\n\nNote: In the first broadcast of I, Claudius, and in the YouTube uploads of the episodes I used as reference when writing this guide, the first night’s episode combined two episodes: “A Touch of Murder” and “Family Affairs.” The total airtime and broadcast schedule was twelve nights for a total of thirteen hours of airtime. Therefore my synopsis/discussion treats episodes 1a and 1b as one episode.\n\nEpisode 1: “A Touch of Murder”\n\nThe aging emperor Claudius begins to write his memoirs, beginning with the reign of his grandfather Augustus, whose nephew Marcellus, whom he had been grooming as a successor, dies after a suspicious illness. His wife Livia engineers her son (and Augustus’ stepson) Tiberius’ marriage to Augustus’ daughter Julia, and Tiberius’ brother Drusus dies in Germany, also in a suspicious fashion, leaving a wife, Antonia, a daughter, Livilla, and sons Germanicus and Claudius.\n\nEpisode Notes: The first episode establishes the narrative framework as Claudius, in old age, begins work on his history, which unfolds in flashback and which in most episodes opens and closes with Claudius at his desk over his manuscript. Before beginning the story, Claudius tells of his trip to Cumae (a Greek colony near Naples) to consult an oracle called the Sibyl, concerning Rome’s fate and his own; part of the Sibyl’s reply implies that though cursed with a stammer, he is fated to speak clearly in some nineteen-hundred years, which he interprets as a charge to write the truth as he knows it. His narrative and his thoughts are conveyed in voice-over, but he does break the fourth wall briefly as he empties a chest to receive his manuscript and speaks to us—his “remote posterity.” The main characters for the first half of the series are also introduced here: Augustus, Livia, Julia, Tiberius, and Antonia.\n\nWhile in future episodes the negative aspects of Tiberius’ personality will be shown in great detail, this opening episode takes care to impress on the viewer his struggle with depression, which humanizes the character and furnishes part of a more complex motivation. George Baker’s scene with Ian Ogilvy as his brother Drusus has much pathos as he communicates his depressive episodes to a sympathetic and affectionate ear. Claudius’ mother Antonia enters as a woman committed to the ancient Roman virtues, while Julia is very much the opposite, contrasting Antonia’s frosty hauteur with a sensual languor and a frank enjoyment of physical pleasure.\n\nCast: Derek Jacobi (Claudius) Brian Blessed (Augustus), Siân Phillips (Livia), George Baker (Tiberius), Ian Ogilvy (Drusus), Margaret Tyzack (Antonia), Frances White (Julia), Christopher Guard (Marcellus), John Paul (Marcus Agrippa). Note: to avoid unnecessary repetition, cast listings here denote the first appearance of actors and characters in the series.\n\nContents\n\nEpisode 2: “Waiting In The Wings”\n\nAugustus exiles Tiberius to the island of Rhodes for abusing his wife Julia, while Livia digs up dirt on Julia’s promiscuity and Augustus’ adopted sons Gaius and Lucius die mysteriously.\n\nEpisode Notes: This episode marks the first appearances (as children) of Claudius, his siblings Livilla and Germanicus, his cousins Agrippina and Postumus, and his lifelong friend Herod Agrippa. Already Claudius’ infirmities have made him a object of dislike and disdain among his family: a foreshadowing of Claudius’ fate appears when he catches a wolf-cub that had been carried off by an eagle, which the venerable senator Gnaeus Domitius interprets as an omen that one day Claudius will protect Rome. Livia begins to show her steel here as the villainess of the piece, and Tiberius, melancholic, cynical, and reluctant vessel for his mother’s ambitions, also shows his casual brutality when he threatens to have his astrologer Thrasyllus thrown off of a cliff.\n\nIt will be noted that neither Graves’ novels nor the series are forgiving of upper-class women who commit adultery. In characters such as Livilla (episode 7), Messalina (episode 10-11) and Agrippinilla (episode 12), sexual promiscuity is closely associated with a willingness to connive and plot for power. Most of the ancient biographers and historians appear to have had the same attitude, and its political implications will be discussed later. Julia is something of an exception: she is genuinely fond of sex and of physical pleasure generally (shown in the series by a fondness for snacking), and is utterly uninterested in politics or in the imperial succession. She is, however, the daughter of Augustus, and Livia has deemed it politically expedient for Tiberius to divorce his wife Vipsania (whom he loves) and marry Julia in order to place him closer to the imperial succession. But when Tiberius, who still misses his ex-wife and dislikes Julia intensely, is exiled by Augustus for his mistreatment and neglect of Julia, Julia is left with no other outlet for her sexual urges than her adulterous affairs.\n\nWhile Augustus’ harsh punishment for Julia’s frequent and flagrant adulterous behavior is clearly painful to him personally, it was necessitated by political concerns. In 18 CE he enacted moral legislation promoting marriage and family and setting penalties for women who committed adultery: the lex Iulia de adulteriis provided that a husband had the legal right to punish his adulterous wife and her lover by killing them both; in practice this was used only sparingly and judiciously, and usually adultery only led to divorce, with the wronged husband keeping a token portion of his ex-wife’s dowry. As his promotion of marriage and family was intended to part to protect the rights of the paterfamilias and by extension his own position of authority as “father” of the nation, his daughter’s behavior was a deep political embarrassment to him as well as a moral one, forcing him to make a very public example of her.\n\nCast: Simon MacCorkindale (Lucius), Darien Angadi (Plautius), Ashley Knight (Young Claudius), Kevin Stoney (Thrasyllus), Esmond Knight (Domitius), Michael Clements (Young Herod)\n\nContents\n\nEpisode 3: “What Shall We Do About Claudius?”\n\nAugustus’ armies east of the Rhine are massacred; his adopted son Postumus carries on an affair with Livia’s granddaughter Livilla. Claudius, beginning his study of history, meets the great historians Livy and Pollio, makes his first embarrassing appearance in public, and gets married. Livia, discovering Livilla’s affair, convinces her to turn the tables on Postumus, who secretly warns Claudius of Livia’s secret machinations.\n\nEpisode notes: Claudius makes his entrance into the story as a young man studying history: and his character’s devotion to the truth is established, as well as the embarrassing figure he cuts with his family. He runs into two famous historians, Livy and Asinius Pollio, and from the latter he learns that his work on a biography of his father and grandfather, both republicans, will most likely be stopped by his family (which turns out to be the case) and also that his reputation as a fool is probably his best protection, a piece of advice echoed by Postumus, who along with his brother Germanicus and Herod, number among his closest friends.\n\nThe historical background: Claudius’ early dedication to literary work would have been in keeping with someone born in a wealthy and aristocratic family, and especially with one to whom a career in the military or in politics or public service would have been closed by his delicate health and the embarrassment of his physical afflictions. But even for men of action, a devotion to literature and the arts was considered a mark of distinction: Julius Caesar’s account of his campaigns in Gaul and Southern Britain, Commentarii de Bello Gallico, was widely praised for its style, and has ever since been used as a text for beginning Latin students. Augustus and Tiberius were also devoted to literary and scholarly pursuits in their spare time.\n\nGaius Asinius Pollio, in addition to being a historian (his works are lost but were used as source material in later works by Appian and Plutarch), was also a poet, playwright, orator, politician, soldier, and partisan of Julius Caesar during the period of the Civil Wars. He moved in the same literary circles as Catullus, was a patron of Virgil, and a friend of Horace. He also established a public library and art gallery at Rome after the Civil Wars and devoted his time to promoting the arts. Livy (Titus Livius) did not spend as much time in public service as Pollio, but beginning in his early thirties devoted himself to the writing of his History of Rome (Ab Urbe Condita Libri, literally, “Books Since the Foundation of the City”), a work comprising 142 volumes (of which roughly a quarter has survived) beginning with the traditional founding of Rome in around 763 BCE and ending with the reign of Augustus to about 9 BCE. From the appearance of its first volumes the work was wildly popular, in part because of its patriotic and conservative attachment to the ancient Roman values and virtues and reverential depiction of beloved national figures. In the books and the series the two historians are shown as amicable rivals, interested in young Claudius’ opinion of their respective work: his answer—that he appreciates Livy for his literary style and Pollio for his veracity of facts—pleases neither.\n\nThe disastrous defeat of Rome’s armies in Germany is referred to as the Battle of the Teutoberg Forest (in what is now Osnabrück County in Lower Saxony), and by Roman historians as the Varian Disaster. In 9 CE, three legions and their auxiliaries, led by Publius Quinctilius Varus, were ambushed and destroyed by an alliance of Germanic tribes, led by Arminius, a German who spent his youth in Rome as a hostage, held Roman citizenship and an equestrian rank, and had a Roman education, including military education, which gave him insight into Roman military tactics and practices. The debacle has been called Rome’s greatest defeat and prompted a change in policy towards the tribal peoples of Germany: the Rhine remained the Empire’s easternmost border for the rest of the Empire’s existence, and Arminius (or Hermann) has remained for Germans a symbol of national pride. Cassius Chaerea, who will figure later in the series, was one of the few Roman officers to survive the massacre.\n\nThe final scene in this episode concerning Claudius’ wedding is all we will see of his first wife, who is only referred to as “Claudius’ Bride” in the cast listings in the closing credits, but who is known as Urgulanilla in the novels and as Plautia Urgulanilla to Suetonius and Tacitus. She is mentioned only once more in the series and that mainly in passing, as Claudius mentions that he is divorcing her for bearing a child that is not his. Further mentions of her in the book do not figure in the plot of the series.\n\nCast: Patricia Quinn (Livilla), David Robb (Germanicus), Fiona Walker (Agrippina), John Castle (Postumus), Norman Shelley (Horace), James Faulkner (Herod), Kevin McNally (Castor), Guy Slater (Courier) Donald Eccles (Pollio), Denis Carey (Livy), Jennifer Croxton (Claudius’ Bride [Urgulanilla])\n\nContents\n\nEpisode 4: “Poison Is Queen”\n\nClaudius tells Germanicus, newly returned from a now-pacified Germany, his suspicions of Livia’s role in the fates of Marcellus, Gaius and Lucius, Julia and Postumus; Augustus visits Postumus in his place of exile and reaches out to him, promising to make amends. Livia suspects that Augustus knows something. and convinces the Chief Vestal to show her his will, which is stored in the Vestals’ cloisters. Augustus suddenly falls ill and dies, in spite of the strict diet he imposes on himself, and when his will is read out to the senate, it appears that Tiberius is his main heir.\n\nEpisode notes: Livia’s ambition to see her son Tiberius become emperor comes to fruition in this episode, but we also see the toll her ambitions have taken on her emotionally; earlier, her actions were directed almost exclusively against members of Augustus’ family, people she was not inclined to feel close to: now the final obstacle to her ambition is her own husband, and her struggle with her conscience is written on the goblets of wine she quaffs. Brian Blessed takes his bow in this episode; although he would become famous mainly for his booming-voiced, lusty portrayals of larger-than-life characters, he portrays Augustus in this series as soft-spoken and sensitive, likable and avuncular, often sentimental, and affectionate towards his family. This episode also sees the first appearance of Patrick Stewart as commander of the Praetorian Guards (the Emperors’ private troops), Lucius Aelius Sejanus, whose loyalty to Tiberius and willingness to assist in his rule will mask his own private ambition.\n\nThe historical background: The Vestals (Vestales) or Vestal virgins, were a college of priestesses of Vesta, goddess of the hearth. The order was reportedly founded by the king Numa Pompilius around the eighth century BCE, and their chief task was to maintain the sacred flame that burned in the temple of Vesta, which was regarded as crucial to the safety and security of Rome. They were committed to thirty-year terms of service during which they observed strict celibacy, after which they usually retired with a pension and were allowed to marry. Their persons, temple, and cloisters being considered sacrosanct and inviolable, and their characters above reproach, they were often entrusted with guarding important documents and objects, such as Augustus’ will, which Livia inveigles the Chief Vestal into taking a look at. The College of Vestals was dissolved, and their sacred fire extinguished, by order of the Christian emperor Theodosius I.\n\nThe historical Augustus: Augustus (full name as emperor: Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus) was born Gaius Octavius Thurinus in Rome on September 23, 63 BCE, into a wealthy equestrian branch of the Octavii. He is referred to by historians as Octavius during the period of his life between his birth and his adoption as son and heir, in 44 BCE, by his maternal granduncle, the dictator Julius Caesar, after which he took, in accordance with Roman custom, the name of his adoptive father, and became known as Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus. He is usually referred to by historians during this period of his life, which includes his military campaigns against Julius’ assassins and his consolidation of power, as Octavianus or more commonly, Octavian. He was awarded the honorific title Augustus, among others, by vote of the senate in 27 BCE, and during the balance of his life, during which he reigned as the first emperor of the Roman Empire, until his death in 14 CE, he is generally referred to by that name.\n\nThe assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BCE reignited civil war, and Octavian formed the “second triumvirate” with Marc Antony and Marcus Lepidus to defeat the assassins of Caesar, achieving decisive victory at Phillipi in 42, but the triumvirate proved fractious due to the triumvirs’ competing ambitions. Lepidus was driven into exile and Antony was defeated at Actium by Octavian in 31, after which he committed suicide, leaving Octavian to lead the empire on his own.\n\nRoman resistance to the idea of royal rule was proverbial ever since the overthrow of Rome’s last king and the establishment of the Roman Republic in 509 BCE, and Augustus reconstituted the forms and practices of republican government, while retaining autocratic power through command of the army and through the holding of a number of life offices, including censor and tribune. He was also given the title princeps civitatis, which can be translated as “first citizen” or, preceded by princeps senatus, as “first among senators, first among citizens,” underlining an intention not to be seen as a despot or tyrant, but one whose rule depends on the due permission of the senate, and from which we derive the term principate, the term for the form of the Roman state from Augustus to Diocletian. From that time on, the Roman state began to resemble a more straightforward type of monarchy and is referred to as the dominate.\n\nHistorians view the reign of Augustus with ambiguity: he fought long and hard for power and was ambitious, ruthless, and sometimes devious in protecting his power. But he was also intensely patriotic, public-spirited, and hard-working. While he fashioned an autocracy with the outward façade of a republic, he also ruled efficiently and justly, and with an apparently sincere commitment to the responsibilities of his position and to the well-being of his people. He abolished private tax farming, entrusting the gathering of state revenue to a staff of salaried civil servants, as well as reforming the governance of the provinces. He built, or had built, many public works and beautified the city, leading to the adage that he found a Rome built of bricks and left a Rome of marble. He cultivated relationships with client kingdoms and laid the groundwork for a two-century-long Pax Romana, only broken by the power vacuum left by the fall of Nero in 69 and the ensuing “year of the four emperors” (this Roman peace being understood as the absence of internal power struggles and civil war and not necessarily including wars of territorial conquest).\n\nWhile even during his lifetime Augustus had his critics, few if any of these ever doubted or impugned his personal character. Ruthless as he was in achieving power, he was also known for his political acumen, his promotion of the rule of law, and his respect and sensitivity in his relationships with the senate, whom he treated not as subjects but as colleagues.\n\nIn person Augustus is usually depicted as approachable and even somewhat folksy, fond of catchphrases such as “the knee is nearer than the shin” (meaning that concerns closer to one are generally more urgent than ones that are farther away), “a radish may know no Greek, but I do,” in other words, “I am no fool,” and “quick as boiled asparagus,” meaning of course, very quick indeed.\n\nHe achieved a form of governance that benefited the state and people of Rome and the empire in many ways, but also one that depended much on the personal character and abilities of the ruler to whom the imperial authority was entrusted. The ancient sources, Graves’ novels, and the series all imply that Tiberius attempted but failed to meet the high level of competencc of his predecessor while resenting the responsibilities of his office, that Caligula simply treated his power as a plaything to enjoy, and that Claudius doggedly attempted to perform his duties to the best of his ability while never quite being able to gain the whole-hearted respect and trust of the senate or the people.\n\nCast: Patrick Stewart (Sejanus), Jonathan Burn (Fabius), Carol Gillies (Camilla, the Chief Vestal)\n\nContents\n\nEpisode 5: “Some Justice”\n\nTiberius succeeds the late Augustus as emperor, and Germanicus dies in Syria. The Roman mob protests the death of the beloved Germanicus, and his widow Agrippina suspects witchcraft and poisoning, and particularly the former governor of Syria, Calpurnius Piso, and his wife Plancina, working at the tacit bidding of Tiberius. Agrippina, along with Claudius, Herod, and other close friends decide to try Piso and Plancina in the senate, where they hope they can also implicate Tiberius in the conspiracy. Piso hopes that Tiberius will exonerate him and his wife, but Tiberius is convinced by his chief spy and political “fixer” Sejanus that the best course is to let them be convicted before they can touch Tiberius. Meanwhile, Agrippina’s young son Caligula shows ominous signs of his future character.\n\nEpisode Notes: A detailed web of plots concerning Claudius and his friends’ attempts to rely on Roman justice and their thwarting by Tiberius’ network of spies also shows Piso and Plancina as a loving couple torn apart and destroyed by mutual guilt and by suspicion of each other, while Sejanus’ power as Tiberius’ henchman is established.\n\nCast: Stratford Johns (Piso), Irene Hamilton (Plancina), Patsy Byrne (Martina), Robert Morgan (Young Caligula)\n\nEpisode 6: “Queen of Heaven”\n\nAs Tiberius continues to reign as emperor, his reputation as a vicious lecher increases, as well as his dependence on Sejanus for advice and for action against his political enemies. Sejanus conducts an affair with Livilla and they plot to poison Castor and marry. Sejanus talks Claudius into divorcing his wife and marrying Sejanus’ sister Aelia, thereby augmenting his own power by becoming a member of the imperial family. And in exchange for her telling him the truth about her crimes, Claudius promises the dying Livia to do all he can to see that she is deified after her death, as her late husband was deified, and thereby avoid the eternal punishment she fears.\n\nEpisode Notes: Siân Phillips’ performance as Livia comes to an end with this episode with an affecting frailty and pathos.\n\nThe historical Livia: Livia was born Livia Drusilla in 58 BCE and died in 29 CE. She was first married around 43 BCE to Tiberius Claudius Nero (85-33 BCE). Her family were partisans of the assassins of Julius Caesar against Octavian (later Augustus), and around 40 BCE she and her husband fled Italy to avoid the proscriptions of the triumvirate of Octavian, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Marc Antony, joining Sextus Pompeius (son of Pompey the Great), who was fighting the triumvirate from Sicily. She and her family returned to Rome when peace was made and an amnesty declared between the triumvirate and the followers of Pompeius, and was introduced to Octavian in 39. Octavian divorced his wife Scribonia and married Livia in a matter of days in the month of January of that year. By this time Livia had had two sons with Tiberius Claudius Nero, one of whom, also named Tiberius Claudius Nero, became the second Emperor. Legend had it that Octavian had fallen in love with Livia at first sight, but it is more likely that Octavian considered the patrician Claudians important to his cause, and that the Neronian branch of the Claudians considered the marriage vital to their political survival. After having gradually enhanced his power while appearing to respect the forms and institutions of the Roman republic, Octavian was given the title “Augustus” and the office of princeps around 27 BCE by the senate.\n\nOddly enough for such tempestuous beginnings, Livia and Augustus remained married for 51 years, and Livia enjoyed unprecedented status as adviser to Augustus, and was influential in Roman politics. She also established a public image as a Roman matron, frugal, modest and virtuous. She continued to enjoy a high political status after Augustus’ death and Tiberius’ accession, and in fact, was able to shield two close friends, Urgulania (grandmother of Claudius’ first wife Urgulanilla) and Munatia Plancina (see episode 5) from the courts, Urgulania from a lawsuit, and Plancina from accusations of murder in the case of the death of Germanicus. It was suggested by Tacitus and Dio Cassius that her son Tiberius had relocated to Capri in part because of his resentment of her interference in his rule. When she died, Tiberius pleaded the pressure of work for not returning to Rome and reportedly sent Caligula to deliver the funeral oration in his place. He vetoed many honors the senate voted to bestow upon her, including the title of Mater Patriae (mother of the fatherland), and divine honors, as well as canceling the implementation of her will. It remained for her grandson Claudius to restore her honors and to complete the process of deification, after which she was named Diva Augusta (the Divine Augusta).\n\nThe charges of poisoning made against Livia in Robert Graves’ book and in the series were rumors, noted and repeated by Tacitus and Dio Cassius, but it must also be noted that virtually all possible routes to accession by a member of Augustus’ family were closed, leaving the field clear to accession by Tiberius. Augustus’ nephew Marcellus died in 23 BCE, the two eldest sons of Augustus’ daughter Julia by Marcus Agrippa, whom Augustus had adopted as sons and heirs, also died, and the remaining son Agrippa Postumus, was exiled to an island and finally killed. Julia, whose exile may have been for her role in a revolt led by a previous husband, Paullus, rather than adultery, also died in exile.\n\nCast: John Hurt (Caligula), Isabel Dean (Lollia), Edward Jewesbury (Titus), Aubrey Richards (Varro), Peter Williams (Silius Caecina), Karin Foley (Helen)\n\nEpisode 7: “Reign of Terror”\n\nFree of the control of his mother Livia, Tiberius has retired to the island of Capri and leaves the day-to-day running of the empire to Sejanus, who continues to connive at enhancing his own power, eliminating opponents on trumped-up charges and attempting to enter the imperial family by marriage, either to his lover Livilla or to her daughter Helen, and eventually to replace Tiberius himself. Antonia discovers Livilla and Sejanus’ role in the death of Castor and finds incriminating evidence which she has Claudius smuggle to Tiberius in a copy of his latest historical work. From Capri, Tiberius follows the advice of Caligula in dealing with the problem, and a bloodbath follows.\n\nEpisode Notes: Sejanus’ ignominious exit marks the end of Patrick Stewart’s appearance in the series. Although having been quite busy in stage, television, and some film for a decade, Stewart would not find himself a household name for another decade until he played Captain Jean-Luc Picard in the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation.\n\nThis series was, for its time, quite frank in its depiction of sex and violence, and while this episode is less lurid or explicit than others, it is nevertheless quite emotionally devastating with its depictions of political terror, which evoke more modern associations of state torture, coups d’état, death squads, mass executions and purges, and give a vivid sense, as the episode closes, of an entire society losing its moral compass.\n\nAntonia’s response to Livilla’s affair with Sejanus (and her involvement in his plans to usurp Tiberius’ power) echoes Augustus’ harsh punishment of Julia in episode 2.\n\nCast: Liane Aukin (Aelia), Charles Kay (Asinius Gallus), John Rhys-Davies (Macro), Kate Lansbury (Apicata)\n\nContents\n\nEpisode 8: “Zeus, By Jove!”\n\nOn the death of Tiberius (helped along somewhat by new guards captain Macro, who replaced Sejanus in the previous episode), Caligula is automatically hailed by the senate as emperor. He also accepts their offer to serve as consul for the next term, and he chooses Claudius as co-consul. Almost as quickly as he becomes emperor, he falls ill, and after recovering from a coma goes mad, deciding that he is the god Zeus and that his sister Drusilla, with whom he has an openly incestuous relationship, is the goddess Hera. Claudius is at first hopeful that everyone will see that Caligula is mad, lock him up, and restore the republic, but instead Caligula, who began by making grandiose promises of a clean sweep after Tiberius’ reign and Sejanus’ political terror, is indulged by a fawning senate, which elects him as consul, while he appoints Claudius as co-consul, Claudius’ first official political office. Caligula’s co-heir, Tiberius’ grandson Gemellus, an unhealthy boy afflicted with a cough, is eliminated by Macro on Caligula’s orders, and after his funeral Antonia matter-of-factly tells Claudius that she has settled her affairs and will commit suicide that evening, after which Claudius finds that Caligula’s delusions of divinity have taken a turn for the worse.\n\nEpisode Notes: This episode represents the series at its most Gothic in atmosphere. John Hurt delivers a camp performance that gives the same suggestion as the novel does of the comical quality of Caligula’s delusions of divinity, only to slam the viewer with some well-chosen bits of shock. The climactic final scene concerned with Drusilla’s fate diverges from that in the novel, wherein, in closer accordance with the ancient record, Drusilla died after a long illness, after which an extended period of public mourning was decreed by Caligula. Some shots in the final scene were edited out after the series’ first broadcast due to their graphic nature, and are now apparently lost.\n\nThe historical Tiberius: Tiberius (name as emperor: Tiberius Caesar Divi Augusti Filius Augustus) was born Tiberius Claudius Nero in Rome in 42 BCE to Livia Drusilla and Tiberius Claudius Nero, who died when Tiberius was nine years old. By that time Livia had already divorced his father and married Octavian (later Augustus), making Tiberius Octavian’s stepson. Tiberius’ stepfather steered him into politics and public service at a young age, obtaining for him at the age of seventeen a position as quaestor, an office that had different functions at different times in Roman history and was also the first rung on the ladder of Roman public service. He, along with his brother Drusus, was also given the right to stand for election as praetor and consul five years ahead of the age prescribed by law. His military career began at age 21, when he was sent east under the command of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. He distinguished himself as general with the conquest of Pannonia and Dalmatia (located in what is today Hungary, Austria, and the Balkans), and Raetia (located in what is now Switzerland), as well as the temporary conquest of parts of what is now Germany. He continued to advance in political rank, being granted tribunician powers and serving as consul two times, but in 6 BCE, he withdrew from politics and retired to the Greek island of Rhodes. The series implies his stay in Rhodes was forcible exile on the part of Augustus, but the exact motives for his removal there are not clear, and he apparently came to regret his decision, writing to Augustus a number of times to be allowed to return to Rome and being refused before Augustus allowed him to return, but as a private citizen only.\n\nAugustus’ delays and conflicting decisions on the question of imperial succession are the subject of the first three episodes of the series and will not be summarized here. Suffice it to say that Tiberius was adopted as son and heir in 4 CE by Augustus (after which he took the name Tiberius Julius Caesar) and became emperor on Augustus’ death in 14.\n\nFrom the start, Tiberius seems to have been reluctant, even resistant, to accepting the honors and responsibilities of emperor; he refused the titles and honors that would have most validated his position publicly, that is, the titles of Pater Patriae, Imperator, and Augustus, as well as the Civic Crown and laurels, although he accepted the powers associated with them readily enough. These refusals were seen as standoffish and obstructive by the senate, and he never gained the esteem of the senators. He eventually seemed to tire of politics altogether, especially after the death of his son Drusus, spending increasingly long sojourns in Campania and finally retiring to Capri, an island south of Naples and east of Sorrento, in 26 CE. He had increasingly depended on the assistance of Praetorian prefect Lucius Aelius Sejanus for the day-to-day duties of running the empire, and when Tiberius’ mother Livia, who remained an influential figure in Roman politics, finally died in 29, Sejanus became the important link between Tiberius in Capri and the government in Rome, able to control what Tiberius communicated to Rome and vice versa. A series of purge trials began in which senators and wealthy equestrians, and anyone else capable of opposing Tiberius, were removed, after which Sejanus, who rose to co-consulship with Tiberius in 31, was himself accused of plotting to overthrow Tiberius and executed on treason charges, his position as Praetorian prefect assumed by Naevius Sutorius Macro.\n\nMeanwhile, Tiberius stayed in Capri while his image and reputation crumbled in Rome. Suetonius’ lurid picture of a sexually perverse and paranoid Tiberius debauching himself at his island hideaway may be over the top, but it did reflect the attitude of the senate at the time towards him. After his death in 37 in Misenum at the age of 78, mobs in Rome were shouting for Tiberius’ corpse to be thrown into the Tiber, a disposal reserved for the bodies of criminals. Instead his body was cremated and the ashes quietly laid in the mausoleum built by Augustus for his family.\n\nTiberius was referred to by Pliny the Elder as tristissimus hominum or “the gloomiest of men”, and his apathy and disinterest in imperial rule have been interpreted as indicating depression and resentment of his position as emperor. Augustus’ successes depended on a wide range of talents and skills, a high level of energy, a capacity for hard work, confidence and charisma, and a strong internal moral compass—qualities that must have seemed at times superhuman, and Tiberius appears to have keenly felt himself deficient in the qualities needed to achieve success on the level of his predecessor. Tiberius was by no means untalented, as his success as a military officer attests, but his range of talents did not match that of Augustus, nor was he adept at commanding the love and respect of his people. Apparently feeling that he was in over his head as emperor, he withdrew from political life, content to let the state run itself without him as best it could.\n\nCast: Beth Morris (Drusilla), Jon Laurimore (Lentulus), Anne Dyson (Briseis), Arthur Whybrow (Stone Mason), Douglas Melbourne (Gemellus)\n\nContents\n\nEpisode 9: “Hail Who?”\n\nCaligula has married Caesonia, and fathered a daughter, Drusilla, and his behavior becomes more erratic and capricious—and paranoid. After attempting to make money by establishing a brothel in the palace, staffed by the wives of nobles, Caligula goes on campaign in Germany, where he imagines conspiracies among the senators and consuls, and himself at war with the god Neptune, and on his return marries Claudius (who is constantly the butt of Caligula’s jokes and pranks) to young and lovely Valeria Messalina, as part of an elaborate prank at Claudius’ expense. Meanwhile, Cassius Chaerea, a guards commander embittered by Caligula’s spiteful and derisive remarks, hatches a real plot against him.\n\nEpisode Notes: Much of the series’ reputation for strong content, including strong sexual content, comes from this particular episode, particularly the brothel sequence, which not only features nudity and suggestive dances but also a man passionately kissing another man in drag, giving that “how did they ever get away with that?” feeling to the episode.\n\nJohn Hurt’s combination of menace, comicality and camp peak in his bizarre dance performance, dressed as the goddess Dawn, with a terrified Marcus Vinicius, Asprenas and Claudius, all rousted out of bed in the middle of the night, as the only audience, convinced they are about to die only to be elaborately pranked. Claudius, who has learned how to handle Caligula’s madness by always playing the fool, has the presence of mind to appease Caligula by extravagantly praising his dance, and when asked if he really liked it, delivers one of the more amusing and memorable lines in the series: “It was in-d-d-d-describable!” And so it is. But it’s not all fun, as the event convinces Marcus and Asprenas that Caligula is only toying with them and steels them to come in with Chaerea’s conspiracy against the emperor’s life.\n\nCaligula’s joke at Claudius’ expense is rather a cruel one: he finds the idea of such a lovely and innocent maiden matched with a stammering cripple to be hysterically funny, and he expects both bride and groom to be humiliated. In fact, when speaking together in private, he apologizes to her for the cruelty of the joke, but is then genuinely moved by the apparent sincerity of her feelings, and falls in love almost immediately. His feelings for her will prove in time to be bitterly disappointed.\n\nThe historical Caligula: Caligula was born Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus (name as emperor: Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus) in 12 CE at Antium to Claudius’ brother Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder, and was nephew to Claudius and grand-nephew to Tiberius. His father was a military officer who avenged the Roman defeat in the battle of the Teutoberg Forest (see ep. 3), recovering two of the three eagles (the standards carried by the legions, so named for being topped with an eagle) lost in the defeat of Varus, which greatly redeemed Roman prestige and soothed the psychological pain of the original defeat. But it was also undertaken without Tiberius’ express permission and against Augustus’ advice that Roman dominion in that area should not cross the Rhine, which aroused suspicions in Tiberius about the motivations of Germanicus, who was popular with the people both for his military successes and for his personal charisma and virtue. Withdrawn from Germany and installed in the east, Germanicus was taken ill and died in Antioch, arousing suspicions of poison. His wife Agrippina and many of her family were exiled, later to die in mysterious circumstances, as a result of Tiberius’ paranoia and the treason trials of his adviser Sejanus.\n\nOn his campaigns in Germany, Germanicus brought his wife and children, who lived in camp with him. The soldiers in camp grew fond of his young son, giving him the nickname Caligula (“Little Boot”, from caliga, the boot worn by soldiers) from a little soldier’s outfit, complete with armor and boots, that was given to the child and that he liked to wear in camp. In adulthood he grew to dislike the nickname, and although he is best known to us today as “Caligula”, he was mainly known in his own time by his given name Gaius, and was referred to by that name in coinage, official documents, and biographical and historical writings.\n\nAfter the banishment of his mother and older brothers Nero and Drusus, Caligula and his sisters were remanded to the care and supervision of Tiberius and his soldiers. Caligula soon came to Capri to live with his granduncle Tiberius, where he lived for six years. In 33 CE Caligula was given an honorary quaestorship, a position he held until his elevation to emperor. He cultivated a relationship with Sejanus’ successor as prefect of the Praetorians, Naevius Sutorius Macro, in order to smooth his relations with Tiberius, who made Caligula his heir jointly with his cousin Tiberius Gemellus, who was the son of Tiberius’ own son Drusus (nicknamed Castor in the books and series, possibly to avoid confusion with Claudius’ own father, also named Drusus) and therefore Tiberius’ grandson, and still a youth.\n\nTiberius died on March 16, 37 CE at the age of 78, with some of the ancient writers claiming that he was murdered and others saying that he died of natural causes. Macro, who Tacitus claims smothered Tiberius with his pillow, backed Caligula, who inherited Tiberius’ titles and estate, and who had Tiberius’ will nullified with regard to Gemellus, though he adopted Gemellus as his son.\n\nCaligula was immensely popular with the people for the first six or seven months of his principate, in part due to his famous and beloved father and in part to the fact that he was not Tiberius, and he for his part ruled with every appearance of being a generous and just new broom. He declared an end to treason trials, destroying Tiberius’ treason papers and recalling many exiles to Rome, he granted bonuses to the military, made reparations to those harmed by the imperial tax system, and put on lavish celebrations. He published accounts of public funds, abolished certain taxes and expanded the rolls of the senatorial and equestrian orders.\n\nBut after the “honeymoon” of the first months of Caligula’s reign, it is said he fell seriously ill, either from a fever or from poison, and that after his recovery he became mad, and had his co-heir Gemellus executed (after having reportedly smelt medicine on Gemellus’ breath, which he was convinced was antidote for poison, but was actually a cough-mixture), after which he also had Macro executed as well.\n\nMany of the more lurid accounts of Caligula’s reign must be met with some skepticism, but historians do tend to agree that Caligula did seek greater personal power for the princeps without check from the senate, and that he was wildly extravagant. While he spent public money on public works such as buildings, temples and aqueducts, he also spent public money on himself, including two vast floating ships, one intended as a palace complete with marble floors and plumbing. The remains of this ship was discovered in the bed of Lake Nemi in Italy in the 1930s, only to be later destroyed during the Second World War.\n\nHe shared with his predecessor a lack of respect for the senate, and in 39 relations with the senate fell apart; the exact reasons for this feud remaining unclear, but after having made a show of doing away with treason trials early in his reign, Caligula revived investigations and trials of senators: this led to conspiracies against him, including the conspiracy with Cassius Chaerea (which included a number of others, including other Praetorians, courtiers, equestrians and senators) that succeeded in his assassination in CE 41. During this period Caligula annexed the kingdom of Mauretania (in what is now Morocco), formerly a client-kingdom of Rome, and turned it into two provinces, Mauretania Tingitana and Mauretania Caesariensis, reportedly by calling the king of Mauretania, Ptolemy, to Rome, and upon his arrival, having him executed.\n\nCaligula was assassinated on January 22nd (or January 24th, depending on the source), 41 CE, in an underground passage under the imperial palace, triggering a period of chaos in which Caligula’s loyal German guard, too late to have protected their master, began to take out their rage on the assassins, conspirators, innocent senators, and bystanders. Although the senate supported taking this opportunity to restore the republic and Chaerea attempted to convince the military to support the senate, a faction of the military still supported imperial rule, and after the murder of Caligula’s wife Milonia Caesonia and daughter Julia Drusilla, soldiers of this faction spirited away Claudius to their camp, where he procured the support of the military, likely through promises of financial reward.\n\nCast: Jo Rowbottom (Calpurnia), Sheila White (Messalina), Sam Dastor (Cassius Chaerea), Norman Eshley (Marcus Vinicius), Freda Dowie (Caesonia), James Fagan (Asprenas), Bernard Hill (Gratus)\n\nContents\n\nEpisode 10: “Fool’s Luck”\n\nAfter Caligula’s assassination, Claudius is declared emperor, much against his will, by the Praetorian Guards, and Herod Agrippa, now king of the Jews, convinces him that it will be safer for him, for his family, and for Rome to accept the position. After speaking to a delegation of senators, albeit with a contingent of Praetorians at his back, Claudius’ position as emperor is confirmed by the senate. Messalina eagerly works her way into Claudius’ confidence and then uses that confidence and her position as the emperor’s wife to attempt to seduce the staunchly republican senator Appius Silanus.\n\nEpisode Notes: What I know of the Roman biographers’ opinions regarding Claudius does not seem to have differed much from that of Appius Silanus in this episode: that he was stupid (or rather, pedantic, obtuse, and socially inept, rather than sub-par in intelligence) and as cruel and as capricious as his predecessors. Robert Graves in the novels, and this dramatization of it, attempt to show him in a more kindly light: decent, republican in political convictions, more naive than stupid, and only cruel because the circumstances demand it. He sentences Cassius Chaerea, who hatched the conspiracy against Caligula, to execution, not for his role in Caligula’s murder but because he also murdered Caligula’s wife and infant child, and had planned to murder Claudius and his wife, while excusing Cassius’ co-conspirators Marcus Vinicius and Asprenas because they opposed killing anyone but Caligula, and agreed, on that understanding, to cooperate with Chaerea. His dealings with Silanus echo his dealings with Caligula’s murderers. The dialogue in this series is full of foreshadowings, and Messalina’s comparison of herself and Claudius to Livia and Augustus foreshadows her character arc from demure maiden to manipulative wife to self-centered egoist, full of threats and deceptions. The episode also introduces Claudius’ advisers Pallas and Narcissus, two Greek freedmen (former slaves) whose display of comic chemistry lightens the tone of this part of the series.\n\nAccording to Tacitus, Cassius Chaerea (d. 41 CE), as a centurion in the army of Germanicus, distinguished himself in helping to quell the mutiny among Roman troops stationed at the German frontier after the death of Augustus in 14 CE, before serving in the Praetorian Guard under Caligula. Suetonius recounts how Caligula mocked and belittled him for real or supposed effeminacy, in particular giving him degrading watchwords such as “Venus” (an expression for a male eunuch) and “Priapus” (an ithyphallic demigod representing potency, and an expression for an erection, possibly mocking Chaerea for being impotent). The emperor’s insulting behavior was reportedly one motivation for Chaerea’s conspiracy against him, another was the emperor’s increasingly erratic and dangerous behavior. By the time he killed Caligula, on January 29, 41 CE, Caligula had a broad range of like-minded Praetorians, senators, and equestrians against him. The murder of Caligula’s immediate family was likely part of his plan to destroy the imperial monarchy and bring about a return to republican rule, however, he did not enjoy the loyalty of all the Praetorians, most of whom supported Claudius as Caligula’s successor.\n\nCast: Bernard Hepton (Pallas), John Cater (Narcissus), Lyndon Brook (Silanus), John Bennett (Xenophon)\n\nContents\n\nEpisode 11: “A God in Colchester”\n\nWhile Claudius is at war subduing the Britons, Messalina’s promiscuity shocks all of Rome, all except Claudius, whom she has carefully kept in the dark. It makes Claudius a laughing-stock throughout Rome, but it also threatens him and his Empire when Messalina divorces him without his knowledge and marries the consul Gaius Silius. Pallas and Narcissus puzzle over how best to inform their emperor that he must act decisively to save himself. Meanwhile, Claudius receives reports that his friend Herod is conspiring with his fellow client-kings to overthrow Roman dominion in the east, and he also learns that a temple dedicated to himself as a god has been built in Britain.\n\nEpisode notes: Apart from the character arc of Valeria Messalina from a shy maiden who appeals to Claudius’ protective instincts at the end of episode 9 to a sexually voracious, manipulative and arrogant woman, this episode also gives the fate of Herod Agrippa, Claudius’ oldest, closest and most-trusted friend. He meets his fate off-stage but sends a farewell letter in which he confesses that, having convinced himself that he was the prophesied Messiah of the Jews and planned an uprising against Rome, he is now dying of a painful and fatal illness in expiation for having offended his god with his hubris. His constant advice to Claudius was always “Trust no one,” including himself, which is how he closes his final letter and which now sinks in as Claudius finds his personal life falling to pieces around him, and threatening to take his power with it.\n\nThe historical Messalina: Valeria Messalina was born in either 17 or 20 CE, and died in 48, making her 28 or 30 at the time of her death. She was a very blue-blooded woman, being the great-grandneice of Augustus, first cousin to the emperor Nero, and second cousin to the emperor Caligula. She married Claudius, then 48 years old, in 38.\n\nMessalina’s reputation in history is largely the result of scandal-mongering and political hostility to the line of the Julio-Claudian emperors, written by such biographers and historians as Suetonius and Tacitus, who were writing seventy years after the event. Only Tacitus names a source for his information regarding Messalina’s behavior, and that is the memoirs (now lost) of Claudius’ last wife, Agrippina the Younger (known in the novels and series as Agrippinilla), who arranged to remove Claudius’ son by Messalina, Britannicus, from the imperial succession in favor of her own son, Nero, and who was therefore motivated to blacken her predecessor’s reputation.\n\nOther sources for Messalina’s notoriety are found in the tenth book of the Natural History of Pliny the Elder, describing a 24-hour competition with a prostitute won by Messalina, shown in this episode as Messalina’s challenge (not described in the novel) to the professional prostitute Scylla. Also, Juvenal, in the sixth of his Satires, mentions Messalina’s secretly moonlighting in a brothel, and in his tenth, tells of how she compelled Gaius Silius to divorce his wife and marry her. No corroborating or contradicting evidence appears to have been found concerning Messalina’s personal or political behavior. She has been portrayed many times in literary, artistic, and dramatic depictions, some focusing on her supposed ambition, many others playing up the prurient aspects of her reputed sexual exploits.\n\nCast: Moira Redmond (Domitia), Stuart Wilson (Silius), Nicholas Amer (Mnester), Charlotte Howard (Scylla), George Innes (Quintus Justus), Manning Wilson (Marsus Vibius)\n\nContents\n\nEpisode 12: “Old King Log”\n\nAfter Messalina’s death, Claudius decides that in having tried to rule benevolently, he has only reconciled the empire to monarchy, and that things must get much worse before they get better. The last holdout against Roman control in Britain, the chieftain Caractacus, is subdued and brought with his family to Rome, where his defiant speech to the senate that the Romans will have to fight hard if they want to keep Britain, to his surprise, impresses the senators and is met with applause. Claudius allows his freedman Pallas to convince him to marry a woman he personally dislikes: Agrippinilla, his niece, and mother of Nero, who he is convinced will succeed him as emperor. But he is hopeful that the republic will be restored after Nero, and is also convinced that his son by Messalina, Britannicus, will be the instrument of that restoration.\n\nEpisode Notes: The Cumaean Sybil, a visit to whom is recounted in episode 1, is one of the recurring motifs in the series. In episode 6, a small book of non-canonical Sibylline prophecies is given by Livia to Claudius, including one prophecy regarding the line of the Caesars that will motivate his actions in this episode. The prophecy (which is given in full in the first of Graves’ novels, I, Claudius) describes the “six hairy men” (playing on the meaning of the word caesar or “hairy”) who will “enslave the state”, beginning with the dictator Julius and ending with the emperor Nero, closing by saying that “no hairy seventh succeeds”, which Claudius, who is described in the prophecies as the one who will “give Rome water and winter bread” (a reference to his aqueducts and his port at Ostia, intended to furnish the Roman populace with affordable grain during the winter), interprets as meaning that the Roman imperial monarchy will end with Nero, and the republic restored. The Sybil reappears to the just-deceased Claudius at the close of the series to call him to the underworld and to reveal the fate of the characters and of Rome. The title refers to a sort of Aesop-like fable which is recounted in full in the second of Graves’ novels, Claudius The God.\n\nAgrippinilla is, of course, the sister of Caligula and Drusilla, and though not mad like Caligula, is thoroughly morally depraved, and the relationship between herself and Nero has some creepy undertones (the series also contrives a subtle resemblance between Agrippinilla and her late brother by giving her a similar close-fitting blonde wig). She is confounded by Claudius’ passive acquiescence to her wishes, even those she feels will encounter resistance, such as his adoption of Nero as co-heir with his own son Britannicus, but she is also unaware of the prophecies that he believes will eventually save Rome from monarchy. His son Britannicus is embittered over the death of his mother Messalina and his apparent favoritism with regard to Nero, and, rather than complying with his father’s wish that he go into hiding among the Britons to learn their independent, hardy spirit and return after Nero’s death to restore the republic, instead declares his intention to stay in Rome, openly contest Nero and become emperor himself one day. Concluding sadly that the heartbreakingly naïve and vulnerable Britannicus will be no match for the cynical ambitions of Agrippinilla and Nero, Claudius is left with the solitary hope that if he cannot change the course of Rome’s history, he can at least tell the unvarnished truth of it.\n\nIn his farewell speech to the senate, Claudius refers to his just-completed memoirs in an obscure, oracular way which also refers to the author of the novels and the writer of this series: “The man who dwells by the pool [Jack Pulman] will open graves [Robert Graves] and deliver Rome up again. She shall be seen for what she truly was.” His thoughts wander and for a moment we see Augustus, Livia, Antonia, Tiberius and Caligula speak to him in a vision against the gathered senators. This episode is framed, not by Claudius writing in his study, but by Agrippinilla and Nero finding and reading pages of his manuscript before setting fire to them, Claudius being already dead. Of course, Claudius has found a way of tricking his wife and soon-to-be successor, and in some nineteen hundred years, “Clau-Clau-Claudius” will speak clearly.\n\nOf course, Claudius is wrong about the Roman imperial monarchy dying with Nero, followed by a restoration of the Republic; Nero will simply be the last of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. The year in which Nero dies, 69 CE, will instead be “the year of the four Emperors”, during which three men, Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, will seize power in quick succession before Vespasian firmly establishes the Flavian dynasty of emperors. While the Roman state will retain many of the institutions and offices of its republican beginnings, the Republic itself will never be restored.\n\nCast: Barbara Young (Agrippinilla), Christopher Biggins (Nero), Graham Seed (Britannicus), Peter Bowles (Caractacus), Freda Dowie (The Sybil)\n\nContents\n\nGeneral remarks on the novel, the series and the historical background\n\nThe imperial family: Part of the complexity of the family relationships in the novel and series can be cleared up if it is kept in mind that both Augustus and Livia (names of people who appear prominently in the story and particularly in the series will be given below in italics) married after each had been married and had children with other spouses; their own marriage is childless and brings together the Julian and Claudian families, or gentes, of which we will now speak briefly.\n\nRoman society was divided into gentes (singular: gens), which can be translated by such words as “clans” or “tribes” (although tribus had a distinctively different meaning in the original Latin than here). In essence, a gens was an extended family, and members of a particular gens shared a nomen (or more specifically, a nomen gentilicium or “gens name”), which was a hereditary surname, such as Julius or Claudius, and claimed a common ancestor who founded the gens. These gentes in turn were divided into stirpes (singular: stirps), which were branches of the gens, and often designated by cognomina (singular: cognomen) which came after the nomen in a man’s personal name. A man’s own personal name was his forename, or praenomen, which came before the nomen. In many gentes, especially noble ones, certain forenames were hallowed by tradition and used over and over again—much to the confusion of the student of Roman history. Therefore, the emperor Claudius, his uncle the emperor Tiberius, Tiberius’ biological father, and a great many other members of his family besides were all born with the name Tiberius Claudius Nero, which we can now understand to mean something like “Tiberius, of the Neronian branch of the Claudian gens”.\n\nMembers of a gens were not necessarily all related by blood, since it was customary for a formally adopted son to take the nomen (and therefore, join the gens) of the man who adopted him, for a freedman to take the name of his former owner, and for a new Roman citizen to take the name of the Roman who sponsored or granted his citizenship. There were patrician (that is, noble or aristocratic) gentes, and gentes that were plebeian (that is, common), as well as gentes that had both patrician and plebeian branches. Gentes had their own customs, formed assemblies which passed laws applying at least theoretically to all members of the gens, and even their own traditional religious rituals.\n\nThe system of gentes dates to pre-Roman times and was a common feature of many of the other cultures of the Italian peninsula, whose equivalents of the gens were often incorporated into the Roman system as Roman influence expanded. The institution of the gens was especially important during the eras of the Roman kingdom and the Roman republic, but began to decline during the imperial era.\n\nAmong the Julians (Augustus himself is a Julian by adoption by the dictator Julius Caesar—his original name was Gaius Octavius Thurinus) in the family are Julia, who is Augustus’ daughter by his previous wife Scribonia, and who married her father’s old friend Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and bore him Postumus, Gaius and Lucius, and Agrippina (known to history as Agrippina Maior or Agrippina the Elder) all of whom figure prominently in the story.\n\nAmong the Claudians in the story are Livia, who is Claudian by birth and by marriage to her first husband Tiberius Claudius Nero, who fathered her sons Tiberius and Drusus. Drusus marries Antonia, daughter of the famed Marc Antony and Augustus’ sister Octavia, and their issue includes Germanicus, Claudius, and Livilla. Tiberius marries Vipsania (another daughter of Marcus Agrippa by a previous marriage), fathers a son named Drusus (nicknamed Castor in the story) then very reluctantly divorces her to marry Julia for political advantage (their marriage is without issue). Castor and Livilla marry and have a daughter named Livia Julia (nicknamed Helen in the story for her beauty), while Germanicus and Agrippina (who along with Drusus, Antonia, Postumus and Castor are among the most upright and virtuous moral characters in the story) marry and bear some of the most degenerate characters in the story: Gaius (nicknamed Caligula [see remarks to ep. 9] in the novels and the series), Drusilla and Agrippina the Younger (called Agrippinilla by Graves in the novels and the series). Caligula marries a patrician woman, Caesonia, who bears him a daughter, Drusilla, both of whom are murdered after Caligula’s own assassination. Agrippinilla will go on to marry Claudius in the last years of his reign.\n\nIn the novels, Claudius himself will marry four times in his life and have four children: his first wife is Urgulanilla, granddaughter of Livia’s friend Urgulania, and the two have a son, Drusus, who dies in his early teens, with foul play being suspected. Claudius divorces her, suspecting adultery (she bears a daughter, whom Claudius repudiates due to her uncertain parentage). His next wife is Aelia Paetina, relative of Lucius Aelius Sejanus, Tiberius’ political fixer and spy, and the two have a daughter, Claudia Antonia. After the fall of Sejanus’ political power, Claudius divorces Aelia, and during the reign of Caligula marries Valeria Messalina, who bears him a son, Britannicus, and a daughter, Octavia. All of Claudius’ children, except Britannicus and very briefly, Octavia, are offstage in the series. Claudius has no children with his last wife Agrippinilla, but he does adopt, and name as co-heir with his own son Britannicus, Agrippinilla’s newly of-age son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, who takes the name Nero (a name with strong Claudian family associations).\n\nAs is the case with many of the conjugal relationships between the married couples in the books and series, sexual compatibility and interest is not an issue in Claudius’ matches: His first marriage is arranged by his family, his second arranged by Sejanus as a means to enter the imperial family, his third arranged as a prank by Caligula, and the last determined by practical expediency. In the books, Claudius keeps mistresses to take care of his sexual and companionship needs: they are lower-class prostitutes and therefore not respectable, but are shown as intelligent and affectionate domestic partners: one of them, Calpurnia, appears in the series. After the action of the novels and series, Nero goes on to become Claudius’ successor, and is the last of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\n\nIn this story of interrelationships between two families brought together by marriage, the only relationships which are considered technically incestuous are Caligula’s relationships with his sisters and Claudius’ marriage to Agrippinilla, a union of convenience which appears to be sexless and certainly without issue; in episode 12, Agrippinilla at first responds seductively to Claudius’ announcement of his intentions to marry her, but cools immediately when Claudius matter-of-factly informs her that he is entirely uninterested in any sexual relationship but only desires her assistance in his rule. Marriages between half-brothers and half-sisters are apparently not considered inappropriate, and it will be noted that Castor and Livilla are first cousins (Livilla’s father being the brother of Tiberius).\n\nRobert Graves (1895-1985) suffered from a serious shrapnel-wound and shell-shock (what we today call post-traumatic stress disorder) in the First World War, and was associated with the wave of realistic war poets along with Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. An autobiography, Goodbye To All That (1929), was one of his first literary successes, followed in 1934 with one of his most successful works, I, Claudius, and its sequel, Claudius The God (1935). His works of historical fiction also include 1938’s Count Belisarius, about a famous general of the Byzantine Empire, and 1946’s King Jesus. He was also known as a scholar and translator of classical literature and mythology: two of his most popular translations include The Golden Ass of Apuleius (1951) and 1957’s The Twelve Caesars, (revised in 1979 by Michael Grant) a rendering of Suetonius’ biographies of Julius Caesar and the Roman emperors from Augustus to Domitian. He also wrote The White Goddess, a book-length essay on mythology, in 1948, and The Greek Myths in 1955. He lived most of his adult life in Deia, Majorca.\n\nContents\n\nDramatizing I, Claudius: The first attempt to dramatize I, Claudius was in 1937 when Alexander Korda, of London Films, bought the rights to Graves’ novels and began to film an adaptation with Josef von Sternberg as director and Charles Laughton in the role of Claudius, Merle Oberon as Messalina, Flora Robson as Livia, and Emlyn Williams as Caligula. Filming came to an end when Oberon, who worked closely with Korda on many of his films and later married him, was seriously injured in an automobile accident. In 1965, The British Broadcasting Corporation filmed a short documentary about the unfinished film, The Epic That Never Was, hosted by Dirk Bogarde. The documentary, which featured much of the footage shot for the film, also featured interviews with many of the surviving cast and crew, including Oberon, Robson, Williams and director Sternberg, as well as with Graves himself, and has been included with many of the home-video presentations of the series.\n\nAlthough London Films had ceased to be active in film production for many years when preparations for the series were being made, they still held the rights to the story, which held up production as negotiations took place between the company and the BBC. The series was first broadcast on BBC2 from September to December 1976, and presented to American viewers the following year on the Public Broadcasting Service’s Masterpiece Theater (still running today as Masterpiece), a long-running anthology series of mostly British-produced dramatic serials, produced by WGBH Boston. Trepidation accompanied the American presentation of the series, mainly due to its scenes of nudity, sexuality and violence. The series earned 4 BAFTAs in the UK and 3 Emmys in the US and has since been considered one of the best dramatic series produced in the history of television. Cast members in the series, particularly Derek Jacobi, Brian Blessed, Patrick Stewart, and John Hurt, went on to become household names on both sides of the Atlantic, in part through their exposure to audiences in this series.\n\nContents\n\nOther dramatizations: I, Claudius was adapted for the stage in 1972 by John Mortimer and starred David Warner. New adaptations were announced, one for a theatrical film in 2008 by Relativity Media, with Jim Sheridan as director, and another in 2011, as a miniseries produced for HBO and BBC2 by Jane Tranter and Anne Thomopoulos. Neither adaptation appears to have gone into production as of this writing. A series of six hour-long episodes of a dramatization of both novels, adapted by Robin Brooks and directed by Jonquil Panting, were broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in late 2010. Performers in the series included Derek Jacobi and Tom Goodman Hill.\n\nContents\n\nIs I, Claudius history? No. Although Robert Graves drew on most of the standard ancient sources such as Suetonius, Tacitus, Dio Cassius, and Plutarch, and hewed generally to the established historical outline, his Claudius novels do use artistic license and are better considered as historical fiction. While the veracity of the ancient historians is debatable, the novel and series generally paint Claudius as a decent, intelligent man who functions as both sympathetic observer-narrator and actor in the history he describes: they also show Claudius as having strong republican sentiments, furthering his character’s sympathy with the audience, but there is little in the historical texts that confirm this.\n\nWe must take the ancient histories and biographies, as the Romans would say, cum grano salis, taking into account the various motivations of the ancient writers, their attitudes and biases, and the fact that they were writing decades after the events they outline. We must also understand that in their writings, a constant narrative of corruption holds sway.\n\nIn republican Rome, executive power was wielded by consuls who were selected from the senate in rotation, legislative power by the senate itself, and tribunes exercised a check on government actions through the veto power (veto—“I forbid”): but as the Roman state changed from a republic to a principate, power was consolidated in the princeps, who could select successors from his children, or by formally adopting a younger man as his son and heir. This introduced dynastic politics (that is to say, family politics) into government. Hence, while Roman women were formally excluded from political office, they had an important role to play in the Roman family, and when it came to the imperial family, the imperial household, and the imperial bureaucracy, women (as well as persons excluded from political office, such as freedmen) could be extremely influential in state decisions, and came to wield “soft power” behind the scenes. Figures such as Livia, Messalina, and Agrippinilla come off badly in the writings of such commentators as Tacitus and Suetonius not only because of an androcentric attitude in the authors themselves, but also because such women represented the drift of Roman statecraft from open government on the floor of the senate to hidden deals and power brokerage.\n\nWe must also keep in mind that while the depictions of such emperors as Tiberius, Caligula and Nero in the ancient authors make entertaining reading, they must also be taken with a grain of salt. We can easily believe that Tiberius suffered from depression, was an alcoholic, and resented the responsibilities of public life (hence his willingness to allow Sejanus to take on many of the day-to-day tasks of his position), but allow that stories of debauchery at his villa on Capri might be exaggerated and sensationalized. Caligula might well have had neurological difficulties—it is said he suffered from “falling sickness” (i. e., epilepsy) and hyperthyroidism, which would account for irritability and protruding eyes, accounting for the “stare” described by biographers—but we have no hard evidence that he was delusional or psychotic or that he established a brothel in the palace. As we have remnants of Nero’s Domus Aurea or “Golden House”, extant examples of his poetry, and evidence of a devastating fire under his reign, we can readily accept that Nero was extravagant as well as keen on music and the arts, but we do not necessarily have to take for a fact that the fire was set by him or that he “fiddled while Rome burned”. The idea that bad government went hand-in-hand with cruelty, sexual immorality, extravagance, and insanity is a common trope in the ancient sources. It is with these caveats in mind that we go on to the “real” Claudius as related by the historians and biographers.\n\nContents\n\nThe historical Claudius: According to the ancient sources, Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (born Tiberius Claudius Nero, 10 BCE at Lugdunum in Gaul [modern Lyons in France]- died 54 CE in Rome) was a capable administrator who carefully attempted to work with the senate during his reign. He initiated and completed many public works, including aqueducts, canals, roads, and a winter port at Ostia intended to maintain a ready and inexpensive supply of grain during the winter season. He took special interest in the Roman legal system, trying many cases himself; he settled disputes in the provinces, including a violent conflict between Greeks and Jews in Alexandria, and published many edicts of every conceivable nature: one prescribed the juice of yew trees as a remedy for snakebite, another set penalties for slave-owners who abandoned ailing slaves to die but reclaimed them if they recovered. Another such edict, quoted in Claudius The God, attempted to forestall public panic at an imminent solar eclipse by explaining that eclipses were not supernatural omens but astronomical events well understood by science, proceeding to describe the phenomenon in plain language, and even advising on how to avoid injury to vision in viewing it. He also completed the conquest of Britain, a project initiated by the dictator Julius Caesar, resulting in a Roman presence in Britain from the English Channel to the border of Scotland. Nevertheless, the ancients also complained that his judgments in the law courts were frequently capricious and illegal; they charged him with being cruel and bloodthirsty, overly fond both of gladiatorial games and of personally witnessing the performance of executions. They also accused him of paranoia: by most accounts, 35 senators and some 300 members of the equestrian order were executed during his reign on charges of conspiracy. He was also reportedly a womanizer, although he was also accused of being excessively dependent and easily led by his wives and his freedmen, the latter of which he employed as heads of his bureaucracy, and most of whom used their position to amass large fortunes.\n\nThe private Claudius: In private life, Claudius was a scholar and historian, writing works concerning both the Empire and antiquarian subjects, though the only surviving specimens of his writing consist of official documents: speeches, correspondence and the like. An early work about the civil wars which preceded the imperial era may have been politically sensitive and partly responsible for the obscurity in which his family placed him. Works attributed to him include histories of the Etruscan and Carthaginian peoples, a lexicon of the Etruscan language, a booklet on dice-playing (a pastime to which Claudius was devoted), and an eight-volume autobiography written later in life (which may have served as inspiration for Robert Graves). None of his literary works are extant, but they were used as sources by the younger Pliny, Suetonius, and Tacitus. He also proposed a reform of the Latin alphabet, introducing three characters which more or less correspond to the Greek letter psi and to the modern English letters W and Y, and while used briefly, did not survive his reign.\n\nThe death of Claudius: Ancient historians nearly all attributed his death, on the thirteenth of October, 54, to poison, either in a dish of mushrooms (one of his favorite foods), smeared on a feather (used to induce vomiting of the supposedly poisoned food), or in a dish of gruel (given to Claudius for nourishment after having been purged of the supposedly poisoned food). His wife Agrippina is usually pointed to as instigator of the poisoning, and various sources also implicate the infamous poisoner Locusta, Claudius’ chief steward and taster Halotus, and his physician Gaius Stertinius Xenophon as collaborators. Contemporary sources who disputed the charges of poisoning included the younger Seneca, who ascribed Claudius’ death to natural causes, and the Jewish historian Josephus, who referred to the charges as rumors only.\n\nClaudius the God: After Nero succeeded to the throne, he and the senate quickly bestowed divine honors on his predecessor: Claudius had already had been worshiped as a god by the newly-conquered Britons at a temple dedicated to him in Camulodunum (modern Colchester, in Essex). But in Rome, the cult of the Divine Claudius appears to have been quickly forgotten, and the raising of the only Claudian temple in Rome was quickly abandoned early in its construction, its foundation becoming part of Nero’s Domus Aurea or “Golden House,” an immense folly of 300 rooms which supposedly covered 100 to 300 acres, was constructed of concrete and brick, covered with gold leaf, stucco, frescoes, ivory fittings, and marble, with extensive landscaping, including an artificial lake, groves of trees, pastures with flocks, and vineyards. Excavation of the site, still ongoing, reveals no sleeping quarters, kitchens or latrines, suggesting that the vast and extravagant complex was used exclusively for entertaining.\n\nThe younger Seneca wrote a satirical prose work called Apocolocyntosis divi Claudii, or “The Gourdification (or “Pumpkinification”) of the Divine Claudius” (“apocolocyntosis” being a pun on the word “apotheosis” or “deification”), detailing the death of Claudius, his ascent to heaven and judgment by the gods, and eventual descent to the underworld. Seneca, who had been banished by Claudius, and later on became tutor to Nero, mocks him for his personal faults, particularly cruelty and obtuseness. On his entry into Hades, Claudius meets the ghosts of his victims, who call for a punishment for his crimes, which is to forever shake dice in a cup with no bottom. But Caligula appears and claims Claudius as a former slave, and hands him over to work forever as a law clerk in the courts of the underworld.\n\nContents\n\nSuggestions for further reading\n\nRobert Graves, I, Claudius, Claudius The God. In these historical novels, the fourth emperor of the Roman Empire shares his close observations of the workings of imperial power and the humiliation he receives at the hands of his family. The first volume ends with his elevation to emperor by the Praetorian guard after the assassination of Caligula, while the second follows his reign to just before his death, along with lengthy treatment of his friend Herod Agrippa, and appended with an early English translation of Suetonius’ account of his death and a post-script by Graves himself. The real emperor Claudius was probably not so sympathetic as he is made to be in the story.\n\nGaius Suetonius Tranquillus, The Lives of the Twelve Caesars. Beginning with a biography of the dictator Julius Caesar (roughly the first half of which is lost), Suetonius’ collection of biographies continues through the lives of the first eleven emperors of Rome, ending with the final emperor of the Flavian line, Domitian. While the biases of the author must be admitted, the work as a whole is entertaining gossip, painting vivid portraits of the Caesars in colorful and scandalous detail: from Julius Caesar’s bisexuality to Domitian’s penchant for killing flies with a sharpened pen, Suetonius’ biographies may not be altogether reliable, but their subjects live in the reader’s mind as distinctive personalities. My favorite translation is by Robert Graves himself, in the Penguin Classics edition revised in 1979 by Michael Grant.\n\nGaius Cornelius Tacitus, The Annals. Tacitus was a senator and historian who had earlier published the Histories, which covered the post-Neronian era to the end of the reign of Domitian, while the Annals, his final work, covers an earlier period, from the death of Augustus to the end of Nero’s reign. They were meant to be taken together as a comprehensive history of roughly the same period as Suetonius’ biographies (the titles were added later by other commentators). While Tacitus was unstinting in his criticism of the emperors, he was on the whole supportive of the institution of the principate, believing that Augustus restored order and peace to a fractious and unstable state, while lamenting the loss of ancient standards of civic virtue.\n\nDio Cassius, Rome, epitomized (abridged) by Xiphilinus. In the second and third century CE, Dio Cassius (a Roman senator of Greek origin) wrote, in Greek, a massive eighty-volume history of Rome covering about a thousand years, from the legendary arrival of Aeneas in Italy from defeated Troy to the more recent past under the emperors Commodus and Alexander Severus. Much of the work is fragmentary, with much of the later third of the work surviving in fragments or in the epitomization (a sort of abridgment or summary) made by the eleventh-century Byzantine monk Joannes Xiphilinus. However, the books covering the period from the defeat of Varus (see episode 3) to the death of Claudius are complete.\n\nLucius Annaeus Seneca, The Apocolocyntosis. Seneca wrote a worshipful funeral speech praising Claudius after his death, but he also wrote this maliciously witty squib ridiculing the late and recently deified emperor. I read it in J. P. Sullivan’s translation, which he subtitles “The Deification of Claudius the Clod,” published with a short introduction and notes, in the Penguin Classics edition of his translation of Petronius’ Satyricon.\n\nGaius Petronius Arbiter, The Satyricon. This is not history, but a work of picaresque fiction by a member of Nero’s court and his “arbiter of elegance,” that gives a pungent sense of the atmosphere of decadence of the time. Much of the complete work is now lost, but the surviving fragments include the famous “Dinner with Trimalchio” sequence, in which the hapless hero of the work and his friends attend a lavish dinner-party given by a very rich—and exceedingly vulgar and ostentatious—ex-slave. Like one of Trimalchio’s dishes, the Satyricon contains morsels of wide-ranging and not always complimentary flavors: poetry, literary talk, sexual adventures, and tall tales. The wildness is given an unintended dreamlike quality by the fragmentary nature of the text, which was used by Federico Fellini when he made a film adaptation in 1970. My library contains a modern translation by J. P. Sullivan published by Penguin Classics, with introduction, notes, and other supplementary material, along with his translation of Seneca’s Apocolocyntosis."
