        "text": "Suetonius: The Twelve Caesars - Index BCD\n\nBaiae, modern Baia, is on the Bay of Naples, and was named after Baius, supposedly buried there. It was a fashionable coastal resort, especially towards the end of the Roman Republic. To counter the frequent raids on Italy and the shipping routes for Rome’s grain supply, by Sextus Pompeius, Agrippa created a safe harbour from which to conduct a naval campaign against him. It was constructed from 37BC - 36BC and named the Portus Iulius in honour of Augustus who had taken the name Gaius Julius Caesar according to Julius Caesar’s will. Shortly after the successful conclusion of the war with Sextus, it was abandoned due to the piling up of silt. Nearby Misenum became the naval base for the Western Mediterranean. The port was located at the western end of the gulf of Naples and other than the waters of the bay, itself, consisted of three bodies of water in the area: Lake Lucrino, Lake Averno, and the natural inner and outer harbor behind Cape Misenum. Baiae was sacked by Muslim raiders in the 8th century and deserted due to malaria in 1500. Most of Baiae is now beneath the Bay of Naples, largely due to local volcanic activity.\n\nBookTwoXVI Augustus created the Julian harbour, Portus Iulius, there.\n\nBookTwoLXIV Augustus’ daughter Julia there.\n\nBookThreeVI BookSixXXXI BookSixXXXIV Mentioned.\n\nBookFourXIX Caligula constructed a bridge of boats over the bay to Puteoli.\n\nBookSixXXVII Nero sailed the bay on pleasure cruises.\n\nBalbillus, Tiberius Claudius was a Graeco-Egyptian astrologer and scholar.

He was born and raised in Alexandria, to which he returned during the reign of Caligula, returning to Rome under Claudius, of whom he had been a childhood friend. He accompanied Claudius on his expedition to Britain as an officer in the 20th legion (Legio XX Valeria Victrix) and was awarded a crown of honor. Appointed high priest at the Temple of Hermes in Alexandria and director of the Library, he lived there and in Rome. Nero, in 56AD appointed him Prefect of Egypt, where he stayed until 59AD. He returned to Rome under Vespasian. When he died, Vespasian dedicated the Balbillean Games, in honor of his memory, held at Ephesus from 79AD until well into the 3rd century.\n\nBookSixXXXVI His interpretation of the appearance of a comet, during Nero’s reign.\n\nBalbus, see Atius and Cornelius\n\nBalearic Islands [the] are an archipelago in the western Mediterranean Sea, near the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. The four largest islands are (from largest to smallest): Majorca, Minorca, Ibiza, and Formentera. The islands belonged, under the Empire, to the conventus of Carthago Nova (modern Cartagena), in the province of Hispania Tarraconensis, of which province they formed, the fourth district, under the government of a praefectus pro legato.\n\nBookSevenX Mentioned, as a place of exile.\n\nBasilides was a freedman of Vespasian who appeared miraculously to him in the Serapeum of Alexandria.

It is situated on a hill 130m above sea-level at the confluence of the Calore Irpino (or Beneventano) and Sabato. Under the Second Triumvirate its territory was portioned out by the Triumvirs to their veterans, and subsequently a fresh colony was established there by Augustus, who greatly enlarged its domain by the addition of the territory of Caudium (modern Montesarchio).\n\nBookTwoXCVII Augustus intends to accompany Tiberius there in AD14, Tiberius being on his way to Illyricum, but is delayed by illness.\n\nBookTwoXCVIII Augustus completes his journey there with Tiberius but falls ill again on the return journey.\n\nBookSixXXXVI Nero discovers Vinicius’s conspiracy, oganised from there.\n\nBerenice of Cilicia, or Julia Berenice (b. 28AD), was a member of the Jewish Herodian Dynasty, who ruled Judaea between 39BC and 92AD. She was the daughter of Herod Agrippa I, and sister of Herod Agrippa II. During the First Jewish-Roman War, she began an affair with the future emperor Titus. Her unpopularity in Rome compelled Titus to dismiss her on his accession as emperor in 79AD.\n\nBookEightXXXII Mentioned.\n\nBessians, the Bessi were an independent Thracian tribe in the area ranging from Moesia to Mount Rhodope in southern Thrace, but are often mentioned as dwelling around Haemus, the mountain range that separates Moesia from Thrace, and from Mount Rhodope to the northern part of Hebrus.\n\nBookTwoIII Augustus’ father fought them in a major battle.\n\nBetriacum, or Bedriacum, was a Roman town on the Via Postumia about 35 kilometres east of modern Cremona.\n\nBookSevenXXXII BookSevenXLV Otho’s army was defeated by Vitellius’s troops there on the 14th of April 69AD, in the first battle of Betriacum.\n\nBookSevenL Marcus Antonius Primus, Vespasian’s general, encountered the Vitellian army between Betriacum and Cremona on the 24th October 69AD, and drove the Vitellian troops towards Cremona which he subsequently stormed and set ablaze.\n\nBookEightV An omen of Vespasian’s victory was seen on the battlefield.\n\nBibulus Calpurnius, Marcus (d. 48BC) was the son in law of Marcus Porcius Cato Uticencis (Cato the Younger) He was elected consul for 60BC, supported by the optimates, conservative republicans in the Senate and opponents of Julius Caesar’s triumvirate.

The Sons of Bocchus I (Sosus), Bocchus and his younger brother Bogud, jointly ruled Mauretania with Bocchus ruling east of the Mulucha River and his brother west. As enemies of the senatorial party, their title was recognized by Julius Caesar (49BC). During the African war they invaded Numidia and conquered Cirta, the capital of the kingdom of Juba. Dio Cassius says that Bocchus sent his sons to support Sextus Pompeius in Spain, while Bogud fought on the side of Caesar. After Caesar’s death Bocchus supported Octavian, and Bogud Antony. During Bogud’s absence in Spain, his brother seized the whole of Numidia, and was confirmed sole ruler by Octavian. After Bocchus’ death in 33BC, Numidia was made a Roman province.\n\nBookOneLII Caesar reputedly had an affair with Bogud’s wife Eunoe.\n\nBona Dea, the Good Goddess, was the goddess associated with virginity and fertility in women. She was also associated with healing. She was regarded with great reverence by lower-class citizens, slaves and women, and was worshipped in her temple on the Aventine, though her secret rites were performed in the home of a prominent Roman magistrate. The rites were held on December 4, and men were excluded.\n\nBookOneVI The festival was alleged to have been desecrated by Publius Clodius Pulcher in 62BC, who, it was claimed, secretly attended the ceremony at the house of the pontifex maximus, Julius Caesar, and there seduced Caesar’s wife Pompeia.\n\nBononia, modern Bologna, is the capital of the Emilia-Romagna region of modern Italy, north of Florence, between the Reno and Savena rivers. It lies at the northern foot of the Apennines, on the ancient Via Aemilia. Originally the Etruscan Felsina, it was occupied by the Gallic Boii in the 4th century BC and became a Roman colony and municipium (Bononia) c. 190BC. In 90BC, it acquired Roman citizenship, and in 43 BC was used as his base of operations against Decimus Brutus by Mark Antony, who settled colonists there,\n\nBookTwoXVII Excused from rallying to his cause, by Augustus.\n\nBookTwoXCVI Octavian (Augustus), Lepidus and Antony met at Bologna in Ocotber, 43BC, and formed the Second Triumvirate.\n\nBookSixVII Nero delivered a plea on behalf of the citizens before Claudius in AD51.\n\nBoter was a freedman of Claudius’s, who had an affair with Claudius’s wife Plautia Urgulanilla, and was the father of her daughter Claudia.\n\nBookFiveXXVII Mentioned.\n\nBovillae was an ancient town on the Via Appia located c. 18km south-east of Rome. It was a colony of Alba Longa, and appears as one of the thirty cities of the Latin League. After the destruction of Alba Longa in 658BC the sacra were supposedly transferred to Bovillae, including the cult of Vesta and that of the gens Iulia. The existence of this hereditary worship led to an increase in its importance when the Julian house rose to power. In 16AD the family shrine was re-dedicated probably by the Augustales, an order of Roman priests instituted by Tiberius to maintain the cult of Augustus and the Iulii.\n\nBookTwoC Augustus’ body carried there on its way to Rome.\n\nBreuci, were an ancient people of Pannonia, of Illyrian origin, who lived along the river Sava.

They spoke the Insular Celtic language known as British or Brythonic. They lived throughout Britain south of the Firth of Forth; after the 5th century Britons also migrated to continental Europe, where they established the settlements of Brittany in France and Britonia in what is now Galicia, Spain.\n\nBookOneXLVII Britain was supposedly of interest to Caesar as a source of pearls.\n\nBookOneLVIII Caesar’s caution in crossing to Britain (55/54BC).\n\nBookFourXIX Caligula was interested in invading Britain.\n\nBookFiveXVII Claudius’ brief campaign there in 43AD.\n\nBookFiveXXI Claudius staged the surrender of the British kings.\n\nBookSixXVIII Nero considered withdrawing from Britain.\n\nBookSixXXXIX Camulodunum (Colchester) and Verulamium (St. Albans) were destroyed during Boudica’s (Boadicea) revolt of 60/61AD.\n\nBookEightIV Vespasian participated in crucial early battles on the rivers Medway and Thames in 43AD. He was sent to reduce the south-west, penetrating the modern counties of Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorset, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall with the probable objectives of securing the south coast harbours along with the tin mines of Cornwall and the silver and lead mines of Somerset. He marched from Noviomagus Reginorum (Chichester) to subdue the hostile Durotriges and Dumnonii tribes, captured twenty oppida (towns, or more probably hill forts, including Hod Hill and Maiden Castle in Dorset).

They were part of the alliance, under Arminius, that defeated Varus and annihilated his three legions at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in 9AD. Six years later, one of the generals serving under Germanicus, Lucius Stertinius, defeated them and re-captured the eagle standard of Legio XIX lost at the Teutoburg Forest. Refusing to bow to Roman rule, the Bructeri in 69AD - 70AD participated in the Batavian rebellion, their wise woman Veleda being the spiritual leader of the uprising.\n\nBookThreeXIX A warrior of the tribe tried to assassinate Tiberius.\n\nBrundisium, modern Brindisi, is a city in the Apulia region of Italy, the capital of the modern province of Brindisi, off the coast of the Adriatic Sea.\n\nBookOneXXXIV BookOneLVIII Besieged by Caesar in 49BC.\n\nBookTwoXVII Augustus’ troops mutinied there in 30BC.\n\nBrutus Albinus, Decimus Junius (b. 85BC – 81BC, d. 42BC) was one of Julius Caesar’s assassins, but is not to be confused with the more famous Marcus Brutus. Decimus was a distant cousin of Caesar, His mother was Sempronia Tuditani, wife of the Decimus Junius Brutus who was consul in 77BC. He was adopted by Aulus Postumius Albinus. He was a legate in Caesar’s army during the Gallic wars and was given the command of the fleet in the war against the Veneti. When the Civil War broke out, he sided with Caesar, and was entrusted with naval operations, securing the capitulation of Massilia. In 44BC, he was made praetor peregrinus by Caesar and was destined to be the governor of Cisalpine Gaul in the following year. On the Ides of March (March 15), when Caesar decided not to attend the Senate meeting due to the concerns of his wife, he was persuaded to do so by Decimus Brutus, After Caesar was attacked by the first assassin, Decimus and the rest of the conspirators attacked and assassinated him. According to Nicolaus of Damascus, Decimus Brutus was the third to strike Caesar, stabbing him in the side. At the beginning of 43BC, he went to Gallia Cisalpina, the province assigned to him as pro-praetor, and levied his own troops. He then occupied Mutina, laying in provisions for a protracted siege. After Octavian’s relief of Mutina he fled to Italy, abandoning his legions. He attempted to reach Macedonia, where Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus had stationed themselves but was executed en route by a Gallic chief loyal to Mark Antony, becoming the first of Caesar’s assassins to be killed.\n\nBookOneLXXX A leader of the conspiracy.\n\nBookOneLXXXI Convinces Caesar to attend the Senate meeting.\n\nBookOneLXXXIII Named as a secondary heir in Caesar’s will.\n\nBookTwoX Beseiged in Mutina.\n\nBrutus, Lucius Junius the founder of the Roman Republic and traditionally one of the first consuls in 509BC. Brutus led the revolt that overthrew the last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. The account is from Livy’s Ab urbe condita and deals with the history of Rome prior to reliable historical records (virtually all prior records were destroyed by the Gauls when they sacked Rome under Brennus c. 390BC. According to Livy, Brutus had a number of grievances against the king amongst them being Tarquin’s involvement in the murder of his brother.\n\nBookOneLXXX Invoked by disaffected Romans, under Caesar’s rule.\n\nBrutus, Marcus Junius, (early June 85BC – late October 42BC), often referred to simply as Brutus, was the son of Marcus Junius Brutus the Elder and Servilia Caepionis. His father was killed by Pompey the Great in dubious circumstances after he had taken part in the rebellion of Lepidus; his mother was the half-sister of Cato the Younger, and later became Julius Caesar’s mistress. Some sources refer to the possibility of Caesar being his real father. Brutus’ uncle, Quintus Servilius Caepio, adopted him in about 59BC, and Brutus was known officially for a time as Quintus Servilius Caepio Brutus before he reverted to using his birth-name. However, following Caesar’s assassination in 44BC, Brutus revived his adoptive name in order to illustrate his links to another famous tyrannicide, Gaius Servilius Ahala, from whom he was descended.\n\nBookOneXXI Possibly engaged for a time to Julia, Caesar’s daughter.\n\nBookOneXLIX His indirect comment on Caesar’s relationship with Nicomedes.\n\nBookOneL His mother was Servilia.\n\nBookOneLXXX BookSevenIII A leader of the conspiracy.\n\nBookOneLXXXII Purportedly reproached by Caesar as Brutus attacked him.\n\nBookOneLXXXV The populace tried to burn his house down after the assassination of Caesar.\n\nBookTwoIX BookSixIII BookSevenXXXIII Defeated by the forces of Augustus (Octavian) and Mark Antony at Philippi.\n\nBookTwoXIII Augustus sent Brutus’ head to Rome to be flung at the feet of Caesar’s statue.\n\nBookTwoLXXXV He wrote a eulogy of Cato replied to by Augustus.\n\nBookThreeLXI Described as ‘Last of the Romans’.\n\nBurrus, Sextus Afranius (1AD - 62AD), Praetorian prefect, was advisor to Nero and, together with Seneca the Younger, influential in the early years of Nero’s reign. Agrippina the Younger chose him as Prefect in 51AD to secure her son Nero’s place as emperor after the death of Claudius. He acquiesced in Nero’s murder of Agrippina but died in 62AD, poisoned by Nero according to Suetonius.\n\nBookSixXXXV Poisoned by Nero.\n\nByzantium was a city founded by Greek colonists from Megara in 667BC and named after their king Byzas. A trading city due to its strategic location at the Black Sea’s only entrance it was later renamed Constantinople (now Istanbul) and briefly became the imperial residence of the classical Roman Empire, and then subsequently the capital of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nBookEightVIII Vespasian reduced Byzantium from free to provincial status.\n\nCaecilius Pomponianus Atticus, Quintus (c. 109BC – c. 32BC) was a philosopher, celebrated editor, banker, and patron of letters with residences in both Rome and Athens.

Under Metellus’ leadership Macedonia was reduced and became a Roman province. In a speech which he delivered at his appointment as censor, he proposed that matrimony be mandatory for all citizens, a speech which Augustus, a century later, read to the Senate and commended in a proclamation.\n\nBookTwoLXXXIX Augustus recommended his speech on increasing the population.\n\nCaecina Severus, Aulus was the son of the Aulus Caecina who was defended by Cicero (69BC) in a speech still extant. He took the side of Pompey in the civil wars, and published a violent tirade against Caesar, for which he was banished. He recanted in a work called Querelae, and by the intercession of his friends, above all, of Cicero, obtained pardon from Caesar. Caecina was regarded as an important authority on the Etruscan system of divination (Etrusca Disciplina), which he endeavoured to place on a scientific footing by harmonizing its theories with the doctrines of the Stoics.\n\nBookOneLXXV His libel against Caesar.\n\nCaecina Alienus, Aulus (d. 79AD) was quaestor of Hispania Baetica in 68AD. Galba appointed him to Upper Germany. Having been prosecuted for embezzling public money, Caecina joined Vitellius, crossed the Alps, but was defeated near Cremona by Suetonius Paulinus, Otho’s general. Subsequently Caecina defeated Otho at Bedriacum. After the overthrow of Vitellius, he supported Vespasian but was implicated, along with Eprius Marcellus, in a conspiracy against the Emperor, and was put to death by order of Titus.\n\nBookEightXXXI Executed by Titus.\n\nCaecus, see Claudius\n\nCaenis, a freedwoman, the former slave and secretary of Antonia Minor (mother of the emperor Claudius), was the mistress of Vespasian.

He was given the name Gaius Vipsanius Agrippa at birth, but when adopted by his maternal grandfather Augustus in 17BC, his name was changed to Gaius Julius Caesar. In 1BC he was made army commander in the East and made a peace treaty with Phraates V on an island in the river Euphrates. In 1AD, he was made Consul with Lucius Aemilius Paullus as his colleague. He married his relative, Livilla, daughter of Drusus the Elder and Antonia Minor. Gaius died in Lycia at the age of 24, after being wounded during a campaign in Artagira, Armenia.\n\nBookTwoXXVI BookThreeX His coming of age in 5BC.\n\nBookTwoXXIX The Basilica Paulli was fronted by a monumental gallery The Porticus of Gaius and Lucius, between it and the rest of the Forum.

The young Gaius earned his nickname Caligula ‘little boot’, while accompanying his father Germanicus on military campaigns in Germany. Caligula was assassinated as the result of a conspiracy involving officers of the Praetorian Guard as well as members of the Senate and imperial court. The conspirators’ attempt to restore the Republic was thwarted when the Praetorian Guard declared Caligula’s uncle and second cousin once removed, Claudius, emperor in his place.\n\nBookThreeLIV Mentioned, as a son of Germanicus.\n\nBookThreeLXII Tiberius suspected him of conspiracy.\n\nBookThreeLXXIII Suspicions that Caligula murdered Tiberius.\n\nBookThreeLXXV Caligula absent from Rome at the time of Tiberius’ death.\n\nBookThreeLXXVI Caligula was named as co-heir in Tiberius’ will.\n\nBookFourI Suetonius’ life of Caligula follows.\n\nBookFiveVII His promotion of Claudius.\n\nBookFiveX BookSevenXXIX His assassination led to Claudius becoming Emperor.\n\nBookFiveXI Claudius refused to allow his own accession date to be celebrated since it was also that of Caligula’s assassination.\n\nBookFiveXX The sources of the Aqua Claudia were at the 38th milestone of the Via Sublacensis, the Anio Novus was taken from the river at the forty-second milestone. Caligula began the aqueducts in 38AD and Claudius completed them in 52AD.\n\nBookFiveXXI Caligula’s Circus (completed by Nero, hence called Nero’s Circus) was built on the property of his mother Agrippina on the Ager Vaticanus (today’s Borgo district) and lies partly under the modern Vatican Piazza.\n\nBookFiveXXVI He had married Lollia Paulina in 38AD.\n\nBookFiveXXXVIII Claudius claimed to have feigned idiocy to survive Caligula’s reign.\n\nBookSixVI Asked to name Nero at the purification ceremony.\n\nBookSixVII Seneca dreamed that his pupil Nero was really Caligula.\n\nBookSixXXX Nero envied him his extravagance.\n\nBookSevenVI He appointed Galba to Upper Germany.\n\nBookSevenVII Mentioned.\n\nBookSevenXXXVII Vitellius’s father Lucius was the first to treat Caligula as a god.\n\nBookSevenXXXIX Vitellius endeared himself to Caligula through his love of chariot-racing.\n\nBookSevenLII Vitellius had a crippled thigh as a result of a chariot accident when Caligula was driving.\n\nBookEightII Caligula was in Germany in late 39/40AD.\n\nBookEightV His anger against Vespasian during the latter’s aedileship.\n\nBookEightXXVI Titus was born in the year of Caligula’s death.\n\nCallipides of Athens (Kallippides) was a celebrated tragic actor of the time of Alcibiades and Agesilaus. He was famous for his imitations of physical action.\n\nBookThreeXXXVIII He was famous for his mime of a long-distance runner, running hard, but never moving.\n\nCalpenus, Quintus, an ex-senator who fought in a gladiatorial contest.\n\nBookOneXXXIX Mentioned.\n\nCalpurnia Pisonis, the daughter of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, sister of Lucius Calpurnius Piso ‘the Pontifex’, was the third and last wife of Julius Caesar. Caesar and Calpurnia married in 59BC with no children resulting from the union. Following Caesar’s death on the Ides of March (March 15) of 44BC, Calpurnia delivered all Caesar’s personal papers, including will and notes, and most precious possessions to Mark Antony. She did not remarry.\n\nBookOneXXI Her marriage to Caesar.\n\nBookOneLXXXI Her dream anticipating his assassination.\n\nCalpurnius Piso, Gaius. In 40AD, Caligula forced Piso’s wife, Livia Orestilla, to marry him, and accused Piso of adultery with her in order to establish cause for banishment. In 41 Claudius recalled Piso to Rome and made him his co-consul. Piso was a powerful senator under Nero and in 65AD led a plot to replace Nero that became known as the Pisonian Conspiracy. A freedman, Milichus, betrayed the plot and the conspirators were arrested, nineteen of them being put to death and thirteen exiled. Piso was ordered to commit suicide.\n\nBookFourXXV Made to divorce Orestilla, by Caligula.\n\nBookSixXXXVI His conspiracy against Nero.\n\nCalpurnius Piso, Gnaeus, Governor of Spain according to Suetonius.\n\nBookOneIX Conspires with Julius Caesar.\n\nCalpurnius Piso, Gnaeus (c. 43BC - 20AD) was consul in 7BC; governor of Hispania, and proconsul of Africa. In AD17 Tiberius appointed him governor of Syria. Piso and Germanicus clashed on several occasions and, in AD19, Piso was driven to leave the province. On the death of Germanicus that year, Piso was suspected of poisoning him. Piso’s attempts to re-gain control of Syria immediately afterwards aroused public indignation, and Tiberius was forced to try him in the Senate. Piso was said to have committed suicide, though it was also rumoured that Tiberius, fearing disclosure of his own complicity, had him put to death.\n\nBookThreeLII BookFourII Rumoured to have poisoned Germanicus.\n\nBookFourIII Germanicus formally renounced his friendship with him.\n\nBookSevenXXXVII Publius Vitellius was one of those who successfully prosecuted him for Germanicus’s murder.\n\nCalpurnius Piso Caesoninus, Lucius was a statesman and the father-in-law of Julius Caesar through his daughter Calpurnia Pisonis.

He was Galba’s adopted son and heir, from January 10 to January 15, 69AD. He was appointed to strengthen Galba’s position when two legions in Germania Superior rebelled against him in support of their commander Aulus Vitellius. On Galba’s assassination, Licinianus fled to the temple of the Vestal Virgins’ claiming sanctuary. He was discovered by two soldiers, Statius Murcus of the Praetorian Guard and Sulpicius Florus, a British auxiliary granted Roman citizenship by Galba. They dragged him outside and killed him.\n\nBookSevenXVII BookSevenXVIII BookSevenXXVIII Adopted by Galba.\n\nBookSevenXXIX Otho sends soldiers to kill him.\n\nCalvus, see Licinius\n\nCamillus, see Furius\n\nCampus Martius was a publicly owned area of ancient Rome about 2 square kilometres (490 acres) in extent. Before the founding of Rome the Campus Martius was a low-lying plain enclosed on the west by a bend of the Tiber River near Tiber Island, on the east by the Quirinal Hill, and on the southeast by the Capitoline Hill. It later became the place for comitia centuriata, civic meetings with weapons, and for the city’s militia. Pompey built the first stone theatre there in 55BC. When the Curia Hostilia burnt down in 52BC the theatre was sometimes used as a meeting place for the Senate. It was there that Julius Caesar was murdered in 44BC. The area was also used as the meeting ground for elections. Julius Caesar planned that the Saepta (enclosures used for elections) be placed there; they were later completed by Augustus. In 33BC Octavian dedicated the Porticus Octaviae, built from spoils of the Dalmatian War.\n\nBookOneXXXIX BookOneLXXX BookOneLXXXIV BookTwoIII\n\nBookTwoXLIII Mentioned.\n\nBookTwoLXXXIII Octavian (Augustus) used to exercise there.\n\nBookTwoXCVII Augustus performed the lustrum, the sacrifical rite of purification after the census, there, on May 11th AD14.\n\nBookTwoC Augustus was cremated there.\n\nBookFourXXXIV Augustus moved statues of famous men there from the Capitol.\n\nBookFiveI Drusus the Elder cremated there.\n\nBookFiveXVIII The Diribitorium was a large building where the election votes were counted.\n\nBookFiveXXI Claudius staged a mock siege there.\n\nBookSixX Nero exercised there.\n\nBookSixXII Nero built a wooden amphitheatre there in AD58.\n\nBookSixXXVII The Lake had been dug for mock naval battles.\n\nBookSixL Overlooked by the Pincian Hill.\n\nBookSevenXLVI Vitellius made offerings to the shade of Nero there in 69AD.\n\nCaninius Rebilus, Gaius was one of Julius Caesar’s legates in Gaul in 52/51BC. In 46BC he served in the Thapsus campaign then accompanied Caesar to Spain to fight at Munda. On the last day of December 45BC, the consul Quintus Fabius Maximus suddenly died and Caesar made Rebilus consul suffectus for the few remaining hours of the year.\n\nBookSixXV Mentioned.\n\nCantabrians, Cantabria is a northern Spanish region bordering the Atlantic with Santander as its capital city. It is bordered on the east by the Basque Autonomous Community on the south by Castile and León on the west by the Principality of Asturias, and on the north by the Cantabrian Sea (Atlantic). The Cantabrian Wars (29BC - 19BC) completed the Roman conquest of the provinces of Cantabria, Asturias and León, and were the final stage of the conquest of Hispania.\n\nBookTwoXX BookTwoXXI BookTwoLXXXI Augustus campaigned against them in person 26BC - 25BC establishing his base at Segisama (Burgos).\n\nBookTwoXXIX Augustus vowed to build a temple to Jupiter Tonans following an incident on a night-march in Cantabria.\n\nBookTwoLXXXV Augustus wrote thirteen chapters of an autobiography taking it up to the period of the Cantabrian War.\n\nBookThreeIX Tiberius was a military tribune there in 25BC.\n\nBookSevenVIII An omen of Galba’s rule witnessed there.\n\nCanus was a flute-player during the reign of Galba.\n\nBookSevenXII Galba rewarded but very modestly.\n\nCanusium, the modern Canosa di Puglia, was an ancient city of Apulia, on the right bank of the Aufidus (Ofanto), about 12 miles from its mouth, and situated upon the Via Traiana, 85 miles east-north-east of Beneventum. Its importance was maintained by its trade in agricultural products and in Apulian wool, which was cleaned and dyed there.\n\nBookSixXXX Nero’s carriage drivers wore clothes of wool from Canusium.\n\nCapitol, the Capitoline Hill between the Forum and the Campus Martius, is one of the Seven Hills of Rome. The hill was the site of a temple for the Capitoline Triad, founded by Rome’s fifth king, Tarquin the Elder.\n\nBookOneX BookFourXXXIV BookFiveXXII Mentioned.\n\nBookOneXXXVII When Julius Caesar suffered an accident during his Gallic Triumph, supposedly indicating the wrath of Jupiter for his actions in the Civil Wars, he approached the hill and Jupiter’s temple on his knees as a way of averting the omen (nevertheless he was murdered six months later, and Brutus and his other assassins took refuge in the temple after the murder.).\n\nBookOneLIV Caesar replaced gold on the Capitol with gilded bronze.\n\nBookOneLXXIX BookTwoXCI BookSevenL The Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, also known as the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was the most important temple of Ancient Rome, located on the Capitoline Hill. The first Temple burned down in 83BC, during the civil wars under the dictatorship of Sulla. The new temple dedicated in 69BC was built to the same plan on the same foundations. Brutus and the other assassins locked themselves inside it after murdering Caesar. The second building burnt down during the course of fighting on the hill on December 19 in 69AD, when Vespasian’s troops battled to enter the city in the Year of the Four Emperors, Domitian narrowly escaping with his life.\n\nBookTwoLVII New Year’s gifts for Augustus taken there annually.\n\nBookTwoLIX BookTwoXCIV BookThreeI Mentioned.\n\nBookFiveXLIV The Citadel was on the northern spur of the Capitoline.\n\nBookEightVIII Vespasian restored the Capitol which was damaged in the struggle with Vitellius.\n\nCappadocia is a region in central Turkey. It maintained tributary independence from Rome until 17AD, when Tiberius reduced Cappadocia to a Roman province.\n\nBookEightVIII Vespasian added legions to guard against barbarian incursions.\n\nCapreae, modern Capri, is an island in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the Sorrentine Peninsula, on the south side of the Gulf of Naples. It has been a resort since the time of the Roman Republic. Tiberius built a series of villas on Capri, the most famous of which is the Villa Jovis, one of the best preserved Roman villas in Italy. In 27AD, Tiberius permanently moved to Capri, running the Empire from there until his death in 37AD.\n\nBookTwoLXXII Augustus had a villa there.\n\nBookTwoXCII Augustus exchanged Aenaria (Ischia) for Capri, with Naples.\n\nBookTwoXCVIII Augustus spent the penultimate days of his life on Capreae.\n\nBookThreeXL BookThreeXLI Tiberius moved to Capri in 26AD and permanently in AD27.\n\nBookThreeXLIII BookSevenXXXVIII Tiberius’s lascivious antics there are described. The name Capreae probably derives from the Greek kapros, a wild-boar, rather than the Latin caper, a goat.\n\nBookThreeLX BookThreeLXII Tiberius’s cruelty exhibited there.\n\nBookThreeLXXIII Tiberius was on his way back there when he died in AD37.\n\nBookThreeLXXIV The destruction of the lighthouse there by earthquake was a portent of Tiberius’ death.\n\nBookFourX Tiberius summoned Caligula there in AD31.\n\nCapua, the ancient town of Capua was situated where Santa Maria Capua Vetere now stands. The modern town of Capua was founded after the ancient one had been destroyed by the Saracens in 841AD. Julius Caesar as consul in 59BC succeeded in establishing a Roman colony under the name Julia Felix in connection with his agrarian law, and 20,000 Roman citizens were settled in the territory.\n\nBookOneLXXXI A prophecy regarding Caesar’s assassination discovered by the colonists.\n\nBookThreeXL BookFourLVII Tiberius dedicated a Temple of Capitoline Jupiter at Capua in 26AD.\n\nCapys, in Greek mythology, was son of Assaracus, and father of Anchises and so grandfather of Aeneas. He founded the city of Capua.\n\nBookOneLXXXI Mentioned, as the founder.\n\nCarmel is a coastal mountain range in northern Israel stretching from the Mediterranean Sea towards the southeast. The city of Haifa is built on its slopes. Elijah, or Elias, the 9th century BC Jewish prophet is associated with sites at the northwestern and highest point of the range, presumed to once include an altar to Yahweh. In the fourth century BC, the neo-Platonic philosopher Iamblicus, in his life of Pythagoras, speaks of Mount Carmel as ‘most sacred of mountains access to which is forbidden to the profane’. Tacitus mentions an altar as erected there without temple or image: ‘tantum ara et reverentia’. Josephus speaks of it as an Essene stronghold.\n\nBookEightV Vespasian consulted the ‘oracle’ there.\n\nCarnulus, was an unknown victim of Tiberius’ persecutions.\n\nBookThreeLXI Mentioned.\n\nCarthage was a city located on the eastern side of Lake Tunis, Tunisia. According to Roman legend it was founded in 814BC by Phoenician colonists from Tyre under the leadership of Elissa (Queen Dido). It became a major power in the Mediterranean, and resulting rivalry with Syracuse and Rome led to several wars and mutual invasions.\n\nBookFiveXLII Claudius wrote an eight-volume Carthaginian history.\n\nCasca Brothers, Publius Servilius Casca (d. c. 42BC) and his brother Gaius Servilius Casca, a close friend of Caesar, both joined in his assassination. Casca struck the first blow. At the time Publius held the position of Tribune of the people. After the assassination he fled Rome, and his colleague as tribune, Publius Titius, deprived him of office. Casca joined Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius, the leaders of the assassins. He seems to have died, probably by suicide, in the aftermath of their defeat at the Battle of Philippi.\n\nBookOneLXXXII One of the brothers attacks Caesar.\n\nCassiope, modern Kassiopi, was a port on the north east coast of the island of Corfu. The town is said to have been founded during the reign of Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, in the 3rd Century BC, as a supply post during his war with Rome. After their conquest of the island in 230BC, the Romans visited the Temple of Zeus (Jupiter) there.\n\nBookSixXXII Nero arrived there on his Greek trip. The connection of Jupiter with the name Cassius is also referenced in BookFourLVII.\n\nCassius Longinus, Gaius (before 85BC – October 42BC) was a Roman senator, a leading instigator of the plot to kill Julius Caesar and the brother in-law of Marcus Junius Brutus. He was an ally of the triumvir, Marcus Licinius Crassus. After Crassus was killed fighting the Parthians (53BC), he regrouped the remnants of the defeated Roman army and repelled Parthian attacks on Syria. He was made tribune (49BC) and served as a naval commander of Pompey’s fleet in the civil war with Caesar. Caesar pardoned him and appointed him legate, with the promise that he would be made governor of Syria in 44BC. Despite this, Cassius organized the conspiracy to assassinate Caesar. Six months later he withdrew to Syria and ousted the former governor, Publius Cornelius Dolabella. He appointed Herod governor of Coele-Syria (Lebanon). To gain much needed revenues for the civil war with Caesar’s heirs, Mark Antony and Octavian, he ordered procurators in Syria and Palestine, including Antipater, to collect heavy taxes. He joined forces with Brutus at Philippi, Macedonia (42BC), but committed suicide after the defeat.\n\nBookOneLXXX BookSevenIII A leader of the conspiracy.\n\nBookOneLXXXV The populace tried to burn his house down after the assassination of Caesar.\n\nBookTwoIX BookSixIII BookSevenXXXIII Defeated by the forces of Augustus (Octavian) and Mark Antony at Philippi.\n\nBookThreeLXI Described as ‘Last of the Romans’.\n\nCassius, Lucius. The individual referred to is unclear. It appears from the context that he is not to be confused with Lucius Cassius Longinus, the brother of Gaius the conspirator, who fought on Caesar’s side in the Civil Wars.\n\nBookOneLXIII Caesar accepts his surrender.\n\nCassius Chaerea, Gaius, was a centurion in the army of Germanicus and served in the Praetorian Guard under the emperor Caligula, whom he assassinated. According to Tacitus, before his service in the Praetorians, he distinguished himself in helping to subdue the mutiny on the German frontier immediately after the death of Augustus. Shortly after the murder, he was sentenced to death, one of the few assassins to be actually condemned. Cassius requested to be executed with his own murder weapon.\n\nBookFourLVI His plan to assassinate Caligula.\n\nBookFourLVII Caligula warned against him by the oracle.\n\nBookFourLVIII His murder of Caligula. His shout of ‘Do it!’ is a translation of ‘Hoc age!’ the ritual response to the axe-holder’s question at the sacrifice of ‘Agone?’ ‘Shall it be done’. His shout of Accept his gift’ is a translation of the ritual formula ‘Accipe ratum’ meaning ‘Receive the fulfilment (of your omen).’\n\nCassius Longinus, Gaius the jurist was Governor of Syria in 50AD. Charged by Nero he was banished in 66AD to Sardinia, but returned under Vespasian. He wrote ten books on civil law. Suetonius says he was blind at the time of his banishment.\n\nBookSixXXXVII Charged by Nero.\n\nCassius Longinus, Lucius was the first husband of Caligula’s sister Julia Drusilla, marrying her in 33AD. He was consul in 30AD, and in early 37AD, was appointed by Tiberius as a commissioner. He was proconsul in Asia in 40AD. Caligula ordered Cassius to divorce Drusilla, so he could live incestuously with her. Caligula subsequently murdered Cassius, before his own assassination in 41AD, on the basis of an oracle indicating that ‘Cassius’ would assassinate him. Caligula was indeed assassinated by a Cassius, the tribune Cassius Chaerea.\n\nBookFourXXIV The husband of Drusilla.\n\nBookFourLVII His death ordered by Caligula on the basis of the oracle.\n\nCassius of Parma, Cassius Parmensis, was a minor poet, author of a Thyestes, and verses about Orpheus. He is probably not to be confused with one of Julius Caesar’s assassins of the same name.\n\nBookTwoIV Sneers at Augustus’ ancestry.\n\nCassius Patavinus, a plebeian banished for desiring to kill Augustus.\n\nBookTwoLI Mentioned.\n\nCassius Scaeva, Marcus, was a centurion in Caesar’s army at the Battle of Dyrrhachium, and later one of Caesar’s partisans.\n\nBookOneLXVIII His bravery at Dyrachium.\n\nCassius Severus, Titus (d. 32AD) was a jurist whose eloquent opposition to the governmental order finally led to his banishment. Tacitus in his Annals called him: ‘A man of base origin and dubious ways, but a powerful pleader, who brought his exile on himself, by his persistent quarrelsomeness.’ He was exiled to Crete by Augustus (AD8?), and subsequently to the island of Seriphos by Tiberius (24AD). His works were proscribed but later re-published under Caligula.\n\nBookTwoLVI His case (9BC) against Nonius Asprenas.\n\nBookFourXVI Caligula reinstated his writings.\n\nBookSevenXXXVI Used as a source by Suetonius.\n\nCastor, see Pollux.\n\nBookOneX BookThreeXX BookFourXXII BookSixI Mentioned.\n\nBookSevenXXXII Castor’s place was twelve miles from Cremona according to Tacitus Histories 2.24, and was probably the site of a temple to the twins.\n\nCastricius was a dependant of Augustus, and defended by him in court.\n\nBookTwoLVI Mentioned.\n\nCatilina, Lucius Sergius (108BC – 62BC) is best known for the Catiline (or Catilinarian) conspiracy, an attempt to overthrow the Republic, and in particular the power of the aristocratic Senate. Catiline fled Rome after Cicero’s denunciation of him, and died leading his rebel army at Pistoria (modern Pistoia).\n\nBookOneXIV The conspiracy exposed.\n\nBookOneXVII Caesar falsely indicted as a co-conspirator.\n\nBookTwoIII Mentioned.\n\nBookTwoXCIV Augustus was born on the day the conspiracy was debated in the Senate (23rd September, 63BC)\n\nCato the Elder, Marcus Portius (234BC – 149BC) was statesman and writer, commonly known as Cato the Censor, or the Elder, to distinguish him from his great-grandson, Cato the Younger. He successively held the offices of Cursus Honorum: Tribune (214BC), Quaestor (204BC), Aedile (199BC), Praetor (198BC), Consul (195BC) and finally Censor (184BC).\n\nBookTwoLXXXVI Cato’s most important work, Origines, in seven books, related the history of the Italian towns, with special attention to Rome, from their legendary or historical foundation to his own day. The text as a whole is lost, but substantial fragments survive in quotations by later authors.\n\nCato Uticensis, Marcus Portius (95BC, Rome – April 46BC, Utica), commonly known as Cato the Younger (Cato Minor) to distinguish him from his great-grandfather (Cato the Elder), was a politician and statesman in the late Roman Republic, and a follower of the Stoic philosophy. He is remembered for his legendary stubbornness and tenacity (especially in his lengthy conflict with Gaius Julius Caesar), as well as his immunity to bribes, his moral integrity, and his famous distaste for the ubiquitous corruption of the period.\n\nBookOneXIV His speech against the Catiline conspirators in 63BC.\n\nBookOneXIX He accepted bribery as valid to defend the Constitution, according to Suetonius.\n\nBookOneXX Imprisoned by Caesar after Cato’s attempt at a filibuster.\n\nBookOneXXX His threats to impeach Caesar.\n\nBookOneLIII His comment on Caesar’s sobriety.\n\nBookTwoXIII Marcus Favonius’ imitation of him in everything.\n\nBookTwoLXXXV Brutus wrote a eulogy of Cato replied to by Augustus.\n\nBookTwoLXXXVII An expression of Augustus referring to this Cato.\n\nCatullus, see Valerius\n\nCatulus Lutatius, Quintus (c. 120 – 61BC), sometimes called Capitolinus, was the son of Quintus Lutatius Catulus. He inherited his father’s hatred of Marius, and was a consistent though moderate supporter of the aristocracy. In 78 he was consul with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. He consistently opposed Julius Caesar, whom he endeavoured to implicate in the Catilinarian conspiracy. Catulus held the office of censor, but soon resigned, being unable to agree with his colleague Crassus.\n\nBookOneXV Caesar accused him of embezzlement during the reconstruction of the temple on the Capitol, and proposed to obliterate his name from the inscription and deprive him of the office of commissioner for its restoration. Catulus’ supporters rallied, and Caesar dropped the charge.\n\nBookTwoXCIV An omen relating to Augustus. Catulus re-dedicated the Capitoline temple in 65BC, Augustus was born in 63, and Catulus died in 61. So if this Catulus is intended, the story only makes sense if he had the dream some time after 63 and before his death, and that in the infant Octavius he saw a likeness to the older boy of the dream.\n\nBookSevenII BookSevenIII Galba was his great-grandson, his mother Mummia Achaica being the grand-daughter of Catulus.\n\nCeladus, was a freedman of Augustus.\n\nBookTwoLXVII Mentioned.\n\nCeraunian Mountains, are a coastal mountain range in southwestern Albania. The range extends approximately 100 km along the coast in a northwesterly direction from the Greek border to the Strait of Otranto. The highest peak is Çika (2012m). In some places the mountains slope down directly to the sea.\n\nBookTwoXVII Augustus’ met with a storm at sea along the coast in 30BC.\n\nCeres, was the Roman goddess of harvest, fertility, marriage, sacred law, and the cycle of life and death. She was equivalent to the Greek Demeter, who with her daughter Persephone was a central figure in the Eleusinian Mysteries, celebrated at Elusis near Athens, which predated the Olympian pantheon.\n\nBookTwoXCIII Augustus had been initiated in the Mysteris at Eleusis (after Actium, and he returned to Greece in 20BC, when he had the rites celebrated out of season).\n\nBookFiveXXV Claudius attempted to transfer the Eleusinian rites to Rome.\n\nBookSixXII The priestesses of Demeter viewed the athletics contest at Olympia in Elis.\n\nBookSixXXXIV Nero did not dare participate in the rites after his mother’s execution.\n\nCerrinius, Gallus, was a Roman Senator, who went blind and was dissuaded by a visit from Augustus from starving himself to death.\n\nBookTwoLIII Mentioned.\n\nCerylus was a wealthy freedman who changed his name to Laches and claimed to be freeborn in order to avoid death duties.\n\nBookEightXXIII Mocked by Vespasian.\n\nCestius Gallus was an unknown member of the Cestia gens. Possibly he was a relation of Gaius Gallus Camerinus, who was Senator and Consul in 35AD.\n\nBookThreeXLII He was a licentious senator at the time of Tiberius.\n\nCharicles was a Greek physician. Some of his works may have been known to Galen.\n\nBookThreeLXXII Physician to Tiberius.\n\nChatti were an ancient Germanic tribe whose homeland was near the upper Weser. They settled in central and northern Hesse and southern Lower Saxony, along the upper reaches of the Weser River and in the valleys and mountains of the Eder, Fulda and Weser River regions.\n\nBookSevenXLIX Vitellius consulted a prophetess of the tribe.\n\nBookEightXLII Domitian campaigned against the Chatti in 82/83AD.\n\nChios is the fifth largest of the Greek islands, situated in the Aegean Sea, five miles off the coast of Asia Minor. The island is separated from Turkey by the Chios Strait. After its Roman re-conquest in 85BC, Chios became part of the province of Asia. The area is earthquake-prone, witness the great quake of 1881AD.\n\nBookThreeVIII Tiberius acted as advocate in Rome for the citizens after a devastating earthquake.\n\nCilicia was the commonly used name of the south coastal region of Asia Minor south of the central Anatolian plateau. It existed as a political entity from Hittite times into the Byzantine Empire. Cilicia extends inland from the southeastern coast of modern Turkey, due north and northeast of the island of Cyprus. Ancient Cilicia was naturally split into Cilicia Trachea (Rugged Cilicia) and Cilicia Pedias to the east, divided by the Lamas Su.\n\nBookOneIII The young Julius Caesar campaigned there.\n\nBookOneVIII Legions conscripted for the campaign there, garrisoned in the Latin colonies.\n\nBookEightVIII Vespasian reduced Trachean Cilicia from free to provincial status.\n\nChristians were early followers of Jesus of Nazareth, the religion reaching Rome as an obscure offshoot of Judaism.\n\nBookSixXVI Nero clamped down on the new superstition of Christianity from AD64.\n\nChrestus appears to have instigated trouble in Rome, caused by the Jews. This may be a reference to early Christianity\n\nBookFiveXXV Mentioned.\n\nCicero, see Tullius\n\nCimbri. The Cimbri were a tribe from Northern Europe (possibly Jutland), who, together with the Teutones and the Ambrones threatened the RomanRepublic in the late 2nd century BC. They were annihilated at the Battle of Vercellae, at the confluence of the Sesia River with the Po River, in 101BC.\n\nBookOneXI Defeated by Marius.\n\nBookFourLI Their advance into Italy.\n\nCinaria, Cinarus, or Zinari, the modern Kinaros, is an islet located in the northern part of the Dodecanese, to the east of Kalymnos and Leros and to the west of Amorgos. It is 17 miles from Aigiali on Amorgos, and together with the neighbouring islet Levitha forms the geographical boundary between the island complexes of the Cyclades and the Dodecanese. The islet’s name is also that of the globe artichoke (kinara) which may have grown there (see the Greek myth of Cynara).\n\nBookThreeLVI Xeno, a Greek companion, exiled there by Tiberius.\n\nCincinnatus, Lucius Quinctius (519BC – 438BC) served as consul in 460BC and dictator in 458BC and 439BC. An invasion caused him to serve Rome as dictator, an office which he immediately resigned after completing his task of defeating the tribes of the Aequians, Sabinians and Volscians. His relinquishment of office at the end of the crisis has often been cited as an example of outstanding civic virtue, and modesty.\n\nBookFourXXXV Caligula deprived his descendants of the emblem of the family.\n\nCirceii: Monte Circeo or Cape Circeo is a mountain promontory that marks the southwestern limit of the former Pontine Marshes, and is associated with an oracular Temple of Circe, the sorceress mentioned in Homer. It is located on the southwest coast about 100km south/southeast of Rome, near San Felice Circeo, on the coast between Anzio and Terracina. At the northern end of the Gulf of Gaeta, Circei was founded as a Roman colony at an early date probably c. 390BC. At the beginning of the imperial period, the city was located on the eastern shores of the Lago di Paola, this did not, however, mean the abandonment of the eastern end of the promontory, on which stand the remains of several villas. A rock inscription near San Felice, speaks of this part of the promonturium Veneris (‘promontory of Venus’; the only case of the use of this name) as belonging to the city of Circei. The town only acquired municipal rights after the Social War, and was a seaside resort. For its villas Cicero compares it with Antium, and probably Tiberius and Domitian possessed villas there.\n\nBookTwoXVI Lepidus was exiled for life there.\n\nBookThreeLXXII Tiberius halted there for a while during his last illness.\n\nCircus Maximus, was the ancient Roman stadium situated in the valley between the Aventine and Palatine hills, with a capacity of over a quarter of the city’s population (of a million people).\n\nBookOneXXXIX BookFourXXVI Mentioned.\n\nBookFourXVIII Caligula presented Games there.

In 43AD she married Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus. She married Messalina’s half-brother Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix in 47AD. In 58/59AD, Faustus Sulla was exiled, and later murdered in 62AD on the orders of Nero. Nero subsequently charged Claudia with conspiracy and executed her.\n\nBookFiveXXVII Mentioned.\n\nBookFiveXXIX Her husband Gnaeus was executed on Claudius’s orders.\n\nBookSixXXXV Executed on Nero’s orders.\n\nClaudia, or Clodia Pulchra (b. c. 56BC) was the daughter of Fulvia and her first husband Publius Clodius Pulcher. She was the stepdaughter of Mark Antony, whom Fulvia later married. Octavian married Clodia in 43BC, divorcing her to later marry Scribonia. His marriage with Clodia was never consummated.\n\nBookTwoLXII Marriage to Octavian.\n\nClaudia Augusta was the daughter of Nero by Poppaea Sabina. She died at three months old in 63AD.\n\nBookSixXXXV She died in infancy.\n\nClaudia, was one of the five daughters, named Claudia, of Appius Claudius Caecus, and a sister of Publius Claudius Pulcher.\n\nBookThreeII Noted as a ‘bad’ Claudian.\n\nClaudia Quinta was probably the sister of the Appius Claudius Pulcher who was consul in 212BC, and the granddaughter of Appius Claudius Caecus. Around 205BC the statue of the Cult of Cybele was moved from Pessinus to Rome. Claudia re-floated the boat carrying the sacred image, dragging it from the shoal in the Tiber where it was stranded. The Temple of Cybele was then established on the Palatine.\n\nBookThreeII Mentioned as a ‘good’ Claudian.\n\nClaudius, Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (10BC – 54AD) was named Tiberius Claudius Drusus to 4AD, then Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus until his accession. He was the fourth Roman Emperor ruling from 41AD to his death. Born in Lugdunum in Gaul (modern Lyon) to Drusus the Elder and Antonia Minor, and brother to Germanicus, he was the first Roman emperor to be born outside Italy. Claudius proved an able administrator and a great builder of public works. His reign saw an expansion of the empire, including the conquest of Britain.\n\nBookFourXV Caligula awarded him joint consulship with himself on Caligula’s accession in 37AD.\n\nBookFourXXI He completed the aqueduct near Tibur started by Caligula.\n\nBookFourXXIII Caligula preserved him as a laughing-stock.\n\nBookFourXLIX Claudius supposedly disposed of a chest of poisonous materials left behind by Caligula.\n\nBookFiveI Suetonius’ life of Claudius follows.\n\nBookFiveXXX The most recently suggested diagnoses of Claudius’s disabilities include cerebral palsy, Tourette syndrome, and dyspraxia.\n\nBookSixVI BookSixVII Claudius when Emperor adopted Nero, in AD50, to secure the succession.\n\nBookSixVIII His death and Nero’s succession.\n\nBookSixIX Nero gave his eulogy and announced his deification.\n\nBookSixXVIII Nero considered withdrawing from Britain but changed his mind in deference to his adoptive father Claudius’s achievement.\n\nBookSixXXXIII BookSixXXXIX Nero’s involvement in his murder.\n\nBookSixXXXV Nero had his daughter Claudia Antonia executed.\n\nBookSevenVII His promotion of Galba.\n\nBookSevenXIV Galba reversed his decision on the duration of law terms.\n\nBookSevenXXIV Camillus’s Dalmation revolt against him in 42AD.\n\nBookSevenXXXVII Vitellius’s father Lucius ran the Empire while Claudius was campaigning in Britain in 43AD. He curried favour with Claudius as well as his wife Messalina and his freedmen.\n\nBookSevenXXXIX Vitellius endeared himself to Claudius through his love of dice.\n\nBookEightIV Vespasian was appointed to military command under him.\n\nBookEightIX Vespasian completed his shrine on the Caelian Hill.\n\nBookEightXXV The length of Claudius’s reign (13 years) plus Nero’s (14 years) equates to that of Vespasian’s (10) plus Titus’s (2) and Domitian’s (15), twenty seven years in total.\n\nBookEightXXVII His freedman Narcissus.\n\nBookEightXL His premature celebration of the Secular Games.\n\nClaudius, Atta, otherwise Appius Claudius Sabinus Inregillensis or Regillensis, was the semi-legendary founder of the Claudii. Born in the Sabine territories, he favoured peace with Rome, and moved with a group of followers to the City. Claudius became consul of Rome in 495BC. His harsh enforcement of debt laws forced a secession of the plebs in 494BC - 493BC. His sons were Appius Claudius Sabinus, Consul in 471BC and Gaius Claudius Sabinus, Consul in 460BC.\n\nBookThreeI Head of the Claudians c. 500BC.\n\nClaudius Caecus, Appius (c. 340BC - 273BC) was the son of Gaius Claudius Crassus, dictator in 337BC. He was a censor in 312BC although he had not previously been consul. As censor, he built the Appian Way between Rome and Capua, as well as Rome’s first aqueduct the Aqua Appia. He also published the first list of legal procedures and a legal calendar. He cultivated literature and rhetoric, and instituted reforms in Latin orthography. He later served as consul twice, in 307BC and 296BC. In 292BC and 285BC he was Dictator. In 280BC, when blind, he spoke against Cineas, an envoy of King Pyrrhus of Epirus, declaring that Rome would never surrender. This is the first recorded political speech in Latin, and the source of the saying ‘every man is the architect of his own fate.’ His younger brother was Appius Claudius Caudex, and his sons included Publius Claudius Pulcher and the first Tiberius Claudius Nero, thus making him the common ancestor of the Emperor Tiberius through the maternal and paternal lines respectively.\n\nBookThreeII A ‘good’ Claudian.\n\nBookThreeIII Mentioned as the joint ancestor of Tiberius’ paternal and maternal lines.\n\nBookFiveXXIV He allowed the grandsons of freedmen to become Senators.\n\nClaudius Caudex, Appius was the brother of Appius Claudius Caecus, their father being Gaius Claudius Crassus. He served as consul in 264BC, and drew Rome into conflict with Carthage over possession of Sicily. He fought successfully against the Carthaginians and Syracusans for Sicily, defeating both. This dispute was one of the immediate causes of the First Punic War.\n\nBookThreeII A ‘good’ Claudian.\n\nClaudius Crassus Sabinus Inregillenis, Appius, was a decemvir of the Roman Republic. His father was Appius Claudius Sabinus, Consul in 471BC. Claudius Crassus was involved in the civil war between the decemvirs and the senate, which ended in defeat for the decemvirs, while the consulship and tribunate were reestablished. Appius’ decemviral code survived the overthrow of the decemvirs in 449BC. He was claimed to have been murdered or committed suicide as a consequence of his lust for Verginia, the daughter of Lucius Verginius, a respected centurion (the story is told in Livy 3:44-58)\n\nBookThreeII A ‘bad’ Claudian.\n\nClaudius Marcellus, Marcus, see Marcellus\n\nClaudius Marcellus Aeserninus, Marcus was son of the Marcus Claudius Marcellus Aeserninus who was consul in 22BC. He married Asinia, the daughter of Gaius Asinius Pollio, who was consul in 40BC. When a boy he broke his leg while acting in the Trojan games before Augustus, a circumstance of which his grandfather, Asinius Pollio, complained so loudly that the custom was abolished. He was trained by his grandfather in oratory, and in 20AD was one of those whom Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso requested to undertake his defence on the charge of having poisoned Germanicus, but he declined the office\n\nBookTwoXLIII His injury mentioned.\n\nClaudius Nero, Tiberius was the fourth son of Appius Claudius Caecus, and the paternal ancestor of the Emperor Tiberius.\n\nBookThreeIII Mentioned as an ancestor of Tiberius.\n\nClaudius (Appius) Pulcher, Publius (d. c. 249BC) was the second son of Appius Claudius Caecus. He was the first of the Claudii to be given the cognomen ‘Pulcher’ (handsome). He was curule aedile in 253 and consul in 249BC, when he commanded a Roman fleet during the First Punic War. He lost the Battle of Drepana against the Carthaginians after ignoring an adverse omen whereby the sacred chickens refused to eat. He was recalled to Rome and ordered to appoint a dictator; his nomination of his subordinate Marcus Claudius Glycias was overruled. He was tried for incompetence and impiety, and was fined, dying soon afterwards, possibly by suicide. He was a maternal ancestor of the Emperor Tiberius.\n\nBookThreeII A ‘bad’ Claudian.\n\nBookThreeIII Mentioned as an ancestor of Tiberius.\n\nClaudius Pulcher, Appius (d. c. 130BC) was consul in 143BC. He defeated the Salassi, but was refused a triumph by the senate, and triumphed at his own expense. When one of the tribunes attempted to drag him from his chariot, his sister Claudia, one of the sacred Vestal Virgins, accompanied him to the Capitol. He held the censorship, with Quintus Fulvius Nobilior, probably in 136BC. He allied with Tiberius Gracchus who married his daughter Claudia. Appius backed Tiberius’ land reform bill and in 133BC with Tiberius and Tiberius’ brother, Gaius Gracchus, was chosen commissioner for the division of land. He died shortly after Tiberius Gracchus, probably in 130BC. He was one of the Salii, an augur, and princeps senatus, and his wife was named Antistia.\n\nBookThreeII His triumph.\n\nClaudius Russus, Appius, was consul in 268BC, with Publius Sempronius Sophus. They celebrated a triumph for their victory over the Picenians, atAncona, in Picenum, the region on the Adriatic coastal plain which is now known as the southern Marche.\n\nBookThreeII A ‘bad’ Claudian.\n\nClaudius Tiberius Nero, Gaius, was praetor in 212BC. In 207BC he was elected consul with Marcus Livius Salinator, and with his colleague he led the army that defeated the Carthaginians at the Battel of the Metaurus River, killing their commander, Hannibal’s brother Hasdrubal. He was censor with Marcus Livius Salinator in 204BC.\n\nBookThreeII A ‘good’ Claudian.\n\nClemens was a former slave of Agrippa Postumus, the grandson of Augustus, who was executed when Tiberius came to power. Clemens pretended to be Postumus, and gained a significant band of followers, but was captured and executed by Tiberius.\n\nBookThreeXXV Mentioned.\n\nClemens, see also Arrecinus and Flavius\n\nCleopatra VII, (Late 69BC – August 12, 30BC) was the last person to rule Egypt as pharaoh – after her death Egypt became a Roman province. She was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, and originally ruled jointly with her father Ptolemy XII Auletes and later with her brothers, Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV, whom she also married, but eventually became sole ruler. As pharaoh, she consummated a liaison with Gaius Julius Caesar that solidified her grip on the throne. She later elevated her son with Caesar, Caesarion, to co-ruler in name. After Caesar's assassination in 44BC, she aligned with Mark Antony in opposition to Caesar's legal heir, Gaius Julius Caesar Octavian, (later known as Augustus). After losing the Battle of Actium to Octavian's forces, Antony committed suicide. Cleopatra followed suit, according to tradition killing herself by means of an asp bite on August 12, 30BC.\n\nBookOneXXXV BookOneLII Her alliance with Caesar.\n\nBookTwoXVII Her children by Antony and Caesar, and her suicide.\n\nBookTwoLXIX She married Mark Antony, according to the Egyptian rite, it was said, the fact supporting his calling her his ‘wife’\n\nBookSixIII Mentioned.\n\nCleopatra Selene II (40BC - 6AD), also known as Cleopatra VIII of Egypt was a Ptolemaic Princess and the only daughter of Cleopatra VII of Egypt and the triumvir Mark Antony. In late 34BC, she was made ruler of Cyrenaica and Libya. Between 26BC and 20BC, Augustus arranged her marriage with King Juba II of Numidia in Rome.\n\nBookFourXXVI Mother of Ptolemy of Mauretania.\n\nClitumnus, the River Clitunno, rises from a spring near the Via Flaminia, the road from Rome to Ariminum (Rimini), near the town of Campello sul Clitunno, between Spoleto and Trevi: the area was celebrated by the Romans for its beauty. There was originally a pagan shrine with prophetic oracle dedicated to the river god Clitumnus.\n\nBookFourXLIII Caligula visited the shrine.\n\nClodianus was a subaltern involved in the assassination of Domitian in 96AD.\n\nBookEightLIII Mentioned.\n\nClodius Pulcher, Publius (c. 92BC - 53BC) was born Publius Claudius Pulcher but became known as Publius Clodius after his controversial adoption into the plebeian family of Fontei in 59BC. He was a politician known for his populist tactics. He passed several significant laws (the Leges Clodiae) but is chiefly remembered as a politican for his feuds with Titus Annius Milo and Marcus Tullius Cicero and for his introduction of the grain dole.\n\nBookOneVI His alleged seduction of Caesar’s wife Pompeia led to their divorce. Caesar supported him politically and Clodius was acquitted of charges of immorality.\n\nBookOneXX Favoured by Caesar as an opponent of Cicero.\n\nBookOneXXVI Assassinated by, or died in a street fight with, Milo’s supporters in late 53 or early 52BC.

Cicero was driven from the City in 59/58.\n\nBookEightXLV The specific law is not recorded, but may have been one of the Leges Clodiae.\n\nClodius Macer, Lucius, was a legatus in Africa under Nero. He rebelled in May 68AD, cutting off the food supply to Rome. Although encouraged by Galba, Macer created an additional legion, raising suspicion that he harbored imperial ambitions, and in October of 68 Galba had him killed.\n\nBookSevenXI Mentioned as a rival to Galba.\n\nClodius Pollio was a man of praetorian rank lampooned by Nero in a verse entitled Luscio (The One-Eyed Man).\n\nBookEightXXXVII Mentioned with regard to Domitian.\n\nClodius Thrasea Paetus, Publius (d. 66AD) was a stoic philosopher and consul in 56AD, and one of the keepers of the Sibylline books. He opposed Nero and was forced to retire from public life in AD63. He was subsequently driven to suicide in AD66. He was a friend and relative of the poet Persius.\n\nBookSixXXXVII Driven to suicide by Nero.\n\nBookEightXLVI His eulogy by Junius Rusticus.\n\nClunia, or Colonia Clunia Sulpicia, was a Roman city located on Alto de Castro, in the modern province of Burgos in Spain. The city was formally re-founded ex novo during the reign of Tiberius as part of the Roman plan to pacify the region after the Cantabrian Wars. During Galba’s reign, Clunia was effectively the capital of the Empire.\n\nBookSevenIX The temple of Jupiter there.\n\nCluvius Rufus, Marcus, was consul suffectus in 45AD, during the reign of Claudius. He had been involved in the conspiracy to assassinate Caligula. In 69AD, Cluvius was governor of Hispania. On the death of Galba, Cluvius first swore allegiance to Otho, but soon afterwards became a partisan of Vitellius. He was an important historian whose writing and testimony, though now lost, were a source for Suetonius and others.\n\nBookSixXXI He introduced Nero’s singing performance on stage.\n\nCodeta, Lesser. The Codeta was a district on the right bank of the Tiber, so called because of the common horsetail (equisetum arvense) which grew there. The Lesser Codeta (Codeta Minor) is mentioned only in Suetonius, as that part of the Campus Martius in which Caesar constructed a lake for his mock naval battle, used in his triumph in 46BC. It may have been sited opposite the Codeta.\n\nBookOneXXXIX BookThreeLXXII Mentioned.\n\nColonia, Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, modern Cologne, lies on the River Rhine. One of the oldest cities in Germany, having been founded by the Ubii in the year 38BC, it was acknowledged as a colony by the Rome in 50AD.\n\nBookSevenXLV Vitellius sent Otho’s dagger with which he had committed suicide to the Temple of Mars at Colonia Agrippinensium.\n\nColumbus was a gladiator, one of the murmillones, whom Caligula disliked.\n\nBookFourLV Caligula had him poisoned for winning a contest.\n\nCommagene was a small kingdom, located in modern south-central Turkey, with its capital at Samosata (modern Samsat, near the Euphrates). The Kingdom maintained its independence until 17AD, when it was made a Roman province by Tiberius. It reemerged as an independent kingdom when Antiochus IV of Commagene was reinstated to the throne by order of Caligula, then deprived by that same Emperor, then restored a couple of years later by Claudius. This re-emergent Kingdom lasted until 72AD, when Vespasian finally made it a part of the Roman Empire.\n\nBookEightVIII Vespasian reduced Commagene from free to provincial status.\n\nCompitalia, a festival celebrated once a year in honor of the Lares Compitales, household deities of the crossroads to which sacrifices were offered at the places where two or more ways meet. The word comes from the Latin compitum, a cross-roads.\n\nBookTwoXXXI Revived by Augustus. As Augustus was now the pater patriae, the Lares of the emperor became the Lares of the State. Augustus set up Lares or Penates at places where two or more ways met and instituted an order of priests to attend to their worship. These priests were chosen from the libertini, people who had been legally freed from slavery, and were called Augustales.\n\nConfluentes, the site of modern Koblentz, is at the confluence of the Rhine with the Moselle. In 55BC Roman troops commanded by Julius Caesar reached the Rhine and built a bridge between Koblenz and Andernach. About 9 BC, the ‘Castellum apud Confluentes’, the fort at the confluence of the rivers, was one of the military posts established by Drusus the Elder. Remains of a large bridge built in 49AD by the Romans are still visible. The Romans built two castles as protection for the bridge, one in 9AD and another in the 2nd century, the latter being destroyed by the Franks in 259. The site of thevillage of Ambivartium (elsewhere Ambiatinus) is not known, but may have been one of the temple sites nearby.\n\nBookFourVIII It was claimed that Caligula was born near there.\n\nCorduba, the modern Córdoba, is a city in Andalusia southern Spain. Córdoba was conquered by the Romans in 206BC. In 169BC the Roman consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus founded a Latin colony alongside the pre-existing Iberian settlement. At the time of Julius Caesar, Córdoba was the capital of the Roman province of Hispania Ulterior Baetica. Seneca the Elder, Seneca the Younger, and Lucan came from there. In the reorganization of the Empire in 14BC, when Hispania was reorganised into three Imperial provinces, Baetica was governed by a proconsul who had formerly been a praetor, and was regarded as highly secure.\n\nBookTwoLI Mentioned.\n\nCordus, see Cremutius\n\nCorfinium was a city in Ancient Italy, on the eastern side of the Apennines, due east of Rome. It was near the modern Corfinio, in the province of L'Aquila (Abruzzo region).\n\nBookOneXXXIV Surrendered to Caesar in 49BC.\n\nBookSixII Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus the consul of 54BC was taken prisoner there and then released.\n\nCorinth was a city-state, on the Isthmus of Corinth, the narrow stretch of land that joins the Peloponnese to the mainland of Greece. To the west lies the Gulf of Corinth, to the east the Saronic Gulf. Corinth is about 48 miles southwest of Athens. The Romans under Lucius Mummius destroyed Corinth following a siege in 146BC. Julius Caesar refounded the city as Colonia laus Iulia Corinthiensis in 44BC shortly before his assassination. Under the Romans, it became the seat of government for Southern Greece or Achaia. Corinthian bronze, also called Corinthian brass or æs Corinthiacum, was a highly valuable metal alloy in classical antiquity, thought to be an alloy of copper with gold or silver (or both), although it has also been contended that it was simply a very high grade of bronze, manufactured in Corinth. Antique bronze items found in the ruins of Corinth were prized by Roman collectors.\n\nBookTwoLXX Augustus’s love of Corinthian bronzes.\n\nBookThreeXXXIV Tiberius seeks to set a ceiling on the price of Corinthian bronzes.\n\nBookSevenIII Sacked by Mummius in 146BC.\n\nCornelia (wife of Caesar, d. c. 69BC) The daughter of Lucius Cornelius Cinna, she married Julius Caesar, by whom she had a daughter, Julia.\n\nBookOneI Married to Julius Caesar.\n\nBookOneVI Caesar delivered her funeral eulogy.\n\nCornelia was a head of the Vestal Virgins who broke her vows under Domitian and whom he had executed.\n\nBookEightXLIV Mentioned.\n\nCornelius, see Scipio and Sulla\n\nCornelius, was a centurion in the army of Octavian in 43BC, sent to Rome to demand the consulship for their general.\n\nBookTwoXXVI Mentioned.\n\nCornelius Balbus, Lucius (called Maior the Elder to distinguish him from his nephew) was born in Gades early in the last century BC. He served in Hispania, and citizenship was conferred on him and his family by Pompey. He accompanied Pompey on his return to Rome, in 71BC. He also gained the friendship of Julius Caesar, had much to do with the formation of the First Triumvirate, and was one of Rome’s chief financiers. He accompanied Caesar when propraetor to Hispania (61BC), and to Gaul (58BC) as chief engineer (praefectus fabrum). With Oppius, he managed Caesar’s affairs at Rome, and became Caesar’s private secretary. After Caesar’s murder in 44BC, Balbus successful gained favour with Octavian; in 43/42 BC he was praetor, and in 40BC became the first naturalised Roman citizen to attain the consulship. The year of his death is not known. Balbus kept a diary of the chief events in his own and Caesar's life (Ephemeris), which has been lost. He ensured that Caesar’s Commentaries on the Gallic war were completed; and accordingly the 8th book of the Commentarii de Bello Gallico (which was probably written by his friend Hirtius at his instigation) is dedicated to him.\n\nBookOneLXXVIII BookOneLXXXI Mentioned.\n\nBookTwoXXIX BookTwoXLV The Theatre of Balbus in the Campus Martius was built by him and completed in 13BC.\n\nCornelius Cinna, Lucius (the consul, d. 84 BC) was a four-time consul of the Roman Republic, serving consecutive terms from 87BC to 84BC, and a member of the ancient Roman Cinna family of the Cornelii gens.\n\nBookOneI Father-in-law of Julius Caesar who married his daughter Cornelia.\n\nBookOneV Caesar spoke in favour of his return from exile, following his support for Lepidus’ civil insurgency.\n\nBookFourLX Mentioned.\n\nCornelius Cinna, Lucius was the son of the consul of the same name. His sister, Cornelia Cinna minor, was the first wife of Julius Caesar. In 78BC, he allied himself with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, after whose death he went into exile, in Spain. Caesar recalled him and as dictator promoted him to the praetorship. After Caesar’s death Cinna did not claim a Roman province to govern to which he was entitled. Cicero praised him for this act of self restraint. In 32BC he served as a suffect consul. After 47BC, Cinna married Pompeia Magna, the daughter of Pompey and his third wife Mucia Tertia.\n\nBookOneLXXXV The poet Helvius Cinna mistaken for him, and killed.\n\nCornelius Dolabella, Gnaeus was a consul in 81BC, with Marcus Tullius Decula, during the dictatorship of Sulla; though the consulships of that year were only nominal.

He returned to Rome but was denounced by a close friend Plancus Varus. He had married a former wife of Vitellius, namely Petronia. Partly influenced by Triaria his sister-in-law, Vitellius subsequently had him executed at Interamnium (Terni). (See Tacitus, Histories, i.88, ii.63).\n\nBookSevenXII Galba treated him as a rival.\n\nCornelius Dolabella, Publius (70BC - 43BC), came of a plebian family within the patrician gens Cornelia.

He was prefect of the Praetorian Guard, under Domitian, from 81 until his death in 87, when he was ambushed with the fifth legion, Legio V Alaudae, during an expedition into Dacia, at the First Battle of Tapae. The legion was annihilated, and Fuscus killed. Tapae, in modern Romania, was an outpost guarding Sarmisegetuza, the main Dacian centre.\n\nBookEightXLII Mentioned.\n\nCornelius Gallus, Gaius (c. 70BC - 26BC) was poet, orator and politician, In 29BC, he led a campaign to subdue a revolt in Thebes, and subsequently erected a monument in Philae to glorify his accomplishments. Gallus’ conduct brought him into disgrace with the emperor, and a new prefect was appointed. After his recall, Gallus put an end to his life. He wrote four books of elegies chiefly on his mistress Lycoris (a poetical name for Cytheris, a notorious actress), in which he took for his model Euphorion of Chalcis; he also translated some of this author's works into Latin. In 1978 a papyrus was found at Qasr Ibrim, in Egyptian Nubia, containing nine lines by Gallus, arguably the oldest surviving MS of Latin poetry\n\nBookTwoLXVI A friend who fell out of favour.\n\nCornelius Laco was prefect of the Praetorian Guard, under Galba from 68AD until his death in 69AD. Laco had replaced Tigellinus on Galba’s accession. When Otho was proclaimed emperor, Laco was banished to an island where he was later murdered on Otho’s orders.\n\nBookSevenXIV Mentioned.\n\nCornelius Nepos (c. 100BC – 24BC) was a Roman biographer. He was born at Hostilia, a village in Cisalpine Gaul not far from Verona. His Gallic origin is attested by Ausonius, and Pliny the Elder calls him Padi accola ('a dweller on the River Po, (Natural History III.22). He was a friend of Catullus, who dedicates his poems to him (I.3), and Cicero.
