        "text": "Suetonius: The Twelve Caesars - Index LMN\n\nLaberius, Decimus (c. 105BC - 43BC) was a Roman eques and writer of mimes. In 46BC, Julius Caesar ordered him to appear in one of his own mimes in a public contest with the actor Publilius Syrus. Caesar awarded the victory to Publilius, but restored Laberius to his equestrian rank, which he had forfeited by appearing as a mimus.\n\nBookOneXXXIX His appearance before Caesar.\n\nLabienus, Titus (c. 100BC – March 17, 45BC) served as Tribune of the Plebs in 63BC, and is remembered as one of Julius Caesar’s lieutenants, mentioned frequently in the accounts of his military campaigns. He was the father of Quintus Labienus who sided with Brutus and Cassius, and fought inParthia.\n\nBookOneXII At Caesar’s instigation, Labienus accused Gaius Rabirius of high treason (perduellio) for the murder of the tribune Lucius Appuleius Saturninus and of his uncle Titus Labienus in 100BC.\n\nLabienus, Titus, was an orator and historian in the time of Augustus, nicknamed Rabienus for his vigorous style. He may have been the son or grandson of Quintus Labienus. He was a friend of Cassius Severus. His writings were ritually burnt by Senate decree, probably in 12AD. Labienus thereafter committed suicide.\n\nBookFourXVI Caligula reinstated his writings.\n\nLaetorius, Gaius was a young patrician who identified the site of Augustus’ birthplace.\n\nBookTwoV Mentioned.\n\nLaetus, see Suetonius\n\nLanuvium, later Civita Lavinia, modern Lanuvio, is an ancient city of Latium some 32 km southeast of Rome, a little southwest of the Via Appia, situated on an isolated hill projecting south from the main mass of the Alban Hills, and commanding an extensive view over the low country between it and the sea. It was conquered by Rome in 338BC. It was especially famous for its rich and much venerated temple of Juno Sospes, from which Octavian (Augustus) borrowed money in 31BC.\n\nBookTwoLXXII Augustus spent time there.\n\nLaodicea on the Lycus, earlier known as Diospolis and Rhoas, was a city on on the river Lycus, in Anatolia near the modern village of Eskihisar (Eski Hissar). In 188BC, the city passed to the Kingdom of Pergamon, and after 133BC fell under Roman control. It suffered greatly during the Mithridatic Wars, but quickly recovered and under the first emperors, was one of the most important and flourishing commercial cities of Asia Minor, The location suffered from frequent earthquakes, especially in the reign of Nero (60AD), when it was completely destroyed, and subsequently rebuilt.\n\nBookThreeVIII Tiberius acted as advocate in Rome for the citizens after a devastating earthquake.\n\nLatin Festival: the first town established by the Latin people was Alba; around this sprung up other towns, e.g. Lanuvium, Aricia, Tusculum, Tibur, Praeneste, Laurentum, Roma, and Lavinium. The towns, thirty in number, formed the Latin Confederacy, with Alba at its head. An annual festival was celebrated with great solemnity by the magistrates on the Alban Mount, called the Latin Festival, where sacrifice was offered to their god, Jupiter (Latiaris). The Latin Festival lasted 3 to 4 days and had to take place early in the year since it required that the consuls still be in Rome prior to leaving on campaign.\n\nBookOneLXXIX Celebrated by Caesar.\n\nBookFiveIV Mentioned by Augustus, when banning the young Claudius from attending.\n\nBookSixVII Nero acted as judge at the Festival during Claudius’s reign.\n\nLatinus, was an actor in farces, a comic mime, at the time of Domitian. He was an informer, and a favourite of the Emperor, and is mentioned by Martial who gives his epitaph (ix:29). He often acted as mimus with Thymele as mima.\n\nBookEightLI Mentioned.\n\nLavicum, or Labicum, or Labici, near the modern Colonna, was located about 20 km southeast of Rome, on the Alban Hills.\n\nBookOneLXXXIII Caesar’s villa there.\n\nLentulus, Gnaeus Cornelius, was consul in 3BC.\n\nBookSevenIV Galba was born during his consulship.\n\nLentulus Augur, Gnaeus Cornelius (d. 25AD). Circa 1BC, he was proconsul of Asia. After the death of Augustus, he accompanied Drusus to Dalmatia in 14AD. He was a loyal supporter of the imperial house, and a member of the colleges of augurs.\n\nBookThreeXLIX He was supposedly driven to suicide by Tiberius.\n\nLentulus Gaetulicus, Gnaeus Cornelius (d. 39AD) was Consul in 26AD. He later became Legate of Germania Superior, possibly in succession to his brother. He served there from 29AD - 39AD while his father-in-law governed Germania Inferior. He became involved in a conspiracy against Caligula in 39AD, in league with Lepidus, the husband of Caligula’s late sister Drusilla. Caligula had Gaetulicus executed. He wrote poetry and other works.\n\nBookFourVIII One of Suetonius’s sources.\n\nBookFiveIX His involvement in the conspiracy.\n\nBookSevenVI Galba replaced him in Upper Germany.\n\nBookEightII Vespasian proposed he was refused public burial.\n\nLepida, Aemilia, was a daughter of Manius Aemilius Lepidus, consul in 11AD. She is commonly identified with Lepida, wife of the Emperor Galba. She was connected by inter-marriage to some of the Julii-Claudii. She bore Galba two sons. Galba Major the elder was born circa 25AD and is believed to have died c. 48AD. Galba Minor the younger was born before 30AD. He was a quaestor in 58AD, but is not recorded thereafter. His death is believed to have occurred c. 60AD. Lepida died in or after 40AD.\n\nBookSevenV The wife of Galba.\n\nLepida, Aemilia, was daughter to Lepidus the Younger, and sister to Manius Aemilius Lepidus (consul 11AD). She married the wealthy Roman Governor Publius Sulpicius Quirinius. In her younger years, she was engaged to Lucius Caesar, and had borne a son to senator Mamercus Aemilius Scaurus.\n\nBookThreeXLIX In 20AD, she was charged with adultery, consulting astrologers, falsely claiming to have borne a son to her ex-husband Quirinius and attempting to poison him. At her trial her brother defended her. She was found guilty and executed.\n\nLepidus, see Aemilius\n\nLiber, Dionysus, or Bacchus was the Greek god of wine, theatre, and fertility. His festival was the Liberalia, celebrated on March 17.\n\nBookTwoXCIV An oracular grove of the god in Thrace, possibly the sanctuary and oracular shrine at Perperikon (near modern Kardzhali, Bulgaria) dedicated to the god Sabazios (merged with the Greek Dionysus) of the Bessi was situated there.\n\nLiburnia was a region along the northeastern Adriatic coast, in modern Croatia. The Liburnians were noted for their seamanship and their fast galleys with one or two banks of oars. Illyrian and Liburnian pirate activities motivated Octavian to organize decisive operations in Illyricum in 35BC, to achieve Roman control. He commandeered Liburnian ships, and Liburnian galleys played a decisive role at the battle of Actium.\n\nBookFourXXXVII Caligula’s Liburnian galleys with ten banks of oars were a grotesque misapplication of the design.\n\nLicinius Macer Calvus, Gaius (82BC - c. 47BC) was an orator and poet, the son of Licinius Macer and thus a member of the gens Licinia, he was a friend of Catullus, whose style and subject matter he shared. Calvus’ oratical style opposed the Asian school in favor of a simpler Attic model: he characterized Cicero as wordy and artificial. Twenty-one speeches are mentioned, including several against Publius Vatinius. Calvus was apparently rather short in height, since Catullus alludes to him as salaputium disertum (the eloquent Lilliputian).\n\nBookOneXLIX On Caesar’s relationship with Nicomedes.\n\nBookOneLXXIII His epigrams against Caesar.\n\nBookTwoLXXII His house near the Forum occupied by Augustus.\n\nLicinius Crassus, Lucius (140BC – 91BC) was consul in 95BC. He was considered the greatest Roman orator of his day, by his pupil Cicero. In 92BC he was elected Censor.\n\nBookSixII Mentioned.\n\nLicinius Crassus, Marcus, (c. 115BC – 53BC) Roman general and politician who commanded the left wing of Sulla’s army at the Battle of the Colline Gate, suppressed the slave revolt led by Spartacus and entered into the political alliance known as the First Triumvirate, with Pompey and Julius Caesar. He was consul in 70BC and 55BC. As governor of Syria (54BC) Crassus invaded Parthia; and died defeated at the Battle of Carrhae in 53BC. BookOneIX Conspires with Julius Caesar in 65BC.\n\nBookOneXIX He was a member of the First Triumvirate with Caesar and Pompey, which was unofficial, and lasted from 60BC until his death in 53BC.\n\nBookOneXXI Caesar gave Pompey precedence over him.\n\nBookOneXXIV The First Triumvirate re-affirmed at Lucca in 56BC.\n\nBookOneL Caesar was reputed to have had an affair with his wife, Axia Tertulla.\n\nBookTwoXXI BookThreeIX His standards lost at Carrhae were recovered in 20BC.\n\nLicinius Crassus Frugi, Marcus, served as a praetor and then later as a consul with Lucius Calpurnius Piso in 27AD. Sometime after 44AD, he served as Roman Governor of Mauretania. In the spring of 47AD, Frugi, his wife, and his second son Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, who had married Claudius’ daughter Claudia, were executed on the orders of Messalina.\n\nBookFiveXVII His distinction at Claudius’s British triumph in 43AD\n\nLicinius Mucianus was sent by Claudius to Armenia with Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo. Under Nero he was suffect consul c. 65. At the time of the outbreak of the Jewish revolt in 66AD, he was governor of Syria, a post he still held during the Year of Four Emperors (69AD). He failed to put down the Jewish revolt and Vespasian was sent to replace him. After the death of Galba (69AD), both swore allegiance to Otho, but when civil war broke out Mucianus persuaded Vespasian to take up arms against Vitellius. Mucianus marched via Asia Minor and Thrace to attack Vitellius who was dead by the time he reached Rome. He was suffect consul in 70AD and 72AD. He published a collection of speeches and letters of Romans of the Republican period, and was the author of a natural history and geography of the East, quoted by Pliny regarding miraculous occurrences.\n\nBookEightVI His support for Vespasian.\n\nBookEightXIII Noted for his insolent and lewd behaviour.\n\nLicinus, Gaius Julius, was a slave and freedman of Augustus, employed by him as his procurator in Gaul.\n\nBookTwoLXVII Mentioned.\n\nLivia Drusilla, after 14AD called Julia Augusta (58BC - 29AD) was the third wife of the Emperor Augustus and his adviser. She was the mother of the Emperor Tiberius, paternal great-grandmother of the Emperor Caligula, paternal grandmother of the Emperor Claudius, and maternal great-great grandmother of the Emperor Nero. She was later deified by Claudius who acknowledged her title of Augusta, in 42AD. In 40BC her father had married her to Tiberius Claudius Nero, her cousin. Livia had two sons by him, the future emperor Tiberius, and Nero Claudius Drusus (Drusus the Elder). Octavian divorced Scribonia in 39BC to marry Livia who also divorced. Augustus, in his will, left her one third of his property, the other two thirds to Tiberius, and adopted her into the Julian family, granting her the honorific title of Augusta. Speaking against her became treason in 20AD, and in 24AD Tiberius granted her a theatre seat among the Vestal Virgins.\n\nBookTwoXXIX The Porticus of Livia, begun by Augustus on the site of the house of Vedius Pollio in 15BC, was dedicated to Livia in 7BC. It was situated on the north slope of the Oppius on the south side of the clivus Suburanus, between this street and the later baths of Trajan.\n\nBookTwoXL Mentioned regarding a minor request to Augustus.\n\nBookTwoLXII BookTwoLXIX Her marriage to Octavian (Augustus) in 38BC.\n\nBookTwoLXIII Her marriage to Augustus was childless.\n\nBookTwoLXXIII She made clothes for Augustus.\n\nBookTwoLXXXIV Augustus used to draft and read aloud his most important statements to her.\n\nBookTwoXCIX Augustus’ dying words to her.\n\nBookTwoCI Augustus appointed her as a main heir, receiving a third of the estate.\n\nBookThreeIV She was divorced by Tiberius father, Tiberius Nero in favour of Augustus in 39BC.\n\nBookThreeVI Fled with her husband Nero in 40BC, and the infant Tiberius.\n\nBookThreeVII She co-funded the young Tiberius’ gladiatorial contests in honour of his father and grandfather.\n\nBookThreeX Her attempts to persuade Tiberius to remain in Rome in 6BC.\n\nBookThreeXII Her interventions to help Tiberius in ‘exile’ on Rhodes.\n\nBookThreeXIII Her intervention to aid Tiberius’ recall from Rhodes in 2AD.\n\nBookThreeXIV Her attempts to identify the sex of her child while pregnant.\n\nBookThreeXXVI Tiberius refused to allow September and October to be renamed ‘Tiberius’ and ‘Livius’ (after Livia).\n\nBookThreeL BookThreeLI BookThreeLXI Tiberius’ enmity towards her.\n\nBookFourVII She dedicated a staue of Gaius Julius Caesar, a son of Germanicus who died in early childhood.\n\nBookFourXV Caligula awarded Antonia the Younger, his grandmother, all Livia’s honours in 37AD.\n\nBookFourXVI Caligula paid the bequests specified in her will, which Tiberius had suppressed.\n\nBookFourXXIII Caligula described her insultingly.\n\nBookFiveI The mother of Drusus the Elder, and grandmother of Claudius.\n\nBookFiveIII Her contemptuous treatment of the young Claudius.\n\nBookFiveIV Augustus writes to her regarding Claudius.\n\nBookFiveXI Claudius voted her divine honours.\n\nBookSevenI A portent associated with her regarding the line of Caesars.\n\nBookSevenV She showed Galba great favour and left him a substantial legacy which Tiberius appropriated.\n\nBookSevenXXIV Otho’s grandfather Marcus owed his Senate position to her.\n\nLivia Medullina Camilla was the second fiancée of the Emperor Claudius. She was the daughter of Marcus Furius Camillus, the consul of 8AD, who was a close friend of the Emperor Tiberius. Medullina unexpectedly fell ill and died on the day assigned for her wedding to Claudius. Furius Camillus Scribonianus was her adoptive brother.\n\nBookFiveXXVI She was betrothed to Claudius, but died before the marriage could take place.\n\nLivia Ocellina was the second wife of Galba’s father, Gaius. Galba was raised by her and took the name Lucius Livius Ocella (rather than his birth name of Servius Sulpicius Galba) prior to his assuming power.\n\nBookSevenIII Mentioned.\n\nBookSevenIV She formally adopted Galba.\n\nLivia Orestilla, or Cornelia Orestilla, was the second wife of Caligula, 37AD/38AD. She was originally married to Gaius Calpurnius Piso who was forced to annul the marriage so that Caligula could marry her. According to both Dio and Suetonius, this occurred during the wedding celebrations.\n\nBookFourXXV Caligula forcibly married her.\n\nLivilla, see Julia Livilla\n\nLivilla, (Claudia) Livia Julia known as Livilla (little Livia) (c. 13BC – 31AD), was the only daughter of Drusus the Elder and Antonia Minor. She was married twice, first in 2BC to Gaius Caesar, who died in 4AD, and then to her cousin Drusus the Younger, son of Tiberius. Her daughter Julia was born shortly after this second wedding. In 19AD she gave birth to twin sons of whom only Tiberius Gemellus survived infancy. At this time it appears she was seduced by Sejanus, Ancient sources (Tacitus, Suetonius, Cassius Dio) concur that with Livilla as his accomplice he poisoned her husband. In 31AD Tiberius received evidence from his sister-in-law Antonia Minor that Sejanus planned to overthrow him and had him put to death. Sejanus’ former wife Apicata committed suicide, but not before addressing a letter to Tiberius claiming that Drusus had been poisoned, with the complicity of Livilla. Livilla was then executed or committed suicide.\n\nBookThreeLXII The poisoning of her husband.\n\nBookFiveI Sister of Claudius and Germanicus.\n\nBookFiveIII Her reaction to prophecies of Claudius becoming Emperor.\n\nLivius, Titus (c. 59BC – c. 17AD), known as Livy was a historian who wrote a monumental history of Rome and the Roman people, Ab Urbe Condita Libri ‘From the Foundation of the City’ covering the earliest legends of Rome and the traditional foundation in 753BC through to the reign of Augustus and Livy’s own time.\n\nBookFourXXXIV Caligula considered banning his works, out of envy and malice.\n\nBookFiveXXV See Livy I:24 for the Fetial priests, the fetiales, an order of twenty priests drawn from the nobility who were involved in declarations of war and concluding treaties.\n\nBookFiveXLI He encouraged the young Claudius to write a history.\n\nBookEightXLVI His works mentioned.\n\nLivius Drusus Claudianus, Marcus, was born Appius Claudius Pulcher, but adopted into the Livii by Marcus Livius Drusus, tribune in 91BC. He was a direct descendant of the consul and censor Appius Claudius Caecus. He was praetor in 50BC, and in 42BC married his daughter Livia to Tiberius Nero, the father of the Emperor Tiberius. He fought at Philippi also in 42BC and committed suicide to avoid capture.\n\nBookThreeIII The maternal grandfather of the Emperor Tiberius.\n\nBookThreeVII Tiberius honoured him with a gladiatorial contest.\n\nLivius Drusus, the first of that surname, was granted it for killing a Gallic chieftain, Drausus, in personal combat. Livius was propraetor in Gallia Cisalpina, and was said to have brought back the gold paid to the Senones as a bribe to remove their army from Rome in 390BC. The story dates Drusus, and Drausus, to the consulship of Publius Cornelius Dolabella in 283BC, when the Senones were defeated and scattered, for the most part vacating northern Italy.\n\nBookThreeIII Mentioned as the first of that surname.\n\nLivius Drusus, Marcus the Elder (d. 108BC) was set up as tribune by the Senate in 121BC to undermine Gaius Gracchus land reform bills. To do this, he proposed creating colonies and relieving rent on property distributed since 133BC. He also proposed Latin allies should not be mistreated by Roman generals, which was the counter offer to Gaius’ offer of full citizenship. Drusus was consul in 112BC and fought in Macedonia. In 109BC he was elected censor with the elder Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, but died the next year.\n\nBookThreeIII Mentioned as a famous member of the Livii.\n\nLivius Drusus, Marcus the Younger son of Marcus Livius Drusus the Elder, was tribune of the plebeians in 91BC. He set out with comprehensive plans to strengthen senatorial rule. He was assassinated and the Italian allies revolted, starting the Social War of 91BC – 88BC. His adopted son was Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus the maternal grandfather of Tiberius.\n\nBookThreeIII Mentioned as a famous member of the Livii.\n\nLivius Salinator, Marcus, (254BC - c. 204BC) was elected consul with Lucius Aemilius Paulus shortly before the Second Illyrian War in 219BC. After leading a successful campaign against Illyrians, he was charged with malfeasance concerning war spoils during a mission to Carthage and was tried and found guilty upon his return to Rome. He retired from public life for several years, until 210. In 207 during the Second Punic War he was again elected consul with Gaius Claudius Nero. In the spring of 207BC, Livius, reinforced by Nero, defeated the Carthaginians in the decisive Battle of the Metaurus. He and Nero were awarded a triumph in 206BC. Livius remained as proconsul, defending Etruria between 206BC - 205BC and later Cisalpine Gaul from 204BC until the end of the war. He was elected censor again with Gaius Claudius Nero in 204BC. This was marred by constant quarreling with Nero, particularly concerning a salt tax (inspiring his cognomen Salinator), as well as by the vendetta against those responsible for his trial, continuing until his death.\n\nBookThreeIII Mentioned as a famous member of the Livii.\n\nLocri is a town in the province of Reggio Calabria, southern Italy. The name derives from the ancient Greek region Locris, home of the Locrians, The Italian city, Epizephyrian Locris (from Greek epi-Zephyros, ‘under the West Wind’ was founded by them c. 680BC on the Italian shore of the Ionian Sea, near modern Capo Zefirio, and was one of the cities of Magna Graecia. The city was abandoned in the fifth century AD. The remaining town was finally destroyed by the Saracens in 915.\n\nBookTwoXVI Augustus (Octavian) there in c. 36BC.\n\nLollia, the wife of Aulus Gabinius, was perhaps a daughter of Marcus Lollius Palicanus, tribunus plebis in 71BC.\n\nBookOneL Caesar was reputed to have had an affair with her.\n\nLollia Paulina (d. 49AD) was for six months in 38AD the third wife of the Emperor Caligula. Her first husband Publius Memmius Regulus was suffect consul in 31AD and a Roman Governor. Later on, Paulina became a rival to Caligula’s sister Agrippina the Younger and was considered a choice for fourth wife of Claudius, following the death of Valeria Messalina. In 49AD, Agrippina, now the wife of Claudius, had Paulina charged with sorcery. Her property was confiscated and she was sent into exile. Tacitus claims she was forced to commit suicide on Agrippina’s orders.\n\nBookFourXXV Forcibly married to Caligula.\n\nBookFiveXXVI Claudius considered marrying her.\n\nLollius Paulinus, Marcus, was the first governor of Galatia (25BC) and served as consul in 21BC. In 16BC, when governor of Gaul he was defeated by the Sicambri, Tencteri and Usipetes, German tribes who had crossed the Rhine. He was subsequently (2BC) tutor and adviser to Gaius Caesar, who accused him of extortion and treachery to the state, and denounced him to Augustus. To avoid punishment he is said to have taken poison.\n\nBookTwoXXIII His defeat in Germany.\n\nBookThreeXII His slanders against Tiberius c. 1BC, when he was guardian to Gaius, Governor of the East.\n\nBookThreeXIII His falling out with Gaius c. 2AD.\n\nLonginus, see Cassius\n\nLucca, Roman Luca, a city in Tuscany, central Italy, is situated on the river Serchio in a fertile plain near the Ligurian Sea. It became a Roman colony in 180BC, and lay just within the borders of Cisalpine Gaul.\n\nBookOneXXIV The First Triumvirate, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey met and re-affirmed their mutual pact, at Lucca, in 56BC.\n\nLucceius, Lucius, orator and historian, was friend and correspondent of Cicero. He failed to become consul in 60BC, retired from public life, and devoted his time to writing a history of the Social and Civil Wars. In the civil war between Caesar and Pompey, he took the side of Pompey; but, having been pardoned by Caesar, returned to Rome, where he lived in retirement until his death.\n\nBookOneXIX A candidate for the consulship of 60BC.\n\nLucullus, Lucius Licinius (c. 118BC - 57BC), was closely connected with Sulla. Over twenty years of almost continuous military and government service, he became the main conqueror of the eastern kingdoms in the course of the Third Mithridatic War, exhibiting extraordinary generalship abilities in diverse situations, most famously during the siege of Cyzicus, 73BC - 2BC, and at the battle of Tigranocerta in Armenian Arzanene, 69BC.\n\nBookOneXX Threatened with prosecution by Julius Caesar.\n\nBookThreeLXXIII Marius had a villa at Misenum on the promontory that Sulla’s daughter Cornelia bought when Marius was proscribed. She sold it a little later 76/75BC to Lucullus. The emperor Tiberius supposedly died there in 37AD. Castel dell’Ovo on the island of Megaride at Naples is also said however to be the site of the ‘Villa of Lucullus’.\n\nLucusta, (or Locusta, Tacitus) was an expert in the concoction of poisonous substances, employed by Nero.\n\nBookSixXXXIII BookSixXLVII Mentioned.\n\nLugdunum, modern Lyon (or Lyons), is a city in east-central France. Lyon was founded on the Fourvière hill as a Roman colony in 43BC by Munatius Plancus, on the site of a Gaulish hill-fort. The Celtic god Lug was equated by the Romans with Mercury. Agrippa recognized its location as a natural communications hub, and made it the focal point of the principal Roman roads through Gaul. It subsequently became the capital. Two emperors were born in the city, namely Claudius and Caracalla.\n\nBookFourXVII Caligula there in 40AD.\n\nBookFourXX Caligula gave entertainments there.\n\nBookFiveII Claudius was born there in 10BC, on 1st August when an altar to Augustus was dedicated.\n\nBookFiveIX The meeting between Caligula and Claudius probably took place there. The ‘river’ would therefore be the confluence of the Rhone and Saone.\n\nLuna, modern Luni, was an ancient city of Etruria, 4 miles southeast of modern Sarzana. It was the frontier town of Etruria, on the left bank of the river Macra (now Magra), the boundary in imperial times between Etruria and Liguria. It was renowned for the marble from the neighboring mountains ofCarrara.\n\nBookSixL Nero’s tomb adorned with an altar of Luna marble.\n\nLuperci were Roman priests who officiated at the festival of Lupercalia on February 15th. Tradition ties the formation of the Luperci to Romulus and Remus at which time the gens permitted to become Luperci were limited to the Fabii or Fabiani (whose name became that of a Roman tribe) and the Quinctilii or Quinctiliani. (The most famous member of the Quinctilia gens being the commander of the Roman forces at the disastrous battle of theTeutoberg Forest, Publius Quintilius Varus.) Caesar added the college of Julii or Juliani. The Luperci were not appointed for life, but could hold the position repeatedly.\n\nBookOneLXXVI Caesar’s creation of his own college of Luperci.\n\nBookOneLXXIX BookTwoXXXI The Lupercalia mentioned. Revived by Augustus.\n\nLusitanians, an Indo-European people, the inhabitants of Lusitania, the Roman province including approximately all of modern Portugal south of the Douro river and part of modern Spain (the present autonomous community of Extremadura and a small part of the province of Salamanca). Its capital was Emerita Augusta (currently Mérida, Spain), and it was initially part of the Republican province of Hispania Ulterior, before becoming a province of its own under the Empire.\n\nBookOneLIV Caesar attacked their townships.\n\nBookSevenIII Massacred in 151BC by Servius Sulpicius Galba.\n\nBookSevenXXVI Otho was governor of the province from 58AD - 68AD.\n\nLycians were inhabitants of a region on the southern coast of Turkey. The Lycian League was an early federation of ancient cities in the region, which later became a province of the Roman Empire in 43AD.\n\nBookTwoLXV Gaius Caesar died in Lycia in 4AD.\n\nBookFiveXXV Claudius deprived the Lycians of their independence in 43AD.\n\nBookEightVIII Vespasian reduced Lycia from free to provincial status.\n\nLycius, a dwarf presented at the Games, in Augustus’ day, as a curiosity.\n\nBookTwoXLIII Mentioned.\n\nMacer, see Clodius and Pompeius\n\nMacro, Quintus Naevius Cordus Sutorius (21BC - 38AD) was prefect of the Praetorian Guard, from 31AD until 38AD, serving under the Emperors Tiberius and Caligula. Macro was appointed Praetorian prefect by Tiberius after the arrest of Sejanus. He furthered his ambitions by befriending Caligula and turning a blind eye to his wife Ennia’s affair with Caligula c. 34AD. He was promised the governorship of Egypt but arrested in 38AD. Macro and Ennia both committed suicide.\n\nBookFourXII BookFourXXIII Mentioned.\n\nBookFourXXVI Condemned by Caligula.\n\nMaecenas, Gaius Cilnius, (70BC – 8BC) was a confidant and political advisor to Octavian (Augustus) and an important patron of Augustan poets. Maecenas served as a quasi-culture minister to the Emperor. His name has become a byword for enlightened patronage of the arts. He prided himself on his ancient Etruscan lineage, and first appears in 40BC, when he was employed by Octavian in arranging his marriage with Scribonia, and afterwards in assisting to negotiate the treaty of Brundisium and the reconciliation with Mark Antony. He was vicegerent of Octavian during the campaign that led to the battle of Actium, when, he crushed the conspiracy of Lepidus the Younger; during the subsequent absences of his leader in the provinces he again held the same position. Maecenas died leaving Augustus as his sole heir.\n\nBookTwoLXVI He was said to have leaked news of the Murena conspiracy to his wife Terentia.\n\nBookTwoLXXXVI Augustus ridiculed his elaborate style of speech.\n\nBookThreeXV The Gardens of Maecenas were the first in Rome to be built in the Hellenistic-Persian garden style. Maecenas sited them on the Esquiline Hill, on the summit of the Servian Wall and its adjoining necropolis, near the gardens of Lamia. They became imperial property after Maecenas’ death, and Tiberius lived there prior to his accession.\n\nBookSixXXXVIII The Tower of Maecenas was probably attached to the Gardens and connected to the Palatine by way of the Golden House.\n\nMaecius was an unknown friend of Domitian who had a high self-opinion of his looks.\n\nBookEightLVI Mentioned.\n\nMagi were followers of Zoroaster, or rather, a follower of what the Hellenistic world associated Zoroaster with, which was – in the main – the ability to read the stars, and manipulate the fate that the stars foretold. They were probably a sect of Persian origin but were found throughout Asia Minor, North Africa and the Mediterranean world.\n\nBookSixXXXIV Nero had them perform their rites to summon the dead.\n\nMago (243BC – 203BC), played an important role for Carthage in the Second Punic War, fighting in Hispania, Gallia Cisalpina and Italy. Mago was the third son of Hamilcar Barca, brother to Hannibal and Hasdrubal Barca.\n\nBookEightXLVI Mentioned.\n\nMallia, possibly a person but equally it may be a location.\n\nBookTwoLXX Mentioned.\n\nMallonia, an unknown woman sexually abused by Tiberius.\n\nBookThreeXLV Mentioned.\n\nMamurra, was a military officer who served under Julius Caesar, an equestrian who came from Formiae. His family must have been prominent there, as Horace calls it ‘the city of the Mamurrae’. He served as praefectus fabrum (prefect of engineers) under Caesar in Gaul, and a poem by Catullus also refers to his service in Britain as well as in Pontus and Hispania suggesting he also served during the civil war. Among the engineering feats achieved by Caesar’s army during this time, include the rapid construction of a bridge over the Rhine in 55BC, the designing and building of a new kind of ship for the second expedition to Britain in 54BC, and the double circumvallation of Alesia in 52BC. Catullus attacked his profligacy, womanising and scandalous lifestyle, accusing him of a homosexual relationship with Caesar.\n\nBookOneLXXIII Libelled by Catullus.\n\nMarcellus Minor, Gaius Claudius (88BC – May 40BC) was a friend to Cicero, and an early opponent of Julius Caesar. Caius Claudius Marcellus Maior was his cousin. In 54BC, his wife Octavia’s great-uncle Julius Caesar was said to be anxious for Octavia to divorce Marcellus and marry Pompey. However, Pompey declined the proposal and Marcellus continued to oppose Caesar, culminating in the crucial year of his consulship in 50BC when he tried to recall Julius Caesar from his ten-year governorship in Gaul two years early, without his army, in an attempt to save the Republic. Failing this, he called unsuccessfully upon Caesar to resign. He also obstructed Caesar from standing for a second consulship in absentia, insisting that he should return to Rome to stand, thereby forgoing the protection of his armies in Gaul. When Caesar finally invaded Italy in 49BC, Marcellus did not take up arms against him. Caesar subsequently pardoned him. The Roman general Publius Quinctilius Varus and his two sisters were grandchildren from his first marriage.\n\nBookOneXXVII Married to Octavia.\n\nBookOneXXIX His opposition to Caesar when consul in 50BC.\n\nMarcellus, Marcus Claudius was the brother of Gaius Claudius Marcellus Maior, consul in 49BC and the cousin of Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor, consul in 50BC. He married Octavia the Younger. He was elected curule aedile in 56BC, and in 52BC was elected consul, together with Servius Sulpicius Rufus, for the following year 51BC. During his consulship Marcellus proved a zealous partisan of Pompey and the optimates, and urged the senate to extreme measures against Julius Caesar, managing to procure a resolution of the senate, that the whole subject of abrogating Caesar’s Gallic command be discussed on the 1st of March the following year. After the battle of Pharsalus, Marcellus abandoned opposition to Caesar, and withdrew to Mytilene. His cousin Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor petioned the dictator for clemency on his behalf, and on it being granted he started out for Rome but was assassinated en route by one of his own attendants, Publius Magius Chilo.\n\nBookOneXXVIII BookOneXXIX His opposition to Caesar in the Senate.\n\nMarcellus, Marcus Claudius (42BC - 23BC) was the eldest son of Octavia Minor, sister of Augustus and, a former consul Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor. In 25BC, Marcellus married Augustus’ only daughter, Julia the Elder, with Agrippa officiating in Augustus’ absence. Augustus began to encourage Marcellus’ political career, grooming him for the succession, in 23BC gaining him the right to be a senator among the ex-praetors, to stand for the consulship ten years earlier than was customary, and his election as aedile that year. Marcellus became ill in the year of his aedileship, and died in Baiae.\n\nBookTwoXXIX BookTwoXLIII BookTwoXLV BookEightXIX Augustus built the Theatre of Marcellus, located in the modern district of Sant’Angelo, which was inaugurated in 12BC. Vespasian built and dedicated a new stage for the theatre.\n\nBookTwoLXIII His marriage to Julia.\n\nBookTwoLXVI Agrippa suspected Augustus of favouritism towards Marcellus.\n\nBookThreeVI He took part in Augustus’ triple-triumph of 29BC.\n\nMarcia Furnilla was a daughter of the Senator Quintus Marcius Barea Sura and Antonia Furnilla. Her sister was Marcia, the mother of Ulpia Marciana and of the Emperor Trajan. She married Titus, widowed from his first marriage, in 63AD. In 64AD, Furnilla bore him a daughter, Flavia Julia Titi or Julia Flavia. In 65AD after the failure of the Pisonian conspiracy, Furnilla’s family fell out of favour with Nero, and Titus and Furnilla divorced, Titus raising their daughter.\n\nBookEightXXIX The second wife of Titus.\n\nMarcius, Ancus, see Ancus\n\nMarcius Philippus, Lucius was a descendant of Roman King Ancus Marcius and the son of the consul and censor Lucius Marcius Philippus. He was a praetor in 60BC, and propraetor of Syria in 59BC. That same year he married Atia Balba Caesonia, niece of Julius Caesar. Philippus had a son and a daughter Marcia (later the wife of Cato the Younger) from a previous marriage which had ended with his wife’s death. Atia’s previous husband, Gaius Octavius, had died on his return to Rome, leaving her with two children: Octavia Minor and Gaius Octavius (the future Emperor Augustus). He was consul of 56BC with Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus. He appears to have been a cautious and moderate politican. Atia died during August/September 43BC and according to Ovid, Philippus later married one of Atia’s sisters. He lived to old age and Augustus rewarded him for his continued loyalty with spoils from foreign victories, with which he restored the temple ‘Hercules of the Muses’.\n\nBookTwoVIII Step-father to Augustus, he opposed Augustus’ return to Rome in 44BC, as too risky.\n\nBookTwoXXIX He restored the Temple of Hercules and the Muses in the Circus Flaminius in 29BC.\n\nMarius, Gaius, (157BC – January 13, 86BC) general and politician he was elected consul an unprecedented seven times (107BC, 104BC - 100BC, 86BC). He was also noted for his dramatic reforms of the Roman army.\n\nBookOneI He nominated Julius Caesar as priest of Jupiter (flamen Dialis).\n\nBookOneXI Julius Caesar restored the monuments to his defeats of Jugurtha (105BC) the Cimbri (101BC) and the Teutones (102BC) which Sulla had destroyed.\n\nBookThreeLIX Mentioned.\n\nMaroboduus (c. 30BC - 37AD), was king of the Marcomanni, and ruled a Germanic confederation in the area of Bohemia. In 17AD, war broke out between Arminius the Cheruscan leader and Maroboduus, and after an indecisive battle Maroboduus withdrew. In the next year Catualda, a nobleman, who had been exiled by Maroboduus, returned – perhaps with Roman connivance – and defeated Maroboduus who fled to Italy where Tiberius detained him for 18 years in Ravenna where Maroboduus died.\n\nBookThreeXXXVII Detained by Tiberius.\n\nMars, was the Roman god of war, the equivalent of the Greek Ares.\n\nBookTwoXVIII Augustus consecrated the site of his camp at Actium to the god.\n\nBookTwoXXIX BookFourXLIV BookFiveXXXIII The Temple of Mars Ultor, Mars the Avenger, in Augustus’ new Forum was eventually dedicated in 2BC, after a building program of forty years.\n\nBookFourXXIV Caligula dedicated three swords, supposedly to be used to kill him, to Mars Ultor.\n\nBookFiveIV Possibly the games of 12AD in honour of Mars Ultor.\n\nBookSevenXXXI It was considered unlucky to begin any enterprise during the period when the sacred shields were out of the temple.

The Marsi were a people of ancient Italy, whose chief centre was Marruvium, on the eastern shore of Lake Fucinus.\n\nBookFiveXX Their requests for the draining of the lake.\n\nMasgaba was a favourite of Augustus, who died on Capri. Probably, from the form of his name, he was Numidian.\n\nBookTwoXCVIII His tomb mentioned.\n\nMasintha was a Numidian prince defended by Caesar.\n\nBookOneLXXI Mentioned.\n\nMassilia, modern Marseilles, was of Greek foundation (600BC), and maintained its independence until the rise of Julius Caesar, when it joined the losing side (Pompey and the optimates) in the civil war, losing its independence in 49BC.\n\nBookOneXXXIV BookSixII The city was besieged (April to September 49BC) by Caesar’s forces. Again, as at Corfinium, Caesar’s forces encountered Lucius Domitius, who was again allowed to depart, this time to Thessaly.\n\nBookOneLXVIII After the siege had begun, Ahenobarbus arrived in Massilia to defend it against the Caesarian forces. In late June, Caesar's ships were victorious in the ensuing naval battle.\n\nBookTwoLXV Lucius Caesar died there in 2AD, on his way to Spain.\n\nBookFiveXVII Claudius landed there in 43AD on his way to Britain.\n\nMatius, Gaius belonged to Caesar’s faction, and helped Cicero in his relationship with Caesar in 49BC/48BC. After the murder of Caesar, he warned of potential for grave repercussions including possible rebellions in Gaul or among Caesar’s legions. When Octavian returned to Rome, Matius became one of his close associates. Matius and Octavian managed the July 44 games honoring the recently-assassinated dictator. An exchange of letters between Cicero and Matius later in 44BC has been preserved\n\nBookOneLII Supposedly knew of Caesarion’s paternity.\n\nBookEightLVII The same Matius may be the friend and assistant of Augustus, an eques who wrote three volumes on gastronomy. Columella credits him with pork mincemeat à la Matius, minutal Matianum, which includes Matian apples, and he was said by Pliny the Elder to have invented the clipping of shrubbery. Matian apples were said to come from the mountains north of Aquileia in north-eastern Italy, and to have been named for Matius.\n\nMauretania is on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa, and named after the Mauri tribe, from whom the term ‘Moors’ is derived. It corresponds to modern western Algeria, northern Morocco and Spanish North Africa. Claudius annexed Mauretania directly as a Roman province in 44AD.\n\nBookFourXXVI BookFourXXXV BookFourLV King Ptolemy of Mauretania mentioned.\n\nBookSixXXX Nero’s escort comprised cavalry of the Mazaces, a Mauretanian tribe.\n\nMaximus was a freedman of Parthenius’s involved in the assassination of Domitian in 96AD.\n\nBookEightLIII Mentioned.\n\nMaximus, Quintus Fabius, (d. 45BC) was Legate (general) to Julius Caesar in the campaigns in Gaul and in the Civil War, where Caesar chose him to be commander in chief of his advance guard in the conquest of Spain. After the Battle of Munda, Caesar awarded him a triumph and, together with Gaius Trebonius, the suffect consulship of that year on Caesar’s abdication of his sole consulship in September. He died on December 31, the last day of his consulship, and was replaced for the remaining hours of the year by Gaius Caninius Rebilus.\n\nBookOneLXXX Jeered at in the Theatre as not being a true consul.\n\nMediolanum, modern Milan, is a city in northern Italy, the capital of the Lombardy. Founded under the name of Medhlan by the Insubres, a Celtic people it was captured by the Romans in 222BC, became a permanent Latin colony in 89BC, and by 42BC Rome had exerted its hold over Cisalpine Gaul sufficiently to make the city part of its Italian territories. In his reorganisation of Italy in 15BC, Augustus made Milan the capital of the Transpadania region, including the towns of Como, Bergamo, Pavia and Lodi and extending as far west as Turin.\n\nBookTwoXX Augustus there 12BC - 10BC.\n\nMeleager was a Greek mythical hero venerated at Calydon in Aetolia. He was famous as the leader of the Calydonian boar hunt.\n\nBookThreeXLIV Mentioned.\n\nMemmius, Gaius, orator and poet, was tribune of the people (66BC), patron of Lucretius the poet and an acquaintance of Catullus. At first a strong supporter of Pompey, he went over to Caesar, whom he had previously attacked. In 54BC, as candidate for the consulship, he lost Caesar’s support by revealing a scandalous transaction in which he and his fellow candidate had been implicated. Being subsequently condemned for illegal practices at the election, he withdrew to Athens, and afterwards, to Mytilene. He died about the year 49BC. He is remembered chiefly because it was to him that Lucretius addressed the De rerum natura, perhaps with the idea of converting him to the doctrines of Epicurus.\n\nBookOneXXIII Demanded an official enquiry into Caesar’s conduct.\n\nBookOneXLIX On Caesar’s relationship with Nicomedes.\n\nBookOneLXXIII His reconciliation with Caesar who initially supported his bid for the consulship.\n\nMemmius Regulus, Publius was consul suffectus in 31AD. His magistracy saw the downfall of Sejanus, whom Regulus personally conducted to prison. Regulus was later prefect of Macedonia and Achaea when Caligula ordered him to send the Jupiter of Phidias from Olympia, to Rome. The emperor compelled him to divorce his wife, Lollia Paullina. She became Caligula’s third wife in 38AD, but he divorced her and sent her into exile after six months. Regulus died c. 63AD. He was probably the father of Gaius Memmius Regulus, consul in that year.\n\nBookFourXXV Caligula forced his divorce.\n\nMemphis was the capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom, its ruins lying 12 miles south of Cairo, on the west bank of the Nile. The ruins of the Temple of Apis there have not yet been located.\n\nBookEightXXX Titus attended the Apis bull’s consecration ceremony at Memphis.\n\nMenander (c. 342BC – 291BC), the Greek dramatist, is the best-known representative of Athenian New Comedy, and the author of more than a hundred comedies.\n\nBookEightXXIII Fragment 223 (Koch) gives an idea of metempsychosis parodied perhaps here by Vespasian.\n\nMenas, also known as Menodorus, was a freedman of Pompey the Great. When Pompey’s son, Sextus, appointed himself ruler of Sicily Menas became one of his leading admirals. He captured Sardinia in 40BC for Sextus, driving out Octavian’s governor Marcus Lurius. In 38BC he surrenderedSardinia to Octavian and received equestrian rank as a reward. He fought for Octavian under Calvisius Sabinus in the naval battle off Cumae.

A praetor in 81BC, and propraetor of the Roman province of Asia the following year, succeeding Murena. The capture of Mytilene occurred during his governorship; Mytilene had been in revolt against Rome and was suspected of actively or tacitly aiding so-called pirates in the region. Suetonius credits Thermus with the victory, but the siege may have been conducted by or in coordination with Lucius Licinius Lucullus.\n\nBookOneII Julius Caesar acts as his aide-de-camp, and he awards Julius a civic crown at the storming of Mytilene.\n\n, the Great, Mithradates VI (134BC - 63BC), also known as Eupator Dionysius, was king of Pontus and Armenia Minor in northern Anatolia (now part of Turkey) from about 119BC to 63BC.

Misenum was the largest base of the Roman navy, since its port (Portus Julius) was the base of the Classis Misenensis, the most important Roman fleet. It was first established as a naval base in 27BC by Marcus Agrippa, and was later adorned with luxury villas. Pliny the Elder was the praefect in charge of the naval fleet at Misenum in 79AD, at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius. Pliny left for a closer view and to attempt a possible rescue, and was killed by the eruption. The account of his death is given by his nephew Pliny the Younger, who was also resident in Misenum at the time.\n\nBookTwoXLIX Location of one of the two Mediterranean fleets.\n\nBookThreeLXXII BookThreeLXXV Tiberius died at or near there in 37AD at the ‘Villa of Lucullus’.\n\nBookThreeLXXIV A portent of Tiberius’ death there.\n\nBookFourXIII Caligula escorted Tiberius’s body to Rome from there.\n\nBookSixXXXI Nero’s project to connect Lake Avernus, Lago d’Averno, a lake located in the Avernus crater about 2.5 miles northwest of Pozzuoli, to Misenum.\n\nMnester was a celebrated comic actor in the reigns of Caligula and Claudius.\n\nBookFourXXXVI Caligula was rumoured to have had sexual intercourse with him.\n\nBookFourLV A favourite of Caligula.\n\nBookFourLVII Mnester ominously danced the tragedy Cinyras on the day of Caligula’s assassination, which had been played at the death of Philip of Macedon.\n\nMoesia was an ancient region, later a Roman province (c. 6AD), situated in the Balkans, along the south bank of the Danube.\n\nBookThreeXLI The Dacians and Sarmatians allowed to overrun Moesia c. 34AD.\n\nBookSevenXXXII Otho drew on troops from Moesia in 69AD.\n\nBookSevenL BookEightVI The legions in Moesia swore allegiance to Vespasian in 69AD, prompted by members of the Third legion.\n\nMucia, the third wife of Pompey, was the daughter of Quintus Mucius Scaevola, the pontifex maximus, consul in 95BC. Her mother was a Licinia who divorced her father to marry Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos, in a scandal mentioned by several sources. Mucia’s first husband was the short-lived and unlucky Gaius Marius the Younger. After his death at the hands of Sulla, the dictator needed to secure Pompey’s loyalty and arranged his marriage to Mucia c. 79BC. This marriage resulted in three children: Gnaeus Pompeius (Pompey the Younger), a daughter Pompeia Magna (married to Faustus Cornelius Sulla) and Sextus Pompey. She outlived all three children. On his return to Rome, in 61BC, Pompey divorced her. According to Cicero, the motive was adultery (it is said that she was one of Julius Caesar’s many affairs). Mucia then married Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, a stepson of Sulla. In 39BC, Mucia, at the request of the Roman people, went to Sicily to mediate between her son Sextus Pompey and Augustus. She was living at the time of the battle of Actium, 31BC and Augustus treated her with great respect.\n\nBookOneL Caesar was reputed to have had an affair with her.\n\nMummia Achaica was the mother of the Roman Emperor Galba and his elder brother Gaius.

He was Julius Caesar’s officer during the conquest of Gaul and the civil war. His funerary inscription attests that he founded the cities of Augusta Raurica (44BC) and Lyon (43BC) When Caesar was assassinated Plancus was Proconsul of Gallia Comata. But he turned to Mark Antony, and held the consulship with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus in 42BC. He became proconsul of Asia in about 40BC. During Mark Antony’s expedition to Armenia and Parthia, to avenge Crassus’ death, he was proconsul of Syria. But when Antony’s campaign against the Parthians failed, he chose to leave him and join Octavian. The Mausoleum of Plancus, a massive cylinder tomb now much restored is in Gaeta, on a hill overlooking the sea.\n\nBookTwoVI He suggested Octavian adopt the title Augustus.\n\nBookTwoXXIX He restored the the Temple of Saturn at the west end of the Forum at the foot of the Capitoline Hill between 43BC and 30BC.\n\nBookThreeV Tiberius born during his consulship.\n\nBookFiveXVI He was censor in 22BC.\n\nBookSixIV Mentioned.\n\nMunatius Plancus, Lucius (c. 45BC - after 14AD) was consul in 13AD and Legate in 14AD.

Pansa had been mortally wounded in an earlier battle where Antony’s forces were beaten off. Octavian’s forces now joined the remaining consul Hirtius. Antony was again defeated, but Hirtius himself was killed. Soon after the battle, a truce was formed between Antony and Octavian at Bolognaleading eventually to the Second Triumvirate of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Octavian and Mark Antony.\n\nBookTwoIX BookTwoX BookTwoXII BookTwoLXXVII BookTwoLXXXIV Augustus (Octavian) involved in civil war there.\n\nMylae, the modern Milazzo, is a town on the northern coast of Sicily 40 km from Messina, north of the road to Palermo. It is located on a peninsula, Capo di Milazzo. In 36BC a naval battle was fought offshore between the fleet of Octavian, commanded by Marcus Agrippa, and that of Sextus Pompey.

He also convinced the wives of Greek commanders to betray their husbands.\n\nBookSixXXXIX Nero sang his misfortunes.\n\nNemausus, modern Nîmes, in southern France, became a Roman colony sometime before 28BC. The name derived from a spring, possibly sacred to a local divinity Nemausus. Veterans of Caesar’s Nile legions, settled there. Augustus made the city the capital of Narbonne province, fortified the city, which had an estimated population of 60,000, and commissioned the Forum, and an aqueduct to the north. It crossed the River Gard between Uzes and Remoulins as the spectacular Pont du Gard.\n\nBookThreeXIII The citizens disapproved of Tiberius, (who had been Governor of their province of Gallica Comata) during his Rhodes ‘exile’.\n\nNemi, the nemus Aricinum, or ‘grove of Aricia’ was the site of the Roman cult and temple of Diana Nemorensis, a study of which served as the starting point for Sir James Frazer’s seminal work on the anthropology of religion, The Golden Bough. It lies in the Alban Hills overlooking Lake Nemi, a volcanic crater-lake, 4 miles north-west of Velletri and about 18 miles south-east of Rome. The ‘King of Nemi’, priest of the sacred grove, was by tradition a fugitive slave, who obtained his office by killing his predecessor.\n\nBookOneXLVI Caesar built a country mansion there which he subsequently had razed.\n\nBookFourXXXV Caligula had the priest deposed by a stronger challenger.\n\nNeoptolemus was a tragic actor who played Cinyras on the day Philip II of Macedon was assassinated.\n\nBookFourLVII Mnester ominously danced the tragedy Cinyras on the day of Caligula’s assassination, which had been played at the death of Philip of Macedon.\n\nNepos, see Cornelius\n\nNeptune, was the Roman god of the sea, equivalent to the Greek Poseidon.\n\nBookTwoXVIII Augustus consecrated the site of his camp at Actium to the god.\n\nBookFourLII Caligula liked to dress as him, carrying his emblem the trident.\n\nNero Julius Caesar Germanicus (c. 6AD – 30AD) was the son of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder.

Zenodorus created the statue between 64AD and 68AD. According to Pliny the Elder, it was 106.5 Roman Feet tall (30.3 metres). After Nero’s death, Vespasian added a sun-ray crown and renamed it Colossus Solis, after the Roman sun god Sol Invictus. Circa 128AD Hadrian ordered the statue moved from the Golden House to just northwest of the Colosseum in order to create space for the Temple of Venus and Roma.\n\nNero the Pretender: a claimant, or Pseudo-Nero, appeared in 68AD/69AD in Greece, pretending to be Nero re-born, and was hunted down by Galba’s troops (see Tacitus, Histories2.8/9), while a second claimant, Terentius Maximus, apparently appeared in the reign of Titus c. 80AD, sought Parthian aid, was exposed and executed (see Cassius Dio, Roman History, LXVI.19.3).

Nigidius sided with Pompey in the Civil Wars and subsequently died in exile without receiving a pardon. Among his contemporaries, Nigidius’s reputation for learning was second only to that of Varro. Even in his own time, his works were regarded as abstruse, containing esoteric Pythagoreanism, into which Nigidius incorporated Stoic elements. His vast works survive only in fragments preserved by other authors. By 63BC, Nigidius had been admitted to the Senate.
