Dr. West teaches on the works of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, as well as courses in Philosophy of Religion, African American Critical Thought, and a wide range of subjects - including but by no means limited to the classics, philosophy, politics, cultural theory, literature, and music. He has a passion for communicating to a vast variety of publics in order to keep alive the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. â€“ a legacy of telling the truth and bearing witness to love and justice.\n\nDr. West is a former professor of the practice of public philosophy at Harvard University and a professor of Emeritus at Princeton University. Cornel West graduated Magna Cum Laude from Harvard in three years and obtained his M.A. and Ph.D. in Philosophy at Princeton.\n\nHe has written 20 books and has edited 13. He is best known for his classics, \"Race Matters\" and \"Democracy Matters\", and for his memoir, \"Brother West: Living and Loving Out Loud.\" His most recent book, \"Black Prophetic Fire,\" offers an unflinching look at nineteenth and twentieth-century African American leaders and their visionary legacies.\n\nWithin the past year, Dr. West has partnered with MasterClass to provide teachings on several courses, such as his class with Pharrell Williams on Empathy, his multi-instructor class on Black History, Black Freedom & Black Love, and his standalone class on Philosophy."
