        "text": "\"Speaking Truth to Power: A discussion on Institutional Provincialism\" by Dr. Cornel West\n\nHosted by Mr. Ty Austin, SA+P, GSC DIS Chair\n\nPanelists:\n\nProfessor Jennifer Light, SA+P Professor\n\nRenee Gosline, Sloan Professor\n\nSasha Costanza-Chock, HASS Professor\n\nDuane Lee, 2017-18 MLK Visiting Scholar in Physics\n\nDr. Helen Lee, HASS Professor\n\nCeasar McDowell, DUSP\n\nDr. Cornel West is a prominent and provocative democratic intellectual. He is Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy at Harvard University and holds the title of Professor Emeritus at Princeton University. He has also taught at Union Theological Seminary, Yale, Harvard, and the University of Paris. Cornel West graduated Magna Cum Laude from Harvard in three years and obtained his M.A. and Ph.D. in Philosophy at Princeton.\n\nHe has written 20 books and has edited 13. He is best known for his classics, Race Matters and Democracy Matters, and for his memoir, Brother West: Living and Loving Out Loud. His most recent book, Black Prophetic Fire, offers an unflinching look at nineteenth and twentieth-century African American leaders and their visionary legacies.\n\nHow can universities be a force for social good in turbulent times? At an MIT talk...the prominent philosopher Cornel West had a clear answer: painful self-reflection.\n\nMore precisely, West suggested, the individuals who populate institutions of higher education should rigorously reexamine the consensus beliefs they encounter and, ideally, develop an “aversion to conformity” that will help bring vitality and diversity to academic life.\n\n“The unexamined life is not worth living,” West said, alluding to the ideas of Socrates. “The examined life is painful.”\n\nHigher education, West added, should be about not “information,” but “transformation” — a process of questioning assumptions and refining habits of critical thinking that can be applied to any issue.\n\nMIT News, 9 February 2018"
