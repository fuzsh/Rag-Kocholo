        "text": "(born 1953). African American philosopher, educator, writer, and political activist Cornel West was noted for his keen insights into the difficulty of growing up black in America. West was a social critic with strong religious ties who discussed the importance of class and economic issues in the black community, both as a professor and as a sought-after lecturer at rallies and churches. His influential book Race Matters (1993) lamented what he saw as the spiritual impoverishment of the African American underclass and critically examined the “crisis of black leadership” in the United States.\n\nWest was born on June 2, 1953, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. His father was a U.S. Air Force administrator, and his mother was a teacher and elementary school principal. The family moved often in his youth, and West was a rebellious youngster. When West discovered that his hero, Teddy Roosevelt, had studied at Harvard University, West decided that was the place he wanted to study as well. He graduated magna cum laude in 1973 from Harvard with a bachelor’s degree in Middle Eastern languages and literature. West received a master’s degree from Princeton University in 1975 and a Ph.D. in 1980. West taught religion at Princeton and led that university’s Afro-American Studies department beginning in 1988. He also taught at Yale University, Barnard, Williams, Haverford, and at the University of Paris. In 1998 West began teaching at Harvard. In 2001 the new Harvard University president, Lawrence Summers, reportedly admonished West in private for devoting too much time to political activity and other extracurricular pursuits. A public controversy ensued, and West eventually resigned his position at Harvard and returned to Princeton in 2002.\n\nWest’s best-known book, Race Matters, collected eight essays about black American crises. West blamed these crises on poverty as well as on the overwhelmingly negative attitude of African Americans. Of West’s many books, Race Matters was the first one aimed at a general audience. In some of the essays, West also identified sexism and homophobia as attitudes important for the African American community to combat.\n\nSome of West’s earlier books were Prophecy Deliverance! An Afro-American Revolutionary Christianity (1982), a work of philosophy considering the ideas of black writers, Christianity, and such traditional philosophers as René Descartes; Prophetic Fragments (1988), an essay covering many philosophical issues; The American Evasion of Philosophy (1989); The Ethical Dimensions of Marxist Thought (1991); Breaking Bread: Insurgent Black Intellectual Life (1991), which recorded a series of conversations with the renowned social critic bell hooks; and Prophetic Reflection: Notes on Race and Power in America (1993), which contained many of West’s speeches. His later works include Democracy Matters: Winning the Fight Against Imperialism (2004); (with David Ritz) Brother West: Living and Loving Out Loud: A Memoir (2009); and Black Prophetic Fire (with Christa Buschendorf; 2014), a discussion on six visionary African American activists. West edited The Radical King (2015), a collection of works by Martin Luther King, Jr. In addition, West recorded a hip-hop-like spoken-word album, Sketches of My Culture (2001), and a collection of spoken-word and music, Never Forget: A Journey of Revelations (2007). In 2003 he appeared as the character Councillor West in the popular movies The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions.\n\nWest was noted for his fiery speaking style, and he brought his appreciation of philosophy together with a fervor for contemporary issues to his students and listeners. His essays were published in a wide variety of magazines, including Spin, The Yale Law Journal, The Nation, and Christianity and Crisis."
