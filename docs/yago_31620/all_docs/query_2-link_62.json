        "text": "Cornel West believes that the economic problems many Americans face today is due to corporate greed. In order to achieve economic and worker justice Cornel West proposes, in part, a commission on Universal Basic Income, ending tax loopholes for the ultrawealthy, raising the federal minimum wage to $27 an hour, a four day work week, and six months paid parental leave.\n\nWell known for his stance on climate change, Cornel West promises to declare a climate emergency, nationalize the fossil fuel industry, end all oil and gas leases on federal lands, climate reparations, and cease all water privatization."
