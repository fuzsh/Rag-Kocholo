In addition to authoring the seminal classics <i>Race Matters</i> and <i>Democracy Matters</i>, Dr. West has served as professor of religion at Princeton University, professor of African American studies at Harvard University, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer Chair at Union Theological Seminary. Despite the difficulty of maintaining civility in the presence of uncompromising personalities, the character of Cornel West has remained steady and true throughout his decadeslong academic career.",
