I truly believe it is the most beautiful and vibrant region in the country, with a rich history and an even more promising future. I hope that the information I have compiled here on the Ninth District and the Puget Sound region will be helpful to you.\n\nWashington’s Ninth Congressional District is located in the central Puget Sound region and includes parts of King County. From the western shores of Lake Sammamish in Bellevue to the hidden treasure of Dumas Bay in Federal Way, the Ninth District’s diverse geography is a perfect representation of what makes Washington State such a great place to live and work. The Ninth is home to some of the most historic neighborhoods in Seattle, including Beacon Hill, Seward Park, Rainier Beach, Columbia City, the Central Area and the Chinatown-International District. On the eastern side of Lake Washington, the City of Bellevue is a center of high-tech innovation with a thriving downtown, while also maintaining a diverse group of neighborhoods and ample public park space. The picturesque cities of Mercer Island and Newcastle offer regional convenience and suburban amenities.\n\nThe central portion of the Ninth District contains many vital economic drivers. From its active aerospace industry to the fourth-largest warehouse and distribution center in the United States, cities such as Renton, Kent and Tukwila are critical to our state’s economy. SeaTac continues to be a gateway to the Puget Sound region with Sea-Tac International Airport serving as a hub for both passenger and cargo traffic. The communities of Des Moines and Federal Way contain some of the most scenic views of the Puget Sound coastline and are popular places to call home.\n\nThe Ninth District’s demographic makeup is as rich in its diversity as any in the nation. As recent decades have passed, the Puget Sound area has become increasingly diverse, reflecting statewide and nationwide trends. There is no better demonstration of this than the Ninth’s own SeaTac, Tukwila, Rainier Valley, and Skyway. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, these areas have the distinction of being some of the most diverse zip codes in the United States. With no racial majority, Washington’s Ninth District offers a fantastic amount of viewpoints with influences from around the world.\n\nState Links\n\nCounty and City Links\n\nState Government Sites\n\nCensus Bureau Information\n\nMy Congressional District\n\nAppropriations"
