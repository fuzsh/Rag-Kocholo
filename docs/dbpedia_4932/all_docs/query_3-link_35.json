        "text": "What Is the Invisible Hand?\n\nThe invisible hand is a metaphor for the unseen forces that move the free market economy. Through individual self-interest and freedom of production and consumption, the best interests of society, as a whole, are fulfilled. The constant interplay of individual pressures on market supply and demand causes the natural movement of prices and the flow of trade.\n\nThe term \"invisible hand\" first appeared in Adam Smith's famous work \"The Wealth of Nations\" to describe how free markets can motivate individuals, acting in their own self-interest, to produce what is societally necessary.\n\nHow the Invisible Hand Works\n\nThe invisible hand metaphor distills two critical ideas. First, voluntary trades in a free market produce unintentional and widespread benefits. Second, these benefits are greater than those of a regulated, planned economy.\n\nEach free exchange signals which goods and services are valuable and how difficult they are to bring to market. These signals, captured in the price system, spontaneously direct competing consumers, producers, distributors, and intermediaries—each pursuing their plans—to fulfill the needs and desires of others.\n\nThe invisible hand is part of the laissez-faire policy concerning the market. Laissez-faire translates to \"let do/let go\" and this approach holds that the market will find equilibrium without government or other interventions forcing it into unnatural patterns.\n\nScottish Enlightenment thinker Adam Smith introduced the concept in several of his writings, such as the economic interpretation in his book \"An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\" (often shortened to just \"The Wealth of Nations\") published in 1776 and an earlier work, \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments,\" published in 1759. The invisible hand concept was in use during the 1900s.\n\nThe Invisible Hand and Market Economies\n\nBusiness productivity and profitability are improved when profits and losses accurately reflect what investors and consumers want. This concept is well-demonstrated through a famous example in Richard Cantillon’s \"An Essay on Economic Theory (1755),\" the book from which Smith developed his invisible hand concept.\n\nSmith's \"The Wealth of Nations\" was published during the first Industrial Revolution and the same year as the American Declaration of Independence. His invisible hand became one of the primary justifications for an economic system of free-market capitalism.\n\nAs a result, the business climate of the U.S. developed with a general understanding that voluntary private markets are more productive than government-run economies. Even government rules sometimes try to incorporate the invisible hand.\n\nFormer Fed Chair Ben Bernanke explained the \"market-based approach is regulation by the invisible hand\" which \"aims to align the incentives of market participants with the objectives of the regulator.\"\n\nExamples of the Invisible Hand\n\nConsider an example of a small business facing stiff competition. To best position itself in the market, the small business decides it will invest in higher quality materials for its manufacturing process as well as reduce its prices.\n\nThough the small business may be taking these steps out of self interest—in this instance, to drive sales and capture market share—the invisible hand is at work because the market will have access to more affordable yet higher quality goods.\n\nAnother example of the invisible hand is the ripple effect that a retail company can have when attempting to meet consumer demand. Consider a hardware store that anticipates demand for yard maintenance tools. The hardware store will coordinate with a manufacturer to secure the appropriate goods. Meanwhile, the manufacturer will communicate with a raw materials distributor to ensure it has the items it needs to meet the hardware store's demands.\n\nEach entity is acting in its own self interest. However, each is also creating economic activity for other parties. In addition, the entities are stringing together a process that results in consumers receiving a product that they need. Though each individual action taken by itself may not amount to much, the invisible hand helps move resources along a process to deliver a final product.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe invisible hand represents the idea that specialization in production can lead self-interested individuals to produce what is socially necessary and for the good of all. This is because increased specialization naturally leads to a web of mutual interdependencies. For example, a shoemaker needs others to produce their house, while a homebuilder relies on a shoemaker for shoes. On a larger scale, market forces and competition motivate producers to make what is most profitable at the lowest cost, encouraging technological progress and innovation, for the benefit of all."
