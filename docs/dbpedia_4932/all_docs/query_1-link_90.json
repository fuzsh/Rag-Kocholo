        "text": "Advocacy News – Aug. 7, 2024\n\nWhat’s new: This week, Michiganders on both sides of the aisle cast their vote for who they feel is best to represent their party in Michigan’s General Election. From the Great Lakes State Congressional Delegation to county races, ballot proposals, and all 110 state house seats — Michigan had a lot on the ballot to consider. But now, the primaries are complete, and the results are in.\n\nWhy it matters: This year in particular, the State House is expected to be a close race. Democrats upset Republicans in the 2020 election by taking both chambers of the legislature, but their majorities are extremely thin, being held by only two seats. Consequently, the House only plans a small number of session days, likely in September, before the election.\n\nNOTE: At the time of publication there are a few races still counting votes. This page will be updated as votes come in.\n\n*Indicates incumbent\n\nU.S. Senate:\n\nDemocratic: Elissa Slotkin\n\nRepublican: Mike Rogers\n\nU.S. House:\n\nDistrict 1:\n\nDemocratic: Callie
