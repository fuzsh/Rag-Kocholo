        "text": "Washington voters will narrow the field of candidates in dozens of races in the state’s primary election on Tuesday, Aug. 6.\n\nWashington is a vote-by-mail state, and ballots were sent to 4.83 million registered voters across 39 counties weeks ago. Results often take days to come in as the ballots arrive in election offices in counties throughout that week.\n\nUnder the state’s primary system, the top two vote-getters advance to the general election in November, regardless of party.\n\nJump to the race you want to see: Governor | U.S. Senate | U.S. House | WA Senate | WA House | Attorney General | Secretary of State | Auditor | Insurance Commissioner | Lands Commissioner | Lieutenant Governor | Superintendent of Education | WA Supreme Court | Treasurer | At-a-glance list\n\nKey races to watch in Washington\n\nGovernor’s race\n\nDemocrat Bob Ferguson, who has served as attorney general since 2013, and Republican former U.S. Rep. Dave Reichert are the two biggest names among the more than two dozen candidates running for governor. Reichert is also a former sheriff known for his work hunting down Gary Ridgway, the so-called Green River Killer.\n\nWeeks of intense sparring between the frontrunners has seen Ferguson frame Reichert as a two-faced candidate whose more moderate rhetoric during this campaign does not align with statements he’s made in private or actions he’s taken in Congress. Meanwhile, Reichert has painted Ferguson as a candidate who wouldn’t change anything about the state, while providing a continuation of \"one-party rule.\"\n\nThe race is considered competitive, but in a state that hasn’t had a Republican governor in nearly 40 years, any conservative candidate faces an uphill battle.\n\n3rd Congressional District race\n\nTwo years ago, Gluesenkamp Perez came out of nowhere to win a congressional seat against Kent, who had Trump's backing in a district that hadn’t been in Democratic hands for over a decade. She took over a seat held by a more moderate Republican who lost the primary in part because she voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nNow, armed once again with Trump’s endorsement, Kent is back to try to take the seat in the southwest corner of the state. But he is facing stiff competition as former King County Prosecutor Leslie Lewallen gains a groundswell of support from conservatives looking to move the seat back into more moderate Republican hands.\n\nGluesenkamp Perez, who was ranked by the Lugar Center and the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy as having one of the most bipartisan voting records in the U.S. House, has far outraised her competitors. She is expected to make it out of the primary and face one of the tightest general elections in the country.\n\n4th Congressional District race\n\nNewhouse’s bid for a sixth term meant going up against Trump-endorsed candidates Jerrod Sessler, a Navy veteran, and Tiffany Smiley, a former nurse who entered the race after losing to U.S. Sen. Patty Murray two years ago. Trump's backing for Sessler came months ago, while his endorsement of Smiley happened three days before the primary, marking a unique, though not unprecedented, dual endorsement by the former president.\n\nNewhouse’s opponents believe his vote to impeach Trump is a huge liability, but political experts caution it’s difficult to say whether the endorsements will sway voters who already stuck with Newhouse two years ago.\n\nNewhouse is endorsed by the NRA and the National Right to Life, and he has mostly steered clear of the subject of Trump. He’s instead focused on agriculture and border security in a state with millions of acres of pastures, orchards and cereal grain lands where immigrant labor is extremely important.\n\n8th Congressional District race\n\nImraan Siddiqi, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Washington, has made the war in Gaza a centerpiece of his platform and has gained some traction as he derides Schrier for her approach, which often aligns with President Joe Biden’s.\n\nThe district is a mix of wealthy Seattle exurbs populated by tech workers and central Washington farmland, and until 2019 had been held by the GOP. Siddiqi’s presence could make Schrier appear more moderate, something she has historically sought by way of Republican endorsements in the purple district.\n\nSchrier, a pediatrician, has stayed quiet about the war recently, instead showcasing the 14 bills she’s signed into law by Trump and Biden. Experts anticipate she will go head-to-head in November with the Republican in the race, Carmen Goers, a commercial banker running to tamp down inflation and cut back on crime.\n\nLive election results for Washington state\n\nElection Progress\n\nAP Race Calls\n\nGovernor\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nU.S. House - All races (use dropdown menu)\n\nAttorney General\n\nSecretary of State\n\nAuditor\n\nInsurance Commissioner\n\nLands Commissioner\n\nLieutenant Governor\n\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nSupreme Court\n\nTreasurer\n\nWA Senate - All races (use dropdown menu)\n\nWA House - All races (use dropdown menu)\n\nLive election results for Washington state\n\nGet election results for other races in the 2024 primary election in Washington.\n\nMORE FOX 13 SEATTLE NEWS\n\nPierce County deputies disrupt international cockfighting ring in Buckley, WA\n\nMan pleads not guilty in deadly shooting of Kent 13-year-old\n\nFired Seattle cop files $20M tort complaint against city\n\nDestructive fire in Graham possibly started from fireworks\n\nPioneer Fire now a quarter-mile from Stehekin, Level 3 Evacuations in place\n\nCARES programs help take strain off WA emergency departments\n\nWorkers at Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo prepare for strike"
