        "text": "I am the Edward Orsborn Professor of US Politics & Political History and the Director of the Rothermere American Institute. I was born in the Northeast of England and went to Durham Johnston Comprehensive School and then to Oxford, Sheffield, Harvard and Cambridge universities. I taught for sixteen years at UCL before taking up my current position at Oxford.\n\nMy specialism is the American Civil War, its causes and consequences, but more broadly I am interested in democratic politics in various settings.\n\nI regularly present documentaries on BBC Radio and write for various magazines and websites. (You can read some recent articles here.) I also a close interest in school history teaching, having previously worked on education policy for the Royal Historical Society, and having previously taught an undergraduate course in which students created and delivered a sequence of lessons to Key Stage 3 pupils.\n\nResearch Interests\n\nAmerican Civil War\n\nSlavery in the United States\n\nParties and Elections in US history\n\nMy principal area of research explores the relationship between ideas and political behaviour. My aim in recent books and articles has been to offer an analysis of political change grounded in how ‘ordinary’ people in the nineteenth century experienced and understood their world. My first book, No Party Now (Oxford University Press, 2006), analysed the tensions between wartime pressure for conformity and the practice of electoral politics. In 2017, the University of North Carolina Press published The Stormy Present: Conservatism and the Problem of Slavery in Northern Politics, 1846-1865, (2017). This book won the Jefferson Davis Prize, awarded by the American Civil War museum in Richmond for the best book on the Civil War era, and was a finalist for the Lincoln prize for the best book on Lincoln or the Civil War soldier, awarded by Gettysburg College and the Gilder Lehrman Institute for American History. It offers a new view of the northern path to war, focusing on the mass of northern voters who self-defined as ‘conservatives’ and whose shifting responses to the unfolding political crises shaped events more than is usually appreciated.\n\nAnother strand of my research focuses on the study of the image of the United States around the world. On this theme my most recent publication is an article about the ‘cult’ of Abraham Lincoln in interwar Britain, which appeared in the journal Twentieth Century British History. I am currently completing a book for OUP on the battle of Gettysburg in history and memory which, among other things, situates the meanings of that great battle in a transnational context. I also have academic interests in the history of theatre and in transatlantic liberalism and conservatism in the nineteenth century."
