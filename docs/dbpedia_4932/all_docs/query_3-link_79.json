        "meta_description": "Adam Ferguson (1723-1816) was a leading member of the Scottish Enlightenment. He is often considered to be more sceptical about commercial modernity than his friend Adam Smith. This paper examines Ferguson’s views on trade and empire with particular reference to the British North American Empire. By contrasting Ferguson’s analysis with that of Smith, it shows that, while Smith’s discussion sees an economic analysis drive his political recommendations, in the case of Adam Ferguson a political analysis predominates over economic concerns in his view on the dispute with the American colonists.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\n3In order to pursue this thought I want to draw a contrast between Adam Smith’s account of commerce and Britain’s conflict with the American colonies and Adam Ferguson’s very different view. My contention is that both Smith and Ferguson are interested in the political economy of empire, but when Smith considers this it is an economic analysis that drives his political judgments, whereas for Ferguson it is a political analysis that drives his judgment of the economics of the empire.\n\nWhere they Agree\n\nWhere they Differ\n\n8Adam Smith famously makes use of a four stage theory which divides societies according to the dominant means of economic activity: hunting, shepherding, agriculture, commerce. He uses the stage theory, not as a model of inevitable historical development, but rather as a way of showing how different economic forms impact on human political institutions. War is different in hunting and commercial societies, so is government and law. Economic circumstances shape the problems faced by such societies and so their politics can be explained by the pressing economic issues.\n\n12Politics is the dominant concern in Ferguson’s analysis. As he would have it:\n\n12 Ferguson, Principles 1, 252.\n\nThe success of commercial arts, divided into parts, requires a certain order to be preserved by those who practice them, and implies a certain security of the person and property, to which we give the name of civilisation, although this distinction, both in the nature of the thing, and derivation of the word, belongs rather to the effects of law and political establishment, on the forms of society, than to any state merely of lucrative possession and wealth.\n\n14Civilised nations are those who have begun to produce a system of abstract law and an impartial judicial mechanism. This process, of political refinement, is necessary to prevent the disorder and potential civil war caused by clan feuds and the natural human partiality to sub-national groupings. The Romans, to the extent that they developed an operative legal system, can be considered as civilised. The reason for this lies in his recognition that commerce and artistic achievement are the result of civilisation rather than constitutive of it. Civilisation is regular government – the Greeks and Romans began to develop this, but did not realise it to the level apparent in modern Europe.\n\n15Another way of understanding this distinction in approach between Ferguson and Smith is to look at their accounts of social change. Both Smith and Ferguson deploy unintended consequence, evolutionary theories to account for social change. In full flow Ferguson refers to this as:\n\n14 Ferguson, Essay, 174.\n\nThose establishments arose from successive improvements that were made, without any sense of their general effect; and they bring human affairs to a state of complication, which the greatest reach of capacity with which human nature was ever adorned, could not have projected; nor even when the whole is carried into execution, can it be comprehended in its full extent.\n\nSmith on Empire\n\nFerguson’s Scepticism about Empire\n\n30The result of the success of Rome’s spirit and institutions was that it became a powerful empire but this eventually led to a situation where the institutions that promoted growth were unable to manage the empire once it had been secured. For this reason Montesquieu, by whom Ferguson was deeply influenced, traces the start of Rome’s corruption to its first permanent campaigns outside Italy (more precisely the war with Antiochus). When imperial rule was in place the great period of expansive war was over and the experience of luxury, but more importantly the experience of peace, hastened Rome’s corruption and eventual fall.\n\nFerguson on America\n\nConclusion\n\n42Liberty exists when security is provided without the exercise of authority tripping over into tyranny: it is a creature of the institutions that make that possible. As such it is a product of human action not human design, a fragile, accidental achievement of a particular institutional setting: and that setting is the post 1688 British mixed monarchy. That the system is unique and fragile is taken for granted and the problem that arises is how to stabilise the constitution.\n\n43Adam Smith’s account of trade and empire focuses on the economic side of the political economy of empire. Adam Ferguson’s, on the other hand, focuses on the political side of the political economy of empire. Ferguson agrees with Smith on trade and in his criticism of mercantile interests opposed to free trade. His worry is not about the merchants, but about the impact on the fragile British constitution. It was the politics of empire and its impact on British politics that exercised him. The problem was not primarily one of luxury or commerce any more than it was one of a lack of republican participation. The problem, as he saw it, was that the rule of law had broken down within the empire and the only response to this was force or separation. When demagogues raise a mob against the necessary powers of government and the rule of law, there is a danger of national dissolution: something that Adam Ferguson was not willing to countenance."
