        "text": "As the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee (HASC), I have consistently worked to ensure that our veterans receive the benefits and treatment they deserve for their years of faithful service. These benefits are critical for veterans, retirees, and their dependents, as well as those who are considering a career in the military. It is Congress’ responsibility to provide access to quality benefits, assistance programs, and medical treatment upon separation from the Armed Forces.\n\nThe Ninth District is home to several airports, including Sea-Tac airport. Communities surrounding airports have come to experience an increased and disproportionate share of public health and environmental impacts stemming from increases in air traffic. Studies have demonstrated that communities near airports and airflight pathways are exposed to higher proportions of harmful pollution particles from aviation emissions. This can lead to increased risks of breast cancer, heart disease, asthma, and a variety of other lung and cardiovascular conditions.\n\nI firmly believe that America is home to the most talented and best educated workforce in the world. Throughout my career, I have consistently promoted policies that encourage companies to provide high quality jobs with good wages and benefits, fought to safeguard the right to organize, and supported investments in workforce training and education programs to ensure all individuals have access to high quality job training.\n\nPromoting High Quality Jobs\n\nThe rights and freedoms of citizens need to be protected. When the fundamental rights of life, liberty, and equal opportunity are unfairly denied to a person or a group of people, it is the role of the federal government to step in and fulfill the promise of America.\n\nRoadmap for Criminal Justice Reform\n\nA functioning justice system must work to protect the innocent, while simultaneously holding accountable and rehabilitating those who commit crimes. We must comprehensively overhaul a criminal justice system that, in its current form, is guided by outdated laws and perpetuates structural failures in society. Our judicial system sets up those who have offended and served their sentences to continued failure, even after they have served their time.\n\nThe United States must do a better job investing in education to ensure every child has the opportunity to succeed, regardless of where they grow up or what background they come from. From child care and early childhood education to K-12 public schools and the higher education system, we need to increase our investments and reorient our priorities to ensure equitable opportunities for all children.\n\nCombatting the existential threat of climate change is a top priority of mine in Congress. We are already seeing the harmful impacts and catastrophic consequences of climate change in communities here in Washington state. We need to urgently transition away from fossil fuels and decarbonize all aspects of our economy. While this may be a daunting challenge, it also presents an enormous opportunity for creating jobs and economic opportunity, safeguarding the environment, improving public health, and rectifying long-standing issues of environment justice.\n\nHealth Care Reform\n\nHistorically, our health care system has cost too much, didn’t cover enough people, and incentivized inefficiencies. With these concerns in mind, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as the ACA. The primary goal of the ACA was to increase access to affordable health care for the medically uninsured and underinsured.\n\nEvery night, millions of Americans go to sleep without shelter or a place to call home. Millions more are finding it harder to afford their monthly rents or to save to purchase a home. With state and local housing organizations operating at maximum capacity and emergency shelters already strained, it is imperative that Congress act on a long-term strategy for combatting housing unaffordability.\n\nImmigration is one of the great strengths of our nation. People from all over the world have come to our country because they see opportunity in America and a chance to build a better life for themselves and their families. The hard work and talent of immigrants have helped grow our economy and strengthen our communities. We cannot afford to wait any longer to reform our immigration system. We need comprehensive reform to fix our legal immigration process, better support documented and undocumented immigrants, and improve the asylum process.\n\nUnited States foreign policy needs to be built upon carefully balancing all our national security tools – defense, diplomacy, and development. While a measured military power is a component of this strategy, the tools of diplomacy and development must be more greatly valued and utilized. The U.S. has a long history of leading the world in providing foreign assistance to impoverished and developing countries, supporting poverty reduction, economic development, and social progress."
