        "text": "Trump suggests he's waiting to name VP pick until there's more clarity about Biden's future\n\nTrump suggested tonight in a Fox News interview that he is holding off on announcing his running mate until he \"finds out\" what will happen with Biden's candidacy.\n\n“You know, we wanted to see what they’re doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference,\" Trump said, referring to Democrats.\n\n“I don’t know, I’m not sure that it would. But there are those that say, 'Trump’s waiting until he finds out what’s going to happen with crooked Joe Biden,' and we’ll see what happens with Biden.\"\n\nBiden's dismal debate performance has slowed Trump's rush to reveal his pick to be his vice presidential running mate.\n\nIn the interview tonight on \"Hannity,\" Trump said that he wanted to announce his running mate during next week's Republican National Convention but that \"modern day technology\" might prevent that. He also floated making the announcement shortly before the convention starts.\n\nWhite House releases letter from Biden's physician about neurologist visits\n\nThe White House tonight released a letter by Biden’s personal physician, Kevin O’Connor, explaining multiple visits to the White House by a Parkinson's expert.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to reveal any information during today's briefing about the nature of the visits by neurologist Kevin Cannard, who was named in the letter.\n\nO’Connor confirmed that Cannard was the neurological specialist who has examined Biden for each of his annual physicals in office. He also confirmed, as Jean-Pierre said repeatedly said today, that Biden has not seen a neurologist outside his annual physicals. His last physical was in February, and O’Connor reiterated his assessment that he was not showing signs of any neurological disorder, including Parkinson’s, during that examination.\n\nThe letter also details Cannard’s background as a neurology specialist and notes that he has been the neurology consultant to the White House Medical Unit since 2012. Before the Covid pandemic, the letter said, Cannard held regular neurology clinics at the White House medical clinic for the thousands of active-duty military members assigned to support White House operations.\n\n“Seeing patients at the White House is something that Dr. Cannard has been doing for a dozen years,\" O'Connor wrote. \"Dr. Cannard was chosen for this responsibility not because he is a movement disorder specialist, but because he is a highly trained and highly regarded neurologist here at Walter Reed [National Military Medial Center] and across the Military Health System, with a very wide expertise which makes him flexible to see a variety of patients and problems.”\n\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus leaders say they stand with Biden and Harris\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nIn a statement tonight, the top two members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus voiced their support for the top of Democratic ticket.\n\n\"We stand with President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris,\" said Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-Calif., the chair, and Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., the deputy chair.\n\n\"President Biden and his Administration have worked closely with House Democrats to make historic investments to positively impact communities across the country, including Latinos, such as investments to combat climate change, lower healthcare costs, expand access to healthcare for our veterans, and create jobs with the Infrastructure bill,\" they said. \"Most recently, President Biden announced an executive action that was a top CHC priority, to protect the noncitizen spouses of U.S. citizens to keep families together.\"\n\nThe praise follows similar support from members of the Congressional Black Caucus as several senior House Democrats call for Biden to step aside in the presidential race.\n\nSeveral Democratic senators voice their support for Biden\n\n+3\n\n, , and\n\nA number of Democratic senators said today that they continue to back Biden, even as some of their colleagues in the chamber have expressed concerns about his candidacy.\n\nSen. Gary Peters of Michigan, chair of the campaign arm for Senate Democrats, told NBC News, \"I support him and I feel good about him in our Senate races.\"\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York told NBC News she also continues \"to have confidence in President Biden and his ability to beat Donald Trump this November.\"\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a close Biden ally and a national co-chair of his re-election campaign, said, “I’m confident that Joe Biden will be our next president.”\n\nReferring to Biden's letter this morning to congressional Democrats, Coons said he had clearly expressed \"that he intends to run and to win. He’s been showing that — he’s been showing energy and engagement.\"\n\nBiden speaks for about 20 minutes during meeting with CBC members\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nDuring a virtual meeting tonight, Biden spoke with members of the Congressional Black Caucus — a group that has fiercely defended him amid calls by some House Democrats to step aside in the 2024 race.\n\nRep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., a CBC member, said in a statement that Biden \"showed his unwavering dedication to our nation’s future and that he is in this fight.\"\n\n\"Today’s call reaffirmed my support for Biden and Harris. Undermining Biden only weakens our resolve to defeat Donald Trump in November,\" she added.\n\nBiden spoke for about 20 minutes in a conversation that was heavy on lifting up Black Americans and growing wealth, a Democratic aide said. Everyone on the call who spoke praised him, the aide said.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer eyes bill hitting back at the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling on Trump\n\nand\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nAccusing conservative Supreme Court justices of placing “a crown on Donald Trump’s head” that allows him to commit crimes with impunity, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said today that he’s considering a legislative response to last week’s court ruling.\n\n“We Democrats will not let the Supreme Court’s decision stand unaddressed. The Constitution makes plain that Congress has the authority to check the judiciary through appropriate legislation. I will work with my colleagues on legislation classifying Trump’s election subversion acts as unofficial acts not subject to immunity,” Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor.\n\nSchumer spoke as the Senate returned from recess, a week after the Supreme Court handed Trump a big win in a 6-3 ruling along ideological lines saying presidents have legal immunity from prosecution for “official acts” carried out on the job but not unofficial acts. The terms are subject to interpretation, and Schumer is seeking to define Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election results as being outside the scope of his presidential duties.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nBiden is “winning back a lot of trust” with his public appearances since his stumble on the debate stage, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said today.\n\n“He has four months — which is an eternity in today’s politics — to convince the American people that it is better to have a president that has an off night as opposed to a president who has an off personality,” Green told NBC News.\n\nMember of Senate Democratic leadership says Biden must consider his legacy\n\nand\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nSen. Patty Murray of Washington, a member of Democratic leadership and president pro tempore of the Senate, called on Biden to “demonstrate he can campaign strong enough to beat Donald Trump” in a new statement tonight.\n\nMurray stopped short of calling on Biden to drop out but said he “must seriously consider the best way to preserve his incredible legacy and secure it for the future.”\n\n“We need to see a much more forceful and energetic candidate on the campaign trail in the very near future in order for him to convince voters he is up to the job,” she added.\n\nRep. Adam Smith explains why he thinks Biden should bow out\n\nand\n\nRep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said in a TV interview and a statement that the Democratic Party needs a new nominee.\n\n“I think he should step aside. I think it’s become clear that he’s not the best person to carry the Democratic message,” Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said on CNN.\n\nSmith, who is one of nine House Democrats calling for Biden to drop his re-election bid, said Biden’s health issues distracted from his record, adding that a campaign strategy of telling lawmakers to be quiet and fall in line “simply isn’t working right now.”\n\n\"We’ve got a great record to run on. He’s not able to deliver it right now,\" Smith said.\n\n“Personally, I think Kamala Harris would be a much better, stronger candidate,” he added.\n\nNBC News reported yesterday that Smith told House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and others during a call that he believed Biden should step aside.\n\nBiden is slamming “elites” who have called for him step aside. He says he still has the support of voters. As he fights for his political future, Biden hopes the support of Black voters and union workers will propel him to another victory. NBC News’ Hallie Jackson reports.\n\nDNC plans to troll RNC with branded buses during convention\n\nand\n\nThe Democratic National Committee will roll out 57 buses that will be driven around Milwaukee during the Republican National Convention in the city next week.\n\nThe buses are set to feature slogans aimed at promoting Biden’s re-election campaign and casting Trump as a threat to Americans’ livelihoods.\n\n“Ahead of the Republican National Convention, Democrats are making sure that Wisconsinites and all Americans understand that if Trump wins, America loses,” DNC communications director Rosemary Boeglin said in a statement. “This year, the survival of our democracy is on the ballot, along with protections for fundamental freedoms, health care, affordable prescription drugs, and good-paying jobs.”\n\n“There’s just one candidate who will protect them: President Joe Biden,” she continued. “While Trump, a convicted felon, selfishly campaigns to benefit himself, President Biden is looking out for us. President Biden has Americans’ backs, and we’ll have his when we send him back to the Oval Office for four more years this November.”\n\nKari Lake ties Ruben Gallego to Biden in ad highlighting debate\n\nReporting from Bismarck, North Dakota\n\nArizona GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake released a digital ad today that highlighted Biden's debate performance and linked her likely Democratic opponent, Rep. Ruben Gallego, to the president.\n\nThe ad starts out with Vice President Kamala Harris saying, “I hope you were able to tune into Joe’s debate,” before it cuts to Biden struggling on the debate stage in Atlanta.\n\nThe 30-second digital spot also features a mash-up of political commentators saying \"that was painful” and “he is very old and was lost frequently.”\n\nA narrator then adds: “Joe Biden is 100% gone and Ruben Gallego votes with Biden 100% of the time. Sleepy Joe and radical Ruben. Arizonans deserve better than this train wreck.”\n\nA FiveThirtyEight analysis of Gallego’s voting record shows he was fully aligned with Biden during congressional votes in 2021 and 2022.\n\nLake and Gallego are running to fill the Senate seat being vacated by Kyrsten Sinema, an independent, in Arizona, a critical battleground state.\n\nBiden set as key speaker at NAACP convention in Las Vegas\n\nThe NAACP announced today that Biden will be the key speaker at its convention in Las Vegas next week.\n\n\"The rights of Black Americans are under rampant attack,\" Derrick Johnson, CEO and president of the NAACP, said in a statement.\n\n\"There is no better time than now for our presidential candidates to reassure our community that our voices are heard and our concerns are a priority.\"\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries says he still supports Biden\n\nand\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said tonight that he supports Biden's re-election bid.\n\n“I made clear publicly the day after the debate that I support President Joe Biden and the Democratic ticket. My position has not changed,” Jeffries told reporters on Capitol Hill.\n\nJeffries’ comments come a day after he convened a call with several House Democrats, some of whom said Biden should step aside.\n\nA day after the June 27 presidential debate, Jefffries told reporters: \"I support the ticket. I support the Senate Democratic majority. We’re going to do everything possible to take back the House in November.\"\n\nHe later acknowledged Biden's dismal performance, calling it \"a setback.\"\n\n\"But of course, I believe a setback is nothing more than a setup for a comeback,” he said in an MSNBC interview in late June.\n\nWhat the polls show 11 days after the Biden-Trump debate\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nBiden was trailing Trump — albeit within the margin of error — in many national and battleground polls before Biden’s debate debacle.\n\nNow Biden is trailing by 1 to 2 points more in some surveys, but the movement is still within the margin of error, and few of the results reflect a radically altered race — though in our polarized and tightly divided politics, the campaign could very well hinge on such margins.\n\nThat’s the polling takeaway 11 days after Biden’s disastrous debate performance, as a handful of Democrats have called for him to exit the race and a defiant Biden insists he’s remaining in the campaign. “I’m not going anywhere,” he said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Biden: 'I support him'\n\nand\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said that she spoke with Biden over the weekend and that she supports his continuing his re-election bid.\n\n\"He made clear then, and he has made clear since, that he is in this race,\" Ocasio-Cortez told NBC News.\n\n\"The matter is closed. Joe Biden is our nominee. He is not leaving this race. He is in this race, and I support him. Now what I think is critically important right now, is that we focus on what it takes to win in November.\"\n\nBiden campaign launches ad hammering Trump on abortion rights\n\nThe Biden campaign launched an ad today that zeroes in on the overturning of Roe v. Wade during Trump’s presidency.\n\nThe ad, titled “Her Own,” alludes to Trump’s appointment of three conservative justices to the Supreme Court, which later overturned the landmark ruling that guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nThe spot features a sound bite of Trump on the debate stage last month touting his appointments to the high court who “happened to vote in favor of killing” Roe, which he described as a “great thing.”\n\nA narrator then says: “Ask yourself, who do you want in the White House: the man proud to overturn Roe v. Wade, or the president fighting for your rights?”\n\nNew Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich: Biden needs to show debate was 'just a bad night'\n\nSen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., said today that Biden needs to keep showing that his poor debate performance \"was just a bad night\" and that he can clearly defeat Trump in November.\n\n“I love Joe Biden. He’s the most accomplished President of my lifetime and he’s a genuinely wonderful human being. However, what I care most about is the preservation of our democracy,\" Heinrich, who is up for re-election in November, said in a statement.\n\n\"President Biden needs to continue to demonstrate that his debate performance was just a bad night, and that he has a clear path to defeating Donald Trump. Our democracy hangs in the balance.\"\n\nClosing arguments began this afternoon in the federal corruption trial of Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., after nearly two months of testimony. Closing arguments could last through most of tomorrow. If convicted, Menendez could face decades in prison. NBC News correspondent Rehema Ellis reports.\n\nHouse and Senate races draw renewed focus for Democrats after Biden’s bad debate\n\n+3\n\n, , and\n\nBiden’s shaky debate performance has turned more attention in the Democratic Party to races further down the ballot, with donors, candidates and strategists looking for ways to shore up a congressional firewall against the chance of another Trump presidency.\n\nOne major liberal fundraising group said it has seen a big uptick in donor interest in its down-ballot efforts. Battleground candidates are largely keeping their heads down amid intraparty handwringing about whether Biden should stay in the race. And Democratic strategists involved in House and Senate races note that their candidates have long been running far ahead of Biden in public and private polling as he has struggled to consolidate the party’s base, including Black voters and young voters.\n\nThe big concern now is that those voters, unenthusiastic about their choices at the top of the ticket and perhaps newly concerned about Biden after the debate, decide not to show up in November, depriving other Democrats of their votes.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nBlack lawmakers are a key line of support for Biden as he fights to save his campaign\n\n+3\n\n, , and\n\nBlack voters have been key to Biden’s coalition. In the 2020 Democratic primaries, Black voters in South Carolina resuscitated his campaign and put him on the path to the presidency.\n\nIn addition to choosing the first Black female vice president, he also nominated the first Black woman to be a Supreme Court justice. And now, keeping the support of Black lawmakers may be key to the president’s political future once again.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nTrump pushes new GOP platform softening party’s positions on abortion, same-sex marriage\n\nand\n\nAt the urging of Trump and his allies, the national Republican Party is set to abandon a decadeslong push for a federal abortion ban and soften the stance on same-sex marriage in its platform, according to changes made in its draft policy platform that passed this morning ahead of next week’s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nThe GOP’s new draft party platform, which still must get approval from the full Republican National Committee, came after significant effort from Trump’s campaign, which made a quiet push to keep people seen as too socially conservative off the platform committee, concerned that they would make a vocal push for things like a federal abortion ban, which has consistently been unpopular in public polling.\n\n“The reality of the situation is this platform reflects modern-day realities,” said a platform committee member who spoke anonymously to detail private deliberations. “This is a position that leaves it up to the states, which is the position of the Republican Party.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown: Voters 'have legitimate questions' about Biden\n\nReporting from Cleveland\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown, a vulnerable Democrat locked in a tough race in Ohio, said today that he has talked to people in his state with \"legitimate questions about whether the president should continue his campaign.\"\n\nThe remarks came during an event in Youngstown and were confirmed to NBC News by Brown's campaign. The senator, who is seeking a fourth term, has avoided directly saying whether Biden should drop out of the race.\n\n\"I’m not going to judge people in my party, what they’re saying or what Republicans are saying. I’m not a pundit,\" Brown said today. \"I’ve talked to people across Ohio. They have legitimate questions about whether the president should continue his campaign, and I’ll keep listening to people.\"\n\nBrown faces Republican businessman Bernie Moreno in the fall in a race that is key to Democrats' hopes of maintaining their majority in the Senate. Trump twice won Ohio by an 8-point margin.\n\nSchumer says 'I'm for Joe'\n\nand\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters this afternoon that he still backs Biden.\n\n“As I’ve said before, I’m for Joe,\" the New York Democrat told reporters as he arrived to the Capitol this afternoon.\n\nBiden and Schumer spoke today on the phone, according to three sources familiar with the conversation. Schumer previously said he supported Biden and believed the president was fit to serve when asked by reporters about Biden's fitness to serve last week.\n\nBiden meeting with Congressional Black Caucus tonight\n\nand\n\nBiden will meet with the Congressional Black Caucus tonight, two sources familiar with the matter tell NBC News.\n\nIt’s unclear whether the meeting will be in person, virtual, by phone or a hybrid.\n\nCBC Chair Steven Horsford and other members of the influential group are rallying behind Biden and giving his embattled candidacy a lifeline, as some other Democrats call on him to drop out.\n\nWhite House official says NSC never withheld info from Biden late at night\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby was asked at the daily White House briefing today whether the NSC ever withheld information from the president late at night out of concern he might not be able to process it.\n\n\"No,\" Kirby said.\n\nThis comes after Biden reportedly suggested to Democratic governors last week that he might limit evening events after 8 p.m. so he can get more sleep.\n\nBiden tells donors he's 'not going anywhere'\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nBiden joined a video call with key campaign donors and fundraisers Monday afternoon, reiterating his commitment to stay in the race and insisting he is the best candidate to beat Trump, according to three people familiar with the discussion.\n\nThe president told donors he is “not going anywhere,” but some who participated told NBC News they wished his personal and direct message to this group of supporters had come a week ago instead of now.\n\nBiden did take several questions, the sources said, including one from a donor who asked what he plans to do to prepare for a future debate with Trump. He said he would strive to be more in “attack” mode than he was on the stage in Atlanta, two of the people said.\n\nHe stressed a need to “move forward,” one of the sources said, and suggested he didn’t want to discuss his poor debate performance anymore.\n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore kicked off the meeting and said he is firmly behind the president, citing Biden’s “true character.”\n\nBiden campaign co-chair Jennifer O’Malley Dillon spoke near the end of the discussion by offering a preview of the president’s upcoming engagements at the NATO summit in Washington and travel to Michigan and Texas.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker's super PAC calls out GOP on abortion with billboards in Milwaukee\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker's super PAC, Think Big America, is launching billboards across Milwaukee as Republicans arrive in the city ahead of the Republican National Convention next week.\n\nThe ads blame the GOP for restricting abortion, with one billboard telling onlookers, \"MAGA extremists are in town this week to nominate a president who wants a national abortion ban. Stop them. Vote.\"\n\nAnother blasts \"MAGA extremists\" for \"the end of reproductive rights as we know them.\"\n\nPritzker, a Democrat, has been a major supporter of Biden's re-election campaign and has boosted efforts to place abortion rights measures on the ballot in states across the country this year. He was also a major proponent of the Democratic National Committee's plan to host the party's convention in Chicago next month.\n\nMontana Sen. Jon Tester says Biden must 'prove' he's up for 4 more years\n\nMontana Sen. Jon Tester, who is facing a tough re-election fight in November, voiced concern about Biden's candidacy, telling NBC News in a statement that the president “has got to prove to the American people -- including me -- that he’s up to the job for another four years.”\n\nHe added, \"I'll continue to do what I’ve always done: Stand up to President Biden when he’s wrong and protect our Montana way of life.\"\n\nThe statement was his first comment on the issue since last month's debate.\n\nTester's race is critical for Senate Democrats, who are fighting to keep their razor-thin majority. Tester is set to face off against Republican Tim Sheehy in a general election race that polls show is close.\n\nWhite House says exams have shown no signs of Parkinson's in Biden\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nWhite House spokesman Andrew Bates says that Biden’s physical examinations have “found no sign of Parkinson’s, and he is not being treated for it.”\n\nThis came after NBC News confirmed reporting from the New York Post that said a Parkinson’s expert from Walter Reed visited the White House at least eight times in an eight-month period, according to public visitor logs. One of those included a January meeting with President Biden’s personal physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor. The nature of and reason for these meetings is unknown at this time.\n\n\"As each report has stated, that examination has found no sign of Parkinson’s, and he is not being treated for it,\" Bates said. \"We do not provide the dates on which the President is seen by the range of specialists who participate in his physical, nor their names. But there have been no neurologist visits besides the one for his physical per year, three in total.”\n\nThe White House also confirmed that Walter Reed specialists regularly visit the White House “to treat the thousands of military personnel who work on the grounds.”\n\nThe Parkinson’s expert is Dr. Kevin Cannard, a neurologist who has published at least one paper recently on Parkinson’s. NBC News has reached out to him for comment.\n\nTrump campaign releases Republican National Convention program and themes\n\nThe Trump campaign made its first official announcement about programming for the \"Make America Great Once Again\" Convention which takes place in Milwaukee next week.\n\nIn a campaign email sent out to supporters this morning, the Trump team laid out daily themes including \"Make America Wealthy Once Again\" and \"Make America Strong Once Again.\"\n\nWhich Democrats are calling on Biden to step aside? A running list\n\nand\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett, of Texas, on July 2 became the first congressional Democrat to call on the president to withdraw, but more have followed since then, including ranking members of House committees. Still, other lawmakers have defended the president, including members of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nRep. Gregory Meeks says Biden remains the 'best messenger' for the American people\n\nRep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., voiced his support for Biden, saying that the president remains the \"best messenger\" to deliver messages to the American people.\n\nDuring an interview on MSNBC’s “José Díaz-Balart Reports,” Meeks — the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee — said that Democrats are \"on the same page\" when it comes to ensuring that Trump can't be re-elected.\n\nMeeks expressed his dismay over reports that some of his Democratic colleagues suggested during a phone call convened by House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries that Biden should drop out.\n\n“I think that it was hugely a mistake, and I don’t like the fact that that meeting was leaked because what leader Jeffries is trying to do is bring us all together and listen to every Democrat in the House of Representatives so that we can get everybody’s opinion,” he said.\n\nMeeks said he believes Biden had “one horrible debate” performance and that the president will soon redeem himself in upcoming press conferences.\n\n“I’m told there’s going to be a number of press conferences that he will have,” he said. “He’ll meet the general media and he’ll be able to articulate whatever questions that are asked of him to show what he has done and what he will do in a next administration.”\n\nAlthough he hasn’t been in touch with Biden recently, Meeks noted that he accompanied the president during his visit to Normandy last month and said Biden delivered a “remarkable speech” commemorating the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion.\n\n“The president has led, continues to lead, and the leadership that he has provided has brought the world, the democratic world, closer together, to make us all safer together than we would be if we were doing this by ourselves,” he said.\n\nJill Biden says the president has 'made it clear he is all in'\n\nand\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden reaffirmed the president’s commitment to staying in the presidential race.\n\n“Joe has made it clear he is all in,” she said, drawing chants of “four more years” during a campaign rally in Wilmington, North Carolina.\n\n“That’s the decision he’s made. And just as he has always supported my career, I am all in, too,” she continued.\n\nRep. Torres says Democrats are weakening Biden if he remains the nominee\n\nRep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., said in a statement posted to his account on X, that the discussions within the Democratic Party are \"deeply self-destructive.\"\n\n\"Weakening a weakened nominee seems like a losing strategy for a presidential election,\" he said.\n\nHe added, \"The piling-on is not so much solving a problem as much as it is creating and compounding one.\"\n\nHouse Republicans postpone hearing with Manhattan DA\n\nNBC News has learned that House Republicans have postponed a hearing scheduled Friday with Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg and his senior adviser Matthew Colangelo, according to a source familiar.

I wouldn’t be running if I didn’t absolutely believe that I am the best candidate to beat Donald Trump in 2024.”\n\nThe president said he doesn't care what pundits and Democratic strategists who want him out of the race think, saying that they were wrong about his success in 2020 and wrong about Democrats' success in the 2022 midterm elections when analysts predicted a \"red wave.\"\n\nBiden vows to stay in the presidential race in new letter to congressional Democrats\n\nand\n\nIn a new letter to congressional Democrats, Biden emphatically vowed to stay in the race amid demands from some Democrats to step aside in the aftermath of his poor debate performance last month.\n\nBiden stressed that Democratic voters paved the way for him to be the presidential nominee for the party, arguing that it would be undemocratic to bow out of the race at this point.\n\n“I feel a deep obligation to the faith and the trust the voters of the Democratic Party have placed in me to run this year,” Biden wrote in the letter to congressional Democrats. “It was their decision to make. Not the press, not the pundits, not the big donors, not any selected group of individuals, no matter how well-intentioned.”\n\n“The voters — and the voters alone — decide the nominee of the Democratic Party,” he added. “How can we stand for democracy in our nation if we ignore our own party.”\n\nBiden hosts NATO summit with dual tasks: Unite the alliance behind Ukraine and his party behind his candidacy\n\nBiden heads into the NATO summit he’s hosting in Washington this week with two distinct challenges, neither of them easy.\n\nOn the international stage, he wants to make a case for preserving global alliances in an era when many populist and nationalist leaders are looking inward, his advisers say.\n\nBut the tougher task will be on the domestic front, where he’ll need to plow through three days of meetings, speeches and dinners — capped by a news conference Thursday — with the vigor and focus that were noticeably absent during his debate with former President Donald Trump.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nRep.

I won’t get into whether she’s been covered fairly by the press, but she is a valuable partner.
