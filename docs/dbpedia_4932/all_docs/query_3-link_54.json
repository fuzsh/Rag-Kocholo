Despite this, ‘capitalism’ is a dirty word for too many young people.\n\nIn order to change this, we want to demonstrate that only free markets and a free society can deliver the solutions to the challenges that young people face, through educational outreach and our new Fellowship Programme.\n\nWe want to build lasting relationships with the policy-makers of the future, and so will be offering twelve young writers the chance to join our Next Generation Fellowship Programme, giving them the opportunity to produce research on the issues that matter most to them.\n\nThe Next Generation\n\nCENTRE\n\nCELEBRATING\n\nHAYEK’S\n\n50TH\n\nNOBEL PRIZE\n\nANNIVERSARY\n\nThis year marks the 50th year anniversary of Friedrich Hayek's Nobel Prize.\n\nF.A. Hayek was Chair of our Academic Advisory Board and our co-founder Dr Eamonn Butler received the Hayek Lifetime Achievement Award in 2023.\n\nOur Chairman was the President of the Hayek Society at Oxford University, and our Director of Research was President of the Hayek Society at LSE (London School of Economics).\n\nMarking the occasion is therefore not just core to our beliefs, it is also very close to our hearts.\n\nWe strongly believe that Hayek's ideas are as relevant as ever and want the younger generation to have the chance to be inspired by them too.\n\nOur project aims to seize the momentum around this anniversary to build awareness about Hayek’s ideas with the new generation:\n\n✍︎ Bring ideas to life: Recording high-quality video material on key ideas (the spontaneous order, the use of information in society, the sensory order) in 2024 to post across our social media platforms (combined following of 125.1k).\n\n✍︎ Republishing two books: ‘Hayek on the Foundation of a Free Society.’ (by our co-founder Dr Eamonn Butler) and ‘Hayek: A Commemorative Album’\n\n✍︎ Hosting a seminar at the London School of Economics and a reception at the House of Lords.\n\n✍︎ Creation of Merchandise\n\nConsider donating to support the promotion of Hayeks ideas!\n\nUpcoming\n\nEvents\n\nVisit Us\n\nAdam Smith Institute\n\n23 Great Smith Street, London\n\nHours\n\nMonday–Friday\n\n10am–6pm\n\nContact\n\n02072224995 info@adamsmith.org\n\nMedia enquiries: 07584 778207 (Call, Text, WhatsApp 24 hour)"
