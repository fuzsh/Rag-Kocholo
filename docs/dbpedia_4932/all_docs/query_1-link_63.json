        "text": "Multiple House members and senators have called on President Joe Biden to end his bid for another term.\n\nHere’s a rundown of who they are and what they said, organized by when they said it.\n\nJuly 20\n\nRep. Mark Takano, D-Calif.\n\nWho he is: A former public school teacher now in his sixth term in the House, Takano is the ranking Democrat on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee.\n\nWhat he said: “In his 2022 State of the Union, President Biden called on Congress to work with him to pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposure in Iraq and Afghanistan finally received the benefits and the comprehensive healthcare they deserve,” Takano said in a statement. “After countless hours of work by too many people to name, we passed this once-in-a-generation expansion of veterans care. … No one has done more for our veterans and their families than President Biden. … President Biden’s greatest accomplishment remains saving democracy in 2020. He can and must do so again in 2024 — by passing the torch to Vice President Harris as the Democratic Party Presidential nominee.”\n\nJuly 19\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio\n\nWho he is: Along with Montana’s Sen. Jon Tester, Brown is one of the chamber’s most vulnerable Democratic members. A populist first elected to the Senate in 2006, Brown has managed to hold on despite the state’s Republican shift. He is the sole Democratic statewide office holder. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race a Toss-up.\n\nWhat he said: “Over the last few weeks, I’ve heard from Ohioans on important issues, such as how to continue to grow jobs in our state, give law enforcement the resources to crack down on fentanyl, protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts, and prevent the ongoing efforts to impose a national abortion ban,’’ Brown said in a statement first obtained by NBC News. “These are the issues Ohioans care about and it is my job to keep fighting for them. I agree with the many Ohioans who have reached out to me. At this critical time, our full attention must return to these important issues. I think the President should end his campaign.”\n\nRep. Gabe Vasquez, D-N.M.\n\nWho he is: A freshman who flipped a battleground seat, Vasquez is facing a rematch with the Republican he ousted, former Rep. Yvette Herrell. Inside Elections rates the race a Toss-up.\n\nWhat he said: “President Joe Biden is an honorable public servant who has dedicated his career to bettering the lives of all Americans,’’ Vasquez said in a statement. “However I believe too many of our fundamental freedoms and the well-being of our nation are at risk under a Trump presidency and President Biden should step aside to give Democrats the best opportunity to win this November.”\n\nRep. Morgan McGarvey, D-Ky.\n\nWho he is: McGarvey is a freshman and the only Democrat in the Kentucky delegation.\n\nWhat he said: “President Biden is an incredibly effective and empathetic leader,” McGarvey posted on social media. “That’s why there is no joy in the recognition he should not be our nominee in November.”\n\nRep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn.\n\nWho she is: McCollum is in her 12th term and is the top Democrat on the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.\n\nWhat she said: “To give Democrats a strong, viable path to winning the White House, I am calling upon President Biden to release his delegates and empower Vice-President Harris to step forward to become the Democratic nominee for President,” McCollum said in a statement. She also offered a pick for a potential Harris running mate. “If she becomes our Democratic nominee, Vice-President Harris will need a strong Midwestern running-mate and I encourage her and the Democratic delegates to consider a successful leader who has been a teacher, soldier, football coach, former-member of Congress, and a proven winner – Minnesota’s Governor Tim Walz.”\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.\n\nWho she is: Lofgren, who was first elected in 1994, is the ranking member on the Committee on Science, Space and Technology and served on the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. She is close to former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a fellow California Democrat.\n\nWhat she said: “As I am aware that you have been provided data indicating that you in all likelihood will lose the race for president, I will not go through it again,” Lofgren wrote in a letter to Biden. “Simply put, your candidacy is on a trajectory to lose the White House and potentially impact crucial House and Senate races down ballot. It is for these reasons that I urge you to step aside from our Party’s nomination to allow another Democratic candidate to compete against and beat Donald Trump in the November election.”\n\nRep. Greg Landsman, D-Ohio\n\nWho he is: First elected in 2022, Landsman flipped a Republican-held district centered on Cincinnati. He’s part of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s Frontline program, which provides extra resources to vulnerable incumbents. Inside Elections rates his race as Likely Democratic.\n\nWhat he said: “There is too much on the line, and we have to be able to make that case to the American people about the change we need and the country we all deserve. After weeks of consideration and hundreds of conversations with constituents, I have come to the conclusion that Joe Biden is no longer the best person to make that case. It is time for President Biden to step aside and allow us to nominate a new leader who can reliably and consistently make the case against Donald Trump and make the case for the future of America.”\n\nSen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M.\n\nWho he is: A second-term Democratic senator who is up for reelection this year. Republicans are hopeful the state will come onto the Senate battlefield.\n\nWhat he said: “While the decision to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden’s alone, I believe it is in the best interests of our country for him to step aside,” Heinrich said in a statement praising Biden as “one of the most accomplished presidents in modern history. “By passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation’s greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy.”\n\nReps. Jared Huffman, D-Calif.; Marc Veasey, D-Texas; Jesús “Chuy” García, D-Ill.; Mark Pocan, D-Wis.\n\nWho they are: A California Democrat first elected in 2012, Huffman held off on sending a letter urging the Democratic National Committee to delay a roll call vote on Biden’s nomination the week of July 15. Veasey is a member of the New Democrat Coalition leadership. García is a Chicago Democrat in his third term who signed on to a joint statement hours after the Congressional Hispanic Caucus’ political arm endorsed Biden. Pocan is a former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nWhat they said: “Mr. President, with great admiration for you personally, sincere respect for your decades of public service and patriotic leadership, and deep appreciation for everything we have accomplished together during your presidency, it is now time for you to pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders,” they said in a joint statement. “We must defeat Donald Trump to save our democracy, protect our alliances and the rules-based international order, and continue building on the strong foundation you have established over the past four years.”\n\nRep. Sean Casten, D-Ill.\n\nWho he is: Casten flipped a Republican-held seat in the 2018 midterm elections and has focused on climate issues in Congress. Inside Elections rates his race as Solid Democratic.\n\nWhat he said: “But politics, like life, isn’t fair. And as long as this election is instead litigated over which candidate is more likely to be held accountable for public gaffes and ‘senior moments,’ I believe that Biden is not only going to lose but is also uniquely incapable of shifting that conversation,” Casten wrote in an op-ed in the the Chicago Tribune. “It is with a heavy heart and much personal reflection that I am therefore calling on Biden to pass the torch to a new generation.”\n\nJuly 18\n\nSen. Jon Tester, D-Mont.\n\nWho he is: One of the most vulnerable senators on the ballot his year, Tester is running in a state Trump won by 16 percentage points in 2020.\n\nWhat he said: “Montanans have put their trust in me to do what is right and it is a responsibility I take seriously,” he said in a statement. “I have worked with President Biden when it has made Montana stronger, and I’ve never been afraid to stand up to him when he is wrong. And while I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term.”\n\nJuly 17\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif.\n\nWho he is: A prosecutor in Trump’s first impeachment trial, Schiff is running for California’s open Senate seat.\n\nWhat he said: “Our nation is at a crossroads,” he said in a statement provided to the Los Angeles Times. “A second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the president can defeat Donald Trump in November.”\n\nJuly 12\n\nRep. Mike Levin, D-Calif.\n\nWho he is: Levin, first elected in 2018, represents a battleground district in Southern California that Biden would have won by 11.3 percentage points in 2020.\n\nWhat he said: “President Biden has been an outstanding leader, not only of our nation, but of the entire free world. Making this statement is not easy,” Levin said. “I have deep respect for President Biden’s five plus decades of public service and incredible appreciation for the work we’ve done together these last three and a half years. But I believe the time has come for President Biden to pass the torch.”\n\nRep. Brittany Pettersen, D-Colo.\n\nWho she is: A freshman from Colorado who represents a district that Biden would have won by 14 percentage points in 2020, according to Inside Elections.\n\nWhat she said: “Joe Biden saved our country once, and I’m joining the growing number of people in my district and across the country to ask him to do it again,” she said. “Please pass the torch to one of our many capable Democratic leaders so we have the best chance to defeat Donald Trump, who is the greatest threat to the foundation of this country that we have ever faced.”\n\nJuly 11\n\nRep. Eric Sorensen, D-Ill.\n\nWho he is: A freshman from Illinois. Inside Elections rates his race as Lean Democratic. The National Republican Congressional Committee targeted Sorensen in a digital ad campaign accusing House Democrats of helping to cover up Biden’s health status.\n\nWhat he said: Sorensen said he hoped Biden would step aside after his Thursday night news conference. “It is more important than ever that our neighbors have a candidate for President who will communicate a positive vision for every person in this country,” he said. “Someone who can demonstrate the strength and wisdom needed to lead us through the worst storms. A leader who will stand up to the present threats against democracy.”\n\nRep. Scott Peters, D-Calif.\n\nWho he is: A member of the New Democrat Coalition, Peters represents a safe blue seat in San Diego.\n\nWhat he said: “The debate raised real concern among elected leaders, supporters and voters that the President will not be able to wage a winning campaign. And while the Biden campaign claims the post-debate national polls remain relatively unchanged, polling in the swing states has worsened alarmingly,” he said in a statement, according to local news outlets. “We must find a candidate from our deep bench of talent who can defeat Donald Trump. … I hope all Democrats will join me in putting the country first, preserving the progress of the past four years, and solidifying Joe Biden’s legacy as one of the great leaders of our time — by defeating Donald Trump.”\n\nRep. Jim Himes, D-Conn.\n\nWho he is: Top-ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, he would be in line to become chairman if Democrats take control in November.\n\nWhat he said: Himes called Biden “a remarkable leader of unparalleled public service, undeniable achievement, and unconditional patriotism” and touted his administration’s achievements. “It is because of those traits, and in consideration of that legacy, that I hope President Biden will step away from the presidential campaign,” he said in a statement.\n\nRep. Marie Gluesenkamp Pérez, D-Wash.\n\nWho she is: Gluesenkamp Pérez flipped a seat in 2022 and is one of five Democrats who represent a district Trump would have won in 2020. Her race is rated a Toss-up, and she was ranked the House’s most vulnerable Democrat in May by Roll Call.\n\nWhat she said: In addition to calling on Biden to drop his reelection bid, Gluesenkamp Pérez suggested that the president consider resigning before his term ends in January 2025. “Like most people I represent in Southwest Washington, I doubt the President’s judgment about his health, his fitness to do the job, and whether he is the one making important decisions about our country, rather than unelected advisors,” Gluesenkamp Pérez said in a statement, according to the Seattle Times. “Americans deserve to feel their president is fit enough to do the job. The crisis of confidence in the President’s leadership needs to come to an end. The President should do what he knows is right for the country and put the national interest first.”\n\nRep. Ed Case, D-Hawaii\n\nWho he is: Elected in 2018 after previously serving from 2003-07, Case represents a district Biden would have won by 29 percentage points in 2020, according to Inside Elections.\n\nWhat he said: “Difficult times and realities require difficult decisions,” he said in an emailed statement from his campaign obtained by Honolulu Civil Beat. “This is one of those times, realities and decisions. My guidepost is what is the best way forward for our country. I do not believe President Biden should continue his candidacy for reelection as president.”\n\nRep. Greg Stanton, D-Ariz.\n\nWho he is: A former Phoenix mayor first elected in 2018 who represents a district that Biden would have won by 11 points in 2020, according to Inside Elections.\n\nWhat he said: “The Democratic Party must have a nominee who can effectively make the case against Trump, and have the confidence of the American people to handle the rigors of the hardest job on the planet for the next four years,’’ he said. “For the sake of American democracy, and to continue to make progress on our shared priorities, I believe it is time for the President to step aside as our nominee.”\n\nRep. Brad Schneider, D-Ill.\n\nWho he is: A Democrat in his fifth term, Schneider represents a safe blue seat in Illinois. He’s a vice chair of the New Democrat Coalition, a group of center-left Democrats.\n\nWhat he said: “I love President Biden. I am forever grateful for his leadership and service to our nation. The time has come, however, for President Biden to heroically pass the torch to a new generation of leadership,” he said, according to an Axios report.\n\nRep. Hillary Scholten, D-Mich.\n\nWho she is: A freshman representing a western Michigan district that includes Grand Rapids, Scholten flipped a swing seat in 2022.\n\nWhat she said: “For the good of our democracy, I believe it is time for him to step aside from the presidential race and allow a new leader to step up,” she said in a statement. She added that she would vote for Biden if he chose to remain in the race.\n\nJuly 10\n\nSen. Peter Welch, D-Vt.\n\nWho he is: The first Democratic senator to call on Biden to exit the race, Welch won his seat in 2022 after serving eight terms in the House.\n\nWhat he said: “I understand why President Biden wants to run. He saved us from Donald Trump once and wants to do it again,” Welch wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. “But he needs to reassess whether he is the best candidate to do so. In my view, he is not. For the good of the country, I’m calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race.”\n\nRep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore.\n\nWho he is: Blumenauer is the dean of the Oregon House delegation and has been in Congress since 1996. Last year he announced he would not seek reelection. Biden would have won his district by 46 points, according to Inside Elections.\n\nWhat he said: “While this is a decision for the president and the first lady, I hope they will come to the conclusion that I and others have: President Biden should not be the Democratic presidential nominee,” Blumenauer said in a statement obtained by OPB. “It is a painful and difficult conclusion but there is no question in my mind that we will all be better served if the president steps aside as the Democratic nominee and manages a transition under his terms.”\n\nRep. Pat Ryan, D-N.Y.\n\nWho he is: Ryan won a special election in 2022, focusing his campaign on abortion rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Inside Elections rates his race for a full term as Lean Democratic.\n\nWhat he said: “For the good of our country, I am asking Joe Biden to step aside — to deliver on his promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders,” he said on the social media platform X after telling The New York Times that Biden should “deliver on the promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders.”\n\nJuly 9\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J.\n\nWho she is: Sherill in 2018 flipped a seat that has since been redrawn to be more favorable to Democrats, and she is preparing to run for governor in 2025.\n\nWhat she said: “Because I know President Biden cares deeply about the future of our country, I am asking that he declare that he won’t run for reelection and will help lead us through a process toward a new nominee,” she said in a statement.\n\nJuly 8\n\nRep. Adam Smith, D-Wash.\n\nWho he is: The ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, he’d be in line to chair the panel if Democrats take back the majority in November.\n\nWhat he said: “Well, look, I think he should step aside. I think it’s become clear that he’s not the best person to carry the Democratic message,” he said on CNN. “And here’s the thing, we have an incredibly strong message and record to run on.”\n\nJuly 6\n\nRep. Angie Craig, D-Minn.\n\nWho she is: Craig flipped a Minnesota swing seat in 2018 and was the first Democratic “Frontliner” — that’s the party’s program for incumbents who need reelection help — to call on Biden to exit the race. Inside Elections rates her race as Lean Democratic.\n\nWhat she said: “Given what I saw and heard from the President during last week’s debate in Atlanta, coupled with the lack of a forceful response from the President himself following that debate, I do not believe that the President can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump.”\n\nJuly 5\n\nRep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill.\n\nWho he is: A Democrat in his seventh term who represents a Chicago-area district.\n\nWhat he said: “I would say, Mr. President, your legacy is set. We owe you the greatest debt of gratitude. The only thing that you can do now to cement that for all time and prevent utter catastrophe is to step down and let someone else do this,” Quigley said he would tell Biden in an MSNBC interview.\n\nJuly 3\n\nRep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass.\n\nWho he is: First elected in 2014, Moulton briefly ran for president in 2020, but his campaign didn’t gain traction and he ran for reelection instead.\n\nWhat he said: “When your current strategy isn’t working, it’s rarely the right decision to double down,” Moulton posted on social media. “President Biden is not going to get any younger. … We should have all viable options on the table.”\n\nRep. Raúl M. Grijalva, D-Ariz.\n\nWho he is: In his 11th term, Grijalva is the ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee. He represents a district Biden would have won by 27 points, according to Inside Elections.\n\nWhat he said: “What he needs to do is shoulder the responsibility for keeping that seat — and part of that responsibility is to get out of this race,” Grijalva told The New York Times.\n\nJuly 2\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas\n\nWho he is: A senior member of the Texas delegation, he has held an Austin-based seat since he was first elected in 1994."
