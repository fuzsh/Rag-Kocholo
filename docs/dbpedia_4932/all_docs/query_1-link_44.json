        "text": "Last night - President Biden sat down with NBC’s Lester Holt, and answered a question on everyone’s mind: will the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump change the election?\n\nHis answer: \"I don't know. And you don't know either.\"\n\nHe’s right - we don’t know how last weekend’s attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump will change things.\n\nBut, at least for now, some corners are calling for unity and dialing back extreme rhetoric.\n\nAnd public calls for the incumbent president to pass the torch within the Democratic Party have quieted, as attention instead turns to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nThis is not the first act of political violence that has occurred in America in recent years. To name a few:\n\nTwo people died when supporters of President Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021, to disrupt the certification of the presidential election.\n\nIn 2017, a gunman opened fire as Republican members of congress held a baseball practice, injuring congressman Steve Scalise.\n\nAnd in 2011, another member of congress, Gabby Giffords, was shot in the head while meeting with constituents in Arizona. Six people at the event were killed.\n\nCongressman Adam Smith represents Washington’s 9th congressional district, which includes areas from Auburn to Bellevue and parts of Seattle. He’s also a close friend of Gabby Giffords.\n\nCongressman Smith sat down with Soundside to discuss the shooting, as well as continued calls for President Biden to step down as the Democratic nominee.\n\nGuest:"
