You will learn so...\n\nWhat have you found most beneficial about the specific degree program you completed at McMaster?\n\nWhat I found to be most beneficial about my degree is that the work you complete during your time at McMaster truly transfer over to the work you complete in your career. The dynamic is very much the same when working in a school project team vs. a work project team. Deadlines still need to be respected, teamwork is valued and ultimately everyone is here for the same reason. The life lessons you learn in your program will be utilized when you graduate university on a daily basis.\n\nIn your opinion, what is the value of a social science degree?\n\nWhat I found to be most beneficial about my Sociology and Anthropology degree is the understanding of how valuable community is to our society. As I continue my career in the Labour Market field, I notice a lot of my Stats courses and Cultural Anthropology courses really come in hand when dealing with community organizations and partnerships. The Social Sciences really prepare you for everyday work life balance.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a current Social Sciences student who is exploring?career options?\n\nTry to move towards the courses that you are interested in and that suite your personality. If you prefer to work alone, take courses that focus on individual work. If you like to work in group settings and presentation, investigate experiential learning courses. Always read the course outline that can be found on google before determining what class to pick. The courses you choose at Mac will help determine your career pathway. I would also recommend joining MSU committees and volunteer in the community. You will learn so much about yourself that way!\n\nResearch that is done with community has benefits that can be seen, felt, and lived. It is powerful and impactful not because of a paper, report, or presentation that comes out of it...\n\nResearch that is done with community has benefits that can be seen, felt, and lived. It is powerful and impactful not because of a paper, report, or presentation that comes out of it. Nor does it become “community-engaged” because someone put that title on it. It is transformational through the honest, trusting, and accountable, relationships that are forged, solidarities that are built, and allyship that is not about any one of us, but of us together.\n\nA Social Sciences degree provides students with excellent transferable skills including critical thinking and analysis, research and evaluation, oral and written communication, problem solving, teamwo\n\nWhat have you found most beneficial about the specific degree program you completed at McMaster?\n\nThe Social Psychology program allowed me to delve into both psychology and sociology to learn more about human behaviour, group dynamics, and complex issues in our society. With its multidisciplinary nature, I gained a strong understanding of working with diverse populations which was a great foundation for my current work supporting post-secondary students with their career development journeys.\n\nIn your opinion, what is the value of a Social Sciences degree?\n\nA Social Sciences degree provides students with excellent transferable skills including critical thinking and analysis, research and evaluation, oral and written communication, problem solving, teamwork, and leadership. Employers value students in the Social Sciences who have a strong ability to examine and analyze complex problems and find creative solutions, while considering a multitude of societal factors and focusing on equity, diversity, and inclusion.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a current Social Sciences student who is exploring?career options?\n\nBe open-minded and fully present in the career exploration process. Pursue a multitude of diverse opportunities so you can learn more about your interests, skills, and values and gain further insight into what’s right for you and what you want your future career to look like."
