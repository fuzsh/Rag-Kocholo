        "text": ", D-Wash., is calling on President Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race after his debate performance.\n\nSmith, who is a ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement it would be a \"mistake\" for Biden to continue his presidential campaign.\n\nHe should step aside now so that we can find a new candidate that will put us in the strongest possible position to beat Donald Trump in November,\" Rep. Smith added.\n\nPresident Biden Monday asking for them to unify behind his reelection effort amid mounting concerns over his mental fitness.\n\n\"Now that you have returned from the July 4th recess, I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,” Biden wrote in the letter.\n\nDespite calling for Biden to bow out of the race, Smith clarified that should Biden continue, he plans to stick by him.\n\nIf President Biden runs, I will back him one hundred percent and without reservation,\" Smith said.\n\nSmith's statement comes the week after a group of Democratic governors—including Washington Gov. Jay Inslee— .\n\nOn July 3,Biden met for more than an hour at the White House in person and virtually with more than 20 governors from his party. The governors told reporters afterward that the conversation was “candid” and said they expressed concerns about Biden's debate performance days earlier.\n\n“Let me say this as clearly as I possibly can as simply and straightforward as I can: I am running no one’s pushing me out,\" Biden said on a call with staffers from his reelection campaign. \"I’m not leaving. I’m in this race to the end and we’re going to win.”\n\nYou can read Smith's full statement below:\n\n\"President Biden should end his candidacy for a second term as President and release his delegates to the Democratic National Convention to enable the party to nominate a new candidate for President. This must happen as soon as possible to give the new ticket the maximum amount of time to make its case to the American people.\n\n\"Any candidate for the highest office in our nation has a strong burden to bear. That candidate must be able to clearly, articulately, and strongly make his or her case to the American people. It is clear that President Biden is no longer able to meet this burden.\n\n\"The President’s performance in the debate was alarming to watch and the American people have made it clear they no longer see him as a credible candidate to serve four more years as President. Since the debate the President has not seriously addressed these concerns.\n\n\"This is unacceptable. The stakes are simply too high. Donald Trump and MAGA extremism pose an existential threat to our nation, and we need to be in the strongest possible position to win in this election.\n\n\"If President Biden runs, I will back him one hundred percent and without reservation. Elections are, after all, a choice. The President would still be, by a wide margin, the best candidate in the current field. He has done an outstanding job as President and our country will always owe him an enormous debt of gratitude for the job he has done. But no candidate is owed another term in office based solely on past performance. Every new term must be earned with the clear understanding of what that candidate will be capable of doing in the term to come.\n\n\"If the President continues his campaign, it would be a mistake. He should step aside now so that we can find a new candidate that will put us in the strongest possible position to beat Donald Trump in November.\"\n\nSmith represents Washington's 9th congressional district, which encompasses parts of Seattle and Bellevue in the north to Auburn and Federal Way in the south.\n\nHe has held the seat since the 1996 election, when Smith beat Republican incumbent Randy Tate.\n\nThe 2024 Democratic National Convention will be held in Chicago from Aug. 19-22, 2024."
