        "text": "A German-born space official who developed the rocket that carried Americans to the moon has quietly left the United States and surrendered his citizenship rather than face Justice Department charges that he had brutalized slave laborers at a Nazi rocket factory during World War II.\n\nAnnouncing the action yesterday in a brief statement, the Justice Department said that the official, Arthur Rudolph, as director for production of V-2 rockets at an underground factory attached to the Dora-Nordhausen camp from 1943 to 1945, ''participated in the persecution of forced laborers, including concentration camp inmates, who were employed there under inhumane conditions.'' A third to one half of Dora's 60,000 prisoners died.\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which had awarded high awards to Mr. Rudolph for his work for the agency from 1962 from 1969, had no comment on the Justice Department announcement. (Page A13.)\n\nThe announcement on Mr. Rudolph, who was brought to the United States in 1945 with Wernher von Braun and more than a hundred other Nazi German technicians and scientists, was negotiated in advance with Mr. Rudolph.\n\nThe announcement did not mention his prominent role in the United States space and missile programs. Nor did it say where he had gone. Investigators said it was West Germany.\n\nOfficials said it was unlikely that Mr. Rudolph, who is 77 years old, would face prosecution in West Germany as the statute of limitations has expired. Mr. Rudolph was not carried on an Allied list of war criminals drawn up after the war. Other officials of the rocket factory were convicted of war crimes and jailed or executed.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
