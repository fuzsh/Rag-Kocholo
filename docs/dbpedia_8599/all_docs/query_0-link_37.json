Thank you!\n\nWilliam Ronald Babcock, BM ’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Music Theory\n\nStudio Teacher: Jerome Diamond\n\nMaster’s Degree and PhD from University of Rochester. Professor of Modern Languages and Music at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, BC.Retired in 1980.\n\nI taught piano privately and did consulting work in North Dakota from 1980 until 2006. I spend my free time reading mostly historical books about Germany and Austria in German.\n\nIn 1971, I married Antoinette (Fraase) Babcock, a graduate of ESM class of 1966. We have had a wonderful life, often performing piano 4-hand recitals. We have traveled extensively and we usually visit Salzburg, Austria at least once a year. Antoinette received an Artist’s Diploma from the Mozarteum, Salzburg, in 1970.\n\nReflection: Many hours have been spent talking about our lives at Eastman, our teachers and friends. We are forever grateful for the education we received there. We would love to see all of the new facilities that have been constructed. Unfortunately, a year ago, I had a very serious medical condition and was hospitalized for five months. I now live at home and would love to hear from classmates. I regret that I am unable to attend this reunion. We enjoy life in rural North Dakota – especially the cold winters. Antoinette works as a staff pianist at NDSU and I am her assistant resource. We hope that the reunion is enjoyed by all, and we are sorry not to be a part of the celebration.\n\nBill and Antoinette welcome contact from their classmates at:\n\nBox 1\n\n200 Pearl Street\n\nBuffalo, ND 58011\n\nJames V.

With the opening of the Kennedy Center, I became the solo clarinetist in the Kennedy Center Opera House orchestra. I have also played in numerous Broadway and TV Shows. In addition to my performing, I was a full-time progressor at a college in Maryland for thirty-three years.\n\nI am now retired from most professional music making and professorial activities. A lot of my time now is spent restoring classic automobiles. My wife Pat and I have three children and six grandchildren.\n\nReflection: I have been, and remain, ever-thankful for the wonderful training and education I received at the ESM. The professors were first-rate. In addition, I enjoyed knowing my schoolmates.\n\nRonald J.

She was Peter Salaff’s teaching assistant.\n\nCurrently, I am a violin instructor at Ithaca Talent Education Suzuki School in Ithaca, NY (1976-2010).\n\nGerald V. Carey, BM ’59, MM ’61\n\nMajor/Instrument: Flute Performance\n\nStudio Teacher: Joseph Mariano\n\nI retired from my position as principal flute of the Quad City Symphony in 2008 – a position I held since 1978.

I have also been a member of the Rochester Philharmonic, the Buffalo Philharmonic, the Rochester Civic Orchestra, the New Orleans Opera House Orchestra, the American School Woodwind Quintet (Fountainebleu, France with Nadia Boulanger), and have played with the St. Louis Symphony and the New Orleans Philharmonic.\n\nI retired from Western Illinois University (1966-1999) where I was Professor of Music in Flute and a founding member of the Camerata Woodwind Quintet – ensemble-in-residence at WIU.

Cowden, BM ’59, MM ’60, DMA ’66, PC ’61\n\nMajor/Instrument: Voice\n\nStudio Teacher: Julius Huehn\n\nA few highlights include a Fulbright Scholarship (along with my wife, Jacqueline Mailloux Cowden, BM ’56, MM ’60 – very rare for husband and wife); Bayreuth Musikfestspiel Scholarship; NEH Fellow; a number of faculty positions including Banff School for Fine Arts (Director of Opera); Eastman School; the J.J. Isaacson endowed chair in the School of Fine Arts at the University of Nebraska/Omaha; Graduate Fellow at the University of Nebraska; San Jose State University; Wayne State University; founding chair of the music program at the California State Summer School for the Arts.\n\nAs a performer I was a principal artist with the Boston Arts Festival and the Chautauqua Opera Association under Julius Rudel; principal artist with the Stadttheater Hildesheim, West Germany; principal artist with the Metropolitan Opera National Company.\n\nI have directed opera for, among others, the Chautauqua Opera Association, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and the Michigan Opera Theater; over 600 half-hour segments for ABC, NBC, and PBS television, Detroit, Michigan.\n\nAmong my publications are numerous articles, concert and book reviews, as well as seven books including Classical Singers of the Opera and Recital Stages (1994) and Popular Singers of the Twentieth Century (1999).\n\nReflection: Working with Eastman colleagues during the all too brief existence of the Metropolitan Opera National Company was exhilarating. And when I chaired the outstanding music program at San Jose State University, Eastman was again strongly represented on the vocal faculty by Charlene Chadwick Cullen and Jeanne Garson. One is tempted to say that “those were the days,” but young aspiring artists continue to flourish and amaze us, and we know that the Eastman School of Music will continue to play a vital role in the future of music in the United States and throughout the world. Our more recent involvement with Music@Menlo only serves to reinforce that belief. Personal reflections certainly must include Julius Huehn, who was a great teacher and friend (I compiled and edited his autobiography, which is available in the Sibley Library) and who, believe it or not, attempted to give voice lessons to the legendary Emory Remington. Many of us surmised that Emory didn’t make any vocal progress but that his trombone students improved! And Emory’s wife Laura with her “rings on every finger” was a beloved fixture seated at the organ for weekly services at the local synagogue where Jacqueline and I were both members of the vocal octet; anyone remember the famous snowstorm that cancelled services?\n\nWho can forget the unyielding Herman Genhardt, the demanding Elvira Wunderlich, or Dean Flora Burton – does anyone recall Ed White and crew shutting down East Avenue at 3:00 am or who ended up in Dean Burton’s office several hours after that? And finally, I cannot finish without deep and sincere thanks to Ruth Watanabe, who guided me through graduate school and who instilled in me an abiding love of music books, particularly rare books, which excites me to this day. Indeed, my current book endeavor is devoted to a travelogue of major/important music publications prior to 1800 and the famous collectors who contributed to major library holdings. Until recently, I was unaware that the Sibley Music Library could no longer collect such rarities. The rare book collection of one of the great music libraries of the world is stagnating and its founder(s) would be appalled – perhaps we as a class should organize a movement/fund/foundation to alleviate this unacceptable oversight!\n\nThe above photo is from our 50th Wedding Anniversary Celebration in November of 2009. All the best to fellow classmates.\n\nGerald Crawford, BM ’59\n\nMajor/Instrument: Voice\n\nStudio teacher: Julius Huehn\n\nI continued graduate studies at Eastman for two years after completing my BM degree in 1959. I moved to New York City in 1961 and sang with the New York City Opera for five seasons.\n\nI began my teaching career with a position at Southeastern Louisiana University in 1966 where I taught voice and was director of the opera program. I moved to Western Illinois University, Macomb, IL in 1974. I began teaching Voice and Italian diction at the Oberlin Conservatory, Oberlin, OH in 1979 retiring in 2009. I served as chair of the Division of Vocal Studies for more than twenty years and was a founder of two nationally recognized programs – Oberlin in Italy, and the Oberlin Vocal Academy for High School Students. There were many solo appearances with various Oberlin ensembles and yearly faculty recitals. I was awarded an NEH grant in 1994 for additional study of the life and times of Franz Schubert.\n\nI was a soloist for many regional orchestras and opera companies – a highlight was singing Copland’s Old American Songs with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Aaron Copland conducting, at Saratoga Springs, NY.\n\nI have held positions as choir director organist for churches in Ramsey, NJ, Hammond, La, Macomb, IL, and Bay Village, OH, retiring in May 2010. I married my high school sweetheart, Marianna Mitchell, in 1958. We have three adult children, Michael, Lisa, and Maria.\n\nJanet Mary Danielson, BM ’59, MM ’61\n\nMajor/Instrument: Piano\n\nStudio Teacher: Armand Basile\n\nI have lived in many places and held a variety of music and non-music positions. Favorites include:\n\n– New York City: 1964-67 – Married to a cello student attending the Juilliard School of Music\n\n– 1965-67 – Rehearsal pianist for pianist Grant Johannesen\n\n– School Music: Key West, FL, 1968-70; Honolulu, HI – The Kamehameha Schools, 1970-73\n\n– Santa Barbara, Claremont, Los Angeles (USC), CA, 1976-79 – Organ study\n\n– Piano player with big band (Bobby Layne Orchestra) 1983-85 – Lincoln, NE\n\n– Nebraska Arts Council Touring Program – piano recitals of music by women composers – 1986-87\n\nReflection: Four years at Eastman were a wonderful experience: Not the end, but the beginning of a lifetime of growing personally and musically with the help of dedicated professors and warm fellow-student friendships. I am truly blessed.\n\nKenneth C. Donmoyer, MM ’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Music Education/Organ\n\nStudio Teacher: Norm Peterson\n\nI have remained in Rochester ever since arriving to start Graduate work at ESM in 1957. Since Eastman, I:\n\n– Was Minister of Music at Central Presbyterian Church of Rochester, 1957-64\n\n– Taught general music class and junior high choir at Ben Franklin High School in Rochester, 1957-59\n\n– Was Part-time Music-Choral Director at RIT, 1961-63\n\n– Taught Vocal/Choral Music at Monroe High School, 1965-69\n\n– Have published two articles in “School Musician Magazine” and “Choral Director’s Music Association Magazine”\n\n– Taught elementary music in several Rochester schools, 1972-90\n\n– Traveled to many countries and islands: China, Hong Kong, 4 Hawaiian islands, Africa, Egypt, many European countries, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Aruba, Jamaica, Barbados, Acapulco, etc.\n\n– Collect antiques\n\n– Set up a music scholarship at Lebanon Valley College, PA – 2004\n\n– Compose vocal and choral music\n\nReflection: How hot the classrooms were during summer school. One of Dr. Larsen’s T/F tests: the answers were in 3/4 time: FTT, FTT, FTT, F!!!\n\nQuenten Doolittle, DMA ’67, (registered as student ’59-’60)\n\nMajor/Instrument: Violin\n\nStudio Teacher: Joseph Knitzer\n\nI left Eastman (and Rochester) September 1960 to accept a position at a new university in Calgary, Alberta, Canada which became the University of Calgary. I helped to establish a music department, teaching violin, theory, history and chamber music. I also developed an orchestra for the department.\n\nDuring the 60s, I began to compose music for my family string quartet and various combinations of students. I was awarded a Canada Council Arts Award to live in London, England (1967-68) to continue my expanding career as a composer and to study viola with Peter Schidlov, violist with the Amadeus Quartet. Viola became my principle instrument at this time when I became lead violist for the Calgary Philharmonic and gave several solo and chamber recitals.\n\nAnother sabbatical leave was spent in Toronto (1974-75) where I composed my first opera, which was performed in Toronto, and receive three subsequent productions in other Canadian centres. On my return to Calgary, I co-founded a society for the performance of 20th century music (New Works Calgary) which recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. I was awarded another award given by the Killam Foundation to compose a second opera which was work shopped at Banff, Alberta, and performed in Toronto 1986.\n\nOpera number 3 was commissioned by the Banff School of Arts (1988). It was performed there and toured several centres in the UK including performances at the South Bank (Purcell Hall) in London. A fourth opera was work-shopped in Toronto with a performance (1998).\n\nAfter retiring as Professor Emeritus I continued composing several music theatre pieces in collaboration with my wife, Joyce. My total list of works ultimately included chamber, orchestral, choral, solo vocal and instrumental pieces. My most recent work was for soprano, choir and chamber orchestra, dedicated to my daughter Amy, who was born in Rochester and was a victim of ALS. Highlights of my retirement were two concerts dedicated to my compositions and the dedication of a performance space at the University for my wife Joyce and myself.\n\nReflection: I visited the Eastman School during a trip east during the summer of 2008 for the first time since leaving Rochester. It brought together so many thoughts of bringing my young family to live there and experiencing the stress and pleasures of completing the degree. Seeing the photos of the staff at that time brought back a flood of memories. It was also revealing to me how much the school had evolved to maintain its excellence over the years.\n\nRobert A. Dowd, BM ’59\n\nMajor/Instrument: Public School Music Instrumental Supervisor/Violin\n\nStudio Teacher: Millard Taylor\n\nFollowing graduation, I taught elementary strings in the Kenmore School District, north of Buffalo — my hometown. In the fall of 1960, I began a graduate program at the University of Buffalo. While my graduate program was not finished, I returned to the Rochester area and taught an elementary string program in the Rush Henrietta School District until 1964, when I began teaching in the Rochester City School District.\n\nDuring this period, I played viola in a string quartet composed of other district string teachers. We had a terrific time playing together for elementary students and various meetings.\n\nIn 1967, I joined the Music Department of the Gates-Chili School District, where I worked with a very able faculty. It was during this period that I became involved in the inspired teaching of Dr. Shinichi Suzuki. I attended summer programs at Eastman and worked with string teachers from other school districts to develop his program. After retiring from Gates-Chili in 1992, I continued playing violin in the Roberts Wesleyan College Community orchestra and am now with the University of Rochester Symphony Orchestra. Having married in 1964, I have two sons and am living in the Town of Gates in the Rochester area.\n\nReflection: Looking back, I must say how grateful I am to have studied with Millard Taylor during my four years at Eastman. While I was not one of his top students, I received the finest, intense encouragement that I really needed. At each lesson I was greeted by his wonderful smile and professional example that made me feel very comfortable. I was also very much inspired by Francis Tursi during the 1959-1960 school year. I returned each month to receive his insightful help.\n\nHenry E. Fox, MM ’59\n\nMajor/Instrument: Music Education/Clarinet\n\nStudio Teacher: William Osseck\n\nI spent 37 years in public school music, conducted and played with numerous bands, orchestras, big bands, and ensembles.\n\nReflection: Snow from Thanksgiving to Easter.\n\nGaylord W. French, BM ’60, MM ’66\n\n1961-65 US Navy Band Sea Chanters – Singer; Organist\n\n1965-69 Director of Choral Activities, Midland, Michigan Music Foundation\n\n1969-70 Doctor of Music Program at Indiana University\n\n1971-75 Assistant Professor of Music – Centre College, Danville, KY – Voice, Chorus, Music History\n\n1976-2009 Director of Music and Organist at Central Presbyterian Church, Montclair, NJ\n\nCentral Church Choir performed major oratories twice a year and I gave recitals and organized a concert series. I also taught private voice, organ, and piano. At various times I was the conductor of the Newark Boys Chorus, voice teacher at the American Dramatic Academy, and taught at Seton Hall University and William Patterson College. I also accompanied the Montclair Oratorio Society and Essex Chorale.\n\nI have been married to Marlene Reed (UR Class of 1960) for 49 years and have two daughters and five grandchildren.\n\nHenry Fuchs, BM ’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Theory/Piano\n\nStudio Teacher: Orazio Frugoni\n\nLife after Eastman brought graduate study in piano performance at the University of Michigan (MM 1961) under the tutelage of pianist Robert Hord and composer/theorist/pianist Wallace Berry. Further graduate studies in performance practice followed at Stanford University with pianist Adolph Baller and at the University of Minnesota with Bernhard Weiser, as well as graduate study in Performing Arts Administration at New York University. Responsibilities in the Arts Administration program included service in the Programming and Press Department of Town Hall, and with a concert management firm in New York City now known as Schwalbe and Partners. The firm’s roster included pianists Richard Goode and Paul Jacobs, as well as leading exponents of the historically informed early music movement such as Trevor Pinnock, Nicholas McGegan, and Christopher Hogwood.\n\nMost of my professional life centered on piano performance and teaching piano and music theory at the University of Rhode Island (1968-2000). A highlight of my years in Kingston, Rhode Island involved serving from 1982-1998 as founding director of Great Performance, the University’s international celebrity concert series. The Series presented some of the finest performing ensembles and recitalists of our day. We welcomed the Oslo and Moscow Philharmonics, the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra of San Francisco, Borodin Quartet, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, Trio Fontenay, pianists Ivan Moravec, Elisabeth Leonskaya, and sopranos Arlen Auger and Emma Kirkby to our venue, among many others. America’s jazz heritage was well represented by artists such as Jon Hendricks, Cyrus Chestnut, and Marcus Roberts.\n\nRetirement from academic life in 2000 brought with it the opportunity to perform in recital with flutist Phil Swanson (ESM ’62) in Tucson, as well as undertaking several independent contractor projects in arts management. This past May I enjoyed performing the Mozart E-Flat Quintet and the Poulenc Sextet for Piano and Winds with the Foothills Chamber Ensemble of Tucson. My wife, Jo Ann, and I now reside in Bloomington, Indiana with frequent sojourns to our old stomping grounds in Tucson, Arizona.\n\nReflection: I have lost my fear of class reunions!\n\nMartha Danielson Gerstenkorn, BM ’59\n\nMajor/Instrument: Piano\n\nStudio Teacher: Armand Basile\n\nShortly after graduation, I married, and spent the next 25 years raising our three sons. During this time, I taught piano lessons at home. It was also during this time that I became a single parent and began graduate study in musicology at The University of Georgia in Athens. In 1975 I transferred to The University of Kansas, Lawrence, where I finished the Ph.D. in 1983.\n\nIn 1989 I graduated with an M.S. in Library and Information Science from The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign; my mentor there was Donald Krummel. Upon graduation I was hired by the Free Library of Philadelphia as a reference librarian in the Music Department at the Central Library. I retired in 1993.\n\nThe same year I remarried, and we now live in West Chester, PA. I am serving on the Advisory Board for the School of Music at West Chester University.\n\nReflection: I am grateful that my sister Janet Danielson was with me during my two years at Eastman. It was good to have her company, and we were able to continue the two-piano work that we had been doing for some time before we came to the school.\n\nMargot Keith Green, BM ’59\n\nMajor/Instrument: Voice\n\nStudio Teacher: Leonard Treash & Josephine Antoine\n\nI had always been torn between general academic studies and music. That is why I spent my first two years as a student on the River Campus before transferring to Eastman full time upon the urging of the vocal faculty. Soon after leaving Rochester, however, I determined that I was temperamentally unsuited for the rigors of pursuing a vocal or operatic career, and so I turned back to academia, studying Russian and eventually earning an M.A. in Linguistics and an Ed.D. in Adult Education with a second major in Research and Evaluation. Thereafter my career led to teaching at the college level, coordinating a statewide accountability program for the Indiana Department of Education, and eventually to Cummins Engine Company in Columbus, Indiana (now Cummins, Inc.), where I spent twenty years working as Director of Human Resources for the Corporate Staff Groups, Director of Corporate Communications, and eventually Assistant to the CEO and Chairman for my last and best five years.\n\nI learned a lot while working for Cummins, and I worked very hard putting in long hours seven days a week. In 2000, after the CEO retired, I qualified for early retirement and jumped at the opportunity to take it. That gave me plenty of time to spend with my beloved husband Hal, whom I met in the 1970s while doing my doctoral dissertation, and I enjoyed offering help and support when he wrote a mystery novel, Murder in the Well House, set at Indiana University, from which he earned three degrees.\n\nIn addition, I have been able to continue writing and have pursued new interests in history and genealogy, volunteering for the Bartholomew County (IN) Historical Society and serving as President of the Bartholomew County Genealogical Society. The hunt for ancestors gives me great pleasure although it seems as if it will never end. Every so often, my retired boss asks me to work with him on a speech, which helps keep my research and writing skills honed. All in all, I have never been happier. These are, indeed, the best years of my life.\n\nReflections: It scarcely seems possible that so much time has passed and that the girl who sat in the heat of the U. of R. stadium on graduation day is now a grandmother with three forty-something children (Jim and Carolyn Wolpert, Genelle Fountain) and two teenaged grandchildren (Keith Wolpert and Natalie Perrin). Although I am not a musician now, I recognize all that being at Eastman gave me exposure to memorable instructors, wonderfully talented fellow students, and outstanding guest artists. Eastman also broadened my musical horizons, enhanced my appreciation for the dedication, hard work, and perseverance that it takes to make music a career, and fostered disciplined habits that have stood me in good stead ever since. I still feel a bond with Eastman and heartily applaud the continuing success enjoyed by all those associated with it.\n\nNola Ilene Marberger Gustafson, BM ’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Piano\n\nStudio Teacher: Jose Echaniz\n\nAfter graduating from Eastman, I earned the M.M. in Piano at Indiana University studying with Menahem Pressler. I was an Instructor at the University of Vermont from 1962-1964, spending the summer of 1963 studying at the Aspen Music Festival with Beveridge Webster from Juilliard. In June, 1964, I married John Arthur Gustafson and moved to the Chicago area. Since that time I have performed solos, and done extensive collaborative recitals all over Northern Illinois. I teach private piano in my studio. I am active in Illinois State Music Teachers Association, Chicago Musicians Club of Women and Western Springs Music Club where I have chaired a Piano Festival for school-age musicians for more than 40 years.\n\nReflection: Music has brought much joy and satisfaction to me. I cannot imagine a life in any other field of study. Art and I have 3 grown children and 4 grandchildren that never cease to amaze us. We enjoy family, fly-fishing, traveling, and Lyric Opera and Chicago Symphony Concerts. the faculty, fellow students, and Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra Concerts are fond memories. I look forward to seeing my classmates at the 50th Reunion.\n\nLynnette Halvorson, Ph.D. ’59\n\nMajor/Instrument: Organ\n\nStudio Teachers: Harold Gleason, David Craighead\n\nSince Eastman, I have been on faculty at MacPhail College of Music, Minneapolis, MN (Piano, Organ, Theory) and on faculty at College of St. Benedict, St. Joseph, MN (Organ, Theory, Music History).\n\nReflection: The years at Eastman were wonderful: great music, great faculty, great friends!\n\nCharles Hardwick, BM ’59, MM ’61\n\nMajor/Instrument: Violin\n\nStudio Teacher: Joseph Knitzer\n\nUpon completing my MM degree in the spring of ‘61 I joined the first violin section of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra that September. After 35 years and three Music Directors (Steinberg, Previn & Maazel), I retired in ‘96, but continued to play for a further three years on a part- time contract. During those years I was an active chamber music player and spent the summers as a member of the Chautauqua Symphony with Walter Hendel conducting. I also enjoyed playing part-time in the Grand Teton Festival during the summers of 80- 82.\n\nFor the past ten years I’ve made custom batons for many conductors and since I’m no longer “fiddling,” this keeps me connected to the music world. My wife, Angela, and I attend as many concerts, theatre and opera performances as we are able, and we love to travel, especially to Europe.\n\nI consider myself blessed to have been associated with such a fine orchestra, which gave me the opportunity to travel the world and experience so many other cultures.\n\nReflection: Upon reflection, my six years at the ESM were very happy and memorable. The faculty was brilliant and always helpful. In my sophomore year it was the two-part invention in theory class that almost sent me packing for home, however Dr. Wunderlich cajoled, encouraged and inspired me to carry on and finish! I certainly hope today’s students are enjoying the Eastman experience as much as I did.\n\nMarjorie Winey Hartzell, BM ’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Harp\n\nStudio Teacher: Eileen Malone\n\nBuffalo Philharmonic Orchestra 1960-66\n\nBuffalo Symphonette\n\nNorwood Trio (flute, cello, harp) – The Norwood Trio was formed under the auspices of Young Audiences, Inc., to give programs in the public schools. The members were all members of the orchestra. One of the most popular pieces we played was Villa-Lobos’s Jet Whistle (Assobio a Jato) for flute and cello. There were no trolleys then so the flutist had to carry my harp!\n\nSiena, Accademia Musicale Chigiana – study with Nicanor Zabaleta – In 1961 a story appeared that Zabaleta was to teach in Siena to prepare the Italian harpists for the Israel Contest. There were places available for non-Italians, so I applied and was accepted. Zabaleta took everybody who came. It was very exciting to be there. Alfred Cortot taught piano, and Andres Segovia, guitar. All the students could attend classes outside their own specialty.\n\nFulbright Scholarship to London – study with Maria Korchinska 1966-67, 1975\n\nAlbany Symphony Orchestra 1967-1983\n\nLake George Opera Festival 1972-1983\n\nPrivate teacher\n\nPedal Pamphlet. A step-by-step method for becoming skillful with the pedals (2008). The challenge of the Bartok Violin Concerto sent me to the Sibley Music Library where I looked at all the harp methods on the open shelves. The technique of moving the pedals was barely mentioned, except that they had to be moved. There was nothing about the techniques of the great teachers represented in those methods. So I have written a short book with some exercises of my own devising and also nine pedal exercises published by C.H. Nicholas Bochsa in 1814.\n\nAnother reason for this book was to explain that moving the whole leg to move a pedal is not an efficient way to accomplish that task. Given that technique as a basis for performance, the original Bartok passage would have the harpist falling off the bench, and the harp: heaven help it!\n\nThe Pedal Pamphlet is the size of a piece of music, 8½ x 11, so you can play the exercises in it and also read the text from your harp bench while the book is on your music stand.\n\nIn 1962 I married my husband whom I had met at Tanglewood in the summer of 1958 when we were both students at the Berkshire Music Center, I in the student orchestra and he in the Tanglewood Choir. We’ve had a wonderful life filled with music.\n\nCecilia Hervas, MM ’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Music Literature/Piano\n\nStudio Teacher: Jose Echaniz\n\nAfter I left Eastman in 1960, I moved to Philadelphia where I joined a Catholic religious congregation for women, the Assumption Sisters. After three years of religious formation, I was assigned to the Philippines, my home country where I taught Religion, Music and English for 22 years. In 1985, I was given a new mission that led me to Worcester, Massachusetts. There I spent thirteen years at Assumption College as campus minister among college students in search of deeper meaning to their lives. Every summer, I brought a group to our missions in Mexico working with the people, sharing in their daily life. The experience was a taste of the harsh reality of the marginalized and effected in us an inner transformation. It was at this time of my life that I took up the piano again but with a new sense of music as GIFT to be shared. I have since given concerts in this country and in Paris, Denmark and the Philippines, integrating elements of reflection within the program. At present, I work at the parish of St. Stanislaus in Lansdale, Pennsylvania where I continue to play the piano and assist in the growth of the faith community as Pastoral Minister, Pianist and Spiritual Director. I live in community with other Assumption Sisters.\n\nI welcome e-mail messages from my classmates at cjhervas@gmail.com.\n\nWilliam J. Hilbrink, MM ’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Theory/Violin\n\nStudio Teacher: Joseph Knitzer\n\nAfter Eastman, I accepted a teaching/performance position at MacMurray College, Jacksonville, IL. In September 1962, I was offered a teaching and performance position at UNC-G in Greensboro, NC. In 1967, I was appointed as one of 12 string teachers to begin a pilot string program in Fairfax County, VA. I retired from teaching in 1983.\n\nI have been a solo violinist with the Greensboro Symphony Orchestra, Springfield Symphony Orchestra, and Fairfax Symphony Orchestra and have given numerous solo and chamber music recitals throughout NC, IL, and VA. I founded the Fairfax String Quartet, 1983, performing hundreds of concerts. As a free-lance artist, I performed with orchestras at the Kennedy Center, National Theatre, Warner Theatre, Library of Congress, Supreme Court, Wolf Trap, and Ford Theatre. I also conducted concerts as Assistant Director of Fairfax Symphony Orchestra. Recently, I was honored to be inducted into the Hall of Fame at my high school alma mater, Collinwood High School, Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nReflection: My musical experiences enriched my life more than I would ever had anticipated. My Eastman days were the foundation for what followed. Teachers who were instrumental in this were: Joseph Knitzer, John Celantano, Robert Sutton, Wayne Barlow, Allen McHose, and Howard Hanson.\n\nDonald Jackson, BM ’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Trombone\n\nStudio Teacher: Emory Remington\n\n1969 – MD from Upstate Medical Center, Syracuse\n\n1973-1975 – Major, US Army Medical Service\n\n1972-1973, 1975-1977 – Fellow in Cardiology, Strong Memorial Hospital, Rochester, NY\n\n1977-1979 – Assistant Professor of Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center\n\n1979-1984 – Associate Director, Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, Baptist Memorial Hospital, Memphis, TN\n\n1984-2007 – Cardiology Consultants of Topeka, Topeka, KS\n\n2007-present – Semiretired.

Eastman School historian since 2002 and author of “For the Enrichment of Community Life” (2002) and “Serving a Great and Noble Art” (2008). Also an author of dozens of articles on local music history, hymnology, liturgy, etc. Recipient of the Eastman School’s Eisenhart Award for Teaching Excellence (2002) and of the U of Rochester’s Hutchison Medal (2010).\n\nH. Bruce Lobaugh, MM ’60, PhD ’68\n\nMajor/Instrument: Music Literature/Clarinet; Musicology (Advisor: Charles Warren Fox)\n\nStudio Teachers: William Osseck, Stanley Hasty\n\nFollowing my undergraduate studies at Eastman, I taught at Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York (1960-64), was in residence at ESM (1964-66), and taught at the University of Regina, Canada (1966-96). I completed a dissertation on three 16th century German lute books in 1968. At U. of Regina, I was active in organizing an academic university music department in place of a conservatory-oriented structure and in creating undergraduate and graduate degree programs. I was the department head for eleven years, and I conducted various ensembles and taught woodwinds, clarinet, music history, conducting and arranging. I was made full professor in 1975 and am now Professor Emeritus. Among articles published are five articles on lutenists in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, in both 1981 and 2001 editions. In addition, I completed 25 years as clarinetist with the Regina Symphony Orchestra, as well as performed as a soloist and chamber work performer locally and for CBC. I retired to Omaha, Nebraska in 1996, where I taught part time at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, Metropolitan Community College, and Midland Lutheran College in Fremont Nebraska. I am presently a member of an amateur orchestra, Orchestra Omaha, and have performed the Kramar clarinet concerto Op. 36 with this group (2001) and in Winnipeg with the Mennonite Community Orchestra (2007). I conducted five performances of the musical 1776 in Omaha in 2004, and I continue to appear as author, chamber and orchestral musician, arranger and composer. Principal research projects: the career of Homer Moore, American baritone and composer, and the life and career of Harry S. Walker, Canadian military musician of the late 19th century. Presently, I am editing a Walker work and my march “Regina, Saskatchewan” for publication.\n\nReflection: Eastman credentials opened many doors–am very pleased and fortunate that I was able to attend.\n\nAnne Mayer, MM ’59\n\nMajor/Instrument: Piano\n\nStudio Teacher: Armand Basile\n\nI was hired as an Instructor at Carleton College in Northfield, MN in 1959 and remained there for my whole teaching career. I served as co-chair of the music department for 14 years, advanced in rank, and received an endowed professorship: Dye Family Professor of Music.\n\nI won second prize in the WAMSO competition and won a Fulbright for piano study in Vienna. I returned to Vienna 8 more times for sabbatical terms.\n\nPerforming included solo piano, chamber music, and vocal accompanying, and in retirement, I continue performing and doing part-time collaborative piano at both Carleton and St. Olaf Colleges.\n\nSally Lea Williams McClintock, BM ’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Music Education/Piano\n\nStudio Teacher: Mary Nan Hudgins\n\nAfter graduating from Eastman in 1960, I married Jamie (now Jim) McClintock and settled in Rochester to teach music in two elementary schools. One year later we headed west to East Lansing, Michigan and I began teaching music at all levels (K-12) in the East Lansing School District. Our home base remained in East Lansing for the rest of our careers, although we lived in Poland in 1977-1978 when Jim taught at the University of Warsaw. Our two sons, aged 7 and 9, studied at the State School for Musicians completing 2nd and 4th grade and studying trumpet and violin. It was a wonderful year in which we attended many concerts, ballets and operas and also became friends with many musicians. Several years later we lived in Xian, China while Jim and I taught at Xi Bei Da Xue (Northwest University) and the children studied Chinese at Shaanxi Province Language Institute. In a town of 2 million with very few westerners, I was delighted to encounter Eastman grad Elsa Ludwig who was performing on a tour one day.\n\nAfter 33 years as a music educator and then elementary school principal with a Masters and Specialist Degree from Michigan State University, I went to Stanford University to broaden my understanding of international education for K-12 students. It became clear to me that while international education materials were increasingly available, most teachers were neither prepared nor interested in broadening their global perspective. In 1995, I established a nonprofit organization called LATTICE (Linking All Types of Teachers to International Cross-cultural Education), a partnership between 17 mid-Michigan School Districts and Michigan State University. Its mission is to create a learning community and international network that cultivates and supports a global perspective in K-12 classrooms through personal and professional development opportunities. With members and friends from 71 countries, we work together based on the premise that attitudes and beliefs change because of personal relationships.\n\nSince 1995, Jim and I spend time each year in Maine, Michigan, and California (where our two sons live with their wives and one grandchild). We also visit many different places around the world.\n\nReflection: I am grateful for my four years of experiences at the Eastman School of Music and the River Campus of the University of Rochester. Surrounded by gifted classmates and inspiring professors, I worked hard while I was there and have since shared my learning with thousands of children. My life has included wonderful adventures as a wife, mother, grandmother, mentor, educator, administrator, and musician, I love not only the language of music but also the music of many other languages learned in the past fifty years including Polish, Chinese, Spanish and Zulu.\n\nRalph W. Montgomery, BM ’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Music Education/Trumpet\n\nStudio Teacher: Sidney Mear\n\nFollowing my undergraduate studies at Eastman, I received my Masters in Performance from North Texas State University in 1963, and I married the same year. I continued on to Doctoral study at the University of Missouri, Kansas City Conservatory. I directed high school band before I received my MM, and following that I held teaching positions at various times in brass, conducting, and theory at University of Arkansas, Austin Peay State University in Clarkseville, TN, Florida State University, Campbell University, NC, Greenville College, IL, and summer positions at the Christian Artist Music Seminar, Estes Park, CO and Holy Light College, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. I have been an adjudicator for numerous band and brass events in the South and Midwest, and I have conducted a number of bands and a few choirs. I have also been a conductor/performer on approximately 130 television shows. My publications include a filmstrip, “Playing the Trumpet,” designed for junior high students, several articles on brass playing, and over 20 brass ensemble pieces.\n\nI have performed in a number of ensembles, including the Savannah Symphony, Brevard Summer Orchestra, Ft. Worth Symphony Orchestra, Ft. Worth Opera Company, Florida State Chamber Orchestra and Florida State Brass Quintet as first trumpet. I also toured with Euro Brass in Germany in the summer of 1995.\n\nReflection: The long, very cold walks from Prince St.\n\nRuth M. Moore, MA ’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Piano\n\nStudio Teacher: Armand Basile\n\nUpon receiving my degree, I taught general music for 10 years. A long hiatus followed in which I worked mostly in bookstores. For the past 10 years I have been teaching private piano and have been so grateful for my ESM training.\n\nReflection: I just want to say that the McHose method of learning rhythm – one-la-lee – one-ta-te-ta – really works wonders and young children love it.\n\nDonald L. Panhorst, MM ’59, DMA ’68\n\nMajor/Instrument: Music Education/Saxophone, Clarinet, Flute\n\nStudio Teachers: William Osseck, Sigurd Rascher, John Thomas\n\nFrom 1959-1962, I was the Director of Instrumental Music for the Crystal City MO Public Schools. From 1962-1965, I was Director of Music at the Edison Technical High School, Rochester, NY and the Conductor of All-City Junior High School Orchestra.\n\nFollowing receipt of my DMA, I was on staff of Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, Edinboro, PA from 1966-1992. There, I held the following positions:\n\n– Director of Bands\n\n– Professor of Music\n\n– Chairman, Department of Music and Drama\n\n– Dean of Continuing Education\n\n– Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs\n\n– Professor and Asst. Chair, Dept. of Speech and Communication Studies\n\n– Professor Emeritus, Edinboro University of Pennsylvania\n\nIn 1977, I retired from U. S. Naval Reserve with rank of Commander. From 1992-1995, I was a speaker, seminar leader and consultant in leadership and communications skills. In 1993, I published a book, How Ordinary People Can Become Extraordinary Leaders. In 1995, I relocated from Edinboro, PA to Gulf Breeze, FL.\n\nI was a visiting scholar at Zibo University, Zibo, Shandong, P.R. China in 1999. In the summer of 2001, I was a consultant in teaching “speaking English” at the Zibo Foreign Language Institute, Zibo, Shandong, P.R. China. From 2001-2008, I was a guest lecturer on various cruise ships.\n\nCurrently, I am enjoying life in Gulf Breeze, FL. I am a past member of the Board of Directors, Pensacola Opera, Inc., the immediate past president and current member of the Board of Directors and performer in the Pensacola Civic Band. I am a Volunteer Tour Guide for the National Naval Aviation Museum, Pensacola Naval Air Station, FL, and a Volunteer Florida Supreme Court Certified County Court Mediator.\n\nEsther (Anselmi) Parsons, BM’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Piano\n\nStudio Teacher: Orazio Frugoni\n\nSince Eastman, I have been a private piano teacher, a church musician, a high school and community chorus accompanist, and a pianist with a chamber group. In addition, I have given several benefit recitals.\n\nRoland Persson, BM ’59, MM\n\nMajor/Instrument: Music Education/Clarinet; Clarinet Performance\n\nStudio Teacher: William Osseck\n\nI taught music in New York, Texas, and California in public schools and universities (Texas Tech, Sonoma State, Solano Community College). I also taught English at Richmond High School, Richmond, CA. I started work on a Ph.D. in Clarinet performance at TTU, but I couldn’t continue because of finances. I played in the Pacific Wind Ensemble in 2001-2002. I married Eileen Reader in 1972 (She died in October 2009, just short of our 37th Anniversary). I retired in 1999 after 40 years of teaching and am continuing with a private studio. I became a Jehovah’s Witness in 1970 and continue as one. I started studying classical guitar with Albert Valdes-Blain in 1964 and continued with Jim Bogle at TTU in 1980.\n\nWilliam Rich, BM ’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Public School Music/Tuba, DoubleBass\n\nUpon graduation I began teaching music in a small public school in the Adirondacks. It became drafty so I went into the US Air Force as an administrative officer, got out as quickly as I could and returned to my teaching career. Included in the school systems I taught (all in New York State) were Nyack, Tuckahoe, East Ramapo and finally in Clarence. The last three positions were as string specialist.\n\nThe contrabass became my main form of musical expression. While teaching in Rockland County I performed with the Hudson Valley Philharmonic, free lance gigs and conducted the Ramapo Orchestral Society.\n\nWhile in the service I met and married Sharron Holloway. We have 4 children and 11 grandchildren of whom we are very proud.\n\nNear the end of my teaching career I started up a music publishing company – Northfield Press, specializing in music for school and community orchestras. Initially it published my own compositions and arrangements culled from teaching experience and branched out to include many other composers, most notably Everett Gates who, in the process of myriad three hour phone calls and red inked drafts, provided me the equivalent of a degree in music engraving. We sell internationally with Luck’s Music Library becoming our main distributor.\n\nAfter retiring from teaching in 1999, I continue composing and publishing and playing bass in the Amherst Symphony and Amherst Chamber Ensemble. I have resumed my chess and bridge activities; most notably winning the lower divisions of the NY State Chess Championships on two occasions.\n\nReflection: To this day I appreciate the great teachers at Eastman: Donald Knaub, Everett Gates, Oscar Zimmerman, Elvira Wunderlich and all the other teachers and fellow students at ESM who provided the knowledge and inspiration that launched my career and enriched my life.\n\nDavid Richey, BM’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Public School Music/Trombone\n\nAfter graduating from Eastman, I played bass trombone in the Indianapolis Symphony for seven seasons (1960-1967) and in 1961 became a founding member of the Indianapolis Symphony Brass quintet as a tenor trombonist, playing in that group for six years. In 1963 I married Elizabeth Lichty, a violist in the orchestra, and we had two children, Deborah and Gordon. While in Indianapolis, I was Adjunct Instructor of Trombone at Indiana Central College and the Jordan Conservatory of Butler University. In 1963 I completed a Master of Music Degree in Music History at Jordan.\n\nLiz and I left Indianapolis in 1967 to move to Morgantown, West Virginia, where I had accepted a position teaching low brass at West Virginia University. In the spring of 1968 I won the position of bass trombonist in the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra and retired in 2006. The Rochester Philharmonic Brass Quintet formed in 1969, with me as a founding member on bass trombone, and I played with them for thirty years.\n\nSummer positions included the Monteux Conducting School Orchestra in 1959 and 1960, the New Hampshire Music Festival Orchestra from 1961-1964 and 1967-1971, and the Chautauqua Orchestra from 1972-1978.\n\nLiz passed away from breast cancer in 1994, a very sad time. She had played in the RPO for twenty-five years. However, in 1995 I married a wonderful woman named Maggie, an English professor at Roberts Wesleyan College, whom Liz and I had known for twenty years through our church. As a result, I immediately acquired two more wonderful children, Trey and Meegan. At present, Maggie and I have seven grandchildren, four of whom live here in Rochester.\n\nSince retiring, I am still active musically. I continue as Adjunct Instructor of Trombone and Euphonium at Roberts Wesleyan College, a post I have held for almost thirty years. I play regularly with a big band and am a frequent substitute in two others. I also sub on euphonium in local concert bands. At our church, I sing in the choir and lead a brass ensemble and a trombone choir.\n\nBecause I enjoyed my experience as a Boy Scout in my youth, I became active as an adult volunteer when I returned to Rochester and am still at it. Maggie and I attend the church I was confirmed in, and we live in the house I grew up in.\n\nDonna Nagey Robertson, MM ’59\n\nMajor/Instrument: Theory/Organ\n\nStudio Teachers: Norman Peterson, David Craighead\n\nI joined the music faculty at Mars Hill College, Mars Hill, NC, where I taught until my retirement in 2001. There I served as college organist and taught organ, piano, harpsichord, and theory related courses. During that period, I was active as an organ performer, composer, accompanist, and chamber music pianist. Many of my compositions were performed in new music festivals in the 70s and 80s throughout the country. I was also on the original board of directors for the now defunct International League of Women Composers. Since retirement and my husband Joe Chris Robertson’s death, I moved to Asheville, NC, where I sub occasionally in my church and remain active with the Andoin Piano Trio and the Asheville Area Piano Forum. I also continue my composition activities, having many publications to my credit.\n\nReflection: I would enjoy hearing from any of the many friends I made while at Eastman.\n\nJuanelva M.

(LexisNexis, Canada): Senior Systems Analyst\n\nReflection: Since my retirement from my computing job in 2003, I have spent much of my time bird watching. I retired from horn playing a year ago, and my wife (Laura Jaeger, Oboe – St. Louis Sym., Mobile Sym., London, Kitchener & Kingston Syms. & National Arts Center Orch, Ottawa) and I recently returned from a 14,000 mile birding trip that circumnavigated the continent. We left the Gulf Coast just as the oil spill happened, made our way to the West Coast and as far north as Jasper, Alberta. Our homeward trip went through Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota and around the North shore of Lake Superior. We are planning another birding trip to Alaska next summer. I can’t wait to see my “Class of 1960” classmates in October and learn what they have been up to.\n\nRaymond J. Shahin, MM ’59\n\nMajor/Instrument: Trumpet\n\nStudio Teacher: Ted Betts\n\nI am the owner of Impact Music – custom music for bands/orchestra, with over 300 published and unpublished musical works. Snow White and Rose Red – original music, complete with orchestration. I participated in musicals with the Holley NY Rotary, Bishop Kearney High School in Rochester, NY, and Rochester Rotary, etc. I supervised Eastman Students from 1965-82. I composed and arranged music for Bobby Kennedy, Princess Grace, and Gerald Ford commercials, etc. I gave three performances for the Pope in Rome. 300 unpublished charts on file with Heritage Press.\n\nReflection: My Eastman years were positive preparation for teaching and life.\n\nMerton Shatzkin, MM ’58, PhD ’61\n\nMajor/Instrument: Theory/Violin\n\nStudio teacher: Millard Taylor\n\nFollowing my time at Eastman, I taught violin and music history at Pittsburg (KS) State University for three years. I then taught theory, music history, and violin at the University of Missouri-Kansas City from 1964-1997. I have been a part of in residence string quartet, baroque and contemporary ensembles. I played with local contemporary group, NewEar, and was also a member of the Lyric Opera orchestra and the Kansas City Symphony. Many of my compositions have been performed locally. I have had several theoretical papers and articles published, as well as a book: Writing for the Orchestra. Since 1990, I have conducted the Pro-Am Orchestra Medical Arts Symphony. I was married 39 years until widowed, and I have two children and four grandchildren.\n\nVivian Emery Cotellese Speca, BM ’59\n\nMajor/Instrument: Percussion (Marimba)\n\nStudio Teacher: William Street\n\nI retired after 25+ years in Elementary Music Education in the Boyertown, PA School District. While there and ever since, I have been performing professionally as a Marimba soloist. I also have directed a 3-5 year old church choir and at present am the director of a Retirement Community Chorus, performing many times each year and presenting both a Spring and a Holiday Program. My education at ESM is invaluable.\n\nReflection: My experience at Eastman as member of the “Marimba Masters” gave me so much experience performing publicly and fame regarding our appearance on the Ed Sullivan TV Show in 1958 that it has followed me to this very day! (Of course, you must be able to remember Ed Sullivan!!?)\n\nHarold E. Steiman, MM ’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Trombone\n\nStudio Teacher: Emory Remington\n\nFrom 1962-1992, I played second trombone for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. I then became the Personnel Manager of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, remaining in that position until 2005. I am married to Bronna and have two sons: Sam, a Nuclear Engineer with MPR Associates, and Matthew, Assistant Director of the Dickinson College Organic Farm.\n\nMarilyn Richard Synnestvedt, BM ’59\n\nMajor/Instrument: Voice\n\nStudio Teacher: Julius Huehn\n\nIn June 1960, I married the love of my life, Peter N. Synnestvedt (BM ’57, MM ’59). We lived in Memphis, TN, where he taught at Southwestern at Memphis (now Rhodes College) and was principal cellist in the Symphony and Opera Orchestras. I was soloist in a large downtown church and taught 8th grade art and some music in the city system. When our first daughter was born I became a full time mother and homemaker. That summer, Peter was on the faculty at the New England Music camp in Oakland, ME, and I sang on a couple recitals.\n\nIn 1968, we moved to Alliance, OH where Peter was on the faculty of Mount Union College. IN 1987, while I kept the home fires burning with our 3 daughters, Peter completed his Doctorate in instrumental conducting at the College-Conservatory of Music in Cincinnati where he studied with Louis Lane.\n\nOn a few occasions, I did some singing – soloist in Beethoven’s 9th when Peter conducted it with the college orchestra, a joint recital with him at the college, and some solos for church services. Basically I was content to help further his career. I also taught art classes privately having 25-30 students at times. This was while Peter was teaching cello privately, son on Saturdays our home was almost an arts academy.\n\nIn 1989, Peter started the Alliance Symphony, now in its 21st season, and I formed an Orchestra Guild to help further it. Peter retired in 1997 and we travelled across the country twice and “across the pond” to England and then Norway, the lands of our ancestors. In ensuing years, we visited Williamsburg, VA four times and many other areas in the East. In 2003, we both enjoyed my 50th reunion at Alfred University where I majored in Ceramic Design and took part in every major musical event as soloist.\n\nPeter passed away at only 72 in 2004, just shortly after we moved to Muskogee, OK to be near our daughter. Now I hear his cello played by our oldest daughter in the Ft. Smith, AR Symphony. We were both proud of our daughters, all three graduating from college and two earning Masters degrees. All three are involved in education in one form or another and are married. I now have nine grandchildren and at 80 years am hopefully still living a useful life working one morning a week at a free clinic and going on mission trips through my church. I also still love to sew, paint, write poetry, and do yard work.\n\nWilliam H. Teter, BM ’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Voice/Public School Music\n\nI taught music at the high school level, including choirs, musicals, history of music, and music theory. I also taught chorus and orchestra at the Jr. High level for a total of 33 years. I taught privately both voice and piano for 22 years, and was a church minister of music and tenor soloist for 21 years.\n\nI have been married to my wife, Mary Belle, for 53 years, with 3 sons – Douglas, Brian, and Shawn – and 8 grandchildren. I have traveled in all 50 states, the Caribbean, Ireland, Mexico, China, and Canada.\n\nReflection: As I continually looked back over the years, I appreciated more and more the opportunity, the experience, and the education I received at Eastman. How eternally grateful I am to my wife, Mary Belle, for making it possible.\n\nJohn H. Thyhsen, BM ’59, MM ’61\n\nMajor/Instrument: Trumpet\n\nStudio Teacher: Sidney Mear\n\nI became a trumpet instructor at ESM from 1962-1966 while working toward my DMA. I then became a Trumpet Professor and Jazz Ensemble Director at Northeast Louisiana University from 1966-1969 and at Grassboro State (Rowan University) from 1969-2000. I was principal trumpet for the Philadelphia Opera Orchestra from 1975-2000, the Concerto Soloists of Philadelphia from 1980-1995, the Philly Pops Orchestra from 1975-2000, and Orchestra 2001 from 1985-2005. I was also an active Sub in the Philadelphia Orchestra from 1975-2005. I have been and continue to be a free-lance performer in Philadelphia. I have 4 CDs out: Hoagy Carmichael Memoir, Hot Spots I and II, and A Christmas with Friends. I’ve published Odd Meter Tunes Trumpet Method, Trumpet Tunes, and Collage of Unaccompanied Trumpet Tunes.\n\nReflection: The Eastman School environment, professors, and ensembles prepared me for a lifetime of musical and teaching success and happiness.\n\nRobert B. Whitcomb, DMA ’59\n\nMajor/Instrument: Composition\n\nStudio Teachers: Bernard Rogers and Howard Hanson\n\nI have composed music for orchestra, band, chorus, chamber ensembles, various orchestral instruments, voice and keyboard. My compositions have been performed at Town Hall in New York City, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., the Landmark Center in St. Paul, and at many universities. Associated Music Publishers, Elkan-Vogal, Interlochen Press, and World Library of Music have published my compositions.\n\nI graduated from the College of Music of Cincinnati with degrees in piano and composition. My study was interrupted during World War II by three years service in the Army Air Corps. I served as a Control Tower Operator and as a Navigator on a B-17 plane. When my plane was shot down on my 20th bombing mission near Cologne, I became a German Prisoner of War. After returning to the U.S.A., I graduated from college, taught music for several years, and then completed my doctorate at the Eastman School of Music.\n\nI taught music at universities in Wyoming, New Mexico, South Dakota, and in the state of Washington before coming to Southwest Minnesota State University in Marshall, MN. At SMSU I was Professor of Piano, Theory and Composition, as well as Chairman of the Music Department from 1972-80, and again in 1985-87. I have since retired from my teaching duties. I and my wife, Lois, reside in Marshall, MN, and are the parents of three grown sons.\n\nJeanne Sterner Wolfanger, BM ’59\n\nMajor/Instrument: Public School Music/Voice\n\nStudio Teacher: Arthur Kraft\n\nAfter Eastman, I achieved a Master’s degree from Alfred University in Alfred, NY. I was an Assistant Professor of Music at State University of New York in Oneonta. I taught public school music for many years as well as piano, violin, and voice privately. I also retired from Hornell City School District, Hornell, NY in 1991 as a Guidance Counselor. While at Hornell, I organized “Career Days” for Middle School students and again organized College Night programs for area High schools. I am the President of Steuben County Guidance Counselors and other offices.\n\nI organized the Wayland Community Chorus and directed musicals for both the Wayland and Hornell Rotary Clubs. I have directed church choirs and have been an organist for various churches in both New York and Florida. I presently direct the Grace Handbell Choir at Dunnellon Presbyterian Church as well as the Dunnellon Chorale.\n\nReflection: I’ve been very thankful for my association with ESM and the many joys of organizing local musical groups.\n\nEdward M. Wolpert, BM ’59, MA ’60\n\nMajor/Instrument: Theory/Horn/Piano\n\nStudio Teachers: Morris Secon, Henry Rauch\n\nAfter leaving Eastman, I was a pop music arranger for a couple of years in New York City, and then became an instrumental music teacher in elementary schools in Brooklyn. In 1967 I left Brooklyn for the University of Kansas where I earned a Doctor of Education degree in 1970. This began my three-decade career in higher education.\n\nI spent 13 years at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. In 1983, I left Ball State to assume a dean’s position in Georgia. While employed there, I earned a B.A. in French, as well as taking numerous courses in accounting, finance, and economics. I retired in December 2000, and moved to the Atlanta area where I presently reside. Actually, I am semi-retired: I started a personal financial planning business in 1995, and kept it going after retirement.\n\nPresently, I keep busy with financial advising, reading, taking college courses, writing, engaging in wellness activities and, from time to time, some just plain goofing off. I have recently published two books: A Conservative Approach to Trading Options, and The Young Adult’s Guide to Financial Success. And then, of course, there is my music activity.\n\nReflection: Although I was not a professional musician except for a brief period long ago, music has been an important part of my life. For years, I’ve been a steady attendee at musical events whenever and wherever they occur. I studied cello for a number of years while at Ball State and played two seasons in the Muncie Symphony Orchestra, as well as orchestras in Anderson, and Richmond. Then in 1996, in anticipation of retirement, I went back to the baritone horn/euphonium, which I had played in the 84th Army band in 1954-56, regained proficiency, and have played in several wind ensembles in the Atlanta area, and still do. Since I did not make my living as a musician, was it a waste of time and money studying music? The answer is, “Not at all!” I believe an education should help a person make a life as well as make a living. Music, as an avocation, has brought much joy to me over the years, and continues to do so, and my years at Eastman contributed to that.\n\nLucius R. Wyatt, MM ’60, PhD ’74\n\nMajor/Instrument: Trumpet\n\nStudio Teacher: Sidney Mear\n\nAfter receiving the degree Master of Music, my first professional appointment was to the faculty of Tuskegee Institute (now University), where I served as director of bands for ten years. During my military service I was a musician with the USAREUR Band in Heidelberg, Germany. Later I returned to Eastman and completed the PhD in music theory. I joined the faculty of Prairie View A&M University in Texas, where I taught trumpet and music theory and analysis, as well as directed the University Symphonic band in more than 120 concerts during my tenure of 32 years. I also served as department chair for fourteen years. My wife, Christine, a former English teacher, and I are enjoying our retirement. Our son and daughter live in nearby Houston.\n\nReflection: I value very highly my educational experiences at Eastman. I have a high regard for all of my Eastman professors and the school’s commitment to excellence. The writing of my dissertation was one of the great challenges of my life, while making the Sibley Music Library my second home. I have pleasant memories of my performing in the Eastman Wind Ensemble under Dr. Donald Hunsberger. In all, Eastman was truly a wonderful, enriching experience."
