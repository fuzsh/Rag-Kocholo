        "meta_description": "A good Thursday morning (which will lead into a stormy Thursday afternoon) but what does it matter because Lollapalooza is here finally. While some of us will be streaming the four day fest (I am some of us,) others like our very own Ninja Turtle/Wolverine hybrid will be found wandering the ground. The same could be said for Angi, who will spend most of her time trying to remember where she exactly buried all her drugs. While it should be a completely inebriated good time, over on the other side of the world, patrons are not so lucky. In our very Olympic centric show this me, we found out that Paris is apparently not the place to be when it comes to enjoying athletes performing at their peak. This is not a knock on the people who are giving it their all but the event itself because it turns out booze is not served at any of the Olympic venues. That's right, if you want to be a soccer hooligan, you're going to need to do it sober since all the wine and beer has been locked up (to be fair, they probably just assumed Angi was coming for the show and wanted to be precautious.) Needless to say, fans are pissed that they can't enjoy a cold one on 100 degree days and with good reason. If I'm going to watch people compete, I want to be completely bombed (which is good advice on how to get through five of these shows a week as well.) Marris reminded us that when Qatar had the World Cup, fans were also not allowed to drink in the stadiums but there was at least tailgating outside to get fans in the proper mood. Worse than no drinks in the stadium where pommel horse bro and large dong swimmer are is that there are no venues within the area that people can get turnt up at as well. They do offer soda but if that soda isn't filled with booze, why even bother drinking it? Of course, there is a stipulation (shocker) that the VIP lounges allow people to have booze. So not only are you paying an arm, leg and spleen to go to these events, you also have to pay extra or be special to get your hands on some hooch. Needless to say (even though I just rambled on about it,) people are furious. A guy who came all the way from Albuquerque found out the hard way after walking up and down the streets looking for refreshment only to find it did not exist. Angi said she would demand a refund and Marris said he would go anywhere else. The smartest solution though is pretty simple honestly, just go wine country while in France and watch the events on TV. That's what we're doing here and we have been drunk for days now.",
