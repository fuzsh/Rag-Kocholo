While some of us may know little, in most cases, of the details of their lives, we all do know from our own living that there may have been times of exceptional joy and moments perhaps of deep despair; times of learning and efforts put fort for forgetting; periods of overflowing fulfillment and episodes of devastating emptiness; being surrounded by the warmth and coziness of affection and experiencing of all these real or imagined emotions and sensations can make up a life. It is this that we celebrate today. We celebrate LIFE!”\n\nThe National Association of American Veterans, Inc. (NAAV) Constance A.

The full complement of all these real or imagined emotions and sensations can make up a life. It is their life on earth that we celebrate today!\n\nFortitude by Margaret Peterson\n\nA strength that comes from deep within\n\nThat only God can give …\n\nWithout it people could give up\n\nIf times were hard to live.\n\nI’ve needed this and came to see\n\nI needed the Giver more…\n\nMore than just for church on Sundays,\n\nHe had to be my core!\n\nWe go through every day together,\n\nHappy for chances to give…\n\nEver drawing closer to God\n\nAll the days that I live.\n\nMessage of Inspiration – Poem of Life – Author Unknown\n\nLife is but a stopping place,\n\nA pause in what’s to be,\n\nA resting place along the road,\n\nto sweet eternity.\n\nWe all have different journeys,\n\nDifferent paths along the way,\n\nWe all were meant to learn some things,\n\nbut never meant to stay …\n\nOur destination is a place,\n\nFar greater that we know.\n\nFor some the journey’s slow.\n\nAnd when the journey finally ends,\n\nWe’ll claim a great reward,\n\nAnd find an everlasting peace,\n\nTogether with the LORD.\n\nMessage of Inspiration – The Train of Life – Author Unknown\n\nLife is like a journey on a train\n\nAt birth, we boarded the train of life and met our parents,\n\nand we believed that they would always travel by our side.\n\nHowever, at some point in time in life and at some station,\n\nour parents will step down from the train, leaving us on life’s journey.\n\nAs time goes by, other significant people will board the train:\n\nsiblings, other children, friends, and perhaps the love of your life.\n\nMany who have joined our train of life will step down and leave a permanent\n\nvacuum.\n\nOthers on our train will go on unnoticed that we will not realize that they even\n\nvacated their seats! This train ride will be mixture of joy, sorrow, fantasy,\n\nexpectations, hellos, goodbyes, and farewells.\n\nBut know that a successful journey consists of having a good relationship with\n\nall passengers, requiring that we give the best of ourselves. Because the mystery\n\nthat prevails is that we do not know at which station we ourselves will have to step\n\noff the train. So, we must try to travel along the track of life in the best possible\n\nway – loving, forgiving, giving, and sharing.\n\nWhen the time comes for us to step off the train and leave our seat empty – we hope\n\nto leave behind beautiful memories for those who continue to travel on the train of\n\nlife.\n\nLet’s remember to thank our Creator for giving us life to participate in this journey.\n\nThe program was presented by the AFRH chaplains with closing remarks by Susan Bryhan, Administrator, AFRH-Washington.\n\nMaurice “Moe” Roma Aube passed away at his home in Spring Hill, Florida on Monday, June 11, 2018 at the age of 85.
