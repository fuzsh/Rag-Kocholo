        "text": "The interview from CRN with the leaders of the different distributors was a great read, and shared some great insight into the thoughtful direction of each of the distributors. Daniel Campbell asked what I think is one of the most important questions. \"What do we do for the innovators that are coming in that need distribution?\" Talking with teams of IT Buyers, they struggle to discover the latest technologies. Like, why Alkira, Inc. is such an important solution for folks who have installed VMware or what companies. Or how Dubber's Unified Call Recording as a Service can improve business outcomes. And then there is the unique company CUBE Group Global that can create dynamic and engaging hold messages that drive results. These are just a small example of unique companies providing solutions business need. But, if a B2b buyer is only learning about them through the channel, then it is the responsibility of distribution to provide a solution. Patrick Zammit's quote \"What we did over the last three years is help our partners diversify their businesses as enablement is a core competency for us\". Is ringing more true today as the team at TD SYNNEX, continues its work to diversify the partners by providing a clear path for innovative technologies to reach the partner base. We are excited to be supporting this initiative. Together we introduced new technologies such as eSentire to the partner base. This The Channel Company article is a good read. https://lnkd.in/eFqGQGkx\n\nKirk Robinson, EVP and president of North America for Ingram Micro, on helping IT service partners. ‚ÄòIf you look at the industry trends, more partners are moving towards digital transformation, and adopting advanced solutions which is great because it gives the partners the ability to expand their services offerings down to their end customer. When you look at that, there's a couple of things that we can all do, distributors and vendors, to help our partners. One of them is how do we help them become more of a strategic partner with our end customer? How do we help them deliver value that goes way beyond the classic IT support? How do we help them focus on business outcomes? If we do that, I think we all prosper. If we‚Äôre looking at some of the new areas today, like AI and machine learning automation, they are still the difference maker in the ecosystem from the end customer. For the partner, distributor or vendor I would say they're more valued than ever by the corporations they work with, big or small. The partner is also getting a lot of attention from the vendor community, from their peers and from PE firms because they're driving more and more of their business to ARR (annual recurring revenue) and MRR (monthly recurring revenue) and becoming more profitable.‚Äô #ingrammicro #OneIngram #ShowingUpDifferently #Disruption Kirk Robinson Ingram Micro\n\nKind of a big shake-up here - but this line pretty much says it all: ‚ÄúIt seemed doomed to fail, because you can‚Äôt take a racehorse and hook a buggy up to it. You have to let him run,‚Äù an Intelisys partner, who asked not to be named, told Channel Futures.\" John DeLozier will no doubt land well. In this instance, the capabilities of the ScanSource team/leadership weren't enough to overcome the challenges of folding into a larger entity along with the industry challenges of well-funded competitors. Looking forward to seeing DeLozier's next gig. #channel #scansource #channelfutures\n\nPartnering for Excellence: Elevate Your Veeam Journey with TD SYNNEX üöÄ In the dynamic world of IT solutions, choosing the right distribution partner is paramount.
