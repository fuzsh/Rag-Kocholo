        "text": "However, it also had detractors, there were people who believed that some of the scientists who had been imported into the United States were accomplices or had directly participated in crimes that made them unfit for US residence and citizenship. For example, it was said that von Braun himself must have been aware that thousands of forced laborers had been killed in the underground factory at Nördhausen where the V-2 rockets were being built. Another example was that of the scientist Georg Rickhey, who was transferred to the United States in the framework of Operation Paperclip and indicted for war crimes in 1947. He was curiously acquitted and returned to the US, to continue with his work for the government. Finally, the case of Hubertus Strughold, related through written tests with the terrible medical experiments of the Concentration Camp of Dachau, never faced charges. In despite of all these critiques, they were not sanctioned or taken away from their jobs to face justice, on the contrary they were awarded with responsibilities, for example, in 1960, the Rocket Development Center was transferred from the Army to NASA and there they were entrusted with the construction of the gigantic Saturn rockets. Von Braun became the director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the main designer of Saturn V, which during the years 1969 and 1972 would take Americans to the Moon. This accomplishment made him worthy of the American indulgency and\n\nBraungardt, a teenager from Kansas, is best known for his trampoline videos, which make use of his springy skills. Beyond those clips, his busy upload schedule also includes multitudinous vlogs and many other formats. Thanks to his hard work and the help of a representation team that includes talent agency CAA and Max Benator and Evan Weiss of Red Sun Entertainment, he has landed new opportunities for himself and his channel. Now, as he heads to Los Angeles to further jumpstart his career, we spoke to him about what he has achieved so far.\n\nVon Braun the leader of the scientists had discussed with the other chief designers about the possibility of surrendering to the Americans. Cadbury states that the German scientists decided that the best solution would be to go to the Americans because they had the capabilities of creating a functional space program (14). In order to achieve this they would have to be very careful not to get caught because if they were it would be considered treason and they would be executed by the government. A few months before the war ended the entire V2 experimental team and their research made the move from Peenemünde to Mittelwerk which was the production base for the V2 missile which was made with slave labor. At Mittelwerk the German scientists were “guarded” by the SS who had orders to shoot them rather than let them fall into enemy hands. The German scientists meanwhile made plans for their getaway by buying an abandoned mine in order to store the years of research that they had gained and also turned their guards away from their mission and had them become regular soldiers and surrender to the Americans alongside them. The U.S army and the Soviet intelligence agency NKVD had been tracking the rocketeers and had been trying to recruit them. On the second of May the German scientists finally encountered the Americans and they were all taken by the American Army into\n\nThe creation of the V-2 rocket was a very important and impactful invention by the German. There have been many cultural and social factors related to the creation of this rocket seeing how it was built during World War 2. The creation of this rocket has also made a huge impact on the U.S. and their aerospace field. There were many cultural factor in the development of the V2, one of those factors was that the Nazis party believed that Germans were the pinnacle of the human race, the Aryan race; thus, planning to instill fear into their enemies the development of the V2, a long range ballistic missiles, came to be. (Edward, 2011)\n\nAdolf Hitler was born in Branau am Inn, Austria on 20th April 1889 was the fourth of 6 children to Alois Hitler and Klara Polzl . Branau am Inn was a small town across the Inn River from Germany. When he was 3 years old, his family moved to Linz, Austria . He attended school in Linz and was a good student while he was studying in primary school. In high school, he was a very poor student and angered his father.
