Died Friday Morning and Body is Brought Here For Burial - Formerly Male Nurse At the Holy Family Hospital - Sister Resides Here. A message of death, carrying its weight of sorrow to the hearts of many friends in the announcement of the demise of Frank O'Brien, a former Manitowoc boy, flashed over the wires from Denver, Col., Friday night and came with the shock of a surprise, as it was not known that the life of the young man was in any danger. Mr. O'Brien was taken ill but a few days ago, and although friends here were notified, they were unaware of the seriousness of his condition. An attack of pneumonia caused the demise, which occurred Alma, Colorado, at 5 o'clock Friday morning. Frank O'Brien was born and reared in Manitowoc county and up to within two months ago was employed at the Holy Family hospital, where he had charge of the Water Cure department and performed the duties of masseur. He was also a nurse and assisted in the care of male patients. In November he decided to go west, where his father and brothers are engaged in mining and where he intended to work. He was appointed foreman at one of the mines and continued his service until taken ill, a cold developing pneumonia which proved fatal in a few days. Decedent was 20 years of age and a young man who had won the respect and esteem of Manitowoc citizens with whom he became acquainted. He was of retiring disposition and devoted his time to study in prep- aration for higher ambitions in life. He was popular with his friends, and the sorrow caused in the announcement of his death will extend to many who knew him. It seems a cruel dispensation of Divine Providence which calls this life just in the beginning of its usefulness and at a time when the future was so filled with promise. Besides a father, three brothers, at Denver, and one sister, who is a teacher at the Silver Lake Convent survive. The body will be brought here for burial and will probably arrive tonight. Manitowoc Daily Herald, Saturday, January 19, 1901, p. 1 ********* The remains of Frank O'Brien deceased at Denver, will not arrive here until Wednesday, and as yet it is not known when the funeral will be held. The announcement of the death o the young man was received with regret by many who knew him. Manitowoc Daily Herald, Monday, January 21, 1901, p. 1 ******** Deaths of a Week: Frank O'Brien, formerly of Manitowoc, but late a resident of Denver, Col., died in that city last Friday. The body of the young man reached this city yesterday and it will be laid to rest in the Catholic cemetery. Manitowoc Pilot, Wis., Thursday, January 24, 1901 pg. 1\n\nSR. M. SERAPHIM OBRIEN (d. 1896) DEATH OF SISTER M.

Manitowoc Herald News, Thursday, July 3, 1924 P.2\n\nSR. M. DESALES REGAN HOSPITAL HEAD DIES AFTER A LONG ILLNESS Sister M. de Sales, Superintendent For 15 Years, Was 67 Years Old Sister M. de Sales, for the last 15 years superintendent of the Holy Family hospital, and a member of the board of consultors of the Holy Family convent, died at the hospital early this morning after a long illness. Although she had been able to attend to the administrative duties of the hospital until shortly before her death, she had been troubled with a heart condition for several years. A brother, Father David Regan, pastor of St. Joseph's Catholic church at Berlin, Wis., was with her when she died. There are four other brothers and a sister. Funeral details are indefinite, but rites will probably be held Wednesday morning at the Holy Family convent at Alverno. Came Here in 1923 Sister de Sales was 67 years old. She was born in Waukesha county in 1871, and her family name was Regan. She entered the Holy Family convent at Alverno when she was a young woman and after her novitiate she was assigned to a teaching position. She taught in elementary and high schools in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, and in 1923 she was appointed administrative head of the hospital here. When Sister de Sales took over the hospital duties here the local institution consist solely of the old hospital building. Sister de Sales realized that it was inadequate to care for the growing needs of the city, and immediately began plans for expansion. The first building to be erected was the new power house, and an addition to that became the laundry. Finally, in 1929, the $325,000 building was constructed and added to the old building to become the center of hospital operations. Working with Sister de Sales, the late R.J. Findlan and the late George Vits formed a committee to raise funds for the hospital. Nearly $200,000 in individual contributions was given Manitowoc citizens, and when 92.77 per cent of the total pledges was collected, it set a record for collection of pledges made to semi-public institutions, and the record has never been broken in the United States. Sister de Sales was named to the hospital post because of her particular ability to draw people together in harmonious working relationship, her business ability and her tact. The nursing school grew under her direction from a small enterprise to become one of the important parts of the hospital.
