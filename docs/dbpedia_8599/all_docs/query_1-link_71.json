        "text": "We get asked a lot of questions here at Corky Carroll’s Surf School. How do you turtle roll? What kind of surfboard should I ride? Are my feet positioned correctly? Where is the bathroom? Why is it raining? Can I have a donut? The list goes on. But by far the most asked question is: Who is Corky Carroll?\n\nWell, we’re glad you asked…\n\nCorky Carroll and Our Surf School\n\nOur surf school is the result of one man’s awesome idea and another’s amazing career. It all happened in 1996 when local resident Rick Walker approached professional surf icon Corky Carroll with a business proposition: opening the first surf school in Huntington Beach.\n\nRead How Rick Walker Came Up With His Surf School Idea and Why It’s Not Named After Him\n\nThe school was named after Corky, whose prolific surfing career has made him one of the most recognizable and accomplished surfers of all-time.\n\nToday, we still use the fundamentals and techniques Corky came up with in our lessons.\n\nSo when you’re taking a surf lesson from one of our instructors, you’re also learning to surf from one of the most iconic surfers of all-time.\n\nWhich we think is pretty cool.\n\nThat said, the question still stands: Who is Corky Carroll?\n\nCorky Carroll – The First Professional Surfer\n\nFun Fact: Corky Carroll is considered the first professional surfer of all-time.\n\nSo it just makes sense that the first surf school in Huntington Beach be named after him. But long before he joined Rick Walker in forming our surf school, Corky was making waves dating all the way back to when he was a little grom.\n\nHere’s a brief highlight reel of the Man, the Myth, the (Surf) Legend that is Corky Carroll:\n\nHis real name is Charles Curtis Carroll. (Corky is his nickname)\n\nHe won over 100 surf competitions\n\nHe was the first person paid to surf (and put “surfer” as his profession on tax returns)\n\nHe was the first surfer to receive endorsements\n\nHe was the first surfer to have a production model shortboard\n\nHe was voted “Best Surfer in the World” in a 1968 Surfer magazine readers poll\n\nHe retired from professional surfing at the ripe old age of 24\n\nHe was inducted into the Surfing Walk of Fame. Twice. And Surfers’ Hall of Fame\n\nHe is the only pro surfer with a gold record (Tan Punks on Boards)\n\nHe wrote 3 books\n\nHe starred in 13 heroic Miller Lite commercials. Like this one:\n\nWhile that highlight reel is impressive, the stories behind those accolades and achievements are even better. So let’s start from the beginning and find out how Corky Carroll became Corky Carroll.\n\nCorky Carroll Learns to Surf\n\nCorky grew up in Surfside, California. Located between Huntington Beach and Seal Beach, the Surfside Colony was an awesome place where some of the best surfers of the Golden Age of Surfing lived and surfed.\n\nCorky learned to surf when he was 8-years-old. (The same age when groms can start at our summer surf camp. Coincidence? We think not.) His first surfboard was an 8’7″ longboard made from balsa wood. It was shaped by famous Seal Beach surfboard shaper Dick Barrymore and weighed more than kid Corky did.\n\nFrom then on Corky Carroll was stoked for surfing.\n\nCorky Carroll Learns to Shoot the Pier\n\nOne memorable story Corky tells is how he learned to ‘shoot the pier’ in Huntington Beach. As a young gremmie (that’s what they used to call groms back in the 50s), he built a makeshift surfboard rack for his bike using a red wagon.\n\nConsider it the original surf wagon.\n\nUsing his awesome invention, Corky would tug his huge balsa surfboard down the PCH from Surfside all the way to HB’s pier. Along the way he passed through Tin Can Beach (later renamed Bolsa Chica State Beach, and the home of our surf school. Coincidence? We think not). Paddling out into rolling 6-footers, he noticed a bunch of older surfers riding daringly through the pylons of the massive pier.\n\nAt first Corky was scared to try. You know, because death.\n\nBut then local HB surf legend Chuck Linnen paddled over and gave young Corky some sage advice on how to thread through the pier in style.\n\nJust goes to show a surf lesson from a good instructor can go a long way.\n\nEspecially when that instructor has an awesome stache, as seen in this shot from a couple years later of Corky and his surf coach:\n\nBefore long Corky was shooting the pier with the best of them.\n\nAnd thus began a long-lasting relationship between him and one of California’s most iconic surf spots, which would one day culminate with the creation of our surf school.\n\nBut we’re getting ahead of ourselves.\n\nCorky Carroll Learns to Win\n\nCorky Carroll started competing in surfing contests when he was 11-years-old.\n\nHe placed 3rd in the first contest he ever entered — a junior division heat at the inaugural West Coast Surfing Championships in Huntington Beach. Held in 1959, this was the first major surf contest in California, and the forbearer of today’s epic weeklong U.S Open of Surfing that takes place every summer on the pier’s south side.\n\n(That’s right, for awhile there Huntington Beach made competitors wear helmets in contests. Everyone hated them.)\n\nThis kicked off a 13 year career as a competitive surfer. During that time Corky racked up five wins at the United States Surfboard Championships in HB (renamed from the West Coast Surfing Championships) and was named the United States Surfing Association’s “best all around surfer” five consecutive times.\n\nHis first major win came in 1962 at the San Clemente Surf Capades. (Which might go down in history as the best named surf contest of all-time.) There was also three International Professional Championships, an International Big Wave Championship, a World Small Wave Championship, and, as Corky puts it, “a bunch of other less glorious sounding titles.”\n\nBelow Corky (center) hoists the 1967 US Surfing Championships trophy.\n\n(Props to anyone who can name the rest of the surfers in this photo.)\n\nWhen all was said and done, Corky would go on to win over 100 contests.\n\nCorky Carroll Becomes the First Professional Surfer\n\nWith each mounting success, Corky’s reputation grew.\n\nSoon he caught the eye of Hobie Alter, the pioneer surfboard shaper from Dana Point who a few years earlier had opened the first Southern California surf shop. Hobie decided to sponsor Corky, paying him $80 a week to use and promote Hobie Surfboards.\n\nWith that sweet payday Corky Carroll — at the age of 16 — became the first person paid to surf and the first surfer to strike an endorsement deal.\n\nTwo years later Corky kicked things up a notch when he won a $1,500/year sponsorship with Jantzen Sportswear. In other words, he was rolling in the dough.\n\nAt least as far as surfers go.\n\nAt age 18, Corky decided to make it official and put “professional surfer” on his 1965 tax return. Sure beats accountant. (No offense accountants.)\n\nBut his professional exploits weren’t limited just to riding surfboards. He was also at the forefront of developing them. In 1967, Corky Carroll’s Hobie Mini Model was introduced as the first production shortboard in America. That same year, thanks to board royalties, product endorsements and a nice bonus check from Hobie for several TV appearances, Corky earned over $30,000.\n\nAdjusted for inflation that’s the equivalent of over $230,000 today.\n\nNot too shabby for a beach bum.\n\nCorky Carroll Becomes a Star\n\nNot too many people have enjoyed the popularity that Corky Carroll was able to ride thanks to one day at the age 8 deciding to pick up a surfboard. For starters there were the countless ads he’s appeared in, like for Ocean Spray, Coca Cola, Chrysler and Jantzen Sports.\n\nSome of them didn’t even have anything to do with surfing.\n\nSince then he’s also appeared in countless films, most of them related to surfing. These include the two most iconic surf films of all-time: Five Summer Stories and The Endless Summer. And the surf cult classing North Shore.\n\nIn 1964, as part of the promotional tour for The Endless Summer, Corky appeared on The Tonight Show to teach Johnny Carson and the rest of America how to “sidewalk surf” (aka skateboard).\n\nHe’s even voiced a character on SpongeBob. It doesn’t get much bigger than that.\n\nCorky Carroll Retires from Surfing, Becomes a Musician\n\nBy 1972 the competitive surfing world was changing and Corky decided it was time to hang up his board (as a pro) and replace it with a guitar.\n\nIn fact, Corky had been playing music even longer then he’d been surfing. When he was 7 his mom made him take piano lessons (as moms often do). But tickling the ivory took a backseat to riding waves. That is until he was a teen attending Huntington Beach High School when he picked up music again, teaching himself guitar.\n\nHe continued to riff here and there whenever he had the time in between surfing contests.\n\nOn one occasion the Beach Boys even asked if he’d go on tour with them, believing it would add credibility if they had a “real surfer” in the band. Corky passed. Music was still no match for professional surfing.\n\nLater on, as his pro surfing career was winding down, Corky started to pursue music more seriously, learning multiple instruments and performing in local bars and small concert venues around Orange County.\n\nIn 1971, just prior to his retirement, Corky released his first album entitled Laid Back.\n\nOver the next thirty plus years music would play a huge part in Corky’s life. During that time he performed both as a solo act and with his many band incarnations including Corky Carroll and the Piranha, Corky Carroll and the Coolwater Casuals, and our personal favorite, Corky Carroll and the Funk Dog Surf Band.\n\nIn 1979 his musical output reached a high point with A Surfer for President.\n\nA Surfer for President by Corky Carroll\n\nThat album included the hit single Tan Punks on Boards, which sold 500,000. As far as we can tell this makes Corky the only past or present pro surfer to have a gold-selling record. (Scroll down to track 6 in the player above to hear this gem.)\n\n“Riding through a guitar solo or singing is much like riding a wave on surfboard. You’re climbing and dropping and tucking into little sections and it’s a lot of ad-lib and expression.” ~ Corky Carroll\n\nAt the turn of the millennium Corky was the house musician at Duke’s restaurant in Huntington Beach. Imagine that. Stop by Duke’s for a fish taco and get sung to by one of the best surfers of all-time.\n\nReason 10,024 to love HB.\n\nAnd Corky Carroll.\n\nCorky Carroll Stars as a Beach Bum\n\nWhile moonlighting as a musician, Corky ran through a gamut of other jobs. From bartender to waiter, lounge singer, manager of a car dealership, actor, tennis pro, ski instructor, advertising director for Surfer magazine, balloon salesman — Corky made the rounds.\n\nIn the early 80s Corky started living the dream by “playing” a happy go-lucky, perpetually jobless surfer in Miller Lite beer commercials. It was part of a very successful Miller ad campaign featuring retired athletes from different sports. They were known collectively as the “Miller Lite All-Stars.”\n\nAs Corky tells it, the Miller Lite All-Stars’ main job was to tour the country spreading good times and doing such things as visiting ski resorts, skiing all day wearing “Miller Lite All-Stars” parkas, and going to nearby bars to hand out Miller Lite swag and buy rounds for everybody.\n\nIt’s a hard life but somebody’s gotta do it.\n\nAnd Corky Carroll did.\n\nCorky Carroll Helps Start Our Surf School\n\nIt all started one fateful day in 1996 at the Windansea Surf Shop in Huntington Beach.\n\nWell actually it started a little before that when Corky appeared on a LA sports talk television show called Life in Sports. The show featured interviews with pro athletes from the past and present. It was produced by a local HB guy named Rick Walker, who for the past 12 years had been commuting back and forth from Orange County to Los Angeles and was ready for bigger and wavier things.\n\nNamely, starting a surf school.\n\nAfter meeting Corky and having the surf legend on his show, Rick saw an opportunity.\n\nAround then Corky was splitting his time between giving tennis lessons and managing Windansea. In fact, Rick’s daughter had been taking one of Corky’s tennis classes. (That’s Kelsey, who today helps run the show at our surf school. Coincidence? We think not.) One night Rick Walker walked into Windansea.\n\nRick: Hey Corky.\n\nCorky Carroll: Hey Rick.\n\nRick: I see you’re teaching tennis these days.\n\nCorky Carroll: Yeah, that’s right.\n\nRick: Why?\n\nCorky Carroll: I really enjoy it. I’m good at it. And people pay me to do it. What’s not to love?\n\nRick: [looks at Corky funny] I don’t get it.\n\nCorky Carroll: Maybe you didn’t hear the part about people paying me.\n\nRick: You’re a surfer. You should be teaching surfing.\n\nCorky Carroll: [laughs] Well, if you can show me how to make a living doing that I would be happy to listen.\n\nRick: [smiles]\n\nBy this time there had been no shortage of offers coming Corky Carroll’s way. So he took Rick’s idea of starting a surf school with a grain of salt. But, having nothing to lose, Corky said, “Yeah sure, you get it together and I’m in.”\n\nFive months pass. Corky has forgotten about the whole thing. And then one day Rick shows up at the surf shop and says, “O.K., I got it all organized. We have a location, boards, permits and insurance. The Corky Carroll Surf School opens June 15th.”\n\nAnd it did open. On June 15th, 1996 at an uncrowded stretch of beach in Bolsa Chica State Park.\n\n[The conversations above are paraphrased from Corky Carroll’s own enjoyable recount of how he first met Rick.]\n\nCorky Carroll spent most of that first summer training instructors and developing the surfing techniques that would become the backbone of our lessons.\n\nTechniques which we still use to this day.\n\nCorky Carroll Gets Immortalized\n\nThe same summer Corky partnered up with Rick Walker to start our surf school, he was also inducted into the Surfing Walk of Fame. You’ve probably seen it. Heck, you’ve probably walked your dogs over it.\n\nThe Surfing Walk of Fame is laid out on the sidewalk in front of Jack’s Surfboards, at the corner of Main and PCH in Huntington Beach. It is a lineup of all the greatest surf legends, immortalized with plaques in the pavement. There you’ll find Duke Kahanamoku (“the father of surfing”), George Freeth (the first person ever known to surf in HB), Bruce Brown (the director of The Endless Summer), PT Townend (the first pro surf tour world champion), and Joyce Hoffman (the first woman to charge Pipeline), amongst many other amazing surfers and shapers.\n\nYou’ll also find Corky Carroll. Twice.\n\nOn Aug 8, 1996 he was honored as the Local Hero in one of the Walk of Fame’s best classes (alongside Greg Noll, Rell Sunn, Bud Browne, and Nat Young). He was then honored again in 2004 with a second plaque as a Walk of Fame Surf Champion.\n\nBecause when you’re that good one plaque just isn’t enough.\n\nRight across the street in front of Huntington Surf and Sport, Corky was also inducted into the Surfers’ Hall of Fame. That was in 2002 as part of the Hall of Fame’s inaugural first group of inductees. It included some other people you might of heard of like Kelly Slater, Laird Hamilton, Robert August, Joel Tudor and Lisa Andersen.\n\nNow that’s a lineup!\n\nCorky Carroll’s Legacy as a Jobless Surfer\n\nTo say the least Corky Carroll has earned the right to have his name (and handprint) immortalized.\n\nHis impressive career as the first professional surfer speaks for itself. So too does his impressive career as a musician. Don’t forget his equally as impressive career handing out free beer as a Miller Lite All-Star. Or helping inspire our surf school. His antics are stuff of local legend, like that time he stacked 40 surfboards atop a VW and successfully drove down HB’s Main Street. Equally as legendary is his ability to talk story, proving it every week with his rad column in the Orange County Register.\n\nAny way you look at it, he is a fun loving guy who has embodied surfing and its lifestyle to the fullest.\n\nOr as Corky puts it, “Yes, I still surf all the time, and no, I still don’t have a real job. Let’s hope it never comes to that.”\n\nBecause that is who Corky Carroll is.\n\nSoft top surfboards are a great board to have in any surfer’s quiver. In fact, we’ll go so far as to say every surfer should have one. Say what you will about them, but soft top surfboards are one thing above all else: FUN!\n\nAfter all isn’t that why we all started surfing in the first place?\n\nEveryone uses soft top surfboards from world champions to the first time surfer. Jamie O’Brien shredded Pipeline on a soft top. Then he did it again at Jaws with Kalani Chapman. Mick Fanning has his own line of softboards. Big wave ripper Shawn Dollar founded the soft-top-only Wavestorm World Championships. And surf schools from Maui to Bali, J-Bay, Bells, Nosara, and Huntington Beach all use foamies as their go-to teaching boards.\n\nTo help find the perfect soft top surfboard for you, we’re going to breakdown which ones are best for which levels of surfing and wave types below. But first let’s get to know these foam topped sticks a little better.\n\nWhat Exactly is a Soft Top Surfboard?\n\nA soft top surfboard is just as it’s name describes — a surfboard with a soft deck top. Traditional surfboards are made with either a polyurethane (PU) or expanded polystyrene (EMS) foam, then covered with a polyester or epoxy resin that creates a hardened surface around the board. Hence, hard top surfboards.\n\nLearn More About the Difference Between Poly and Epoxy Surfboards\n\nSoft top surfboards are made with an EPS foam core (like epoxy surfboards) wrapped in either fiberglass or a synthetic wrap. The big difference is that they replace that hardened fiberglass or epoxy top layer with a soft, dentable Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate (EVA) sheet. Think exercise mats, the insoles of your sneakers, yoga blocks, and kick boards — they’re all made of the same material as a soft top surfboard.\n\nThe EVA top layer combined with the compressed EPS core make soft top surfboards lighter, float better, less susceptible to rot, and harder to ding than traditional hard top surfboards. The soft deck top also allows for a easier and more comfortable paddle. And unlike resined, hard top surfboards, soft tops don’t require wax or any additional material to prevent slippage.\n\nDespite their most often being associated as longboards, soft tops come in a variety of shapes and sizes. For example, Mick Fanning’s Little Marley goes as small as a 29L 5’2″. But no matter how big or small they are, all soft tops are characterized as being more buoyant, lightweight, and stable than most fiberglass or epoxy surfboard of the same size.\n\nWe’re not saying soft tops are better than hard tops, but they certainly give classic surfboards a run for their money. Literally. Because they also often come with a much smaller price tag. Thanks in no small part to the king of discounted prices — Costco.\n\nA Brief History of Soft Top Surfboards\n\nSoft top surfboards were born from boogie boards. Reminiscent of inflatable surf mats and planked belly boards of old, the Boogie Board was invented by Tom Morey out of Hawaii in 1971. Morey, a mathematician and surfing inventor, used polyethylene foam to model (using a hot iron!) a square-tailed, round-nosed roughly 4 foot soft board that people could catch waves on while lying prone. He named his squishy topped squat board the Boogie Board (after the the Boogie-Woogie blues music he enjoyed listening to: “Boogie swung, and it had a wiggle and a jiggle to it. It was perfect.”).\n\nDuring the 80s and 90s Boogie Boards took took off. These surf-riding sponges quickly became a beach staple, spawning sponsored bodyboarding teams and its own competitive contest, and becoming the new go-to wave riding brand of young beachgoers everywhere.\n\nSurfers however were not as stoked. From the growing popularity of Boogie Boards erupted a huge bodyboarding scene. As a result, the new fad was overcrowding the waters and reignited the debate over what exactly constitutes surfing. But the bodyboarding industry ignored all that (because money) and new advancements in technology and materials soon brought the two water activities together.\n\nIn 2006, a former manager of the Boogie Board brand — Matt Zilinskas — teamed up with AGIT Global to create the “first standup experience” for surfers on a Boogie-esque board. At the time AGIT Global was the manufacturer for Boogie Boards. Zilinskas worked with John Yeh – a Taiwanese businessman and CEO of AGIT’s North America division — to develop an entirely new product applying the sandwiched bodyboard design of expanded polystyrene foam and plastic into a a full sized surfboard. They called their soft topped creation Wavestorm.\n\nSafer and more buoyant than traditional surfboards, Wavestorm hit the market as the ultimate beginner board. And thanks to being easier and cheaper to produce the Wavestorm allowed AGIT to manufacture a high-volume priced a third of what most beginner surfboards cost. Costco, always looking for a good deal, took notice and began disturbing them in their coastal warehouses. And where Costco goes, shoppers follow. According to Bloomberg Business, by 2015 over half a million Wavestorms had been sold.\n\nAs Wavestorms ask the “Costco Surfboard” took over new players entered the soft top scene like Catch Surf, Softech, MF Softboards, the list goes on. AGIT even produces other brands including our preferred soft top for teaching surf lessons — Storm Blade. (But more on those in a moment.)\n\nThere was a time when surfers were against riding anything but massive, wooden 30 pound longboards. When wetsuits came out, many scoffed at using them. Early versions of the now-iconic Malibu Chip were chastised as “girl boards” until the guys started riding them, and fell in love. The first short boards were deemed ridiculous and a passing trend. In fact, with each new major evolution of the sport you could count on one thing — hardcore surfers balking. Then they would try it for themselves, realize how fun the new fad made surfing, and adapt it as their own.\n\nThe latest in this long line of “disruptive” surfing innovations is the soft top surfboard. Which had at first threatened to destroy all that is sacred about surfing, and now is spreading joy to both newbies and old hats alike.\n\nA Guide to Soft Top Surfboards for Every Level of Surfing\n\nNow that we know the who, what, and where of why soft top surfboards are so great, let’s take a look at which one is for you. In the following guide we’ll go over the best soft top surfboards, discussing which you should ride depending on your experience and the conditions.\n\nWe have used soft tops at our surf school for years and compared them all. We’ve also talked to many pro and amateur surfers to see what they prefer and tried out every high performance soft top in the surfing industry. So not only are we huge advocates of riding soft top surfboards, we love riding them ourselves.\n\nBest Soft Top Surfboard for Beginners\n\nWe all want to have fun right? When learning how to surf you want to have a surfboard with a lot of foam. This will help you paddle easier and will let you catch a ton of waves compared to a smaller soft top surfboard. We recommend an 8ft-9ft soft top surfboard with as much width and thickness as possible.\n\nOur favorite for learning how to surf and beginners is the 9ft Stormblade SSR soft top surfboard.\n\nThe SSR is perfect for learning how to surf on any type of waves. With the added foam it is very buoyant and easy to learn on. Guaranteed, on a Storm Blade soft top will be standing up in no time. That’s why we us it exclusively to teach new surfers.\n\nWhy You Should Not Learn to Surf on a Costco Surfboard\n\nIt’s not just us though. Soft top foam surfboards are widely used in surf schools across the world, in particular the Storm Blade SSR. That’s because they are specifically shaped to have lots of volume and stability so you can catch lots of waves and remain more stable when trying to stand up. They are also durable as heck, and can withstand even the harshest of beatings. And perhaps most importantly, their extra soft deck reduces the risk of accidents and injuries.\n\nBest Soft Top Surfboards for Intermediate and Advanced Surfers\n\nBeginners aren’t the only ones getting stoked on soft tops. Nowadays you can find any style soft top for all conditions and skill levels. For your small wave days there’s the perfect summer surf longboards that any surfer can ride, like the Storm Blades. For your medium size days there are what we call “fun shape” soft tops which are more high performance than your longboard, can make steep drops and do radical turns. Finally there are soft tops that are like high performance short boards in which you can get barreled and throw airs on.\n\nHere is our favorite soft top surfboards for intermediate and advanced surfers:\n\nTakayama Scorpion\n\nThe Takayama Scorpion Soft Top Surfboard is one of our favorite soft tops in the surf industry right now. They ride really well in small surf but are also awesome at handling bigger surf. The round tail helps with different wave heights but still remains loose enough to be able to throw down turns. The thermal formed EVA soft top deck allows you to grip the board comfortably but still be able to let loose in more high performance waves.\n\nCatch Surf Odysea\n\nCatch Surf is one of the leading soft top companies in the world right now. They have every kind of high performance soft top you can imagine. With the short board fun factor they create soft tops that will let you surf the way you want. They are super responsive in massive shore break and super cruisey on small longboard waves. You know when we mentioned earlier Jamie O’Brien conquered Pipeline on a soft top surfboard? He did it on a Catch Surf Odysea.\n\nThe quad-fin Odysea Skipper is one of the most enjoyable soft tops to shred on. They range in size from 5’6″ to 6’6″, and have a classic fish shape that allows for down-the-line-speed and stylish turns.\n\nAnother rad Catch Surf model is the Lost Round-Nose Fish (RNF). It is designed after what is cited as the world’s best-selling fish model of all-time from shaper Matt “Mayhem” Biolos. Thanks to its winged swallow tail and tai-fin thruster setup is can rip it in everything from knee-high runners to heavy shore-break, allowing for rail-to-rail surfing and easy paddling.\n\nINT 7’0 Funboard\n\nINT Surfboards have been one of the new up and coming companies to master the soft top industry. Their 7′ classic funboard makes our list because it paddles like a longboard but performs like a shortboard. It gives you enough to room to paddle around the line up with ease, has pop-up stability, and is responsiveness enough to execute tighter turns or make it down steeper waves.\n\nMick Fanning Little Marley\n\nThe last soft top surfboard on our list is from your very own world champions Mick Fanning. With MF Softboards, he has created his own model of soft tops that represent all the best of his surfing.\n\nWhen it comes to soft top shortboards the MF Little Marley is rules the waves.\n\nIf you didn’t feel the foam on your feet you would swear you were riding a real fiberglass board. The Little Marley is for all around fun but does best in more high-performance situations. Its short, wide, and fast which make it one of the more versatile soft tops in the surf industry.\n\nShred Hard, Stay Soft\n\nWhether you are just learning how to surf on small waves or a legendary surfer shredding towering breaks, you will have fun on soft top surfboard. Every day they grow more popular and their designs getting better and better everyday. The latest soft top technology is set to pump foamies to the top of the surfing industry for years to come. Everyone should have at least one soft top in their quiver of surfboards and if not then you are late to the game.\n\nBack in the day soft tops use to be frowned upon. Not just because they were seen as being for “kooks” and “noobs” but because they weren’t made to ride the way most experienced surfers would want. They were always falling apart and never had the performance level you were hoping for.\n\nBut times have changed. New designs and innovations have made them just as sweet as regular hard top boards to ride. Now soft top surfboards are so popular pro surfers are coming out with their own high performance soft top companies. The foam logs have opened up the sport in ways never seen before, making it more accessible, friendly and fun. And with the growth of wave pools on the horizon you can be rest assured the soft top industry will only grow bigger.\n\nWhether you are just learning to surf or a seasoned pro, you are seriously missing out if you aren’t experiencing soft top stoke.\n\nSo if you’re asking yourself should I try surfing on a soft top surfboard? The answer is a definitive YEEWWW!\n\nPreparing For Your Surf Lesson\n\nHave a Positive Attitude\n\nThe number one rule for preparing for your surf lesson is having a positive mindset. Surfing is about one thing above all else: having fun! Keeping an open mindset will keep you positive and focused on enjoying your surf lesson experience. By going into your surf lesson with a negative or apprehensive mindset, you are setting the tone for the rest of the lesson and it may not be as rewarding.\n\nBe Confident\n\nGo into your surf lesson with confidence. The first step to learning how to do something is believing you can. If you think you are going to be able to surf than there is nothing holding you back. I you think you’re capable of learning to surf than it will be easier to accomplish. Stay confident and you will be successful.\n\nMother Nature always Has the Final Say\n\nSurfing is different than most sports in many ways. The waves and conditions are changing constantly throughout the day. Some days we can know exactly what the conditions should look like, but other days mother nature throws us a wildcard. Surfing demands a lot more patience than other sports because at the end of the day, the conditions will ultimately make the decision. Sometimes the forecast can read like an incredible beach day, but by the time you get there it is be so foggy that you can’t even see the waves. This is one barrier that, unfortunately, preparing for a surf lesson cannot necessarily help you with, but it can prepare you for the potential that conditions may not be favorable for a successful lesson.\n\nUnderstand Surfing Isn’t Easy\n\nOne of the best things about surfing is that is forces you to be in the moment. The ocean will not stop for you and it will make you have to work hard to be able to conquer it. You can be preparing for your surf lesson for months but it might take some time to learn, just like riding a bike. You can’t expect to immediately be a pro surfer or never fall, making mistakes is key to learning how to surf faster. Surfing new spots can be tricky. That’s why it is so important to learn to surf at a good beginner surf spot.\n\nThat’s why we hold all our surf lessons at Bolsa Chica in Huntington Beach. Quite, simple it is the place to learn to surf in the area. In fact, we’ll go so far as to say it’s the place place to learn to surf in all of California.\n\nLearn Why Bolsa Chica is the Best Beginner Surf Spot in California\n\nThe best surfer is the one having the most fun, and most of the time that isn’t the one who is the best in the lineup.\n\nPhysical Capabilities\n\nKnowing how to swim is one of the biggest keys for preparing for your surf lesson. If you don’t know how to swim it will be a little scary while trying to learn how to surf but if you tell us ahead of time we can make arrangements for helping you learn. Here are some workouts you can do to prepare for you surf lesson. Swimming: Swimming can help build up your endurance for paddling in the water, the more endurance your arms have the easier it will be to catch waves and the more you will catch. You would be surprised that surfing is actually 90% paddling, so having good paddling endurance is a good first step. Yoga is another activity that will help you while learning how to surf. The more flexible you are the easier it will be to learn how to stand up and the easier standing up is for you the more energy you will have to surf longer. When learning how to surf I would also look up videos or read blogs about the basics of learning how to surf to give you some insight before your lesson.\n\nPlan in Advance\n\nThe last thing you want to do is run late for a surf lesson. It takes some time to sign in, put sunscreen on, throw a wet suit on your body, and walk down to the water’s edge, so planning to arrive on time is crucial. On top of that the instructor most likely has another lesson booked immediately after yours and every lesson must run on time, regardless of arrival time. The longer you have with your instructor the more time you have to learn how to surf. Knowing Huntington Beach, you never know if there are events going on or maybe the freeways have traffic, so you need to make sure that you look ahead of time so you can plan your departure time accordingly. You also want to know what to pack for a day at the beach so you don’t run into any conflicts. Another step to prepare for your surf lesson is to be well rested and eat a good meal before coming to the beach. A good meal doesn’t mean eating a lot of food, while that may fill you up it will up, it will also make you feel sick when doing exercise in the ocean. Not eating at all will make your body feel fatigued and you may end up feeling sick, therefore stopping the lesson. Just a small to moderate sized, nutrient dense food will better prepare your body for the lesson.\n\nPoly vs Epoxy Boards: What’s The Difference?\n\nWhen you buy or rent a surfboard, you probably don’t give much thought to the process that goes into making it. Who was the shaper? Where was it made? What type of foam blank was used? What type of resin was used to coat the board? While these are all valid questions the one we get asked the most often is what is the difference between poly vs epoxy boards?\n\nPoly Technology\n\nPolyurethane blanks (PU) date back to the 50’s, when Hobie Alter first popularized the design as an alternative to balsa wood. When compared to traditional wood boards, PU foam is lighter, easier to shape, and enhances performance. According to the American Chemistry Council, “polyurethanes are formed by reacting a polyol (an alcohol with more than two reactive hydroxyl groups per molecule) with a diisocyanate or a polymeric isocyanate in the presence of suitable catalysts and additives.” PU/PE are built using a polyurethane foam blank and then glassing it with a polyester resin. A particular draw of using PU foam is that it is closed cell—meaning it won’t easily soak up resin or water (should you ding your board), which helps keep the board light.\n\nEpoxy Technology\n\nEpoxy surfboards came into the picture a bit later and it wasn’t until the 90’s that they really caught on. Typically, epoxy boards are made from EPS foam and are coated in epoxy resin. EPS foam is produced by feeding tiny polystyrene spears into a machine and then adding steam (with small amounts of pentane gas) to expand the beads and then mold them together. EPS is an open cell foam, meaning it’s extremely water absorbent. In order to keep the board water tight, shapers add extra layers of fiberglass and epoxy resin. Traditionally, most hand shapers don’t make boards from EPS foam but it is a great resource for pop-out boards.\n\nPros and Cons: Poly vs Epoxy\n\nLike most things in life, there are pros and cons to each design. Surfers tend to like different boards for different conditions and some surfers surf better on different types of boards because of body structure. In general, PU/PE boards are cheaper than EPS/Epoxy boards. Poly boards tend to be heavier, which means they sit lower in the water, making them the ideal design for riding barrels. They are also a lot more flexible, something that has yet to fully be matched with EPS foam. Most poly boards will be more fragile then epoxy because epoxy material is harder than poly. If you want to try out certain equipment before buying it and dont know where the best wave is to do that at, go to Bolsa Chica State Beach #1 Rated Beach to Learn To Surf to get an understanding how we at Corky Carroll’s Surf School Private Lessons do it!\n\nEpoxy boards, on the other hand, are much lighter, making them the perfect board for airs or quick turns. Epoxy boards also tend to be a better option for beginners as they are lighter, float better, and are more difficult to ding. EPS foam is also more environmentally friendly than polyurethane because it can be recycled and re-purposed.\n\nThere is no wrong or right choice when selecting a surfboard—do your research and decide what is the best fit for you. Before investing in a board of your own, consider renting or demoing to find your best fit.\n\nCorky Carroll’s Surf School\n\nIf you are a beginner surfer or just need some more progressive tips but are scared to use a hard surfboard go check out why Foam Surfboards are our number one board to use!

Experience the endless summer at two unique locations: Huntington Beach, California and Nosara, Costa Rica. Whether you are a seasoned surfer or new to surfing, you may have questions or doubts about equipment and/or surf coaching. Here are a few tips we’ve rounded up from years of experience on the water. Go to Private Surf Lessons if you want a detailed surf lesson teaching you how to do all the things that are mentioned below.\n\nSelect the proper board: Surf Lesson\n\nA common mistake among beginners is opting for too small of a board too quickly. When learning, you’ll likely experience the most luck on a longer, wider board. The reason it is easier to learn on a bigger board is that it has more buoyancy. The more buoyancy you have the more stable it is to be able to get up on your feet. As you become more confident in your surfing, you can try transitioning to a shorter board that still has some width and thickness to it (ex. a fish). With modern surfboard technology, you should be able to find a nice, stable board with no need to sacrifice performance. They make surfboards that are short but have as much volume (buoyancy) as a long board has which will be your transition board. Foam is your friend, the more foam the more fun for learning! You can learn all these things while taking a surf lesson with us! Our Surfing Frequently Asked Questions page will help you determine your equipment you will need to ride waves with ease. Go check it out Frequently Asked Questions: Surfing\n\nFind your sweet spot\n\nEvery surfboard has a sweet spot, or the point on the board where there is an equal amount of weight and volume on all sides of the board. We also call this the balance point on our board. The first things Corky Carroll’s Surf School does in their surf lessons is help the student find the sweet spot. In order to find this spot you need to go in the ocean and float on your board. If the nose of the board is in the water you are to far up on the board. If your nose of your board is to high above the water then you are to far back on your board. You look at your board as it is like boat, if to many people are on the left side of the boat, the boat will sink going left. So if you are to far on one side of your board then you will sink and you are not in the sweet spot. The sweet spot is important to note because it should be situated between your feet when riding a wave. Every board, surfer, and wave is unique so you may to play around to find your specific sweet spot, but this is a good rule of thumb for finding it.\n\nHuntington Beach Private Surf Lessons\n\nKnow the differences between paddling techniques\n\nWhen trying to reinvent your surfing you will need to learn paddling techniques. When paddling out into the lineup there are a couple things to keep in mind. Before heading out, look for channels to paddle through (finding one can save you lots of energy). You’ll also want to time your paddle—it’s much easier to paddle out between sets than in the middle of one. If there is shorebreak, you should not start paddling until you are past it. It will be easier to walk to the opposite side of the shorebreak before you start paddling. Lastly, paddle hard. When a wave breaks in front of you, you want to have some momentum going forward so its easier to get over. You are going to either have to go over the wave doing a half push up or you are going to have to turtle roll.\n\nWhen paddling to catch a wave you’ll want to find a good position on your board—if you’re too far forward you’ll nose dive but if you’re too far back you may not catch the wave. It may take some time to master but you’ll eventually get a feel for it. When you take off, keep your head down, your legs together, tighten your core, cup your hands, and build up speed. Once you think you have the wave, execute two more quick strokes before popping up. This will all be taught by our professional instructors during the surf lessons we put on.\n\nChoose your location between the surf school in Huntington Beach, California or our surf resort in Nosara, Costa Rica. Each has something to offer for surfers of all skills and ability levels—whether you’re looking to ride a wave for the first time or expand your skill set, we’re here to help.

Each is unique in its construction and design but all are similar in the fact that they provide surf and stoke in places where waves would otherwise be unavailable. Here, we take a look at five of the top wave pools on the planet and discuss their backstory, the technology behind them, and public access. Try not to froth too hard.\n\nThe Surf Ranch: Wave Pool\n\nLeemore, California\n\nIn 2007, Kelly Slater founded the Kelly Slater Wave Company (KSWC) with the goal of creating a soliton wave, or a wave that maintains its shape while moving at a constant velocity. In 2015, Slater’s dream came to life when the first footage of the artificial wave was released to the public. The technology behind the wave is simple yet wildly complex: a 100-ton hydrofoil is pushed along a 700-yard track, resulting in six-foot waves that last about a minute. The wave is often regarded as one of the most perfect waves on the planet and in September of 2018, the CT hosted its first event at The Surf Ranch. For now, the wave is invitation only but expansion plans should open the wave to the public in the near future.\n\nhttps://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/14006-the-facts-and-figures-behind-kelly-slater-surf-ranch\n\nhttp://www.kswaveco.com\n\nThe BSR Cable Park\n\nWaco, Texas\n\nThe BSR Cable Park put Waco, Texas on the map as a premier surf destination in early 2018 when footage of Seth Moniz doing a massive backflip on the wave was released. The park features multiple breaks, with waves suitable for beginner, intermediate, and advanced surfers. From the minds of Jamie O’Brien and Cheyne Magnusson, the pool is fueled by 24, 10-foot wide air chambers. The result: 240-feet of wave generating area. In addition to waves, the park offers a lazy river, an epic water slide, and an on-site hotel. The park is open to the public and one-hour sessions run from $60-$90, depending on your wave choice.\n\nhttps://www.bsrcablepark.com/bsr-surf-resort/\n\nhttps://stabmag.com/news/a-new-texas-wavepool-designed-by-jamie-obrien-and-cheyne-magnusson/\n\nSurf Snowdonia\n\nConwy, North Wales, United Kingdom\n\nSurf Snowdonia was born in North Wales, United Kingdom in August of 2015. Set against a backdrop of forests and mountains, Surf Snowdonia offers beginner, intermediate, and advanced waves to satisfy surfers of all skill levels. The wave features Wavegarden technology through which a hydrodynamic wavefoil powered by a gearless drive system displaces water under a pier to form glassy swell. In addition to waves, the park offers lessons, food, and unique lodging options. The park is open to the public and hour-long sessions cost somewhere in the ballpark of $60.\n\nhttps://www.surfsnowdonia.com\n\nNLand\n\nAustin, Texas\n\nFounded in 2016 by Doug Coors, NLand made its mark as the largest surf park in the world. In an effort to be as energy efficient as possible, the park features Wavegarden technology. To further their efforts in sustainability, the lagoon is 100% self-sustaining and uses a state-of-the-art water filtration system that meets or exceeds the standards set by the World Health Organization and the Environmental Protection Agency. The park is open to the public and features beginner, intermediate, and advanced waves as well as surf lessons from expert coaching staff.\n\nhttps://wavegarden.com\n\nhttp://nlandsurfpark.com\n\nUnit Surf Pool\n\nAnywhere\n\nBorn in Cologne, Germany, Unit Surf Pool is the first floating surf pool as well as the most efficient artificial stationary wave on the planet. The Unit Surf Pool brings a surfable wave to any body of standing water, meaning an endless water supply and no need for chemical water treatment. Pumps pull water to the surface where gravity then creates a powerful stream heading down the ramp into the wave generating section of the pool. When the stream meets the body of water, a stationary deepwater wave is created. The Unit Surf Pool can operate in any standing body of water with a minimum depth two meters, is available in five sizes, and can be up and running in less than four months.\n\nhttps://www.surf-pool.com\n\nWave pools offer a controlled platform, with perfect waves on a loop, making them the ideal place to learn to surf or hone in your skills. While scoring surf in landlocked regions is certainly worth experiencing, there’s something to be said about the magic and unpredictability of riding waves in the ocean. There are thousands of waves to choose from but two of our favorites are in Huntington Beach, California and Nosara, Costa Rica. When you’re ready to put your wave pool skills to the test, come join us at one of our kids’ camps or all-inclusive retreats—our expert coaches will help ease the transition from manufactured waves to everything the ocean has to offer. Go to Huntington Beach Surf Camp for our summer surf camp in Huntington Beach or go to Costa Rican Surf Resort for our international surf retreat.\n\nWritten by: Rebecca Parsons"
