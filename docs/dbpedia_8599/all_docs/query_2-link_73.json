        "text": "Unrealistic expectations Last week a teenager with nearly a million followers on Instagram admitted her glamorous online life was effectively a lie. All of her envy-inducing pictures of “off guard” moments (right) were carefully crafted and bore no resemblance to her reality. Our special report on page 18 reveals just how damaging social media can be as people make themselves depressed because they’re not living up to a life that absolutely no one is leading! If you love our reports and stories we’ve got another treat for you this week – a free 24- page real-life magazine. Turn to page 58... and enjoy! CLOSEREDITOR@CLOSERMAG.CO.UK…\n\nRelaxing on a sun-kissed beach in the Maldives last week, Sam Faiers couldn’t hide her happiness as she showed off her seven-month baby bump, while enjoying a romantic break with boyfriend Paul Knightley. The star’s first child is due in January and insiders say Sam has never felt healthier, or happier with her body. Reality star Sam, 24, was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease – an inflammatory bowel disorder – in February 2014 and saw her weight plummet to just 7st. The 5ft 6 star overhauled her diet to help manage the condition and adopted a healthier lifestyle. But sources say that since falling pregnant, she’s relaxed her strict regime, and is feeling good for it. A source reveals: “Sam says the pregnancy has actually helped stabilise her condition. She’s relaxed her diet and…\n\n• Shock new claims Tom had explosive tantrums and is controlled by religion • Actor terrified Hollywood will shun him and fears he’s a ‘laughing stock’ • Ex-wife Katie Holmes appears to support author of new tell-all book He’s one of Hollywood’s most bankable actors, worth an estimated £300 million, but Tom Cruise has become as famous for being the celebrity poster boy for the controversial Scientology religion as he is for his movies. And an explosive new book by former Scientology member Leah Remini is threatening to overshadow his stellar career – claiming Tom, 53, is a troubled and controlling man, prone to epic tantrums and who is “not used to being told no.” In her memoir Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood And Scientology, 45-year-old actress and director Leah – who left the religion in 2013 after…\n\n• In her book, Leah claims Tom raged at assistants when he could not find cookie dough and flipped when he was handed a chipped mug by another. She writes: “It was horrible to watch someone I admired come undone, and even worse to witness the fear in the assistant’s eyes.” • Leah says she was horrified at Tom’s 2006 wedding to actress Katie Holmes when she found their then seven-month-old daughter Suri crying on a bathroom floor, while three women – including Tom’s sister and his assistant – stood staring. • After the wedding, Leah says she shared a car with Isabella and Connor, Tom’s adopted children with ex-wife Nicole Kidman, and asked if they ever saw their mother, to which Isabella allegedly replied: “Not if I have a choice. Our…\n\nShe’s the queen of the shock factor, but last week Jordan’s attention-seeking antics appeared to backfire as she accidentally revealed her surgery scars on the red carpet at the Hunger Games premiere. The mum-of-five – real name Katie Price – posed up with husband Kieran Hayler, 28, and surprised fans as she stood in her pants and a bizarre cape that was swept up in a gust of wind, exposing her bum and flashing her side-boob, plus surgery scars. ONLINE BACKLASH Critics were quick to blast her appearance online. One user said: “It’s just a shame she’s cut up like that. Should have at least worn body make-up on that scar,” while another added: “Does she not understand that dressing like that does not make her attractive? It makes her look cheap.” But sources…\n\nHer relationship with George Kay was fraught with heartache and turmoil before dramatically imploding last month when he was charged with assaulting her and the unlawful possession of a Taser gun. But as Kerry Katona – who suffers with bipolar disorder – adjusts to life as a single mum-of-five, friends reveal she’s struggling with her heartache and even wonders if she could ever take George back. FEELING GUILTY A source says: “Kerry misses George. She hates going to sleep alone and has asked her mum, Sue, to share the bed with her on nights she’s feeling particularly low. “As George was a former rugby union player, the Rugby World Cup final triggered a lot of emotions it reminded her of happier times and she posted photos of her and George together on Facebook. “Even though…"
