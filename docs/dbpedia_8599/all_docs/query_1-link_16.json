        "text": "Template:Copyedit Template:About\n\nIn the context of this article, the term ex-Nazi, or more correctly ex-Nazi Party member refers either to those few who were once Nazis and resigned from the party (the NSDAP), or more often to those who belonged to the party at the time when it was declared illegal and was disbanded upon the victory of the Allies. Many of the latter group had to go through a process of denazification and some were subjected to the Nuremberg process, while others managed to escape trial, in particular through the ODESSA organization. In the mid-1950s, most condemned during these trials were given amnesty and subsequently released. This article is not about the ideology of the individuals listed, simply about their past membership in the NSDAP. In this sense, an \"ex-Nazi\" may have continued to be a convinced Nazi, just as a communist may have remained so after his party was disbanded and forbidden to operate in Germany or, conversely, the person may have been a member of the party for expedient reasons and never held the ideology.\n\nFamous Nazi hunters such as Simon Wiesenthal have tried to bring Nazis accused of crimes to justice. However, only a few of them, famous figures such as Sebastian Wiemann and Adolf Eichmann (convicted and hanged in Ramla in 1962), have been found. Many others (Josef Mengele, Aribert Heim, Walter Rauff, etc.) escaped justice, finding refuge in Franquist Spain (e.g. Otto Skorzeny), South America (especially Juan Peron's Argentina, Chile, Alfredo Stroessner's Paraguay, Brazil, etc.) and also in some Arab states. Some former Nazis even managed to obtain very important positions in West Germany after the war (e.g. Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Chancellor of West Germany from 1966 to 1969). Furthermore, a number of former Nazis were recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency after the war (e.g. Otto Albrecht: \"Why Israel's capture of Eichmann caused panic at the CIA\", The Guardian, June 8, 2006), as part of the Gehlen Organization predecessor of the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND).
