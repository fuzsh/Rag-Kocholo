        "text": "In the later eighteenth century, John Wesley's Methodist Connexion experienced periodic but sudden outbreaks of religious fervour, leading to ‘multiplied conversions’:Footnote 1 what were termed local revivals. Typically, these were spontaneous rather than planned; were led by lay members, often women; involved child conversions; and emphasized the ministry of prayer rather than preaching. As Henry Rack observes, however: ‘By the 1830s the professionals had moved in with prescriptions and special techniques which guaranteed a revival if they were followed.’Footnote 2\n\nOther students of revival such as John Kent, David Bebbington and Michael McClymond have also perceived this trend.Footnote 3 From its inception as part of the mid-eighteenth-century Evangelical Revival,Footnote 4 Wesley's mission had been characterized by what David Hempton has called ‘the interior dialectic of Methodist experience – its combination of spiritual freedom and order’.Footnote 5 Over time, however, the ‘institutional’ dimension had grown more powerful than the ‘inspirational’ one, and ‘Methodism was transformed from a renewal movement within Anglicanism into an autonomous organized church.’Footnote 6 This article explores this transition through reviewing the debate around 1800 about whether and how continuing outbreaks of local revival could find their place within this new church."
