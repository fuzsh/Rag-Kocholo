        "text": "Guy Stern (b. Günther Stern) was born in 1922 in Hildesheim, Germany. The morning after Hitler came to power, on January 31, 1933, he remembers seeing a parade of men in Nazi uniforms marching on the streets below the family’s apartment.\n\n“We stayed home and [my parents] said, “Don’t even look out the window,” Guy recalled. “At the very tail end of that parade were my classmates.”\n\nIn November 1937, Guy’s parents managed to send him to the United States, where he was supported by an aunt and uncle in St. Louis. There, he worked tirelessly to try to secure visas for his parents and brother and sister back in Germany. But he was ultimately unable to find them a suitable sponsor and their visas were never granted.\n\nAn American girlfriend suggested he change his name to “Guy” because she felt “Günther” was too difficult to pronounce. After finishing high school, Guy joined the U.S. Army and trained as an intelligence officer. He landed in Normandy in June 1944, served his unit by interrogating captured Germans, and witnessed the liberation of Buchenwald.\n\n“People told me their stories. But it was a skeleton you were talking to,” Guy remembered. “I was a hardened soldier by then, but I couldn’t help myself. So, I was crying.”"
