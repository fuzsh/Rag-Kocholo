        "text": "Rick Grimes: So this is where you plan to do it?\n\nShane Walsh: As good a place as any.\n\nRick Grimes: At least have the balls to call this what it is: murder. You really believe if you walk back onto that farm alone, no me, no Randall...\n\nShane Walsh: Why don't you hush up?\n\nRick Grimes: You really believe they're gonna buy whatever bullshit story you cook up?\n\nShane Walsh: That's just it, it ain't no story. I saw that prisoner shoot you down. I ran after him, I snapped his neck. It ain't gonna be easy, but Lori and Carl, they'll get over you. They done it before. They just gonna have to.\n\n[raises gun]\n\nRick Grimes: Why? Why now? I thought we worked this all out.\n\nShane Walsh: [chuckling] We tried to kill each other, man. What you think, we were just gonna forget about it? Oh, we gonna ride off into the sunset together?\n\nRick Grimes: You're gonna kill me in cold blood? Screw my wife? Have my children, *my* children, call you \"daddy\"? Is that what you want? That life won't be worth a damn. I know you. You won't be able to live with this.\n\nShane Walsh: What you know 'bout what I can live with? You got no idea what I can live with, what I live with! You wanna talk about what I can do, Rick? How 'bout what you can do.\n\n[holsters weapon]\n\nShane Walsh: Here I am. Come on, man, raise your gun.\n\nRick Grimes: No. No, I will not.\n\nShane Walsh: What happened, Rick? I thought you weren't the good guy anymore; ain't that what you said? Even right here, right now, you ain't gonna fight for 'em? I'm a better father than you, Rick! I'm better for Lori than you, man! It's because I'm a better man than you, Rick, 'cause I can be here and I'll fight for it. But you come back here and you just *destroy* everything!... You got a broken woman. Y-you got a weak boy. You ain't got the first clue on how to fix it.\n\n[points gun at Rick]\n\nShane Walsh: Raise your gun.\n\nRick Grimes: You're gonna have to kill an unarmed man.\n\nNegan: [Rick chases Negan; He fires his gun at Negan, but misses, while Negan hides behind a tree; Rick catches up to Negan and the two begin to physically fight each other, with Negan gaining the upper hand and kicking Rick to the ground, leaving Negan to grab \"Lucille\"] Just so you know, that \"Eeny Meeny Miny Moe\"? That was bullshit. I made a choice. I just didn't want to kill a kid's Dad in front of him. Turns out, that would've been the best thing I could've done. And I'd have done it if the kid might still be alive.\n\n[Rick reaches up and punches Negan, knocking him off of his feet; they both remain on the ground, then turn to look at each other]\n\nRick Grimes: You're beat. Your people are down.\n\nNegan: [Struggling to his feet] I'll get out of it. I always do.\n\n[He makes it to his feet]\n\nNegan: It's just you and me, Rick. And you? You are torn open. I am bigger. I am badder. And I got a bat.\n\nRick Grimes: We could have a future.\n\nNegan: I know I will.\n\nRick Grimes: [Begins struggling to his feet] Just give me... give me 10 seconds. I could tell you how.\n\nNegan: No.\n\nRick Grimes: [Making it to his feet] Just give us 10 seconds for Carl.\n\nNegan: 10... 9...\n\nRick Grimes: Carl said it don't have to be... it don't have to be fighting anymore.\n\nNegan: Kid was wrong. 8...\n\nRick Grimes: No. He was right.\n\n[Negan begins crying, letting his guard down; Rick then slashes Negan's throat, with Negan falling to his knees, holding his wounded throat]\n\nNegan: Look what you did. Carl... didn't know a damn thing.\n\n[He falls over]\n\nRick Grimes: [Rick stands over Negan, reminiscing of time when Carl was little, with he and Rick walking down a farm road; Rick then drops to the ground the shard of glass he used to slash Negan's throat; Rick turns around to find the rest of his militia, with the remaining Saviors as prisoners, watching him; He then approaches them] Save him.\n\n[Siddiq heads on over to begin treating Negan's wound]\n\nMaggie Greene: NO!\n\nMichonne: Maggie! Maggie!\n\n[Michonne begins holding Maggie back]\n\nMaggie Greene: NO! HE CAN'T! NO! NO, HE KILLED GLENN!\n\nRick Grimes: We have to.\n\nMaggie Greene: WE HAVE TO END IT! RICK! WE HAVE TO MAKE IT RIGHT!\n\nMichonne: [Still holding Maggie back] It's alright. It's alright. It's over.\n\nMaggie Greene: [Crying] NO! IT'S NOT OVER! IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL HE'S DEAD! IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL'S DEAD! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!\n\n[Maggie continues crying]\n\nRick Grimes: What happened, what we did, what we lost, there's gotta be something there. All this, all this is just what was. There's gotta be something after.\n\n[He walks away]\n\nRosita Espinosa: [Rosita looks over at Eugene, who sabotaged the Saviors' guns, switch back to Rick's side] What happened to their guns? Was that you?\n\nEugene Porter: It was. I introduced the sabotaging aspect of the manufacturing process unbeknownst to my colleagues inspired by Gabriel's purposeful ineptitude. Needed a few things you imparted to me before I vomited on you. Ergo, I created a modicum of Phooey for a focal blue it.\n\nRosita Espinosa: [She turns to walk away, forgiving him for his betrayal, then stops, looks at him, then punches him across the jaw for having puked on her] It's for the puke.\n\n[She walks away]\n\nEugene Porter: [Agreeing and accepting] Very ploy.\n\nRick Grimes: [to an unconscious Carl, who is lying in bed, recovering after having his right eye being shot out] I was wrong. I thought after living behind these walls for so long that... maybe they couldn't learn. But today, I saw what they could do, what 'we' could do. If we work together, we'll rebuild the walls. We'll expand the walls. There'll be more, there's got to be more. Everything Deanna was talking about... is possible. It's all possible, I see that now. When I was out there... with them... when it was over... when I knew we had this place again, I had this feeling... it took me a while to remember what it was...\n\n[Rick begins to cry a little]\n\nRick Grimes: ... because I hadn't felt it since before I woke up in that hospital.\n\n[Crying even more]\n\nRick Grimes: I wanna show you the new world, Carl. I want to make it a reality for you. Please, Carl... let me show you.\n\n[Carl's hand hold's onto Rick's]\n\nCarol Peletier: [to Daryl, as they all sit around a campfire with T-Dog keeping watch and Rick patrolling the area] We're not safe with him. Keeping something like that from us. Why do you need him? He's just gonna pull you down.\n\nDaryl Dixon: Nah. Rick's done all right by me.\n\nCarol Peletier: You're his henchman... and I'm a burden. We deserve better.\n\nDaryl Dixon: What do you want?\n\nCarol Peletier: A man of honor.\n\nDaryl Dixon: Rick has honor.\n\nMaggie Greene: [to Glenn after hearing Carol] I think we should take our chances.\n\nHershel Greene: Don't be foolish. There's no food, no fuel, no ammo.\n\nBeth Greene: [Hearing a sound nearby] What was that?\n\nDaryl Dixon: [as they all stand up] Could be anything. A raccoon, a possum...\n\nGlenn Rhee: ...A walker.\n\nCarol Peletier: We need to leave. I mean, what are we waiting for?\n\nTheodore 'T-Dog' Douglas: Which way?\n\nMaggie Greene: It came from over there.\n\nBeth Greene: Back from where we came.\n\nMaggie Greene: Yeah.\n\nRick Grimes: The last thing we need is for everyone to go running off in the dark. We don't have the vehicles. No one's traveling on foot.\n\nHershel Greene: Don't panic.\n\nMaggie Greene: I'm not. I'm not sitting here waiting for another herd to blow through. We need to move now.\n\nRick Grimes: No one's going anywhere.\n\n[Everyone begins to stare at Rick, silently questioning him]\n\nCarol Peletier: Do something.\n\nRick Grimes: I AM DOING SOMETHING! I'm keeping this group together, ALIVE! I've been doing that all along, no matter what! I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS! I KILLED MY BEST FRIEND FOR YOU PEOPLE, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!\n\n[They all stare at him in disbelief and shock]\n\nRick Grimes: You saw what he was like... how he pushed me... how he compromised us... how he threatened us. He staged the whole Randall thing, led me out to put a bullet in my back. He gave me no CHOICE! He was my friend, but he came after me.\n\n[Carl hugs Lori and begins crying into her shoulder]\n\nRick Grimes: My hands are clean.\n\n[They still stand there in shock and disbelief]\n\nRick Grimes: Maybe you people are better off without me. Go ahead... I say there's a place for us, but maybe, maybe it's just another pipe dream. May... Maybe I'm fooling myself again. What? Why don't... Why don't you go on and find out yourself! Send me a postcard!\n\n[Nobody does or says anything]\n\nRick Grimes: Go on, there's the door. Think you can do better? Let's see how far you get.\n\n[They continue to remain silent]\n\nRick Grimes: No takers? Fine. We get one thing straight: You're staying. This isn't a democracy anymore.\n\n[He walks off to continue patrolling the area, as everyone stands there, still in silence as the camera pans over the trees and focuses on the prison off in the distance]\n\nSam Anderson: [Carol is in the stealing their guns back and is surprised by Sam] What are you doing?\n\nCarol Peletier: [Doesn't respond at first] Sam, what are you doing here?\n\nSam Anderson: Followed you. Was hoping you were going to make more cookies, but then, you came here.\n\nCarol Peletier: Well, I could make more. I could make a whole batch just for you. Would you like that?\n\nSam Anderson: Yes. I mean, yes, please.\n\nCarol Peletier: Okay. But you gotta promise me you can keep it secret that I came here.\n\nSam Anderson: But I have to tell my Mom. I mean, I tell my Mom everything.\n\nCarol Peletier: You can never tell anyone, especially your Mom because if you do, one morning, you'll wake up and you won't be in your bed.\n\n[She begins advancing towards Sam, intimidating him, until she is standing over him]\n\nSam Anderson: Where will I be?\n\nCarol Peletier: You'll be outside the walls, far, far away, tied to a tree. And you'll scream and scream because you will be so afraid. No one will come to help because no one will hear you. But something will hear you. The monsters will come once out there and you won't be able to run away when they come for you. And they will tear you apart and eat you up all while you're still alive, all while you can still feel it. And then afterwards, no one will ever know what happened to you. Or... you can promise not to tell you anyone what you saw here and then nothing will happen. And you'll get cookies... lots of cookies. I know what I think you should do.\n\n[Sam stares back at Carol the entire time, scared to death]\n\nDale Horvath: [Andrea approaches Dale about him having taken her gun away] Andrea, I'm begging you. Don't put me in this position.\n\nAndrea Harrison: I'm not going out there without my gun. I'll even say, \"Please\".\n\nDale Horvath: I'm doing this for you.\n\nAndrea Harrison: No, Dale, you're doing it for you. You need to stop. What do you think's gonna happen? I'm gonna stick it in my mouth and pull the trigger the moment you hand it to me?\n\nDale Horvath: I know you're angry at me, that much is clear. But if I hadn't done what I did... you'd be dead now.\n\nAndrea Harrison: Jenner gave us an option. I chose to stay.\n\nDale Horvath: You chose suicide.\n\nAndrea Harrison: So, what's that to you? You barely know me!\n\nDale Horvath: I know Amy's death devastated you.\n\nAndrea Harrison: Keep her out of this. This is not about Amy, this is about us. And if I decided that I had nothing left to live for, who the Hell are you to tell me otherwise? To force my hand like that?\n\nDale Horvath: [Starting to feel hurt and unappreciated] I saved your life.\n\nAndrea Harrison: No, Dale, I saved yours! You forced that on me! I didn't want your blood on my hands and that is the only reason I left that building. What did you expect? What, I'd have some kind of epiphany? Some life-affirming catharsis?\n\nDale Horvath: [Very hurt] Maybe just a little gratitude?\n\nAndrea Harrison: Gratitude? I wanted to die my way, not torn apart by drooling freaks, that was my choice. You took that away from me, Dale.\n\nDale Horvath: But-...\n\nAndrea Harrison: But you know better? All I wanted after my sister died was to get out of this endless, horrific nightmare we live everyday. I wasn't hurting anyone else. You took my choice away, Dale. And you expect... gratitude?\n\nDale Horvath: [Even more hurt] I don't know what to say.\n\nAndrea Harrison: I'm not your little girl. I'm not your wife and I'm sure as Hell not your problem. That's all there is to say.\n\n[She walks away, with Dale visibly hurt]\n\nCarol Peletier: [Approaches Carl, who is standing over Sophia's grave] You know, we'll see Sophia again in Heaven, someday.\n\n[Carl doesn't respond]\n\nCarol Peletier: She's in a better place.\n\nCarl Grimes: No, she's not. Heaven is just another lie. And if you believe it, you're an idiot.\n\n[He walks off, leaving Carol shocked and insulted]\n\nCarol Peletier: [Turns around and approaches Lori and Rick] You need to control that boy!\n\nRick Grimes: Carl? What happened?\n\nCarol Peletier: He's disrespectful.\n\nRick Grimes: Did he say something?\n\nCarol Peletier: Something cruel about Sophia!\n\nLori Grimes: We'll figure it out. It's okay.\n\nCarol Peletier: It's not okay!\n\nRick Grimes: I'll have... I'll have, I'll have a talk with him.\n\n[He walks away, going over to talk with Carl, leaving Carol and Lori]\n\nLori Grimes: See? We'll, we'll... we'll deal with it. If you can calm down, so that I can-...\n\nCarol Peletier: Don't tell me to calm down!\n\nLori Grimes: No, I, I don't-...\n\nCarol Peletier: I don't need you to patronize me! Everyone either avoids me or they treat me like I'm crazy. I lost my daughter, I didn't lose my mind!\n\n[She storms off]\n\nRick Grimes: [Rick catches up with Carl] Carl! Did you talk back to Carol?\n\nCarl Grimes: No.\n\nRick Grimes: She says you did.\n\nCarl Grimes: I said it was stupid to believe in Heaven 'cause it is.\n\nRick Grimes: Well, just think about that for a minute. She just lost her daughter, she wants to believe she's still alive in some way.\n\nCarl Grimes: But she-...\n\nRick Grimes: Don't. Don't talk, think. It's a good rule of thumb for life.\n\nCarl Grimes: Mom always wants you to talk more.\n\nRick Grimes: Don't change the subject, you owe Carol an apology. You made a mistake. Fix it.\n\nCarl Grimes: Is that why you're gonna kill that guy? Fixing your mistake?\n\nRick Grimes: That's different.\n\nCarl Grimes: How are you gonna do it? Are you gonna hang him in the barn?\n\nRick Grimes: You just think about how you're gonna make things right with Carol. Don't talk. Think.\n\nAndrea Harrison: [Standing in the kitchen with Lori, listening to Maggie and Beth argue over Beth's wanting to commit suicide] Where's Hershel?\n\nLori Grimes: Maggie doesn't want him to find out, yet. It's a family affair, we'll let them work it out.\n\nAndrea Harrison: That's working it out?\n\nLori Grimes: When Beth stops fighting, that's when it's time to worry.\n\n[a brief silence between Lori and Andrea, as Maggie and Beth are still heard arguing upstairs]\n\nAndrea Harrison: This could've been handled better.\n\nLori Grimes: [as she is washing dishes] How so?\n\nAndrea Harrison: You shouldn't have taken the knife away.\n\nLori Grimes: [Stops washing the dishes, quietly] Excuse me?\n\nAndrea Harrison: You were wrong. Like Dale taking my gun, that wasn't your decision.\n\n[Lori silently disagrees]\n\nAndrea Harrison: She has to choose to live on her own, she has to find her own reasons.\n\nLori Grimes: [as she is putting things away] You gonna tie a noose for her?\n\nAndrea Harrison: If she's serious, she'll figure out a way.\n\nLori Grimes: Doesn't mean I can't stop her or let her know that I care.\n\nAndrea Harrison: That has nothing to do with it, Lori. She only has so many choices in front of her and she believes the best one is suicide.\n\nLori Grimes: That's not an option.\n\nAndrea Harrison: Of course it is. She doesn't need to be yelled at or... treated like a child.\n\nLori Grimes: She needs a loaded gun, right? You'll understand if I don't send you in there.\n\nAndrea Harrison: I came through it.\n\nLori Grimes: And you became such a productive member of the group. Let Maggie handle this her way.\n\nAndrea Harrison: I contribute. I help keep this place safe.\n\nLori Grimes: The men can handle this on their own, they don't need your help.\n\nAndrea Harrison: [Pissed] I'm sorry, what - what would you have me do?\n\nLori Grimes: Oh, there's plenty of work to go around.\n\nAndrea Harrison: Are you serious? Everything falls apart and you're in my face over skipping laundry?\n\nLori Grimes: It puts a burden on the rest of us, on me and Carol and... Patricia and Maggie, cooking and cleaning and caring for Beth, and you... don't care about anyone, but yourself. You sit up on that RV working on your tan with a shotgun in your lap.\n\nAndrea Harrison: [a little angrier] I am on watch against walkers, that is what matters, not fresh mint leaves in the lemonade!\n\nLori Grimes: We are providing stability, we are trying to create a life worth living!\n\nAndrea Harrison: Are you kidding me?\n\nLori Grimes: Look, I, I went after Rick, I took down two walkers-...\n\nAndrea Harrison: [Speaking over Lori] - -And crashing Maggie's car. Ever apologize for that?\n\nLori Grimes: Crashing her... you're insane.\n\nAndrea Harrison: No, you are and you're the one who's self-centered, the way you take it all for granted!\n\nLori Grimes: My husband is out there for the hundredth time, my son was shot! Don't you dare tell me that I take this for granted!\n\nAndrea Harrison: You don't get it, do you? Your husband came back from the dead, your son, too, and now, you got a baby on the way! The rest of us have piled up our losses, me, Carol, Beth. But you just keep on keepin' on.\n\nLori Grimes: We all have suffered.\n\nAndrea Harrison: Playing house, acting like the Queen Bee, laying down rules for everybody, but yourself. You know what? Go ahead! Go in there and tell that little girl that everything's gonna be okay just like it is for you! She'll get a husband, a son, baby... boyfriend.\n\n[Lori looks at Andrea, severely pissed]\n\nAndrea Harrison: She just has to look on the bright side.\n\n[Andrea walks away, severely pissed off]\n\nMichonne: Listen, I'm just being honest. I thought it was a bit... pedestrian.\n\nTerry: [laughs] Pedestrian?\n\nMichonne: As in lame and... played.\n\nTerry: Played? Where have you seen anything like it before? Tell me that.\n\nMichonne: I've never seen a gorilla drive a car before. But if you put it in a museum, I'm not gonna call it art.\n\nTerry: [laughing] Mike, would you, would you, please, talk some sense into your lover?\n\nMichonne: [laughing] Oh, my God! You did not just call me that!\n\nMike: I agree with my lover. I mean the whole thing was-...\n\nMichonne: - Very lame...\n\nMike: [laughing] ... and very played.\n\nTerry: Oh. Wait, wait wait. No, no. Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't start... finishing each other's sentences, man. This is, this is just gross.\n\nMike: I was going to say that the... the whole thing was like a monument to someone trying to damn hard to be different\n\n[Michonne has finished cutting up sushi and vegetables with a regular vegetable knife; as she cleans wipes of the knife, the knife turns into her kitanna sword, but Michonne doesn't notice the sudden difference]\n\nMichonne: Hallelujah! Listen, I'm glad I saw it even though I did not love it.\n\n[She puts the kitanna sword back into the knife rack, as her 2-year-old son, Andre Anthony, comes into the kitchen]\n\nMichonne: I hope we're not boring you, peanut. Come here.\n\n[She picks up Andre and walks over to Mike and Terry, bringing in the sushi and vegetable plate; as soon as she places the plate in front of Mike and Terry, Mike and Terry's clothes have gone from Business Casual to dirty and raggedy, while their expressions and conversation changes, as well]\n\nTerry: I don't think we should stay at the camp.\n\nMike: No. I'm not taking my son out there. I don't know if this place will work out, but I know it won't if we go out there. That doesn't even matter anymore. I was just kidding ourselves.\n\nMichonne: [Michonne remains in a happy attitude, not grasping the sudden changes in their conversation] Okay. Alright. I see what this is.\n\nTerry: Really? What is \"this\", Michonne? I mean, you got good with a sword. You know how valuable that is now? You know what that makes you?\n\nMike: What? What are we going for? Where's the happy ending here? This isn't life. Anything close, okay? Not for me, not for us. If not for our son, what, what's the answer here?\n\nTerry: Well, what is the damn question, Mike?\n\nMike: Why?\n\nMichonne: [Smiling and laughing] Okay. Looks good. Now, I have a question. Who's gonna open the wine?\n\n[as she pushes the sushi and vegetable plate closer to Mike and Terry, she looks up and sees Mike and Terry are dead and missing their arms, revealing that Mike and Terry's reanimated bodies were Michonne's two original Walker pets, she also notices that Andre is no longer in arms, and also this also reveals that this whole sequence is a nightmare]\n\nMichonne: No. No! No! No! No! Noooo! Noooo!\n\nRick Grimes: [Cocks gun] We're not leaving.\n\nHershel Greene: We can't stay here.\n\nMaggie Greene: What if there's another snaprel? Wood pallet won't stop another one of those rounds.\n\nBeth Greene: We can't even go outside.\n\nCarol Peletier: Within the daylight.\n\nGlenn Rhee: If Rick says we're not running, we're not running!\n\nMerle Dixon: [Locked behind a cell] No? Better to live like rats.\n\nRick Grimes: You got a better idea?\n\nMerle Dixon: Yeah, we should've slid outta here last night, live to fight another day. But we lost that window, didn't we? Now, I'm sure he's got scouts on every road out of this place by now.\n\nDaryl Dixon: We ain't scared of that prick.\n\nMerle Dixon: Y'all should be. That truck-through-the-fence thing? That's just him ringing the doorbell. We might have some thick walls to hide behind, but he's got the guns and the numbers. And if he takes the high ground around this place, shoot, he could just starve us out if he wanted to.\n\nMaggie Greene: Let's put him in the other cell block!\n\nDaryl Dixon: No. He's gotta point.\n\nMaggie Greene: [to Merle] THIS IS ALL YOU! YOU STARTED THIS!\n\nBeth Greene: What's the difference whose fault it is? What do we do?\n\nHershel Greene: I said we should leave. Now, Axel's dead. We can't just sit here.\n\n[Rick turns to leave the cell block, walking out on the conversation]\n\nHershel Greene: GET BACK HERE!\n\n[Rick stops in his tracks, as Hershel, on his crutches, walks over to Rick]\n\nHershel Greene: You're slipping, Rick. We've all seen it, we understand why. But now is not the time! You once said this isn't a democracy. Now you have to own up to that. I put my family's life in your hands. So, get your head clear and do something.\n\nRick Grimes: [Opening the door to a loading dock and looks out; Carl then comes out] You shouldn't be out here.\n\nCarl Grimes: I'm a good shot.\n\nRick Grimes: Yes, you are.\n\nCarl Grimes: Hey, Dad?\n\nRick Grimes: Yeah?\n\nCarl Grimes: If I say something, will you promise not to be mad?\n\nRick Grimes: I won't get mad.\n\nCarl Grimes: You should stop.\n\nRick Grimes: Stop what?\n\nCarl Grimes: Being the leader.\n\n[Rick turns to look at him]\n\nCarl Grimes: Have Hershel and Daryl handle things. You deserve a rest.\n\n[He continues to look at Carl, as Carl walks away]\n\nRick Grimes: [Hugging Lori] What happened to you?\n\nLori Grimes: I was in a car accident.\n\nRick Grimes: Accident? How?\n\nLori Grimes: I went looking for you.\n\nShane Walsh: Snuck out on her own. I brought her back.\n\nRick Grimes: Are you crazy? You could-...\n\nTheodore 'T-Dog' Douglas: Who the Hell is that?\n\n[Seeing Randall in the backseat of the car, tied up and blindfolded]\n\nGlenn Rhee: That's Randall.\n\nRick Grimes: [Back inside the house] We couldn't just leave him behind. He would've bled out... if he lived that long.\n\nGlenn Rhee: It's gotten bad in town.\n\nAndrea Harrison: What do we do with him?\n\nHershel Greene: I repaired his calf muscle as best I can, but he'll probably have nerve damage. He won't be on his feet for, at least, a week.\n\nRick Grimes: When he is, we give him a canteen, take him out to the main roads, send him on his way.\n\nAndrea Harrison: Isn't that the same as leaving him for the walkers?\n\nRick Grimes: He'll have a fighting chance.\n\nShane Walsh: Just gonna let him go? He knows where we are.\n\nRick Grimes: He was blindfolded the whole way here. He's not a threat.\n\nShane Walsh: Not a threat. How many more of them were there? You killed 3 of there men, you took one of them hostage, but they just ain't gonna come looking for him.\n\nRick Grimes: They left him for dead! No one is looking!\n\nTheodore 'T-Dog' Douglas: We should still post a guard.\n\nHershel Greene: He's out cold right now. Will be for hours.\n\nShane Walsh: [Sarcastically] You know, I'm gonna get him some flowers and candy.\n\n[He starts to walk away]\n\nShane Walsh: Look at this folks, we're back in Fantasy Land!\n\n[Continues walking away]\n\nHershel Greene: You know, we haven't even dealt with what you did at my barn, yet! Let me make this perfectly clear once and for all. This is my farm and I wanted you gone. Rick talked me out of it, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. So, do us both a favor: Keep your mouth shut!\n\n[Shane walks away, storms out the front door]\n\nRick Grimes: [to Hershel] Look, we're not gonna do anything about today. Let's just cool off.\n\nRosita Espinosa: [Frustrated, Abraham walks back over to the group and violently grabs Eugene by the arm and forcefully walks back to the truck, trying to get their mission on track] Abraham!\n\nGlenn Rhee: Hey!\n\nRosita Espinosa: What are you doing! Stop!\n\nGlenn Rhee: Let go of him!\n\nRosita Espinosa: I'm not gonna let you do this!\n\nSgt. Abraham Ford: [Continuing to walk] Yes, you are.\n\nTara Chambler: [Stepping in front of Abraham, trying to stop him] Hey! Hey!\n\n[He pushes Tara away]\n\nGlenn Rhee: [Runs over to Abraham, and tries to stop him the same way] YOU'RE DONE!\n\nSgt. Abraham Ford: [while still gripping onto Eugene's arm with one hand, he fights off Glenn with his other hand] DO NOT! DO NOT! I TOLD YOU! YOU DO NOT TOUCH ME!\n\n[They continue to shout at Abraham as he knocks down both Glenn and Rosita; Glenn gets back and continues to verbally and physically fight with Abraham]\n\nEugene Porter: I'M NOT A SCIENTIST! I'M NOT A SCIENTIST!\n\n[Everyone goes silent in severe shock over Eugene's statement]\n\nEugene Porter: I lied! I'm not a scientist.\n\n[Everyone stands around, shocked]\n\nEugene Porter: I don't know how to stop it! I'm not a scientist.\n\n[Abraham begins to fall into a depression; Eugene continues to stand there with everyone silently judging him]\n\nRosita Espinosa: [Finally making it back up to her feet] You are a scientists. I've seen the things that you can do.\n\nEugene Porter: I just know things.\n\nGlenn Rhee: You just know things?\n\nEugene Porter: I know I'm smarter than most people. I know I'm a very good liar and I know I needed to get to D.C.\n\nMaggie Greene: Why?\n\nEugene Porter: Because I do believe that locale holds the strongest possibility for survival. And I wanted to survive. If I could cheat some people into taking me there, well, I'd just reason them, and I'd be doing them a solid, too, considering the perilous state of the city of Houston, and the state of everything.\n\n[Abraham, feeling even worse, crouches down to the ground, trying to wrap his around everything]\n\nRosita Espinosa: [Crushed] People died trying to get you here.\n\nEugene Porter: I'm aware of that. Stephanie, Warren, Pam, Rex, Roger, Josiah, Dirk, and Josephine. And Bob. You see, I lost my nerve as we grew closer for I'm a coward and the reality of getting to our destination and disclosing the truth of the matter became a truly frightening shit. I took it upon myself to slow our role... find time to finesse things, so then when we got there... but at this moment, I fully realize there are no longer any agreeable options. I was screwed either way. I also lied about T. Brooks Ellis liking my hair. I do not know a T. Brooks Ellis. I did read one of his books and he seemed like the type of guy that wouldn't blink twice at a Tennessee Top Hat.\n\n[Turning to Abraham]\n\nEugene Porter: Again, I am smarter than you and you may want to leave me here - -\n\n[Abraham jumps to his feet and violently punches Eugene, twice, in the face]\n\nTara Chambler: [Tara and Glenn grab Abraham as best they can to pull him off of Eugene] Hey! Hey! Hey!\n\nGlenn Rhee: COME ON!\n\nTara Chambler: GET OFF OF HIM!\n\n[Abraham violently breaks Glenn and Tara's grips and punches Eugene in the face a third time, knocking Eugene out completely, leaving Eugene to fall to the ground, and bang his head onto the concrete]\n\nGlenn Rhee: [Abraham tries to advance on Eugene again] Don't.\n\n[Rosita steps right in front of Abraham, with her hand on her gun; Abraham, processing what went down, looks at his bloodied hand, then walks past the group, and falls to his knees]\n\nMaggie Greene: [Tending to Eugene] Oh, my God.\n\nTara Chambler: God. Eugene, are you there? Eugene!\n\nRick Grimes: [while sitting in their squad car, eating burgers and fries together] What's the difference between men and women?\n\nShane Walsh: This a joke?\n\nRick Grimes: No. Serious.\n\nShane Walsh: Never met a woman who knew how to turn off a light. Born thinking the switch only goes one way: on. They're struck blind the second they leave the room. I mean, every woman I ever let have a key, I swear to God, it's like... come home, house all lit up. And my job is, apparently, because... because my chromosomes happen to be different, 'cause I gotta walk through that house, turn off every single light this chick left on.\n\nRick Grimes: Is that right?\n\nShane Walsh: Yeah, baby, mmm. Oh, Reverend Shane's a-preachin' to ya now, boy.\n\n[They laugh]\n\nShane Walsh: Then, this same chick, mind ya, she'll bitch about Global Warming. See this...\n\n[Shane laughs]\n\nShane Walsh: This is when Reverend Shane wants to quote from the \"Guy\" gospel and say, \"Um, Darlin', maybe you and every other pair of boobs on this planet just figure out that the light switch, see, goes both ways, maybe we wouldn't have so much Global Warming\".\n\nRick Grimes: You say that?\n\nShane Walsh: Well, a, uh, polite version.\n\n[laughs]\n\nShane Walsh: Still, man, that, that earns me this, this look of loathing you would not believe. And that's when \"The Exorcist\" voice pops out: \"YOU SOUND JUST LIKE MY DAMN FATHER ALWAYS, ALWAYS YELLING ABOUT THE POWER BILL, TELLING ME TO TURN OFF THE DAMN LIGHTS!\"\n\nRick Grimes: And what do you say to that?\n\nShane Walsh: Know what I want to say. I want to say, \"Bitch, you mean to tell me you've been hearing this your entire life and you are too damn stupid to learn how to turn off the switch?\"\n\n[Shane and Rick laugh more]\n\nShane Walsh: You know I...\n\n[They continue laughing]\n\nShane Walsh: ... I don't actually say that, though.\n\nRick Grimes: [Still laughing] That would be bad.\n\nShane Walsh: Yeah. Yeah. I'd go with the, uh, go with the polite version there, too.\n\nRick Grimes: Very wise!\n\nShane Walsh: Yes, sir.\n\n[laughs]\n\nRick Grimes: Mm-hmm.\n\nShane Walsh: [Few moments of silence] So, how's it with Lori, man?\n\nRick Grimes: She's good. She's good at turning off lights. Really good. I'm the one who, sometimes, forgets.\n\nShane Walsh: What a man.\n\nRick Grimes: We didn't have a great night.\n\nShane Walsh: Hey, look, man, I may have, uh, a phantom muse with mu sermon, but I did try. Least you could do is speak.\n\nRick Grimes: That's, that's what she always says. \"Speak\". \"Speak\". Think I was the most closed-mouth son-of-bitch ever to hear her talk.\n\nShane Walsh: Do you express your thoughts? Do you share your feelings? That kind of stuff?\n\nRick Grimes: Thing is... lately, whenever I try, everything I say makes her... impatient, like she didn't want to hear it after all. It's like she's... pissed at me all the time and I don't know why.\n\nShane Walsh: Look, man, that's just shit that couples' go through. Yeah, it's a, it's a phase.\n\nRick Grimes: [laughs a little] Last thing she said this morning: \"Sometimes, I wonder if you even care about us at all\". She said that in front of our kid. Imagine going to school with that in your head. The difference between men and women? I would never say something that cruel to her and certainly not in front of Carl.\n\nMichonne: [after Rick opens the door to find Milton lying on the floor, dead, and Andrea propped up against the wall] Andrea!\n\n[Michonne runs over to Andrea]\n\nAndrea Harrison: [They enter the room] I tried to stop him.\n\nMichonne: You're burning up.\n\nAndrea Harrison: [She pulls her coat back to reveal a bloody Walker bite, with Rick visibly upset] Judith, Carl, the rest of them...\n\nRick Grimes: Us. The rest... of us.\n\nAndrea Harrison: Are they alive?\n\nRick Grimes: Yeah. They're alive.\n\nAndrea Harrison: [Looks to Michonne] It's good you found them.\n\n[Michonne nods in agreement, while crying]\n\nAndrea Harrison: No one can make it alone now.\n\nDaryl Dixon: They never could.\n\nAndrea Harrison: [to Rick] I just didn't want anyone to die.\n\n[Sitting up a little]\n\nAndrea Harrison: I can do it myself.\n\nMichonne: No!\n\nAndrea Harrison: I have to... while I still can.\n\n[Turns back to Rick]\n\nAndrea Harrison: Please.\n\n[Rick is saddened]\n\nAndrea Harrison: I know how the safety works.\n\n[He hands Andrea his gun, respecting her wishes]\n\nMichonne: Well, I'm not going anywhere.\n\nAndrea Harrison: [Looks up at Daryl, with Daryl, also, visibly saddened, then looks back at Rick] I tried.\n\nRick Grimes: Yeah, you did. You did.\n\n[Rick and Daryl leave the room, leaving Andrea the privacy she needs, as Michonne sits with Andrea during her final moments; Rick, Daryl, and Tyreese are outside the door, saddened as the gun goes off, ending Andrea's life]\n\nEugene Porter: [Entering a factory, with Rosita putting her backpack on a table and taking out the supplies needed to make a bullet] I didn't want to come back here. I don't...\n\n[Rosita continues to taking the supplies out of her backpack]\n\nEugene Porter: No.\n\nRosita Espinosa: I asked you to make me a bullet. You said, \"Yes\". So, make me a bullet.\n\nEugene Porter: You're right, I said, \"Yes\". But that... was a peak heat of the moment. I... in the intervening hours, I've been taking a deep dive into other options and contingencies, trying to game out any iteration in which charging into this enterprise makes any sense. I'm not trying to fin it or to stop you. Just maybe slow your roll. Maybe going for some lolling false sense of security wise-...\n\nRosita Espinosa: I'm not waiting, Eugene!\n\nEugene Porter: That's just being stupid.\n\nRosita Espinosa: Then, Hell, you don't know what the Hell you're talking about!\n\nEugene Porter: I think I do. I've analyzed this top to bottom. Doesn't matter if you're stealthy, snappy gun or knifey. Abraham was right, they have the numbers. It's ballgame, unless we put together a finishing move for a force of many along with the man in charge. A single bullet ain't gonna do it. Best-case, maybe you take him out.\n\nRosita Espinosa: Then make me a bullet!\n\nEugene Porter: Somebody has to pay the price. Even if you're willing, from all we've seen, it's not a lock you'll be the one.\n\nRosita Espinosa: Will the man who killed the man who saved our lives die?\n\nEugene Porter: Maybe.\n\nRosita Espinosa: Then make me a bullet! You're not talking me out of this, Eugene! You owe me and you owe him! If there's a price, I'll pay it. But don't you tell me, \"No\"! You don't know anything, you don't do anything! You're a coward and you're weak.\n\n[Eugene begins to tear up]\n\nRosita Espinosa: The only reason you're alive is because you lied and because people feel sorry for you! So, for once... do something useful... and make me a bullet.\n\n[He walks over to the table and gets started on making a bullet for Rosita]"
