Lilya 4-ever (2002) Language: Swedish-Danish Synopsis Sixteen-year-old Lilya lives in a poor and dreary suburb somewhere in the former Soviet Union. Her mother has moved to the States with a new man and Lilya is waiting to be sent for. When no letters or money arrive from her mother, it becomes obvious that Lilya has been abandoned. She is forced to move into a tiny, run-down flat with no electricity or heating. Heartbroken and with no money, Lilya's situation becomes desperate. Her only friend is eleven-year-old Volodya, who is sometimes allowed to sleep on her sofa. They hang out together, dreaming of a better life. Hope arrives when Lilya falls in love with Andrei. He asks her to follow him to Sweden to start a new life. Little Volodya is jealous and suspicious, but Lilya packs her things. Suddenly, she's sitting on a plane bound for Sweden, not knowing what will happen next...
