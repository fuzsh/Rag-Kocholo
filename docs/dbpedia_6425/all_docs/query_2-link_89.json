        "text": "Well, chicos y chicas, the time has come to swing open the corral gate and let this pony go. I've got a couple films I'm trying to usher into production as well as the pointed elbows of another script idea poking me with annoying persistence. I'm afraid it is time to move on.\n\nI've greatly enjoyed writing the Delirious blog and I'm sad to see it end. Through these ramblings I have met an astonishing number of remarkable people. My greatest delight has been in hearing your thoughts and sharing my own with you. Your genuine curiosity, support, honesty and encouragement have been amazing; and they've been invaluable to me.\n\nI have to thank Chioke Nassor for forcing me to write the blog in the first place. Chioke was a complete stranger until he came up to me with a gun at a screening of the film and introduced himself. In addition to suggesting the blog as a way to promote the film, Chioke came up with the concept of the videoskits. I helped him write some of them but he produced, directed and edited them entirely on his own. I'm enormously proud of his accomplishment, particularly the Gina Gershon Sex tape which has now received over 145,000 hits on YouTube.\n\nTo Mona from The Illustrious Steve Buscemi: you offered brisk, slap-in-the-face advice right from the beginning that woke me up to the artistic obligations of blogging like a brisk slap in the face. Not to mention the long hours we spent via email one night as you helped me solve an excruciating computer problem. Thank you so much for your humor, patience and support.\n\nTo Chris W, the very first commenter on the blog: your efforts to try and get Delirious onto your local screen are heroic. My sincere gratitude and admiration.\n\nTo Michele V. aka SpaceBaby; you are a wonder. All the help you gave by sending Delirious fliers to your contact lists was extraordinary. No less invaluable to me was the straight out, straight up sincerity of your faith and encouragement. Bless you. You introduced me to the indomitable Alex Green who lead me through an exciting and detailed interview for his website, Caught In The Carousel. Thanks for the helping hand, Alex. It's been great sharing music and ideas with you.\n\nTo Will Crewdson; what a treat to have met you. I still can't believe you called the UK distributor on my behalf to question them about the DVD release. You are clearly an extremely gifted musician and I know we're going to be hearing more from you. The UK distributor plans a DVD-only release sometime in February.\n\nTo David Aaron; I know you're in a tough position being an investor in Gestation but your clear, straightforward interest in the chain of events was very much appreciated. Same goes for my friend Rite as well as UpperWestSide Guy and his wife Olive. Thank you.\n\nTo David Edelburg: you wrote a letter to a snarky critic on behalf of the film earning my sincere gratitude and admiration.\n\nTo Kevin Avery and to Rick at Filmlinker: you both were incredibly generous in drawing attention to the blog on your own sites. I thank you and I wish you both the best. Keep up the good work. I extend the same gratitude to Kunal Gulati and Sujewa Ekanayake for also sharing this blog with their own readers.\n\nTo Sarah, Damien, Jessica, Victor M in Spain, Harald and his wife in Zurich, the writer Andy Zeffer, the mysterious Skippy Michaels, Nick Detisch and his twin filmmaking brother, Em See Jay in London, Mark TK and Dave Brandler: it has been a real pleasure hearing from you all and getting to know you a little bit.\n\nPost Parting Thoughts\n\nLet me take a moment here and clear up a few, shall we say, exaggerations. Hugh Hefner did screen, and enjoy, Delirious at the Playboy Mansion but, sadly I was not there. I am astounded at the number of people who actually thought I was. It shows either the enormous power of my writing or the enormous willingness of the population to believe utter silliness; either way it may prompt me to start my own religion, write my own Holy Babble and instruct the masses to send me enormous checks every week.\n\nCome on now, people! Did you really think I was sitting in the Grotto with Hugh Hefner wearing a fluorescent orange thong, getting stoned and watching Kevin Costner's toupee float by!? Fer christ's sake!\n\nAlso, I am NOT on medication. I should be, but I'm not. The need to address this misconception comes after meeting a friend on the street who's been reading the blog. \"So, are the pills from Dr. Owen helping?\" he asked with such sincere, infuriating sympathy I wanted to punch him. There is no Dr. Owen, you idiot. And if there was there is nothing he could prescribe that would help me. The best medication for me right now is to get another movie going but if anyone has any liquid Demerol/Valium please send it along.\n\nTo my friends at Gestation. Six years is a long time to work on a film. In that time a gigantic reservoir of energy built up; a huge roiling mass of hopes, dreams and expectations born of exhaustingly hard work. Not finding a release in theaters this energy had to go somewhere. I'm sorry if the fictitious form it found in this blog offended you. It was either that or homicide.\n\nTo Michael Pitt, real or otherwise. Your performance in Delirious is amazing. I had nothing to do with it of course; everyone knows I was asleep on the sidewalk during all of your scenes. But, I'm sorry you took offense at the video skit we did poking some good-natured fun at the whole publicity thang. If anyone was demeaned in any of the skits it was ME. You may notice I'm on my knees in every single one of them, begging, conniving, lying and betraying every principle I've ever had in a frantic effort to keep the film alive. I come off as a desperate dickwad and the comments are there on YouTube to prove it. And once again, I must thank Chioke Nassor for tricking me into doing this.\n\nTo Steve Buscemi and Gina Gershon. Thank you both for your willingness and generosity in doing the skits with us. I had a blast with you. Doing the videos kept me from going completely insane. Watching them now I have only more respect and admiration for your talent.\n\nI will be writing more posts every now and then so please do keep checking in. I just won't be able to do it as regularly as I have been. They don't tell you keeping a blog is a full-time job. I'm exhausted.\n\nI guess I did get a little kkkccrrazscy in these pages. But really, was I any more crazy than my fantasy friends at Gestation who cut off all communication just as the film was being released? How sane is excommunication? Some postulate it is the most destructive thing human beings can do to each other with the sole exception of murder. Just look at the great use the Catholic Church has made of it.\n\nI hold no grudges. All I ever wanted was for people to see the film and for Gestation to make money. I'm sorry it didn't work out. But I will say this: fighting for something you believe in is never wrong. I will never stop doing it.\n\nRULE #1: Just because someone has all the money doesn't make them right.\n\nRULE #2: Just because someone has the power to force their decisions on you doesn't make them right.\n\nRULE#3: The film business is not just about business.\n\nIf it was there would never be films like La Strada, Midnight Cowboy, The Seven Samurai, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Mulholland Drive, The Sweet Smell Of Success, The Graduate, Gosford Park, Sunset Boulevard, Breathless, Bonnie and Clyde, The 400 Blows, Badlands, The Conformist, The Asphalt Jungle, Psycho, A Place In The Sun, Dog Day Afternoon, Key Largo, Night of The Hunter, Drugstore Cowboy, Mean Streets, Stranger Than Paradise, La Dolce Vita, Two Lane Blacktop, Double Indemnity, Sex Lies and Videotape, Do The Right Thing, Husbands and Wives, Faster Pussycat Kill Kill, The Wedding Banquet, Lilya 4-Ever, Belle du Jour, Little Big Man, The Thin Red Line, Rashomon, Secrets and Lies, A Hard Day's Night, Touch of Evil, The Conversation, Boys Don't Cry, Bob le Flambeur, Fargo, Salaam Bombay, Wild Strawberries, Dr. Strangelove, Aguirre The Wrath of God ..."
