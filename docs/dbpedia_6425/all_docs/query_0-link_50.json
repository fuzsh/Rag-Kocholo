        "text": "Swedish director Lukas Moodysson will begin principal photography on his first English-language film, “Mammoth” this October. Moodysson’s previous films, “Fucking Amal,” “Together,” and “Lilya 4-ever” have all received international acclaim and won numerous awards.\n\n“Mammoth” will revolve around a successful New York couple, their daughter, and their Filipino nanny. “I’m really looking forward to directing a film in English,” commented Moodysson in a statement. “After two quite experimental films, I’m excited to return to a more narrative style. I want it to be a movie that will reach out and touch audiences everywhere.”"
