        "text": "(Edward Yang’s YI YI, 2000)\n\nOctober 12, AUSTIN, TX— The Austin Film Society announces its calendar for November/December of 2023 featuring signature programs, special screenings and events, and a new, diverse lineup of films from around the globe that filmgoers can only see at the AFS Cinema. The full calendar and more information can be found at www.austinfilm.org.\n\nThe upcoming programming calendar includes a new series of AFS Essential Cinema called The Original Indies: The Birth Of American Independent Cinema, featuring six films throughout November and December. The series will highlight works that laid the foundation for the indie scene as we know it today, including Shadows by John Cassavetes. As a finale to October’s Essential Cinema program surveying the Berlin School, AFS will also show a sneak preview of Music on November 5, Angela Schanelec’s latest film. International guests join AFS for New French Cinema Week November 9–12, the annual festival of new Francophone voices, a co-presentation with the Premiers Plans Festival of Angers, France. French-Algerian filmmaker Rachid Hami joins audiences for the opening-night presentation of his feature For My Country, while Sundance-selected Réunionaise director Vincent Fontano will attend New French Shorts for the presentation of his film Sèt Lam. AFS’s Home for the Holidays series is back at the end of December, featuring holiday favorites like The Thin Man alongside unexpected classics including Lukas Moodysson’s Together and Edward Yang’s Yi Yi. As a part of Queer Cinema: Lost & Found, guest programmer Elizabeth Purchell has selected My Dearest Señorita, one of the earliest films to explore intersexuality, and Wakefield Poole’s Bible!, which re-interprets several old testament stories. For its 10th anniversary, AFS Cinema will be showing the made-in-Austin comedy Zero Charisma on December 2 followed by a panel with the film’s cast. Over the next two months, AFS Cinema will screen ten new documentaries, seven of which are part of its Doc Nights series and include many musical figures such as Robert Fripp, Joan Baez and Pauline Oliveros. The calendar’s documentary programming also includes the local premiere of Breaking the News on November 1, an AFS-supported project co-presented by local news organization the 19th* — who the film is about — followed by a live and simulcast Q&A with members of the 19th* and the film’s crew. AFS will also be kicking off another series of films with PBS Independent Lens beginning with A Town Called Victoria on November 19, which will be followed by a post-screening panel. And as part of the Texas Book Festival, AFS Cinema will also be showing Story and Pictures By, which dives into the world of children’s books.\n\nCalendar highlights in detail:\n\nAFS’s Essential Cinema series for November and December, The Original Indies: The Birth of American Independent Cinema, spotlights the first generation of films that paved the way for many contemporary filmmakers. Not only were these films produced outside of the studio system, but they also showed an independence from the filmmaking conventions of the era. The series begins on November 13 with a 35mm screening of Shadows by John Cassavetes, considered by many to be the first American indie. Following this will be Little Fugitive, beloved by François Truffaut and Wes Anderson; The Connection, directed by Shirley Clarke (who played herself in the film Lion’s Love); The Savage Eye in 35mm; the verité drama The Exiles and Herschell Gordon Lewis’ ludicrous, gorey and highly successful Blood Feast.\n\nFrom November 9–12, AFS will present New French Cinema Week, which is a co-presentation with the Premiers Plans Festival of Angers, France. This annual event gives Austin audiences opportunities to see acclaimed international films made by emerging artists from throughout the Francophone world. This year’s opening-night reception will take place before the screening of For My Country, the story of a family losing a son to war, with director Rachid Hami in person for a post-screening Q&A. The other films include Cannes Caméra d’Or winner Léonor Serraille’s Mother and Son; Junkyard Dog by Jean-Baptiste Durand who will take part in a live virtual Q&A, which will be paired with Garance Kim’s short film Eternal City; from Cannes 2022, Emmanuelle Nicot’s tale of familial abuse and recovery, Love According to Dalva; Four Daughters, a film about the separation of a Tunisian family that won Best Documentary at Cannes; and a showcase of New French Shorts that includes Bye Bye, winner of the César Award for Best Short Film, and Sèt Lam by Vincent Fontano, who will participate in an in-person Q&A on November 11. Several films in this program are part of Young French Cinema, a program of Unifrance and Villa Albertine; the festival is supported by the Embassy of France in the US and Villa Albertine.\n\nAFS Cinema will showcase a variety of brand-new documentaries as a part of its recurring Doc Nights series, many of which focus on figures from throughout musical history. Joan Baez: I Am A Noise explores the legendary folk artist’s life and her identity as a Mexican-American; In The Court Of The Crimson King: King Crimson At 50 shows founding member and guitar genius Robert Fripp get his legendary prog rock band together again; and Deep Listening: The Story Of Pauline Oliveros celebrates the life of the late Houston-born electronic-music composer through performance footage and interviews with the likes of Laurie Anderson and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth. Outside of music-based subjects, AFS will be showing the festival hit Invisible Beauty about Black high-fashion model Bethann Hardison (who also co-directed the film); Carpet Cowboys, which focuses on a small town in Georgia whose only industry is making large, bizarrely patterned carpets (executive produced by John Wilson); Lakota Nation Vs. The US, showing the heroic, decades-long struggle for indigenous control over the Black Hills of South Dakota; and King Coal by Oscar®-nominated filmmaker Elaine McMillion Sheldon, about work and life in Central Appalachia. AFS is also excited to kick off another year of its partnership with PBS Independent Lens, a documentary film series that has garnered numerous Emmys, Peabody Awards and Academy Award® nominations. First in this year’s program of five free community screenings is A Town Called Victoria, which analyzes the aftermath of a hate crime in South Texas. The film will be followed by a panel discussion including Austin City Council Member Zo Qadri as well as subjects from the film and an impact counselor from the Muslim Association for Psychological Services (MAPS).\n\nEach December, AFS brings together an eclectic mix of films that take place during or adjacent to the winter holidays. This year, the series Home for the Holidays is back with some favorites from previous years and some new selections for those who are staying in Austin during the week of December 22–31. The series brings back The Thin Man, the frivolous, boozy New York-set classic, and Stanley Kubrick’s final film, Eyes Wide Shut, starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. This year’s lineup also includes Bell, Book, and Candle, the magical comedy starring Kim Novak as a beatnik witch with Jack Lemmon playing her brother and Jimmy Stewart as her love interest; Together by Lukas Moodysson (dir. Lilya 4-ever), a film about life in a Swedish commune; Edward Yang’s Yi Yi, a cinematic touchstone about familial love; and The Hudsucker Proxy shown in 35mm, directed by the Cohen brothers, co-written by Sam Raimi, and featuring performances by Tim Robbins, Paul Newman and Jennifer Jason Leigh.\n\nAmong AFS’s many November and December screenings are special events including in-person appearances by esteemed guests and organizations. The local premiere of a new documentary about Austin-based newsroom The 19th*, Breaking The News, will be shown on November 1 followed by a Q&A with the filmmakers and members of the 19th*. The film was supported by an AFS Grant and is co-directed by Heather Courtney (dir. Where Soldiers Come From), Chelsea Hernandez (dir. Building the American Dream) and Princess A. Hairston (ed. Fresh Dressed). Preceding the Texas Book Festival on November 8, AFS will co-present Story and Pictures By, a documentary about contemporary social issues and the authors of picture books. And on December 2, AFS Cinema will host the 10-year anniversary of Zero Charisma, whose AFS-supported filmmakers, Katie Graham and Andrew Matthews, will join the cast for a panel discussion after the film.\n\nThe full November/December lineup continues below, and a complete list of all film screenings announced to date and special events are on our website at ​www.​austinfilm​.org.​ Ticket prices range from $11 to $13.50, with discounts for AFS members. Special pricing is noted if applicable.\n\nAUSTIN FILM SOCIETY NOVEMBER/DECEMBER CALENDAR\n\nDownload image stills.\n\nESSENTIAL CINEMA: THE ORIGINAL INDIES: THE BIRTH OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENT CINEMA\n\nFrom coast to coast — and even a surprise from between — we take a look at the birth of the American independent film scene as we’ve come to know it with this six-part series highlighting “the original indies.” From groundbreaking, innovative dramas and elliptical experimentations to an exploitation wellspring, these films, their stories, and their creators have come to represent the essential spirit of modern independent cinema.\n\nSHADOWS\n\nJohn Cassavetes, USA, 1959, DCP, 87 min.\n\n11/13, 11/18\n\n“Rarely has so much warmth, delicacy, and raw feeling emerged so naturally and beautifully from performances in an American film.” —Jonathan Rosenbaum\n\n“So far ahead of all Hollywood and independent films that once you’ve seen [it], you can no longer look at the official cinema: you know that American cinema can be more sensitive and intelligent.” —Jonas Mekas\n\n“What matters in SHADOWS is less the story … than the electric atmosphere and edgy performances … With a blue and moody Mingus soundtrack and steel-gray photography, the film is still a delight.”\n\n—Time Out\n\nShot for $40,000 in the apartment of John Cassavetes and on the streets of Manhattan, SHADOWS cast a light on the burgeoning independent film scene with the story of three siblings: Hugh (Hugh Hurd), a stolid, but downbeat Black jazz musician who provides economic support for the “passing;” Ben (Ben Carruthers), a struggling musician; and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), an artist who yearns for the vibrant colors of life in a world which sees only black and white. Dubbed “fitfully dynamic” by The New York Times, Cassavetes’ “incontestably sincere” revelation is the undeniable watershed moment of American Independent Cinema. In 35mm.\n\nLITTLE FUGITIVE\n\nMorris Engel, Ruth Orkin, and Ray Ashley, USA, 1953, DCP, 80 min.\n\n11/21, 11/25\n\n“A riotously funny view of humanity.”\n\n—New York News\n\n“A missing link in the history of modern cinema, a small, unexpected islet, midway between the first wave of Italian neo-realism and the future French New Wave. Between European modernity and the upcoming independent American cinema. LITTLE FUGITIVE, like OPEN CITY, like BREATHLESS, is one of these precarious films which made cinema move in a radical way.”—Cahiers du Cinéma\n\n“Our New Wave would never have come into being if it hadn’t been for Morris Engel’s fine movie LITTLE FUGITIVE. It showed us the way.”\n\n—François Truffaut\n\nTricked into believing he killed his older brother, seven-year-old Joey flees to Coney Island and finds refuge in boardwalk delights, cotton candy, and pony rides. With a 35mm camera strapped to his body, Morris Engel captures the world as a big adventure through the eyes of the boy. A coming-of-age classic and favorite of François Truffaut and Wes Anderson, this winning little picture from photographers Engel, Ruth Orkin, and Ray Ashley went on to win the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival and play nearly 5,000 theaters in its US theatrical run.\n\nTHE CONNECTION\n\nShirley Clarke, USA, 1961, DCP, 110 min.\n\n11/28, 12/2\n\n‘‘Right now, I’m revolting against the conventions of movies. Who says a film has to cost a million dollars and be safe and innocuous enough to satisfy every 12-year-old in America? … We’re creating a movie equivalent of Off Broadway, fresh and experimental and personal. The lovely thing is that I’m alive at just the time when I can do this.’’\n\n—Shirley Clarke, 1962\n\nFrom Shirley Clarke, here shattering stereotypes on camera and behind it, comes a provocatively nimble number about a group of drug-addicted jazz musicians waiting for their next hit in an East Village apartment as a writer finds inspiration in their every move. Based on the play-within-a-play by Jack Gelber, Clarke’s unflagging piece of grit is “a time capsule loaded with smack from the Bohemian underbelly of JFK-era America” (Salon).\n\nTHE SAVAGE EYE\n\nBen Maddow, Sidney Meyers, and Joseph Strick, USA, 1960, 35mm, 68 min.\n\n12/5, 12/9\n\n“Arresting, sometimes shocking. A forceful display of cinematic pyrotechnics. An essay on love. It is from the concentration on the Hogarthian faces of Los Angeles that THE SAVAGE EYE derives its ferocity!” —New York Times\n\n“A film of powerful impact on any audience!”\n\n—Herald Tribune\n\nA young woman waits out her divorce by making her way through the dark side of sunny, 1950s Los Angeles. Weaving through strip clubs, casinos, and endless rows of shops, a disembodied male voice dominates her consciousness, questioning her every action in stark, poetic prose. A hypnotic urban nightmare, this hybridization of documentary and fiction is a battle of angels, a quintessential piece of Los Angeles independent cinema from directors Ben Maddow, Sidney Meyers, and Joseph Strick. In 35mm.\n\nTHE EXILES\n\nKent Mackenzie, USA, 1961, DCP, 72 min.\n\n12/12, 12/16\n\n“An arresting accomplishment.”\n\n—Time Magazine\n\n“This is just about the most gorgeous restoration of an American independent film I’ve ever seen.” —Jonathan Rosenbaum\n\n“The character, cultural, and historical values of THE EXILES would be enough for a dozen movies, but it’s also a mind-blowing formal achievement.”\n\n—LA CityBeat\n\n“MIRACULOUS … Few directors in the history of cinema have so skillfully and deeply joined a sense of place with the subtle flux of inner life.”\n\n—The New Yorker\n\nThough it played the Venice Film Festival at the time of its release, this loose, jazzy look at 20-something Native Americans living in the Bunker Hill district of Los Angeles soon fell into obscurity after failing to receive theatrical distribution. Pieced together from interviews with a loving attention to detail by community outsider Kent Mackenzie, the film avoids many of the pratfalls of its contemporaries with its dedication to an authenticity of the moment.\n\nBLOOD FEAST\n\nHerschell Gordon Lewis, USA, 1963, DCP, 67 min.\n\n12/19, 12/23\n\nHerschell Gordon Lewis serves up “severed limbs, ripped-out tongues, and splattered brains” in a “potent, repellent, and strangely powerful” (L Magazine) stew of obscenities, which not only laid the groundwork for the splatter-horror subgenre but for the exploitation films to follow. Totally shocking, vile, and deliberately crude, this tale of a madman who sacrifices his kills to the Egyptian goddess Ishtar lives up to its tagline: “Nothing so appalling in the annals of horror.”\n\nHOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe holidays are a period of travel for many of us as we venture to far-off homes and hearths. For some of us though, Austin is our home, and we are staying home for the holidays. With that in mind, we are presenting some of our favorite holiday films on the big screen.\n\nBELL, BOOK, AND CANDLE\n\nRichard Quine, USA, 1958, DCP, 106 min.\n\n12/22–12/26\n\n“An erratic, light comedy with a spellbinding wild streak, centered on occult rites, New York City at Christmastime, and a magical cat named Pyewacket … The fun quotient is high, and there’s an undeniable frisson to the way the movie’s magic subculture echoes the closeted gay world of the fifties: it’s easy to view the Zodiac Club as a gay bar.”\n\n—The New Yorker\n\n“For me, Christmas is witches and warlocks, bongos, and beatniks, a classic golden age Hollywood pairing and, hands down, one of the finest and most criminally underrated festive movies of all time. I am, of course, talking about BELL, BOOK, AND CANDLE.”\n\n—The Independent\n\nKim Novak stars as a beatnik witch with a Siamese cat named Pyewacket and a warlock brother played by Jack Lemmon in this freaked-out and very funny Christmas season romance. Jimmy Stewart plays the object of her love potions. With Ernie Kovacs and Elsa Lanchester.\n\nTHE THIN MAN\n\nW.S. Van Dyke, USA, 1934, DCP, 93 min.\n\n12/22–12/28\n\n“THE THIN MAN turned several decades of movies upside down by showing a suave man of the world who made love to his own rich, funny, and good-humored wife. As Nick and Nora Charles, William Powell and Myrna Loy startled and delighted the country by their heavy drinking (without remorse) and unconventional diversions.”\n\n—Pauline Kael\n\n“Nick and Nora Charles are one of the screen’s great couples.”\n\n—Austin Chronicle\n\nWilliam Powell and Myrna Loy star as one of the screen’s most effervescent couples as they navigate a Christmas in New York and try to solve a murder in this adaptation of Dashiell Hammett’s sly, gin-soaked novel. Pure fun.\n\nTOGETHER\n\nLukas Moodysson, 2000, Sweden, 35mm, 106 min. In Swedish with English subtitles.\n\n12/23–12/25\n\n“Delightfully unexpected … A funny, graceful, and immensely good-natured work.”\n\n—The New York Times\n\n“Exemplary. One part distressing to two parts delectable.”\n\n—The New Yorker\n\nStockholm, Sweden, 1975. Fleeing her abusive husband with her two children, Stefan and Eva, Elisabeth seeks refuge with her brother and eight friends in a commune called “Together.” Between the radical politics, they’ll discover radical love can be found in the families we create. S.O.S. indeed. In 35mm.\n\nEYES WIDE SHUT\n\nStanley Kubrick, USA, 1999, DCP, 159 min.\n\n12/26–12/31\n\n“Maybe we should suspend the reductive question, “Is it any good or not?” and acknowledge that it’s a fascinating, tantalizing film that will continue to be argued about.”\n\n—New Statesman\n\n“Above all, a masterpiece of sustained tone, a tightrope act that pays off in rich and unexpected ways.”\n\n—AV Club\n\nStanley Kubrick’s dark comedy of sex and secrets, starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, garnered mixed reviews upon release, but in the 20 years since, it has become recognized as a modern classic.\n\nTHE HUDSUCKER PROXY\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen, USA, 1994, 35mm, 111 min.\n\n12/24–12/30\n\n“THE HUDSUCKER PROXY is the Coen brothers’ most accessible film to date. It’s their clearest comedy since RAISING ARIZONA, though it’s not nearly as goofy as that earlier work. It’s more an ode to genres gone by, a loving tribute to the movies of the forties and the films of Frank Capra, Howard Hawks, and Preston Sturges.”\n\n—Austin Chronicle\n\n“While not to everyone’s tastes, this is without doubt one of the most exhilarating films of the year.” —Empire\n\nThis collaboration between the Coen brothers and co-writer/assistant director Sam Raimi is every bit as dynamic as the personnel promises. Tim Robbins plays a stooge who is elevated to the head of a large company in a stock scheme with hilarious results. With Paul Newman and Jennifer Jason Leigh. In 35mm.\n\nYI YI\n\nEdward Yang, Taiwan/Japan, 2000, DCP, 173 min. In Mandarin, Min Nan, Hokkien, Japanese, and French with English subtitles.\n\n12/24–12/30\n\n“YI YI is ultimately a film that imparts its meaning and its impact through its exquisite sense of balance—between here and elsewhere, past and present, the ideal and the conditional, the mundane and the extraordinary. It is a film of, and about, grace. And that is a rare thing.”\n\n—Kent Jones\n\n“Calling YI YI a three-hour Taiwanese family drama is like calling CITIZEN KANE a film about a newspaper.”\n\n—Nigel Andrews\n\nThe final film by Taiwanese master Edward Yang (A BRIGHTER SUMMER DAY, TAIPEI STORY), this is a story of love and familial connections between a father, his teenage daughter, and his young son over the course of a few months. Yang’s extraordinary gift for cinema and sensitive approach to love and connection elevate this into a great work of the screen.\n\nWORLD CINEMA CLASSICS\n\nSPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE\n\nVíctor Erice, Spain, 1973, 35mm, 99 min. In Spanish with English subtitles.\n\n11/5, 11/7\n\n“Haunting and ethereal.”\n\n—Another Gaze\n\n“A movie that transformed my life.”\n\n—Guillermo del Toro\n\n“So simple and pure and quiet and dreamlike and stimulating. A fantasy that makes more sense than what passes as reality.”\n\n—Alan Rudolph\n\nWidely regarded as one of the greatest Spanish films of all time and celebrating its 50th anniversary, SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE is Víctor Erice’s spectacular look at monsters, real and imagined, as seen through the wide-eyed wonder of a child (the arresting Ana Torrent) captivated by the sight of FRANKENSTEIN at a traveling movie show in the wake of the Spanish Civil War. In 35mm.\n\nDRUNKEN MASTER\n\nYuen Woo-ping, Hong Kong, 1978, DCP, 111 min. In Mandarin with English subtitles.\n\n11/17–11/22\n\n“Not unlike the silent films of Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd, or for that matter, the best pictures of Hong Kong’s seventies kung fu films, the genius of DRUNKEN MASTER lies in its kinetics. Pure entertainment.” —Austin Chronicle\n\n“Martial arts genius aside, it’s the film’s warm-heartedness that has really given it its staying power, charming generation after generation of fans. This is a simple story told well, and it gets results.”\n\n—Eye For Film\n\nDirector Yuen Woo-ping and star Jackie Chan distilled a classic in this early collaboration. Chan plays young Wong Fei-hung who must master the art of drunken boxing to defeat his rival. A showcase for Jackie Chan’s incredible athletic skills and physical comedy talent.\n\nJOINT SECURITY AREA\n\nPark Chan-wook, South Korea, 2000, DCP, 110 min. In Korean with English subtitles.\n\n11/16–11/19\n\n“A beguiling mix of the generic and the unfamiliar, and it ends on a shot that’s nothing short of heartbreaking.”\n\n—Maitland McDonagh\n\n“Park Chan-wook’s JOINT SECURITY AREA is a fairly straightforward whodunit with a pointedly political theme and an unapologetically humanist message.”\n\n—New York Times\n\nIn this nail-bitingly tense early thriller from Park Chan-wook, there has been a double killing of two North Korean soldiers in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, and the solution to the mystery keeps unraveling into more unanswered questions.\n\nFRIGHT CLUB\n\nOLD DARK HOUSE\n\nJames Whale, USA, 1932, DCP, 72 min.\n\n11/16, 11/19\n\n“I’m a big James Whale fan, and this might be his best picture.”\n\n—Joe Dante\n\n“THE OLD DARK HOUSE became a Hollywood prototype with its tale of unsuspecting travelers trapped in a house full of maniacs. What gives the film real power, however, is one’s growing sense of the house not as a building but as a psyche and of the individual characters as its emotional components.” —Chicago Reader\n\nJames Whale’s immortal horror comedy is a model of camp humor. A roving band of young partiers waits out a rainstorm in the titular mansion where the occupants are too strange to believe. With Boris Karloff, Charles Laughton, Melvyn Douglas, and the unforgettable Ernest Thesiger. “Have a potato.”\n\nCARNIVAL OF SOULS\n\nHerk Harvey, USA, 1962, DCP, 80 min.\n\n12/11, 12/14\n\n“It’s possible that CARNIVAL OF SOULS plays better today than when it was released. It ventures to the edge of camp, but never strays across the line, taking itself with an eerie seriousness.”\n\n—Roger Ebert\n\n“CARNIVAL OF SOULS is brilliant.
