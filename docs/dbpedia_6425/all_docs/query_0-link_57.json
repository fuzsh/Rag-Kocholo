        "text": "On Saturday night, an estimated one million Britons will sit down for two hours to watch the finale of a 10-part cop drama, The Bridge, filmed in two languages (Swedish and Danish) that they've never even aspired to understand, still less speak.\n\nMany more will have set their hard drives, and will struggle to get through the weekend trying not to learn how TV's most diverting odd couple, Malmö detective Saga Norén and her Copenhagen counterpart Martin Rohde, will solve the case of the eco-terrorists who've been poisoning their blameless citizens with pneumonic plague virus.\n\nWhat's going on? Surely the Scandi-drama cupboard is bare, having been raided so many times in recent years by BBC4 commissioning editors desperate to fill that 9pm Saturday night Euro-drama slot?\n\nKim Bodnia, who plays Martin Rohde, giggles as I ask him these questions when we meet in the Sanderson hotel in London. \"Insane, right? Us Danes are from such a little country – there are just four million of us. But I guess we have something to offer, something you don't have enough of.\" Time was when that was just bacon and Lego, but no longer.\n\n\"Right! But for me this is incredible. What the hell am I doing here?\" He throws off his sheepskin coat and sits surveying the pretentious lobby as though he's a hayseed taking in Times Square. \"I never expected this. To be invited here by you guys! Wow! We looked to you. Now? You look to us? Incredible, dude!\" A gentle bear of a man, Bodnia speaks English with an American accent that he picked up recently in New York, where he was directing The Tailor's Tale, Bodin Saphir's play about his Jewish grandfather's life in Copenhagen during Nazi occupation.\n\nWho is Kim Bodnia? \"I'm half-Russian, half-Polish and all Jewish. At 14 I was the fastest runner in Denmark. I was nearly a professional goalkeeper. I could have been the rival of Peter Schmeichel.\" Good: football's loss is Danish culture's gain.\n\nBodnia is one of a roster of Swedish and Danish actors, directors, writers and chefs who've been brought over for this weekend's Nordicana 2014 festival in London. It's there that Scandi fetishists can meet Sidse Babett Knudsen, the Dane who played the statsminister in Borgen; there too you'll be able to pay homage to Krister Henriksson, the Swede who was Kurt Wallander long before it occurred to Kenneth Branagh he could play an English-language version of Henning Mankell's hangdog Ystad detective, and take part in the great Scandinavian cinnamon bun bake-off.\n\nAt Nordicana, you can attend demonstrations of other Scandianavian cuisine, watch trailers about upcoming Nordic noir movies – you can even look at the iconic Porsche that Saga Norén drives in The Bridge. They missed one trick, though: if Lego had produced a commemorative scale model of the superb Øresund Bridge that lends its name to the Swedish-Danish crime series that ends Saturday, then Nordicana would be the perfect tribute to Britain's strange, enduring love for Scandinavia.\n\nBut what's this all about? Aren't we done with Scandinavia yet, with its sensible cars, minimalist design, self-assembly furniture, crime thrillers, witty Radio 4 presenter, and Norwegian formula hand cream? It's been three long years since British TV viewers fell in love with Nordic noir thanks to Sophie Gråbøl's Sarah Lund, the marvellously lugubrious Danish detective with a pony-tail tied with an elastic band and her non-designer wellies. It's three years, too, since Gråbøl told me as we strolled through Copenhagen that she played Lund as a traditional male detective – she walked, talked and emoted like a man, and had authority issues usually reserved for maverick males. Britain adored her.\n\nBut today? If you're knitting one of Lund's once fashion-forward Faroe Island sweaters in 2014, you can only be doing so ironically. Denmark in particular, and Scandinavia generally, are so 2011, aren't they?\n\nReading on mobile? Click here to watch The Bridge trailer\n\nApparently not. We're still watching the Scandinavian detectives. Why? Here are two theories, each of them put to me by a Dane this week. Kasper Holsten, director of opera at Covent Garden, reckons it's because Scandinavians are doing what British TV drama used to do. \"What's happened is that the makers of [British] TV drama are looking to America and not doing what they used to do so well. That's left a gap for Danish and Swedish TV to do what you used to do – take your time, develop characters and stories.\"\n\nIt's a common theory. The Killing's head writer, Søren Sveistrup, said as much when he told me that the great virtue of British audiences liking Danish TV dramas was that it was a bulwark against cultural imperialism from the other side of the Atlantic. \"Otherwise,\" said Sveistrup, \"especially for the UK, everything becomes Americanised.\" What's especially intriguing about Scandi successes such as The Killing and The Bridge is that British TV audiences, usually monoglot and subtitle-averse, have embraced the originals much more than the inevitable US remakes. We like The Killing in Copenhagen rather than its Seattle-set simulacrum, thanks very much. (That said, only a fool would prefer the Swedish movie of Stieg Larsson's The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo over David Fincher's English-language version).\n\n\"I don't believe that you guys have become more American in drama,\" counters Kim Bodnia. \"The idea that you guys have lost the plot in TV drama is wrong.\" He has a different theory of the appeal of shows such as The Bridge. What is it? \"We are caught up in the darkness. We are caught up in the paranoid shit. The darkness, the evil and the misery – we just do those best.\" Even though Bodnia, 48, is one of the most genial interviewees I've encountered, as he sets out this theory he sounds like a cross between Kierkegaard and Ingmar Bergman.\n\nBut surely you can't be right about that. Isn't Denmark regularly voted the happiest country in Europe? \"It is, but you wouldn't guess that from our film or TV.\" True. Ever since Dogme 95 movies such as Thomas Vinterberg's Festen or Lars von Trier's The Idiots – and let's not forget Lukas Moodysson's Swedish-Danish Lilya 4-ever – Danish film has been not just one of the most engrossing national cinemas, but unremittingly, cherishably bleak. And Bodnia in his early days as an actor was part of this Nordic noir movement: he first starred in fellow Dane Nicolas Winding Refn's Pusher, playing a heroin dealer. \"I was always good at playing evil bastards – that was my speciality, professionally, until I became Martin Rohde. The Swedes got there first – their dramas were always the darkest and most upsetting, and we used to love them when I was growing up in Denmark. Now us Danes have caught up.\"\n\nThis chimes with a proposition that will be tested on Sunday at London's adult education centre, City Lit, during a day-long course called Nordic Noir. The course aims to explore the idea that the popularity of recent Danish and Swedish crime films, including the adaptations of Larsson's Millennium trilogy, can be traced back to Ingmar Bergman's 1962 film Winter Light, which dramatised the Swede's existential crisis.\n\nHere's a third theory. Yes, we may have had enough of Scandinavia. But season two of The Bridge has blindsided us, reigniting our Scandi ardour (following the rather limp third series of Copenhagen's answer to The West Wing, Borgen, that finished on BBC4 just before Christmas). And the reason it's been so compelling is not so much to do with the whodunit, but rather the relationship between Bodnia's Rohde and Sofia Helin's Norén. Yes there have been odd couples in crime dramas before (Morse and Lewis, Holmes and Watson, Clouseau and Cato, not to mention Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson in HBO's marvellous new series True Detective), but none so fruitful as these two. Norén is a cop with Asperger's (even though that word never appears in the script) and so emotes very little, but solves crimes with devastating deductive skills. She takes the inversion of gender roles one step further than Sarah Lund: sure, she effectively plays the traditional male role (though she's much more rule-bound than Lund) and is equally affectless, but she confers on her male co-worker the traditional female attributes seen in detective dramas.\n\nIt's left to Bodnia's Martin to follow Saga's lead, to say little but silently express much, to yearn for his partner to express her feelings. What's it like to play the woman's role? Bodnia laughs obligingly. \"I like it! We men we are so sensitive and we have been placed in a bad role. It's unfair that we're shown without tears, without feelings. My job is to change that stereotype.\"\n\nThankfully, there's more to Martin than a good man in touch with his feelings or reverser of gender stereotypes: in the finale, in one of those wrongfooting plot twists The Bridge does so well, we will learn that Martin has a dark, shameful secret that will stretch his and Saga's relationship to its limits. Yay! Otherwise, you'd think, he wouldn't really be Danish.\n\nBut Bodnia's character is not endlessly mutable. There is never any question of Saga and Martin, for instance, despite his libidinousness and her love of sex, having an affair. \"That would be wrong. For me, Saga is my daughter. In Norway they really want them to get together. I'm like, 'Guys, what does that say about Norway if men want to have a relationship with their daughters.' Really, though, I love Norway.\"\n\nBodnia doesn't baulk when I suggest that Martin is the best role of his career, but for now he's concentrating on others. We will see him next opposite Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper in Serena, playing a hard man who gets rubbed out in the first reel. More intriguing is his most improbable role yet – an Iranian interrogator in the much-anticipated directorial debut by Jon Stewart, host of The Daily Show.\n\nThe film is based on the 2011 memoir, Then They Came for Me, by London-based Iranian journalist Maziar Bahari who went to cover Iran's 2009 presidential elections but wound up spending three months in the country's most notorious prison. There, Bahari was interrogated by a man he recognised only by his sense of smell – hence the film's title, Rosewater.\n\nThe interrogator is played by Bodnia, Bahari by Gael García Bernal. \"It was a tough job because I'm Jewish. I'm playing a guy who really hates me and wants to destroy my country.\"\n\nHow did Bodnia get the part? \"Jon called me up and said: 'You're the guy I need.'\" But why would Jon Stewart, great satirist though he is, be making this movie? \"I think Jon feels a little guilty for what happened to the journalist. You see, Bahari appeared on the Daily Show and did this routine in which he and Jon pretended he was a spy. The Iranians took it as evidence that Bahari really was a spy. So he goes to Iran and gets arrested and treated as a spy. So Jon thinks it's partly his fault.\"\n\nBodnia shot the film with Stewart in Jordan and the US. As they filmed, Iranian state TV denounced the project, contending that Stewart was a Zionist CIA spy making a propaganda movie. \"Jon has been directing an ultra-formulaic movie commissioned by his masters,\" argued the Iranian TV report.\n\nEnough about Iranian interrogators. Bodnia is looking forward to season three of The Bridge, which is currently being written. But hold on. Surely there's something that happens in the season two finale that precludes your appearance? \"You think? Oh no, I'm going to be in season three. Trust me, dude. I'm not done with Martin Rohde yet.\""
