        "text": "The traumas of the twentieth century affected the development of trauma narrative in literature and cinema. A great amount of trauma theory in different disciplines developed largely from the Holocaust literature as well as from gender-based violence. The criticism of many examples in the contemporary trauma theory has been that it is applicable only to Western countries, not taking into account the difficult transitions between the non-Western and Western world. The countries that had gone through a brutal occupation of the Soviet Union, also experienced the trauma of transformation as whole societies into post-Soviet nations right next to the developed Nordic/Western states. This article will examine representations of trauma in Sofi Oksanen’s fictional narrative Purge (Puhdistus, 2008) and Lukas Moodysson’s cinematic narrative Lilya 4-Ever (Lilja 4-ever, Sweden/Denmark, 2002) and offer an analysis of the trauma of transitions in the borderland between post-Soviet and Nordic countries. Both Oksanen and Moodysson, as observers from the Nordic countries (Finland and Sweden respectively) have chosen to depict the post-Soviet trauma through a female body who is trapped in forced prostitution in Western Europe or Scandinavia and her emotions and reactions to her trauma. This article will argue that both authors contribute to the post-Cold War discourse that discusses the cultural borders between “East” and “West”, presenting a trauma of globalisation, drawing attention to the unspoken subjects, but also contributing to the existing views of post-Soviet spaces as ruined and traumatising.\n\nThe article is an attempt to identify a few common themes in a body of work while at the same time thinking about Sweden as especially conducive to pessimistic thinking regarding the decline in the moral economy of the world. Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the new found independence of the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Swedish film-makers have repeatedly crossed the Baltic Sea in search of subject matter not readily available in the supposedly well-ordered domestic setting at home. In these films, the former communist territories have almost invariably been imagined as marked by malaise, decay, a crumbling infrastructure and as destinations for sex tourism. Social security appears at a low ebb, poverty is rampant and phenomena such as for instance prostitution, trafficking, drug use and orphanism all seem to be on the rise. Possibly the most famous example of such a film is Lukas Moodyson’s 2002 Lilja 4-ever (Lilya 4-ever), the story of an orphaned teenage girl from the former Eastern bloc who ultimately is manipulated into coming to Sweden for a life as an involuntary sex worker. However, Moodysson’s film is not a monolith. The article is an attempt to identify a few common themes in this body of work.\n\nThis chapter is a contribution to ongoing discussions about Nordic academic feminism. It asks why and how this field continues to assume and reproduce whiteness as its naturalised point of departure and orientation and for forming a Nordic feminist “we.” It is largely conceptual, and I draw on a lived archive of 15 years of participant observation in ”Nordic” academic feminism as it has taken shape at conferences, in network and research meetings, and in classrooms and public debates. Building on the work of Sara Ahmed, Sirma Bilge, Lena Sawyer, Marta Cuesta and Diana Mulinari, I propose that whiteness can be understood as an epistemic habit of and within Nordic academic feminism. To that end, the chapter sketches a framework for understanding how whiteness is habitually and epistemically reproduced in broader logics of narration about the field, in forms of assembly and in responses to critiques of racism. Thus, whiteness is not simply a question of over-representation of white bod...\n\nThis essay compares cultural production about 1980s working-class industrial England with that of contemporary, middle-class rural Ireland in order to identify aesthetic through lines in the portrayal of social reproductive violence across both early, and later stage neoliberalism. It argues that, despite their differences in setting and demographic, novels by Pat Barker and Mike McCormack use peripheral political experience to show the bodies of women bearing the brunt of late capitalism's horrors. Barker's Union Street (1982) serves as early warning of the neoliberal consensus-to-come, bringing to life the geographic peripheralisation that would accompany deindustrialisation. It portrays the conflicted dynamic between childhood and capital, also anticipating the ways in which care work would increasingly be externalised onto women in the latter half of the twentieth century and beyond. This overlaps with the 1987 film Rita, Sue and Bob Too's portrayal of childhood sexual vulnerability, as well as Letter to Brezhnev (1985) and its rendering of capitalism's consumption of women. Instead of the realism for which these films are known, Union Street uses gothic modes and the motif of vomiting in 'irrealist' fashion (WReC, 2015). So too, Mike McCormack's Mayo-set 2016 novel, Solar Bones employs spectrality, as well as ideas of contamination, to evoke the damage wrought by a now-entrenched neoliberalism as it imperils the middle-classes. The novel's recognition of female social reproductive labour is more oblique, but women are again shown to be at the coalface of neoliberal violence, their very bodies marshalled to detect and, crucially, resist gendered precarity. In this, I draw parallel with the Dundalk-set film, Kissing Candice (2017), which uses gothic tropes to show rural dispossession writ large through the body of a teenage girl.\n\nThe article examines the child savior motif in four contemporary Finnish young adult (YA) dystopias. The major topics discussed are political agency, environment, and fairy tale intertextuality in these works, which are connected to the northern ideal of children and adolescents as subjects able to affect their own lives. Contemporary Finnish YA dystopian literature does not portray Finland as a societal utopia but, rather, as a society in which social welfare and the general well-being of citizens have collapsed as a result of ecological disasters, continuous wars, totalitarian regimes, or the repression of minorities. Although the problems contemporary Finnish YA dystopias depict are often global, the novels still ground their ethics on northern conceptualizations of the welfare state and the unquestionable ideal of equality."
