        "text": "Vicky Krieps\n\nCreative Excellence Award\n\nIn a captivating display of talent, German-Luxembourgish actress Vicky Krieps (b. 1983) was honoured as The Best Actress at the 35th European Film Awards held in Reykjavik in December 2022 for her portrayal of Austrian Empress Elisabeth in Marie Kreutzer's Corsage (2022). Krieps' career started to skyrocket in the mid-2010s when she took on significant roles in various high profile productions. She showcased her talent in The Young Karl Marx (2017) and Gutland (2019), but it was her mesmerising performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's Academy award-winning masterpiece Phantom Thread (2017) that propelled her into the international spotlight. Her captivating on-screen presence continued to shine in Bergman Island (2021) and More Than Ever (2022), Gaspard Ulliel’s penultimate film. Krieps' latest venture took her back to her German roots, as she assumed the title role in Ingeborg Bachmann – Journey into the Desert (2023), directed by legendary German filmmaker Margarethe von Trotta. For, among other things, her diverse range of compelling performances and an innate ability to bring characters to life, Vicky Krieps receives RIFF’s Creative Excellence Award.\n\nIsabelle Huppert\n\nCreative Excellence Award\n\nWith a prolific career spanning more than 50 years and nearly 150 film and TV productions, Isabelle Anne Madeleine Huppert (b. 1953) is a luminous figure in French cinema. Huppert’s career has been adorned with a constellation of accolades that reflect her exceptional talent. In 1978, her remarkable performance in The Lacemaker (1977) earned her the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer and her ascent continued with two Best Actress awards at the Cannes Film Festival for Violette Nozière (1978) and The Piano Teacher (2001). Huppert garnered international acclaim for her performance in Elle (2016), which earned her a Golden Globe Award and Academy Award Nomination. As a testament to her enduring influence, in 2020 The New York Times heralded Isabelle Huppert as the second-greatest actor of the 21st century, and at the 72nd Berlin Film Festival in 2022, she was graced with the Honorary Golden Bear, a testament to her lifelong dedication to the craft of acting. With Huppert's name etched among the luminaries, we are excited to have her legacy and unceasing source of mastery celebrated at RIFF 2023.\n\nNicolas Philibert\n\nCreative Excellence Award\n\nOne of the most celebrated figures in French documentary filmmaking, Nicolas Philibert (b. 1951), is known for his artful and patient exploration of everyday humanity. Philibert's cinematic journey found its genesis in the 1970s, when he assisted esteemed directors such as René Allio and Alain Tanner. Over the ensuing decades, his career evolved from television productions into feature documentaries. Just before the new millennium, he crafted remarkable works such as La Ville Louvre (1990), In the Land of the Deaf (1992), and Every Little Thing (1997). One of Philibert's most successful films, To Be and to Have (2002), premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and won the Prix Louis Delluc before achieving remarkable success internationally. In his latest masterpiece, On the Adamant (2023), which won the top prize at this year's Berlinale, Philibert offers an intimate glimpse into the lives of adults with intellectual disabilities. On the 20th edition of RIFF we will be celebrating Nicolas Philibert's remarkable career and cinematic legacy – one that has consistently portrayed the world with a sincere and inquisitive lens.\n\nCatherine Breillat\n\nHonorary Guest\n\nWith a prolific career spanning more than 50 years and nearly 150 film and TV productions, Isabelle Anne Madeleine Huppert (b. 1953) is a luminous figure in French cinema.

With Huppert's name etched among the luminaries, we are excited to have her legacy and unceasing source of mastery celebrated at RIFF 2023.\n\nLuc Jacquet\n\nGreen Puffin Award\n\nFrench documentary filmmaker Luc Jacquet (b. 1967) is the recipient of RIFF’s Green Puffin environmental award. With an unwavering focus on showcasing the wonders of our planet, Jacquet’s films take the audience on fantastic journeys exploring nature's wildest ecosystems. Jacquet's early interests in nature and animal life led him to obtain a master’s degree in animal biology and ecology. These studies paved the way for numerous expeditions to Antarctica, where he delved deep into the ecology of earth’s least populated continent. During one of his expeditions he took on the role of a cameraman for Hans-Ulrich Schlumpf’s film The Congress of Penguins (1993). This marked the beginning of Jacquet's passion for filmmaking, setting him on a path to bring the wonders of the natural world to the silver screen. Since then, Jacquet's dedication to environmental issues has been evident in his acclaimed documentaries, including Once Upon A Forest (2015), Ice and the Sky (2015), and March of the Penguins (2005), winner of the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. His films not only present the planet's beauty but also illuminate it with joy and wonder, leaving a lasting impact on audiences worldwide.\n\nÖrn Árnason\n\nYoungRIFF Honorary Award\n\nÖrn Árnason is the recipient of YoungRIFF's honorary award for his contribution to children's culture. Örn is one of the best-known actors of Iceland and has delighted audiences of all ages with his diverse roles in a career spanning nearly four decades. Örn is employed as an actor at The National Theatre of Iceland, but for years he was self-employed as an actor, producer, director and author. Among his best known roles and projects are the TV series Spaugstofan and the series about Grandpa, When the Robbers Came to Cardamom Town, Ronia, the Robber's Daughter, Around the World in 80 Days, Spamalot, Dyrene i Hakkebakkeskogen, and Harry & Heimir. Örn has dubbed a number of cartoons for both television and film and was one of the founders of the dubbing company Hljóðsetning. He has also worked in TV for many years and sung on several records.\n\nRossy de Palma\n\nCreative Excellence Award\n\nRossy de Palma was born on 16 September 1965 in Palma, Mallorca. Eighteen years old she moved to Madrid where she performed with the pop band Peor Imposible or The Worst Possible. In 1986 she was working at a rockabilly-bar when she met Pedro Almodóvar – an incident that marked the beginning of a fruitful and long cooperation. Since then de Palma has acted in many of his films, for example: Law of Desire (1987), Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1988), Broken Embraces (2009) and his latest film Parallel Mothers (2021). Luckily the two of them met because since then the world has enjoyed Palma’s unique charisma and talents in the many fields of art. She has worked with directors such as Álex de la Iglesia, Robert Altman, Mike Figgis, Laure Charpentier, Terry Gilliam, and Mehdi Charef, and as a singer and fashion model, for Alexander McQueen, Jean Paul Gaultier, Thierry Mugler to name a few.\n\nAlexandre O. Phillipe\n\nHonorary Guest\n\nAlexandre O. Philippe holds an MFA in Dramatic Writing from NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts and holds the position of creative director at Exhibit A Pictures. He has made several award-winning shorts, the most notable one is Left which won an award at a short film festival in Japan in honor of Akira Kurosawa. Philippe is known for his documentaries, in which he studies pop culture, important films and scenes, including the post-modern masterpiece 78/52, which deconstructs the famous shower scene in Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock. Other noteworthy films include The People vs. George Lucas and Doc of the Dead. Apart from directing films, Philippe gives lectures, conducts seminars and serves as a jury member at several film festivals.\n\nAlbert Serra\n\nHonorary Guest\n\nAlbert Serra is a catalan artist and filmmaker born in 1975 in Spain. He is well known for his work for theater and cinema, as a writer, director and producer. European myths, history and literature are recurrent themes in his works. He has been diligent in filmmaking since 2004 and made award-winning movies, such as Honour of the Knights (2007), The Death of Louis XIV (2016), Story of My Death (2013), which won the Golden Leopard, the main prize of Locarno Film Festival, and Freedom (2016) which got the special jury award in Cannes 2019. Serra is a fun and mysterious eccentric, who has raised many people’s attention with his remarks, such as when he half jokingly states that actors are unintelligent and weak. As a matter of fact, he employs amateur actors whenever possible. His films, however, don’t depict strong opinions or messages – but are on the other hand characterized by their slow artistic rhythm without a plot. In his new film, Pacifiction, we see a sign of a turning point in his career and also in the art of cinema.
