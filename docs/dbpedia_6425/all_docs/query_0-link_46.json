        "text": "Vicky Krieps\n\nCreative Excellence Award\n\nIn a captivating display of talent, German-Luxembourgish actress Vicky Krieps (b. 1983) was honoured as The Best Actress at the 35th European Film Awards held in Reykjavik in December 2022 for her portrayal of Austrian Empress Elisabeth in Marie Kreutzer's Corsage (2022). Krieps' career started to skyrocket in the mid-2010s when she took on significant roles in various high profile productions. She showcased her talent in The Young Karl Marx (2017) and Gutland (2019), but it was her mesmerising performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's Academy award-winning masterpiece Phantom Thread (2017) that propelled her into the international spotlight. Her captivating on-screen presence continued to shine in Bergman Island (2021) and More Than Ever (2022), Gaspard Ulliel‚Äôs penultimate film. Krieps' latest venture took her back to her German roots, as she assumed the title role in Ingeborg Bachmann ‚Äì Journey into the Desert (2023), directed by legendary German filmmaker Margarethe von Trotta. For, among other things, her diverse range of compelling performances and an innate ability to bring characters to life, Vicky Krieps receives RIFF‚Äôs Creative Excellence Award.\n\nIsabelle Huppert\n\nCreative Excellence Award\n\nWith a prolific career spanning more than 50 years and nearly 150 film and TV productions, Isabelle Anne Madeleine Huppert (b. 1953) is a luminous figure in French cinema. Huppert‚Äôs career has been adorned with a constellation of accolades that reflect her exceptional talent. In 1978, her remarkable performance in The Lacemaker (1977) earned her the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer and her ascent continued with two Best Actress awards at the Cannes Film Festival for Violette Nozi√®re (1978) and The Piano Teacher (2001). Huppert garnered international acclaim for her performance in Elle (2016), which earned her a Golden Globe Award and Academy Award Nomination. As a testament to her enduring influence, in 2020 The New York Times heralded Isabelle Huppert as the second-greatest actor of the 21st century, and at the 72nd Berlin Film Festival in 2022, she was graced with the Honorary Golden Bear, a testament to her lifelong dedication to the craft of acting. With Huppert's name etched among the luminaries, we are excited to have her legacy and unceasing source of mastery celebrated at RIFF 2023.\n\nNicolas Philibert\n\nCreative Excellence Award\n\nOne of the most celebrated figures in French documentary filmmaking, Nicolas Philibert (b. 1951), is known for his artful and patient exploration of everyday humanity. Philibert's cinematic journey found its genesis in the 1970s, when he assisted esteemed directors such as Ren√© Allio and Alain Tanner. Over the ensuing decades, his career evolved from television productions into feature documentaries. Just before the new millennium, he crafted remarkable works such as La Ville Louvre (1990), In the Land of the Deaf (1992), and Every Little Thing (1997). One of Philibert's most successful films, To Be and to Have (2002), premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and won the Prix Louis Delluc before achieving remarkable success internationally. In his latest masterpiece, On the Adamant (2023), which won the top prize at this year's Berlinale, Philibert offers an intimate glimpse into the lives of adults with intellectual disabilities. On the 20th edition of RIFF we will be celebrating Nicolas Philibert's remarkable career and cinematic legacy ‚Äì one that has consistently portrayed the world with a sincere and inquisitive lens.\n\nCatherine Breillat\n\nHonorary Guest\n\nWith a prolific career spanning more than 50 years and nearly 150 film and TV productions, Isabelle Anne Madeleine Huppert (b. 1953) is a luminous figure in French cinema.

This marked the beginning of Jacquet's passion for filmmaking, setting him on a path to bring the wonders of the natural world to the silver screen. Since then, Jacquet's dedication to environmental issues has been evident in his acclaimed documentaries, including Once Upon A Forest (2015), Ice and the Sky (2015), and March of the Penguins (2005), winner of the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

Since then de Palma has acted in many of his films, for example: Law of Desire (1987), Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1988), Broken Embraces (2009) and his latest film Parallel Mothers (2021). Luckily the two of them met because since then the world has enjoyed Palma‚Äôs unique charisma and talents in the many fields of art. She has worked with directors such as √Ålex de la Iglesia, Robert Altman, Mike Figgis, Laure Charpentier, Terry Gilliam, and Mehdi Charef, and as a singer and fashion model, for Alexander McQueen, Jean Paul Gaultier, Thierry Mugler to name a few.\n\nAlexandre O.
