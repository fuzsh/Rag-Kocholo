        "text": "27/10/2006\n\nIn town to attend the London Film Festival and to promote Container, released by Metrodome Distribution, Swedish filmmaker Lukas Moodysson is the subject of a special film series and an exclusive art installation at the ICA (Institute of Contemporary Art) in London, starting today and running until mid-November.\n\nWelcomed overall by very positive reviews in the UK press, Container is kick-starting the Films of Lukas Moodysson Retrospective, dedicated to Sweden's most successful cinematic film export since Ingmar Bergman, and also includes his four previous films: Show Me Love, Together, A Hole IN My Heart and Lilya 4Ever, most of which were acquired by Metrodome for the UK.\n\nThe art installation \"Inside the Head of Lukas Moodysson: The Container Crypt\" was already used for the film's release in Sweden a few months ago and is now the film's travelling companion as it opens across Europe. It functions as an interactive and experiential museum displaying cherished artefacts from Lukas' life and films.\n\nAmong the eight other new films opening today are three UK productions and co-productions, the biggest title being the Cannes 2006 Jury Prize-winning film Red Road by Oscar-winning writer/director Andrea Arnold. The UK/Danish co-production between Red Road Films – a subsidiary of Glasgow-based Sigma Films – and Zentropa Films is being released nationwide by Verve Pictures on 32 screens. Arnold's first feature film screened as part of the London Film Festival earlier this week and had its UK premiere in Glasgow last Wednesday."
