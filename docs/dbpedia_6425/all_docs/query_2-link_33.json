        "text": "BOB Berney is in an enviable position.\n\nJust before he left as senior vice president of IFC Films, he helped release a small-budget independent film about a girl who marries a guy her family thinks is wrong for her.\n\n\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" has made almost $250 million and seems destined to win a few awards before the season is over.\n\nLast September, he became president of Newmarket Films, another company specializing in independent films.\n\nUsually those films start on the coasts, play in Top 10 markets and come to Oklahoma City on video months later.\n\nUntil now. Berney has family here. For the past few years, we've been getting our fair share of good foreign and independent films, and that's because Berney sends them here.\n\nAnother of his movies, \"Real Women Have Curves,\" starts in the city today.\n\nHe claims that two other independent movies, one \"Greek Wedding\" and the other the racy \"Y Tu Mama Tambien,\" got him an introduction to the powers that be at HBO.\n\nHBO made \"Real Women Have Curves\" and for the first time, released a movie theatrically before showing it on its cable channel.\n\n\"HBO finally decided to reach new people,\" Berney said from his New York City office. \"This movie intertwines a Latino story and a university story all women can relate to. Everybody likes that and the empowerment it brings.\"\n\nBerney compares this movie with \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,\" saying they both have a sweetness at their heart.\n\nHe also is bringing more movies to Oklahoma City because the number of moviegoers attending the screenings has remained steady, and the addition of a small theater at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art shows movies that can play nowhere else in town.\n\nWell, that, plus his family.\n\n\"I have a lot of family in the city. Cousins, aunts and uncles.\"\n\nHe also has a few more movies ready to open in the city later this year.\n\nOf the films \"Spun,\" \"Lilya 4-Ever,\" \"Open Hearts\" and \"Whale Rider,\" Berney is very excited about the last one.\n\n\"Whale Rider\" was well-received at the 2002 Toronto Film Festival and is the story of a young girl's fight to prove her love, her leadership and her destiny in a New Zealand Maori community.\n\n\"'Whale Rider' won the audience award in Toronto,\" he said.\n\nArchive ID: 1105920"
