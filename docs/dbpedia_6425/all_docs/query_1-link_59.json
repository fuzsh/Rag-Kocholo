        "text": "Keynote given at the 8 th Annual International Conference on Small Cinemas (“Diversity in Glocal Cinemas: Language, Culture, Identity”), Bilbao and San Sebastian, Spain, September 20-22, 2017\n\nAbstract\n\nGlobalisation is often mostly thought of as a danger and challenge to small cinemas and as the strengthening of multinational, global companies. This is indeed a very important dimension to have in mind, when addressing globalisation and cinema. However, as I will demonstrate in this keynote with examples from Scandinavian cinema, small nations have also been able to gain momentum in this global world by creative and economic co-production. This form of regional, transnational cinema has benefitted from EU policies in this area and also to a large degree by regional and national film support and collaboration. This transnationalisation of the cinema (and television) of small nations in Scandinavia (and Europe) contributes to the global and multicultural diversity of film culture. Based on theories of mediated cultural encounters and the forming of our social imagination, this keynote looks at structural developments of Scandinavian cinema and presents central key films to demonstrate the theory.\n\nIntro\n\nThe Strength of the European film- and television culture is its diversity: diversity of languages, national cultures and traditions, of genres and aesthetic forms. But this national and cultural diversity is also the weakness of the European film- and television culture. We manage every year to produce more than three times as many films as the US in Europe as a whole. But we are not really capable of distributing our films to other Europeans – let alone the rest of the world. National and local cultures are not just a blessing and a richness, it is also the curse of European cinema. Whereas the US knows no borders in Europe, for European films, the national borders are quite real – despite more than 50 years of European integration. The slogan of the EU is “unity in diversity”, but when it comes to culture and film culture, there is much more diversity than unity. In an age of digital globalisation European cinema more than ever face a challenge of globalisation. We do not in any way need to develop a more unified European cinema – in terms of genres and transnational content. We do not need a homogenized European film culture. But what we certainly need is to get our diverse national and local cinema out to the Europeans and the rest of the world.\n\nThe Cultural dimensions of globalisation\n\nGlobalisation is a complex term and issue, which covers and influences most central spheres of society. Following present day discussions of globalisation you sometimes get the impression that globalisation is a new phenomenon, and that we have once lived in a national and local reality, where globalisation did not play any role. But according to all archaeological and historical data and theories this feeling we may have of globalisation as a very recent phenomenon is false. The leader of the Danish Human Genome Centre, Eske Willerslev, in a recent article said: “Danes are a product of migration” and other intensive forms of encounters across waste regions. All modern nations and humans as a species are in fact a result of economic, political, social and cultural globalisation and of global encounters – not least through media, film and television drama.\n\nHowever, the intensity of globalisation, the forms of globalisation and the historical waves of globalisation have changed. So one of the reasons we may feel that globalisation is a very recent phenomenon is that technologies of communication has made our world a lot smaller, and has made it possible to experience globalisation on a more intense daily basis. Modern media and communication have made our personal experience of the world outside our primary local and national community much more direct. Most nation states in Europe have also – since 1945, depending on their previous colonial history – developed into more multicultural societies with a stronger ethnic, cultural and religious diversity.\n\nThis has around Europe also resulted in a rise of confronting forms of identity politics. This has been further fuelled by the present refugee and migration crisis in Europe. As I will return to, the banal and normal feeling of belonging to a national community has recently fuelled more aggressive forms of nationalism and xenophobia. In Seyla Benhabib’s book The Claims of Culture. Equality and Diversity in the Global Era (2002) she warns against what she calls identity wars, when nation states and political groups start developing static and fundamentalist notions of national identity:\n\nCulture has become a ubiquitous synonym for identity, an identity marker and differentiator (…) groups now forming around such identity markers demand legal recognition (…) Identity politics draws the state into culture wars (..) such a view risk essentializing the idea of culture as the property of an ethnic group or race; it risks reifying cultures as separate entities by overemphasizing their boundedness and distinctness; it risks overemphasizing the internal homogeneity of cultures that potentially legitimize repressive demands for cultural conformity.” (Benhabib 2002: 2 and 4)\n\nBenhabib’s attack on identity politics, especially identity politics based on group rights, is related to two very different concepts of national culture and identity. On the one hand there is the cosmopolitan position on the other the nationalist position. The cosmopolitan concept stresses the universal dimension of culture and the individual right to define its identity within a given national culture or any other context, so it is open and inclusive. The nationalist concept on the other hand tend to close the horizon of culture and identity based on a specific ethnic and/or historical notions of who belongs to the national culture, and who does not. The notion of cosmopolitanism has played and important role in recent sociological writings on Europeanization, as it becomes evident from the following quotes:\n\n“The cosmopolitan imagination enables European to look beyond their taken for granted identities and the membership categories derived frm them. In practice, cosmopolitanism always works through the self’s critical confrontation with the other and the world.” (Hans-Jörg Trenz Narrating European Society (2016) – referring to Gerard Delanty (2009).\n\n“Cosmopolitanism is not taken up (..) as a new normative project (…) Instead of enforcing cosmopolitanism against the world of nation-states as a non-linear Ulrich Beck proposes investigating cosmopolitanization as a ”non-linear, dialectic process in which the universal and particular, the similar and the dissimilar, the global and the local are to be concieved , not as cultural polarities, but as interconnected principles.” ” (Hans-Jörg Trenz Narrating European Society (2016) – referring to Gerard Ulrich Beck (2009).\n\nI will return to this theme in connection with Danish and Scandinavian film policy. However, my keynote will not primarily deal with globalisation and our multicultural reality from a historical or contemporary macro-perspective, although I will occasionally touch upon some elements in contemporary politics and society, especially cultural policy. My keynote will be about the concept of mediated cultural encounters and the role of Scandinavian cinema in this kind of cultural globalisation. Although Scandinavia is a rather small region in the global world of cinema, television and the new digital media, it has in fact made its mark on the global stage, something the brand ‘Nordic noir’ is a symbol of.\n\nMy presentation will take two main directions. On the one hand I will try to demonstrate how the Scandinavian model for cinema support and production has developed a rather robust form of transnational creative co-production structures, structures that are however not always as strong when it comes to distribution (via cinema, television and digital streaming services) – a distribution weakness that is very common in the fragmented European media culture. On the other hand I will analyse how Scandinavian cinema has dealt with globalisation and the multicultural reality of Scandinavia and Europe as a film topic.\n\nI will use as my example the films of the Danish-Iraqi director Fenar Ahmad, especially his most recent success Darkland (2017). In Ahmad’s films the multicultural reality of Danish society is dealt with in a spectacular way in a hybrid genre of social realism and action film. I will also touch upon the likewise Danish director Susanne Bier and her award winning globalisation trilogy (Brothers, After the Wedding and In a Better World) and the Swedish equivalent, Lukas Moodysson’s Lija Forever and Mammout. Finally I will discuss aspects of Finish Finnish filmmaker Aki Kaurismäki’s way of dealing with globalisation and the multicultural society, especially in Le Havre (2011). I will deal with these films both in the context of creative diversity and in the heated debate of identity politics and globalisation in today’s Europe.\n\nCinema and the concept of mediated cultural encounters\n\nStories and narratives are not just luxury and entertainment, they are in fact central to the way we understand the world – our own world and that off others. Cinema and indeed also television are powerful tools for creating cultural encounters, and such mediated encounters with different worlds and characters are as important for forming our social and cultural imaginary. They are a way of mapping our world and of opening inroads to worlds outside what we already have experienced. The cognitive theory of narratives and imaginaries, for instance Jonathan Gottschall’s The Storytelling Animal. How Stories Make Us Human (2012) or Jerome Bruner’s Making Stories (2002), strongly underlines this central role. Jerome Bruner defines the essential role of stories and narratives like this:\n\nOne truth is surely self-evident: for all that narrative is one of our evident delights, it is (also) serious business. For better or for worse, it is our preferred, perhaps even our obligatory medium for expressing human aspirations and their vicissitudes, our own and those of others. Our stories also impose a structure, a compelling reality on what we experience (Bruner 2002: 89).\n\nGottschall takes the same position on the centrality of narrative, but stresses even more the evolutionary importance of all sorts of storytelling:\n\nWe each have a little Sherlock Holmes in our brain. His job is to ‘reason backwards’ from what we can observe in the present and show that orderly series of causes led to particular effects. Evolution has given us an ‘inner Holmes’ because the world really is full of stories (intrigues, plots, alliances, relationships of cause and effect) and it pays to detect them. The storytelling mind is a crucial evolutionary adaptation. It allows us to experience our lives as coherent, orderly, and meaningful. It is what makes life more than a blooming, buzzing confusion (Gottschall 2102: 102).\n\nIf we follow the suggestions and theories by Bruner and Gottschall, narratives are not just the constructed stories in literature, films or television series, it is a fundamental part of the way our mind works with reality, it is something we use in our normal everyday life. But then we can also understand why films fascinate. They bring stories to life in a way that on one level interact with our normal everyday experience of reality and at the same time take it to a new level of complexity and coherence, merging emotions and reality experience.\n\nThe Copenhagen Team of the European Research project, Mediating Cultural Encounters Through European Screens (2013-2016) has just finished a co-authored book, Transnational European Television Drama: Production, Genres and Audiences (2017). Although this book is based on studies of European television drama, the results presented also have a lot to tell us about the role of film for transnational cultural encounters. When Benedict Anderson in 1983 coined the term ‘imagined communities’ he was describing how nation states needed stories, symbols, communication and media to establish a feeling of belonging to a national community. Nations are in fact seldom very homogeneous, and are often challenged by social, cultural, ethnic, religious and other differences. In his enlightening but sometimes also provoking book, Sapiens. A Brief History of Manking Youval Noah Harari addressed the imagined character of nation states and especially nationalism critically like this:\n\nNationalism works extra hours to make us imagine that millions of strangers belong to the same community as ourselves, that we all have a common past, common interests and a common future. This isn’t a lie. It’s imagination. (…) The nation does its best to hide its imagined character. Most nations argue that they are a natural and eternal entity, created in some primordial epoch by mixing the soil of the motherland with the blood of the people (Harari 2011: xx)\n\nIf we look at this from a cinema or television perspective, our research, presented in the book, clearly confirms the strong place of national film and television in people’s life. This may seem strange since all Europeans in fact watch much more American film and television than national – certainly in small nations with a rather small own production. In fact we have much more frequent mediated encounters on film with other cultures than our national. We also have much more contact with UK-American film and media culture than we have with film and television from other European countries.\n\nDespite this, data on audience preferences for film and television clearly indicate a preference for national film and television. This has been demonstrated in many empirical studies, and this principle can, following the American Joseph Straubhaar (1991, 2007) be called the ‘proximity principle of mediated cultural encounters.’ What this principle is about is not just how mediated cultural encounters function, but also a more general sociological principle. All humans tend to understand and relate better to people similar to themselves and people they know from closer contact in their everyday life. It is about how we form networks and the distance between close and distant nodes in such networks. However because of the globalisation of media cultures our forms of mediated cultural encounters are challenged and expanded in several ways.\n\nIf we look a little more systematically at forms of mediated cultural encounters in our developed global era, we may divided them in two very large categories:\n\nThe production-creative level: which covers all aspects of production, co-production, financing, creative collaboration in a national or transnational context and the by now rather complex process of distribution via traditional and new digital platforms\n\nThe audience-reception level: which covers both qualitative and quantitative data on audience behaviour in a national-transnational media culture, the way media products are interpreted and reflected in the public debate and the question of how audiences in specific national contexts experience their own and foreign film and television culture.\n\nIn our book we clearly demonstrate that transnational mediated cultural encounters play an increased role on both levels. Although nation states are certainly still powerful constructions and central for our media production and media experience, they are clearly increasingly influenced by transnational and global flows of narratives and images. Moreover, they are very strongly challenged by ‘borderless, digital communities and platforms’ – where again Americans dominate (Netflix, HBO, Amazon). A transnational dimension has always influenced nation states in Europe, but it is probably fair to say that national film and television cultures in Europe have developed a stronger transnational culture of co-production and creative collaboration. Europe as a whole is still a rather fragmented culture of small nations and regions, but something is moving, and weak as it is, Creative Europe and the political push for a digital single market is pointing in the direction.\n\nLet me show you two figure of co-production on television drama, which is based on data from 15 countries between 2011-2014 . This is a snapshot of the transnational television production network in Europe, and the interesting thing is that whereas the first shows the distribution of single productions with UK in a very dominant role and rather thin lines between other countries, the second illustrates what happens when co-production takes place: the network is much stronger between several different countries. So co-production does matter, it simply enhances the forms of mediated transnational encounters.\n\nThe national-transnational film culture: Scandinavian perspectives\n\nIf we look at the basic structures of Scandinavian film culture and film policy, I would like to point to some elements that all Scandinavian film cultures (with variations) have in common:\n\nA strong and independent public funding institution for film and an equally strong public service television sector which on many levels cooperate and support each other\n\nA rather wide variety of funding schemes and mechanisms aiming at creating a diversity of film, film genres and with a mix of national and regional funds\n\nThough nationally funded the policy of funding is very open to global collaboration, there are no narrow definition of what counts as a Danish film\n\nVery active European and global co-production strategy, compared to size of the region Scandinavia, in particularly Denmark takes a very large share of Creative Europe funding, and the Scandinavian co-funding and co-production through for instance Nordic Film and TV Fund supplement the European dimension.\n\nLet me illustrate this by some quote from the Danish film policy strategy as it has developed since 1999, where we see a clear intention of combining the national and the transnational into what you might call the strategy of a transnational state:\n\nThe European cinema market is dominated by American films. The vision behind the existing Nordic and European collaboration is to strengthen the national films and their transnational distribution (…) The vision behind the international film cooperation is on the one hand to maintain and further develop national film production, and to contribute to the development of European film culture. Denmark must contribute to stronger co-production on a Nordic and European level by increasing the economic resources for this area (DFI 1999)\n\nWhat is striking here at the official film policy level also clearly dominates the discourse of production companies and creative people in the film and television sector. One of the biggest and most innovative Scandinavian companies, Zentropa, the company that produces Lars von Triers films and conquered the art film world with Dogme 95 has a very clear and offensive transnational strategy, as this quote from 2009 underlines:\n\nWe want to conquer the world in our own quiet way. With timely care and common sense. It costs a lot of money to set up operations in every country. It’s our plan, within three or five years, to be fully represented with operating companies in the old Western Europe. And it’s not unlikely either, that we will be making films in the US within a similar time frame (…) To comply with national and international regulations for receiving subsidies, we have been keeping offices in several countries. But in the long run, just dipping our snout into other countries’ troughs is too one-sided. No matter how good you are at making movies, no country will keep subsidizing you. They want to give you a leg up, but they also want something in return. (Nielsen 2009)\n\nSome of the prolific Scandinavian film directors (Dagu Kaari, Lone Scherfig, Per Fly, Thomas Vinterberg, Janus Metz and Ole Christian Madsen) in 2013 formed The Creative Alliance, and in their declaration they embrace the global and point to the necessity of European film culture to learn to combine creative freedom and business innovation.\n\nCreative Alliance: Declaration of Development\n\nSigned by: Dagu Kari, Lone Scherfig, Per Fly, Thomas Vinterberg, Janus Metz and Ole Christian Madsen, January 2013\n\nDetermined to combine the best of Scandinavian film traditions and practices with the strength and scale of the film industry in the United States,\n\nImpassioned to strengthen likeminded Scandinavian filmmakers’ ability to develop original stories in the English language,\n\nDeclaring that the principle objective is to ensure creative freedom and ownership of our own projects,\n\nResolved by combining our collective resources to preserve, share and strengthen the company and our influence,\n\nWe hereby adhere to the following principles that are rooted in the belief that the foundation for successful film development lies in the recognition that creative freedom and business innovation go hand-in-hand\n\nIn the more detailed parts of their pretty detailed declaration they deliberately lift the creative intentions away from the just national. They stress that they want to make films that have an originality and strong personal identity, and that they want to have control also of the business models they work with. But nevertheless they stress the principle of internationalism:\n\nWe believe that contemporary cinema is the international cinema\n\nWe develop our films for the worldwide audience\n\nWe develop new business models for film development and financing that transcends borders\n\nIt is not difficult to understand how this declaration can be seen as a provocation against the nation state film culture and certain concepts of art cinema. But perhaps it is a necessary and timely provocation against European nation states that seem to establish national barricades against migration and refugees and against each other. Perhaps it is a timely reaction against a very narrow understanding of national cinema and the problem that has haunted European cinema for decades: we make films for national audiences, but we have never really managed to make a creative and diverse European cinema work for a transnational European audience. This is not, as it is often argued, because we Europeans are so different that we cannot understand the stories we produce across the borders. Who would have believed 10 years ago that Nordic noir would be a global success?\n\nA cosmopolitan understanding of national film cultures\n\nAs already indicated, most nation states in Europe are in fact multicultural states in the sense that even though you can probably define some kind of majority culture there is also a strong diversity of social and ethnic groups, languages, cultural norms and habits, religious beliefs etc. Nation states are in fact legal and institutional constructions around an often very heterogeneous population. Since 1945 this heterogeneity has increase following migration and waves of refugees, and following the influence of European integration and inner market. But what we have seen over the last 10 years is a move away from a cosmopolitan concept of the nation state and national culture and an attempt to return to a more fundamental nationalism and restricted understanding of national culture.\n\nFrom a Danish perspective – but similar developments can be found in other Scandinavian and European countries – this has resulted in a political state move towards ‘identity wars’ (referring back to Benhabib). I will just give you one example of the kind of discourse we find in this ‘cultural identity war’, what the Danish priest, Kathrine Winkel Holm, author and chairman of the Society for free print, and a strong supporter of the Danish right wing Danish Folk party said after the terror incident in Manchester: “It is the weak and defenceless children in Manchester who paid the price for the British elite’s romantic dream of a world without borders. What we need is that our authorities refresh their reading of Paulus and Luther and start doing the job they have been given by God: Ruthless defence of our country against those that want to ruin us” (Jyllands-Posten).\n\nThis is a very harsh version of something we see in public discourse and mirrored in Danish cultural policy. The Danish state and politics has since 2000 has been obsessed by trying to define what it is to be Danish, what is specific to Danes and as a consequence has to be used in the attempt to integrate and assimilate new Danes into society.\n\nThe cultural canon (2004): launched under the Liberal-Conservative government Fogh Rasmussen in order to define the works of Danish culture in all types of art, which could be said to define what Danish culture is.\n\nThe Democracy canon (2008) launched under the same government in order to define those events, philosophical ideas and political texts that have influenced the Danish democray.\n\nThe Denmark canon (2016) launched under the present liberal-conservative government: “ In a time with anxiety about the future, and where many are in doubt about our common values, this initiative will define those 10 central values, which are our common cultural DNA, a way to clarify our culture and the values that keep our society together.” Bertel Haarder)\n\nThe Danish and Scandinavian film culture has largely reacted against this notion of an essential, homogeneous Danish culture. The Danish Film Institute (2015) adopted a Charter for ethnic diversity in Danish film in their film policy, in which it is stated: “We are of the opinion that ethnic diversity will enrich and further develop Danish film and film culture and want diversity to be an integrated part of Danish film and film culture. We want the access to Danish film for both filmmakers and audiences to be independent of ethnic background, and that Danish film can create identity and engage and entertain all Danes.” Note that the charter doesn’t stipulate specific means for obtaining diversity, no quotas for instance. It is a statement against a fundamentalist notion of national culture, and it is in fact a declaration for a cosmopolitan film policy, which is neither guided by nationalist or other ethnic priorities.\n\nIn my forthcoming book, written together with my wife Ulla Bondebjerg, Danish Film and Cultural Globalisation (2017), we point out that the global diversity of Danish cinema has increased considerably since 1960, both in terms of ethnic diversity, that is for instance directors with another background than Danish, and in terms of how much themes of globalisation dominate in especially documentary film, but also fiction film. The number of films made by Danish directors with another background than Danish should be compared to the fact that Danes with a non-Western background is about 8.3% of the total population.\n\nThat Danish and Scandinavian directors directly oppose this new nationalist understanding of Danish national culture was already clear in the policy documents from DFI and the statements of The Creative Alliance, but as we shall see a cosmopolitan notion of Danish film culture is marked not just by statements from the creative film culture, but the cosmopolitan films that are made. Susanne Bier is next to Lars von Trier a very prolific cosmopolitan Danish film director, and already in 2000 she said:\n\nI am very sceptical of the kind of new nationalism that insists that we must protect everything Danish. I don’t think Danish culture is in any way threatened. Cultures have to be strong enough to resist an encounter with other cultures. If they aren’t, then there’s no reason to sustain them. I am convinced that whatever is worth preserving in Danish culture easily can accommodate a significant degree of inspiration from, and interaction with, lots of other cultures (Bier in Hjort and Bondebjerg 2000: 243).\n\nMulticultural reality in Scandinavian cinema: Fenar Ahmad\n\nFenar Ahmad is by now one of the most prolific new Danish directors with another background than Danish. He was born in Czechoslovakia in 1981 by Iraqi parents that were communists and had to flee from Saddam Hussein. He came to Denmark in 1986 and went through the usual procedure from asylum to a gradual status as part of the Danish society, but with experience from some of the ghetto areas in and around Copenhagen. This is clearly reflected in his films, and in an interview we made with him this year, he has described the feeling of being both inside and outside society, and his difficult entrance into the Danish film culture:\n\nWhen I was together with film people, I was the only immigrant. When I was together with my buddies from the old neighbourhood, I was the only one making art. I did not know how to mix the two worlds because they seemed like parallel universes out of touch with each other (…) You can feel terribly lonesome when you have a different background and arrives at a new place in your life. There are some experiences only you have at the table you have arrived at (Fenar Ahmand, interviewd by Ib and Ulla Bondebjerg 2017).\n\nWhat Ahmah’s films, documentaries and feature films bring to Danish cinema, is a stronger creative diversity based on the fact he brings a new perspective, new experiences and a partly new film language into the pubic sphere. Like many of his fellow directors – with a similar migrant background – he stands by his life experiences as an outsider entering Danish cinema, but at the same time he denounces the term migrant cinema. I the same interview he declares in an almost manifesto-like statement:\n\n[My two feature films] Underverden/Darkland and Ækte vare/Flow are a part of Danish culture, they are not immigrant art. Such films will be a vital and central part of our film culture and make us, who represent something new to an integrated part of Danish culture. We are smashing the culture of victimization.\n\nLooking through his films so far, we see a clear trend in his film themes and way of making films, which goes directly against the ways in which Danish culture and identity has been defined in public discourse. Ahmad’s notion of Danish culture is an open, cosmopolitan definition of being Danish. One of his first films, the documentary, Nice to meet you (2007), is a critical portrait of the way the system treats asylum seekers. It is a portrait of a Danish apartheid system, where the Danish army has participated in the bombing of the homeland of these asylum seekers, who a waiting for years without getting a permanent permit to stay – and who we then say can return to their home country marked by total disaster. As he has said in the interview: “While Danish soldiers and tanks were at war in their homeland, we still pretend they could be sent back. I speak Arabic and could communicate with them, but I had to go through my Danish producer to get permission.” In one of his other documentaries, How to be a perfect Muslim (2009), he satirically attacks the Danish integration policy. It seems that it is almost impossible in the system to become Danish enough.\n\nBut it is through his two feature films, Ækte vare/Flow (2014) and Underverden/Darkland (2017) he has reached a larger Danish and international audience. They are critical, inside stories from the ghettos, partly about the dreams and creative power hidden here, partly a critique of his own first and second generation migrants. Ahmad has called the first film a “social realist musical” and while being a social critique of tendencies in migrant communities, it is also a film about a young guy who makes his way to a music career. It is in many ways a film with autobiographical elements, since Ahmad has made it in the same way in film.\n\nUnderverden/Darkland on the other hand is a much more dark and dramatic film dealing with the same questions. In this film we have three versions of integration, three forms of Danish migrant culture within the same family. The main character in the film is Zaid, a successful heart surgeon in an expensive Copenhagen flat and with a pregnant Danish wife. His younger brother Yasin on the other hand has not really made it out of the ghetto and is caught up in crime and debt to the local gang boss. Then there is their father, stuck in nostalgia for the Arab culture he cannot return to, and basically chained to his sofa, not really a role model for his sons. The multicultural reality of a socially divided Denmark is portrayed close up and in a dark and critical way. When Zaid in the beginning of the films declines to help his younger brother Yasin, who is then brutally killed by the gang boss, he turns into the lonely revenger that kills at night, trying to uproot the gang ghetto. Eventually, off course, he ruins his own life. Do not take that way of the way of the gangs is Ahmad’s message.\n\nBut Ahmad has also said that his film is not per se about migrants. He uses his own experience to tell a more universal story, and in an interview in the Danish Newspaper Politiken (January 19 2017) he says:\n\nThe film is about the fact that colour doesn’t matter. The brown colour the media is trying to make into one character, I have blown to atoms. There is a Branco and an Ali, but they are different. In the film there is Dar, the best surgeon in Scandinavia. I have torn the picture of an immigrant apart. With my film I have blown integration to pieces.\n\nGlobalisation and multicultural diversity\n\nFenar Ahmad’s films are not co-productions, they a produced for and about a multicultural Danish culture, and they are – together with a growing new generation of similar directors in all Scandinavian countries- part of a global transformation, a move towards a broader multicultural diversity. In Sweden we have Josef Fares with for instance Jalla! Jalla (2000) or Zozo (2005), and in Norway we have Kahlid Hussein’s Import/Export (2005), Halwkawt Mustafa’s Red Heart (2011) or Hisham Zaman’s Befor Snowfall (2013) (See Leif Ove Larsen 2015).\n\nFilms like this have mostly circulated in national spaces, but they have also gained some international profile through festivals and online. But it is worth noticing that for instance Jalla! Jalla sold 1.5 million tickets in cinema, half of that outside Sweden. In a sense this indicates that directors with a migrant background have a distribution profile quite similar to most European art films. This picture change somewhat if we look at more established Scandinavian art film directors that have contributed with film about globalisation and the multicultural reality, for instance Danish Susanne Bier, Swedish Lukas Moodysson and Finnish Aki Kaurismäki. Looking at the profile of their films, we see the impact of co-production kicking in. Generally we do not see big box office figures but rather an accumulation of smaller figures in a number of European countries. But one has to add the non-theatrical data to their success, figures that are however harder to get. But even without those figures, we see the fragmentation of European cinema.\n\nSusanne Bier has won Oscar, European Film award and Golden Globe, and if we look at the three films in her global trilogy Brothers (2004), After the Wedding (2006) and In a better world (2010) the total number of cinema tickets in Europe comes to 3.380.179, or an average of almost 1.2 million. The films are made in co-productions between DK/GB/NO/SE, DK/GB and DK/SE and DE, so SCAN-EU co-production. The films deal with globalisation in the sense that the narrative is built on a connection between a non-national global problem and how that affects or is linked to a national family story. In Brothers it is the war in Aghanistan, in After the Wedding it is poverty in India and in In a better world it is about civil war in Africa, revenge and personal ethics. Her films are, she has said herself about the national loss of innocence because globalisation now affects us all. We can no longer live as if our national space was a small protected space.\n\nIn many ways, it is some of the same themes we find in Lukas Moodysson’s films, especially Lilja 4-ever (2002, a SE-DK co-production or Mammoth (2009, a SE/DK/DE co-production). Whereas Lilja 4-ever deals with the decline and decay of Eastern Europe and Russia, Mammoth is a ambitious global film about the global elite and the personal consequences and consequences for others of the kind of life they live. It was however only seen by around 650.000 people in Europe and Lija 4-ever even less: 255.000.\n\nSo of the films I haven focused on here, Le Havre Aki Kaurismäki is in a way the most successful. Made as a co-production between FI/FR/DE about the migrant and refugee crisis, this sometimes rather surreal drama-comedy was seen by more that 2 million in Europe, with pretty solid attendance in Germany, France and Italy, and the film is in French. The film is in the typical style of Kaurismäki, a magic realism where things appear to happen despite the bleak realism and life most of the characters are living. The films is the embodiment of a cosmopolitan, humanist attitude towards globalisation and the multicultural society. Ordinary people seem to make things happen that defy the political climate in Europe. In Kaurismäki’s films people take action and responsibility. The film is part of a planned trilogy about globalisation and the challenges of our multicultural Europe, and with the second film in this trilogy, The other side of hope (2017) the story is moved to Helsinki with Syrian refugees at the centre in a similar story.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThere is no doubt that globalisation has influenced Scandinavian cinema profoundly and that the impact has increased since 1990. Established directors have taken up the challenge and expanded their stories to themes that reflect globalisation and the multicultural reality, at the same time the film culture as such has developed new models of transnational cooperation. The official policy of the Scandinavian film institutes and film companies often challenge and go against the growing nationalism in parts of the political landscape.\n\nThe multicultural reality of society is also increasingly being reflected in the integration of film directors with a diversity of national and other ethnic backgrounds. The de facto global and multicultural reality we live in already is becoming visible through the kinds of films, the kinds of themes and the broader perspectives now entering the Scandinavian film culture. The way Scandinavians imagine the community they live in is likely to change by the cultural encounters with reality that the new and more global cinema offers.\n\nWhat takes place in Scandinavia also takes place in many other European countries, and co-production between European countries have certainly developed in a positive way. However, if the strength of European cinema is it creative diversity, the weakness is its fragmentation, the fact that cinema and television is not traveling near as much as for instance UK and US cinema. The new digital possibility of getting things out there has so far also turned out to be the digital challenge. The new transnational digital European streaming service is American (Netflix, HBO and maybe soon also Amazon). Cinemas, festivals, even television is no longer enough – we need a new transnational European revolution."
