In some cases, socio-economic scholarships will be awarded.\n\nHow can I apply for a scholarship?\n\nAn application for a scholarship on a socio-economic background should be submitted to the camp director, Dr. Yossi Cohen, directly to his email coheny@technion.ac.il\n\nHow am I accepted to the camp?\n\nFill in the application form at /tomba/ and add a recommendation from your math teacher or any other character that can assess your math abilities. The interviews at the camp will take place During the months of May-June. About two weeks after the interview, you will receive an answer about your admission or non-admission to the camp. Sometimes students are not accepted in a particular year but are admitted in the following year. Therefore, even if you werenâ€™t accepted this year, you should try again next year ðŸ˜Š\n\nHow many students are accepted to the camp each year?\n\nBetween twenty and thirty students from all over the country and from abroad.\n\nhow do I pay?\n\nFour checks must be sent for a total of 500 NIS spread over four months by mail or transfer to the Technion bank account.\n\nI was accepted and paid but unfortunately, I will not be able to get to the camp.

Visits must be arranged in advance with the camp staff.\n\nWhere do you sleep during camp?\n\nIn the student dormitories at the Technion.\n\nWhere do I eat during the camp?\n\nIn the restaurants and cafes around the campus.\n\nThe camp is also suitable for SHOMREI MIZVOT?\n\nThe camp makes sure that anyone who wants, loves math, and has the appropriate mathematical knowledge and background can participate. All restaurants are kosher under the supervision of the Technion rabbi. The strict adherence to kashrut applies to all the food eaten during the camp and not only in the cafes and restaurants on campus. The camp schedule is designed to allow prayer three times a day during the camp. For any problem, request or question please contact the camp director.\n\nWhat is the difference between a COMBA and a TOMBA?\n\nKomba is a summer camp in Combinatorics and Graph Theory and is a continuation camp for the Tomba camp. The Komba Camp is intended for students who have graduated from the Tomba Camp and/or have a suitable mathematical background."
