        "text": "Executive Director: Sanchali Banerjee\n\nSanchali is a senior at TJHSST. Her interest in helping girls increase their knowledge and experience in STEM led her to volunteer at Girls Who Math to teach STEM courses and eventually join the executive team. She has taught multiple computer science and competitive math courses at Girls Who Math. Sanchali is involved in various STEM competitions and activities along with other tutoring initiatives. In her free time, Sanchali enjoys playing piano, dancing, and reading.\n\nVolunteer Coordinator: Cailyn Oh\n\nCailyn is a junior at TJHSST. She became interested in joining the Girls Who Math Team after noticing that only few girls participated in many of the STEM clubs at her school. With her passion in teaching and working with kids, she wants to spread more awareness in educating girls on math and science. Cailyn likes to play the flute, listen to music, and watch Netflix in her free time.\n\nPrograms Director: Navya Tuteja\n\nNavya, a sophomore at TJHSST, has a deep passion for tutoring and working with students. With much previous experience as a tutor, she is committed to elevating Girls Who Math and wants to increase female participation in STEM clubs at her school and within her community. Her passion for teaching and working with kids has pushed her to help spread more awareness for educating young girls on math and science. In her free time, Navya loves to read a good book, listen to music, and watch TV!\n\nOutreach Director: Raina Gao\n\nRaina is a sophomore at TJHSST. She participates in many STEM clubs and competitions, along with volunteering for non-profits focused on STEM education. She has noticed the gender disparities in STEM activity participation and is dedicated to decreasing this gap. She hopes to expand the impact of Girls Who Math and encourage girls to pursue STEM fields. Raina loves to listen to music and watch TV shows in her free time.\n\nSocial Media Manager: Minati Divakar\n\nMinati is a sophomore at TJHSST. Her father has taught her and her younger sister math for as long as she can remember, so she was excited to join a volunteering organization that does the very same! She hopes to utilize her experience in digital art and social media to bring more students to Girls Who Math. In her free time (when sheâ€™s not doom scrolling), she talks to her friends and bikes outside."
