        "text": "Daytime Emmy Award-winner Charles Dubin was born in New York City, and made his television directorial debut in 1951, with the series \"Two Girls Named Smith.\" He continued to direct several television series and made-for-TV movies in the 1950s with offerings such as science fiction anthology sereis \"Tales of Tomorrow,\" and the documentary \"Young People's Concerts: What Is American Music?\" It was during the 1960s that Dubin's career as a television director began to take off; he started the decade by directing five episodes of the legal drama \"The Defenders\" before earning his first taste of critical acclaim with the made-for-TV movie \"Cinderella\" in 1965. With more series in the 1960s, he continued into the 1970s by directing some of his most popular and notable work. Dubin oversaw episodes of \"Kojak,\" \"Hawaii Five-O,\" and the American classic \"M.A.S.H.,\" for which he earned three Emmy Award nominations. In 1979, he directed the second television installment of the \"Roots\" mini-series before directing several episodes of crime drama series like \"Murder, She Wrote\" and \"Matlock\" in the mid-1980s. Dubin was also credited as a director and producer of the influential, preteen sketch comedy series \"Square One TV\" in 1985, which helped teach mathematics to young viewers using various musical parodies and skits. The success of the program produced a spinoff series in 1987 entitled \"Mathnet.\" Dubin retired in 1991, and died of natural causes 20 years later, aged 92."
