SprialMath is a Beta project and is being tested by a few teachers.\n\nWould you like us to notify you when it is ready for wider use?\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human:\n\nLearning expert (mathematics, foreign languages); web developer; database administrator. Alfred is a skilled full-stack web developer; expert in PHP, Python, JavaScript, CSS, and many frameworks. He prefers to work on education projects where he adds value beyond the computer technology. He developed a web-based sandbox and showcase system for the education program ThinkQuest, which supplied STEM activities and contests for students. http://wayback.archive it.org/3635/20140211214957/http://www.thinkquest.org/pls/html/think.library For the Sloan Foundation, he developed the information architecture and conducted training sessions for math and science professional societies to launch the Sloan Careers In Science program, which led to a repository (http://www.careercornerstone.org/) of information about 150 scientific and technical careers. Alfred founded and oversaw a disaster relief project following the March 2011 earthquake-tsunami in the Tohoku / Kanto region of Japan. The nonprofit’s accomplishments can be seen at https://www.facebook.com/OperationThunderstick\n\n— Experienced science teacher (high school chemistry, physics, computer science); science magazine editor (founding editor of Chem Matters Magazine, which he grew to a paid circulation of 52,000 in six nations); developer of curriculum software. Robson developed the online system edPlans.com which hosts curriculum and lesson plans for schools and teachers; has been adopted by the Core Knowledge Foundation.\n\nMathematics teaching/learning expert.

Mills was Coordinator of Mathematics at Harford County Public Schools, Maryland; worked with University of Delaware preparing a national math SSI curriculum; and was Mathematics Supervisor for the state of Delaware. Mills has managed math curriculum projects in Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New York, Virginia, Wisconsin, Washington, and California. His curriculum projects focused on standards, instruction, and assessment, especially using data to inform instruction. Mills wrote a complete mathematics curriculum for grades K through high school; his printed curriculum has been used in dozens of school districts in several states. He is supervising the mathematics content of SpiralMath.\n\nInstructional systems strategist; educational television producer; expert in consumer-facing educational systems. During a 20-year career at the BBC, Mudge produced and directed science documentary programs; supported the BBC Computer literacy project — producing films and TV programs so young people could learn to program one of the earliest personal computers (the BBC Micro). Mudge was chief architect for the BBC Learning Station, an interactive learning service for children, parents and teachers; also developed “Result” (Granada TV) for the UK Department of Education, an online learning and broadcast TV system for 14- 16 year old children study math and science GCSE level at school and home (https://youtu.be/E1TMnDiB-eo ).
