        "text": "\"I chose NetMath because I was looking for a self-paced Linear Algebra course that would grant transferable credits upon completion. The first few weeks of the course were honestly pretty daunting in terms of getting used to Mathematica and trying to understand the course material. However, after learning the syntax and completing the assignments for the first two lessons, things get much clearer from thereon and you'll start to appreciate the way the lessons are presented. This is especially true because most of the concepts you'll learn will be supplemented with a lot of visualizations which I thought was the single best thing about this course. I would say the difficulty of this course is fair, provided you keep up with the material and do all the assignments. Overall, I'd say I enjoyed this course and I'd recommend it to other students who are looking for a reasonably challenging course that would allow them to work on their own pace.\" ~ Abdul N."
