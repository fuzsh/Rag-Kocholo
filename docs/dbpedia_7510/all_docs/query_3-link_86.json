        "text": "Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz's military record has been under scrutiny since he was announced as Kamala Harris's running mate.\n\nHistoric accusations made by some veterans have been revived by his opposite number, Republican JD Vance, who himself served in the military.\n\nMr Vance says that Mr Walz intentionally avoided combat in Iraq by resigning shortly before his unit was deployed there, and that he has been dishonest about his role in the military.\n\nWe’ve looked into his record and the military service of Mr Vance.\n\nMr Vance claimed: “When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him.”\n\nSeveral former National Guard colleagues have previously publicly voiced frustrations at Mr Walz’s decision to leave their unit before deployment to Iraq - but others have rejected assertions that he retired to avoid combat duty.\n\nMr Walz served for 24 years in the Army National Guard, a military force which is usually deployed within the US to respond to events such as natural disasters, but is also part of the US Army’s reserve.\n\nIn February 2005, while he was still in the National Guard, Mr Walz filed an application to run to be elected as a member of Congress from Minnesota.\n\nThe following month it was announced that there would be “a possible partial mobilisation of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard” to Iraq within the next two years, according to a 2005 press release from Mr Walz’s congressional campaign.\n\nIn the statement, Mr Walz said: “I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilisation.”\n\nHe added: “I don’t want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race.\"\n\nMr Walz then retired from the National Guard in May 2005, which he later said was so he could focus fully on running for Congress.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly when he submitted his resignation notice. We’ve asked both the National Guard and the Harris campaign when this was.\n\nHis National Guard unit received orders to mobilise for Iraq in July 2005, and was sent there in March 2006, according to the battalion’s history page.\n\nMr Vance also says Mr Walz made “dishonest” claims about serving in combat.\n\nHe referred to a video promoted by the Harris campaign of Mr Walz talking about gun control.\n\nIn the clip, from 2018, he said that he \"carried weapons in war\".\n\nOn 9 August, the Harris campaign issued a statement saying that “in making the case for why weapons of war should never be on our streets or in our classrooms, the Governor misspoke”.\n\nMr Walz went to Italy with the National Guard in 2003 as part of support for the US war in Afghanistan - but he was never deployed to an active war zone.\n\nOn 13 August, Mr Walz responded directly to his critics, recalling that he'd joined the National Guard aged 17: \"I served for the next 24 years for the same reason all my brothers and sisters do, we love this country. Then in 2005 I felt the call of duty again, this time giving service to my country in the halls of Congress.\""
