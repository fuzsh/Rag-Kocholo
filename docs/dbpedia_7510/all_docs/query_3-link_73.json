        "text": "Colonel-in-Chief: His Majesty King Charles III, King of Canada\n\nBadge\n\nDescription\n\nGules a coronet of crosses patté and fleurs-de-lis Or jewelled and resting on a band of ermine proper enfiled by three ostrich feathers Argent their tips interlaced with a scroll Azure fimbriated and inscribed ICH DIEN in letters Or, all within a garter Azure fimbriated buckled and inscribed HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE in letters Or between two scrolls Azure inscribed in chief NEC ASPERA TERRENT and in base READY AYE READY in letters Or environed in the flanks by autumnal maple leaves proper, the whole upon a diamond-cut star Or ensigned by the Royal Crown proper and resting upon a scroll Gules fimbriated and inscribed THE ROYAL REGIMENT OF CANADA in letters Or.\n\nSymbolism\n\nThe badge is derived from the badges of The Royal Grenadiers and The Toronto Regiment, which were amalgamated in 1936 to form the regiment. The maple leaves represent service to Canada, and the Crown, service to the Sovereign. The star, a customary infantry badge shape from the 19th century, was taken from the badge of The Royal Grenadiers. The garter, with the motto \"HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE\", is that of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.\n\nFrom The Toronto Regiment was taken the central device. During the Hundred Years' War, Edward the Black Prince, the first Prince of Wales (eldest son of Edward III), defeated the Count of Luxembourg and King of Bohemia (eldest son of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry VII), at the Battle of Crécy. After the battle, the prince adopted the three white ostrich plumes from the crest of his defeated foe as the badge of the heir apparent. He also adopted the dead king's motto \"ICH DIEN\" (I serve).\n\n\"THE ROYAL REGIMENT OF CANADA\"\" is the regimental title.\"NEC ASPERA TERRENT\", from The Toronto Regiment, and \"READY AYE READY\", from The Royal Grenadiers, are the mottoes of the regiment. The first motto was taken from their former allied regiment The King's Regiment, now, through amalgamation, the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment.\n\nMotto\n\nREADY AYE READY and NEC ASPERA TERRENT (And difficulties do not daunt)\n\nMarch\n\n\"British Grenadiers\" followed by \"Here's to the Maiden\"\n\nAlliance\n\nBritish Army\n\nDuke of Lancaster's Regiment\n\nAustralian Army\n\nThe Royal Victoria Regiment\n\nBattle honours\n\nNorth West Rebellion\n\nFISH CREEK; BATOCHE; NORTH WEST CANADA, 1885.\n\nSouth African War\n\nSOUTH AFRICA, 1899-1900.\n\nThe First World War\n\nYPRES, 1915, '17; Gravenstafel; St. Julien; FESTUBERT, 1915; MOUNT SORREL; SOMME, 1916, '18; Pozières; Flers Courcelette; Ancre Heights; ARRAS, 1917, '18; Vimy, 1917; Arleux; Scarpe, 1917, '18; HILL 70; Passchendaele; AMIENS; Drocourt-Quéant; HINDENBURG LINE; Canal du Nord; Cambrai, 1918; PURSUIT TO MONS; FRANCE AND FLANDERS, 1915-'18.\n\nThe Second World War\n\nDieppe; BOURGUÉBUS RIDGE; Faubourg de Vaucelles; Verrières Ridge-Tilly-la-Campagne; FALAISE; Falaise Road; Clair Tizon; Forêt de la Londe; Dunkirk, 1944; THE SCHELDT; Woensdrecht; South Beveland; THE RHINELAND; Goch Calcar Road; The Hochwald; Xanten; Twente Canal; Groningen; Oldenburg; NORTH WEST EUROPE, 1942, 1944 1945.\n\nSouth-West Asia\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n\nLineage\n\nThis Reserve Force regiment originated on 14 March 1862 and incorporates the following regiments.\n\nThe Royal Regiment of Canada originated in Toronto, Ontario on 14 March 1862, when 'The 10th Battalion Volunteer Militia Rifles, Canada' was authorized to be formed.Footnote 1 It was redesignated: 'The 10th Battalion Volunteer Militia (Infantry), Canada' on 21 November 1862;Footnote 2 'Tenth or \"Royal Regiment of Toronto Volunteers\"' on 10 April 1863;Footnote 3 '10th Battalion \"Royal Grenadiers\"' on 5 August 1881;Footnote 4 '10th Regiment \"Royal Grenadiers\"' on 8 May 1900;Footnote 5 and 'The Royal Grenadiers' on 1 May 1920.Footnote 6 On 15 December 1936, it was amalgamated with 'The Toronto Regiment' (see below) and redesignated 'The Royal Regiment of Toronto Grenadiers'.Footnote 7 It was redesignated: 'The Royal Regiment of Canada' on 11 February 1939;Footnote 8 '2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Canada' on 7 November 1940;Footnote 9 and 'The Royal Regiment of Canada' on 31 December 1945.Footnote 10\n\nNotes:\n\nUpon redesignation as The Royal Grenadiers on 1 May 1920 (see above), it was organized as a three battalion regiment with the 1st Battalion (58th Battalion, CEF) on the Non Permanent Active Militia order of battle and the 2nd Battalion (123rd Battalion, CEF) and 3rd Battalion (198th Battalion, CEF) on the Reserve order of battle.\n\nThe Royal Grenadiers were disbanded for the purpose of reorganization on 15 December 1920 and reorganized the same day (GO 30/21).
