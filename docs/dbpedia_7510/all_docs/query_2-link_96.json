        "text": "For AIF Infantry Brigade HQ patches see Australian Infantry Unit Colour Patches 1921-1949\n\nBy mid December 1939 a decision had been taken that the infantry battalions of the 6th Aust. Division would adopt the colour patch of their corresponding numbered battalion of the old AIF, superimposed on a background of battleship grey. ( Minute, Secretary of the Military Board, dated 21.12.1939. AA(Vic): MP 508/1, item 36/756/2.) As this division was organized on the old establishment of three brigades, each of four battalions, the original system of brigade and battalion colours could be used without modification.\n\nIn February 1940 however, following the decision to form the 7th Division, and to organize both divisions on the British establishment of three battalions per brigade, it no longer became possible to adhere to the original scheme, particularly in relation to continuity of numbering of units.\n\nThe 7th Division was allocated a diamond; thus the 19th Aust. Infantry Brigade, as the senior brigade of the 7th Division, was allotted a green diamond, its three battalions, the 2/4th, 2/8th and 2/12th, being allotted black, purple and brown over the green to identify them as the first, second and third battalions of the 'first' brigade of the 'second' division of the Second AIF. This system was extended to the 8th Division when approval was given for its formation in May 1940.\n\nWhile this was a logical system of identification from the military point of view, and was in fact the basis on which the whole colour patch system was designed from its inception in 1915, the Military Board failed to take into account the immense desire of the new Second AIF units to identify themselves completely with their corresponding numbered battalion of the original AIF. It is evident that while some units recognized the reasoning behind the initial allocation of their particular colour patch, others simply assumed that an error had been made.\n\nThe history of the 2/16th Battalion records that \"The form of the original patch had been decided on the basis of establishment .... being the second battalion of the brigade and the brigade being the second [sic] (At the time this colour patch was allotted, the 21st Brigade was actually the third brigade of the division. It became the second brigade circa August 1940.) of the division, the original colours were a purple triangle over a blue triangle, thus forming a diamond (1, 000 Men at War, Uren, p. 21.) The 15th Battalion AIF Association were not quite so considerate in referring to the purple and red diamond being worn by the 2/15th Battalion, and in a letter to the Minister for the Array on the matter stated that the battalion was wearing the wrong colour patch and, \"Members ... consider that this is a slight on the original Battalion..\". (Letter, Senator W.J. Cooper, to Brigadier, the Hon. G.A. Street, dated 4.8.1940. AA(Vic): MP 508/1, item 36/756/63. The former 15th Battalion Association, the 'Angels Remembrance Club', was even more vitriolic after the adoption of the 'T' shaped colour patch by the 2/15th Battalion in late 1942.)\n\nConsiderable representation was made by units, and former AIF unit associations, to both the Military Board and prominent Members of Parliament for the introduction of a system which would allow 2nd AT infantry battalions to wear the same colour patch as was worn by the corresponding numbered battalion of the old AIF. On 19.8.1940, consequent on the tabling of the matter in Federal Parliament, the Military Board considered a proposal that 2nd AIF battalions wear the colour patch of the corresponding numbered battalion of the original AIF superimposed on a grey background in the shape of the division to which the battalion belonged. The adoption of the revised system, at an estimated\n\ncost of 1,000 Pounds, was agreed to by the Military Board, and the concurrence of the GOC 2nd\n\nAIF, then in the Middle East, was received on 4.9.1940.\n\nIt would appear that the primary consideration for the revision of the scheme was that of sentiment, both from the point of view of the public and returned services associations, and the units themselves. It was also pointed out that regimental colours carried the unit colour patch, and that if another patch was allotted some difficulty in relation to this might arise after the war. The most telling point however was made by the Adjutant-General, who stated that the system in use had already broken down due to the re-allotment of battalions within divisions which had occurred. He considered that it was not essential that the colours of the battalions within a division be uniform, formation affiliation being indicated by the shape of the grey background, which would be that of the division to which the unit was allocated.\n\nThe earliest reference to the adoption of the new scheme appears to be a memo dated 13.9.1940 from the Minister of the Army advising that it was being prepared. The first authority in regard to the matter has not been located by myself, however an AHQ memo dated 30.9.1940, to HQ Southern Command in relation to the colour patch approved for the 2/40th Battalion, states that action was then being taken to ensure that the colour patches of units of the old AIF were allotted to the corresponding numbered battalion of the new Force, (AHQ(DPS) Memo No. 65386,30.9.1940. AA(Vic): MP 508/1, item 36/756/63.) while a memo dated 30.10.1940 on the same subject provides the following statement;\n\n\"... I am directed by the Master-General of the Ordnance to advise that the distinguishing colour patches of all infantry battalions of the 2nd A.I.F. will be the colour patch of the original A.I.F. Battalion, superimposed upon a light battleship grey background. This background being of the present Divisional shape.\" (ibid, AHQ(DOS) Memo No. 72347, 30.10.1940.)\n\nWhile no reference is made to the use of a half size patch of the old AEF battalion on a full size grey background in these memos, it is evident from associated correspondence that this was the original intention. An MGO minute dated 5.9.1940 states that arrangements could be made for future issues in this format, and suggests that it include those issued to battalions of the 6th Aust. Division to retain uniformity throughout the force. Patches for units other than infantry battalions and infantry brigade headquarters would not be affected, and full size patches already in stock for brigade headquarters would continue to be issued until those stocks were exhausted. Brigade headquarters were to retain the green, red and light blue colour system to denote their seniority within the division.\n\nWhile no formal authority appears to have been promulgated prior to 30.10.1940, it is apparent that several units began changing to the new scheme well before this; the history of the 2/16th Battalion records that their new colour patches were issued on 9.10.1940, in time for their final march through Perth the following day. It was not however until early 1941 that all battalions received their quotas of the new colour patches.\n\nPatches to the new designs, including those for units of the 6th Division, were manufactured and issued in Australia to units which had not proceeded overseas, or to reinforcements for units which were already serving overseas, (see note 125) several changes being required when the organization of divisions in the Middle East was altered in February 1941. In the Middle East however there seems to have been little effort by units to conform with the provisions of AHQ Memo No. 72347, regardless of the formation to which they belonged.\n\nNote 125. It was the practice to allot reinforcements to units of the AIF as required when they were drafted to training battalions in Australia. They were issued the colour patch of the unit to which they would subsequently belong during their period with the training battalion. AA(Vic): MP 508/1, 36/756/103.\n\nThus fifteen battalions retained colour patches approved under the old system, while others made no attempt to change the shape of the background on transfer from one formation to another. In extreme cases members of some battalions may be seen wearing two different shaped grey backgrounds, i.e. members on the strength of a unit prior to its transfer from one division to another retained the background shape of their previous formation, while reinforcements who had joined the unit from Australia after it had changed formation were wearing backgrounds in the shape of the new formation which had been approved and issued in Australia.\n\nThe situation was never resolved in a satisfactory manner, and following the return of the 6th and 7th Divisions to Australia in early 1942, GRO 36/1942, dated 22.5.1942, directed that where complete AIF units were transferred to a new formation they would not change their colour patch.\n\nThe 9th Aust. Division, faced with an identical situation during its extended stay in the Middle East, resolved the matter by designing a completely new shape, and reverting to the basis of the original system adopted in December 1939, i.e. green, red and light blue for each of its brigades; black, purple, and in this case white, identifying the first, second and third battalions of each brigade.\n\nAlthough the new designs did not conform to the colour patches borne by corresponding battalions of the old AIF, and were not initially readily accepted within some units for that reason, they came to represent the pride these units took in their own achievements in the Middle East and later the South West Pacific Area. The extent to which this pride was fostered might be best illustrated by the 2/15th Battalion, the members of which, following a bitter campaign by the 15th Battalion AIF Association for the restoration of the brown over dark blue colours to the battalion, overwhelmingly indicated their desire to retain their 'T' shaped green and purple colour patch not six months after they were first issued. For the 2/13th Battalion,\n\n\"The..['T' shaped colour patch] .... soon became accepted as warmly as if the Unit had been enlisted under it..,,. (Benghazi to Borneo, Fearnside, Second Edition, p. 3 10.)\n\nIt may well be that, had colour patches to the original system based on seniority within the brigade and division been first designed and issued overseas in 1940, and the units been engaged in active operations soon afterwards, the same affection for, and pride in their colour patch, regardless that it might not have represented the original AlF battalion, might have developed amongst battalions other than those of the 9th Division. After all the 2/3 1st, 2/33rd, and for a period the 2/32nd, Battalions, improvised from personnel of all Arms in 1940, never appeared to have any difficulty in identifying with their 'original system' colour patches, which throughout the war identified them simply as the first, second and third battalions of the second brigade of the 'fourth' division of the Second AIF, although the majority of the war was spent as the third brigade of the 7th Division.\n\n913. 2/1st Aust.

This patch was superseded by No. 980 in October 1940.\n\n980. 2/25th Aust. Infantry Battalion, 1940-1946: Approved in October 1940 but not issued until mid December. It will be noted that the colour patch chart included as Appendix 4 of To Benghazi, by Gavin Long, shows a diamond shaped grey background to this colour patch in the First Edition. Later reprints have been corrected to show a circular background.\n\n981. 2/25th Aust. Infantry Battalion: While there is some doubt regarding the authenticity\n\nof the only example seen to date, the design itself was tentatively approved for the battalion until early October 1940, when its parent brigade (the 24th) was transferred to the 9th Division. On the basis that it was not until November 1940 that the initial order for the supply of patches to units of 24th Brigade was submitted to the CCF, it is unlikely that this patch was ever officially manufactured or issued.\n\n982. 2/26th Aust. Infantry Battalion, 1940-1945: Raised on 17.10.1940 and was captured\n\nin Singapore in February 1942. Although HQ 8th Aust.

Infantry Battalion, 1940-1946: Raised in the United Kingdom on 26.6.1940 and was redesignated on 28.10.1940. Disbanded in February 1946. This colour patch was issued in the UK in 1940 without reference to AHQ.\n\n992. 2/31st Aust. Infantry Battalion: Approved in October 1940 and issued only in\n\nAustralia to unit reinforcements. Superseded by No. 991 in the Middle East. CCF and\n\nat least one other supplier noted.\n\n993. 71st Aust. Infantry Battalion, 1940:\n\n2/32nd Aust.

The first order for the supply of this colour patch was placed on 1.8.1940 (MGO Order No. 496). Superseded by No. 1001 in October 1940.\n\n1001. 2/40th Aust. Infantry Battalion, 1940-1945: The battalion history (Doomed Battalion, Peter Henning, p. 15.) states that this colour patch was issued in early August 1940, however this is considered unlikely, as the battalion themselves did not raise the issue with HQ Southern Command until late August, and approval for No. 1001 was not communicated to\n\nthem until 30.10.1940. The first batch of 550 pairs was air freighted to Tasmania on 3.12.1940.\n\n1002.2/43rd Aust. Infantry Battalion, 1940: Raised on 1.7.1940, disbanded in January 1946.

Infantry Battalion: The only example of this colour patch noted to date is a reproduction, however this design was accepted for the battalion prior to early October 1940, when it transferred to the 9th Division. It is shown for collectors interest, although there is no evidence that it was ever manufactured or issued.\n\n1006. 2/44th Aust. Motor Battalion: Ref. AHQ(DOS) Memo No. 14520, 7.3.1941.

Infantry Brigade Group for occupation duties in Japan, recruiting from units already serving in the South West Pacific Area. In late 1948 these battalions were directed to cease wearing colour patches and to replace them with woven titles bearing the Roman numerals 'LXV', 'LXVI' and 'LXVII' in gold on a maroon ground. The 65th, 66th, and 67th Aust. Infantry Battalions were redesignated the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions, The Australian Regiment, on 23.11.1948, becoming part of the Australian Regular Army, and were designated the Royal Australian Regiment on 10.3.1949.\n\n1016. 65th Aust.

Still in existence as the 3rd Battalion RAR. Former members of BCOF, Japan, recall that the first sick and wounded personnel of this battalion returning from Korea in 1950 were still wearing this colour patch on the puggaree of the khaki felt hat.\n\n1019. 67th Aust. Infantry Battalion, 1948-1949: Shoulder title adopted as a result of an\n\nAHQ directive in late 1948. It was intended to replace No. 10 18, but did not entirely,\n\ninstead being worn on the sleeve head on both arms of the shirt and jacket, with the\n\ncolour patch being retained on the left arm of the jacket. As far as is known this unit\n\nwas the only one to adopt this form of title, the other two battalions arriving back in\n\nAustralia in December 1948. Examples appear with either yellow or white embroidered lettering, or gold wire lettering which was locally supplied in Japan.\n\nParachute Battalion\n\n1020. 1st Aust.
