        "text": "I went into the big army camp at Seymour. They had had a lot of rain and there was mud everywhere. Men had to sleep on the ground on gum leaves. There was a lot of sickness and I became ill. I had a very bad throat and I had to come to Melbourne. We had some training at Broadmeadows. I was put into what was called the Tenth of the Sixth Reinforcements. The Sixth Battalion was in the First Division of the AIF. While I was in the Tenth of the Sixth I got the measles. It was about 3 weeks before I got back to the camp at Broadmeadows again. The Tenth of the Sixth had already left for overseas. I called up the Office of Reinforcements but they had no record of me at all. So I went down to the Orderly Tent where the Tenth of the Sixth Reinforcements had been. In the tent were my attestation papers. If I’d left the Army there and then there would have been no record of me at all. But I wanted to do my duty I suppose, so I took the papers to the Reinforcements Headquarters in Broadmeadows. I was put in a reserves company which was formed to accommodate those waiting to be more permanently placed. One of our duties in the reserve company was to act as markers for shooting practice at the Williamstown Rifle Range. One day while we were there Colonel Tivey interviewed us. He was looking for some more men to fill up the 31st Battalion. It appears that the two companies, A and B, came down from Queensland. The original 31st Battalion consisted of two companies from Queensland (A and and two from Victoria (C and D). On the way down from Queensland some 50 or more went AWL. Rather than looking for them they wanted to fill up with Victorians. Colonel Tivey interviewed all the markers personally and asked them their army history. I was one selected and taken into the 31st Battalion and given an original number 344.\n\nWe did some training in that Battalion and on November 9 we sailed out of Port Phillip Bay on the “Wandilla”, a boat of 9-10,000 tons that belonged to the Adelaide Steamship Company. On the boat was a full Battalion, over 1000 men. We sailed for Fremantle. I was a very poor sailor and became very sea-sick as soon as we got out of the bay and was sick more or less all the way to Fremantle.\n\nAt Fremantle we were allowed off the boat for a day. Some went up as far as Perth but I stayed about Fremantle. We were to be back by six or seven o’clock to go aboard, but only about 50 of us turned up at that hour. We were formed into an army picket, put in charge of an officer, and sent off to look for the missing soldiers in Fremantle. Some had been thirsty and had had a whale of a time. It was about midnight before we got most of them back on board. The next day we sailed for Port Suez. We didn’t have cabins but were given hammocks in the cargo holds. I didn’t sleep in my hammock the whole way. It was hot and I was too sick. I slept on deck when it was warm weather. Altogether I had a poor trip.\n\nWe disembarked at Port Suez and went by train to Heliopoulos where we stayed a short time. Then we were sent to the Suez Canal area. Earlier in the war the Turks had attacked the Canal and some had got across. It was expected they may attack again so as part of our training we were sent on to the Canal. We were part of the 8th Brigade consisting of about 5000 men. One place we were at was a place called Ismailia.\n\nWe spent quite a time some 15 miles east of the Canal. It was very trying at times amongst the hills of sand. I remember once we had a sand storm for three days. The wind blew tents down and the cooks couldn’t light a fire. We were in Egypt about six months. During this time troops had been evacuated from Gallipoli to a camp in Egypt called El Kebir. We were in that camp for a while. Then they set about forming a new division, the 5th division, made up of the 8th Brigade and 14th and 15th Brigades. We went to France with the 5th Division. We sailed from Port Alexandra on the transport the “Horoato”, a New Zealand ship, on my birthday, June 16 in 1916. We disembarked at Marseilles and travelled by train to the north of France near Armentieres.\n\nAfter a little more training we went to the front line in what was called the Big Raid. The attacking force consisted of one division of Australian troops and one division of English troops. We went into action on July 19 and I was taken prisoner on July 20, so we weren’t long in France - only a matter of days, before I was in action and wounded. In the attack we were told the idea of the engagement was to go over to hold what we could take. This proved to be incorrect. The real reason had been to create a diversion for a much bigger offensive planned on the Somme. I was in the first wave that went over the top and got so far over we were caught in our own artillery fire. In fact the shrapnel now in my shoulder and hip came from our own guns. We had got about half a mile when I was hit. Men were affected differently by being in action. I didn’t seem to have any feelings.\n\nI was hit first in the shoulder by shrapnel which rendered my right arm incapable of doing anything. I discarded my rifle and hand grenades and started to crawl back through the long grass in the darkness which was lit up intermittently by German Very lights. I got between two machine guns, one German and one of ours. As a result I had to keep low down on the ground. One burst of fire caught me on the right side and I have a scar about 8-9 inches long where one bullet went in. The rest of the bullets cut my trousers right down to the knee. That was a pretty close call. We had gone over the top a little bit before sun down. I laid there all night with wounds to the shoulder, back and leg.\n\nDuring the night, the Germans came in our flanks and recaptured their trenches. Our fellows retired and left us to ourselves but I was unaware of it. During the night I must have passed out. When I woke it was broad daylight. Our side was directing their shellfire close by. A lump of dirt, thrown out by an exploding shell, hit me in the groin. I thought it was safe to move after the bombardment so I got up and made for the breastwork of a trench and climbed over it and found one of our machine gunners there. He was unwounded and unarmed. I got him to put my field dressing on my machine gun wound on my right side. There wasn’t enough dressing to cover the wound completely.\n\nFour o’clock that afternoon we were taken prisoner by a German NCO armed with a revolver. I had lost a lot of blood and was pretty thirsty. I was able to walk with the German NCO who delivered us to some officers who could speak English. We were given the task of carrying out a Lewis machine gun and I had to carry three or four magazines of ammunition. They hadn’t seen a Lewis gun before. It hadn’t been in use for long and was new to them. We walked what seemed to be a mile in a communication trench. By the time I had got out I was very thirsty. A German soldier gave me a drink and I showed him my wounds. He took me to an underground dressing station."
