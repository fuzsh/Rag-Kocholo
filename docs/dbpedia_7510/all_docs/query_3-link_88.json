Raised in the United Kingdom in June 1940, comprising the 70th, 71st, and 72nd Aust. Infantry Battalions.\n\nThis brigade was raised initially as an improvised formation from units and reinforcements of the 6th Aust. Division and corps troops diverted to the United Kingdom in June 1940. It became a permanent formation of the 2nd AIF in August 1940, and part of the 9th Aust. Division in October 1940. The colour patches allotted to the units of this brigade were approved, manufactured and issued in the United Kingdom without any reference to the Military Board in Australia, and with one exception continued to be worn for the duration of the war. It would appear that it was not until October 1943 that LHQ became fully aware that the patches being worn by these units' differed from those approved and issued in Australia from October 1940 onwards.\n\n827. HQ 25th Aust. Infantry Brigade: Distinguishing Colour Patches AMF A.I.F Units. Approved in October 1940 and manufactured by the CCF. Issued in Australia only, to reinforcements of brigade headquarters, and to the 25th Aust. Anti-Tank Company. Superseded by No. 826 in the Middle East.\n\n828. HQ 25th Aust. Infantry Brigade: MGO Branch Line Drawings, p.8. It has not been possible to establish whether this patch was ever issued or worn. The numerous examples of this design which exist in collections are in fact WA manufactured patches for AIF personnel of HQ 13th Aust. Infantry Brigade.\n\n829. HQ 26th Aust. Infantry Brigade, 1940-1942: Ref. HQ 1st Aust. Corps Minute dated 8.8.1940. Superseded by No. 831 in December 1942. Raised in 1940, comprising the 2/23rd, 2/24th, and 2/48th Aust. Infantry Battalions.\n\n830. HQ 26th Aust. Infantry Brigade:Variation of No. 829, CCF manufacture, and possibly, only issued in Australia. By late 1942 only stocks of No. 829 were held in the Middle East.\n\n831. HQ 26th Aust. Infantry Brigade, 1942-1945: Auth. GRO 225/1943, 12.3.1943.\n\n832. HQ 27th Aust. Infantry Brigade, 1940-1945: Ref. MGO Branch Line Drawings,p.8. HQ 8th Aust. Division was advised of this design on 23.11.1940, however it is unlikely that initial issue commenced before early 1941. Raised in 1940, comprising the 2/26th, 2/29th, and 2/30th Aust. Infantry Battalions, and was captured in Singapore in February 1942.\n\n833. HQ 28th Aust. Infantry Brigade, 1941-1943: Auth. AHQ(DOS) Memo No. 79775, 22.10.1941, and GRO 468/1943, 18.6.1943. The latter approval revised the previously approved size to 2 and 1/2 inches by I inch. Raised in 1941, comprising the 34th and 45th Battalions and Sydney University Regiment.\n\n834. HQ 29th Aust. Infantry Brigade, 1942-1945: Auth. AHQ(DOS) Memo No. 31694,\n\n29.3.1942, and GRO 468/1943, 18.6.1943. The latter approval reduced the previously approved size to 2 and 1/2 inches by I inch. Raised in 1941, comprising the 42nd and 47th Battalions.\n\n835. HQ 30th Aust. Infantry Brigade, 1942-1943: Auth. GRO 3 70/1942, 4.9.1942. The\n\nearliest decision to allot this colour patch was made in October 1941, prior to formation of the unit, and MGO Order No. 2531 was placed with the CCF for the initial supply on 10.6.1942. It is possible that examples exist as 3 inches by I and 1/2 inches in lieu of the approved size of 2 and 1/2 inches by I inch. Raised in 1941, comprising the 39th, 49th, and 53rd Battalions.\n\nHQ 31st Aust. Infantry Brigade, 1942: No colour patch allotted. Raised in January 1942 as part of the 1st Division, comprising the 1st and 45th Battalions.\n\nHQ 32nd Aust. Infantry Brigade, 1942: No colour patch allotted. Raised in February 1942 as part of Newcastle Covering Force, comprising the 33rd Battalion and 8th Garrison Battalion.\n\nHQ 33rd Aust. Infantry Brigade, 1945-1946: No colour patch allotted. Raised in September 1945 to command units reoccupying Ambon and Timor, comprising the 12th/40th, 63rd, and 64th Aust. Infantry Battalions.\n\n836. HQ 34th Aust. Infantry Brigade Group, 1945-1949: Auth. GRO 292/1945, 23.11.1945. Raised in October 1945 as part of the Australian Component, B.C.O.F., Japan, comprising the 65th, 66th, and 67th Aust. Infantry Battalions. Became part of the Australian Regular Army in 1947, subsequently forming the nucleus of HQ 1st Independent Infantry Brigade Group. Later became the 1st, 2nd & 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment\n\nInfantry Battalions of the Citizen Military Forces\n\nOn March 31st, 192 1, the eighty eight infantry battalions, five pioneer battalions, and affiliated Senior Cadet battalions, of the Citizen Military Forces were reorganized to form sixty infantry battalions, each carrying the designation of the former sixty active infantry battalions of the old AIF. In 1927 they were granted the battle honours of those AIF battalions, and since the end of the Second World have carried the battle honours awarded to 2nd AIF infantry battalions. One battalion was disbanded in 1925, another in 1926, and a further five in 1929. Further reductions were made from 1930 by linking pairs of battalions, and the number of active units fluctuated between forty four in 1930 and fifty eight in 1941, a 61st Battalion having been formed in 1938. The 62nd Battalion was raised at the end of 1942, however reductions in the number of active CMF battalions had begun in August 1942, and by the end of the Second World War only thirty two battalions remained, the majority of which had served overseas and been reclassified as (AIF). The 63rd and 64th Battalions were raised in late 1945, but all battalions had been disbanded by mid 1946. A total of thirty one of these units were re-raised from 1948, however they were reduced in 1960 with the introduction of the regimental system, and currently only fourteen battalions and one regional surveillance unit exist with links to those original sixty of 1921.\n\n(9th, 25th/49th, 31st and 42nd RQR, 51st FNQR, 1st/19th, 2nd/17th, 4th/3rd and 41st RNSWR, 5th/6th and 8th/7th RVR, 10th/27th RSAR, 11th/28th and 16th RWAR, and 12th/40th RTR.)\n\nNote: Unless otherwise stated, the authority for the colour patches of the 1st to 60th Battalions is Standing Orders for Clothing Part 111, 1922.\n\n837. 1st Battalion, 1921-1930, 1939-1942;\n\n1st/19th Battalion, 1930-1939;\n\n1st Aust.

Reorganized as 110th Aust. Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment RAA in February 1942, although it still appears in Regimental Lists and Manning Tables in March 1945. Attached as non-divisional troops to the 1st Division, hence the rectangular shape in University colours. On 1.9.1942 advice was received that the unit was no longer wearing a colour patch.\n\nHQ NSW L of C Area Training Depots Memo 14461, 1.9.1942. AA(NSW): SP 1008/1, item 415/1/831.\n\n904. Melbourne University Rifles, 1921-1948: Auth. SO Clothing Pt 111, 1922. Raised on\n\nan infantry battalion establishment at Melbourne University, although until 1935 one company was recruited from outside the University, generally Old Scholars from public schools such as Scotch, Wesley and Xavier Colleges, and Church of England Grammar School. The unit was attached as non-divisional troops to the 4th Division, and as such the CGS had approved, in August 1921, a circular patch, divided vertically, royal blue to the front and black to the rear. There is no evidence that this was ever issued, and the reasoning behind the vertical rectangle is not known. This unit still appears in Regimental Lists and Manning Tables of March 1945.\n\n905. New Guinea Volunteer Rifles, 1942: Auth. GRO 370/1942, 4.9.1942. This unit was\n\nraised in September 1939 from white residents of Papua and the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, and was disbanded in September 1942, its fit personnel absorbed by the Independent Companies, ANGAU or the Allied Intelligence Bureau. There is also a reference to a different colour patch being worn by members of this unit, On Guard, With the Volunteer Defence Corps, stating that personnel of the NGVR on leave in Australia were \"... wearing the distinctive green and yellow colour patch and the shoulder insignia of the NGVR.\". (p. 151.) Unfortunately no further details relating to this colour patch have been located.\n\n906. Darwin Infantry Battalion, 1940-1941;\n\n19th Aust. Infantry Battalion, 1941-1942: Auth. AHQ(DOS) Memo No. 85517, 27.12.1940. Replaced in September 1942 by No. 855A. This unit had been raised from a nucleus of the original Darwin Mobile Force on 23.8.1940, and was substantially reinforced by CMF volunteers for full time duty enlisted in Northern and Eastern Commands. Two rifle companies were raised in each of those areas, while the headquarters company and 'E' (MG) Company were spread between the two commands. The battalion arrived in Darwin in February 1941 and was redesignated the 19th Battalion on 30.11.1941.\n\nIndigenous Infantry Battalions\n\n907. Reserved.\n\n908. Papuan- Infantry Battalion, 1942-1945: Auth. GRO 370/1942, 4.9.1942. Superseded by No. 912 in February 1945. This is actually not the first colour patch approved for the unit. In August 1941 the battalion sought approval for a black and green colour patch with a metal 'P' in the centre. Details of the design eventually approved have not been located, however AHQ(MGO) Memo No. 819, dated 6.1.1942, submitted MGO Order No. 1875 to the CCF for the initial supply of 1,000 pairs.\n\n909. New Guinea Infantry Battalions, 1944-1945: Auth. GRO 268/1944, 21.7.1944. Superseded by No. 912 in February 1945.\n\n910. Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion: Ref. Draft GRO's, April 1943. This design was submitted for approval by HQ Torres Strait Force in March 1943, and was recommended for adoption by the DOS in April, appearing in draft GRO's at the end of that month. The inset represented the indigenous Torres Strait Islands other ranks, and their white officers and NCOs. In early May 1943 it was rejected, due it is believed to the fact that black and white represented a formation headquarters, and No. 911 was approved in lieu. This unit had been raised in February 1943 from the Torres Strait Infantry Company, and Torres Strait Labour Company.\n\n911. Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion, 1943-1945: Auth. GRO 468/1943, 18.6.1943, although initial approval was LHQ(MGO) Memo No. 74915, 8.5.1943.\n\n912. Pacific Islands Regiment, 1945-1947: Auth. GRO 54/1945, 9.2.1945. Comprised a\n\nregimental headquarters, the Papuan Infantry Battalion, four New Guinea Infantry Battalions, and the Pacific Islands Infantry Depot Battalion.
