        "text": "What is the International Legion? Is it part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine?\n\nBattalions of the International Legion are a structural part of the Land Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nDo you recruit only for the Legion itself?\n\nNo, we recruit foreigners for all units under the Ground Forces Command that have international teams, squads, companies, or battalions in them. The International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine and its battalions are just the most common, most numerous unit that primarily consists of foreigners.\n\nAfter I send my application – what happens next?\n\nWe review the formal aspects of your application. If everything is in order, we will notify you that your application will be compiled and sent to the appropriate units. The units will then review your file and provide feedback to us. If a unit selects you, you will be informed on how to contact them directly for a final interview with one of your future commanders or a recruiter from the unit.\n\nHow long do I have to wait for a reply and what to do if I did not receive a reply?\n\nWe usually respond to your initial email within 14 days. If you haven’t received a reply by then, please feel free to contact us again. Once we confirm that your file has been offered to the relevant units, it typically takes around 21 days for them to review your application and make a decision about your acceptance. Please note that this process may take longer if you lack relevant experience. We will send you an email with an update as soon as there is progress. We kindly ask that you refrain from inquiring about the status of your submission before receiving this update.\n\nShould I bring anything with me? If yes – what?\n\nYou will receive all the basic equipment, including a uniform, weapons, body armor, helmet, boots, and more. Please refrain from purchasing any additional items until you have been approved by a unit. Your assigned recruiter or commander will inform you about what you will receive and what is recommended to bring. Additionally, ensure you check your local regulations to confirm whether you are permitted to carry the recommended items. If needed, you can also purchase these items in Ukraine.\n\nHow long is the contract? Can I terminate it?\n\nThe contract is 3 years long and can be prolonged automatically. Yes, you can terminate it on your own after 6 months, but not during a combat deployment.\n\nWhat languages do I need to speak to be able to join the Legion?\n\nAs of right now, we only accept people who understand either English, Spanish or Ukrainian.\n\nHow do I travel to Ukraine?\n\nYou will be provided all the details on how to get to Ukraine and to which city in particular after you are accepted by the unit.\n\nShould I just arrive in Ukraine and find the nearest recruitment center?\n\nNo, applying in person will only add more work for us and the local recruitment centers. Ultimately, they will collect your data and still send it to us. Additionally, you would need to cover accommodation and personal expenses in Ukraine while waiting 4 to 6 weeks for your application to be reviewed. You can and should apply online from the comfort of your home.\n\nDo I get compensation for the tickets and other travel expenses?\n\nWe do not provide compensation for the travel expenses. Otherwise, this would be a loophole to travel to Europe for free.\n\nDo I get paid? How much? Do I get other bonuses?\n\nYou get the standard pay of a Ukrainian soldier and it varies depending on the conditions of the service. Your payment will be in UAH currency to a local bank account. The approximate amount in USD is the following: $550 per/month behind the frontline, $1100 per/month for service in a dangerous zone, and up to $4800 per/month for combat deployment. Please note, that those numbers are just an approximation since exchange rates can change and also some roles and units receive additional bonuses.\n\nDo I get compensation in the case of injury or fatality?\n\nYes. Injured soldiers are entitled to free medical treatment and a special payout in the event of disability, with compensation amounts varying based on the severity of the disability. Families of fallen soldiers receive a compensation of 15 million UAH, which is approximately $400,000. If a soldier is missing in action, their family will continue to receive their salary until an official declaration of death is made.The immediate family will need to open bank accounts and submit the necessary documents in Ukraine to receive this compensation.\n\nCan you issue me a visa, travel document or a signed contract?\n\nWe do not issue visas or any documents that can be used for travel to the EU. Since you need to travel to Ukraine by land, you must be legally permitted to enter one of the neighbouring countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, or Moldova. From there, if you have been accepted by a unit, crossing the border into Ukraine should be simple.\n\nDo I need a visa or other documents to travel to Ukraine?\n\nIt depends on your country of origin. To enter Ukraine by land, you will need to legally travel through Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, or Moldova. For detailed entry rules to Ukraine specific to your country, please visit: https://visitukraine.today/ukraine/country.\n\nWill I be considered a mercenary or a criminal if I join the Legion?\n\nNo, you will become a fully legal serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, just like all other Ukrainians and non-citizens who bravely serve. However, we highly recommend checking with your local laws about your state’s stance towards people who served in other countries’ military.\n\nDo I need to address consulate/embassy?\n\nDo I need to address consulate/embassy to join the Legion?\n\nNo, that information is outdated. It was relevant during the early stages of the war. Now, the best way to apply is through our website. You can find a detailed instruction here: https://ildu.com.ua/#candidate-requirements\n\nI do not have military or combat experience. Do I stand a chance to be selected?\n\nYes, especially if you have any other valuable experience. Please, make sure to list most of your useful skills and proficiencies.\n\nWhat roles can foreigners occupy in the Ukrainian military?\n\nThe only legal restriction is that foreigners cannot hold officer positions. However, many roles, such as those in the air force, air defense, logistics, or medical specialists (except combat), require knowledge of the Ukrainian language, which imposes additional limitations. Typically, your exact role will be determined based on your skills demonstrated during the training process. However, if you have any preferences, please specify them in your email application. In the Legion, we primarily recruit for frontline light infantry positions.\n\nWill I get some training?\n\nYes. Depending on the unit and on your skills. Some candidates are fresh from the military and can be deployed after a week or two of getting to know the command structure, the comms, etc. Others need more extensive training that can take up to 6 weeks.\n\nCan I become a resident or a citizen of Ukraine due to my service?\n\nYour contract with the Armed Forces of Ukraine is the basis for legal long term stay in Ukraine. Your contract / military ID proves that you are on the territory of Ukraine legally. You can not obtain an additional residence permit. However, your service is a pathway to citizenship. Also, there are several legislative initiatives to streamline the process of getting citizenship for proven foreign veterans."
