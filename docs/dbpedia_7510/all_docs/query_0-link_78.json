It was first awarded in January 2009 to Trooper Mark Gregor Donaldson, forty years after the award to the last Australian recipient of the (Imperial) Victoria Cross, Warrant Officer Keith Payne in 1969.[3]\n\nIn total, 100 VC recipients connected to an Australian federal electorate have served with Australian military units. The conflicts for which these VCs were awarded are:\n\nBoer War (1899–1902): 6 First World War (1914–18): 64 North Russia (1919): 2 Second World War (1939–45): 20 Vietnam (1962–72): 4 Afghanistan (2001–present): 4\n\nAn additional 19 VC recipients were either born or died in Australia but did not serve with Australian military units. These VC recipients are recorded in Appendix 2.\n\nDescription\n\nThe VC is made by Messrs. Hancock, jewellers of London, from metal taken from Russian guns captured at Sevastopol.[4] It is in the form of a Maltese Cross in bronze adorned by a crown surmounted by a crowned lion, the emblem of the British royal family, in the centre, with a scroll bearing the inscription, ‘For Valour’. On the reverse is inscribed the date of the action. The name and regiment of the holder are inscribed on the back of the suspension bar. The ribbon is red for all Services, although until July 1918, the Royal Navy used the blue ribbon.[5] The original warrant for the Victoria Cross, issued by Queen Victoria under her Royal Sign Manual, is available in the London Gazette.[6]\n\nNew South Wales electorates\n\nBanks\n\nJohn Patrick Hamilton (1896–1961; WWI) resided on enlistment\n\nBarton\n\nWilliam Matthew Currey (1895–1948; WWI) died\n\nBennelong\n\nGeorge Cartwright (1894–1978; WWI) cremated\n\nBradfield\n\nGeorge Cartwright (1894–1978; WWI) died\n\nCalare\n\nJohn Patrick Hamilton (1896–1961; WWI) born\n\nNeville Reginald Howse (1863–1930; Boer War) resided on enlistment\n\nJohn Bernard Mackey (1922–45; WWII) resided on enlistment\n\nBlair Anderson Wark (1894–1941; WWI) born\n\nCowper\n\nFrank John Partridge (1924–64; WWII) resided on enlistment, died, and buried\n\nEden-Monaro\n\nAlbert David Lowerson (1896–1945; WWI) resided prior to enlistment\n\nEdward John Francis Ryan (1890–1941; WWI) born, and resided on enlistment\n\nFowler\n\nJohn Hurst Edmondson (1914–41; WWII) resided on enlistment\n\nFarrer\n\nAlbert Chalmers Borella (1881–1968; WWI) died, and buried\n\nJohn William Alexander Jackson (1897–1959; WWI) born, resided on enlistment\n\nJames Rogers (1873–1961; Boer War) born\n\nGrayndler\n\nWilliam Matthew Currey (1895–1948; WWI) resided on enlistment\n\nJohn Bernard Mackey (1922–45; WWII) born\n\nHughes\n\nPeter John Badcoe (1934–67; Vietnam) resided on enlistment\n\nWilliam Matthew Currey (1895–1948; WWI) cremated\n\nJohn Patrick Hamilton (1896–1961; WWI) buried\n\nHunter\n\nClarence Smith Jeffries (1894–1917; WWI) resided on enlistment\n\nKingsford Smith\n\nThomas James Bede Kenny (1896–1953; WWI) buried\n\nJoseph Maxwell (1896–1967; WWI) died, and cremated\n\nBlair Anderson Wark (1894–1941; WWI) cremated\n\nMacarthur\n\nKevin Arthur Wheatley (1937–1965; Vietnam) resided following enlistment\n\nMcMahon\n\nKevin Arthur Wheatley (1937–1965; Vietnam) buried\n\nNewcastle\n\nWilliam Matthew Currey (1895–1948; WWI) born\n\nMark Gregor Strang Donaldson (1979–; Afghanistan) born\n\nClarence Smith Jeffries (1894–1917; WWI) born\n\nNew England\n\nGeorge Cartwright (1894–1978; WWI) resided on enlistment\n\nNorth Sydney\n\nAlbert Edward Chowne (1920–45; WWII) born, and resided on enlistment\n\nBlair Anderson Wark (1894–1941; WWI) resided on enlistment\n\nPage\n\nPatrick Joseph Bugden (1897–1917; WWI) born, and resided on enlistment\n\nFrank John Partridge (1924–64; WWII) born\n\nParkes\n\nAlexander Henry Buckley (1891–1918; WWI) born and resided on enlistment\n\nArthur Charles Hall (1896–1978; WWI) resided on enlistment, died, and buried\n\nReginald Roy Inwood (1890–1971; WWI) resided on enlistment\n\nParramatta\n\nArthur Charles Hall (1896–1978; WWI) born\n\nPaterson\n\nJoseph Maxwell (1896–1967; WWI) resided on enlistment\n\nReid\n\nJohn Patrick Hamilton (1896–1961; WWI) died\n\nThomas James Bede Kenny (1896–1953; WWI) died\n\nJames Rogers (1873–1961; Boer War) died\n\nRiverina\n\nCharles Groves Wright Anderson (1897–1988; WWII) resided on enlistment\n\nJohn Hurst Edmondson (1914–41; WWII) born\n\nRawdon Hume Middleton (1916–42; WWII) resided on enlistment\n\nReginald Roy Rattey (1918–86; WWII) born, resided on enlistment, died, and buried\n\nSydney\n\nJoseph Maxwell (1896–1967; WWI) born\n\nAlfred John Shout (1881–1915; WWI) resided on enlistment\n\nRayene Stewart Simpson (1926–78; Vietnam) born\n\nPercy Valentine Storkey (1893–1969; WWI) resided on enlistment\n\nKevin Arthur Wheatley (1937–1965; Vietnam) born\n\nJohn Woods Whittle (1883–1946; WWI) died\n\nWarringah\n\nArthur Roden Cutler (1916–2002; WWII) born, and resided on enlistment\n\nRayene Stewart Simpson (1926–78; Vietnam) resided prior to enlistment\n\nWatson\n\nGeorge Julian Howell (1893-1964; WW1) born and resided on enlistment\n\nJohn Woods Whittle (1883–1946; WWI) buried\n\nWentworth\n\nArthur Roden Cutler (1916–2002; WWII) died, and buried\n\nHughie Idwal Edwards (1914–82; WWII) died\n\nThomas James Bede Kenny (1896–1953; WWI) born, resided on enlistment\n\nLeonard Maurice Keysor (1885–1951; WWI) resided on enlistment\n\nRawdon Hume Middleton (1916–42; WWII) born\n\nJohn Patrick Hamilton\n\nBorn: 24 January 1896, Orange, New South Wales [electorate of Calare].[7]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nSon of William Hamilton, butcher, and his wife Catherine, née Fox. Nothing is known of his schooling but he described himself as a butcher when he enlisted ... he had had prior service in the militia.[8]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Penshurst, New South Wales [electorate of Banks].[9]\n\nEnlistment date: 22 August 1914.[10]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 9 August 1915—Gallipoli, Turkey.[11]\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery on 9th August, 1915, in the Gallipoli Peninsula. During a heavy bomb attack by the enemy on the newly captured position at Lone Pine, Private Hamilton, with utter disregard to personal safety, exposed himself under heavy fire on the parados, in order to secure a better fire position against the enemy’s bomb throwers. His coolness and daring example had an immediate effect. The defence was encouraged, and the enemy driven off with heavy loss.[12]\n\nUnit at time of action: 3rd Battalion, 1st Brigade, 1st Division, AIF.[13]\n\nLife after the war:\n\nOn 5 July 1918 Hamilton was posted to No.5 Officer Cadet Battalion at Cambridge, England; he was commissioned second lieutenant in January 1919 and promoted lieutenant next April. He rejoined a much-depleted 3rd Battalion in France late that month and returned to Australia in August. His AIF appointment ended on 12 September. After demobilization he lived at Tempe, Sydney, and was a wharf labourer for over thirty years; he also worked as a shipping clerk, storeman and packer. He was an active member of the Waterside Workers’ Federation and was Labor nominee for the position of Sydney branch secretary in 1952. During World War II he served as a lieutenant with the 16th Garrison Battalion and several training battalions. In 1942 he went to New Guinea with the 3rd Pioneer Battalion, then served with Australian Labour Employment Companies until 1944 when he transferred to the Australian Army Labour Service. He was promoted captain in the Australian Military Forces in October 1944. He returned to Sydney in April 1946.[14]\n\nDied: 27 February 1961, Concord, New South Wales [electorate of Reid].[15]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Woronora Cemetery, Sutherland, New South Wales [electorate of Hughes].[16]\n\nGeorge Cartwright\n\nBorn: 9 December 1894, South Kensington, United Kingdom.[17]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nSon of William Edward Cartwright, coach trimmer, and his wife Elizabeth, née Stracey. Migrating alone to Australia in 1912, George took a job as a labourer on a sheep station in the Elsmore district, near Inverell, New South Wales.[18]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Elsmore via Inverell, New South Wales [electorate of New England].[19]\n\nEnlistment date: 19 December 1915[20]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 31 August 1918—near Peronne, France.[21]\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty on the morning of the 31st August, 1918, during the attack on Road Wood, south west of Bouchavenes, near Peronne. When two companies were held up by machine gun fire, from the south western edge of the wood, without hesitation, Private Cartwright moved against the gun in a most deliberate manner under intense fire. He shot three of the team, and, having bombed the post, captured the gun and nine enemy. This gallant deed had a most inspiring effect on the whole line, which immediately rushed forward. Throughout the operation Private Cartwright displayed wonderful dash, grim determination, and courage of the highest order.[22]\n\nUnit at time of action: 33rd Battalion, 9th Brigade, 3rd Division, AIF.[23]\n\nLife after the war:\n\nCartwright lived in Sydney and worked as a motor mechanic. On 25 June 1921 he married Elsie Broker at St Stephen’s Anglican Church, Chatswood; they were to have two children before being divorced. He served in the Militia’s 4th-3rd Battalion and was commissioned on 25 February 1932. Mobilized for full-time service on 5 March 1940, he was promoted captain (1942) and performed training and amenities duties in Australia. Cartwright was placed on the Retired List on 11 May 1946. He found employment as an assistant-cashier and married Evelyn Mary Short on 4 September 1948 in the Congregational Church, Pitt Street, Sydney.\n\nIn 1956 Cartwright visited London for the VC centenary celebrations; he returned there for biennial reunions of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association. He was a quiet, unassuming man, 5 ft 7 ins (170 cm) tall, with black hair and a dark complexion. Survived by his wife, and by the son of his first marriage, he died on 2 February 1978 at Gordon and was cremated. His widow presented his VC and other medals to the Imperial War Museum, London.[24]\n\nDied: 2 February 1978, Gordon, New South Wales [electorate of Bradfield].[25]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Cremated at Northern Suburbs Crematorium, North Ryde [electorate of Bennelong].[26] Neville Reginald Howse (first Australian VC recipient)\n\nBorn: 26 October 1863,Stogursey, United Kingdom.[27]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nBorn on 26 October 1863 at Stogursey, Somerset, England, son of Alfred Howse, surgeon, and his wife Lucy Elizabeth, née Conroy. He was educated at Fullard’s House School, Taunton, and studied medicine at London Hospital ... Howse was a demonstrator in anatomy at the University of Durham when declining health caused him to migrate to New South Wales. Registered to practise on 11 December 1889 he set up at Newcastle but soon moved to Taree. In 1895 he visited England for postgraduate work in surgery, became FRCS in 1897, then bought a practice at Orange. On 17 January 1900 he was commissioned lieutenant in the New South Wales Medical Corps and sailed with the 2nd Contingent for South Africa.[28]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Orange, New South Wales [electorate of Calare].[29]\n\nEnlistment date: 17 January 1900.[30]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 24 July 1900—Vredefort, South Africa.[31]\n\nDuring the action at Vredefort on the 24th July, 1900, Captain House went out under a heavy cross fire and picked up a wounded man, and carried him to a place of shelter.[32]\n\nUnit at time of action: New South Wales Army Medical Corps, Australian Forces.[33]\n\nLife after the war:\n\nHowse became widely known in Orange for his skill as a surgeon and was twice mayor. On 31 January 1905 he married Evelyn Gertrude Northcote Pilcher at Bathurst. He remained a major in the AAMC Reserve and in August 1914 was appointed principal medical officer to the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force to German New Guinea, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. On his own initiative drugs and medical equipment (including a unique dental arrangement) suitable for a tropical campaign were obtained and the troops were protected against typhoid and smallpox. The brief action in New Britain was completed without a single case of serious illness up to 15 October as a result of his thoroughness. The ambitious Howse returned alone just in time to join the Australian Imperial Force and sail with the first convoy as staff officer to Surgeon General (Sir) WCD Williams, director of medical services. During the voyage he won the confidence of the commander of the AIF Major General (Sir) WT Bridges and the friendship of Colonel (Sir) Brudenell White.\n\nIn December Howse was appointed assistant director of medical services, 1st Australian Division, with the rank of colonel. He was gravely perturbed by the inadequacy and confusion of the Imperial forces’ medical plan for the Gallipoli landing and obtained improvements in the arrangements for the evacuation of Australian wounded. When the perilous situation of the 1st Division at the landing made his plans impossible Howse took personal charge of the evacuation of the wounded men crowding the beach under increasing shell-fire, ‘giving and disregarding orders in a manner quite shocking but strangely productive of results. Shells and bullets he completely disregarded’, wrote White. ‘To the wounded he was gentleness itself’. By 3 am on 26 April the beach was clear but Howse continued to superintend evacuation to the ships for two more days. To Howse the medical service was no mere humane amenity for soldiers but a fundamental of fighting efficiency. So he strove to improve sanitation and food, to expedite the return of the wounded to units and, after Gallipoli, to combat venereal disease and to resist every attempt to lower the physical standard of the AIF On Gallipoli he established the Anzac Medical Society which met regularly to disseminate knowledge among his officers. In July 1915 he was appointed CB and in September was given command of the medical services, Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, as deputy director; from November he was director of medical services of the AIF In this appointment, which he had been strongly urging, Howse could ensure the independence of the AAMC from the British medical authorities and give it the cohesion and leadership which it had lacked.\n\nWhen the infantry divisions went to France in 1916 Howse set up his headquarters with AIF administrative headquarters in London. He retained control of the AAMC in Egypt and Palestine, made frequent visits to the AIF in France and reported each month to the director general of medical services in Melbourne. If he had much to learn about the vast, complex organism of the army at war, he revealed a capacity to learn and grow with the magnitude of his task. Mistakes were made but Howse never lost the confidence of the commander of the AIF, Lieutenant-General Sir William Birdwood, nor of Brudenell White. Among his achievements were recognition by the army of the need for direct access by the director of medical services to the general officer commanding the AIF, and his acceptance by the War Office as chief medical officer of the AIF. He established clear policies for the AAMC in line with those of the Royal Army Medical Corps and preserved the independence of his corps. When Major General (Sir) John Monash ordered AAMC officers on his headquarters to wear the 3rd Division colour patch instead of their own, Howse forced Monash to withdraw the order; he won the same battle against Major General (Sir) Talbot Hobbs. In January 1917 he was promoted major general and appointed KCB. Howse gave evidence before the Dardanelles Commission in 1917. The arrangements for the wounded at the landing he characterized as ‘so inadequate that they amounted to criminal negligence’ on the part of the Imperial authorities.\n\nIn the field, Howse had introduced surgical teams and had supported the work of Major AW Holmes à Court in developing resuscitation teams with each division. His reorganization of the field ambulances in two sections, rejected by the War Office in 1916, was readopted in the AIF in September 1918. In October Howse went briefly to Australia to advise the minister of defence on AIF affairs and on crippled returned soldiers. He returned to London in February 1919 to assist on the medical side of repatriation. He was mentioned in dispatches, and was appointed KCMG and Knight of the Order of St John of Jerusalem in 1919. Howse returned home in January 1920 but his resumption of private practice was short lived. He had been appointed chairman of a committee on the reorganization of the Army Medical Service which began work in 1921 but in July 1921 he was made DGMS as a regular major general stationed in Melbourne. From the day of his return he had spoken out in public on the achievement of the AAMC in maintaining the health of the AIF and had insisted that the same must be done for all Australians in peacetime. As a regular officer could not campaign in public he resigned in November 1922 and was elected to the House of Representatives for the seat of Calare, which included Orange, as a member of the National Party.\n\n... He was a member of the Australian delegation to the fourth assembly of the League of Nations in 1923 and commissioned by the government to inquire into the medical examination of migrants to Australia and into the Spahlinger treatment of tuberculosis. From January 1925 to April 1927 Howse was minister for defence and health and minister in charge of repatriation. He accompanied the Prime Minister, SM (Viscount) Bruce to the Imperial Conference in 1926 but was taken ill and returned to Australia. He relinquished defence and health but remained in the cabinet as assistant minister without portfolio. Nevertheless he continued to administer repatriation and even acted as secretary to the cabinet. In February 1928 he again became minister for health and repatriation and also for home and territories. He was campaign manager for the 1929 election in which he lost his seat. In his brief parliamentary career he was recognized as champion of the returned servicemen and as a pioneer in public health. He spoke on the need for the Commonwealth to improve public health, on the treatment of cancer and venereal disease, maternity allowances and the welfare of returned servicemen. With the purchase of £100,000 worth of radium in 1928 Howse set up one of the world’s first radium banks. The first conference of cancer organizations in Australia was inspired by him and he was responsible for the transfer of the Institute of Anatomy to Canberra. He helped to found the Federal Health Council in 1925 and the College of Surgeons of Australasia in 1928.\n\nHowse went to England for medical treatment in 1930. He died of cancer on 19 September 1930 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery, London, survived by his wife, two sons and three daughters. Neville Howse was an Englishman who expressed the nascent Australian nationalism vigorously and directly. He was a pragmatist who nevertheless saw far ahead, a surgeon who had a flair for soldiering, an organizer who had deep insight into the essential relationship between the medical service and the force it served and who had the courage and persistence to establish policies not always understood by combatant officers. His confidence, good humour and diplomacy were matched by his shrewd appreciation of character. If his ambition carried him far, it was motivated by his recognition of human need in war and peace and sustained by confidence in his own capacity to help. His successes, in the words of another great DGMS, Colonel RM Downes, ‘made him one of the outstanding Australians of the Great War ... one of the most remarkable and self-sacrificing medical administrators any military force has ever known’.[34]\n\nDied: 19 September 1930, London, United Kingdom.[35]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Kensal Green Cemetery, London, United Kingdom.[36]\n\nBlair Anderson Wark\n\nBorn: 27 July 1894, Bathurst, New South Wales [electorate of Calare].[37]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nFourth child of Alexander Wark, a gas engineer from Scotland, and his native-born wife Blanche Adelaide Maria, née Forde. Educated at Fairleigh Grammar, Bathurst, St Leonards Superior Public School (North Sydney High) and Sydney Technical College, Blair worked as a quantity surveyor while pursuing his military interests. A senior cadet in 1911–12, he enlisted in the 18th (North Sydney) Infantry, Australian Military Forces, and was provisionally commissioned in 1913.[38]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: McMahon’s Point, New South Wales [electorate of North Sydney].\n\nEnlistment date: 15 September 1915.[39]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 29 September–1 October 1918—Hindenburg Line, France.[40]\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery, initiative, and control during the period 29th Sept. to 1st Oct., 1918, in the operations against the Hindenburg Line at Bellicourt and the advance through Nauroy, Etricourt, Magny La Fosse and Joncourt. On 29th Sept., after personal reconnaissance, under heavy fire, [Major Wark] led his command forward at a critical period, and restored the situation. Moving fearlessly at the head of, and at times far in advance of, his troops, he cheered his men on through Nauroy, thence towards Etricourt. Still leading his assaulting companies, he observed a battery of 77mm guns firing on his rear companies, and causing heavy casualties. Collecting a few of his men, he rushed the battery, capturing four guns and then of the crew [sic]. Then moving rapidly forward, with only two NCOs he surprised and captured fifty Germans near Magny La Fosse. On 1st Oct., 1918, he again showed fearless leading and gallantry in attack, and without hesitation, and regardless of personal risk, dashed forward and silenced machine guns which were causing heavy casualties. Throughout he displayed the greatest courage, skilful leading, and devotion to duty, and his work was invaluable.[41]\n\nUnit at time of action: 32nd Battalion, 8th Brigade, 5th Division), AIF.[42]\n\nLife after the war:\n\nOn 31 May 1919 at the parish church, Worthing, Sussex, Wark married Phyllis Marquiss Munro and returned to Australia where his AIF appointment was terminated in September. He became a principal of Thompson & Wark, quantity surveyors, a director of several companies, a councillor of the National Roads and Motorists’ Association, a committee-member of the Hawkesbury Race Club and a life governor of the Benevolent Society of New South Wales. Divorced in 1922, Wark married Catherine Mary Davis on 10 December 1927 at St Stephen’s Presbyterian Church, Sydney. In April 1940 he was appointed to the 1st Battalion, AMF, and assumed command on 26 July with the rank of temporary lieutenant-colonel. While bivouacked at Puckapunyal, Victoria, he died suddenly of coronary heart disease on 13 June 1941. Wark was cremated after a military funeral at which it was said that he ‘liked the wind in his face and lived the life of three men’. His wife, their son and two daughters survived him.[43]\n\nDied: 13 June 1941, Puckapunyal, Victoria [electorate of McEwen][44]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Cremated at Eastern Suburbs Crematorium, Matraville, New South Wales [electorate of Kingsford Smith].[45]\n\nJohn Bernard (Jack) Mackey\n\nBorn: 16 May 1922, Leichhardt, New South Wales [electorate of Grayndler].[46]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nOnly son and eldest of four children of native-born parents Stanislaus Mackey, baker, and his wife Bridget Catherine, née Smyth. After attending St Columba’s School, Leichhardt, and Christian Brothers’ High School, Lewisham, Jack moved with his family to Portland in 1936. Aged 14, he finished his formal education at St Joseph’s Convent School that year. Because jobs were scarce, young Mackey was apprenticed in his father’s bakery. Of average height, stockily built and weighing about 13 stone (83 kg), he had blue eyes, reddish hair, and a humorous and exuberant nature. He played Rugby League football for the local junior team (and later for his battalion) and proved an excellent swimmer, but he disliked working in the bakery and living in the country. His relationship with his father became strained, particularly after his mother died in 1939. Defying his father, Jack overstated his age and enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 4 June 1940. Stanislaus reluctantly accepted the situation.[47]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Portland, New South Wales [electorate of Calare].[48]\n\nEnlistment date: 4 June 1940.[49]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 12 May 1945, Tarakan Island, Indonesia.[50]\n\nCorporal Mackey was in charge of a section of the 2/3rd Australian Pioneer Battalion in the attack on the feature known as Helen, East of Tarakan town. Led by Corporal Mackey the section moved along a narrow spur with scarcely width for more than one man when it came under fire from three well-sited positions near the top of a very steep, razor-backed ridge. The ground fell away almost sheer on each side of the track making it almost impossible to move to a flank so Corporal Mackey led his men forward. He charged the first Light Machine-Gun position but slipped and after wrestling with one enemy, bayoneted him, and charged straight on to the Heavy Machine-Gun which was firing from a bunker position six yards to his right. He rushed this post and killed the crew with grenades. He then jumped back and changing his rifle for a sub-machine-gun he attacked further up the steep slope another Light Machine-Gun position which was firing on his platoon. Whilst charging, he fired his gun and reached within a few feet of the enemy position when he was killed by Light Machine-Gun fire but not before he had killed two more enemy. By his exceptional bravery and complete disregard for his own life, Corporal Mackey was largely responsible for the killing of seven Japanese and the elimination of two machine-gun posts, which enabled his platoon to gain its objective, from which the Company continued to engage the enemy. His fearless action and outstanding courage were an inspiration to the whole battalion.[51]\n\nUnit at time of action: 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion, 9th Division, AIF.[52]\n\nDied: 12 May 1945, Tarakan Island, Indonesia.[53]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Labuan War Cemetery, Labuan, Malaysia.[54]\n\nRawdon Hume Middleton\n\nBorn: 22 July 1916, Waverley, New South Wales [electorate of Wentworth].[55]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nSon of native-born parents Francis Rawdon Hamilton Middleton, station-manager, and his wife Faith Lillian, née Millar. Rawdon was educated at Dubbo High School and worked as a jackeroo on Leewong, a station at Yarrabandi, near Parkes, managed by his father. Nicknamed ‘Ron’, he was a keen cricketer and footballer, despite being slightly built. He was a good-looking young man, very quiet and a little moody, with a strong ‘streak of honest determination’.[56]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Yarrabandai, New South Wales [electorate of Riverina].\n\nEnlistment date: 14 October 1940.[57]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 28–29 November 1942—Turin, Italy.[58]\n\nFlight Sergeant Middleton was captain and first pilot of a Stirling aircraft detailed to attack the Fiat Works at Turin [28–9] November, 1942. Great difficulty was experienced in climbing to 12,000 feet to cross the Alps, which led to excessive consumption of fuel. So dark was the night that the mountain peaks were almost invisible. During the crossing Flight Sergeant Middleton had to decide whether to proceed or turn back, there being barely sufficient fuel for the return journey. Flares were sighted ahead and he continued the mission and even dived to 2,000 feet to identify the target, despite the difficulty of regaining height. Three flights were made over Turin at this low altitude before the target was identified. The aircraft was then subjected to fire from light anti-aircraft guns. A large hole appeared in the port main plane which made it difficult to maintain lateral control. A shell then burst in the cockpit, shattering the windscreen and wounding both pilots. A piece of shell splinter tore into the side of Flight Sergeant Middleton’s face, destroying his right eye and exposing the bone over the eye. He was probably wounded also in the body or legs. The second pilot received wounds in the head and both legs which bled profusely. The wireless operator was also wounded in the leg. Flight Sergeant Middleton became unconscious and the aircraft dived to 800 feet before control was regained by the second pilot, who took the aircraft up to 1500 feet and released the bombs. There was still lightflak, some very intense, and the aircraft was hit many times. The three gunners replied continuously until the rear turret was put out of action. Flight Sergeant Middleton had now recovered consciousness and, when clear of the target, ordered the second pilot back to receive first aid. Before this was completed the latter insisted on returning to the cockpit, as the captain could see very little and could only speak with loss of blood and great pain.\n\nCourse was set for base and the crew now faced an Alpine crossing and a homeward flight in a damaged aircraft, with insufficient fuel. The possibilities of abandoning the aircraft or landing in Northern France were discussed but Flight Sergeant Middleton expressed the intention of trying to make the English coast, so that his crew could leave the aircraft by parachute. Owing to his wounds and diminishing strength, he knew that, by then, he would have little or no chance of saving himself. After four hours, the French coast was reached and here the aircraft, flying at 6,000 feet, was once more engaged and hit by intense light anti-aircraft fire. Flight Sergeant Middleton was still at the controls and mustered sufficient strength to take evasive action. After crossing the Channel there was only sufficient fuel for 5 minutes flying. Flight Sergeant Middleton ordered the crew to abandon the aircraft while he flew parallel with the coast for a few miles, after which he intended to head out to sea. Five of the crew left the aircraft safely, while two remained to assist Flight Sergeant Middleton. The aircraft crashed in the sea and the bodies of the front gunner and flight engineer were recovered the following day. Their gallant captain was apparently unable to leave the aircraft and his body has not been traced. Flight Sergeant Middleton was determined to attack the target regardless of the consequences and not to allow his crew to fall into enemy hands. While all the crew displayed heroism of a high order, the urge to do so came from Flight Sergeant Middleton, whose fortitude and strength of will made possible the completion of the mission. His devotion to duty in the face of overwhelming odds is unsurpassed in the annals of the Royal Air Force.[59]\n\nUnit at time of action: RAAF, attached 149 Squadron, 3 Group, Bomber Command, RAF.[60]\n\nDied: 29 November 1942, near Dymchurch, United Kingdom.[61]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: St John’s Churchyard, Mildenhall, United Kingdom.[62]\n\nKevin Arthur Wheatley\n\nBorn: 13 March 1937, Surry Hills, New South Wales [electorate of Sydney].[63]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nThird child of Raymond George Wheatley, labourer, and his wife Ivy Sarah Ann, née Newman, both born in Sydney. Educated at Maroubra Junction Junior Technical School, Kevin worked as a milk carter, food sterilizer, machine operator and brick burner. At the registrar-general’s office, Sydney, on 20 July 1954 he married a 14-year-old milk-bar assistant Edna Aileen Davis, who used her stepfather’s surname, Gimson. On 12 June 1956 Wheatley enlisted in the Australian Regular Army. Following recruit training he joined the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, in September 1956 and transferred to the 3rd Battalion in March 1957. He served in the Malayan Emergency from September that year to July 1959, before transferring in August to the 2nd Battalion and in June 1961 to the 1st Battalion. In January 1964 he was promoted sergeant and in August, temporary warrant officer, class two. Short and stocky, he was a highly respected and well-liked non-commissioned officer with a reputation as a rough, wild man who was a good soldier. He was known as ‘Dasher’ for his Rugby Union football prowess. Arriving in the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) in March 1965, Wheatley joined the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam.[64]\n\nPlace of residence following enlistment: Campbelltown, New South Wales [electorate of Macarthur].[65]\n\nEnlistment date: 12 June 1956.[66]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 13 November 1965—Quang Ngai, Vietnam.[67]\n\nOn 13th November 1965 at approximately 1300 hours, a Vietnamese Civil Irregular Defence Group company commenced a search and destroy operation in the Tra Bong valley, 15 kilometres East of Tra Bong Special Forces Camp in Quang Ngai Province. Accompanying the force were Captain F Fazekas, senior Australian Advisor, with the centre platoon, and Warrant Officers KA Wheatley and RJ Swanton with the right hand platoon. At about 1340 hours, Warrant Officer Wheatley reported contact with Viet Cong elements. The Viet Cong resistance increased in strength until finally Warrant Officer Wheatley asked for assistance. Captain Fazekas immediately organised the centre platoon to help and personally led and fought it towards the action area. While moving towards this area he received another radio message from Warrant Officer Wheatley to say that Warrant Officer Swanton had been hit in the chest, and requested an air strike and an aircraft, for the evacuation of casualties.\n\nAt about this time the right platoon broke in the face of heavy Viet Cong fire and began to scatter. Although told by the Civil Irregular Defence Group medical assistant that Warrant Officer Swanton was dying, Warrant Officer Wheatley refused to abandon him. He discarded his radio to enable him to half drag, half carry Warrant Officer Swanton, under heavy machine gun and automatic rifle fire, out of the open rice paddies into the comparative safety of a wooded area, some 200 metres away. He was assisted by a Civil Irregular Defence Group member, Private Dinh Do who, when the Viet Cong were only some ten metres away, urged him to leave his dying comrade. Again he refused, and was seen to pull the pins from two grenades and calmly awaited the Viet Cong, holding one grenade in each hand. Shortly afterwards, two grenade explosions were heard, followed by several bursts of fire. The two bodies were found at first light next morning after the fighting had ceased, with Warrant Officer Wheatley lying beside Warrant Officer Swanton. Both had died of gunshot wounds. Warrant Officer Wheatley displayed magnificent courage in the face of an overwhelming Viet Cong force which was later estimated at more than a company. He had the clear choice of abandoning a wounded comrade and saving himself by escaping through the dense timber or of staying with Warrant Officer Swanton and thereby facing certain death. He deliberately chose the latter course. His acts of heroism, determination and unflinching loyalty in the face of the enemy will always stand as examples of the true meaning of valour.[68]\n\nUnit at time of action: Australian Army Training Team, Vietnam.[69]\n\nDied: 13 November 1965, Tra Bong Valley, Quang Ngai, Vietnam.[70]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Pine Grove Memorial Park, Minchinbury, New South Wales [electorate of McMahon].[71]\n\nWilliam Mathew Currey\n\nBorn: 19 September 1895, Wallsend, New South Wales [electorate of Newcastle].[72]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nSon of William Robert Currey, labourer and later miner, and his wife Mary Ellen, née Lang. Educated at Dudley and Plattsburg Public schools, he moved to Leichhardt, Sydney, and found employment as a wireworker. After the outbreak of World War I he twice attempted to enlist without his parents’ consent, giving a false age, but was discovered and discharged.[73]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Leichhardt, New South Wales [electorate of Grayndler].[74]\n\nEnlistment date: 9 October 1916.[75]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 1 September 1918—Peronne, France.[76]\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and daring in the attack on Peronne on the morning of 1st September, 1918. When the battalion was suffering heavy casualties from a 77mm field gun at very close range, Private Currey, without hesitation, rushed forward under intense machine gun fire and succeeded in capturing the gun single handed after killing the entire crew. Later, when the advance of the left flank was checked by an enemy strong point, Private Currey crept around the flank and engaged the post with a Lewis gun. Finally, he rushed the post single handed, causing many casualties. It was entirely owing to his gallant conduct that the situation was relieved and the advance enabled to continue. Subsequently, he volunteered to carry orders for the withdrawal of an isolated company, and this he succeeded in doing despite shell and rifle fire, returning later with valuable information. Throughout the operations his striking example of coolness, determination, and utter disregard of danger had a most inspiring effect on his comrades, and his gallant work contributed largely to the success of the operations.[77]\n\nUnit at time of action: 53rd Infantry Battalion, 14th Brigade, 5th Division, AIF.[78]\n\nLife after the war:\n\nDespite his gas wound, Currey saw out the war with the 53rd Battalion, arriving back in Australia in March 1919. In September he joined the New South Wales railways as a storeman and next year, on 10 April, married Emma Davies at St Saviour’s Anglican Church, Punchbowl. While employed with the railways he became active in the Australian Labor Party and on 16 May 1941 he resigned his post to stand as Labor candidate for Kogarah in the Legislative Assembly. He won the seat, thereby becoming the first VC winner to enter the New South Wales parliament. He was twice re-elected—in 1944 and 1947—and made the interests of ex-servicemen his particular concern. In 1930–32 he had served with the 45th Battalion in the citizen forces, rising to warrant officer rank, and in 1940–41 with the Australian Instructional Corps. Currey collapsed suddenly in Parliament House on 27 April 1948 and, survived by his wife and two daughters, died three days later of coronary-vascular disease.[79]\n\nDied: 30 April 1948, Bexley, New South Wales [electorate of Barton].[80]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Cremated at Woronora Crematorium, Sydney [electorate of Hughes].[81]\n\nClarence Smith Jeffries\n\nBorn: 26 October 1894, Wallsend, New South Wales [electorate or Newcastle].[82]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nOnly child of Joshua Jeffries, colliery manager, and his wife Barbara, née Steel, both born at Wallsend. After attending Dudley Primary School, where he excelled at cricket, and the Newcastle Collegiate and High schools, he was apprenticed to his father as a mining engineer. A young man of high standards and ideals, he strove to excel in all he did. Jeffries had a particular interest in the study of breeding thoroughbreds, although not in racing them, and always kept fine horses. His military service began in the militia when he was 14. He joined the 14th (Hunter River) Infantry Regiment as a private in July 1912 under the compulsory training scheme, and was promoted sergeant a year later. Commissioned second lieutenant on 22 August 1914, he was mobilized for home defence duties and instructed volunteers for the Australian Imperial Force at Newcastle and Liverpool camps.[83] Previous military service: 14th Infantry.[84]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Abermain, New South Wales [electorate of Hunter].[85]\n\nEnlistment date: 1 February 1916.[86]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 12 October 1917—Passchendaele, Belgium.[87]\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery in attack, when his company was held up by enemy machine gun fire from concrete emplacements. Organising a party, [Captain Jeffries] rushed one emplacement, capturing four machine guns and 35 prisoners. He then led his company forward under extremely heavy enemy artillery barrage and enfilade machine gun fire to the objective. Later, he again organised a successful attack on a machine gun emplacement, capturing two machine guns and thirty more prisoners. This gallant officer was killed during the attack, but it was entirely due to his bravery and initiative that the centre of the attack was not held up for a lengthy period. His example had a most inspiring influence.[88]\n\nUnit at time of action: 34th Battalion, 9th Brigade, 3rd Division, AIF.[89]\n\nDied: 12 October 1917, Hillside Farm, Passchendaele, Belgium.[90]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Tyne Cot Cemetery, Passchendaele, Belgium.[91]\n\nFrank John Partridge\n\nBorn: 29 November 1924, Grafton, New South Wales [electorate of Page].[92]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nThird of five children of Patrick (Paddy) James Partridge, an Australian-born farmer, and his wife Mary, née Saggs, who came from England. Frank left Tewinga Public School at the age of 13 and worked on the family farm—dairying and growing bananas at Upper Newee Creek, near Macksville. While serving in the Volunteer Defence Corps, he was called up for full-time duty in the Australian Military Forces on 26 March 1943.[93]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Upper Newee Creek, New South Wales [electorate of Cowper].[94]\n\nEnlistment date: 26 March 1943.[95]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 24 July, 1945—Bougainville, Papua New Guinea.[96]\n\nIn New Guinea, on 24th July, 1945, two fighting patrols, 8th Australian Infantry Battalion, were given the task of eliminating an enemy outpost in Bougainville which denied any forward movement to our troops. The preliminary artillery concentration caused the enemy bunkers to be screened by a litter of felled banana plants, and from these well concealed positions to their front and left, one of our Platoons came under extremely fierce machine-gun, grenade and rifle fire. The forward section at once suffered casualties and was pinned down together with two other sections. Private Partridge was a rifleman in a section which, in carrying out an encircling movement, immediately came under heavy medium machine-gun fire. He was hit twice in the left arm and again in the left thigh, whilst the Bren gunner was killed and two others seriously wounded, leaving only the section leader unwounded, but another soldier began to move up from another position. Private Partridge quickly appreciated the extreme gravity of the situation and decided that the only possible solution was personal action by himself.\n\nDespite wounds and with complete disregard to his own safety, Private Partridge rushed forward under a terrific burst of enemy fire and retrieved-the Bren gun from alongside the dead gunner, when he challenged the enemy to come out and fight. He handed the Bren gun to the newly arrived man to provide covering fire while he rushed this bunker, into which he threw a grenade and silenced the medium machine-gun. Under cover of the grenade burst, he dived into the bunker and, in a fierce hand-to-hand fight, he killed the only living occupant with his knife. Private Partridge then cleared the enemy dead from the entrance to the bunker and attacked another bunker in the rear; but weakness from loss of blood compelled him to halt, when he shouted to his section commander that he was unable to continue. With the way clear by the silencing of the enemy medium machine-gun by Private Partridge, the Platoon moved forward and established a defence perimeter in the vicinity of the spot where Private Partridge lay wounded. Heavy enemy medium machine-gun and rifle fire both direct and enfilade from other bunkers soon created an untenable situation for the Platoon, which withdrew under its own covering fire. Despite his wounds and weakness due to loss of blood, Private Partridge joined in this fight and remained in action until the Platoon had withdrawn after recovering their casualties.\n\nThe information gained by both patrols, and particularly from Private Partridge, enabled an attack to be mounted later. This led to the capture of a vital position sited on strong defensive ground and strengthened by 43 bunkers and other dug in positions from which the enemy fled in panic. The serious situation during the fight of the two patrols was retrieved only by the outstanding gallantry and devotion to duty displayed by Private Partridge, which inspired his comrades to heroic action, leading to a successful withdrawal which saved the small force from complete annihilation. The subsequent successful capture of the position was due entirely to the incentive derived by his comrades from the outstanding heroism and fortitude displayed by Private Partridge.[97]\n\nUnit at time of action: 8th Battalion, 23rd Brigade, II Australian Corps, AIF.[98]\n\nLife after the war:\n\nOf the Australians who won the VC in World War II, he was the youngest and the last ... After visiting London in 1946 for the Victory march, he was discharged from the AMF on 17 October in New South Wales; he was again to travel to England in 1953 for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II and in 1956 for the Victoria Cross centenary celebrations. Returning to Upper Newee Creek, Partridge lived with his father in a dirt-floored farmhouse. He devoted himself to self-education, reading the Encyclopaedia Britannica by kerosene lamp and developing an extraordinarily retentive memory. In 1962–63 he appeared as a contestant on the television quiz show, ‘Pick-a-Box’, compered by Bob Dyer; his laconic manner appealed strongly to viewers. Partridge was one of only three contestants to win all forty boxes; his prizes were valued at more than £12,000. At St Stephen’s Presbyterian Church, Sydney, on 23 February 1963 he married Barbara Mavis Vyvienne Jenniffer Wylie Dunlop, a 31-year-old nursing sister who lived at Turramurra. The wedding received extensive media coverage. Barbara remained at Turramurra while Frank built a new home at the farm. He drove to Sydney every weekend to see her.\n\nPartridge was an honorary member of the Returned Sailors’, Soldiers’ and Airmen’s Imperial League of Australia, a life member and patron of the Macksville Ex-Servicemen’s Club, and vice-president of the Nambucca district council of the Banana Growers’ Federation Co-operative Ltd. Harbouring deep political ambitions, he confidently sought Country Party pre-selection for the House of Representatives seat of Cowper in 1963. His views were regarded as rather extreme, and he lost to Ian Robinson. Partridge agreed to be Robinson’s campaign-manager for the election that year. To supplement the income from his farm, Partridge travelled around the district selling life assurance. He was killed in a motorcar accident on 23 March 1964 near Bellingen and was buried with full military honours in Macksville cemetery. His wife and three-month-old son survived him.[99]\n\nDied: 23 March 1964, near Bellingen, New South Wales [electorate of Cowper].[100]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Macksville Cemetery, New South Wales [electorate of Cowper].[101]\n\nAlbert Chalmers Borella (surname changed to Chalmers-Borella in 1939)\n\nBorn: 7 August 1881, Borung, Victoria [electorate of Murray].[102]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nSon of Louis Borella, farmer, and his wife Annie, née Chalmers, both native-born. His mother died when he was 4 and his father remarried. Educated at Borung and Wychitella state schools, he later farmed in the Borung and Echuca districts; he also served for eighteen months with a volunteer infantry regiment, the Victorian Rangers. From April 1910 Borella was employed by the Metropolitan Fire Brigades Board, Melbourne. He resigned in January 1913 and took up a pastoral lease, drawn by ballot, on the Daly River, Northern Territory. With the help of Aboriginal boys he built a house and ring-barked and partly fenced his holding before mounting costs forced him to abandon it early in 1915.[103] Previous military service: Served for 18 months in the Victorian Rifles.[104]\n\nPlace of residence prior to enlistment: Daly River, Northern Territory [electorate of Lingiari].[105]\n\nEnlistment date: 15 March 1915.[106]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 17–18 July 1918—Villers-Bretonneux, France.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery in attack. Whilst leading his platoon with the first wave Lt. Borella marked an enemy machine gun firing through our barrage. He ran out ahead of his men into the barrage, shot two German machine-gunners with his revolver, and captured the gun. He then led his party, now reduced to ten men and two Lewis guns, against a very strongly held trench, using his revolver and later a rifle, with great effect, causing many enemy casualties. His leading and splendid example resulted in the garrison being quickly shot or captured. Two large dug-outs were also bombed and thirty prisoners taken. Subsequently the enemy twice counterattacked in strong force, on the second occasion outnumbering Lt. Borella’s platoon by ten to one, but his cool determination inspired his men to resist heroically, and the enemy were repulsed with very heavy loss.[107]\n\nUnit at time of action: 26th Battalion, 7th Brigade, 2nd Division, AIF.[108]\n\nLife after the war:\n\nIn 1920–39 Borella farmed on a soldier-settlement block near Hamilton, Victoria. He was National Party candidate for Dundas in the 1924 Legislative Assembly election and was only narrowly defeated. He married Elsie Jane Love at Wesley Church, Hamilton, on 16 August 1928; from September 1939, when he changed his name by deed-poll, he and his family used the surname Chalmers-Borella. On the outbreak of World War II Borella was appointed lieutenant in the 12th Australian Garrison Battalion with which he served until 1941 when he was attached to the Prisoner of War Group at Rushworth. Promoted captain on 1 September 1942, he served with the 51st Garrison Company at Myrtleford until discharged in 1945. He then moved to Albury, New South Wales, joined the Commonwealth Department of Supply and Shipping, and was an inspector of dangerous cargoes until his retirement in 1956. Survived by his wife and two of his four sons, he died on 7 February 1968 and was buried with full military honours in the Presbyterian cemetery. ‘A big tough-looking bloke, the image we conjure up of the digger’, Borella was yet a humane, quietly spoken and unostentatious man, ever ready to assist a worthy cause.[109]\n\nDied: 7 February 1968, Albury-Wodonga, New South Wales [electorate of Farrer].[110]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Presbyterian Cemetery, North Albury, New South Wales [electorate of Farrer.][111]\n\nReginald Roy Inwood\n\nBorn: 14 July 1890, Prospect, South Australia [electorate of Adelaide].[112]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nEldest son of Edward Inwood, labourer, and his wife Mary Ann, née Minney. He was educated at North Adelaide Public School and Broken Hill Model School. Inwood worked as a miner at Broken Hill.[113]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Broken Hill, New South Wales [electorate of Parkes].[114]\n\nEnlistment date: 24 August 1914.[115]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 19–22 September 1917—Polygon Wood, Belgium.[116]\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty during the advance to the second objective. He moved forward through our barrage alone to an enemy strong post and captured it, together with nine prisoners, killing several of the enemy. During the evening he volunteered for a special all night patrol, which went out 600 yards in front of our line, and there—by his coolness and sound judgement—obtained and sent back very valuable information as to the enemy’s movements. In the early morning of the 21st September, Pte. Inwood located a machine gun which was causing several casualties. He went out alone and bombed the gun and team, killing all but one, whom he brought in as a prisoner with the gun.[117]\n\nUnit at time of action: 10th Battalion, 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, AIF.[118]\n\nLife after the war:\n\nReturning to a hero’s welcome at Broken Hill in October Inwood contrasted, in a public speech, his departure when he was, he claimed, ‘stoned by mongrels at the train’, with his return when ‘those mongrels were the first to ... shake me by the hand ... If the boys stick together like they did in France there will be no Bolshevikism in this town ... I would like to be at one end of the street with a machine-gun and have them at the other end’. Departing recruits had been hooted and jeered by militant socialists at Broken Hill but there is no evidence of stone-throwing. MP Considine, member for Barrier in the House of Representatives, accused Inwood of trying ‘to incite trouble between returned soldiers and the working classes’. Broken Hill was not a comfortable place for Inwood. He soon moved to Adelaide and on 31 December 1918 married a widow Mabel Alice Collins, née Weber. Inwood had difficulty in finding work. After an assault charge by police, which resulted in a fine in 1919, and his divorce in 1921, he spent a short time mining at Queenstown, Tasmania, and at a eucalyptus distillery on Kangaroo Island. He returned to Adelaide and was employed by the city council as a labourer in 1928–55. During World War II he served as a warrant officer with the Australian Military Forces.\n\nInwood married Evelyn Owens in 1927 and after her death married Louise Elizabeth Gates in 1942. He had no children. A rugged, independent, well-built man, ‘with the rough corners still on him’, the years after his third marriage were spent happily and quietly. This loyal labourer, perhaps exploited by some at Broken Hill, gave the impression that ‘his VC had not done him much good’. He never lost his pride in the 10th Battalion and always marched with them on Anzac Day. The Other Ranks Mess, 10th Battalion, Torrens Parade Ground, Adelaide, is called the Roy Inwood Club. His Victoria Cross hangs in the council chambers of the Adelaide City Council. He died on 23 October 1971, was given a military funeral and was buried in West Terrace cemetery. Two brothers, Harold and Robert, also served with the AIF; the latter was killed in action at Pozières.[119]\n\nDied: 23 October 1971, St Peter’s, Adelaide [electorate of Adelaide].[120]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: West Terrace Cemetery, Adelaide, South Australia [electorate of Adelaide].[121]\n\nJames Rogers\n\nBorn: 4 July 1873,Moama, New South Wales [electorate of Farrer].[122]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nBorn on 4 July 1873, at Woodside Farm, Moama, New South Wales, son of Welsh-born John Rogers, farmer, and his wife Sarah Louisa, née Johnstone, from Sydney. Rogers was educated locally at public schools. In 1886 his family moved to Heywood, Victoria, where he later worked on his father’s farm and joined the local company of the Victorian Mounted Rifles in 1898. He was 6 ft 2 ins (188 cm) tall, 12 stone (76 kg) and a superb horseman, tough bushman and crack rifle-shot.[123]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Heywood, Victoria [electorate of Wannon].[124]\n\nEnlistment date: 23 October 1899.[125]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: Thaba Nchu, near Bloemfontein, South Africa.[126]\n\nOn the 15th June, 1901, during a skirmish near Thaba ‘Nchu, a party of the rearguard of Captain Sitwell’s column, consisting of Lieutenant F. Dickinson, Sergeant James Rogers, and 6 men of the South African Constabulary, was suddenly attacked by about 60 Boers. Lieutenant Dickinson’s horse having been shot, that Officer was compelled to follow his men on foot. Sergeant Rogers seeing this, rode back, firing as he did so, took Lieutenant Dickinson up behind him, and carried him for half-a-mile on his horse. The Sergeant then returned to within 400 yards of the enemy and carried away, one after the other, two men who had lost their horses, after which he caught the horses of two other men, and helped the men to mount. All this was done under a very heavy rifle fire. The Boers were near enough to Sergeant Rogers to call upon him to surrender; his only answer was to continue firing.[127]\n\nUnit at time of action: South African Constabulary.[128]\n\nLife after the war:\n\nRogers tried to obtain a commission in the Australian Military Forces but was unsuccessful. After buying and then selling a farm at Yea, Victoria, he returned to South Africa where he served as a special detective with the Cape Police until February 1904. On 25 April 1907, describing himself as a mounted trooper, he married Ethel Maud Seldon at Portland, Victoria; they had two sons. By 1912 Rogers was a marker at Williamstown rifle range and by the outbreak of World War I he was an assistant ranger there. On 6 December 1914 he was commissioned in the 3rd Light Horse Brigade Train, Australian Army Service Corps, Australian Imperial Force. He was seriously wounded at Gallipoli on 4 August 1915 and evacuated to Egypt. He then served with the Anzac Provost Corps before returning to Australia on 18 July 1916. Rogers resumed work at Williamstown as a range assistant, then in 1921 became an assistant storeman, Ordnance Branch, AMF, Victoria. He resigned in 1922 and resumed farming. He lived at Kew, Melbourne, for over thirty years; then, after his wife died, with his one surviving son at Roseville, Sydney.[129]\n\nDied: 28 October 1961, Concord, New South Wales [electorate of Reid].\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Cremated at Springvale Crematorium, Springvale, Victoria [electorate of Bruce].[130]\n\nPeter John Badcoe (also recorded as Peter John Badcock and Peter James Badcock)\n\nBorn: 11 January 1934, Malvern, South Australia [electorate of Adelaide].[131]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nSon of Leslie Allen Badcock, public servant, and his wife Gladys Mary Ann May, née Overton. Educated at Adelaide Technical High School, in 1950 Peter entered the South Australian Public Service as a clerk. He enlisted in the Australian Regular Army on 10 June 1950. Graduating from the Officer Cadet School, Portsea, Victoria, on 13 December 1952, he was allocated to the Royal Australian Artillery. Postings to the 14th National Service Training Battalion (1953 and 1955–57) and the 1st Field Regiment (1953–55 and 1957–58) followed. On 26 May 1956 he married 17-year-old Denise Maureen MacMahon in the Methodist Church, Manly, Sydney.\n\nPromoted temporary captain, in December 1958 Badcock was sent to Army Headquarters as a staff officer. In 1961 he changed his surname to Badcoe. While serving in Malaya with the 103rd Field Battery from September 1961 to November 1963, he spent a week (7–14 November 1962) in the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). He saw the conditions under which the South resisted communist insurgency which was led by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam). Back in Australia, Badcoe returned to the 1st Field Regiment, but in 1965 transferred to the infantry; in June 1966 he was promoted provisional major. He arrived in Saigon on 6 August to join the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam. Short, round and stocky, with horn-rimmed spectacles, Badcoe did not look a hero. He was a quiet, gentle and retiring man, with a dry sense of humour. His wife was his confidante. Badcoe neither drank alcohol nor smoked; bored by boisterous mess activities, he preferred the company of a book on military history. To his colleagues he was an enigma, yet many humoured his boundless enthusiasm in field exercises and his off-duty discourses on martial matters.[132]\n\nPlace of residence following enlistment: Hammondville, New South Wales [electorate of Hughes].[133]\n\nEnlistment date: 10 June 1950.[134]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: February–April 1967, Vietnam.[135]\n\nMajor Peter John Badcoe was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Australian Staff Corps in December 1952. He was allotted to the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery in which he served in a number of Regimental and Staff postings until August 1965. He then transferred to the Royal Australian Infantry Corps and joined the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam in August 1966. He was posted as Sector Operations Office in Thua Thien Province, South Vietnam.\n\nOn 23rd February 1967 he was acting as an Adviser to a Regional Force Company in support of a Sector operation in Thu Thu district. He monitored a radio transmission which stated that the Subsector Advisor, a United States Army officer, had been killed and that his body was within 50 metres of an enemy machine-gun position; further, the United States Medical Advisor had been wounded and was in immediate danger from the enemy. Major Badcoe with complete disregard for his own safety moved alone across 600 metres of fire-swept ground and reached the wounded advisor, attended to him and ensured his future safety. He then organised a force of one platoon and led them towards the enemy post. His personal leadership, words of encouragement, and actions in the face of hostile enemy fire forced the platoon to successfully assault the enemy position and capture it, where he personally killed the machine gunners directly in front of him. He then picked up the body of the dead officer and ran back to the Command Post over open ground still covered by enemy fire.\n\nOn 7 March 1967 at approximately 0645 hours, the Sector Reaction Company was deployed to Quang Dien Subsector to counter an attack by the Viet Cong on the Headquarters. Major Badcoe left the Command group after their vehicle broke down and a United States officer was killed; he joined the Company Headquarters and personally led the company in an attack over open terrain to assault and capture a heavily defended enemy position. In the face of certain death and heavy loss his personal courage and leadership turned certain defeat into victory and prevented the enemy from capturing the District Headquarters.\n\nOn 7th April 1967, on an operation in Huong Tra District, Major Badcoe was with the 1st ARVN Division Reaction Company and some armoured personnel carriers. During the move forward to an objective the company came under heavy small arms fire and withdrew to a cemetery for cover, this left Major Badcoe and his radio operator about 50 metres in front of the leading elements, under heavy mortar fire. Seeing this withdrawal, Major Badcoe ran back to them, moved amongst them and by encouragement and example got them moving forward again. He then set out in front of the company to lead them on; the company stopped again under heavy fire but Major Badcoe continued on to cover and prepared to throw grenades, when he rose to throw, his radio operator pulled him down as heavy small arms fire was being brought to bear on them: he later got up again to throw a grenade and was hit and killed by a burst of machine gun fire. Soon after, friendly artillery fire was called in and the position was assaulted and captured. Major Badcoe’s conspicuous gallantry and leadership on all these occasions was an inspiration to all, each action, ultimately, was successful, due entirely to his efforts, the final one ending in his death. His valour and leadership were in the highest traditions of the military profession and the Australian Regular Army.[136]\n\nUnit at time of action: Australian Army Training Team, Vietnam.[137]\n\nDied: 7 April 1967, near An Thuan village, north-west of Hue, South Vietnam.[138]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Terendak Garrison Camp Cemetery, Malaysia.[139]\n\nCharles Groves Wright Anderson\n\nBorn: 12 February 1897, Cape Town, South Africa.[140]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nThird of five children of Alfred Gerald Wright Anderson, an English-born auditor and later newspaper editor, and his Belgian-born wife Emma (Maïa) Louise Antoinette, née Trossaert. In 1900 the family moved to the East Africa Protectorate (Kenya) and settled on a farm near Nairobi called Mount Margaret. After beginning his education at a government school in Nairobi, Charles was sent in 1907 to England, where he lived with an uncle and aunt before entering St Brendan’s College, Bristol, in 1910. On his return to Africa, Anderson enlisted in the local volunteers in November 1914, following the start of World War I. Next year he joined the Calcutta Volunteer Battery. On 13 October 1916 he was commissioned temporary lieutenant in the King’s African Rifles. Serving with the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Regiment, he displayed outstanding leadership during fighting at Nhamacurra, Portuguese East Africa (Mozambique), in July 1918 and was awarded the Military Cross (1919). Before he was demobilised in February 1919, he was promoted to temporary captain.\n\nTurning to farming, Anderson served as chairman of the Kenya Settlers’ Association in the Rift Valley district. At the Anglican Cathedral of the Highlands, Nairobi, on 21 February 1931 he married Edith Marian Tout, a niece of (Sir) Frederick Tout, who came from Young, New South Wales, to tour Africa. During a subsequent visit to Australia, Anderson was impressed by his wife’s home country. In 1935 they migrated to Australia with their daughter and twin sons. He purchased a 2200-acre (890 ha) grazing property, Fernhill, at Crowther, near Young. On 3 March 1939 Anderson was appointed a captain in the 56th Battalion (Riverina Regiment), Militia. Promoted to major in October, he transferred to the Australian Imperial Force on 1 July 1940 as second-in-command of the 2/19th Battalion.[141]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Crowther, New South Wales [electorate of Riverina].[142]\n\nEnlistment date: 1 July 1940.[143]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 18–22 January 1942, Muar, Malaysia.[144]\n\nDuring the operations in Malaya from the 18th to 22nd Jan. 1942, Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson, in command of a small Force, was sent to restore a vital position and to assist a Brigade. His Force destroyed ten enemy tanks. When later cut off, he defeated persistent attacks on his position from air and ground forces, and forced his way through the enemy lines to a depth of fifteen miles. He was again surrounded and subjected to very heavy and frequent attacks resulting in severe casualties to his Force. He personally led an attack with great gallantry on the enemy who were holding a bridge, and succeeded in destroying four guns. Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson throughout all this fighting, protected his wounded and refused to leave them. He obtained news by wireless of the enemy position and attempted to fight his way back through eight miles of enemy occupied country. This proved to be impossible and the enemy were holding too strong a position for any attempt to be made to relieve him. On the 19th January Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson was ordered to destroy his equipment and make his way back as best he could round the enemy position. Throughout the fighting, which lasted for four days, he set a magnificent example of brave leadership, determination and outstanding courage. He not only showed fighting qualities of a very high order but throughout exposed himself to danger without any regard to his own personal safety.[145]\n\nUnit at time of action: 2/19th Battalion, 22nd Brigade, 8th Division, AIF.[146] Life after the war:\n\nFreed after Japan’s surrender, Anderson was repatriated in November 1945 and next month placed on the Reserve of Officers. He returned to farming near Young and later took over a property, Springfield, that his wife had inherited. At the 1949 Federal election Anderson won the House of Representatives seat of Hume for the Country Party. He became an advocate for rural issues and for improving the rehabilitation of service personnel. Defeated in 1951, he stood unsuccessfully in 1954 before regaining Hume next year; re-elected in 1958, he served until again defeated in 1961. During his second term, he was a member of the joint committees on the Australian Capital Territory (1957–61) and Foreign Affairs (1961). In 1955 Anderson had revisited Kenya and Britain; in 1959 he returned to Thailand as special Australian representative during wreath-layings on war graves at the River Kwai. He retained his military links, becoming honorary colonel of the 56th Battalion (1956–57) and the 4th Battalion (1957–60), Citizen Military Forces. In 1968 he again visited Malaya as the guest of the British 17th Division, which was conducting a study tour of the Muar battle. On 11 November 1988 he died in his home at Red Hill, Canberra, and was cremated with full military honours. He was survived by two daughters and a son; his wife and their other son predeceased him.[147]\n\nDied: 11 November 1988, Red Hill, Canberra [electorate of Canberra][148]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Cremated at Norwood Crematorium, Mitchell, Australian Capital Territory [electorate of Fenner].[149]\n\nJoseph Maxwell\n\nBorn: 10 February 1896, Forest Lodge, New South Wales [electorate of Sydney].[150]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nSon of John Maxwell, labourer, and his wife Elizabeth, née Stokes. Employed as an apprentice boilermaker in Newcastle, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 8 February 1915.[151] Previous military service: Served for three years in the Senior Cadets; two years in the Citizen Military Forces.[152]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: West Maitland, New South Wales [electorate of Paterson].[153]\n\nEnlistment date: 6 February 1915.[154]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 3 October 1918, near Estrees, France.[155]\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and leadership in attack on the Beaurevoir–Fonsomme line, near Estrees, north of St Quentin, on the 3rd October, 1918. His company commander was severely wounded early in the advance and Lt. Maxwell at once took charge. The enemy wire when reached under intense fire was found to be exceptionally strong, and closely supported by machine guns, whereupon Lt. Maxwell pushed forward single handed through the wire and captured the most dangerous gun, killing three and capturing four enemy. He thus enabled his company to penetrate the wire and reach the objective. Later, he again dashed forward and silenced, single handed, a gun which was holding up a flank company. Subsequently, when with two men only he attempted to capture a strong party of the enemy, he handled a most involved situation very skilfully, and it was due to his resource that he and his comrades escaped. Throughout the day Lt. Maxwell set a high example of personal bravery, coupled with excellent judgement and quick decision.[156]\n\nUnit at time of action: 18th Battalion, 5th Brigade, 2nd Division, AIF.[157]\n\nLife after the war:\n\nIn just over twelve months Maxwell was awarded the DCM, the MC and Bar and the VC, and he was only 22 when the war ended. After returning to Australia in 1919 he worked in a variety of occupations in Sydney, Canberra and New South Wales country towns. On 14 February 1921, describing himself as a reporter, he married a 19-year-old tailoress, Mabel Maxwell (not a relative) at Bellevue Hill, Sydney, with Catholic rites. There was a daughter of the marriage which was dissolved in 1926 with his wife as petitioner. In 1932, helped by Hugh Buggy, Maxwell published the very successful Hell’s Bells and Mademoiselles, an account of the war as he saw it; at the time he was working as a gardener with the Department of the Interior in Canberra. His health was often very unstable. He attempted, unsuccessfully because of his age, to enlist in the 2nd AIF, but eventually succeeded in enlisting in Queensland under a false name; his identity was discovered and he was discharged. On 6 March 1956, stating that he was a journalist of Bondi, he married a widow Anne Martin, née Burton, in Sydney. In 1964, with his wife, he attended the opening of VC Corner in the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. He was adamant that his VC would not end up there, as he took the view that ‘lumping’ all the VCs together cheapened the award. On 6 July 1967 Maxwell collapsed and died of a heart attack in a street in his home suburb of Matraville; he had for some time been an invalid pensioner. After a service with military honours at St Matthias Anglican Church, Paddington, he was cremated. His widow donated his medals to the Army Museum, Victoria Barracks, Paddington.[158]\n\nDied: 6 July 1967, Matraville, New South Wales [electorate of Kingsford Smith].[159]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Cremated at Eastern Suburbs Crematorium, Botany Bay, New South Wales [electorate of Kingsford Smith].[160]\n\nThomas James Bede Kenny\n\nBorn: 29 September 1896, Paddington, New South Wales [electorate of Wentworth].[161]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nSon of Austin James Kenny, butcher, from Auckland, New Zealand, and his wife Mary Christina, née Connolly, of New South Wales. Bede Kenny was educated at the Christian Brothers’ College, Waverley. He began to train as a chemist’s assistant at Bondi but after three months he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 23 August 1915.[162]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Bondi, New South Wales [electorate of Wentworth].[163]\n\nEnlistment date: 23 August 1915.[164]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 9 April 1917—Hermies, France.[165]\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty, when his platoon was held up by an enemy strong point, and severe casualties prevented progress. Private Kenny, under very heavy fire at close range, dashed alone towards the enemy’s position, killed one man in advance of the strong point who endeavoured to bar his way. He then bombed the position, captured the gun crew, all of whom he had wounded, killed an officer who showed fight, and seized the gun. Pte. Kenny’s gallant action enabled his platoon to occupy the position, which was of great local importance.[166]\n\nUnit at time of action: 2nd Battalion, 1st Brigade, 1st Division, AIF.[167]\n\nLife after the war:\n\nThough he described his injuries as ‘nothing to write home about’ he was invalided to Australia in August 1918, having become a corporal that month. He arrived in Sydney on 9 October to a tumultuous welcome. He rejected an offer to join the military police, whom he disliked intensely, and was discharged on 12 December. Returning to civilian life, Kenny first worked for Clifford Love & Co., manufacturers, importers and merchants, as their northern New South Wales traveller. He then joined the Sunday Times newspaper in Sydney, and shortly after became a traveller for Penfolds Wines Ltd. He married Kathleen Dorothy Buckley, a florist, at St Mary’s Cathedral, on 29 September 1927; they had three children and their home is remembered as a happy one. Kenny repeatedly suffered the effects of trench feet; the war had also made him partially deaf. He never recovered from the deaths of his elder daughter in 1943 and his only son in 1948 (both from rheumatic fever). Survived by his wife and one daughter, he died in Concord Repatriation Hospital, Sydney, on 15 April 1953 and was buried in Botany cemetery. It was a bitter irony that the pall bearers at his funeral were military policemen. Kenny was a staunch Catholic, a vital man of immense character and physical stature. He had no shortage of friends and was often involved in good-natured pranks. Though he never talked openly of his wartime experiences, he always led the V.C. winners in the Sydney Anzac Day march. In 1957 the Bede Kenny Memorial Ward was opened at Wentworth Private Hospital, Randwick, to provide beds for ex-servicemen ineligible for repatriation hospital treatment.[168]\n\nDied: 15 April 1953, Concord, New South Wales [electorate of Reid].\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Botany Cemetery, Matraville, New South Wales [electorate of Kingsford Smith].[169]\n\nMark Gregor Strang Donaldson\n\nBorn: 2 April 1979, Waratah, New South Wales [electorate of Newcastle].[170]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nHe spent his formative years in northern NSW where he graduated from high school in 1996. Trooper Donaldson enlisted into the Australian Army on 18 June 2002 and entered recruit training at the Army Recruit Training Centre, Kapooka, NSW. He demonstrated an early aptitude for soldiering and was awarded the prizes for best shot and best at physical training in his platoon. Subsequently he was allocated to the Royal Australian Infantry Corps and posted to the school of infantry at Singleton, NSW, where he excelled in his initial employment training. At the completion of this training he was again awarded best shot and best at physical training, as well as the award for the most outstanding soldier in his platoon. He was posted to 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Townsville, QLD in November 2002. It was during this time that Trooper Donaldson decided to pursue his ambition to join the Special Air Service Regiment. In February 2004, he successfully completed the Special Air Service Regiment selection course and was posted to the regiment in May 2004. He was then posted to I Troop, 3 Special Air Service Squadron. Since that time he has been deployed on operations to East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nOn 12 August 2008, Trooper Donaldson was wounded in action whilst conducting nighttime operations in Oruzgan Province, Afghanistan. He recovered from his minor wounds and continued on the deployment. Trooper Donaldson was involved in an incident on 2 September 2008 in Oruzgan Province, Afghanistan that resulted in him being awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia. He was invested by her Excellency the Governor-General of Australia at Government House, Canberra on 16 January 2009. Trooper Donaldson remains posted to the Special Air Service Regiment in Perth, WA. Trooper Donaldson is married to Emma and has a daughter Kaylee. His parents are deceased.[171]\n\nEnlistment date: 18 June 2002.[172]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: Oruzgan Province, Afghanistan.[173]\n\nFor most conspicuous acts of gallantry in action in a circumstance of great peril in Afghanistan as part of the Special Operations Task Group during Operation SLIPPER, Oruzgan Province, Afghanistan. Trooper Mark Gregor Donaldson enlisted into the Australian Army on 18 June 2002. After completing Recruit and Initial and Employment Training he was posted to the 1st Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment. Having successfully completed the Special Air Service Selection Course in April 2004, Trooper Donaldson was posted to Special Air Service Regiment in May 2004.\n\nOn 2 September 2008, during the conduct of a fighting patrol, Trooper Donaldson was travelling in a combined Afghan, US and Australian vehicle convoy that was engaged by a numerically superior, entrenched and coordinated enemy ambush. The ambush was initiated by a high volume of sustained machine gun fire coupled with the effective use of rocket propelled grenades. Such was the effect of the initiation that the combined patrol suffered numerous casualties, completely lost the initiative and became immediately suppressed. It was over two hours before the convoy was able to establish a clean break and move to an area free of enemy fire. In the early stages of the ambush, Trooper Donaldson reacted spontaneously to regain the initiative. He moved rapidly between alternate positions of cover engaging the enemy with 66mm and 84mm anti-armour weapons as well as his M4 rifle. During an early stage of the enemy ambush, he deliberately exposed himself to enemy fire in order to draw attention to himself and thus away from wounded soldiers. This selfless act alone bought enough time for those wounded to be moved to relative safety.\n\nAs the enemy had employed the tactic of a rolling ambush, the patrol was forced to conduct numerous vehicle manoeuvres, under intense enemy fire, over a distance of approximately four kilometres to extract the convoy from the engagement area. Compounding the extraction was the fact that casualties had consumed all available space within the vehicles. Those who had not been wounded, including Trooper Donaldson, were left with no option but to run beside the vehicles throughout. During the conduct of this vehicle manoeuvre to extract the convoy from the engagement area, a severely wounded coalition force interpreter was inadvertently left behind. Of his own volition and displaying complete disregard for his own safety, Trooper Donaldson moved alone, on foot, across approximately 80 metres of exposed ground to recover the wounded interpreter. His movement, once identified by the enemy, drew intense and accurate machine gun fire from entrenched positions. Upon reaching the wounded coalition force interpreter, Trooper Donaldson picked him up and carried him back to the relative safety of the vehicles then provided immediate first aid before returning to the fight. On subsequent occasions during the battle, Trooper Donaldson administered medical care to other wounded soldiers, whilst continually engaging the enemy.\n\nTrooper Donaldson’s acts of exceptional gallantry in the face of accurate and sustained enemy fire ultimately saved the life of a coalition force interpreter and ensured the safety of the other members of the combined Afghan, US and Australian force. Trooper Donaldson’s actions on this day displayed exceptional courage in circumstances of great peril. His actions are of the highest accord and are in keeping with the finest traditions of the Special Operations Command, the Australian Army and the Australian Defence Force.[174]\n\nUnit at time of action: Special Operations Task Group.[175]\n\nAlbert Edward Chowne\n\nBorn: 19 July 1920, Willoughby, New South Wales [electorate of North Sydney].[176]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nSeventh child of Balmain-born parents Arthur James Chowne, grocer, and his wife Frances Ellen, née Dalziel. The Chowne and Dalziel families were well known in the Willoughby district where Bert grew up. Educated at Chatswood Boys’ Intermediate High and Naremburn Junior Technical schools, he started work in 1935 as a shirtcutter at David Jones Ltd. Chowne played for Gordon Rugby Union Football Club, and also enjoyed scouting and tennis. He was 5 ft 9 ins (175 cm) tall, with brown hair, a fair complexion and hazel eyes. Having served briefly in the Militia’s 36th Battalion, on 27 May 1940 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force; he described himself as a salesman, probably to avoid reserved-occupation status.[177]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Willoughby, New South Wales [electorate of North Sydney].[178]\n\nEnlistment date: 27 May 1940.[179]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 25 March 1945, near Dagua, Papua New Guinea.[180]\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery, brilliant leadership and devotion to duty during an attack on an enemy position on a narrow ridge near Dagua, New Guinea, on 25th March, 1945. After the capture of Dagua, the main enemy force withdrew southwards from the beach to previously prepared positions on the flank of the Division. Further movement towards Wewak was impossible while this threat to the flank existed and the Battalion was ordered to destroy the enemy force. ‘A’ Company, after making contact with the enemy on a narrow ridge, was ordered to attack the position. The leading Platoon in the attack came under heavy fire from concealed enemy machine guns site on a small rise dominating the approach. In the initial approach one member of this Platoon was killed and nine wounded, including the Platoon Commander, and the enemy continued to inflict casualties on our troops. Without awaiting orders, Lieutenant Chowne, whose Platoon was in reserve, instantly appreciated the plight of the leading Platoon and rushed the enemy's position. Running up a steep, narrow track, he hurled grenades which knocked out two enemy Light-Machine Guns. Then, calling on his men to follow him and firing his submachine gun from the hip, he charged the enemy's position. Although he sustained two serious wounds in the chest, the impetus of his charge carried him 50 yards forward under the most intense machine gun and rifle fire. Lieutenant Chowne accounted for two more Japanese before he was killed standing over three foxholes occupied by the enemy. The superb heroism and self-sacrifice of this officer, culminating in his death, resulted in the capture of this strongly-held enemy position, ensured the further immediate success of his Company in this area and paved the way directly for the continuance of the Division's advance to Wewak.[181]\n\nUnit at time of action: 2/2nd Battalion, 16th Brigade, 6th Division, AIF.[182] Died: 25 March 1945, between Dagua and Wewak, Papua New Guinea.[183]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Lae War Cemetery, Papua New Guinea..[184]\n\nPatrick Joseph Bugden\n\nBorn: 17 March 1897, Lismore, New South Wales [electorate of Page].[185]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nEldest child of Thomas Bugden, farmer, and his wife Annie, née Connolly, both native-born.

Educated at Gundurimba Public School and the convent school at Tatham, he later worked for his stepfather as a barman at the Federal Hotel, Alstonville; outgoing and popular, he excelled at football, cricket and shot-putting. Before joining the Australian Imperial Force he completed twelve months military training under the compulsory scheme introduced in 1911.[186] Previous military service: Served for 1 year in the Compulsory Military Training scheme.[187]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Alstonville, New South Wales [electorate of Page].[188]\n\nEnlistment date: 25 May 1916.[189]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 26–28 September 1917—Polygon Wood, Belgium.[190]\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty when on two occasions our advance was temporarily held up by strongly-defended ‘pill-boxes.’ Pte. Bugden, in the face of devastating fire from machine guns, gallantly led small parties to attack these strong points and, successfully silencing the machine guns with bombs, captured the garrison at the point of the bayonet. On another occasion, when a corporal, who had become detached from his company, had been captured and was being taken to the rear by the enemy, Pte. Bugden, single-handed, rushed to the rescue of his comrade, shot one enemy and bayoneted the remaining two, thus releasing the Corporal. On five occasions he rescued wounded men under intense shell and machine-gun fire, showing an utter contempt and disregard for danger. Always foremost in volunteering for any dangerous mission, it was during the execution of one of these missions that this gallant soldier was killed.[191]\n\nUnit at time of action: 31st Battalion, 8th Brigade, 5th Division, AIF.[192]\n\nDied: 28 September 1917, Polygon Wood, Belgium.[193]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Hooge Crater Cemetery, Zillebeke, Belgium.[194]\n\nAlexander Henry Buckley\n\nBorn: 22 July 1891, Warren, New South Wales [electorate of Parkes].[195]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nFourth child of James Buckley, selector, and his wife Julia, née Falkanhagan, both of whom were Victorian-born.

After passing the first objective his half-company and part of the company on the flank were held up by an enemy machinegun nest. With one man he rushed the post, shooting four of the occupants and taking 22 prisoners. Later on, reaching a moat, it was found that another machine-gun nest commanded the only available foot-bridge. Whilst this was being engaged from a flank Corporal Buckley endeavoured to cross the bridge and rush the post, but was killed in the attempt. Throughout the advance he had displayed great initiative, resource and courage, and by his effort to save his comrades from casualties, he set a fine example of self-sacrificing devotion to duty.[200]\n\nUnit at time of action: 54th Battalion, 14th Brigade, 5th Division, AIF.[201]\n\nDied: 1 September 1918, Peronne, France.[202]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Peronne Communal Cemetery Extension, Peronne, France.[203]\n\nArthur Charles Hall\n\nBorn: 11 August 1896, Granville, New South Wales [electorate of Parramatta].[204]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nEldest son of Charles Hall, grazier, of Glenelg station near Nyngan, and his wife Emma Jane, née King. He attended All Saints’ College, Bathurst, in 1909–12 and became an overseer on his father’s properties.[205] Previous military service: Served in the Senior Cadets for two years.[206]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Nyngan, New South Wales [electorate of Parkes].[207]\n\nEnlistment date: 3 April 1916.[208]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 1–2 September 1918, Peronne, France.[209]\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery, brilliant leadership, and devotion to duty during the operations at Peronne on 1st and 2nd September, 1918. During the attack on the 1st September a machine gun post was checking the advance. Single handed [Corporal Hall] rushed the position, shot four of the occupants, and captured nine others, and two machine guns. Then crossing the objective with a small party, he afforded excellent covering support to the remainder of the company. Continuously in advance of the main party, he located enemy posts of resistance and personally led parties to the assault. In this way he captured many small parties of prisoners and machine guns. On the morning of the 2nd September, during a heavy barrage, he carried to safety a comrade who had been dangerously wounded and was urgently in need of medical attention, and immediately returned to his post. The energy and personal courage of this gallant non-commissioned officer contributed largely to the success of the operations, throughout which he showed utter disregard of danger and inspired confidence in all.[210]\n\nUnit at time of action: 54th Battalion, 14th Brigade, 5th Division, AIF.[211]\n\nLife after the war:\n\nOn 11 October 1918 he was transferred to the 56th Battalion and on 6 March 1919 was promoted temporary sergeant a rank he retained until his discharge from the AIF on 3 August in Sydney. After demobilization Hall returned to the Nyngan district where he bought a pastoral property, Gundooee station, near Coolabah. On 26 April 1927 he married Catherine Jessie Hemington Harris at the Union Church, Lahey’s Creek, with Anglican rites. In 1942 he served as a lieutenant in the 7th Garrison Battalion and on returning to Gundooee carried on his pastoral activities, running sheep and building up a fine herd of Poll Devon cattle. He was president of the Nyngan Picnic Race Club for twenty years and was a foundation member and keen competitor in the Coolabah District Rifle Club; he was also active in the Nyngan District Historical Society. Survived by his wife, a daughter and three sons, Hall died in Nyngan District Hospital on 25 February 1978. He was buried at the tiny Anglican Church of St Matthew’s, West Bogan, which had been built from timber cut and milled on his property. His estate was sworn for probate at $160,191. He left his Victoria Cross to the Australian War Memorial.[212]\n\nDied: 25 February 1978, Nyngan, New South Wales [electorate of Parkes].[213]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: West Bogan Anglican Cemetery, Coolabah, New South Wales [electorate of Parkes].[214]\n\nJohn Woods Whittle\n\nBorn: 3 August 1883, Huon Island, Tasmania [electorate of Franklin].[215]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nSon of Henry Whittle, labourer, and his wife Catherine, née Sullivan. John enlisted as a private in Tasmania’s 4th (2nd Imperial Bushmen) Contingent which reached South Africa on 24 April 1901, saw action in the Cape Colony and returned to Tasmania in June 1902. Soon after, he enlisted in the Royal Navy and served for five years as a stoker before joining the Permanent Military Forces. On 23 July 1909 at the archbishop’s house, Hobart, he married with Catholic rites Emily Margaret Roland; they were to have six children.[216] Previous military service: Served for 3.6 years, Senior Cadets; five years, Royal Navy; one year in South African War; one year, Australian Field Artillery.[217]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Claremont, Tasmania [electorate of Denison].[218]\n\nEnlistment date: 6 August 1915.[219]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 9 April 1917—Boursies, France.[220]\n\nFor conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty on two occasions. When in command of a platoon, the enemy, under cover of an intense artillery barrage, attacked the small trench he was holding. Owing to weight of numbers the enemy succeeded in entering the trench, and it was owing to Sjt. Whittle personally collecting all available men and charging the enemy that the position was regained. On the second occasion when the enemy broke through the left of our line, Sjt. Whittle’s own splendid example was the means of keeping the men well in hand. His platoon were suffering heavy casualties and the enemy endeavoured to bring up a machine gun to enfilade the position. Grasping the situation, he rushed alone across the fire swept ground and attacked the hostile gun crew with bombs before the gun could be got into action. He succeeded in killing the whole crew and in bringing back the machine gun to our position.[221]\n\nUnit at time of action: 12th Battalion, 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, AIF.[222]\n\nLife after the war:\n\nWounded again during the German offensive of March 1918, and once more in late July, Whittle returned to Australia with other VC winners in October 1918 to take part in a planned recruiting drive. Following the Armistice, he was discharged on 15 December and lived in Sydney. He made a desperate plea in 1932: ‘I have been trying to struggle on for some time, but the children are badly in need of boots and clothing for the winter, and I cannot get any work’. Within a month he was employed by the Western Assurance Co. On 7 February 1934 he saved a small boy from drowning in an ornamental pool in University Park; though Whittle departed without giving his name, the deed became widely known. Survived by his wife, three daughters and a son, he died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 2 March 1946 at Glebe and was buried in Rookwood cemetery. Whittle and Newland were the only Australian VC winners of World War I to have been permanent servicemen before the war. One of Whittle’s sons, Ivan Ernest, had joined the AIF and was killed in September 1943 when a bomber crashed into the 2/33rd Battalion marshalling area near Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.[223]\n\nDied: 2 March 1946, Glebe, New South Wales [electorate of Sydney].[224]\n\nPlace of burial or cremation: Rookwood Cemetery, Rookwood, New South Wales [electorate of Watson].[225]\n\nJohn Hurst Edmondson\n\nBorn: 8 October 1914,Wagga Wagga, New South Wales [electorate of Riverina].[226]\n\nLife before the war:\n\nOnly child of native-born parents Joseph William Edmondson, farmer, and his wife Maude Elizabeth, née Hurst. The family moved to a farm near Liverpool when Jack was a child. Educated at Hurlstone Agricultural High School, he worked with his father and became a champion rifle-shooter. He was a council-member of the Liverpool Agricultural Society and acted as a steward at its shows. Having served (from March 1939) in the 4th Battalion, Militia, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 20 May 1940 and was posted to the 2nd/17th Battalion. Later that month he was promoted acting corporal (substantive in November). Well built and about 5 ft 9 ins (175 cm) tall, Edmondson settled easily into army life and was known as a quiet but efficient soldier.[227]\n\nPlace of residence at time of enlistment: Liverpool, New South Wales [electorate of Fowler].[228]\n\nEnlistment date: 20th May 1940.[229]\n\nDescription of action for which VC awarded: 13–14 April 1941—Tobruk, Libya.[230]\n\nOn the night of the 13-14th April, 1941, a party of German infantry broke through the wire defences at Tobruk and established themselves with at least six machine guns, mortars and two small field pieces. It was decided to attack them with bayonets, and a party consisting of one officer, Corporal Edmondson and five privates, took part in the charge. During the counter-attack Corporal Edmondson was wounded in the neck and stomach but continued to advance under heavy fire and killed one enemy with his bayonet. Later, his officer had his bayonet in one of the enemy and was grasped about the legs by him, when another attacked him from behind. He called for help, and Corporal Edmondson, who was some yards away, immediately came to his assistance and in spite of his wounds, killed both of the enemy. This action undoubtedly saved his officer’s life. Shortly after returning from this successful counter-attack, Corporal Edmondson died of his wounds. His actions throughout the operations were outstanding for resolution, leadership and conspicuous bravery.[231]\n"
