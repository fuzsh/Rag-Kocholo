        "text": "The armed forces of the Commonwealth of Australia consisted of two services: the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy.\n\nOfficial History of Australia in the War of 1914â€“1918 at the Australian War Memorial.\n\nSee also naming conventions for Australian units.\n\nAustralian Army\n\nKnown as \"Commonwealth Military Forces\" or \"Australian Military Forces\". Formed after federation and governed by 1903 Defence Act, which made it illegal for a standing force of infantry to exist, and for conscripts to serve overseas. The head of the Army was the Chief of General Staff. All branches of the army were under the Australian General Staff.\n\nBefore the First World War, the two branches were:\n\nPermanent Force\n\nCitizen Military Force\n\nDuring the First World War, two expeditionary forces were raised. These were effectively new branches of the army:\n\nAustralian Imperial Force\n\nAustralian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force\n\nSee also Australian War Memorial: One army, two armies? and Wikipedia:History of the Australian Army.\n\nThe main administrative corps and departments of the home forces were:\n\nAustralian Army Medical Corps (had Permanent and Citizen sections)\n\nAustralian Army Service Corps (had Permanent and Citizen sections)\n\nAustralian Army Veterinary Corps (had Permanent and Citizen sections)\n\nAustralian Engineer and Railway Staff Corps\n\nAustralian Intelligence Corps\n\nAustralian Volunteer Automobile Corps\n\nRoyal Australian Engineers (Permanent Force only)\n\nRoyal Australian Field Artillery (Permanent Force only)\n\nRoyal Australian Garrison Artillery (Permanent Force only)\n\nAustralian Chaplains' Department\n\nAustralian Ordnance Department\n\nAustralian Pay Department\n\nAustralian Army Nursing Service\n\nAustralia was divided into military districts, one for each state of the federation:\n\n1st Military District, Australian (Queensland)\n\n2nd Military District, Australian (New South Wales)\n\n3rd Military District, Australian (Victoria)\n\n4th Military District, Australian (South Australia)\n\n5th Military District, Australian (Western Australia)\n\n6th Military District, Australian (Tasmania)\n\nAustralian Imperial Force\n\nEarly in the war this was sometimes known as the Expeditionary Force, or large Expeditionary Force, but it's more commonly known by its official title, Australian Imperial Force. This was an all-volunteer force raised for overseas service in the First World War. Legally separate from the Permanent Force and Citizen Military Force (see below) to avoid the limitations imposed by the 1903 Defence Act, but organized by the exising general staff, and many officers and soldiers from the Permanent and Citizen forces volunteered to transfer to the AIF. Disbanded 1 April 1921 but Citizen Military Force inherited the names of its battalions and divisions.\n\nSee also Wikipedia:First Australian Imperial Force.\n\nDivisions and corps\n\nAustralian and
