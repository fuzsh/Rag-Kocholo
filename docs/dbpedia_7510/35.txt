Until October 1939 divisional headquarters and district base headquarters came directly under the control of the Military Board. In October 1939 the Command organization was introduced into the AMF to reduce the number of lower formations directly under the control of Army Headquarters and to bring the peace organization into line with the war organization. Northern, Eastern, Southern and Western Commands were created, each roughly conforming with the state boundaries of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia respectively. The 4th and 6th Military Districts (South Australia and Tasmania) came under control of Southern Command, while 7th Military District and later 8th Military District (Northern Territory, and the Territories of Papua and New Guinea) were the responsibility of AHQ. In January 1942 base headquarters were formed in Northern, Eastern, and Southern Commands to separate the administrative role from the Command headquarters which retained the operational role.

The higher command organization underwent a complete reorganization in April 1942, Command Headquarters forming corps or divisional headquarters, while base and military district headquarters were organized into line of communication area headquarters. In certain areas, notably New Guinea, Northern Territory, and Tasmania, force headquarters were raised, these having both an operational and line of communication role.

Prior to the reorganization of the Australian Military Forces in April 1942 little interest was shown in providing colour patches for formation headquarters above divisional level, although Corps and Overseas Base Sub-Area headquarters patches had been approved for the Second AIF during 1939/1940. Coloured armlets were deemed sufficient to distinguish officers allotted for duty in certain appointments with higher formation or base headquarters of the Home Forces. In June 1941 the MGO submitted proposals for the allocation of colour patches to higher formation headquarters, and that some efforts were taken in this direction is evidenced by No. 400. A scheme of colour patches was submitted almost immediately upon the reorganization of the command structure in April 1942,(see note 85) and thereafter colour patches were worn by all levels of headquarters until the abolition of the system.

Note 85. Initial proposal was submitted by '0' Branch on 20.4.1942 and was concurred in, with one modification, by 'A' Branch on 21.4.1942. An AG Minute dated 13.5.1942 (AA[Vic.]: MP 508/1, item 107/701/56) makes reference to colour patches recently approved for respective L of C headquarters, and initial order for manufacture was MGO Order No. 2417, placed by LHQ(MGO) Memo No. 62365, 17.6.1942.

It will be noted that many units, and individual personnel, of certain corps and services were not allotted a distinctive colour patch but wore the colour patch of the headquarters of the formation to which they were attached or allotted for duty. Information relating to these units is contained in the sections pertaining to each arm or service.

400. Headquarters Southern Command, 1942: Ref. Extract of HQ Southern Command

memo dated 11.4.1942 located in AA(Vic): CRS B1540, item 36/702. This memo

advised AHQ that this colour patch was currently on issue to the unit, and requested

permission to retain it following redesignation as HQ 1st Aust. Corps on 15.4.1942.

This patch would appear to have been unofficial, or at least adopted in anticipation of

approval being given, as on 9.4.1942 the authorisation of distinctive colour patches AHQ, Command, Base and District headquarters was still under consideration by the Adjutant-General. Ref. AA(Vic): MP 508/1, item 107/701/56.

A scheme of colour patches for all units of this division had been tentatively approved in January 1941, the shape being an inverted triangle. This was modified to the pentagon shape when it was found that inverted triangles were already in use by some AASC units in the Middle East. On 7.3.1941 the various Commands were advised by AHQ that a requisition had been placed with the CCF for the supply

of colour patches for units of this division.

HQ AMF Details, Labuan, 1946: Auth. GRO 225/1943, 12.3.1943. The 'T' shaped colour patch designed for this division stood for Tobruk although this was not admitted by its instigator, Lt.-Gen. Sir L. J. Morsehead, until 1952. (Letter, L. J. Morsehead to A. W. Bazley, 25.2.1952.) After the relief of the 9th Division from Tobruk he had decided that the units of the division should wear a common shape, but that as all other simple shapes had long since been allotted to other formations, he had settled on a combination of two oblongs, the larger one on top. Colour patches approved under this scheme were first issued on 17.12.1942, (Tobruk and El Alamein, Barton Maughan, p.750-1.) and LHQ was informed of the change by HQ AIF(ME) Memo No. 14973, dated 22.1.1943.

428. Headquarters 10th Aust. Division: There is no particular evidence that this patch was ever issued, although provisional approval would appear to have been granted by 13.5.1942 and it appears in colour plates undertaken after that date. (AA(Vic): MP 508/1, item 36/702/136.) It however had been deleted prior to the promulgation of the authorities for formation headquarters appearing in GRO 149/1942. This unit had been raised as HQ Newcastle Covering Force in September 1941 and was redesignated in April 1942, comprising at that stage the 1st and 32nd Brigades.

24th Aust. Motor Regiment, 1942: Auth. AAO 141/1939, 31.5.1939. The initial authority was AHQ(DOS) Memo No. 9647, 28.3.1939, although the basis of allocation of this design was queried by the regiment and HQ 1st Cavalry Division. AHQ advised that the practice was being followed of allocating designs used by the original AIF, regardless of whether they conformed with the organization of the formation. Although the designation of this regiment had been carried in the title of the 12th/24th Light Horse Regiment since 1936, it was first raised as a separate unit on 1. 1. 1939. Disbanded in May 1942.

Note: LHQ Posting and Appointment Orders refer to both 102nd Armoured Regiment and 102nd Motor Regiment in relation to the 2nd Armoured Regiment, however there is no indication in unit Routine Orders Part Il that the unit adopted these designations at any stage.

(c) 3rd Armoured Regiment, 1941-1942;

3rd Aust. Army Tank Battalion, 1942: Ref. RAAC Museum, Puckapunyal. Raised in March 1941 by expansion of 1st Light Tank Company, Aust. Tank Corps, and was transferred to the Aust. Armoured Corps in May 1942.

Note: A series of paintings of Australian Armoured Corps unit colour patches held in the RAAC Tank Museum at Puckapunyal suggests that the 2nd Armoured Regiment wore brown to the front, and that 2nd Light Tank Company wore brown to the top (see No. 1113). It has not been possible to confirm either design. The colours brown, red and green, in that order, are those of the Royal Tank Corps, which when flown horizontally as a flag always have green to the top, and as currently worn by its successor, the Royal Tank Regiment, on shoulder slides, are arranged vertically with brown to the front.

Note: Fake examples of No's 483, 484, 486 and 487 exist, either specifically made, or more

commonly by removing the tank inset from colour patches of units of the 2nd Aust. Armoured Brigade, No's 517, 519, 520A and 521.

488. HQ 3rd Aust. Motor Brigade, 1942: Auth. GRO 301/1942, 7.8.1942. Superseded by No. 492 in November 1942. Transferred to 1st Aust. Armoured Division in October 1942 as a motor brigade group.

Note: The first authority for the change in the colour patches of this brigade was given by the GOC 1st Aust. Armoured Division in November 1942.(See Note 90) At that stage official policy was that colour patches allotted to specific units would not be changed on transfer to another formation, in this case from 2nd Aust. Motor Division to 1st Aust. Armoured Division. LHQ, when they were belatedly informed of the change in late May 1943, varied this policy for 3rd Aust. Motor

Brigade because it involved only an alteration in the manner in which the existing colour patches were worn.

It is believed that these colours, traditionally those of the 3rd Light Horse Regiment, were allotted because the 9th Motor Regiment was formed after unlinking from the former 9th/23rd Light Horse Regiment by the transfer to it on 6.1.1942 of the majority of personnel of the 3rd Light Horse Regiment.

497. 15th Aust. Motor Regiment, 1942: Auth. LHQ (MGO) Memo No. 59218, 9.6.1942. Allotted to 1st Aust. Armoured Brigade. Superseded unofficially by No. 485 in late 1942.

498. 15th Aust. Motor Regiment, 1943-1944: Ref. MGO Branch Line Drawings, p.26. No official authority has been located for this colour patch, which is believed to have been issued to the regiment soon after their transfer to 1st Aust. Armoured Brigade Group in February 1943.

17.9.1943. This unit was originally reorganized to provide an administrative headquarters for the seven existing independent companies, and as such had submitted a design of colour patch for approval which comprised a double diamond in cavalry colours. This was rejected by LHQ who directed that regimental headquarters would wear the LHQ colour patch. (LHQ (CGS) Memo No. 90863, 3.6.1943. AA(Vic.): MP 742/1, item 61/13/72.) After further consideration this colour patch was approved to replace all existing patches worn by RHQ and the independent companies. The regiment was reorganized from late 1943 to comprise the 2/3rd, 2/5th, and 2/6th Aust. Commando Squadrons, all of which wore No. 503.
