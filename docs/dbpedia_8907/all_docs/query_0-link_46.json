Do you guys think that the Golden Years for Disney channel during the early-mid 2000's were similar to the golden years to Nick during the early-mid 90's?\n\nThe reason I ask this is because when I look at '90's Nickelodeon' nostalgia (be it on YouTube, forums, blogs, collages, etc.), many of the lists include Nick's live action shows. Heck arguably, most of the weight on Classic Nick nostalgia is placed on Nickcoms, rather than Nicktoons.\n\nhttp://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/logosfake/images/8/80/Nick_Narrow_Splat.png/revision/latest?cb=20140306154204\n\nShows like Clarissa Explains It All, Pete & Pete, All That, Are You Afraid of The Dark? and Kenan & Kel to name a few, remain hit classics on the network. We also cannot forget Nick's epic game shows like Double Dare and Legends of the Hidden Temple, amongst others. And of course Nick's iconic Nicktoons, Rugrats, Doug, Ren & Stimpy, etc. When I talk to 80's babies, these shows and programs are usually what come to mind when discussing 'old school' Nick.\n\nhttp://www.rotoscopers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/classic-nick.jpg\n\no42x1_1_RbgZvYvqQuqhiI\n\nNow I see a lot of people comparing Nick's golden age to Cartoon Network's Powerhouse Era (from 1997-2004), aka when CN was in its golden age. While I agree that there are many similarities (Nicktoons v. Cartoon Cartoons, Wide variety of programming, etc.), CN during the late 90's/early 00's had no live action shows on the network. Because of this comparing Nick's GA to CN's GA, doesn't really make that much sense. I actually thought CN actually had more in common with Toon Disney (Disney's 'Cartoon Network' essentially) than it did to Nick.\n\nhttp://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/logo-timeline/images/b/b4/Logo_disneychannel1999-2002_zoog.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141005131454\n\nOne match up I'm starting to see more often now (and for good reason) is Nick's GA being compared to Disney Channel's GA (from 1997-2006). The reasons this match up makes more sense is because both channels were VERY obscure before their golden ages, despite having a few good classics (ie on Disney; Kids Incorporated and The New Mickey Mouse Club. On Nick; You Can't Do That on Television and Hey Dude). They both also massively rose into popularity once their golden ages began, with Nick in 1991 with the launch of the 3 original Nicktoons, & Disney in 1997 when it became a basic cable package. They both also were known for both their animation and live action shows. I already mentioned the Nickelodeon classics, but Disney Channel classics aren't limited to these variations. Live action shows like The Famous Jett Jackson, So Weird, Even Stevens, Lizzie McGuire, and That's So Raven, along with reruns of Boy Meets World and Sister Sister. Game shows like Bug Juice. And of course cartoons like Kim Possible and The Proud Family, along with reruns of Recess and Pepper Ann.\n\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/8d/6c/9b/8d6c9bcc98a89c0786ebadb36ff432aa.jpg\n\n-uEtgEMga34rVD3q3s0Yw0\n\nIf you think about it, both channel's during their golden ages had their memorable live action shows, game shows, & cartoons. Plus the respective channels had certain aces up their sleeves. Nick had yearly events like the Kids Choice Awards, and they had a nighttime block for adults called Nick@Nite. Disney Channel on the other hand had Vault Disney (at least during the 97'-02' period) which reran classic Walt Disney shorts, and most notably Disney Channel Original Movies.\n\nSo which do you prefer, Nick's Golden Age in the 1990's or Disney Channel's Golden Age in the 2000's?\n\nIf you're wondering what my opinion is, I'll give my answer shortly! Honestly, at least for me, this seems like a pretty even match and could go either way.\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: Zelek3\n\nYou sure about 2006 being golden age DC?

I didn't watch much Disney Channel.\n\nWeirdly enough, I'd take early 2000s Nickelodeon over early 2000s Disney as well ;D House of Mouse was a spectacular show though.\n\nDespite what you said in your OP though, CN /Kids WB were kings. Whoever had the anime was king!\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: 80sfan\n\nI prefer Nickelodeon's Golden Age, because I like the 1991 to 1998 era way more than the 1997 to 2005/2006 era.\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: Howard\n\nI only remember Old School Nickelodeon cause that's when I started watching You Can't Do That On Television during the early 1990's.\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: Ripley\n\nFor me it will always be Nickelodeon. In the 90's and early 2000's Disney had great DCOMs. But there have only been a few shows on there I watched a lot, Lizzie, Even Stevens and Raven. I like Good Luck Charlie, their first good show in several years but it's been a few years now since it went off the air. I watched Nick every day from 91 until Kenan & Kel's last episode in 2000.\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: 2001\n\nMy sister was watching this dude on YouTube compare \"new\" and \"old\" Disney stars, and how everything was better in the old days. He considered Hannah Montana and High School Musical as the golden age. Idk how old he was but he looked in his late teens at least. ;D\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: mxcrashxm\n\nI prefer both as I watched their GAs during my childhood, and I agree that both networks had their own diversity, something that one unfortunately doesn't see at all today on neither channels.\n\nLooking at their GAs, I find it weird how both networks had more LA shows than actual cartoons. Until 1999, Nick only had 9 nicktoons while DC had a few prior to Kim possible. By their SAs, they had explosions of cartoons where they became more important than the LA programs. Then by the BAs, they had reversed back to more LAs and less cartoons.\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: 2001\n\nWait, Aladdin and Ducktales were a part of Disney Channel?

Here's some commercial breaks from what I consider to be the peak of Nickelodeon's Golden Era.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o42x1_1_Rbg http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t25U3aFUWYQ\n\nFor what it's worth, if I had to single out an \"absolute peak\" for Nick, I would say 1996. To me, it has the perfect blend of both early and later Golden Age content. You still had some early Golden Age shows (like Rugrats, Pete & Pete, Rocko's Modern Life, etc.) putting out new episodes, plus you also had some of the great later Golden Age shows (like Hey Arnold!, Kenan & Kel and KaBlam!) debuting that year as well. Of course, my family went to Nickelodeon Studios in the Summer of 1996, so I might be a bit biased for that reason.\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: SpyroKev\n\nI chose Disney Channel for 1997-2005. I couldn't connect with Nick as much as I tried. I don't like the vibe of most Nick cartoons. They felt depressive and weird to me. I could never get into sitcoms either. I give Nick credit for those two animated announcers though.\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: aja675\n\nBTW, Nickelodeon Asia thought of something just like The Splat 10 years ago. It was a block at rougly 8 or 9 PM called Classic Nick.\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: Zelek3\n\nWhen it comes to the periods where the kids' channels progressively declined, I'd have to say this:\n\nNick: 2004-2007\n\nCN: 2005-2007\n\nDisney: 2006-2007\n\nTheir declines began at different times, but by mid-late 2007, I'd say they had completed their declines (remaining good shows like Ned's Declassified, Drake & Josh, Danny Phantom, Kim Possible, and That's So Raven ended that year; while terrible new shows like Out of Jimmy's Head and Naked Brothers Band were premiering that year).\n\nNYEagle will probably disagree and that's fine, you're entitled to your opinion.\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: ZeldaFan20\n\nYou mean this?\n\nhttp://img09.deviantart.net/6641/i/2009/313/2/7/nicktoons_collage_by_astep2stage18.jpg\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: Zelek3\n\nSince this thread has seemingly evolved into a silver-age Nick thread, maybe I should make a thread for Silver Age Nick specifically?\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: ZeldaFan20\n\nGo right ahead! Question before you make your thread, what do you think was the overall better golden age, Disney Channel's or Nickelodeon's?\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: Ripley\n\nI still can't get over how The 90's Are All That failed when it was supposed to be a big thing. Splat is better at least.\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: Zelek3\n\nStick a fork in cable, because it's as done in 2017 as VHS was in 2007.\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: Zelek3\n\nThis is how I'd say it goes:\n\n1960 to Summer 1997: Peak of popularity for Saturday Morning cartoons, when they were as much an American institution as hot dogs, Mom's apple pie, Coca-Cola, guns, and red-white-and-blue flags. ;D\n\nFall 1997 to Winter 2006: Disney Afternoon switches to One Saturday Morning, the E/I mandate takes effect (it was proposed in 1996, but technically didn't take effect until 97), and other kids' channels begin going through some changes as well. Saturday Morning Cartoons were on the decline since the late 90s, but they still remained somewhat relevant at this time. There were still some home-runs in popularity at this time, like Pokemon.\n\nWinter 2006 to Fall 2014: Still technically existent, but dead AF at this time. Kids' WB, the remaining heavy-hitter, lost Pokemon to CN and moved to the CW, where they had nowhere near the amount of popularity as they used to. The lack of hit cartoons and growing competition from cable officially made SMC irrelevant.\n\nFall 2014 to present: Nonexistent\n\nSubject: Re: Golden Age Disney Channel (1997-2006) vs. Golden Age Nickelodeon (1991-1998)\n\nWritten By: mqg96\n\nI can use a perfect example right here, comparing some early 1998, early 2001, and early 2004 lineups and see how much of a change it was within 3 year spans. This was during the bronze age (by my definition).\n\nKids WB 1998:\n\nPinky and the Brain\n\nSuperman: The Animated Series\n\nMen in Black: The Series\n\nThe New Batman/Superman Adventures\n\nPinky and the Brain\n\nAnimaniacs\n\nThe Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries\n\n(Animaniacs is the only show from the '98 lineup that could been seen on Cartoon Network at the time, the rest of the shows could only be seen on Kids WB at the time)\n\nKids WB 2001:\n\nMax Steel\n\nMen in Black: The Series\n\nJackie Chan Adventures\n\nThe Zeta Project\n\nPokémon\n\nX-Men: Evolution\n\nStatic Shock\n\nBatman Beyond\n\nCardcaptors\n\n(Cardcaptors is THE ONLY show from the Kids WB '01 lineup that could be seen on Cartoon Network at the time thanks to the Toonami block, the rest of the shows, Kids WB only, although, Batman Beyond would join CN later in the year AFTER it was taken off Kids WB)\n\nKids WB 2004:\n\nWhat's New Scooby-Doo?\n\nStatic Shock\n\nTeen Titans\n\nXiaolin Showdown\n\nPokémon\n\nYu-Gi-Oh!\n\nJackie Chan Adventures\n\n¡Mucha Lucha!\n\n(Now this is where things get interesting, Teen Titans and What's New Scooby-Doo were very exclusive to Cartoon Network obviously. Static Shock and Jackie Chan Adventures were on Toonami/Miguzi for reruns. Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh's latest episodes were on Kids WB but the reruns could still be found on CN. Even Mucha Lucha joined the CN lineup for reruns by 2004. Xiaolin Showdown was the only show from the lineup that could only be seen on Kids WB. You see what I'm talking about?)\n\nOne Saturday Morning 1998:\n\n101 Dalmatians\n\nDoug\n\nRecess\n\nPepper Ann\n\nThe Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show\n\nJungle Cubs\n\nThe New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\n\nScience Court\n\n(The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and Jungle Cubs are the only shows from this lineup that could be seen on Disney Channel or Toon Disney.
