I don't recall having a problem with seeing older animation then...but then again, I am eccentric. It looks like it wasn't a problem for kid TV until sometime in the 2000s, when reruns became less of a prominent thing.\n\nAs someone who hardly remembers seeing Fox Kids shows back then, I did get a bit more of a taste of them in 2005 or so, thanks to the block. It was Jetix where I first got to see The Tick; I was hooked to the point of getting the DVDs (with 2/3 of the show) years later.\n\nThe noticeable difference between a cartoon that’s colored digitally between one that’s done by hand, the aspect ratio...\n\nHeck, even the art style. When Cartoon Network visited my art school years back, they said the reason Secret Saturdays didn’t take off was because it “looked” old as they tried going for a more modern-retro adventure look for the series.\n\nAnd that’s why you go through periods where cartoons all seem to have a similar style, or how some old cartoons get updated with a new look.\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk\n\nHmm... interesting.

I did notice how starting with Adventure Time a lot of cartoons all started to have the same visual style though. What was the artstyle trend for shows airing from 2002-2010, because I did not notice one?\n\nThat's odd, I could never tell the difference between cel animation, digital ink and paint, and flash until I was at least 10 years old.

More so than now, IMO.\n\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk\n\nIIRC, simplified, angular designs, or anime influenced. There were plenty of outliers, though.

But as for anime influence there's Avatar: The Last Airbender, Xiaolin Showdown, and Teen Titans, but that's about it. I wouldn't call only three shows a trend.\n\nI see what you're getting at with the simple angular shapes, that was probably an offshoot of SpongeBob a little bit.

Cartoons like Dexter's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls looked completely different in their first and last season.\n\nI believe it was the early Cartoon Network originals (i.e. Dexter's Lab, PPG) that, at least partly, led to the simple and angular look of many shows throughout the 2000s. Not denying that SpongeBob was influential, just not so much in that aspect.\n\nThere was definitely quite a number of anime-influenced cartoons during the 2000s, with some of them airing on Jetix. AFAIK it was during that time that anime influences were becoming mainstream.\n\nNot sure when I started noticing differences between older and newer animation production aspects. I imagine the age for that varies among people, but given how much things had changed up to the 2000s, maybe it was then that a breaking point was reached, or something like that.\n\nI was frown at Jetix for takeover most part of Toon Disney so Jetix is supposed to have separate channel or let re-run on ABC or ABC Family (Freeform).\n\nOr Disney Channel. Personally, I would have turned ABC Family into a kids/family network that showed the Disney networks’ third party and/or retro shows along with a Jetix block with the same principle, as well as given it a Disney Channel block with modern first party Jetix shows and its own channel replacing Toon Disney.

If I remember correctly, the schedule was 85% Jetix, 7% anything else. Toon Disney shifted from being a retro channel to \"All Jetix, \"All The Time\" channel. Many Toon Disney fans simply hated Jetix and wanted it gone. Jetix focused mostly on action centered programming, There was very little if any classic cartoons in the lineup at all.\n\nA 2 hour morning block later becomes a 15-17 hour block?!\n\nThat's so messed up.\n\nI still can't believe Jetix expanded from a 2 hour morning block in 2004 to a 15-17 hour block in 2006 after ABC Family decided they'd had enough of it, then it landed on Toon Disney, which basically DESTROYED the channel.

When Jetix started in 2004, it was a block on Fox Kids. It became a full channel in 2005 and didn't air any Disney programs except for Lizzie McGuire (2002-2005).\n\nIn late 2006, Jetix suddenly started airing Lilo & Stitch: The Series. In late 2007, Kim Possible got added to the schedule. They kept adding Disney cartoons and by 2009, Jetix NL was airing 13 Disney programs and people online hated it!\n\nTimon and Pumbaa\n\nRecess\n\nThe Weekenders\n\nLegend of Tarzan\n\nThe Proud Family\n\nKim Possible\n\nFillmore!\n\nLilo & Stitch: The Series\n\nAmerican Dragon: Jake Long\n\nThe Suite Life of Zack and Cody\n\nHannah Montana\n\nThe Replacements\n\nPhineas and Ferb\n\nI've never liked Jetix taking over Toon Disney. It ruined the magic of Disney. I don't know if it's Anne Sweeney's idea or not. If it is, I would not be surprise.\n\n“It doesn’t get much better than this”\n\nJETIX\n\nMore like “It doesn’t get much worse than this”\n\nJETIX\n\nThe opposite happened in the Netherlands.

You have this channel for young children, achieving all of the Disney animation cannon. And then BAM, you're hit with this action block comprised of Fox Kids leftovers for 6-11 year old boys that gobbled up 80% of the channel by 2008. I don't think anybody hated Jetix as a brand, as the majority of the programs it aired were actually not bad, rather they just hated what it did to Toon Disney. Honestly, this really should've been an ABC Family exclusive block."
