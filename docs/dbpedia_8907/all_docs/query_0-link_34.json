        "text": "Not to be confused with Buena Vista Productions.\n\nBackground\n\nBuena Vista International Television (now known as Disney Platform Distribution) was the international distribution arm of Walt Disney Television established in 1985 to produce non-American series and distribute all Disney-owned libraries around the world. In 2007, this division was renamed to \"Disney-ABC International Television\" after Disney retired the \"Buena Vista\" brand. It was renamed again in 2011 to \"Disney Media Distribution\", and later \"Disney Platform Distribution\" in 2020.\n\n1st Logo (September 7, 1987-1990)\n\nVisuals: On a blue background, there is a small yellow logo of the segmented Sleeping Beauty Castle (from the 1985 Walt Disney Pictures logo). Underneath it is the company name in the same fashion.\n\nTechnique: A still, digital graphic.\n\nAudio: The pings from the 1986 Walt Disney Television/Buena Vista Television logo, or the ending theme of the program.\n\nAvailability:\n\nSo far, this has been spotted on a Thames Television airing of Roger Rabbit & the Secrets of Toontown.\n\nIt was also seen on some 1980s international prints of Chip 'n' Dale Rescue Rangers and DuckTales, respectively.\n\nIt was also rumored to have been seen on some 1980s international prints of Adventures of the Gummi Bears, but it's unknown if this logo either is or isn't on these prints.\n\nPrior to 1987, international prints of programs just used the Walt Disney TV/Buena Vista Television combo instead.\n\n2nd Logo (1989-2007)\n\nVisuals: Same as the 1986 Walt Disney Television and Buena Vista Television logos, except it reads \"Distributed By Buena Vista International, Inc.\" underneath the castle.\n\nVariants:\n\nThe gradient background may be black/blue, black/indigo, or black/violet.\n\nThere is a copyright stamp sometimes seen under the logo.\n\n1989-1996 versions of this logo have the text slightly curved and in a slightly different font. The word \"by\" also isn't capitalized in this version.\n\nA 16:9 widescreen version exists.\n\nOn some Touchstone Television shows, the logo is still.\n\nTwo variants exist, in which the text is in a different font. Also, the word \"Inc.\" is gone in these variants. These versions were used in 1992 and 1996, respectively.\n\nAnother ultra-rare variant exists on Stick with Me, Kid. After a computer-generated turn-around that changes from the 1994 Buena Vista Productions logo to the BVI logo, also in bolder text, it animates as normal. Below the next part is a copyright notice for The Walt Disney Company.\n\nThe BVI text is also bold on Дисней Клуб (the Russian version of Disney Club), but the background is purple, both logos are animated and not divided into parts and the logos animate as normal.\n\nOn Kelab Disney Malaysia, the text on the bottom is just copyright info for the program, and changes three times:\n\nProduced in association with\n\nBuena Vista International Inc.\n\n© (Year) Buena Vista International, Inc.\n\n© (year) All Disney Elements\n\nThe Walt Disney Company\n\nOn early 2000 episodes of Saturday Disney Australia and episodes of Playhouse Disney Australia, the text once again is just copyright information, but is all placed within the bottom of the logo rather than each bit of the text being displayed separately. Beginning in 2005, the logo is also displayed in a 16:9 widescreen ratio in this case as well when both shows transitioned to the ratio.\n\nSome fifth-season episodes of Home Improvement have the logo zoomed in.\n\nOn the S5 HI episode \"Her Cheatin' Mind\", the logo cuts to black after a couple seconds.\n\nA brighter version also exists, which is seen on the sixth-season Home Improvement episode \"The Feminine Mistake\".\n\nTechnique: Computer effects.\n\nAudio: Normally, either none, the ending theme of the show, the same ascending pings as the Walt Disney Television logo at the time, and/or the 1985 or 1987 Walt Disney Television themes.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn some occasions, the Buena Vista Television and/or Touchstone Television logo themes are used.\n\nOn many episodes of Mummies Alive! airing in Europe, the 1996 music of the second Claster Television logo is used, due to a reverse plastering error.\n\nDisney+ prints of Smart Guy play the finishing of the warped 1987 Walt Disney Television music and, afterwards, silence.\n\nAvailability: Seen on a majority of Disney-owned material at the time, mostly international prints.; it can also generally be found on various Touchstone/Walt Disney Television series on DVD.\n\nIt is still seen on various Disney-owned programs and movies whenever aired on their overseas channels or affiliates.\n\nU.S. reruns of Disney library shows and films may also still have it, ie. Lifetime and Lifetime Movie Network airings of Circle of Deceit.\n\nIt can also be found at the end of some Region 1 DVD releases from Disney-owned labels, including The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again, Midnight Madness and What About Bob?, among others; TV show releases, such as the Ellen episode \"Two Mammograms and a Wedding\" on that show's season 3 DVD set, may also have it.\n\nRegion 2 PAL DVD releases also have this logo as well, but only often.\n\nThis was seen on original prints of all episodes of Marsupilami (even in the U.S.), and is also preserved on the videocassette releases.\n\nIt is also seen on home video prints of Frankenpooh; most The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh videocassettes of the era use either the standalone or still Walt Disney Television variant, the long 1997 Buena Vista Television logo, or no logo at all.\n\nHowever, this logo was seen on some episodes of said series on Disney Channel in the U.S. in the mid to late 90s (before the prints were updated with the 1986 Walt Disney Television \"Blue Castle\" logo).\n\nIt was also seen on various international non-American prints of DIC Entertainment shows produced during the time when Disney owned the studio, and even some that weren't (e.g. certain reruns of Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego? and Double Dragon).\n\nIt was also tacked onto a print of the Bump in the Night special \"'Twas the Night Before Bumpy\" on the 2004 UK DVD release \"Anchor Bay's Christmas Selection Box\".\n\nThe 1992 version is only known to appear on a small amount of international productions, such as The Grand Opening of Euro Disney.\n\nIt made an appearance on several Dead Man's Gun episodes on ThisTV (followed by the 2008 MGM Worldwide Television Distribution logo).\n\nIt's also retained on current prints of Clerks: The Animated Series (including a El Rey Network broadcast of episode 5, which was speedup with the ending theme playing over it due to time compression), before the short 2011 Miramax logo.\n\nIt also plasters the Touchstone Pictures logo at the start of a 1992 Finland broadcast of Cocktail.\n\nIt was also seen on one episode of Empty Nest when it aired on Laff.\n\nAfter 2000, appearances were mainly reduced to appearing on in-house Disney programs like The Disney Club in Russia and Malaysia and the Australian Playhouse Disney TV series that aired on the Seven Network.\n\nHowever, this logo continued to be used for fullscreen prints for some time, as it can be seen at the end of some older fullscreen prints of Cadet Kelly (2002), while others, mainly widescreen prints of the film, have the next logo; international fullscreen prints of the According to Jim episode \"Unruly Spirits\", at least two episodes of season 1 of Scrubs titled \"My Day Off\" and \"My Blind Date\", some early season 1 episodes of 8 Simple Rules (for Dating My Teenage Daughter), and a few early episodes of season 1 of Lost, also all use this logo; international widescreen prints of said shows have the 4th logo.\n\nIt is also preserved at the end of the Kino Lorber DVD release of Young Pioneers and international prints of Mickey Mouse Works.\n\nThe 1995 version (in 4:3) is seen on the following:\n\nAt the end of Can't Buy Me Love, following the closing Touchstone Pictures logo on the 2003 Australian DVD release of said film.\n\nOn the 2000 Scottish Gaelic dub of Caillou produced for BBC Alba (though this is a mistake made by the dubbing company as Disney had no distribution involvement with the series at all).\n\nOn the Italian dub of Caillou aired on Telebambi in Canada which airs programs in Italian.\n\nFollowing the 2006 Walt Disney Pictures logo at the end of post-2008 international prints of 101 Dalmatians (1961).\n\nThe 1995 version (in 16:9) is also preserved at the end of From Dusk to Dawn on the 2002 Australian DVD release of said film.\n\n3rd Logo (1989?-early 1990s?)\n\nVisuals: Same as the Buena Vista Productions logo used, but all the text apart from \"Buena Vista\" then fades away, with \"Distributed by\" fading on the top, and \"International, Inc.\" below in a gray font.\n\nTechnique: 2D animation.\n\nAudio: The ending theme of the special.\n\nAvailability: The only known use of this logo was on a Christmas episode of the French TV series Disney Parade called \"Disney Parade Spécial Noél\" (\"Disney Parade Christmas Special\"), which aired on TF1 on December 24, 1989. Might have been used on other episodes from this time period.\n\n4th Logo (2000-2007)\n\nVisuals: There is the finished 1985 Walt Disney Pictures logo (in the scheme of the 2000 Walt Disney Television logo), sans the text and the segmented circular line (which would later be drawn). Then the following text fades in below the castle:\n\nDistributed By\n\nBuena Vista International, Inc.\n\nAs it does, the circular line is drawn over the castle, but slower and differently.\n\nVariants:\n\nSometimes, the 2000 Walt Disney Television logo (or the 2003 Walt Disney Television Animation logo) would animate at first, then just after the circular line is drawn, it fades to this.\n\nOn some Touchstone Television shows, the logo is still.\n\nLike the previous logo, this logo would come in either the standard 4:3 version or the widescreen 16:9 version.\n\nA cropped (or stretched, in some cases) widescreen 16:9 version exists, which is used on most widescreen prints.\n\nAn open matte and true widescreen 16:9 version also exists.\n\nA 2.35:1 widescreen version also exists.\n\nTechnique: 2D animation.\n\nAudio: None (mainly on the standalone logo), the finishing of the Touchstone Television theme, the finishing of the 1987 Walt Disney Television theme, or the finishing of the end title theme of any show.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nThe full 1987 WDT theme was used on the standalone logo. This is sometimes considered a plaster job.\n\nOn early Channel 5 \"Milkshake\" UK airings of The Book of Pooh as well as international prints of episodes 1 and 2 of season 1 of Lost, the 1986 WDT/BVTV \"Rainbow Castle\" theme was used on the standalone logo. Overseas airings of the final season of The Golden Girls also played the 1986 WDT/BVTV \"Rainbow Castle\" theme on both the Touchstone logo and this one, due to a plastering error.\n\nOn a Disney Junior Canada airing of a Stanley episode, the logo had the music from the Cartoon Pizza and the 2001 Playhouse Disney Originals logo. This is due to a plastering error.\n\nOn an international airing of a That's So Raven episode, the logo had the music of the 2002 Disney Channel Originals logo. This is due to a bad plaster error.\n\nOn an early international airing of the That's So Raven episode, \"Driven To Insanity\", the logo had the music of the 2000 Disney Channel Originals logo (the episode was apart of season 1 that used the 2002 music). This is due to a plastering error.\n\nOn international fullscreen prints of a handful season 1 episodes of Kim Possible, the 1987 Walt Disney Television theme is out-of sync.\n\nOn BBC One UK airings of What About Bob? (1991), the closing theme ends over it, with the music fading out to silence when the logo fades out to black.\n\nOn the Disney+ print of The Book of Pooh episode \"The Words Are Out/Brain Drain\", the 2000 Playhouse Disney Originals theme is heard, due to a bad plastering error.\n\nOn an 2005 ABC Kids airing of Kim Possible, it used a generic theme.\n\nAvailability: As with the above, it is preserved on many international prints of any Disney, Touchstone, ABC, and Buena Vista Television shows and Disney-owned movies on cable networks like Showtime and SundanceTV.\n\nThis can also be seen on the second, fourth, and some seventh season episodes of The Golden Girls on the DVD sets and reruns of Smart Guy on Family Channel Canada (plastering the Walt Disney Television logo on some episodes).\n\nDisney Channel US airings of the Disney Channel Original Movie Pixel Perfect has this at the end.\n\nThis logo (with the WDTA logo) has also been spotted on a May 24, 2018 Disney XD USA airing of the Lilo & Stitch: The Series episode \"Phoon\", probably due to using an international print of the latter episode (a similar case also happened with the 2000 Walt Disney Television logo on the episode \"Topper\" on the aforementioned channel, also a result of using an international print of some sort).\n\nThis logo was also spotted on some episodes of My Wife & Kids on VH1 and other Paramount Global networks, whenever it airs.\n\nComedy Central UK (and 5Star) airings also have this at the end, on seasons 2-onward, as do Hulu's and Disney+'s prints.\n\nHowever, it does not appear on Fuse and Aspire airings of the show.\n\nIt is also seen at the end of Mimic 3: Sentinel (a Dimension Films production) on the Lionsgate Mimic Blu-Ray triple feature set (and the 2020 Paramount Pictures reprint of it), before the 2011 short/silent Miramax logo.\n\nThis is also retained on Crackle's print and even a Comet broadcast.\n\nIt is also rumored this is preserved on some Mill Creek and Kino Lorber Blu-ray releases of Touchstone/Hollywood Pictures titles.\n\nThis logo was also seen on a SundanceTV airing of the My So-Called Life episode \"Life of Brian\".\n\nThe short animated silent variant can be found at the end of the video release of The Book of Pooh: A Valentine for Eeyore, not from the main show itself, but instead on a Rolie Polie Olie episode that appeared after the program. It is seen after the end credits.\n\nIt was also seen on later international, non-American airings of DIC Entertainment-produced shows, being tacked onto Sonic Underground and Season 3 of The New Adventures of Madeline, respectively.\n\nIt was also seen on TV airings of Madeline: Lost in Paris, including an August 2002 Channel 5 airing.\n\nIt is also seen on the UK Prism Leisure DVD release of Inspector Gadget's Last Case, as well as the German DVD release of the same movie. It is possible that this may have also been seen on other Disney Channel/Toon Disney airings of the DIC Movie Toons as well.\n\nIt was also seen on Boomerang UK airings of the original Inspector Gadget after the DIC/Saban/Fox Kids logos.\n\nIt was also seen on some early acquisitions from Fox Kids Europe, where it was tacked onto most international airings of shows such as Gadget & the Gadgetinis, RoboRoach and the French dub of Sonic X, respectively.\n\nIt also makes an appearance at the end of the VR Troopers episode \"The Dojo Plot\" (following the 1996 Saban International/1999 Fox Kids logos) on the 2004 Maximum Entertainment UK DVD release of VR Troopers: Volume 2.\n\nFor unknown reasons, a lot of shows that aired on Fox Kids Brazil and Latin America also used this at the end, such as on Treehouse Direct Brazil prints of The Fairly OddParents (Paramount Global owns the series, but the series also aired on some international versions of Disney Channel, as Nelvana distributes the first 4 seasons and season 5 before \"Mooooving Day/Big Wanda\" outside the United States, a possible reason why this logo appeared) and airings of Braceface, another Nelvana-owned property.\n\nThis was also spotted at the end of a Bulgarian airing of the 2001 TV movie Three Days.\n\nThis is also seen at the end of the French-Canadian VHS release of Max Keeble's Big Move.\n\nIt can also be seen on the last two seasons of Alias on The Roku Channel, Fox Corporation's Tubi, as well as on Disney+'s prints of the said show overseas (although the first two seasons cut this and the Touchstone Television logo out before it).\n\nChannel 4 UK airings of the end of Coyote Ugly (2000) also have this logo, after the Jerry Bruckheimer Films and Touchstone Pictures logos.\n\nIt was also seen on a Disney+ print of the Dinosaurs episode \"Switched at Birth\".\n\nSky Cinema UK prints of Kill Bill: Volume 2 features the 2.35:1 widescreen version variant.\n\nIt could also have been seen on older international TV prints of 2:35:1 Disney/Miramax movies of the time-frame.\n\n5th Logo (2003-2007)\n\nVisuals: Similar to the last logo, there is the same castle, but in white, on a more lighter blue background. Below the castle, there is the text:\n\nBUENA VISTA\n\nINTERNATIONAL\n\nTELEVISION\n\nWith \"BUENA VISTA\" bigger than the rest of the text. Below that, there is a byline reading \"Servicing the Distribution of this Programme\". The spark flies over the castle a little slower.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!, the text is a little smaller and the castle is a little bigger (while the byline and text are also close together).\n\nA bylineless version exists.\n\nA version with the URL \"www.bvitv.com\" in spaced-out letters also exists.\n\nTechnique: 2D animation.\n\nAudio: None or the ending theme of the show.\n\nAudio Variant: On the Japanese dub of W.I.T.C.H., the ascending pings from the 1986 Walt Disney Television/Buena Vista Television \"Rainbow Castle\" logo are used. This is an oddity, considering other dubs of the show just have the logo in silence.\n\nAvailability: Only seen on syndicated content from ABC Family Worldwide and Jetix Europe, including ex-Saban programs, SIP Animation shows, Fox Kids/Jetix co-productions, ex-TVS Television programs, as well as then-newer Fox Kids/Jetix shows.\n\nOn Fox Kids Europe/Jetix Europe acquired programs, you are most likely able to find this logo on most DVD releases and free-TV airings.\n\nSeen on SIP Animation-produced shows such as second season of What's with Andy?, The Tofus, and the first seasons of both W.I.T.C.H. and A.T.O.M. - Alpha Teens on Machines (however, most TV and DVD releases of both shows do not have this logo at all).\n\nTutenstein sometimes used this logo, alongside Sonic X (although not every DVD release will have it).\n\nThis was also seen on Power Rangers episodes from this time-period, appearing on Dino Thunder, S.P.D. and Mystic Force, even in the U.S. (however, DVD releases have no logo at the end, and Netflix prints plaster it with the 2011 Saban Brands logo).\n\nSome DVD releases of RoboRoach and Gadget & the Gadgetinis replace the previous logo with this logo.\n\nIt was also spotted on a Guatemalan airing of Jason and the Heroes of Mount Olympus, plastering the 1996 Saban International and 1999 Fox Kids logos.\n\nThe 16:9 version is only seen on Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go! (this is also retained on Disney+'s prints, although cropped in 4:3).\n\nIt is also preserved on the U.S. complete DVD boxset of the 1967-1970 Spider-Man series.\n\nThis was also seen on mid-2000's airings of Ruth Rendell Mysteries on ITV3 in the UK, and possibly other Television South programs.\n\nA 2017 True Movies UK airing of A Christmas Reunion (1994) also had this as well at the end.\n\nThe bylineless version so far has only been sighted on a Bulgarian airing of Chocolat before the 2011 Miramax Films closing logo.\n\nThe website version can be found in the files for the companies' website.\n\n6th Logo (2006-2007)\n\nVisuals: On a slate blue/purple water-like background, there is a 2D Disney castle turning from right to center while white lights shine upon the logo. Turning with the castle is the text in the same alignment as the previous logo and a Disney copyright stamp underneath. Above the castle, there is \"Distributed by\" (or \"Servicing distribution of this programme\" on Jetix Europe shows) in the Arial font.\n\nVariants:\n\nLike the previous two logos, this can be seen in either 4:3 or 16:9.\n\nA 2.35:1 version exists on TV airings and international prints of films shot in that ratio.\n\nOn Papa na vse ruki, the Russian adaptation of Home Improvement, the logo's screen size is smaller and is also rapidly sped-up.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: A drum roll, followed by two synth notes (the second held for longer), ending with a string sounder. Otherwise, either the finishing of the 1987 Walt Disney Television theme or the ending theme of the show plays over it, or none.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nInternational airings of one episode of Dirt used the music from the 9th FX Networks logo due to a reverse plaster error.\n\nOn current prints of the TV movie Model Behavior, the short Walt Disney Television music is heard due to plastering the 1986 WDT and 1995 WDT/BVI logos.\n\nA season 2 episode of Brandy & Mr. Whiskers uses the full Walt Disney Television music due to plastering the Walt Disney Television Animation logo.\n\nOn an international print of an unknown episode of Hannah Montana, the logo has the short 2002 Disney Channel Originals theme, due to bad plastering.\n\nOn the Japanese dub of W.I.T.C.H., the ascending pings from the 1986 Walt Disney Television/Buena Vista Television \"Rainbow Castle\" logo are once again used.\n\nOn the Disney+ streaming print of the 1996 animated series of The Incredible Hulk episode \"Raw Power\", the last half of the Silver Surfer theme from the 1998 animated series thereof is heard over the \"Servicing the Distribution\" of this logo.\n\nAvailability: Seen on international airings of Disney, ABC, Touchstone TV series and movies, though some international channels may not have this at the end.\n\nIt is also seen on some international shows such as Polish airings of The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and Polish airings of older Disney cartoons which plastered both the 2nd and 4th logos.\n\nSeason 1 episodes of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and My Friends Tigger & Pooh also have this at the end, plastering the Playhouse Disney Originals logo.\n\nIt also plasters the Disney Channel Originals logo on international prints of WDTA-produced shows at the time, such as season 1 episodes of The Replacements (including U.S. prints on Disney+) and the final season of Kim Possible, among others.\n\nThis logo also plastered the Touchstone Pictures and Amblin Entertainment logos on a Christmas Eve airing of Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) on BBC Two a few years back.\n\nIt is rumored that this logo is preserved on a few Mill Creek and Kino-Lorber Blu-ray releases of Touchstone/Hollywood Pictures titles.\n\nIt is also preserved on the Kino-Lorber Blu-ray release of The Good Mother (1988), following the 1985 Touchstone Pictures logo.\n\nA few Region 1 Buena Vista Home Entertainment DVD releases of Touchstone Television series also have this logo.\n\nIt can also be seen at the end of HBO and Cinemax airings of Mr. Destiny (1990).\n\nIt was also seen at the end of a Charge! airing of Infernal Affairs before the 2011 Miramax Films closing logo.\n\nIt was also seen at the end of Paramount Network France and Sony Movies UK airings of Seabiscuit.\n\nIt was also seen on Disney Junior USA airings of some Season 1 episodes of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse following the Disney Junior logo.\n\nThis logo is also seen at the end of the 2006 Disney Movie Club exclusive VHS release of The Wild, which was released in North America.\n\nThe \"Servicing the Distribution\" variant of this logo once again is preserved on Jetix Europe associated programming, including Season 1 of Yin Yang Yo!, season 2 of both W.I.T.C.H. and A.T.O.M. - Alpha Teens on Machines, Power Rangers Operation Overdrive, and season 1 of Pucca, the latter of which also retains the logo on some official YouTube prints of the series and on Tubi.\n\nIt is unknown if other shows from this time period, like Oban-Star Racers, used this logo.\n\nIt was also seen at the end of a UK True Movies airing of the TV movie The Girl Who Came Between Them (1990).\n\nThis logo is also seen at the end of a Tubi streaming print of The Adventures of Huck Finn (1993), following the 1990 variant of the 1985 Walt Disney Pictures logo.\n\nThis logo is also seen at the end of Disney+ prints of Commander in Chief, following the 2004 Touchstone Television logo with the final part of the 1989 Steven Bochco Productions theme.\n\nThis logo was also seen at the end of a Movie Greats airing of the 1989 TV movie Jake Spanner, Private Eye.\n\nThe \"Servicing the Distribution\" of this logo was also seen at the end of a Movie Greats airing of the 1978 TV movie Nowhere to Run.\n\nThe \"Servicing the Distribution\" of this logo also plasters the 1996 Saban International logo on the Disney+ streaming prints of 1996 animated series of The Incredible Hulk episodes \"Return of the Beast\", \"Raw Power\", and \"Hulk of a Different Color\".\n\n7th Logo (2006-2008)\n\nVisuals: Over a white background, the text \"Una producción de\" fades in, then the logo in light-blue fades in, and then a copyright notice fades in below the logo.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn the Brazilian adaptation of Desperate Housewives, \"Uma produção de\" fades in on top of the logo instead of \"Una producción de\". Also, the copyright notice is kept in Spanish.\n\nSometimes, \"Una producción de\" is in a different font.\n\nTechnique: 2D animation.\n\nAudio: The ending theme of the show."
