        "text": "I have changed the goal of this campaign, to get a VAULT DISNEY or DISNEY FAMILY CHANNEL on television.\n\nPlease, I urge every one of you to sign the petition.\n\nWe \"can\" get the Disney magic and guiding principles back on television!\n\nDaniel\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/\n\npreservethemagic\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/bringback_tds\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/disneylands_50th\n\nI completely agree, I would love to watch Ducktales again instead of the original programming on now....however they have a show on at 2 and 2:30pm (i work nights ) called the House of Mouse that actually features mickey, donald, goofy with tons of other disney characters in attendance at the 'house' and shows cartoons with them in it. sometimes they even have vintage cartoons from way back in the day. alot of times they will make references to disney movies or places. its probably the best show on that channel.\n\nYou might also be interested in the Disney Progressives (http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/thedisneyprogressives)\n\nThanks for the suggestion!\n\nA lot of people in the past have complained about and criticized what I & other fans do. But, what we are doing is fighting for what's right: values and principles. What I do not believe in is refusing to fight against something that you know deep in your heart is wrong.\n\nJust adding my two cents again, hoping that someone will see that the classic Disney stuff is still good.\n\nI work with a lot of teenagers, and they all used to think \"WDW Inside Out\" and things like it were cool. It made them want to go to WDW.\n\nAnd the old Disney movies and shows were something that the whole family could connect with.\n\nI am not saying to get rid of the more current stuff. But repeating it 24-7 only makes people get tired of it sooner. [Didn't Disney learn anything from \"Millionnaire\" on ABC?]\n\nBTW, I also think that Wonderful World on ABC needs a host. It is now just done as a tagline that makes no effort to make that show matter. Walt's intros to the old shows (or even just the voice-overs done by others after his death) were more interesting and drew loyalty.\n\nThank u !! I was just about to write a thread about this....i used to love watchin TDC because they actually had shows about the Disney theme parks and had stuff to do with disney...i wish at least they would bring back like Disney Inside Out or something.\n\nWell thanx again."
