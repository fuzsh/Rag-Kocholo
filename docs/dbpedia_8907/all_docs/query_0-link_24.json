        "text": "#10: “The Proud Family” (2001-05)\n\nDisney Channel started their original animation slate out strong with this exaggerated slice of life series about a Black suburban family. While most episodes told the day-to-day life of 14-year-old Penny Proud dealing with everything from spelling bees to internet piracy, the series would occasionally get creative to teach its viewers about Black culture and history. “I Had a Dream” puts a time travel spin on Black History Month, sending its protagonist back to the days of segregation, while “Seven Days of Kwanzaa” saw the Prouds visited by a homeless family who taught them about the importance of the title holiday. Though imperfect in its execution, the show has also been praised for its positive post-9/11 portrayal of Muslims in “Culture Shock.”\n\n#9: “Recess” (1997-2001)\n\nWith the ring of a bell, the kids of Third Street Elementary were freed from the confines of their stuffy classrooms and unleashed into a society of their own making known as “Recess.” Although The Ashleys and Erwin sometimes stood in the way of their fun, the fourth grade protagonists often used this temporary freedom to carve out their own identities and better understand themselves and the world around them. Ironically though, the show’s most progressive scenes typically happened inside the schoolhouse. In class, Miss Grotke taught her students the truth about Thanksgiving, and urged them to question the biases of the white men who dominated history books. If only everyone could get such an honest education!\n\n#8: “Kim Possible” (2002-07)\n\nIf you were a girl who loved action-packed shows with feminine flair, the 2000’s were a great time to grow up. Shows like “The Powerpuff Girls,” “Totally Spies!,” and “Winx Club” showed that girls could save the day just as well as the boys could. Of course, our favorite of the bunch was always “Kim Possible.” Like its contemporaries, “Kim Possible”s protagonist wasn’t afraid to be both feminine and strong, often juggling her roles as a cheerleader and a crime fighter. What set the show apart was its overarching plots, will they-won’t they romance, and occasionally feature-length adventures. It was a children’s show, but it took its characters and its audience seriously - and was all the better for it!\n\n#7: “The Magic School Bus” (1994-97)\n\nWhether the class was “surfing on a sound wave” or “swinging through the stars,” audiences knew they were always down for a unique adventure with Ms. Frizzle. Voiced by actress and comedian Lily Tomlin, The Friz’s field trips were as thrilling as they were educational, teaching her students (and the kids at home) about the exciting world of science. Although the scenarios in the show were often fantastical, all of the science showcased was entirely fact-based, fostering a love for the subject in its young audience. Its woman-led cast was an added bonus, subtly encouraging young girls to pursue typically male-dominated STEM fields of study and occupations.\n\n#6: “Arthur” (1996-2022)\n\nUnderstanding the people you share the Earth with is just as important as understanding the Earth itself - a fact which “Arthur'' took to heart. Having aired for twenty-five seasons, the series is the longest-running children’s animated series in US history, and it continued to break boundaries throughout that over two decade long run on PBS. It raised awareness for diseases such as diabetes, asthma, and cancer, and helped kids and parents alike better understand how to accommodate those with autism and dyslexia. As early as 2005, the show’s spin-off “Postcards from Buster” even showcased two real life lesbian parents. The episode was unfortunately banned in most US states, but that didn’t stop “Arthur” from featuring a groundbreaking gay wedding in its twenty-second season.\n\n#5: “Captain Planet and the Planeteers” (1990-96)\n\nThis unique superhero show has a legacy that far outran its time on air. “Captain Planet and the Planeteers” taught kids how to care for their environment and encouraged them to get others to do the same. And its activism didn’t end at telling kids to pick up litter and use paper instead of plastic. The show discussed the negative effects of everything from deforestation and poaching to radiation and air pollution. In real life, the show promoted eco-friendly toys, and set up a charity foundation that continues to inspire kids to come up with solutions to environmental problems to this day.\n\n#4: “Braceface” (2001-04)\n\nSharon Spitz’s mega-embarrassing electromagnetic braces served as the quirky draw to “Braceface,” but underneath that over-the-top premise was a kindhearted show about being a teen girl in the 2000’s. Topics like menstruation and divorce were dealt with in ways that simultaneously entertained and comforted the show’s young audience members, while recurring character Dion acted as an early example of gay representation on kid’s TV. For the 2000’s, the show was surprisingly progressive in a way that was always easy to digest and relate to. And it didn’t hurt that the lead role was performed by “Clueless”s Alicia Silverstone!\n\n#3: “Adventure Time” (2010-18)\n\n2010 was the start of a new era for Cartoon Network, one that would become most prominently associated with “Adventure Time.” The surreal fantasy series followed human boy Finn and his dog friend, Jake, on a series of largely episodic adventures, which slowly began to reveal more about the show’s world and eclectic cast of characters. From the very beginning of its run, it challenged traditional ideas of gender and sexuality, particularly through the character of Princess Bubblegum, who studied science and had a relationship with Marceline the Vampire Queen. Even Finn kissing a frog prince was treated as a norm in The Land of Ooo, teaching “Adventure Time”s young audience to embrace those that did not fit within societal norms.\n\n#2: “Reading Rainbow” (1983-2006)\n\nIf you grew up in the 80’s, 90’s, or 2000’s, you probably watched “Reading Rainbow” at least once. Hosted by LeVar Burton, the series strove to foster a love of reading in children across America. A typical episode usually featured a celebrity guest, who would read from a children’s picture book as simplistic animations of its illustrations brought its story to life on-screen. In order to help kids better analyze and understand the literature they were reading, the show then featured tie-in segments to the episode’s focal book, exploring real life locations and stories that related to its themes. It made a big impact on us, and plenty of other kids across the nation, winning over 200 awards in its twenty-three years on air.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\n“Bill Nye the Science Guy” (1993-99)\n\nThis Show Made Science Fun & Had a Catchy Theme Song to Boot!\n\n“Steven Universe” (2013-19)\n\nA Major Step Forward in LGBTQIA+ Representation in Children's Animation\n\n“Hey Arnold!” (1996-2004)\n\nStories About Classism, Ageism, & Even Immigration Made Us Kinder People\n\n“Clarissa Explains It All” (1991-94)\n\nNickelodeon's First Female-Fronted Series Smashed Stereotypes About Teen Girls\n\n“Pepper Ann” (1997-2000)\n\nTaught Us About Cultural Appropriation, Striking, & Androgyny\n\n#1: “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” (1968-2001)\n\nOf all the shows that have felt ahead of their time, few have felt quite as revolutionary as “Mister Rogers Neighborhood.” At a time when children’s television was more about selling toys than education or even entertainment, Fred Rogers devised a series that focused on soft-spoken kindness and conflict resolution. Beginning its run in the midst of integration, “Mister Rogers” existed at the same time as some pretty violent racist ideology. Its host challenged those ideas on-screen by having pleasant conversations with co-star François Clemmons as the pair soaked their feet in a pool together. Seemingly small, but still significant, gestures such as this made up the heart of “Mister Rogers” and changed the way we viewed kids TV forever."
