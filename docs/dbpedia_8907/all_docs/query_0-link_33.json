        "text": "So, I spent the weekend ploughing through all of Recess on Disney+. The show holds up and is still as charming as ever. After the series wrapped I went looking for the movies.\n\nThe first one \"Recess: School's Out\" was fine, a by the numbers kind of movie that felt like it had the same energy as the show but didn't quite hit the spot. The next offering \"Taking the Fifth Grade\" a clumsy anthology style film, meandered through some utterly forgettable shorts and felt very shallow. Also the TJ replacement voice was totally off.\n\nAfter that there was this \"All Growed Down\" Kindergarten film which I haven't watched yet and have very little interest in but then I found something weird. After that and the final Recess related content is a Crossover episode with Lilo & Stitch. This gave me pause.\n\nI recalled there being a Kim Possible crossover with Lilo & Stitch back in the day and did some digging. The Proud Family and Jake Long: American Dragon all crossed over too. This makes Lilo & Stitch the nexus point for a Disney animated Universe. Not only that but Lilo & Stitch also crossed over with Stitch!, the anime based on the character that is in continuity with the show and set decades later with Lilo cameoing with her daughter (who looks just like her).\n\nWe are through the looking glass here, people.\n\nI posit that the aliens that abduct and return Little Jimmy Cratner are the same galactic police that exist in the continuity of Lilo & Stitch. Discuss.\n\nI'm very tired.\n\nThat theme song was fire.\n\nI was always kind of bummed that the show didn't capture the same spirit that the theme song promised us.\n\nIt still was a great show from the saturday mornings of my childhood though.\n\nI remember really enjoying pretty much all the ABC \"One Saturday Morning\" block stuff and loved the framing device and short host segments.\n\nSome of my best memories of the block were the FCC mandated \"educational television\" bits like Manny the Uncanny and the Genie from Aladin teaching you about historical figures and inventors.\n\nI still think about \"Great minds think alike? no! great minds think for themselves!\"\n\nI was always kind of bummed that the show didn't capture the same spirit that the theme song promised us.\n\nIt still was a great show from the saturday mornings of my childhood though.\n\nI remember really enjoying pretty much all the ABC \"One Saturday Morning\" block stuff and loved the framing device and short host segments.\n\nSome of my best memories of the block were the FCC mandated \"educational television\" bits like Manny the Uncanny and the Genie from Aladin teaching you about historical figures and inventors.\n\nI still think about \"Great minds think alike? no! great minds think for themselves!\"\n\nWas this around the same time as Superfudge and Bump in the Night?\n\nAFTER THESE MESSAGES, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK."
