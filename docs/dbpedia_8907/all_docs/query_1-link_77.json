While Sharon was sitting in the dentist chair, a fluke electrically charged her braces.

She's competitive, aggressive and loves to participate in extreme sports.\n\nConnor MacKenzie - Connor is Sharon's other best friend. He's a science whiz and is known as \"the walking sneeze\" cuz he's allergic to almost everything!\n\nAlden Jones - Alden is the coolest guy in school.

He thinks he's a ladies man, but the girls definitely don't think so!\n\nNina Harper - Nina is the most popular girl in school. She and Sharon used to be best friends in junior high, but now they're enemies. Nina even gave Sharon the nickname, Braceface!\n\nBraceface - Fun Facts\n\nAlicia Silverstone is the voice of Sharon Spitz and sings the theme song for Braceface.\n\nAlicia Silverstone is also the executive producer of the show.\n\nAlicia Silverstone became a vegan after watching documentaries on slaughterhouses.
