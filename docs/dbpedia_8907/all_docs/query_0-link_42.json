        "text": "Ah, the pains of adolescence. Sometimes the only cure any of us could think of for such a hellish time was watching TV. Thankfully, there were actually a lot of Disney Channel shows that were feminist enough to make some differences in our lives — mostly by improving our perspectives on the world. These were '90s and '00s Disney Channel shows that went above and beyond expectations, giving us inspiring female characters and storylines that we could really relate to.\n\nAs young women, seeing the feminist characters on Disney Channel shows being smart, ambitious, and forthright while experiencing many of the same issues that we were was an absolute revelation. Not only did these portrayals make us feel valued and understood, but they also served up some rare female role models at an age when we were desperately searching for them. That's the way it was for me, and I'm sure it was the same for many women as well.\n\nWhile much of the feminism of these shows might be incredibly subtle or hardly groundbreaking, some of them were blatant in their agenda of inspiring young women and educating audiences on feminist principles and ideas. Even now, my mind is kind of blown away by some of them."
