Been a huge fan of the show ever since it started on ABC Family (Fox Family? Either way.) Anyone in Canada is freakin LUCKY to be able to see all the way up to ep 78! I'm so jealous! If there's any way to get a copy of eps 'For the Birds' and on (VHS, DVD, computer, format doesn't matter), I'd seriously pay like $100 for it! *sigh* I wish a copy exsisted...\n\nSo there's the little rumor going around everyone's probably already heard: in late 2005 another season of 22 eps will start airing in Canada and that will bring the grand total to 100 eps. And then in 2007 a Braceface movie is supposed to come out. It'd be SOO great if this was true! Who knows, we'll see. And even though here in the US we can't see them, it'd still be great to know that more eps were being made.\n\nThe Disney channel needs to stop taunting us! I Hope they bring some actual new episodes soon!!\n\nGlad to be here, and glad this BF community exists! Thanks guys! =)"
