        "text": "This blog is still alive! Joy!\n\nAnother anniversary of a favorite cartoon falls on Throwback Thursday today! This time, it’s 15-year-old Braceface, my biggest Nelvana obsession since Wayside! Although I caught some interest in this show back in summer 2013, it wasn’t until February 2014 when I became a true fan, obsessively watching every episode on demand.\n\nFor those who forgot what Braceface was, it was a show set in Canada about a 13-14-year-old girl named Sharon Spitz who gets a pair of braces that make her budding adolescence even more frustrating than it already was. However, I must admit that, by the time the gang went up to high school, Sharon’s braces became less of a focal point in the stories.\n\nCall this show a mediocre waste of paper if you want, but I honestly find it to be one of the greatest and most underrated Canadian cartoons of all time. Alongside another Teletoon classic, What About Mimi?, it’s essentially the As Told by Ginger of Canada (albeit less ugly). In fact, I revealed on my “Ginger Snaps” blog a year ago that Braceface was the show that inspired me to give Ginger a try. And I ended up loving that show even more! At one point, I was so obsessed with Ginger that it felt like committing adultery if I looked at Braceface again. Silly me!\n\nHowever, I am jealous of Braceface retaining its spot on Amazon, while the ugly one got the boot.\n\nBut let me tell what Braceface did that not even As Told by Ginger dared to look into: one episode talked about the dangers of adult sites! Holy frig! Canada sure has some loose censorship, doesn’t it? Also, I was amazed that this kids’ cartoon was able to portray confirmed homosexuality in a respectable manner. I’m referring to the season three episode where Sharon tries to play matchmaker for her gay fashion designer friend Dion. I’m not kidding! That is awesome! And we’ve yet to see the day where Courtney Gripling comes out of the closet!\n\nOh, and another episode had Sharon become a victim of underaged intoxication! Holy crap!\n\nThen, there is an episode where Sharon’s grandfather comes over, and acts like a G-rated version of Hank’s dad from King of the Hill. In other words, he was acting like a racist! Don’t you just love when cartoons aimed at kids and young teens have more maturity when it comes to dealing with controversial topics than certain adult cartoons out there?!\n\nSo in conclusion, Braceface is a well-done slice-of-life cartoon for teenagers that rivals As Told by Ginger with its balls to push the boundaries of presenting relatable storylines in such a down-to-earth way. I’ve yet to write a full post on “Ginger Snaps” comparing these two great shows.\n\nI don’t care if she has braces on; Sharon is so beautiful… even if she can be an annoying, egotistical, rebellious, stubborn, mouthy, whiny brat a lot of times.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nAnother Disney-related anniversary is today! This year marks the 15th anniversaries of three of my favorite Disney animated TV shows, House of Mouse, Lloyd in Space, and The Proud Family. Obviously, it’s Lloyd’s birthday today (Feb. 3), so let’s talk about him! Note that while all of these cartoons don’t share the popularity as DuckTales, or Phineas and Ferb, Lloyd is the least popular of the three.\n\nUnsurprisingly, you might not even know what the hell is Lloyd in Space. Yeah, this show is like the Pelswick of Disney Television Animation. It was ignored, and many of those who DID remembered it either thought it was either average at best, or unfavorably similar to Doug, with only a minority of people who thought it was brilliant.\n\nCreated by Paul Germain and Joe Ansolabehere, the duo responsible for the way more popular Disney’s One Saturday Morning show Recess, Lloyd in Space is all about the futuristic life of an alien boy in the eighth grade named Lloyd Nebulon, who lives in a massive space station somewhere in the galaxy. His family consists of his mother and commander of the station, Norah; his horrifically manipulative little sister Francine, who has freaky telekinetic powers that rival those of Matilda; and his Grandpa Leo, voiced by the Flying Dutchman himself, Brian Doyle-Murray. Lloyd spends much of his time with his diverse trio of buddies, including lone human Eddie, lovable blob Patrick—I mean Kurt, and the literal brains of the gang, Douglas, whose glasses are his eyes (a la Duckman). Lloyd’s adventures (or misadventures) mostly center around his newly-budded adolescence, and his encounters with the ups and downs of growing up. It’s been the focus since the very first episode, “The Big 1-3”, where Lloyd officially becomes a teenager at 13, but takes his new “maturity” too far.\n\nYeah, the premise of the show is really average, and because its premise is so basic and overdone, people overlook the true highlight of the show: the execution of everything. I have no idea why I would often ignore Futurama (though I recently started to like it more), because on Lloyd in Space, its creativity on the futuristic space environment, the behaviours and abilities that some of the characters reveal to have, designs on the characters, and the amazingly weird concepts Lloyd’s world offers appeared to be done with almost the same amount of ingeniousness. However, because sci-fi isn’t a genre I indulge into often, I won’t go as far as to say that all the impressive things Lloyd in Space does are revolutionary (at least not for sci-fi cartoons specifically), but it’s definitely delightful. One example of how creative this show can be is a memorable episode where Lloyd starts to go through puberty, sexually and mentally speaking. Whenever he thinks about girls, not only does his antenna glows (because Disney isn’t sick enough to allow a more obvious equivalent to an erection), but his masculine alter-ego from his little fantasies zaps out from his antenna as a hologram if Lloyd’s hormones don’t control themselves. Ha! That puts the pituitary gland to shame! No offense to the As Told by Ginger episode “Dare I, Darren?”, though. Then, there was a wonderful episode about this nerdy new student named Larvel, who goes through a caterpillar/butterfly-like metamorphosis from a puny kid, to a popular buff teen, to an independent man…IN THE DURATION OF A FEW WEEKS! Those two examples should be enough for you to see how cool this show is.\n\nBut there’s more! The voice cast is a very acceptable selection; it’s a noticeable mix of actors and actresses from Recess, including Courtland Mead (Gus) as Lloyd, April Winchell (Ms. Finster) as Norah, and Anndi McAfee (Ashley A.) as the Alpha B!%@# Brittany. We also got Justin Shenkarow (Harold Berman), Bill Fagerbakke (Patrick Star), Pamela Hayden (Milhouse Van Houten), Tress MacNeille (Agnes Skinner), Dan Castellaneta (Homer Simpson), Eddie Deezen (Mandark), Brian Doyle-Murray (The Flying Dutchman), Diedrich Bader (Kenny from Baby Blues) and Brian George (I don’t know him for any other roles) are all fun to listen to as their respective roles. My favorite of the main characters is Station, who’s the kind British butler-like computer serving all around Lloyd’s apartment-building-like space home. Of the supporting cast, I’ve always loved Lloyd’s crabby ol’ robot teacher, Mrs. Bolt, who’s basically Agnes Skinner from The Simpsons in a robot’s cold, rusty body.\n\nSo, to wrap up this birthday wish, I am so disappointed with how underrated Lloyd in Space is, even more so than another great One Saturday Morning show, Teacher’s Pet. At least the latter won four Emmys, and (somehow) got a theatrical movie. Oh, speaking of which, happy 60th birthday, Nathan Lane (voice of Spot/Scott Leadready II)! Back on topic, Lloyd in Space got nothing beyond its 39 episodes, plus one alleged “lost” episode, “Picture Perfect”, which never got aired in the Western part of the world. This was a show that I was obsessed with when it aired every weekday afternoon on Family Channel in 2006, back when they still cared about animation. In fact, I used to consider it to be my #1 favorite Disney animated series, years before Gravity Falls came into my life. Now, it’s at #3, after House of Mouse, and Gravity Falls. Either way, Lloyd in Space shall remain my #1 favorite underrated Disney cartoon for another several years.\n\nSo, while you One Saturday Morning fans continue to reminisce Recess, I’m going to take advantage of my nostalgia for its brother of the future."
