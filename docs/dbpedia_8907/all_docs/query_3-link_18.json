        "text": "Sharon Esther Spitz is the main character of the Braceface TV series. She was originally voiced by Alicia Silverstone, until season 3 when she was succeeded by Stacey DePass.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nSharon is a beautiful teenage girl with fair skin, long blonde hair with a pastel blue hairclip, green eyes, and silver braces.\n\nMainly, Sharon is seen wearing a pastel blue crop top with white lines Shows Her Bellybutton and navy denim jeans. In occasions, she wears navy denim jeans and a bright pink shirt with emerald necklace and sometimes a navy denim jacket.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nSharon is a sweet, girly, happy-go-lucky, passionate, clumsy, ditzy, honest, and responsible teenage girl.\n\nAs with most teenage girls who are in middle school and transitioning their way into high school, Sharon wants to be able to fit herself somewhere within the crowd. Despite wanting such, she greatly values her circle of friends and would do anything for them.\n\nThough there are some moments where Sharon may take things too far or get a little ahead of herself, she learns from her lessons in the end and makes sure that she doesn't let it happen again.\n\nWhen having to deal with Nina and her bullying antics throughout the series, Sharon always keeps her head high and doesn't allow her words or actions get the best of her.\n\nFamily and ethnicity[]\n\nAs the middle child in her family, along with five pets (two dogs and three cats), whose names are: Pigger, Sampson, Moishe, Roxie, and Lawrence, Sharon's family members include: her father Richard Spitz, her mother Helen Spitz, and her two brothers, Adam Spitz and Josh Spitz.\n\nIn Angels Among Us, it's revealed that Sharon and her brothers have Jewish ancestry through their father's side of the family.\n\nBio[]\n\nAt the start of the series, Sharon is introduced as a vegetarian and animal rights activist. Her dream is to become a veterinarian and she is very serious about wanting to excel within this profession, hence her volunteer work at a local animal hospital.\n\nAs with most girls who have just reached their teenage age, and are starting out in middle school, the things that Sharon wants are to be popular, get good grades, hang out with friends, and have a boyfriend.\n\nFor some reason, Sharon tends to find herself getting into some kind of trouble and messing up like every other typical teenager, but she always learns from her mistakes and sets things right in the end, no matter what of the situation.\n\nDespite her cuteness and beauty, Sharon is also known to be a clumsy and ditzy girl who'd usually end up embarrassing herself one way or the next. She isn't considered as an \"unpopular\" girl by social standards, her only hurdle in that is the simple fact she's unable to command the attention of her peers in the way of Nina and other girls do.\n\nSharon's rival in the TV show is Nina Harper, an old childhood friend who transitioned into a bully (due to an incident caused by the latter's cousin *cited down below*), as well as a student who attend Sharon's middle school and high school.\n\nAs mentioned above, Sharon and Nina used to be close friends as kids growing up, but when Nina found her beloved dolls decapitated, Nina immediately blamed Sharon for the act, despite the latter claiming to do no such thing. However, in the episode (\"Clean Slate\"), it is then revealed that Nina's cousin, Petra, was the true culprit of the doll massacre and not Sharon. But because of that incident since, Nina has done everything to make Sharon's life miserable as much as possible.\n\nSharon's best friend is Maria Wong, and her other friends are Connor MacKenzie, Alden Jones (crush, later boyfriend), Brock Leighton, Mark \"Dion\" Jones, Marlo, and later on, Alyson Malitski (Nina's former best friend). As mentioned above, Sharon is considered as the middle child in her family.\n\nHer favorite singers are Leena and Taylor Knight, both of whom she met in person.[1][2] She was an extra in Leena's new music video, and she said she had a lot in common with her, and she also learned from Leena that being a big star is not easy as people think.\n\nTaylor Knight was nothing at all who Sharon thought he was, and he ended up being a guy who was so full of himself to where he never seemed to really care about her. He was so arrogant that Sharon was glad when he canceled their date to her prom, as seen in the episode (\"A Knight to Remember\").\n\nIn spite of the upsetting breakup, and that the wounds of the breakup eventually healed over time, they maintained a strong, platonic relationship as friends. But by the end of the final episode (\"Leap of Faith\"), Alden came to realize that he still had strong feelings for Sharon and he wanted to make sure he's able to rebuild their relationship, stating that it was his mistake to end it[3]. Once he started putting in the effort of making his feelings known to Sharon, he soon gathered all of his courage and finally told her exactly how he felt.\n\nDespite Sharon's hesitance at first, especially since she didn't want to risk ruining their good friendship, she eventually accepted, and they got back together.\n\nRelationship[]\n\nAt the start, Sharon harbored a huge, romantic crush on Alden early on in junior high, often finding herself struggling to form a strong and close, romantic relationship with him, even though he secretly returned her strong, romantic feelings and obsessions. Later on, they finally become an official, romantic couple when Alden ended up asking her out in the first episode. The two had a good relationship for about one year. However, early on in freshman year, Sharon grew insecure because she believed that Alden was uninterested in her. This insecurity ended up causing her to screw up their relationship, and Alden finally broke up with her as shown in one episode: \"Dear Alden\".\n\nPhysical Abilities[]\n\nDespite her klutzy nature and not being as into sports as others, particularly Maria (who has called Sharon a \"sports wimp\" in many episodes), Sharon's been shown to be quite capable of handling very demanding, physical exertions.\n\nAlden calls Sharon \"the best dancer he knows,\" considering her to be a better dancer than Maria.\n\nStrength[]\n\nWhile sparring with Maria during a kickboxing class, she exerts significant physical force in both punching and kicking.[4].\n\nHer strongest blow lifts a large boxing bag clean off its support, tearing it in half with one punch.\n\nWhen Tess and Liane had smashed in the door to Sharon's Locker, jamming it closed, she opened it by pulling the door open with her hands.[5]\n\nAgility[]\n\nWhile learning to rollerblade, she accidentally slipped into a full 180-degree split[6].\n\nFor a normal person, this would be a crippling, painful injury, as it takes years of practice to build the required flexibility to do this move safely.\n\nSharon's only reaction is to shift into a sitting position, which would be impossible for an average person, given that adopting this position immobilizes the hip joints due to the physical stress of being pushed beyond their limits.\n\nSharon has high manual dexterity, able to perform complex object manipulation with no previous practice.\n\nReflexes[]\n\nSharon can react quite quickly to sudden events, as shown when she grabbed falling boxes accidentally dropped by Dion before they could hit the floor.[7]\n\nIntellectual Specialties[]\n\nSharon is quite an accomplished student in both English and creative writing. Adam even says it is easy for her to win English assignment awards[8] and their mother, Helen, says that Sharon has always consistently gotten A's in English.[7] However, her grasp of science and math is particularly weak by comparison, barely scraping through with a C average.[9][10]\n\nBut if she really applies herself, she is capable of excelling, since she worked out a complicated mathematic proof in the space of an hour.[9] Sharon has a high level of skill at cooking and preparing food. Josh, in particular, is fond of her culinary creations, specifically, her oatmeal cookies.\n\nSince her father, Richard, is well versed in the culinary arts, she may have learned these skills from him. Sharon is good at driving vehicles. In just half an hour, she became a better driver than Adam, who had at least a year of practical experience. She did crash the car though, but only because she was unfamiliar with which pedals to press. Even so, she had enough skill to control the crash, so nobody was injured. The car was even capable of being driven after the crash without any ill effects on its act.\n\nSharon's fashion[]\n\nShe has a preference for butterflies as a personal motif.\n\nNecklace\n\nButterfly Hairclip\n\nWinter Top The butterfly hairclip is used only with formal dresses.\n\n\"Living\" braces[]\n\nIncidents with Sharon's braces fall into one of these categories:\n\nInterfere with or break in electronic devices\n\nInteract with communications devices as a receiver or short-wave transmitter\n\nMagnetic attraction to metallic objects\n\nFor a detailed list and descriptions of Living Braces incidents, see: Living Braces\n\nTrivia[]\n\nSharon took ballet lessons as a young girl, but a broken leg,caused her to miss enough classes that she was ultimately forced to quit.\n\nSharon liked the smell of freshly cleaned laundry, which is often used by Maria to cheer her up whenever she is depressed.\n\nSharon liked popcorn—so much so that she generally not to share it with anyone and will consume large quantities of it to the point of getting stomachaches. Ironically, popcorn is one of the foods that people with braces are advised against eating (as it could get stuck in our braces and be very hard to remove).\n\nWhile her birthday is never revealed, Sharon was probably born sometime in the fall -- in \"14 Candles\", her mother is planting her tulip bulbs and mentions her tomato plants still producing fruit. It is also worth mentioning the colored leaves that her aunt and uncle were there to see.\n\nAlso, considering the show's timeline, Sharon was probably born in either 1987 (the Year of the Rabbit) or 1988 (the Year of the Dragon).\n\nSharon knows all the lyrics to all of Mangled Metal's songs by heart.\n\nSharon is very familiar with electronic devices related to live music performances and is able to diagnose technical issues very easily, due to being around her father's band.\n\nShe thought her first period was actually appendicitis.\n\nOnce, Maria believed Sharon to be racist, but Sharon accepts people of diverse backgrounds.\n\nMany fans have noted how Sharon bears an uncanny resemblance to the animated version of Sabrina Spellman. It is unknown if the resemblance is accidental or intentional.\n\nShe is the only character to appear in all 78 episodes in total of the series.\n\nIn the Québécois version of the show, her name was changed to \"Charlotte\".\n\nSharon was voiced by Alicia Silverstone (of Clueless fame) in the first two seasons and Stacey DePass in the third and final season.\n\nThe character Sharon, who was designed to explore, reflect and mirror Alicia's own life experiences and personal beliefs, such as being a vegetarian and concerned for animal rights—although the first voice actress Alicia Silverstone is US-born while Sharon Spitz is Canadian, and while Alicia lives in Hillsborough, California, Sharon lives in Elkford, British Columbia.\n\nIn the Danish dub of the show, her name is changed to \"Sally Sand.\"\n\nSilverstone performed the show's theme music throughout its opening sequence.\n\nThrough her father, she's half Jewish.\n\nVoice Actors[]\n\nEnglish (Original Version): Alicia Silverstone (seasons 1-2), Stacey DePass (Season 3)\n\nDutch (Netherlands and Flanders): Angela Schijf\n\nGallery[]\n\nSee Sharon Spitz/Gallery"
