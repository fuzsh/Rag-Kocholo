        "text": "I recently returned home from university for the Summer holidays which I was really excited about. Of course I was excited to see my family and friends the most, but also a fully stocked kitchen in a steady second place (student struggles). Although, I was also sneakily excited to just sit on a comfy settee and watch TV because I didn’t have one at uni and the sofas there may as well have been made out of bricks.\n\nNow, what I am about to tell you was inevitable and should have happened years ago, but the time had finally came that my dad had got rid of all the children’s channels. That’s right, no Nickelodeon, Disney Channel or Nicktoons. Cartoon Network is still there but let’s face it, it’s not what it once was. I shouldn’t complain, as it is such a first world problem, and though I am a child inside I should really distract my mind from ‘American garbage’ (as my Dad says). But a little warning would have gone a long way, I did let out a little whimper when the big, black, pop-up of doom opened as I tried to enter the channel.\n\nBut then it got me thinking, I really miss my childhood programmes. And not just because I couldn’t access them on the TV, but because they simply do not air them any longer. So here’s a condensed list of some of my favourite shows and memories. I hope you enjoy!\n\nThat’s So Raven\n\nEverybody’s favourite teen psychic who looks remarkably like ‘Galleria’ in ‘The Cheetah Girls’. Definitely one of my favourites. A Disney classic with the lead and her two best friends (Eddie and Chelsea) getting caught up in mischief in an American high school, but with the twist of Raven’s future seeing visions. Top 3 memories:\n\n1. When Raven ate a mushroom and because of her allergy she blew up like Aunt Marge in Harry Potter.\n\n2. Boyz N Motion- The That’s So Raven equivalent of One Direction today (although based on N Sync). Here’s a compilation if you’re in the mood to reminisce http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za5fWpPvw1U\n\n3. Mr Lawler- The Principal that had a consistent stutter on his letter ‘p’, causing him to spit all over whoever he was talking to. “That’s p-p-p-p-p-preposterous!!”\n\nSuite Life of Zack and Cody\n\nThis show followed a pair of adventurous twins who lived permanently in the Tipton Hotel because their mother worked as a singer there. It has great characters, and is one of the few shows where the blonde is smart and the brunette is dumb.\n\n1. Esteban. Or should I say Esteban Julio Ricardo Montoya Del Rosa Ramirez (*INHALE*), completely made the show for me. A sweet, helpful, kind-hearted character who referred to Zack and Cody as ‘little people’… I think we could all do with an Esteban in our lives.\n\n2. When Mr Moseby tried to teach London Tipton (a pun on Paris Hilton if you didn’t click!) how to drive. She hilariously referred to the gear shift as the ‘PRNDL’, angled all the mirrors at herself so that she could see herself having fun and didn’t want to put her seatbelt on in case it creased her designer shirt.\n\n3. When Cody dressed up as ‘Tyreesha’ so he could attend an all girl’s sleepover. Thinking about it now it is really rather creepy, but he was surprisingly impressive at acting like a girl. And that episode involved a very young Victoria Justice.\n\nSaved by the Bell\n\nSaved by the Bell was easily my favourite TV show as a child. Kelly Kapowski was my first girlcrush (who by the way has the cutest daughter now if you follow her on instagram) and Screech in my opinion was the 90’s comedy king. Anyone who watched it probably understands the disappointment when it was one of the Tori episodes rather than Kelly and Jessie, the original cast was of course the best.\n\n1. When Zack and Kelly had their own prom. That is my idea of romance, possibly my all time favourite scene from any TV show- so cute!\n\n2. The episode where all of the teachers and students switched roles for a week. I absolutely loved the idea and forever wished that it would happen at my school. I think I even remember conversations with my friends where we sorted out who would teach which subject.\n\n3. Joint third are two episodes (I couldn’t choose so a little cheat- apologies!). I loved the one where Screech invented a spaghetti sauce called ‘Screech-a-Mia’ and there was a conveyor belt where all the cast had their own little jobs to do on the production line and it kept going wrong. And I always liked the beauty pageant episode where Screech gave his emotional speech and Jessie had a little rant about objectifying women.\n\nLizzie McGuire\n\n1. When the cast did a murder mystery episode in Lizzie’s house and they all dressed up in 20’s style costumes. I loved the part near the end where Gordo nearly gets out of the friendzone and Lizzie’s Dad interrupts and reminds Lizzie that there is an eel cooking competition on TV.\n\n2. Lizzie wants a bra, so she demands a bra. I remember this part of the episode so clearly. She was stood in front of her family and her mom was getting suspicious about why she wanted to go to the mall so badly, and Lizzie screamed she wanted a bra. For some reason I thought it was really naughty and rude, if one of my parents were in the room and I knew it was coming up I used to change the channel!\n\n3. That episode where Gordo got a credit card and he acted like a millionaire director and created a $5000 alien film with his classmates\n\nDrake and Josh\n\nDrake and Josh was just awesome, every episode was great and the script was always so funny and entertaining. These ‘two brothers from another mother’ have such a bromance and with the addition of their evil yet clever little sister Megan they always found themselves in ridiculous scenarios.\n\n1. The one where Drake and Josh had a bet that they could go the longest without eating junk food (Drake) and video games (Josh) or the loser had to dye… their hair pink! The scene near the end where Josh transformed their bedroom into a candy palace with cotton candy pillows and a chocolate milk paddling pool was amazing and made me jealous every time.\n\n2. Josh’s little sayings! “Hug me Brotha!!”, “Headaches! You give me headaches!”, “I ain’t callin’ you a truther!”, “The cooliest?”, “Megan *glare*” and so many more!\n\n3. I always loved the one where Drake and Josh’s parents went away for Spring Break and they made their house into a hotel because they spent all the money their parents left them. I thought it was so funny, especially when they had to try and get rid of the guests by saying the hotel was infested with green spray that made your eyes bleed.\n\nThese are just a sample of the TV shows I used to love growing up. I also used to like Powerpuff Girls, Sailor Moon, Sabrina, The Amanda Show, Zoey 101, My Parents are Aliens, Hannah Montana, Braceface, Pokemon, Power Rangers… and probably loads more! If you would like to share any other childhood tv memories go ahead and drop a comment, I’d like to know what your favourites are!"
