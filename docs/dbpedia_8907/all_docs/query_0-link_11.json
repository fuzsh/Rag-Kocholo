Her braces are somehow electrically charged at all times, giving her strange abilities such as remotely operating machinery, tapping into wireless communication channels, and even discharging electricity directly into what's in front of her, though much of these abilities are often outside her control. In the first season, she is enrolled at Mary Pickford Junior High but later the show progresses into Sharon going into high school.\n\nCast\n\nAlicia Silverstone (seasons 1–2) and Stacey DePass (season 3) as Sharon Spitz\n\nDan Petronijevic as Adam Spitz\n\nMichael Cera as Josh Spitz\n\nTamara Bernier Evans as Helen Spitz\n\nMarnie McPhail as Maria Wong\n\nPeter Oldring as Conner Mackenzie\n\nVince Corazza as Alden Jones\n\nKatie Griffin as Nina Harper\n\nDaniel DeSanto as Brock Leighton\n\nEmily Hampshire as Alyson Malitski\n\nElisa Moolecherry as Hannah Corbett\n\nEpisodes\n\nMain article: List of Braceface episodes\n\nList of Braceface episodes\n\nProduction\n\nThe show was produced by Nelvana in Canada and Jade Animation (Shenzhen) in China, with additional work done by Studio B Productions.\n\nBroadcast\n\nIn the United States, the series originally aired on Fox Family Channel starting on June 2, 2001, with reruns on its successor ABC Family and future corporate sibling Disney Channel and Toon Disney.
