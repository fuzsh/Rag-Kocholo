The process, however, is marred by numerous problems, including cost overruns and shoddy workmanship. Grantâ€™s character, a harried ad executive, discovers his dream home is more like a nightmare, all while having to deal with a hellish commute. The situation is further complicated by troubles at work and his suspicion that his wife is having an affair with his best friend (played by Melvyn Douglas).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz"
