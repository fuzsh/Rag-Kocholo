        "text": "Teachers\n\nThis lesson invites students to search and sift through rare print documents, early motion pictures, photographs, and recorded sounds from the Library of Congress. Students experience the depth and breadth of the digital resources of the Library, tell the story of a decade, and help define the American Dream.\n\nObjectives:\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\nanalyze, interpret, and conduct research with digitized primary source documents\n\n19th and 20th century social life in the United States using digitized documents from the Library of Congress\n\ndefine, present and defend their ideas about what the American Dream has been, through the decades\n\nrelate what they have uncovered from inquiry and research to their own American Dream\n\nTime Required\n\nTwo to three weeks\n\nLesson Preparation\n\nMaterials\n\nTeacher's Guides and Analysis Tool\n\nResources\n\nBackground essay: \"What Is the American Dream?\"\n\nWall of Dreams\n\nCiting Primary Sources\n\nLesson Procedure\n\nIntroduction\n\nEntry Level Skills and Knowledge\n\nA basic understanding of Internet research, knowledge of search terms to navigate Library of Congress digital content, and reasonable facility with multimedia tools are needed.\n\nWhen working with archival collections students must think like historians and archivists. Resources from the Teachers Page can help students get started. Acquaint students with the unique qualities of primary resources. You may want to create or use a set of primary sources to help students understand the process of primary source analysis.\n\nOrganizational Requirements\n\nDefine the scope of the project:\n\nBefore introducing the lesson, or as a class, define the scope of the historical research conducted in this project. Will teams gather material from a specific decade? Will they work with a single Digital Collection? Will research be guided by a theme, such as immigration? Will research be linked to literature the class is reading?\n\nDetermine desired learning outcomes:\n\nWhat do you expect your students to know and be able to do when they have completed the activities. Create an assessment rubric for students based on your expectations.\n\nDetermine required learning product(s):\n\nYou may want students to create a Web page, a multimedia product, a video, or a contribution to the transformation of their classroom into a Decades Museum. Whatever format the student product may take, students should present and defend their ideas.\n\nEngage students:\n\nInvite students to begin their inquiry by considering the dreams of today and the dreamers of the present. Next, use The Library of Congress collections to learn about our cultural heritage and find evidence of the dreamers in our collective history. Finally, ask your students to compare their own dreams to the dreams of those who lived before them. Students should understand that history is the continuing story of human experience, the stories of people like themselves. Help students to understand that as they define and pursue their own dreams, they create the future of our nation and the world.\n\nOrganize:\n\nIntroduce students to the student lesson pages. Divide your class into learning teams and assign roles and responsibilities.\n\nEach team will select (or be assigned) a research role (photographer, lawyer, poet, politician, producer, comedian, musician). Each student will work as part of the team to complete the project. Remind students that while they each have specific tasks, all team members pitch in and help one another. Provide time for students to explore the student page of the project.\n\nTeam Description Product Photographer With your artful eye, you capture the images of the American Dream. Design a photo essay that shows the American Dream. Show how the Dream has been affected by time, cultural influences, and significant historical events. Lawyer Your passion for controversy and debate guide your vision of the American Dream. Prepare a legal brief about the status of the American Dream. (Legal brief includes: title, who vs. whom, statement of facts, argument, conclusion, references.) Poet Using your poetic grasp of language, you seek out the heart and soul of the American Dream. Create a poet's notebook that shows the American Dream. Your notebook includes samples of your poetry that shows how the \"Dream\" has been affected by time, cultural influences, and significant historical events. Politician With a finger on the pulse of the American people, you trace significant political events that shape the American Dream. Write and deliver a speech that traces the political events that shape the American Dream. Your speech shows how the \"Dream\" has been affected by political response to cultural influences and significant historical events. Producer Lights, camera, action! You show the story of the American Dream through stories, films, and a script for a movie. Make a storyboard for your movie. Sequence the scenes to produce a movie of the American Dream. Comedian You find the irony in the American Dream. Write a standup comic script or create a political cartoon or comic strip that expresses irony or the humorous side of the American Dream. Musician With your ear for melody, you play the music of the American Dream. Write the sheet music or record music that characterizes the American Dream based upon your research. Reporter On the newsbeat you report and chronicle the events which shape the American Dream. Write a news article that reports the results of your research on the American Dream. (Article includes: title, who, what, when, where, and how.) Your news article describes the events that have shaped the American Dream through the decades.\n\nIndividual responsibilities might include:\n\nTeam Manager\n\nAs team manager you have full responsibility for this team. You will manage all aspects of the project by assisting the research, production, and archive managers in meeting their obligations to complete the project. Excellent interpersonal and management skills are required. You are ultimately responsible for helping the team meet the project deadline.\n\nResearch Manager\n\nYour job is key to the success of this project. You can shape the research by using focus questions. You will assist others in finding just the right quote, picture, or sound bite. Your team will rely on effective use of your detective and inquiry skills as you search the collections.\n\nProduction Manager\n\nYou will lead the group in building the final product. You must gather materials from your archive manager and work with the researcher during production. You must be flexible and resourceful as you work and assist others with last minute changes; manage graphics, sound or movie clips; and deal with the unexpected occurrences of creating a product.\n\nArchive Manager\n\nExcellent organizational skills make this job a challenge. You will keep track of all materials for the team and check to be sure that resources are compatible. For example, are your sound clips in the correct format? You will keep the original files, and back up files, and organize the the final project.\n\nBuilding Background Knowledge and Skills\n\n(suggested- 2 class periods)\n\nAnticipatory Set:\n\nLink to students' prior knowledge and work with them to develop a concept of the traditional \"American Dream.\" Use the \"What Is the American Dream?\" essay to initiate a discussion (either as a whole class or in team groups).\n\nYou may wish to have your students conduct interviews, explore other readings, engage in further class discussions, or hear guest speakers. Pair them to brainstorm: What do you already know about the American Dream? They might use paper or visual thinking software to record ideas and then share them with the learning team members in their groups.\n\nPrimary Source Analysis:\n\nBefore students begin their research, review strategies for analyzing primary source materials. Each student team will work with a set of pre-selected materials. Students analyze the materials recording their thoughts on the Primary Source Analysis Tool. Before the students begin, select questions from the teacher's guide Analyzing Primary Sources to focus and prompt analysis and discussion.\n\nEach team will analyze its assigned primary source.\n\nPhotographer - George O. Waters(?), Dry Valley, near Comstock Nebraska\n\nPoet - \"Dedication,\" Robert Frost's presidential inaugural poem, 20 January 1961\n\nPolitician - \"Americanism\", Harding, Warren G. (Warren Gamaliel), 1865-1923\n\nProducer - Arrival of immigrants, Ellis Island\n\nComedian - Katzenjammer Kids: \"Policy and pie\"\n\nLawyer - An Account of the Proceedings on the Trail of Susan B. Anthony\n\nMusician - The old cabin home. H. De Marsan, Publisher, 54 Chatham Street, New York\n\nReporter - The Boston Gazette, and Country Journal. Monday, March 12, 1770\n\nResearching Online and Gathering Primary Resources\n\n(suggested - 5 class periods)\n\nTeam organization and accountability:\n\nGuide students in choosing a research role and developing an action plan. One strategy is to assign roles, such as team manager, research manager, production manager or archive manager. Support students as needed in identifying tasks to be completed and drafting a timeline.\n\nPossible considerations during research might include:\n\nTheme or Topic: What is your focus for inquiry? Identify your research topic or theme.\n\nResearch Questions: What questions will focus your research? List a series of questions you intend to answer to focus your research. What additional information do you need to answer these questions?\n\nPrimary Sources: How will you know you've found what you are looking for? List the type of resources you intend to look for to answer your research questions. What primary resources from the Library of Congress will you search for?\n\nEvidence: How do you know that the examples you've found are valid? Once you have located a few examples of primary sources, what are your criteria for selecting these as evidence?\n\nYou may require each team to keep a \"research log\" of work accomplished during each work session to help students stay focused and, later, to help in the evaluative process.\n\nReview the assessment questions:\n\nChoose the questions that will provide a focus for the project. Students can use these questions to guide their research.\n\nGathering primary sources:\n\nAs a class, create and continually add to, a list of \"tried and true\" search terms. Remind students that the Library of Congress Web site is a collection of collections. It is not encyclopedic and it simply does not have \"everything.\" If an initial search does not yield desired results, guide students in how they can narrow or refocus the search. Your schedule may limit students to visiting only the suggested collections and provided links for each team. As possible, however, encourage them to identify additional items in the Library of Congress collections and to expand their resources with other sources.\n\nBegin independent team exploration.\n\nSupply students with primary source analysis tools to use to record their growing set of evidence. Allow at least two (more preferred) days/class periods for exploration and research.\n\nCreating the Learning Product\n\nStudents can produce a variety of products to demonstrate their interpretation of the material. Public or private Web sites, podcasting, digital narratives, video documentaries, slide shows, oral presentations, booklets or newspapers, or museum display within the classroom of print documents, multimedia, and realia are all excellent vehicles for students to share their learning.\n\nCreating and refining a final learning product that allows students to represent, present and defend their ideas about the American Dream is the tangible outcome of this project. Allow plenty of time for this vital phase. (Having students add what transpires during this phase of the project to their research log can provide useful insight in the evaluation process.)\n\nReinforce ethical use of the Internet by requiring that proper citation and/or bibliographical entry be used for all collected print and Internet resources.\n\nDeveloping a Personal Dream for their Future\n\n(1 class period)\n\nWhen students have completed their research and have produced and presented the products that share their learning, they can be invited to consider their own American Dream – for themselves, their families and loved ones, their community, their nation and the world. Encourage students to give serious thought and honest expression to their hopes and dreams for the future. For inspiration, they may wish to view the Wall of Dreams contributed by other students.\n\nExtension\n\nWho are the dreamers that inspire us today? Ask students to read about or interview others who have a dream. Enrich this project with your own web resources, books, movie clips, interviews, or guest speakers.\n\nLesson Evaluation\n\nSelf and Peer Assessment\n\nA confidential self-evaluation from each student can provide the teacher with further valuable input, and will help the student reflect upon their own learning and performance. Students are also asked to evaluate the work and contributions of team members.\n\nTeacher Assessment\n\nStudent teams may be asked the following assessment questions:\n\nWhat is the American Dream?\n\nHow has the American Dream changed over time?\n\nHow do diverse cultures view the American Dream?\n\nHow have significant historical events affected the American Dream?\n\nHow will new opportunities of the 21st century challenge the American Dream?\n\nWhat makes your area of interest an effective medium for sharing the American Dream?\n\nWhat is your American Dream?\n\nThe team products, and their presentation, should provide evidence of understanding from each team member. Be sure to require that each student contribute to the important tasks of presenting and defending a specific viewpoint.\n\nEvaluate student work according to the evaluative criteria you and your students identified before beginning the project.\n\nCredits\n\nKathleen Ferenz and Leni Donlan, American Memory Fellows, 1997\n\nStudents\n\nProcedure\n\nWhat is the American Dream? Is it the same for all Americans? Is it a myth? Is it simply a quest for a better life? How has the American Dream changed over time? Some see their dreams wither and die while others see their dreams fulfilled. Why? Everyone has dreams about a personally fulfilled life ...what is your dream?\n\nYour job is to research the dreams of others. You will then create and publish your interpretation of the \"American Dream.\"\n\nDivide into teams by research roles (photographer, lawyer, poet, politician, producer, comedian, musician).\n\nDefine the American Dream with your group.\n\nSearch in the Digital Colections and document the dreams of those who lived in the past.\n\nIdentify and publish your interpretation of the \"American Dream\" according to your research role and the evidence you found.\n\nReflect upon your personal dream — for the nation and for yourself.\n\nReview the Wall of Dreams for ideas. Write your own personal dream to share with your teacher and class.\n\nWall of Dreams\n\nThese dreams are a sampling from the thousands of student dreams collected from 1998 - 2006. Define your dream for yourself, your family, your community, your country and our world.\n\nMy dream is to write a story that makes people think, dream, imagine, care, and feel. I want to change the world by making people care for each other. I want to show the world my thoughts through the words in my stories and maybe see how others like me feel. L. C., Student, Dakota Valley High School. Grade 11\n\nMy dream is that someday... kids will not have to live in poverty. It makes me see how fortunate I am to have what I have. My other dream is for all wars to stop, and to declare world peace. All of this fighting is putting a bad impression on people, some think life is all about war, and we could live in a better place and be better people if we could all get along. A. B., Student, Henderson Intermediate School, Grade 6\n\nMy American Dream is to make the world a happier and more joyful place. I can achieve it by helping other people conquer sickness, hardships, and sadness. The world is a troubled place now. I hope I can make a difference. People all over the world are having tough times. War is killing many people and causing great sadness. This is my American Dream because we are seeing death everywhere now. J. C., Student, Encinal Elementary, Grade 5\n\nMy American Dream has several parts. First, I want my family to be happy, healthy, and comfortable. Rich is not necessary, though it would be nice. Second, I want to be able to use my brains and skills to become a geneticist so that I can create cures to help people live better. If I can make the world better for even one person, I will have met that goal. I want chocolate to be declared a health food. I know, that's not reasonable, but it is a dream I have. \"Are you ill? Take two Hershey bars and call me in the morning.\" I want to invent the self-cleaning bedroom. (No further explanation necessary). But more than any of these, I dream of peace. I want everyone here to understand and help each other, regardless of race, religion, color, creed, size, shape, sexual orientation, just because we are all members of the same species: Homo sapien. That is my American Dream. A. G., Student, Home Schooled, Grade 8\n\nMy American Dream is one in which all the children recognize their potential and work to understand they can be the best in whatever they choose to do as a life work. I wish for them to be gentle but honest with themselves, to love themselves and see the special persons they are becoming and that they work to live in harmony with all humankind. M. B., Teacher, Crawford AuSable, Grade 8\n\nI have a dream that everyone will stop smoking and people will stop polluting and that everybody will live in peace. W. P., Student, Beech Tree Elementary School, Grades K-3\n\nMy dream is to help our nation realize greater freedom and opportunity for all its citizens. Racial, sexual, and economic dividers are still very much in place in our nation, and overcoming such forms of bias comes only with affirmative action as well as educating our people against prejudice and discrimination. And most importantly, it is our duty to remember our nation's involvement in slavery, our deliberate mistreatment of America's native peoples, and our apathetic complacency during the worst act of genocide in history--these must all be painfully remembered to prevent such blots to fall on our account again. I wish to be actively involved in history, a living history that will affect every person out there in our great land, who will remember our past, its glories, triumphs, and yes, its failures. To do this is our responsibility to future generations, to make our nation a more thoughtful nation and our people more thoughtful people. That is my American Dream. A. I., Student, Homeschool, Grade 12\n\nEveryone says that their American Dream is for every American to be equal. This is very unrealistic because everyone is different in some way. America has the most diverse population in the world. This trait sets us apart from other countries. So instead of being equal, my American Dream is for everyone to receive and give the utmost respect to all Americans despite differences we all have. A. M., Student, Cass Tech High School, Grade 11\n\nMy American Dream is to be able to live in my country as a free person - free to live, free to dream, free to change and free to live with others who are not the same as me. I don't want to accumulate 'stuff' and have more than the other guy. I want to make sure that we all have enough to live and care for our country. It is not about getting ahead or beating another person, but it is about working together to make and keep the United States a great place. We all can do this by working in the system and changing it when we see that change is needed. In this way we can all live our American Dream together. J. M., Student, CPDLF, Grade 8\n\nI dream that America will turn its goodwill and wealth to the rest of the world and help end poverty and war. We can do this by providing more help and education to the poorest nations, and by building a just system around the world where the children are fed, healthy and educated and perhaps they would not hate us so much. If we helped them develop their own resources instead of stealing their resources they could then support themselves and be proud of themselves and not hate us. P. W., Student, Florida Virtual School, Grade 8\n\nMy dream is that I wish people would not judge people because they are different from them. The only reason why people are racist is because they are scared of changes. I would hope that people would become mature enough and forget their differences between each other. T. S., Student, James A. Garfield Community Magnet School, Grade 8\n\nMy dream is for the children to grow up in a country, any country, feeling proud, free, and safe. I would hope that the politicians worldwide would put the interests of their citizens first, their military second, and themselves last. K. M., Teacher, St. John's, postgraduate\n\nMy dream is peace in my lifetime between people of all religions: Peace so my father will not have to go to war again, Peace so my little brother can grow up unafraid. C. S., Student, ML King, Grade 5\n\nMy American Dream is to be a fair person and treat everybody equal. I want the people that come to America from different countries to feel like they have a place here in the United States. We can make them feel like this is their home. Also my American Dream is to give everybody the same rights. That even if you're homeless or rich you still have the same rights as everybody else. I think everybody should have the same equal rights. V. K., Student, Clara Barton, Grade 5\n\nMy dream is to have a crime free world. People should be able to feel safe in their neighborhoods. I also want the world to be free of homeless people. Everybody should have a place to live and food to eat. Everybody should have access to quality medical attention and quality education. I want worldwide peace and no more wars. I also want world hunger to come to an end. M. Y., Student, MBTA. Grade 8\n\nSimilar to the many past dreamers such as Martin Luther King, who wanted equal rights, I want everyone to have equal rights. Based on the culture and values that I have been brought up with, I know that it is especially hard to stop a prejudice that has been traveling through every generation. But, by teaching our children and being a model of acceptance ourselves, we can avoid making those same mistakes from past generations. It has definitely gotten better, and I believe our generation can become the role models for the new millennium. K. L., Student, Allentown High School, Grade 11\n\nMy American Dream is a place where no one is discriminated against nor judged because of their race, where everyone is equal, where people are never deprived of their rights, and where the accused have the chance to explain. I dream of a place where justice is served righteously and schools have capable teachers who do everything to help the children they teach. I dream of a place where people can understand and accept new and different things. This is my dream and I hope it becomes a reality. E. L., Student, FLVS, Grade 8\n\nMy American Dream is for people to be able to express themselves without catching ridicule from their peers. It hurts when your individuality crushes who you try to present yourself to be because you feel shameful of who you really are. S. F., Student, Pell City High School, Grade 10\n\nI dream that one day the world will be united in a world where all people can speak and understand one another. I dream of a world where nobody goes to bed hungry or abused. I dream of a world that is free from violence--a world in which all people could live peacefully with one another. L. B., Teacher, HSU, Grade K-3\n\nGetting Started\n\nChoose a Research Role\n\nAs a group, choose one of the research roles to create your project:\n\nPhotographer\n\nYou are the eyes of America.\n\nDesign a photo essay that shows the American Dream.

Read \"What Is The American Dream?\". Find out what the dream means to each member of your group. Brainstorm and share your ideas. What do you know about the \"American Dream\"? With a partner create a mind map of what you know, or believe you know, about the American Dream. All ideas are valid. Use paper or visual thinking software to record your ideas. Share the results with your learning team members in your group. This is the beginning of your project, so file your results with your archive manager.\n\nWhat Is The American Dream?\n\nJames Truslow Adams, in his book The Epic of America, which was written in 1931, stated that the American dream is \"that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement. It is a difficult dream for the European upper classes to interpret adequately, and too many of us ourselves have grown weary and mistrustful of it. It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position.\" (p.214-215)\n\nThe authors of the United States’ Declaration of Independence held certain truths to be self-evident: that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.\" Might this sentiment be considered the foundation of the American Dream?\n\nWere homesteaders who left the big cities of the east to find happiness and their piece of land in the unknown wilderness pursuing these inalienable Rights? Were the immigrants who came to the United States looking for their bit of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, their Dream? And what did the desire of the veteran of World War II - to settle down, to have a home, a car and a family - tell us about this evolving Dream? Is the American Dream attainable by all Americans?\n\nSome say, that the American Dream has become the pursuit of material prosperity - that people work more hours to get bigger cars, fancier homes, the fruits of prosperity for their families - but have less time to enjoy their prosperity. Others say that the American Dream is beyond the grasp of the working poor who must work two jobs to insure their family’s survival. Yet others look toward a new American Dream with less focus on financial gain and more emphasis on living a simple, fulfilling life.\n\nThomas Wolfe said, \"…to every man, regardless of his birth, his shining, golden opportunity ….the right to live, to work, to be himself, and to become whatever thing his manhood and his vision can combine to make him.\"\n\nIs this your American Dream?\n\nDefine your Project\n\nDetermine your research theme or topic: Are you interested in immigration/emigration, families, social life? Will you investigate one decade or compare how the American Dream evolved over the decades? Discuss topic ideas with your group.\n\nAnalyzing Documents\n\nUse the Primary Source Analysis tool and questions provided by your teacher to practice reading and interpreting sources with sample materials. Your team will look at resources through the lens of your research role.\n\nPhotographer - Sylvester Rawding family in front of sod house, north of Sargent, Custer County, Nebraska\n\nPoet - \"Dedication,\" Robert Frost's presidential inaugural poem, 20 January 1961\n\nPolitician - \"Americanism\", Harding, Warren G. (Warren Gamaliel), 1865-1923\n\nProducer - Arrival of immigrants, Ellis Island\n\nComedian - Katzenjammer Kids: \"Policy and pie\"\n\nLawyer - The case of Dred Scott in the United States Supreme Court\n\nMusician - The old cabin home. H. De Marsan, Publisher, 54 Chatham Street, New York\n\nReporter - Suffrage Ratification Is Completed by Tennessee\n\nResearch — Gather Evidence — Create the Team Product\n\nAs a group, be sure you all understand the task for your team's research role. Divide the tasks. Create an action plan. Record the results of your discussion.\n\nDiscuss possible questions and anticipate how you will answer them. Search the digital collections collections and gather your evidence.\n\nCreate your learning product. Develop a strategy to share your learning project which allows all team members to contribute and share their ideas.\n\nEvaluation\n\nYou and your teacher established expectations for the project before you started your work. You and your team recorded your progress. Your teacher may be using a rubric to evaluate your work. You understand the difference between excellent, good, and satisfactory work.\n\nComplete a confidential team and self evaluation that describes how you contributed to your team’s effort and what you have learned.\n\nConclusion\n\nYou were challenged to investigate the American Dream, to see if it is the same for all Americans and whether it is real or just a myth. Did you find that it is simply a quest for a better life? What did you discover about how the Dream has changed over time? Do you now know why some see their dreams wither and die while others see their dreams fulfilled? What is your dream?\n\nYou've finished a group project. You've presented your ideas to your class. Has this experience influenced your view of the American Dream? How? Now that you have completed your project:\n\nWhat questions do you still have about the American Dream?\n\nWhat can the dreams of others teach you?\n\nWho are the dreamers of today?\n\nWere the dreams of yesteryear like your own dreams? In what ways?\n\nWhat IS the American Dream? Can it be simply stated?\n\nHow will YOUR personal dream become a part of America's (and the world's) future?"
