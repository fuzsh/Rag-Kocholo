        "text": "For those of us who grew up watching Spongebob Squarepants, the iconic yellow character has a special place in our hearts. But Netflix's new film, Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie, has been slammed by fans.\n\nIt certainly doesn't seem any match for 2004's The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, either. The new film only dropped on Netflix on August 2. However the film was leaked in its entirety earlier this year.\n\nIt stars Carolyn Lawrence as the voice of squirrel Sandy, while Tom Kenny returns to voice Spongebob. When Bikini Bottom is scooped out of the ocean, Sandy and SpongeBob head to Sandy's home state of Texas and enlist her family to help save Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs and the rest of the gang.\n\nThe film has a Rotten Tomatoes critics score of 55 percent across 11 reviews. Audiences have rated it even worse, awarding it 29 percent across more than 100 reviews.\n\nViewers took to social media to share their thoughts on the film. Many who'd admitted to watching the leaked version claimed the original version wasn't any different - despite receiving backlash over its CGI and a number of scenes at the time.\n\nTaking to X, formerly Twitter, fans didn't hold back. One said: \"I just watched the sandy cheeks movie. Short and simple: It was terrible. All the jokes don't land, horrible writing, awful acting, very unfinished looking animation, and above all... it was so boring.\"\n\nAnother vented: \"The new sandy cheeks movie is one of if not the worst thing to come out of SpongeBob ever. The humans are god awful and the films story is genuinely a f****** joke. I feel bad for the voice actors who worked on this because you can tell they cared. 2/10, Never watching this again\".\n\nAnother said: \"Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie is what you get when you combine Looney Tunes: Back in Action and Austin Powers and unfortunately I donâ€™t mean this in a good or fun way. This film is an absolute fever dream, the animation is a downgrade from the previous films and even the voice acting can sound off at times for certain characters.\"\n\nOver on Reddit, one fan reminisced: \"I remember watching this when it was leaked, wish I didn't,\" as another reckoned: \"I remember watching the January leaks, they should have changed some stuff after the backlash\".\n\nAnother said: \"The CGI made me uncomfortable\" as one person responded: \"Which is weird because the CGI was great in previous films. The 3D in Sponge Out of Water was perfect, no notes. What happened?\"\n\nNot everyone disliked it though. One critic wrote: \"Younger audiences that love SpongeBob SquarePants will enjoy this movie. The combination of live action and animation is beautifuly done,\" while another agreed: \"Itâ€™s not as inspired as grown-ups might want, but innocuous enough for the kids.\""
