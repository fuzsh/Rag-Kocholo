        "text": "Colleen Hoover's 2016 bestseller, now a feature film starring Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, has generated some eyebrow-raising discussion online\n\nBestselling author Colleen Hoover, 44, wrote her first book as a gift to her mom Vannoy Fite, but it was another family story that really made her a star.\n\nHoover's 2016 novel, It Ends With Us, which is based on her parents' relationship, will hit theaters as a feature film she co-executive produced with Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni (who also directed) on Aug. 9. And while the book is a runaway hit, ranking No. 1 on Amazon as of the time of publication, with more than 300,000 reviews and a 4.7-star rating, it's not without its critics. That's not unexpected, Hoover told PEOPLE for a story in this week's print issue.\n\nFor more on Colleen Hoover and It Ends With Us, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands now, or subscribe here.\n\nRelated: Everything to Know About Blake Lively's Upcoming Movie It Ends with Us\n\n\"A book that has this many readers, the negative attention's going to be loud,\" she explains, adding that she sometimes has to comfort friends who get up in arms trying to defend it online. \"The overall score and the amount of reviews on Amazon is incredible ... So I think people focus on all the negativity, but that's going to come with a book that has had this many readers, of course.\"\n\nSo what's the beef? Those who haven't read the book or watched the film will want to stop reading here, as spoilers lie ahead.\n\nSome fans criticized the portrayal of intimate partner violence\n\nBoth the book and movie version of It Ends With Us follows Lily Bloom as she embarks on a romance with Ryle, but over time, his violent side emerges. He emotionally, sexually and physically abuses Lily, who realizes their relationship needs to change after she becomes pregnant. Ultimately, Lily decides to divorce Ryle and allow him to continue to co-parent their daughter.\n\nThat choice has driven controversy, with some readers questioning Lily's choice to keep Ryle around for as long as she does. Others praise the realistic nature of the relationship, pointing out that leaving an abusive partner isn't an easy or straightforward decision.\n\nFor her part, Hoover has been open about how watching her own parents' relationship influenced that writing choice.\n\n“One of my earliest memories was him throwing a TV at her,” she told Today in 2023, of her biological father. “We grew up in an abusive household up to that point.”\n\n“There were no resources for women to leave situations like that,” she continued, adding her mother divorced her father when she was 2. “She was able to get out of that relationship. And then from then on, I just remember growing up with a mother who was so strong and independent.”\n\nHoover recounted that she \"would ask her mother all the time about how she was able to leave her father and ended up writing a book inspired by her mother’s courage.\"\n\nThe book is shelved as 'romance,' not 'fiction'\n\nThe categorization of the book as \"romance\" has also raised some eyebrows, because of the nature of Lily and Ryle's relationship. Some readers have suggested the book would be better shelved under \"contemporary fiction,\" while others argue that dark romance is a sub-genre in itself.\n\nRelated: 'It Ends With Us' Author Addresses Controversy Surrounding Casting of Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni\n\nSome fans thought Lily and Ryle should be younger\n\nOnce Lively and Baldoni were attached to the film, Hoover faced backlash because Lively, 36, and Baldoni, 39, are much older than the It Ends with Us characters.\n\nIn June 2023, Hoover explained that casting more mature actors actually corrects a mistake she realized post-publication. “I didn't know that neurosurgeons went to school for 50 years,\" she said. \"There's not a 20-something neurosurgeon.”\n\n“As I started making this movie, I'm like, ‘We need to age them out because I messed up,’ ” Hoover added. \"So that's my fault.\"\n\nOthers just didn't like the outfits\n\nThe costumes Lively wears in the film also drew criticism from devoted fans, with some calling her outfits \"frumpy,\" but those attached to the film brushed it off. \"We're not always thinking about why her clothes look that way in that area. And also once you see the movie, it all makes sense,\" Baldoni told ET.\n\nRelated: It Ends with Us Director Responds to Criticism on Blake Lively's Costumes: 'Just Go See the Movie'\n\nBaldoni added that once people see the movie, he thinks they'll be pleased, and that he (and the entire team) appreciate the passionate place those critiques come from.\n\nAnd as the one who dreamed them up, Hoover said doesn't even remember what Lily was wearing in the book. “I don’t remember describing outfits at all. I don’t care what they have on,” she told Today cohost Jenna Bush Hager at the time. “In my head, it’s about the conversation they’re having and the story. It’s the same way in the movie.\"\n\nLively also revealed one Easter egg related to Lily's attire: some of it came from her own closet. When the actress shared the trailer on Instagram, more than one follower salivated over the sparkly knee-high boots that open the video. When Lily walks into frame, the first thing the audience sees are the fishnet mesh pointed-toe boots by Saint Laurent.\n\nAudrey Long, who runs a celebrity fashion Instagram mostly dedicated to Lively, said she was \"dying\" over the boots.\n\nLively replied, revealing that she brought them from her own closet. \"they’re my real life boots I loaned to the movie :)\"\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nBoth Lively and Hoover promise fans one thing: Whether you read the book first and loved it, or watch the film and then run to your nearest bookstore to pick it up, you're going to love both.\n\n\"If you read the book first, I really genuinely believe, and I don't normally promise this, but I believe that you'll love this movie,\" Lively said. \"And then if you see the movie first and then you read the book, you'll love the book. And I think that that's that's the goal of it and I hope that we can accomplish that.\"\n\n\"'Cause as a reader first, you know, we want those movies to reflect the books that we write,\" Hoover added. \"And so I think y'all are gonna be very happy when it comes out.\"\n\nIt Ends With Us hits theaters on Aug. 9.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
