        "text": "7 Aug 2024\n\nDream\n\nLast night I dreamt that I was at a film premiere and everyone had brought hundreds of bags of sweeta. I waa juat aurrounded by treata.\n\n22 Jul 2024\n\nDream\n\nI had to figure out a way to escape post apocalyptic Russia before the survivors sacrificed me. It felt just like a post apocalyptic horror action film\n\n28 Jun 2024\n\nDream\n\nI had a dream I was back in college but the difference was I had already been and I was doing much better I was going to networking events like clubs and I was it was the beginning of the semester and my mom was driving me around in real light I had to leave my mom my car for a while while in college. I went to a film club and then started to feel good about how I was participating more, but the anxiety set in when I realized I was actually going to have to do Work for 2 or 4 years!\n\n14 Jun 2024\n\nDream\n\nIn the morning I opened the window and found numerous flying fishes on the tree and they watched films together.\n\n11 May 2024\n\nDream\n\nI had a dream about me being at my great grandmas house with my mom and terell. It was weird entities that were there and when i closed my eyes i hear weird evil voices in my head talking to me. I dont know what they were saying to me but they were giving me ideas. I declined them alot and talked back to them rudely. Then i went upstairs in my GG house and went in the bathroom. I dont know what i was there for but i randomly started doing some music video in a weird way. I was doing dances and then i danced my way back down stairs where everybody was at and danced around them. Later i was trying to sleep in the same room with my brother that night and i woke up in a different one. For some reason night time came so fast and it was time to go to sleep again. I was looking for the other room but i couldnt find it and i had to sleep alone in the dark. Eerie stuff happened that I dont remember. I woke up in the morning and went outside, and seen my mom trying to hode because she was too angey at certain people. I followed her back inside to go upstairs and go through a hatch to the roof and she climbed up in the chimney that was extremely tight and hid for a minute until the people were looking for her. They were gonna intimidate her to take me with them but popped out the window in the hidden room and started talking to them. I tried to fit in and go with her and but i couldnt fit at all through where my mom went. But everything was cool afterwards and she came back out. It was all cool and then next we heard about some mission we needed to do. So apparently i was watching some film like the Gatsby that was actually a future vision of what was gonna happen. But i randomly ran into this white dude and apparently he had seen that Leonardo DeCaprio, the actor of Gatsby was shot in the heart and dugged up, but found out he came back a live by replacing his heart muscle with a dead duaghters piece or something and came back out and went against us. The guy i worked with was saying that he found a tomb of his daughter. And what we did was bring her back to life somehow by giving her a little peice of our hearts? For some reason doing that gave me super speed and flight. The father didnt get anything so they were going to the gatsby house to the party they heard he was hosting. While we were driving, there were corrupted police going there as well and for some reason they caught us and hacked through our radio call while we were deiving at night and said, “cant wait to go the Gatsby party, but im not famaliar with the action you are taking. And the father I worked with just completely ignored them and hung up with no words said and the police were really mad and suspicious. But then they were trying to chase us down, and turned to a need for speed game and i was controling the car with a controller. I was really sweet with the driving like a pro. We were able to escape from the police and we ended up in the feild infront of the house to talk to someone to get the exact location and one of Gatsby ops just seen us and was trying to kill us with a gun, but i used my super speed to take him down. Then the father and daughter go back in the car and was on our way to the Gatsby house. I was flying over to make sure there isnt anybody stopping us. And then we made to his house and it was a big party. We saw him at the pool, I guess where he died at the first time from a shot but he was with everybody so no use to worry. He had actually wanted to confront Gatsby guy for what he did. But bedore we were about to reason with him, the fathers daughter who was in a black hoodie had a gun and shot him in the heart again and he died again in the same spot he had before. No one thought a 12 year old girl would just come out like that with a gun and just shoot someone. It was tragic but everything was normal now and she had her life back and ge was dead again. Then after that I woke up. I liked Leonardo DeCaprio so no hate. But it was weird to just go after him again to kill him in the same exact spot.\n\n6 Mar 2024\n\nDream\n\nI was hanging out with a group of “friends”, no one i know in real life but that’s what it felt like. They all happened to be all females. I don’t quite remember the argument but I ended up getting into an argument with one of the girls and I wrestled with her a bit. The girls separated us but I yelled at her and told her to never put her hands on me ever again and that, that was never okay. Then I stormed off because everyone was acting like it wasn’t a big deal. The next thing I know I’m outside walking through a construction site and suddenly it’s like a scene from a movie. But it’s specifically the end where the “good guys” win and it looked kind of like an old 80s film. Like a footloose or Breakfast club scene with all the weirdoes and the people who don’t fit in celebrating together. They were all people you wouldn’t imagine seeing together but they looked like best of friends. It was people of all genders and ethnicities but i was just there watching it not at all a part of it. Then I woke up.\n\n21 Feb 2024\n\nDream\n\nI was driving around with my sister and her fiancé. It was late and night and we were trying to find a place to park. I see him pull onto the street we needed to be on and then he put it in reverse and backed up. I got confused and a little worried that he was going to hit another car with how quick he backed up. It was also raining pretty hard so on top of that it was hard to see. He backed up and turned around and went into a parking lot that was further from the place we wanted to be. It frustrated me that we would have to walk in the torrential down pour but I just wanted to get to the place we needed to be. I started walking then realized I was by myself. My phone went off a couple of times and I got excited to see that it was from my crush. I intentionally left him on read because I thought it might provoke him to start a conversation. Even though I couldn’t see what he sent, I kept getting so many notifications from him. So I started to run and then it felt like I was filming a movie. I was running in the rain in slowmo and I really had the audience’s attention. I get to the place and it was a coffee shop I used to go to when I was younger before I had dance class. Except all the other buildings were different or unmarked. I walked into the coffee shop and it felt different. I went to go greet them and there was an older woman sweeping up behind the cash register and a younger woman who was also doing some busy work. As I opened my mouth to speak the older woman said something about closing that I didn’t quite hear. I asked her to repeat herself but as I looked up at her, her face wasn’t there. I could see her head moving with what she was saying but her face had disappeared. It was still hard to hear her and infocuse my attention to where her mouth would be so I could try to read lips. But they were gone. I could see her jaw moving in a motion that she was still speaking but her face was blank. I then ask her to relate herself again and this time I turn my face away so that my right ear is closer to her as a way to distract myself less with her missing face. But when I looked back everyone was gone and the shop was completely void of anything at all. I walk out and try to make my way back to the car in the rain but like before I was running in slowmo like I would be if I was in an intense drama movie. I turn around and see someone running as well. Not after me but towards me. He bumps into me and I fall on the wet pavement hard. I open my eyes and he’s looking back at me with a malicious look. I know he did that on purpose I just don’t know why. Then I start to see a light and I shift my focus to where it’s coming from and it’s a huge truck barreling down the side street. I quickly roll over to the sidewalk just in time to not get hit by this truck. At that point I knew it was a dream and I didn’t know what else to do. But I ended up waking up from my phone getting text messages\n\n19 Feb 2024\n\nDream\n\nOur family sitting in a roll at the movie theater and my boyfriends mom had brought some apple slices. Everyone was snacking on apple slices except my boyfriends daughter and kept complaining about not liking apples but would eat it if we had some chocolate also. My boyfriends mom asked if it was okay and I said no. We watched the movie and it was filmed by my boyfriends mom. She had included a line on the bottom that was a secret that only he would understand and said she hope he liked it\n\n9 Feb 2024\n\nDream\n\nHad a dream I was in New York and I was hired to be the photographer for the next Spider-Man movie. I told Zendaya & Tom holland the actors and Zendaya asked for my number. I took awesome pictures of Tom for the film.\n\n31 Jan 2024\n\nDream\n\nThe dream began with a group of women that looked like girls I possibly went to high school with. That feeling of their faces being familiar but they just don’t fit the person you are trying to remember. These women were glamorous and free-spirited and we were drinking and sitting in the hot tub outside of a large house with those glass walls that make it look open as hell. The dream changed to us running down a path as if we were following someone to a location. All of us ended up at some beach and I remember my boots getting ruined along the way. When we got there it was fun, we laughed and messed around but I got the feeling of being watched and there was someone taking photos of us in the water. This was the normal aspect in my opinion and only the beginning. I don’t think this shift in scenery was smooth, I must have had a brief moment of waking up because I was walking into some fancy hotel where I knew everyone like I came in every single day. The girl at the front desk talked to me like I was her best friend. A few times it would be like I just forgot what happened after I got to the front desk. The next time I walked inside I could barely get her attention because she was so busy. I offered to help and she showed me her calendar and apologized to me. Her grandma was supposedly out and she had to take over everything. I went through storage boxes for her? I pulled out a roll of 35mm camera film and lets just say… it was really fucking weird now. There were pictures on every single part of that film but I almost blacked out some of it if that makes sense? One was of me and my red hair that was on instagram at one point… another of them was blonde hair that was from me in 2008/2009 and I remember it clearly because I wore my hair in a specific way. It triggered a memory in my dream? (I have never had that happen…) The memory though, it felt like a whole other version of my life? I was myself, I remember my high school self but everyone with me was… off? I mentioned this type of thing before, its like I am trying to place them but they arent quite there… they are just similar… but I was at a park and I sat on this zebra statue and then a guy hoppe on and I was watching it from 3rd person. I spectated this dream and watched it like I knew it was me… Another one was my first year in high school because it looked like my yearbook photo… I was trying to process through it more but somehow I ruined the film. Now I reach the end and the part that was what I deemed a nightmare. I was in my childhood home… it was my bed and I had the curtains open and people were setting off fireworks in the yard and it was dangerously close to the house. I was already feeling so uncomfortable and that added to it. But then that guy… who was in the memory that jumped onto the statue with me sat down on my bed and was talking to me about the film and he was concerned about how crazy things were. Now there were people shooting fireworks out the windows and something caught on fire and also something happened at the back and they got killed and the guy disappeared and I woke up partially. I was in sleep paralysis at that point and trying to say help. I would fade in and out and the last little part I remember is hearing clearly when partially awake “no, you get back here.” I did come back and I couldn’t see the person again, but I also really dont remember what he said either. I just remember feeling like I didn’t have a way out. I stood at the top of a building and woke up.\n\n25 Jan 2024\n\nDream\n\nIn part of my dream, I was riding my bike down greenback lane past Dewey/van Maren and the sidewalk had opened up and these two dogs somersaulted into this crack in the earth and the crack was full of water. I mean it was a big crack, very wide. I had to steer the bike to the left in order to not go and crack myself. There was this group of people standing there and it was their dogs that went in the crack. The dogs weren't normal dogs, they were like deformed and decrepit and curled into balls. As I'm going down Greenback, I just keep going because I don't want to get hit by a car or get mobbed by these people. I end up in this crazy industrial area where ive never seen before. There are people are chasing each other and almost laser tagging but not quite. It was almost like parkour mixed in as well, there was people jumping from platform to platform. There was this giant movie theater that resembled the Crest Theater where I used to go trash film orgy. In the theater i met some really interesting people that I really clicked with. I just felt very at home with them and completely energized and revamped. We were all running around like crazy and doing all these acrobatics and laughing while we ran. We were taking over everything, it was absolutely amazing. I felt truly free for the first time in years. I finally belonged somewhere. I was home, in the truest soul sence.\n\n27 Dec 2023\n\nDream\n\nThere was an actor with very distinctive features who was popular and currently filming a new movie. This person was not a real actor. It was some sort of Dracula esque film. Then the dream switched to me. I was in my living room doing my makeup and playing piano on and off. I was playing the theme of Halloween lol. Then I remember that I hid something from my dad but idk what and was trying to distract him and get him to tell me about a movie. This worked ultimately so I went to my room and got dressed. That was when it was revealed that I was an amputee."
