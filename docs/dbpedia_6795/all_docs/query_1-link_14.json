        "text": "Dream Wife have released their new single ‘Orbit’ from their forthcoming third album ‘Social Lubrication’ – as well as announcing details of a UK and US tour.\n\nREAD MORE: Dream Wife on the cover: “Just because we’ve got vaginas, it doesn’t make us a ‘Girl Band’”\n\n‘Orbit’, produced by Dream Wife guitarist Alice Go and mixed by Alan Moulder, is a defiant song which they say was “written through the joy of jamming together and locking into the groove like a multi-limbed space-age organism.”\n\nThey continued: “‘Orbit’ has a dance rock edge from the early ’00s of bands like New Young Pony Club and Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Lyrically, it was inspired by post-lockdown London coming back to life and sharing a space through friendship, community and how each day you never know what’s in store for you or how a stranger can become someone close to you – for a day, a heartbeat, a phase, or a lifetime.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new single follows their previous releases ‘Hot (Don’t Date A Musician)’ and ‘Leech’, all from the trio’s upcoming third album ‘Social Lubrication’ which is set for release on June 9 via Lucky Number.\n\n‘Social Lubrication’ is an entirely self-written and self-produced album by the trio. In the band’s own words, the record is “hyper lusty rock and roll with a political punch, exploring the alchemy of attraction, the lust for life, embracing community and calling out the patriarchy. With a healthy dose of playfulness and fun thrown in.”\n\nRecommended\n\nSpeaking to NME last year about their return, Go said it “definitely felt important to re-establish” the band and to “come back with an unapologetic heavy-hitter”. “\n\nWe’re going back to what this band is about, which is those primal elements,” she said. “There’s a confidence to how we’re manifesting our music now. It’s something that had to come from within rather than externally.\n\n“It took being away from the live scene for us to realise that that’s what it’s all about for us. It’s a moment of return on a lot of levels for us, but it really does feel like a new era.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDream wife are set to embark on a UK and US tour beginning in next month.
