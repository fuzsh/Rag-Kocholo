        "text": "What Is the American Dream?\n\nThe term \"American dream\" refers to the belief that anyone, regardless of where they were born or what class they were born into, can attain their own version of success in a society in which upward mobility is possible for everyone.\n\nThe American dream is believed to be achieved through sacrifice, risk-taking, and hard work, rather than by chance.\n\nUnderstanding the American Dream\n\nThe term was coined by writer and historian James Truslow Adams in his best-selling 1931 book \"Epic of America.\" He described it as \"that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement.\"\n\nAdams went on to explain: \"It is a difficult dream for the European upper classes to interpret adequately, and too many of us ourselves have grown weary and mistrustful of it. It is not a dream of motorcars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position.\"\n\nThe idea of the American dream has much deeper roots. Its tenets can be found in the Declaration of Independence, which states: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.”\n\nIn a society based on these principles, an individual can live life to its fullest as they define it. America also grew mostly as a nation of immigrants who created a nation where becoming an American—and passing that citizenship to your children—didn't require being the child of an American.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of the American Dream\n\nAdvantages\n\nAchieving the American dream requires political and economic freedom, as well as rules of law and private property rights. Without them, individuals cannot make the choices that will permit them to attain success, nor can they have confidence that their achievements will not be taken away from them through arbitrary force.\n\nThe American dream promises freedom and equality. It offers the freedom to make both the large and small decisions that affect one’s life, the freedom to aspire to bigger and better things and the possibility of achieving them, the freedom to accumulate wealth, the opportunity to lead a dignified life, and the freedom to live in accordance with one’s values—even if those values are not widely held or accepted.\n\nThe books of post-Civil War writer Horatio Alger, in which impoverished but hardworking teenage boys rise to success through pluck, determination, and good fortune, came to personify realizing the dream.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nTerming the concept a \"dream\" also carries with it the notion that these ideals aren't necessarily what has played out in the lives of many actual Americans and those who hope to become Americans. The criticism that reality falls short of the American dream is at least as old as the idea itself. The spread of settlers into Native American lands, slavery, the original limitation of the right to vote to white male landowners, and a long list of other injustices and challenges have undermined the realization of the dream for many who live in the United States.\n\nAs income inequality has increased substantially since the 1970s, the American dream has begun to seem less attainable for those who aren't already affluent or born into affluence. According to U.S. Census family income data, real family income began to grow much more among the top income group than among other segments of American society.\n\nThese realities, however, do not diminish the luster of the American dream as an ideal and a beacon to all nations.\n\nHow to Measure the American Dream\n\nToday, homeownership is frequently cited as an example of attaining the American dream. It is a symbol of financial success and independence, and it means the ability to control one’s own dwelling place instead of being subject to the whims of a landlord.\n\nOwning a business and being one’s own boss also represents the American dream fulfillment. Entrepreneurship has always been important to the U.S. economy, too. From 1995 to 2021, small businesses created 17.3 million net jobs alone.\n\nIn addition, access to education and healthcare have been cited as elements of the dream.\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nIn her book \"Spreading the American Dream: American Economic and Cultural Expansion, 1890-1945,\" sociologist Emily S. Rosenberg identifies five components of the American dream that have shown up in countries around the world. These include the following:\n\nThe belief that other nations should replicate America's development;\n\nFaith in a free market economy;\n\nSupport for free trade agreements and foreign direct investment;\n\nPromotion of a free flow of information and culture; and\n\nAcceptance of government protection of private enterprise\n\nThe American dream was aided by a number of factors that gave the United States a competitive advantage over other countries. For starters, it is relatively isolated geographically, compared to many other countries, and enjoys a temperate climate. It has a culturally diverse population that businesses use to foster innovation in a global landscape. Abundant natural resources—including oil, arable land, and long coastlines—generate food and income for the country and its residents.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe concept of the American dream is still one of the most uniquely \"American\" ideals—the ultimate idea that any individual should be able to pursue their dreams and build the life they want if they put in the hard work."
