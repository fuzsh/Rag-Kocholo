        "text": "From portraying Elizabeth I to embodying the superhero villain Hela, Australian sensation Cate Blanchett is one of the most revered performers of her generation, with some of the most riveting turns in modern cinema.\n\nTo celebrate her birthday, Variety ranks her 15 best performances of her career (so far).\n\nBeloved by critics, audiences, and awards bodies, Blanchett has displayed a career aspiring actors dream about. From the beginning of her career, it was evident that we were witnessing one of cinema’s most gifted actresses. Starting in smaller, independent projects such as Cherie Nowlan’s “The Wedding Party” and Gillian Armstrong’s “Oscar and Lucinda,” it was her masterful turn in Shekhar Kapur’s “Elizabeth” that wowed the cinematic world, earning her the first of many Oscar nominations.\n\nAfter portraying another kind of queen, Katharine Hepburn, the Queen of the Oscars, in Martin Scorsese’s “The Aviator,” she won her first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. With more memorable and stunning performances that would garner nominations, such as her work in Richard Eyre’s “Notes on a Scandal,” Todd Haynes’ “I’m Not There,” and Kapur’s sequel “Elizabeth: The Golden Age,” she won an undeniable Oscar for Best Actress in Woody Allen’s “Blue Jasmine” in 2014. Her last two nominations as titular characters stand as some of her most beloved. The first was for the closeted lesbian in Todd Haynes’ love drama “Carol,” alongside an equally invigorating Rooney Mara as her secret beau. The other was as the fictional visceral conductor Lydia Tár in Todd Field’s psychological thriller “Tár.”\n\nWe haven’t even mentioned the Oscar nominations she was snubbed for, including “Bandits,” “Veronica Guerin,” and the two most notable, “The Talented Mr. Ripley” by Anthony Minghella and “Nightmare Alley” by Guillermo del Toro. Nonetheless, with a career that shows no signs of slowing down, this filmography will continue to expand (and get harder to rank).\n\nRead Variety‘s list of Blanchett’s 15 best film performances below, and watch the best scene from each selection.\n\nHonorable mentions: “Bandits” (2001); “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio” (2022); “The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou” (2004); “The Missing” (2003); “The Shipping News” (2001)"
