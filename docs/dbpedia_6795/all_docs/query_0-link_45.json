The process, however, is marred by numerous problems, including cost overruns and shoddy workmanship. Grantâ€™s character, a harried ad executive, discovers his dream home is more like a nightmare, all while having to deal with a hellish commute. The situation is further complicated by troubles at work and his suspicion that his wife is having an affair with his best friend (played by Melvyn Douglas).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia"
