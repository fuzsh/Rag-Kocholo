        "text": "Back in the ’90s, before we had streaming playlists, we had compilation CDs. One such compilation was “Jock Jams,” a collection of songs designed to rock arenas and stadiums.\n\nGary Glitter’s “Rock and Roll Part 2,” House of Pain’s “Jump Around,” Montell Jordan’s “This Is How We Do It,” Chumbawamba’s “Tubthumping” and multiple entries from the Village People all graced the collections.\n\nBeing a little late to the party, Creed’s “Higher” is not an official “Jock Jam,” but it would make the cut.\n\nIn fact, “Higher” is such a stadium rocker, it dredged up a band that was all but dead and buried: Creed.\n\n“Higher” was the breakout song for Creed, a Tallahassee band that would have been more appreciated — maybe — if it had arrived before Pearl Jam, not after.\n\nAs it is, Creed released its debut album “My Own Prison” in 1997, six years after Pearl Jam’s “Ten” and during a time when the Seattle band itself seemed to be growing bored with its sound. We had already heard from Stone Temple Pilots, Live, Seven Mary Three, Candlebox, Collective Soul and Nickelback.\n\nThe latter is one of the few bands of that era more disliked by critics than Creed, who, with its Christian perspective, wore its earnestness on both sleeves.\n\n“[T]hese God-fearing grunge babies sound falser than rape-inciting Limp Bizkit,” wrote rock critic Robert Christgau about Creed’s 1999 album “Human Clay.”\n\nA Hartford Courant review of “My Own Prison” noted, “Just as the Warrants and Slaughters of the world hung around long after their brand of music had gone to the grave, so will Creed. Let’s move on, folks.”\n\nCreed frontman Scott Stapp talked with Consequence in May about that critical reception. “I think the initial backlash, some of it was just part of being so big, so fast — eight straight number one singles. I mean, we were all over the radio. You couldn’t escape us. I think the initial narrative was completely created by kind of the elite, critical media, kind of the cool guy club, who liked bands that didn’t sell a lot of records.”\n\nThe negativity didn’t stop Creed from selling more than 20 million copies worldwide of its chart-topping second album “Human Clay,” and hitting the Top 10 singles charts with “Higher” and “With Arms Wide Open,” which also won a Grammy.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nTrouble followed the band though, as Stapp struggled with substance abuse issues and an undiagnosed bipolar disorder. A December 2002 show in Illinois was so bad that four concertgoers filed a lawsuit against Creed claiming that Stapp was too intoxicated to perform.\n\nAfter sitting out 2003, Creed broke up in 2004. During that same year, Stapp launched a solo career and guitarist Mark Tremonti and drummer Scott Phillips hooked up with former member Brian Marshall (bassist) and singer Myles Kennedy to form Alter Bridge.\n\nWith both of those ventures yielding underwhelming results, Creed reunited in 2009 for “Full Circle,” its first album in eight years. When they reconvened in late 2011 to work on a fifth album, nothing came of it, and the band again went on hiatus as members reverted back to their post-Creed projects and some new ones — again without much impact.\n\nStapp had started to publicly spiral by 2014, posting videos on Facebook about being a CIA agent tasked with killing Barack Obama. A 911 call his wife made got released and Stapp claimed he was living in a Holiday Inn. In 2015, Stapp announced in People magazine that he’d been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and seemed to be getting better, though there was no sign of a Creed reunion.\n\nStill, at some point something was probably going to bring Creed back to life. It turned out to be a pandemic and a baseball team.\n\n“Higher” was tapped as the soundtrack for a number of inspirational TikToks during COVID-19. And then during its 2023 underdog championship run, the Texas Rangers used “Higher” as its motivational anthem. Creed even made a surprise appearance at Game 3 of the Rangers-Astros playoff series to serenade the crowd. A few weeks later, after knocking off the Florida Marlins (for whom Stapp had recorded “Marlins Will Soar” in 2010), the Rangers went viral with a raucous locker-room celebration shouting out the song.\n\nSoon after, Kirk Cousins, then a Minnesota Vikings quarterback, began using it as his fight song. Creed and “Higher” were also central to a hilarious 2024 Super Bowl commercial with Patrick Stewart, Drew Barrymore, Tua Tagovailoa, Knuckles the Echidna, Arnold from “Hey Arnold!” and Peppa Pig.\n\nAll that sports love was the perfect push for the reunion tour idea the band was batting around.\n\nThings started off with the sold out “Summer of ’99” cruise, a four-night cruise to the Bahamas that was also a celebration of all things Creed and prominently featured the band’s performance at Woodstock in 1999 on TVs around the ship. The “Summer of ’99” tour soon followed.\n\nStapp, who expected 2024 to be a year promoting his new solo album, “Higher Power,” told Billboard: “I’m still trying to process it, to be honest with you.”\n\n“It’s so profound of a resurgence that it’s an anomaly. ... It’s just a lot to take in. It’s all positive stuff. And so now, it’s just making sure that we’re all in a good place, we can ride on this positivity, and give the fans what they want.”\n\nThe clear takeaway for careerist bands out there: Write yourselves a “Jock Jam.”"
