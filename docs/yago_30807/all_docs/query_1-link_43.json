        "text": "We’ve got another great year and again we go from highlight to at least one full episode. Even though I’m sorry that there is more trouble going on in Springfield this year, there’s still a lot of good and I have to say that this rates as a top Bauer BBQ. It’s the first Bauer BBQ post 9/11. With that in mind they both have some feel good happy and pretty hilarious stuff with the fantasies and some true soul searching talking about freedom. Manny aren’t in the greatest place as they are building to another major problem from them, but right now they seem to be in a great place. Bloss have gotten over their problem except that they still have to actually get psycho Tory arrested. Richard is in the hospital following a car crash and he will not survive. Josh and Reva have reunited once again and are about to embark on their most realistic set of martial problems ever which I find to be one of their best storylines. Rick is in desperate need of a heart transplant and worse is married to Mel. Beth is still dealing with the fallout from her latest round with DOD and amnesia and Bill is hoping the psychosis wins. Lizzie is in her last incarnation as cute little kid. Ed is back from his long absence in Africa thanks to Danny and Ed and Holly are back together. Phillip is starting his dalliance with Olivia that will spawn Emma, although it’s too bad because I think when all is said and done she really had a better relationship with Alan and that’s after he raped her by blackmailing her into sex. Harley and Gus are together.\n\nJuly 3, 2002 – Partial Episode\n\nThe night before the Bauer BBQ Danny and Michelle have miscommunications almost derail their best on screen anniversary celebration. Note some rising tensions between them. One of the first signs the Manny story was VERY slowly getting better again during the deep dark best forgotten amnesia year, was when amnesiac Michelle remembers this night.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE6G2sMFqYM\n\nJuly 4, 2002\n\nThe Bauer BBQ starts with a real nice Ed-Robbie moment. Raising a flag was often the start of the Bauer BBQ going way back to Papa Bauer. Rick had developed a cardiac infection which had permanently damaged his heart before it was detected. His heart is failing now. The great part of this year was the fantasies. Michael O’Leary has said Rick’s fantasy this year was one of the scenes fans mention to him most. Danny doesn’t want to work the grill because despite his grill on the balcony in San Cristobel, grilling is not one of his strengths. His 2001 attempt to man the grill created a wall of fire. Why didn’t they have Danny bar tend? I mean he’s a former professional, I’ll never understand. Once again Danny is wearing is terrific black Hawaiian shirt. I totally love it. These thankful moments are very meaning about where the characters are at that moment. Sadly they only include Manny’s but you can tell they have a little tension in their marriage at this point which will sadly eventually lead to another divorce.\n\nRichard was hurt in a car crash as he was rushing home from his new job as a high end car salesman. Richard had hid their money troubles (Richard had turned all his money over to the crown which now belongs to his half-brother) from Cassie and that he had gotten a job. It’s hard for Cassie because as you saw in the Bauer BBQ 2001 Richard had showed up and surprised her. Everyone can’t help, but remember. I really never really appreciated how great the character of Richard was until I had to deal with Jeffery O’Neil.\n\nThe current teen story has Lizzie crushing on Shayne is crushing on Marina. Marina and Shane will get back together.\n\nGreat little Manny bits behind Bill and Beth. First they are messing with each other’s food and then they scooping up Robbie to take him in for his name. Beth is dealing with the aftereffects of her latest being assumed dead with split personality amnesia. Olivia is married to Alan at this point, but Olivia and Phillip are fighting an attraction (inexplicable and lasting only long enough to cause a lot of trouble and create Emma). Phillip is in his typical wants to have his cake and eat it too mode and while he is happily reunited with Beth, it’s not enough — hence Olivia. In a totally stupid and implausible story while Bill was off canvas he ran into Beth’s alter Loreli and wasn’t at all freaked out by the fact she looked like Beth who he’d known as a friend of his parents his whole life and never thought it was worth mentioning to anybody. After Loreli was reintegrated back into Beth, she suddenly remembered Bill and that they’d had a hot affair (for a penniless amnesiac, she certainly got around, even more than Reva – poor Michelle had to stay in town and suffer the awful writing when she lost her memory). Olivia has gotten Beth’s diary and knows about the affair, Beth only partially remembers. Alan once again claimed he wouldn’t come to the BBQ and yet there he is. Bill is a future ex-husband of Olivia’s.\n\nRick is suffering from a virus which attacked and weakened his heart. He is in desperate need of a transplant to live. He isn’t paralyzed, but incredibly weak hence the wheelchair. He is currently married to lawyer/doctor Mel who won’t discover she has a personality until she’s paired with Cyrus in the last year a fact her family blames on Rick and not her.\n\nThere was a series of fantasies that day. The most well remembered is Rick’s, but the funniest is Olivia’s, Phillip is US President and Olivia’s First Lady fantasy. Sadly so far Olivia’s is the only one I’ve found.\n\nRick has a full Yankee Doodle Dandy musical sequence. Find it 14:00.\n\nPhillip as President of the United States full of errors because what does Olivia know about American politics, she’s a San Cristobelian. Find it 17:00. It shows once again Phillip is about to get involved with a woman who is only interested in HER version of him.\n\nBill’s fantasy is that Beth’s psychological issues push her around the bend and she dumps her family for him. Find it at 21:00.\n\nI really like it when they honor the history by having someone going through something Reva already did, to ask her for advice, like Beth does here. Things are righter with the world when Reva’s back in red and Beth is back in pink.\n\nReva was trying to decide whether to honor Richard’s last request and terminate his life support without involving Cassie. I like that Reva is the go to person for fellow amnesiacs in Springfield. Michelle also later gets her advice during her bought with amnesia.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

I found more. I now have three full episodes, scroll down for the links. Check out the original version of this post with a link to highlight clips only:\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/bauer-bbq-2001/\n\nThis is one of my favorite Bauer BBQs and actually it’s one of my favorite years in Springfield period. It’s just a great time period. We are just on the tail end of an umbrella story that had Edmund marry Beth and take the kids and Lillian down to San Cristobel, take over the throne (turns out Richard wasn’t legitimate, long story), and kidnap Cassie. Phillip was down with Richard helping with a coup. Harley’s pregnancy is actually part of the pay off of a storyline that when Abby left him, Harley realized Phillip had impregnated Beth and lied about it, Eleni had left Frank, and Selena had left Buzz they all got together and got drunk and Harley and Rick slept together. Harley got pregnant and while Phillip was divorcing Harley and had his attention focused on rescuing Beth and his kids and Harley’s kid Susan from Edmund’s influences, Harley and Rick hid it from him. We’re almost up to this point in our episode guide, basically as the last part of The Perfect Storm. They got Danny out of trouble with the mob and the immediate problem with FBI, but Gus Aitoro is committed to getting him. Michelle had destroyed the evidence May had against them. So Gus pressured Harley into becoming his assistant and pressured her into planting a bug in the Bauer living room. Gus also got Harley to get all of the Bauers out of the house and used the opportunity to get Danny’s home gun (he’d killed Carmen with his office gun) and to get a cartridge to plant to frame Danny. Danny will shortly go on trial. Josh and Reva split up over the revelation that Reva had been married to Richard when she was gone. Reva is also currently temporarily blinded. Josh married Olivia and Reva is dating Noah. Tony had broken up with Marah to keep her safe, but not understanding that she’s using Sam to make him jealous and Catalina is taking advantage of the situation, apparently not caring that he didn’t care enough about HER welfare to push her away. The funniest storyline right now requires you to swallow the fact that Buzz would be interested in Holly even though she was fairly directly responsible for Jenna’s death. When Billy got out of jail for shooting Roger Thorpe, Buzz Cooper stepped up and got him probation/work release. They fought a friendly competition for Holly’s affection that I think had more to do with beating each other than Holly. Holly took it mostly in that spirit and will dump them both in a nanosecond as soon as Ed comes back to town and gives her a second look.\n\nFind the prep from the day before in the highlight clip. Tony is upset because he thinks they should be doing something for the case prep.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJQPfFSRF4I (Watch night before prep first two minutes, after that switch to full episodes at the bottom.)\n\nDanny: “You’re going to upset, Michelle.”\n\nTony: “She’ll be more upset when you go to jail for murder.”\n\nDanny: “Yes she is. So the least I can do right now is to give her every bit of happiness and normalcy that I can manage. Do you understand?”\n\nJuly 4, 2001\n\n2001 provides one of the most detailed prep periods. I just love Rick as general of the BBQ and they could have done it every year. I don’t know why they never had Danny behind the bar at the BBQ. He does such a good job when he works at Millennium. I just love his speech about the drinks he makes when they hire him. I think it’s a total waste of talent and obviously between this and burning the money in San Cristobel it just shows that as much as I love him, the boy can’t grill. I love his BLACK Hawaiian shirt. I wish he’d worn it to the last one, I didn’t really care for his outfit for Bauer BBQ 2009, although once I realized his shorts matched Robbie’s it grew on me. I could just see Robbie picking them out to be like his Dad. Happy sigh!\n\nI would have liked to see Danny in the apron and THE HAT. I thought it was a bit much to say Robbie wouldn’t wear the hat either. I greatly look forward to the day when Robbie wears the hat. The line about have your own son was because Harley was coming in (apparently via the patio doors far away from any parking area) and she was pregnant with Rick’s son Jude Bauer.\n\nBeth had believed in the fairytale of Edmund after she had lost Phillip to Harley. Beth believed in Edmund’s story until she discovered he’d locked Cassie in a tower. He really didn’t mean her THAT much harm, but he got sick himself and Cassie was stuck without food and water and almost died. When Beth discovered her rather than letting Beth leave him and tell people he locked her in. Beth freaked broke out a window and fell that’s why she was in the hospital. Richard was a cool guy. Jeffery was a complete loser in comparison.\n\nReva was temporarily blinded, basically for the sake of the story of when her sight came back. For once Reva is doing a story Michelle already did and not the other way around. That’s kind of late for the party to be starting normally people arrive around noon, but they just seem to be arriving and it’s dark out. Josh and Olivia were still married and he’d brought her into Lewis Construction and they had put in a bid for a MAJOR construction project in San Cristobel. Olivia’s government contracts were signed by Edmund with Richard coming back as elected President the contracts were in question.\n\nTony and Ray are Danny’s cousins, so now pulled in to helping with the BBQ. Danny is currently being prosecuted for his mother’s death (which he thinks he did in defense of life but covered it up – Carmen really is still alive and the body they pull out of the lake isn’t hers). FBI Agent Gus Aitoro, who is behind the prosecution, is trying to get Danny because he holds Danny’s father responsible for his own father’s death and Gus intends to get revenge on Danny. (Apparently in all that lawyer learning he got, he skipped the bit in the Constitution about the no contamination of the blood clause – meaning that children can’t be punished for their parent’s crimes.) Gus is currently working up to romancing Harley who is pregnant with Rick’s child Jude.\n\nI love Rick’s little show at the beginning of the clip. They refer back to both Rick’s wearing the hat and Danny hating the hat and apron when Manny return at Bauer BBQ 2009. Phillip has just returned from San Cristobel where he was trying to rescue Beth and his children and Harley’s daughter Susan. I think Harley is referring to when Phillip leads a commando style raid to rescue Beth from Edmund. As their marriage broke up, (I will spare Pharley fans my analysis about why it never stood a chance to begin with) in part over Phillip’s constant efforts to protect Beth, this latest rescue went over like a lead balloon with Harley, even though her own daughter was involved. She is currently pregnant with Rick’s child, the future Jude Bauer, from a drunken one night stand.\n\nFire breaks out.\n\nRay: “Anyone for well done?”\n\nDanny: “I’m just getting the hang of it.”\n\nRick: “We only have so much chicken here. You are now in charge of coleslaw and pouring the iced tea.”\n\nThat was a great couple communication when with a couple of significant looks, Michelle tells Danny that Rick is the father of Harley’s baby.\n\nRick to Tony: “Take over here and keep Danny away from the BBQ. I don’t want him blowing up the house.”\n\nSeriously Harley, I know you think you’ve done the right thing, but honestly you’re betraying some of your best friends. I don’t blame Tony and Danny from being mad at her. Harley still gets Tony to act like her trying to put his cousin on death row is no big deal.\n\nHarley: “Feed me. I’m hungry.”\n\nTony: “How about this one, it’s fried to a crisp like you’re trying to do to my cousin.”\n\nBlake and her twin sons Jason and Kevin come running in with water pistols and then Ross carries in Clarissa. At this point Blake had published her 2nd book. (Her first book was the romance she imagined between Ross and Holly while she was pregnant with Clarissa and hiding from Ross at the Bauer BBQ.) She had decided to use Selena Davis’s true life story of a romance with Miguel Santos (which produced a never seen on screen Miguel Santos, Jr.) as the basis of this second book. (When she could have used Manny? Or Jezz? Or Bloss or even Blen? Why Selena?) However, Blake’s failure to disguise the people involved adequately led to either Abuela or Carmen putting a hit out on Selena. Selena barely made it out of town in time, leaving Buzz heartbroken and beaten by the goons that came after her. Blake is thinking that stirring up the past led to Danny being on the murder charge, hence the apology.\n\nSo family stories get passed down. Tony has been told the hot tub was covered because “some kid almost drowned.” Marah remembers the incident involved Kevin Marler, but being a Springfielder utterly dismisses it. So someone almost died, they’d have come back! LOL. Sam is like I’m getting all the making out I can get from this bad deal as Marah tries to make Tony jealous, not knowing he’d broken up with her to protect her. Reva is currently dating Noah (a San Cristobel combination doctor and spy) basically to keep from getting bored when Josh refused to heel back from Olivia fast enough. The best thing about them was their couple code which was Nova – one of the best ever. Noah was down in San Cristobel because he was helping Richard over throw Edmund and rescue Cassie. Noah, not being an idiot, could tell sometimes that Reva just wasn’t that into him. Alan was dating Claire Ramsey at the time and it was too bad that he broke up with her because they were actually a pretty cool couple. So glad that Phillip is going to take Lizzie and James to the BBQ. Richard shows up to surprise Cassie at the BBQ. This is a very prominent Rassie moment. That’s really sweet how both Tammy and RJ both totally adopted Richard as their dad.\n\nJuly 5, 2001\n\nPhillip didn’t know Harley was pregnant. Nice reminder that Phillip saw Michelle as almost a little sister. I love how familiar Danny is with the hospital and its staff, it just goes to show that he spends a lot of off camera time there lunching with Rick, dropping off Michelle, etc. I just think it’s nice. Danny: “No it’s just some friend of Rick’s from the hospital.”\n\nThis is my favorite haircut on Danny. It’s just gorgeous and it’s shown to full effect during his conversation with Tony which does a nice job of showing of their positive relationship. Beth had been a bit blind, but Edmund did encourage her to be more of an equal partner than any of her other boyfriends/husbands. He just lied…a lot and plotted some.\n\nConsidering Phillip got the woman Rick loved/was married to twice before, I don’t think he has a lot of moral high ground to stand on here. This is one of the most mature scenes ever for Beth. I like her taking responsibility. Oh, Michelle is carrying around Robbie behind Jolivia, he’s so cute!\n\nRichard: “Only a natural catastrophe could stop this project.” I laughed too because that’s exactly what stops it, an earthquake. The writers must have known already. 🙂\n\nHarley is actually wrong here. Harley basically hates Beth because she wanted to erase her very existence from Phillip’s life and she wouldn’t disappear. Harley reads as a stronger character than Beth, but she made just as many stupid repeated mistakes. And considering that Harley hasn’t been through a tenth of what Beth was I don’t think it’s fair to compare them.\n\nReva watches the fireworks with Josh and actually sees sparks of light.\n\nThis a great jalapeno fight between Buzz and Billy over Holly. Blake apologizes to Danny for the trouble her book caused. Danny very kindly tells her there’s no need and just shows what great step-siblings-in-law they will be.\n\nGus has no right to come to Bauer BBQ, but he is starting to chase after Harley, he will ultimately catch her, and he’s trying to make Danny miserable so he comes. Really Gus is lucky Danny isn’t the man Gus thinks he is or Gus would be in the lake by now. Lucky for Danny he isn’t though because later Gus does make some amends for faking evidence against Danny etc., by saving his life from the warehouse fire and they grow to have a more friendly, although still very prickly relationship. Gus should really give up the quips, he’s no Ben Warren. Currently Gus is making up to Blake hoping to get more information from Selena and find out who Blake’s source was which nobody will tell him although most of the people we know in town either know or could guess. Not having learned her lesson with Ben Warren, Blake is heavily flirting back to him trying to get information out of him. Ultimately she will turn up the evidence that shows who Gus really is (at least who he thinks he is at this point) and the lengths he will go to try to destroy Danny. BOO GUS! HISSSSS! At this point Bloss and Manny are really each other’s closest couple friends, although not as close as Dresse and Manny had been. Blake and Michelle share the bond that they were once and future step-sisters and I wish the show had played that up more rather than playing Blake as a Thorpe all the time. She was Bauer to in a very real way although her efforts to help Manny get out of legal trouble (which she actually does a couple of times) are as close as they get to playing Blake and Michelle as sisters.\n\nNot a good idea, Frank? How about highly illegal? Once someone who is an occupant of a house asks you to leave you are supposed unless you are also an occupant which Gus wasn’t.\n\nFinally, having survived Selena breaking his heart (I really think he was mostly with Selena to keep himself from dwelling on Jenna being gone and to give her full credit Selena, she was very good with his kids), Buzz was ready to move on to Holly. While Buzz really should have had issues with Holly who’s actions had helped bring about Jenna’s death, look around the canvas and there aren’t a lot of more tenable options. They move into a triangle with Buzz-Holly-Billy. Buzz and Billy were friends because when Billy was released from prison from trying to kill Roger Thorpe, Buzz was supportive and gave Billy a job. They had formed a friendship and I think their love of competing with each other played more into the romance than anything about Holly which is good because she will dump them both flat the SPLIT SECOND Ed returns to town. However, at this point they are still fighting over her. Billy had doctored up a bowl of chili to make it superhot to give to Buzz to keep him away from Holly. Buzz put it down and Gus picked it up and took a huge spoonful. Billy is the only one who understands Gus’s reaction and that’s why he’s laughing his head off.\n\nJuly 6, 2001\n\nI think Phillip has a point about the “Cooper” attitude. Buzz was always terrible to Phillip, which considering Buzz’s history took a lot of gall. Michelle says the kids are watching cartoons in the den. Nice the rarely seen den got a shout out. This is the start of Harley’s Phillip is evil incarnate downslide. I think Phillip has a reason to be upset and I don’t think it was arrogant for Phillip to think that the only one to get Harley pregnant while they were still married was him. Harley should have taken it as complement. Rick is also right Harley spends a lot of time cutting Rick out of Jude’s life which sucks considering how long Rick longed for a kid of his own to raise. Actually I think Buzz gets so mad because Phillip is exactly right about what Buzz is doing.\n\nI hate the way the Coopers keep trying to take over the BBQ. Buzz to Blake: “Don’t confuse me with facts.”\n\nThis is a nice Ross-Phillip conversation. Ross had his faults, but he was always a great mentor to Phillip. Oh, point Ross, “Just the way you told your wife you had a kid coming with Beth.” Ross to Rick: “[Phillip] is in run silent, run deep mode, you know how he gets.\n\nRick’s right that he did betray Phillip, but again they have a two for one score here.\n\nWith moves like these Sam is using on Marah I don’t know why he never really had a love interest of his own. Susan/Daisy had the best chemistry with him and she left the show a couple of months in. But Sam just never seemed to get Marah just wasn’t into him. Really it wasn’t Noah’s place to tell Reva’s kids about their engagement. Really nice Danny-Rick conversation at the end.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

I’m especially confused if some of the music is actually part of the episode (badly out of balance) or if it is playing somewhere else in this person’s house. But as it’s the only version I’ve found so far I’m going to go ahead and include it. There are also some commercials.\n\nWhat we’ve got is the episode from July 6, 1992. Depending on how much time you have you might want to revisit the Great Springfield Blackout which occurred immediately before this. I really want to include this year because looking back at this time, this was a pretty wonderful period for the soap. Lots of great story and they haven’t yet driven off the bridge that was Maureen’s death.\n\nBlackout (Great Springfield Blackout of 1992):\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2010/05/05/springfield-blackout-of-1992\n\nWe are just coming out of a big umbrella story which involved most of the cast being trapped in various locations around town without power with people they shouldn’t be (for example, young Michelle Bauer was trapped in an elevator with then jewel thief Jenna Bradshaw and Lillian Raines was with Ed Bauer in the parking garage talking to him about her cancer and they kissed). Bridget is threatening Michelle because she thinks she caused it (she did with her hairdryer) and is afraid Michelle will fink her out and she’ll get in trouble. They were also coming off a big story climax, last July 4th Alex figuratively roasted Roger alive after he found out he’d embezzled from her and more than that had an affair with Mindy Lewis. This kicked off an intense feud between the two women, long after Mindy wished she’d never seen Roger Thorpe. The fighting got worse when they were once again fighting over a man a different way, Nick McHenry who Alex was convinced was her son and who Mindy wanted to marry. Alex blackmailed Roger into helping her and without going into details, Nick was derailed in his efforts to get home in time for the wedding by Roger’s scheme and so when he didn’t show. Mindy believed Alex when she told her that Alex had told Nick everything Mindy had done and he’d left her at the altar deliberately because he chose Alex over her. Devastated Mindy left town (to accommodate a recast) at the end of the Great Springfield Blackout, the day before. Nick and Lujack’s father, Alex’s one-time husband, concert pianist Eric Luvonaczek is back in town. Lillian and Ed have only kissed so far, but still feel guilty (as they both should). We’ve also just barely passed the initial Mallet and Harley falling in love story which was terrific and now they are working together at the police department. Although we just saw the first glimpse of the good side of Jenna when she stayed and took care of Michelle instead of making good her escape with the jewels from Mindy’s non-wedding, but she’s definitely still a bad girl too. Her life changed forever when Roger Thorpe rescued her from the police chasing her the night of the blackout and she hasn’t yet learned that he’s just using her in anger and pain the way Alex claimed he used Alex (which he really didn’t, he went into the marriage with Alex honestly, he just couldn’t stomach what she expected him to do, basically let her emasculate him completely). The other big story at this time was Frank-Eleni-Alan-Michael triangle which just saw Frank and Alan-Michael working together to rescue Eleni who was trapped in the Wheels and Meals Diner freezer during the Blackout.\n\nJuly 6, 1992\n\nHarley was just recently made a copy and is working with her former instructor A.C. Mallet. The initial Mallet-Harley falling in love storyline where they butted heads in the classroom at the police academy and then the force and it morphed into love starting with fantasies about someone whose face you couldn’t see were amazing. The jewel thief they are talking about is Jenna Bradshaw and in case you haven’t seen it, here is Jenna and Michelle in the elevator, they are tightly bonded after this. Also in linked to in the post above. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmMM4W6DCL4 Mindy disappeared from her wedding with Nick when he didn’t show in time. Alex had lied to her that Nick knew Mindy had kept the fact he and Alex were really mother and son after all away from him and that Nick wanted nothing more to do with her. The truth was that Nick didn’t want anything to do with ALEX, but this misunderstanding came at the end of Kimberly Simms run and they used it as an excuse to get her out of town for awhile while they got us set for a new Mindy.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcgC6cdfk9c (Part 1)\n\nJulie was awful, don’t waste your time with her, Michelle. Lillian is jumpy because while Maureen was desperately trying to get back to her husband and daughter, Ed was kissing Lillian in the dark. They are gathering in a big rambling house on the outskirts of town where Nick and Mindy were living at the time. Tangy Hill had lived there previously. Nick has it wrong, Mindy had known and changed it to protect him from contact with Alex. The man talking with Alex is the famous pianist, Eric Luvonaczek, who Alex had loved and eloped with as a young girl. He was a very weak man and in desperation sold one of their twins (Nick McHenry) to a desperate American couple in Paris and took money from Brandon (Alex and Alan’s father) to keep the other twin Lujack from her. Alex hadn’t known there were twins being unconscious during and after birth.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x7YO-vOqeE (Part 2)\n\nNadine isn’t really being nice. She’s desperate to hold on to Billy and his money, even though she knows he loves Vanessa. I think she does genuinely like Little Billy as much as its possible for her like anyone else (she tends to be incredibly self-centered), but that wasn’t why she stopped by. Did Ed just admit he didn’t spend as much time with Rick as he should have while Rick was growing up? I don’t know anyone who liked Mallet’s little sister Julie. So I guess even with Roger’s help, Harley did get Jenna arrested this is her take down, but I can’t enjoy it because if the sides are chosen between Jenna and Harley, I’m taking Jenna even if Harley is in the right this time. Until a couple of days ago Jenna thought she was dating Mallet, but he was just using her as part of the entrapment case.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqdnbudqFCU (Part 3)\n\nDavid Grant was in deep trouble and as you can see deep attitude when he first came to town. He’d been convicted of manslaughter, taking the fall for Gilly who had really done it. Mindy had discovered that Alex was right that Nick was her kid, but knowing how much Nick loved his parents and the amount of destruction Alex could do, Mindy really did switch the results to that Nick thought he wasn’t Alex’s son. The negative test results never shook Alex’s conviction, mostly because she SO wanted it to be true.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE7ggYkIswk (Part 4)\n\nBridget threatens Michelle if she spills that Bridget and her power overuse triggered the Blackout. Billy quite reasonably asked Lillian if she could contact Beth and Phillip and see if Mindy turned to them in her time of trouble. With Hart gone, Julie turns to Dylan. Dylan has claustrophobia over an incident surround his adoptive mother’s death and so freaked out as they were trapped in an elevator. Dylan: “Cross Creek…that’s our family’s retreat outside of Tulsa” like he’d been going there his whole life. 🙂 Mallet and Mindy were very good friends, but platonic which worked well for them.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Wf5IeETG4 (Part 5)\n\nFletcher was always on Alex’s side even when they weren’t together, he just wouldn’t seriously commit to her and expected her to be fine with that. Fletcher were friends with Nick’s adoptive parents. Fletcher just said a soap truism: “They made a mistake and they were afraid they’d lose you if you found out….people do dump things when they are scared and in love.” Lillian and Alex have a really nice talk although I don’t understand why they are sharing confidences. Lillian to Alex: “I don’t want you to fight so much you lose him.”\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXrODqu5AXs (Part 6)\n\nHarley shows up in her new cop uniform at the Bauer BBQ. Harley’s hair is just gorgeous in this whole episode. Although that was framed as a dig at Lillian for having kissed Ed, I don’t know what Alex means by there’s right and there’s wrong, she’s certainly never applied that philosophy to any of her own actions.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERSvQAPYuqk (Part 7)\n\nClosing Credits\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Dw7JlBc1Y\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

I will say that I just gave Michelle my mother’s new car because loves it and I thought Michelle would too. It’s a 2014 Jeep Cherokee. Also, in making sure we have the kids at the right ages, the then Marcy Rylan had son Jackson, who should get credit for playing the baby bump that was H.B. Lewis IV, on Oct. 21, 2009. Since she only revealed her pregnancy in the flash forward set in September 2010, Little Billy the Fourth should have been born at least approximately Oct. 21, 2010 which would make him 4 now and a year older than Dani Santos. Sarah Randall was born in 2006 and she is 8 this year.\n\nBauer BBQ 2014 by Robansuefarm Chapter 2\n\nIt was a short drive over to the Bauer House on Skyline Drive and still early. Michelle pulled up into the parking area between the house and the garage apartment and said briskly, “OK everybody out!” Robbie grabbed a package out of the back and took off to carry it into his old room. Michelle let Hope dance ahead, and took on her first load with Dani riding her hip and the diaper bag draped over her shoulder messenger bag style. Michelle had pushed the button to make the back of the Cherokee close, but before it could close all the way, suddenly Bill caught it and sent it up again.\n\n“Woah there Bauer, looks like you still have a lot to carry in, why don’t you load me up?”\n\n“Well, Lewis, you always do best as a beast of burden.\n\n“Hardy, har, har. That’s nice talk to someone who got up early to help you on his day off with his wife and infant son,” gesturing behind him as Lizzie came bearing down on them a four year old Little Billy IV pulling her along.\n\n“I’d hardly call Little Billy an infant any more, next thing you know he’ll be breaking hearts just like his Daddy and ‘borrowing’ the car without asking.”\n\n“You first, Bauer. Robbie’s 18 by now isn’t he?”\n\n“He’s 13 as you very well know. You were at his birthday party.”\n\n“AND if Little Billy’s breaking a heart it will probably be with that little girl of yours.”\n\nLittle Billy ran up and began yanking on Dani trying to get her down. “We want to play, Michelle. Dani down!”\n\nBilly quirked her a smile, and said “Yeah, Michelle we want to play.”\n\n“OK, OK I know when I’m out numbered.”\n\nShe put Dani down and Little Billy grabbed her hand and they took off, a short haired blond and light brown ringlets bouncing away across the parking area and into the kitchen door of the Bauer House.\n\nLizzie had been about a step behind her son and she threw Michelle a quick “Happy Fourth of July” and kissed the corner of Bill’s mouth as she rushed by. “I’ll keep an eye on them.”\n\n“Here you go. Let’s really load you down and we’ll get all this stuff in the house. I already brought a load over last night. I’ll have to pull the apple pies out of the freezer and rewarm them in the oven, but I think we can get most of this in one load.”\n\nBill readjusted the load in his arms, “I don’t think anybody will mind Bert’s recipe apple pies aren’t fresh this year. Everybody knows you’ve had a lot going on, speaking of which do you want me to grab that?” Bill gestured with his head toward the last two bags in the rear of the Cherokee.\n\n“No, I”m making a special trip with those, keep your dirty mitts off them….It was really nice of you guys to come early to help with set up, you did last year, too.”\n\n“Well, you’ve showed up with the whole family early every Thanksgiving since Lizzie and I started our new family tradition, it’s give and take, help when you can. That’s just the Springfield way.”\n\n“Here’s some help then, see if you manage to remember your anniversary without Lizzie having to prompt you this year, it’s just 10 days after the BBQ.”\n\nBill, a little put out, “Of course I’ll remember my anniversary.”\n\n“You put the wrong date on your wedding invitations.”\n\nBill groaned. “Won’t you and Santos, ever let me forget THAT?”\n\nMichelle paused to think for a moment, before shoulder bumping her friend and walking into the house with him. “Nope, I don’t think, we…at least I…will.”\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

We also get some nice Michelle stuff in this. Strangely once again it’s just Michelle and Ben at the Bauer BBQ and Little Billy isn’t in sight. We learn that Michelle went through a horse phase as many young girls do (and it makes that Laurel Falls dream wedding story that included a white horse seem more possible). Ultimately Bridget’s actions to try to win Hart end up having long term consequences and the sudden death of Maureen ends up maturing Bridget quickly into someone, who might still be a little wild, but is someone we know and love. This isn’t that Bridget. This Bridget is Maureen’s niece who was dropped on Maureen and Ed because her own parents couldn’t control her, she is still a wildcat that needs taming. She influences Kat and to some extent Michelle for the worse. That frizzy crimping in hair wasn’t rebellion though, it was right in style in 1991. Eleni and Dylan Lewis are in the middle of their short period of dating and Bridget is trying to get Dylan to notice her. She will shortly move on to Hart, but ultimately returns to Bridget who was always her best friend and finally gets the crack over the head with a slate he needed to figure out he wanted more. Hart is also in Blake’s sights for a very different reason. Blake “Apple of Her Daddy’s Eye” Chrissy Thorpe does not take kindly to no longer being her father’s only child and that the new child is male and apparently faultless doesn’t help. Alex is about to blow Roger out of the water with her knowledge that Roger and Mindy had a long term affair (Roger seemed to actually care about Alex in the beginning, but being with her and her refusal to grant him real power led him to feel emasculated and Mindy – who knows why – offered herself up as a hero worshiping young thing just when his ego needed it most.) Alex will get her first pound of flesh that very night.\n\nDay 1\n\nVanessa is 100% right, she and Billy do always belong together. This year they are making Bert Bauer’s potato salad. Maureen tells Bridget: “You have to put in sauteed shallots and fresh dill and then you fold it over very slowly from the bottom.” So we won’t get to see Rick this year. 😦 That’s sad to just get a phone call, but this must be when he was exiled to Chicago (Michael O’Leary having chosen to leave the show) and basically going into a long term sulk that will include a renewal of his drug addiction and his marriage to Annie Dutton. Alexandra has finally found about Roger’s duplicitous actions with both Mindy and her company and will really nail Roger at this dinner. I really think this Blake and this Hart had the best sibling relationship. Blake has always been the apple of her father’s eye, so finding out he had a male heir who hadn’t made as many mistakes as she had was a big shock to her. She reacted some better than Vanessa in similar circumstances, but it was still hard on her and she is still at the point of taking it out on Hart that he exists. Blake is right. Hart doesn’t know much about women in general or Alex. Kat and Bridget were good friends, but Kat really hated Gilly at this point. Dylan and Bridget was a great circular story. She started up wanting Dylan and in the end Dylan realized what he wanted was her, sadly Hart proved a long diversion in the middle. This is a nice bit about young horse crazy (maybe Hart crushing) Michelle. A nice friendship scene between Maureen and Vanessa, too. Eleni briefly dated Dylan, but it really didn’t stick with either one. Little Billy isn’t there, once again it’s just Michelle and Ben. Michelle got an A on a history paper about the Declaration of Independence. Mallet was beat up and Frank being his best friend wants to get the guys who did it. Holly is dating Dr. Daniel St. John who will ultimately be proven to be a crook.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwItLqJibpQ (Day1)\n\nDay 2 – Fourth of July Night\n\nTwo fireworks shows are prepping as the Fourth of July continues. Some of the town gathers in the park with Dylan and Eleni to watch the real thing and others hang out to watch in the Bauer yard. Others are gathered at Alex’s request as the Lakeland Country Club. I normally love pink walls, but thank God they repainted them. This looks terrible. I think Roger did love Alex as much as he could love a woman who wasn’t Holly. I think this is as curly and fluffy as Alex’s hair ever was. Alex: “It was only immoral, not illegal or so I was convinced.” Then “No charges were filed, Roger how many times has that phrase been linked to your name.” On the other hand I think the country club patio looks the best it has. Sherry Stringfield’s version of Blake liked to swim in the Lakeland Country Club Pool….sometimes naked. At this point Blake and Frank would have made a lot more sense than they did at the end. A.C. Mallet, who was Frank’s best friend and partner at the time (trying to fill the Phillip-Rick relationship hole in the canvas) is in the hospital having taken a terrible beating. One of Dylan’s problems was that he was Dyslexic and had trouble reading. The name Eleni is struggling over is John Phillip Sousa THE most famous musician of the 19th century who singularly invented patriotic marching band music. Eleni was an illegal immigrant from Greece who came over to be Frank’s arranged bride, he objected over the concept, although he later fell for the girl. So Eleni dated Dylan and later Alan-Michael. The actress was actually Greek-American and she heard from many compatriots who insisted she keep things accurate including her accent which was not her real one. Very nice real fireworks film. Alex nailed Roger in front of everybody. Frank and Blake continued to bond. Mindy is wearing a truly beautiful formal pantsuit. Bridget launches her campaign to get Dylan away from Eleni, but things don’t go her way. Nice Lillian in charge scene, but I don’t remember why Mallet is beat up or why Roger is on crutches. Mallet’s PI office was in the same building as Mindy’s fashion design loft. Almost by accident they became good friends and he helped her cover up her affair with Roger. Holly’s hair is really pretty. Daniel St. John: “I am fed up. I’ve had it….You knew it had to do with Roger right….You hoped it would be everything it turned out to be and you’re not even happy with that…..I thought that you hated him that this man had fouled your life up and you wanted him out of it.” No, St. John you shouldn’t have intervened. As twisted as it is, Holly is only really Holly when she’s with Roger and it isn’t like St. John turns out any better in the end with less excuse. Roger always wanted all those “props” and honestly I don’t think Alex did. Alex was willing to walk away from everything to elope and really the only time she really wanted that billy club was when she was extracting what she saw as justified revenge (others might differ) or when she’d gotten herself in a jam. Otherwise I don’t think she cared about the wealth. I think Roger really did like Alan-Michael, just not enough to change his plans for his sake. He would later tell Blake what a great husband Alan-Michael was to her and that he didn’t know if she’d ever find another as good. Maureen and Roger’s friendship was a touchstone on the show and it was a constant source of tension between Ed and Maureen since Ed utterly hated him. Bridget: “Don’t look a gift girl in the mouth.” Dylan actually accurately predicted the next few years of Bridget’s life with his advice and warning, but the undercurrent of desire and attraction between them was there ,too. The last two minutes are the worst for Roger and really that’s what Maureen should have been upset about, Roger kind of deserved the rest, but you could call the guy on crutches a taxi when you were in the middle of nowhere.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJovpyc4mEg (Day 2)\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.
