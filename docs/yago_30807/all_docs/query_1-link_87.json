        "text": "Here’s my latest update on creating a list of couple code aka smoosh names aka the names people create for couples by combing their names. For example Manny is Michelle Bauer Santos and Danny Santos and Marony is Marah Lewis and Tony Santos. I’ve posted the list from other soaps before, but I’ve been trying to post quarterly updates to help get suggestions who I’ve missed. I’ve added more since last time, but please check for your favorites (or even the not so favorite couples you can remember). I’m a long way from having all of them for all soaps here. I think I have finally collected most of the Guiding Light couple codes, but I’m adding those below and am now branching out to collect other soaps. The shows and the names are listed in alphabetical order. All couples are eligible to be included if they are on a daytime soap opera and have a commonly used nickname or code. I threw a few primetime ones on at the bottom too, just for fun. This list is by no means complete at this point, but I found with my work with the Guiding Light list that people tend to respond more after they see what you have.\n\nI also have reserved a spot on the the list for anyone with a nickname that might be confused with a couple code. For example, on the Guiding Light list I’ve included Cleva for Clone Reva. So here are the couples whose name I’ve remember or had suggested to me so far.

This blog is an effort to make it easy to find Guiding Light and especially Manny online. Check back here for her blog, find fanfic previews and fake WSPR newscasts on her YouTube, find podcasts that look back to old shows and audios of her fanfics on Blog Talk Radio, and finally follow her on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nWhat You Need to Know\n\nPhillip Spaulding plays a very important if minor role in the Manny story. Although we have seen Philip intersect with the story before, this period is when we see Phillip connect with Manny the most. So who is Phillip?\n\nPhillip And….\n\nPhillip Spaulding is one of the keystone characters of Guiding Light history. His introduction in the late 1970s lead to a long and complicated parentage story that not only looked at specifics, but also asked questions about what it really means to be a parent, should being adopted matter, what decisions really are best for the child and which ones are just best for you. (It also kicked off a reunion for Justin and Jackie Marler – his bioparents – whose chemistry and on screen appeal glossed over a pretty awful backstory. – Seriously now I’ve read up on them why did I love them so much again?)\n\nPhillip and… is important because Phillip was first and foremost about his relationships with other characters on the show. That’s how he drove story and provided throughlines for many other characters. His return in the last year of the show completely turned around and regenerated a show that had completely lost its way. So most of what you need to know about Phillip starts out Phillip and…..\n\nAnd Rick Bauer\n\nAfter the cancellation announcement a lot of articles came out (mostly ones where they had talked to Kim Zimmer) that called Jeva (Josh Lewis and Reva Shayne) the flagship couple of the show. I don’t think they were. They were central, but the “couple” who defined the show from the late 1970s through the end of the show were best friends Phillip Spaulding and Rick Bauer. They are what drove story, not just their own, but other people’s.\n\nPhillip and Rick became best friends as teenagers attending the same high schools and living next door to each other (most of the time). Even though their relationship was often tested (Phillip impregnated Rick’s wife or fiance twice and Rick did it to Phillip once), they remained best friends. Even after Phillip went nuts and kidnapped Rick’s kid (it’s a long story), Rick was willing to help Phillip get out of a mental hospital when he got better.\n\nThe Phillip/Rick connection tied families together. The relationship between the Spauldings and the Bauers was a ridgepole across the canvas. Fans valued this connection and they were so vocal about it that for a time when both actors/characters were off canvas the show that the attempted to create a lite version with Frank Cooper and A.C. Mallet.\n\nIn terms of the Manny story, Rick is of course Michelle’s older brother and Phillip was his sounding board through all of his concern about her relationship with Danny. In fact, it was Phillip’s idea that Rick have Michelle committed to try to keep them apart.\n\nAnd the Four Musketeers\n\nNot long after Rick and Phillip started attending Springfield High School (they’d been in boarding school before) that they befriended first Mindy Lewis and then Beth Raines, forming a group known as the Four Musketeers. They were a rectangle that changed partners several times and those relationships drove story from the early 1980s through the end of the show. (It wasn’t a coincidence that their high school reunion was featured in the last year.) In fact the grouping was so successful that the show tried to copy it a few times. The most successful of their attempts brought in an aged Alan-Michael Spaulding, and introduced Vanessa and Ross’ daughter Dinah Marler and Harley Cooper. (Plus Cam, but Cam was pretty irrelevant and boring until he landed on 90120.)\n\nThe connection to the Manny story is TPTB were clearly aiming for another run at this with the younger set slightly before Manny blew up their plans. They were gearing up for another go with Michelle, Bill Lewis, Drew Jacobs, and Jesse Blue when Danny came into town and blew up that storyline.\n\nAnd Beth Raines\n\nRick and Phillip had been best friends for years when a new girl moved to town, Mindy Lewis. Soon after, thanks to Mindy and Beth sharing a hospital room, they met Beth Raines and became a foursome. Although other people distracted Phillip and Beth, ever since high school Beth and Phillip had a bond that none of the other people they were involved with ever really understood. Although most of Phillip’s other exes would say that their relationships with Phillip didn’t work out because he always felt an inexplicable need to rescue Beth and she played into it, I don’t think that’s true. I don’t think Beth was a weak victim even if Phillip did periodically rescue her and tried to other times – which often ended in disasters and once even a real, if small, war. Frankly, Beth had been through a lot more than any other woman on the show — with the possible exception of Reva — and it was amazing she was even functioning. Yes, she got into bad situations and expected Phillip, Rick, and Mindy to help get her out, but the aid was mutual and she helped them out when needed to.\n\nWhat it mostly came down to was that Beth wanted someone romantic who would make her feel safe and sometimes with his strand of instability in his make-up Phillip couldn’t always give her that and Phillip — having been raised with Spaulding traditional values — always thought he should be able to have both Beth and the latest flavor of the month. When the show ends they have gotten married again and I think that’s really where they belonged, where they were happiest. I hope they both finally figured it out too. Even before that happened anyone Phillip was involved with needed to understand, Beth doesn’t go away. Even when Phillip and Beth weren’t romantically connected there was an incredibly strong bond between them.\n\nAnd Alan Spaulding\n\nPhillip was raised by Alan Spaulding not finding out until he was 18 that he was adopted. That put a strain on his relationship with Alan when he found out that Alan had been lying to Phillip his entire life. Even before that Phillip never wanted to become a businessman like his dad. He had all sorts of “escape” plans. They involved everything from being a professional tennis player to a writer. However, as he got older he couldn’t deny his talent and desire to also be a businessman. He would spend most of his life bouncing back in forth between writing (newspaper, novels, etc.) and being a Spaulding executive.\n\nAlan’s father Brandon Spaulding was a truly evil man. He pitted his children against each other, competing for his affection and control of the company. Alan was a much better man, but had these idea hardwired in. He would also pit his children against each other to grind out what he saw as weakness, etc. He did truly love his children, but that didn’t stop him.\n\nIt should also be noted in Alan’s favor that he was one of the very few characters on any soap that didn’t value biology above adoption. Alan never saw Phillip as anything less than his son and Phillip was in fact his favorite child. It was a complicated relationship though. Alan shot Phillip twice, once before this point in the timeline by accident and once after this point on purpose as part of an effort to get Phillip help and to save his grandchildren.\n\nAnd Danny Santos\n\nSo far Danny has interacted with Phillip more than Alan and that has been a significant if rarely played relationship. Early on during the Ben Warren feud Danny went to Philip, scion to scion, but Phillip underestimated Danny and wouldn’t meet him on equal ground. Later when Michelle and Danny are divorced during a dinner with Michelle, Phillip told her that he now saw Danny as a good man. Phillip was too concerned with his own problems during the next part of the Manny story and they are only reconnecting now.\n\nPhillip, still being wary about being involved with Danny and having already had his first dose of being pitted against Danny by Alan, shows up to feel Danny out and put him on his guard. That’s one of the most important Danny-Phillip scenes but the important scenes between them will continue to show up all the way through the final scenes of the show.\n\nIn many ways, Danny and Phillip were very similar. They were both male scions of powerful and rich families who believed they had the right to run roughshod over the law. They both had complicated relationships with their families, but despite the fact they both realized that some of what their families had taught them was wrong. In a lot of ways they were faced with the same problems and started from the same place, but ultimately Phillip accepts that Danny is the one of them that found the right answers. But at this point in the story the game is still in play.\n\nUPDATED January 9 2017: I discovered I needed to fix a couple of typos and add a couple of sentences for the sake of clarity.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

Alan tells Phillip that if you want to protect something you should hire someone who can think like a thief. Alan tells Phillip he thinks Danny is going straight and he wants to give him a chance. Phillip is surprised but says he will get better acquainted with Danny. At the Bauer House: Ray comes in and sees Danny studying the security logs from the past ten years at Spaulding. Ray tells him that Carmen asks to see a priest and he is going to have to go see her. Danny tells him to be careful and never turn his back to her. Ray leaves and Danny goes back to work. Phillip comes in and sees Danny. Danny asks if he is there to see Rick and Phillip admits that he came to see him.\n\nPhillip: “I love this place so much. It’s the one place in my life that never changes. I can always count on this place and the Bauers.”\n\nDanny: “Ya, they’re great people.”\n\nPhillip: “They are, they really are. Michelle’s like a little sister to me. I don’t see very much of my own.”\n\nDanny: “No, me either. I sent Pilar to Europe when, you know when things started heating up around here. I’m hoping to get to see her soon.”\n\nPhillip: “Is she still with Bill Lewis?”\n\nDanny: “Ya, ya, ya, [with a chuckle] they’re running around and having a good time.”\n\nPhillip: “That’s funny. Bill’s a good kid.”\n\nDanny: “Ya.”\n\nPhillip: “I feel so old every time I look at him now. And Michelle, the two of them. You know what? I can remember I sat in this room and watched the two of them to make a pinkie pact that they would marry each other someday. For a long time we thought it was going to happen.”\n\nDanny: “What a shock I must have been for all of you.”\n\nPhillip: “Hey, Danny she seems to love you very much. and you seem very happy together. That’s all that matters.”\n\nDanny: “Is that why you’re here? To give me a kind of left handed blessing?”\n\nPhillip: “Uhhhh, not about that, but I guess ya sort of. OK look. My father and I have a somewhat unconventional relationship, but in our own odd way we try to look out for each other.”\n\nDanny: “So this is you looking out for your father?”\n\nPhillip: “He very much wants to give you a chance to make this work outside the family business.”\n\nDanny: “But you’re not sure.”\n\nPhillip: “I don’t know, but I’m willing to try. That’s why I’m here. That actually is why I’m here. I am here to welcome you to Spaulding Enterprises.”\n\nDanny: “A personal welcome.”\n\nPhillip: “A very personal welcome because I intend to take a very personal interest in your career. I’d hate to see anything go wrong for any of us.”\n\nHe starts out with some small talk about growing up with Rick and Michelle and how he can really tells Danny loves her. Phillip says he and his father have an odd relationship so he came there to welcome Danny to Spaulding because he doesn’t want anything to go wrong for any of them.\n\nMy Comments:\n\nThis is a short scene to break out on its own, but I wanted it on its own because of the importance of the Phillip-Danny relationship. From Phillip helping Rick set up the kidnapping Michelle to the psych ward, to them locking horns over the plan to get rid of Ben Warren, to their conversation at the 2009 Bauer BBQ and the addition of Manny to the Four Musketeers their relationship raised up at critical plot points. Their relationships as scions of important families in town. Even when they are in competition Danny is more Phillip’s equal than anyone else in town. I don’t think they played this story as often as they should, but when they did play it, it was utterly perfect as this scene is.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

I still have the story mapped out and it will be coming, but you have to wait for me to write it. Hopefully the rest of it will be here by the end of the month. I hope you’ve enjoyed the story this far and as an apology for not finishing, here is this year’s annual Bauer BBQ speech. It’s courtesy of Rick.\n\nCan I have your attention? It’s time again for that time honored tradition. The Bauer BBQ speech where we take a minute to think about what we’re celebrating today instead of the celebration itself….You know it still feels funny for me to be the one giving the speech because I feel like it should be a grown up like my dad or Uncle Mike or Aunt Meta giving this speech. I still feel like I should be a kid trying to filch Grandma Bert’s apple pie off the dessert table — which is probably because I still do that.\n\nAudience chuckles\n\nBut then I look around and I see my kids, my nieces and nephew, all my friends and family, wonderful little sister, Michelle, her husband, Danny, and my beautiful wife, Mindy and I realize I am a grown up who has built a pretty great life here in Springfield. Not just my family, but I have been instrumental in making Springfield better and keeping it a great place to live. Everyone here can say the same thing.\n\nI’ve made my share of terrible mistakes, things I wish I could take back, and I’m sure that you all can say that. I turned my back on Springfield for awhile thinking it would make my problems go away, tried to live in other places for awhile, as some of you have done, but Springfield always calls us back home. We find our answers here among all of us, as part of the community because truly “no one goes his way alone.”\n\nThe community in Springfield IS extra special, but that sense of community is all across America from, New York to LA, and oh I don’t know, from Oakdale, Illinois to Genoa City, Wisconsin to Port Charles, New York. It’s that sense of individuals pulling together to form communities of respect, dignity, hard work and perseverance and then pulling together more to form one country is what makes this country great. It’s what made it possible for a man like my great-grandfather, whose name I proudly bear, to come to this land, and with the help of his wife to create a family and to help to build this town into what it is today.\n\nSo here’s to friends here and gone, to our children, and to Springfield may it continue to be the special place it is.\n\nAudience “To Springfield!”\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

This location was great. People always looked forward to see the patio all decorated for the party. The Bauer house location had the added advantage that they could have scenes outside and in the kitchen where everybody arrived at the back door so anyone could run into each other especially if they had reason to not want to, they always did. On top of that they could have private scenes in the bedrooms. It was just the perfect place to host a soap opera party.\n\nOther Places\n\nWhile the Bauer House was the normal location for the BBQ, they did hold it some place else four times over the years. Most famously it was held at the Johnny Bauer’s hanger at the Springfield Airport in 1987. That was the 50th anniversary year and I think the main point was to accommodate plot points where Alan-Michael Spaulding parachuted in and Lacey Bauer accidentally took off in a hot air balloon and to make the 50th Anniversary a big splash.\n\nWatch it:\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2010/07/02/bauer-bbq-1987/\n\nIn 1988, the BBQ was held in a nearby park that had a gazebo. Among many other exciting happenings, Maeve Stoddard and Fletcher Reade got married with the Bauers in the wedding party.\n\nWatch it:\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/bauer-bbq-1988\n\nThen the last two different locations had to do with money, sets, and to writer bias.\n\nIn 2007 , the last year before the production model changed they were really down to three sets. A sad verision of Towers, a single room at the Beacon that was re-dressed a little to be everyone’s bedroom, and this sad Sesame Street knock off that they called Main Street. Once in a while we’d get another set, but normally that was it. The excuse in the storyline was there was a gas link and so the Bauer BBQ was moved to Main Street.\n\nWatch it:\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/bauer-bbq-2007\n\nIn 2008, they’d moved to permanent sets but the Bauers didn’t have one. Let me repeat that…THE BAUERS didn’t have a single set. So instead they had Rick decide he wouldn’t throw the Bauer BBQ this year so Josh and Cassie (who did have a house) took over and rented bouncing houses since there was no pool.\n\nWatch it:\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2010/07/07/bauer-bbq-2008/\n\nIn 2009, the BBQ returned to the Bauer House although it was filmed in a completely different place that really was someone’s backyard.\n\nWatch it:\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2010/07/08/bauer-bbq-2009\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.
