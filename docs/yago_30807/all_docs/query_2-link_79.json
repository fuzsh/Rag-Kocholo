If you could add any light it would be most appreciated.\n\njcraig@wmrl.info\n\nVETERAN DIES HERE.<br>In our Hospital at 10:45 this morning died a British veteran, William D. Pattinson, of wounds and gas injuries he received at the battle of the Somme, in France in the spring of 1916. After the battle he was taken to base hospital, then to his home at Maryport, Eng., wherefrom he enlisted and where he was a member of the Perseverance Ledge of Masons, and then, in the hope that the sea and the change would do him good, came to this country to visit his aunt, Mrs. Wm. H. Wilson, Washington Square, this city, wife of the well known merchant there. At first he felt better and gained but the anemia which afflicted him gained ground and he got weaker, and was taken to the Hospital for special treatment. He could not rally and so at the age of 29, one of the heroes of the Somme, where the German advance was checked finally and decisively in blood and by the loss of many gallant English lives offered as a sacrifice for the freedom of the World, he, bravely fighting, fell. A wave of gas from the demon hordes of his foes and machine gun shot overcame him. He has no other relatives in this county than Mrs. Wilson. He was a fine and splendid young man.<br>He, after enlistment, was promoted to sergeant of the Durham Infantry, and served his country well.\n\nOctober 2014:\n\nAny information on Henry Marshall Steele born in Jamaica 1801, married in Wigton Cumberland in 1828 to Anne Wilson, daughter of Martha Wilson, (widow) of Bowness Cumberland.

I have no info on their life in Jamaica except that Henry was an overseer on a sugar plantation, nor any info where or when Anne and Henry died. He was a widower by 1861 living in the house of his daughter Catherine Martha Lawson in Bowness.\n\nSo grateful for any clues.\n\nMany thanks\n\nSusie Hayes (susanhayesrata@gmail.com)\n\nI know that around 1911- 17 my grandmother attended a school housed in the building which stands at the South end of the Market Place. We used to know it as Roan's Furniture shop and Mill Tech computers have a shop there now. It is a distinctive building with its arched windows and space for a bell to be hung on the roof. I now know that the school was a private preparatory school called Solway School but can find no records of it at all. I have tried the Records Office and I have Googled the name, but nothing appears.\n\nIf anyone has any information about this establishment, I would be pleased if they could email me.\n\nQuiann11@gmail.com\n\nI am looking to reconnect with my long lost family and was wondering if you could help me in any way.

The photograph is made by W. GIBSON, The British Studio, Tangler Bldgs, Whitehaven. We also found out that there was in that time a convalescence hospital in Whitehaven, we think it was called the Moresby House Hospital.\n\nMy grandfather was a Belgian soldier who was first at the Battle of Antwerp until 10-10-1914 and later at Adinkerke near the IJzer river and at the railway between Aachen and MontzenHis name is Leopold Sijmus, sometimes also written as Seymus, born at Beerzel on 18th april 1885, military number 103.52843.The only thing we know for sure that he was wounded in a gas attack (not the exact date, but problably later than 1915) and that he stayed for some time in Great Britain in hospital.Can you tell us if there are any archives of this hospital and where should we ask to get information? Or does anyone have any other information about this picture or the photographer?\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPaul van de Water (pvandewater@wijzijneen.nl)\n\nMet vriendelijke groet,\n\nHi , I'm looking for James wilkinson born roughly 1930, he married my nan (Ellen benson) in 1959 and they had a child (my dad) born Paul Brandon wilkinson ( was changed to Paul Brandon Robinson).

Keith skudd@xtra.co.nz\n\nApril 2013\n\nI have been researching my paternal line and my g g g g grandfather William Gilpin (Weaver) was living in Whitehaven in a house in Charles Street at the time of the towns own census in 176The house was owned by another William Gilpin who was a merchant. In 1777 William Gilpin (Merchant) sold the house to William Hicks and William Gilpin (Weaver) continued to live in the Charles Street House until he died in 1785 and his short obituary appeared in the Cumberland Paquet in April of that year. I believe my William married Isabel Burton who bore him two children John and George, before dying two weeks after giving birth to their third child Richard (who subsequently died). William married again in 1767 to Grace Brown and had several more children, one of whom was my g g g grandfather Henry born in 1776. William was literate and as he signed his own Marriage Bond was presumable in a position to promise to pay the £200 forfeiture fee.\n\nMy problem is I cant find a birth record for him but as the marriage licence states that he was 33 in 1767 I must assume he was born around 1733/4. Can anyone out there give me any clue as to his parentage? Would be grateful for any help  thank you.

John had married Christian Kinley in 1827 on the Isle of Man. I would like to know if there is anyone doing research on the Steel/e families of Whitehaven, I have hit a brick wall about John Steele.

Hannah (nee Martin) and Dan Pattinson (my 2xg-grandparents) lived at 38 Irish Street, Whitehaven at least until 1886 when Dan died. Hannah subsequently lived at 66 Strand Street, which is where my grandmother (Hannah Key, daughter of Ellen Key, who was the daughter of Hannah and Dan) was born. Hannah senior also had a son named Albert Edward Pattinson, apparently born in Carlisle, date of birth November 1887, obviously not the son of Dan! I have been unable to trace any record of Albert's birth anywhere, but have him in 1891 (Whitehaven) and 1901(Lancashire) Census records. I have my grandmother's birth certificate and have seen a record of her baptism when she was about 8 years old, unfortunately I can't remember which church in Whitehaven and have lost the notes I made when visiting Carlisle some 15 or so years ago. I have managed to trace Martins back to William and Ann (one Census she is named Nancy - is this likely?) in 1841 - they lived at Harrington. I would particularly like information on Albert Edward Pattinson - Hannah Pattinson died in 1901 and it was some time after that Albert came to New Zealand. Maybe Albert was christened in Whitehaven. Hannah Pattinson also has a connection to the Studholme family - her mother Ann married Thomas Studholme when Hannah was young and had several more children. One Studholme daughter married a Clements.

Most of my ancestors were Johnson/ Johnstons in Moresby. However after they moved to County Durham they continued to visit a family called Phillips who had a removals firm in Whitehaven. Does anyone know anything about this company or family?\n\nAlso I remember my grandparents having a curious plate which read'Littledale and the Independence of Whitehaven'\n\nDoes anyone know the significance of this inscription?\n\nJenifer Spencer ajja80@ukgateway.net\n\nMy g-grandfather, Irvin Hurst (shipwright) was b1833 to Henry Hurst (b1808 Flimby) and Sarah Swift. Henry's parents were Lawrence Hurst and Jane Irving. The last couple are buried at St Mary's, Maryport, their gravestone leans on the back wall.\n\nSarah Swift's parents were James Swift and Sarah Woodburn, who married 1795 in Whitehaven.Sarah lived to old age in Cockermouth but I haven't been able to find the demise of James. He was supposedly from Gt Yarmouth which seems a long way to travel then.\n\nIf anyone is related to these families, I would gladly exchange info from the New Zealand descendants of Irvin.\n\nThank you, Colleen Newton colleen.newton1@xtra.co.nz\n\nHi,\n\nI am researching unemployment relief projects of the 1920's and wonder whether anyone living locally has any information regarding the construction of the \"Loop Road\" which i believe was originally built as the Whitehaven Bypass by unemployed workers. I believe it was built around 1925 but have no other information on this. Does anybody have any details as to the construction period, how many people were engaged on the project and who (i.e. unemployed miners?) and especially when it was opened and whether there was any formal opening ceremony? There are occasional references to the road on local websites but very few details of its history. Any information will be much appreciated!\n\nMany thanks.\n\nKeith keith.a.spencer@voa.gsi.gov.uk\n\nI am researching my family tree and have come to a brick wall,I have copy of 1841 census which shows the family comprising Sarah Edwards (mother) ,Isabelle,wilfred,Alice ,John. any help very much welcome they lived Whitehaven Preston St ? and think the father John was stationed there in the Army.\n\nfjc@joecorkill.fsnet.co.uk\n\nJanuary 2008\n\n\"I am doing some research for a freind of mine.her name is mary mckee.her dad was andrew mckenzie mckee,and her mum was margaret jane mckee nee barry.she was born at 6 johns lane,whitehaven in 1929.she has 2 brothers.john barry mckee born 1919,another brother,but i have forgot his name,and 2 sisters calledann ellen mckee,and ages mckee.her mum died in the 40,s tragically,an her died died in the late 30,s she thinks.if theres any chance theres anyone who knew the family,or if any of her siblings or near family are still with us,could you please contact me asap.she,s 79 yrs old\"\n\n.thankyou wendy.\n\nCan anyone help with the McGill family of Whitehaven in the late 1800's?\n\nAbraham McGill born 1836 in Ireland and wives Mary and Catherine, (children - Mary, Eliza, Sarah, Malcolm, James, Abraham, Ada, Hugh, Joseph, Robert and George).\n\nAnnie McGill born 1843 in Ireland who married Thomas Johnston.\n\nJoseph McGill born 1847 in Ireland and wife Eleanor, (children - Margaret, Sarah, Eleanor, Eliza, Mary, Joseph, Florence and Wilhemenia).\n\nThere may have been other siblings of Abraham, Annie and Joseph.
