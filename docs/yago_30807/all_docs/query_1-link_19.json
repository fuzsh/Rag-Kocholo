        "text": "Ryan is THAT man. You know the one, the man who can never be alone for long. It makes him edgy. Every time you see him, he’s with someone new and he never seems to think it’s strange that the paper towel sitting on your kitchen counter has outlasted the last three relationships he’s been in.\n\nRyan and Kendall weren’t playing it for comedy, but it sure as hell didn’t stop me from laughing as they told Emma about Greenlee’s death. Cam Mathieson is pretty damned hot, but the whole weepy cow-eyed thing he does when Ryan is “sad”? EH… I could live without it. But that’s not what gave me the big giggles.\n\nThe whole time I watched Kendall and Ryan break the news to Emma I wondered how much better those scenes would have been if Emma looked up at Kendall and asked her if she was going to help her daddy put Greenlee’s things in a box, just like daddy and Greenlee put her mommy’s things in boxes. That’s the natural progression of a relationship in little Emma’s life, thanks to daddy. Of course, it doesn’t bode well for Kendall that every woman who loves Ryan ends up with her things in a box ready to be shipped to soapgod knows where. But he is Ryan, and that’s not supposed to matter. He’s special.\n\nEmma lost her mother when Annie was locked away in an institution and was almost immediately given a ‘new mom’ in Greenlee. Greenlee dies shortly after and now Kendall is there, holding her, telling her that the replacement mom is now an angel (or maybe just looks like one… flying off the end of that motorcycle in a wedding gown and veil. Just sayin’). Clearly, it was impossible for Ryan to tell Emma on his own. He’s THAT man… the man who can’t do anything without a woman there to adore and support him. Who knew that Annie was actually the stable one in the relationship?\n\nThe writers will probably allow Ryan to grieve, for at least a week or two. He’ll then end up consoling Kendall. He’ll help her ‘heal’ from her feelings hurt of betrayal thanks to Zach/Bianca/Reese. It will be hard, at first, but his heart will go on… and then I think we’ll end up watching a love quad with Reese/Zach/Kendall/Ryan…\n\nI should say that YOU”ll end up watching that quadrangle, AMCers… I’ll be watching The Guiding Light.\n\nSoapgod knows I already hated Ryan “godofallwomenifonlyinmyownhead” Lavery, but you had to throw Reese in there too? Let’s for one moment ignore:\n\n1. that Reese thought it was ok for a married man to impregnate her girlfriend without telling his wife (her girl’s sister).\n\n2. that she betrayed Binks with Zach and left her feeling insecure.\n\n3. that she even thought of leaving Binks and their daughters behind to return to Europe\n\n4. that she had a fiance she hid from Binks.\n\n5. that she snarks on Kendall as if KENDALL has done something wrong. She thinks Kendall hates her just because of the way she looks at her. HA! I look at her that way too! I wonder if it’s possible for soap characters to catch viewers’ reflected images through the screen? EH! Of course not… but for a moment, I thought maybe Reese was mistaking the disgust viewers’ faces must show every time she dumps on Binks or Kendall to excuse her inappropriate relationship with Zach.\n\n6. Reese’s ridiculous overreaction to her mother asking if two of the guests at the bridal shower were also lesbians. Mother Willians was curious, and she was smiling and laughing at the playful affections between the two friends. Reese, in essence, created the picture of a robe-and-hood wearing bigoted mother who hates all others different from herself. It’s too bad that her mother only smacked her once. I wanted her to give Reese a slap from me, too.\n\nOh Reese, projection much, dear? Worried that your mother is uncomfortable with you identifying as a lesbian, though she loved you enough to put her issues aside in order to be at the shower supporting you?\n\nWHO, exactly, is uncomfortable with your identification as a lesbian? Ah, that’s right, YOU are. It’s why you keep swapping saliva with your bride’s brother-in-law. To hear Reese whine that ‘those people’ make her question who she is is pretty much akin to nails on a chalkboard. Maybe in her world ‘those people’ is actually code for ‘MY ACTIONS’. Darlin’, it’s impossible for ‘those people’ to make you forget who you are. You NEVER had an idea who you were/are/is/whatevah.\n\nEven if we could forget all of that, is there any hope of salvaging this character? Is there anything left to her, other than her fabulously talented portrayer, Tamara Braun? Is it time to kill this one off and bring her back as her far more likable twin sister? Too often used? I see what you mean.\n\nIt’s time for Annie to pull a two-fer, Ryan and Reese… Tamara Braun could turn up as a long lost Zacchara cousin… Could fans stand to have three of the four actresses who’ve played ‘Carly Corinthos’ on screen together? I’m willing to give it a shot if it means we get rid of Reese!\n\nYou know the old writers’ insult, “Monkeys banging on typewriters could do a better job!” Imagine if you not only handed a room full of monkeys a set of typewriters (uh, keyboards), but you then locked them in. Well… that’s ONE way to force them to concentrate on completing your scripts, but watch out! Locking them in a room might add insult to injury and monkeys are pretty vengeful. They also have a pretty wicked sense of humor. Make sure you READ the scripts before you film and then air them for long suffering fans.\n\nOne Life to Live\n\nBitchy Marty, Bitchy Tea, Bitchy TeBessica… ‘effin.love.them.all.\n\nJessica apologizing and groveling at Natalie’s feet? No thanks. I felt sympathy for Nat “the outsider” for about 10 minutes. I’m over it. She’s still sleeping with the man who cost her sister’s husband his life. An accident? Sure… after months of deceiving him and destroying everything he’d built for his family. I’m hoping Tess and Bess have teamed up to finish taking Nat and Jared down – without plotting anyone’s death, by the way. Abject misery is enough for me, thanks. Tea taking guff from Blair? I don’t think so. Tea and Blair live different realities. Tea is a badass by nature. She’s shown tremendous growth and change and I love how spunky she is. Blair? Badass, on occasion, doormat more often than not. The woman slept with Spencer Truman just after Todd, the ‘great love’ of her life, was sentenced to execution. Despite every reasonable warning to the contrary, she made Truman a part of her children’s lives. My money is on Tea. Marty Saybrooke being left alone with Janet Ketring/Lee Halpern? Seriously, were the monkeys also STONED when they banged out that moment? Writers, keep an eye on the script monkeys, they’re making you look bad!\n\nIt’s annoying enough that Bo and Nora’s situational ethics drag every other living Llanview resident through the muck, but Bo and Tahlia leaving JK/LH alone with an angry and self-destructive Marty? The woman tried to force Todd to commit suicide for what he did to her (with JK/LH’s help). So they let her confront JK/LH, alone, wearing a coat which could very well have contained a weapon, and carrying an uzi sized purse? They actually LEFT the motel? I have to say, violence isn’t my thing, but I got a chuckle out of JK/LH cracking a vase over Talia’s head and taking off. Too bad Bo didn’t get one of those, as well! You’d think JK/LH was a witness for the defense for as careless as they’ve been about her safety. It must be nice to be pals with people like Bo and Nora. They use their offices to go after people you don’t like if you’re a friend, no matter how flimsy the evidence, nor the cost to the good folks of Llanview.\n\nOh, and locked-away-typewriter-banging monkeys? Less smug from Antonio and Nora, please. They’re on the side of RIGHT, and they leave me wanting to see Tea wipe the smug off of their faces – unless that’s what you wanted and then I feel played (well done). If I’m wrongfully faulting you and it’s the choices made by the actors, please speak to the director and ask him to handle it.\n\nThe Bold and The Beautiful\n\nBridget is a designer now? You magnificent vengeful monkeys, you! You really did get the last laugh, didn’t you? I wish I could laugh with you, but I can’t. It hurts. Did you have to pay the writers back at the viewers’ expense? An accelerated undergrad preMed program, supposed ‘years’ of study in medical school. Internships, Residency, saving lives, bringing babies into the world, bringing her aunt Katie back from the dead, saving her brother from jail following Phoebe’s death… and Bridget wants to give it all up to start designing for the company that just ripped off her father’s and brother’s newest collection. Bridget… giving up medicine for THAT!\n\nShe’s doodled haute couture gowns for years and was just too afraid to tell anyone? Her work is even better than life-long designer Clarke Garrison… stuff she sketched when not practicing medicine 23/6 and no one knew? Uh, because despite the fact that EVERY one of her adult sibs, her nieces and nephew, and BOTH of her parents work in the fashion industry, she was too afraid to tell them she has a passion for fashion? Ok, works in your universe, but typewriter-banging-monkeys, if the writers don’t feed you, refuse to type out scripts on an empty stomach. It makes you a little loopy.\n\nThis wouldn’t hurt so bad if it weren’t a follow up to the “fabulous Paminis”… Pam Douglas, insta-designer with a CROCHET technique so secret that only Pam can churn out the one of a kind hot yarn bikinis… So what is Bridget’s Auntie Pam kicking out? 20 a day in the Forrester sweatshop? Monkeys, explain yourselves! Is there something in the air at FC that makes anyone who passes through the hallowed halls a genius in the design world (all except Clarke it seems)?\n\nGuiding Light\n\nAlan wanting revenge against a cheating Beth? I get that. For once in his life, Alan is as devoted as he’s ever has been to a woman, maybe the most faithful he’s ever been. (Beth hasn’t been faithful to anyone since she was a teen) She gives birth to his child, while still raising his grandchildren and making him part of their lives. Then she cheats on him. He now knows that he’s met his match in Beth. No one loves Alan as much as he loves himself. Ditto on Beth. He’s sleeping with his mirror image and it’s driving him mad, life is a cruel mistress, Alan.\n\nI WANT Alan to make Beth miserable, and not for his sake, but because Beth is supremely selfish and sucks as a person. BUT…Alan grabbing the letter opener, TWICE (something TPTB aired when the scenes picked up with a third and fourth time during the next day’s episode, too)? Good mercy. Giving the audience the impression that he would just as soon plunge the opener into her heart because his heart was broken? YIKES!\n\nI don’t remember Alan being violent with women, especially not to the point of contemplating a brutal death for one. He likes owning and controlling women, but he likes owning and controlling everyone. He usually shows more finesse. The old Alan would have had Coop arrested on some trumped up charge, claimed ‘Company’ for himself – leaving Buzz penniless, and set Beth up to think she was going crazy again just to get custody of Peyton. He would have done it all before lunch! He actually would have kept Buzz on at the restaurant he stole from him and had Buzz SERVE him lunch. Alan is psychotic, but he’s no thug.\n\nMonkeys, you owe the GL writers an apology for what you’ve done to their beloved Alan Spaulding. Shame on you.\n\nAll My Children\n\nZach. Killing Josh. Fathering Gabrielle. Eye-boinking with Reese. Expecting Kendall to understand. Vicious little typewriter-banging-monkeys… You’ve outdone yourselves. I actually like the potential fallout from this one. No criticism, here. This is all soapy goodness. AMC was lucky to have you on staff when you wrote that part of the plot. Kendall, forgive Binks, Reese, and Zach. PRICELESS!\n\nWhile you’re at it, write that script where David Hayward is loving and unselfish, Adam Chandler has sworn off manipulating the people he loves, Erica Kane gives up designer clothes and all other perks of fine living, and JR Chandler stays sober! See how silly it all seems that anyone would expect forgiveness from Kendall? Whatever she does to them, they’ve got it coming. Maybe Zach should keep a picture of his happy parts in a safe location. The doctors will need it when they’re working on the reattachment and reconstruction!\n\nI can’t give you a pass on Amanda’s pregnancy, however. Does anyone remember the last daytime pregnancy where the mother knew who her child’s father was (Binks excluded, of course) and there was no scandal around the pregnancy? (Whoops, Binks back in!) Why another contested paternity? It’s not like there’s been a shortage of them.\n\nThen again, you’ve been writing for Annie and she’s freakin’ wonderful, so it all evens out in the wash!\n\nI’m always giddy for about a week before the Thanksgiving holiday… mad with anticipation. It happens every year and it’s the only thing I can think of that explains the fact that I loved daytime last week. I can’t think of a thing I truly disliked. I enjoyed most of what aired! WOW!\n\nThe Young and the Restless – Poor deluded, insecure, Phyllis. LOVED her reaction to Nick and Sharon’s closeness and that she made sure that everyone knew that she felt ‘thankful’ for a husband who made her feel “sexy”. I LOVED that Sharon wasn’t at all affected by the possessive kiss Phyllis planted on Nick. Loved Nikki and Paul. I get a little tingly watching them! Daytime writers always receive huge kudos for remembering the show’s history and giving us a reason to cheer historic couple on. Veteran viewers will remember the STD storyline that ended the relationship between these characters when they were younger adults – opening the door to Victor and Nikki. It’s an old storyline that still makes some cringe at the thought of the two of them getting together now. I say, BIG DEAL. Paul made mistakes when he was younger. Look at the man he is now. Victor never gave Nikki an STD, but he hasn’t given her much else, either. Paul is so gentle, so sweet, and so caring. It’s been a while since Nikki has had a man like Paul. She’s so use to being treated like property that the tenderness she shares with Paul must be akin to a drowning woman being tossed a life raft.\n\nHey, it doesn’t hurt that Doug Davidson has grown sexier over time and brings a dignity and integrity to the character of Paul that makes me wonder what took writers so long to decide to make him a leading man, again. Better late than never, writers. What a huge plus for veteran viewers like myself who aren’t as fond of new gang of unlikable leads – and you know who they are even if the writers don’t. We get a character we’ve loved for a long time, in a surprising storyline that works. Daytime writers are always patting themselves on the back for ‘taking chances’. These are the sort of chances viewers want more of – playing with the show’s history and taking us somewhere we hadn’t expected to go.\n\nOne Life To Live – Erika Slezak has once again proven that she can take the very worst the writers throw at an audience and spin it into Emmy gold! Breathing new life into Viki Lord Davidson, she almost, ALMOST, gave me a reason to feel sorry for Todd. While that moment was fleeting, my complete and total awe of ES’s performance remains. That Viki suggested that the only true escape from the Lord legacy was death made me gasp. Viki’s expression of emotional and psychological exhaustion and devastation was probably the most amazing work anyone has done on this show in a while. There are things best left forgotten, and there are those things too horrific to forget. The only option when you’re dealing with the latter is to do what you have to do to survive them. To have the sexual assault of Viki revealed and brought to light again was painful for many viewers, I suspect. As peeved as I still am at the writers for the Marty/Todd storyline, I have to admit that they’ve done a magnificent job laying out the case for viewing the Lord family in new perspective. It doesn’t make me want to forgive Todd, but it does add a layer of tragedy to the storyline that I hadn’t considered before.\n\nThe Bold and The Beautiful: DELICIOUS! I found myself wondering if the writers wanted us to view Eric as a man who is so pathetic that his children can’t help but play on his stupidity and his vanity. It’s not just one son who is lying to and deceiving him, but TWO! Rick has led him to believe that he was more seriously hurt than he actually was. Thorne tricked him into believing that Donna was cheating on him. I’m sure this storyline was supposed to be another ‘pity poor Donna’ attempt. Sorry, writers, no dice. That won’t happen. Donna is irrelevant at this point. So much of Eric’s life has been spent being pampered and catered to that his children knew exactly which buttons to push to make him dance to their tune. How perfect is it that a man who has only been passingly acquainted with the term ‘fidelity’ demands and expects it from others? My only real disappointment with this storyline is that Donna will probably end up crying on the ever willing Owen’s shoulder. Poor Budge will become Owen’s friend and confidante, when she should be the woman he falls in love with – but it would be too much to have the writers allow Bridget to be happy.\n\nDAYS Of Our Lives – Nicole, Nicole, Nicole… Zuker was perfect, of course. Just when you’re convinced that Nicole Walker is completely soulless, Zuker pulls out the most amazing performance and reminds you that Nicole’s rough and hard exterior only serves to protect her incredibly soft heart. I just love this character. I may not like what’s coming for our Nicole Walker Dimera, but Zuker makes me want to hang in there and watch just for the performances. GO GET ‘EM, Nicole!\n\nAll My Children – O… M… G!!!! Annie? YIKES! I know it was Annie Lavery carrying that bloody knife and wedding bouquet, last week, but honest to goodness, I just kept seeing Richie’s face. If only the residents of Pine Valley knew then what they know now. I was sorry to see Annie sacrificed on the doomed altar of Ryan and the oft-fleeing Greenlee, but I’ll have to thank the writers for letting Annie go away with a bang, and not a whimper. I had such a grand time watching Annie act out the last scenes of ‘Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?” that I almost didn’t care whose blood was on the knife.\n\nGeneral Hospital. I’ve long since lost my stomach for General Hospital, but I have to say that I didn’t mind the show last week. Sonny’s descent into madness… correction: Sonny’s CURRENT/LATEST descent into madness has been oddly entertaining. Like so many times before, Sonny has been loathed to take the counsel of anyone else, save Jason, and he’s even lost that. Now his actions may cost Jason the one person he cares about above anyone else, his son. I’ve been uber disgusted with Elizabeth’s character. I’ve never been a Jason and Elizabeth fan and can’t imagine that I ever will be. In part because being with Jason is such a betrayal of everything Elizabeth has been about in the past (not to mention that her lie of a relationship with Jason cost poor Lucky so much). Liz was always quick to point out what a bad mother Carly was, that Carly kept putting her sons in danger by being with Sonny. Now? She sees firsthand what a life with a mobster is worth. Will the writers pull the wool back from Elizabeth’s eyes? Will she stop pretending that when Jason kills it’s ‘holy’ and ‘noble’? Will she wonder why she traded in a man who lives on the RIGHT side of the law for the man who clings to the wrong side of it? NAH! It wouldn’t be General Hospital if that happened, right?\n\nBTW, if I didn’t love the Robin-Patrick pairing, I would be seriously considering rooting on an Elizabeth-Patrick pairing… er, how HAWT were they?\n\nAs The World Turns. Brian/Lucinda/Luke… Oh dear. Luke, in the driver’s seat. Watching Luke make Brian uncomfortable? PRICELESS. “Grabby Grandpa Bad Touch” will learn to keep his hand to himself. As much as I hate the idea of Brian deceiving Lucinda, I love the idea of Luke making Brian sweat a little. Brian lost any appeal as a sympathetic character (at least in the short term) the moment he tried to make Luke believe he was both drunk and delusional, that he (Luke) misinterpreted the kiss. I have to say that I wasn’t too keen to watch this storyline play out. I’m sitting on the edge of my seat now. I still think the writers are going with a sexual harassment storyline with this one. Brian, so deep in the closet that even HE doesn’t know where he is, sexually harasses young men – those who are often the least powerful. When they call him on it, he faults them, tells them they’re imagining things, that he was only being a friend. Oh Brian, you picked the wrong man, this time. Luke (and Noah) willl probably be the people who expose his past. This should be good. Take him down, boys, make him sorry for being the sleaze he is… until Lawrence Lau eats the dialogue the writers hand him, does that thing he does oh so well, and makes us all fall in love with Brian and actually feel sorry for him…\n\nWhat did YOU love about your favorite shows this past couple of weeks?\n\nBold and Beautiful\n\nFrom the current SOW:\n\nWeekly: So is this Brooke and Ridge’s big reunion, forever and ever?\n\nBell: It appears as if this is the great reunion. There are always people who may want to get in their way. Stephanie is certainly one. Nick Marone may factor into it. But we’re getting incredibly close. We’re at a point where we just can’t imagine they’ve reached this level. They’ve been through so much. How can this not be forever?\n\nWeekly: In your mind, are they each other’s soul mates?\n\nBell: So much of this series is about Brooke and Ridge, from early on until now. It’s amazing that we still have Ron and Kelly, that they look so beautiful, that their chemistry has not waned at all. This is an incredible climax to this whole saga.\n\nWell now… from EARLY ON it’s been about Brooke and Ridge? From EARLY ON!?!?!? Ah… BINGO! Anyone who’s watched this show from the day it aired has known that. It was ‘the look’ that launched Bridge, and ‘the look’ between these characters that has kept so many fans hooked on this show.\n\nThe war on love between Brooke and Ridge has left behind a string of casualties, on and off the screen. On screen we have Eric, Thorne, Grant, Taylor, Ashley, James, and a host of others who came close, but never really close enough to keeping Brooke and Ridge apart. Off screen? The fans – those who are still watching, those who gave up on the writers long ago, who are victims of the BRidge tease. I still have my frustrations with the couple, namely Brooke – she drives me nuts and annoys the unholy hell out of me most of the time, and yet there’s a part of me that can’t get past what Brooke and Ridge are when they’re TOGETHER.\n\nThey have been the couple to ‘keep apart’ for over 21 years soap time. Taylor has manipulated and elbowed her way between them, Stephanie practically sits outside their bedroom door waiting for the chance to run in and steal Ridge away, Nick just sits by – waiting for a moment of vulnerability in order to slime his way in, Eric is always desperate and hopeful and inappropriate in his feelings for Brooke… the list goes on. In the end, they’ve only ever stood on the outside looking in and the writers have made it clear, far too many times, that the story was about BRidge love and the lengths all others would go to in order to keep them apart.\n\nThe big question is, are there enough fans still watching to trust that BRidge really can and will be happy this time? It’s hard to trust the BnB writers. Case in point? The 20th anniversary show. I’d recount what happened for those of you who missed it, but I don’t want to be responsible for making adults cry (a nod ando condolences to those of you who did watch it).\n\nALL My Children\n\nThere’s a great deal of maturity in the AMC writing for Reese and Bianca. I can remember Erica’s one time utter revulsion at the thought that her little Binks was a lesbian. She was so sickened at the thought that another woman would touch her daughter that it pushed her to the brink of madness. Now? Reese, the love of Bianca’s life, is going to get the ‘Kane treatment’. Oh yes, Reese, someone should have warned you about Erica’s rocky relationships with her childrens’ spouses.\n\nThe minute I heard Erica say that Bianca needed help and that she felt Reese was taking advantage of Bianca’s good nature, I knew there was trouble brewing. At some point, there will be scenes of Zach and Reese sharing a beer, wondering what awful thing they did in their past lives that brought them to the point of finding love and ending up with Erica as a mother-in-law. Maybe they’ll flip a coin to figure out which of them will get to be the hero(ine), taping Erica’s mouth shut and shoving her in a dark, locked room.\n\nOh! I do feel a little guilty for saying that. Erica scored huge mommy points for bringing not one but TWO nannies to help take care of the kiddos. Freakin’ awesome. What mother DOESN’T dream about an on-call staff of nannies?\n\nAbout the show’s other soul mates, I’m still hanging on for the Jesse/Angie arc. I wish the writers would hurry up and end the Greenlee/Aidan/Annie/Ryan storyline to make more time for Jessie and Angie. My only remorse about the end of the quad storyline is that there weren’t MORE shirtless Aidan scene. Oh what a happy girl I would have been had that happened.\n\nAs The World Turns\n\nJack and Janet as soul mates? Eh! If by ‘soul mates’ that means that they’re both so vapid and empty that it takes the TWO of them to create something resembling one complete ‘soul’? Oh, sure.\n\nHow about Dusty and nu-sorta-Jen-but-let’s-call-her-Josie-for-now? Nah, not yet! Give them time and they will be, I’m sure.\n\nLuke and Noah? BINGO! I think that the student election storyline is probably one of the most insipid, yawn inducing storyline the writers could have imagined for these two. The aftermath? BRILLIANT. Noah turns Luke in? They fight over Noah’s cut-and-run behavior? They make up and Luke realizes that he needs Noah and tells him so? Begs him not to leave? Is their relationships stagnant? SURE. It is, I don’t think anyone would deny that Luke and Noah are the show’s longest running “relationship virgins” – kissing cousins Parker and Liberty had sex faster than these two.\n\nSo what’s so brilliant about Nuke (Noah and Luke)? Their scenes are so sweet and tender that they can sometimes make you forget that the couple hasn’t been intimate. The actors deserve recognition for creating an intimacy that doesn’t require sexual contact between characters to be real. The strength of the Nuke relationship, and the audience’s overwhelmingly positive reaction to the couple, rests squarely on the shoulders of the remarkable Van Hansis (Luke) and Jake Sillbermann (Noah). It sure as hell ain’t the writing that keeps fans tuning in. Van and Jake are able to transform writing best left to an elementary school play and turn it into broadway worthy material. The writers owe these kids, BIG! Now… give them more screen time, thank you very much.\n\nThe Young and the Restless\n\nVictor and Ashley? Folks, I’m a Vic-Ashley fan from Waaaaay back. I hated Nikki for teaching Victoria to call Ashley the ‘wicked witch of the west’. I despised her even more when she deceived Ashley, making Ash believe that she was dying, leading Ash to abort Victor’s child. Ashley thought she was giving Nikki the will to live, or at least the opportunity to die in peace, with her family. Am I happy to see Victor and Ash back together? YES! All is right in my YnR world.\n\nDo I think it will last? No. Even I know that Victor and Nikki are the show’s star-crossed lovers no matter who else they love or how many children Victor keeps having with other women. I know it will end, but I will enjoy Victor and Ashley for as long as they are around.\n\nI don’t want to see Ash or Victor stick it to Nikki – it would mean their relationship isn’t real, it’s more about making HER miserable than the two of them being together, and that would be far too sad for me. Oh sure, Ashley deserves to have a little fun… but not too much. I also don’t want to see Victor treat Ash the way he’s treated Nikki – he can be a cruel S.O.B. I just want a little romance from SOMEONE on this show – a romance worth watching, that is.\n\nI wonder how the mini-mustaches are going to take it when Victor returns with Ashley? Nick won’t have the room to be too critical of Victor. Adam would have no room to talk, at all. Victoria? After her speech of always feeling loved by her mother, but no so much by her father, I have a feeling that Ashley had better hang on to Victor with both hands. If she’s written true to form, I have no doubt that Victoria will try to pry Ashley and her father apart. Let the games begin!\n\nFirst, my apologies, most especially to the many of you who are loyal SandF readers! I’ve been busy with the 2008 Presidential election and the aftermath! Second, I’ve had a great time and I’m BACK BABY!\n\nIt looks like I came back just in time… there’s the good, the bad, and the just too ugly to believe.\n\nThe Good. Oh Sharon Newman Abbott, you GO GIRL, GO! How much have you been loving the scenes of Nick and Sharon in Paris? How much do you LOVE having Sharon tell Nick that after everything they shared, she will NOT become the other woman? Ah, yes, and in one little line, Sharon has shown why she’s the BETTER woman. Great job writers. It was a moment to behold.\n\nIt would be so easy for Sharon to pay Phyillis back for sleeping with Nick while she was still mourning her daughter’s death Cassie’s death (apparently Nick Newman mourned his daughter’s death with his pants down, what a prince!). Phyllis has never had a modicum of self-respect, so it wasn’t exactly a shock that she would sleep with Nick the way she did. She took the cheap chick’s route. Sharon took the woman’s route to love. If Nick wants her, TRULY wants and respects her, let him ditch the travesty of a woman he cheated with and then married, FIRST.\n\nI love that Phyllis got to see Nick gazing into Sharon’s eyes and knowing that he wasn’t thinking of her. Is Newman a catch? Uh, no, just like his father, but given what Sharon has had to endure at the joined hips of Nick and Phyllis, I don’t mind seeing Phyllis get hers, FIRST, and then have Sharon stick it to Nick, later… Writers, for ONCE, let a man have to crawl through broken glass, figuratively of course, before he wins back his true love.\n\nThe Bad. NO! NO! NO! NO! Aidan has been assisting Annie all this time? Geez. If only we’d had an inkling that Aidan was pathological before this. To have him help Annie stage threats and a kidnapping? Wow, writers, you really know how to kick an Aidan-lover when she’s down. To think that I discussed how HOT I thought AMC was. I’m still hoping the writers will pull this one off and there’s some catch to this storyline. HEY, don’t knock my dreams, people.\n\nToo UGLY to be believed. The Bold and the Beautiful. Rick. One word, so much pain. Any storyline to do with this guy is painful. Eric has to become an even bigger asshat than before. (Who knew that was possible?). Is there some point at which someone tells Rick to give up his pity party and to stop attacking Ridge’s ‘massive ego’ when it’s simply impossible to believe that Rick can see past his OWN ego to even get to Ridge’s?\n\nHe deceives his mother to elicit her sympathy.\n\nHe deceives his father to steal his company.\n\nHe deceives his family to try to get them to turn on Ridge.\n\nAnd why? Oh, that’s right, Taylor dumped him. He is the great and powerful Rick so lying about paralysis and pain are legitimate tactics and completely appropriate when Rick does it. He’s free to treat women like garbage, but whoa is the world should Rick have his tiny little…. heart…. broken.\n\nWhat is the point of symbolically castrating a soap character, writers? It’s effectively what you’ve done eiwth Rick. His incessant whinging, crying, and lying leaves me wishing for the ultimate death scene for his character. I’m back in denial and pretending that the BnB doesn’ exist most days. I am simply unable to watch most of what the BnB has to offer these days (including Taylor including her children in her scams to try to win Ridge back. EGADS!) How’s that working out for you, Taylor?\n\nSo Ridge knows that Taylor is using their children to try to win him back and doesn’t care? He doesn’t want her? For THIS, Rick is trying to ruin the lives of his mother, Ridge, his younger brother and sister?\n\nOK, I will admit that this scene was a teeny bit priceless\n\nThere are soap events I never expected to like (or hadn’t even thought about) until they happened:\n\nYnR – I love the Victor/Nikki dynamic, when it’s not abusive on his end. I love that Nikki feels something so deep for Victor that it hits her so unexpectedly that she has no idea what to do with it. Victor’s boat washes ashore and Nikki begins drinking again thinkng the great man, himself, is dead. KUDOS to the writers. Even though they somehow managed to forget about Victor’s vasectomy and had him get Sabrina pregnant, they made good use of Nikki’s earlier troubles with alcoholism. I can’t wait for the promised fireworks when Mr. Mumbles and Nikki are reunited. You know he’s going to break the magical spell MTS’ Nikki is casting and he’ll be total bastard to her. More is the pity.\n\nNikki’s drunken rants to Katherine? PRICELESS. That’s when you know who your real friends are, and the friendship between these two women is legendary. Not many women in daytime are written as having long-term friendships. The writers deserve credit for realizing how perfect this one is.\n\nGeneral Hospital. It’s been difficult for me to see Sonny as a leading romantic lead since the end of Sonny-Brenda, and then Sonny-Carly. Every other woman he’s been with is just another putrid shade of ‘Agent Hannah Scott’ – Oh the horror. I don’t know WHY it works, but Sonny and Kate work wonderfully well. There’s an ‘almost’ respect Sonny has for Kate that he hasn’t had for any other woman. He’s softer with her, more gentle. She’s less obnoxious with him. The relationship with Kate hasn’t changed my mind about Sonny or Kate, individually. They both drive me batty, but together they have something new and different.\n\nI also love the new dynamic between Carly and Jax. She’s working hard to stop him from becoming a grumpy old man, and he’s working hard to help her grow up before her children do. They feel like an old married couple, with a lot of hot passion.\n\nGuiding Light… <sigh> I despise ‘G’. Grady is a boil on the butt of daytime. YET, I gotta admit to being mildly entertained by his call to the police to report Rafe. If only the cheesy one-cop-with-a-bullhorn scene hadn’t followed. The house was surrounded? Really? Next time? Spring for a full police force. Grady phoned in a call about hostage taker loaded to the nines. There should have been a SWAT time surrounding the place. I actually changed the channel after watching that scene, and almost forgot to tune back in. Glad I finally remembered that GL was on, because I enjoyed watching Grady snicker while he held Daisy – pretending not to know about Rafe being arrested.\n\nAh… if only he hadn’t been such a lowlife when he was first introduced. Attempted rape, and then murder is something very few characters have been able to come back from. I don’t see Grady as being one of those who will make a come back. Too much has happened and the writing for him is too weak. I have a feeling the conflict between Cyrus and Grady is setting the stage for his departure. Cyrus is finally opening his eyes to what sort of person his brother is. At some point, Cyrus will have to set aside his guilt over not being around for Grady’s childhood, and he’s going to have to turn on him. Oddly enough, I’m looking forward to that day (assuming the writers eventually get it, that it has to happen in order to save Cyrus). I’m not looking forward to it JUST to get rid of Grady, but because any conflct scenes between these two brothers has to be explosive!\n\nAs The World Turns. Seeing Lucy Walsh onscreen more than once a week? I never expected to see it happen again in my life time. Thank you writers. Watching La Walsh fall for yet another sleazy guy in the workplace? No thank you, writers. I’m hoping Lucy picks up on Brian’s act and nails him before… he nails her… ah! You knew that was coming. Kudos to those who viewers who’ve suggested that Brian COULD be Craig, with reconstructive surgery. I don’t know how to feel about that (since Scott Bryce and Hunt Block are the only actors I’ve been able to love in the role). I’d love to have Scott Bryce back if Craig resurfaces.\n\nI <gulp> liked Holden and Carly’s date. I liked that it was so awkward. I liked the fact that Holden tracked Carly down when she ran out on him, to prove to her that what they have is real. It’s the first decent thing Holden has done since this wacked out relationship began. I’m starting to believe that Holden’s feelings for Carly are real and that it’s not just about sexual gratification for him. Having him show up at Carly’s and refuse to give up on their relationship, for just a moment, reminded me of ‘Holden the stable boy’… hot, smoldering, and irrestible…\n\nATWT fans are clamoring for a Katie-Brad baby. When would they find the time? Katie and Brad have been pretty busy raising Liberty and protecting her in way that her mother can’t, or won’t. They’ve proven themselves to be the great parents (much like Tom and Margo or Kim and Bob). I get it, Katie/Brad fans, I get it. I’m with you. I’d love to see these two focus on their family and have children. There’s something special in the relationship between these two characters. I’d love to see MORE Katie and Brad, LESS Jack and Janet and LESS Liberty and Parker.\n\nOne Life to Live – Two pathological people. Double the mayhem? Double the trouble? No, double the fun! Todd and Tess, the uncle niece from hell. There’s an obvious connection that Tess and Todd have that Jessica and Todd could never have. If only they weren’t working hard to cover up the fact that Todd is hiding Marty – that’s just creepy on both ends. Tess felt she was ‘held captive’ when Jess resurfaced – not a twinge of sympathy for Marty? Oh well. Hey, writers, why not have Tess and Todd running ‘The Sun’? Why not have them team up in business? Despite the fact that they’re both a brick shy of a load, having them work together somehow makes each of them seem less psychotic.\n\nAll My Children – Annie! Annie, Annie, Annie… the writers wait until the very end to make her interesting? WTH? Too bad, this show needs a character like Annie. Dealing with a dillweed like Ryan would push almost any woman over the edge, at least Annie’s insanity is entertaining. I want Annie to stick around, and make the rest of Pine Valley miserable, at least until her plots are foiled she moves on to the next one. Can you imagine and Annie-Adam pairing? Krystal, who?"
