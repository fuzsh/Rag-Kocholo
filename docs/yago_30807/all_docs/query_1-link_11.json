Poor Brooke, but at least she isn't dead.\n\nZach Slater: Maria Santos!\n\nETA. I was going with Estimated Time Of Arrival. Edited To Add? Okay. It works.\n\nI agree. Kendall trusts in Hannah was weird. It was different. It was different for Kendall. It lures you in for the \"Husband, I trusted you\" fallout. However, I don't Zach slept with Hannah. Why was he drinking when Josh came to visit and Hannah had just left Pine Valley? So, the writers can make us think he may have slept with her. It's funny when I go back and watch old episodes from the beginning of storylines that I already know the conclusion of. You can clearly see what the writers and directors wanted us to believe. \"There's no need for that dramatic pause. What are you staring at, Ryan? Say something. Oh, I see. We've got to pay the bills. Commercial break. DVR. Fast forward.\"\n\nI started watching All My Children in 2001, which is why I'm not familiar with every couple. Many may think that I may not qualify to have an opinion certain couples. Very well. Through flashbacks, dialogue, SoapNet specials, YouTube, and conversations, that's how I formed my opinions.\n\nI laughed at the idea that I have a Rendall agenda. I didn't even know that's what Ryan and Kendall were called. I'm not a frequent poster of any and all forums. I stay away due to spoilers. I've stated that before. I assure you I have no agenda. There is no conspiracy theory. I respect the opinions of those that think Zach and Kendall are one another's true love. I don't think they're necessarily wrong. I'm able to acknowledge and accept everyone's view. I'm not a hater. But, thanks for calling me out. It made me laugh.\n\n\"They needed Kendall to pimp this story.\" That's my favorite line of the thread. It made me laugh. It's funny and it's true. Some characters need breathing room from one another. It's hard to watch. Speaking of... When I rewatch recent AMC episodes with my friend (because she has to catch up), I cringe because in the beginning of each episode it's like, \"Okay, is everyone mad each other today or are they happy?\" It's goes back and forth each day.\n\n\"You never had enough faith in me, Ryan,.\" I wasn't expecting Kendall to respond like that. The only reason I think it's closure is because nothing is ever closed for too long.\n\nI am also someone who hasn't been watching AMC since Moby Dick was a minnow. I basically became a serious fan when TK walked onto the scene. (Who can blame me.) However, I have also spent time trying to \"catch-up\" on other sites with video clips and transcripts. In my opinion, Ryan never loved Kendall. He never even wanted her, until someone else came along and showed interest. He is a nasty man who loves only himself. He has serious anger issues that need to be dealt with. I can remember the first time Kendall and Zach met in Vegas. I thought \"WOW!\" there is a couple that would be great together, and they are. As for Zach and Maria, she never did have faith in him or believe in him. I think he was truly over her when he realized how he cared for Kendall. He wouldn't leave Kendall for Maria if she came back. Remember his letter to Kendall during the SS s/l? Kendall has given Zach the one thing he never had - a family. He would never do anything to screw that up. And Zach has done so much for Kendall that no other man has done. He loves her despite her shortcomings, for who she really is. I know this isn't reality and eventually the writers will break my favorite couple up, but right now it is impossible for me to see Zach with any other woman than Kendall. And I think they would always be each others' soulmates. This is just my opinion.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by searose\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Ann\n\nAnd no, I don't carry any weight here, but I can assure you, there are a lot of posters here who not only are not Ryan fans, but who sure as hell don't promote \"Rendall' as a couple.\n\nAnd I am one of them , and that's why I did not respond when I first read the post, because I did not want to go ballistic, LOL. No matter what happens between Zach and Kendall, TPTB should by now realize that Rendall is DEAD, and the idea stinks like hell. Ryan never, ever LOVED Kendall, just like Greenlee never, ever LOVED Kendall either. And for an intelligent woman like Kendall to not have realized after being with Zach what her relationship with Ryan was really like, is an insult to Kendall and to all the fans.\n\nSearose and Ann you have voiced my opinion. Rendall is dead if it ever was alive to begin with. Ryan never respected Kendall. He never allowed her her choices. His professed love for her was nothing more than a typical Ryan the conman manipulation of women, which he is still doing with Annie and Greenlee. He abused Kendall both physically and emotionally, even while she is married to Zach. Ryan is a man that has no understanding what it is to love unconditionally, like Zach does.\n\nKendall today knows what it is to have the love of a real man like Zach. There is no way she would ever IMO lower herself to being with someone who to this day cannot commit himself totally to any woman. Kendall herself told Ryan that he never had enough faith in her. IMO Ryan is an insult for any woman to want to be with.\n\nIt is unfortunate that TPTB on this program somehow seem to keep on propping the Lavery brothers as a God-send to women. IMO they couldn't be more wrong.\n\nAs far as Zach being with Maria, if she ever came back, I doubt that very much. Yes, Zach loved Maria when they were both lost in their lives. However, when Maria got her memory back, she chose Edmund. Maria did not believe Zach when Edmund was murdered. Kendall was willing to give up her life for Zach and in Zach's own words, \"No one has ever loved me that much\". There is no way that Zach would choose Maria over Kendall, the love of his life, who is now carrying their child.\n\nZach and Kendall IMO are the destiny couple of AMC."
