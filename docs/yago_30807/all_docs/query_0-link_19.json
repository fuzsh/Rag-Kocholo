Ryan found a stable job at WRCW. When station manager Liza Colby learned that he was receiving private cuts from their advertisement sponsors, she threatened to fire him. That is of course until Ryan agreed to Liza’s plot to protect her nephew, Scott Chandler.\n\nHungarian princess, Gillian Andrassy, revealed her father had squandered their family fortune. Gillian needed money, desperately. She set out to find the richest, and youngest bachelor Pine Valley had to offer. By New Year’s 1998, that man would be 18 year old Scott Chandler. Gillian knew she could win Scott over with her good looks and passion for sex. But Kelsey Jefferson had her own plans for Scott.\n\nKelsey and Liza Colby led Gillian to believe that Ryan was a millionaire to lure Gillian away from Scott. Kelsey did not think her plan was working fast enough, so she called immigration on Gillian. Gillian was in the states on a visitor’s visa. If she did not want to be deported, she needed to marry a man. Scott volunteered himself, but Gillian chose Ryan. But...\n\nRyan: Love changes everything.\n\nKelsey: You mean, you guys care about each other so much, you don't care that you're broke?\n\nGillian was shocked to learn that Ryan’s wealth was all a ruse. Ryan learned that Gillian was just as penniless as he. The young couple moved into Wildwind, where the bickering never seemed to end.\n\nAfter a year, when Gillian’s immigration status was confirmed, Ryan was free to go with a dowry from his own account. Gillian thought Ryan was sticking around because immigration was still investigating them.\n\nAt Wildwind, he became good friends with Hayley Vaughan. Gillian found herself jealous over Ryan’s relationship with Hayley Vaughan.\n\nBut, Gillian did not want to admit that she was growing very smitten with her new husband. Ryan did not want to admit it, but he too was beginning to like being married to Gillian.\n\nRyan was accused of the rape of Kit Fisher Montgomery. He was surprised when Gillian decided to go on the run with him. They admitted their love for each other. Derek Frye arrived at the Crystal Ball to arrest Ryan. Hayley helped Gillian and Ryan escape the authorities.\n\nGifs\n\nFanfiction\n\n\"This Time Around\"\n\nhttps://jaimeb80.tripod.com/id19.htm\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20030204...an/Fanfic.html\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20011120...1/TTAmenu.html\n\nhttps://www.voy.com/60798/4/\n\nRyan and Gillian Fanfic Page\n\nLove Conquers All\n\nThe Way It Should of Gone\n\nR&G A Love Story Fanfic Page\n\nA Place in the Sun\n\nWhat Really Matters\n\nMusic used in Ryan and Gillian scenes\n\n\"Let's Get It On\" - Marvin Gaye\n\n\"Protection\" - Massive Attack\n\n\"Miles to Go\" - Celine Dion\n\n\"It Had To Be You\" - Harry Connick Jr.\n\n\"Hunger\" - Janis Ian\n\n\"Substitute for Love\" - Madonna\n\n\"I'm Ready\" - Dave Koz\n\n\"State of Grace\" - Seal\n\n\"My All\" - Kirk Whalum\n\n\"Anytime\" - Kirk Whalum\n\n\"Absence of Fear\" - Jewel\n\n\"Casi Un Bolero\" - Ricky Martin\n\n\"Whenever Wherever Whatever\" - Maxwell\n\n\"Do It To Me One More Time\" - Captain and Tenille\n\n\"Back Here\" - BBMak\n\n\"Sensitive Mood\" - Kevin Edmonds\n\n\"I Wanna Be With You\" - Mandy Moore\n\n\"Lady Lay Your Body\" - Carl Thomas\n\n\"Hold on to Me\" - Nina Gordon\n\n\"Come as You Are\" - Eric Benet\n\n\"With Arms Wide Open\" - Creed\n\n\"Why\" - Annie Lennox\n\n\"Spend My Life With You\" - Eric Benet\n\n\"I Need You Tonight\" - Backstreet Boys\n\n\"Back For Good\" - Take That\n\n\"Ghost of You and Me\" - BB Mack\n\n\"Adagio\" - Lara Fabian\n\nLast edited by tslpsh; 01-01-2022 at 10:04 PM"
