        "text": "(SoapOperaNetwork.com) — \"All My Children's\" Melissa Claire Egan bids adieu as her loose cannon character takes a final bow in Pine Valley this week.\n\nMelissa Claire Egan wraps up her \"All My Children\" stint as Annie Novak is slated to end on Monday, March 21. The Emmy-nominated actress started on the soap as the warmly received but rather docile blond in July of 2006 and turned into a much more popular but crazy, and we do mean crazy, brunette bombshell by 2008. For Annie, the stint included no less than four wedding ceremonies (Ryan Lavery; invalid, Ryan Lavery; valid, Adam Chandler, and Scott Chandler), two of which were on location, committing two murders (brother Richie Novak, and JR Chandler's aunt Di Henry), numerous assaults and murder attempts including the stabbing of the Erica Kane (played by soap icon Susan Lucci), a couple of institutionalization's, several instances of going on the run, two miscarriages, two imaginary enemies and one accidental shooting of her baby-daddy, Ryan.\n\nEgan's co-stars will miss this \"AMC\" breakout star as much as she'll miss them, but are confident the actress is headed for big things. On her departure, Alicia Minshew, who has played Kendall Hart Slater since 2002, notes that while the exit of Egan is \"such a huge loss\" for the show that she knows her friend will \"go on to do great things\". Jacob Young, who played Annie's last love interest JR Chandler, adds that while he too knows Egan's \"gonna go out there and become a megastar…it's tearful [for him]\" to lose her. On her last day, the actor wrote his co-star a lovely note expressing his gratitude for her."
