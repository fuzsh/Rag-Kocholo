The celebrity‘s death was confirmed by her manager and publicist, who said they were ‘heartbroken’ about her passing. Sadly, Esta joins the TV stars we’ve had to say goodbye to this year, but they won’t be forgotten. At this time, the cause of death is unknown.\n\nEsta TerBlanche was ‘kind, loving and giving’, says her manager\n\nEsta TerBlanche’s death was confirmed by her manager yesterday, Sunday, July 21.\n\nAnnie Spoliansky said: “We are deeply saddened by this news. As for a personal statement, I’d like to say that Esta was such a kind, loving, giving, and caring person.\n\n“She cared so deeply for all people and animals.\n\n“She had squirrels she fed and looked after daily, her two cats and recent kittens that she cared for as her own children.”\n\n“Esta was never anything but generous and lovely to me, and I’m grateful to have known her for the time that I did, and devastated to learn of her passing.”\n\nHer publicist, Lisa Rodrigo, said she was ‘heartbroken’ over Esta TerBlanche’s death.\n\nShe added: “She was and always will be a beautiful soul who I will miss every day. I am proud to have known her and call her not only a client but a friend.”\n\nRest in peace, my ‘Sweet Princess’\n\nEsta played Gillian Andrassy Lavery on All My Children between 1997 and 2001. Gillian was a Hungarian princess who married Ryan Lavery, played by Cameron Matthison.\n\nThe 54-year-old TV star penned a tribute to the celebrity on his Instagram Stories yesterday after hearing the news.\n\nHe wrote: “RIP my Sweet Princess” and posted photos of the couple posing together on the soap show with broken heart emojis over the top.\n\nHe said in another picture of the pair, which appeared to be a recent selfie: “Esta helped me last year when Red was sick and paralyzed and I was struggling.\n\n“One of the sweetest people ever.”\n\nMiss South Africa to Hungarian Princess\n\nThe actress held the title of Miss Teen South Africa in 1991 before she decided to jump into the acting world.\n\nBorn in South Africa in 1973, she was cast in Egoli: Place of Gold as Bienkie Naude Hartman before nabbing a part in All My Children.\n\nHer other credits include Three Thieves and a Wedding in 1991, and appearing in a short in 2013, Germination. Esta also played Gillian in Spin City in 1997 for an episode."
