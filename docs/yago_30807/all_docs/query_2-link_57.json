        "text": "Sept. 19 (UPI) -- Cameron Mathison is sharing \"good news\" with fans following a successful surgery.\n\nThe 50-year-old actor and television personality gave an update Thursday in a statement to ABC News after undergoing surgery for kidney cancer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMathison said surgeons were able to completely remove a tumor from his right kidney and leave 80 percent of the organ intact.\n\n\"We got the pathology report back yesterday ... and it's very good news. It's the least aggressive form of kidney cancer ... [with a] very low rate of recurring,\" he said.\n\nMathison, an actor known for playing Ryan Lavery on All My Children and a former Good Morning America correspondent, announced this month that he was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma.\n\n\"The good news is that it hasn't spread to any other organs,\" he wrote on Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMathison had surgery Sept. 12 and thanked fans for their support in an Instagram post Monday.\n\n\"Unbelievably grateful to be back home after a successful partial nephrectomy surgery. It was an eventful 4 days in the hospital, and doing well at home now,\" the star wrote.\n\n\"Thank you to everyone sending prayers, positive thoughts, flowers, cards, stuffed animals, food, love ... and kidney beans,\" he added. \"Love you guys.\""
