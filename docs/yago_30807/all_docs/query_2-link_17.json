He has a daughter with ex-wife Annie Lavery, a son with Kendall Hart, and is married to Kendall's best friend and sometimes enemy Greenlee Smythe. (en)\n\ndbp:quote\n\nWhat Ryan and Kendall have is a serious connection. It was there before; it will be there tomorrow. It's there when they're fighting, it's there when they're happy. It's always there. I think that's the big difference between what Ryan and Kendall have and what Zach and Kendall have. Zach and Kendall have something incredible, but it's not a connection that Ryan and Kendall have. And I'm not talking about a love connection. (en)"
