        "text": "ALL MY CHILDREN’s Annie isn’t the only one who’s had to deal with a loony family member. Here’s a list of the soap’s crazy family ties.\n\nThe Lavery Family\n\nRyan Lavery has had to deal with not one, but two deranged brothers. He was almost convicted for the rape of Kit Fisher when brother Braden arrived in town and committed the act. Braden was later murdered by the third Lavery brother, Jonathan. Braden’s murder was hardly Jonathan’s only crime, however. During his tenure in Pine Valley, Jonathan abused his girlfriend, Maggie Stone, poisoned Greenlee Smythe, murdered Edmund Grey, and kidnapped Greenlee, Kendall Hart and Lily Montgomery. It was later revealed that all of his actions were the result of a brain tumor, and after surgery, he was eventually able to lead a normal life.\n\nThe Chandler Family\n\nAlthough Stuart is now the “good” twin, that wasn’t always the case. When viewers first met Stuart, Adam had him locked up in the West Wing of the Chandler manse. During this time — as Stuart was considered “slow” mentally, and was easily persuaded to do things by his brother, Adam — he tried to kill both Erica Kane and Palmer Cortlandt. Eventually it was revealed that Stuart was the kind-hearted twin with whom fans are familiar today. Adam, on the other hand, has always been devious. Among his crimes: He tried to drive Dixie Cooney crazy and had her committed; he hired someone to kill Palmer; he replaced Jake Martin’s sperm with his own so that he could father Liza Colby’s baby; he kidnapped newborn Jenny Martin; and, of course, he has blackmailed numerous people.\n\nThe Cambias Family\n\nLong before Zach Slater arrived in town, his brother, Michael Cambias, was there, torturing Zach’s future family. He attempted to rape both Erica and Kendall, and did rape Bianca Montgomery. In the end, he was killed by Bianca, in self-defense, when he tried to rape her a second time.\n\nThe Novak Family\n\nAnnie is falling to pieces before our very eyes, but her brother was already long gone when he came to Pine Valley. Richie Novak came to town under the alias of Wes, and proceeded to torture all kinds of people. First, he paid a man to rob Babe Carey at knifepoint, then he kidnapped JR Chandler, stole his bone marrow, and set up JR to make it look like he’d slept with a prostitute. When the truth came out and he was arrested, he blackmailed Annie into paying his bail. Once out on bail, he kidnapped Babe. But that same night, Richie met his fate when Annie finally snapped and killed him."
