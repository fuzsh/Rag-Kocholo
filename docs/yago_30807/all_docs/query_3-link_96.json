        "text": "Image: The Movie DB\n\nAbout This Quiz\n\nDo you consider Erica Kane to be one of the most important characters to ever grace a television screen? Remember which beloved teen star played the role of Kendall Hart? Did you have more fun watching the wedding of Cliff and Nina, or of Jenny and Greg, than you did at any real-life wedding you've attended? If so, you might have what it takes to ace this \"All My Children\" quiz!\n\nSoap operas have been around since the 1930s, when soap manufacturing companies sponsored over-the-top melodramatic radio programs to hook bored housewives. The growth of television over the next few decades only increased the popularity of these programs. By the '70s, when \"All My Children\" premiered on ABC, an estimated 35 million Americans were tuning in to watch at least one soap each day. Even as the popularity of the genre ebbed and flowed over time, \"All My Children\" held strong, and ultimately stayed in production for a staggering 43 years.\n\nWith well over 10,000 episodes on the books, the show stopped at pretty much nothing to keep viewers tuning in to see what the residents of Pine Valley were up to. There was Erica Kane, evoking the \"Don't you know who I am?\" defense against an attacking grizzly bear, an evil doctor distributing a drug that caused a local sex craze, Erica's secret daughter showing up, Natalie getting stuck in that well, and of course, Jesse dying - then coming back to life 20 years later.\n\nThe series also touched on some real-life issues, like a 1973 abortion and Bianca coming out as gay in 2000.\n\nThink you remember all the daytime drama from this series? Prove it with this quiz!\n\nLet's start this quiz off with an obvious but difficult question: Can you name the husbands of Erica Kane, in order?\n\nJeff Martin, Phillip Brent, Tom Cudahy, Adam Chandler, Mike Roy, Jeremy Hunter, Travis Montgomery, Adam Chandler (again), Jackson Montgomery, Dimitri Marick, Jackson Montgomery (again).\n\nJeff Martin, Phillip Brent, Tom Cudahy, Adam Chandler, Chris Stamp, Travis Montgomery, Jeremy Hunter, Adam Chandler (again), David Hayward, Travis Montgomery, Jackson Montgomery.\n\nJeff Martin, Tom Cudahy, Phillip Brent, Adam Chandler, Mike Roy, Jeremy Hunter, Travis Montgomery (twice), Adam Chandler (again), Dimitri Marick (twice), Jackson Montgomery.\n\nJeff Martin, Phillip Brent, Tom Cudahy, Adam Chandler, Mike Roy, Travis Montgomery (twice), Adam Chandler (again), Dimitri Marick (twice), Jackson Montgomery.\n\nErica's full name could arguably be Erica Kane Martin Brent Cudahy Chandler Roy Montgomery Montgomery Chandler Marick Marick Montgomery. However, Erica's first divorce from Adam Chandler was not properly executed, so her subsequent marriages to Mike Roy and Travis Montgomery were invalid. Her second marriage to Adam was a renewal of vows.\n\nIn the poem written by Agnes Nixon, creator of \"AMC,\" what is the line just before the final, \"You are All My Children\"?\n\n\"I am your mother and\"\n\n\"The Great and the Least,\"\n\n\"In Sickness and in Health,\"\n\n\"In Tragedy and Triumph,\"\n\nAgnes Nixon meant that we are all God's children.\n\nWho played the role of Kendall Hart, Erica Kane's daughter, from 1993 to 1995?\n\nRebecca Budig.\n\nAlicia Minshew.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar portrayed Kendall Hart from 1993 to 1995, then Alicia Minshew resurrected the character in 2002.
