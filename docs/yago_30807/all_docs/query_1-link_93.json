        "text": "How were they able to determine that the hook killer is attempting to kill anyone connected to Joss, when it's clearly ppl that are connected to Trina? Her mentor Ava, Joss (which ended up being Brando), her lawyer Diane, the guy who could've helped Trina's case, now her boyfriend Rory. Joss isn't even acting like anyone who has a killer after them, for she's too wrapped up in Dex and hiding it from Cameron. If it's the other lawyer in Trina's case, then that's a weak copout. If anything, the idea some of you had where Trina has somewhat of an alternate identity who's breaking from reality and is stabbing ppl without any knowledge of it is intriguing, however I don't think the writers nor the actress can handle a story of that magnitude.\n\nJmo, an organization for Scientology accused Disney of being hypocrites in 2018, during the Shiloh cult storyline, followed by Frank's \"refusal\" to give Michelle a raise (and instead asked her to take a pay cut) in 2019, resulting in her becoming irate with him while jumping ship to Y&R (where her friend Josh Griffith paid her what she wanted) combined with bts executive changes over the summer, prior to Johnny Wactor's exit, then Bob Iger's return, and now Marcus exiting, it's not too far of a reach for everyone who's connecting this to Scientology lol. Not saying the incident with Maura couldn't have been a reason, however the Scientology peddling has seemed to be a problem. Johnny Wactor was also accused of being an asshole to certain ppl, and he was a part of this group of \"good old boys\" that consisted of Mo, Steve, Ingo and Marcus, and look who's the last man standing lol\n\nThey need someone with gravitas and a commanding presence in the Nik role.\n\nTyler burned bridges and caused a lot of production problem$ with his behavior. However, stranger re-hires have happened in soap history and on tv in general (i.e. Charlie Sheen). The fact that DOOL hired him after GH despite his problems being known speaks to ratings being the number one concern and a multitude of sins being forgiven in the pursuit of ratings. Of course DOOL regretted it...\n\nI suppose there is a very slim chance they might give TC a limited opportunity that stipulates he be accompanied by a sober coach and only on a recurring basis as opposed to contract so they aren't locked in with him. His looks have faded so some of the attraction is gone. He looked rather dumpy on Mo's youtube show, in my opinion. Actually, his looks had faded even before he left GH, bloated, sweaty and looking older than his years. Personally, I'd rather they find someone else and make a sound decision this time not just who Maura liked kissing or whatever her lame reason for wanting MC was.\n\nI'm regifting a Christmas gift to you all 😃 these are soap opera blind items from Soap Opera Digest, courtesy of Soap Opera Network:\n\n1. Regarding the performer terrorizing the show's cast/crew, including \"unleashing their fury on. producers, directors, and other crew,\" the. magazine notes, \"Staff does their best to avoid. contact, but co-stars and key departments are. forced to smile and play nice to not upset. production. It's a tense situation.\"\n\n2. With COVID testing and positive outcomes becoming a regular part of our everyday lives, it's a wonder why \"This soap is keeping a lid on which cast member, who figures prominently in a current storyline, [that] tested positive for Covid and had to quarantine at home.\"\n\n3. According to the magazine, \"An actor declined to name his/her significant other, although that person's identity is prominently displayed on social media.\" The answer is maybe too evident if you ask us.\n\n4. A leading lady on her soap is threatened by the \"rising storyline prominence of a more recent hire.\"\n\n5. Meanwhile, two familiar faces will be \"on this soap in the coming weeks.\"\n\nR134 Sarah never really had serious issues with Maurice or Steve, she had slight disagreements with them, and she later vented about how there was a pay discrepancy when it came to her getting paid less than the both of them, though she didn't fault either one. Any issues with MB or SB were not nearly to the extent of her main issues with Wendy Riche, Bob Guza and Tony Geary, then in more recent years, Vanessa Marcil (they fell out after being friends for years). Tamara had the most issues with Maurice and Steve out of all the Carly's lol (along with her also having serious issues with Guza and Jill Farren Phelps).\n\nSarah's mental issues seemed to stem from being gaslighted by her ex, even if she had underlying issues before, he brought them to the surface. Some were saying she had somewhat of a mental breakdown and needed to stay away from social media outlets. He blackballed her career in soaps particularly with Sony and especially outside of soaps; she quit GH both times on her own, and she also quit ATWT, however things got a little tricky at Sony with B&B/Days (B&B dropped her from contract to recurring after a little over a year, in a \"storyline dictated decision\" then she was out almost immediately after that. She was fired from DAYS in yet another \"storyline dictated decision\" as a result of a hw change and Sony refused to rehire her at B&B or at Y&R). Sarah stated that Sony didn't want her on their shows as a result of being blackballed.\n\nYes Sarah was fired from Cold Case. They told her that she wasn't exactly a good fit without any further explanations given. Her termination was most likely because of her ex.\n\nR138 Tamara fell out with Steve and Maurice when their backstage antics and politics didn't exactly align or sit well with hers (tanking scenes; trying to get ppl fired; the favoritism they received, etc.) although she was close with Ted King (Lorenzo) who was another person that Maurice didn't particularly care for, and Alicia Leigh Willis (Courtney), so it was pretty cliquish when it came to Maurice/Steve's crew against Tamara's with Ted & Alicia's. However, Tamara has seemed to somewhat resolved her issues with them by the time she returned in 2017 (even though she was cast as Kim, Frank/ABC were planning to bring her back as Carly, for in early 2016, Laura Wright had planned to quit GH and join Y&R in the Fall of 2017, when her contract was up, however when her friend Jill Farren Phelps was fired from Y&R a year prior, that derailed her plans so she stayed at GH, so Kim was made for her, and she eventually fell out with Frank over the direction they took Kim in, resulting in her contract not being renewed) so no that's not the reason why she's leaving Days.\n\nR141 Correct I didn't read his book however those stories were legendary on the old soap message boards, where insiders would share bts gossip, storyline scoops, casting news before they made it to the mainstream soap media, everything in between. Maurice was jealous of CarLo taking off and yes Sonny & Sam flopped (similarly to how Jax & Sam flopped before them, only for Sam to finally take off in a pairing and shed somewhat of her image if being labeled as \"yet another Brenda Bot\" with Jason, breaking up Jason/Courtney, which actually had a fan base of their own. Jason/Elizabeth, Jason/Brenda had their legions of fans too, even though Jason/Brenda were a marriage of convenience and not actually a couple, had Vanessa chose to stay, they were going for a Brenda/Jason/Carly/Sonny/Skye/Jax sextet of sorts). Jason has always had more popular pairings than Sonny; Maurice wasn't expecting CarLo's popularity to be as big as it was; Guza had Carly & Sonny reunite (Guza and Tamara clashed- he hardly ever wrote in her favor; Chuck Pratt was her friend so he would do his best to write more favorably for Carly, as would Elizabeth Korte, who's always been a fan of Carly's, no matter who played her). That's when the Kristina paternity lie came out, and Sonny dumped Carly seemingly \"for good\" only for Sonny to then eventually meet and fall in love with Reese, which Maurice was hoping would be a big romance for Sonny, only for them to flop too. Jennifer Bransford's Carly would've reunited with Sonny, and he advocated for her to stay, though they were planning to get rid of her all along for Laura Wright, who's Carly was meant for Jax. Skate (Sonny & Kate) and his pairing with Claudia were two pairings that finally gave him buzz again in regards to being in a couple, and obviously of course Brenda's return in 2010.\n\nR143 Yes especially back in the day. And if the fans are vocal enough it could result in an actor being let go or a storyline dropped. Sometimes it's done on purpose; when Jennifer Bransford was hired as Carly in 2005, it came down to her, Sarah Buxton (Annie, Sunset Beach) and Jamie Luner (Peyton, Savannah). Jill and Brian Frons intentionally chose \"the worst\" out of the bunch, for Jill had planned to bring Laura on as Carly, however Laura's contract with Guiding Light wasn't up until Fall. To Jill's credit, she did ask Tamara to stay for at least six more months (which was how long it would take for LW to leave GL) however Tamara (who engaged in a screaming match with Jill on set, prior to leaving) refused. Jill then asked Sarah Brown to return for six months, and she refused as well. Jill knew Jennifer wouldn't take off with fans (which she didn't) so by the time it came down to bringing Laura on, fans were practically begging for Jennifer to be out (she did do a good job in Carly's breakdown story, however to some fans, that still wasn't good enough, and they wanted her terminated). Another example is when Guza tried to paint Nikolas and Liz in a bad light with their affair; if you can make a character unlikable enough, it can work to the show's favor in contract negotiations by highlighting how unfavorable they're faring with the public and/or focus groups. It backfired on Guza because Becky & Tyler both had strong fanbases, which really became evident when Becky was fired.\n\nThe Niz affair was meant to ruin Liz, R147. Nikolas didn’t get half the shit Liz got from that. From teary-eyed Lucky calling her every name in the book to Lulu publicly slut shaming her at GH. They wanted the viewers to turn on Liz so it would be easier to fire Becky. They had no idea how vocal her fanbase was. The most Rebecca Herbst has talked about this was on SOD’s podcast a few months back during her 25th anniversary. She didn’t name them by name but said Jill, Guza and Frons were “close minded”. She accepted her job back after Jill came to her and said a mistake was mad but made it known she wasn’t happy with how it was all handled. She was also asked to tell her fans to stop writing in/calling and she refused. Frons hated the character of Liz, didn’t understand her popularity. Before he became obsessed with Kelly Monaco, he was a huge Alicia Leigh Willis supporter which caused them to axe Jason/Liz for Jason/Courtney. Jason/Sam reunion in 2009 was also network mandated.\n\nR159 She was extremely close, even her husband Michael was excited about it, for he felt the same way, that she was being underutilized at GH. Frank was trying to low-ball her with contract negotiations so that's when Days took notice. Frank even had a few in mind as a recast Elizabeth, particularly Melissa Archer (Natalie, OLTL). Becky wasn't one of those that were close to Frank, for they barely spoke the whole four years he was there prior to those negotiations. Becky has always been known to be somewhat shy and quiet, so she wasn't always up under him like his \"niece\" Kirsten or besties Kelly Monaco (and former bestie Michelle). If Becky had went over to Days, that would've saved years of the Kate Mansi/Marci Miller back and forth along with Abigail's demise, for I think Becky would've stayed there (not always with Chad, however I think she'd still be there now).\n\nR165 Dawn of Day is what started the process to drive her out lol however when it came down to negotiations, she went to Frank asking for a pay raise, while Frank asked her to take a paycut, and wanted to slash her wardrobe budget (which was the highest). Frank wanted her gone by the time came for her to renegotiate her contract, or at least have her stay at a reduced rate, for he had grown tired of Michelle (allegedly) and was aware the backlash Nina had continuously received. Michelle was so livid with Frank that she called her good buddy Josh Griffith at Y&R after a \"rumored\" argument with Frank (which was probably built up from Dawn of Day lol along with the negotiations).\n\nGina T. definitely got screwed; her Phyllis had caught on with fans (more than Nina had caught on with GH fans) and some were not happy about Michelle returning to Y&R (including some of her co-workers; one being Sharon Case) though Josh gave her everything she wanted and wasn't going to get from Frank.\n\nBtw lol when Michelle left Y&R for GH, it was because she didn't like Jill Farren Phelps and wanted to escape from her lol so that's when Frank (and Ron) got her on GH in a \"surprise\" industry move. Although there were familiar faces who auditioned for Phyllis (Laura Leighton, Sydney from Melrose Place and Jamie Luner, Peyton from Savannah/Liza AMC) Jill chose her friend Gina, who was actually flying in from the East Coast during her run. Gina was still there under Mal Young and would still most likely be there now if not for Michelle/Josh Griffith. When Michelle left GH, Frank was considering casting either Eden Riegel (Bianca, AMC) or Alicia Minshew (Kendall, AMC) as Nina, with insiders laughing at both presumed decisions, saying how they were both too young to be Nina. That's when Cynthia entered however she wasn't first choice.\n\nR182 This is from Tony, in his own words, in an exit interview he did with Michael Logan, in 2015, for TV Guide:\n\nML: In sending you off, GH head writer Ron Carlivati undid two epic events. Mob Don Frank Smith, who was killed by Like, came back from the dead and so did Luke's grandson Jake, whom Like accidentally slaughtered in a car accident. How'd you feel about the revisionist history?\n\nTG: I loved that they brought back Emma Samms [Holly], Genie Francis [Laura], Jonathan Jackson [Lucky] and Nathan Parsons [Ethan] so I could work with them one last time, but I did not like the conceit that brought us all together. It was ill-conceived, cheesy and showed a lack of imagination. We saw Luke shoot Frank in the back over twenty years ago. And by the way, that character was old then. He would have been in his hundreds by now.\n\nML: And Jake?\n\nTG: The audience saw that little boy dead on the operating table, and his organs were harvested. I do not understand the value of disassembling two of the best stories we've told. I guess the point of bringing the child back from the dead was so Luke could be redeemed, but I never felt he needed that. I hate redemption. I'm sure there are audience members who didn't want him to be a child killer and so they're pleased, which is fine. But I was not thrilled.\n\nHere's Maurice's (with Bryan Craig, who was described as his \"hype man\" lol) comments a couple of weeks after Ron's firing, with Chad Duell there also, at a GH fan club event:\n\nMo: As you guys know, just to get some deep part then we'll get to some other part....We got rid of the writer. I'm not one to bash but the thing with him was, obviously, he wasn't a fan of mine....and that's a stupid thing.\n\n(With the crowd cheering in the background)\n\nBryan: You don't cross Sonny. Not Sonny.\n\nMo: The good news is, moving forward, I gotta tell you there's been some great stuff. So if you guys had any doubt about what's going to happen, I can tell you right now that the future looks so promising. This is the first time in I can't tell you how long that I can't wait to go to work, and work.\n\nDon't know how I said \"Like\" twice instead of Luke at R187 😆 and that's true R190 about Ron's storytelling; Frank had to rein him in certain times at OLTL and at GH, sometimes because of Frank not agreeing with certain ideas, network mandates, or even actors complaining. On the other hand, there were times where Ron had to actually rein Frank in at both OLTL and GH as well, with Ron making suggestions to Frank that he felt were necessary, for Frank had out there ideas as well.\n\nIt's funny you mentioned Luke & Laura, because he had this to say about that in the same interview:\n\nML: So we know your high points. What was the low points of your run at GH?\n\nTG: I just get really tired of the whole Luke-and-Laura thing. I think Genie would tell you the same. We've both been dragging the corpse of that relationship around for 30 years. I was able to insist on moving away from it, but being hyphenated as Luke-and-Laura has been a real pain in my ass. It irritates me that, no matter what I did on the show, no matter how many Emmys I won, I could never unhitch from that. Every time I was introduced anywhere in the last 33 years, they'd run the clip of that fucking wedding. It's like having your high school graduation picture dragged out. [Laughs] Nobody wants that! And yes, this is a guy who is biting the hand that has fed him. I fully understand that. I think at age 68 I'm allowed to say these things, and certainly now that I am no longer under contract.\n\nR210 So Heather killed two birds with one stone, or one hook by absolving Felicia and a mystery woman going on a killing spree. I did see them making Esme Felicia's; besides her and Mac both having similar storylines with long lost kids, I think another reason is they possibly didn't want to deal with the ramifications of tying a kid with Ryan to Felicia, which actually seems like a network mandated decision, seeing how Ryan tortured Felicia for years, it sort of fits their non-rapist/victim policy to not tie them to each other. Even though Ryan never raped Felicia, he victimized her, so that most likely didn't sit well with Disney. I also think at one point Trina having an alter through schizophrenia was considered, aiming to kill anyone close to Trina, though that really doesn't seem like something Disney would approve either. Brian Frons was able to approve more of those type of storylines when he was in charge however once he stepped down, there did seem to be more of a change towards less dark stories, which is sad because soaps are known for telling a combination of light & dark (as well as in between) stories. Not saying Frons was the best, however certain stories like Kristina's abusive boyfriend Kiefer or Michael's prison rape wouldn't able to make the airwaves today, which means we're actually moving backwards instead of forward.\n\nR215 IA and I still think they should've had Cameron Mathison as Steven Lars instead of casting him as Drew. Apparently they feel that Steven Lars isn't necessary enough to be on canvas however he had a close relationship with Liz, a brief dating history with Carly, an even more serious one with Olivia, GH could use another doctor, etc. Even though that would've made him and Rebecca Budig onscreen siblings lol in sort of a reverse situation of Melissa Claire Egan and Billy Miller portraying siblings on AMC then lovers on Y&R, I think some would've looked beyond the whole Ryan/Greenlee angle, especially since Rebecca B. is no longer on GH. This isn't a Liz story, nor a Heather, Jeff or Carolyn story, it's all about Finn, his frustration with Liz, his anger with Jeff. Did he even seem to be upset with his wife for cheating on him lol because she should be at fault too.\n\nSo Joss inherited Carly's promiscuous gene apparently lol if Dex turns out to be Brenda's son, I'm wondering if they'll retcon the racecar driver Alexander as his father and somehow make Sonny his dad, although Jax not Sonny was the one who would take trips to visit Brenda before she returned in 2010 iirc. Another angle they could go is when Brenda left Sonny in 2011, she wrote him a letter which I'm not sure if he read, so that could have been an admission of a pregnancy. A Sonny/Brenda offspring involved with one of Jax/Carly would have interesting potential if written right. Dex doesn't physically look the part of a Brenda/Sonny child however the story practically writes itself. Brenda's son was originally supposed to be Dante's and then Ron was considering having her possibly have one with Michael after they had presumably slept together, only for both stories to be nixed, with Maurice \"allegedly\" vetoing them.\n\nR226 Brenda sleeping with Michael and having a baby by him would be interesting lol except Maurice would have to come around since he didn't want them to tell that story the first time, then there's also the fact that LW might have an issue with Carly being a grandmother to one of Brenda's kids, given VM and LW's history of not getting along with each other lol however Maurice was rumored to be the main one who didn't like that story, or the one with Brenda having a son by Dante. It was something about him worrying that it would tarnish the Sonny & Brenda legacy, which he still seems to be holding on to, even though Vanessa hasn't been back in almost ten years. Since it was around the 50th anniversary when that incident with Michael occured, it would be funny if they had her come back with his baby around the 60th 😆\n\nR237 I must be 😆 it's so weird how quickly it changed course back then, idk if it was Frank, or the network mandating even further, but something shifted in a negative way. I know that having to let Jason go altered the outcome of his stories with Carly/Sonny & Britt, however I don't think that's enough to impact an entire show. It's almost like they just stopped trying and just started throwing everything against the wall just to see what would stick. You should just stay posting here lol because those other boards (especially Soap Central) are notorious for reporting ppl or having them blocked if your views don't align with their majority. I had to stop years ago (I was even blocked from Soap Central) from leaving comments anywhere else except for here. IA Joss was definitely in mini-Carly mode with that move she made lol Carly almost always compromised herself and her relationships for another man lol\n\nI think they'll move it to Hulu or Disney+ before they actually cancel it, seeing how Days is on Peacock, they'll try their own relocation to streaming format, then it'll be easier to cancel it from there if it doesn't perform well. Just like it'll be easier to get rid of Days from Peacock then it would've been to just flat out cancel it from NBC. GH is like a million viewers behind Y&R, B&B so there's pretty much no way for them to catch up with them unless they moved GH to CBS 😆 so yeah they're probably not going to be on ABC as long as they're going to be on CBS.\n\nR273 You're right he did lol for Frank has never really had much of an investment in Dante. When he first left back in 2016, it was because of Frank offering him a reduced rate contract with only five guarantees per month, and Dominic reportedly balked at such an offer and refused, so Dante was written out. He came back for a few guest appearances before Frank caved and let him return on a more permanent basis.\n\nAlso those are terrific points lol Willow is pretty insufferable especially since she's been with Michael and the whole waffling back and forth between him and Chase. As for Nina, even though that's what the audience wants, I don't think that's what Frank wants. Nina started off as a villain under Michelle then they watered her down to make her more worthy of being rooted for by victimizing her to be relatable and likable, which didn't necessarily work because a lot of ppl can't stand Michelle and/or her Nina. I think more ppl like Cynthia's Nina and he portrayal of Annie so they're expecting her to play like that lol except Frank/the writers don't want Nina to drive back down that crazy route, for they're positioning her as a heroine. The problem is that they're sort of weakening Nina because they don't have to make her crazy perse, yet they don't have to make her a victim either.\n\nR279 That's true lol she was sweet nurse Annie Dutton who was previously married to Dr. Rick Bauer (off screen I believe) then had an alcohol problem. Then she went off the deep end when her troubles got to her, primarily Reva returning from the \"dead.\" I do think she'll rock it as crazy bitch Nina except they're probably not trying to go there since Nina has always played her crazy cards under Michelle and they don't want to undo any growth Nina has accomplished since then. However if they do go that route, Sonny should be sympathetic seeing how he's bipolar when everyone else writes her off as psychotic. It would be fun to watch, except they just might not go there.\n\nR282 No seriously those were accurate assessments. Then eventually Carly's going to be forgiven by Michael and Drew; Sonny will probably be upset longer than them however he'll come around too. Nina will confide in Ava and they'll agree how nasty and despicable Carly is, although that's how they already feel lol and nothing much will come from it. Nina could get revenge however they're writing Nina as more of a heroine so I guess they're Even Stevens now lol Carly kept Nelle and Willow away from Nina, while Nina is keeping Sonny and the Metro Court from her lol (even though Nina did try to give both of them back to her)\n\nR335 I'm one of the main ones who's reported that Nelle was supposed to be Carly's daughter 😂 which she was, until Frank instructed the writers to not make her Carly's daughter, however he wanted her linked to Carly somehow, which is where the Frank Benson angle originated from. In the story, it wasn't necessarily that Carly had voluntarily given Nelle up, that was going to be what Nelle was led to believe, for Carly (like Nina) would've thought she was stillborn or blocked it out, maybe Frank sold the baby, etc. (I don't think they were planning to have Virginia giving her up)\n\nWhat I'm saying is that Frank still positioned her after Carly. Going back to when Nelle first arrived, how she was trying to undermine Carly, working under her, ultimately trying to destroy her life, attempting to (or pretending to) sleep with Carly's husband, then being involved with Michael, getting pregnant, etc. that was all based off of Carly's history with Bobbie, Tony, and AJ with Carly, Sonny, and Michael in those roles. Yes usually when someone is supposed to be a 2.0 version of a character, there is a relation, however, that's not always the case. There are characters who are based (either loosely or not) off other characters without any form of relation to them, on several other soaps. That's also why the Nelle backstory reveal happened in April of 2020, with the flashbacks, for Frank wanted that to air around the 24th anniversary of Carly's arrival in Port Charles. Frank thinks that Maxie is a 2.0 version of Erica Kane 😂 so he tends to see things differently than others. Since Chloe Lanier received such high praise for her portrayal of a young Pat Spencer, he kept her in mind, for he wanted to bring her back for a big role, which was a younger version of Carly. His problem was that he wanted to redo the Carly/AJ angle too, which was against what the writers were trying to do, which was have her as Carly's daughter. They even redid Carly falling down the stairs while pregnant with Sonny's baby when Nelle purposely fell and framed Carly for pushing her lol if Chloe wouldn't have asked to be let out of her contract, Frank would still be in the process of shoving her down everyone's throats.\n\nR338 😆 😆 other ppl have compared her to an Amish or Little House On The Prairie character so I see the comparison. Imo Esme is more of what Nelle should've or could've been, with a stronger actress in the role. IA that Chloe Lanier was underwhelming and less than stellar lol it also didn't help that she had developed somewhat of a \"big head\" on set. She let the accolades she received as Pat inflate her ego, so when Frank specifically handed the role of Nelle to her, the rumors were that she was walking around like she was younger Meryl Streep 😆 😆 which also led to her asking to be released early from her contract, hoping to go from one \"big break\" to an even bigger one outside of GH.\n\nWell Wendy Riche didn't get along with Sarah, and Bob Guza/Jill Farren Phelps grew to dislike Tamara, so Laura for one doesn't have those backstage problems lol also, Sarah and Tamara, along with Jennifer Bransford, seemed to have a vulnerability about them that they brought to Carly, which lacks in Laura's performances. She plays Carly like a mean girl, smirking through her scenes with an air of conceit. The previous Carly's played Carly as insecure with abandonment issues, making her more sympathetic and relatable. Even when they schemed, you could see where they were coming from and why they did certain things. LW's version is more like a former bully who's now morphed into a suburban soccer mom who still has that mean girl streak lol while there have been some who've stated that essentially Laura Wright is playing herself 😆 😆\n\nI never really cared for Tyler as Nikolas. And i certainly never appreciated what Tyler did with the character until I saw Marcus trying to the role and performing it so badly, Still can't believe they kept Marcus on for three years.\n\nThat's not to say I'm gung ho Tyler now. Just that I appreciate what he did with the role better.\n\nBut he burned his bridges at GH and Frank, wisely, won't have him back.\n\nI still say Coby Ryan McLaughlin would be great in the role. Adam Huss is doing a far better job than Marcus ever did.\n\n[quote]So Nik is really dead?\n\nYes, DEAD DEAD. Every one who dies in Port Charles ALWAYS stays dead. No one has ever come back from the dead in Port Charles.\n\n[quote]Was he already going to be killed off or was this decision made after Coloma was fired?\n\nAdam Huss has only been filling in as Nikolas for a little over a week. Obviously they decided to kill off Nikolas as a way to finally get rid of Coloma. That decision was made long before Coloma had his hissy fit and refused to shoot his final week of episodes.\n\n[quote]This seemed a little definite, with an actual body in the closet and a doctor (Austin) presumably confirming the death.\n\nYes, you're absolutely right. No writer would ever think of a way to undo that and bring Nikolas back to life at some point down the road.\n\nToo bad the Cassadine family isn't experienced with freezing people and then bringing them back to life later.\n\nI'm flashing back to Soapdish and Whoopi Goldberg's character of Rose Schwartz saying, \" He doesn't have a head. How am I suppose to write for a guy who doesn't have a head? He's got no lips, no vocal cords.\""
