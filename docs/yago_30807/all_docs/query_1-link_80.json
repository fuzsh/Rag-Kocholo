        "text": "Hello, ’02s!\n\nThis first update appeared on my television screen one night when I was watching Disney Plus with my kids. We had just started watching Explorer: Lake of Fire, a National Geographic documentary about a remote volcano in the far southern Atlantic ocean, when Freddie Wilkinson appeared on screen!\n\nFreddie was a climbing guide on the mission to explore the remote volcano Mount Michael on Saunders Island in the uninhabited South Sandwich archipelago. The documentary features Freddie leading volcanologists to the edge of and into Mount Michael to determine if the volcano has an active lava lake. Both the television documentary and the companion article Freddie authored in the November 2023 issue of National Geographic magazine are fascinating and worth checking out!\n\nI reached out to Freddie and he replied, “Needless to say, it was an honor to work with such a talented crew and have the opportunity to explore a completely unique landscape. Otherwise, I’m doing good living in the White Mountains of New Hampshire with my wife, Janet, and our kids, Casey and Oscar. Our climbing gym business Salt Pump Climbing Co. has locations in Scarborough, Maine, and Portsmouth, New Hampshire—stop by and say hi!”\n\nKristin (Shigley) Livingston and I met up in Essex, New York, with our families for the total solar eclipse on April 8. In between a couple of muddy hikes and prepping eclipse glasses and a pinhole camera we had a chance to stop by Jen (LaBerge) Hutchins’ house to say hello. The morning of the eclipse was a beautiful, clear day and we were in the very small village center at the local café getting ice cream for our kids when we bumped into Laura Grey, who was in Essex visiting her in-laws. Luckily, the line for ice cream was long, so the four of us had time to chat and reconnect before heading our separate ways to observe the truly spectacular natural phenomenon of the total solar eclipse. Three minutes of stunning totality and then—light, warmth, and back to reality.\n\nHappy summer, ’02s!\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 215 W 98th St., Apt. 12C, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s! I heard from so many classmates in the last couple months.\n\nLeyla King wrote, “My family and I have relocated from rural Tennessee to Austin, Texas. I’m excited to be in a city again where there are sure to be other Dartmouth alums, so if any of y’all are around here—we bought a house in South Austin—and would like to be in touch, shoot me an email at lkamalick@gmail.com (or find me on Facebook at Leyla Kamalick King).”\n\nNicole (Campbell) Daley recently joined the Allen & Overy (A&O) Boston office as a partner in the corporate and life sciences teams. After 18 years of practicing she’s excited to come to A&O to grow the Boston office while collaborating with clients and colleagues around the world.\n\nCaroline Pott filled me in on her truly remote work. After eight years managing a marine-protected area in the Caribbean, Caroline moved to an even smaller and more obscure island location in the Pacific. She now lives on Midway Atoll and serves as the deputy refuge manager for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. “It is like living in an aviary: Approximately 1 million albatross (two species) arrived for the winter breeding season shortly after I did—it is normal to have to dodge landing birds on my way around the island.” She can’t accept visitors but is back on Oahu, Hawaii, occasionally, so anyone there should let her know. She is very happy to have traded in her car for a bicycle.\n\nI bumped into Jesse Argon on my way to work this week and he shared that he and his wife, Gwen, just welcomed their second daughter, Isla, in October. Big sister Ava (2 years old) promptly told the entire Upper West Side, New York, about her baby!\n\nSeveral classmates went on trips together. Jared Craft spent an amazing MLK weekend powder skiing and reconnecting out in Utah with Cullen Knights, Dawson Brown, Bryon Friedman, Eric Reinhardt, and Danny Sanner. Everyone is doing well and the trip was great, with a couple feet of fresh snow while they were there.\n\nJen (Morgan) Glass wrote, “Cindy (Keppel) Turner and I just spent a week skiing in Niseko, Japan. We traveled with Cindy’s husband and two children, my husband, and some mutual friends they introduced us to while we were living in Sydney, Australia. Great food and great snow!”\n\nLastly, I received an update from the 8 School crew: “In January we had an 8 School (and company) reunion in Costa Rica that was originally planned for March of 2020—four years and one global pandemic later, we finally made it happen! The following ’02s met up in the surf and sun of Tamarindo for a long weekend filled with epic sunsets, beautiful beaches, ziplining with the howler monkeys, and lots and lots of quality pool time: Jen (Laberge) Hutchins, Julie (Cumming) Higgins, Sara Donahue, Kendra Tupper, Rose (Kraemer) Carpenter, Katie Cody, Erin (Byrne) Barnes, Melanie (Broad) Seymour, Heidi (Ellenbecker) Trimarco, Christine (Walker) Hilgendorf, Annie (Nash) Bing,and Kate Paolino. Looking forward to many more adventures with these amazing women—pura vida, baby!”\n\nHappy spring, ’02s. Keep sending your updates!\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 215 W 98th St., Apt. 12C, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s!\n\nI heard from our class president Phil Mone: “Hi from Washington, D.C., everyone, where I’ve lived since 2008. My wife, Zeina, and I welcomed a son, Rami, on May 4. We now have two boys (Ramsey and Rami) and two girls (Nora and Lina). I continue to practice energy regulatory law and serve on the board of a charity that provides relief and educational opportunities to children living in Palestinian refugee camps. Our favorite part of the year is when we are living with my parents on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, for about a month during the summer. I hope to move the family to a Boston suburb in a few years.”\n\nRebecca Freeman moved across the world in 2020! “Hello all. Is anyone living in New Zealand these days? I moved to Queenstown in 2020 and have been running my U.S. immigration law practice, San Francisco Law Group, remotely since then. Curious if there are any Kiwis among us!”\n\nKristin (Shigley) Livingston, husband Alex, and daughters Maya (10) and Violet (6) are moving back East from the Bay Area to Dover, Massachusetts, in August. Kristin is starting a new job as the director of orthopedic trauma at Boston Children’s Hospital in September.\n\nJon Sussman is our new Alumni Council representative, starting with the meeting this fall. Jon had this to say: “It’s a privilege to represent ’02s on the Alumni Council. I’ll do my part to elicit and amplify your views and to share with you what I learn about the present state of the College. No matter what your Dartmouth experience was like or where life has taken you since or how your perspectives on our alma mater may have evolved, each of us possesses insights that can enrich and enhance the institution. Please be in touch—I hope you share my sense of connection and pride in one another despite the time and distance between us.” Jon is looking forward to being our Alumni Council rep and invites your thoughts and feedback at jonathan.m.sussman@gmail.com.\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 215 W 98th St., Apt. 12C, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s!\n\nCongratulations are in order to several of our classmates!\n\nI heard from Katie Simon Boshoff, “Adam and I (and our 4-year-old Max) welcomed baby Olivia Margaret in March 2022 to the family—she is a feisty, energetic, opinionated little creature who is keeping us on our toes. Max is loving being a big brother and can’t wait to teach her how to ride a motorcycle (much to this pediatrician mom’s chagrin!). We are still in Lilongwe, Malawi, where I’m in my 11th year working for Baylor College of Medicine Children’s Foundation-Malawi as the medical director of our Tingathe outreach program. We have a guest wing ready and waiting for visitors who want to see the lake or go on safari!”\n\nJason Spitalnick writes, “I’ve been living in Denver for almost six years with my wife and daughter Elia and son Levi. After 15 years practicing at two different law firms, I recently joined the U.S. Securities and Exchange Council as counsel in the enforcement division in the Denver regional office.”\n\nJess (McIsaac) Petersen shared a personal triumph, “This year I achieved something that I honestly did not think was possible; I ran my first sub-three-hour marathon in Mesa, Arizona, in February, then went on to run a sub-2:55 lifetime personal best at the Boston Marathon in April. I didn’t become an athlete until well after college, so being able to compete at this level in my 40s really blows my mind and brings me so much joy. Hope you are all happy and healthy, class of ’02!”\n\nOur current Alumni Council representative Kendra Quincy (Kemp) Knauf also had some exciting news, “I had a baby! Her name is Samantha Blair Knauf. She is so interactive and curious about the world. I brought her with me to the Alumni Council meeting in the fall for our first mother-daughter overnight trip and am looking forward to future visits to campus together. She turns 1 in June.”\n\nFive of the seven ’02s in the Dartmouth Cords were back in Hanover in April for a make-up “25th” anniversary weekend for the a cappella group, which was founded in 1996. Aaron Fiske, Adam Green, Allan Mabardy, Conner McGee, and Jeff Hafner caught up with more than 30 Dartmouth Cords alumni and a great group of current students who did a perfect job humoring and indulging the “old” guys. Mike Breen and Ben Barnes were missed (next time!).\n\nI loved all these updates! Keep them coming, if you’re reading this right now and have never sent in an update before—now is the time! Submit your updates on our class website, 2002.dartmouth.org, or send me an email.\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 215 W 98th St., Apt. 12C, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s!\n\nI received several updates from our classmates recently.\n\nJamie (Merriman) Hanulec wrote, “In July Mike Hanulec and I got married in Kingston, New York. We were thrilled to have a lot of Dartmouth friends there, with Sylvie (Liberman) Vernick, Vanessa (Green) Sinders, Molly (Stutzman) Miranda, Jorge Miranda ’01, Adam Ziegfeld, Rohin Dhar and Allison Sydlaske ’03 helping us celebrate! We’re now living in Seattle and would love to connect with anyone in the Pacific Northwest.”\n\nCara Kinsey has been keeping up with Dartmouth alums from the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s: “I’m looking forward to New Year’s in Las Vegas with Heather Spiegel after spending Halloween with some ’12s in Portland, Maine; Veterans Day weekend with Kristin Fitzsimmons in Walla Walla, Washington; and Thanksgiving in N.Y.C. with a bunch of mid-’90s alums. While I’m happy for more of these in-person opportunities, I’m still enjoying regular zooming to connect with friends around the world, so reach out if you’re in the mood to connect.”\n\nDallas Alexander shared some exciting professional news, “This past fall sports season the Big East Conference invited me to take a step in a new direction with Division I athletics (building from previous experiences coaching and officiating field hockey) to serve as broadcast analyst for its field hockey conference tournament semi-finals streamed on the Big East Digital Network then the national FoxSports1 broadcast of the conference championship game! It was a phenomenal experience that opened the door to serve as game analyst a couple weeks later for one of the Division II NCAA national tournament quarterfinal games as well.”\n\nLynnie Rudner Correll moved this past summer to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where she’s taken a new position as a staff anesthesiologist at the British Columbia Children’s Hospital and a faculty position at the University of British Columbia in the department of anesthesiology, pharmacology, and therapeutics.\n\nCongratulations to all! Happy almost-spring, ’02s. Keep sending your news and notes!\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 215 W 98th St., Apt. 12C, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s!\n\nAnastasia (Lambert) Norman and her husband, David Norman, MALS ’06, just sent their youngest son (of three) off to kindergarten, which, after two years of remote learning during the pandemic, feels like a big milestone. Dave popped champagne (at never having to pay for daycare expenses again!) and Annie dyed her hair blue (to feel less old). Dave graduates from his master of social work program in May and looks forward to starting the first day of his third career.\n\nVanessa Green sent me a quick update: “After 20 years living and working in Washington, D.C., my husband and I just relocated to Indianapolis, Indiana, with our two boys (ages 5 and 7). We all are loving the change of pace!”\n\nI also heard from Lindsay (Nicholls) Mello: “I’ve published a children’s book called The Dream Fairy. Luna is a dream fairy. Each night she visits all the sleeping children to make sure they are dreaming sweet dreams. If a child is having a bad dream she whispers quietly into the child’s ear to lure out the bad dream and scoops it into a jar, closing it up tight. To ensure the child has sweet dreams, Luna leaves behind a magical dream flower. The Dream Fairy is a gentle, comforting bedtime story that is sure to bring all children sweet dreams. To purchase or get more info, visit www.dreamfairybook.com.”\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 215 W 98th St., Apt. 12C, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s!\n\nCharlotte (Baxter) Maines and Stanton Maines welcomed son Weston Robert on May 23; he joins brother Ryker, age 4. The new family of four lives in Seattle, where Charlotte is a director at Amazon overseeing the Fire TV business, including sales, engagement, monetization and advertising products, and engineering.\n\nI also heard from first-time contributor Emily Gomez-Hayes: “Hello, fellow ’02s! I’ve never actually sent an update. I’ve been practicing law in Pittsburgh since graduating from George Washington University Law School in 2007 and passing the Pennsylvania Bar. Before law school I took some time to travel the world a bit. After landing in Pittsburgh I met and married my husband, Eric (University of Pittsburgh ’91), in 2014 (with Catherine Kemp in attendance!) and welcomed our son, Evan, in December 2015 and our son, Elliott, in January 2018. Life is very full these days between solo practice and Cub Scout meetings. If you’re ever in Pittsburgh, reach out! It would be great to catch up.”\n\nAmanda Potter wrote, “I’m happy to share that I’ve begun a new position as Putnam assistant director of learning and community engagement at Vassar College Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center (where, in a small-world moment, the director is Bart Thurber, who was a curator at the Hood Museum for many years). Jeff Vardaro and I are very excited to explore the Hudson Valley, New York, together with our daughter, Ellie.”\n\nJorge Montalvo shared a couple of exciting updates, “Professionally, I will be profiled in Crain’s New York Business in its annual list of ‘Notable Hispanic Leaders.’ I’m also going to be ranked somewhere in City and State Magazine’s annual ‘Power List of the 100 Latino Leaders in New York State.’ Personally, I had the pleasure of attending Kevin Allen’s wedding, hosted at Mike Payette’s home. Additional Dartmouth folks in attendance were Christopher Allen, Melissa McDaniel ’01, Blake Ratcliff, and Niegel Smith (whose Flea Theater in Lower Manhattan is going through a revival this year) as well as their associated families and children. Earlier in the quarter Frank Yoshida joined the group for the bachelor party.”\n\nThanks for all the great news! Visit us at 2002.dartmouth.org to submit an update of your own.\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 215 W 98th St., Apt. 12C, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s! Plenty of happy news to report this time.\n\nSyeda Saleela Khanum Salahuddin and her husband, Blake Everett Johnson, along with their daughters, Sufyana and Aydina, have welcomed to their family a beautiful and sweet baby girl, Syeda Wilaya Suraiya Johnson, who was born on June 11, 2021, in Washington, D.C. Baby is doing well and adored by her big sisters!\n\nSarah Winzelberg Olson and Ben Olson welcomed Vivian Marie on February 9. Mother and daughter are both doing well. Aria (2 1/2 years old) is very excited to be a big sister.\n\nMolly (Stutzman) Miranda shared her joyous news, “Jorge Miranda ’01 and I welcomed Sophia Blair Miranda on January 30. We are smitten with her and enjoying these snuggly and hazy newborn days. She is also getting lots of love from her older siblings—Eloise, 7; Oliver, 5; and Theo, 3. We continue to enjoy life in the Bay Area (Alameda), where I’m with Google (chief of staff, people development) and Jorge is with the KIPP Foundation (senior director of high schools). If you’re ever in the area please let us know!”\n\nEric Powers revealed his sense of humor has come through the pandemic intact writing: “To spice up the relatively mundane last two years, my wife (Elizabeth McDonald, Georgetown ’04) and I had our third kid last March. Cate is almost 1 year old now, and in true third kid fashion she’s the most agreeable of the bunch. A third kid, of course, requires additional childcare, so we also added an au pair from Austria in September. It’s a full house now, and our grocery bills have nearly doubled, but every day is exciting and morale around here is improving. We are also both very happily employed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Hope to see everyone in Hanover sometime before our 25th reunion in 2027.”\n\nStevie Nichols has made her way back stateside: “After six years overseas in Egypt and Spain with the U.S. State Department and two months in Hawaii visiting Christina Hoe, Aimee Barnes ’04, Mamie ’99 and Mike Lawrence Gallagher ’01, Jocelyn Leavitt ’01, and Elizabeth Hensley ’05, I’m returning home to my theater and legal communities in New Mexico. Come visit!”\n\nPlease keep sending in updates. Happy almost-20 years since graduation!\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 315 West 99th St., Apt. 2D, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHi, ’02s! I hope you all are having a pleasant holiday season.\n\nI heard from Jeff McDaniel, about his big move back to the United States: “My family and I moved back to New England in July following 10 years in Australia. I’ve commenced my new role as director of philanthropy at Mount Desert Island Hospital and will be leading a $50-plus-million capital campaign to expand and renovate the hospital. My wife, two daughters, and I are also delighted that we are buying a classic 1889 New England farmhouse in the historic village of Somesville, Maine. We hike all the time in Acadia National Park.”\n\nBill Meyer authored a new book that was published in November. The book is titled Healing Breath and offers a guided meditation for kids connecting them to the planet. “Breathe into the experience of waves on the ocean, trees in a forest, and the warmth of a desert, and feel your connection to all of life, from barnacles to baboons to falcons to farmers. This magical meditation-in-a-book is ideal for anyone who wants to simultaneously calm down and rise up to the world in all its wonders.”\n\nHappy New Year and best wishes for 2022! Please keep sending in updates, and if you’ve never submitted in the last 20 years, let this be the year you do!\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 315 West 99th St., Apt. 2D, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s!\n\nBrian Mann was named the director of athletics at William & Mary. Mann will be responsible for the daily operations of the athletics department and its approximately 500 student-athletes and 120 coaches and staff. He will oversee a departmental budget of nearly $30 million and the university’s 23 Division I varsity sports. Brian most recently was the senior associate athletics director at University of California, Berkeley, and previously worked in the athletics departments at Rice University and Dartmouth. His 5,912 career passing yards as quarterback for Dartmouth are third on the Big Green’s all-time list. Brian and his wife, Hilary, have a 10-week-old son, Russell, who will join him soon in Williamsburg, Virginia.\n\nLauren Fontein is one of the founders of the Artist Tree (theartisttree.com), a new cannabis retail and art-focused California cannabis brand. Their stores are unique, because each is a hybrid of a high-end retail boutique and an art gallery featuring rotating exhibits from local artists. They opened their first store in West Hollywood in November 2019 and two additional L.A. stores in April. They’ll be opening one of California’s first smoking lounges and entertainment venues this coming fall in West Hollywood. They also have additional stores opening in other California cities later this year. One of the upcoming locations, in El Sobrante, is also co-owned by a fellow Dartmouth grad, Adam Han ’03.\n\nI hope you all are well and keep sending in your updates!\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 315 West 99th St., Apt. 2D, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s!\n\nJulie (Cumming) Higgins sent me a lovely update: “I thought I would write to give an update for the Class Notes, I haven’t done so in a very long time, but was inspired recently by my grandfather, who was a ’39. Quite randomly, I came across some letters that he wrote during WW II that are archived at the Rauner Library. They are letters he wrote to his Dartmouth class secretary while serving in the Navy during the war. He diligently wrote every single year, with updates on his life and any classmates he had come across. It was crazy to read about his life during this time (1943-45), including learning that he was at sea during my dad’s birth. Since my last update we have had another child—Alice Higgins was born in 2018, joining her big brother and sister, Jack and Molly. We are still living in Boston and I get to see Rose (Kraemer) Carpenter, Mel Seymour, Sara Donahue, and Annie (Nash) Bing quite frequently, at least in non-pandemic times. We also just bought a vacation home in the Upper Valley and are really excited to spend more time up there!”\n\nMara Buchbinder reports that her book, Scripting Death: Stories of Assisted Dying in America, was published by the University of California Press Series in Public Anthropology in May. The book tells the story of what happened after Vermont legalized medical aid in dying in 2013. Mara says that the best part of her research was dragging her family to Vermont for several summers and frequently visiting Hanover.\n\nTy Roy-Garland and his husband, Brian, welcomed their son, Leo Sebastian, to Denver through surrogacy on March 3. It’s a little late for this season, but they’re already excited to get him on skis next year.\n\nI hope you all are well and keep sending in your updates!\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 315 West 99th St., Apt. 2D, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s! This month I decided to take a new approach of randomly selecting a small group of classmates from our class list and requesting updates. I only heard back from one classmate, so next time around I’ll expand the group!\n\nThanks so much to Tracy Keller for her response. “After four years back in Vermont at Green Mountain Valley School, my family and I (husband Dan, Wilson, 6, and Harper, 4) have settled into life on campus. We’re eager for the post-pandemic world so we can socialize with Sarah (Meyers) Pingree and her family, who now spend extensive time at their new home in the Mad River Valley.” Tracy mentioned she has also been enjoying many virtual cocktail hours with Dartmouth classmates—a pandemic feature I have also been a party to and one I sincerely hope continues as we inch toward normalcy.\n\nDavid Trouille has written a new book, Fútbol in the Park: Immigrants, Soccer and the Creation of Social Ties, published by the University of Chicago Press. The book takes the reader “into the world of Latino soccer players who regularly play in an upscale Los Angeles neighborhood where they are not always welcome. Together on the soccer field, sharing beers after the games, and occasionally exchanging taunts or blows, the men build relationships and a sense of who they are. Through these engrossing, revealing, and at times immortalizing activities, they forge new identities, friendships, and job opportunities, giving themselves a renewed sense of self-worth and community. As the United States becomes increasingly polarized over issues of immigration and culture, Fútbol in the Park offers a close look at the individual lives and experiences of migrants.” David played soccer at Dartmouth and is currently a professor of sociology at James Madison University.\n\nA bit of class news, our 20th reunion, which was originally scheduled for June 18-20, will be held virtually. Our next on-campus reunion will be our 25th in June 2027—but be on the lookout for information about other class events at Homecoming or mini-reunions once we are safely able to gather in person.\n\nI hope you all are well and please send in your updates!\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 315 West 99th St., Apt. 2D, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s!\n\nTasha Francis Gerasimow was named partner in the Chicago office of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, where she practices intellectual property law. She and her husband, David, welcomed their first child, a girl, in early 2020. Tasha and David recently enjoyed a quick weekend visit to Dartmouth to see the campus again in the fall.\n\nMolly Johnson and her husband, Jeff Hawkins, and two children moved from New York City to Vancouver, Canada, in July. The family loves beautiful Vancouver and they’re enjoying a life of more outside adventures and pandemic skiing.\n\nCharlie Trumbull, wife Hannah, and daughter Havana moved to Geneva, Switzerland, in August on a three-year assignment. Charlie is the deputy legal advisor at the U.S. mission to the United Nations in Geneva.\n\nJeff McDaniel wrote, “Meghan and I welcomed our second daughter, Jane Traveler McDaniel, to the world on September 4. Her big sister, Anne (8), has been amazing and we’ve already completed our first family trip to Tangalooma (Moreton Island off the coast of Australia). Can’t wait to be able to bring the girls back to the United States to visit the grandparents and aunts, uncles, and cousins.”\n\nMary Anne Mendenhall and her husband, Gordon Watson, welcomed their second son, Cary, on October 21. Cary joins brother Oscar, 19 months his senior.

Dartmouth alums who I’ve become ‘friends’ with on social media through other friends I’ve now had real conversations with on Zoom! I’ve spent hours discussing life and playing games. I’ve had intelligent conversations with people other than my cat. It’s been like mini-reunions every week!”\n\nMatt Jones filled me in on his many life changes: “Making up for lost time, I got married to Danielle Suarez (Hunter ’04), got a dog, bought a house, and celebrated the birth of my first child, all within about two years. This year will mark my 10 years since founding Molten Metal Works, a community metal shop in Los Angeles, teaching welding for sculpture, furniture, and general do-it-yourself.”\n\nOur 20th reunion is less than a year away—June 18-20, 2021. Mark your calendars and come help us with the planning— email dartmouthclassof2002@gmail.com to join the committee. You can also join us in the class Facebook group or follow us on Instagram @dartmouth2002 for more class news and information.\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 315 West 99th St., Apt. 2D, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHi, ’02s.\n\nThis is the year many of us turn 40, so I expect there will be many trips and celebrations with old friends from college—send me your best adventure stories and heartwarming moments.\n\n“Many of the ladies who spent senior year together at 7 Maple Street celebrated our 40th birthdays in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, at the end of January. J.T. (Leaird) Schiltz, Tucker (Ballard) Mahoney, Elizabeth Badger, Kate (Murphy) Voltz, Kate (Knowles) Frankel, Liz (Balanda) Baldwin,and Rebecca (Eley) Weeks rented a villa up in the hills over Mislamoya beach and spent four days realizing how little (thankfully) has changed since we met in 1998, despite having 16 kids between us (who stayed home with amazing grandparents) and no longer spending our time at crew practice. We can still talk for hours, count on each other to show up whenever one of us needs the others, and find time for pong tournaments, but now those happen overlooking the ocean. Five of the seven husbands with us were also Dartmouth grads: Dan Mahoney ’01, John Nichols ’01, Matt Frankel, Chris Baldwin, and Christian Weeks ’05.”\n\nIn February I traveled to Playa del Carmen with Allison (Stuntz) Schulte, Kristin (Shigley) Livingston, Mara Buchbinder,and Molly Johnson for a 40th birthday year celebration. We snorkeled in cenotes, dined on delicious local cuisine, floated around in the ocean waves, and generally spent four days talking nonstop. One evening was spent reminiscing with digitized photos from our time at Dartmouth and we realized how glad we are that smartphones and social media didn’t exist back then!\n\nTime with old friends is always a treat, so everyone mark your calendars for our 20th reunion in Hanover on June 18-20, 2021—a bit more than a year away. Planning officially begins this July, but we are starting to get the word out and asking around about who may be interested in helping plan. We’d like to have a 20th reunion planning committee in place by July. Please email dartmouthclassof2002@gmail.com if you are interested.\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 315 West 99th St., Apt. 2D, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHappy holidays, ’02s!\n\nLars Lynch had happy news to share: “Our daughter, Astrid, was just born in September, to the delight of her sisters, Sarai and Mayka, and brother Gael. I’ve been living in Spain since graduating from Dartmouth 17 years ago and currently live just outside Barcelona and work in information technology consulting. My wife, Joke Deschouwer, and I would love to meet up with any visitors traveling through Barcelona.”\n\nI heard from Caroline Pott about some stateside adventures: “I made a pilgrimage to the new Moosilauke Lodge in October to escape the heat of the Caribbean. Erica Mintzer graciously hosted me in Boston, and I saw Amy Schnitzer before she moved to the suburbs. At the new (and improved!) lodge, I also saw Rory Gawler ’05, who is still working magic at the DOC.” Caroline’s meager government biologist salary hasn’t put her in a position where she has an “estate” but she recently revised her IRA beneficiaries to include Dartmouth as a contingent beneficiary. She recommends it as a very painless way to include Dartmouth in your gift planning, even if you are of modest means.\n\nAmy Partridge was married to Saajan Chana at Mount Washington on October 13, 2019. There were tons of alums in attendance to enjoy the beautiful wedding and gorgeous fall foliage: Eli Diament, Sarah Finck, Russell King-Jones, Heidy Abreu ’04, Erin (Kinney) Dikmanis, Sushila Dalal, Rob Jensen, Amy Pogoriler ’00, Janice Kim, Deanna (Kasperski) Hill, and Yvette Nameth.\n\nCara Kinsey shared her news: “I recently bought a house in Springfield, Oregon. I feel like such an adult! I’m working as the teen services librarian at Springfield Public Library. I enjoy seeing Dartmouth friends in Seattle and Portland, and would love to see people in the greater Eugene-Springfield area. Let me know if you live here or are passing through!”\n\nHappy New Year!

Thomas joined us on July 2, making our daughter, Alice, a big sister. Thankfully, everyone is healthy and great. We’re adjusting to life as a family of four and enjoying fresh newborn snuggles. Love to the ’02 family.”\n\nThea Ellis was named one of the 2019 “Wonder Women in Streaming” by Multichannel News. Thea serves as the head of content acquisition for PlayStation Vue, “overseeing deals between Sony’s virtual multichannel video programming distributor and programs such as AMC Networks, Discovery, NBCUniversal, and Turner, among others.” Congratulations to Thea!\n\nMark Bubriski wrote “I spent the last days of my 30s with Dartmouth friends on a beautiful late summer weekend in Virginia. Dan Almeida, Mike Bergen, Allan Klinge, Charlie Trumbull, Patrick Granfield ’03, Brent Jones ’03, Will Zimmerman ’03, Ben Correa ’04, Dave Hoftiezer ’04, and Evan Lapinsky ’04 all got together to enjoy nice bourbon, eat a massive amount of BBQ, play some grass volleyball, and swim in a guitar-shaped pool. Couldn’t have been a more perfect way to celebrate getting old.”\n\nBill Meyer had two books published this year—one in April about mindfulness and schools (Three Breaths and Begin: A Guide to Meditation in the Classroom) and one this past summer for children (Big Breath: A Guided Meditation for Kids).Bill has been teaching for more than 15 years and lives in the New York City suburbs with his wife and two children, welcoming his second child, Eleanor Sophie, this past June.\n\nFor those of you in the New York City region, the Dartmouth football team will face Princeton in a match at Yankee Stadium on November 9.

The organization is a nonprofit focused on developing the next generation of science leaders to transcend disciplines, advance discovery, and solve the world’s most pressing problems.\n\nTracy Kim Horn launched a new business last year, Parfait—a modern version of the ice cream truck. “I make soft serve and paletas (Mexican-style ice pops featuring fruit) from scratch with mostly local ingredients and all-natural sweeteners (local honey, Vermont maple syrup, and organic dates). And for the parents who buy these treats for their kids, I have nitro coffee and kombucha on tap too. My engineering degree came in handy while designing the retrofitting of an old U.S. Postal Service mail truck that I got at auction and converted into a board of health-approved mobile food facility. You can follow the truck on Instagram @parfaitplease to follow the fun and crazy adventures of a new food truck.”\n\nAfter nearly two decades in and around city and state government in New York, Jorge Montalvo has taken a new job as the new chief operating officer for the Physician Affiliate Group of New York, which employs the doctors and allied health professions in most of the city public hospitals and clinics as well as on Rikers Island. Jorge added, “I also recently joined the Agitators advisory committee for Niegel Smith’s Flea Theater, so don’t be surprised if I start hitting people up more for seeing shows at their new, beautiful facility in lower Manhattan.”\n\nAnne Delaney is living in Seattle and working at a wealth management company. Last September she married Brad Bashaw, with classmates Maxine Goldstein Hynes and Sylvie Liberman Vernick in attendance at the wedding. Brad and Anne took a lovely honeymoon boat trip through the San Juan Islands and Canadian Gulf Islands. And on April 21 they welcomed a son, Henry Spencer Bashaw.\n\nRyker Claflin Maines, son (and first child) of Charlotte Baxter and Stanton Maines, is almost 1 year old (born September 2018). “We waited to submit to Class Notes to be sure we wanted to keep him, but he’s pretty cute.”\n\nMary Anne Mendenhall and husband Gordon Watson welcomed son Oscar Thomas Watson on March 1 in New York City. The family lives in Brooklyn and Mary Anne is in her 11th year at the Bronx Defenders, where she will return this fall after spending her maternity leave in San Diego.\n\nMark your calendars for Dartmouth Homecoming Weekend this fall, October 11 and 12!\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 315 West 99th St., Apt. 2D, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s!\n\nI put out a very last minute plea on Facebook for submissions, and you ’02s came through for me!\n\nSam Reisner and his wife, Mariah (Wesleyan ’04), along with big sister Aviva, are pleased to announce the birth of Zohana Grace Reisner. She was born on June 19, 2017, at 8:02 a.m., weighing 8 pounds, 7.5 ounces. The happy family is still doing well two years later and they recently moved to Farmington, Connecticut. Sam has started a new position in Disney’s new direct-to-consumer and international segment as director of technology strategy in the office of the chief technology officer.\n\nStephanie Kahn Scheinkman on February 13 gave birth to her second son, Noah Beck Scheinkman, named for his Aunt Rebecca, who passed away in December of stage IV metastatic breast cancer.

He’s adorable, a lot of fun, and great at keeping his parents awake at night!\n\nMaya Martin Cadogan shared, “My mother and I were featured in a chapter of Harvard professor Ronald Ferguson’s new book, The Formula: Unlocking the Secrets to Raising Highly Successful Children. The book details Ferguson’s research about eight roles parents can play to support their child(ren). Our chapter is called ‘The Negotiator’ and is about teaching a child to self-advocate, which my mother did expertly well—allowing me to advocate for a different, experienced teacher for my entire class in third grade. All kudos go to my mom, and it’s little wonder that today I founded an organization, Parents Amplifying Voices in Education (PAVE), to provide collective space for parents to be the leaders they already are and advocate for their own children and all of the children in D.C.’s public education system.”\n\nLastly, I ran into Mike Bergen at our 20th high school reunion this past fall in Darien, Connecticut. Mike moved to Darien last August with his wife, Heidi, and their children, Jackson (3) and Juliana (1). It was great to catch up with him!\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 315 West 99th St., Apt. 2D, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s! Aaron Pumerantz and his wife, Christa, welcomed a son, Grant James, on May 4, 2018. He joins big sister Gracyn, who is 3.

They live in rural Tennessee at the University of the South in Sewanee (about 50 miles north of Chattanooga), where Leyla teaches beginning Arabic in addition to her work as a priest at Thankful Memorial Episcopal Church in Chattanooga. She would love to see any Dartmouth alums who happen to be passing through!\n\nSarah Weiner sent me an update about her recent move and classmates that she’s seen recently: “I’m moving to Portland in October, and have reconnected with Andreas Stavrapolous, staying with him, his lovely wife, and their 6-month-old daughter, Sybil, on my house-hunting trips. I’d love to meet up with any Portland-area ’02s. I am still running the Good Food Foundation and recently traveled to Italy with Alice Waters, an honorary ’04, for a big Slow Food gathering. I have been collaborating with Sue AnderBois ’05, now Rhode Island’s director of food strategy. This summer in New York I saw Michael Rozas, her husband, Bruno Carvalho ’04, and their smiley baby, Lola. They were getting ready to move to Boston, where Bruno has taken a tenured position at Harvard. Michael is an architect (working on some of the Harvard buildings!) and glowing new mom. Last year I also stopped in to Denver to see Nicolette Krickl and her gorgeous and hilarious mini-me, Naia Indigo Rose, who is about 4.”\n\nCongratulations to all!\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 315 West 99th St., Apt. 2D, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s!\n\nKatie Simon Boshoff and her husband, Adam Boshoff, welcomed son Max on July 19 in Johannesburg, South Africa.

It will be a field guide to the species and natural history of the area, and designed for use in environmental studies courses and for the general public. I’m doing all the photography of organisms, habitats, and ecosystems in addition to the writing, and its working title is A Field Guide to the Biodiversity of the Chicago Region. The publisher is Blue Door Publishing out of Minneapolis, and it should be ready by January 2019!”\n\nCongratulations to all!\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 315 West 99th St., Apt. 2D, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s!

I’ve moved to Brookline, Massachusetts, and starting in July I will be an academic hospitalist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and faculty at Harvard Medical School. I hope my Boston-area friends reach out—I’d love to reconnect with people!”\n\nOur class representative to the Alumni Council, Lauren (Smalkowski) Klentak, filled me in on her busy spring: “In April I enjoyed a fun-filled girls weekend with Lindsay (Jernigan) Bateman, Carla (Giugliano) Oddy, Melanie (Schechter) Posner, Kristen von Minden, and Kate (Douglas) Parkin ’03. Everyone flew in from coast to coast for a mini-reunion in Nashville, Tennessee, where many laughs were shared over our favorite country music songs.\n\n“In May I attended the 216th Alumni Council meeting in Hanover and got well-informed about the Call to Lead Campaign while catching a glimpse of my first Green Key Weekend since graduation.

When I was in Hanover last summer, I stopped by the Co-op for the obligatory green Dartmouth onesies.\n\n“Summer of 2017 also allowed me to see Dave Reed and his wife, Anna ’03, down at their house in Duxbury, Massachusetts. It was lovely to sit down to a home-cooked meal with their three children. Our Dartmouth Grant reunion occurs each year with Erik Wang, Matt Sullivan, Geoff Smith, Jeff Kinkaid ’01, Riley Lochridge, Clayton McClintock, and Kwabena Akowuah. We have gathered every year since 2002, mostly at the Grant, but as far away as California, Montana, and Virginia. We will be back in the Grant this summer. We often talk of when we will invite spouses and children, but our antics seem to prevent others from coming.\n\n“Joy (my wife, Westmont College ’01) and I spend significant time with Sarita Shoenebeck-Yardi and her family in the Ann Arbor area. In March we conducted an Easter egg hunt with a combined five children from both families, all 4 years of age and under.\n\nIn April Jason Taylor and I hiked Paria Canyon in Utah with a few close friends. It’s always good to be in the great outdoors with fellow alums. Ron June and I speak regularly. His family is doing well in Bozeman, Montana. He earned tenure recently and is gearing up for a sabbatical this summer to Spain.\n\n“I would love to hear from other alumni in the food and beverage industry, specifically on the manufacturing and research-and-development side (perhaps via LinkedIn).

I’d love to know how others took a path from Dartmouth into the food and beverage industry.”\n\nI also received a happy update from Jennifer (Ain) Lippman. Her son, Benjamin Reid Lippman, was born February 8.

Ciprotti filled me in on some big changes in her life, “This spring my boyfriend got a wonderful new job and we have moved from my beloved hometown of Atlanta to a new home in Seattle.

We are loving the ’burbs and have had the pleasure of seeing several Dartmouth grads around town, including grabbing dinner with Kate (Laswell) Mako and her husband, Jeremy. We are expecting kid No. 4 in January, which has thrown a wrench in our plans to do things like have a life apart from our kids, but it’s all good. Really!”\n\nHappy almost 2018!

We will be supplying the equestrian team with riders for the better part of the 2030s! So far little Bridget, at 10 days old, seems to be pretty relaxed about the mayhem that surrounds her. In our spare time (ha) Kevin is the chair of our town school board and I have earned a literacy specialist license and am learning to speak French in an attempt to keep up with Katie, who is in a French immersion program for first grade.”\n\nKate Cochrane has been picked to participate in the Lambda Literary Writers Retreat for Emerging LGBTQ Voices this summer.

Remember the glittery sparkling football that Lady Gaga caught as she leapt off the stage at the end of the Super Bowl halftime show? That ball was skillfully tossed to her by none other than our classmate Brian Mann. Brian, who was quarterback of the Dartmouth football team and holds the Dartmouth single-season record for passing yards, works at Rice University in Houston as associate athletics director. Just a few days before the Super Bowl, Lady Gaga’s team contacted the Rice athletics department looking for someone to make the throw. Brian was a natural choice, having prior performance experience as Adam Sandler’s stunt double in the remake of The Longest Yard and as quarterbacks in the films Invincible starring Mark Wahlberg and The Game Plan with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. After a few days of rehearsals and fine-tuning, the play was set for Super Bowl Sunday. “I was nervous I suppose. We had practiced it so many times, I felt like I knew where I had to put the football for her to catch it,” said Mann. “But there was one point during the show, where they tell everybody in the stadium to turn on their flashlights on their phones as a way to light up the stadium, and when that happened I realized just how big 70,000 people can look. Then I decided at that point to put my head down and worry about what I had to do and not look at the crowd.” The play was a great success and Mann came away from the experience with a new respect for Lady Gaga, “What I found one of the coolest things to be was the way she empowers young girls. You could hear that in her voice and what she said to them, to be themselves, to be individuals and love who they are.” Mann said the performer was very friendly and down to earth and it was an experience he won’t soon forget!\n\nAriel Diaz and his wife welcomed a daughter, Sophie Mia Diaz, on November 26, 2016.

(Leaird) Schiltz and her husband, Joe (Fordham ’04), welcomed their first child on December 7. Magnolia Alice Kay Schiltz was 6 pounds, 5 ounces and 20 1/4 inches.

A 24-week micropreemie, C.J. gained social media fame for his stunning good looks and overall scrappiness. After a 148-day stay in the neonatal intensive care unit at the University of Iowa Children’s Hospital, C.J. is now home starting work on his Dartmouth application for the class of 2038. The happy family lives in the Iowa City area, where Nicole is the director of development for the National Speech & Debate Association.\n\nIn 2009 Sarah Sommerfield and Justin Poitras got married. In 2010 Sarah was diagnosed with a very rare, incurable lung disease called lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). One of the things that has helped them cope with the diagnosis has been their love of travel, and for a while they considered taking a break from their normal lives to travel full-time. This June they did just that. They quit their jobs and left their comfortable apartment in Brooklyn, New York, to set off for a year to explore the world and raise awareness of LAM. Working with the LAM Foundation, Sarah is serving as its global LAM liaison to meet members of the international LAM community (patients, clinicians and researchers) to further the connections among the community and the search for a cure. They are documenting their journey at www.travelbreatherepeat.com. And they would love to meet up with Dartmouth alums too, so if you live abroad and would like to connect, email them at sarahpoitras@gmail.com or justinpoitras@gmail.com.\n\nLynnie Rudner was happy to accept a fellowship offer in pediatric anesthesia at the University of Rochester.

The couple is very excited to be there and can’t wait to start exploring their new home. If there are any other ’02s in the area, reach out!\n\nIn July Tracy Keller was named head of school at Green Mountain Valley School in Waitsfield, Vermont. Tracy was captain of the alpine ski team at Dartmouth and has worked for Sugar Bowl Ski Team and Academy for the past 14 years.

It was great to see so many of you at our reunion in June. Almost 200 ’02s showed up with their partners, spouses and children, living it up in the dorms like old times. Delicious dinners were catered both nights by Murphy’s. Two of our class historians, Lonnie Threatte and Brett Quimby, toasted us on the Bema, reminding us of what stays the same and what changes between graduation and today. We also elected a new class vice president, Eric Powers. Thanks to Jeff Hafner, Phil Mone, Kendra Quincy Knauf, Yelena Blackwell, Sarah Myers Pingree and the rest of the reunion committee for such an amazing time!\n\nOur reunion co-chair Kendra filled me in on her recent career change: “The past couple of years have been full of change since I returned to graduate school in mental health counseling for a second master’s degree. I spent almost a year working for a local crisis team and now am a clinician at a therapeutic school for students ranging in age from 8 to 22. I love this new direction my career has taken and I find the work rewarding in many ways.”\n\nA few weeks before she brought her new husband up to Dartmouth for reunion, J.T. Leaird married Joe Schiltz (Fordham ’04) on May 29 at the Allen Sheep Farm on Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts.

Xander was a bold, brilliant and charismatic individual and he will be deeply missed by his family and friends. I encourage you to share any memories, photos or condolences for his family on his memorial website at memorialwebsites.legacy.com/Alexander_Harrison/homepage.aspx. A full obituary will appear on the DAM website.\n\nXander was one of my first friends at Dartmouth and his death comes as quite a shock. His passing and seeing everyone at reunion serve as a reminder that while Dartmouth is clearly a very special place, the best part of the Dartmouth experience is all the amazing people, such as Xander, with whom we shared our college years. With that in mind, I encourage you to keep in touch, though ’round the girdled earth we roam.\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 315 West 99th St., Apt. 2D, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s! I received no submissions this time around so I had to go digging in the proverbial mailbag (i.e., news that the alumni magazine forwards me).\n\nBill Meyer recently authored a middle-grade historical adventure series, Horace j. Edwards and the Time Keepers. The first book in the series, The Secret of the Scarab Beetle, was released on April 1 and tells the story of an 11-year-old boy who finds himself transported to ancient Egypt. Bill currently lives with his wife in New York, where he is completing his Ph.D. at New York University and teaching his high school students about the mysteries of Ancient Egypt. For more information about his book series, visit www.horaceandthetimekeepers.com.\n\nFlinder Boyd tracked down baseball great Rafael Palmeiro and interviewed him for a long-form piece published by Fox Sports. According to his bio, “Flinder is a former European professional basketball player turned writer. His features have appeared at Newsweek, SBNation Longform, and the BBC, among others. On Twitter he can be found @FlinderBoyd.”\n\nThe Bangor Daily News published an update about Jenny Rottmann. “Jenny Rottmann has joined the Genesis Community Loan Fund as director of finance and administration, bringing more than a decade of experience in both nonprofit management and community-based work.

I’m happy to share lots of updates with you. Brett Quimby and his wife, Alyssa, welcomed their daughter, Emerson Jean Quimby, to their family in August. The family lives in Los Angeles, where Brett teaches middle and high school English and his wife practices medicine. They’re excited to see Emerson grow! Katie Lynch sent me her exciting news, “On January 19 my novel Confucius Jane will be released by Forge Books. The book is a blend of women’s fiction and romance with a dash of magical realism. More information is available at www.confuciusjane.com.” Great news out of Texas, where Aaron Pumerantz, now a major in the U.S. Army, was recently named chief of rheumatology at Fort Bliss. He and his wife, Christa, also welcomed their first child, daughter Gracyn Marie, on August 25, 2015. They are enjoying every minute of being her parents!\n\nCaroline Pott filled me in on ’02s she’s been seeing around the East Coast and her new job. “Another recent stint of a few years in Washington, D.C., allowed me to see much of that city’s permanent Dartmouth population. On a few work-related trips to State College I also saw Charlie White, Chris Moore and Mark Kissling, all of whom work for Penn State. In August I made the trip down to Charlotte, North Carolina, to see Molly Redmond, who is a biology professor at the University of North Carolina, and we visited the highest mountain east of the Mississippi. In September I was up in Hanover and at Moosilauke working on the ’66 Bunkhouse (featured in DAM Jan-Feb issue). I loved meeting both the older and younger alums, and of course wielding sharp tools and being overfed by the lodge. I also delighted in a homemade dinner and hike with Flora Krivak-Tetley, who’s working on her Ph.D. Shortly thereafter I packed two suitcases, a backpack and a pair of scuba fins for a new job on St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. I am managing the East End Marine Park for the Virgin Islands government. Having done very little research on the island before I came, I am pleasantly surprised that I love my new home so far: For a small island there is a ton going on, including a vibrant farm and restaurant scene, a university, rum distilleries, hikes to remote beaches, sea turtles, sailing, scuba diving, historical plantations—truly something for everyone. Beau McCoy was here over the holidays; Beau’s Dartmouth paraphernalia allowed us to meet two alums and the family of a current student within three days. I won’t make it to reunion this year, but Phil Mone, Merrielle Macleod and I are plotting a young(er) alum takeover of the annual Dartmouth Alumni Club of the Virgin Islands flotilla next May.”\n\nKatie Pasciucco and Yelena Blackwell bumped into each other in Brookline, Massachusetts. Yelena wrote, “Each of us welcomed a baby to the family recently! Katie’s little Karlie arrived on September 9 and my baby Alex joined us on October 13. Both Katie and I are amazed by how fast time is flying by and look forward to play dates soon!”\n\nOur 15th (14th) reunion is in less than two months. Hope to see you there!\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 315 West 99th St., Apt. 2D, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s. Hope everyone had a happy holiday season.\n\nKristin Wright sent along happy news, “We’ve been a little behind on the updating but wanted to share that we welcomed a new little boy, Kettler, last March! His big brother, Logan, has enjoyed having another playmate. We hope to see everyone in Hanover in June!”\n\nI also heard from Sarah Hughes: “I recently moved from New York City to Austin, Texas, to be closer to my family—particularly my twin. My job is the same, working for Deloitte Consulting in the strategy and operations practice. Austin folks, look me up!”\n\nNow that her youngest child is 2, Allyson Wendt decided it was a good time to start a business. So she launched Warp Weft, purveyors of fine sewn goods. Her feature product is a hand-waxed canvas bag with leather handles. Find her on Etsy under “Warp Weft Fiber Arts.”\n\nJeff Deck had a busy 2015. He married his long-time girlfriend, Jane Connolly (Smith ’05), on April Fools’ Day. He became a trustee for the New Hampshire Writers’ Project, a nonprofit organization promoting writers and literature in the Granite State. And he indie-published two novels as e-books on Amazon: Player Choice, a sci-fi gaming adventure, and The Pseudo-Chronicles of Mark Huntley, a serialized horror novel in blog format. He also reports that in 2015 Benjamin D. Herson graduated from the Epicodus school of programming in Portland, Oregon, and soon after landed a job as a web developer. Congratulations to Benjamin for his hard work and success in a new career.\n\nOne bit of class business: Tickets go on sale soon for our 15th (14th) reunion this June 17-19 in Hanover.

The wedding adventure started on a gorgeous boat in the Seattle Harbor, continued at a beautiful lodge on Bainbridge Island and then finished with more dancing and partying on the boat ride home. The weather was great and the weekend was spectacular!”\n\nDrew Lambert was married to Christina Beale on September 19 at Cedar Point Yacht Club in Westport, Connecticut.

Big brother Kai (two years and 12 days older) hasn’t missed a beat, loves touching Baby Sam’s toes, and enjoys holding her for about 12 seconds. Mom and dad are doing well and are adjusting to life with two kiddos!\n\nCharlie Trumbull married Hannah Molofsky on October 4, 2015, in Charleston, South Carolina. Despite historic rain, flooding and road closures, the wedding was perfect. A number of Dartmouth alums braved the storm to attend, including Allan Klinge, Sam Short, Michael Bergen, Andrew Langworthy and Melinda Moore, and Kip Eideberg, Adv’02.\n\nAllan Klinge also shared news that heand his wife, Sarah, welcomed home their baby girl, Sabine Soyul Klinge, from Korea in September. Sabine, 1 1/2 years old, joins big brother Carsten, 4, and the family in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\nMatthew Klentak was named as the general manager of the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team. Matt is the youngest GM in Phillies history! Matt and Lauren (Smalkowski) Klentak are currently living in California and are excited to return to the East Coast.\n\nBrian Jacobs finished his doctorate in French literature at Princeton in May. He is still loving teaching at the Lawrenceville School and is a housemaster this year.\n\nLast but certainly not least, Phil Mone, our wonderful class president, was married during Labor Day weekend to Zeina Kiblawi on Nantucket, Massachusetts, before immediate family and then traveled to Italy for their honeymoon. Phil writes, “My wife didn’t know anything about Dartmouth before I met her. I am slowly indoctrinating her. She has agreed to come to reunion, but is skeptical about my love for all things Hanover. I look forward to her meeting you all.”\n\nIn June the class of 2002 will celebrate our “15th” (technically it will be our 14th) reunion. Like our “10th” reunion in 2011, we will be clustered with the 2000s and the 2001s. So save June 17-19 as the date for our 15th reunion in Hanover. Stay tuned for more updates!

I heard from just a few classmates these past few months. Kristin (Shigley) Livingston is very excited to be moving back to the San Francisco Bay Area with her husband, Alex, and their 2-year-old daughter Maya. Kristin is looking forward to being on staff at the University of California San Francisco as a pediatric orthopedic surgeon.\n\nHeather Kofke-Egger and her wife, Carolyn Phillips (MIT ’99), welcomed a daughter, Maya Evelyn Phillips, at 3:23 p.m. on Sunday, June 14. Maya was 6 pounds, 15 ounces, and 20 inches long. Heather, Carolyn and Maya live in Chicago.\n\nLastly, Eric Powers sent a nice update about lots of big changes in his life: “After five mostly cold years in Chicago my family and I recently moved to Washington, D.C. It seems like everyone passes through Chicago every year or so, which I will miss, among many other great parts of the city. Before leaving I spent some time with Ed Freidheim and Robby Middleton, and also caught up with Bill Jaeger during his visit to the Windy City for a work conference. In D.C. my wife, Elizabeth McDonald (Georgetown ’04), and I both will be working for the U.S. Department of Justice. Liz will be working in the civil rights division. I will be a prosecutor in the tax division, criminal enforcement sections, where I will focus on financial, identity theft and tax crimes. Liz and I recently welcomed our son, Samuel James Powers, into the world. Sam is now 5 months and eagerly awaits his first visit to Dartmouth for our 15th (14th) college reunion next summer. Because my family and I apparently crave change, we also recently bought a house in McLean, Virginia. The only thing we didn’t do was get a dog, but that’s probably coming soon. Hope everyone is doing well.”\n\nAs this summer draws to a close I can’t help but think about our Sophomore Summer at Camp Dartmouth 15 years ago. If you have any stories from this summer, that summer or any other time, please share them!\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 315 West 99th St., Apt. 2D, New York, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s.

Sadly, in early December I was notified about the death of one of our classmates. Matthew Cooper passed away peacefully on November 30, 2014, at Yale-New Haven Hospital from complications following emergency surgery. Matt grew up in East Lyme, Connecticut, and at Dartmouth he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He was a graduate of the University of Virginia School of Law and a dedicated attorney with the firm Day Pitney LLP in Stamford, Connecticut. Matt is survived by his wife, Michelle Mauro Cooper, parents Bruce’74 and Kristi, brother Jonathan and wife Katherine and grandparents, including Milton ’46, DMS’45. Classmates remember Matt as a loyal friend who was quick to laugh and full of love for life. His full obituary can be read online on the DAM website, where you can also share remembrances.\n\nKatie (Escherich) Morison and her husband, Mark, welcomed a son, William Francis Morison, on April 10. William joins big sister Juliet, 3, and the family is moving soon to a new home in Rye, New York.

They have been friends for years and are pretty much like full-fledged siblings at this point. On a professional note, I am principal of a new K-4 public school, the Cove School in Corte Madera, California. The school design is different than traditional schools with learning suites, breakout rooms and outdoor learning spaces for small groups. This school has a focus on creativity and innovation, collaboration, critical thinking and communication. We have a most amazing group of teachers who see themselves as lead learners (love their growth mindset!). It’s been a busy couple of years!”\n\nMolly (Stutzman) Miranda and her husband, Jorge Miranda ’01, welcomed daughter Eloise Frances Miranda on October 11.

Molly, Jorge and Eloise are doing well and settling in to life as a family of three (well, five if you include the two cats).\n\nSam (Burdman) Weigand has had an exciting year as well: “The past 12 months have been a whirlwind, to say the least. In December my husband and I packed up the dog and the toddler to move from Washington, D.C., to Vashon, Washington, where we bought the only bakery in town. Not so crazy, considering I have spent the past 10 years as a pastry chef, but the timing was interesting. I took over the bakery in January 2014 and closed in March to renovate and have a baby. Xavier joined big sister Carmen on March 14, 2014! We reopened in May as Vashon Island Baking Co. and have been going strong since. Any alums in the Seattle-Tacoma area should definitely drop by to say hi!”\n\nThat’s all the news for now.

Big sister Abby adores her and we’re having lots of fun, but I will soon have to return to work as a primary care physician and assistant professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego. Seth continues to work as an assistant professor of political science at UCSD as well. We’re enjoying living in San Diego and are available for visitors if anyone needs to get away this winter!”\n\nJulia Levy and Ari Edelson (Yale ’98) welcomed a baby boy, Eliot Henry Edelson, on May 8, 2014. Julia, Ari and Eliot live in New York City, where they work together on their arts and culture startup, Culture Craver.\n\nI also heard from Megan Harrison Linn about two new additions to her family. Harrison Michael and Kennedy Allison were born August 20, two months early, so spent six weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit, but are now home and doing great.

He weighed 7 pounds, 11 ounces and was 20.5 inches long—which explains why I always felt like I was going to topple over! Everyone is home and doing well, resting up for summer fun, and in the fall I’ll return to work switching from pediatrics residency to anesthesia.”\n\nAlso on June 22, Molly Johnson gave birth to Georgia Talbot Hawkins after nudging her along with long walks and spicy food. Georgia was 8 pounds, 21 inches and Molly and her husband, Jeff, are very happy and everyone is doing well at home.\n\nI also received an update from Ariel Diaz. Last fall he traveled to Peru and Argentina and while climbing the glacier Perito Moreno he met fellow Dartmouth alum Joel R. Reidenberg ’83. This June Ariel attended the wedding of Julia Pinover to John Kupiec ’04. There were many Dartmouth alumni there to celebrate. Ariel also mentioned that his educational startup, Boundless, is going well and they are preparing to launch their first product geared toward professors. Boundless currently reaches more than 3 million students and teachers around the world.\n\nThat’s all the news for now. Keep sending your updates.\n\n—Anne Cloudman, 315 West 99th St., Apt. 2D, New York City, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nHello, ’02s! There’s not much news this time around so when you finish reading this column, take the time to send me an update.\n\nDrew Lambert wrote me about his engagement to Christina Beale (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ’03). The couple met sailing in Westport, Connecticut, and were engaged in Bermuda this spring. As anyone who knows him would expect, Drew designed the ring himself and had it handmade. Drew is living in Connecticut and still heading up the state chapter of Dartmouth Entrepreneurial Network.\n\nThe only other piece of news is the birth of my twin girls! My husband, Ori Schnaps, and I welcomed fraternal twin girls Willa Maclean Schnaps and Eve Cloudman Schnaps on April 12. Willa and Eve were 4 pounds, 10 ounces, and 4 pounds, 9 ounces, respectively, and spent their first week in incubators in the hospital. Now both babies are home and healthy and doing well.\n\nLast, but not least, I want to mention that our class executive committee is always happy to have new members and volunteers for our class projects. Specifically, at the time of this writing, we need a new vice president and are also interested in expanding our presence on social media such as Facebook and Twitter. If you’re reading this and are interested in participating in any way, don’t hesitate to contact us at dartmouth.class.of.2002@gmail.com.\n\nThat’s all the news for now.

Molly Johnson married Jeff Hawkins on September 14 in a ceremony overlooking the Long Island Sound at the Johnson family shore cottage in Guilford, Connecticut. Jeff is a many-generation Canadian and Molly descends from the Mayflower passengers so the wedding was a true merging of early North American families. The wedding was a blast and I was happy to be there to celebrate with the happy couple along with Mara Buchbinder, Lauren Lafaro, Kristin (Shigley) Livingston, Allison (Stuntz) Schulte, Melinda Moore, Andrew Langworthy and Chuki Lord. Molly and Jeff live in New York, where Molly works in healthcare consulting and Jeff is in finance. Mike Bergen and Heidi Lawrence were married on September 14 in Darien, Connecticut, at St. John’s Church followed by a reception at Woodway Country Club. Allan Klinge, Sam Short, Charles Trumbull, Andrew Langworthy, Melinda Moore, Kip Eideberg and Brian Graner were in attendance to wish the happy couple a lifetime of happiness. Mike and Heidi had a wonderful time on their honeymoon in French Polynesia, including a blood-pumping swim with local sharks, and are spending most of their time thinking of a strategy to move to Bora Bora permanently! Stephanie Kahn married Michael Scheinkman on October 12 at the Fairmont Copley Plaza in Boston. Stephanie and Mike credit fellow ’02 Jennifer (Ain) Lippman, who set them up on a blind date three years ago, when Stephanie first moved to New York after earning her M.B.A. from the Kellogg School of Management. Stephanie is currently a marketing manager at Elizabeth Arden Inc. in New York and Mike (Columbia ’01, St. John’s Law School ’06) is an attorney at New York-based firm Davis Polk & Wardwell. Dartmouth alumni at the wedding to help the couple celebrate were Lindsay (Jernigan) Bateman, Meredith Bryan, Mara Buchbinder, Lauren (Zeranski) Chisholm, Ariel (Sinclair) Stern, Peter Stern, Sue (Beagan) Garland, Maxine (Goldstein) Hynes, Rachel Kort, Jennifer (Ain) Lippman, Anna Piazza ’00, Tammy (Gargas) Ferris ’01 and Peter Ferris ’01. Syeda Saleela Khanum Salahuddin and her husband, Blake Everett Johnson, along with their daughter Syeda Sufyana Suraiya Johnson have welcomed to their family a baby girl, Syeda Aydina Suraiya Johnson, who was born on October 12, 2013, in Washington, D.C. —Anne Cloudman, 315 West 99th St., Apt. 2D, New York City, NY 10025; acloudman@gmail.com\n\nThis time around I definitely wish the column were due just one week later, as I’m eagerly anticipating a European summer extravaganza, the highlight of which will undoubtedly be the wedding of Elizabeth Badger and John Nichols ’01 in Barcelona, Spain, on July 4, and I am quite sure I’ll be full of Dartmouth updates after that. But deadlines are what they are and I don’t yet have details of the lightweight rowers touring Barcelona by bike or catching up with classmates over bacon-wrapped figs, so here is a short but sweet update on our class.\n\nMay was a big, wonderful month for ’02 babies! On May 22 Rebecca (Eley) Weeks and Christian Weeks ’05 welcomed daughter Virginia Broeksmit Weeks at 6:05 a.m. She weighed 7 pounds, 9 ounces, and I can report that in addition to Rebecca and Christian being over the moon with her healthy arrival, Virginia can trust that all of her mom’s old 7 Maple roommates are incredibly excited about our littlest Maple. Aly Rahim wrote in to report that his wife, Zaileen, gave birth to their first child, a daughter named Inaya Zaileen Rahim, on May 23. The whole family is doing great and preparing to move back to Washington, D.C., in August after three and a half years in Ottawa, Ontario. Aly will be rejoining the World Bank group at the Washington, D.C., headquarters. Finally, Emily Quetone Khan and Shuja Khan welcomed their first son, Tucker Nasir Khan, on May 28 at 3:18 p.m. in San Francisco. “Nas” arrived with a very full head of hair and was 6 pounds, 12 ounces. Emily reports that he is growing fast and does a stellar Blue Steel impression.\n\nLynnie Rudner got engaged to Andy Correll in Utah in April and they spent the weekend hiking slot canyons in the Grand Staircase Escalante, an excursion Lynnie highly recommends. Kendra Quincy Kemp wrote in to say that Alexandra Roberts married Dr. Eric Goralnick (U.S. Naval Academy ’95) on May 31 in Cape Cod. Kendra was one of her bridesmaids, and other Dartmouth alums there for the celebration included Vickie Potterton Zalkin, Jenny Thomas ’03, Noah Shamosh ’04 and Adam Grossman ’94. Alex and Eric left the next day for their honeymoon in Greece. Congratulations, all!\n\nBy the time you read this summer will be ending and you should have plenty to share in the column—please send that news either to me or to Lonnie Threatte (lonnie.threatte@gmail.com), whose debut as guest columnist will be coming up in the next issue.

Leaird, 229 East 21st St., Apt. 16, New York, NY 10010; jt.leaird@gmail.com\n\nHello again, ’02s!

Liz and Chris Baldwin are proud to announce the arrival of Cameron Christopher Baldwin, who was born on September 7, 2009. The family lives outside of Philadelphia and takes frequent trips back to New England, where Cameron has already had his first Fenway Park experience.\n\nJeff Dwyer and his wife, Brenda Vale Dwyer ’93, welcomed their first child, Martina Charlotte Valentina Dwyer, on September 21, 2009. The family lives in Hanover.\n\nFinally, Kristin King got married on May 30, 2009, to Jeremy Wright (University of Cincinnati ’06), a fellow Ohioan. They were married in their hometown of Piqua, Ohio. Many Dartmouth alums were in attendance. Maid of honor was Correne Bredin, along with bridesmaids Carly Haggard ’03 and Kristina Guarino Coen ’01. Dartmouth guests included Judy Parish Oberting ’91, Laura Mills ’01, Kevin Coen, Emilia Peraza, Jillian Rockoff ’03, Amy Ferguson Baillie ’03, Krista Dornfried ’05 and Meagan Walton ’05. For the next two years the couple will reside in Lubbock, Texas, where Kristin goes to school at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. Jeremy works for Procter & Gamble as a mechanical engineer out of Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nHope you’re all having a wonderful holiday season and that 2010 brings terrific things your way—things that you will promptly write in to tell me about so I can share them with the class!\n\n—J.T. Leaird, 229 East 21st St., Apt. 16, New York, NY 10010; jt.leaird@gmail.com\n\nHey, ’02s, this is Lonnie Threatte writing as a guest columnist for J.T. this month, and I have two pieces of news to start with. Sadly, Leah Horowitz passed away following a multi-fatality car accident on the Ghanaian coast on May 23. Her friends say the void created by her loss is as big as the wonderment of having known her. She is very sorely missed. The June 30 edition of The Dartmouth online includes an article on Leah’s life and there is an obituary in this issue of the Alumni Magazine in celebration of her memory.\n\nElizabeth Wilder Young received the Class of 2002 Distinguished Service Award through her professional and public service activities for child welfare in the United States and in Africa. Anyone seeking to make nominations for 2010 should look for more details on the ’02 class Facebook page or in the class newsletter.\n\nThat’s the only real news I have—everything else I got off of harassing our classmates on Facebook. Adrian Bell wrote that Desmond Nation just re-graduated from Dartmouth (Tu’09) and is moving to Minneapolis, Minnesota, to start a new job. Jaison Freeman got engaged to Vanessa Frierson and is moving to College Park, Maryland, also to start a new job. Eli Diament moved to Sydney, Australia, to begin work for McKinsey.\n\nThe iconic ’02 Jen Tutak recently relocated from Hawaii to start an M.B.A. program at the MIT Sloan School of Management.
