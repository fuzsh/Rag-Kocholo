        "text": "Ryan is THAT man. You know the one, the man who can never be alone for long. It makes him edgy. Every time you see him, he’s with someone new and he never seems to think it’s strange that the paper towel sitting on your kitchen counter has outlasted the last three relationships he’s been in.\n\nRyan and Kendall weren’t playing it for comedy, but it sure as hell didn’t stop me from laughing as they told Emma about Greenlee’s death. Cam Mathieson is pretty damned hot, but the whole weepy cow-eyed thing he does when Ryan is “sad”? EH… I could live without it. But that’s not what gave me the big giggles.\n\nThe whole time I watched Kendall and Ryan break the news to Emma I wondered how much better those scenes would have been if Emma looked up at Kendall and asked her if she was going to help her daddy put Greenlee’s things in a box, just like daddy and Greenlee put her mommy’s things in boxes. That’s the natural progression of a relationship in little Emma’s life, thanks to daddy. Of course, it doesn’t bode well for Kendall that every woman who loves Ryan ends up with her things in a box ready to be shipped to soapgod knows where. But he is Ryan, and that’s not supposed to matter. He’s special.\n\nEmma lost her mother when Annie was locked away in an institution and was almost immediately given a ‘new mom’ in Greenlee. Greenlee dies shortly after and now Kendall is there, holding her, telling her that the replacement mom is now an angel (or maybe just looks like one… flying off the end of that motorcycle in a wedding gown and veil. Just sayin’). Clearly, it was impossible for Ryan to tell Emma on his own. He’s THAT man… the man who can’t do anything without a woman there to adore and support him. Who knew that Annie was actually the stable one in the relationship?\n\nThe writers will probably allow Ryan to grieve, for at least a week or two. He’ll then end up consoling Kendall. He’ll help her ‘heal’ from her feelings hurt of betrayal thanks to Zach/Bianca/Reese. It will be hard, at first, but his heart will go on… and then I think we’ll end up watching a love quad with Reese/Zach/Kendall/Ryan…\n\nI should say that YOU”ll end up watching that quadrangle, AMCers… I’ll be watching The Guiding Light.\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\nEver keen to display their decision-making prowess, TPTB at GH have decided to bring Natalia Livingston back in a new role – speculation being that NotEmily will be a long lost twin sister. Uh…short stunt returns for Genie Francis/Laura… back from the dead (sorta) for NotEmily. GEEZ!\n\nAll My Children\n\nAMC is planning a heart transplant storyline for Kendall Hart Slater. Will the donor be big brother Josh or frenemy Greenlee Smythe? Assuming Josh is the donor this storyline is not unlike the BnB storyline with Storm Logan comitting suicide in order to donate his heart to his sister Katie.\n\nHopefully the AMC writers will handle the storyline better. The BnB writers transformed the gut wrenching plot into a storyline about lust when recent recpient Katie had sex with her niece’s future husband, manwhore Nick Marone.\n\nMaybe there’s something to be said about having sex with a man who won’t blow out your brand new, freshly implanted heart. What can be said, can’t be good.\n\nAs for AMC, I REALly hope Kendall gets the REAL Greenlee’s heart. The character wore out her welcome with me the first time she married Ryan Lavery to spite Kendall. Greens isn’t slated to leave the show until Spring but there’s nothing to stop her from spending the rest of her time on canvas as a ghost comforting Kendall and Jack.\n\nAs The World Turns\n\nI’ve always loved Damiangodofall men so I’m glad to have him back. The writers have a lot of work to do to repair the character and surely they’re invested enough to do it.\n\nI can see Damian coming back as the perfect foil against Craig who will probably want Luke’s money, next. Craig has a penchant for taking on the Walsh/Grimaldi-Snyder crowd. Is it a mere coincidence that Craig returned after Lucinda’s cancer did? Lily and Holden are too busy saving their perpetually troubled marriage to help Luke or Lucinda..\n\nAnd be careful grabby grandpa Brian! Big pappa is back in town and I hope he’s a Noah fan!\n\nNo one pulls a storyline out of their…. er… out of left field like ABC soaps!\n\nAll My Children – Betrayals come in threes!\n\nI’ve never been in this situation before, so you’ll have to forgive me if this is no big deal and it’s all much ado about nothing, but is it common for a woman’s husband to donate sperm to impregnate her sister for the sake of allowing said sister and her partner to become parents? What — the— ****? My brother-in-law has helped me move before. I forced him to take a gas card as compensation. That’s the ONLY exchange we’ve ever had. It’s the ONLY exchange we’ll EVER have. Soapgod love crazy soap characters!\n\nI’m sure we’re supposed to think of Zach as having a HUGE heart and as being kind and loving toward Bianca. The trouble is that his actions weren’t exactly kind and loving toward his wife. Where, and at what point, was he going to tell Kendall? As I understand it, the backstory is that he donated his DNA on an off screen European visit to his sister-in-law and her girlfriend, Reese, this past summer. Neither Binks, nor Zach, thought it was important to share that bit of news? What happens with Miranda and the new kid? Their fathers are/were brothers. Does anyone plan to share that news with the kids? Will Zach allow Miranda to believe that she is his father, too? His children are double related all the way around. New baby is the 1/2 sibling of Miranda, and a 1/2 sibling to his child with Kendall. Kendall is Bianca’s 1/2 sibling. Kendall is taking care of Ryan’s child Emma, and is the mother of his son, Spike (making Emma and Spike 1/2 sibs)\n\nClearly, I’m speaking only in terms on DNA. Emotionally, they’re all connected and bonded as family, regardless of the DNA contributions. Maybe that answers my “what happens” question. They’ll just all be one big happy family… but C’MON. At least half of those kids are going to have to disappear, at some point, while new characters are brought to screen. They won’t be able to date, otherwise. The Lavery-Montgomery-Hart/Slater children are more than half of the child population of Pine Valley, now. Methinks Zach will soon be wishing that the only thing he gave Bianca in Europe was a bouquet of flowers. MEN!\n\nWhy wouldn’t Bianca and Reese find a donor in Europe? Why not find a donor, and preferably not an in-law, from Reese’s family? What kind of man are we to believe Zach to be, after this? What kind of sister is Bianca? In terms of sheer soap drama, this is DELICIOUS (oh yeah, ALL CAPS). The question remains, who’s left standing at the end of this circle of betrayal? Betrayed by her sister AND her husband, who had to know that she would have wanted to be in on this decision? I don’t know what sort of woman comes back when Kendall wakes up, but I sure hope she’s the ass kicking kind, because this storyline makes it clear that there are a couple of asses in need of kicking, folks!\n\nSpeaking of betrayals, what would make Jesse believe that it was ok to marry Angie again, letting her believe he’d lived a solitary life without her, and only NOW tell her about his other “wife”and child? Hey there writers, again, DELICIOUS, but our Jesse Hubbard was never a coward. He would have told her right away. Knowing that Laura Koffman is the role of “Rebecca” and that there will be fire works between the two women has me on the edge of my seat. (Shame on you, OLTL, for not bringing LK back, yourselves!). I’m planning to not miss a single moment of the Oct. 28th meeting. NO! I’m not anxious to see two women battle. I’m hoping the fireworks sparked will include a fight about who gets first dibs joining Kendall in kicking boo-tay! I’ve loved Jesse from the day the character aired, but he’s got it coming. He not only left Angie and Frankie, but when he returned, he returned full of lies, deserting yet another family in the process. Who does he think he is? Adam Chandler?\n\nOutside of AMC’s onscreen shenanigans, what do YOU think about the off screen news of Rebecca Budig leaving AMC? After a much hyped return, it must be a huge blow to TPTB who heralded the return of the “REAL” Greenlee. Since I enjoyed the recast and the depth Sabine Singh gave the character, I’m not exactly upset by the embarrassment TPTB must be feeling at this point. I have only one request. When Greenlee goes, have her take Annie and Ryan with her. I would have asked that Babe, Krystal, and Kendall hit the bricks, too, but NOW? Hell, I can’t wait for Kendall to wake up and find out what her husband and sister have done with her. Babe is already gone and we got David back in her place (uh -YAY!), and Krystal and Erica going at it over Adam? Ok, I’m intrigued!\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\nNot for nuthin’ because I’ve already mentioned it, just briefly, but what’s the freakin’ deal with Olivia and Connie/Kate? Did Connie-Kate ever warn Olivia that she was going to get back together with her father’s child? Did she tell her cousin only after the accepted proposal and impending wedding? So many levels of betrayal. Connie-Kate betrays Olivia (who seems to not be as shaken up by it as she should have been). Connie-Kate betrays Sonny by keeping Olivia’s secret. Olivia betrays Sonny by keeping him from his child. Olivia betrays her son (who won’t turn out to be Spinelli after all) by keeping his paternity from him. Sonny betrays us all, leaving viewers to scratch their heads. Fans thought Sonny had only recently become lax with birth control. It’s been a life long habit for the guy. Who knew?\n\nSonny’s punishment for his inability to keep his pants zipped, and for being unable to protect the women who are foolish enough to love and trust him? Yes, that’s right, Claudia Zacharra… fitting. How long before Claudia bears the man a child, too?\n\nFans aren’t disgusted by characters betraying one another, we look forward to it. It only upsets us when the writers treat it as ‘no big deal’. These people have been gazing into one another’s eyes, whispering sweet nothings (alternated by times of condemning and judging one another) — and lying all the while. Well played, bitches, well played. Writers? DO SOMETHING, make it count!\n\nJoin the new Sound and Fury message boards! Get there by clicking the icon posted below:"
