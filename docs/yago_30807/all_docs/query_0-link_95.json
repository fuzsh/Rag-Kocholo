Luckily, her brothers took the brunt of the abuse. She witnessed as one by one, the older Lavery's ran away from home leaving only she and Jonathan. Jonathan defended Erin from Patrickâ€™s blows, but not the mental anguish. After Jonathan left for Princeton, Erin left for Nova Scotia where she became a struggling artist. Only recently having entered the world of dating and relationships, this new territory had her trying her best to navigate its often confusing waters.\n\nDeath\n\nErin was found dead by Josh Madden. She was the second victim of the \"Satin Slayer\", a serial killer who was killing the women of Fusion Cosmetics. She was poisoned and left on a lawn chair on the Fusion rooftop. Her death hit her brothers hard, especially Jonathan, who had become inconsolable.\n\nLifeline\n\n* Born September 17 1980 (this according to grave stone marker on March 6 2007 episode).\n\n* Killed on December 12 2006 by the \"Satin Slayer\" (Alexander Cambias Sr.).\n\nRetconning\n\nErin's history has been retconned on more than one occasion. In 2001, it was stated that Gail Lavery had married Patrick Curry, [Name given on-air on \"All My Children\" on October 31, 2001.] but later had taken back her maiden name and given it to her children. This was later re-written, as Erin's father's name was later revealed to actually be Patrick Lavery. [Stated on-air on \"All My Children\" on July 19, 2004.]\n\nExternal links"
