Earlier today, Mathison took to Twitter to clear up said rumors while visiting Israel for a friend’s wedding.\n\n“Just to clear up some rumors… There is absolutely NO indication that I am going to ‘Y&R’ to play Adam Newman,” Mathison tweeted. He added, “Thanks for all the support tho.”\n\nDuring Mathison’s April visit to the CBS Television City Studios, where “Y&R” is filmed, the actor ran into former on screen “AMC” love interest Melissa Claire Egan (ex-Annie Lavery; currently portraying Chelsea Newman on “Y&R”) and Christian Le Blanc (Michael Baldwin) in the hallway. The trio ended up posing for pictures.\n\nMore recently, Mathison interviewed another former “AMC” co-star, Cady McClain (ex-Dixie Cooney; currently portraying Kelly Andrews on “Y&R”), for a segment that aired on “Entertainment Tonight.”"
