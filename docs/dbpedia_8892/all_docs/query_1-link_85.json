        "text": "Arthur Schwartz displayed musical interests early, teaching himself piano and harmonica. But his attorney father wanted him to go to law school, so Arthur graduated and passed the bar in 1924, all the time publishing songs. When he met Howard Dietz in 1928 they collaborated on âI Guess Iâll Have to Change My Planâ and âIâve Made a Habit of Youâ which appeared in Broadwayâs The Little Show (1929).\n\nIn 1930 Threeâs a Crowd featured the hit âSomething to Remember You By.â In 1931 The Bandwagon was a huge success with âDancing in the Darkâ and âI Love Louisa.â In 1932 Flying Colors produced âAlone Together,â âLouisiana Hayride,â and âA Shine on Your Shoes.â Their next 1934 show flopped but featured âYou and the Night and the Musicâ and âIf There Is Someone Lovelier Than You.â\n\nWhile Schwartz endured a series of Broadway flops, he enjoyed success writing for movies. Bette Davis sang the Oscar-nominated âTheyâre Either Too Young or Too Oldâ (lyrics by Frank Loesser) in Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943). âA Gal in Calicoâ from The Time, the Place, and the Girl (1946) earned another Academy nomination for him and lyricist Leo Robin.\n\nSchwartz turned to producing films with Cover Girl in 1944 and Night and Day in 1946. In 1948 he returned to Broadway and wrote âHaunted Heartâ which became a hit for Jo Stafford. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1951), written with Dorothy Fields, brought us âMake the Man Love Me.â In 1953 Schwartz teamed with Dietz for a film adaptation of The Bandwagon. It was nominated for best score and introduced the show biz classic, âThatâs Entertainment!â"
