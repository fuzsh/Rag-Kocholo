Henry Cavill Loved Playing Napoleon Solo in The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

After months of rigorous training and a strict diet to achieve the muscular physique of Krypton’s last son in Zack Snyder’s 2013 superhero film Man of Steel, actor Henry Cavill was ready for a change of pace. His next role would be a far cry from the chiseled hero he had just portrayed – he would be playing Napoleon Solo, a suave and sophisticated CIA agent in Guy Ritchie’s spy thriller The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

He underwent a period of controlled calorie intake, effectively ‘starving‘ himself to shed the Superman bulk. On the transformation from Superman to Spy, he said: (Via IMDb)

“There’s on season and there’s off-season. And its enjoyable being off-season [as Napoleon Solo] because when you are on season [as Superman] it’s hard work and you are starving. As much as everyone loves the idea of guys have six packs and eight packs, you are starving when you have them. It looks good but its no fun.”

Cavill was able to portray both characters, from the imposing Superman physique to the elegant spy with the same dedication.
