        "text": "HOLLYWOOD — U.N.C.L.E. H.Q. — This summer has been packed with big-budget movies that have dominated headlines and trailers. With huge flicks like \"Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" \"Jurassic World,\" \"Ant-Man\" and \"Inside Out\" it's been hard for the film \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" to gain a lot of traction. Add in the fact that the spy blockbuster \"Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation\" recently released and a number of people didn't even realize \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" was coming out.\n\nThis is a real shame, because this film is an absolute blast that exudes cool at every turn. There is a lot going for this 1960's-style spy movie based on the old TV series, but I'm here to just point out a few that highlight why this movie is totally worth your time.\n\nCast chemistry\n\nSome people don't like Armie Hammer all that much, and I'll agree; he's made a couple of not-so-great films. \"Mirror Mirror\" left a lot to be desired and the less said about \"The Lone Ranger\" the better. Even with those flicks he was still amazing in \"The Social Network,\" and I knew it was only a matter of time until I saw him in something that I really liked him in. And this is it.\n\nHammer is fantastic as the giant KGB spy Illya and his performance is made even better with fellow stars Henry Cavill as Solo and Alicia Vikander as Gaby.\n\nThese three leads have a chemistry that ignites the screen and keeps you waiting with bated breath until the trio shares the screen together again. Cavill plays one of the suavest and slickest spies you've ever seen and his delivery is maddening and delightful all at once.\n\nVikander stunned audiences with her portrayal as Ava in \"Ex-Machina,\" and here she manages to steal scenes once again. This time, however, she's not doing it with a creepy mechanic delivery, but with a flirty, independent and strong demeanor that is magnetic and mesmerizing.\n\nIt's almost impossible not to smile when these three are on screen.\n\nThrowback vibe\n\nI imagine when director Guy Ritchie proposed to Warner Bros. that \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" remake be done in the '60s era the Warner execs panicked because of the budget. It's a win for all of us that Ritchie's '60s vision of the film was signed off on, because it's one of the best parts of the flick.\n\nSpy movies are often synonymous with the '60s and the movie just fits like a glove in the Cold War era. The tailored suits, gaudy interiors and geometric dresses add to the fun and engrossing scenery throughout the film.\n\nI am not a child of the '60s — in fact I wasn't born for another 20 years — but the film still managed to make me nostalgic for a time gone by.\n\nJust so cool\n\nGuy Ritchie is known for making quirky and entertaining films like \"Sherlock Holmes,\" \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" and \"Snatch,\" and this is no exception.\n\nThe movie captivated me with how effortlessly cool it all felt. It had a level swagger that I have not seen in a movie in a very long time. The editing must have been painstaking at times, but it helps create a world of espionage that we want to be a part of.\n\nThe pacing never slows down and there are just enough twists to keep you guessing and intrigued, but never get lost. Ritchie has a way of giving you enough information to get you through and then hits you over the head with the revelation of what's really going on, and all you can do is smile and shake your head.\n\nConclusion\n\nMy conclusion is that this movie is downright fun.\n\nIf you've read my reviews before you know that I'm a sucker for spy flicks. I loved \"Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation\" and I can't wait for James Bond's latest adventure, \"Spectre,\" this November. So it probably doesn't come as a surprise that I really enjoyed \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" But take it from me: You'll have a good time at the theater.\n\nI had a blast for the entire 116 minutes I spent watching the movie.\n\nIf you haven't heard of \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" or were turned off by the less than impressive trailer, don't let that deter you from giving the movie a shot. Sure, not everyone will like it and this is just the opinion of one guy, but I'm willing to bet a majority of audiences will love this movie.\n\n\"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" is rated PG-13 for action violence, some suggestive content and partial nudity.\n\n![](http://media.bonnint.net/slc/2540/254022/25402278\\.jpg?filter=ksl/65x65\")\n\nAbout the Author: John Clyde ----------------------------"
