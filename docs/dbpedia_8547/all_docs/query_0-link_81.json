        "text": "The original TV show was much better. âThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.â aired from 1964-1968 and was extremely popular. I was 14 when Robert Vaughn, David McCallum, and Leo G. Carroll introduced the world to Napoleon Solo, IIlya Kuryakin and Alexander Waverly.\n\nI get feisty just hearing the names of Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin; two of the coolest fictional names ever. Iâm thinking about changing my name to Napoleon Harrison; no wait I meant Larry Solo. Ok, I got it: Larry Kuryakin. You can call me Larry K.\n\nWith that enthusiastic attitude and a historical background of 50 years, I entered Theatre #1 at The Fountains; yeah, the one with the reclining chairs, and I was ready to take a ride with the UNCLE characters currently played by Henry Cavill (Solo), Armie Hammer (Kuryakin), and Hugh Grant (Waverly). My money was on this movie to be a summer hit, and I was confident that it would surely take me back to my teen years with some fun and frolic.\n\nI got a bad feeling with the opening scene; actually it was the music. It was just off. The opening scenes were truly some of the best of the movie, so my gusto increased and I began believing that Director and Co-writer Guy Ritchie was about to deliver a big pitch. A pitch worth 75 million bucks! Where did all that money go?\n\nWell, most of it apparently went into the visual effects; this movie is beautifully produced and handsomely stylistic. Itâs classic Guy Ritchie. Oops, I temporarily forgot that Iâm not a big fan of Ritchie.\n\nI liked it when he did something with Madonna (2009), but letâs not forget that Ritchie directed âSherlock Holmes,â also in 2009, starring Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, and hottie Rachel McAdams. Ritchieâs take on Holmes was a flop; Iâve watched it more than once in an attempt to support three of my favorite actors. Close, but no banana. Hey, Guy, how do you mess up a movie about Sherlock freaking Holmes?\n\nHolmes reminds me of this movie; decent plot -- secret agents from the US and Soviet Union working together in the early 1960âs to stop nuclear proliferation; great visuals and lofty subject matter, but kooky chemistry. Thatâs my new term for âbad movie; itâs the directorâs fault, and dang it.â\n\nIâm tired and I wanna go home. Rock ân Roll.\n\nGrade 70.
