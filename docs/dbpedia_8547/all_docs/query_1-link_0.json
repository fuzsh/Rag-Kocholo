        "text": "Those who remember the 1960s TV series “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” should get a pleasing, nostalgic charge out of Henry Cavill’s portrayal of Napoleon Solo in the new “U.N.C.L.E.” movie.\n\nSuave, sardonic and unflappably cool, the British actor’s portrayal of the American superspy appears, at times, to channel Robert Vaughn’s original incarnation. That’s all the more uncanny considering Cavill had never seen an episode of the TV show before making the movie. Still hasn’t, in fact. Hasn’t met Vaughn, either.\n\n“I was not familiar with the TV show; it was a bit before my time,” the 32-year-old Cavill, best known for playing Superman in the 2013 “Man of Steel” and next year’s highly anticipated “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,” points out. “I think even the reruns were a bit before my time. When I was given the role, I asked Guy [Ritchie, the film’s director] if he recommended I should watch the show. He said not to worry about that. It was his job to make sure we were close to the original material and to play Napoleon my way.\n\n“So I did. It’s very important to me not to watch another actor play the same character as I’m about to play because then it stops being purely your performance. You start borrowing from the previous one and you focus too much on someone else having done it. The same when I played Superman as well. I wanted to play my own role, I didn’t go back and rewatch the previous movies. But because Napoleon is such a strong and unique personality, there are undoubtedly going to be some similarities between what Vaughn and myself have done with the character.”\n\nAlong with its 1963 Cold War setting, echoes of Vaughn are about the only things fans of the program may find reassuringly familiar in Ritchie’s movie. It’s actually a pre-United Network Command for Law and Enforcement tale of how the secret international security group’s top operatives, CIA-trained Solo and KGB veteran Illya Kuryakin, met. Not only is David McCallum’s low-key, unimposing Illya now played as a volatile giant of a man by Armie Hammer, but the Solo character is quite different from the charming, dedicated hero he once seemed to be.\n\nNow he’s a black market operator who only works for the CIA to stay out of prison. Not that that makes him an awful person.\n\n“Napoleon was a lot of fun to play,” says Cavill, whose square-jawed good looks have made him perfect casting for heroic types like Supes, “The Immortals’” Theseus and “The Tudors’” relatively loyal Charles Brandon. “He’s not the kind of character that I’ve often had the chance to play, or at all, and there’s something just so wonderfully unique about Napoleon. He’s not a bad guy but he’s definitely out for himself. He doesn’t want people to get hurt along the way — but as long as he’s happy, that’s the important thing.”\n\nDuring their first two meetings on either side of the wall in divided Berlin, Solo and Kuryakin primarily try to kill each other. But once their handlers order them to work together, it’s off to sunny Italy with East German auto mechanic Gaby (Swedish actress Alicia Vikander) to try to find her long-missing, ex-Nazi scientist father who is developing a quick-and-easy nuclear device that a jet-setting criminal couple intends to sell to the highest bidder.\n\nA well-oiled and friendly team on TV, the movie’s Solo/Kuryakin match has some issues to iron out.\n\n“The relationship they have is unique because it’s forced,” Cavill observes. “Illya is a true loyalist to the KGB and Napoleon just has to do what the CIA tells him to do. Then, of course, there’s the greater good concept of it, which initially they’re not focusing on, but they learn to appreciate because they can use each other’s skills. This despite the fact that they are, one, very different types of people and, two, just genuinely don’t like each other. But a grudging respect comes out of their various experiences together. They’re not friends, but they’re definitely not enemies, either; they’re just reluctant partners, I suppose.”\n\nRitchie is no stranger to reimagining pop culture pairs. He previously directed the steampunk “Sherlock Holmes” movies with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. “U.N.C.L.E.” was originally developed to cash in on the secret agent craze that James Bond movies ignited in the early ’60s. Indeed, the Solo character was the brainchild of series consultant Ian Fleming, 007’s creator. The long-in-development movie had Tom Cruise attached to play Solo before Cavill stepped in. Coincidentally, Cruise’s fifth “Mission: Impossible” movie, also derived from a ’60s TV spy franchise, is dominating the box office charts in the weeks leading up to “U.N.C.L.E.’s” release.\n\n“There’s just something cool about it,” Cavill says of the Cold War genre’s enduring popularity. “There’s something which is romantic, and there’s fantasy attached to it because it is not necessarily contemporary. That means we can transport ourselves away from today’s world, and there is a slight tongue-in-cheek aspect to everything they did back then. ‘Man From U.N.C.L.E.’ has serious undertones, but it doesn’t take itself too seriously and neither do the characters.”\n\nDoesn’t look like there will be much room for levity in “Batman v. Superman.” Its trailer’s brooding tone evokes the Dark Knight films as well as “Man of Steel” as it gravely realigns yet another venerable pop culture team.\n\nAlthough DC Comics’ top two properties have occasionally fought each other over the decades, they’ve mostly worked together, both in World’s Finest Comics and as members of the Justice League of America. “Dawn of Justice,” which introduces Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman as well as Ben Affleck as Batman, is also designed to launch a series of JLA movies.\n\nCavill won’t reveal specifics about the superhero sequel but does promise interesting developments for all involved.\n\n“It’s aimed at the DC Comics world and the continued evolution of it,” he says of the March, 2016 release, “and introducing new characters to it.”"
