        "text": "It’s one thing to play Superman on screen, but it’s another thing entirely to walk around looking like a Kryptonian in your everyday life. And the first thing you’re likely to notice when staring at Henry Cavill on Zoom are his shoulders—not even his Clark Kent jawline can distract from the small mountain range erupting from his humerus and clavicle. None of this is exactly news, given the multiple high-profile roles in which Cavill has transformed his body for—The DC universe, The Witcher, extremely buff Sherlock in Enola Holmes—but you truly cannot prepare for how mesmerizing those deltoids are.\n\nWhich is why Cavill’s latest role, as an ambassador for the supplement company MuscleTech is perhaps the most natural line on his resume. GQ caught up with the 38-year-old actor to find out how supplements influence his diet, his thoughts on pre-workout, and just how many meals a day you need to eat if you ever want shoulders like his.\n\nGQ: Supplements are such a huge part of the fitness world, but I think something that can often be misunderstood, especially when you’re first starting out. What was your journey with using supplements like?\n\nHenry Cavill: It's an interesting thing, because I've been very fortunate over my career to have pros guiding me. As useful as that has been when it comes to physical results and how the body looks when I'm taking my shirt off on camera or whatever the case may be, it does certainly hinder my growth in knowledge. And so over the past couple of years, I've been trying to quiz my trainer, Dave Rienzi, more and more about the why of everything. Why is that going in? Why this rather than that? Aren't they both carbohydrates? Why this protein versus that protein? What does it mean when you do this before or afterwards? And so my journey is still very much in process.\n\nOnce you started asking those questions, was there anything that you were surprised to learn?\n\nSo I have a protein shake before bed, and there would be times where I’d go, you know what, I want to lose a few more pounds, so I'm just going to cut the pre-bed shake out and not tell my trainer Dave. And it’ll be fine, because I'll be losing a few pounds and then I'll get back to showing progress photos and people will be like, “Oh wow, look at the progress you made!” But if I took three weeks off, when I would send Dave a progress photo, he would go, “Okay, cool. So are you still taking the pre-bed shake?” And I go, “No, because I wanted to lose a few pounds.”\n\nThat's when I started asking these questions because he then informed me that the problem with that logic is that, yes, you do have fewer calories going into your body, but you also go into a catabolic state with how hard you're training and how hard you're working. So actually what you're doing is you're losing muscularity while you sleep. So your body won't be looking as good. And almost immediately when I went back to the pre-bed shake, I was like, “Yeah, the body looks better already.” And for me, that was a massive learning point and a real shock. I thought, I need to start asking more questions and stop thinking that I can pull a fast one and pull the wool over his eyes.\n\nI love that Dave instantly knew, too. Like, “Hey, are you skipping that?” But I think that's the preconceived notion, right? Don't eat before bed.\n\nAbsolutely. The protein shakes before bed, they are a real lifesaver for me. Especially with the amount of work, with the amount of output I have. It's important to make sure that all the right stuff is getting in at the right time so you don't lose anything and you're not wasting any time at the gym.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nSo you’ve got the protein shake right before bed, but what does a typical day of eating look like?\n\nIt all depends on what we're trying to achieve. And if we're doing a mass-gain thing, there's going to be more calories going in. We’re kind of doing more maintenance right now. At the moment I'm in pre-production for a film. There is going to be action in it and so during the day I'm doing lots of fight scenes, learning choreography, and that is obviously physical. So I kind of have to balance out my cardio and gym work depending on what we're doing each day.\n\nBut typically when I wake up, I will have a protein shake. One and a half scoops of a 100% grass-fed whey protein—vanilla flavor—with a cup of oats and some berries and blend that up. That's one part of the breakfast. The other part is an omelet with a bit of ham in there, and I think it's about six ounces of beef filet. Depending on when I train, I'll always have a post-gym shake, but then I'll go on to meal two about three hours later, which is chicken and white rice with a side of curry sauce, because I like the flavor.\n\nMeal three is another three hours later and will be the same, but with brown rice. Then meal four will be, I think about four ounces of beef with sweet potato. I kind of like sweet potato fries because I'm not a huge fan of sweet potatoes. I have someone who preps my meals and delivers them maybe every three days—time to prep meals would be impossible with my schedule. So I just whack those sweet potatoes in the oven to crisp them up as much as possible. And then it's the pre-bed shake. Ideally, another three hours later but if time is of the essence and I need to get to bed, then it's okay to have it an hour and a half, two hours after.\n\nIs your pre-bed protein shake pretty similar to the shake you start your mornings off with?\n\nNo, it will just be protein. It'll just be two scoops of protein or one and a half, depending on where we're at.\n\nSo the age-old question for you then: What do you mix your whey protein powder with?\n\nWater.\n\nWater!?\n\nYeah, I know. Once you’ve had milk with your protein shake, it’s really hard to go back. You’re like, “Hold on a second, this doesn’t taste like dessert anymore!”\n\nExactly. That’s the whole point of the workout!\n\nMuscleTech has done a really good job with that. Especially with the grass-fed whey protein, which are the ones which I'm taking every day. Day in, day out. They have two flavors, chocolate and vanilla. The chocolate one is genuinely amazing, even with water. And I will just put less water depending on how dessert-like I want it to taste. It's got a really good sort of a mint taste, which makes it taste like real chocolate rather than typical artificial-protein-shake chocolate. And the vanilla one is really, really good for when I'm having berries in my shake in the morning because a chocolate oatmeal berry shake for breakfast before doing interval sprints can be a little too much sometimes.\n\nA little heavy on the stomach.\n\nYeah. So I'll do the vanilla in the morning. Or I'll use the vanilla sometimes just after my—I have a hamstring injury and I was doing recovery and then I had to go into a shoot we did together with MuscleTech. It was a fine line of losing weight and gaining muscle at the same time, so we had to sort of toe that line and find that balance. And so I was taking Cell-Tech Elite creatine as well after my workout in my protein shake. And because it's quite a strong berry flavor, to have that with chocolate would be a bit much after a hard workout. So I used the vanilla with that and it actually blended really nicely and made quite an interesting shake.\n\nIs there a go-to supplement that you can’t go without? You know, the one thing you’ll pack in a suitcase, just to make sure you have it with you?\n\nI mean, I feel like grass-fed whey protein is too much of an easy answer because that's my diet basically. That's an absolute necessity. I can't travel without it. But moving on from that, actually it’s the Shatter Elite pre-workout. That stuff is really good. I’m working silly hard most of the time, getting up at the crack of dawn or way before dawn and then working all the way through it. Especially when you're really, really tired, it does give you a really good pick up and kick up the ass to get into the gym. And it doesn't just drop you off the edge after your workout where you're like, “I need to take more.” It's a really, really good supplement. That's probably my go-to on-the-road supplement. And it gives you a wicked good pump, too.\n\nI wanted to ask you about pre-workouts. They are becoming quite the hot topic, especially given some dubious methods on TikTok. But when taken as intended, I was curious if you were a fan of them?\n\nYes, I am. Absolutely. Especially on The Witcher when I was doing my physio—physical therapy is what you guys call it over there—for my hamstring. Before work every day, I was getting up at 4 a.m. to 4:30 a.m. to do about an hour and a half, two hours, two and a half hours of physical therapy. And it finished with doing sprints. So before work, where you still have to go and do a 12 hour day, while recovering from a fairly serious injury—I absolutely needed that boost.\n\nSo I would take that pre-workout before doing my sprints and I actually did notice an enormous performance difference. There would be days where I’d be saying, “What's wrong with you? Today you're just dragging ass.” And then I’d realize, I didn't have any pre-workout. Okay, well, let's take it tomorrow and we'll see what the difference is. And sure enough, it's just that little bit of an extra kick which made all the difference. I was getting faster and faster. My form was better, which was especially important when recovering and doing sprints with a hamstring injury.\n\nWhen you’re training, it’s just as important to be mentally on the ball as it is physically. Even more so when recovering from an injury.\n\nBut also, when you're on reasonably low calories for the level of training you're doing, and there's also a 12-hour workday, and it's been a long shoot working five day or six day weeks, and you go to the gym either at the end of the day or in the morning, and you're hitting the gym really hard, but you’re not looking good.... You're going, “Ugh, my muscles aren't looking great, they're not looking full, they're looking flat.” A good pre-workout—when I take it, I get that wicked good pump. And mentally you're going, “I smashed it in the gym today. I can't wait to go back and see that again.” So for me, it's psychological as well as physical.\n\nOne thing I’ve really admired over the years about your approach to fitness is the way which you blend different mindsets of fitness into your life. You may be taking from competitive bodybuilding with water retention to prepare for that scene in The Witcher, but you’ve also advocated for functional strength training and using lower weights. Is there a particular training method that you’ve picked up over the years that has stuck with you, that you now incorporate into maintenance mode?\n\nI think the one thing I've discovered over the years is, find something you enjoy doing and do that when it comes to maintenance. The gym shouldn't always be some sort of grueling, terrible slog. I discovered recently while doing my recovery that I enjoy sprints. I can make my interval sprints as hard or as easy as I want that day in the gym, but I'm always going to feel good after them. I'm going to go to bed thinking, Okay, interval sprints in the morning. Yeah, I know it's cardio, but actually I'd really quite enjoy it. If there's any kind of trick, it's find something you love doing and do that thing. Especially when it comes to maintenance. Enjoy doing it, get good at it, then get really good at it.\n\nOf course, it’s also important to find something you hate and to do that all the time, too. Because then you'll get good at that thing and you'll stop hating it. But as far as when you're massively under stress, when things are hard and the going gets tough and you're forcing yourself to get up and go to the gym, make it something you enjoy doing. Life is hard enough. The gym should be our place of hard work but good feelings.\n\nRead More\n\nThe Real-Life Diet of Flula Borg, Who Declined Butt Cushions to Fill Out His Suicide Squad Costume\n\nThe German actor changed his approach to fitness to play an Olympic javelin thrower turned supervillain."
