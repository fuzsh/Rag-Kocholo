        "text": "“DARK PLACES” My rating: C+\n\n113 minutes | MPAA rating: R\n\n“Gone Girl” is a hard act to follow.\n\nThat 2014 film — the first to be adapted from the three best-selling mystery novels by Kansas City native Gillian Flynn — offered a surfeit of riches: a gnarly yarn that nastily doubled back on itself, a scathing indictment of modern media and its consumers, and one of the most savage commentaries on marriage ever sold as popular entertainment.\n\nAdd to the mix masterful direction by David Fincher (who absolutely nailed the darkly hilarious misanthropy that characterizes Flynn’s best work) and stellar turns by Ben Affleck and Oscar-nominated Rosamund Pike, and you had a film that excelled on numerous levels.\n\nBy comparison “Dark Places,” adapted by writer/director Gilles Paquet-Brenner from an earlier Flynn novel, is fairly straightforward and one-dimensional.\n\nThe film captures Flynn’s gloomy outlook without offering the antidote of biting humor, and is so single-mindedly bent on building its narrative that there’s little room left to explore other ideas.\n\nMost problematic, the plot relies on mind-boggling coincidence. This was bothersome on the printed page; it feels patently phony on the screen.\n\nLibby Day (Charlize Theron) is an antisocial loner living in hoarder squalor in a Kansas City apartment (though set in Kansas and Missouri, “Dark Places” was filmed in Louisiana).\n\nNearly 30 years earlier she was the sole survivor of the notorious “Kansas prairie massacre” in which her mother and two older sisters were murdered on the family farm. Based largely on Libby‘s testimony, her teenage brother Ben was convicted and is now serving a life sentence.\n\nFor years the emotionally damaged and employment challenged Libby has gotten by on donations from a sympathetic/morbid public. But now her bank account is empty.\n\nSo when Lyle (Nicholas Hoult), president of a local society of true-crime groupies, offers to pay to have Libby’s brain picked by the membership, she reluctantly accepts — even though it means a bizarre confrontation with a Bob Berdella role player.\n\n(more…)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\n“IRRATIONAL MAN” My rating: C+\n\n96 minutes | MPAA rating:R\n\nEven the most devoted Woody Allen fan now approaches his new pictures with caution.\n\nWhich Woody will we get this time? The classic comedian who blends big laughs with serious themes? Or the dour dramatist who dishes joyless Scandinavian gloom?\n\n“Irrational Man” falls mostly into the latter category. At its most basic level it is, like 2005’s “Match Point,” a murder drama. This time around, though, the satisfactions are relatively few.\n\nAbe (an excellent Joaquin Phoenix) is an academic superstar and a miserable human being. Revered in philosophy circles, he’s a provocative teacher (“Much of philosophy is verbal masturbation”) and a rather seedy alcoholic who carries a hip flask and isn’t afraid to pull a stiff one while trudging across the quadrangle.\n\nHaving burned many bridges, Abe shows up for the summer session at a New England college and immediately draws the attention of two dissimilar women — even though he’s obviously a weary depressive with a substantial middle-age gut.\n\nAbe begins an affair with the vaguely pathetic Rita (Parker Posey), a married colleague in the philosophy department. Initially he’s impotent (“I was hoping it would come back as mysteriously as it left”), but Rita sees that as only a slight handicap, reasoning that after her boring husband “it’s interesting to be around someone complicated.”\n\nMeanwhile Abe launches an intellectual relationship with Jill (Emma Stone), a bright student who clearly idolizes him. Give him points for keeping his relationship with Jill platonic — at least until it isn’t.\n\n(more…)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\n“BOULEVARD” My rating: B\n\n88 minutes | MPAA rating: R\n\nEven without the knowledge that it is Robin Williams’ last film, “Boulevard” would be a melancholy affair.\n\nWilliams plays Nolan Mack, a bank loan officer who for most of his 60 years has been ignoring the fact that he’s gay.\n\nNolan has been married for four decades to Joy (Kathy Baker). They’re friends, no longer lovers. Separate bedrooms. Pretty much separate lives. There’s love there, but no heat.\n\nHe’s the kind of buttoned-down guy who keeps his tie on after getting home from work.\n\nNolan only lets down his hair — and then only a bit — when hanging with his oldest and best friend, Winston (an excellent Bob Odenkirk), a sardonic college prof with a long history of affairs with his students. In Winston’s presence Nolan relaxes enough to let his sense of humor slip out. Just a bit.\n\nNolan’s mother recently died and his father is slipping into dementia. After one grim night at the nursing home Noland cruises aimlessly through the city’s streets and comes across Leo (Roberto Aguire), a young hustler.\n\nNolan is smitten. He buys the young man small gifts. He presents him with a cell phone so they can always be in contact.\n\n(more…)\n\nRead Full Post »"
