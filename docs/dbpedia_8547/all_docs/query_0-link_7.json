Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: \"With great power comes great responsibility.\"\n\nSpider-Man has declared that this article is still under construction.\n\nPlease don't delete or edit this article yet because it may contrast with the original author's edits.\n\nAfter I finish this article, the world will be saved!\n\nNapoleon Solo (born March 9, 1929) is the main character from The Man from U.N.C.L.E. He is a spy who worked for an international espionage organization at the height of the Cold War.\n\nHe is portrayed by Henry Cavill, who also portrays Superman in DC Extended Universe.\n\nBio[]\n\nSet against the backdrop of the early 1960s period of the Cold War and centering around respective CIA and KGB agents; the American Napoleon Solo and Russian Illya Kuryakin. The two are forced to team up on a joint mission to stop a mysterious international criminal organization led by Victoria Vinciguerra, which is bent on destabilizing the fragile balance of power through the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology. The duo’s only lead is Gaby Teller, the daughter of a vanished German scientist, who is the key to infiltrating the criminal organization, and they must race against time utilizing her connections and prevent a worldwide catastrophe.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nSolo is very smarmy, he can come off as quite insufferable, and has enough snark to cover whole city blocks—but when the chips are down, he shows his real colors. Exemplified at the end when he shows that for all his talk, he recognized what Illya's watch meant to him—when he happens to gun down the mook who has it, he takes it and returns it to Illya, instead of picking up his gun, despite having it readied."
