        "text": "Supes Looking Fierce In New 'Batman v Superman' Teaser\n\nIt's heeeere!\n\nThe Gotham fall finale delivered a new teaser from Batman v Superman. Check it out.\n\nThe clip gave us a peek at a new trailer that will be released Wednesday, on Jimmy Kimmel Live.\n\nHere's a bit of what the Hollywood trades had to say..\n\nUSA Today:\n\nThe short clip is literally a staring contest between Batman and Superman (who apparently thinks masks are silly). Everyone's super serious about the whole affair, too (..) But don't worry, you'll get to see more of these incredible brooding stares on Wednesday's episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live, because apparently that's where nerd things happen on television now.\n\nDeadline:\n\nWe’ll save a fuller reaction for then, but it’s worth noting, since everyone on social media is talking about it, that this is probably not the film’s actual portrayal of Superman. My guess is that we just saw a paranoid nightmare Batman has about a world ruled by Superman.\n\nDream sequence or not, we can't wait to see the full trailer. We're staying on top of the very latest for you, as we count down to March 25, 2016.\n\nTeam Supes all the way!\n\nHenry on 'Best Dressed' List, UK U.N.C.L.E. Blu-ray Countdown\n\nNew York premiere of The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\n\nIt looks like those sharp Dunhill suits are paying off ;)\n\nHarper's Bazaar just came out with its list of the Best Dressed Men of 2015, and Henry is on it!\n\nThe magazine used the pic of the cool outfit Henry wore to The Man from U.N.C.L.E. premiere in London, but as you know he wore Dunhill throughout the press tour.\n\nToronto premiere of The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\n\nIn fact Henry was in Shanghai with Dunhill just a few weeks ago, as he mentioned in his latest Instagram/FB posts.\n\nThe 'Best Dressed' title is well deserved!\n\nHenry has also been getting a lot of praise for his portrayal as the dapper Solo in U.N.C.L.E.\n\nGif: Nicole Hammer.\n\nAnd the Blu-ray and DVD are about to be released in the UK!\n\nYou can also try your chance at winning a copy. Good luck, and have a great week everyone.\n\nFlashback Saturday: Beanie Time in Salt Lake City!\n\nDo you know where Superman buys his Christmas trees? @moderndisplay, of course! Come on in today for some super #smallbusinesssaturday deals, up to 35% off! Also, enjoy this picture of Superman at our Christmas tree pickup. 🎁 #shopsmall #superman #henrycavill #christmastrees\n\nA photo posted by Modern Display (@moderndisplay) on Nov 28, 2015 at 7:27am PST\n\nA Salt Lake City shop has just shared their wintry photo with Henry. He was there training for Batman v Superman in December of 2013, when he walked in to get ready for the holidays.\n\nHere are the rest of the pics from that day. The fan who posted the photo went on to say that Henry was \"such a nice guy,\" and \"so fun to work with.\"\n\nRight now Henry is filming Sand Castle in Jordan which wraps in January, but hopefully this year he gets to be home for Christmas.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving From You, Us, And Henry!\n\nFour months away!\n\nThat's all we could think of when we saw that lovely Thanksgiving post. And then Lex shared his holiday message.. and freaked us out a bit.\n\nIn all seriousness, today many of us will be celebrating Thanksgiving. And aside from the obvious gratitude for our families and our troops who are out there risking their lives so we can have our freedom, we would also like to thank YOU.\n\nWe wouldn't be here without you helping us support Henry in any way we can. From sending in holiday wishes for him, to cheering for him and his latest projects, to helping him raise funds for his charity work, you guys have been the best. So thank you, we really do appreciate you for helping us keep the blog a positive place for Henry.\n\nWe take our cue from him. Henry is a person who takes the time to thank each fan who asks for a pic or autograph, all the way up to the designer house which for years has supported him and believed in him and his career (and keeps him looking dashing at red carpet events).\n\nSo our last thanks this year go out to him, for inspiring this blog. You're a good man Henry Cavill, and we're very proud to support you in everything you do. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!\n\nP.S. It looks like Henry is enjoying a Thanksgiving meal in Jordan via producer Justin Nappi. :)\n\nHenry's Latest Message On Social Media: Adopt Ben The Bat\n\nHenry is back on social media with a message of conservation!\n\nJust last week Durrell Wildlife released a new interview with their ambassador, where Henry talked about his encounter with the bats at the Jersey park and why it's so important to save them. During his recent visit he got to meet \"Ben,\" who he adopted and now so can you!\n\nCheck out the new video of Henry hanging out with the bats, and learn how you can adopt Ben.\n\nWhen you visit cavillconservation.com, you can also sign up for Henry's latest updates and find the best holiday gifts while helping him save endangered animals.

And we couldn't have asked for a better shot -- Check out the camo shorts and that flashy gun!\n\nHenry is apparently working with Aika, a German Shepherd who we're guessing plays one of the dogs used by the U.S. military to help them avoid improvised explosive devices or IEDs.\n\nIn the film Henry plays a Special Forces Captain stationed in Baqubah, where Nicholas Hoult's character (Matt Ocre) is sent with his unit to repair a broken water system.\n\nSand Castle is set during the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq in 2003, and is based on screenwriter Chris Roessner's experience as a machine gunner during that time.\n\nWe've been keeping up with the rest of the cast since filming began November 1st, and a few days ago Coimbra shared some new photos from the set.\n\nFilming is set to wrap in early January, look for updates from Jordan as they come in.\n\nStay safe, Henry.\n\nP.S. We apparently missed that Henry is wearing a Punisher t-shirt and a fan let us have it on Instagram. Marvel fans can be so touchy.. :p\n\nIn any case The Punisher is known as an anti-hero, so does the shirt have any sort of meaning or is it just a badass style choice for Captain Syverson? (Time did a really good piece on the history of the character's logo and how it's been used in Iraq). We can't wait to learn more about Henry's role in Sand Castle!\n\nUPDATE: The dog training business has shared a second photo of Henry & his costar Aika.\n\nHere's Aika again with @henrycavill at the #sandcastle movie set #caninersdogtraining #jo #jordandog #instadogs #beautifuldogs #DDR #cute #dreamdogs #doggies #black #tan #color #mydog #dogtraining #allaboutdogs #germanshepherd #workingdog #workline #showdog #showline #GSD #dog #doglovers #puppies #puppy #pyppytraining #training #puppylovers\n\nA photo posted by T'haghepsau Inal (@caninersdogtraining) on Nov 24, 2015 at 10:54pm PST\n\nThe Man From U.N.C.L.E. Featurette & TV Spot - UK, You're Next!\n\nThe long holiday weekend is almost here (U.S.), and if you still haven't watched/bought The Man from U.N.C.L.E. we have a few more new teasers to help convince you that you need to own it now.\n\nThe 'Meet The Characters' featurette shares some cool highlights, and don't miss this awesome behind the scenes clip included in the Blu-ray extras..\n\nA new TV spot was also released, since you can also catch the film on Digital HD.\n\nU.N.C.L.E. fans have shown their love for Solo and the rest of the cast through their artwork, and some of the creations were even chosen to use as promotional material for the film. You can see some of the awesome work below..\n\nThere are still some contests running in connection with the Blu-ray/DVD release of the movie. Click on the links to enter..\n\nAnd we knew Solo's stare was hard to resist, and apparently even pets can't turn away.. ;)\n\nGif: Amancanfly\n\nUK, just a few more weeks until you get to bring home your copy of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. -- Pre-order it here.\n\nBatman v Superman: Warner Brothers Ready To Go!\n\nWith just four months to go until Batman v Superman, the two have secured their spot at the Warner Brothers lot in Burbank.\n\nErin was the first one to spot the new posters that just went up by the main entrance to the studios. Here are our pics and video.\n\nThere were rumors we might be getting a new trailer by Thanksgiving (with the release of Creed), but so far nothing has materialized. However producer Charles Roven did tell Collider we're definitely seeing one before the year is over. The anticipation is killing us!\n\nHenry On Almost Becoming A Royal Marine, How Acting Helped Him Escape Bullies\n\nLondon based Loaded men's magazine, has just relaunched as a digital publication and they have a new interview with Henry!\n\nIn it he talks about almost becoming a Royal Marine (which he now represents through their charity):\n\n“My brother Niki is a bit of a ninja and I probably would have joined the Royal Marines if acting hadn’t worked out. That would have been my target.”\n\nHe also mentions how acting helped him escape bullies when he was in school:\n\n“I was bullied, but no-one could make fun of me when I was playing a character on stage, because it was what I was told to do. The bullies told me, ‘Actually, you were quite good in that’. It felt so good that I thought acting was probably something I should pursue.”\n\nAnd what about that journey of 1,000 miles that mentor Russell Crowe mentioned when Henry asked him for acting advice?\n\n“I think I’m probably creeping up towards the 2,000-mile mark of that journey now. I’m on the next portion of the journey now… to the mountain range.”\n\nThe journalist who wrote the article, seemed to shade it with his personal view of the military. So keep that in mind when you're reading his full interview with Henry. You can check it out at Loaded magazine.\n\nThis week Henry also landed on Vulture's list of \"Most Valuable Stars of 2015.\"\n\nHenry came in at #70 ahead of stars like Nicole Kidman, Robert De Niro, Russell Crowe, and Jessica Chastain.\n\nYou can read more on how Vulture came up with the rankings and who else made the list on their site. Way to go Superman ;)\n\nEver since he joined Instagram and Facebook last month, Henry has also been ranking higher on IMDb. This week he comes in at #36, with The Man from U.N.C.L.E. holding its ground as the 6th most popular movie on the site behind the latest Hunger Games, Spectre, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\n\nGo Solo! -- Hope you've already picked up your Blu-ray/DVD which is out for some of you. The UK gets it December 7th.\n\nWe're a little bit more than four months away from the release of Batman v Superman, and Henry will soon be filming Sand Castle in Jordan, so make sure to keep checking back with us. Things are about to get a lot busier around here.\n\nPortrait: Cindy Ord/Getty Images.\n\n'Sand Castle' Cast Almost Complete: Where Are You Henry?\n\nAs we predicted when filming began on November 1st, the Sand Castle cast has been very active on social media -- sharing pics and tweets from Jordan..\n\nAnd even the goats are getting their 15 minutes of Sand Castle fame..\n\nClearly Henry is not an \"Eagle..\" at least not yet. And like we mentioned before, Captain Syverson is stationed in Baqubah and is not part of Nicholas Hoult's unit. However with filming set to wrap in early January, the window for Henry to arrive is getting smaller!\n\nThis week it was announced that actor Navid Negahban has joined Henry in the film. The next day he posted a pic already in Jordan..\n\nHere's a bit more on who Navid will play via The Wrap:\n\n\"Sand Castle\" is based on a true story and centers on Matt Ocre (Hoult), who is part of a mission to repair a broken water system in the dangerous and unstable Iraqi village of Baqubah. While the people of Baghdad welcome the Americans as saviors, the villagers resist their presence and Matt and his unit must try to convince the community that they are part of the solution, not the problem, in order to leave the town and get out alive.\n\nNegahban has been cast in the role of Kadeer, a local school teacher in the Iraqi village who is desperate to get his children fresh water and starts helping out Ocre as he navigates the increasingly unstable situation in the village.\n\nAlright, that's about it for now. We're hoping the next Sand Castle update we bring you is of Henry already in Jordan! -- Have a safe weekend everyone.\n\nDurrell TV: Henry Hangs Out With The Bats, Talks Conservation\n\nOur congratulations are going out to Durrell Wildlife, after the launch of their latest project: Durrell TV!\n\nWe're thrilled to bring you this first episode of Durrell TV!
