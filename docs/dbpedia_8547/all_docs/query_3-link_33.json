        "text": "I don’t know about you, but I’ve been doing a lot of binge watching the last several months while we’ve all been in lockdown dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. I probably should’ve taken advantage of all the time I’ve spent killing brain cells streaming to do something more productive like organize pictures, finish that book I started to write a million years ago, learn a new language, clean out my closet, or even just catch up on all the movies and television shows I haven’t seen yet. But while I’ve been scrolling through all the different services I’m currently subsribed to (which is too many), I find myself more and more gravitating back to old friends. I don’t really know why. It just feels good to spend time with them again. I like to think of it as comfort food binging — like eating a big bowl of mac and cheese, which I often do while I’m comfort binging (because the last several months have really kicked my butt).\n\nI’ve always been a big fan of period dramas. Another thing I don’t really know why. I just like them. Maybe it’s the corsets. The jewels. The castles. The men in leather with their lace-trimmed blouses. They’re just a nice escape from all the uncertainty we’re all dealing with right now, and let’s face it — sometimes it’s just good to shut down the brain and escape for awhile. Especially when you decide to escape with an old friend who is as close as you can get to perfection.\n\nOk. So maybe there’s not such thing as “perfect”, but if you like tall, dark, and handsome Henry Cavill comes pretty close — at least for me. Between the upcoming release of the Snyder cut of Justice League, and reports of Cavill in talks to return as Superman in an upcoming DC movie the actor has been in the news a lot the last few months. I’m okay with that, because I really like his take on the superhero (and he is hot AF in all that Superman spandex!).\n\nI have to admit, it’s Cavill’s period roles that I’ve been spending time with lately. Fortunately, there’s a lot to choose from, so here’s a rundown of all of the actor’s period dramas. Whether you like hot men with swords, hot men in lace, hot men in wigs, hot men in nothing, or just hot men — there’s something for you!\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo (2002)\n\nIn his review of this 2003 film critic Roger Ebert wrote “I Capture the Castle is the kind of novel dreamy adolescents curl up with on rainy Saturdays, imagining themselves as members of a poor but brilliantly eccentric family living in a decrepit English castle.” Based on the 1949 novel of the same name by British author, Dodie Smith (who also wrote The Hundred and One Dalmations), it chronicles the adventrues of an eccentric family, the Mortmains, struggling to live in genteel poverty in an old castle during the 1930’s. This coming-of age story stars lots of names you’ll recognize like: Bill Nighy, Rose Byrne, Romola Garai, Henry Thomas, Tara Fitzgerald, and Henry Cavill in a blink-and-you’ll miss him role. He plays the charming, but awkward son of the late cook that works for the Mortmain family. If you’re a “completionist” and wan to check off “all Henry Cavill period roles” off your viewing list check it out. I saw this in the theater when it came out and it is charming.\n\nTristan + Isolde (2006)\n\nDo I even really need to say anything about Cavill’s run on The Tudors? Probably not. But I will anyway. The Tudor period of English History has been one of my areas of study since I was a kid (because I’m weird like that) so this series was must-see tv for me when it initially aired. Cavill plays Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk for four seasons on the Showtime series. I re-watched the entire season my first weekend of a 3-week quarantine back in mid-March and it was everything I needed it to be (again). The show takes a lot of historical license which should bother me (but it doesn’t), and Cavill is a big reason why. His character is a terrible womanizer and would be a nightmare to be with (which is probably why I’m attracted to him), but he’s so handsome and charming in the role I don’t care.\n\nThe Immortals (2011)\n\nI’m a huge fan of Greek mythology, and I love a good (and sometimes, bad) sword and sandal flick, so I’m embarrassed to say I missed seeing The Immortals in the theaters because in theory, this movie should be right in my wheelhouse. I finally got around to checking it out recently and I even paid to rent it. Short synopsis — Cavill stars as Theseus, a man chosen by Zeus (Luke Evans), to fight against King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke), who declares war against humanity by planning to release the Titans. If your a fan of mythology and sword and sandal flicks this sounds promising — right?!? Not so much. The movie is an abosolute hot mess, but there’s lots of shirtless and dirt - smeared Henry Cavill. So it has that going for it.\n\nThe Witcher (2019)"
