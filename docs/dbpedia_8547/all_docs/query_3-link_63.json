        "text": "In an alternate timeline somewhere, Henry Cavill was the one to utter the infamous line “this is the skin of a killer, Bella” as he twinkles in the sunlight in Twilight.\n\nOld blog posts from Twilight author Stephanie Meyer resurfaced in an appearance on the podcast Happy Sad Confused that claimed Cavill was the only person she could imagine playing the role of the undead teenager Edward Cullen. “The most disappointing thing for me is losing my perfect Edward. Henry Cavill is now twenty-four years old. Let us have a moment of quiet in which to mourn…”, she wrote in July 2007, just a few months before Robert Pattinson was announced as the film's lead. Further on in the post, she mentions the reason that Cavill was out of the running was that she didn't want to consider anyone over the age of 21, and Pattinson was just within that threshold when he was cast. The revelation came in the same conversation where Cavill admitted he was “very close” to being cast as Bond, but was thought to be too young for the role that eventually went to Daniel Craig. Ah the classic conundrum, too young for Bond but too old for Edward Cullen.\n\nHe may have missed out on everyone's favourite emo vampire, but in 2007 Meyer was set on getting him in the franchise one way or another. She added that he could have made a perfect Carlisle Cullen, adopted father of the vampiric Cullen clan, but the role eventually went to Peter Facinelli. On the podcast, Cavill said there were no hard feelings with Pattinson over the role that went on to create Beatles-level mania amongst fans. “I didn’t know about them wanting to cast me and the internet wasn’t quite the tool that it is now and so I only found out afterwards. I was like, ‘Oh okay, that would have been cool.’” It was also brought up that Cavill auditioned for the role of Cedric Diggory in the Harry Potter franchise, which ended up also eventually going to Pattinson. He joked “I'm sensing some Batman rivalries”, referencing the pair's current caped status in the DCEU."
