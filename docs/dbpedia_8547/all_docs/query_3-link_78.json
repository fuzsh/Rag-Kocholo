        "text": "It’s claimed that Henry Cavill is suiting up as none other than Wolverine for Marvel in the MCU as part of the Deadpool & Wolverine movie.\n\nThe news follows it said that Henry Cavill has signed with Marvel and has been cast in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a role considered “shocking.”\n\nCavill has been rumored for Marvel for a while, and due to departing ways with DC over Superman is now free to take on other superhero roles.\n\nWhat are the details about Henry Cavill as Wolverine?\n\nThe info comes via Giant Freakin Robot whose same sources nailed Linda Cardellini voicing Lylla the Otter in Guardians of the Galaxy 3, which was confirmed by James Gunn. The site also recently said Seth Rogen is working on an R-rated Venom animated movie.\n\nThe site says the source filled them in that Henry Cavill’s appearance as Wolverine in Deadpool & Wolverine will be a one-off for now, which may suggest that Cavill could always suit up as another character in the MCU at a later date.\n\nUpdate: The CanWeGetSomeToast Twitter account confirms the news.\n\n“I can confirm that Henry Cavill will in fact play a Wolverine variant in ‘DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE,'” tweeted the account which is believed to be run by a Disney or Marvel employee or run by a pro PR company. “Fans will be very pleased with his appearance.”\n\nWhich Wolverine Variant is Henry Cavill playing?\n\nA description of Henry Cavill as Wolverine is also given in that his Wolverine will be wearing a long brown coat when he shows up in the film.\n\nMy first thought hearing that suggests he could possibly be playing a comic book accurate Old Man Logan, so maybe they will age-up Cavill a bit, which would then mean he could return looking like his normal self as another character in the MCU down the road.\n\nRumors have been flying that Henry Cavill could be Doctor Doom in the MCU and Fantastic Four, and he’s a massive fan-favorite to play Captain Britain, so in addition to playing Wolverine in Deadpool 3, we’ll have to see what Kevin Feige has cooking.\n\nPer all speciation and rumors, Feige is coming through big time for fans, and worth a mention is that Disney and Marvel really need a home run with this movie.\n\nHenry also has The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare coming up, another untitled Guy Ritchie project, the Highlander reboot, and Cavill is developing the live-action Warhammer cinematic universe over at Amazon Prime Video.\n\nFan art:\n\nWhat is Deadpool & Wolverine about?\n\nShawn Levy directs DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE which stars Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, Emma Corrin, Morena Baccarin, Rob Delaney, Leslie Uggams, Karan Soni, and Matthew Macfadyen.\n\nKevin Feige, Ryan Reynolds, Shawn Levy, and Lauren Shuler Donner produce with Louis D’Esposito, Wendy Jacobson, Mary McLaglen, Josh McLaglen, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, George Dewey, Simon Kinberg, and Jonathon Komack Martin serving as executive producers.\n\nDEADPOOL & WOLVERINE is written by Ryan Reynolds & Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick & Zeb Wells & Shawn Levy.\n\nMarvel Studios’ DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE opens in U.S. & Canadian movie theaters on July 26, and will be available in IMAX, RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema, 4DX, Cinemark XD, and premium screens everywhere.\n\nWatch the trailer:"
